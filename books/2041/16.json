{"id":109472,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I EXPLAINED AWAY my chemistry experiment by saying that it was just a substance I had on hand from when I received my tattoo, in the event I had an allergic reaction. I certainly didn\u0027t let on that I\u0027d mixed it myself. I think they would\u0027ve bought that cover story, if not for the fact that a few days later, I was able to get ahold of a formula that helped treat the chemical burns on Kristin\u0027s skin. The mixture did nothing for the ink stain - that seemed to be permanent, barring some tattoo laser removal - but her welts did fade a little bit.\n After that, word got around that Sydney Melrose was the new on-site pharmacist. Because I had extra left over from Kristin, I gave the remainder of the skin cream to a girl with severe acne since it worked on that as well. That probably didn\u0027t do me any favors. People approached me for all sorts of things and even offered to pay me. Some requests were pointless, like cures for headaches. Those people I simply told to buy some aspirin. Other requests were out of my power and nothing I wanted to deal with, like birth control.\n Aside from the weird requests, I actually didn\u0027t mind the increase in my daily social interaction. I was used to people needing things from me, so that was familiar territory. Some people just wanted to know more about me as a person, which was new and more enjoyable than I\u0027d expected. And still others wanted... different things from me.\n \"Sydney.\"\n I was waiting for my English class to start and was startled to see one of Greg Slade\u0027s friends standing over my desk. His name was Bryan, and although I didn\u0027t know much about him, he\u0027d never come across as obnoxious as Slade, which was a point in Bryan\u0027s favor.\n \"Yes?\" I asked, wondering if he wanted to borrow notes from me.\n He had shaggy brown hair that seemed to be purposely grown unkempt and was actually kind of cute. He ran a hand over it as he picked his words. \"Do you know anything about silent films?\"\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"The first ones were developed in the late nineteenth century and sometimes had live musical accompaniment, though it wasn\u0027t until the 1920s that sound become truly incorporated into films, eventually making silent ones obsolete in cinema.\"\n Bryan gaped, as though that was more than he\u0027d been expecting. \"Oh. Okay. Well, um, there\u0027s a silent film festival downtown next week. Do you think you\u0027d want to go?\"\n I shook my head. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. I respect it as an art form but really don\u0027t get much out of watching them.\"\n \"Huh. Okay.\" He smoothed his hair back again, and I could almost see him groping for thoughts. Why on earth was he asking me about silent films? \"What about Starship 30? It opens Friday. Do you want to see that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t really like sci-fi either,\" I said. It was true, I found it completely implausible.\n Bryan looked ready to rip that shaggy hair out. \"Is there any movie out there you want to see?\"\n I ran through a mental list of current entertainment. \"No. Not really.\" The bell rang, and with a shake of his head, Bryan slunk back to his desk. \"That was weird,\" I muttered. \"He has bad taste in movies.\" Glancing beside me, I was startled to see Julia with her head down on her desk while she shook with silent laughter. \"What?\"\n \"That,\" she gasped. \"That was hilarious.\"\n \"What?\" I said again. \"Why?\"\n \"Sydney, he was asking you out!\"\n I replayed the conversation. \"No, he wasn\u0027t. He was asking me about cinema.\"\n She was laughing so hard that she had to wipe away a tear. \"So he could find out what you wanted to see and take you out!\"\n \"Well, why didn\u0027t he just say that?\"\n \"You are so adorably oblivious,\" she said. \"I hope I\u0027m around the day you actually notice someone is interested in you.\" I continued to be mystified, and she spent the rest of class bursting out with spontaneous giggles.\n While I became an object of fascination, Jill\u0027s popularity fell. Part of it was her own shyness. She was still so conscious and worried about being different that she assumed everyone else was aware of her otherness too. She continued holding back from connecting with people out of fear, making her come across as aloof. Surprisingly making this worse, Jill\u0027s \"doctor\u0027s note\" had finally come through from the Alchemists. The school wouldn\u0027t put her into a different elective that was already in progress. Freshmen weren\u0027t allowed to be teacher\u0027s aides like Trey. After consultation with Miss Carson, they\u0027d finally decided that Jill would participate in all indoor PE activities and do \"alternate assignments\" when we were outdoors. This usually meant writing reports on things like the history of softball. Unfortunately, sitting out half the time only managed to isolate Jill more.\n Micah continued to dote on her, even in the face of adversity.\n \"Lee texted me this morning,\" she told me at lunch one day. \"He wants to take me out to dinner this weekend. Do you think... I mean, I know you guys would have to go too...\" She glanced uncertainly between Eddie and me.\n \"Who\u0027s Lee?\" asked Micah. He had just sat down with our group.\n A few moments of awkward silence fell. \"Oh,\" said Jill, averting her eyes. \"He\u0027s this, um, guy we know. He doesn\u0027t go here. He goes to college. In Los Angeles.\"\n Micah processed this. \"He asked you on a date?\"\n \"Yeah... we actually went out before. I guess we\u0027re, well, kind of dating.\"\n \"Not seriously,\" piped in Eddie. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was saying this to spare Micah\u0027s feelings or if it was some protective way to stop Jill from getting too close to anyone.\n Micah was good at hiding his emotions, I\u0027d give him that. After a bit more thought, he finally gave Jill a smile that only seemed slightly forced. \"Well, that\u0027s great. I hope I can meet him.\" After that, the conversation turned to the upcoming football game, and no one mentioned Lee again.\n Finding out about Lee changed how Micah acted around Jill, but he still hung out with us all the time. Maybe it was in the hopes that Lee and Jill would break up. Or it could\u0027ve simply been because Micah and Eddie spent a lot of time together, and Eddie was one of Jill\u0027s few friends. But the problem wasn\u0027t Micah. It was Laurel.\n I didn\u0027t think Micah would\u0027ve been interested in Laurel even if Jill hadn\u0027t been in the picture, but Laurel still saw Jill as a threat - and went out of her way to make her miserable. Laurel spread rumors about her and made pointed comments in the halls and during class about Jill\u0027s pale skin, height, and skinniness - Jill\u0027s biggest insecurities.\n Once or twice, I heard the name vampire girl whispered in the halls. It made my blood run cold, no matter how many times I reminded myself it was a joke.\n \"Jill isn\u0027t what\u0027s keeping Laurel and Micah apart,\" I remarked to Julia and Kristin one day. They were amused by my continued efforts to apply logic and rationality to social behaviors in the school. \"I don\u0027t understand. He just doesn\u0027t like Laurel.\"\n \"Yeah, but it\u0027s easier for her to think Jill\u0027s the problem, when really, Laurel\u0027s just a bitch and Micah knows it,\" explained Julia. Ever since the awkward encounter with Bryan, she and Kristin had taken it upon themselves to try to educate me in the ways \"normal\" humans behaved.\n \"Plus, Laurel just likes having someone to pick on,\" said Kristin. She rarely spoke about the tattoo but had been serious and sober ever since. \"Okay,\" I said, trying to follow the logic, \"but I was the one who called her out about dying her hair. She\u0027s hardly said a word to me.\"\n Kristin smiled. \"No fun picking on you. You talk back. Jill doesn\u0027t defend herself much and doesn\u0027t have many people to stick up for her either. She\u0027s an easy target.\"\n One positive thing did happen, at least. Adrian was staying on good behavior after the Los Angeles mishap, though I had to wonder how long it would last. Based on what I gathered from Jill, he was still bored and unhappy. Lee\u0027s schedule was erratic, and it wasn\u0027t his job to look after Adrian anyway. There didn\u0027t seem to be any good solution for her, really. If Adrian gave in to his vices, she suffered the effects of his hangovers and \"romantic interludes.\" If he didn\u0027t, then he was miserable, and that attitude slowly trickled into her as well. The only hope they had was that Jill would eventually learn the control to block him out of her mind, but from what Rose had told her, that could take a very long time.\n When the next feeding came around, I was disappointed to see Keith\u0027s car parked in Clarence\u0027s driveway. If he wasn\u0027t going to actually do anything active to help this assignment, I kind of wished he\u0027d just stay away from it altogether. He apparently thought these \"supervising\" visits counted as work and continued to justify his presence. Except when we met up with Adrian in the living room, Keith was nowhere in sight. Neither was Clarence.\n \"Where are they?\" I asked Adrian.\n Adrian was lounging on the couch and put down a book he\u0027d been reading. I had a feeling reading was a rare activity for him and almost felt bad for the interruption. He stifled a yawn. There was no alcohol in sight, but I did see what looked like three empty cans of energy drink.\n He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. Off talking somewhere. Your friend\u0027s got a sick sense of humor. I think he\u0027s feeding Clarence\u0027s paranoia about vampire hunters.\"\n I glanced uneasily at Lee, who had immediately begun talking to Jill. Both were so caught up in each other, they didn\u0027t even realize what the rest of us were discussing. I knew how much the vampire hunter talk bothered Lee. He wouldn\u0027t appreciate Keith encouraging it.\n \"Does Clarence know about the killing in LA?\" asked Eddie. There was no reason Keith wouldn\u0027t, since it was open Alchemist knowledge, but I wasn\u0027t sure if he would\u0027ve made the connection to Clarence or not.\n \"He hasn\u0027t mentioned it,\" said Adrian. \"I swear Keith\u0027s just doing it because he\u0027s bored or something. Even I haven\u0027t sunk that low.\"\n \"Is that what you\u0027ve been doing instead?\" I asked. I sat down across from him and pointed at the energy drinks.\n \"Hey, it\u0027s not vodka or brandy or... well, anything good.\" Adrian sighed and upended one can, drinking the last few drops. \"So give me some credit.\" Eddie glanced at the cans. \"Didn\u0027t Jill say she had trouble sleeping last night?\"\n \"Adrian,\" I said with a groan. Eddie was right. I\u0027d noticed Jill tossing and turning constantly. Vicarious caffeine would certainly explain it. \"Hey, I\u0027m trying,\" Adrian said. \"If you could get me out of here, Sage, then I wouldn\u0027t be forced to drown my sorrows in taurine and ginseng.\"\n \"She can\u0027t, Adrian, and you know it,\" said Eddie. \"Can\u0027t you... I don\u0027t know. Find a hobby or something?\"\n \"Being charming is my hobby,\" said Adrian obstinately. \"I\u0027m the life of a party - even without drinking. I wasn\u0027t meant to be alone.\"\n \"You could get a job,\" said Eddie, settling into a corner chair. He smiled, amused by his own wit. \"Solve both your problems - make some money and be around people.\"\n Adrian scowled. \"Careful, Castile. There\u0027s only one comedian in this family.\"\n I straightened up. \"That\u0027s actually not a bad idea.\"\n \"It\u0027s a terrible idea,\" said Adrian, glancing between me and Eddie.\n \"Why?\" I asked. \"Is this the part where you tell us your hands don\u0027t do manual labor?\"\n \"It\u0027s more like the part where I don\u0027t have anything to offer society,\" he countered.\n \"I could help you,\" I offered.\n \"Are you going to do the work and give me the paycheck?\" Adrian asked hopefully. \"Because that actually could help.\"\n \"I can give you a ride to your interviews,\" I said. \"And I can make you a resume that would get you any job.\" I eyed him and reconsidered. \"Well, within reason.\"\n Adrian stretched back out. \"Sorry, Sage. Just not feeling it.\"\n Clarence and Keith entered just then. Clarence\u0027s face was exuberant. \"Thank you, thank you,\" he was saying. \"It\u0027s so nice to talk to someone who understands my concerns about the hunters.\"\n I hadn\u0027t been aware that Keith understood anything except his own self-serving nature. Lee\u0027s face darkened when he realized Keith was furthering the old man\u0027s irrationality. Nonetheless, the Moroi withheld the comments he undoubtedly wanted to make. It was the first time I\u0027d seen any sort of dark emotion on Lee\u0027s face. Looked like Keith could bring down even the most cheerful person.\n Clarence was happy to see us, as was Dorothy. Humans who gave blood to vampires weren\u0027t just disgusting because of the act itself. What was also appalling was the addiction that resulted. Vampires released endorphins into those they drank from, endorphins that created a pleasurable sort of high. Human feeders who lived among Moroi spent their entire days in that high, becoming heavily dependent on it. Someone like Dorothy, who had lived only with Clarence for years, hadn\u0027t experienced enough bites to really get addicted. Now, with Jill and Adrian around, Dorothy was getting an increased amount of endorphins in her daily life. Her eyes lit up when she saw Jill, showing she was eager for more.\n \"Hey, Sage,\" said Adrian. \"I don\u0027t want an interview, but do you think you could give me a ride to get some cigarettes?\"\n I started to tell him I wasn\u0027t going to help with such a filthy habit and then noticed him looking meaningfully at Dorothy. Was he trying to get me out of here? I wondered. Give me an excuse to not be around for the feeding? From what I understood, Moroi normally didn\u0027t hide their feedings from each other. Jill and Dorothy just usually left the room for my comfort. I knew they\u0027d probably do it again but decided I\u0027d take the opportunity to get away. Of course, I glanced at Keith for confirmation, expecting him to protest. He merely shrugged. It looked like I was the last thing on his mind.\n \"Okay,\" I said, standing up. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n In the car, Adrian turned to me.\n \"I changed my mind,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll take you up on helping me get a job.\"\n I almost swerved into oncoming traffic. Few things from him could have surprised me more - and he said pretty surprising things on a regular basis.\n \"That was fast. Are you serious?\"\n \"As much as I ever am. Will you still help me?\"\n \"I suppose so, though there\u0027s only so much I can do. I can\u0027t actually get you the job.\" I ran down my mental list of what I knew about Adrian. \"I don\u0027t suppose you have any idea of what you\u0027d actually like to do?\"\n \"I want something entertaining,\" he said. He thought some more. \"And I want to make lots of money - but do as little work as possible.\"\n \"Lovely,\" I muttered. \"That narrows it down.\"\n We reached downtown, and I managed a flawless parallel-parking job that didn\u0027t impress him nearly as much as it should have. We were right in front of a convenience store, and I stood outside while he went in. Evening shadows were falling. I was off campus all the time, but so far, my trips had all been to Clarence\u0027s, mini-golf courses, and fast-food joints. It turned out that the city of Palm Springs was really pretty. Boutiques and restaurants lined the streets, and I could\u0027ve spent hours people-watching. Retirees in golfing getups strolled alongside young glamorous socialites. I knew a lot of celebrities came here too, but I wasn\u0027t in tune enough with the entertainment world to know who was who.\n \"Man,\" said Adrian, emerging from the store. \"They raised the price on my normal brand. I had to buy some crappy one.\"\n \"You know,\" I said. \"Quitting would also be a really great way to save some - \"\n I froze as I spotted something down the street. Three blocks away, through the leaves of some palm trees, I could just barely make out a sign that read Nevermore in ornate Gothic lettering. That was the place. The source of the tattoos running rampant through Amberwood. Ever since Kristin\u0027s incident, I\u0027d wanted to delve into this more but hadn\u0027t been sure how. Now I had my chance.\n For a moment, I remembered Keith telling me not to get involved with anything that might raise attention or cause trouble. Then I thought about the way Kristin had looked during her overdose. This was my opportunity to actually do something. I made a decision.\n \"Adrian,\" I said. \"I need your help.\"\n I pulled him toward the tattoo parlor, filling him in on the situation. For a moment, he seemed so interested in high-inducing tattoos that I thought he\u0027d want one. When I told him about Kristin, though, his enthusiasm faded.\n \"Even if it\u0027s not Alchemist technology, they\u0027re still doing something dangerous,\" I explained. \"Not just to Kristin. What Slade and those guys are doing - using the steroids to be better at football - is just as bad. People are getting hurt.\" I thought, suddenly, of Trey\u0027s cuts and bruises.\n A small alley separated the tattoo parlor from a neighboring restaurant, and we stopped just before it. A door opened inside the alley, on the parlor side, and a man stepped out and lit a cigarette. He\u0027d taken only two steps when another man stuck his head out the side door and called, \"How long are you going to be gone?\" I could see shelves and tables behind him.\n \"Just running down to the store,\" said the man with the cigarette. \"I\u0027ll be back in ten.\"\n The other guy went back inside, shutting the door. A few moments later, we saw him through the window at the front of the store, tidying up something on the counter.\n \"I have to get back there,\" I said to Adrian. \"Into that door.\"\n He arched an eyebrow. \"What, like sneaking in? How very black ops of you. And oh, you know - dangerous and foolish.\"\n \"I know,\" I said, surprised at how calm I sounded as I admitted that. \"But I have to know something, and this may be my only chance.\"\n \"Then I\u0027ll go with you in case that guy comes back,\" he said with a sigh. \"Never let it be said Adrian Ivashkov doesn\u0027t help damsels in distress. Besides, did you see him? He looked like some insane biker. They both did.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want you to - wait.\" Inspiration hit. \"You talk to the guy inside.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Go in the front. Distract him so that I can look around. Talk to him about... I don\u0027t know. You\u0027ll think of something.\"\n We quickly hashed out a plan. I sent Adrian on his way while I ducked into the alley and approached the door. I pulled the handle and found it - locked. \"Of course,\" I muttered. What business would leave a remote door like this exposed and unlocked? My brilliant plan started to crumble until I remembered I had my Alchemist \"essentials\" in my purse.\n My full kit was rarely needed, high school acne crises aside, so it was usually kept at home. But Alchemists were always on call, no matter where they were, to cover up vampire sightings. And so, we always kept a couple of things on us at all times. One was the substance that could dissolve a Strigoi body in under a minute. The other was almost equally efficient at dissolving metal.\n It was a type of acid, and I kept it in a protected vial in my purse. Quickly, I fished it out and unscrewed the top. A bitter scent hit me and made me wrinkle my nose. With the bottle\u0027s glass dropper, I very carefully leaned down and placed a few drops right in the center of the lock. I immediately stepped back as a white mist rose up from the contact. Within thirty seconds, it had all dissipated, and there was a hole in the middle of the door\u0027s handle. One of the nice things about this stuff, which we called quickfire, was that its reaction occurred extremely fast. It was now inert and posed no danger to my skin. I pushed down on the handle, and it released.\n I only opened the door a crack, just to ascertain that there was no one else around. Nope. Empty. I crept inside and quietly shut the door behind me, fastening an inside bolt to make sure it stayed locked. As I\u0027d seen from the outside, the place was a storage room, filled with all sorts of tools of the tattoo trade. Three doorways surrounded me. One led to a bathroom, one to a darkened room, and another to the store\u0027s front and main counter. Light spilled in from that doorway, and I could hear Adrian\u0027s voice.\n \"My friend\u0027s got one,\" he was saying. \"I\u0027ve seen it, and he said this is the place he got it. Come on, don\u0027t play me.\"\n \"Sorry,\" came the gruff response. \"No idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n I slowly began scanning the cupboards and drawers, reading labels and looking for anything suspicious. There were a lot of supplies and not much time.\n \"Is it a money thing?\" asked Adrian. \"Because I\u0027ve got enough. Just tell me how much it costs.\"\n There was a long pause, and I hoped Adrian wouldn\u0027t be asked to show any cash since the last of his money had gone to promoting cancer.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" the guy said at last. \"If I was able to do this copper tattoo you\u0027re talking about - and I\u0027m not saying I can - you probably couldn\u0027t afford it.\"\n \"I\u0027m telling you,\" said Adrian. \"Just name your price.\"\n \"What is it you\u0027re interested in exactly?\" the man asked slowly. \"Just the color?\"\n \"I think we both know,\" said Adrian cunningly. \"I want the color. I want the \u0027bonus effects.\u0027 And I want it to look badass. You probably can\u0027t even do the design I want.\"\n \"That\u0027s the least of your worries,\" said the guy. \"I\u0027ve been doing this for years. I can draw anything you want.\"\n \"Yeah? Can you draw a skeleton riding a motorcycle with flames coming out of it? And I want a pirate hat on the skeleton. And a parrot on his shoulder. A skeleton parrot. Or maybe a ninja skeleton parrot? No, that would be overkill. But it\u0027d be cool if the biker skeleton could be shooting some ninja throwing stars. That are on fire.\"\n Meanwhile, I\u0027d still seen no sign of what I needed, but there were a million nooks and crannies left to explore. Panic began to rise in me. I was going to run out of time. Then, seeing the darkened room, I hurried over to it. With a quick glance toward the store\u0027s front, I flipped on the light and held my breath. No one must have noticed anything because the conversation continued where it had left off.\n \"That\u0027s the most ridiculous thing I\u0027ve ever heard,\" said the tattooist.\n \"That\u0027s not what the ladies are going to say,\" said Adrian.\n \"Look, kid,\" said the guy. \"It\u0027s not even about money. It\u0027s about availability. That\u0027s a lot of ink you\u0027re talking about, and I don\u0027t have that much in stock.\"\n \"Well, when will your supplier deliver next?\" asked Adrian.\n I stared in awe at what I had found: I was in the room where the tattooing took place. There was a lounging chair - much more comfortable than the table I\u0027d received my tattoo on - and a small side table covered with what appeared to be freshly used implements.\n \"I\u0027ve already got some people wait-listed ahead of you. I don\u0027t know when there\u0027ll be more.\"\n \"Can you call me when you know?\" Adrian asked. \"I\u0027ll give you my info. My name\u0027s Jet Steele.\"\n If not for my own tense situation, I would\u0027ve groaned. Jet Steele? Really? Before I could think much more about it, I finally found what I\u0027d been looking for. The tattoo gun on the table had its own ink container, but sitting nearby were several smaller vials. All of them were empty, but some still had enough metallic residue of their former ingredients to tip me off. Without even thinking twice, I quickly began recapping them and putting them in my purse. Nearby, I noticed some sealed vials full of dark liquid. I froze for a moment. Carefully, I picked one up, opened it, and took a sniff.\n It was what I\u0027d feared.\n I screwed the lid back on and added those vials to my purse.\n Just then, I heard a rattling behind me. Someone was trying to open the back door. I\u0027d bolted it behind me, however, and it didn\u0027t give. Still, it meant my time for snooping was up. I was just zipping up my purse when I heard the store\u0027s front door open.\n \"Joey, why\u0027s the back door locked?\" an angry voice demanded.\n \"It\u0027s always locked.\"\n \"No, the bolt was on. From the inside. It wasn\u0027t when I left.\"\n Cue my exit. I flipped off the light and began hurrying back through the storage room.\n \"Wait!\" exclaimed Adrian. There was an anxious note to his voice, like he was trying to get someone\u0027s attention. I had the uneasy feeling that the two guys who worked here were headed back behind the counter to investigate. \"I need to know something else about the tattoo. Can the parrot also be wearing a pirate\u0027s hat? Like a miniature one?\"\n \"In a minute. We have to check something.\" The voice was louder than before. Closer.\n My hands fumbled as I unlatched the bolt. I managed it and opened the door, hurrying out just as I heard voices behind me. Without pausing to glance back, I shut the door and ran out the alley and up the street, back toward where I\u0027d parked. I was pretty sure the guys hadn\u0027t gotten a good look at me. I think I\u0027d just been a figure darting out the door. Still, I was grateful for the crowds of people on the street. I was able to blend in as I turned my attention to my car and unlocked the door. My hands were sweaty and shaking as I fumbled with the keys.\n I wanted badly to look behind me but was afraid of attracting the attention of the two men, if they were out searching the street. As long as they had no reason to suspect me -\n A hand suddenly grabbed my arm and jerked me away. I gasped.\n \"It\u0027s me,\" said a voice.\n Adrian. I breathed a sigh of relief.\n \"Don\u0027t look back,\" he said calmly. \"Just get in the car.\"\n I obeyed. Once we were both safely inside, I took a deep breath, overwhelmed by the pounding of my heart. Fear-born adrenaline surged in my chest, so strongly it hurt. I closed my eyes and leaned back.\n \"That was too close,\" I said. \"And you did good, by the way.\"\n \"I know,\" he said proudly. \"And actually, I kind of want that tattoo now. Did you find what you were looking for?\"\n I opened my eyes and sighed. \"I did. And a whole lot more.\"\n \"So, what is it? They\u0027re putting drugs in tattoos?\"\n \"Worse,\" I said. \"They\u0027re using vampire blood.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-16.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
