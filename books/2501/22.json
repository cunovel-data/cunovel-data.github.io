{"id":106528,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Rain seethed down on Sarai, washing the fine sand out of the air and leaving the streets streaked with grit that made the paving stones slippery; the first storm of winter had arrived with exuberant ferocity. The wind rioted among the buildings, sending unlatched shutters and loose roofing planks flying; with insistent, cacophonous fingers, it tugged at the oiled-parchment windows, snatching a few from the security of their frames and sending them careening. Anyone venturing out of doors was shoved and buffeted along while being drenched, which accounted for the bedraggled appearance Thetis Krisanthemenis presented when she came to Ragoczy Franciscus\u0027 hired house at the height of the storm. She had attempted to protect herself with a vast woolen talaris with only a single, small tablion inserted in the front, but it was soaked through, her dark-blond hair dripping steadily, serving to give her an appearance of waiflike hopelessness. She lowered her head apologetically, preparing to explain her errand, and struggled to find the words she needed to engage the occupant\u0027s sympathy. Her shivering was completely authentic, although her demeanor was a bit forced. Rojeh came to the door to answer her third pull on the bell. \"Neighbor Krisanthemenis,\" he exclaimed in Byzantine Greek. \"What is so urgent that you come out in such weather?\" \"I fear I come to ask a favor.\" She stepped into the shelter of the inner court, under the broad eaves; she twisted the long cuff of the talaris\u0027 sleeve, then spoke in a rush. \"Actually, it\u0027s more than that: I have to ask for your help. It is not something I can take to the Master of Foreigners myself, at least not now.\" She faltered, then went gamely on, \"You see, a portion of my roof has been blown away by this storm, and I and my children are in need of shelter.\" \"What a terrible thing,\" said Rojeh sympathetically. \"Come in, and tell me what my master and I may do.\" \"We cannot stay in our house, not with half the rooms ruined, and our belongings.\" She took a deep breath. \"We have to leave the house, and we must have a safe place to go.\" She said this last more bluntly than she had intended. \"I don\u0027t mean to be brusque, but I am nearly beside myself with worry. I am afraid we are in a most precarious situation: with my husband dead, there is very little I can do to tend to the house without Emrach Sarai\u0027af\u0027s approval, and he is not going to extend himself while the storm is blowing. But my need is present-it is immediate-and I cannot pretend that the loss of the roof is only an inconvenience.\" She shook her head as if suddenly bereft of strength. \"We can work, do household chores, if your master requires it.\" \"You may discuss that with him, when you know more about what you may do for your home,\" said Rojeh, certain that Ragoczy Franciscus would never make servants of this woman or her children. \"I wish I could be permitted to make my own arrangements for the house, as my husband would do if he were still alive.\" She pressed her lips together, then went on, \"It is much the same for widows in Constantinople, but at least there my brother could supervise our needs.\" \"We are not your relatives,\" Rojeh pointed out. \"Emrach might not permit us to do more than shelter you until your house is sound.\" Thetis flung up her hand. \"For now, that is enough.\" Rojeh stared at the raging rain and the flotsam on the wind and listened to the hiss and howl. \"Then, if it suits you, I will send our houseman and our man-of-all-work to bring your children and such goods as you need into this house,\" he said, making up his mind. \"And your master? What will he say?\" Thetis glanced about uneasily, as if she expected to be disappointed. \"He is with the Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an just now and will likely remain there until the rain has passed,\" said Rojeh, knowing what agony running water could be to Ragoczy Franciscus; he hoped his master would spend the storm in that stupor that masqueraded for sleep, safe in one of the Desert Cats\u0027 tents. \"He is out of the town?\" Thetis seemed shocked. \"Yes. The clan he is visiting has had many troubles with their ponies, and he has gone to help them as much as he can.\" His austere features revealed little, but his faded-blue eyes were worried. \"If you will come into the house?\" She sneezed. \"Oh. Yes. Thank you.\" He indicated the door to the reception room. \"You will find an upholstered bench and a table. The lamps are already burning. I will have some mint tea sent in to you.\" Fortunately, mint was hardy enough to still be available, and Dasur Shiraz\u0027af, the Persian cook, used it frequently in the five-person household. She looked startled. \"Mint tea? Hot tea, with honey? Yes, if you would.\" \"I will instruct the cook,\" said Rojeh, and left Thetis in the reception room. He decided he would ask Aethalric, the houseman, to build up a fire for her-in those wet clothes she could easily become chilled, and the chill could bring aches and sickness. Both the Persian and the Goth were in the kitchen, huddled in front of the great, open hearth where a single lamb\u0027s carcass turned on a huge spit intended for oxen, and both men looked about guiltily as they heard Rojeh enter the echoing chamber. Dasur scrambled to his feet and reached for another log, thrusting it into the burning stack in the huge fireplace. \"I will begin the afternoon meal shortly,\" Dasur said as if he had only just become aware of Rojeh. \"I have another task for you,\" said Rojeh calmly. \"For both of you, and for Chtavo, as well.\" \"He\u0027s in the stables, cleaning tack,\" said Aethalric. \"Then he won\u0027t mind having to stop awhile; the stable is drafty as a tree, and as damp as sitting under one,\" said Rojeh. \"You, Aethalric, are to build up the fire in the reception room, where you will find our neighbor, and then you and Chtavo are to take the covered handcart and go to her house. You are to gather such items as clothing and personal possessions as they might need and bring those things, and her children, to this house. Take blankets of oiled muslin with you, to protect you from the storm.\" He paid no attention to the incredulous stares of the two men, but went on, \"Dasur, if you will make a good portion of mint tea with honey, and provide whatever we have in the way of breads for the widow and her children?\" Aethalric stared in astonishment. \"Why should we have those Byzantines with us?\" \"Because, as I understand it, their house is damaged, and they are in need of a place to stay while it is repaired. You cannot expect her to remain there with the storm still at full cry, not if there is no shelter to be had.\" Rojeh gave both men a hard glance. \"Not that it is for you to question such a decision.\" \"It may not be,\" said Dasur, \"but it is not the usual thing.\" \"This storm is not the usual thing, either, from what I have heard,\" Rojeh observed. \"Nothing in the last\"-he calculated the length of time since he and Ragoczy Franciscus had left Yang-Chau-\"nearly two years has been.\" \"You may think this excuses what you do, but it may not,\" Aethalric warned. \"It is dangerous to take strangers into the house.\" Rojeh regarded him in silence, then said, \"My master brought you into the household, and you both are strangers.\" \"The law provides that you cannot employ natives of Sarai,\" said Dasur. \"Even they are strangers to Ragoczy Franciscus and me,\" Rojeh observed. \"The times have made demands on all of us-this is no exception.\" Dasur added his own note of caution: \"Taking in a widow and her children, there will be talk.\" \"Particularly about the odd habits of foreigners.\" This remark of Rojeh\u0027s got the men\u0027s attention; Dasur went to fill a pot from the water barrel, and Aethalric started for the door. \"Let me know when you and Chtavo are back.\" \"All you will have to do is listen; children are never quiet, and you haven\u0027t special accommodations for them,\" replied Aethalric as he went out into the gushing rain toward the shed containing the household supply of wood. He came back with five cut logs in his embrace, two of which he shoved at Dasur before he headed up the stairs toward the reception room. \"Mint tea with honey?\" Dasur asked Rojeh as he hung the pot of water on a hook and pushed it over the fire. \"Enough for the women and her children?\" \"Yes. There are three still living, as I understand it,\" said Rojeh. \"I have seen the boy walking with his mother. He\u0027s about ten or eleven, by the look of him.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Dasur. \"He is a well-mannered youth, reserved and trying to be grown-up, now his father is dead.\" He retrieved a large, metal, spouted pot from the utensil shelf, set it on the trestle table in the center of the room, then went to his spice chest to take out a handful of dried mint leaves; these he put into the pot, then went to the pantry to get the honeycomb. As he brought back the sticky box containing it, he said to Rojeh, his face showing disapproval, \"Take care that the widow does not take greater advantage of your hospitality.\" He acknowledged Rojeh\u0027s nod as he set about pouring off a generous portion of honey into the spouted pot. \"When it is ready, I will bring it. A pity we have no dried figs or dates, but no one has had any for well over a year.\" \"They will probably return, in time,\" said Rojeh, and went to the rear door to secure it against the blustering wind. \"May you prove right,\" said Dasur as he returned to the pantry. \"I haven\u0027t much in the way of breads, just a few sesame cakes I made this morning, with a bit of chopped egg to garnish them. And I have an oil-loaf with a few raisins. I can cut some of that, if you think it will do.\" \"Both sound adequate.\" Rojeh wanted to add that at other times such spartan fare would seem the height of inhospitality, but in these days, this bordered on lavish. \"Put them on a tray and bring them up when the tea is ready.\" \"I will,\" said Dasur, going to choose a platter for the food and cups for the tea. Rojeh returned to the reception room and found Thetis huddled next to the fire, her talaris tented about her to make the most of the heat from the blazing logs. \"I could get a blanket for you, if you like,\" he said as he came a few steps into the room. She managed not to jump, although she was startled. \"I am sorry,\" she said, moving back from the fire. \"Your man brought more wood, and I was making the most of it. The warmth is so ...\" \"You needn\u0027t move on my account; take all the advantage you can of the fire,\" said Rojeh, choosing a chair some distance from the hearth for his seat. \"I\u0027ve sent two servants to fetch your children and your clothes from your house. When they arrive, you may have this room to yourselves until chambers may be prepared for you.\" \"I have two servants,\" said Thetis. She scowled briefly. \"When my husband was alive, we had two more, but they were provided manumission in his Will.\" Her voice became more peevish. \"In such times as these, you\u0027d think we could offer work to one of those many unfortunates who are native to this town, just so they have lodging and food, but the Master of Foreigners still refuses to allow it.\" \"It is their tradition,\" said Rojeh. \"Tell me about your servants?\" \"Sinu is a Hun; she maintains the house and does our cooking. All other work is done by Herakles, whom my husband brought with him from Constantinople. He is getting on now and suffers from stiffness, but I promised Eleutherios that I would keep him with us as long as he wished to remain.\" She did her best to produce a brave smile, but she could not sustain it, and so she looked away from Rojeh. \"It is bad enough I have to ask shelter for me and my children. It is inexcusable to ask for my servants as well.\" \"Servants are as much famiglia as any child,\" said Rojeh, deliberately using the old Roman word for household. \"If your Sinu is willing to sleep in the same room with your daughters, there should be no trouble.\" Thetis looked about in confusion. \"I suppose ... I think my girls would agree.\" \"Very good. In a household such as this one, where only males have been permitted, keeping females together will lessen any comments that might be to your detriment.\" Rojeh stopped as something clattered into the courtyard. \"I had better see what that was,\" he said, rising and reverencing Thetis. \"I hope I have caused you no difficulty with your employer,\" she said as if suddenly recalling her manners. \"You and your children, and your servants, have nothing to fear,\" said Rojeh, and left her to the heat of the fire while he went out to check on the small courtyard. A wooden plank with a long break in the grain lay by the gate to the stable-yard. Rojeh picked it up and moved it under the eaves; he squinted up at the sky, noticing that the afternoon was growing darker. He made a quick calculation and decided that it was growing late in the afternoon, which meant to him that the storm might last into the night. His thoughts turned to Ragoczy Franciscus with the Desert Cats, and his concern increased, for with such heavy rain, the low-lying islands could well be swamped, which would be horribly debilitating to the vampire. A rattle of wheels on paving stones barely penetrated the roar of the storm, but it alerted Rojeh to the arrival of Aethalric and Chtavo with Thetis\u0027 children and servants, and he went to admit them to the courtyard, handing the Goth and the Volgaman a copper coin each for their service. Pentefilia, the older daughter, had disdained riding in the cart; she walked ahead of the sodden household, her talaris gathered around her like a shroud; if she was aware of the storm, she was determined to ignore it. She hardly glanced at Rojeh as they started toward the main door of the house, as if acknowledging him would end what little dignity she had left. Aristion, her brother, came down from the cart with alacrity, a small box of his possessions clutched to his chest, his face set with concentration as he looked around him. He squinted anxiously toward the roof, as if to be certain it was intact. Next the Hunnic servant Sinu climbed down from the covered interior of the cart, then turned to lift out Hrisoula, the youngest child, who was doing her best not to cry; she burrowed her head into Sinu\u0027s shoulder, muffling her whimpers with her fist, allowing the squat-bodied Hun to protect her with a flap of her rough-woven cloak. Heraldes brought up the rear, his rolling gait revealing the pain of a stiff hip. \"I am taking the cart to the stable,\" said Chtavo to Rojeh. \"I\u0027ll bring in their cases later.\" \"Just so they have them tonight,\" said Rojeh, knowing the Volgaman rarely bothered with the convenience of others. \"I will tell you which rooms they are assigned when you come in for your evening meal.\" Chtavo shrugged. \"As you like.\" He hefted the double handles of the cart and lugged it away. Dasur was just climbing the steps from the kitchen as Rojeh came into the vestibule to direct the new arrivals to the reception room. After Dasur set his burden down on the table there, he reached for the spouted pot, saying, \"Mint tea with honey,\" before he selected a cup and poured the steaming liquid into it. \"I have fare for your servants in the kitchen.\" Thetis had risen to greet her children, but now she regarded Dasur with anticipation. \"This is wonderful. So much better than the millet-cakes we have been eating of late.\" She looked toward Rojeh. \"Will your master mind that you have given us so much?\" \"If he does, it will be most unlike him,\" Rojeh said. Thetis took up her cup of tea, letting the heat warm her hands. \"This smells wonderful,\" she said to Rojeh. \"Then it is Dasur you should thank. All I did was tell him to prepare it.\" He nodded toward the Persian cook. Dasur was busy filling cups for the three children, but he stopped his efforts to say, \"I am glad it pleases you.\" \"And the cakes look delicious,\" Thetis added, this time speaking directly to Dasur, who nodded, suddenly speechless, and went back to pouring tea. As she carried Hrisoula into the reception room, Sinu was embarrassed to have intruded so far into the house. She muttered something to Thetis as she set the frightened little girl down on the upholstered bench, then said to Dasur, \"Where shall I go?\" \"To the kitchen,\" said Dasur. \"Wait a moment and I\u0027ll show you the way.\" He took a last look around the room, and satisfied with what he had done, he spoke to Rojeh. \"I will feed these two with the rest of us.\" His gesture took in both Sinu and Herakles. \"Very good,\" said Rojeh. \"I will call upon you later, but for now, give yourself a little rest.\" Dasur motioned to Herakles and Sinu to follow him; they trooped off toward the lower level of the house and the kitchen. The two older children had taken cups of tea and wedges of cakes and were settling down to eat, Pentefilia near the fireplace, Aristion near the central table. Only Hrisoula remained huddled where Sinu had put her, her eyes enormous, her face pale; Rojeh went to the youngest child and sat down at the other end of the bench. \"Don\u0027t you like oil-loaf? I could bring you a bit of it, if you like.\" Hrisoula stared at him in silence, then slowly nodded her head once. In response to this sign, Rojeh got up and went to the table and broke off a small portion of oil-loaf, then picked up the last unclaimed cup of tea. \"Here you are,\" he said, offering the child the oil-loaf. \"And some tea to wash it down.\" He went back to his place at the far end of the bench. \"Storms like this don\u0027t happen very often.\" He had intended this to reassure Hrisoula, but it was Pentefilia who spoke. \"I know. I\u0027m fourteen, and I can\u0027t remember anything like this for as long as I\u0027ve been alive.\" She took a large, defiant bite of her wedge of sesame-cake. \"Things like this didn\u0027t happen when my father was alive. There was no cold, there was enough food, and the town was busy,\" said Aristion suddenly. He had got up and gone to sit beside his mother, his full attention on the fire as he picked at his food. \"It must surely seem so,\" Rojeh agreed. He looked at the simple food on the table. \"In the past, my master would have been ashamed to have so little to offer you; he has long made a habit of having the best fare for his guests.\" \"I am sure this is the best he has,\" said Thetis, shooting a warning glance at her children. \"It\u0027s better than what we\u0027ve been eating,\" Pentefilia muttered. \"Pentefilia. Mind your tongue.\" Thetis turned to Rojeh. \"You said your master went to the Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an camp?\" she asked, then chewed a little of the oil-loaf. \"Yes. When we reached the Silk Road last year, we covered some of the distance with that clan. Since chance had brought us together again, my master is inclined to do his utmost to help these people. They have borne much travail-their leader was killed in a fall, along with his most senior men. The clan has been near starvation, and there has been illness among their numbers.\" \"What kind of thing does he do?\" Pentefilia asked, an imperious tilt to her chin. \"Pentefilia!\" her mother admonished her more sharply than before. \"It\u0027s all right,\" said Rojeh. He gazed at Thetis\u0027 oldest child, speaking calmly and with no indication of disrespect for her inquiry. \"My master has some skill with medicaments. The Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an have their own traditional treatments, but it seems these have failed. So my master has gone to see if he has any information gleaned in his travels that might serve to help the Desert Cats-for so the clan is called-treat their ponies.\" Pentefilia considered this and nodded slowly \"He is not above working in the rain and mud. That says he has humility. Patriarch Stavros says we all must strive for humility.\" \"He is the Patriarch of the Most Holy Dormition,\" Thetis explained. \"He advises the other two Byzantine churches here.\" She colored slightly. \"He is truly a godly man. I asked him if we might have shelter at the Most Holy Dormition, before I came here. Patriarch Stavros said he would have to refuse me because my husband is dead and I have no brother or father to vouch for me and my family, and Aristion is still too young to serve in that capacity.\" She reached out and put her hand on her son\u0027s head; Aristion winced. \"So you see, I didn\u0027t simply fling myself on you without thought.\" \"It would be all right if you had,\" said Rojeh. \"I will have to tell Patriarch Stavros where we are. I don\u0027t think he will entirely approve, particularly since you and your employer are not Orthodox Christians.\" This last made her uncomfortable to admit, and as soon as she had spoken, she turned away from him, ostensibly to straighten Aristion\u0027s paragaudion, but in fact to avoid Rojeh\u0027s scrutiny. \"It may be best to wait until the storm is over.\" He put his hand on the side of the spouted pot. \"The tea is still warm. Shall I pour you another cup?\" Flustered, she hesitated, then extended the cup. \"I would like that.\" As he poured the tea, Rojeh said, \"I gather you have had a difficult time since you were widowed.\" She shrugged impatiently. \"I have sent word to my brother, so that he will send for us, but conditions have been so harsh that I begin to fear that my message may not have arrived.\" \"It may be a wise precaution to send a second,\" said Rojeh, and began to explain the allocation of private rooms he had decided upon for their use. By the time Sinu reappeared with Aethalric to escort them to the upper floor, the tea was gone and all that was left of the oil-loaf and sesame cake were crumbs. Rojeh rose and reverenced Thetis. \"You may go to settle yourselves into your quarters. Aethalric, see that there are lamps in their rooms and provide them any bedding they may lack.\" \"Of course,\" said Aethalric, as if Ragoczy Franciscus entertained guests every day. \"If you will allow me to show you the way?\" he offered, and led the way toward the steep, narrow stairs. Rojeh went off to the pantry to determine how much more food he would need while Thetis, her children, and her servants were in the household. He found the cook finishing the last of his cleaning up following the evening meal. \"Tomorrow, if the storm is over, I want you to go to the butcher and secure meat for all the household for four days.\" Dasur laughed. \"That will be a very costly purchase.\" \"I realize that. I have sixteen silver pieces for you to spend.\" He held up the small leather purse. \"A goodly amount,\" said Dasur, recovering from his surprise. \"At least the butcher has some meat to sell,\" said Rojeh. \"There are many places-so I hear-where no sum could buy meat for there is none to be had.\" \"True enough,\" said Dasur, going somber. \"All right. Sixteen pieces of silver for meat.\" He thought about the amount. \"You know, for a few pieces more, you could buy a boat and fish.\" \"If my employer were planning to remain here, he might want to do that,\" said Rojeh, privately amused. \"But the Master of Foreigners has said he will extend our residency only once more, for three months, and then we must go on.\" \"That\u0027s unfortunate, for all of us,\" said Dasur. \"He will not leave you wholly without means,\" said Rojeh. \"How can you be sure of that?\" Dasur asked sharply. \"Because he has never done so in the past,\" said Rojeh, and left Dasur to his duties. Text of a letter from Eimonthoris of Hydros, Captain of the merchant-ship Demeter at Trebizond to Lucius Valentius Gnaeo at Brundisium; carried by the Byzantine courier ship Archangel Rafael and delivered in January of 537. Greetings to Lucius Valentius Gnaeo, factor at Brundisium, from Eimonthoris of Hydros, now, by Grace of God, lying in port at Trebizond. I have news that may make up for the delay in my sailing from this place, which I think now must have been the Will of God, for the one extra day we had to wait for repair of the rudder was enough to spare us the perils of the processions of wind and rain that have been visited upon us. Once the rain and wind began, I could not set out, and we have had three weeks of tempests. I am grateful to Saint Luke and Saint Spyridion for preserving us, for if we had sailed when we intended, surely we would have been lost. During this time of forced idleness, I have gone amongst the various warehouses and stalls of other merchants, and I believe I may have hit upon an opportunity that you will want to seize; with that in mind, I am giving you the first opportunity to hid on what I have purchased from the heirs of a Silk Road merchant who succumbed to Marsh Fever a month ago, shortly after his return from a three-year journey. Their rejoicing upon his triumphant return was soon turned to lamentation, for he became ill and died within a month of his reaching Trebizond. The family of Vermakrides has allowed me to purchase what must surely be the strangest item of trade I have ever seen. It has been displayed here, and for a modest charge, the people of the town could view it. I must tell you I have never seen the like of this item, not in all my travels. Nothing out of Africa can equal it but the tusks of elephants, and this is more remarkable than any of those: it is a huge bone, made of stone, and unlike anything I have found before. I am told Vermakrides had it from a merchant from Cathay, and that it was reputed to come from the body of a dragon, for what other creature could have a skeleton of stone? The bone is easily recognized as belonging to a leg that was longer than a man is tall, for this bone, stood on end, reaches almost to my shoulder and it is from the thigh of the monster It provides much occasion for speculation, as well as being a reminder that Creation has taken many forms. The supply of silk has diminished sadly, since fewer caravans are setting out from the distant East. There is so little food to be found along the way that most merchants are unwilling to take the risk of venturing into the wastes of the Silk Road. One report spoke of a walled town where more than half the inhahitants starved, and where foreigners were slaughtered for meals. Such desperation is present in this region, and if it is so widespread as these accounts would suggest, it is not surprising that no one is willing to undertake the hazards of such journeys. I have little more to offer you than this dragon bone, but I believe it may prove to be the most valuable thing I have ever encountered. I await your answer when I come to Brundisium. Pray that God gives us a safe passage and that no further harm comes to me or my crew.
