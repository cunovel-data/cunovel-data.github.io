{"id":106518,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"What do they call you in the West?-certainly not Zangi-Ragozh,\" said Dukkai as she stood in the alchemical chamber a week after the foreigner had arrived in Kumul. \"That must be what the Chinese call you.\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" said Zangi-Ragozh, looking up from the crock of moldy bread that stood on one end of the long table. He had donned his black silk sen-hsien and put his black shearling shuba over it, for the day was cold and the fire in the distant stove made little headway against the chill.\\n\\n \"What was the name you were given?\" She cocked her head. \"If you may tell me without offending your gods.\"\\n\\n \"My gods are long-forgotten by everyone but me,\" said Zangi-Ragozh with a wry, sad smile.\\n\\n \"Then why do you hesitate? I know you are hesitating.\" Dukkai moved out of the glare of brassy early-morning sunlight so that she could see Zangi-Ragozh more clearly.\\n\\n \"Yes, I am,\" he admitted, fiddling with the lid of the crock.\\n\\n \"Why? Is it because I am not of your clan?\" She obviously regarded that as a good reason to keep such information private.\\n\\n \"No, that is not the reason,\" he told her. \"I am not accustomed to revealing so much.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\" She nodded. \"But we will leave shortly, and then you will, as well, and even if we share the road for a fortnight or a year, once we part we may never meet again, so where would be the harm? Whom would I tell that could hurt you, or would even know who you are?\" She paced down the center of the room and came back to him.\\n\\n \"Why does it matter to you so much?\" Zangi-Ragozh asked her, puzzled by her persistence.\\n\\n \"It is a matter of trust and respect,\" she said after a reflective pause.\\n\\n \"That it is,\" he agreed.\\n\\n \"You have imparted much information to me, and to the Apostle, willingly and graciously, but you withhold this most intrinsic part of yourself, as if you seek to remain a stranger,\" she said. \"I am glad for the knowledge you are willing to share, but I know it has little importance to you. So I ask for a token of your respect, something that you esteem, to seal our friendship.\"\\n\\n \"I have given you an emerald,\" said Zangi-Ragozh; it had been among the first batch he had made four days ago. \"You said it was a pledge of mutual friendship.\"\\n\\n \"It is a beautiful stone, and a great treasure, but it is from you, not of you,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I grant you that,\" said Zangi-Ragozh, beginning to chafe; the first cordiality between them was already changing to something more profound, and more complex.\\n\\n \"You have been about the world a great deal-far more than I or anyone I know has been or ever will be. You have seen places whose names I have never heard, and you have walked roads leading beyond everything I have dreamed of,\" she said. \"Your homeland is far away, you tell me, and your people no longer live there. For their sake, let me know who you were to them so they will not be completely gone.\"\\n\\n \"They are gone,\" he said flatly. \"Many, many years ago.\"\\n\\n \"So you have told me,\" she said. \"It must make you very lonely, to be the last.\"\\n\\n \"Upon occasion,\" he said, resisting the rare pang of isolation that gripped him suddenly.\\n\\n \"Because I am a magician,\" she said. \"I have ways to ease the bonds that all carry.\"\\n\\n \"For your people. I am a foreigner, and your magic may not be mine, or accessible to one of my blood, no matter how generous your offer.\" He studied her broad, angular features, hoping to see an answer there that was as much a part of her answer as anything she might say.\\n\\n \"All the more reason to tell me,\" she persisted. \"It strengthens my magic without upsetting my clan.\"\\n\\n \"How does it do this?\" He fixed the lid on the crock.\\n\\n \"It gives me access to the heart of your being, and that provides illumination of an unearthly kind. I would cherish your name as I will treasure your emerald.\" She held out her hands to him.\\n\\n Zangi-Ragozh relented. \"My father was called Ragosh, so I am Ragosh-ski, my ... I suppose you would call it clan, or territory, name is Franzic, for the area where my father\u0027s kingdom lay; my personal name is Holy Jermen,\" he said, slurring the j a little. He was a bit surprised at himself for telling her so much.\\n\\n \"How complicated,\" she said. \"Are all men of the West so encumbered with names?\"\\n\\n \"Some are more complicated, most are less so,\" he said, glancing at the door.\\n\\n \"Why are you called Holy? Is that your name or a title? Are you an Apostle, too?\" She took his hands in hers, drawing him closer to her.\\n\\n \"No. I was called Holy because I was given to my gods.\"\\n\\n \"Your forgotten gods?\" Her fingers tightened before she released his hands.\\n\\n \"Yes. Those sons of the King born at the dark of the year, as I was, were given to the gods, to become one of their blood, and for that blood were called Holy.\" He felt some of his despondency lift as he said this, and it surprised him. \"Is Dukkai all your name?\"\\n\\n \"As a name goes, it is Dukkai of the Desert Cats Clan, daughter of Gobor the One-Eyed, and niece of the magician Tejamksa, who served the clan and taught me.\"\\n\\n \"Why is he called Gobor the One-Eyed?\" Zangi-Ragozh asked, considering what he had heard.\\n\\n \"He is called that because he is dead and there are many Gobors who have died. When I am dead, I will be Dukkai the Magician.\" She watched him inquisitively. \"Do not your people distinguish the dead?\"\\n\\n \"Not in that way,\" he said, and continued, \"Baru Ksoka has two names: is it because he is your leader?\"\\n\\n \"No. It is because he is his father\u0027s oldest son to have a child of his own. All those who are oldest sons who have a first child have second names. If the son with the name dies before he has a first grandson who is the first in the family, the second name passes to his widow.\" She saw his continuing interest. \"Because I am the clan\u0027s magician, I have a number of titles, but they are not names, and they are only used on sacred occasions.\" She took one of the chairs, slid it away from the wall, and dropped into it, shifting about on the wooden seat to make herself more comfortable.\\n\\n He moved the crock toward a large urn, one that would go into the athanor, the beehive-shaped alchemical oven standing at the far end of the chamber. \"This will be a sovereign remedy when it is done. I will prepare other things tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"More jewels?\" She folded her hands in her lap.\\n\\n \"Gold and silver,\" said Zangi-Ragozh.\\n\\n \"Can you make food instead?\"\\n\\n \"Sadly, no, I cannot make food.\" It was a troubling confession, and he gazed at the athanor to avoid her pale eyes.\\n\\n \"That is a pity,\" she said, preparing to rise, but sinking down once more as Zangi-Ragozh gave her his full attention. \"I have already informed Baru Ksoka that we will have difficulty in reaching Cambaluc this autumn, although we often travel there. All the signs are bad.\" She watched him, curious and wary.\\n\\n \"That is a goodly distance out of the usual Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an territory, I would have thought,\" he said, remembering the village that was more of a permanent caravan encampment on the northern branch of the Silk Road.\\n\\n \"For many clans it is, but ours is a small group, much smaller than most, and we have to travel more and farther in order to keep from battles for pasture with the larger clans. Especially now, when the Turks are restless and pasturage is scarce.\" She let him consider what she had said.\\n\\n Zangi-Ragozh contemplated her face. \"What area do you travel, then?\"\\n\\n \"We keep to the region between the rest of the Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an and the Uighurs, following the Tarim River.\"\\n\\n \"Are you expecting more trouble?\" He knew it was a foolish question.\\n\\n \"I am, as you would, were you in my place.\" She studied him, saying suddenly, \"I am pregnant with Baru Ksoka\u0027s child. I will give birth in the spring, if there is a spring.\"\\n\\n \"You are sure you are pregnant?\" He chose his words meticulously. \"Sometimes, when there are great hardships, a woman may not have her monthly courses. Could this be happening to you?\"\\n\\n \"It could, but it is not,\" she said with great conviction. \"Only the Kaigan is allowed to rut with me, and he has done so for more than a year. It is time that I bear him a child.\"\\n\\n He turned and regarded her somberly. \"Does he know, then?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly he knows,\" she said. \"He is the leader of the clan. He must be told such things.\"\\n\\n \"This is a hard time to have children,\" he said circumspectly.\\n\\n \"There is never an easy time to have children, not even for animals,\" she said bluntly. \"Yet it must be done.\"\\n\\n \"While I do not disagree,\" he said, \"I suppose that this coming year is going to be much harder than the last, and that the risks of pregnancy will increase as time goes by.\"\\n\\n \"Because there will be famine. I have contemplated what is to come, and it fills me with apprehension,\" she said, and caught her lower lip in her teeth.\\n\\n \"As it would any sensible woman,\" he said as a rush of compassion came over him. \"You are afraid you will not carry the child to term.\"\\n\\n \"And if I do, that it will fail to grow and flourish. Weak infants are exposed, and if my child is not hearty, it will be left for the wild creatures to live upon. Baru Ksoka would declare as Kaigan that weak infants are not likely to live long and thus not only strengthen the clan but are spared suffering through their quick deaths, and I know this is the right way, so that the child remains part of the clan, just as the foals we offer to the gods and the cats become the spirit of our clan, and a source of power for the living.\" This last was spoken as if it meant nothing to her.\\n\\n \"With this year being so difficult, do you suppose there will be more offerings to your gods and your cats?\" Zangi-Ragozh felt an abiding sympathy for her, but held his expression in check, for he sensed she had no wish to give in to her anxiety.\\n\\n \"There have been more foals and kids offered. Soon it must be infants, because horses and goats have proved insufficient.\" She made a mess of a chuckle. \"Perhaps Apostle Lazarus could appeal to his God for another son to come to help us; after so long a time, a new sacrifice may be needed.\"\\n\\n \"He might well consider such a suggestion blasphemy,\" said Zangi-Ragozh.\\n\\n \"Most certainly,\" she agreed. \"But in our many discussions, I have said much the same, and worse, and he does not chide me for it.\"\\n\\n \"Circumstances may change his mind,\" Zangi-Ragozh warned her.\\n\\n \"It may do more than that; already some of our clan pray to Apostle Lazarus\u0027 God.\"\\n\\n \"Why have you told me this?\" Zangi-Ragozh asked her, coming toward her as she huddled in the chair. \"What do you want of me?\"\\n\\n \"I do not know what it is I seek,\" she said, continuing more tentatively. \"I think perhaps I was hoping you might consider traveling with the clan until I deliver. We should have gone a long way westward by that time, and you are bound in that direction. My magic cannot protect me from the rigors of childbirth, or from anything else, for it has no impact upon me, only on others. But you might have skills that will be able to provide defenses for me.\"\\n\\n \"Are you having any difficulties?\" Zangi-Ragozh put his hand on her forehead, concentrating on what he felt. \"No sign of fever; that\u0027s something.\"\\n\\n \"No, no difficulties in particular. This is my first child, and I am worried because I am so old. Most Jou\u0027an-Jou\u0027an women have their first babies by their sixteenth year, and I am nine years older than that, which makes things harder for me than many.\" She looked up at him. \"How will I-\"\\n\\n \"Have you been ill at all? Is your appetite good?\"\\n\\n \"I have been tired,\" she said. \"I am always hungry. But all of us must have less just now.\"\\n\\n \"That could be hard on your child,\" said Zangi-Ragozh as gently as he could as he lowered his hand and scrutinized her face.\\n\\n \"Would the child starve, do you think?\" Her face was impassive but her eyes burned.\\n\\n \"It is possible. I have seen it happen,\" he said, thinking back to the nine severe famines he had seen in his centuries in the Temple of Imhotep in Egypt.\\n\\n \"Is it likely?\"\\n\\n \"That is hard to tell, at least at this point.\" He considered her in silence for a short while.\\n\\n \"If you and your companion were to travel with us, would you treat me? I am troubled by what I have experienced with this infant-so different than what I have seen other women endure. Apostle Lazarus says you have helped pregnant women before. Would you try to preserve my child?\" She was so forlorn that Zangi-Ragozh was almost overwhelmed by her distress.\\n\\n \"What would your Kaigan say?\" He waited while she framed her reply.\\n\\n \"I am the magician of the clan. He will do as I say, particularly for the sake of his child.\" She folded her arms and stared at him. \"Travel with us, foreigner, and help us.\"\\n\\n Zangi-Ragozh shook his head. \"Your clan will have a hard time in any case: might not some of your people resent two strangers in your midst?\"\\n\\n Dukkai spoke with real purpose. \"I am to see Baru Ksoka later today. I want to tell him that you will be part of our group when we depart.\"\\n\\n \"I would like to have a little time to consider my answer,\" he told her. \"May I have until midday? I must speak with Ro-shei. It is not for me to make such a decision without consulting him.\"\\n\\n \"Is he of your blood, then?\" Dukkai demanded, a touch of anger in her tone.\\n\\n \"No; he is an old, old companion, one who has been with me through many hardships and over many li. I have traveled with him for more years than I care to remember.\" Zangi-Ragozh took her hand in his. \"I am grateful for your invitation; I would imagine that you may have to persuade Baru Ksoka to acquiesce in it.\"\\n\\n \"I am the magician of the clan; the Kaigan cannot challenge my position.\"\\n\\n \"You would not be wise to put that to the test just now, and not because you are pregnant,\" said Zangi-Ragozh. \"I have seen families and clans rent apart by far less than what is happening now. You would do the Desert Cats no service by forcing more uncertainty upon them.\"\\n\\n \"Having you and your companion with us would be more help than hindrance,\" she said firmly. \"Remember, it will be midwinter by the time we reach Aksu.\"\\n\\n \"If you are fortunate,\" said Zangi-Ragozh. \"In such hard weather, travel will not be rapid.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"All the more reason to have one of your skills with us.\"\\n\\n He lifted her hand to his lips. \"I thank you for the honor you have given me, Dukkai, and I will strive to reach a decision that will benefit all of us-my companion and me, and you and your clan.\"\\n\\n \"By midday,\" she reminded him, staring at her hand where he had kissed it. \"Is this a custom among your people?\"\\n\\n \"And among many in the West,\" he explained.\\n\\n \"A strange thing to do,\" she said, looking at the back of her hand as if she expected to see a mark upon it.\\n\\n \"No one in the West would think so,\" said Zangi-Ragozh.\\n\\n \"Do you miss the West?\" She blurted out the question and then put her hand to her mouth.\\n\\n \"It is where my native earth lies,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Then you must want to return to it,\" she said.\\n\\n \"In times such as these, yes, I must,\" he said, thinking of the dwindling supply of native earth in his chests. Even now, with the sun lacking in power, he could not entirely escape the enervation daylight brought him. \"However I travel, and with whom, I know I must go to the Carpa-Ti Mountains to be restored.\" Or to die, he added to himself.\\n\\n She nodded. \"I do not like going beyond the territory we usually travel.\"\\n\\n He considered what she said. \"I would hope that by the time you reach Aksu the weather improves and this region of yellow snow will be far behind you.\"\\n\\n \"And I, but it may not be.\" She rose and stood directly in front of him. \"And you have thought of this, too; I can see it in your eyes. You are harried by assumptions of various mishaps and calamities that may lie ahead of us.\"\\n\\n \"I have never encountered such a year as this,\" he said somberly.\\n\\n \"No; and the stories my grandmother told had nothing of this sort in them, though they were filled with accounts of wars and famines and other misfortunes.\" She moved toward the door. \"For your sake and for mine, I hope you will come with us. Your and your companion would provide-\" She stopped suddenly.\\n\\n \"Between the dark and the cold, you will have hard-going; all of us will.\" He went with her to the door. \"I will let you know when you return what I have decided: my Word on it.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I am going to speak with Baru Ksoka, to discover what he is willing to accept.\"\\n\\n \"I thank you for such a concession,\" he said with a quick, ironic smile.\\n\\n \"You may think I am being foolish,\" she said, \"but I know what I know, and I see you have power beyond any that Apostle Lazarus recognizes.\"\\n\\n \"How can you be sure,\" he said, covering the disquiet he felt at this remark with a genial half-bow in the Western style.\\n\\n \"Tejamksa died in childbirth,\" she said. \"There are those who think that I must do the same.\" With that, she slipped out the door and closed it softly before hurrying down the corridor to the stairs.\\n\\n Zangi-Ragozh stood alone for some little while, his thoughts deliberately blank. At last he went to the athanor and opened its central chamber, placing the crock in the declivity in the center, then adjusting the lid one last time before closing the stone door and stoking the furnace, using small bellows to heat the fire to an intensity that was usually reserved for bronze- and iron-smiths at their forges. For as long as it took him to recite the Death of Achilles he kept steadily at his labor, then left the athanor to burn out and cool down.\\n\\n It was approaching midday when Ro-shei came into the alchemical chamber, an empty cask in his hands. \"You asked for this.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, yes, I did,\" said Zangi-Ragozh, taking it and setting it on the trestle table. \"It should not be long now.\"\\n\\n \"Why have you made such a great portion of your sovereign remedy?\" Ro-shei asked.\\n\\n \"I fear we will have need of it before our travels are done, and I may not have many opportunities to make more.\" He took a clean cloth and wiped out the cask, checking it carefully for leaks. \"The lid? Does it have a wire stay?\"\\n\\n \"Yes; you can see the grooves for the wire.\" Ro-shei pointed them out.\\n\\n \"Very good. This is going to have to serve us for some time, I fear,\" said Zangi-Ragozh. \"If anyone doubts that there is going to be a very arduous winter ahead, it is because he is living in a place where the sun is not darkened, and the land is warm-either that, or he is mad with optimism.\"\\n\\n Ro-shei considered Zangi-Ragozh, measuring his demeanor with the knowledge of five centuries. \"You are anticipating much worse to come.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I were not,\" said Zangi-Ragozh.\\n\\n \"Is that why you are still uncertain about when we might resume traveling?\"\\n\\n Zangi-Ragozh\u0027s answer was measured. \"I see that there could be advantages to wintering here: we are known to the Apostle and he would extend his hospitality to you and me if I asked for it; I have no doubt of it. But I would find it difficult-or impossible-to have a lover, and it would not be prudent to go to the dancing girls, not if they are reduced to beggary, as I suspect many of them will be. Such contacts are ... shall we say, unwise.\"\\n\\n \"So you intend to leave?\" Ro-shei gave no indication of his opinion of this possibility.\\n\\n \"Dukkai has asked that we travel with her clan when they move on, which they will do shortly.\" He stared at the fire in the open stove. \"The clan is small, and that will limit my chance for nourishment more severely than remaining here in Kumul will.\"\\n\\n Ro-shei took a turn about the narrow room. \"Have you broached the matter of your requirements?\"\\n\\n \"No, I have not.\" He moved a little closer to the fire. \"She wants my answer by midday.\"\\n\\n \"That will come soon,\" said Ro-shei.\\n\\n \"I know,\" said Zangi-Ragozh. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"I think whether we stay or go, there will be difficulties. There is nowhere we have heard of that is salubrious now.\" Ro-shei went to put another length of wood on the fire. \"But I think there is a better chance of finding a wholesome place if we travel than if we wait here for news to arrive, for that may be long in coming. Who knows when the next caravan from the West will come, or if one will come at all.\" At this last, he stared at Zangi-Ragozh as if to command his full attention. \"Whatever this invisible darkness is, it may come from the West as well as the East.\"\\n\\n \"Or the North or the South,\" said Zangi-Ragozh distantly as he gave himself over to thought.\\n\\n \"But we know it has force here, and it might not be as bad elsewhere,\" said Ro-shei, then added before Zangi-Ragozh could speak, \"And it may be worse. That is the risk, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes; that is the risk.\" Zangi-Ragozh looked over at the athanor. \"In a short while I can put the remedy in the cask and seal it.\"\\n\\n \"Would you like my help doing that?\" Ro-shei offered, knowing Zangi-Ragozh would not discuss his ruminations until he had decided what to do.\\n\\n \"It is unnecessary, but your company is very welcome,\" said Zangi-Ragozh; he touched the bricks of the athanor and said, \"Not quite yet.\"\\n\\n Ro-shei could not keep from asking, \"Do you think the money and jewels you\u0027ve made will be enough to get us to the Black Sea?\"\\n\\n \"I hope they will,\" said Zangi-Ragozh. \"Either that, or they will take us back to Yang-Chau.\"\\n\\n \"If we go there, we would do well to go by way of Chang\u0027an.\" Ro-shei\u0027s warning was given lightly enough, but with firm purpose.\\n\\n \"If the Wen Emperor has held on to his throne, I suppose it would be best.\" Zangi-Ragozh stared toward the window and the pale morning light. \"There are storms coming. That high, veiled light promises severe weather, and soon.\"\\n\\n \"Better to remain here, do you think?\" Ro-shei said.\\n\\n \"Or better to suggest to Dukkai that her clan stay here a while longer and depart once the storm is over,\" said Zangi-Ragozh.\\n\\n \"It would seem you have made up your mind,\" said Ro-shei with a short sigh.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I think so,\" said Zangi-Ragozh in the same remote voice. \"If you have no objection.\"\\n\\n \"And if the clan will not wait to leave? What then?\"\\n\\n \"Then I suppose we must go with them,\" said Zangi-Ragozh, and opened the athanor to remove the container of his sovereign remedy.\\n\\n Text of a letter from Captain I Mo-Ching of the Morning Star from Tai-Wan to Councillor Ko She-Hsieh, both in Yang-Chau.\\n\\n To the most illustrious Councillor Ko She-Hsieh, the most respectful greetings of I Mo-Ching, Captain of the Morning Star, a merchant ship of the Eclipse Trading Company, now presently in her home port, Yang-Chau, on this the beginning of the Burning Clothes Festival:\\n\\n Not that we will burn many clothes this year, for the climate has been too severe to spare any but the paper representations of clothes for the fires. Still, the festival must be observed, and with especial care to the traditions, or more calamities may be visited upon us, which is something all would wish to avoid.\\n\\n I shall do my utmost to provide you with all the facts I have to hand, and I will limit my speculations as best as I may. So, let me say first that I have had no communication with Zangi-Ragozh, the Worthy Foreigner who owns the Eclipse Trading Company, since he left Yang-Chau for Chang\u0027an, nor, to my knowledge, has any other Captain of his fleet, nor his clerks. Our travels have been severely limited, as you know, and that has made for much slower transferring of letters, and it may be that one of the other Captains have heard from him, but no confirmation of this has been presented to Hu Bi-Da, his senior clerk, for he would, have informed all of us in the city that he had news of Zangi-Ragozh. Second, I must tell you that the loss of his ships-there are two that we know of, and there may be more-has been a blow to the business. Third, I wish to say that Zangi-Ragozh is far from being, the only merchant who has been unable to get word to this city since the current hardships began, and I put no more significance in his absence than I do in the missing Jai Mi-Jah or Bo Gan-Lao, who have not been seen for more than a year, and who were not so provident in their preparations for being gone.\\n\\n It may be that Zangi-Ragozh has come to grief, and if that is the case, I know he has prepared a Will, which must make some arrangement for the distribution of his property and goods. I am certain that his clerk or his steward may produce the Will if the Council should require it. You, most respected Councillor, must know that Zangi-Ragozh has made a great effort to comply with our laws and our customs, and I cannot believe he would be lax in so important a matter as the distribution of his estate. His steward keeps good accounts for the household, and I know Jho Chieh-Jen will not balk at surrendering any information you may require.\\n\\n To answer your question, no Captain to whom I have spoken has any news of Zangi-Ragozh in the ports that his ships visit, and that includes the new office in Saylan; that establishment was badly damaged by the mountainous waves that struck at the end of winter and marked the beginning of this dark time of yellow snow. The Captains of courier ships have also had no news regarding him, and I have to say that I believe wherever he is, it is not in a port where he is known. Not all merchants travel by sea, and although you may have found that he left Lo-Yang, he might well have taken the Huang Ho north as well as east, to follow a land route rather than the sea-lanes. No one has demanded a ransom for him, but I would not be much surprised if such a demand arrives soon. At such a time, a ransom may be regarded as the only means of securing food and heat for the winter, for all China seems to be still in the relentless grip of cold, and the slow torture of starvation.\\n\\n It is fortunate that Zangi-Ragozh left so many provisions for his Captains and his household. There is rice in quantity in his warehouses, stipulated for the relief of hunger for us all. Also there are smoked meats and pickled vegetables that will provide enough food to last us into the spring, when we must all hope August Heaven one again allows crops to thrive. You will find that both Clerk Hu and Steward Jho have instructions from Zangi-Ragozh that specify how such stored foodstuffs are to be used, as well has strictures for those who do not honor his wishes. I, myself, know that if we are to survive this terrible time, we must follow his orders on every point, for his foresight has guided his company successfully in prosperous times and I know his policies will do so in hardship.\\n\\n I submit this to you, with nay assurance that what I tell you is accurate, that my opinions are based on reliable information and not wild speculation. I will not give up hope that the Worthy Foreigner is still alive and will eventually return to Yang-Chau when conditions here improve. I will report to you any news I may receive regarding him, as I have stated, and I will do all that I may to assist the Council in preserving his Eclipse Trading Company against his return.\\n\\n I Mo-Ching\\n\\n Captain of the Morning Star\\n\\n (his chop) \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-of-the-sun-saint-germain-17/page-12.html","bookId":2501,"book":{"id":2501,"title":"Dark of the Sun (Saint-Germain #17)","description":"Storyline: Dark of the Sun (Saint-Germain #17) \\n It is the 6th century of the common era.
