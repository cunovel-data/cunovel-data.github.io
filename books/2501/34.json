{"id":106539,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"With a gesture to protect herself from evil forces, the old peasant woman stepped back from the two men standing in the narrow door of her one-room house. \"The crest? You should not go near the crest. No one should go there!\" she exclaimed. Night had just fallen and the forest felt as if it were coming across the meadows and fields to besiege her.\n \"But why not?\" asked the dark-haired man, who spoke her language well, but in an old-fashioned way. \"The innkeeper down the mountain said that you would explain it to us if we asked you, that you know the story.\"\n \"Old Noccu! Well, did he, now?\" The old woman grinned, revealing few teeth; she was thin, wiry, and spry; the language she spoke was not descended from the one Ragoczy Franciscus had learned as a child, but was that of much later settlers in the region. \"Did he send you here?\"\n \"He told us that you knew the secrets of the crest and the stories of its past,\" said the second man. His command of the language was less elegant than his companion\u0027s, but it was enough to impress the old woman, who was becoming nervous in such august company.\n \"It is haunted,\" she said with such total seriousness that neither Ragoczy Franciscus nor Rojeh could laugh at her. \"Everyone knows it.\"\n \"Why do you say so?\" Ragoczy Franciscus asked her. \"We have come a long way, and we intended to journey to the crest of this part of the mountains.\" They had begun the long climb two nights before and had made steady progress up the neglected roads that led to the high passes and the Transylvanian plateau beyond.\n \"Because it is true,\" she declared.\n \"How can you know?\" Rojeh lowered his head to show he meant no disrespect.\n \"It is an old story,\" the woman said, and waited to be coaxed. \"Noccu was right about that. He does not care about such things.\"\n \"Will you tell us? For the safety of our journey?\" Rojeh reverenced her as if she were a great lady in the court of the Emperor at Constantinople.\n \"You must not think me foolish,\" she said, holding up her gnarled hand as if to demand an oath from them. \"I will not be laughed at or thought a fool, jesting for your amusement.\"\n \"No, we will not think that,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus.\n \"I do not tell stories to be held in contempt,\" she persisted.\n \"We offer none,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"We seek only to know what you can tell us.\"\n She gave this her consideration, then ducked her head. \"If you want to come in, you may. It is warmer by my fire.\" She stepped back, as if suddenly aware of the grandeur of her two visitors. \"I have just the one chair.\"\n \"And it is yours by right,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"We can sit on the floor.\"\n \"It is just packed earth with rushes on it,\" she said apologetically.\n \"Never mind,\" Ragoczy Franciscus said, sinking down and sitting cross-legged at an angle to the hearth and her chair.\n She started to laugh, but stopped as quickly. \"I meant nothing against you.\"\n \"Nor did I think otherwise,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus.\n Rojeh also sat on the floor, his abolla gathered closely around him. \"This is a cozy house,\" he said, thinking that the smell of smoke, old cooking, and old woman made it so close that he felt the air itself was a presence in the single room. Yet it had a completeness that made it a pleasant place.\n \"I had the story from my grandmother, who lived to be forty-eight summers old; I love to tell it in her honor.\" The old woman nodded three times to confirm this figure. \"I, myself, have seen forty-seven summers,\" she added with pride.\n \"A considerable age,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, knowing that among the living, it was.\n \"I have passed this to my granddaughters, and they, one day, will tell it to their grandchildren.\" She managed a deeply wrinkled smile. \"It is to our credit that our family is long-lived.\"\n \"That it is,\" said Rojeh.\n As if satisfied that she had given her credentials, she sat down in her chair and gazed into the flames of the fire, a distant expression in her small, dark eyes. \"It is a story that goes back to the ancient times, when the world was a different place than it is now. There is a great citadel up there at the crest, from long, long ago. It was built before the walls of Byzantium were put in place, even before the great heroes of the Athenians and the Spartans were roaming the world. The lord of the citadel was a powerful warrior who had allies among the angels and devils and old gods of the land, and they all stood against those who would attack the lord and all he held as his.\" She looked from Rojeh to Ragoczy Franciscus. \"This lord was one of a great line, and he had sons to follow him, twenty fine sons and twenty lovely daughters, each more worthy than the last.\" Pausing, she took a sip from her wooden cup. \"This is plum wine, if you would like any?\"\n \"No, but thank you,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"I do not drink wine.\"\n \"Nor do I,\" said Rojeh.\n \"I will drink more, then,\" she said, satisfied, and reached for a stoneware bottle to refill the cup; she managed a tense little chuckle as she poured for herself. \"As I was saying, there was this great lord, from a great line, with fine sons to follow him, and a band of loyal warriors to fight with him. All the land held in the long curve of the mountains was his to command, and all the plains behind the mountains bowed to him as well. He built his citadel on the highest crag over a river gorge so that no enemy would dare approach it-remote as any eagle\u0027s nest-and guarded by a splendid line of fifty fortresses leading from far below us to the crest. These fortresses were as grand as any palace in Constantine\u0027s City, and they were so large that they held a thousand warriors and two thousand horses.\"\n \"Was it difficult to build, the citadel?\" Rojeh asked. \"In such a remote place, it must have been.\"\n \"It took many years and the efforts of powerful old gods to build it, and the toil of ten thousand men, all of whom labored for the glory of it,\" she said with relish. \"The citadel was as large as a great camp of famous generals, and it boasted buildings three stories high.\"\n \"A formidable place,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus with an ironic half-smile.\n \"A very great place. Warriors flocked there in their thousands, and the thunder of their horses\u0027 hooves made the mountains echo.\" She slapped one hand on her knee. \"The enemy might have thought there were storms on the peaks, or congregations of demons.\"\n \"Wise, to guard himself so well,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus with a fleeting recollection of his father\u0027s face. \"He must have been a very provident man.\"\n \"So you would think,\" said the old woman.\n \"Then the lord had protected his citadel as well as any man might,\" said Rojeh.\n \"You could hope it, but it turned out not to be as wise a plan as one would think, for an enormous army from the East heard of this citadel and came at the behest of the lords and the King of the lands in the southeast and across the water to claim it, and all it contained, for themselves. They came in waves, these warriors, and they drove the lord of the citadel back from his fortresses.\" She had another drink, this time a large gulp. \"One by one the fortresses fell until all the warriors and their lord retreated to the citadel, where it is said all of his soldiers, and their wives and children, pledged to fight to their last breath and asked their gods and devils and angels to stand with them. The old gods rode with his horsemen and his sons against the marauders from the southeast.\" She took another sip, a longer one this time. \"It is said that the old gods of the lord and the land were killed-but how can anyone kill a god?-and the oldest son of the lord, who had led the fight, was captured by the enemy to be given to the King of the southeast, who had commanded the war, as tribute.\" More plum wine went down her throat and she smiled muzzily. \"It is a very sad story.\"\n \"Why is it sad, if the warriors and their lord heroically defended the citadel?\" Rojeh asked.\n \"Because all their efforts failed,\" she said.\n \"By might or by treachery?\" Ragoczy Franciscus asked.\n \"It is said that the lord was betrayed by his adviser, who told the opposing leaders many things about the fortress and the citadel, and the enemy was able to attack the citadel,\" she said.\n \"Treachery,\" Ragoczy Franciscus mused.\n The old woman nodded. \"Then the gods and angels and devils deserted the lord and the citadel was besieged and finally it fell. The lord and most of his sons were executed, but some were made slaves of the conquerors, and the oldest was sent far away, to show that the lord of the citadel was wholly vanquished, and to demonstrate to all the world that the citadel on the mountain peaks had fallen. Among the defenders, those who were not captured and enslaved were burned when the citadel was put to the torch. Anyone venturing near the crest may hear their cries today, and they may be led astray by the spirits of the dead, for the ghosts yearn for vengeance. If you go there, you may find yourself surrounded by specters and driven mad by their screams.\" She drank down the rest of the plum wine. \"I don\u0027t have much left. There were almost no plums these last years. This year there have been only a few.\"\n \"You deserve a cask of plum wine, good woman,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"That was a most instructive story.\"\n \"Then you will not go to the crag,\" she said apprehensively. \"You must tell me you will not go to the crag.\" In her agitation she almost overturned her jar of wine; she caught it in the nick of time and set it upright. \"Tell me you will not go.\"\n \"We will keep to safe roads,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus.\n \"We will be careful if we have to cross the crest,\" said Rojeh, trying to soothe her.\n \"Good, good,\" she said. \"Yes. Good.\"\n Rojeh reached for her jar of wine and refilled her cup. \"Drink to our safe journey, good woman, and I am sure we will have nothing to fear.\"\n She gave him a startled stare. \"Is that what you want?\" Ducking her head, the old woman wrapped her hands around the cup and held it up as if to receive the divine chrism, saying, \"Go safely, come safely, and never have cause to fear.\" Then she drank down half the contents of the cup quickly and totally, to insure the magic was not wasted.\n \"A most gracious wish,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus as he rose from the floor. \"You have told us much of worth, and I am grateful to you.\" He knew that leaving her money would insult her, so he took a small jade ornament he had removed from their clothes case and laid it on the ground next to her chair. \"To remember us by.\"\n Her eyes glittered. \"Noccu did right in sending you to me,\" she said, slurring the last of her words. \"I do not often have visitors but my grandchildren, so I am honored to have such fine guests, if only for a short while. You may be sure I will remember you until I am long in my grave.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Ragoczy Franciscus reverenced her once more, this time with a flourish.\n Rojeh also stood up. \"You have been good to receive us.\"\n She was trying to rise from her chair, without much success. \"I have never had two such grand gentlemen as you come into my house before.\"\n Ragoczy Franciscus extended his hand to her. \"Let me help you.\"\n She took his hand and struggled to her feet. \"Too much plum wine,\" she muttered.\n \"Drunk in a good cause,\" said Rojeh, helping to steady her.\n \"The summer is ending,\" she said, and put a hand to her eyes. \"Soon the winter will return, and the cold will be everywhere again. Terrible cold.\"\n \"Winter comes every year,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"As does summer.\"\n \"But not as winter has come the last two years,\" she said in a tone that would countenance no dispute. \"The last two years have been different. Longer. Harsher.\" She rubbed her forehead as if trying to stimulate thought. \"Wolves have come down from the high mountains and taken hens from their roosts and lambs from the fold. Fields have lain barren from ice. The dead lie unburied.\"\n \"Certainly the years have been colder,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, starting to make his way to the door.\n \"And the sun darker,\" she persisted.\n \"Yes, that as well,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus as he and Rojeh reached the door. \"We will speak well of you to others.\" He started toward his horse, relieved to hear Rojeh behind him.\n They mounted up as the old woman watched them from the door of her house; Rojeh had the mule\u0027s lead and he fell in behind Ragoczy Franciscus as he resumed their long journey up the mountain trails to the rocky crest. The small house was soon lost in the dark and the trees behind them, and they made their way by starlight at first, and moonlight later. When they stopped at the base of a waterfall to permit the horses and mule to drink, Rojeh finally asked, \"That story of hers: how much of it was yours?\"\n \"Too much: the people here have not forgotten. But it is not accurate, either. There were no twenty sons and twenty daughters, nor thousands of warriors; our best fortress was never grand, and there were no more than three fortresses below the citadel, not a line of fifty of them. The battles would have turned out differently if there had been even a third of that number of men, or fortresses. My father\u0027s lands were extensive, but he did not rule all of the Carpathians and the Dacian plain,\" he answered. \"My father did build the citadel-that much was true-and it was burned with most of the defenders in it. I had already been taken in battle and was the prisoner of the troops sent to attack us. It is most unlucky that so much of the story remains intact.\" He stared off into the night. \"My father was betrayed, but not as she said: one of his brothers-in-law was promised the leadership of the Erastna-\"\n \"Your people,\" said Rojeh.\n \"Yes. And the foes were the Cimmerians,\" he said slowly, the recollections gathering in him and holding his full attention. \"They were the ones who killed me, the Cimmerians, since I would not oblige them and die in battle. Over time, they killed all of us Ragosh-ski, including my uncle who helped them.\" Birds were beginning their morning carols, and Ragoczy Franciscus stopped to listen to them. \"How good to hear so many songs again. I had feared the birds were gone.\"\n \"How many escaped the flames?\" As soon as he said it, Rojeh wished he had not spoken.\n \"I do not know. I had been taken away from these mountains by the time the Erastna left. But I know all the men of the family were executed one way or another, and most of the women. And all of our gods.\" He fell silent again. \"As many as could fled westward, away from the enemy.\"\n \"The gods were the ones who made you what you are,\" said Rojeh; he wanted to encourage Ragoczy Franciscus to talk, since he so rarely said much about his early years. \"Your gods were vampires. Does anyone remember that?\"\n \"If they do, they keep their memories in whispers.\"\n \"Would she know the stories told of you if there are only whispers?\"\n \"I would think she would: she would probably know that I was born at the dark of the year, and that one of them-the gods of my people-met me in the sacred grove at the main fortress, many leagues from here, at the Winter Solstice on the night I turned fourteen, and I drank his blood from his palms, which meant I would become like them when I died. If she knows about the citadel, she surely knows of this, as well.\" He lapsed into a brief reverie. \"I could not see which one it was, but I always hoped it was God Menisho.\" His expression changed, shifting his attention. \"I have not spoken his name for centuries.\"\n \"But you have not forgot him,\" Rojeh said carefully. \"Or any of your forgotten gods.\" He waited a moment. \"Does it bother you to return here?\"\n \"No,\" he said, his dark eyes enigmatic as he looked past the mountains into the past. \"It did the first time, for it was all still too fresh, too raw, and I was too engrossed in exacting full suffering from the descendants of those who conquered this place.\" He sighed. \"I made the memory of my family abhorrent, and deservedly so.\"\n When he did not continue, Rojeh said, \"It was long ago and you are not that man now.\"\n \"Ah, but I still have the capacity, and I forget that at my peril.\" Ragoczy Franciscus glanced up at the sky, marking the positions of the stars. \"Dawn is coming, and we should move on.\"\n \"Does it pain you to hear the stories about your kind?\" Rojeh could not help asking; Ragoczy Franciscus rarely said so much about himself and Rojeh was curious.\n Ragoczy Franciscus considered the question. \"It did at one time, far less now. This is my native earth, and it has a strength for me that nothing can change, no matter what the legends say.\"\n Rojeh looked down at the ground. \"This place where we stand: is this your native earth?\"\n \"No, not yet,\" Ragoczy Franciscus said. \"But I can sense its nearness; if we keep going, by morning we will not have to stop for the day and seek shelter from sunlight.\" He patted his mare on the neck and prepared to remount. \"It is not much farther now.\"\n They continued up the mountain as the sky in the east began to lighten, finally showing the rubicund promise of dawn, which had been their signal to stop, but now Ragoczy Franciscus kept on, his posture in the saddle straight, showing no trace of fatigue. As they topped the ridge of the mountain\u0027s flank, Rojeh called out, \"It is getting light. Should we find shelter?\"\n \"No,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"We will soon be where we are going.\"\n \"We have not come this way before,\" said Rojeh as they continued along the crest.\n \"No, nor to this place. This is the hardest to reach of all the fortresses. When we have come to this land in times past, we have arrived from the west, not the east, and gone to the main fortress, in the center of my father\u0027s lands, not here at the edge. But this is where it ended, and it is fitting that we are here.\"\n \"If you mean to let this be your ending.\" As kindly as Rojeh spoke, he was challenging Ragoczy Franciscus. \"You must do it alone.\"\n For a long moment, Ragoczy Franciscus said nothing. Then he looked up the face of the crags. \"If the land still knows me, I will do whatever it requires.\"\n \"I will not help you to die the True Death,\" Rojeh warned.\n \"I did not think you would, old friend.\" Ragoczy Franciscus tapped his blue roan with his heel, moving her to the side of a narrow pathway. \"The ground is not steady here; keep to the verge.\"\n \"I will.\" Rojeh wanted to know how Ragoczy Franciscus could be so certain about the road, but he held his question for the time being. \"How far is the citadel?\"\n \"Less than half a league. You should be able to see it, at the point of that crag.\" He held out his arm to show Rojeh where to look, but nothing had the appearance of a fortress; there was only the forbidding face of rock. \"So much to remember.\"\n \"I still cannot see it; it must be the angle of the light,\" Rojeh said, feeling he had to justify his lack of recognition.\n \"No doubt,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"The citadel is a ruin. It has been a ruin for more than nine hundred years.\" He shaded his eyes in the slanting sunlight. \"I know where to look, and what was there.\"\n \"Then I must follow you and trust you will lead us aright, as you always have,\" Rojeh said lightly, giving the mule\u0027s lead a decisive wrench to keep him moving.\n Ragoczy Franciscus\u0027 crack of laughter was colored with chagrin. \"You know that is not so, as well as I do. I apologize for all the times I have taken you into danger; this should not be such a time,\" he said as he rode on into the morning toward the ruin of the citadel. A short while later he pulled in his horse at the edge of a low, crumbling wall of rough-hewn stones. Growing trees had forced their roots through the ancient stones, leaving cracks and reclaiming the wall as a part of the mountain. Ragoczy Franciscus dismounted and stood still, looking at the space the line of rocks enclosed, and he said to Rojeh, who had ridden up behind him, \"Welcome to my father\u0027s citadel.\" He laid his hand on the nearest section of broken wall. \"When I was a living man, this was three times my height and had an archers\u0027 walkway.\" He started along the perimeter of the wall. \"The gate is just ahead. We should go in there.\"\n \"Because it is the gate?\" Rojeh was puzzled.\n \"Because it is easier on the horses and the mule,\" Ragoczy Franciscus answered, moving more vigorously as he turned past what might have been the base of a tower long ago.\n Rojeh got off his horse and took the leads for the stallion and the mule in hand. \"I\u0027m surprised he hasn\u0027t balked,\" he admitted, meaning the stallion, for the mule had balked often.\n \"He trusts you; you have given him good care and you do not fight with him,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus. \"But he could still decide not to do as you tell him.\"\n \"I am aware of that,\" said Rojeh, and said what was troubling him. \"If anything should happen to the horses, how would we manage to bring your native earth down from here, if no one will come to this place?\"\n \"We may not leave for a while; we will work something out if we must,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, pointing ahead. \"There. You see: the gate.\" A wide break in the wall framed by two broad bases. He stepped through the opening, saying, \"You are welcome to my father\u0027s citadel.\"\n Following him into the wide, ill-defined interior of the walls\u0027 outline, Rojeh said, \"I am gladdened to be here.\"\n \"And I, and I,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, touching his throat. \"It has a power for me, though it is nothing.\" He opened the collar of his kandys: where there had been a mulberry-colored weal marking the path of Dukkai\u0027s knife there was now a pale line that was almost visibly fading away.\n Rojeh had seen Ragoczy Franciscus\u0027 remarkable restorative powers, but this astonished him. \"So quickly.\"\n \"The cut was ready to heal,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, turning slowly in a circle. \"I know you cannot tell very much from what is left, but there, in that part of the courtyard, was the stable. It held up to eighty horses, as I recall. There were some paddocks set up outside the stable.\" He swung around toward the northwest. \"Over there they had the soldiers\u0027 quarters-they were crowded little cells, but the men expected nothing better, and complained no more than most soldiers do.\" He stared at a long mound with the suggestion of a roof-line at the far end. \"That must have been the soldiers\u0027 dining room.\" His next turn left him facing north and the gate. \"There were two guard-towers, both three storeys tall. The marshaling yard was where we are standing. And that jumble behind me was my father\u0027s keep.\" He faced the south. \"Family quarters were there, on the second floor. The main hall was where those two trees are growing. The kitchen was immediately behind the main hall, and the spring that fed all the citadel, and there was a garden behind the keep, and pens for animals.\"\n \"Much like many others,\" said Rojeh.\n \"Truly.\" He lowered his head. \"In another three or four hundred years, it will be gone. The rocks will be only rocks, and the trees will claim the courtyard, the marshaling yard and the garden as their own. In better years, when there is more grass, we would not see so much.\"\n Rojeh took stock of the citadel. \"We have certainly stayed in worse places.\"\n \"But you are right-winter is coming,\" said Ragoczy Francsicus.\n \"And it will be a harsh one,\" Rojeh added. \"Perhaps not as bad as last year, but bad enough.\"\n \"If this seems too remote, then perhaps we can go to the main fortress. We could reach it in a day, assuming the roads are passable.\"\n \"This is a very isolated place.\" Rojeh gave a sweep of his hand. \"Once the snows come, how could we find nourishment here, for any of us?\"\n There was a long, twisting quiet, then Ragoczy Franciscus laughed. \"You are right, of course: these walls are useless, and this crag is too removed from everything to provide anything more than a source of my native earth, which all of my father\u0027s lands can provide.\" He strode toward the crumbled keep, saying as he went, \"This place has power for me, but nothing else-after twenty-five centuries, why should it have?\"\n \"Then we will move on?\"\n \"I suppose it would be best,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Tomorrow, then, yes; we can go to the central fortress. There is a settlement near it, or there was ninety years ago. We should be able to pass the winter there. It is not as high, and it is, or was, a crossroad.\" Ragoczy Franciscus swung around and took in the whole of the citadel. \"It did what it was intended to do long ago. It is time for it to be over at last, so the living may forget.\" His vigor was more apparent now, and he moved with the graceful ease that Rojeh had not seen in more than a year. \"As I recall, there was a goatherd\u0027s cottage back against the rear wall. Some of that building might still be intact enough to provide us a place for the night.\"\n Rojeh watched him stride along the stone heap that marked the keep. \"In a settlement, there would be opportunities for more nourishment than your native earth provides.\"\n \"No.\u0027 Ragoczy Franciscus stopped.\"No, that would not be wise. The people in those settlements have heard tales of those of my blood, and they fear us, and hate us.\"He faltered, then went on.\"It is not only because of the tales that keep such beliefs alive, it is because of the vengeance I took, so long ago. They told stories of it, and repeated them, adding to the horror as they did, and so now, most of the people of Dacia, Transylvania, whichever you wish to call it, are terrified of all vampires-not without reason.\"\n \"You mean there are more of your blood here?\" Rojeh asked, truly surprised by the prospect.\n \"Not any longer,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus and did not elaborate. He resumed walking toward the rear wall, not as energetically as he had at first.\n Rojeh followed after him. \"What do you mean?\"\n \"It was many centuries ago,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, his dark eyes turning flinty.\n \"Why should something from so far in the past bring trouble now?\" Rojeh persisted, knowing his questions distressed Ragoczy Franciscus. \"Does being here remind you of-?\"\n \"It was not a worthy undertaking.\" His frown deepened.\n \"Because it was against your own kind?\"\n Ragoczy Franciscus stared into the distance. \"They and I ... There was a campaign, I suppose you would call it; slaughter would be a more accurate word.\" He stepped into what had been the kitchen garden; it had long since become a riot of weeds and thickets. \"It seemed necessary at the time, but I would not want to have to take such action again.\"\n \"Because of the Blood Bond,\" said Rojeh, moving in the same direction Ragoczy Franciscus was walking, drawing the horses and the mules after him.\n \"Of course,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus, stopping once again to peer around an outcropping of rock. He stood for a while, seeing the fallen cottage and noticing the three old wild apple trees that grew through the wreckage of the cottage; the trees held his concentration for a short while, their ordinariness in this place of hoary bloodshed engrossing him. His expression changed slowly and he spoke to Rojeh in a more tranquil tone. \"You are right. This is a place of the past. It and I are no longer coalesced as we once were. You and I should go on.\" As Rojeh blinked at this unexpected change Ragoczy Franciscus came back toward him. \"We will let the horses and the mules graze a bit-there is grass enough to provide them a good meal-and give them water from the well; then we will start toward Castru Rastna.\" It was the name given to the settlement near the remains of Ragoczy Franciscus\u0027 father\u0027s central fortress.\n \"I remember that place,\" said Rojeh, \"But why did you change your mind?\"\n \"Because the land has decided,\" said Ragoczy Franciscus with a fleeting smile. \"There is new growth on the oldest apple trees.\"\n Text of a letter from Tsa Tsa-Si in Yang-Chau to Hu Bi-Da at Eclipse Trading Company in the same city, with copies provided for the Magistrate and the Prefecture.\n On this, the second day of the Fortnight of the White Dew, I take pen in hand to inform you of the disposition of the property held by Zangi-Ragozh in this city, specifically, in regard to his compound, now that his steward Jho Chieh-jen has died. As foreigners go, Zangi-Ragozh conducted his affairs in an exemplary manner, and that makes this duty all the more compelling, for I am not constrained by any barbaric customs he might have imposed, or a disregard for our ways and our laws.\n As you must know, Jho died of Wet Lungs two fortnights ago, leaving the household in disarray, and the responsibility for the compound in my hands for as long as the Magistrate accepts my serving in that capacity. In response to the orders of the Magistrate, I have ordered the preparation of a complete inventory of household goods, all moveables, such items as may belong to the individuals of the household, and all other items which are recognized as possessing some level of value. Once the inventory is registered, the various bequests and grants may be performed, in preparation for the closing of the compound itself.\n All the household workers are to receive one silver bar for each year of service, and those who have occupied senior positions are to receive one additional bar each for the higher demands of their offices. These sums are to be drawn from the money left on deposit with the Prefecture, for which duty the Prefecture is to receive five bars of silver. For any widows or orphans of former household workers, the sum of two silver bars is authorized. Proof of the payment of these sums is to be recorded by the Magistrate.\n In terms of furniture, Zangi-Ragozh has left specific donations of major items to the persons whose names are appended to this letter, with my chop upon it. Five of the individuals named by Zangi-Ragozh as recipients of furniture have died, and so the names of their heirs have been substituted for the names of the originally intended recipients. The furniture not specifically granted in Zangi-Ragozh\u0027s instructions is to be offered first to household workers for a reasonable price, and, if a piece is unclaimed, it may be sold in the market and the proceeds given half to the Magistrate and half to the Eclipse Trading Company.\n All common household items from cooking-pots to bedding to garden-tools are to be given to the workers who used them, and to be theirs without condition or qualification whether or not Zangi-Ragozh returns to the compound. This provision is binding on any heir of Zangi-Ragozh who may arrive in this city to claim the property of his senior relative, for Zangi-Ragozh has also stipulated that aside from these bequests, he would leave his property and business only to a blood relative, and that such a relative would produce such items of identification as are described in his official Will at the Prefecture.\n The gardens within the compound are offered to the physicians and herbalists of Yang-Chau, any one of whom may request a time to select such plants as would suit him for the next three fortnights. After that time, the garden is left to the gardeners, to help them in their work and to ensure that they will have the fruits of their trade.\n In light of the hard years we have endured, I recommend that the compound be turned over to the Magistrate for whatever civic use he may designate until Zangi-Ragozh or his heir should come to Yang-Chau. There are a number of good uses to which the compound could be put that do not in any way conflict with the instructions Zangi-Ragozh left. I am aware that his business-dealings were as meticulous as his private ones, and therefore I ask that you agree to meet with me for the purpose of coordinating our duties and activities.

Tidal waves swamp harbors hundreds of miles away, destroying trade ships and their cargoes; tons of ash and dirt are flung into the air. \n In the months to come, the world grows colder and darker as the massive volcanic cloud spreads across the globe, blocking sunlight. Sea trade is ravaged. Crops fail. Livestock, and then people, begin to starve. Disease spreads. Panic rises. \n As always in times of trouble, foreigners-and the vampire is always a foreigner-become targets. Fleeing toward the West, where he hopes to find safety and sanity, the vampire travels with a nomadic tribe led by Dukkai, a female shaman who soon becomes Zangi-Ragozh\u0027s lover. \n But Zangi-Ragozh\u0027s problems are far from over. His vampire nature is discovered by an enemy; he begins to starve; he is betrayed by one he cared deeply for; he loses everything, even his last sack of his native soil. \n With the True Death looming, Zangi-Ragozh tries to reach sanctuary in his ancient homeland. \n Transylvania.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dark-of-the-sun-saint-germain-17.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dark-of-the-sun-saint-germain-17.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:58:32 PM"}}
