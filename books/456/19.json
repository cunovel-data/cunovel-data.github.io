{"id":39757,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX WHICH PROVES THAT TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE","content":"I don\u0027t think she fainted. It was just that her forces had failed her. She lay quite motionless in my arms, her red-brown hair a splash of colour against the white sleeve of my coat. But a few yards, as I have said, separated us from the shelf, so I lifted her up. I felt a soft arm steal round my neck as she steadied herself. I glanced at her face. Her eyes were open. \"Hold tight,\" I bade her, \"and whatever you do don\u0027t look down!\"—for at that height the clear drop down the side of the cliff was enough to make an Alpine guide dizzy. Looking steadfastly ahead and fighting down a horrible feeling of giddiness I carried the girl up the path and at length stood upon the ledge. It curved round the face of the rock, a mere shelf not more than two paces wide but slanting inwards, which improved one\u0027s foothold. From it the face of the cliff dropped sheerly to the nullah hundreds of feet below. I ventured a peep over the side and my brain fairly swam; for I am no hand at heights. From somewhere above us a great bird suddenly went up with a vast flutter and, with a few strokes of its powerful wings, propelled itself through the air until level with us it hovered motionless at an immense height above the stony valley. \"I\u0027m going to set you down now,\" I said to the girl. \"Lie quite still and don\u0027t move until I come back. I\u0027m going along the ledge a bit to see if it broadens out at all or if there\u0027s a cave.\" As gently as I could I put her down. The wind blew invigoratingly on the pinnacle of the crag and I hoped it would revive her. I stood and listened. No sound came from below. But I knew that until I found a spot from which we could survey the ascent we should not be safe. I edged my way along the shelf as it curved round the rock. A few steps brought me in sight of its termination. It ended in nothing; but what caught my eyes was the tall pillar chiselled out of the rock upon which the flash from my mirror had rested. Beside it was a low opening in the back wall of the cliff. The pillar was merely a high expanse of \"dressed\" stone, as the masons say, which had been carved out of the soft surface of the peak. From pictures I had seen of the images on Easter Island I knew it to be the first state of one of those uncouth effigies, relics of a departed era, which are found in more than one island of the Southern Seas. The pillar was not inscribed or carved in any way. It stood just as some native mason had left it waiting for the sculptor\u0027s hand. A touch on my shoulder; Marjorie stood at my side. \"I\u0027m a poor kind of soldier, partner,\" she said, \"to fail you at the critical moment. I was at the last gasp when you picked me up. How ever did you manage to bring me up here?\" \"Don\u0027t ask me,\" I laughed. \"I was terrified for fear you\u0027d look over and get scared....\" \"I don\u0027t mind heights,\" the girl rejoined simply, \"we live a great part of the year in our place in Wales, you know, and I\u0027ve done quite a lot of climbing in my time. Oh! Look! Did you ever see anything so wonderful?\" We were side by side on the ledge with our backs to the pillar and as she spoke she stretched forth her hand and pointed across the valley. Above the jagged crests of various isolated peaks in the foreground a gigantic solitary image raised its tall black form against the deep azure of the ocean which was spread out to the horizon. Its back set to the sea, its features, stern and enigmatic in expression, turned towards us, and clearly visible in that transparent atmosphere, it dominated the little rocky plateau on which it stood, dwarfing the tremendous blocks of stone strewn about its base. Before it, as if from a sacrificial altar, a thin spiral of black smoke slowly mounted aloft against the blue sky. It seemed to rise from the ground at the foot of the effigy. It was, in truth, a wonderful sight, a spectacle of sheer majesty. That lonely Colossus with its cruel face seemed to embody the suggestion of sinister mystery which, I had felt from the first, brooded over Cock Island.... Marjorie gave a little shudder. \"This island frightens me!\" she said. \"To think of that awful-looking image standing there gazing out across the valley for all these hundreds of years as if it were waiting for something. Somehow it reminds me of that club-footed man, so hard, so ruthless, so.... patient! Grundt makes my blood run cold!....\" He had not molested her, it appeared. When I had left her to enter our cave on the beach, men had suddenly surrounded her and carried her away to the sheds. There she had been handed to the custody of the mulatto who had locked her in the room behind the galley where I had found her. \"At meal-times,\" she added, \"they brought me out to their open-air mess in the space between the huts. No one spoke to me. But they eyed me silently, especially Dr. Grundt. He always seems to be thinking, that man, and I\u0027m sure his thoughts are wicked. And the man they call Black Pablo! He kept edging towards me and leering with his one eye. Oh! It was horrible....\" She had seen nothing of Custrin since her encounter with him in the forest. Clubfoot, she told me, had had some trouble with his men. They were grumbling at him for having let me go. The Germans, especially the blonde young officer, were particularly bitter. But Clubfoot had rounded on them and said that, as long as there were trees on the island to hang mutineers on, he would have no questioning of his authority. Somewhere in the green tangle of woods far below us a single shot rang out sharply. The report went reverberating down the valley and from the tree-tops a cloud of birds swooped up affrighted. I did not hear the flight of the bullet so I could not see that the shot was meant for us. Yet there were only Clubfoot\u0027s men on the island now. Was Grundt asserting his authority? The girl had dropped to her knees, and now seated herself cross-legged on the ground. \"If you and I are partners,\" said she, \"don\u0027t you think the time has come to take me into your confidence?\" She invited me with a gesture to seat myself by her side. I glanced down at the valley. Below us and to the left the ascending path twice wound into view. From our coign of vantage one might infallibly pick off anyone who tried to push our position from the path. Though I was inclined to think that the gang had had their fill of fighting for the day, I was glad to be in a position from which their next move must be unerringly revealed to me. I followed the girl\u0027s invitation; for I was very weary. To tell the truth, I welcomed the chance of resting quietly for a spell. I needed to think out the grave difficulties besetting us. It was clear that we could not stay where we were, for I had only five rounds of ammunition left. And Marjorie, who sat by my side, her rich brown hair blowing out in the wind, her eyes fixed dreamily on the hideous image staring sardonically across the valley at us; I had to think of her. Henceforth, any risk I took must inevitably imperil her safety.... it was a horrid thought. When would the Naomi come back? And could we risk holding out till the promised gun announced her return? She could not arrive at the earliest before the evening, I calculated. I brought out the meat and bread I had taken from the galley and we ate it together, side by side. Although the sun had not long risen, there was already a heat in its rays which warned me of what its noon-day fierceness would be. And I was keenly alive to the fact that we had no water. \"I can see by your face,\" said Marjorie suddenly, \"that you are worrying about me. And I want to be a help, not an impediment. I made you an offer of partnership once before!\" \"I know,\" I rejoined, \"but I didn\u0027t know you then....\" \"I was so anxious to help,\" she said. \"And you would tell me nothing!\" \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know much about women,\" I said. \"Major Okewood,\" exclaimed the girl, turning round and looking me full in the face, \"you surprise me!\" \"It\u0027s true....\" I began. But Marjorie laughed merrily. \"You\u0027re too delightful for words,\" she said. \"Why, my dear man, if you understood women you\u0027d have....\" She broke off hastily and added: \"There are only two kinds of men: those who say they do understand women and don\u0027t and those who admit they don\u0027t and don\u0027t. But all the same don\u0027t you think it\u0027s rather insulting to one\u0027s intelligence to find a man locking up his secrets in his heart simply because he\u0027s read or heard somewhere that a woman is not to be trusted?\" I looked at her with interest. This young girl, with her ridiculous clump of reddish brown hair, her slim straight limbs, her calm child-like eyes, made me feel like a naughty little boy being reprimanded by his mummy. \"Yes,\" I said limply. \"I suppose it is!\" For a minute her eyes encountered mine, and in them I read her reproach. She dropped them almost at once and a sort of embarrassment silenced us. Then it suddenly occurred to me that she and I were alone; I wondered to find that neither the prospect of spending the night, maybe several nights, in the company of a man of whom she knew next to nothing, nor the danger to which she was exposed, had shaken her out of her serenity. This girl was full of character. My wish, that poor man\u0027s wish which I had hardly dared to admit to myself on board the Naomi, rose to my mind with such force that I felt the blood mount to my face. But Marjorie took my hand and patted it as she might have patted a child\u0027s. \"Tell me about your mission!\" she said. I kept her hand and seated at her side in the shade of that ancient pillar, with the fresh breeze caressing our faces, I told her how Fate had put into my hands the message left by Ulrich von Hagel for Clubfoot and his gang. I described to her my efforts to unravel the cipher which I repeated to her. \"How does it go in German?\" she asked; for I had given her the English version. \"You know German?\" said I. She nodded. \"I used to have a German Fr?ulein,\" she answered. \"She was a dear old thing and as a small girl I often went over to Boppard to stay with her people. I knew German rather well.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"here goes!\" And I repeated the rhyme which had hammered its jingling measure into my brain: \"Flimmer\u0027, flimmer\u0027 viel \"Die Garnison von Kiel \"Mit Kompass dann am besten \"Denk\u0027 an den Ordensfesten \"Am Zuckerhut vorbei \"Siehst Du die Lorelei....\" I broke off suddenly. \"By Jove!\" I exclaimed. \"By—Jove!\" I have spoken of the peaks which stood up in the valley between us and the stone image. The words of von Hagel\u0027s doggerel sent my gaze roving interrogatively across the open space and presently it fell upon a tall slender rock with a smoothly rounded crest which raised itself erect in the foreground. And it dawned upon me that there was The Sugar Loaf of which von Hagel spoke. I glanced across the valley from right to left, past the image frowning through the wisp of smoke at its foot, to where other peaks raised their crests aloft to the blue sky. Suddenly I turned to Marjorie. \"If you\u0027ve been to Boppard,\" I said, \"you must know the Lorelei. Look where I am pointing and tell me if you see any rock which resembles it!\" Leaning over until her hair brushed my cheek the girl followed my pointing finger. \"Why, yes!\" she exclaimed, \"that square grey rock leaning over is rather like the Lorelei....\" At last I felt that I was within measurable distance of the end of my quest. But between me and my goal was interposed that unsurmountable four-barred obstacle, those enigmatical notes of music. I had identified the peaks, but what did they signify? What bearing had they on the hiding place of the treasure? I felt utterly nonplussed and, for the first time, discouraged. \"What does it mean?\" asked Marjorie at my elbow. \"What has the Lorelei to do with the treasure?\" I laughed rather bitterly. \"If I were a musician,\" I answered, \"I should probably be able to tell you. As I am not....\" \"Please don\u0027t be mysterious,\" the girl bade me. \"Tell me what you mean.\" I told her of the four bars of music. \"They\u0027re part of some German tune or other,\" I told her. \"It\u0027s vaguely familiar to me, but I\u0027m blessed if I can put any words to it. And I take it that the words are the thing!\" \"Can you hum the melody over to me?\" asked Marjorie. Singing is not my forte. A combination of bashfulness and a cigarette-smoker\u0027s throat produce from my larynx when I attempt to sing sounds which I have always felt must be acutely distressing to my hearers. But Marjorie listening gravely with her head on one side, made me repeat my performance. Then she said: \"But do you know you\u0027re trying to sing a song that was all the rage in Germany when I was there just before the war. Listen! I\u0027ll sing it to you!\" And in a clear young voice she sang: \"Püppchen, Du bist mein Augenstern \"Püppchen, hab\u0027 Dich zum Essen gern.\" Then she checked herself suddenly and clutched my arm. \"\u0027Püppchen!\u0027\" she said. \"Oh, partner, don\u0027t you see?\" \"No!\" I replied dejectedly. \"I confess I don\u0027t! I know that \u0027püppchen\u0027 means a \u0027doll\u0027 or a \u0027little doll\u0027 but I really don\u0027t see....\" Marjorie raised her hand and pointed a slender finger at the saturnine image on the opposite side of the valley, seen between the Lorelei on the left and the Sugar Loaf on the right. \"There\u0027s your doll!\" she said. And I knew at last that the riddle was read.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3295/90130.html","bookId":456,"book":{"id":456,"title":"The Return of Clubfoot","description":"简介： As I was sitting on the verandah of John Bard\u0027s bungalow, glancing through a two-month old copy of The Sketch, I heard the clang of the iron gate below where I sat.
