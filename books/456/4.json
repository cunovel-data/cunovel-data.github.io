{"id":39742,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV A FOOTSTEP IN THE LANE","content":"The moon had paled and a greyness in the sky, as we hurried down the hill, betokened the approach of day. At length the city had sunk to rest; the port slumbered and in the red light quarter behind the docks the laughter and the guitars were stilled. How through that maze of mean streets and lanes I found the way back to Do?a Luisa\u0027s cabin I don\u0027t know; but I expect that a kind of instinct for marking a route once traversed, which, with me, is inborn, stood me in good stead. The negro quarter was wrapped in silence. The swift rustling of a rat, a distant cock-crow from the sleeping city, were the only sounds to break the stillness of the night. At length we reached the narrow lane in which the shanty stood. It was almost dark; for the moon had gone in behind a bank of clouds and the day was not yet come. The big wooden door stood wide. Across the little yard dimly we saw the dark outline of the shack. The mud surface of the court was wet and sticky and my rubber-soled shoes slipped on it as we crossed the threshold of the enclosure. John Bard touched my arm. \"Man alive,\" he whispered, \"look at your shoes!\" I did as I was bid and recoiled in horror. The white buckskin was deeply smeared with crimson. We dashed across the yard. The shanty door stood open. Within, amid a scene of hideous confusion, the body of the beach-comber hung head downwards from the rough couch, the throat cut from ear to ear. And behind the door in another welter of blood lay the corpse of Do?a Luisa. The place was a shambles. The hut had been turned upside-down and the few poor belongings of the outcast were scattered all over the floor. The very maize cane on which his dead body lay had been tossed about. And the blood was smeared everywhere as though the murderer or murderers had brought it in on their boots. John Bard\u0027s face was anxious. \"We\u0027ll do well to clear out of here,\" he said, \"before it gets light. They mustn\u0027t find us here. Let\u0027s go out by the back and return by the way you came....\" I gladly acquiesced in his suggestion. To tell the truth, I was feeling a little sick. The fetid odours of the negro quarter reeked to heaven in the freshening morning air, and mingled with them was a suspicion of some unutterably horrid taint arising from the two corpses which had lain there all through the warm night. We had reached the threshold of the back door when suddenly a heavy footstep sounded from the front. In the absolute stillness all round the sound rang out clearly. It was as though a heavy man were stumping slowly across the hard pounded earth of the front yard. He came with a step and a stump, a step and a stump, like a lame man walking with a stick or crutches. John Bard made as though to bolt. But I restrained him. I felt I must see this mysterious visitant. And John Bard, loyal friend as he is, though he had nothing to gain by my rashness, stopped dead in his tracks and with me drew behind the cover of the back door. Through the chink between the door and jamb we surveyed the entrance to the shack. A huge black shape stood on the threshold. It was too dark within the hut to note the newcomer\u0027s features or his dress. One had only the sensation of a great form that bulked largely, immensely, in the doorway. I turned noiselessly to Bard. He divined the unspoken proposal on my lips for he shook his head curtly and his grip on my sleeve tightened. At the same moment the great form in the doorway moved and the next instant was swallowed up in the shadows of the courtyard. We heard the clip-clop of his limping step as he crossed the enclosure and, little by little, die away as he stumped up the lane. \"Smear some earth over your shoes!\" John Bard was speaking to me. Blindly I did as he bade me and rubbed dust over the damp, dark stains on the white buckskin. Then gripping me by the arm my friend ran me through the backyard and out by the door which now stood open. In the freshness of the plantation, away from the stenches of the village and the nameless taint of that house of slaughter, my senses came back to me and I felt ashamed of he rashness which might have had disastrous consequences for both of us. But, when at length we stood once more in the bungalow and Bard poured me out a stiff dose of brandy, I noticed that, contrary to his invariable rule, he had one himself as well. \"And now,\" said he, and in his voice was a note of decision, \"the sooner you leave Rodriguez, Desmond, the better for you. I don\u0027t want to appear inhospitable or I might add, the better for me too. That poor devil, Adams, is dead and you can do nothing for him by staying. You are sufficiently acquainted, I take it, with the mentality of my distinguished fellow-citizens to realise that very little fuss will be made over the untimely demise of Adams and his coloured lady. In the meantime you are in the greatest danger here. \"I don\u0027t see why I should worry,\" I argued. \"If they had known of my visit to Adams they would have raided the hut and butchered the three of us to get hold of the document. But they didn\u0027t; and they don\u0027t even know me by sight....\" \"They evidently didn\u0027t know of your visit at the time,\" remarked John Bard gravely. \"But obviously something happened after your departure to put them wise. Hence the attack on the house. You were either seen going to the house or Do?a Luisa gave you away. It looks to me as though they had only just traced the document to Adams. Black Pablo was set to watch but, after the happy-go-lucky fashion of Latin America, he whiled away the time by serenading some of the dusky belles in the vicinity and failed to observe your arrival.\" I recalled the soft laughter I had heard, mingling with the strains of the guitar in the lane, and nodded. \"You think that this fellow Black Pablo was put on guard to see that Adams did not leave the house?....\" \"Precisely,\" agreed my friend, \"while El Cojo was sent for. \"El Cojo, the head of the gang?\" \"Himself and no other.... the lame man who came to the door of the shack after the crime had been committed. In Spanish \u0027El Cojo\u0027 means \u0027the lame man,\u0027 \u0027he who goes with a limp\u0027....\" John Bard went on talking but I have no recollection of what he said. For my thoughts had flown back to another \"lame man\" who had dominated the most thrilling episode in the whole of my life, the giant and ape-like cripple, head of the Kaiser\u0027s personal Secret Service in the days of Germany\u0027s greatness, who had dogged my brother Francis and myself until he had met his end at our hands in the chateau on the German-Dutch frontier. Old Clubfoot, as men called him in his heyday, had been in his grave these four years past; yet once again I found the path of adventure barred at its outset by a great lame man. I thought of that huge figure blocking up the narrow doorway of the reeking hut and, as so often in the past, I felt welling up within me admiration for the extraordinary ingenuity of old man Destiny.... \"....This gang of El Cojo\u0027s,\" John Bard was saying impressively, leaning across the table at me, hands palms downwards before him, \"is a tremendous organisation with a network of spies as widespread and efficient as the Camorra and Mafia in Italy or the Carbonados in Portugal and Brazil. I have long suspected that there was at the head of it a man much bigger and abler than that murdering ruffian, Black Pablo, and now we have the proof of it. I know a bit about men, Desmond and that hulking dot-and-carry-one scoundrel we saw to-night gives me a damned unpleasant feeling. You mark my words; whether you were actually spotted or not they\u0027ll trace that plan to you and if you stay here, they\u0027ll get you! And I know!\" He appeared to reflect for a moment whilst I considered him with attention; for I had never before seen old John so worked up. But there is nothing like the Unknown for getting on a fellow\u0027s nerves. Then he drove his fist into his palm as if a sudden idea had struck him. \"The Naomi,\" he said; \"the very thing for you!\" \"The Naomi?\" I repeated. \"Yes. The yacht that came in last evening. She\u0027s going down to Honolulu. We ought to be able to fix it for you so they\u0027ll take you with them....\" \"What is this yacht?\" I asked. \"She belongs to Sir Alexander Garth. By George! She\u0027s a beauty, Desmond! White paint and a gold line, green and white deck awnings, everything slap up. He\u0027s a millionaire, they say!\" \"I don\u0027t know the name.\" \"We looked him up in the \u0027Who\u0027s Who\u0027 at the club to-night. He\u0027s a baronet, and a big man in cotton. J.P. and D.L. of the county. What brings him here I don\u0027t know, except that cruising to the Southern Seas seems to be a fashionable rest-cure for millionaires whose nerves have been jaded by piling up money during the war.\" \"But, see here, John,\" I expostulated, \"I can\u0027t go butting into a private pleasure cruise like this, I really can\u0027t. It isn\u0027t done, you know! And you can\u0027t expect these prosaic English folk to swallow a long yarn about my life being in danger!\" \"Desmond,\" said Bard—and now his voice was very stern. \"You can take it from me that if you don\u0027t clear out at once, you\u0027ll get your throat cut and probably mine into the bargain. There won\u0027t be a steamer for Colon for at least a fortnight. This yacht is a heaven-sent opportunity for making you lucky. If you wait for the steamer it\u0027s a ten to one chance you\u0027ll go up the gangway in your coffin neatly packed in ice! Do you get that? For the Lord\u0027s sake, burn that damned rigmarole and beat it!\" We Celts have a broad strain of contrariness in our nature which probably accounts for my strong inclination to disregard Bard\u0027s advice. But his manner was so impressive for one of his unemotional disposition that I could not but feel convinced. \"Perhaps you\u0027re right, old man,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t burn the \u0027rigmarole\u0027 as you call it, but otherwise I will follow your suggestion. But it will be on one condition and one condition only. That is, that we part here and now and that, should by any chance, your plan for my forcing my company upon the excellent cotton-spinner and his party fail, you will not associate with me or in any way acknowledge me as long as I am in the city....\" I held out my hand. But Bard laughed and put his two hands on my shoulders. \"No, no,\" he protested, \"it\u0027s not so bad as all that. I\u0027m coming down to the harbour to fix it up with Garth for you. He will probably call at the Consulate this morning any way to fetch the stores we are holding for him.\" \"John,\" said I, \"I\u0027ve dragged you far enough into this mess. It\u0027s early enough yet for me to go down to the harbour and on to that yacht without attracting much attention. So let\u0027s part here and ever so many thanks again for all your kindness....\" \"Desmond,\"—John Bard\u0027s voice trembled a little—\"I wouldn\u0027t hear of it....\" \"My dear old man,\" I said. \"I\u0027m in a proper mess and I\u0027ve no intention of pulling you into it after me. And I\u0027d like to say one thing more. You might have rubbed it in that the whole of this trouble was brought on us by my initial folly in accompanying an unknown messenger to the purlieus of the city in the middle of the night. You have never alluded to it; but I\u0027d like you to know that your forbearance did not escape me....\" I stretched forth my hand again. This time John Bard took it. \"I\u0027ll send your things down to the Consulate,\" he said; \"they can go on board with Garth\u0027s stores.\" And so, in perfect understanding, we settled it. At the verandah door I turned and said:— \"And do you think now that there\u0027s anything in Adams\u0027 story?\" \"Yes,\" my host replied, \"I do!\" Then he added, with his little indulgent smile:— \"Are you going after it?\" I shrugged my shoulders. \"I might!\" said I. But already fermenting in my brain was the germ of a great idea. The next moment the iron gate of the gardens clanged behind me and I was off at a good pace down the hill. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3295/90115.html","bookId":456,"book":{"id":456,"title":"The Return of Clubfoot","description":"简介： As I was sitting on the verandah of John Bard\u0027s bungalow, glancing through a two-month old copy of The Sketch, I heard the clang of the iron gate below where I sat.
