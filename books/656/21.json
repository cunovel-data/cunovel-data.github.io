{"id":22536,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE","content":"\u0027You must think I\u0027m in a really bad mood,\u0027 Annie said. \u0027I wish you\u0027d relax, Paul. I\u0027m not going to give you an injection. I\u0027m leaving the syringe here with you, because it\u0027s damp down here and your legs might ache quite badly before I get back. Now, we have to talk.\u0027 She settled down and told him her plan. She was drinking constantly from plastic bottles of Pepsi-Cola. She explained that she needed a lot of sugar at the moment. \u0027Listen to me. We\u0027re going to be all right if it gets dark before anyone comes to check on that policeman. It\u0027ll be dark in about an hour and a half. If someone comes sooner, there\u0027s this,\u0027 she 69 said. She reached into her hag and pulled out the policeman\u0027s gun. \u0027First I kill whoever comes, then you, then me.\u0027 Once it was dark, she said, she was going to drive the police car up to her Laughing Place, with her husband\u0027s old motor bike in the back. She could hide the car up there and it wouldn\u0027t be found for months. \u0027I\u0027d take you with me, because you\u0027ve shown that you can be a real nuisance,\u0027 she said, \u0027but I couldn\u0027t bring you back on the bike. It\u0027ll be hard enough driving on those mountain paths by myself. I might fall off and break my neck!\u0027 She laughed at her joke, but Paul said, \u0027And then what would happen to me?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry so much, Paul, you\u0027d be fine,\u0027 she replied, but he knew he wouldn\u0027t. He would die like a dog down here in the damp basement and make a meal for the rats. There was a Kreig lock on the cellar door by now and the stairs were steep anyway. There were tiny windows, high up one wall, but they were covered in dirt. \u0027So I\u0027m going to put him in his car and take him up to my Laughing Place and bury him there - him and his . . . you know . . . his bits - in the woods.\u0027 Paul said nothing. He just remembered the cows complaining from the barn and then becoming silent. Annie had left them to die and he hoped she wasn\u0027t going to forget him too. \u0027I just hope nobody comes to the house while I\u0027m away. I don\u0027t think they\u0027d hear you down here even if they came right up to the house. But I\u0027m going to put a chain across the gate from the road and hang a note on the chain saying that I\u0027ve gone away for a few days. That might stop them coming up to the house.\u0027 Annie was not taking any chances, Paul realized. She was playing \u0027Can You?\u0027 in real life, while he could only play it when he was writing books. \u0027I should be back by midday tomorrow,\u0027 she continued. \u0027I don\u0027t expect the police will come before then. They will come, 70 of course; I know that. But I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll come asking questions before then. They\u0027ll just drive along the roads, looking for his car. So if I\u0027m back by midday I\u0027ll have you back in your room before they come. I\u0027ll even let you watch me talk to them, if you promise to be good. I say \"them\" because I think two of them will come, don\u0027t yon?\u0027 Paul agreed. \u0027But I can handle two, if I need to.\u0027 She patted the handbag which held the policeman\u0027s gun. \u0027I want you to remember that young man\u0027s gun while you watch me talk to them, Paul. I want you to remember that it\u0027s going to be in here all the time I\u0027m talking to them, whenever they come - tomorrow or the day after or whenever. You can sec them, but if they see you - either by accident or because you do something stupid like you did today - if that happens I\u0027m going to take the gun out of the bag and start shooting. And remember: you\u0027re already responsible for one policeman\u0027s death.\u0027 \u0027Nonsense,\u0027 said Paul, knowing that she would hurt him for saying it. But she didn\u0027t. She just smiled her calm, mother-knows-best smile. \u0027Maybe you don\u0027t care for them, Paul. Maybe you don\u0027t care if you kill two more people. Hut if I have to kill those two policeman, I\u0027ll have to kill you and me as well, and I think you still care for yourself.\u0027 \u0027Not really, Annie,\u0027 Paul said. \u0027I don\u0027t really mind leaving this life any more.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, I\u0027ve heard that before,\u0027 she said. \u0027But as soon as you switch off their medical equipment or pick up the pillow to put it on their faces, then they struggle and try to cry out.\u0027 Hut you never let that stop you, did you, Annie? \u0027Anyway, I just wanted to tell you,\u0027 she said. \u0027If you really don\u0027t care, then when they come you can shout to them. When they come I\u0027ll meet them and they\u0027ll ask me about the young policeman. \"Yes,\" I\u0027ll say, \"he was here yesterday. He showed 71 me a picture of Paul Sheldon. I told him I hadn\u0027t seen him and then he went away.\" They\u0027ll be surprised. \"How can you be sure that you\u0027ve never seen Paul Sheldon?\" they\u0027ll ask. \"He disappeared last winter.\" I\u0027ll tell them that Paul Sheldon is my favourite author, so I\u0027d remember seeing him. I have to say that, Paul. Do you remember?\u0027 He remembered. He remembered a photograph in her album. In the picture Annie was sitting in prison while she was waiting for the jury to return to court and pronounce her guilty or innocent. Under the picture was written: Miserable? Not the Dragon Lady. Annie sits quietly and reads while she waits for the jury. And in the picture Annie was holding up her book so that everyone could see she was reading the latest Misery novel. \u0027So,\u0027 Annie went on, \u0027I\u0027ll say that the young policeman wrote all this down in his book and said thank you. I\u0027ll say that I invited him in for a cup of coffee. He refused, but he accepted a bottle of cold Pepsi, because the day was so hot.\u0027 She held up an empty bottle of Pepsi. \u0027I\u0027m going to stop and throw this in a ditch three or four kilometres up the road,\u0027 she said. \u0027But first I\u0027ll put his fingers all over it, of course.\u0027 She smiled at him - a dry smile, with no humour in it. \u0027They\u0027ll find the bottle, and then they\u0027ll know that he went past my house - or they\u0027ll think they know, which is just as good, isn\u0027t it? They\u0027ll search for him for a while, but then they\u0027ll come back. Oh, yes, they\u0027ll come back, because I\u0027m the Dragon Lady. I\u0027m the only crazy one in the area, so they\u0027ll come back, and they\u0027ll come into the house this time. But they\u0027ll believe me at first - that\u0027s the point. So we\u0027ll have some time, Paul. Maybe as much as a week.\u0027 She looked at him coolly. \u0027You\u0027re going to have to write faster, Paul.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46851.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
