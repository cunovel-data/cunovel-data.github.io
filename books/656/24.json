Can I start reading it now?\u0027 78 \u0027No, Annie, you must wait. It\u0027s important that you wait.\u0027 But she had gone blank again. He waited patiently for her to return and then repeated his answer, so that this time she would hear it. \u0027I\u0027ll leave you now,\u0027 she said. \u0027But you\u0027ll call me when you\u0027ve finished the book, won\u0027t you? I\u0027ve got some champagne in the fridge. I don\u0027t know much about wine and things, but the man at the shop said it was the best. I want us to have the best, Paul.\u0027 \u0027That sounds lovely, Annie. But there is one other thing you could do for me, to make it special.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d really like a cigarette - just one, when I finish. There were some cigarettes in my suitcase.\u0027 \u0027But cigarettes are bad for you.\u0027 \u0027Annie, do you really think I have to worry about dying from smoking now? Do you really think that?\u0027 She didn\u0027t say anything. \u0027I just want one cigarette. I\u0027ve always relaxed with a cigarette immediately after finishing a book.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 she said. \u0027But long before the champagne. I don\u0027t want to drink expensive champagne with my favourite author with all that dirty smoke in the air.\u0027 She left and a while later came back with a single cigarette and a box of matches - with only one match in it. She put them quietly on the table and crept out of the room, not wanting to disturb her favourite author. Several hours later Paul wrote the two words which every author loves and hates most: THE END. He sat back in satisfaction. Then he bent over to the loose board in the floor.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46854.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
