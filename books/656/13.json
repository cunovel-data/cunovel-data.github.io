{"id":22528,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER TWELVE","content":"The beginning of April was fine. The sun shone from a clear blue sky and it was warm enough to melt some of the snow. Mud and grass began to appear in Annie\u0027s field. Annie sometimes look Paul in his wheelchair out of the house at the back, and let him sit in the sunshine and read a book. She sang while she worked around the house, and laughed at jokes she heard on the TV. She left his door unlocked and open while she was in the house. Paul tried not to think of the snow melting and uncovering his car. The morning of the fifteenth, however, was windy and dull, and Annie changed. She didn\u0027t come into his room with his tablets until nine o\u0027clock, and by then he needed them quite badly - so badly that he nearly got some from under the mattress. Then, when she came, she was still in her night-clothes and she brought him only the tablets, no breakfast. There were red marks on her arms and cheeks, and her clothes were messy with spilled food. She dragged her feet along the corridor. Her hair was untidy and her eyes were dull. \u0027Here.\u0027 She threw the pills at him and they fell into his lap. She turned to go, dragging her feet. \u0027Annie?\u0027 She stopped without turning round. \u0027Annie, are you all right?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she said carelessly, and turned to face him. She looked at him in that same dull way. She began to pinch her lower lip between her finger and thumb. She pulled it out and twisted it, while pinching it hard. Drops of blood began to fall down her 34 chin. She turned and left without speaking another word, before his astonished mind could persuade itself that he had really seen her do that. She closed the door and locked it. He heard her sit down in her favourite chair. There was silence. She didn\u0027t switch on the TV as usual. She was just sitting there --just sitting there being not all right. Then there was a sound - a single, sharp sound which was unmistakable: she had hit herself, hard, in the face. He remembered reading that when mad people start to become deeply, seriously depressed, they hurt themselves. This signals the start of a long period of depression. He was suddenly very frightened. She hadn\u0027t returned by eleven that morning, so Paul decided to try to get into the wheelchair by himself; he wanted to try to work. He succeeded, although it hurt him a lot, and lie rolled himself over to the table. He heard the key in the lock. Annie was looking in at him and her eyes burned black holes in her face. Her right cheek was swelling up and she had been eating jam with her hands. She looked at him and Paul looked back at her. Neither of them said anything for a while. Outside, the first drops of rain hit the window. \u0027If you can get into that chair by yourself, Paul,\u0027 she said at last, \u0027then 1 think you can fill in your own stupid \"n\"s.\u0027 She closed the door and locked it again. Paul sat looking at it for a long time, as if there was something to see. He was too surprised to do anything else. He didn\u0027t see her again until late in the afternoon. After her visit work was impossible. At two in the afternoon the pain was bad enough for him to take two tablets from under the mattress. Then he slept on the bed. When he woke up he thought at first that he was still dreaming; what he saw was too strange for real life. Annie was sitting on the side of his bed. In one hand she held a glass full of Novril tablets, which she placed on the table next to his bed. In 35 In her other hand was a rat-trap. There was a large grey rat in it. The trap had broken the rat\u0027s back. her other hand was a rat-trap. There was a large grey rat in it. The trap had broken the rat\u0027s back. There was blood around its mouth, but it was still alive. It was struggling and squeaking. This was no dream. He realized that now he was seeing the real Annie. She looked terrible. Whatever had been wrong with her this morning was much worse by now. The flesh on her face seemed to hang as loosely as the clothes on her body. Her eyes were blank. There were more red marks on her arms and hands, and more food spread here and there on her clothes. She held up the trap. \u0027They come into the cellar when it rains,\u0027 she explained. \u0027I put down traps. I always catch eight or nine of them. Sometimes I find others —\u0027 She went blank then. She just stopped and went blank for nearly three minutes, holding the rat in the air. The only sounds were the rat\u0027s squeaks. You thought things couldn\u0027t get worse, didn\u0027t you? You were WRONG! \u0027- drowned in the corners. Poor things!\u0027 She looked down at the rat and a tear fell on to its fur. \u0027Poor, poor things.\u0027 She closed one of her strong hands around the rat and began to squeeze. The rat struggled and whipped its tail from side to side. Annie\u0027s eyes never lost that blank, distant look. Paul wanted to look away, but couldn\u0027t; it was disgusting, but fascinating. Annie\u0027s hand closed into a fist. Paul heard the rat\u0027s bones break and blood ran out of its mouth. Annie threw the crushed body into a corner of the room. Some of the rat\u0027s blood was on her hand. \u0027Now it\u0027s at peace,\u0027 she said, and laughed. \u0027Shall I get my gun, Paul? Maybe the next world is better for people as well as for rats - and people are almost the same as rats anyway.\u0027 \u0027Wait for me to finish,\u0027 he said. It was hard to speak; his mouth felt thick and heavy. I\u0027m closer to death than I\u0027ve ever been in my life, he thought, because she means it. She\u0027s as insane as the husband who murders his whole family before killing himself - and who thinks he is being a good husband and father. \u0027Misery?\u0027 she asked, and Paul thought - or hoped - that there was a tiny sign of life in her eyes. 37 \u0027Yes.\u0027 What should he say next? How could he stop her killing him? \u0027I agree that the world\u0027s an awful place. I mean, I\u0027ve been in so much pain these last few weeks, but -\u0027 \u0027Pain?\u0027 She interrupted him. \u0027You don\u0027t know what pain is, Paul. You haven\u0027t any idea at all.\u0027 She looked at him with contempt. \u0027No, I suppose not — not compared with you, anyway.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027But I want to finish this book. I want to see what happens to Misery. And I\u0027d like you to be here too. Don\u0027t you want to find out what happens?\u0027 There was a pause, a terrible silence for a few seconds, and then she sighed. \u0027Yes, I suppose I do want to know what happens. That\u0027s the only thing left in the world that I still want.\u0027 Without realizing what she was doing she began to suck the rat\u0027s blood off her fingers. \u0027I can still do it, Paul. I can still go and get my gun. Why not now, both of us together; You\u0027re not stupid. You know I can never let you leave here. You\u0027ve known that for some time, haven\u0027t you? I suppose you think of escape, like a rat in a trap. But you can\u0027t escape. You can\u0027t leave here . . . but 1 could go with you.\u0027 Paul forced himself to keep his eyes looking straight into hers. \u0027We all go eventually, don\u0027t we, Annie? But I\u0027d like to finish what I\u0027ve started first.\u0027 She sighed and stood up. \u0027All right. 1 must have known that\u0027s what you\u0027d want, because I\u0027ve brought you your pills. I don\u0027t remember bringing them, but here they are. I have to go away for a while. If I don\u0027t, what you or I want won\u0027t make any difference. I do things, you see . . . I go somewhere when I feel like this - a place in the hills. I call it my Laughing Place. Do you remember that I told you I was coming back from Sidewinder when I found you in the storm? I lied. I was coming back from my Laughing Place, in fact. Sometimes I do laugh when I\u0027m there, but usually I just scream.\u0027 38 \u0027How long will you be away, Annie?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve brought you plenty of pills.\u0027 But what about food? Am I supposed to eat that rat? She left the room and he listened to her walking around the house, getting ready to go. He still half expected her to come back with her gun, and he didn\u0027t relax until he heard the car disappearing up the road outside, \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46843.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
