She reappeared as soon as it was eight o\u0027clock, with two tablets and a glass of water. Paul eagerly lifted himself up on to his elbows when she sat down on his bed. \u0027At last I got your new book, two days ago,\u0027 she told him. \u0027Misery\u0027s Child. I love it. It\u0027s as good as all the others. Better, in fact. It\u0027s the best.\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 Paul said. He could feel the sweat on his forehead. \u0027Please . . . my legs . . . very painful . . .\u0027 \u0027I knew she would marry Ian,\u0027 she said, smiling dreamily, \u0027and I believe Ian and Geoffrey will become friends again. Do they? No, no, don\u0027t tell me. I want to find out for myself.\u0027 \u0027Please, Miss Wilkes. The pain . . .\u0027 \u0027Call me Annie. All my friends do.\u0027 She gave him the glass, but kept the tablets in her hand. Then she brought them towards his mouth, which he immediately opened . . . and then she took her hand away again. \u0027I hope you don\u0027t mind,\u0027 she said, \u0027but I looked in your bag.\u0027 \u0027No, of course I don\u0027t mind. The medicine -\u0027 The sweat on his forehead felt first cold and then hot. Was he going to scream? He thought perhaps he was. \u0027I see there\u0027s a typescript in the bag,\u0027 she went on. She idly rolled the tablets from one hand to the other. Paul followed them with his eyes. \u0027It\u0027s called Fast Cars. It\u0027s not a Misery novel.\u0027 She looked at Kim with faint disapproval - but it was mixed with love. It was the kind of look a mother gives a child. \u0027Would you let me read it?\u0027 7 \u0027Yes, of course.\u0027 He tried to smile through the pain. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t do anything like that without your permission, Paul, you know,\u0027 she said. \u0027I respect you too much for that. In fact, Paul, I love you.\u0027 She blushed again, suddenly. One of the tablets dropped on to the blankets. Paul grabbed at it, but she was quicker. Then she went vacant and dreamy again, \u0027Your mind, I mean. It\u0027s your mind I love, Paul.\u0027 \u0027No, please read it,\u0027 Paul said in desperation. \u0027But. . .\u0027 \u0027You see,\u0027 Annie said, \u0027you\u0027re good. 1 knew you must be good. No one bad could create Misery Chastain and breathe life into her.\u0027 Now she suddenly put her fingers in his mouth and he greedily sucked the tablets out of her hand, without waiting for the water. \u0027Just like a baby,\u0027 she said, laughing. \u0027Oh, Paul. We\u0027re going to be so happy here.\u0027 And Paul thought: I am in so much trouble here. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46834.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
