{"id":22531,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN","content":"In his dream he was stung by a bee, so at first he thought he was dreaming. \u0027Paul?\u0027 In his dream the bee was dangerous and he wanted desperately to escape. \u0027Paul!\u0027 That was no dream-voice: it was Annie\u0027s voice. He forced his eyes open. She was standing there in the shadows as if she had never been away, wearing her ugly clothes. He saw the syringe in her hand and understood that it hadn\u0027t been a bee: she had given him an injection. But what had she -? Fear came again, but his mind was too dull to feel it strongly. Whatever drug she had given him was making things unreal for him. He tried to lift his hands and it felt as if there were invisible weights hanging from them. It\u0027s the end, he thought. The end of the story of Paul Sheldon. Curiously, the thought almost made him happy. The end of the thousand and one nights. Strange, half-formed ideas kept coming into his mind as the powerful drug crept into all the corners of his brain. \u0027There you are!\u0027 Annie said. \u0027I see you, Paul . . . those blue eyes. Did I ever tell you that I think your eyes are lovely? But I suppose plenty of women have told you that - and bolder women than me.\u0027 She was sitting on the end of his bed. She bent down to check something on the floor and for a moment all he could see was her broad, strong back. He heard the sounds of something metal and something wooden - and the unmistakable sound of a box of matches. She turned back towards him and smiled. Whatever else might have happened, she was no longer depressed. That must be good, mustn\u0027t it? 47 \u0027What do you want first, Paul?\u0027 she asked. The good news or the bad news?\u0027 \u0027Good news first.\u0027 He managed a big, foolish grin. \u0027I suppose the bad news is that you don\u0027t really like the book. I tried. I thought it was going well.\u0027 She looked at him sadly. \u0027I love the book, Paul. Why do you think I asked you to fill in all the \"n\"s yourself? Because I don\u0027t want to read any more until the end. I don\u0027t want to spoil it.\u0027 Paul\u0027s drugged grin widened. If she loved the book she wasn\u0027t going to kill him - at least not yet. Annie smiled back at him, \u0027The good news,\u0027 she said, \u0027is that your car has gone. I\u0027ve been very worried about your car, Paul. I knew only a big storm would wash it away. When the snow melted in the spring the water from the mountains was enough to wash away the body of that dirty bird Pomeroy, but a car is much heavier than a man, isn\u0027t it? But the storm and the melting snow at the same time did it. Your car has gone. That\u0027s the good news.\u0027 Alarm bells rang in Paul\u0027s mind. Who was Pomeroy? Then he remembered: the young man in Annie\u0027s album. \u0027Don\u0027t pretend, Paul,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know you know about Pomeroy. I know you\u0027ve read my album. I suppose I wanted you to read it; otherwise, why would I have left it out? But I wanted to be sure - and when I came back the hair was broken.\u0027 \u0027Hair?\u0027 he said faintly. \u0027Yes, I read about it somewhere. If you think someone has been looking through your belongings you stick some hair over the drawers or the book or whatever. Then if the hair is broken or moved you know that someone has been there. Again she bent over the end of the bed. Again there were the sounds of something metal and something wooden. \u0027So I crept in this morning,\u0027 she said, \u0027as quiet as a mouse - and yes. all three hairs were broken, so I knew you\u0027d been looking at my album.\u0027 She paused, and smiled again. \u0027I wasn\u0027t surprised. I knew you had been out of the room. That\u0027s the bad news, Paul. I\u0027ve known for a long, long time.\u0027 He should feel angry or disappointed or something, he supposed, but the drug made it impossible. \u0027Anyway, we were talking about your car,\u0027 she said. \u0027Early yesterday afternoon I felt a lot better. I spent most of the time up there on my knees, praying to God; and you know, Paul, when you pray sincerely to God he always answers your prayers. I knew what I had to do. I put the special tyres on the car, for driving on ice, and drove slowly down from the hills. It was very dangerous, Paul, but I felt safe in the arms of God.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s very nice, Annie,\u0027 Paul tried to say, but the sounds were indistinct: That\u0027sh very nishe Annie. \u0027I stopped on the way down to look for your car. I knew what I would have to do if I saw it. If it was there, visible, therewould be questions, and I\u0027d be the first one they\u0027d question because they know about my past. Actually, one of the reasons I rescued you and brought you home was that you crashed there.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I parked there, in exactly the same place, when I got rid of that Pomeroy.\u0027 She slapped her hand in contempt. \u0027He said he was an artist, but he was just another dirty bird. He was hitchhiking and I picked him up. He said he was going to Sidewinder to do a job there. I let him stay here. We were lovers.\u0027 She looked at Paul, challenging him to deny it. He didn\u0027t say anything, but he didn\u0027t believe her at all. \u0027Then I found out that he didn\u0027t have a job","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46846.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
