{"id":22520,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER FOUR","content":"The next morning she brought him a bowl of soup, which was his usual food these days. She told him she had read forty pages of his typescript. She told him she didn\u0027t think it was as good as his others. \u0027It\u0027s hard to follow,\u0027 she complained. \u0027It keeps jumping from one time to another.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Paul. \u0027That\u0027s because the boy is confused. So the changes in time reflect the confusion in his mind.\u0027 He thought she might be interested in a writer\u0027s ways. \u0027He\u0027s confused, all right,\u0027 replied Annie. She was feeding him soup automatically and wiping the corner of his mouth with the tip of a cloth, like a true professional; he realized that she must once have been a nurse. \u0027And he swears all the time. Nearly every word is a swear-word.\u0027 8 \u0027That\u0027s true to life, Annie, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 Paul asked. \u0027People do talk that way in real life.\u0027 \u0027No, they don\u0027t,\u0027 she said, giving him a hard look. \u0027What do you think I do when I go shopping in town? Do you think 1 say, \"Now, give me some of that swear-word bread, and that swear-word butter\"? And does the shopkeeper say, \"All right, Annie. Here you swear-word are\"?\u0027 Her face was as dark as a thunderstorm now, and she was shouting. It wasn\u0027t at all amusing that she couldn\u0027t bring herself to say the real words; this made the situation all the more threatening. Paul lay back, frightened. The soup bowl was at an angle in her hands and soup was starting to spill out. \u0027And then do I go to the bank and say, \"Here\u0027s one big swear-word cheque and you\u0027d better give me fifty swear-word dollars\"? Do you think that when I was in court in Denver-\u0027 A stream of soup fell on to the blanket. She looked at it, then at him, and her face twisted. \u0027Now look what you\u0027ve made me do!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure you are!\u0027 she screamed, and she threw the bowl into the corner. It broke into tiny pieces and soup splashed up the wall. Paul gasped in shock. She turned off then. She just sat there for maybe thirty seconds. During that time Paul\u0027s heart seemed to stop. Gradually she came back. \u0027I have such a temper,\u0027 she confessed like a little girl. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said out of a dry throat. \u0027You should be. I think I\u0027ll finish Misery\u0027s Child and then return to the other book afterwards.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t do that if it makes you angry,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t like it when you get angry. I . . . I do need you, you know.\u0027 She did not return his smile. \u0027Yes, you do. You do, don\u0027t you, Paul?\u0027 She came back into the room two hours later. \u0027I suppose you want your stupid medicine now,\u0027 she said. 9 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Paul, and then remembered. \u0027Yes, phase.\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re going to have to wait for me to clean up this mess,\u0027 she said. \u0027The mess you made.\u0027 She took a bucket of water and a cloth over to the comer and started to clean up the soup. \u0027You dirty bird,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s all dried now. This is going to take some time, I\u0027m afraid, Paul.\u0027 Paul didn\u0027t dare to say anything, although she was already late with his medicine and the pain was terrible. He watched in horror and fascination while she cleaned the wall. She did it slowly, deliberately. Paul watched the stain disappear. He couldn\u0027t see her face, but he was afraid that she had gone blank and would stay there for ever, wiping the wall with the cloth. At last, after half an hour of growing pain, she finished. She got up. Now, thought Paul. Now give me the medicine. But to his amazement she left the room. He heard her pouring the water away and then refilling the bucket. She came back with the bucket and cloth. \u0027Now I must wash all that soap off the wall.\u0027 she said. \u0027I must do everything right. My mother taught me that.\u0027 \u0027No, please . . . the pain. I\u0027m dying.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be silly. You\u0027re not dying. It just hurts. In any case it\u0027s your fault that I have to clean up this mess.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll scream.\u0027 he said, starting to cry. Crying hurt his legs and hurt his heart. \u0027Go ahead, then,\u0027 she replied. \u0027Scream. No one will hear.\u0027 He didn\u0027t scream. He watched her endlessly lift the cloth, wipe the wall and squeeze the cloth into the bucket. At last she got up again and came over to his bed. \u0027Here you arc,\u0027 she said tenderly, holding out his two tablets. He took them quickly into his mouth, and when he looked up he saw her lifting the yellow plastic bucket towards him. \u0027Use this to swallow them,\u0027 she said. Her voice was still tender. He stared at her. \u0027I know you can swallow them without water,\u0027 she said, \u0027but 10 if you do that I will make you bring them straight back out. Please believe me when I say that I can make you do that.\u0027 He looked inside the bucket and saw the cloth in the grey water and soap floating on the surface. He drank quickly. His stomach started to move as if he was going to be sick. \u0027Don\u0027t be sick, Paul.\u0027 she laid. \u0027There\u0027ll be no more tablets fot four hours.\u0027 She looked at him for a moment with her flat. empty face, and then smiled. \u0027You won\u0027t make me angry again, will you?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I love you,\u0027 she said, and kissed him on the cheek. Paul drifted into sleep. His last conscious thoughts were: Why was she in court in Denver? And why would she want to take me prisoner? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46835.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
