{"id":22527,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER ELEVEN","content":"\u0027Well?\u0027 he asked several days later, when she interrupted him. \u0027Is it fair?\u0027 Annie sat on his bed, holding the first six chapters of the typescript. She looked a bit pale. \u0027Of course,\u0027 she said, as if they both already knew the answer - which he supposed they did. \u0027It\u0027s not only fair, it\u0027s also good. Exciting.\u0027 \u0027Shall I go on?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I\u0027ll kill you if you don\u0027t!\u0027 she replied, smiling a little. Paul didn\u0027t smile back. This common remark would once have seemed ordinary to him; when Annie Wilkes said it, it didn\u0027t seem ordinary at all. \u0027You won\u0027t have to kill me, Annie,\u0027 he said. \u0027I want to go on. So why don\u0027t you leave me to write?\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 she said. She stood up and quickly dropped the typescript on his table, and then moved away. It was as if she was afraid of being burned by him. She was thinking of him now as the famous author, the one who could capture her in the pages of his books and burn her with the heat which his words made. \u0027Would you like to read it as I write it?\u0027 he asked. Annie smiled. \u0027Yes! It would be almost like those films when 1 was young.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t usually show my work before it\u0027s all finished,\u0027 he said, \u0027but this is a special situation, so I\u0027d be glad to show it to you chapter by chapter.\u0027 And so began the thousand and one nights of Paul Sheldon, he thought. \u0027But will you do something for me?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Fill in all those \"n\"s,\u0027 he said. 29 She smiled at him with real warmth. \u0027That would make me very proud,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll leave you alone now.\u0027 But it was too late: her interruption closed the hole in the paper for the rest of the day. Early the next morning Paul was sitting up in bed with his pillows piled up behind him, drinking a cup of coffee and looking at those marks on the sides of the door. Suddenly Annie rushed into the room, her eyes wide with fear. In one hand she held a piece of cloth; in the other, some rope. \u0027What -?\u0027 It was all he had time to say. She seized him with frightened strength and pulled him forward. Pain - the worst for days - ran through his legs, and he screamed. The coffee cup flew out of his hand and broke on the floor. His first thought was that she had seen the marks on the door and now she was going to punish him. \u0027Shut up, stupid!\u0027 she whispered urgently. She tied his hands behind him with the rope, and just then he heard the sound of a car turning off the road and towards her house. He opened his mouth to say something and she pushed the cloth into it. It tasted foul. \u0027Keep completely quiet,\u0027 she said with her head close to his. \u0027I warn you, Paul. If whoever this is hears something - or even if I hear something and think he might have heard something - I will kill him, then you, then myself.\u0027 She ran out of the room and Paul heard her putting on her coat and boots. Through the window he saw an old Chevrolet stop and an elderly man get out. Paul guessed that he was here on town business, because he could think of no other reason for anyone to come. The man looked like a local official, too. Paul had often imagined someone coming to the house. In his mind there were several versions of what happened, but one thing was the same in every version: the visit shortened Paul\u0027s life. 30 Annie hurried out of the house to meet the man. Why not invite him inside, Annie? thought Paul, trying not to choke on the cloth. Why don\u0027t you show him what you keep inside the house? The man pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket and gave it to Annie. He seemed to be apologizing. She looked quickly at the paper and began to speak. Paul couldn\u0027t hear what she was saying, but he could see the clouds of mist which formed in the cold air in front of her mouth. She was talking fast and waving her finger in the man\u0027s face. She led the man a little way from his car, so that Paul could no longer see them, only their shadows. He realized that she had done it on purpose: if he couldn\u0027t see the man, then the man couldn\u0027t see him. The shadows stayed there for five minutes. Once Paul heard Annie\u0027s voice; she was shouting angrily, although he couldn\u0027t hear the actual words. They were five long minutes for Paul: the cloth in his mouth was making him feel sick. Then the man was walking back to his car, with Annie behind him. She was still taking. He turned to say something before getting into the car, and Paul could see some emotion on his face. It wasn\u0027t quite anger: he was disgusted. It was obvious that he thought she was crazy. The whole town probably regarded her as crazy and he didn\u0027t like having the job of visiting her. But you don\u0027t know the extent of her madness, do you? thought Paul. If you did, you wouldn\u0027t turn your back on her. Now the man got into the car and started to reverse towards Annie\u0027s gate. Annie had to shout even louder so that he could hear her over the noise of the engine, and Paul heard her words too: \u0027You think you\u0027re so clever, don\u0027t you? You think you\u0027re such a big wheel, helping the world to turn round. Well, I\u0027ll tell you something. Mister Big Wheel. Little dogs go to the toilet all over big wheels. What do you think about that?\u0027 When the man had driven away, Annie rushed back into the house. She shut the front door with a loud bang and Paul knew 31 that she was extremely angry. He was frightened that her anger with the man would become anger with him. She came into his room and began to walk around, waving the piece of paper in her hand. \u0027I owe them five hundred dollars\u0027 tax, he says. I haven\u0027t been paying the tax on my house, he says. Dirty tax! Dirty lawyers! I hate lawyers!\u0027 Paul choked and tried to speak through the cloth, but she didn\u0027t seem to notice. She was in a world of her own. \u0027Five hundred and six dollars!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027And they send someone out here to visit when they know I don\u0027t want anyone here. I told them. Now he says they\u0027ll take my house away from me if I don\u0027t pay soon.\u0027 She absent-mindedly pulled the piece of cloth from his mouth and Paul swallowed great mouthfuls of air in relief, trying not to be sick. \u0027My hands . . .\u0027 he gasped. \u0027What? Oh, yes. Sometimes you\u0027re such a baby.\u0027 She pulled him forward again - which hurt again - and untied his hands. \u0027I pay my taxes,\u0027 she protested. \u0027I just . . . this time I just . . . You\u0027ve been keeping me so busy.\u0027 You forgot, didn\u0027t you, Annie? You try to make everything seem normal, but you forgot. This is the first time you\u0027ve forgotten anything this big, isn\u0027t it? In fact, Annie, you\u0027re getting worse, aren\u0027t you? You\u0027re starting to get a little worse every day. Your blank periods are getting longer and happening more often. Mad people can usually manage their lives, and sometimes - as I think you know - they get away with some very nasty actions. But there\u0027s a border between manageable madness and unmanageable madness, and you\u0027re getting closer to it every day . . . and part of you knows it. Paul had a brilliant idea. \u0027I owe you my life,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I\u0027m just a nuisance to you. I\u0027ve got about four hundred dollars in my wallet. I want you to have it.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Paul. I couldn\u0027t.\u0027 She was looking at him in confusion and pleasure. Paul smiled and tried to look as sincere as possible. \u0027It\u0027s yours,\u0027 he said, \u0027You saved two lives, you know - Misery\u0027s as well as 32 mine. And you showed me that I was going wrong, writing other kinds of books. Four hundred dollars is nothing for all that. If you don\u0027t take the money you\u0027ll make me feel bad.\u0027 \u0027Well, if you say so . . . All right,\u0027 she said, with a shy smile. \u0027They all hate me, you know. They\u0027re all against me, Paul.\u0027 \u0027So you must pay their dirty taxes today,\" Paul said. \u0027That\u0027ll show them. I bet there arc other people in the town - the Roydmans, for example - who haven\u0027t paid their taxes for years. They\u0027re just trying to make you go, Annie.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I\u0027ll pay their stupid taxes,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027ll teach them a lesson. I\u0027ll stay here and spit in their eyes!\u0027 She went and fetched his wallet. The money was still in it, but everything which showed that it belonged to Paul Sheldon had gone. He remembered going to the bank and taking the money out. The man who had done that had felt good. He had just finished Fast Cars and was feeling younger than his age. I lis legs were not useless sticks. He gave Annie the money and she bent over and kissed him on the lips. He smelled the foul smell which came from the rotten places inside her. \u0027I love you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Would you put me in the wheelchair?\u0027 he said. \u0027I want to write.\u0027 \u0027Of course, my dear,\u0027 she replied. Then she left to go to town. While she was out Paul unlocked the door - he now had four hairpins under the mattress, next to the tablets - and tried to clean the marks on the door-frame. Three weeks passed. Although there were times when he felt close to tears. Paul was on the whole curiously happy. He was enjoying writing the book. Usually the most he could write was two or three pages a day, but he was sometimes writing twelve pages of Misery\u0027s Return in a day! He was living such a regular and healthy life. Annie was cooking him three meals a day. He wasn\u0027t drinking any alcohol or smoking cigarettes; he suffered from none of his usual headaches. He woke up in the morning, ate breakfast, worked, had lunch, slept for a while, worked 33 again, ate again and then slept like a baby all night long. There was nothing else for him to do - nothing to interrupt the routine. Ideas for the book were flooding into his mind. Can you? Yes, I can. Then the rain came, and everything changed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46842.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
