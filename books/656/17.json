{"id":22532,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN","content":"When he quietened down she asked: \u0027How many times did you leave the room?\u0027 The knife. Oh, no, the knife. \u0027Twice. No, three times. I had to get some water yesterday. But I wasn\u0027t trying to escape, Annie. I\u0027m writing a book.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t try the telephone. I suppose, or investigate the locks. No, you were such a good little boy.\u0027 \u0027Of course I did.\u0027 He was beginning to wish she would go 51 away, The drug was making him partly tell the truth, but he also badly wanted to sleep. \u0027How many times did you go out?\u0027 \u0027I told you. Three times.\u0027 \u0027How many times?\u0027 Her voice was rising. \u0027Tell the truth.\u0027 \u0027I am telling the truth. Three times!\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re treating me like a fool.\u0027 \u0027Annie, I swear —\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, you swear. People who tell lies love to swear. Let me tell you, Mister Clever. I stretched hairs all over the place — upstairs, downstairs, out in the barn — and a lot of them have gone.\u0027 Annie, how could I have gone upstairs? How could I have gone outside to the barn? But she didn\u0027t give him time to protest; she went straight on. \u0027So you tell me that you left the room only three times, Mister Clever, and I\u0027ll tell you that you\u0027re the fool, not me. How many times?\u0027 \u0027Three.\u0027 \u0027Once for medicine.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Once for food.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027And once for water.\u0027 \u0027Yes. Yes, I told you.\u0027 She reached into her pocket again and brought out the butcher\u0027s knife. \u0027I looked under your mattress just before I gave you the injection for your operation, and see what I found.\u0027 What did she mean by \u0027operation\u0027? He was suddenly sure that she intended to use the knife on him. \u0027But you didn\u0027t get it out of the kitchen, did you? You only went for medicine, food and water. The knife must have flown here all by itself. What kind of fool do you think I am, Paul? How many times?\u0027 \u0027All right, all right. I got the knife when I went for water. But, Annie, what did you mean by \"operation\"?\u0027 \u0027I think you went seven times,\u0027 she said. \u0027Yes, if that\u0027s what you want to bear, I left the room seven times,\u0027 Paul said. He was angry now, because be was frightened. Then she started to speak softly and he began to drift, almost into sleep. \u0027Do you know what the British used to do to workers in their diamond mines who tried to escape, Paul?\u0027 \u0027They killed them, I suppose,\u0027 he said, still with his eyes closed. \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 she replied. \u0027That would be like throwing away a whole car just because some little thing went wrong. No, they still needed them for the mines, so they just made sure that they couldn\u0027t run away again. They performed a little operation, Paul, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do to you. It\u0027s for your own good. Please try to remember that.\u0027 The ice-cold wind of fear blew over Paul\u0027s body and his eyes flew open. She got up from the bed and pulled back the blankets so that his legs and feet were uncovered. \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027No . . . Annie . . . whatever it is you\u0027re planning, we can talk about it, can\u0027t we? Please . . . you don\u0027t have to . . .\u0027 She bent over and picked up some things from the floor. When she straightened up she was holding an axe in one hand and a blowlamp in the other. The blade of the axe shone dully. She bent down again and picked up the box of matches and a bottle of dark liquid. \u0027Annie, no!\u0027 he screamed. \u0027Annie, I\u0027ll stay here, I promise. I won\u0027t even get out of bed. I\u0027ll do whatever you say!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 she said, and her face now had that blank look. Some part of his mind which was not filled with fear knew that when this was over she would remember hardly anything at all about it. This was the woman who graduated in 1966 and now, in 1987, told him that she had been a nurse for only ten years. 53 She probably hardly remembered killing all those babies. He suddenly knew that this was the axe she had used on Pomeroy. He continued to scream. He tried to turn over, as if he could get away from her, but his broken legs and drugged body refused to obey. Annie poured some of the liquid on to his left ankle and some more on to the blade of the axe. The smell reminded Paul of doctors\u0027 offices in his childhood. \u0027There won\u0027t be much pain, Paul. It won\u0027t be bad.\u0027 \u0027Annie Annie oh Annie please no please don\u0027t Annie I swear to you I\u0027ll be good I swear to Cod I\u0027ll be good please give me a chance to be good ANNIE PLEASE LET ME BE GOOD -\u0027 \u0027Just a little pain, Paul, and then this unpleasant matter will be behind us.\u0027 She threw the empty bottle over her shoulder, her face completely blank now. She seized the axe in both hands and moved her feet so that she was standing firmly on the floor. \u0027ANNIE OH PLEASE PLEASE DON\u0027T HURT ME!\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 she said, and her eyes were gentle. \u0027I\u0027m a nurse.\u0027 The axe whistled through the air and buried itself in Paul Sheldon\u0027s left leg just above the ankle. Pain exploded in his body. Blood splashed her face and the wall. He heard the blade rub against the bone as she pulled it free. He looked down and saw his toes moving. Then he saw her raising the axe again; drops of blood were falling off it. Her hair was hanging loosely around her blank, calm face. He tried to pull back in spite of the pain, but he realized that, although his leg was moving, his foot wasn\u0027t. All he was doing was widening the cut, making it open like a mouth. He realized that his foot was joined to his leg by only a little flesh - and then the axe whistled down again. It cut through his leg and sank deep into the mattress. Annie pulled the axe out of the mattress and threw it on to the ground. She picked up the blowlamp and lit it with a match. 54 She seized the axe in both hands and moved her feet so that she was standing firmly on the floor. \u0027There isn\u0027t time to sew all this up,\u0027 she explained. \u0027You\u0027re losing blood too fast.\u0027 She turned the flame on to the stump of his leg. Fresh pain seized Paul\u0027s body. Sweet-smelling smoke drifted up to his nose. \u0027Nearly finished,\u0027 she said. The blankets were burning now. Annie bent down again and picked up the yellow bucket. She poured water over the flames. Paul screamed again. Annie stood and looked at him. \u0027You\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 she said. Her eyes seemed to move round the room aimlessly. It was a relief for her to notice something on the floor. \u0027I\u0027ll just get rid of the rubbish,\u0027 she said. She picked up Paul\u0027s foot. The toes were still moving. She started to walk out of the room and then turned and said, \u0027Don\u0027t blame me for this. It was your own fault.\u0027 Paul dived into the cloud, hoping that it would bring death this time, not just unconsciousness. He dimly heard himself screaming and smelled his burned flesh. As his thoughts faded, he thought: Dragon Lady!\u0027 Kill you! Dragon Lady! Kill you! Then there was nothing except nothing. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46847.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
