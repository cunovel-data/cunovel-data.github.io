She made him sit up and she gave him some drops of water to heal his cracked lips and dry mouth. He woke up and tried to swallow a lot of water from the glass she was holding, but she only let him have a little at a time. \u0027Annie, the medicine, please . . . now,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027Soon, dear, soon,\u0027 she said gently. \u0027I\u0027ll give you your medicine, but first you have a job to do. I\u0027ll be back in a moment.\u0027 \u0027Annie, no!\u0027 he screamed as she got up and left the room. When she came back he thought he was still dreaming. It seemed too strange to be real. She was pushing a barbecue stove into the room. \u0027Annie, please. I\u0027m in terrible pain.\u0027 Tears were streaming down his face. \u0027I know, dear. Soon.\u0027 She left and came back again with the typescript of Fast Cars and a box of matches. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, crying and shaking. \u0027No.\u0027 And the thought burned into his mind like acid: everyone had always said that he was crazy not to make copies of his typescripts. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, her face clear and calm. She held out the matches to him. \u0027It\u0027s foul, and it\u0027s no good. But you\u0027re good, Paul. I\u0027m just helping you to be good.\u0027 \u0027No. I won\u0027t do it.\u0027 He shut his eyes. When he opened them again she was holding a packet of Novril in front of them. \u0027I think I\u0027ll give you four,\u0027 she said, as if she was not talking to him but to herself. \u0027Yes, four. Then you\u0027ll feel peaceful and the pain will go. I bet you\u0027re hungry, too. I bet you\u0027d like some toast.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re bad,\u0027 said Paul. \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what children always say to their mothers. But mother knows best. I\u0027m waiting, Paul. You\u0027re being a very stubborn little boy.\u0027 13 \u0027No, I won\u0027t do it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not sure that you\u0027ll ever wake up if you lose consciousness again,\u0027 she remarked. \u0027I think you\u0027re close to unconsciousness now.\u0027 One hundred and ninety thousand words. Two years\u0027 work. But more importantly, it was what he saw as the truth. \u0027No.\u0027 The bed moved as she got up. \u0027I can\u0027t stay here all day. I hurried back to see you, and now you behave like a spoiled little boy. Oh well,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027I\u0027ll come back later.\u0027 \u0027You burn it.\u0027 he shouted. \u0027No, it must be you.\u0027 When she came back an hour later he took the matches. He remembered the joy of writing something good, something real. \u0027Annie, please don\u0027t make me do this,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s your choice,\u0027 she answered. So he burned his book - a few pages, enough to please her, to show her that he was good. Then she pushed the barbecue out again, to finish the job herself. When she came back she gave him four tablets of Novril and he thought: I\u0027m going to kill her. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46837.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
