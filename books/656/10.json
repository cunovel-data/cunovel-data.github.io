{"id":22525,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER NINE","content":"He was filled with the most extreme terror he had ever known. and he felt as guilty as a child who has been caught smoking a cigarette. He rolled the wheelchair out of the room as quickly as he could, pausing on the way only to look and make sure that nothing was out of place. He aimed himself straight at his bedroom door and tried to go through it at speed, but the right wheel crashed into the door-frame. Did you scratch the paint? his mind shouted at him. He looked down, but there was only a small mark - surely too small for her to notice. He heard the noise of her car on the road and then turning in towards the house to park. He tried to move the wheelchair gently through the door without hurrying, but again he had to hold on to the frame and pull himself through it. At last he was in the room. She has things to carry, he told himself. It will take her time to get them out of the car and bring them to the house. You have a few minutes still. He turned himself round, grabbed the handle of the door and pulled it nearly shut. Outside, she switched off the car\u0027s engine. Now he had only to push in the tongue of the lock with his finger. He heard a car door close. The tongue began to move - and then slopped. It was stuck. Another car door shut: she must have got the groceries and paper out of the passenger seat. 24 He pushed again and again at the lock, and heard a noise inside the door. He knew what it was: the broken bit of the hairpin was making the lock stick. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he whispered in desperation and terror. \u0027Come on.\u0027 He heard her walking towards the house. He moved the tongue in and out, in and out. but the broken pin stayed in the lock. He heard her walking up the outside steps. He was crying now, sweat and tears pouring together down his face. \u0027Come on . . . come on . . . come on . . . please.\u0027 This time the tongue moved further in. but still not far enough for the door to close. He heard the sound of the keys in her hand outside the front door. She opened the door and shut it. At exactly the same time the lock on Paul\u0027s door suddenly cleared and he closed his door. Did she hear that? She must have. But the noise of the front door covered the noise of his door. \u0027Paul, I\u0027m home,\u0027 she called cheerfully. \u0027I\u0027ve got your paper.\u0027 He rolled over to the table and turned to face the door, just as she fitted her key into the lock. He prayed that the broken pin would not cause any problems. It didn\u0027t. She opened the door. \u0027Paul, dear, you\u0027re covered in sweat. What have you been doing?\u0027 she asked suspiciously. \u0027I think you know, Annie. I\u0027ve been in pain. Can I have my tablets now?\u0027 \u0027You see,\u0027 she said. \u0027You really shouldn\u0027t make me angry. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll learn, and then we\u0027ll be very happy together. I\u0027ll go and get your pills now.\u0027 While she was out of the room Paul pushed the packets of Novril which he had taken as far as he could under the mattress of his bed. They would be safe there as long as she didn\u0027t turn the mattress. She came back and gave him three tablets, and within a few minutes he was unconscious. He\u0027d had six tablets now and he was exhausted. When he woke up, fourteen hours had passed and it was snowing again outside. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46840.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
