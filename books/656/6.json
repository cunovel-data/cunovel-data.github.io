{"id":22521,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER FIVE","content":"Two days later she came into his room early in the morning. Her fact was grey. Paul was alarmed. \u0027Miss Wilkes? Annie? Are you all right?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 She\u0027s had a heart attack, thought Paul, and the alarm was replaced by joy. I hope it was a big one. She came and stood over his bed, looking down at him out of her paper-white face. Her neck was tense and she opened her hands and then closed them into tight fists, again and again. \u0027You ... you . . . you dirty bird! she stammered. \u0027What? I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 But suddenly he did understand. He remembered that yesterday she was three-quarters of the way through Misery\u0027s Child. Now she knew it all. She knew that Ian and Misery could not have children; she knew that Misery gave birth to Geoffrey\u0027s child and died in the process. \u0027She can\u0027t be dead!\u0027 Annie Wilkes screamed at him. Her hands opened and closed faster and faster. \u0027Misery Chastain cannot be dead!\u0027 11 \u0027Annie, please . . . She picked up a heavy jug of water from the table next to his bed. Cold water spilled on to him. She brought it down towards his head, but at the last second turned and threw it at the door instead of breaking his head open. She looked at him and brushed her hair off her face. Two red marks had appeared on her checks, \u0027You dirty bird,\u0027 she said. \u0027Oh, you dirty bird, how could you do that: You killed her.\u0027 \u0027No, Annie, I didn\u0027t. It\u0027s just a book.\u0027 She punched her fists down into the pillows next to his head. The whole bed shook and Paul cried out in pain. He knew that he was close to death. \u0027I didn\u0027t kill her!\u0027 he shouted. She stopped and looked at him with that narrow black expression - that gap. \u0027Oh no, of course you didn\u0027t. Well, just tell me this, then, Mister Clever; if you didn\u0027t kill her, who did? Just tell me that. You tell lies. I thought you were good, but you\u0027re just dirty and bad like all the others.\u0027 She went blank then. She stood up straight, with her hands hanging down by her sides, and looked at nothing. Paul realized that he could kill her. If there had been a piece of broken glass from the jug in his hand, he could have pushed it into her throat. She came back a little at a time and the anger, at least, was gone. She looked down at him sadly. \u0027I think I have to go away for a while,\u0027 she said. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be near you. If I stay here I\u0027ll do something stupid.\u0027 \u0027Where will you go? What about my medicine?\u0027 Paul called after her as she walked out of the room and locked the door. But the only reply was the sound of her car as she drove away. He was alone in the house. Soon the pain came.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46836.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
