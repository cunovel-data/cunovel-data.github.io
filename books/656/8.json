{"id":22523,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER SEVEN","content":"When he woke up from his drugged sleep he found himself in a wheelchair. He realized that she was very strong: she had lifted him up and put him in the wheelchair so gently that he had not woken up. It hurt to sit in the wheelchair, but it was nice to be able to see out of the window; he could only see a little when he was sitting up in bed. The wheelchair was in front of a table by the window of his room. He looked out on to a small snow-covered farm with a barn for the animals and equipment. The snow was still deep and there was no sign that it was going to melt yet. Beyond the farm was a narrow road and then the tree-covered mountains. He heard the sound of a key in the lock. She came and fed him some soup. 14 So he burned his book - a few pages, enough to please her, to show her that he was good. \u0027I think you re going to get better, she said. \u0027Yes, if we don\u0027t have any more of those arguments, I think you\u0027ll get healthy and strong.\u0027 But Paul knew she was lying. One day his car would be found. One day someone — a policeman perhaps - would come and ask her questions. One day something would happen which would make Annie Wilkes frightened and angry. She was going to understand that you can\u0027t kidnap people and escape. She was going to have to go to court again, and this time she might not leave the court a free woman. She was going to realize all this and be afraid — and so she was going to have to kill Paul. How long was it before the snow melted? How long before his car was found? How long did he have to live? \u0027I bought you another present, as well as the wheelchair,\u0027 she was saying. \u0027I\u0027ll go and get it for you.\u0027 She came back with an old black typewriter. \u0027Well?\u0027 she said. \u0027What do you think?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s great,\u0027 he said. \u0027A real antique.\u0027 Her face clouded over. \u0027I didn\u0027t get it as an antique,\u0027 she said. \u0027I got it second-hand, it was a bargain, too. She wanted fortyfive dollars for it, but 1 got it for forty because it has no \"n\".\u0027 She looked pleased with herself. Paul could hardly believe it: she was pleased at buying a broken old typewriter! \u0027You did really well,\u0027 he said, discovering that flattery was easy. Her smile became even wider. \u0027I told her that \"n\" was one of the letters in my favourite writer\u0027s name.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s two of the letters in my favourite nurse\u0027s name,\u0027 replied Paul, hating himself. \u0027But what will I write on this typewriter, do you think?\u0027 \u0027Oh, Paul! I don\u0027t think - I know! You\u0027re going to write a new novel. It\u0027ll be the best yet. Misery\u0027s Return!\u0027 Paul felt nothing, said nothing; he was too surprised. But her face was shining with great joy and she was saying: \u0027It\u0027ll be a book just for me. It\u0027ll be my payment for nursing you back to health. The only copy in the whole world of the newest Misery book!\u0027 16 \u0027But Annie, Misery\u0027s dead.\u0027 \u0027No, she\u0027s not. Even when I was angry at you I knew she wasn\u0027t really dead. I knew you couldn\u0027t really kill her, because you\u0027re good.\u0027 \u0027Annie, will you tell me one thing?\u0027 \u0027Of course, dear.\u0027 \u0027If I write this book for you, will you let me go when I\u0027ve finished?\u0027 For a moment she seemed uncomfortable, and then she looked at him carefully. \u0027You talk as if I was keeping you prisoner, Paul.\u0027 He didn\u0027t reply. \u0027I think,\u0027 she said, \u0027that when you\u0027ve finished you should be ready to meet other people again.\u0027 But she was lying. She knew that she was lying, and Paul knew she was lying too. The day he finished this new novel would be the day of his death. She started locking the door of his room whenever she left it. Two mornings later she helped him into his wheelchair and fed him a bigger breakfast than usual. \u0027You\u0027ll need your strength now, Paul. I\u0027m so excited about the new novel.\u0027 He rolled over to the table by the window - and to the waiting typewriter. Thick snow was falling and it was difficult to recognize objects outside. Even the barn was just a snow-covered lump. She came into the room carrying several packets of typingpaper. He saw straight away that the paper was Corrasable Bond and his face fell. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he said quickly. \u0027Something is the matter,\u0027 she said. \u0027Tell me what it is.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d like some different paper if you could get it.\u0027 \u0027Different from this? But this is the most expensive paper there is. I asked for the most expensive paper.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t your mother ever tell you that the most expensive things are not always the best?\u0027 17 \u0027No, she did not. What she told me, Mister Clever, is that when you buy cheap things you get cheap things.\u0027 She was defensive now and Paul guessed that she would get angry next. Paul was frightened, but he knew that he had to try to control her a little. If she always won, without any resistance from him, she would get the habit of being angry with him, and that would be worse. But his need for her and for the drug made him want to keep her happy; it look away all his courage to attack her. Annie was beginning to breathe more rapidly now, and her hands were pumping faster and faster, opening and closing. \u0027And you\u0027d better stop that too.\u0027 he said. \u0027Getting angry won\u0027t change a thing.\u0027 She froze as if he had slapped her, and looked at him, wounded. \u0027This is a trick,\u0027 she said. \u0027You don\u0027t want to write my book and so you\u0027re finding excuses not to start. I knew you would.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s silly,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Did I say that I was not going to start?\u0027 \u0027No, but . . .\u0027 \u0027I am going to start. Come here and I\u0027ll show you the problem.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Watch.\u0027 He put a piece of the paper into the typewriter and wrote: \u0027Misery\u0027s Return\u0027 by Paul Shcldon\u0027. He took the paper out and rubbed his finger over the words. The words immediately became indistinct and faint. \u0027Do you see?\u0027 \u0027Were you going to rub every page of your typescript with your finger?\u0027 The pages rubbing against one another would be enough.\u0027 \u0027All right, Mister Man,\u0027 she said in a complaining voice. \u0027I\u0027ll get your stupid paper. Just tell me what to get and I\u0027ll get it.\u0027 \u0027But you must understand that we\u0027re on the same side.\u0027 18 \u0027Don\u0027t make me laugh.\u0027 she said sarcastically. \u0027No one has been on my side since my mother died twenty years ago.\u0027 \u0027You can think what you like,\u0027 he said. \u0027At any rate you must believe that I\u0027m on the book\u0027s side. If I type it on Corrasable Bond, in ten years\u0027 time there\u0027ll be nothing left for you to read.\u0027 \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll go now.\u0027 Paul suddenly remembered that it was time for his medicine soon and he began to get nervous. Had he gone too far? Would she disappear for hours and hours? He needed his medicine. \u0027Tell me what kind of paper to get,\u0027 she said. Her face had turned to stone. He told her the names of some good kinds of paper. She smiled then - a horrible smile. \u0027I\u0027ll go and get your paper,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know you want to start as soon as you can, since you\u0027re on my side -\u0027 These last words were spoken with terrible sarcasm. \u0027So I\u0027m not even going to put you back into your bed. Of course it will hurt you to sit in the wheelchair for so long at first. Perhaps the pain will be so great that you have to delay starting to write. But that\u0027s too bad. I have to go. because you want your precious, stupid, Mister-Clever special paper.\u0027 Suddenly her stony face seemed to break into pieces. She was standing at the door on her way out, and she rushed across the room at him. She screamed and punched her fist down on to the swollen lump which was Paul\u0027s left knee. He threw his head back and screamed too; the pain streamed out from his knee to every part of his body. \u0027So you just sit there.\u0027 she said, her lips still pulled back in that horrible grin, \u0027and think about who is in charge here, and all the things I can do to hurt you if you behave badly or try to trick mc. You seem to think I\u0027m stupid, out I\u0027m not. And you can cry and shout all you want while I\u0027m away, because no one will hear you. No one comes here because they all think Annie Wilkes is crazy. They all know what I did, although the court did say that I was innocent. There wasn\u0027t enough evidence, you see.\u0027 19 She walked back to the door and turned again. He screamed again because he expected another rush and more pain. That made her grin more widely. She left the room, locking the door behind her. A few minutes later he heard the roar of her car engine. He was left with his tears and his pain. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46838.html","bookId":656,"book":{"id":656,"title":"Misery","description":"Storyline: \n Paul Sheldon, a writer of historical romances, is in a car accident; rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes, he slowly realizes that salvation can be worse than death.
