{"id":82720,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The Fine Arts building is situated on the outskirts of campus. Its large circular architecture is reminiscent of an igloo if, in fact, an igloo was designed to stand seven-stories tall.\\n\\n I stumble into the giant studio in which the \"study of the human body\" is conducted, and after experiencing countless miniature desks that progressively seemed to get smaller throughout the day, a cavernous open space is a welcome change of pace. Benches are laid out in lieu of a miniaturized workspace with easels situated in front of each one. A charcoal pencil lies at the lip of the unit, along with an eraser that looks as though it\u0027s made from a giant wad of grey gum.\\n\\n After spending over four hundred dollars on less than five books for only two of my classes, I\u0027m hoping the accessories list for this class won\u0027t break the bank. My scholarship strictly covered tuition, so books, and my non-existent dorm, are the only things my mother is taking a loan out for at the moment. I\u0027m pretty sure it isn\u0027t going to thrill her to know she\u0027s spiraling into debt for coloring supplies. Although, technically, the loan is mine since I promised I\u0027d pay back every dime.\\n\\n The thin-lipped girl from \"Professor Elton\u0027s\" class sits two seats over to the left. Perfect. She\u0027ll probably be moved to overanalyze my work, and all roads of critical interpretation will inevitably lead to the fact I gave love the middle finger. And, really? Who the hell cares about my opinion? Well, apparently, she does.\\n\\n A girl with a svelte red coat zips in and fills the space between us. Already, I like her for acting as a buffer between me and Miss I Will Find Love and it Will Prosper. Let\u0027s see who\u0027s so hot on love after a few volatile divorces and a bitter custody battle that spans states or, God forbid, countries. One day she\u0027ll add divorcee to her personal roster of achievements and will mark my words as the only truth she\u0027s ever known. Of course, my mother never referred to herself as a divorcee, she simply said she was \"out on parole.\" And the whole custody battle never materialized for her either since technically both parties would have to want the child for those evil shenanigans to ensue. My father was far too busy procreating with the candlestick maker to deal with the family he left an entire state behind.\\n\\n The girl in the crimson coat turns and gives a curt smile, so I take the initiative.\\n\\n \"Kendall.\" I offer her a quick handshake. Everyone at Garrison has been so nice. Back home, life was all about hard looks and keeping to yourself, but here, everyone feels like family. \"Liberal arts.\"\\n\\n \"Blair Lancaster.\" She pulls her cheeks back without a smile. \"Journalism, but photography is my passion.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s something strangely familiar about her, and I just can\u0027t seem to place it.\\n\\n A loud shuffling comes from the front as an older woman makes her way to the center of the room. She wears a long damask coat with a vomit-inspired color palate and layers and layers of beaded necklaces as though she robbed the accessories department at the mall and decided to don all the loot at once. There\u0027s an overall bohemian appeal to her, and innately I know this is Professor Webber. Her wiry red hair sprays out in every direction, and it\u0027s not until she turns my way do I realize she\u0027s taken liberty with cosmetics that should be restricted exclusively to Broadway plays and Halloween. She hands out a syllabus without so much as a hello, and I gawk at the list of essential supplies.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to need a storage unit to house all this,\" I muse. \"Let alone make nine trips from the bookstore to lug everything.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me about it.\" Blair cuts a glance my way. \"But I bet a pretty girl like you has a nice strong boyfriend to help out.\"\\n\\n I make a face before turning the paper around and gasp. The list goes on for another entire page.\\n\\n \"This is going to cost a fortune,\" I say, mostly to myself. \"She is aware most of us have yet to outfit ourselves with a six-figure income.\"\\n\\n Blair scoffs. \"You\u0027d think the only thing we really need, to sketch a bunch of nude models, is a number two pencil.\"\\n\\n \"Nude?\" I swallow hard. I can\u0027t do nude. I\u0027ll laugh, or cry, or run out of the room screaming. I\u0027ll have human private parts permanently seared to my inner psyche, and who knows where this will take my nightmares?\\n\\n \"What did you think this was?\" She tucks her chin in and gawks at me, appalled by my naivete.\\n\\n \"Um art...\" I take in a quick breath. Shit. Study of the human body literally translates into drawing the human form? \"I thought it was statues and stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\" She picks up her pencil and points over to the center of the room where a middle-aged man and woman emerge without much fanfare, outfitted in thin purple robes.\\n\\n Oh crap.\\n\\n I have a feeling their bare legs and arms are all signs of overexposed things to come. They slip off their makeshift kimonos and reveal a tidal wave of flesh before neatly folding their robes as if it were perfectly sane to do remedial household chores in the freaking nude with a live audience of newly emancipated minors.\\n\\n They\u0027re naked!\\n\\n Naked.\\n\\n I turn away as if I\u0027ve just witnessed a horrible car accident complete with gallons of blood and severed limbs only it\u0027s miles of wrinkled skin and sunspots in places where the sun should never ever shine.\\n\\n I sneak another quick peek.\\n\\n Bits and pieces!\\n\\n Bits and pieces!\\n\\n Shit! Shit! Shit! I knew I should have read the class description a little more thoroughly. I was so worried about not getting a full load that I glossed over the specifics. And the fact I was a transfer student meant I would be left with the crappy classes the rest of the student body didn\u0027t care for if I didn\u0027t act fast. I thought for sure I made safe choices, unlike the dicey decisions I\u0027ve engaged in since my arrival, like asking my newfound \"Professor\" to tutor me in the fine art of one-night stands - and for damn sure I wasn\u0027t gunning to stare at geriatric penises for an hour straight, three times a week, in the name of art of all things.\\n\\n \"You can stop freaking out,\" Blair whispers. \"He\u0027s completely turned the other way.\"\\n\\n I peer over and confirm her theory. He\u0027s older with a hairy back and a furry ass to match. I don\u0027t really mind all the fur, seeing that it creates a simian effect, and that sort of takes the edge off the whole naked human thing. To his left sits an equally garmentless woman, woefully seasoned by time. Her heavily puckered face boasts a thousand wrinkles that wink in and out as she frowns. Her copper hair is in need of a touch-up at the roots as evidenced by the four inches of silver sprouting from her scalp. And I\u0027m betting she\u0027s had enough experience with the Unhappy Hair and Nail Salon to know to stay the hell away from that place. Her skin is dutifully leathered, leaving her unusually smooth and perky breasts to glow like lanterns in contrast to the rest of her.\\n\\n \"God, it\u0027s like her boobs never aged,\" I whisper to Blair.\\n\\n \"I bet half the boys in the class are hitting DEFON five with their erections right about now,\" she sneers, and we share a laugh.\\n\\n \"They should\u0027ve mentioned the arousal factor as a disclaimer for the class. Not that I\u0027m even slightly aroused.\"\\n\\n \"Not with that beefcake you\u0027ve got lying around.\" She glides her pencil across her paper with a marked aggression.\\n\\n Beefcake? She probably has me confused with someone else. Technically, I\u0027m not with Cruise, although he does more than qualify for the beefcake category.\\n\\n Professor Webber scuttles over. \"Start with the model closest to you.\" She leans in over my shoulder, inspiring me to pick up my pencil and quickly sketch out something that loosely resembles a cat. \"I\u0027d like the models to rotate positions.\" She booms over at the two human skin sacs, and they shift in their seats.\\n\\n I wait until she scissors on by before leaning into Blair.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hope he doesn\u0027t offer us the full frontal,\" I say, attempting to sketch out his form. He\u0027s hunched over and his head is tilted to the side. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d swear he were coming to the conclusion this was an egregious error in judgment.\\n\\n \"You act like you\u0027ve never seen it before.\" She gives a disbelieving look.\\n\\n My mouth opens to say something, but a shy smile cinches up my lips, instead.\\n\\n I suppose it\u0027s odd to find a virgin in the masses, so I don\u0027t volunteer the fact I\u0027m one of the defamed mythological creatures. Instead, I happily trace out the half-moon spread in front of me and try not to dwell on the fact he\u0027s slightly adjusted himself and now I can see his belly. I simply won\u0027t look below the fold and safely avert all trauma.\\n\\n \"You know they pay a fortune for these models,\" she purrs.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sure they\u0027re volunteers.\" I\u0027m quick to shoot down her fiscally unsound theory. \"There are probably miles of perverts willing to ingrain their junk into our delicate grey matter. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the nudists on display are having some heightened sexual experience on our behalf. I once watched this special about people who got off looking at feet all day long. Swear to God, every time I see a man glance at my stilettos, I run the other way.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re funny.\" She says it dry like she doesn\u0027t really mean it. \"But I happen to know for a fact that the art department at Garrison pays two hundred bucks a pop to anyone who wants to strut their stuff.\" She shrugs. \"It beats flipping burgers. The catch is, you\u0027re only allowed once a semester.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to do it?\" I\u0027m completely intrigued, and for a brief moment, I imagine her perched on one of those cold steely chairs sans the paper-thin robe.\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" She looks to the ceiling a moment. \"How about you? I bet it\u0027d more than cover the cost of the art supplies. You\u0027d practically make money on the deal.\"\\n\\n Two hundred dollars? Forget the art supplies, I could pay Cruise for room and board. Take him to dinner for a change.\\n\\n \"Well, I was sort of thinking of getting a job at Starbucks.\" True story. Plus that way I could hang out with Ally and sip lattes for a few hours each day, and it wouldn\u0027t feel like work at all.\\n\\n \"At minimum wage?\" She balks. \"This is practically a semester\u0027s worth of paychecks in one short hour. It almost seems too good to pass up. She probably doesn\u0027t have any spaces left, though.\"\\n\\n The elderly gentleman shifts just enough to expose us to more of his goodies, then I see it.\\n\\n Gah! I close my eyes tight and slowly peer from around the side of the easel. I was half-hoping he\u0027d be cleverly holding a book or a magazine or, hell, even a cigar to cover up his spare appendage, but dear God almighty, he is loud and proud. Well, actually...not so loud, more like a whisper. It\u0027s sort of a nub - dehydrated at that, and no bigger than a fun-sized candy bar. Are they really that tiny? Dear God, it\u0027s almost invisible. Lauren said it was like a banana, so I\u0027m actually sort of disappointed. And for sure the Storm Trooper theory just went out the window. Maybe he needed the money to get one of those prosthetic jobs? Or maybe he had it hacked? You hear about all kinds of pissed off wives who go after their cheating husbands with a hatchet. Or maybe it was just your run-of-the-mill not-so-fictitious motorcycle accident.\\n\\n The visual assault goes on for an hour solid, and to my horror both the male and female models stand around afterwards speaking to the students like it was some twisted social mixer with an optional dress code.\\n\\n \"So, are you going to talk to the professor?\" Blair incites the two-hundred-dollar question once again.\\n\\n \"Doubtful. I don\u0027t have the guts to do something like that.\"\\n\\n She pumps her shoulders. \"Two hundred dollars can make someone pretty brave. Besides, it\u0027s easy cash.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to do it?\" I fully examine her for the first time. She\u0027s pretty in general. Her mid-length hair is perfectly curled and sprayed into position, making it impervious to the constant windstorms that reside outside these walls. She wears a simple strand of pearls and perhaps a little too much foundation in a shade that gives her an unnatural orange glow.\\n\\n \"I will if you will,\" she offers.\\n\\n \"Maybe I will,\" I say.\\n\\n Blair escorts us over to Professor Webber and fills her in on the fact we\u0027re willing to expose our youthful flesh in exchange for two hundred hard ones. She\u0027s quick to pull out her planner at the prospect of two potentially nude co-eds.\\n\\n \"Only a couple more female slots left. I\u0027ve got next Monday and the following Friday wide open.\" She looks up at us impressed by our decision to bare it all in the name of artistic enlightenment. For a stunt like this I should be guaranteed a B in the class for Baring it all. But I\u0027m gunning for the A, so it really doesn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n Blair looks over at me nervously. \"I\u0027ll take the following Friday.\"\\n\\n \"So I guess it\u0027s Monday for me.\" That gives me almost a week to chicken out of the idea. \"Wait, Monday the nineteenth?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. Is that a problem?\" Webber\u0027s fuchsia lips pull into a line.\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not a problem.\" It\u0027s my birthday.\\n\\n I\u0027ll simply be wearing the same outfit that I did twenty-one years ago on that very day - my birthday suit.\\n\\n I come home to find Cruise still in his suit jacket, his wire-rimmed glasses. God its as if he was a total fake these past few weeks and now his real self has emerged as some perverted academic.\\n\\n \"Professor Elton,\" I say as I walk past him and pull a bottle of water from the fridge. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. Am I to call you master? I can\u0027t remember. I haven\u0027t quite memorized the syllabus yet.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re upset?\" He bleeds a nefarious grin as if this pleased him on some level. His eyes secure themselves over me with that get in my bed seductive stare.\\n\\n \"Why would I be upset? I\u0027m always pleasantly surprised to learn the person guiding me in the fine art of physical debauchery is also employed as faculty at the school in which I\u0027m attending. I guess that makes you legit.\" I don\u0027t smile, laugh, or leave any room for doubt concerning my slightly ticked disposition.\\n\\n God. It just occurred to me he\u0027s probably been using me for his thesis this entire time. No wonder he offered to document my journey. I\u0027ve unwittingly become exhibit K for \"Kenny.\"\\n\\n \"So did I score a place on your thesis?\" I ask point-blank. \"If an expose on my soon-to-be departed virginity is going to be made available for publication, I should probably be alerted to the fact. Unless, of course, you\u0027re aware of some legal loophole that will exempt you from any litigious endeavors I might throw your way.\" As if I would ever sue Cruise. Well, maybe for being too damn sexy.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve yet to document your \u0027soon-to-be-departed-virginity.\u0027\" His lids close halfway, letting me know he can make my virginity depart a whole hell of a lot sooner than I bargained for. And the way he\u0027s leering at me, I might be open to the idea. \"I wasn\u0027t planning on mentioning you in my thesis, Kenny.\" He presses out a dry smile. \"And, as much as I like to consider my foray in fornication as field study on some level, I\u0027ve collected more than my fair share of data. I\u0027m turning in the keys to the carnal kingdom.\"\\n\\n Turning in the keys? Maybe Cruise Elton is boyfriend material, or maybe he just wants me to believe he is. This is all probably a ruse in the name of continuing his promiscuous blind study.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too bad.\" I strut in front of him with an air of false confidence. \"Rumor has it you hold a black belt in arousing the female anatomy.\" Did I just say that?\\n\\n A husky laugh escapes his throat as he makes his way over.\\n\\n My stomach cinches at the thought of Cruise using me all along as some sort of immoral barometer.\\n\\n \"So,\" I whisper as he warms my senses with his cologne, \"I guess once I start sleeping around, I\u0027ll be tearing down all sorts of gender barriers.\" I say in a lame attempt to spice up my resume in the event he reneges and labels me Slut Number Three or something equally degrading. \"I mean, women get a horrible reputation for sleeping around, and men get called a player, which basically amounts to a term of endearment. I guess you can say I\u0027m striving for fornicating equality.\" God, you\u0027d think I was angling for a prized position in his pornographic term paper.\\n\\n \"Fornicating equality.\" Cruise comes in close with his eyes heavily lidded as if he had a serious boner to contend with, and he were about to recruit me in on the alleviating efforts. \"I think we should advance your training.\" He rasps it out low while breathing an invisible fire over my skin.\\n\\n \"I suppose this is where the sexual syllabus comes in handy.\" I tug him in by the collar and do my best to get him to kiss me. \"Which of the many perverted points would you like to try out first? Master and servant? Professor and student?\"\\n\\n His cheek pulls back, and his dimple depresses, approving of my scholarly seduction.\\n\\n \"I was thinking something more along the lines of show and tell,\" he whispers, stepping in until his body warms mine.\\n\\n For a second I think of telling him all about my adventures in art class, but he wraps a solid arm around my waist and the moment passes.\\n\\n Cruise Elton looks beyond gorgeous in his scholarly suit and glasses, and that embarrassing incident which took place in his classroom comes flooding back to me. I can\u0027t believe I managed to hang myself with a noose crafted from the finer points of love of all things, in front of a jury of my peers and my scorching-hot professor, which reminds me, I\u0027m still a little miffed at the big scholastic reveal.\\n\\n \"Show, or tell?\" My head rolls back involuntarily, and I snap out of the spell of seduction he\u0027s busy casting. \"Neither.\" I break loose from his embrace and take off down the hall.\\n\\n \"Where you going?\"\\n\\n \"To bed.\"\\n\\n \"What about me?\" It comes out a plea on his behalf of his blossoming crotch.\\n\\n \"You can take a cold shower.\"\\n\\n The alarm clock blinks mockingly at me, two a.m.\\n\\n It\u0027s so freaking cold I\u0027m about ready to jump in the refrigerator to warm myself. Honest to God, I\u0027m beginning to think this whole broken heater thing is a ruse to land me on his mattress. And God knows I\u0027ve thought long and hard about hopping into Cruise Elton\u0027s bed tonight, pride be dammed.\\n\\n So what if he didn\u0027t confess to being my professor? He probably thought it was funny. I bet he had a good laugh printing up that secret syllabus rife with perversion.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure the \"Art of Whoredom\" was meant to give me a good chuckle and not at all allude to the pact I entered into with Satan himself. Not that Cruise is Satan. He\u0027s more of a sexy alien being who\u0027s rumored to have a penis the size of a lightning rod and the superpower to make women scream with pleasure on three different occasions in a very short span of time.\\n\\n My body writhes at the prospect. I close my eyes and envision Cruise pouring those molten hot kisses all over my body, his searing hands traveling at the speed of light, then dipping down in all the right places.\\n\\n A rustling sound emits from behind the dresser.\\n\\n I freeze and cease breathing to hone in on the mystery noise.\\n\\n A loud scratching comes from the wall - and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, IT\u0027S TRAMPLING IN THIS DIRECTION!\\n\\n I let out a muffled scream and bring my knees to my chest so fast I knock the air out of my lungs.\\n\\n Shit! Shit! Shit!\\n\\n The undeniable pitter-patter of vermin feet shuffling over the hardwood floor electrifies the room.\\n\\n I bolt for the door only to smack into it at a hundred nose-breaking miles per hour.\\n\\n \"Shit!\"\\n\\n Locked!\\n\\n I jog in a spastic manner while fiddling with the handle in the event the gigantic mutant rats decide they want to scamper up my legs en route to gnawing off my face. Honest to God, if I lose my virginity to a fucking sewer dweller, I\u0027m going to scream all the way back to California.\\n\\n I break out of the rat tank and make a run for Cruise\u0027s bedroom. Thankfully, his door is wide open, and I manage to avert a second unfriendly run-in with pine that most likely would have ensured emergency rhinoplasty.\\n\\n \"What the hell?\" Cruise jumps up on his elbows as I dive under the covers. He lifts the comforter, and a seam of moonlight falls over his bewildered, more than slightly gorgeous face. \"Kenny?\"\\n\\n I let out a breath. \"Is roll call really necessary?\" On second thought, this is Cruise.\\n\\n I scoot into him as close as humanly possible in the event the vermin takeover decides to spill into his quadrant of the house. Cruise lets out a warm breath over my neck as he spoons alongside me, cradling me with his strong, bare arms.\\n\\n Gah! What if this was all some evil ploy to land me in his bed naked? Of course, I\u0027m not naked, but I\u0027m willing to bet good money (that I\u0027m currently deficient in at the moment) that Cruise Elton is.\\n\\n I reach down and touch his equally bare leg, thus confirming my theory and pull away from his person as if he were on fire.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re naked.\" It comes out accusingly as though he planned it all along.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t bite,\" he purrs, reeling me back by the waist.\\n\\n \"I bet if I ask real nice...\" It comes out sarcastic because we both know he\u0027s not above a caustic orthodontic assault if the situation warranted it.\\n\\n \"In that case, I\u0027ll do anything you want.\" He nuzzles his face into my neck, and I can feel his stubble grazing against my skin, his soft lips as they pull along in a slow hot line. \"Are you wearing a jacket?\" He pulls back the covers just enough to reveal my odd selection of nighttime accouterments.\\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027m wearing a jacket - and a sweater, and a T-shirt, a pair of sweats, and tights, and two pair of freaking socks. That\u0027s what happens when you move to the Ozarks. You wear your closet to bed, so you don\u0027t cryogenically freeze overnight.\"\\n\\n \"But think of how well preserved you\u0027ll be in twenty years.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re phenomenally funny, Professor Elton.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m an ass.\" A heated breath escapes his lungs.\\n\\n Something in my chest loosens at his well-timed, self-depreciatory remark - and just when I was gearing up to discount him to the playboy rack once again.\\n\\n He rolls onto his back, and I carefully take him in.\\n\\n The room glows the faintest shade of blue, and thanks to the moon and all its reflective glory, there\u0027s way too much light for comfort. I stare down at his body, his rippling abs, the hard V that sits just below his waist. The sheets artfully cover his telephone pole, and I breathe a sigh of relief. Knowing me, I would probably run screaming and land in bed with the six-foot rat taking up residency on the other side of the wall.\\n\\n Who am I kidding? With Cruise lying here like the Sultan of Seduction, it\u0027s almost too much to bear.\\n\\n \"What brings you for a visit?\" He runs his gaze down my ridiculous state of dress. Perfect. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m the least sexiest woman to have ever graced his bed.\\n\\n \"The rats of Massachusetts have gathered in my room for a state-wide conference,\" I whisper in the event their tiny ears perk up at attention and they decide to migrate over. \"You, my friend, have an infestation of the vermin variety.\"\\n\\n \"Every rat in Massachusetts has congregated in your bedroom?\" His left dimple goes off, mocking me, and suddenly I find his vexing good looks annoying as hell.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" I say accusingly. \"And I bet you\u0027ve been planning it all along.\"\\n\\n He belts out a laugh that startles me.\\n\\n \"You got me.\" He holds out a hand. \"I had a big meeting with all the rodents in the neighborhood and orchestrated the entire event. I\u0027ve got an alligator working his way through the sewage pipes as we speak.\"\\n\\n \"No way.\" I cover my ears. \"If I listen for one more minute, I\u0027m going to pee standing up for the entire next year.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m teasing. I assure you the throne is still a safe place to rest on your laurels.\" Cruise sits up and pulls me to my knees. \"Clothes\" - he drills into me with those lucent blue eyes - \"on or off?\"\\n\\n My heart beats erratic, and my mouth runs dry. With everything in me I want to say off, but the only thing I\u0027m able to squeeze through my vocal cords is a choking sound.\\n\\n \"I heard off,\" he whispers, unzipping my jacket and removing it from my person. He cinches a smile as he lifts my sweater and T-shirt from me in one slick move. My arms stay frozen in the air as he grazes over my bare chest with his eyes. He gives a tug at my sweats, and I wrap my arms around his neck as he peels them away.\\n\\n He looks at me, unsure of what to do with my underwear then runs his thumbs inside the elastic, and his breathing picks up at a quickened pace.\\n\\n His warm hands round out my bottom and I gasp at his touch.\\n\\n Cruise Elton strips the underwear from my body, and I don\u0027t do a damn thing to stop him.\\n\\n Cruise\\n\\n The moonlight rinses out the room in a blue wash, sanitizing us from the trappings of reality. Everything feels dreamlike in this altered state. I try not to lose it as this erotic fairytale unfurls around me with Kenny playing a starring role as the princess.\\n\\n Kenny didn\u0027t say a word as I peeled off her clothes. She wasn\u0027t exaggerating when she rattled off the clothing inventory a moment ago. Every last thread was present and accounted for.\\n\\n It\u0027s too bad about that pest control problem she\u0027s having.\\n\\n Best two dollars and ninety-nine cents I\u0027ve ever spent. The lady at the pet shop thought I should purchase at least three, babbling something about the social nature of field mice - and who was I to refute her theory?\\n\\n Kenny shivers as we lie side by side, so I pull her in, touch her soft skin against mine, and everything in me pumps to life.\\n\\n A part of me wants to apologize for not fixing the heater, but the truth is I managed to fix it Christmas morning. I thought for sure she\u0027d crave a little body heat by now. If I didn\u0027t buy the damn rats, we\u0027d probably have frostbite to contend with by midterms.\\n\\n I lie next to her, trying to steady my breathing, and for the first time in a long while I\u0027m unsure of what to do next.\\n\\n \"Boy, you took everything off, swift as a magician,\" she marvels.\\n\\n \"Practice makes perfect.\" Shit. I\u0027m not sure if bragging about how many times I may or may not have disrobed a woman is a good thing right about now. Besides, this isn\u0027t any other woman - this is Kenny.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m naked,\" she whispers as if alerting me to some shameful secret. I pull the covers over the two of us and nestle her bare bottom into my stomach.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t tell if you won\u0027t.\" I twist my hips away from her in the event I accidentally introduce her to my hard-on and send her running for weaponry. She\u0027s got to know I\u0027ve got one, right?\\n\\n \"So now what?\" She eases into me until her back fuses against my chest.\\n\\n I close my eyes and drink down her warmth, her amazingly fucking soft skin - the way her bare chest rests on my arm and sears me with pleasure.\\n\\n \"You make the next move, Kenny.\" I trace out her ear with my lips. God, I hope she moves in the right direction.\\n\\n She spins around and takes a deep breath. Her hands land over my chest, and she moves her fingers in soft smooth circles.\\n\\n \"Show me what to do,\" she whispers. \"I\u0027ll do whatever you want.\"\\n\\n Whatever I want.\\n\\n I swallow hard as I pull her in, and this time my bodily protrusion greets her by gliding against her thigh. Kenny\u0027s dark hair stains the room like a shadow, and her pale features glow, soft and luminescent like a tissue-covered lamp.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so beautiful.\" I press a kiss over her cheek and linger. Kenny would do anything I wanted. I could have her right now. I could burry myself inside her, put an end to this aggressive build-up brewing inside me once and for all and explode with relief from the pressure. But Kenny deserves to have someone say those magic words to her, one of which is the very word she declared war against in class this morning. I suppose I\u0027m a big enough asshole to take her anyway, screw good morals and integrity but I can\u0027t - not Kenny.\\n\\n \"I think tonight\u0027s lesson is snuggling,\" I say, gently rolling her into me until we\u0027re spooning again.\\n\\n \"Snuggling?\" She burrows her hair into my neck, scented with flowers and vanilla, and her skin burns an erotic hole right through me. I close my eyes, taking in the ecstasy and the misery as if she were writing a poem over me with her flesh.\\n\\n I let out a dull moan and feel the vibrations hum through her body as if we were the perfect conduits.\\n\\n \"Snuggling,\" I whisper in her ear. \"Once you have your way with all those hundreds of guys, you might want to catch a breather after. Maybe catch some Z\u0027s.\" Just the thought of her bare skin touching anyone else\u0027s is enough to send me in a rage.\\n\\n \"Oh, right.\" There\u0027s a marked disappointment in her voice. Like maybe she wanted me to take advantage of her, but was too shy to ask.\\n\\n Tonight\u0027s endeavors are entirely up to her. If she wants, she could still turn this ship around, navigate my dick into the harbor it so desperately longs to dock in. I have a condom at the ready. God knows my entire existence is crying out, screaming at every cell in her body to want me as bad as I want her.\\n\\n But Kenny doesn\u0027t make a move.\\n\\n And neither do I.\\n\\n I hold Kenny all through the night, watching as the moon radiates its beams over her like a love song. I would spend every night like this if she let me. If I\u0027m lucky, the mice will breed, and she\u0027ll never want to be two feet away from me. But I don\u0027t want our first time to be the result of manipulation on my part.\\n\\n In fact, I want to put it off until after I tell her exactly how I feel.\\n\\n And hopefully, she\u0027ll feel the same way, too.\\n\\n The next afternoon at the gym, I decide to share a few details with Cal without consulting my better judgment.\\n\\n \"You let her decide what to do, and she laid there like a limp rag?\" Cal extends his hands, and the weights shift to the left. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"No - she let me decide. And I decided not to. Besides, that isn\u0027t what she wants.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s not what she wants. That\u0027s precisely why she didn\u0027t ask for it. She\u0027s probably gay. Face it, you\u0027ve got the wrong anatomy.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not gay. She\u0027s just young, sweet, and innocent. She needs to be in a committed relationship.\"\\n\\n \"You tell her how you feel?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell are you waiting for? Those three little words have been uttered time and memoriam in order to secure young, sweet, \u0027innocent\u0027 ass.\" He takes the weights and hoists them onto the bracket. \"Man up already, would you? I\u0027m getting frustrated listening from the sexually deprived sidelines. If I wanted to experience a dry season, I would focus on my own sex life.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I will man up.\" I pluck the towel that perpetually hangs from his neck and wipe the sweat off my face.\\n\\n \"Guess who came in yesterday and purchased a membership for the year?\" Cal sits on the bench across from me with that I\u0027m-not-shitting-around expression he gets during tax season.\\n\\n I don\u0027t need to play twenty questions to know its Blair. \"What the hell is the deal with her? She\u0027s at Garrison, too.\"\\n\\n \"She told Lauren things didn\u0027t work out with her and lover boy. She says she\u0027s back for the long haul - that she wishes she never left. Rumor has it she\u0027s got her sights set on a familiar old boyfriend - or was it fiance?\"\\n\\n \"Nope, not fiance.\" I get up and head out of the room. \"She didn\u0027t say yes.\"\\n\\n And, after meeting Kenny, I\u0027ve never been happier. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1/page-10.html","bookId":1870,"book":{"id":1870,"title":"Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1)","description":"Storyline: Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1) \\n What happens when two people who don’t believe in love, happen to fall madly into the most beautiful relationship they could ever imagine?
