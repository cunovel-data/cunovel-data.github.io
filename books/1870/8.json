{"id":82718,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"After Zumba, my limbs rebel and quietly petition to secede from the union of my torso. Okay, not so quietly. Every muscle in my body is on fire and rioting in protest to my sudden faux interest in fitness. I hit Starbucks afterwards as a show of affection to my poor earthly frame. I thought about asking Cruise to join me on my quest for the perfect cup of Joe, but I\u0027d hate for him to think I\u0027m clingy and needy. The last thing I want him to feel around me is like he can\u0027t breathe. But God, how I\u0027d love to smother him - preferably with my chest. Snow covers the ground in smooth, sparkling sheets, a visual treat that I\u0027m in no way prepared for. It\u0027s as if the landscape of my heart magically transformed into a fairytale much like this new world I\u0027ve touched down in. Cruise is the sparkling magic. He\u0027s adhered himself to that secret place inside me that I once denied existed. He\u0027s molded himself perfectly over my heart, my soul, my marrow. And now I can never let go. How will I ever tell him the truth? That I don\u0027t want twenty boys on speed dial - that I only want one. And that he just so happens to be the one in question. Carrington glows a resplendent shade of lavender, dressed in a winter wonderland that up until now, I had only seen in movies. I don\u0027t know what possessed my mother to pack up on a whim and move clear across country - trade paradise for smog and traffic. The fact my grandmother passed away around the same time she graduated might have played into it, but still, now that I see how nice everyone is here, and how stunning the scenery is, I never want to go back to California. Although, I guess if she didn\u0027t hit the West Coast, she would never have met \"the loser surfer\" she hooked up with and spawned my brother, and me. I glance inside Starbucks and the line looks incredibly long, but I venture in anyway. The thick scent of roasted coffee lights up my senses. God, I love this smell. If this out of body experience I\u0027ve been enjoying with Cruise had a fragrance, this would definitely be it. They should have a coffee named after him - Kisses with Cruise. I\u0027d drink it down by the pitcher - get on my knees and let them pour it down my throat like a beer bong. A group of cackling girls walk in behind me, and I\u0027m quick to secure a place in line. I glance over the counter and don\u0027t see any sign of Lauren or Ally. Honestly, I can\u0027t remember which one works here. I hope Lauren\u0027s okay. Last I saw her, she looked heartbroken over the idea her boyfriend might be cheating. A vision of Cruise with that girl in the thigh-highs he almost took home that first night shoots through me, and a wild pang of jealousy cinches my stomach. Just the thought of him touching her, his oven-hot hands searing over her flesh the way they did mine makes my heart drop like a stone. I shake the thought away and distract myself by counting out the people ahead of me. If they each take five minutes, then I\u0027ll safely be here a solid hour. \"Next!\" A friendly voice calls from over the counter and Ally waves at me. The line moves briskly now that two baristas are at the helm, and I step over to her in less than ten minutes. \"How\u0027s it going?\" \"Great. I can\u0027t get over how gorgeous the world looks covered with snow.\" I dig out my wallet. \"Venti, iced mocha.\" \"Iced huh? You really are from California.\" She leans in. \" Hey, that girl in the corner over there...\" I follow her gaze to the back where a teenage girl sits. She has a tissue pushed into her face, and it looks as if she can\u0027t stop crying. \"That\u0027s Cruise\u0027s sister, Molly,\" she whispers. \"Maybe you can see what\u0027s got her so broken up. She\u0027s been sobbing for the last half-hour.\" I take in a breath at the sight of her. \"Oh, I totally will. I know how it feels to be crapped on by kids at school. I bet she\u0027s dealing with some serious bullying issues. High school is nothing but a hotbed of bitches.\" Ally belts out a laugh. \"I\u0027ll catch you at school tomorrow, where there will be very few bitches, I promise.\" She writes something down on a napkin and slides it toward me. \"Call me when you\u0027re free, and we\u0027ll get together.\" It takes another few minutes for my coffee, and all the while, I inspect Molly from afar. She\u0027s stunning with her dark blond hair, her pale smooth skin - gorgeous doe eyes. My heart breaks seeing her back shudder as she sheds her not-so-silent tears. I take up my drink and make my way over, nervous at the prospect of crashing her tear fest but totally dying to meet her and hopefully make her feel better. \"You mind?\" I point down at the empty seat beside her - half afraid she\u0027ll bolt now that I\u0027m here. \"Nope.\" She moans and drops the wad of tissues to the table like she\u0027s making a statement. Her heavy-scented perfume creates a toxic cloud in the vicinity, sandalwood mixed with unripe fruit, something just this side of glorified body odor. Maybe it\u0027s not people upsetting her. Maybe it\u0027s the fragrance offense she\u0027s committing. \"I\u0027m Kendall,\" I offer. \"I\u0027m actually staying with your brother.\" She looks much prettier up close, and here I thought that was impossible. \"Is everything okay?\" \"Brayden Holmes is a dick.\" She announces it like a fact, and her cheeks depress with an impression of a smile. \"Boy trouble,\" I say it mostly to myself. If it were pissy girls I could\u0027ve given her sound advice, all of which I\u0027ve thought long and hard about but never truly implemented. But people with hanging appendages were involved, and seeing that I\u0027ve never handed my heart to anyone on a silver platter, I don\u0027t have the first clue how to help her. \"It\u0027s over, so there\u0027s really not a problem.\" She spits it out with a viral level of angst reserved for high school girls the world over. And judging by her visceral reaction, it is so not over. \"Can I ask what happened?\" I can\u0027t help but feel I\u0027ve just dived in over my head. She probably caught him looking at someone, and now she\u0027s heartbroken. \"He tricked me into sleeping with him, then dumped me for some slut named Tracy Schaffer.\" \"Holy shit!\" I bounce back in my seat. \"We need to tell Cruise. He needs to beat the living crap out this... this... Brayden person.\" I\u0027m panicked at the thought of someone taking advantage of his little sister like that. And I had no idea we were going \"all the way\" in our conversation or I may have opted to forgo the meet and greet for another time, like after she clawed \"Brayden\u0027s\" eyes out and was staring down the barrel of a prison sentence. No wait. Preventative measures need to be taken to ensure neither she nor Cruise land behind bars. Once cooler heads prevail, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll think up a way to inflict bodily harm to the jackass without leaving forensic evidence behind. She snatches my wrist so quick she nearly knocks my coffee off the table. \"There\u0027s no way in hell we\u0027re telling Cruise anything.\" She grits it through her teeth. \"He\u0027ll know what a loser I am, and then he\u0027ll tell my mom, and they\u0027ll both kill me.\" She heaves into a spontaneous sob, and for a second, I wonder if it\u0027s all an act. \"Of course they\u0027re not going to kill you.\" They are so going to kill her. \"Did you use protection?\" \"I\u0027m on the pill.\" Her eyes enlarge as I writhe in front of her. \"You\u0027re on the pill?\" I\u0027m horrified by this. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to be able to keep all these secrets from Cruise. \"Yup. In fact, I just ran out. You think you can give me a ride to the free clinic? It\u0027s all the way downtown and I\u0027ll probably freeze if I try to hoof it.\" \"I...\" Fuck. Should I be giving her a ride? \"I guess.\" I hope to God it\u0027s me Cruise doesn\u0027t kill. The Carrington free-clinic is situated in the seediest part of the downtown district. Two derelicts seek shelter in the alcove of the entry, and one of them has decided to spell his name on the wall with a creative spray of urine. I\u0027m quick to usher Molly through - ready and willing to implement my ninja moves should he decide to get creative in other ways with the disgusting hose in question. We land inside and I let go of a breath I didn\u0027t know I was holding. The interior is a dingy grey, the color of dead skin. A row of plants on the counter have all wilted to yellow wisps as the sick and the desperate for birth control gather en masse in the tiny Petri dish of a room. I\u0027m sure sixteen different strains of the flu are merging in our lungs as we step deeper into the hotbed of infestation. Molly yanks me in by the jacket. \"Are you sleeping with my brother?\" she asks, almost as an afterthought. \"No.\" I pull my arm back. Grabby little thing. \"Molly, you don\u0027t have to sleep with someone to have a relationship with them.\" That doesn\u0027t change the fact I\u0027ve made it my singular goal in life to bed Cruise Elton ten different ways before Valentine\u0027s Day. That\u0027s a personal ambition I don\u0027t plan to make public anytime soon, especially not to his seventeen-year-old sister. \"Sex isn\u0027t a sport.\" A hurt look sweeps across her face. \"I do it cause I like it.\" She struts over to the front desk fueled with anger and attitude. I pull up behind her as she writes her name down on the roster. \"Did you like the public boo-hoo fest you held in Starbucks?\" I ask. \"Because in case you haven\u0027t figured it out, the asshole at point-A led to the bawling at point-B.\" Maybe not the kindest tactic I could have employed, but something tells me Molly here isn\u0027t the dainty flower she wants me to believe she is either. She wrinkles her nose. \"Look, I like Brayden. He\u0027s special.\" She rolls her eyes like he\u0027s really not. \"This thing he has with Tracy Tramp-Stamp Shaffer will blow over. It always does.\" \"Oh my God, he\u0027s done this before?\" I take her in with her watery-blue eyes, her trembling chin like she might lose it right here in front of an entire waiting room of people infected with sore throats and STDs. Molly doesn\u0027t say a word; she just stalks off and takes a seat in the back. \"Ma\u0027am, would you mind signing in?\" The gal behind the counter holds out a pen. \"There\u0027s a line forming behind you.\" \"Oh.\" I glance back at the angry mob waiting to accost me if I don\u0027t move out of the way. The pill? Should I be on the pill? Cruise and those heady kisses spiral through me, and I\u0027m numb just thinking about them. Yes, I should very much be on the pill. I jot my name on the roster and find a seat next to Molly. My phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u0027s a text from a number I don\u0027t recognize. Cruise here - set up a double date for tonight at seven. That OK? Double date? Everything in me warms at the thought of officially \"dating\" Cruise. For sure I made the right decision to get on the pill. Better than OK~! I can\u0027t wait to take my relationship with Cruise to the next level. And dating, well, I guess that throws my experiment out the window. I\u0027m totally fine with that. I didn\u0027t really like lying to him to begin with. \"So what do you think of my brother\u0027s deformity?\" Molly smirks before relaxing into an exaggerated sad puppy face. She\u0027s a peach, this one. \"What deformity?\" If Cruise is deformed, every man on this planet should be so lucky. \"You mean he didn\u0027t tell you about his accident?\" \"What accident?\" A rush of heat explodes in my chest at the thought of anything happening to Cruise - past or present. \"He got his balls lopped off after eating it on a motorcycle when he was sixteen. Don\u0027t worry, they saved one on ice and reattached it. He can have kids and stuff one day when he\u0027s ready to pollute the world with his seed. Too bad it chopped his dick in half, though. Horrible disaster.\" She clicks her tongue to annunciate her false sense of pity. The memory of that bulge in his jeans comes to mind, and my face floods with heat. God, if that was half, he must have been the size of a snake. I swear it was as long as my arm, and I thought that was a deformity. Not that I believe one word out of his little sister\u0027s not-so-precious mouth. The only \"horrible disaster\" around here is Molly needing to be on the pill in the first place. The nurse calls Molly and I to the back at the same time, and we each get stowed away in our own closet-like rooms. I take off my clothes and ready myself for a check-up. I secretly hate the gynecologist. I hate having myself sodomised in the name of medicine and vaginal wellbeing. I lie back and examine the photos of some bodybuilder strewn across the wall. They\u0027re all signed and everything. His frame looks freakishly large, and the muscles bulge from his body like a cloud made of flesh as if someone had blown them up like balloons. I try to imagine him lying over me, crushing me with his truck-like weight. Rumor has it, pumping their muscles up like that is lethal to the size of their joystick. A gentle knock erupts as the door slides open, and a tall, handsome man with a fake bake comes in flashing an ultra-bright smile. He\u0027s completely buffed out. His muscles balloon from his shirt, and I can practically make out the curves from under his coat, and hey... It\u0027s the same guy from the pictures. \"Is that you?\" I marvel pointing at the testament to all things steroid. \"That\u0027s me.\" He gives a chuckle while reading over my chart. \"Precautionary.\" He nods. \"Usually girls wait until they\u0027ve had many sexual encounters under their belt before wising up and taking it upon themselves to get on the pill.\" He looks up and blinks a smile. \"They\u0027re not smart like you.\" A goth-looking nursing assistant pops into the room and gives a little sneer. \"We can start now,\" he says, motioning for me to lie down. \"Go ahead and slide to the end of the table, put your feet in the stirrups.\" \"What? Where\u0027s the doctor?\" I cinch up my legs until my knees meld together. His features smooth out. \"I\u0027m the doctor, Kendall.\" He taps his nametag, which proudly boasts, Dr. Gaines. \"I want another one!\" I sit up in a panic. \"I usually have a woman.\" I\u0027ve only had a woman gynecologist. In fact, I didn\u0027t even know it was legal not to. What the hell kind of health care practices do they have in Massachusetts anyway? \"I\u0027m the only one on staff today,\" he says with a peaceable smile. Shit! What have I done to Molly? Hopefully, she ran screaming and didn\u0027t let some body builder parading around as a doctor \"examine\" her. God, Cruise is going to hate me after this and most likely have me arrested. \"We\u0027re really busy today.\" He gives a little wink. \"I promise to be gentle.\" A wink? Really? Is that what they teach male doctors in med school? Or maybe it was the wrestling ring. He snaps on a pair of rubber gloves, and I slip my feet into the frozen stirrups, dying to get this over with. Think of Cruise, I tell myself. Think how amazing it will be to finally have his one-balled, half-penised body inside me. I let out a string of involuntary giggles no thanks to Molly and the exceptional bullshit she tried feeding me. Forget Cruise, I\u0027m going to kill Molly for planting such phenomenal crap in my mind. Of course, she was lying. Right? Afterward, I get dressed, and Sally from The Nightmare Before I Lose My Virginity leads me to a room down the hall. \"We\u0027re briefing all the first-timers,\" she gravels it out like a threat. This will take about twenty seconds.\" The small office is crammed with six other girls, and holy shit - one of them happens to be Molly. I speed on over. \"I thought you said this was a refill,\" I hiss. \"I never said those words. I said, I \u0027ran out.\u0027\" She pinches a smile, and her dark brows peak in a malevolent manner. \"Ran out of what?\" \"Patience.\" She spits it in my face. I take in a breath, shaking at the thought of being tricked into getting her on the pill of all things. \"Patience? I\u0027ve run out of exactly that.\" I warn her. We sit through a quick debriefing, but I\u0027m so hopped up on my newfound insanity I don\u0027t hear a word they say. Afterward, I practically drag her out into the blizzard-like conditions, so I can drill her a new one in peace. \"What the hell was that about?\" I ask as she makes her way to the passenger\u0027s side of the car. I unlock it, and we get in. She dusts the snow off her sleeves before answering. \"Look, I owe you one. Okay?\" She shakes her head as though I should be grateful for her divisive services. We drive home through stunted silence. I\u0027m sure Molly is secretly doing the happy dance at what a live idiot I am - and I can\u0027t think straight to formulate two words because she happens to be right. I drop her off at the entrance to the bed and breakfast. \"Molly?\" I call to her just as she\u0027s ready to slam the door. \"Yes?\" She gives a sweet smile, looking all of twelve in the process. \"Do yourself a favor - wait for someone special. Trust me, he\u0027s not roaming the halls of your high school. And if he were, he wouldn\u0027t be sleeping with some girl named Tracy, or Stacy, or anybody else. He\u0027d only have eyes for you. Don\u0027t give away something you can never get back, save it for someone you love and who really loves you, too.\" Molly sighs, expelling an entire plume of smoke from her lips. \"Yeah, whatever.\" She slams the door with a marked finality and runs toward the glorified hotel. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d swear I was starting to believe in something that just a month ago I would have bet was nothing but a myth. Love. I guess it really does exist. Yeah, whatever. Cruise The snow bears down on us as we make our way into the Cineplex 10 where our respective dates are waiting. Kenny looks hotter than hell in her denim jacket, skinny jeans, and heels, but unfortunately, judging by her blue limbs and purple lips, she\u0027s about to turn into the world\u0027s cutest Popsicle. I did happen to notice she\u0027s lacking in the winter coat department. If I didn\u0027t need every dime to eat I\u0027d help her out. Might just do that anyway. \"So who\u0027s Pen bringing?\" She glows as she looks up at me. A cold chill tingles through my spine at the idea Kenny might have thought she was my date. Pennington speeds in this direction before I can rectify the situation with Monique hot on his heels. Her hair flows down her back like a flame, and she\u0027s wearing those thigh-highs she\u0027s famous for. I\u0027ve seen her in them at least a couple times with nothing else but a smile. Shit. \"Oh my gawd!\" Monique lunges at me with a running start and hikes her legs around my hips. She leaves me physically spinning, already dry humping me in the foyer of the theater. \"I have missed you!\" She pokes her finger in my stomach before dipping down to my crotch. \"But I\u0027ve missed you even more,\" she sings. \"Whoa!\" I set her down, almost afraid to glance at Kenny. Her lids hang low. I can\u0027t tell if she\u0027s pissed or about to cry. She wraps an arm around Pennington, and it\u0027s only then I notice they\u0027ve both accessorized with their matching purses. Something about it rubs me the wrong way, even if it was accidental. \"I guess it\u0027s me and you, Pen,\" she says it sultry, like she means it and begins to nibble on his ear. Her teeth graze over his earlobe, and she cuts me a glance before moaning into the endeavor. My stomach clenches just witnessing the unholy encounter. That should be my fucking ear. Shit. This isn\u0027t going as planned. And what the hell did I plan anyway? Driving her wild with jealousy so she could hone in on any feelings she might have for me? And now Pen and his extra-curricular cartilage are getting all the attention. \"Let\u0027s do it.\" I pull Monique in by the shoulder and lead us over to the ticket counter. We all agree on a horror movie, The Damned and the Restless. I suppose I\u0027m the damned tonight for shoving a perfectly good Kendal Jordan in my horny little bro\u0027s direction. Monique would be the restless in this equation since she\u0027s already felt up my crotch a half a dozen times, no matter how hard I try to evade her efforts. \"I\u0027m buying.\" Pennington volunteers like its some heroic effort on his part. Nothing like being financially emasculated by Pen to further toss the night into the crapper. Kenny looks over her shoulder at Monique and outright scowls. For a second I think the claws are going to show, but Kenny reverts and twitches out a charitable smile. Do I detect that Kendall Jordan is, dare I say, jealous? My adrenaline kicks in at the prospect. I sling an arm over Monique\u0027s shoulder, inspiring her to snuggle in deeper. I believe this is feeding in beautifully to my original misguided intentions. And, since we\u0027ve already met up with the green-eyed monster before getting out the gate, I\u0027d say the evening is off to a pretty damn good start. I\u0027m hoping at the end of the covetous rainbow lies a pot of golden affection. And right now there\u0027s nothing more I want than Kendall Jordan\u0027s affection. I gaze into Monique and moan. \"Popcorn?\" I\u0027d hate for Kenny to miss the real show, the one in which I accidentally drive her into my arms. I jab an elbow into Kenny. \"What about you? I\u0027ll spring.\" Her perfect pink mouth falls open as she takes in the body slinked around mine. \"Pennington, what do you think?\" she asks, latching onto him, with her long slender arms and my insides explode in a ball of acid. \"For you?\" He slips his hand around her waist far below her hip, and I see her fidget, trying to keep him from hitting pay dirt. \"I\u0027d buy the left side of the menu if you wanted.\" He dots the sentiment by planting a kiss in her ear. Who the hell kisses someone in their ear? Idiot. Pen loads us all up on enough junk food to proficiently rot the teeth out of our skulls before the movie\u0027s over. I specifically told him I didn\u0027t want any. The last thing I want is to look like a charity case, but it\u0027s me who ends up hauling all the crap to the theater. Kenny leans into Monique. \"You guys mind if we sit by you?\" My heart thumps a little faster at the idea of Kenny wanting to sit together. \"We can trade Gummy Bears and Sour Patch Kids.\" Kenny nods at the sexual python currently strapped to my hip as if this confection-based currency were the sole purpose of securing proximal seating arrangements. And sadly, it very well could be. I lead us over to the middle right, my usual landing place. I don\u0027t care what anybody says, it\u0027s the best place to see a movie. I let Pen slide in first, then Kenny, and I\u0027m quick to file in after her. First of all, I\u0027m not that into horror flicks. If really want to scare the crap out of myself, I\u0027ll consult the file marked \"student loans.\" I nearly shit a brick the last time I looked at the running total. Monique dips her hand under my shirt and slips those icicles she calls fingers inside. There\u0027s nothing wrong with Monique. In fact, she happened to be at the gym when I was setting things up with Pen and overheard the conversation. She practically volunteered to be my date. I\u0027ve slept with her at least twice, although the details are fuzzy. All I remember is her hair falling in my eyes while she rode me like a stallion. The theater dims to pitch and I envision Kenny riding me like that - her long, glossy mane whipping me softly. I move my jacket over my jeans in the event my spontaneous salute to Kenny, decides to cause a scene. I look over and note she\u0027s stealing sideways glances every chance she gets. Monique\u0027s hand flops like a fish over my leg until it bounces onto my crotch, and I shift away in the event she feels inspired to help me release a little tension. I don\u0027t need much deliberation to know I\u0027m not going there again with Monique, tonight or any other night. Kenny cinches her lips and slides toward Pen. His hand slithers over her shoulder, landing square over her tit like a freaking missile shield. Crap. My breathing grows erratic by the minute because I\u0027m about to beat the shit out of my brother for feeling up my girlfriend. Did I just call Kenny my girlfriend? First, I\u0027m talking love, and now I\u0027m on the brink of some romantic commitment? I glance over at Monique - the lust-driven look in her eyes, her legs already parting with the invitation. I could have her if I want to. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s an empty corner or bathroom stall just waiting for the two of us. It\u0027s obvious she\u0027d be more than up for the challenge. But nothing in me wants to play that game again. It was empty, shallow, and felt like I was falling down a bottomless pit with no comfort, and no rest, and for damn sure nothing a box of condoms could cure. The movie drones on and Monique begins gnawing at my ear, inspiring me to deflect her efforts. I have no clue what the hell is going on with the movie because all I keep thinking about is how the fuck long Pen is going to act like some human boob warmer. Kenny looks over at me and catches my gaze. She glances down and makes a face at the vile limb in question until she delicately removes it from her person. I give a little smile as my entire body exhales with relief. Monique dives her hand between my legs. I\u0027d better douse this fire before Kenny tries to one up us in the movie make-out department and turns this into some kind of copulation relay. \"You mind?\" I say it nice enough, but there\u0027s never a good way to tell someone to stop trying to have sex with you. Kenny leans toward me, and I shift in her direction until our shoulders rest up against one another. I drop my hand low, hoping she\u0027ll do the same. Her fingers brush up against mine until we slowly interlace, and my heart races like a sixteen-year-old about to get lucky at prom. Holding hands in a dark theater with Kenny outweighs every public sex act I\u0027ve ever committed. This was gratifying, satisfying, and intensely erotic all on its own. I\u0027m in love with Kenny. There it is. I\u0027ve broken the worst promise I\u0027ve ever made to myself, to never fall in love again. But Kenny is definitely no Blair. She\u0027s a million times better. For once, I\u0027m thankful things ended the way they did for me last summer, or I wouldn\u0027t be sitting here holding hands with the only girl on the planet I want to be with. She gives my hand a squeeze and rubs tiny circles over the top with the warm pad of her thumb. Kenny Jordan is by my side, and all is right with the world. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d think she was starting to have feelings for me, too.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1/page-8.html","bookId":1870,"book":{"id":1870,"title":"Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1)","description":"Storyline: Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1) What happens when two people who don’t believe in love, happen to fall madly into the most beautiful relationship they could ever imagine?
