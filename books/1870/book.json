A train wreck. \\n When twenty-year-old Kendall Jordan transfers clear across country to Garrison University, the last thing she’s looking for is a one-night stand. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what, gorgeous, Cruise Elton offers. \\n Kendall has long since come to realize that love is an illusion that never lasts, and Cruise couldn’t agree more—but something deep inside her wants him all for herself. So, Kendall devises a seat of the pants plan to “play the player” and proposes that Cruise tutor her in becoming a female version of himself, Garrison University’s own playboy. \\n Real feelings begin to emerge, and neither Kendall nor Cruise know how to classify them. Everything they once thought they knew is redefined as they discover, in one another, Someone to Love.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1.jpg","author":"Addison Moore","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
