{"id":82716,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The week rolls on, and both Cruise and I are finding a rhythm in the house. He cooks breakfast, and I make lunch. Dinner is on the fly and usually sponsored by Johnny Burgers. Cruise mentioned he needed to help out his mom this afternoon, so I\u0027m running errands.\n Driving on snow-slicked roads feels a lot like falling in love. Although I\u0027m totally not falling in love - I\u0027m falling in lust. That\u0027s all that really exists in this world. Everything else is simply an illusion born of self-inflicted desire.\n I\u0027m dodging some serious traffic, thanks to an entire slew of after-Christmas sales as I make my way back from Garrison. I made the mistake of checking on the status of my imaginary dorm room only to be informed Pennington fabricated the fact he put me on a waiting list - turns out there isn\u0027t one.\n I squeeze my hands over the steering wheel and pretend its Pennington\u0027s little, red neck. Speaking of the Alexander clan - I can\u0027t believe Aunt Jackie actually said Russell Hall was for \"losers.\" Turns out, Aunt Jackie is nothing but a bully who kicked Cruise out of his father\u0027s life so she could slather all of the financial attention on her sweet little Penny boy. Little does she know Pen is nothing but a stoner with a man purse.\n I pull into the Starbucks parking lot and speed into the cheery-looking establishment to avoid the arctic chill. Much to my surprise, none of my warm weather clothes are capable of keeping my body a toasty ninety-eight degrees. I\u0027ve got some serious shopping to do and not a whole lot of cash to do it with.\n \"Kendall?\" A friendly female calls from the corner, and I spot Lauren and Ally waving me over. I remember them from the Alpha Sigma Phi party. They\u0027re the ones I wanted to go home with, but fate stepped in and I ended up with Cruise instead. Wait, did I just say fate? I so don\u0027t believe in that. Fate is bullshit people force-feed themselves when they\u0027re too lazy to carve out a destiny of their own.\n \"How\u0027s it going?\" Ally chirps as I take a seat.\n \"It\u0027s great. I meant to find you that night at the party. I guess Pennington missed the housing deadline and now I\u0027m homeless.\"\n \"As in park bench action?\" Lauren\u0027s eyes widen as if I\u0027ve just introduced Small Pox to the vicinity.\n \"No, as in Cruise Elton action. He\u0027s letting me crash at his place, but I can\u0027t mooch off him forever.\"\n They\u0027re quick to exchange glances.\n \"So you\u0027re on Cruise control.\" Ally sinks a knowing smile. \"How\u0027s that working for you?\"\n \"I hear he\u0027s hotter than a forest fire in bed.\" Lauren molests her necklace at thought of Cruise burning up the sheets.\n \"I hear his dick is the size of a telephone pole.\" Ally\u0027s eyes expand the size of dinner plates as she awaits confirmation of the supersized theory.\n Lauren points at me with her banana. \"Stephanie Banks slept with him a month ago and dubbed him \u0027king of the triple orgasm.\u0027\"\n Ally sucks in a breath and her face turns colors like maybe she\u0027s experiencing one herself at the moment. \"That is freaking insane. Melissa Warbeck says he can do things with his tongue that qualifies him as criminally insane.\"\n The two of them look at me as if I were about to verify every sexual rumor Cruise Elton ever sponsored, and add a few unbelievable new ones to the mix.\n \"Uh...\" Dear God. A triple? My entire body sighs at the thought of Cruise taking me down that unknowable path, landing me in a sexual-based euphoria with his rock-hard body pressed against mine. \"Actually, we haven\u0027t done anything like that, yet.\" Yet? \"Technically, we haven\u0027t had a first time, either,\" I confess.\n \"Really?\" Ally\u0027s lips droop with disappointment. \"So what\u0027s the deal?\" She flicks her layered mane until it shags out around her face.\n \"I asked him to instruct me in his wicked ways.\" A devious smile plays on my lips. \"I told him I wanted to be just as sleazy as he is when I grow up and asked him to teach me the tricks of the trade.\"\n \"Which consist of?\" Lauren seems nonplused by my ability to enlist Cruise as my personal portal to promiscuity.\n \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s like my mouth started moving without my permission, and before I knew it, I was asking him to lead me through the deep, dark forest of debauchery. The truth is - I sort of wanted to, you know, be with him, but I was too embarrassed by the fact I\u0027ve never been with anyone before.\" I shrug as though what just flew from my lips was morally sane. \"I believe I referred to it as a social experiment.\"\n \"A what?\" Ally squints into me with a level of distress, reserved for degenerate social scientists such as myself.\n \"Don\u0027t you get it?\" Lauren knocks an elbow into her. \"She\u0027s a genius.\" She diverts her attention back to me. \"You\u0027re interested in him, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Maybe a little.\" Okay, a lot.\n \"And you want more than a one-night stand.\" She asserts.\n \"That would be nice.\" True story.\n \"And because you\u0027re a slow learner, he\u0027ll have to do an awful lot of tutoring.\" She nods into the brilliance of my plan.\n \"I am a slow learner.\" I give a wicked grin. \"And practice makes perfect, right?\"\n \"Yeah, right.\" Ally doesn\u0027t look too convinced of said brilliance. \"But Cruise is a sexpert in the field of moral depravity. You\u0027re going to have to really wow him in order for him to keep you around. Besides, do you really want him to touch you between the resident skanks he pleasures nightly?\"\n \"He said he\u0027d take a break for me.\" And, I\u0027m not above spreading rumors of a very bad rash he might have fictitiously acquired if he doesn\u0027t stay true to his word.\n They take in a simultaneous breath as if what I suggested held serious security infractions for our great nation.\n \"He\u0027s taking a break?\" Lauren\u0027s mouth falls open at the prospect. \"Does his dick know about this? Look, you need to forget this whole idea and find yourself a good guy - someone who\u0027ll bring you flowers and candy.\"\n \"And triple orgasms,\" Ally interjects as though this very feature should land near the top of the list.\n \"Not everyone has an orgasm the first time.\" Lauren peels her banana without taking her eyes off Ally. \"It\u0027s physiologically impossible. Besides, she\u0027s not there yet. Can\u0027t you see, she\u0027s a blank slate?\" She reverts to me. \"God, you\u0027re not even going to know what to do with that telephone pole.\" She sticks her banana in her mouth and maneuvers it in and out like she\u0027s speaking some sexual Morse code.\n \"Would you stop?\" Ally snatches it from her. \"I refuse to watch you perform a lewd act with fruit in public.\" She looks to me and closes her eyes briefly. \"You can\u0027t be that blank of a slate. I mean, you\u0027ve seen one, right?\"\n \"Seen one, what?\" I ask. \"Oh! That. No, actually I haven\u0027t. Although, I did walk in on my brother once while he was using the bathroom but - \"\n \"Gross.\" Ally mock vomits.\n \"Get this straight, Kendall,\" Lauren snips. \"Brothers never count.\"\n Ally pulls me in by the wrist. \"It looks like a Storm Trooper,\" she asserts.\n \"Crap.\" Lauren bats her hand away. \"Don\u0027t you listen to her. She thinks everything somehow reverts back to Star Wars. It looks like this.\" She holds out her banana, then proceeds to take a rather deep-throat inspired bite of the phallic fruit in question.\n Ally groans at the visual. \"Kendall\" - she scoots in - \"I wouldn\u0027t worry too much about your lack of carnal knowledge. Cruise is proficient in body language. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll teach you everything he knows.\"\n That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m afraid of and hoping for all at the same time.\n A pretty blonde wrapped in a bright red coat strides in and takes a seat at the table behind us. She observes me with a cold expression, and I look away to avoid her uncomfortable gaze.\n \"In fact, don\u0027t worry about a thing.\" Ally goes on. \"Cruise Elton will be a great teacher. And, when he\u0027s through with you, we\u0027ll find you the perfect boyfriend - one that speaks at least three different computer languages because God knows you don\u0027t want to get saddled with a moron.\"\n \"Three computer languages.\" I nod absentmindedly, but all I can think about is the fact not one part of me wants to get rid of Cruise Elton so fast. In fact, every part of me wants to keep him. \"And what if it\u0027s Cruise I want as my boyfriend?\"\n Lauren sprays her coffee over her shoulder.\n \"You can\u0027t be serious.\" Ally scoffs. \"That\u0027s like trying to tame a wild mustang. You need to be careful or you could get yourself killed.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know...\" Lauren touches her finger to the rim of her cup as she considers this. \"It\u0027s happened before. Cruise Elton once had very serious boyfriend potential. Is that what you\u0027re shooting for?\"\n \"Maybe I am.\" I squirm in my seat at the thought of taming an apparently well-endowed mustang.\n \"Alrighty then\" - Lauren raises her coffee and inspires Ally to do the same - \"here\u0027s to playing the player!\"\n \"To playing the player.\" Ally sings. \"In the name of triple orgasms, may you take down Cruise Elton\u0027s heart and make it your own.\"\n \"Believe me, he\u0027ll never see it coming.\" Lauren takes a sip of her drink.\n The thought of Cruise Elton as my own personal boyfriend stuns me.\n I didn\u0027t see it coming either.\n The girl in the red coat cuts me a hard look and dashes out the door.\n After Starbucks, I decide to fill my afternoon with exploration.\n The Happy Hair and Nail salon sits nestled in the same strip mall as Starbucks, so I head over and decide to cash in on my hair and nail jackpot sponsored by none other than Cruise\u0027s own mother.\n I watch as the artisan carefully paints my nails a candy apple red while another prods, pokes, and tickles mercilessly at my feet. Secretly, I hate getting a pedi. I hate having my toes scrubbed and molested, and every time they pull out the clippers, it feels as if I\u0027m having my nails chewed off by a rabid school of fish. There\u0027s nothing appealing about someone playing with your feet, unless of course, it was Cruise at the helm of the foot fondling, then I wouldn\u0027t mind so much. Speaking of which, I should have asked Lauren and Ally if there was something special I should be doing to ready myself for my impending conjugal union - like give myself a bikini wax in delicate places, or soak in rose petals for thirty days straight. Not that I plan on waiting thirty days before getting down and dirty with the boy toy in question.\n Am I really trying to trick him into boyfriend-hood? I\u0027m not am I? Tricking someone into a relationship is the earmark of a despicable person. I\u0027m simply attracted to Cruise and, it just so happens, not to anybody else. A part of me does want to be a player - the girl with a heart of steel who could care less about who I\u0027m \"playing\" with at the moment, but it just so happens he\u0027s the only one I\u0027m interested in sharing myself sexually with. Anyway, school starts in a week, and I\u0027ll probably forget all about my hormones like I have in the past. I\u0027m studious that way, and professors and books rarely hold much sex appeal.\n After an hour of listening to foreign banter that sounded like the aggressive plucking of guitar strings, I schlep myself over to a bona fide workstation near the front of the establishment.\n A frail woman with burnt frizzy hair plucks at my locks while inspecting them with great interest. She wears a purple frilly smock that bears the name \"Boppy\" emblazoned across the front, complete with sparkly jewels bedazzled throughout. Her blue fingernail polish is badly chipped, revealing a gardener\u0027s manicure just beneath the nail beds, and she\u0027s sweating profusely even though it\u0027s a balmy two degrees in here.\n \"Virgin!\" She whoops it out like a fire alarm.\n My God, can she really tell by looking at my freaking hair? I sink in my seat as a half dozen women flock over and pull my mane as if I\u0027ve suddenly morphed into a one-woman petting zoo.\n \"Give her a shag,\" one cries.\n \"A perm, but go spiral. She\u0027s got the length,\" another croaks.\n I\u0027m quick to scoff at the idea. I can attest to the fact there shall be no follicular felonies of the permanent variety committed on my person this afternoon. The women admiring my virginal tresses have obviously developed a contact high off the ammonia congesting the air. Unless this quasi-dental chair they\u0027ve hiked me up in has some magical time machine properties, and we\u0027ve all been transported back to 1983, there\u0027s no way in hell I\u0027m letting a spiral perm fly.\n Boppy leans in. \"I\u0027m doing highlights.\" The over-processed princess seizes me as if to ward off the angry villagers. \"This hair is crying for some contrast, and would you look at those eyes? They\u0027re bedroom eyes for God\u0027s sake. She needs bangs.\" She shoos the other women away like unwanted pigeons. \"Don\u0027t you worry, hon. I\u0027ll have every man from here to Canada trying to drag you off to bed.\" She snaps her gum to annunciate the point. \"Let\u0027s get you under the faucet.\"\n \"Oh, um, I washed my hair this morning. I think all I really need is a little trim off the bottom.\" The thought of her digging her less than hygienic fingernails into my scalp sends a rise of vomit to the back of my throat. I lean in and whisper, \"It\u0027s my first time getting my hair done.\" A cloud of shame settles around me for no good reason.\n \"Oh. My. God.\" She backs up clutching at her chest as if I\u0027ve deliberately set out to break some indelible girl code. \"You, my friend, are in need of the works. You don\u0027t worry about a thing.\" She slaps a pink plastic coat over my sweater and speeds me off to the sink. \"This is gonna feel better than s-e-x.\" She belts out a laugh as the hose spits out a firm spray of heavenly warm water over my scalp, and I moan into the experience.\n Oh God, it does feel good. Like triple-your-pleasure good. Not that I would know what that feels like, but still.\n Boppy masticates at rocket speed while filling me in on the finer details of her boyfriend\u0027s professional cage fighting career until something wet and hard flies into my eye.\n \"Oh my God!\" She plucks it off and pops it back into her mouth. \"Please don\u0027t tell! I swear you can come in anytime you want for like a year, but if my boss finds out I dropped gum on another client, my ass is grass and so is my rent. Believe me, I\u0027ll make sure you don\u0027t leave here until you are satisfied.\"\n Gah! Her gum? As in the rubber cement she\u0027s been trying to wrestle into submission with her less than hygienic sublingual juices? That gum? That\u0027s the wet glob of goo that just fell in my freaking eyeball? I\u0027m sure there are an entire litany of diseases I\u0027m now eligible to entertain, like mono for starters, and the mainstay of the dead and dying the world over, hepatitis. I knew I shouldn\u0027t have come to the \"Happy Herpes and Molest Your Nails Salon.\" And now she\u0027s going to try and satisfy me, whatever the hell that means. I will so throw her and her refried tresses down if she even attempts to initiate a \"happy ending.\"\n \"I\u0027m fine.\" I assure for the thousandth time as she escorts me back to mission control. She pumps up the chair until my stomach bottoms out from the g-forces she\u0027s emitting.\n \"Don\u0027t you worry.\" She combs my hair down the front of my face and cuts straight across in one clean hack attack. \"Walla.\"\n Holy shit!\n Did she just hack off my hair and follow it up with a walla? Why does it suddenly feel like I\u0027m back in fifth grade at Becky Zuckerman\u0027s house and she\u0027s giving my hair a \"little body\" - code for a fucking mullet.\n She fiddles with a rubber band, that honest to God she just plucked from the filth pit that is her mouth, and flexes it over my head. She backs up revealing my new unicorn-inspired ponytail sitting on top of my head as I struggle to catch my breath. Clearly Boppy here is freaking insane. Clearly, her not-so-cute moniker comes straight from the fact someone took her to task with a baseball bat and now my hair is reaping the grave benefits of a fractured skull trauma.\n She begins mixing bottles and solutions as if they were potions while I plot my escape from this dungeon of disaster.\n \"We don\u0027t want to get any of this crap anywhere it\u0027s not supposed to be,\" she sings, ignoring the fact I now have a miniature erect penis sprouting from my forehead.\n \"Where it\u0027s not supposed to be? Like my hair?\" I\u0027m only half-joking.\n \"Just some chestnut highlights. Nothing more, I promise.\"\n She spends the next leg of a decade basting my hair with what looks like glue then proceeds to wrap it in tinsel. Any moment now I\u0027m expecting her to tune me like a radio and dial into the mother planet. Personally, all of this wasteful use of tinfoil is making me hungry for a Ding Dong.\n She spins me into the mirror, so I can appreciate the full effect of her not-so-handy work.\n \"Oh my God!\" It flies from my lips without meaning to. My hair has ballooned out two feet in every direction and it looks as though I\u0027ve donned an aluminum afro.\n \"Here.\" She opens a jar marked \"avocado\" and slathers a green paste liberally over my face as her final descent toward insanity plays out right here on my person. \"You\u0027ll be spit shined and ready to go. New Year\u0027s Eve, here you come baby!\" She lets a couple of hearty whoops rip for added affect. \"Now all you have to do is sit under these lights for a solid thirty minutes.\" She pulls a set of octopus tentacles off the ceiling and surrounds me with a spray of blue and red bulbs. Suddenly, it all feels a little too electric chair for my liking.\n I look at myself with my muddied face, the tiny follicular penis sitting erect on the top of my head and my hair splayed out like a tinsel factory exploded. I\u0027m betting the electric chair is a tad less humiliating.\n \"I\u0027m gonna take a quick lunch break.\" Boppy snaps up her purse. \"I\u0027ll see you in a jiff!\"\n She spins the chair around, presumably so I won\u0027t be moved to inflict self-harm should I gaze too long in the mirror, and I\u0027m met with a stunningly handsome, drop dead gorgeous, very much aware of the fact I look like an ass, Cruise Elton.\n Just fuck.\n Cruise\n Oh Shit.\n I should probably busy myself pretending to look at paperwork, or answer the phone for the hell of it, or just run out the fucking door because my mother\u0027s incompetent salon has just turned one of the most beautiful women on the planet into a prime example of why other females should never set foot in the establishment.\n A smile twitches on my lips as her mouth opens in horror. Great. Now she thinks I\u0027m laughing at her. I\u0027d better go over and say something.\n \"Kenny?\" I ask in the off chance it\u0027s another coed who\u0027s mortified to see me.\n She closes her eyes, and a tiny whimper escapes her throat.\n \"Have I mentioned I\u0027ve never been to a salon before?\" She squeaks.\n I can see why, but don\u0027t say a word.\n \"So\" - she looks around as her eyes glitter up - \"tell me about school.\" She presses her lips together, presumably fighting off tears.\n A nervous laugh beats down my chest, and it takes everything in me to suppress the crap out of it. The truth is, I\u0027m taken by her even in the Halloween garb she\u0027s currently imprisoned in.\n \"I\u0027m a graduate student,\" I say, pulling up a chair. \"I\u0027ve got my sights set on a fellowship, next year, with hopes to teach at Garrison some day.\"\n \"Really?\" Her eyes glow a beautiful iridescent and my body feels as though it\u0027s just fell through a trap door, landed in a place where it\u0027s just Kenny and me on the other side.\n \"Really,\" I say. \"Either that or I\u0027ll run the bed and breakfast.\"\n She licks her lips, inspecting me. \"You don\u0027t happen to know any computer languages, do you?\"\n Computer languages? \"I know some Java Script, C plus plus, and C, but mostly that was for programming when my solitary goal in life was to become the world\u0027s most wanted hacker. That, and trying to rob my father blind of his millions, but in my defense, I was thirteen and he said no when I asked for a new bike.\"\n She belts out a lusty laugh, and soon, I don\u0027t see the circus around her beautiful features. All I see is Kenny and the light that shines like a beacon from inside her heart.\n \"So you know three.\" She relaxes for the first time. \"I actually don\u0027t know any, so your father\u0027s millions are safe from me.\"\n \"How about you? What are you studying?\" An animalistic wave overcomes me, and I have the urge to do her right here in the salon under the red-hot spot lights brewing from above, tinfoil and all.\n \"Well, I\u0027m on the five year plan, plus I took a year off. Outside of striking a name for myself as campus bimbo, I\u0027ll be taking up airspace in the liberal arts department. In fact, I was supposed to have received my schedule this week, but I keep forgetting to check my emails. I\u0027m hoping I got all the classes I wanted. Art, English 102, Finite math, and a class on gender relations.\"\n \"Study of men and women in society?\" I perk to attention.\n \"That\u0027s the one.\" She darts a freshly polished fingernail in the air, and I imagine diving the digit deep in my mouth, grazing over it with my teeth.\n \"Bradshaw teaches it,\" I say, trying to drag myself out my sexual stupor before I find myself in a hard situation. \"He\u0027s a good guy. He\u0027s been sick, so they\u0027ve got a T.A. covering it.\" I don\u0027t tell her that I\u0027m the T.A. That I\u0027ll be structuring a syllabus for the class later this afternoon because Bradshaw had a lobe of his lung removed last month.\n \"I just took it because it sounded like an easy A.\" Her eyes flicker like mirrors in the sun. \"But with a T.A. holding down the fort, I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t even have to show up.\"\n Not show up? Sounds like she might be on the fifteen-year plan.\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll make you work for your grade.\" I blink a quick smile. \"In fact, I hear he gets inventive. He really likes to personalize the syllabus for each student\u0027s individual needs.\" Not really but the idea came to me, so I run with it. I think I\u0027ll get started on her syllabus right away. I might even throw in a liability waiver - a hold harmless agreement for the more acrobatic requirements she\u0027ll need to participate in if she intends on achieving that \"easy A.\"\n A half hour later the buzzer goes off, and about twenty minutes after that, Boppy drags her tail in from her break.\n \"Holy shit!\" She snipes while scratching to remove the tin from Kenny\u0027s hair like she were stomping out a kitchen fire. She throws her under the sink with half the foil still glued to her scalp and starts sending up a string of prayers to the patron saint of fucked-up hairstyles.\n After a good span of eternity, Kenny finally makes her way to the counter, or at least I think its Kenny. Her face is scrubbed raw, with her eyes pink and watery like someone poured in vinegar, but it\u0027s the hair where the real trauma lies.\n \"Oh shit,\" I whisper.\n \"Oh shit is right.\"\n She\u0027s good and pissed, and well, incredibly irresistible even if she does look as if she\u0027s magically aged about fifty years. I\u0027m pretty sure she wasn\u0027t in the market for grey streaks when she came in.\n \"I look like a skunk.\"\n I make my way around the counter.\n \"Kenny, the city kitty.\" I pull her in by the fingers. \"Lucky for you, I\u0027m into older women.\"\n Her lips quiver like she might lose it, so I do the only thing I can think of to make the two of us feel better. I cover her mouth with mine and splurge on a kiss that drives me deeper into the insanity Kenny has me wrapped in.\n On New Year\u0027s Eve, Ackerman House gyrates to raucous, loud hip-hop music that manages to pulsate through every cavity in my body. Swear to God, I\u0027m about to find the volume control and turn it down about six notches, which probably highlights the fact that at the tender age of twenty-four, I\u0027m too old for this shit.\n Mercifully, the music dies down, and the next song belts out something a little smoother that my eardrums might approve of once they stop bleeding.\n \"So which one?\" Kenny steps in front of me while eyeing a group of football players. Two of them are engaged in a mock fistfight that has them socking one another, hard as possible.\n Tonight\u0027s lesson involves approaching potential hookups. Not that Kenny will be hooking up with the goofs running around this place. My lesson is specifically designed to keep her integrity intact.\n Kenny went all out in the looks department tonight with her sky-high heels and a black miniskirt that shows off her luscious limbs. I don\u0027t think I can take much more of her walking around the house half-dressed, her wet hair, her braless mornings. If she doesn\u0027t give in soon, I\u0027ll fall on my knees and beg her to have her way with me. She\u0027s got me shaking just walking past her in the hall. We\u0027ve done the movie and the dinner thing, twice. I think it\u0027s time to up the ante, lie down and see if she bites. God, I hope she bites.\n \"Okay, see those two guys?\" I point just past the jocks.\n \"The cute one with the football, and the buffed-out guy in a wife beater?\" She licks her well-glossed lips.\n \"Nope.\" I redirect her to the lanky pair with their pants riding high on their waists. \"We\u0027re going to start with those two. I want you to get at least six different numbers tonight. That should help you break out of your shell.\" And keep her woman parts safe from assholes that have an unnatural obsession with pigskin and wife beaters.\n She struts around to my other side, and her hourglass figure weakens my defenses. Her hair still holds the strong scent of solution from Mom trying to correct the blunder her former employee proliferated. Gone is the grey. Kenny\u0027s hair sort of morphed to a dark chestnut with highlights. Mom is damn lucky Kenny doesn\u0027t sue for emotional damages. She wore a hoodie three days straight.\n \"Those two?\" She balks. \"Are you sure?\"\n \"I\u0027m positive,\" I whisper. \"Now, get a move on, young grasshopper. I\u0027ll watch from the sidelines.\" I nod over to the super geeks in the corner until she ventures off in that direction.\n A tangle of bodies filter between us, and I can\u0027t help but notice Kenny is turning heads. Before I know it, an entire herd of vulture-like, horny-as-hell, jocks surround her. Great.\n \"How\u0027s the virgin?\" Cal shoulders up to me and hands me a beer.\n \"She\u0027s in the room ass-wipe,\" I reprimand, cracking it open and taking a sip. \"And things are progressing slowly. I haven\u0027t scared her off yet, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what has me worried. It\u0027s the fact she hasn\u0027t scared you off yet. What\u0027s going on? It\u0027s New Year\u0027s fucking Eve, and you\u0027re overseeing a vestal of innocence while other guys hit on her? I\u0027m beginning to think you\u0027ve lost your touch. Take her to task in the bedroom or boot her out the door. If you don\u0027t do her, I might just have to intervene and do her for you.\"\n \"Right. I\u0027m leaving you now.\" I head toward Kenny to help her navigate the sheer number of drooling idiots who have amassed around her like zombies in some B-rated horror flick.\n \"Hey!\" A pair of familiar arms wraps themselves around me. I glance down to find a brunette with her eyes half-closed, already wasted into tomorrow.\n \"Donna.\" I think.\n \"Amber.\" She flashes a toothy grin.\n Or that. \"Look, I\u0027m...\" I glance over at Kenny and her band of aspiring bedmates, as she waves from across the room. She glances at the pale limb secured around my waist, and a hurt look flashes across her face. Kenny flips her hair and pretends not to notice as she turns her attention back to the \"cute\" jock.\n Shit. They\u0027re flocking to her, smiling like idiots, wearing their hard-ons right on their sleeves.\n \"Listen, Linda, I gotta go.\" I pluck her arm off and head into the crowd.\n \"It\u0027s Amber!\"\n I dig through a swell of bodies and every time I think I\u0027m getting closer to Kenny, she and her throng of boy toys drift a little farther out of reach.\n \"Cruise!\" Lauren, Cal\u0027s questionable other half, steps up, and I lose sight of Kenny altogether. \"So are the rumors true? Cruise Elton has finally settled down? I hear you\u0027re trying out a live-in girlfriend for size.\" She gives her signature smirk.\n \"Nope, just a friend.\"\n She mouths out an O. \"Look\" - she glances into the throng of bodies - \"I\u0027d hate to see anybody get hurt. Why don\u0027t you do everyone involved a favor and grow a pair - either commit or cut her loose. She\u0027s not at Garrison looking for heartbreak. I know what Blair did sucked, and I totally get why you took it out on the next five hundred vaginas that were at the ready, but Kendall...\" - she shakes her head - \"she\u0027s not the same. Go easy on her, would you?\" She melts back into the crowd like an apparition.\n She\u0027s right. Kendall is different.\n I pan the vicinity and find Kenny perched on top of the couch while six different guys vie for her attention.\n Maybe I\u0027m the one who should be vying for her attention. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1/page-6.html","bookId":1870,"book":{"id":1870,"title":"Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1) \n What happens when two people who don’t believe in love, happen to fall madly into the most beautiful relationship they could ever imagine?
