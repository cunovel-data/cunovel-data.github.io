{"id":82727,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"All of the color bleeds from Cruise\u0027s face. He staggers a moment until Dr. Beefcake shoves some smelling salts under his nose and perks him back to startled attention. \"You\u0027d better take a seat, buddy.\" Dr. Gaines tries shoving Cruise in a chair but he resists the effort. \"I\u0027m fine, really.\" The doctor nods and leaves the room, sealing the door behind him. A rail of panic rips through me, and suddenly I want to be anywhere but in this over-bright room with, of all people, the unsuspecting father of my surprise pregnancy. \"Pregnant?\" His brows dip into a sharp V, and it makes him look undeniably provocative. Although, I\u0027m pretty sure now\u0027s not a good time to drool over his astonishing good looks, especially since committing a felony or two against me is clearly still on the table. \"You\u0027re going think this is funny.\" I open my mouth to tell him all about my egregious oversight at the free clinic then remember his seventeen-year-old sister is tangled in that web as well. Speaking of which, I\u0027m thrilled Dr. Muscles didn\u0027t remember me from his rotation at said free clinic. \"I\u0027m going to think what\u0027s funny?\" He tilts his head because he so knows it\u0027s not. \"Oh, um... you see...\" Fuck. Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck. This isn\u0027t going to end well. Cruise is going to explode when he finds out I couldn\u0027t figure out how to use a simple birth control pill. \"I...\" Words dam up in my throat, and I hesitate in spewing out a sea of lies. \"Kenny...\" His forehead wrinkles, with deep concern. Cruise pulls me in. He wraps his arms around my waist with a strong, hearty embrace. \"Is this what you thought I would hate you for?\" He huffs a laugh. \"I could never hate you. And something like this - you didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\" He pulls back, and his lips twist as he considers this. \"Besides, you can\u0027t be pregnant. You\u0027re on the pill.\" His face swells with relief. \"All that puking messed with your brain. You must have forgot.\" My mouth opens to correct him, and nothing but air comes out. \"You\u0027re not on the pill?\" He says it pressured, his face flooding with panic. God, he\u0027s going to think I\u0027m a liar - that I\u0027m one of those girls who feels the need to fill a void in her life by \"planning\" a pregnancy. Right about now he\u0027s probably thinking that whole virgin thing was a ruse, too. \"Kenny? What\u0027s going on? Talk to me.\" He\u0027s got a frightened look on his face that suggests he just realized he\u0027s been drilling without hardware. The nurse comes in and instructs me to follow her - so I do. When I finally make my way back to the tiny white room, Cruise has long since defected. I bet he\u0027s clearing all my crap out of his house right this minute - ransacking his wallet for the receipt on that coat he bought. I should have known it would be my own stupidity that would ruin things between the two of us and not some fictitious inclination in him to \"cheat.\" If anything, that night at the restaurant proved Cruise doesn\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass about other girls. That waitress could have qualified as a bona fide supermodel on seven different planets. You could see the invitation she was giving him, plain as the boob job wedging out of her blouse. But it was me Cruise hauled to the back. It was me he thrust all of his affection into until I thought my spine would snap from the pressure - me he pleasured until I gave a heated scream. Now, the only one screaming will be Cruise as he runs the other way when he sees me coming. Face it. We\u0027re over. And now we\u0027re going to have a baby of all things to remind us both for the next eighteen years what a complete idiot I am. My brother, Morgan, was an accident. My dad hung out just long enough to produce me then made a beeline for the state line before I hit preschool. That would paint a rosy picture for Cruise and me. I would give anything to have him love me with that body just one more time. The nurse walks in and jolts me back to reality. \"Kendall Jordan?\" She gives a knowing smile. \"I have your results.\" After the nurse breaks the news, I speed out of the bowels of the medical facility and through the waiting room, hoping to chase down Cruise\u0027s truck, but it\u0027s still safely parked in the lot sans its drop dead gorgeous owner. I spin around, and there he is with that sexy, devilish grin. He wraps his arms around my waist and plants a full kiss on my lips that neither feels like a felony in the making, nor angry in the least. \"So tell me\" - his breath evokes a plume of fog, round as a halo - \"am I going to be a father?\" He expels it with such peace, such wonder and beauty, that for a fleeting moment I wish it were true. \"Not this time.\" I give a wry smile. \"But you just might get the flu.\" \"The flu?\" He touches his forehead to mine as he breathes a sigh of relief. \"I was sort of rooting for the baby.\" I let out a laugh, and for the first time in twenty-four hours, I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m going to hurl a lung. \"You\u0027re off the hook,\" I say, slipping my hands into his sweatshirt to keep from shivering. \"I can deal with that for now, but one day we\u0027re going to have an entire tribe of gorgeous dark-haired children.\" \"A tribe?\" I take in a breath at the thought. \"With those genes? You owe it to humanity.\" Cruise and I get into the truck, and he runs the heater while I tell him about my misunderstanding with the little magic pill. Turns out, putting a \"hat\" on it was simply a precautionary measure for the first cycle. \"That, and it helps prevent STDs.\" He nods into his knowledge of all things prophylactic. Oh shit! I didn\u0027t even think of STDs. Gah! Having sex with Cruise means I\u0027ve technically had sex with hundreds of girls - wait, that doesn\u0027t sound right, but I think it totally is. His eyes round out in horror at my silent, yet terrified, reaction. \"I swear to you\" - Cruise gently picks up my hand - \"I\u0027m clean. I just had a physical before school let out for winter break. I\u0027m free and clear, and I\u0027ve never had a single thing.\" \"Oh, um...\" Forget about me. I need to warn Molly before she becomes infected with all sorts of warts and blisters no thanks to Brayden I-Sleep-With-Sluts Holmes. \"Actually no, I wasn\u0027t thinking about STDs.\" Because apparently, I\u0027m an idiot. Turns out, I was more worried about babies than I was rabies. \"You went on the pill just for me?\" He looks humbled by the idea. I don\u0027t answer right away. Instead, I press his hand against my lips. \"And you thought, we were going to have a baby.\" He reaches over and covers me with his arms, tightening his grip around me as if I might drift away. \"Kenny\" - he bounces a kiss off my temple - \"if something like that happened, you don\u0027t have to hide it from me or think I\u0027m going to hate you. I swear, I\u0027m not going anywhere. I\u0027m in this for the long haul. You couldn\u0027t get rid of me if you tried.\" \"Then I guess you\u0027re stuck with me.\" I take him in against the backdrop of a deep navy night. \"And I guess you\u0027re stuck with me.\" He cradles my face in his hands and examines me as if he\u0027s peeled back all the layers and is seeing something new, something far more defined than before. \"I love you, Kendall Jordan.\" He offers the softest kiss under a bed of burgeoning stars that peer in through the windshield. I pull back and soak in all of his perfection both inside and out. \"I love you, too, Cruise Elton.\" Cruise In the next few weeks, the north winds scour the sky clean. They scrub the details out of the fir-lined hillsides and draw the oils from the eucalyptus like perfume straight from the throne of God. Kenny and I file through the syllabus of my own making as if it were some sexual bucket list that begged to race to completion. On a Tuesday, at five-thirty in the morning, I convince Kenny to join me in watching the sunrise from Barrels\u0027 cliff side. Barrels, lies tucked at the distal end of a thicket, a good thirty-minutes away. Juniper and myrtles gnarl their branches together, locked in a perennial swordfight as I drive the truck down the congested dirt road. I happen to know firsthand, Barrels affords the best damn view of the sunrise. \"My dad took me here once.\" I confess. \"We went camping when I was a kid.\" I may only have a handful of memories when it comes to my father, but that camping trip we took when I was seven burns in my mind, alive and fluid. For some unknowable reason, I\u0027m able to crawl back into the moment and live it over and over again. It was the last time I did anything of quality with the man who would grow to be Pennington\u0027s father, not mine. Maybe that\u0027s why I held on so strong. It was the eulogy of the father-son relationship that would never progress beyond that point. \"Really? Did Pen go with you? I bet you beat him up a lot.\" She bites the air, teasing. Kenny rolls her head back, slow and easy. Her neck peaks as if calling my lips to bless it. Her sleepy eyes send a silent invitation to drown in her kisses. Kenny is the heroin and the wine - the choice opiate of the gods, and I want nothing more than to lap her up by the bowlful. \"Nope, not Pen - just my dad and me. It was the last time he ever made the effort. I keep thinking about how beautiful this place is. In my mind, it\u0027s become this living postcard.\" \"Is that why you wanted me to see it?\" She says it soft, uncertain of what my real intentions might be. \"No.\" I park as deep inside the overgrowth as possible before killing the engine. \"I was sort of hoping to stomp out all those old memories and make some new ones today - with you.\" I reach back and grab the fleece-lined sleeping bag I keep for emergencies. It weighs ten pounds, but you can survive a subarctic winter nestled inside it if you had to. We get out and make our way to the edge. The cliff is blocked off by wood fencing that\u0027s cracked in two places like a car might have tried to plow through, and I know for a fact a couple of them did. A tangerine glow surprises the darkness far in the east and sprays the new day with promise. \"Come here.\" Kenny pulls me in and lays her cushioned lips over mine. \"Let\u0027s hop in the back of the truck and start building that memory.\" She dips her iced hand into my sweats, and I take a quick breath. \"Sounds like you mean business. Let\u0027s give the sun another thirty seconds to show.\" I help her to the hood of the truck then spread the sleeping bag over the roof. \"Have I mentioned I\u0027m afraid of heights?\" she asks as we climb to the roof. \"You make me feel safe.\" \"You make me feel safe.\" I echo the sentiment. Kenny purrs as she washes those pale stone eyes over me. \"Hey...anybody can do the back of the truck,\" she whispers it smooth like a promise. \"But the roof at sunrise...how would you like to build that memory?\" \"The roof,\" I muse. \"You, my love, are frightfully brilliant.\" \"And eager to please.\" She peels off her shirt in one lithe move. I pull the sleeping bag over us, slip off both my sweats and Kenny\u0027s as though they were one. Kenny closes her hand over me and guides me toward my newfound nirvana. I cup her breast and give a gentle squeeze. \"This is my new favorite way to start the day.\" I inhale sharply as she pushes me deep inside her warm body. My hands ride over her smooth skin, and I pull her knees up high to afford maximum entry. I secure her by the shoulders and push in with soft easy waves, trying not to launch either of us off the truck in the process. When Kenny walked into my life, she blew all of my bad luck away like dust. Kenny is the anti-Blair, the one I could love forever and then that wouldn\u0027t be enough. Together we were ushering in a new day with all of our explosive passion, the frigid mountain air can\u0027t cool the fire brewing inside the two of us. Kenny peeled away the old memories, the ones born of pain and yearning. She filled in the crevices of my thirsty soul better than my father could have, far better than any of those one-night stands could ever hope to do. This is a new dawn in our lives, the beginning of the best season - the very first bite of sweet, delicious fruit that would satisfy for a lifetime. We ride the waves of our affection, and I hold out until she\u0027s panting, just about to detonate. Then I release, and we shake uncontrollably for a few of the most blissful moments that love has to offer. I always want to remember Kenny like this - the kiss of a new day, glowing over her skin. \"Good or great?\" I heave the words in her ear through a ragged breath. \"Neither.\" She plants a wet kiss over my lips. \"It was perfect.\" Her hair encircles her marble features like a charcoal-colored wreath. Her eyes reflect the virginal morning light, clear as cellophane. \"I think we\u0027re perfect Kenny.\" I collapse over her just as the sun pierces us with its luminescent joy. We birthed a new memory at sunrise. We made it happen. With Kenny all things are possible. Weeks sweep by, and the bed and breakfast, much like my mother, is hobbling on its last leg. Thank God for Molly, crutches, and home health nurses who are willing to pop in every now again. But, mostly, thank God for Kenny, who not only brings Mom and Molly hot meals, but is helping out at the salon when needed. Mom and I sit in her bedroom, which she sacrificially ventured up to on my behalf. She takes a breath after espousing the woes of the B\u0026B. \"I\u0027ve got one couple next weekend, but after that, it\u0027s dead.\" She laments while digging through the top drawer of her antique dresser. The furniture has been in the family for generations - sage and cream oak, inlaid with carvings that decorate the edges. Mom took the smallest room in the house to make sure the guests would have a great view of the stream out back and the sun as it sets over the hillside. Molly has a room downstairs behind the kitchen, and now that Mom is gimpy, she\u0027s bunking in my old room next door. But today, she hobbled up a flight of stairs to gift me with what\u0027s going to be one of the most treasured memories I have ever known. \"You didn\u0027t give this to Blair,\" she says, cradling my grandmother\u0027s ring in the cup of her hand. \"Nope. Went store-bought, three months of imaginary wages down the drain, but I\u0027m not too broken up over it.\" \"That\u0027s because I let you sell my vintage Beetle for the damn thing.\" Her marionette lines depress as she holds back a laugh. \"Honey, you sure you\u0027re ready for this?\" Her voice shakes as she hands me the round platinum band. It holds a simple diamond in the center and winks in the light as if my grandmother herself approved of the situation. \"I\u0027m more than sure.\" \"You could take your time - sew your wild oats. If she\u0027s really the one, things will work out in the end.\" \"Sewing my oats wasn\u0027t all it was cracked up to be.\" \"I figured those bad boy shoes never really fit you.\" She runs her fingers through my hair and lifts my chin in her direction. My mother has aged decades these last few years. She used to believe in love, have men in her life, and brim with excitement each day, then the last one took off and she never recovered. \"How about you?\" I toss the ring in the air and catch it. \"Are you writing off that chapter in your life, or are the books still open to finding that perfect someone?\" \"There\u0027s always room for someone to love, Cruise. It\u0027s just about finding that special person. It\u0027s all about time and place.\" \"I thought it was about destiny and soul mates,\" I say, half-teasing. \"It\u0027s mostly that.\" She winks. \"A little magic now and again doesn\u0027t hurt either.\" That\u0027s the exact ingredient I\u0027m looking for to make this next moment with Kenny most memorable - magic. On Valentine\u0027s Day, I drive Kenny up north to the Alexander estate on a crystalline afternoon that makes the snow on the ground glitter like fallen stars. \"Is Pennington somehow involved in this surprise?\" She makes a face as she notes his sports car parked in the circular drive. \"God, I hope not,\" I mutter under my breath, driving down another quarter mile to the barn where Jackie houses her prized thoroughbreds. Kenny\u0027s face lights up as she spots the horses roaming free in the corral. They\u0027re all regal in their own right, but it\u0027s the Appaloosa that\u0027s my favorite - black and white spots like a leopard. Kenny is going to look like an angel riding him through the fields. \"Horses?\" Her face smooths out in wonder as we park by the stalls. I head around to her side and take up her hand. The sun starts to dip in the west, washing the landscape in gold. \"We\u0027d better hurry before we lose light,\" I say as we make our way toward the overgrown barn. \"What are we doing? Are we going to ride?\" Her dark hair whips around her face until she shakes it out and makes the wind sweep it back in perfect compliance. It doesn\u0027t surprise me that Kenny can get the elements to do her bidding. \"Nope, no riding,\" I tease. \"Just cleaning up around here. I\u0027ve been working for Jackie since I was fifteen. She pays me fifty bucks to scour the stalls clean once a month. I thought I\u0027d bring along a helping hand.\" I give her shoulder a little squeeze. \"No way. We\u0027re shoveling Jackie\u0027s horse crap for a lousy fifty bucks?\" She gives a wry smile before dotting me with a kiss. \"Okay. I\u0027m in.\" A gentle laugh rolls through me. \"Actually, that was yesterday - and the fifty bucks comes in handy now and again. But for now, I have something a little better planned.\" At least I hope she thinks it\u0027s a little better. The truth is, I\u0027m shaking like a virgin on prom night. My palms won\u0027t stop sweating. I keep wiping them down on my jeans, trying to get a grip as each moment passes. \"I have a gift for you.\" I bring her hand to my lips and press in a kiss. Kenny keeps her arm strapped around my waist as I lead her to the back. We bypass stall after stall, the scent of lemon oil clots up the air from the wash I gave the walnut doors a month ago. Our shoes scuff through the hay, creating a hushed whisper as I walk her over to a large box with a bow on it. It\u0027s light as a feather, and I gingerly hand it to her. I decided to ditch the wrapping in the event one of Jackie\u0027s prized equine possessions decided to fill its stomach with parchment. She\u0027d undoubtedly sue my ass the second they shit tinfoil. \"Cruise! You didn\u0027t have to do this.\" \"I wanted to.\" I press in a quick kiss and nod for her to open it. Kenny pulls back the ribbon. She lifts the lid, and her eyes round out in wonder. \"Boots!\" Her lips quiver. \"They\u0027re lined with fleece, so they\u0027ll keep you warm.\" Kenny holds up the sable-colored leather and admires them. \"They come with a stacked heel, so you can propagate your vixen-like ways.\" My heart thumps as she continues to examine them. I almost opted for the homelier ones that cost twice as much just to keep Kenny from looking so damn hot on campus, but Kenny\u0027s beauty is a fire I can never put out - wouldn\u0027t even want to try. \"Thank you.\" Her eyes glitter with tears as she buries her arms in their warmth. She looks up at me from under her lashes and sighs. \"I love you.\" \"I love you, too.\" I land my lips over hers and linger before pulling away. \"Let\u0027s check them out.\" I help her put them on, trading her high tops for something that might actually ward off frostbite. \"I think I\u0027ve died and gone to Heaven.\" She moans as her feet sink into the plush reserve. \"That good, huh?\" She gives an impish grin. Her mascara is smudged in the corners from the fresh dab of tears. \"It\u0027s because you\u0027re in my life.\" She warms my mouth with an exploratory kiss. For a second, I think maybe we should lie down right here in the hay, but I\u0027ve got a ring burning a hole in my pocket and the sun is working against me. \"Let\u0027s do this.\" I pull Lady Luck Tonight out of the stall and saddle her up. I help Kenny climb onboard and she gives a solid yank to the reins. \"Whoa.\" I jump off the stall, landing behind her. Kenny hands me the leather straps, and I teach her how to use them as we make our way out of the barn. \"We\u0027re going to kill this poor thing,\" she whimpers with her body pressed against mine. Our hips move in time, slow and circular. \"She can handle it.\" I bury a kiss in Kenny\u0027s hair, close my eyes, and soak in the glory of the moment. \"She\u0027s sturdy and stout. She\u0027s got the endurance of a Mack truck. Plus, we\u0027re heading out less than a mile.\" We make our way past the corral, and the chaparrals press themselves against the sky like felt. Kenny scoots to the back of the saddle as far as she can, and I wrap my arms around her. I pepper her with kisses as we disappear down the bridle trail laden with bare maples. The evergreens loom, large and daunting, like nefarious shadows that refuse to give their secrets. \"I\u0027ve never done anything like this.\" Kenny touches her fingers to my cheek, and I kiss them. \"You really know how to pull the magic from the air.\" And there it is. Magic. Kenny feels it, and so do I. Lady Luck pulls in just shy of the meadow by the frozen pond. A spray of dappled light filters through the centurion Oak. Plumes of ethereal sunshine rise in vapors, transforming the snow-covered landscape into something just this side of a fairytale. I hop down and help Kenny slip into my arms before leading us over to the boulders that skirt the area. Kenny pulls me in gently by the neck and loves me with her lingering kisses. God, I want her right here in the frozen tundra of the Alexander estate. I envision us laid out like silhouette cutouts, her hair sprayed out like ebony wings. I drop to my knees, and she follows me down. I pinch my lips at the oversight. \"You weren\u0027t supposed to do that.\" I can\u0027t hide the smile anymore. Joy has bubbled to the surface like hope unstoppable. \"Was I supposed to do this?\" She unbuttons my jeans and looks up at me with a dare. I pull the ring from my pocket before we have my hard-on splitting the difference between us as a lasting matrimonial memory. \"I love you, Kenny.\" I draw in a ragged breath. \"You saved me. You taught me to breathe and showed me how to appreciate the beauty in every single moment. I never want to be without you.\" I lick my lips, and the glacial breeze bites over them. \"Kenny, I beg of you from the bottom of my heart - please, be my wife.\" I hold out the ring like an offering. My cheek slides up on the side, and I hold my breath as her eyes widen with disbelief. I give an apprehensive smile. \"Marry me - yes, or no?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1/page-17.html","bookId":1870,"book":{"id":1870,"title":"Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1)","description":"Storyline: Someone to Love (Someone to Love #1) What happens when two people who don’t believe in love, happen to fall madly into the most beautiful relationship they could ever imagine?
