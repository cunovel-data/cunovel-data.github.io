{"id":82712,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Coke or Pepsi?\" the Adonis before me asks, as if the only thing he intends on quenching is my thirst. I think inaugurating me as his love slave for the evening is more specific to the point.\\n\\n He\u0027s tall with broad shoulders and light blue eyes the color that rain wishes it could be. He sports a five o\u0027clock shadow, the stubble is a little darker than the caramel hair protruding from his ball cap. His cheeks are cut high and chiseled. He\u0027s one of those guys - the ones that make your stomach squeeze tight with just one wayward look. We\u0027ve been stealing glances for the better part of an hour even though he was seven-deep in girls, two of them gnawing on his ear and neck respectively.\\n\\n The Christmas lights on the anemic tree behind him blink on and off spastically in a rainbow of holiday hues with a pink bulb winking out of synch.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t played Questions since ninth grade,\" I say, turning to the burgeoning crowd, pretending like I\u0027m not interested. Not that I didn\u0027t get the fact he was offering me a drink. Honestly, if a guy of his loose moral caliber wants to sleep with me, the first thing I\u0027m going to do is make his brain cells strain a little - that is, if he has any.\\n\\n All I really want to do is find Pennington and convince him to stop guzzling his high-octane beverages long enough to show me to my dorm. That was my first stupid move in what\u0027s panning out to be a bona fide fiasco - trusting a moron with my housing arrangements.\\n\\n \"Questions?\" The Adonis dips in with a lewd smile budding on his lips. He\u0027s wearing a white cotton T-shirt and dark inky jeans - my all-time favorite combo on a guy. His tennis shoes look as though they\u0027ve seen their fair share of the great outdoors. He\u0027s probably the type who overindulges in half a dozen sex sports before breakfast. I bet he\u0027s some kind of perverted adrenaline junky. God knows he\u0027s pumping up mine.\\n\\n He drinks me in with a fondling gaze, undressing me with those blue cellophane eyes. He\u0027s rounding out all the bases mentally - he\u0027s already bent me over home plate, I can tell.\\n\\n \"You know, Questions,\" I say, \"Coke or Pepsi, male or female - in or out .\" I\u0027m not sure if peppering the conversation with innuendo is the best idea, although it\u0027s most likely his native language. I look past him at the crowd, trying to distract myself from the fact he\u0027s even more alarmingly handsome up close than he was clear across the room.\\n\\n \"In or out?\" He says, seductively. \"Definitely in, and for sure, female.\" He gives it in a heated whisper just over my ear and rips a fire through my insides, awakening something in me on a primal level. His voice resonates above the raucous music, and my eyes close involuntarily at the quasi proposition.\\n\\n Shit. I startle to my senses and scan the room for the simpleton I might be moved to strangle once I locate. It\u0027s my first day here at Garrison, and I\u0027ve landed at some frat party hosted by my mom\u0027s best friend\u0027s son, at Alpha Sigma Phi, with my luggage sitting in the corner still fresh from the airport.\\n\\n The Adonis pushes out a smile, and a pair of deep-set dimples go off, rendering me defenseless.\\n\\n Honest to God, I\u0027m about five minutes from pulling Mr. Coke or Pepsi into the corner and raking my body against his. Not that I\u0027ve ever done that before, nor have I ever been motivated to do so. But after a long travel day, and a four-hour layover in five-inch heels, spontaneous sex doesn\u0027t sound so bad.\\n\\n \"Cruise Elton.\" He shoves his hand at me as if we were about to conduct business, and something in me softens to him. His glacial eyes burn into mine. He\u0027s watching me, drilling his watery pools through all of the formidable layers I hide beneath. He\u0027s inspecting me for the truth, for the underpinnings of who I really am. I bet he\u0027s embroiled in deep philosophical questions like do I know how to properly utilize my tongue and whether or not I have a piercing that could pleasure him into an erotic nirvana.\\n\\n \"Kendall Jordan,\" I yell over the music, taking up his warm, thick fingers. He feels safe, reliable, and something stirs in me when we touch.\\n\\n \"Nice to meet you Kenny.\" He gives a wicked grin and swivels his hips into mine. He\u0027s still acting like the playboy he\u0027s been for the last hour, but something in his eyes tempers when he says my name, albeit incorrectly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Kendall,\" I repeat, rubbing my thumb over his knuckles, memorizing how he feels before letting go. I wish I were one of \"those\" girls. If I were ever going to be one, tonight would be the night.\\n\\n \"You look more like a Kenny to me. Cute and sporty.\" He plucks off his baseball cap revealing dark blond waves before settling it over his head again. His shirt rises over his tan stomach, offering me a glimpse of rippling muscles, solid as granite, and I resist the urge to run my fingers over him like some erotic form of Brail.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what he wants from me. At least six girls stood ready to commit an entire slew of indecent acts with him right here in the commons room with total disregard to the bodies crammed into this place. I\u0027m still in the awkward glances phase when it comes to guys. For sure I haven\u0027t graduated to one-night stands at frat parties.\\n\\n I grind my heel into the floor. Perhaps it was my sexy stilettos that inspired him to slither on over.\\n\\n \"You go to Garrison?\" He takes a swig from his soda. Odd that it\u0027s not a beer but a refreshing change of pace. On second thought, he\u0027s probably got it locked and loaded with an eighty-proof fuel enhancer.\\n\\n \"Just transferred in.\" I turn in an effort to shut down the prospect of evoking an erection out of him, but he\u0027s quick to jump back in my line of vision. \"Look...\" I sigh. \"I\u0027m actually engaged to Pennington.\" Sadly, I\u0027ve resorted to playing fast and loose with the truth in hopes he\u0027ll find someone else to sexually assault for the evening.\\n\\n He nearly chokes on his drink. \"Really?\" His face ignites in an ear-to-ear grin like he knows I\u0027m lying.\\n\\n \"Really. Our mother\u0027s arranged the whole thing when we were like twelve.\" I leave out the part about meeting Pen for the first time last week in cyberspace. \"He\u0027s pretty nice.\" Nice as a donkey\u0027s ass but that\u0027s none of Cruise Elton\u0027s freaking business. Besides, I don\u0027t like the smug look on his face, like I\u0027m fresh meat ready for the sexual slaughter.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too bad about the betrothal,\" he says, moving in close as an entire stream of bodies push in behind him. His soft cologne wraps around me like a pair of strong arms, and I feel the heat radiating from his body, covering me like a coat.\\n\\n A linebacker carrying a keg in his arms, barrels through the center of the room, parting the crowd like a Red Sea miracle. The swell of humanity forces Cruise into me and we land flattened against the wall, with his iron abs pressed against me so tight you couldn\u0027t squeeze a quarter between us. His hips adhere to mine with a noticeable protrusion pressed against my thigh.\\n\\n Cruise runs his heavy gaze over my features. His lips part involuntarily. We lock eyes, and neither of us moves from this compromising position.\\n\\n The music dies down and a familiar Christmas carol belts over the speakers, inspiring a bunch of girls in the corner to sing along.\\n\\n He grazes his bottom lip with his perfect straight teeth, so unearthly white they glow. \"Do you believe in love at first sight, Kenny?\"\\n\\n Everything in me freezes. If I did believe in love at first sight, I would hope it would be with someone as godlike as Cruise Elton who saw fit to back me in a corner and bless me with his rock hard body - but, alas, the answer is no.\\n\\n \"After my mom\u0027s fifth marriage ended, I stopped believing in love and Santa.\" It comes out much cheerier than the sad news it really is.\\n\\n He pulls his cheek to the side and gives a sexy smile that sears me with heat in places I\u0027ve never felt before.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe in it, either. But you can\u0027t tell me Santa isn\u0027t real.\" His grin widens. \"I knew I liked you.\" He cups the side of my face and swallows hard. Gone is the playful flirt as his features take a turn for the serious. His eyes close as he comes in for the kill. My heart gives a few wild thumps, alerting me to the fact that Cruise Cock on Fire Elton has the power to induce a cardiac episode in me if he wanted.\\n\\n \"Whoa.\" I slap my hands over his chest and give a good shove. \"Sorry, cowboy, I\u0027m not into one-night stands either. I get it. I really do,\" I say, trying to maneuver my way from under him. \"You\u0027re on a road show with your penis, and trust me, I\u0027m the last person who wants to get in your way. But I\u0027m telling you, operation occupy-my-vagina is a no-go for the evening.\"\\n\\n \"Road show?\" He mouths the words, perplexed by my penile analogy, just long enough for me to twist myself free and speed over to a couple of girls as if I knew them. They\u0027re standing in front of a vast display of beverages, all of which guarantee a hangover with the exception of Coke or Pepsi.\\n\\n I dart a glance back to Cruise only to find he\u0027s once again surrounded by his hormone happy harem.\\n\\n A brunette digs her hand into the back of his jeans while a gorgeous blonde whispers in his ear, inspiring a laugh out of him. My stomach cinches at the sight of all those bimbos pawing at him. An unexpected pang of jealousy spreads through my chest, and I force myself to look away.\\n\\n \"Nice,\" I whisper.\\n\\n \"Ally Monroe.\" A chipper blonde with bright red lipstick takes up my hand. She\u0027s wrapped in a black-and-white-checkered coat, paired with patent leather boots that inch past her knees. I have on my less-than-warm jean jacket and spiked knock-off Manolos. Having lived in L.A. all my life, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m ill-prepared for a brutal Massachusetts winter.\\n\\n \"Kendall,\" I say to the two of them.\\n\\n \"Lauren Ashby.\" The brunette gives a brief nod. Her hair cascades around her shoulders in waves, and I admire it for a moment. My own hair hangs long and for the most part, straight - dark as soot. Most of the time it just looks like a bad Halloween wig. \"We see you\u0027ve met Cruise.\" She tips her head back and laughs, revealing a pair of light-up Christmas tree earrings hidden beneath her dark tresses.\\n\\n \"Is he a graduation requirement?\" I ask. Not that I\u0027m anywhere near graduation. I\u0027m a sophomore who recently upgraded her undeclared status to Liberal Arts with no real intention of doing anything productive with it.\\n\\n Lauren laughs so hard she spills her drink over her bright red heels. \"No, but God, wouldn\u0027t that be great? Actually, he\u0027s a mess. Stay away from him. He had a rough time last summer, and now he\u0027s nothing but a ball of testosterone on fire.\"\\n\\n \"He was shit on.\" Ally nods as if to testify to this.\\n\\n \"He was shat on.\" Lauren spears her with a look. \"Get your grammar straight.\"\\n\\n Pennington struts by with his collar turned up like a preppy and a pair of sunglasses firmly planted over his face, which cements any pending douchebag status I may have afforded him. I\u0027ve seen enough pictures to know it\u0027s him, plus we Skyped twice last week to finalize my arrangements. He was supposed to pick me up from the airport, but he said he had a last-minute \"emergency,\" so I blew through half the twenties in my wallet just transporting myself to this hotbed of immorality. Something tells me the crisis had to do with malt-grained liquor.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s my future husband,\" I say sarcastically, mostly to myself since they\u0027re both locked in a heated argument over semantics.\\n\\n \"Pennington?\" Ally\u0027s mouth squares out and the two of them break out in cackles.\\n\\n I speed over and yank him aside.\\n\\n \"Hey! How\u0027s it going? It\u0027s me, Kendall!\" I pony up all the mock enthusiasm I can muster. \"The party was fun and all, but I sort of just want to get settled in my room. Can I have the key?\"\\n\\n Pennington secured me a dorm on campus, which is really hard to do since they\u0027re usually booked by August, and here it is December, so I guess it\u0027s sort of my Christmas miracle.\\n\\n His lips crimp. \"About that...\"\\n\\n Or not.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" I don\u0027t need to be Nancy Drew to know this isn\u0027t going to end well.\\n\\n \"Nothing happened.\" He sloshes his drink over the floor as if trying to wave off the absurdity. Pennington is tall and decent in the looks department, not in the caustic jump-in-my-bed sort of way that Cruise is - Pen is more your stoner boy next door. I\u0027m sure every female within a twenty-mile radius would love nothing more than to drag Cruise off to the nearest bushes, and Pennington - well, he\u0027s the reason girls carry mace in their purse.\\n\\n He nods into me. \"You\u0027re going to have to crash here a few nights, just until I get everything squared away with the housing department. Turns out I didn\u0027t get your name in on time.\" He rolls his eyes as if little details like that were annoyingly unimportant. \"But you\u0027re on a waiting list - put you there myself.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" A thread of panic spikes through me. \"I\u0027m homeless?\" It comes out more of a whimper than a question.\\n\\n \"No.\" He begins to sway because clearly, he\u0027s wasted out of his irresponsible mind. \"When school opens up again, we\u0027ll get this whole stupid thing straightened out.\"\\n\\n \"This whole stupid thing?\" I\u0027m so ticked I\u0027m ready to douse him with the contents of his bright red Solo. \"School doesn\u0027t open for another three weeks,\" I squawk. \"I was supposed to get settled, not arrested for trespassing. I can\u0027t stay here.\" I fan my arms out at the debauchery just as a dark-haired boy pukes in the center of the room.\\n\\n \"Suit yourself.\" He starts walking away. \"Hey, my mom invited you to dinner Christmas eve.\" He gives a thumbs up before melting into the crowd. Pennington Thurston Alexander the Third is an ass of the highest order. And with a name like that, who could really blame him?\\n\\n What to do?\\n\\n What to freaking do!\\n\\n I guess there\u0027s always Aunt Jackie. She\u0027s not my real aunt and I\u0027ve yet to see or speak to her. All I know is that she and my mother were besties growing up and kept in touch over the years. They both went to Garrison and now her unreliable spawn and I are following in their footsteps. I guess I could shake Pennington down for her number. I\u0027m sure she wouldn\u0027t want me seeking shelter on park benches or vomit-riddled frat rooms. Although, I\u0027m not too enthused with the idea of shacking up with the elders, either. I\u0027ve been dreaming of having the full collegiate experience ever since I received my acceptance letter back in May. Having to wait until winter seemed bad enough already.\\n\\n I scan the room for Lauren and Ally. Surely they have a couch I can crash on tonight and maybe the next three weeks - at this point, I\u0027d take the next three days. I pick up my pace and begin circling the room. Lauren cackles from the entry, and I catch them heading outside.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" I bolt for my suitcase before maneuvering toward the door, but navigating my way out of this human maze is like moving boulders.\\n\\n I make it to the porch, and the cool dew baptizes me with the scent of night jasmine. My suitcase bounces out of the house from behind and slices a nice, clean gash into my ankle.\\n\\n \"Pennington!\" Somehow shouting his name as an expletive makes the situation a little more bearable.\\n\\n I look up in time to see a black Jeep pull away with Ally in the passenger\u0027s seat.\\n\\n \"Great.\" I let out a hard sigh and clop down the rest of the stairs like I actually have someplace to go. In the distance an owl gives an eerie cry. The wind licks the wound at my ankle with its iced tongue and I shiver. I\u0027ve never been alone like this before, in a strange town with nowhere to go. It\u0027s as though I laid myself in a steel jaw trap and the cruel world were closing in on me with its nefarious arms.\\n\\n A couple to my left laughs while locked in an embrace. It\u0027s not until they pull away do I see it\u0027s Cruise and a tall redhead wearing thigh-high boots and a miniskirt violating more than its fair share of public indecency laws.\\n\\n He catches my eye and holds it a second before glancing down at my suitcase. My stomach explodes with heat at the sight of him. Cruise whispers something in her ear, inspiring me to turn away as if I were at a bus stop waiting for my invisible ride - only I\u0027m not. I\u0027m stuck at Garrison, at Alpha Sigma Phi no less - tomorrow is Christmas Eve, I\u0027m homeless, and hungry, and my feet are pissed off and bleeding.\\n\\n \"Hey, Kenny.\" Cruise swoops in and gleams a boastful smile.\\n\\n I glance over in time to catch the girl in the thigh-highs making her way back to the party.\\n\\n I give a private smile at the thought of Cruise striking out so close to midnight.\\n\\n \"I would have pegged her for a homerun,\" I say.\\n\\n \"She was.\" He gives a lopsided grin and takes a hold of my suitcase. \"But I\u0027d rather grab a bite with you.\"\\n\\n Cruise\\n\\n The moon glows overhead clear as a streetlamp, making the clouds look like black paper cutouts against the navy expanse. The sky threatens us with rain, but since the heater is out at my place, with my luck, I\u0027m betting on snow.\\n\\n But, for whatever reason, my run of bad juju seems to have temporarily halted because a goddess by the name of Kendall Jordan is sitting in my truck with one hell of a banging hot bod. And, holy shit, would I ever love to bang that body. But she\u0027s not the banging type. She made that abundantly clear when she accused my dick of having a \"road show.\" She\u0027s funny as hell, though, I\u0027ll give her that.\\n\\n We pull into the Johnny Burgers lot, and I slow down as we pass the front.\\n\\n \"Drive-thru or dine in?\" I ask, hinting at the game of Questions from earlier.\\n\\n She leans over and inspects the place. Her hair drapes over her shoulder like a long black scarf, and her pale grey eyes glow like those of a cat. Instinctively, I want to reach over and touch her but resist the effort. I have a feeling I\u0027ll be doing a lot of resisting around Kenny in the very near future. She\u0027s not the type to voluntarily fall on her knees, and that alone makes me want her twice as bad.\\n\\n I look over to the burger joint. The windows are painted with a snowy scene of Santa making his way down a chimney with burgers and fries bursting from his sack. Miles of holly garland outline the doors. I look for the mistletoe - no such luck.\\n\\n Kenny blinks into the place with her long dark lashes, and the lights go out in the establishment before she can answer.\\n\\n \"I guess that\u0027s drive-thru,\" I say, pulling in and we place our orders. Kenny hasn\u0027t said much, other than filling me in on Pennington\u0027s housing botch up. I\u0027m not used to quiet girls. Moaning girls - screaming girls, now that I\u0027m used to. Quiet worries me, makes me feel as if I\u0027m doing something wrong.\\n\\n She reaches for her purse.\\n\\n \"No, I got it.\" I pay the girl in the window before Kenny can mime the offer. I catch her inspecting me with what I\u0027m hoping to God is lust but can just as easily be regret for ever setting foot in my truck, so I busy myself with putting away my wallet. \"You\u0027re so damn good-looking it borders on illegal.\" I say it calm, more as a fact than something engineered to land her in bed. I think both me and my dick have come to terms with the fact Kenny Jordan isn\u0027t choosing in tonight.\\n\\n She blushes a severe shade of pomegranate, and a sharp bite of heat cuts through me. I can\u0027t remember the last time I made a girl blush. Hell I didn\u0027t know they could blush, at least not the man-eaters I associate myself with.\\n\\n \"Thank you, I think.\" She averts her gaze out the blackened window.\\n\\n I take in her pale skin, her perfect full lips and my heart pounds against my chest, telling me to knock this shit off or I might accidentally break it again.\\n\\n The food comes through the window, so I hand Kenny the bags and drinks before heading to the overlook across the way. We can eat in peace on the cliff side with nothing but the Atlantic to distract us from ourselves.\\n\\n \"Where we going?\" Her voice spikes as if she suddenly fears for her limbs.\\n\\n \"Just across the street.\" I pull into the lot and land square in front of the wooden fence that separates us from a two hundred foot drop. \"You can see the beach from here.\" I take a quick swig of my soda. \"So, where you from?\"\\n\\n \"California. I love the beach. I practically grew up on one.\" She plays with the thin gold chain around her neck while stretching her gaze over the waterline. \"I\u0027ve never been to Massachusetts before. It looks nice from what I can see of it.\" She nods toward the windshield. \"My mom really wanted me to get into Garrison.\" She unbuckles her seatbelt and dips into the bag, handing me a burger. \"You know\" - she averts her eyes - \"work on that M-R-S. Degree.\" She gives a sexy gurgle when she says it. \"At least that\u0027s what she wants.\"\\n\\n \"M-R-S, huh?\" A tremble of laughter rattles through me. \"Good luck with that.\" I take a giant bite of the artery buster in my hand and wash it down with my drink. \"Standing at the altar is the last place you\u0027ll find me. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m not getting married.\" A knot twists in my gut as if maybe I shouldn\u0027t have been so quick to shoot down any false matrimonial fantasies she might be entertaining - especially not if they involve me. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d be happy to star in any damn fantasy she\u0027s willing to put me in.\\n\\n She plucks out the fries and offers me one, so I accept. There\u0027s not a whole lot I wouldn\u0027t accept from Kenny at the moment.\\n\\n \"No altar for you, huh? That\u0027s because you\u0027re a player.\" She says it as fact.\\n\\n I tick my head back a notch. \"Who says I\u0027m a player?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m a player? Shit. I stare dumbfounded out the window a moment. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve become. I guess bedding my way through the Greek alphabet, by way of sorority girls, will do that to a person.\\n\\n \"Yes, you\u0027re a player.\" She looks up at me from under those I-double-dog-dare you-to-get-me-in-bed lashes as she sips from her shake.\\n\\n My gaze dips for a moment, taking in her fully formed, round, incredibly soft-looking cleavage, and my dick perks to attention. I shift and place the bag over my lap in the event things decide to get viral in my Levis.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need a roadmap.\" She purrs it out low - all vixen and hell on heels. \"You had ten girls hanging all over you tonight. I think one of them digested your left ear.\"\\n\\n I catch a glimpse of my slightly singed earlobe in the rearview mirror. \"I think her name was Gina, and in her defense, she was offering a demonstration of what she could do with her mouth.\" I tuck a smile in the side of my cheek, enjoying the color as it blooms over her face and makes her skin glow. \"How about you? You play the game?\" I ask mostly to see if I can get her to blush ten shades deeper, see if the color would bleed down her neck and light up her boobs like a pair of Christmas ornaments. Getting Kenny to emit an afterglow has become my mission in life. Besides, I already know that Kenny Jordon is far from a player, and unfortunately for me, that pretty much takes her out of the running for playmate. Too bad I\u0027m not in the market for a girlfriend, if I were, I\u0027d battle to the death to make sure it was her. \"On second thought, don\u0027t answer. There\u0027s no way in hell you\u0027d even know what to play with.\" This time I bury the smile and go for the cardinal-coated gold. My body ignites with heat just watching her light up a deep velvet crimson.\\n\\n Her mouth falls open. \"No, I\u0027m not a player.\" She says it drawn out, incredulous at my taunt. \"But I could be.\" She crimps a smile, and a tiny dimple implodes in her left cheek. \"If I wanted to.\"\\n\\n Hot fucking damn.\\n\\n Her cleavage magically enlarges as she leans in, and suddenly I\u0027m finding the need to readjust the bag over my lap.\\n\\n \"Although\" - she touches her lower lip with her finger, sending my penis in full scale erotic assault mode - \"I haven\u0027t really even kissed anybody except for the time I was drunk at my senior graduation.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" What the hell is wrong with the guys in California?\\n\\n \"Yeah, really.\" She traces the outline of her lips with her finger.\\n\\n I\u0027d like to do that for her - with my tongue.\\n\\n \"So I guess that means you\u0027re a virgin.\" Shit. Did I just go there? Looks like it\u0027s all systems go to make sure Kenny stays the hell away from me. Nothing like a little self-sabotage coupled with a jab at her virginity to make sure she\u0027s safe from my \"road show.\" Kenny needs some nice kid to sweep her off her feet, not me. I\u0027ve got chains dangling from my bedposts for God\u0027s sake. Nope. There\u0027s not one nice thing about me these days.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a death sentence,\" she scolds. \"Besides, maybe I will take my mother\u0027s unconventional advice. I could hang out with Pennington and see what happens.\" She makes a face as if it\u0027s the last thing on the planet she wants to do.\\n\\n I swallow a laugh. \"I\u0027m pretty sure Pennington isn\u0027t the one for you.\"\\n\\n She postures seductively as her hips grind into the seat. \"Well, I have to start somewhere if I\u0027m going to become the female version of you, don\u0027t I?\" She bites down on the smile waiting to take over as if she\u0027s taunting me.\\n\\n \"Female version of me?\" Intriguing concept, but I\u0027m not buying it. I doubt she is either.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should turn things around for myself\" - she gives an impish grin - \"start taking advantage of all the fresh meat Garrison has to offer. You know, a social experiment.\"\\n\\n \"Social experiment?\" I hold back a laugh. If I didn\u0027t know better I\u0027d think she read my thesis. Has she read my thesis?\\n\\n \"Yeah, I can document my findings on what it feels like to become a female predator. They do exist, you know. The male species doesn\u0027t own exclusive rights to sexual domination.\"\\n\\n \"You want to sexually dominate.\" I find this doubtful. Although if she\u0027s hell-bent on diving into a cesspool of STDs, who am I to stop her? In fact, I might even introduce her to the chains a little sooner than anticipated. \"And, by all means, I volunteer to do the documentation around here.\" I\u0027ll be published by fall.\\n\\n \"I could be the next big player at Garrison.\" She says it, stunned by her own admission. \"I bet I can give you a run for your money.\"\\n\\n \"No you can\u0027t.\" I take a quick swig of my soda. No use in placating her with false ideals. A kitten like her would be eaten alive in the most extravagant sexual fashion if left to the rabid bears on campus.\\n\\n \"Well then, I\u0027ll just have to prove you wrong.\" Her neck arches in a seductive manner, paper-white and long like a pillar.\\n\\n She accepts the challenge as if I just issued a dare.

A train wreck. \\n When twenty-year-old Kendall Jordan transfers clear across country to Garrison University, the last thing she’s looking for is a one-night stand. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what, gorgeous, Cruise Elton offers. \\n Kendall has long since come to realize that love is an illusion that never lasts, and Cruise couldn’t agree more—but something deep inside her wants him all for herself. So, Kendall devises a seat of the pants plan to “play the player” and proposes that Cruise tutor her in becoming a female version of himself, Garrison University’s own playboy. \\n Real feelings begin to emerge, and neither Kendall nor Cruise know how to classify them. Everything they once thought they knew is redefined as they discover, in one another, Someone to Love.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1.jpg","author":"Addison Moore","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:51 PM"}}
