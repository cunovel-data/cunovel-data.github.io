Others lose their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter musically against the ground. Two seem to be considering fainting. The look of shock is unanimous.\\n\\n Now I have Plutarch Heavensbee\u0027s attention. He stares steadily at me as the juice from the peach he crushed in his hand runs through his fingers. Finally he clears his throat and says, \"You may go now, Miss Everdeen.\"\\n\\n I give a respectful nod and turn to go, but at the last moment I can\u0027t resist tossing the container of berry juice over my shoulder. I can hear the contents splatter against the dummy while a couple more wineglasses break. As the elevator doors close before me, I see no one has moved.\\n\\n That surprised them, I think. It was rash and dangerous and no doubt I will pay for it ten times over. But for the moment, I feel something close to elation and I let myself savor it.\\n\\n I want to find Haymitch immediately and tell him about my session, but no one\u0027s around. I guess they\u0027re getting ready for dinner and I decide to go take a shower myself, since my hands are stained from the juice. As I stand in the water, I begin to wonder about the wisdom of my latest trick. The question that should now always be my guide is \"Will this help Peeta stay alive?\" Indirectly, this might not. What happens in training is highly secretive, so there\u0027s no point in taking action against me when no one will know what my transgression was. In fact, last year I was rewarded for my brashness. This is a different sort of crime, though. If the Gamemakers are angry with me and decide to punish me in the arena, Peeta could get caught up in the attack as well. Maybe it was too impulsive. Still ... I can\u0027t say I\u0027m sorry I did it.\\n\\n As we all gather for dinner, I notice Peeta\u0027s hands are faintly stained with a variety of colors, even though his hair is still damp from bathing. He must have done some form of camouflage after all. Once the soup is served, Haymitch gets right to the issue on everyone\u0027s mind. \"All right, so how did your private sessions go?\"\\n\\n I exchange a look with Peeta. Somehow I\u0027m not that eager to put what I did into words. In the calm of the dining room, it seems very extreme. \"You first,\" I say to him. \"It must have been really special. I had to wait for forty minutes to go in.\"\\n\\n Peeta seems to be struck with the same reluctance I\u0027m experiencing. \"Well, I - I did the camouflage thing, like you suggested, Katniss.\" He hesitates. \"Not exactly camouflage. I mean, I used the dyes.\"\\n\\n \"To do what?\" asks Portia.\\n\\n I think of how ruffled the Gamemakers were when I entered the gym for my session. The smell of cleaners. The mat pulled over that spot in the center of the gym. Was it to conceal something they were unable to wash away? \"You painted something, didn\u0027t you? A picture.\" \"Did you see it?\" Peeta asks.\\n\\n \"No. But they\u0027d made a real point of covering it up,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Well, that would be standard. They can\u0027t let one tribute know what another did,\" says Effie, unconcerned. \"What did you paint, Peeta?\" She looks a little misty. \"Was it a picture of Katniss?\"\\n\\n \"Why would he paint a picture of me, Effie?\" I ask, somehow annoyed.\\n\\n \"To show he\u0027s going to do everything he can to defend you. That\u0027s what everyone in the Capitol\u0027s expecting, anyway. Didn\u0027t he volunteer to go in with you?\" Effie says, as if it\u0027s the most obvious thing in the world.\\n\\n \"Actually, I painted a picture of Rue,\" Peeta says. \"How she looked after Katniss had covered her in flowers.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this. \"And what exactly were you trying to accomplish?\" Haymitch asks in a very measured voice.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,\" says Peeta. \"For killing that little girl.\"\\n\\n \"This is dreadful.\" Effie sounds like she\u0027s about to cry. \"That sort of thinking ... it\u0027s forbidden, Peeta. Absolutely. You\u0027ll only bring down more trouble on yourself and Katniss.\"\\n\\n \"I have to agree with Effie on this one,\" says Haymitch. Portia and Cinna remain silent, but their faces are very serious. Of course, they\u0027re right. But even though it worries me, I think what he did was amazing.\\n\\n \"I guess this is a bad time to mention I hung a dummy and painted Seneca Crane\u0027s name on it,\" I say. This has the desired effect. After a moment of disbelief, all the disapproval in the room hits me like a ton of bricks.\\n\\n \"You ... hung ... Seneca Crane?\" says Cinna.\\n\\n \"Yes. I was showing off my new knot-tying skills, and he somehow ended up at the end of the noose,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Oh, Katniss,\" says Effie in a hushed voice. \"How do you even know about that?\"\\n\\n \"Is it a secret? President Snow didn\u0027t act like it was. In fact, he seemed eager for me to know,\" I say. Effie leaves the table with her napkin pressed to her face. \"Now I\u0027ve upset Effie. I should have lied and said I shot some arrows.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have thought we planned it,\" says Peeta, giving me just the hint of a smile.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you?\" asks Portia. Her fingers press her eyelids closed as if she\u0027s warding off a very bright light.\\n\\n \"No,\" I say, looking at Peeta with a new sense of appreciation. \"Neither of us even knew what we were going to do before we went in.\"\\n\\n \"And, Haymitch?\" says Peeta. \"We decided we don\u0027t want any other allies in the arena.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Then I won\u0027t be responsible for you killing off any of my friends with your stupidity,\" he says.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what we were thinking,\" I tell him.\\n\\n We finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room, Cinna puts his arm around me and gives me a squeeze. \"Come on and let\u0027s go get those training scores.\"\\n\\n We gather around the television set and a red-eyed Effie rejoins us. The tributes\u0027 faces come up, district by district, and their scores flash under their pictures. One through twelve. Predictably high scores for Cashmere, Gloss, Brutus, Enobaria, and Finnick. Low to medium for the rest.\\n\\n \"Have they ever given a zero?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No, but there\u0027s a first time for everything,\" Cinna answers.\\n\\n And it turns out he\u0027s right. Because when Peeta and I each pull a twelve, we make Hunger Games history. No one feels like celebrating, though.\\n\\n \"Why did they do that?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"So that the others will have no choice but to target you,\" says Haymitch flatly. \"Go to bed. I can\u0027t stand to look at either one of you.\"\\n\\n Peeta walks me down to my room in silence, but before he can say good night, I wrap my arms around him and rest my head against his chest. His hands slide up my back and his cheek leans against my hair. \"I\u0027m sorry if I made things worse,\" I say.\\n\\n \"No worse than I did. Why did you do it, anyway?\" he says.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. To show them that I\u0027m more than just a piece in their Games?\" I say.\\n\\n He laughs a little, no doubt remembering the night before the Games last year. We were on the roof, neither of us able to sleep. Peeta had said something of the sort then, but I hadn\u0027t understood what he meant. Now I do.\\n\\n \"Me, too,\" he tells me. \"And I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m not going to try. To get you home, I mean. But if I\u0027m perfectly honest about it ...\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re perfectly honest about it, you think President Snow has probably given them direct orders to make sure we die in the arena anyway,\" I say.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s crossed my mind,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n It\u0027s crossed my mind, too. Repeatedly. But while I know I\u0027ll never leave that arena alive, I\u0027m still holding on to the hope that Peeta will. After all, he didn\u0027t pull out those berries, I did. No one has ever doubted that Peeta\u0027s defiance was motivated by love. So maybe President Snow will prefer keeping him alive, crushed and heartbroken, as a living warning to others.\\n\\n \"But even if that happens, everyone will know we\u0027ve gone out fighting, right?\" Peeta asks.\\n\\n \"Everyone will,\" I reply. And for the first time, I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I remember the old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumored uprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow\u0027s dominance. They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I can make it clear that I\u0027m still defying the Capitol right up to the end, the Capitol will have killed me ... but not my spirit. What better way to give hope to the rebels?\\n\\n The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitol\u0027s rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one. And if I really could save Peeta ... in terms of a revolution, this would be ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be more valuable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people.\\n\\n Peeta would lose it if he knew I was thinking any of this, so I only say, \"So what should we do with our last few days?\"\\n\\n \"I just want to spend every possible minute of the rest of my life with you,\" Peeta replies.\\n\\n \"Come on, then,\" I say, pulling him into my room.\\n\\n It feels like such a luxury, sleeping with Peeta again. I didn\u0027t realize until now how starved I\u0027ve been for human closeness. For the feel of him beside me in the darkness. I wish I hadn\u0027t wasted the last couple of nights shutting him out. I sink down into sleep, enveloped in his warmth, and when I open my eyes again, daylight\u0027s streaming through the windows.\\n\\n \"No nightmares,\" he says.\\n\\n \"No nightmares,\" I confirm. \"You?\"\\n\\n \"None. I\u0027d forgotten what a real night\u0027s sleep feels like,\" he says.\\n\\n We lie there for a while, in no rush to begin the day. Tomorrow night will be the televised interview, so today Effie and Haymitch should be coaching us. More high heels and sarcastic comments, I think. But then the redheaded Avox girl comes in with a note from Effie saying that, given our recent tour, both she and Haymitch have agreed we can handle ourselves adequately in public. The coaching sessions have been canceled.\\n\\n \"Really?\" says Peeta, taking the note from my hand and examining it. \"Do you know what this means? We\u0027ll have the whole day to ourselves.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too bad we can\u0027t go somewhere,\" I say wistfully.\\n\\n \"Who says we can\u0027t?\" he asks.\\n\\n The roof. We order a bunch of food, grab some blankets, and head up to the roof for a picnic. A daylong picnic in the flower garden that tinkles with wind chimes. We eat. We lie in the sun. I snap off hanging vines and use my newfound knowledge from training to practice knots and weave nets. Peeta sketches me. We make up a game with the force field that surrounds the roof - one of us throws an apple into it and the other person has to catch it.\\n\\n No one bothers us. By late afternoon, I lie with my head on Peeta\u0027s lap, making a crown of flowers while he fiddles with my hair, claiming he\u0027s practicing his knots. After a while, his hands go still. \"What?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever,\" he says.\\n\\n Usually this sort of comment, the kind that hints of his undying love for me, makes me feel guilty and awful. But I feel so warm and relaxed and beyond worrying about a future I\u0027ll never have, I just let the word slip out. \"Okay.\"\\n\\n I can hear the smile in his voice. \"Then you\u0027ll allow it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll allow it,\" I say.\\n\\n His fingers go back to my hair and I doze off, but he rouses me to see the sunset. It\u0027s a spectacular yellow and orange blaze behind the skyline of the Capitol. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d want to miss it,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I say. Because I can count on my fingers the number of sunsets I have left, and I don\u0027t want to miss any of them.\\n\\n We don\u0027t go and join the others for dinner, and no one summons us.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad. I\u0027m tired of making everyone around me so miserable,\" says Peeta. \"Everybody crying. Or Haymitch ...\" He doesn\u0027t need to go on.\\n\\n We stay on the roof until bedtime and then quietly slip down to my room without encountering anyone.\\n\\n The next morning, we\u0027re roused by my prep team. The sight of Peeta and me sleeping together is too much for Octavia, because she bursts into tears right away. \"You remember what Cinna told us,\" Venia says fiercely. Octavia nods and goes out sobbing.\\n\\n Peeta has to return to his room for prep, and I\u0027m left alone with Venia and Flavius. The usual chatter has been suspended. In fact, there\u0027s little talk at all, other than to have me raise my chin or comment on a makeup technique. It\u0027s nearly lunch when I feel something dripping on my shoulder and turn to find Flavius, who\u0027s snipping away at my hair with silent tears running down his face. Venia gives him a look, and he gently sets the scissors on the table and leaves.\\n\\n Then it\u0027s just Venia, whose skin is so pale her tattoos appear to be leaping off it. Almost rigid with determination, she does my hair and nails and makeup, fingers flying swiftly to compensate for her absent teammates. The whole time, she avoids my gaze. It\u0027s only when Cinna shows up to approve me and dismiss her that she takes my hands, looks me straight in the eye, and says, \"We would all like you to know what a ... privilege it has been to make you look your best.\" Then she hastens from the room.\\n\\n My prep team. My foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers and parties, nearly break my heart with their good-bye. It\u0027s certain from Venia\u0027s last words that we all know I won\u0027t be returning. Does the whole world know it? I wonder. I look at Cinna. He knows, certainly. But as he promised, there\u0027s no danger of tears from him.\\n\\n \"So, what am I wearing tonight?\" I ask, eyeing the garment bag that holds my dress.\\n\\n \"President Snow put in the dress order himself,\" says Cinna. He unzips the bag, revealing one of the wedding dresses I wore for the photo shoot. Heavy white silk with a low neckline and tight waist and sleeves that fall from my wrists to the floor. And pearls. Everywhere pearls. Stitched into the dress and in ropes at my throat and forming the crown for the veil. \"Even though they announced the Quarter Quell the night of the photo shoot, people Still voted for their favorite dress, and this was the winner. The president says you\u0027re to wear it tonight. Our objections were ignored.\"\\n\\n I rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out President Snow\u0027s reasoning. I suppose since I was the greatest offender, my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight. This, he thinks, will make that clear. It\u0027s so barbaric, the president turning my bridal gown into my shroud, that the blow strikes home, leaving me with a dull ache inside. \"Well, it\u0027d be a shame to waste such a pretty dress\" is all I say.\\n\\n Cinna helps me carefully into the gown. As it settles on my shoulders, they can\u0027t help giving a shrug of complaint. \"Was it always this heavy?\" I ask. I remember several of the dresses being dense, but this one feels like it weighs a ton.\\n\\n \"I had to make some slight alterations because of the lighting,\" says Cinna. I nod, but I can\u0027t see what that has to do with anything. He decks me out in the shoes and the pearl jewelry and the veil. Touches up my makeup. Has me walk.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re ravishing,\" he says. \"Now, Katniss, because this bodice is so fitted, I don\u0027t want you raising your arms above your head. Well, not until you twirl, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Will I be twirling again?\" I ask, thinking of my dress last year.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Caesar will ask you. And if he doesn\u0027t, you suggest it yourself. Only not right away. Save it for your big finale,\" Cinna instructs me.\\n\\n \"You give me a signal so I know when,\" I say.\\n\\n \"All right. Any plans for your interview? I know Haymitch left you two to your own devices,\" he says.\\n\\n \"No, this year I\u0027m just winging it. The funny thing is, I\u0027m not nervous at all.\" And I\u0027m not. However much President Snow may hate me, this Capitol audience is mine.\\n\\n We meet up with Effie, Haymitch, Portia, and Peeta at the elevator. Peeta\u0027s in an elegant tuxedo and white gloves. The sort of thing grooms wear to get married in, here in the Capitol.\\n\\n Back home everything is so much simpler. A woman usually rents a white dress that\u0027s been worn hundreds of times. The man wears something clean that\u0027s not mining clothes. They fill out some forms at the Justice Building and are assigned a house. Family and friends gather for a meal or bit of cake, if it can be afforded. Even if it can\u0027t, there\u0027s always a traditional song we sing as the new couple crosses the threshold of their home. And we have our own little ceremony, where they make their first fire, toast a bit of bread, and share it. Maybe it\u0027s old-fashioned, but no one really feels married in District 12 until after the toasting.\\n\\n The other tributes have already gathered offstage and are talking softly, but when Peeta and I arrive, they fall silent. I realize everyone\u0027s staring daggers at my wedding dress. Are they jealous of its beauty? The power it might have to manipulate the crowd?\\n\\n Finally Finnick says, \"I can\u0027t believe Cinna put you in that thing.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t have any choice. President Snow made him,\" I say, somewhat defensively. I won\u0027t let anyone criticize Cinna.\\n\\n Cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out, \"Well, you look ridiculous!\" She grabs her brother\u0027s hand and pulls him into place to lead our procession onto the stage. The other tributes begin to line up as well. I\u0027m confused because, while they all are angry, some are giving us sympathetic pats on the shoulder, and Johanna Mason actually stops to straighten my pearl necklace.\\n\\n \"Make him pay for it, okay?\" she says.\\n\\n I nod, but I don\u0027t know what she means. Not until we\u0027re all sitting out onstage and Caesar Flickerman, hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their interviews. This is the first time I realize the depth of betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that accompanies it. But they are so smart, so wonderfully smart about how they play it, because it all comes back to reflect on the government and President Snow in particular. Not everyone. There are the old throwbacks, like Brutus and Enobaria, who are just here for another Games, and those too baffled or drugged or lost to join in on the attack. But there are enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve to come out fighting.\\n\\n Cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about how she just can\u0027t stop crying when she thinks of how much the people in the Capitol must be suffering because they will lose us. Gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister. Beetee questions the legality of the Quell in his nervous, twitchy way, wondering if it\u0027s been fully examined by experts of late. Finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the Capitol, and about a hundred people faint because they\u0027re sure he means them. By the time Johanna Mason gets up, she\u0027s asking if something can\u0027t be done about the situation. Surely the creators of the Quarter Quell never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the Capitol. No one could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. Seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in District 11, everyone assumes President Snow is all-powerful. So if he\u0027s all-powerful, why doesn\u0027t he change the Quell? And Chaff, who comes right on her heels, insists the president could change the Quell if he wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to anyone.\\n\\n By the time I\u0027m introduced, the audience is an absolute wreck. People have been weeping and collapsing and even calling for change. The sight of me in my white silk bridal gown practically causes a riot. No more me, no more star-crossed lovers living happily ever after, no more wedding. I can see even Caesar\u0027s professionalism showing some cracks as he tries to quiet them so I can speak, but my three minutes are ticking quickly away.\\n\\n Finally there\u0027s a lull and he gets out, \"So, Katniss, obviously this is a very emotional night for everyone. Is there anything you\u0027d like to say?\"\\n\\n My voice trembles as I speak. \"Only that I\u0027m so sorry you won\u0027t get to be at my wedding ... but I\u0027m glad you at least get to see me in my dress. Isn\u0027t it just ... the most beautiful thing?\" I don\u0027t have to look at Cinna for a signal. I know this is the right time. I begin to twirl slowly, raising the sleeves of my heavy gown above my head.\\n\\n When I hear the screams of the crowd, I think it\u0027s because I must look stunning. Then I notice something is rising up around me. Smoke. From fire. Not the flickery stuff I wore last year in the chariot, but something much more real that devours my dress. I begin to panic as the smoke thickens. Charred bits of black silk swirl into the air, and pearls clatter to the stage. Somehow I\u0027m afraid to stop because my flesh doesn\u0027t seem to be burning and I know Cinna must be behind whatever is happening. So I keep spinning and spinning. For a split second I\u0027m gasping, completely engulfed in the strange flames. Then all at once, the fire is gone. I slowly come to a stop, wondering if I\u0027m naked and why Cinna has arranged to burn away my wedding dress.\\n\\n But I\u0027m not naked. I\u0027m in a dress of the exact design of my wedding dress, only it\u0027s the color of coal and made of tiny feathers. Wonderingly, I lift my long, flowing sleeves into the air, and that\u0027s when I see myself on the television screen. Clothed in black except for the white patches on my sleeves. Or should I say my wings.\\n\\n Because Cinna has turned me into a mockingjay. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/catching-fire-the-hunger-games-2/page-17.html","bookId":1686,"book":{"id":1686,"title":"Catching Fire (The Hunger Games #2)","description":"Storyline: Catching Fire (The Hunger Games #2) \\n Sparks are igniting. \\n Flames are spreading. \\n And the Capitol wants revenge. \\n Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.
