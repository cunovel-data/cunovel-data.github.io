{"id":63913,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"16. Haymitch grips my wrist as if anticipating my next move, but I am as speechless as the Capitol\u0027s torturers have rendered Darius. Haymitch once told me they did something to Avoxes\u0027 tongues so they could never talk again. In my head I hear Darius\u0027s voice, playful and bright, ringing across the Hob to tease me. Not as my fellow victors make fun of me now, but because we genuinely liked each other. If Gale could see him ... I know any move I would make toward Darius, any act of recognition, would only result in punishment for him. So we just stare into each other\u0027s eyes. Darius, now a mute slave; me, now headed to death. What would we say, anyway? That we\u0027re sorry for the other\u0027s lot? That we ache for the other\u0027s pain? That we\u0027re glad we had the chance to know each other? No, Darius shouldn\u0027t be glad he knew me. If I had been there to stop Thread, he wouldn\u0027t have stepped forward to save Gale. Wouldn\u0027t be an Avox. And more specifically, wouldn\u0027t be my Avox, because President Snow has so obviously had him placed here for my benefit. I twist my wrist from Haymitch\u0027s grasp and head down to my old bedroom, locking the door behind me. I sit on the side of my bed, elbows on my knees, forehead on my fists, and watch my glowing suit in the darkness, imagining I am in my old home in District 12, huddled beside the fire. It slowly fades back to black as the power pack dies out. When Effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner, I get up and take off my suit, fold it neatly, and set it on the table with my crown. In the bathroom, I wash the dark streaks of makeup from my face. I dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to the dining room. I\u0027m not aware of much at dinner except that Darius and the redheaded Avox girl are our servers. Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, Portia, and Peeta are all there, talking about the opening ceremonies, I suppose. But the only time I really feel present is when I purposely knock a dish of peas to the floor and, before anyone can stop me, crouch down to clean them up. Darius is right by me when I send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured from view, as we scoop up the peas. For just one moment our hands meet. I can feel his skin, rough under the buttery sauce from the dish. In the tight, desperate clench of our fingers are all the words we will never be able to say. Then Effie\u0027s clucking at me from behind about how \"That isn\u0027t your job, Katniss!\" and he lets go. When we go in to watch the recap of the opening ceremonies, I wedge myself in between Cinna and Haymitch on the couch because I don\u0027t want to be next to Peeta. This awfulness with Darius belongs to me and Gale and maybe even Haymitch, but not to Peeta. He might\u0027ve known Darius to nod hello, but Peeta wasn\u0027t Hob the way the rest of us were. Besides, I\u0027m still angry with him for laughing at me along with the other victors, and the last thing I want is his sympathy and comfort. I haven\u0027t changed my mind about saving him in the arena, but I don\u0027t owe him more than that. As I watch the procession to the City Circle, I think how it\u0027s bad enough that they dress us all up in costumes and parade us through the streets in chariots on a regular year. Kids in costumes are silly, but aging victors, it turns out, are pitiful. A few who are on the younger side, like Johanna and Finnick, or whose bodies haven\u0027t fallen into disrepair, like Seeder and Brutus, can still manage to maintain a little dignity. But the majority, who are in the clutches of drink or morphling or illness, look grotesque in their costumes, depicting cows and trees and loaves of bread. Last year we chattered away about each contestant, but tonight there\u0027s only the occasional comment. Small wonder the crowd goes wild when Peeta and I appear, looking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes. The very image of what tributes should be. As soon as it\u0027s over, I stand up and thank Cinna and Portia for their amazing work and head off to bed. Effie calls a reminder to meet early for breakfast to work out our training strategy, but even her voice sounds hollow. Poor Effie. She finally had a decent year in the Games with Peeta and me, and now it\u0027s all broken down into a mess that even she can\u0027t put a positive spin on. In Capitol terms, I\u0027m guessing this counts as a true tragedy. Soon after I go to bed, there\u0027s a quiet knock on my door, but I ignore it. I don\u0027t want Peeta tonight. Especially not with Darius around. It\u0027s almost as bad as if Gale were here. Gale. How am I supposed to let him go with Darius haunting the hallways? Tongues figure prominently in my nightmares. First I watch frozen and helpless while gloved hands carry out the bloody dissection in Darius\u0027s mouth. Then I\u0027m at a party where everyone wears masks and someone with a flicking, wet tongue, who I suppose is Finnick, stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off his mask, it\u0027s President Snow, and his puffy lips are dripping in bloody saliva. Finally I\u0027m back in the arena, my own tongue as dry as sandpaper, while I try to reach a pool of water that recedes every time I\u0027m about to touch it. When I wake, I stumble to the bathroom and gulp water from the faucet until I can hold no more. I strip off my sweaty clothes and fall back into bed, naked, and somehow find sleep again. I delay going down to breakfast as long as possible the next morning because I really don\u0027t want to discuss our training strategy. What\u0027s to discuss? Every victor already knows what everybody else can do. Or used to be able to do, anyway. So Peeta and I will continue to act in love and that\u0027s that. Somehow I\u0027m just not up to talking about it, especially with Darius standing mutely by. I take a long shower, dress slowly in the outfit Cinna has left for training, and order food from the menu in my room by speaking into a mouthpiece. In a minute, sausage, eggs, potatoes, bread, juice, and hot chocolate appear. I eat my fill, trying to drag out the minutes until ten o\u0027clock, when we have to go down to the Training Center. By nine-thirty, Haymitch is pounding on my door, obviously fed up with me, ordering me to the dining room NOW! Still, I brush my teeth before meandering down the hall, effectively killing another five minutes. The dining room\u0027s empty except for Peeta and Haymitch, whose face is flushed with drink and anger. On his wrist he wears a solid-gold bangle with a pattern of flames - this must be his concession to Effie\u0027s matching-token plan - that he twists unhappily. It\u0027s a very handsome bangle, really, but the movement makes it seem like something confining, a shackle, rather than a piece of jewelry. \"You\u0027re late,\" he snarls at me. \"Sorry. I slept in after the mutilated-tongue nightmares kept me up half the night.\" I mean to sound hostile, but my voice catches at the end of the sentence. Haymitch gives me a scowl, then relents. \"All right, never mind. Today, in training, you\u0027ve got two jobs. One, stay in love.\" \"Obviously,\" I say. \"And two, make some friends,\" says Haymitch. \"No,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t trust any of them, I can\u0027t stand most of them, and I\u0027d rather operate with just the two of us.\" \"That\u0027s what I said at first, but - \" Peeta begins. \"But it won\u0027t be enough,\" Haymitch insists. \"You\u0027re going to need more allies this time around.\" \"Why?\" I ask. \"Because you\u0027re at a distinct disadvantage. Your competitors have known each other for years. So who do you think they\u0027re going to target first?\" he says. \"Us. And nothing we\u0027re going to do is going to override any old friendship,\" I say. \"So why bother?\" \"Because you can fight. You\u0027re popular with the crowd. That could still make you desirable allies. But only if you let the others know you\u0027re willing to team up with them,\" says Haymitch. \"You mean you want us in the Career pack this year?\" I ask, unable to hide my distaste. Traditionally the tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 join forces, possibly taking in a few other exceptional fighters, and hunt down the weaker competitors. \"That\u0027s been our strategy, hasn\u0027t it? To train like Careers?\" counters Haymitch. \"And who makes up the Career pack is generally agreed upon before the Games begin. Peeta barely got in with them last year.\" I think of the loathing I felt when I discovered Peeta was with the Careers during the last Games. \"So we\u0027re to try to get in with Finnick and Brutus - is that what you\u0027re saying?\" \"Not necessarily. Everyone\u0027s a victor. Make your own pack if you\u0027d rather. Choose who you like. I\u0027d suggest Chaff and Seeder. Although Finnick\u0027s not to be ignored,\" says Haymitch. \"Find someone to team up with who might be of some use to you. Remember, you\u0027re not in a ring full of trembling children anymore. These people are all experienced killers, no matter what shape they appear to be in.\" Maybe he\u0027s right. Only who could I trust? Seeder maybe. But do I really want to make a pact with her, only to possibly have to kill her later? No. Still, I made a pact with Rue under the same circumstances. I tell Haymitch I\u0027ll try, even though I think I\u0027ll be pretty bad at the whole thing. Effie shows up a bit early to take us down because last year, even though we were on time, we were the last two tributes to show up. But Haymitch tells her he doesn\u0027t want her taking us down to the gym. None of the other victors will be showing up with a babysitter, and being the youngest, it\u0027s even more important we look self-reliant. So she has to satisfy herself with taking us to the elevator, fussing over our hair, and pushing the button for us. It\u0027s such a short ride that there\u0027s no real time for conversation, but when Peeta takes my hand, I don\u0027t pull it away. I may have ignored him last night in private, but in training we must appear as an inseparable team. Effie needn\u0027t have worried about us being the last to arrive. Only Brutus and the woman from District 2, Enobaria, are present. Enobaria looks to be about thirty and all I can remember about her is that, in hand-to-hand combat, she killed one tribute by ripping open his throat with her teeth. She became so famous for this act that, after she was a victor, she had her teeth cosmetically altered so each one ends in a sharp point like a fang and is inlaid with gold. She has no shortage of admirers in the Capitol. By ten o\u0027clock, only about half of the tributes have shown up. Atala, the woman who runs training, begins her spiel right on time, unfazed by the poor attendance. Maybe she expected it. I\u0027m sort of relieved, because that means there are a dozen people I don\u0027t have to pretend to make friends with. Atala runs through the list of stations, which include both combat and survival skills, and releases us to train. I tell Peeta I think we\u0027d do best to split up, thus covering more territory. When he goes off to chuck spears with Brutus and Chaff, I head over to the knot-tying station, hardly anyone ever bothers to visit it. I like the trainer and he remembers me fondly, maybe because I spent time with him last year. He\u0027s pleased when I show him I can still set the trap that leaves an enemy dangling by a leg from a tree. Clearly he took note of my snares in the arena last year and now sees me as an advanced pupil, so I ask him to review every kind of knot that might come in handy and a few that I\u0027ll probably never use. I\u0027d be content to spend the morning alone with him, but after about an hour and a half, someone puts his arms around me from behind, his fingers easily finishing the complicated knot I\u0027ve been sweating over. Of course it\u0027s Finnick, who seems to have spent his childhood doing nothing but wielding tridents and manipulating ropes into fancy knots for nets, I guess. I watch for a minute while he picks up a length of rope, makes a noose, and then pretends to hang himself for my amusement. Rolling my eyes, I head over to another vacant station where tributes can learn to build fires. I already make excellent fires, but I\u0027m still pretty dependent on matches for starting them. So the trainer has me work with flint, steel, and some charred cloth. This is much harder than it looks, and even working as intently as I can, it takes me about an hour to get a fire going. I look up with a triumphant smile only to find I have company. The two tributes from District 3 are beside me, struggling to start a decent fire with matches. I think about leaving, but I really want to try using the flint again, and if I have to report back to Haymitch that I tried to make friends, these two might be a bearable choice. Both are small in stature with ashen skin and black hair. The woman, Wiress, is probably around my mother\u0027s age and speaks in a quiet, intelligent voice. But right away I notice she has a habit of dropping off her words in mid-sentence, as if she\u0027s forgotten you\u0027re there. Beetee, the man, is older and somewhat fidgety. He wears glasses but spends a lot of time looking under them. They\u0027re a little strange, but I\u0027m pretty sure neither of them is going to try to make me uncomfortable by stripping naked. And they\u0027re from District 3. Maybe they can even confirm my suspicions of an uprising there. I glance around the Training Center. Peeta is at the center of a ribald circle of knife throwers. The morphlings from District 6 are in the camouflage station, painting each other\u0027s faces with bright pink swirls. The male tribute from District 5 is vomiting wine on the sword-fighting floor. Finnick and the old woman from his district are using the archery station. Johanna Mason is naked again and oiling her skin down for a wrestling lesson. I decide to stay put. Wiress and Beetee make decent company. They seem friendly enough but don\u0027t pry. We talk about our talents; they tell me they both invent things, which makes my supposed interest in fashion seem pretty weak. Wiress brings up some sort of stitching device she\u0027s working on. \"It senses the density of the fabric and selects the strength,\" she says, and then becomes absorbed in a bit of dry straw before she can go on. \"The strength of the thread,\" Beetee finishes explaining. \"Automatically. It rules out human error.\" Then he talks about his recent success creating a musical chip that\u0027s tiny enough to be concealed in a flake of glitter but can hold hours of songs. I remember Octavia talking about this during the wedding shoot, and I see a possible chance to allude to the uprising. \"Oh, yeah. My prep team was all upset a few months ago, I think, because they couldn\u0027t get hold of that,\" I say casually. \"I guess a lot of orders from District Three were getting backed up.\" Beetee examines me under his glasses. \"Yes. Did you have any similar backups in coal production, this year?\" he asks. \"No. Well, we lost a couple of weeks when they brought in a new Head Peacekeeper and his crew, but nothing major,\" I say. \"To production, I mean. Two weeks sitting around your house doing nothing just means two weeks of being hungry for most people.\" I think they understand what I\u0027m trying to say. That we\u0027ve had no uprising. \"Oh. That\u0027s a shame,\" says Wiress in a slightly disappointed voice. \"I found your district very ...\" She trails off, distracted by something in her head. \"Interesting,\" fills in Beetee. \"We both did.\" I feel bad, knowing that their district must have suffered much worse than ours. I feel I have to defend my people. \"Well, there aren\u0027t very many of us in Twelve,\" I say. \"Not that you\u0027d know it nowadays by the size of the Peacekeeping force. But I guess we\u0027re interesting enough.\" As we move over to the shelter station, Wiress stops and gazes up at the stands where the Gamemakers are roaming around, eating and drinking, sometimes taking notice of us. \"Look,\" she says, giving her head a slight nod in their direction. I look up and see Plutarch Heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe with the fur-trimmed collar that designates him as Head Gamemaker. He\u0027s eating a turkey leg. I don\u0027t see why this merits comment, but I say, \"Yes, he\u0027s been promoted to Head Gamemaker this year.\" \"No, no. There by the corner of the table. You can just ...\" says Wiress. Beetee squints under his glasses. \"Just make it out.\" I stare in that direction, perplexed. But then I see it. A patch of space about six inches square at the corner of the table seems almost to be vibrating. It\u0027s as if the air is rippling in tiny visible waves, distorting the sharp edges of the wood and a goblet of wine someone has set there. \"A force field. They\u0027ve set one up between the Game-makers and us. I wonder what brought that on,\" Beetee says. \"Me, probably,\" I confess. \"Last year I shot an arrow at them during my private training session.\" Beetee and Wiress look at me curiously. \"I was provoked. So, do all force fields have a spot like that?\" \"Chink,\" says Wiress vaguely. \"In the armor, as it were,\" finishes Beetee. \"Ideally it\u0027d be invisible, wouldn\u0027t it?\" I want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. I look for Peeta, but he\u0027s hanging with a group of about ten other victors, so I decide just to eat with District 3. Maybe I can get Seeder to join us. When we make our way into the dining area, I see some of Peeta\u0027s gang have other ideas. They\u0027re dragging all the smaller tables to form one large table so that we all have to eat together. Now I don\u0027t know what to do. Even at school I used to avoid eating at a crowded table. Frankly, I\u0027d probably have sat alone if Madge hadn\u0027t made a habit of joining me. I guess I\u0027d have eaten with Gale except, being two grades apart, our lunch never fell at the same time. I take a tray and start making my way around the food-laden carts that ring the room. Peeta catches up with me at the stew. \"How\u0027s it going?\" \"Good. Fine. I like the District Three victors,\" I say. \"Wiress and Beetee.\" \"Really?\" he asks. \"They\u0027re something of a joke to the others.\" \"Why does that not surprise me?\" I say. I think of how Peeta was always surrounded at school by a crowd of friends. It\u0027s amazing, really, that he ever took any notice of me except to think I was odd. \"Johanna\u0027s nicknamed them Nuts and Volts,\" he says. \"I think she\u0027s Nuts and he\u0027s Volts.\" \"And so I\u0027m stupid for thinking they might be useful. Because of something Johanna Mason said while she was oiling up her breasts for wrestling,\" I retort. \"Actually I think the nickname\u0027s been around for years. And I didn\u0027t mean that as an insult. I\u0027m just sharing information,\" he says. \"Well, Wiress and Beetee are smart. They invent things. They could tell by sight that a force field had been put up between us and the Gamemakers. And if we have to have allies, I want them.\" I toss the ladle back in a pot of stew, splattering us both with the gravy. \"What are you so angry about?\" Peeta asks, wiping the gravy from his shirtfront. \"Because I teased you on the elevator? I\u0027m sorry. I thought you would just laugh about it.\" \"Forget it,\" I say with a shake of my head. \"It\u0027s a lot of things.\" \"Darius,\" he says. \"Darius. The Games. Haymitch making us team up with the others,\" I say. \"It can just be you and me, you know,\" he says. \"I know. But maybe Haymitch is right,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t tell him I said so, but he usually is, where the Games are concerned.\" \"Well, you can have final say about our allies. But right now, I\u0027m leaning toward Chaff and Seeder,\" says Peeta. \"I\u0027m okay with Seeder, not Chaff,\" I say. \"Not yet, anyway.\" \"Come on and eat with him. I promise, I won\u0027t let him kiss you again,\" says Peeta. Chaff doesn\u0027t seem as bad at lunch. He\u0027s sober, and while he talks too loud and makes bad jokes a lot, most of them are at his own expense. I can see why he would be good for Haymitch, whose thoughts run so darkly. But I\u0027m still not sure I\u0027m ready to team up with him. I try hard to be more sociable, not just with Chaff but with the group at large. After lunch I do the edible-insect station with the District 8 tributes - Cecelia, who\u0027s got three kids at home, and Woof, a really old guy who\u0027s hard of hearing and doesn\u0027t seem to know what\u0027s going on since he keeps trying to stuff poisonous bugs in his mouth. I wish I could mention meeting Twill and Bonnie in the woods, but I can\u0027t figure out how. Cashmere and Gloss, the sister and brother from District 1, invite me over and we make hammocks for a while. They\u0027re polite but cool, and I spend the whole time thinking about how I killed both the tributes from their district, Glimmer and Marvel, last year, and that they probably knew them and might even have been their mentors. Both my hammock and my attempt to connect with them are mediocre at best. I join Enobaria at sword training and exchange a few comments, but it\u0027s clear neither of us wants to team up. Finnick appears again when I\u0027m picking up fishing tips, but mostly just to introduce me to Mags, the elderly woman who\u0027s also from District 4. Between her district accent and her garbled speech - possibly she\u0027s had a stroke - I can\u0027t make out more than one in four words. But I swear she can make a decent fishhook out of anything - a thorn, a wishbone, an earring. After a while I tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does. When I make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair, she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might be praise. Suddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young, hysterical woman in her district. It couldn\u0027t be because she thought she had any chance of winning. She did it to save the girl, just like I volunteered last year to save Prim. And I decide I want her on my team. Great. Now I have to go back and tell Haymitch I want an eighty-year-old and Nuts and Volts for my allies. He\u0027ll love that. So I give up trying to make friends and go over to the archery range for some sanity. It\u0027s wonderful there, getting to try out all the different bows and arrows. The trainer, Tax, seeing that the standing targets offer no challenge for me, begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit. At first it seems stupid, but it turns out to be kind of fun. Much more like hunting a moving creature. Since I\u0027m hitting everything he throws up, he starts increasing the number of birds he sends airborne. I forget the rest of the gym and the victors and how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting. When I manage to take down five birds in one round, I realize it\u0027s so quiet I can hear each one hit the floor. I turn and see the majority of the victors have stopped to watch me. Their faces show everything from envy to hatred to admiration. After training, Peeta and I hang out, waiting for Haymitch and Effie to show up for dinner. When we\u0027re called to eat, Haymitch pounces on me immediately. \"So at least half the victors have instructed their mentors to request you as an ally. I know it can\u0027t be your sunny personality.\" \"They saw her shoot,\" says Peeta with a smile. \"Actually, I saw her shoot, for real, for the first time. I\u0027m about to put in a formal request myself.\" \"You\u0027re that good?\" Haymitch asks me. \"So good that Brutus wants you?\" I shrug. \"But I don\u0027t want Brutus. I want Mags and District Three.\" \"Of course you do.\" Haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. \"I\u0027ll tell everybody you\u0027re still making up your mind.\" After my shooting exhibition, I still get teased some, but I no longer feel like I\u0027m being mocked. In fact, I feel as if I\u0027ve somehow been initiated into the victors\u0027 circle. During the next two days, I spend time with almost everybody headed for the arena. Even the morphlings, who, with Peeta\u0027s help, paint me into a field of yellow flowers. Even Finnick, who gives me an hour of trident lessons in exchange for an hour of archery instruction. And the more I come to know these people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don\u0027t hate them. And some I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would be to protect them. But all of them must die if I\u0027m to save Peeta. The final day of training ends with our private sessions. We each get fifteen minutes before the Gamemakers to amaze them with our skills, but I don\u0027t know what any of us might have to show them. There\u0027s a lot of kidding about it at lunch. What we might do. Sing, dance, strip, tell jokes. Mags, who I can understand a little better now, decides she\u0027s just going to take a nap. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do. Shoot some arrows, I guess. Haymitch said to surprise them if we could, but I\u0027m fresh out of ideas. As the girl from 12, I\u0027m scheduled to go last. The dining room gets quieter and quieter as the tributes file out to go perform. It\u0027s easier to keep up the irreverent, invincible manner we\u0027ve all adopted when there are more of us. As people disappear through the door, all I can think is that they have a matter of days to live. Peeta and I are finally left alone. He reaches across the table to take my hands. \"Decided what to do for the Gamemakers yet?\" I shake my head. \"I can\u0027t really use them for target practice this year, with the force field up and all. Maybe make some fishhooks. What about you?\" \"Not a clue. I keep wishing I could bake a cake or something,\" he says. \"Do some more camouflage,\" I suggest. \"If the morphlings have left me anything to work with,\" he says wryly. \"They\u0027ve been glued to that station since training started.\" We sit in silence awhile and then I blurt out the thing that\u0027s on both our minds. \"How are we going to kill these people, Peeta?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He leans his forehead down on our entwined hands. \"I don\u0027t want them as allies. Why did Haymitch want us to get to know them?\" I say. \"It\u0027ll make it so much harder than last time. Except for Rue maybe. But I guess I never really could\u0027ve killed her, anyway. She was just too much like Prim.\" Peeta looks up at me, his brow creased in thought. \"Her death was the most despicable, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"None of them were very pretty,\" I say, thinking of Glimmer\u0027s and Cato\u0027s ends. They call Peeta, so I wait by myself. Fifteen minutes pass. Then half an hour. It\u0027s close to forty minutes before I\u0027m called. When I go in, I smell the sharp odor of cleaner and notice that one of the mats has been dragged to the center of the room. The mood is very different from last year\u0027s, when the Gamemakers were half drunk and distractedly picking at tidbits from the banquet table. They whisper among themselves, looking somewhat annoyed. What did Peeta do? Something to upset them? I feel a pang of worry. That isn\u0027t good. I don\u0027t want Peeta singling himself out as a target for the Gamemakers\u0027 anger. That\u0027s part of my job. To draw fire away from Peeta. But how did he upset them? Because I\u0027d love to do just that and more. To break through the smug veneer of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us. To make them realize that while we\u0027re vulnerable to the Capitol\u0027s cruelties, they are as well. Do you have any idea how much I hate you? I think. You, who have given your talents to the Games? I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbee\u0027s eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as he has the entire training period. I remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. His friendly manner has no place here. How could it, when I\u0027m a mere tribute and he\u0027s the Head Gamemaker? So powerful, so removed, so safe ... Suddenly I know just what I\u0027m going to do. Something that will blow anything Peeta did right out of the water. I go over to the knot-tying station and get a length of rope. I start to manipulate it, but it\u0027s hard because I\u0027ve never made this actual knot myself. I\u0027ve only watched Finnick\u0027s clever fingers, and they moved so fast. After about ten minutes, I\u0027ve come up with a respectable noose. I drag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and, using some chinning bars, hang it so it dangles by the neck. Tying its hands behind its back would be a nice touch, but I think I might be running out of time. I hurry over to the camouflage station, where some of the other tributes, undoubtedly the morphlings, have made a colossal mess. But I find a partial container of bloodred berry juice that will serve my needs. The flesh-colored fabric of the dummy\u0027s skin makes a good, absorbent canvas. I carefully finger paint the words on its body, concealing them from view. Then I step away quickly to watch the reaction on the Gamemakers\u0027 faces as they read the name on the dummy.

Flames are spreading. And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.

As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol\u0027s cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.
