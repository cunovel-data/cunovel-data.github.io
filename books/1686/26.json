Beetee\u0027s trap holds enough promise, though, that the Gamemakers haven\u0027t sent in other attacks. Perhaps they are simply curious to see if it will work.\\n\\n At what Finnick and I judge to be about nine, we leave our shell-strewn camp, cross to the twelve o\u0027clock beach, and begin to quietly hike up to the lightning tree in the light of the moon. Our full stomachs make us more uncomfortable and breathless than we were on the morning\u0027s climb. I begin to regret those last dozen oysters.\\n\\n Beetee asks Finnick to assist him, and the rest of us stand guard. Before he even attaches any wire to the tree, Beetee unrolls yards and yards of the stuff. He has Finnick secure it tightly around a broken branch and lay it on the ground. Then they stand on either side of the tree, passing the spool back and forth as they wrap the wire around and around the trunk. At first it seems arbitrary, then I see a pattern, like an intricate maze, appearing in the moonlight on Beetee\u0027s side. I wonder if it makes any difference how the wire\u0027s placed, or if this is merely to add to the speculation of the audience. I bet most of them know as much about electricity as I do.\\n\\n The work on the trunk\u0027s completed just as we hear the wave begin. I\u0027ve never really worked out at what point in the ten o\u0027clock hour it erupts. There must be some buildup, then the wave itself, then the aftermath of the flooding. But the sky tells me ten-thirty.\\n\\n This is when Beetee reveals the rest of the plan. Since we move most swiftly through the trees, he wants Johanna and me to take the coil down through the jungle, unwinding the wire as we go. We are to lay it across the twelve o\u0027clock beach and drop the metal spool, with whatever is left, deep into the water, making sure it sinks. Then run for the jungle. If we go now, right now, we should make it to safety.\\n\\n \"I want to go with them as a guard,\" Peeta says immediately. After the moment with the pearl, I know he\u0027s less willing than ever to let me out of his sight.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too slow. Besides, I\u0027ll need you on this end. Katniss will guard,\" says Beetee. \"There\u0027s no time to debate this. I\u0027m sorry. If the girls are to get out of there alive, they need to move now.\" He hands the coil to Johanna.\\n\\n I don\u0027t like the plan any more than Peeta does. How can I protect him at a distance? But Beetee\u0027s right. With his leg, Peeta is too slow to make it down the slope in time. Johanna and I are the fastest and most sure-footed on the jungle floor. I can\u0027t think of any alternative. And if I trust anyone here besides Peeta, it\u0027s Beetee.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I tell Peeta. \"We\u0027ll just drop the coil and come straight back up.\"\\n\\n \"Not into the lightning zone,\" Beetee reminds me. \"Head for the tree in the one-to-two-o\u0027clock sector. If you find you\u0027re running out of time, move over one more. Don\u0027t even think about going back on the beach, though, until I can assess the damage.\"\\n\\n I take Peeta\u0027s face in my hands. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll see you at midnight.\" I give him a kiss and, before he can object any further, I let go and turn to Johanna. \"Ready?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" says Johanna with a shrug. She\u0027s clearly no happier about being teamed up than I am. But we\u0027re all caught up in Beetee\u0027s trap. \"You guard, I\u0027ll unwind. We can trade off later.\"\\n\\n Without further discussion, we head down the slope. In fact there\u0027s very little discussion between us at all. We move at a pretty good clip, one manning the coil, the other keeping watch. About halfway down, we hear the clicking beginning to rise, indicating it\u0027s after eleven.\\n\\n \"Better hurry,\" Johanna says. \"I want to put a lot of distance between me and that water before the lightning hits. Just in case Volts miscalculated something.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take the coil for a while,\" I say. It\u0027s harder work laying out the wire than guarding, and she\u0027s had a long turn.\\n\\n \"Here,\" Johanna says, passing me the coil.\\n\\n Both of our hands are still on the metal cylinder when there\u0027s a slight vibration. Suddenly the thin golden wire from above springs down at us, bunching in tangled loops and curls around our wrists. Then the severed end snakes up to our feet.\\n\\n It only takes a second to register this rapid turn of events. Johanna and I look at each other, but neither of us has to say it. Someone not far above us has cut the wire. And they will be on us at any moment.\\n\\n My hand frees itself from the wire and has just closed on the feathers of an arrow when the metal cylinder smashes into the side of my head. The next thing I know, I\u0027m lying on my back in the vines, a terrible pain in my left temple. Something\u0027s wrong with my eyes. My vision blurs in and out of focus as I strain to make the two moons floating up in the sky into one. It\u0027s hard to breathe, and I realize Johanna\u0027s sitting on my chest, pinning me at the shoulders with her knees.\\n\\n There\u0027s a stab in my left forearm. I try to jerk away but I\u0027m still too incapacitated. Johanna\u0027s digging something, I guess the point of her knife, into my flesh, twisting it around. There\u0027s an excruciating ripping sensation and warmth runs down my wrist, filling my palm. She swipes down my arm and coats half my face with my blood.\\n\\n \"Stay down!\" she hisses. Her weight leaves my body and I\u0027m alone.\\n\\n Stay down? I think. What? What is happening? My eyes shut, blocking out the inconsistent world, as I try to make sense of my situation.\\n\\n All I can think of is Johanna shoving Wiress to the beach. \"Just stay down, will you?\" But she didn\u0027t attack Wiress. Not like this. I\u0027m not Wiress, anyway. I\u0027m not Nuts. \"Just stay down, will you?\" echoes around inside my brain.\\n\\n Footsteps coming. Two pairs. Heavy, not trying to conceal their whereabouts.\\n\\n Brutus\u0027s voice. \"She\u0027s good as dead! Come on, Enobaria!\" Feet moving into the night.\\n\\n Am I? I drift in and out of consciousness looking for an answer. Am I as good as dead? I\u0027m in no position to make an argument to the contrary. In fact, rational thinking is a struggle. This much I know. Johanna attacked me. Smashed that cylinder into my head. Cut my arm, probably doing irreparable damage to veins and arteries, and then Brutus and Enobaria showed up before she had time to finish me off.\\n\\n The alliance is over. Finnick and Johanna must have had an agreement to turn on us tonight. I knew we should have left this morning. I don\u0027t know where Beetee stands. But I\u0027m fair game, and so is Peeta.\\n\\n Peeta! My eyes fly open in panic. Peeta is waiting up by the tree, unsuspecting and off guard. Maybe Finnick has even killed him already. \"No,\" I whisper. That wire was cut from a short distance away by the Careers. Finnick and Beetee and Peeta - they can\u0027t know what\u0027s going on down here. They can only be wondering what has happened, why the wire has gone slack or maybe even sprung back to the tree. This, in itself, can\u0027t be a signal to kill, can it? Surely this was just Johanna deciding the time had come to break with us. Kill me. Escape from the Careers. Then bring Finnick into the fight as soon as possible.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know. I only know that I must get back to Peeta and keep him alive. It takes every ounce of will I have to push up into a sitting position and drag myself up the side of a tree to my feet. It\u0027s lucky I have something to hold on to because the jungle\u0027s tilting back and forth. Without any warning, I lean forward and vomit up the seafood feast, heaving until there can\u0027t possibly be an oyster left in my body. Trembling and slick with sweat, I assess my physical condition.\\n\\n As I lift up my damaged arm, blood sprays me in the face and the world makes another alarming shift. I squeeze my eyes shut and cling to the tree until things steady a little. Then I take a few careful steps to a neighboring tree, pull off some moss, and without examining the wound further, tightly bandage my arm. Better. Definitely better not to see it. Then I allow my hand to tentatively touch my head wound. There\u0027s a huge lump but not too much blood. Obviously I\u0027ve got some internal damage, but I don\u0027t seem in danger of bleeding to death. At least not through my head.\\n\\n I dry my hands on moss and get a shaky grip on my bow with my damaged left arm. Secure the notch of an arrow to the string. Make my feet move up the slope.\\n\\n Peeta. My dying wish. My promise. To keep him alive. My heart lifts a bit when I realize he must be alive because no cannon has fired. Maybe Johanna was acting alone, knowing Finnick would side with her once her intentions were clear. Although it\u0027s hard to guess what goes on between those two. I think of how he looked to her for confirmation before he\u0027d agree to help set Beetee\u0027s trap. There\u0027s a much deeper alliance based on years of friendship and who knows what else. Therefore, if Johanna has turned on me, I should no longer trust Finnick.\\n\\n I reach this conclusion only seconds before I hear someone running down the slope toward me. Neither Peeta nor Beetee could move at this pace. I duck behind a curtain of vines, concealing myself just in time. Finnick flies by me, his skin shadowy with medicine, leaping through the undergrowth like a deer. He soon reaches the sight of my attack, must see the blood. \"Johanna! Katniss!\" he calls. I stay put until he goes in the direction Johanna and the Careers took.\\n\\n I move as quickly as I can without sending the world into a whirl. My head throbs with the rapid beat of my heart. The insects, possibly excited by the smell of blood, have increased their clicking until it\u0027s a continuous roar in my ears. No, wait. Maybe my ears are actually ringing from the hit. Until the insects shut up, it will be impossible to tell. But when the insects go silent, the lightning will start. I have to move faster. I have to get to Peeta.\\n\\n The boom of a cannon pulls me up short. Someone has died. I know that with everyone running around armed and scared right now, it could be anybody. But whoever it is, I believe the death will trigger a kind of free-for-all out here in the night. People will kill first and wonder about their motives later. I force my legs into a run.\\n\\n Something snags my feet and I sprawl out on the ground. I feel it wrapping around me, entwining me in sharp fibers. A net! This must be one of Finnick\u0027s fancy nets, positioned to trap me, and he must be nearby, trident in hand. I flail around for a moment, only working the web more tightly around me, and then I catch a glimpse of it in the moonlight. Confused, I lift my arm and see it\u0027s entangled in shimmering golden threads. It\u0027s not one of Finnick\u0027s nets at all, but Beetee\u0027s wire. I carefully rise to my feet and find I\u0027m in a patch of the stuff that caught on a trunk on its way back to the lightning tree. Slowly I disengage myself from the wire, step out of its reach, and continue uphill.\\n\\n On the good side, I\u0027m on the right path and have not been so disoriented by the head injury as to lose my sense of direction. On the bad side, the wire has reminded me of the oncoming lightning storm. I can still hear the insects, but are they starting to fade?\\n\\n I keep the loops of wire a few feet to my left as a guide as I run but take great care not to touch them. If those insects are fading and the first bolt is about to strike the tree, then all its power will come surging down that wire and anyone in contact with it will die.\\n\\n The tree swims into view, its trunk festooned with gold. I slow down, try to move with some stealth, but I\u0027m really just lucky to be upright. I look for a sign of the others. No one. No one is there. \"Peeta?\" I call softly. \"Peeta?\"\\n\\n A soft moan answers me and I whip around to find a figure lying higher up on the ground. \"Beetee!\" I exclaim. I hurry and kneel beside him. The moan must have been involuntary. He\u0027s not conscious, although I can see no wound except a gash below the crook of his elbow. I grab a nearby handful of moss and clumsily wrap it while I try to rouse him. \"Beetee! Beetee, what\u0027s going on! Who cut you? Beetee!\" I shake him in the way you should never shake an injured person, but I don\u0027t know what else to do. He moans again and briefly raises a hand to ward me off.\\n\\n This is when I notice he\u0027s holding a knife, one Peeta was carrying earlier, I think, which is wrapped loosely in wire.\\n\\n Perplexed, I stand and lift the wire, confirming it\u0027s attached back at the tree. It takes me a moment to remember the second, much shorter strand that Beetee wound around a branch and left on the ground before he even began his design on the tree. I\u0027d thought it had some electrical significance, had been set aside to be used later. But it never was, because there\u0027s probably a good twenty, twenty-five yards here.\\n\\n I squint hard up the hill and realize we\u0027re only a few paces from the force field. There\u0027s the telltale square, high up and to my right, just as it was this morning. What did Beetee do? Did he actually try to drive the knife into the force field the way Peeta did by accident? And what\u0027s the deal with the wire? Was this his backup plan? If electrifying the water failed, did he mean to send the lightning bolt\u0027s energy into the force field? What would that do, anyway? Nothing? A great deal? Fry us all? The force field must mostly be energy, too, I guess. The one in the Training Center was invisible. This one seems to somehow mirror the jungle. But I\u0027ve seen it falter when Peeta\u0027s knife struck it and when my arrows hit. The real world lies right behind it.\\n\\n My ears are not ringing. It was the insects after all. I know that now because they are dying out quickly and I hear nothing but the jungle sounds. Beetee is useless. I can\u0027t rouse him. I can\u0027t save him. I don\u0027t know what he was trying to do with the knife and the wire and he\u0027s incapable of explaining. The moss bandage on my arm is soaked and there\u0027s no use fooling myself. I\u0027m so light-headed I\u0027ll black out in a matter of minutes. I\u0027ve got to get away from this tree and -\\n\\n \"Katniss!\" I hear his voice though he\u0027s a far distance away. But what is he doing? Peeta must have figured out that everyone is hunting us by now. \"Katniss!\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t protect him. I can\u0027t move fast or far and my shooting abilities are questionable at best. I do the one thing I can to draw the attackers away from him and over to me. \"Peeta!\" I scream out. \"Peeta! I\u0027m here! Peeta!\" Yes, I will draw them in, any in my vicinity, away from Peeta and over to me and the lightning tree that will soon be a weapon in and of itself. \"I\u0027m here! I\u0027m here!\" He won\u0027t make it. Not with that leg in the night. He will never make it in time. \"Peeta!\"\\n\\n It\u0027s working. I can hear them coming. Two of them. Crashing through the jungle. My knees start to give out and I sink down next to Beetee, resting my weight on my heels. My bow and arrow lift into position. If I can take them out, will Peeta survive the rest?\\n\\n Enobaria and Finnick reach the lightning tree. They can\u0027t see me, sitting above them on the slope, my skin camouflaged in ointment. I home in on Enobaria\u0027s neck. With any luck, when I kill her, Finnick will duck behind the tree for cover just as the lightning bolt strikes. And it will be any second. There\u0027s only a faint insect click here and there. I can kill them now. I can kill them both.\\n\\n Another cannon.\\n\\n \"Katniss!\" Peeta\u0027s voice howls for me. But this time I don\u0027t answer. Beetee still breathes faintly beside me. He and I will soon die. Finnick and Enobaria will die. Peeta is alive. Two cannons have sounded. Brutus, Johanna, Chaff. Two of them are already dead. That will leave Peeta with only one tribute to kill. And that is the very best I can do. One enemy.\\n\\n Enemy. Enemy. The word is tugging at a recent memory. Pulling it into the present. The look on Haymitch\u0027s face. \"Katniss, when you\u0027re in the arena ...\" The scowl, the misgiving. \"What?\" I hear my own voice tighten as I bristle at some unspoken accusation. \"You just remember who the enemy is,\" Haymitch says. \"That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n Haymitch\u0027s last words of advice to me. Why would I need reminding? I have always known who the enemy is. Who starves and tortures and kills us in the arena. Who will soon kill everyone I love.\\n\\n My bow drops as his meaning registers. Yes, I know who the enemy is. And it\u0027s not Enobaria.\\n\\n I finally see Beetee\u0027s knife with clear eyes. My shaking hands slide the wire from the hilt, wind it around the arrow just above the feathers, and secure it with a knot picked up in training.\\n\\n I rise, turning to the force field, fully revealing myself but no longer caring. Only caring about where I should direct my tip, where Beetee would have driven the knife if he\u0027d been able to choose. My bow tilts up at the wavering square, the flaw, the ... what did he call it that day? The chink in the armor. I let the arrow fly, see it hit its mark and vanish, pulling the thread of gold behind it.\\n\\n My hair stands on end and the lightning strikes the tree.\\n\\n A flash of white runs up the wire, and for just a moment, the dome bursts into a dazzling blue light. I\u0027m thrown backward to the ground, body useless, paralyzed, eyes frozen wide, as feathery bits of matter rain down on me. I can\u0027t reach Peeta. I can\u0027t even reach my pearl. My eyes strain to capture one last image of beauty to take with me.\\n\\n Right before the explosions begin, I find a star. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/catching-fire-the-hunger-games-2/page-26.html","bookId":1686,"book":{"id":1686,"title":"Catching Fire (The Hunger Games #2)","description":"Storyline: Catching Fire (The Hunger Games #2) \\n Sparks are igniting. \\n Flames are spreading. \\n And the Capitol wants revenge. \\n Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.
