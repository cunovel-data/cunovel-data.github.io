He drew one hand along the pale, elegant curve of her back. She arched into the caress, sighing his name. He lay over her, changing the angle between them, still cupping her sex as he thrust. She shuddered as a few more spasms were teased out, passion splotches rising on her shoulders and back. He put his mouth to the patches of color, kissing every blushing place as he rocked slowly, working deeper in her, tighter, until he finally went still and came with violent spurts. Rolling off her, Kev gathered Win against his ribs and struggled to catch his breath. His heartbeat hammered in his ears for some minutes, which was why he was slow to notice a knock at the door. Win reached up to his cheeks and guided his face to hers. Her eyes were round. \"Someone\u0027s here,\" she said. Chapter Nineteen Cursing beneath his breath, Kev dragged on his trousers and shirt and went barefoot to the door. Opening it, he saw Cam Rohan standing there nonchalantly, a valise in one hand and a covered basket in the other. \"Hello.\" Cam \u0027s hazel eyes danced with mischief. \"I\u0027ve brought you a few things.\" \"How did you find us?\" Kev asked without heat. \"I knew you hadn\u0027t gone far. None of your clothes were missing, nor any bags or trunks. And since the front gatehouse was too obvious, this was the next place I thought of. Aren\u0027t you going to invite me in?\" \"No,\" Kev said shortly, and Cam grinned. \"If our positions were reversed, phral, I suppose I\u0027d be just as inhospitable. There\u0027s food in the basket, and clothes for both of you in the valise.\" \"Thank you.\" Kev took the items and set them just inside the door. Straightening, he looked at his brother, searching for any sign of censure. There was none. \"Ov yilo isi?\" Cam asked. It was an old Romany phrase, meaning \"Is all well here?\" But it was literally translated as \"Is there heart here?\" which seemed rather appropriate. \"Yes,\" Kev said softly. \"There is nothing you need?\" \"For the first time in my life,\" Kev admitted, \"there is nothing I need.\" Cam smiled. \"Good.\" Nonchalantly tucking his hands in his coat pockets, he braced a shoulder against the door frame. \"What is the situation at Ramsay House?\" Kev asked, half-dreading the answer. \"There were a few moments of chaos this morning, when it was discovered that you were both gone.\" A diplomatic pause. \" Harrow \u0027s been insisting that Win was taken against her will. At one point he threatened to go to the parish constable. Harrow says if you don\u0027t return with Win by nightfall, he\u0027ll take drastic action.\" \"What would that be?\" Kev inquired darkly. \"I don\u0027t know. But you might give a thought to the rest of us having to stay at Ramsay House with him while you\u0027re out here with his fiancée.\" \"She\u0027s my fiancée now. And I\u0027ll bring her back when I damn well please.\" \"Understood.\" Cam \u0027s lips twitched. \"You intend to marry her soon, I hope?\" \"Not soon,\" Kev said. \"Immediately.\" \"Thank God. Even for the Hathaways, this is all a bit untoward.\" Cam glanced over Merripen\u0027s disheveled form and smiled. \"It\u0027s good to see you at ease finally, Merripen. If it were anyone but you, I\u0027d say you actually looked happy.\" It was not easy to shed the habit of privacy. But Kev was actually tempted to confide in his brother, things he wasn\u0027t even certain he had words for. Such as the discovery that the love of a woman could make the entire world seem new. Or his wonder that Win, who had always seemed so fragile and in need of protection, had emerged as an even stronger presence than he. \"Rohan,\" he asked quietly, to keep Win from overhearing, \"I have a question…\" \"Yes?\" \"Do you conduct your marriage the way of the gadje or the Rom?\" \"Mostly the way of the gadje,\" Rohan said without hesitation. \"It wouldn\u0027t work otherwise. Amelia is hardly the kind of woman who could be treated as a subordinate. But as a Rom, I will always reserve the right to protect and look after her as I see fit.\" He smiled slightly. \"You will find a middle way, just as we have.\" Kev scrubbed his hand through his hair and asked guardedly, \"Are the Hathaways angry about what I\u0027ve done?\" \"You mean carrying Win off?\" \"Yes.\" \"The only complaint I heard was that you took far too long.\" \"Do any of them know where we are?\" \"Not that I\u0027m aware of.\" Cam \u0027s smile turned wry. \"I can buy you a few more hours, phral. But have her back by nightfall, if for no other reason than to shut Harrow up.\" He frowned slightly. \"He\u0027s an odd one, that gadjo r Kev gave him an alert glance. \"Why do you say that?\" Cam shrugged. \"Most men in his position would have done something, anything, by now. Destroyed some furniture. Gone for someone\u0027s throat. By this time, I would have turned all of Hampshire upside down to find my woman. But Harrow only talks. And talks.\" \"About what?\" \"He\u0027s said quite a lot about what his rights are, what he\u0027s entitled to, his sense of betrayal… but so far it hasn\u0027t occurred to him to express any concern about Win\u0027s welfare, or consider what she wants. Overall, he acts like a child whose toy has been taken from him and who wants it to be given back.\" Cam grimaced. \"Damned embarrassing, even for a gadjo.\" He raised his voice and called to the unseen Win, \"I\u0027m leaving now. Good day, little sister.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-71.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: He has tried hard to forget her.
