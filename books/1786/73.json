Bloody hell, Kev thought, realizing that something had changed in him, something that could never be put back. All his defenses had been reduced to the uncertain strength of one small woman.\\n\\n The sun was descending into the basin of rich wooded valleys by the time they had both dressed. The fires were extinguished, leaving the cottage cold and dark.\\n\\n Win clung to Merripen\u0027s hand anxiously as he led her to the horse. \"I wonder why happiness always seems so fragile,\" she said. \"I think the things our family has experienced… losing our parents, Leo losing Laura, the fire, my illness… have made me aware of how easily the things we value can be snatched away. Life can change from one moment to the next.\"\\n\\n \"Not everything changes. Some things last forever.\"\\n\\n Win stopped and turned to face him, wrapping her arms around his neck. He responded immediately, holding her secure and close, locking her against his powerful body. Win buried her face in his chest. \"I hope so,\" she said after a moment. \"Are you really mine now, Kev?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always been yours,\" he said against her ear.\\n\\n Braced for the usual clamor of her sisters, Win was relieved when she and Kev returned to Ramsay House and found it serene and quiet. So unusually serene that it was clear everyone had agreed to behave as if nothing unusual had transpired. She found Amelia, Poppy, Miss Marks, and Beatrix in the upstairs parlor, the first three doing needlework while Beatrix read aloud.\\n\\n As Win entered the room cautiously, Beatrix paused, and the women looked up with bright, curious gazes.\\n\\n \"Hello, dear,\" Amelia said warmly. \"Did you have a nice outing with Merripen?\" As if it had been nothing more than a picnic or carriage drive.\\n\\n \"Yes, thank you.\" Win smiled at Beatrix. \"Do go on, Bea. Whatever you\u0027re reading sounds lovely.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a sensation novel,\" Beatrix said. \"Very exciting. There\u0027s a dark and gloomy mansion, and servants who behave oddly, and a secret door behind a tapestry.\" She lowered her voice dramatically. \"Someone\u0027s about to be murdered.\"\\n\\n While Beatrix continued, Win sat beside Amelia. Win felt her older sister\u0027s hand reach for hers. A small but capable hand. A comforting grip. So much was expressed in Amelia\u0027s loving clasp, and in the returning pressure of Win\u0027s fingers… concern, acceptance, reassurance.\\n\\n \"Where is he?\" Amelia whispered.\\n\\n Win felt a pang of worry, though she kept her expression serene. \"He\u0027s gone to talk to Dr. Harrow.\"\\n\\n Amelia\u0027s grip tightened. \"Well,\" she returned wryly, \"it should be a lively conversation. I\u0027ve gotten the impression that your Harrow has been saving up quite a few things to say.\"\\n\\n \"You crude, stupid peasant.\" Julian Harrow was white-faced but controlled as he and Kev met in the library. \"You have no idea what you\u0027ve done. In your haste to reach out and grab what you want, you\u0027ve given no heed to the consequences. And you won\u0027t until it\u0027s too late. Until you\u0027ve killed her.\"\\n\\n Having a fairly good idea of what Harrow was going to say, Kev had already decided how he would deal with him. For Win\u0027s sake, Kev would tolerate any number of insults or accusations. The doctor would have his say… and Kev would let it all roll off his back. He had won. Win was his now, and nothing else mattered.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t easy, however. Harrow was the perfect picture of an outraged romantic hero… slim, elegant, his face pale and indignant. He made Kev feel like a swarthy oafish villain by contrast. And those last words, until you\u0027ve killed her, chilled him to the marrow.\\n\\n So many vulnerable creatures had suffered at his hands. No one with Kev\u0027s past could ever deserve Win. And even though she had forgiven his history of brutality, he could never forget.\\n\\n \"No one is going to harm her,\" Kev said. \"It\u0027s obvious that as your wife, she would have been well cared for, but it wasn\u0027t what she wanted. She\u0027s made her choice.\"\\n\\n \"Under duress!\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t force her.\"\\n\\n \"Of course you did,\" Harrow said with contempt. \"You carried her off in a display of brute strength. And being a woman, of course she thought it thrilling and romantic. Women can be dominated and persuaded into accepting nearly anything. And in the future, as she\u0027s dying in childbirth, in grotesque pain, she won\u0027t blame you for it. But you\u0027ll know that you\u0027re responsible.\" A harsh laugh escaped him as he saw Kev\u0027s expression. \"Are you really so simple that you don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\\n\\n \"You believe she\u0027s too fragile to bear children,\" Kev said. \"But she consulted another doctor in London, who-\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Did Winnifred tell you the name of this doctor?\" Harrow \u0027s eyes were frosty gray, his tone brittle with condescension.\\n\\n Kev shook his head.\\n\\n \"I persisted in asking,\" Harrow said, \"until she told me. And I knew at once it was an invented name. A sham. But just to make certain, I checked the registers of every legitimate physician in London. The doctor she named doesn\u0027t exist. She was lying, Merripen.\" Harrow raked his hands through his hair and paced back and forth. \"Women are as devious as children when it comes to getting their way. My God, you\u0027re easily manipulated, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Kev couldn\u0027t answer. He had believed Win, for the simple reason that she never lied. As far as he knew, there was only one time in her life she had ever deceived him, and that had been to trick him into taking morphine when he\u0027d been suffering from a burn wound. Later he\u0027d understood why she\u0027d done it, and he had forgiven her at once. But if she had lied about this… Anguish burned like acid in his blood. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-73.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: He has tried hard to forget her. \\n Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy.
