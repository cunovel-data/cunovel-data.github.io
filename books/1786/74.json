On condition that she hasn\u0027t conceived.\" He broke off as Kev fastened a lethal glare on him. \"Oh, you may glower, but you can\u0027t deny the truth. Look at you-how can you justify what you\u0027ve done? You\u0027re a filthy Gypsy, attracted to pretty baubles like the rest of your ilk.\"\\n\\n Harrow watched Kev closely as he continued. \"I\u0027m sure you love her, in your fashion. Not in a refined way, not in the way she truly needs, but as much as someone of your kind is capable. I find that somewhat touching. And pitiable. No doubt Winnifred feels that the bonds of childhood kinship give you more of a claim on her than any other man could possibly have. But she has been too long sheltered from the world. She has neither the wisdom nor the experience to know her own needs. If she does marry you, it will only be a matter of time before she tires of you, and wants more than you could ever offer. Go find a sturdy peasant girl, Merripen. Better yet, a Gypsy woman who would be happy with the simple life you could give her. You want a nightingale, when you would be so much better served with a nice, robust pigeon. Do the right thing, Merripen. Give her to me. It\u0027s not too late. She\u0027ll be safe with me,\"\\n\\n Kev could barely hear his own rasping voice, his pulse hammering with confusion and despair and fury.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should ask the Lanhams. Would they agree that she\u0027d be safer with you?\"\\n\\n And without glancing to judge the effect of his words, Kev strode from the library.\\n\\n Win\u0027s sense of unease grew as evening settled over the house. She stayed in the parlor with her sisters and Miss Marks until Beatrix had tired of reading. The only relief from Win\u0027s growing tension was in watching the antics of Beatrix\u0027s ferret, Dodger, who seemed enamored of Miss Marks, despite-or perhaps because of-her obvious antipathy. He kept creeping up to the governess and trying to steal one of her knitting needles, while she watched him with narrowed eyes.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even consider it,\" Miss Marks told the hopeful ferret with chilling calm. \"Or I\u0027ll cut off your tail with a carving knife.\"\\n\\n Beatrix grinned. \"I thought that only happened to blind mice, Miss Marks,\"\\n\\n \"It works on any offending rodent,\" Miss Marks returned darkly.\\n\\n \"Ferrets are not rodents, actually,\" Beatrix said. \"They\u0027re classified as mustelidae. Weasels. So one might say the ferret is a distant cousin of the mouse.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a family I\u0027d care to become closely acquainted with,\" Poppy said.\\n\\n Dodger draped himself across the arm of the settee and pinned a love-struck gaze on Miss Marks, who ignored him.\\n\\n Win smiled and stretched. \"I\u0027m fatigued. I\u0027ll bid everyone good night now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fatigued as well,\" Amelia said, covering a deep yawn.\\n\\n \"Perhaps we should all retire,\" Miss Marks suggested, deftly packing away her knitting in a little basket.\\n\\n They all went to their rooms, while Win\u0027s nerves bristled in the ominous silence of the hallway. Where was Merripen? What had been said between him and Julian?\\n\\n A lamp burned low in her room, its glow pushing feebly against the encroaching shadows. She blinked as she saw a motionless form in the corner… Merripen, occupying a chair.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she breathed in surprise.\\n\\n His gaze tracked her as she came closer to him.\\n\\n \"Kev?\" she asked hesitantly, while a chill slithered down her spine. The talk had not gone well. Something was wrong. \"What is it?\" she asked huskily.\\n\\n Merripen stood and towered over her, his expression unfathomable. \"Who was the doctor you saw in London, Win? How did you find him?\"\\n\\n Then she understood. Her stomach dropped, and she took a few steadying breaths. \"There was no doctor,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t see the need for it.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t see the need,\" he repeated slowly.\\n\\n \"No. Because-as Julian said later-I could go from doctor to doctor until I found one who would give me the answer I wanted.\"\\n\\n Merripen let out a breath that sounded like a scrape in his throat. He shook his head. \"Jesus.\"\\n\\n Win had never seen him look so devastated, beyond shouting or anger. She moved toward him with her hand outstretched. \"Kev, please, let me-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t. Please.\" He was struggling visibly to control himself.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said earnestly. \"I wanted you so much, and I was going to have to marry Julian, and I thought if I told you about having seen another doctor, it would… well, push you a bit.\"\\n\\n He turned away from her, his hands clenched.\\n\\n \"It makes no difference,\" Win said, trying to sound calm, trying to think above the desperate pounding of her heart. \"It changes nothing, especially after today.\"\\n\\n \"It makes a difference if you lie to me,\" he said in a guttural tone.\\n\\n Romany males could not countenance being manipulated by their women. And she had broken Merripen\u0027s trust at a time when he had been particularly vulnerable. He had let down his guard, had let her inside. But how else could she have had him?\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t feel I had a choice,\" she said. \"You\u0027re impossibly stubborn when your mind is made up. I didn\u0027t know how to change it.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ve just lied again. Because you\u0027re not sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry that you\u0027re hurt and angry, and I understand how much you-\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-74.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: He has tried hard to forget her. \\n Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy.
