{"id":77407,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"And yourself?\"\\n\\n \"And myself.\"\\n\\n Amelia smoothed his coat, her lip trembling. \"Then you had better stop leading the life of a drunken wastrel,\" she said.\\n\\n Leo grinned. \"But I\u0027ve always believed in cultivating one\u0027s natural talents to the fullest.\" He lowered his head so she could kiss his cheek. \"You\u0027re a fine one to talk about how to conduct oneself,\" he said. \"You, who just married a man you barely know.\"\\n\\n \"It was the best thing I ever did,\" Amelia said.\\n\\n \"Since he\u0027s paying for my trip to France, I suppose I can\u0027t disagree.\" Leo reached out to shake Cam \u0027s hand. After a rocky beginning, the two men had come to like each other in a short time. \"Good-bye, phral,\" Leo said, using the Romany word that Cam had taught him for \"brother.\" \"I have no doubt you\u0027ll do an excellent job taking care of the family. You\u0027ve already gotten rid of me, which is a promising beginning.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll return to a rebuilt home and a thriving estate, my lord.\"\\n\\n Leo gave a low laugh. \"I can\u0027t wait to see what you will accomplish. You know, not just any peer would entrust all his affairs to a pair of Gypsies.\"\\n\\n \"I would say with certainty,\" Cam replied, \"that you\u0027re the only one.\"\\n\\n After Win had bid farewell to her sisters, Leo settled her into the carriage and sat beside her. There was a soft lurch as the team pulled forward, and they headed to the London docks.\\n\\n Leo studied Win\u0027s profile. As usual, she showed little emotion, her fine-boned face serene and composed. But he saw the flags of color burning on the pale crests of her cheeks, and the way her fingers clenched and tugged at the embroidered handkerchief in her lap. It had not escaped him that Merripen hadn\u0027t been there to say good-bye. Leo wondered if he and Win had exchanged harsh words.\\n\\n Sighing, Leo reached out and put his arm around his sister\u0027s thin, breakable frame. She stiffened but did not pull away. After a moment, the handkerchief came up, and he saw that she was blotting her eyes. She was afraid, and ill, and miserable.\\n\\n And he was all she had.\\n\\n God help her.\\n\\n He made an attempt at humor. \"You didn\u0027t let Beatrix give you one of her pets, did you? I\u0027m warning you, if you\u0027re carrying a hedgehog or a rat, it goes overboard as soon as we\u0027re on the ship.\"\\n\\n Win shook her head and blew her nose.\\n\\n \"You know,\" Leo said conversationally, still holding her, \"you\u0027re the least amusing of all the sisters. I can\u0027t think how I ended up going to France with you.\"\\n\\n \"Believe me,\" came her watery reply, \"I wouldn\u0027t be this boring if I had any say in the matter. When I get well I intend to behave very badly indeed.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s something to look forward to.\" He rested his cheek on her soft blond hair.\\n\\n \"Leo,\" she asked after a moment, \"why did you volunteer to go to the clinic with me? Is it because you want to get well, too?\"\\n\\n Leo was both touched and annoyed by the innocent question. Win, like everyone else in the family, considered his excessive drinking an illness that might be cured by a period of abstinence and healthful surroundings. But his drinking was merely a symptom of the real illness-a grief so persistent that at times it threatened to stop his heart from beating.\\n\\n There was no cure for losing Laura.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said to Win. \"I have no aspirations to get well. I merely want to continue my debauchery with new scenery.\" He was rewarded by a small chuckle. \"Win… did you and Merripen quarrel? Is that why he wasn\u0027t there to see you off?\" At her prolonged silence, Leo rolled his eyes. \"If you insist on being closemouthed, Sis, it\u0027s going to be a long journey indeed.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we quarreled.\"\\n\\n \"About what? Harrow \u0027s clinic?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. That was part of it, but…\" Win shrugged uncomfortably. \"It\u0027s too complicated. It would take forever to explain.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re about to cross an ocean and half of France. Believe me, we have time.\"\\n\\n After the carriage had departed, Cam went to the mews behind the hotel, a tidy building with horse stalls and a carriage house on the ground floor, and servants\u0027 accommodations above. As he had expected, Merripen was grooming the horses. The hotel mews were run on a part-livery system, which meant some of the stabling chores had to be assumed by the horse owners. At the moment Merripen was taking care of Cam \u0027s black gelding, a three-year-old named Pooka.\\n\\n Merripen\u0027s movements were light, quick, and methodical as he ran a brush over the horse\u0027s shining flanks.\\n\\n Cam watched him for a moment, appreciating the Rom\u0027s deftness. The story that Gypsies were exceptionally good with horses was no myth. A Rom considered the horse to be a comrade, an animal of poetry and heroic instincts. And Pooka accepted Merripen\u0027s presence with a calm deference he showed to few people.\\n\\n \"What do you want?\" Merripen asked without looking at him.\\n\\n Cam approached the open stall leisurely, smiling as Pooka lowered his head and nudged his chest. \"No, boy… no sugar lumps.\" He patted the muscular neck. His shirtsleeves were rolled up to his elbows, exposing the tattoo of a black flying horse on his forearm. Cam had no memory of when he\u0027d gotten the tattoo… It had been there forever, for reasons his grandmother would never explain.\\n\\n The symbol was an Irish nightmare steed called a pooka, an alternately malevolent and benevolent horse who spoke in a human voice and flew at night on widespread wings. According to legend, the pooka would come to an unsuspecting human\u0027s door at midnight, and take him on a ride that would leave him forever changed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-4.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: He has tried hard to forget her. \\n Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy.
