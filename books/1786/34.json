{"id":77436,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\"Very nice,phral\" Cam said in admiration.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re leaving,\" Merripen informed him curtly. \"Before more of them come.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go to a tavern,\" Cam said. \"I need a drink.\"\\n\\n Merripen mounted his bay without a word. For once, it seemed, Merripen and Cam were in agreement.\\n\\n Taverns were often described as the busy man\u0027s recreation, the idle man\u0027s business, and the melancholy man\u0027s sanctuary. The Hell and Bucket, located in the more disreputable environs of London, could also have been called the criminal\u0027s covert and the drunkard\u0027s haven. It suited Cam and Kev\u0027s purposes quite well, being a place that would serve two Roma without blinking an eye. The ale was good quality, twelve-bushel strength, and although the barmaids were surly, they did an adequate job of keeping the tankard full and the floor swept.\\n\\n Cam and Kev sat at a small table, lit by a turnip that had been carved into a candleholder, with tallow runneling over its purple-tinged sides. Kev drank half a tankard without stopping and set the vessel down. He rarely drank anything except wine, and that in moderation. He didn\u0027t like the loss of control that came with drinking.\\n\\n Cam, however, drained his own tankard. He leaned back in his chair and surveyed Kev with a slight smile. \"I\u0027ve always been amused by your inability to hold your liquor,\" Cam remarked. \"A Rom your size should be able to drink a quarter barrel to the pitching. But now to discover that you\u0027re half-Irish as well… it\u0027s inexcusable, phral. We\u0027ll have to work on your drinking skills.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going to tell this to anyone,\" Kev told him grimly.\\n\\n \"About the fact that we\u0027re brothers?\" Cam seemed to enjoy Kev\u0027s visible wince. \"It\u0027s not so bad, being half gadjo\" he told Kev kindly, and snickered at his expression. \"It certainly explains why both of us have found a stopping place, while most Roma choose to wander forever. It\u0027s the Irish in us that-\"\\n\\n \"Not… one… word,\" Kev said. \"Not even to the family.\"\\n\\n Cam sobered a little. \"I don\u0027t keep secrets from my wife.\",\\n\\n \"Not even for her safety?\"\\n\\n Cam appeared to think that over, gazing through one of the narrow windows of the tavern. The streets thronged with costermongers, the wheels of their barrows rattling over the cobblestones. Their cries rose thick in the air as they tried to interest customers in bonnet boxes, toys, lucifer matches, umbrellas, and brooms. On the opposite side of the street, a butcher-shop window gleamed crimson and white with freshly cut meat.\\n\\n \"You think our father\u0027s family might still want to kill us?\" Cam asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible.\"\\n\\n Absently Cam rubbed over his own sleeve, over the place where the pooka mark was located. \"You realize that none of this: the tattoos, the secrets, splitting us apart, giving us different names, would have happened unless our father was a man of some worth. Because otherwise, the gadjos wouldn\u0027t give a damn about a pair of half-breed children. I wonder why he left our mother? I wonder-\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a damn.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to do a new search of parish birth records. Perhaps our father-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t. Let it lie.\"\\n\\n \"Let it lie?\" Cam gave him an incredulous glance. \"Do you actually want to ignore what we found out today? Ignore the kinship between us?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Shaking his head slowly, Cam turned one of the gold rings on his fingers. \"After today, Brother, I understand much more about you. The way you-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me that.\"\\n\\n \"I imagine being raised like a pit animal doesn\u0027t inspire many fond feelings for the human race. I\u0027m sorry that you were the unlucky one, being sent to our uncle. But you can\u0027t let that stop you from leading a full life now. From finding out who you are.\"\\n\\n \"Finding out who I am won\u0027t get me what I want. Nothing will. So there\u0027s no point in it.\"\\n\\n \"What is it you want?\" Cam asked softly.\\n\\n Clamping his mouth shut, Kev glared at Cam.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t even bring yourself to say it?\" Cam prodded. When Kev remained obstinately silent, Cam reached over for his tankard. \"Are you going to finish this?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Cam drank the ale in a few expedient gulps. \"You know,\" he remarked wryly, \"it was a lot easier managing a club full of drunkards, gamblers, and assorted criminals than it is to deal with you and the Hathaways.\" He set the tankard down and waited a moment before asking quietly, \"Did you suspect anything? Did you think the tie between us might be this close?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I think I did, deep down. I always knew I wasn\u0027t supposed to be alone.\"\\n\\n Kev gave him a dour look. \"This changes nothing. I\u0027m not your family. There is no tie between us.\"\\n\\n \"Blood counts for something,\" Cam replied affably. \"And since the rest of my tribe has disappeared, you\u0027re all I\u0027ve got, phral. Just try and get rid of me.\"\\n\\n Chapter Eleven\\n\\n Win descended the main staircase of the hotel while one of the Hathaways\u0027 footmen, Charles, followed closely. \"Careful, Miss Hathaway,\" he cautioned. \"One slip and you could break your neck on these stairs.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Charles,\" she said without moderating her speed. \"But there\u0027s no need to worry.\" She was quite adept at stairs, having gone up and down long staircases at the clinic in France as part of her daily exercise. \"I should warn you, Charles, that I will proceed at a vigorous pace.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-34.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: He has tried hard to forget her. \\n Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy.
