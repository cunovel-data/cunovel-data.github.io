{"id":77427,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"As Merripen cupped the soft shape of her breast over the gown, the tip ached and hardened. His head bent. To Win\u0027s astonishment, she felt him biting against the cloth until her nipple was caught in the light clamp of his teeth. A whimper escaped her, and her h*ps jerked upward reflexively.\n Merripen crawled over her. His face was misted with sweat, his nostrils flared from the force of his breathing. The front of her skirts had ridden up between them. He tugged them higher and impelled himself between her thighs until she felt the thick ridge of him between the layers of her drawers and his trousers. Her eyes flew open. She stared up into the black fire of his gaze. He moved against her, letting her feel every inch of what he wanted to put inside her, and she moaned and opened to him.\n He made a primitive sound as he rubbed over her again, caressing her with unspeakable intimacy. She wanted him to stop, and at the same time she wanted him never to stop. \"Kev.\" Her voice was shaking. \"Kev-\"\n But his mouth covered hers, penetrating deeply, while his h*ps moved in slow strokes. Shaken and impassioned, she lifted against that demanding hardness. Each wicked thrust caused sensations to spread, heat unfolding.\n Win writhed helplessly, unable to speak with his mouth possessing hers. More heat, more delicious friction. Something was happening, her muscles tightening, her senses opening in readiness for… for what? She was going to faint if he didn\u0027t stop. Her hands groped at his shoulders, pushing at him, but he ignored the feeble shove. Reaching beneath her, he cupped her squirming bottom and pulled her higher, right against the pumping, sliding pressure. A suspended moment of exquisite tension, so sharp that she gave an uneasy whimper.\n Suddenly he flung himself away from her, going to the opposite side of the room. Bracing his hands against the wall, he hung his head and panted, and shivered like a wet dog.\n Dazed and trembling, Win moved slowly, restoring her clothing. She felt desperate and painfully empty, needing something she had no name for. When she was covered again, she left the bed on unsteady legs.\n She approached Merripen cautiously. It was obvious he was aroused. Painfully so. She wanted to touch him again. Most of all she wanted him to put his arms around her and tell her how overjoyed he was to have her back.\n But he spoke before she reached him. And his tone was not encouraging. \"If you touch me,\" he said in a guttural voice, \"I\u0027m going to drag you back to that bed. And I won\u0027t be responsible for what happens next.\"\n Win stopped, plaiting her fingers.\n Eventually Merripen recovered his breath. And he gave her a glance that should have immolated her on the spot.\n \"Next time,\" he said flatly, \"some advance warning of your arrival might be a good idea.\"\n \"I did send advance notice.\" Win was amazed that she could even speak. \"It must have been lost.\" She paused. \"That was a f-far warmer welcome than I expected, considering the way you\u0027ve ignored me for the past two years.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t ignored you.\"\n Win took quick refuge in sarcasm. \"You wrote to me once in two years.\"\n Merripen turned and rested his back against the wall. \"You didn\u0027t need letters from me.\"\n \"I needed any small sign of affection! And you gave me none.\" She stared at him incredulously as he remained silent. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Kev, aren\u0027t you even going to say that you\u0027re glad I\u0027m well again?\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re well again.\"\n \"Then why are you behaving this way?\"\n \"Because nothing else has changed.\"\n \"You\u0027ve changed,\" she shot back. \"I don\u0027t know you anymore.\"\n \"That\u0027s as it should be.\"\n \"Kev,\" she said in bewilderment, \"why are you behaving this way? I went away to get well. Surely you can\u0027t blame me for that.\"\n \"I blame you for nothing. But the devil knows what you could want from me now.\"\n I want you to love me, she wanted to cry out. She had traveled so far, and yet there was more distance between them than ever. \"I can tell you what I don\u0027t want, Kev, and that is to be estranged from you.\"\n Merripen\u0027s expression was stony and unfeeling. \"We\u0027re not estranged.\" He picked up her cloak and handed it to her. \"Put this on. I\u0027ll take you to your room.\"\n Win pulled the garment around herself, stealing discreet glances at Merripen, who was all brooding energy and suppressed power as he tucked his shirt into his trousers. The X of the braces over his back highlighted his magnificent build.\n \"You needn\u0027t walk with me to my room,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I can find my way back without-\"\n \"You\u0027re to go nowhere in this hotel alone. It\u0027s not safe.\"\n \"You\u0027re right,\" she said sullenly. \"I would hate to be accosted by someone.\"\n The shot hit its mark. Merripen\u0027s mouth hardened and he gave her a dangerous glance as he shrugged into his coat.\n How much he reminded her just now of the rough, wrathful boy he had been when he had first come to the Hathaways.\n \"Kev,\" she said softly, \"can\u0027t we resume our friendship?\"\n \"I\u0027m still your friend.\" \"But nothing more?\" \"No.\"\n Win couldn\u0027t help glancing at the bed, at the rumpled counterpane that covered it, and a new surge of heat went through her.\n Merripen went still as he followed the direction of her gaze. \"That shouldn\u0027t have happened,\" he said roughly. \"I shouldn\u0027t have-\" He stopped and swallowed audibly. \"I haven\u0027t… had a woman in a while. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-25.html","bookId":1786,"book":{"id":1786,"title":"Seduce Me at Sunrise (The Hathaways #2)","description":"Storyline: \n He has tried hard to forget her. \n Kev Merripen has longed for the beautiful, well-bred Winnifred Hathaway ever since her family rescued him from the brink of death when he was just a boy.
