{"id":22305,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Spring, that stole upon the mountains with an evanescent fragrance, and unfolding of delicate greens and shy opening blossoms, swept into the city with a blaze of life and color, with a joyous outpouring of people and bedizening of shop-windows; and nowhere else was its influence so marked as on the Avenue. Motor vehicles crowded from curb to curb, held back or permitted to sweep onward by the uplifted hands of mighty creatures in uniform, horseback and afoot, imperturbably calm, lords and rulers and receivers of tribute; the sidewalks swarmed with people, lines of men and women swinging northward and southward, some buoyantly conscious of new-fashioned raiment, their eyes apparently unaware of the jostling crowd, some with tiny dogs under their arms, some looking at the passing faces, or bowing to people in motor cars, a few glancing into the brilliant windows of the shops, a few chatting and laughing with companions. Benson Flood, returned from Virginia the day before, was one of those who, marching northward, looked searchingly into the faces of the people he passed, and frequently glanced into the automobiles on his right. No one in all that army was more aware than he of the vivid beauty of the moving scene. For three years he had watched the Avenue burst into life and color under the recurring influence of Spring; but he had lost none of the keenness of his first perception of it, none of his delight in its unique splendor, none of the thrill of having achieved the right to be a part of it. Achievement, indeed, was what Benson Flood stood for. Beginning life in a Western town, his subsequent history was one of those spectacular dramas common enough in American progress, yet always thrilling in their exhibition of daring and courage, in their apparent forcing of opportunity, their making and taking of chances, their final conquest of power and wealth. Flood\u0027s career differed from many another only in two particulars: as early as the age of forty he had reached that point where he could afford to lay aside his more public pursuits; and at the same time, perhaps because he had grown no older in the cult, the mere accumulation of wealth ceased to be the first object in life for him. He was the offspring of one of the curious mixtures of race that distinguish America; and doubtless from some ancestor of an older civilization he inherited a taste and longing for that to which, in his youth and early manhood, he had been an absolute stranger. When he left his West behind him, he faced towards those gentler things which, in his fine imagination and the perception trained by the exigencies of his career, he felt to be more desirable than anything he had yet attained to. Certainly they had become to him, untasted though they were at the time, of greater importance. He valued his experiences, his labors, his millions; but they were not enough. However unaccustomed to it he might be, he knew very definitely what he now wanted; and a winter in New York, with a year or two in Europe, had put him in a fair way of adding the fulfillment of his later ambition to his earlier achievements. A race-winning yacht, a few introductions among people who welcome the owners of mines and large fortunes, these gave a social background which, with the excellent foundation of his millions, served very well in New York, and taught him much about those things which he was now so sure of wanting. It was not strange that he believed them to be summed up, embodied, realized to the utmost, in one woman. He was looking for her as he walked up the Avenue on this April afternoon; she loved its life and color and change, and was apt to pass over some part of it as often as she could. So Flood watched the passing women for the face that could so magically quicken his pulses. Many sought his recognition, yet he was oblivious of their number, ignoring the various half-invitations that were tentatively made him—the leaning forward of one in a limousine, the slight pause or lingering look of another. His thoughts were still full of his journey, and Spring on the Avenue only brought up memories—so lately realities—of the breath of the woods, the wind in the tree-tops, the brown and green of fields so lately seen; and Flood had reached that state of mind where all that was sweet in memory, all that was beautiful in the present, all that he desired from the future, only reminded him of the one woman. Several times, through the crowd, he thought he saw her, and went more quickly forward; but as often he fell back, disappointed. Suddenly, in answer to a firm grasp on his arm, he turned. \"Ah, Marshall!\" he said, not too enthusiastically. \"I say, Benny, is it a wager? You\u0027re stalking up the Avenue without a word or a look for anybody, trampling on people, mowing them down by the thousand like a Juggernaut from the West! That\u0027s how I traced you, by the bodies strewn in your path.\" Flood was always amused by Pendleton\u0027s nonsense; yet now he smiled and said nothing. To-day it was not Pendleton he wanted to see. The other seemed to divine this. \"You don\u0027t seem very sociable,\" he remarked. \"Did your lone trip to Virginia give you a confirmed taste for solitude?\" Again Flood smiled; he could no more resist Pendleton\u0027s aimless chatter than a large dog can resist the playfulness of a small one. His side-long glance had to go downwards to meet Marshall\u0027s. \"Quite the contrary,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve bought the old Gore place in Berkeley and now I want to fill it up with guests. I count on you to help me out, Marshall.\" \"Right you are! Come up to Mrs. Maxwell\u0027s with me, and we\u0027ll get dear Cecilia to help us out, too!\" Flood\u0027s face suddenly hardened a little. It was an unconscious trick of his under the stress of any sudden emotion; in effect, it was as if a hand had passed over his features, leaving them expressionless. Many a game had he won, mastered many a situation, by means of it. He paused perceptibly before he answered Pendleton. Then he said, \"I shall have to leave that to you!\" \"You\u0027re too modest, Benny,\" Pendleton said, shaking his head. \"Remember your taxes, man, not to mention your bank account, and don\u0027t let dear Cecilia awe you.\" It was presently made evident enough that the dear Cecilia in question held nothing of awe for Pendleton himself; for they were no sooner in the rather austere little drawing room than he bent over Mrs. Maxwell, and, quite deliberately ignoring the five or six earlier comers, whispered in her ear: \"Get rid of the crowd, Cecilia; we\u0027ve great news for you!\" Mrs. Maxwell was apparently oblivious of his whisper, for she made herself more charming than ever to the other men; yet presently, almost before Flood was aware of it, the others were gone, and she was saying: \"Well, Marshall? You always bring your little budget with you, don\u0027t you? What is it now?\" \"If you\u0027re going to be, nasty, Cecilia, I won\u0027t tell you!\" Flood, who had not so far progressed as to become accustomed to such badinage, looked uneasily from Pendleton to their hostess; but Mrs. Maxwell seated herself beside him on the sofa, and calmly smiled. Apparently she was going to ignore Pendleton for the moment. \"I am always so glad when I can have my tea comfortably, without having to look after a roomful of people,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t take it, I know, Mr. Flood, and Marshall can look out for himself. What do you think of this pink lustre cup, Mr. Flood? It\u0027s Rosamund\u0027s latest acquisition.\" Flood had, after all, learned much in his three years. He bent forward to examine the cup, while Mrs. Maxwell turned its iridescent beauty towards the light. \"It is adorable,\" he said. \"Is Miss Randall hunting for more to-day?\" Again his face had quickly become expressionless, but neither of the others were aware of it, and his question was doomed to remain unanswered. Pendleton could no longer withhold his news. \"Benny\u0027s just back from Virginia, Cecilia,\" he said. \"He\u0027s bought Oakleigh.\" \"I think it\u0027s West Virginia, and it\u0027s just a little farm, you know,\" Flood said, weakly; but his geography was entirely immaterial to the others. \"Oakleigh? The Gore place?\" Flood still found it amazing that so many people knew so many other people; his lately made acquaintances in New York always seemed to know all about his lately made acquaintances in Florida or Virginia or the Berkshires, or, for that matter, in Europe. It was another of the things to which he had not yet become accustomed. \"And he wants you and me to help him fill it up with people,\" Pendleton went on, with the frankness for which he was famous. Mrs. Maxwell looked quickly over her tea-cup at Flood, raising her eyebrows ever so slightly. For once Flood could not control his expression; his face flushed deeply as he leaned towards her. \"If you only would!\" he begged. \"I thought—I scarcely dared to hope—that perhaps if—if Miss Randall came along, too, you might consent to play hostess for a lone man?\" Cecilia was a practiced campaigner, as she had had need to be during the dreary years before she had Rosamund\u0027s money to count upon; instantly she recalled the place Flood could afford to call a \"little farm,\" Oakleigh, white-pillared and stately, with its kennels and stables and conservatories. She could not imagine why he had chosen her unless it were thanks to Pendleton; yet, to be hostess of Oakleigh, even for a week or two, distinctly appealed to her. It would be possible enough, if she were to go as Rosamund\u0027s chaperon. Even Flood had seen that; and if it were left to her to fill its rooms with guests, how many debts might she not cancel! The opportunity was wonderful, a gift from Heaven; but could she count upon Rosamund? Would Rosamund go? There was a lack of complacency in Rosamund that her sister frequently found trying; she wondered how far she might dare to commit her to accepting Flood\u0027s invitation. Yet daring and Cecilia were not strangers, and the opportunity was unique. \"I am not sure of Rosamund\u0027s dates,\" she said. Flood hesitated; but Pendleton, too, had been thinking about the splendor of Oakleigh. \"Oh, but Benny has no dates for Oakleigh yet!\" he said. \"So you may set your own time, Cecilia. Isn\u0027t that so, Benny?\" \"If you only will,\" Flood besought her. After all, Cecilia thought, there was nothing Rosamund could do, if she definitely promised for her! \"Then I think June will be quite perfect,\" she said, and said it none too soon; for the door was suddenly framing the vision of Flood\u0027s desire. For an instant she seemed almost to sway in the doorway, as if she had come to the utmost limit of strength; she was paler than he had ever seen her, and, he thought, more lovely. He could never behold her without an immediate sense of abasement. Her beauty was of that indefinable sort which touches the heart and imagination rather than storms the senses. Men did not look upon her as at some beautiful creature on exhibition; always they looked, to be sure, but straightway the masculine appraisement of their gaze changed to the look one bestows upon some high and lovely thing. Her face had that fullness through the temples that Murillo loved; her eyes, hazel or brown or gray, changing in color with the responsive widening of the pupils, were rather far apart, deeply set, warm with interest when she looked directly at you; dark hair, ruddily brown, that broke into curl whenever a strand escaped, framed her face closely, and was always worn more simply than fashion demanded. She was tall enough to play a man\u0027s games well, and the impression that she gave was one of vigor and alertness, almost of impatience. This was the first time Flood had seen her tired. And, as always when he saw her, it swept over him that she was, alone and above all others, the woman he wanted. She was beautiful, but it was not her beauty, not her social eminence, certainly not her wealth, nor anything that she might be said to represent, that constituted her appeal for him. There was that in her which he had not met elsewhere in his countrywomen, though frequently enough in France and England, a simplicity, a calmness, a dignity, which he interpreted as a consciousness that she needed no pretense, no further struggle or ambition to be other than just what she was. And what she was, was what he very much wanted. For him, she was the bright sum of all desire, the embodiment of everything rare and fine, which he now craved all the more because they had been denied him in his earlier years. Months before, since the first time he saw her, he had known that, and accepted it as an inspiration, as he had accepted and lived upon the fine flashes of imagination that had led him on to fortune in those western days, when imagination and courage had been his stock in trade; it was only the ultimate, and by far the most important, of those! But Miss Randall was certainly unaware that she aroused in anyone in her drawing-room stronger feelings than the mild ones which usually accompany afternoon tea. After an instant\u0027s survey from the doorway, she came into the room, trying to smile through her fatigue. \"Mercy, Rosamund! You look like a ghost! Have you been walking yourself to death again?\" her sister asked. Flood\u0027s greeting was only a silent bow and a touch of her offered hand, but Pendleton was never speechless. \"I say, Rose,\" he cried, \"Flood\u0027s just been inviting us all down to Virginia for June, and dear Cecilia has accepted! Can you stand the joy of having me to talk to for a whole month, Rosamund?\" At a quick spark in her sister\u0027s eyes, Cecilia bent towards her and spoke somewhat hastily. \"Mr. Flood has bought Oakleigh, the Gore place. Isn\u0027t it nice of him to ask us down there, first of all?\" Although to her sister her look seemed to hold many things, to Flood\u0027s infatuated eyes the girl seemed suddenly more tired, harassed, or troubled; and with another of his flashes of intuition he would not give her a chance to reply. He began to tell them about his lone journey, talking very well, quite sure of his facts and with a large enthusiasm, and in spite of herself Rosamund became more and more interested. She even smiled a little at his account of the mountain doctor\u0027s old mare and her wisdom; she even found herself willing to hear more about the doctor! \"But, I assure you,\" Flood went on, \"it wouldn\u0027t have taken anyone long to discover that he was not the usual country doctor. There is something about the man that would attract the attention of the world, if he lived on a pillar or were buried beneath the sands of Arizona. Personality, I suppose, unless you\u0027re willing to look the fact in the face and admit that a certain force emanates from greatness, wherever——\" \"Oh, say!\" Pendleton protested; and Flood laughed, rather shamefacedly, as a man laughs when he is discovered reading a learned book or quoting a classic. But Miss Randall would not have that. \"Please don\u0027t mind him, Mr. Flood; I want to hear the rest of it.\" Again Flood was taken unawares, and his face flushed; but he went on to describe the evening before the doctor\u0027s fire, the four days he had remained, a willing guest, the drives about the mountains in the doctor\u0027s buggy—lest his own car should startle the shy mountain people. \"And since I\u0027ve got back, I\u0027ve been finding out about him. You know how it is—meet a chap you never heard of before, and straightway find out that a dozen people you know have known him for years. \"Last night I met Doctor Hiram Wilson in the club; he said it was the first time he\u0027d had a chance to run in for months, yet he happened to be the first man I saw there. I was telling him something about this chap, and found he knew all about him. \u0027Keenest young investigator I ever knew,\u0027 he said, \u0027and came near working himself to death. How is he now?\u0027 He seemed mighty glad when I told him I could not have suspected that Ogilvie had ever been ill. Then he called Professor Grayson over, to repeat what I\u0027d just told him; and I wish you could have seen old Grayson\u0027s face. He was delighted, but he could really tell more about Ogilvie than I could. It seems that Ogilvie was under him for a time, but had really gone far beyond him; then he made himself ill by working day and night in his laboratory, and some of his medical friends packed him off to those mountains to get well. He was too far gone to protest, I guess; but before he was well enough to come back, he was so interested in the people there that he was willing to stay. Now the big fellows have fallen into the way of sending patients down to Bluemont, in the summer, to be near him; and he consults everywhere all over the country. They told me last night that his investigations and experiments on the nervous system would do more to save the vision than——\" But Miss Randall, at the word, exclaimed, and with parted lips and brightening eyes leaned towards him. Flood stopped, amazed. \"Vision! His work is for vision? For the eyes?\" she cried. \"His experimental work. Of course, in the mountains——\" But Mrs. Maxwell was tired of Flood\u0027s enthusiasm. \"Dear me! She is going to tell him about Eleanor! Take pity on me, Marshall, and help me to escape!\" she exclaimed, jumping up. But her sister was far too deeply interested to be aware of their withdrawing towards the window. \"Oh, Mr. Flood, is he really successful? Can he really help?\" \"I am told, and I believe, that he is a great man, Miss Randall. But surely——\" For the first time the weary look had left her face. \"Mr. Flood, if you can help me! I have a friend, the dearest friend I have in the world, who believes she is going to be blind. I don\u0027t believe it! I will not! And yet, it would not be remarkable—she has been through so much, so much! Oh, I cannot bear to think of it!\" Her hands were clasped on her knees, and she bent her head over them to hide the tears in her eyes. \"You have been with her this afternoon?\" Flood surmised. \"We have spent the afternoon at an oculist\u0027s,\" she said. \"I have begged her for weeks, for weeks, to let me take her—but she is so proud, oh, so foolishly proud—and to-day—to-day—Oh, it is unbearably cruel!\" She arose, and stood half turned from him, to hide her emotion, swaying a little; and intensely as he had wanted many things, Flood had never wanted anything so keenly as to comfort her—to comfort her by taking her in his arms, if he could, but above all, by any means, to comfort her. Hitherto it had seemed impossible, in his modesty, to make her realize his existence apart from the multitude; he welcomed this heaven-sent opportunity. Quite suddenly, in his need, he found his faith in Ogilvie increased a hundredfold; but he was too much concerned to perceive the humor of it. \"Oh, but—\" he cried, \"but I should never in the world accept one man\u0027s opinion as final! And I assure you, Ogilvie is called in consultation by Blake, Wilson, Whitred. I should certainly have her see him!\" She seated herself again, wearily. \"Ah, she is so proud! It is only when she sees I am fairly breaking my heart over her that she will let me do anything.\" \"Then she is not—she has not——?\" \"Oh, as for what she has and what she is, those are quite two different things, Mr. Flood! She is the dearest and loveliest and bravest creature in the world. She is more than I could possibly tell you. I have adored her ever since she was one of the big girls in the school where I was a tiny one. My father and mother were abroad, and Cecilia was up here in the North, with her father\u0027s people, and then married; and I was left in Georgia at school, oh, such a lonely little mite! Eleanor was everything in the world to me—big sister, little mother, friend—everything! Then she married, and my father died abroad and dear Mamma took me over with her. Eleanor and I wrote to each other, and I was godmother for her little boy; but Mamma and I were in France until—until Mamma died, three years ago; and it was only last year, when I came to live with Cecilia, that I found my Eleanor again.\" Unconsciously she was revealing to Flood more of her life than he had known before; he was afraid to interrupt by so much as a question. His face had again taken on the expressionless mask which so well covered his emotion or interest. \"I had never realized it, Mr. Flood; but all the while I was having everything, my precious Eleanor was poor, very poor. She had no relatives near enough to count, and her guardian sent her to school with what little money she had. I\u0027m afraid it did not teach her very well how to support herself! She married the year she left school; she has never spoken of him at all, but I don\u0027t believe her husband was—was all she had believed. When he died, she brought little Bob to New York. \"I heard dear old Mrs. Harley say, only a day or two ago, that there are thousands of Southern girls, dear, sweet girls who have never done any work at all, who come to New York every year to try to earn a living. Sometimes they think they can sing, sometimes they want to become artists, sometimes they just come; and Eleanor was one of them. Only, with her, it was worse, for she had Bob. \"I don\u0027t know how they got along. I was in Europe, and she would only write when I had sent Bob something. I never dreamed that people, people of my own sort, my own friends even, might be hungry, and not have money enough to buy anything to eat.\" \"You ought not to know it now,\" Flood said. But she only shook her head. \"I believe Eleanor has been hungry. And if you could only see her—she is so lovely, as lovely as a white lily!\" \"Oh, but surely, Miss Randall, she could have got help! There are no end of places——\" \"Yes. But a woman like Eleanor can\u0027t seek just any kind of help, you know, and—well, as darling Mrs. Harley says, charity doesn\u0027t help much, when it is only charity. Even from me, Eleanor says she cannot. \"When I came to New York to live with Cecilia, I went at once to see her. She let me do all I could for little Bob, but it was too late. He died. And now she will not let me do anything for her. I ask her what good my money is to me, if she will not let me use it as I want to! She would not even let me take her to an oculist until she saw that I was just breaking my heart over her! And now——\" Again her head was bent over her clasped hands; again she was too moved, for the moment, to speak. Flood seized his opportunity. \"Believe me, it can be arranged,\" he said. \"You have taken me into your confidence—you will let me—advise, won\u0027t you?\" She looked up eagerly, and he went quickly on. \"See your friend, Mrs.——\" \"Mrs. Reeves.\" \"See your friend, Mrs. Reeves, and tell her about Ogilvie. Tell her that he is looking for someone—a lady—to help with his work down in those mountains. Prepare her to accept his offer. I will telegraph him.\" She looked at him blankly. \"But—would it be true? I don\u0027t think I understand!\" He smiled reassuringly. \"It would not be true that I am going to Europe to-morrow—but we could make it true! If we get her away from the city, and near Ogilvie, we can leave everything else to him. He\u0027s really a good deal of a man, you know.\" Rosamund sprang to her feet. \"Cecilia,\" she said, across the room, to her sister, \"I am going back to Eleanor\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77542.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
