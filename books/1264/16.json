{"id":22319,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"The doctor promptly, in his most professional manner, turned Rosamund out of the room as soon as he got there. He preferred the old colored woman even to Eleanor as assistant; and he showed no sign of remembering that night in the Allen house when Rosamund had fought beside him, through the heavy hours, for a woman\u0027s life. When he closed the door of Grace\u0027s room upon her, she was keenly hurt; she could not know that while he worked over poor Grace he was recalling every moment of that earlier scene, viewing it now through the glamor of his later knowledge of her. Aunt Sue was installed as supreme power in the sick-room. Grace\u0027s life hung by a thread for days, and before the doctor could be sure that all would be well the disquieting news of Joe Tobet\u0027s arrest came to disturb them still further. Snow lay deep over everything before Grace came down among them, a pale wraith of a woman, but with a deepened sweetness of expectation in her face. They feared to tell her of Joe\u0027s predicament, but knew afterward that it would have been better to do so; for she was to discover it in one of those unforeseen, brutal ways that so often accompany the disasters of the poor. One day a shivering small boy brought a note to the back door, and Grace herself happened to be the one to take it in. It would have been less cruel to give her a coal of living fire. The folded paper was soiled, as if it had been passed from hand to hand. Its pencilled words were: \"You or she told Youl be got even with Curs you JOE.\" Grace waited to speak of it until the doctor came. Then her dignity of manner was a revelation to Rosamund, who had yet to discover that elemental passions can sometimes be as silent as the ages that create them. Grace looked unfalteringly at Ogilvie as she spoke. \"Where have they got Joe?\" she asked. Rosamund exclaimed, and motioned to him not to reply; but he was wiser than she. His answer, as simple and direct as her question, gave no evidence of surprise. \"In the city. The jail is stronger there.\" \"Will they let him out?\" \"The evidence may not be enough to hold him. He is awaiting trial.\" \"Will we know if they let him out?\" \"I think so.\" Then she gave him the soiled paper, which he read and passed on to Rosamund. \"He wrote that,\" she said. \"Miss Rose hadn\u0027t ought to be here when he gets out.\" She gave Rosamund a look of agonized tenderness, then left them. Presently they heard her walking in her room upstairs, up and down, up and down. Ogilvie shook his head when Rosamund asked him to go up to her. \"She must work it out alone,\" he said. \"She\u0027s strong enough.\" But Rosamund, uneasy, went to Mother Cary. \"Yes, she\u0027s strong enough,\" the old woman said, when she had heard all about it. \"Land! She\u0027s got to be! An\u0027 she\u0027s jest got to fight it out by herself. Don\u0027t you try to cross her, honey, nor say anything to ease her, \u0027cause that ain\u0027t the way to treat hurts like that. Joe\u0027s her man, an\u0027 she\u0027d lay down her life for him, ef \u0027twas only her own life; an\u0027 I reckon even ef she thought \u0027twould save his soul she couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 found stren\u0027th to tell on him. Yet that\u0027s what he thinks she done! Eh, me! The contrairy fools men like him can be when they sets out!\" \"He\u0027s not worth her caring for! He\u0027s not worth it!\" \"Land, no! I shouldn\u0027t think he was! But that ain\u0027t got a mite to do with it! Women folks don\u0027t care for them they ought to care for, jest because they ought to; nor they don\u0027t stop carin\u0027 when they ought to stop, neither. An\u0027 Joe bein\u0027 her man, she can\u0027t give a thought to whether he\u0027s worth it or not; she\u0027s jest got to go on lovin\u0027 him.\" \"But, oh!\" the girl cried, \"shouldn\u0027t you think his distrust would make her loathe him? To know herself a true and faithful wife, and to be distrusted! Oh!\" Mother Cary\u0027s eyes were very bright as she looked out of the window across the snowy field to where Pap was cutting down a tree for firewood. She took one of Rosamund\u0027s hands in hers before she spoke, and patted it. \"Yes, I reckon distrust must be about one of the hardest things to set down under,\" she said. \"I know somethin\u0027 about it, \u0027cause time was when I distrusted Pap, though \u0027twas before we was married, o\u0027 course. I distrusted Pap\u0027s love, like poor Joe distrusts Grace\u0027s. I thought he couldn\u0027t possibly love me enough to last for ever an\u0027 always, me bein\u0027 crippled up like I be; an\u0027 I thought it wasn\u0027t fair to let him try. So I up an\u0027 run away. I tried to get to the station an\u0027 so back to the city. It was a long ol\u0027 walk for me, an\u0027 I had to hide all one night in a barn. But betwixt walkin\u0027 an\u0027 hobblin\u0027 an\u0027 crawlin\u0027 I got to the station at last; an\u0027 there was Pap a-waitin\u0027 to take me into his arms, which he did then an\u0027 there, good an\u0027 strong. I ain\u0027t never tried to get far from \u0027em sence!\" Rosamund was afraid to break the thread of the story by a question, and the old woman mused a while before she went on. \"I reckon there\u0027s a door o\u0027 distrust that most of us have to open and pass through an\u0027 shet fast behind us, before we get to the place where\u0027s only content, an\u0027 love, an\u0027 trust. It ain\u0027t confined to jest a few; \u0027pears to me most everybody has to go through it.\" Again she paused, while the girl waited. \"When your time comes, honey—an\u0027 I hope it will come, \u0027cause you can\u0027t rightly feel the glory tell you know the shadder—when your time comes to feel distrust, or have it felt against you, jest you do as your Ma Cary tells you! You take a firm holt o\u0027 your heart and your thoughts, an\u0027 don\u0027t you let \u0027em turn all topsy-turvy! You jest take a firm holt on \u0027em an\u0027 wait. WAIT! Don\u0027t run away, like I did; \u0027cause they ain\u0027t any more Pap Carys in the world! It ain\u0027t everybody you\u0027d find ahead of you at the station, waitin\u0027. You jest remember that it ain\u0027t but a door, even though the doorsill does seem dretful wide. It\u0027ll shet behind you, when the right time comes, an\u0027 you\u0027ll find yo\u0027self a-standin\u0027 in the land o\u0027 content. That\u0027s the best dwellin\u0027-place there is, I\u0027m a-tellin\u0027 you!\" Rosamund had not been alone with John Ogilvie since the afternoon, three weeks earlier, when Flood\u0027s automobile interrupted them; but during the interval she was conscious of an uplift of the soul, a new serenity. One of the great memories of her life was of an hour of her childhood when for the first time a revelation of something beyond her childish world was vouchsafed to her. She had been awakened at night by a touch of light upon her face; the full moon shone through her window, and its rays had called her from sleep. In her little bare feet she slipped from bed and went toward the casement, drawn by the moon-magic to look upon the beauty her early bedtime had left undiscovered. Great dark masses of cloud floated across the face of the golden disc, black on the side that hung over the shadowy fields and woods, but shining with a marvelous radiance where the moonlight touched them from above. The child had watched them floating, forming, massing, until they had passed away to the horizon, and left the moon, a floating ship of light, far, far up in the sky, dimming the brilliance of the stars. She had crept back to her little bed with a new sense of things hitherto undreamed of in her childish imaginings, yet never again to be entirely lost—a sense of majesty, of order and immutability, of strange beauty, and of the Greatness that kept watch while she, a little child, safely slumbered. The hour left its mark upon her entire life; and now once more such an impression of security, of beauty, and perhaps of destiny had been laid upon her in the moment when she had faced his soul through John Ogilvie\u0027s eyes. There was no need to hasten further revelation. Indeed, she did not wish for it. She was more than content to rest for a while in the calm of unspoken assurance. It was enough, as much as the hours would hold, until they could grow used to it and expand to the greater glory that was to come. Ogilvie, too, had something of the same sense of uplift. He, too, had had his revelation. But, man-like, he would have grasped at once at something more definite, more dear, if he had not, with a lover\u0027s keenness of intuition, seen that Rosamund was satisfied to wait. He had no fear, no misconception; he felt, rather, a reverence which forbade his hastening her toward the avowal which would bring the surrender he so ardently desired. The same force of love which made him long for it, made him also too tender to urge it. His coming to the brown cottage every day was too much a matter of custom to be remarked upon. There were Eleanor and Grace, Yetta and Timmy to talk to, as well as Rosamund; and he fell into the way of arriving in time for the mid-day dinner, just as Tim fell into the way of waiting for him with the announcement of what good things Aunt Susan was going to give them to eat. Rosamund teased Ogilvie about it a little, but Eleanor, the ostensible hostess, remembered the ancient person with whom he lived, took pity on him, and kept him as often as she could. Indeed, Eleanor, like Mother Cary, regarded him as an overgrown boy, very much in need of maternal attentions; if she suspected the state of affairs between him and Rosamund, she tactfully gave no sign of it. So Ogilvie came and went as naturally as if he were a member of the household, and his daily sight of Rosamund lent him patience. But always he was on the watch for signs of the distrust that still muttered against \"the stranger woman.\" Grace\u0027s taking refuge in the brown house had affected the mountaineers in two ways. One faction—for so strongly did each side feel that there were, indeed, definite factions—held that Rosamund had only offered her the shelter which any woman would have given to another in such sore need, and declared that all of Grace\u0027s friends were bound to Rosamund by the obligation of gratitude. The other faction, and perhaps the larger, held that if Grace had not actually betrayed her husband to the authorities, she had run away from him and so failed in her duty of hiding him, and that Rosamund shared her guilt, if, indeed, she was not directly responsible for it. Mother Cary, whom all adored, came in for a share of blame, for being friends with the guilty ones, and even the doctor, though he was known to be faithfully in sympathy with all his mountain patients, and though no one suspected his integrity toward them, found many faces turned away from him which had hitherto shown only confidence and affection. That Rosamund was aware of the state of things he could only guess; she gallantly denied any uneasiness, although there were many evidences of the bad feeling against her. They were only trivial things, little annoyances, surly answers, eyes that would not see her; yet they told their story with unmistakable plainness. It was while things were in this unsettled state that she was surprised by a second visit from Flood and Pendleton; not, this time, in the car, for the roads were impassable. They drove up in the only sleigh that was for hire at the Summit. Pendleton had hardly got out of his great fur coat before he opened fire; he had evidently come primed. \"What\u0027s all this about arrests and moonshiners, Rosamund?\" he demanded. \"Cecilia\u0027s very uneasy. Had a letter from her day before yesterday, saying she\u0027d come herself if she could do any good, and wouldn\u0027t I run up and look around a bit. So here we are, both of us, because Flood wouldn\u0027t be left behind!\" \"That wasn\u0027t quite fair of Cecilia,\" Rosamund said, flushing angrily. Pendleton had promptly got on her nerves with the alacrity that only an old friend is capable of. \"I thought I had made it plain that I mean to be let alone.\" \"Oh, please!\" Flood, the peacemaker, besought them; and Rosamund had come to like his helpless \"Oh, please!\" so well that she smiled at him, though her eyes were still bright with anger. \"I say, Pendleton,\" he went on, \"you\u0027re always trying to fight with Miss Randall.\" Pendleton only grinned at him. \"Really, Miss Randall, we haven\u0027t come to interfere, not in the very least, I assure you! Mrs. Maxwell did write; but we wanted very much to see you. That is why I came, anyway!\" So far he dared venture, and at the very bathos of his distress Rosamund laughed, and peace reigned again. She told them of Tobet\u0027s arrest, and that his wife was now a member of her household. She declared that there remained no possible danger, with Joe out of the way. Pendleton appealed to Eleanor; and Flood, too, gave her a questioning look. She could not hide her anxiety; but that she was not afraid to admit it gave Flood a feeling of security that he would have missed if she had shown herself, like Rosamund, inclined to deny the danger. For Flood believed that the newspaper accounts of trouble present and to come must be the smoke of some fire; yet he feared only a possible unpleasantness for Rosamund, rather than any actual danger. Ogilvie came in while they were still discussing it. To-day there were no traces of tell-tale emotion to be hidden. He had seen the sleigh before the house, guessed who were within, and now showed himself unaffectedly glad to see Flood. Rosamund inwardly trembled lest Ogilvie should express himself on the subject of the mountaineers\u0027 suspicions; she could not know that a look, passed between himself and Flood, was enough to set Flood on the alert. She talked feverishly while they were at dinner, and her heart sank when, afterwards, Pendleton announced that he was hit with an idea. He was standing at the window, taking in the white sweeps and stretches of snow, the black trunks of the leafless trees, the dark pyramids of the spruces, the more distant shadow of pines. \"Jove!\" he cried. \"Just look at those slopes for skiing and tobogganing! It\u0027s better than Davos!\" Then he turned from the window, his hands deep in his pockets, and stood in front of Rosamund, his head on one side, tipping backward and forward from heels to toes. \"I say, Rosy,\" he said, \"the best way you can convince us, and poor dear Cecilia, that you are safe up here is to let us stay for a while and see for ourselves!\" Rosamund flushed; he was so wilfully provoking. \"Marshall! How can you? You know very well I can\u0027t have two men in my house! Why do you want to make me appear so inhospitable?\" Flood, too, looked as if he would like to express himself forcibly. \"Oh, I say, Pendleton——\" he began. But Ogilvie, apparently, saw something of good in the suggestion. \"That\u0027s a capital idea, Mr. Pendleton,\" he said. \"Stay up here a while, and see for yourselves. I\u0027ll be very glad to put you up, if Mrs. Reeves will invite us over to dinner once in a while! My landlady isn\u0027t much of a chef!\" Flood had turned to him quickly, with a keen look of questioning. \"Could you really, old man?\" he asked. \"Bully!\" Pendleton cried, grinning at Rosamund. \"Bet I can beat you in a snow fight, Rose!\" But Rosamund, biting her lip in dismay, would not look at him. \"I can snow-fight!\" Tim announced. \"I know how to make a snow man, too! My muvver showed me!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77556.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
