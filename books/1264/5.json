{"id":22308,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Perhaps, if the events of the next few hours had come to pass at any other time, they would not have left the same mark upon her life. As it was, Rosamund had come to that state of moral restlessness which is bound either to open the windows of the soul to fresher air and wider fields of vision, or else to induce the peevish discontent which so often falls to the lot of the idle woman. Although she consciously longed for happiness, she knew that she was not sentimentally unhappy; neither was she fatuously so, like her sister. Cecilia was only one of many women of her age and class, who imagine that possession brings enjoyment. She often declared that if she had as much as her acquaintances she could make herself content, but that if she had more than they she could be supremely happy. Rosamund had no such illusions; her clear mind had never been perverted to the futility of such ambitions, although there was nothing in her environment to suggest a satisfying substitute for them. If she was restless, it was not for something she might not have. It pleased her pride to think that she valued neither wealth nor social eminence, but accepted them only as her birthright; but, as in the case of the infatuated Flood, she resented any sign of invasion upon the sacred precincts which for generations had respected their Berkleys and their Stanfields and Randalls. It was her pride which had induced her to neglect, as unimportant, the things Cecilia yearned for; Rosamund Randall was to be above manifestations of wealth—although Rosamund Randall was not above occasional haughty stubbornness. The charitable pastimes in which some of her friends indulged held no appeal for her; she was too impatient for immediate results to be successful in them. She vaguely felt that some fault must lie with the unfortunate, and she could not imagine that the individual might be interesting. Even Eleanor\u0027s experience, although it had stirred her heart to pity, brought her no closer to the mass of suffering. She had no particular talents, no pet enthusiasms; yet her intelligence was too keen to be satisfied with the round of days that constituted life for Cecilia, as well as for most of their friends. Nothing suggested itself as a substitute for them, and to-day not even the charms of nature satisfied her, however beautiful the country through which the big car carried them. But insensibly it made its effect upon her. Away from the scars of battle, through orchard and grass-land, between fields of ripening corn and pastures where drowsy cattle were ruminating in shady fence-corners; past little white farmhouses with red barns at their backs, and tangled gardens where bees feasted in front of them; up towards the hills, through stretches of cool woodland, where little spring-fed brooklets crossed the road, and where the turns were so narrow that the call of the horn had often to pierce the stillness; out again upon cleared spaces, and at last far up on the mountain-tops—so they traveled, Rosamund alone seeming to notice the beauties they passed so swiftly. Cecilia kept up an easy chatter with the two men. Flood seemingly had eyes for the older woman only, yet he was keenly aware of the girl beside him. All the way he was inwardly cursing himself for the ill-timed compliment which had silenced her, and he was too good a judge of human nature to follow his first mistake with a second. If Rosamund wished to be silent, no interruption to her revery should come from him, at least. As there was only the one way across the mountains, Pendleton had put away his road map and was leaning sideways over the back of the seat, facing Cecilia and Flood; the three found plenty to talk about, and ignored Rosamund\u0027s pensive withdrawal. For miles they had passed no living thing; even the birds and woodland creatures seemed to have gone to sleep; and the chauffeur, taking them along at second speed, believed it unnecessary to sound his horn at every winding of the road. Then, so suddenly that no one knew just what had happened, there was a shriek from somewhere, a wild cry from the man at the wheel, a stopping of the car so quickly as to throw the women forward and Flood to his knees. Pendleton, facing back, was the only one who could see the road behind them; with a cry that was either oath or prayer, he leaped from the car and ran back, the chauffeur scarcely four yards behind him. Flood scrambled up and Rosamund sprang to her feet. Cecilia covered her ears with her hands, and was the only one who could voice her horror. \"We have killed someone!\" she cried wildly, crouching down to shut out sight as well as sound. \"We have killed someone! Oh, what shall we do? What shall we do? I cannot see it—I cannot stand the sight of it!\" But no one heeded her outcry. Flood had opened the door and was speeding after the others; and Rosamund, too, as quickly as her trembling would allow her, ran towards the little group at the roadside. When she reached them, they were bending over two forms—a boy and a young girl. The boy had been struck by the step of the car, and lay huddled where its force had thrown him; the girl lay beside him, her face down in the weeds and grass. Pendleton and the chauffeur, with ghastly faces, were feeling for her heart. As Rosamund came up they turned her upon her back. Rosamund tore off her gloves, and pressed her hand against the girl\u0027s throat. \"I think she has only fainted,\" she said. \"Get a cold thermos bottle, someone!\" The chauffeur ran to do her bidding, but before he got back the girl had opened her eyes. Rosamund bent closer. \"Are you hurt?\" she asked. \"Did we hit you? Can you speak to me?\" But the girl could not answer at first; then the iced water and something from Flood\u0027s pocket flask revived her, and she sat up, leaning against Rosamund. \"Gee!\" she said. \"I was scared! What d\u0027yer think of an automobile up here! Where\u0027s Tim?\" The men had left the girl to Rosamund, and were kneeling by the child; Rosamund glanced over her shoulder at them. \"I\u0027m afraid he is hurt,\" she said. \"Do you think you can take care of yourself for a moment while I see? I wouldn\u0027t try to stand up quite yet, if I were you.\" \"Oh, sure,\" the girl replied. \"They ain\u0027t anything the matter with me. You go right on.\" But all of Rosamund\u0027s ministrations failed of any response from the boy. Flood\u0027s varied experience had given him a passing acquaintance with broken bones, but he could find none in the little limbs that were thin to emaciation; his search revealed only a few scratches on the child\u0027s face, and a cut on his head. At last he looked across the little form at Rosamund. \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s concussion,\" he said. \"We shall have to take him to a doctor.\" The girl had risen, and was standing, with arms akimbo, looking down at them. \"Doctor Ogilvie,\" she said at once. \"He\u0027s the one. He\u0027s right over at the Summit.\" Flood looked quickly at Rosamund. \"Ogilvie! I had no idea his territory extended this far!\" Then he turned to the girl. \"So you know Doctor Ogilvie? How far are we from the Summit?\" \"Gee! I dunno! It\u0027s awful far to walk it, I know that!\" Rosamund looked up with troubled eyes. \"There must be some house near by,\" she said, \"where we could take him. I don\u0027t believe he ought to be carried very far. Do you live near here?\" she asked the girl. \"Laws, no! We live in the city, him an\u0027 me. We ain\u0027t any kin, y\u0027understand; he\u0027s a tubercler, an\u0027 my eyes give out, and we\u0027re just visitin\u0027 Mother Cary.\" Flood was becoming impatient. \"Well, where does the Cary woman live?\" he demanded. \"We don\u0027t need your family history, my girl.\" Instantly the girl\u0027s black eyes flashed, and her chin went up. \"Well, an\u0027 you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to get it, my man!\" she returned. \"I know the likes of you; seen you by the million!\" She glared up at him belligerently, but Rosamund laid her hand on her shoulder. \"Don\u0027t,\" she said quietly. \"Where is this place where you\u0027re staying?\" \"It\u0027s just back of the woods there. The road\u0027s on up a piece, about two squares; yer can\u0027t miss it, \u0027cause it\u0027s the only one there is.\" So they lifted the child, and laid him carefully, on the broad back seat. They decided that Mrs. Maxwell and Pendleton should wait beside the road, while Rosamund and Flood saw to the boy\u0027s safety, and the girl rode with the chauffeur to point the way. She seemed but little impressed by the accident, and greatly pleased at the motor ride. \"Laws, but I wish the girls at the factory could see Yetta Weise settin\u0027 up here,\" she remarked as she took her place. As she had told them, the house was not far; and notwithstanding her anxiety for the injured boy, Rosamund looked at it in amazement, so unlike was it to anything she had ever seen, so quaintly pretty, so tidy, so homelike. It stood on the hillside, a few yards back from the road. From a little red gate set in the middle of the whitest of tiny fences a narrow brick path led straight to the front door. The upper story of the house overhung the lower, making a shady space beneath that was paved with bricks and made cheery and comfortable with wooden benches piled with crocks and bright tin milk pans set out to air; and all about the little white farm-buildings wound narrow brick paths bordered with flowers—geraniums, nasturtiums, pansies, with, here and there, groups of house plants in tin cans and earthen pots, set outside for their summer holiday. Unaccustomed though she was to such ingenuous simplicity of decoration, Rosamund could not but recognize it as a haven of peace, a little home where love and time had impressed their indelible marks of beauty. The big car drew up to the gate very gently; Yetta called, loudly and shrilly; Flood lifted the boy and carried him towards the house, and Rosamund followed; but halfway up the path she paused, half in amazement, half in repulsion. Yetta\u0027s call had brought to the doorway the strangest of small creatures—a tiny, bent old woman. She braced herself on one side against the doorway, on the other with a queer little crutch with padded top, held by a strap across her shoulder; as she came forward to meet them she moved the crutch, like some strange crab, obliquely, grotesquely, yet with the adeptness of the life-long cripple. She was evidently startled, even frightened; but when her eyes met Rosamund\u0027s she smiled. At once the girl\u0027s feeling of repulsion vanished, for on the tiny old face there was none of the suffering and regret that so often mark the deformed. It was not drawn or heavy; plain and homely though it was, it was made radiant by a world-embracing mother-love, transfigured by that quality of tenderness and sweetness that Rosamund had learned to associate with pictured medi?val saints and martyrs. With Mother Cary\u0027s first smile, something entered the girl\u0027s consciousness which never again left it. The old woman paid no attention to Yetta\u0027s voluble explanations, nor wasted any time on questions. \"Take him into the room on the left and lay him on the sofy,\" she directed, and hobbled along behind the little procession; but when they had lain the still unconscious child in the shaded best room, she looked from Flood to Rosamund for explanation, with a dignity which could not fail to impress them. \"Maybe he\u0027s just been knocked senseless,\" she said, when they had told her all they could. \"But anyways, we ought to have Doctor Ogilvie here\u0027s soon as ever we can. If the young lady\u0027ll help me undress the little feller, you can take Yetta, sir, to show you the way.\" Flood hesitated; to undress the child would be a strange task for Rosamund. \"Can\u0027t I do that before we go?\" he asked. But the old woman had no such hesitation. \"No, you can\u0027t,\" she said, \"an\u0027 I wish you\u0027d hurry. Timmy ain\u0027t strong, anyway.\" So, with a troubled look, Flood followed Yetta, and in a moment Rosamund heard the purr of the motor as the car sped off towards the Summit; then, as she afterwards remembered with surprise and wonder, she found herself obeying the old woman\u0027s directions. \"Now, honey, you jest lift the little feller right up in your arms, bein\u0027 careful of his head; he don\u0027t weigh no more\u0027n a picked chicken. We\u0027ll get him to bed time the doctor gets here, an\u0027 have some water b\u0027ilin\u0027 an\u0027 some ice brought in, case he wants either one. Here, right in here—my house is mostly all on one floor, so\u0027s I can manage to scramble around in it when Pap\u0027s in the fields. That\u0027s the way—no, he won\u0027t need a piller. I\u0027ll take off his little clo\u0027es whilst you lift him—that\u0027s right. My! Think o\u0027 that gentleman wantin\u0027 to do for him—as if any woman with a heart in her body could let a man handle sech a little thing\u0027s this! But he didn\u0027t know, did he, honey?\" And strangely enough Rosamund was conscious of a wave of tenderness towards the pathetic little figure, limp and emaciated; long afterwards she realized that people always did and felt what Mother Cary expected them to. She even bathed the little dusty feet, while the old woman hobbled about to bring her different things, talking all the while. \"Pore little soul, seems like he had enough without this—not but what I reckon he\u0027ll come out o\u0027 this a heap sight easier than he will the other. Not a soul on the top o\u0027 the yearth to belong to, he hasn\u0027t; sent here to fatten up an\u0027 live out o\u0027 doors, \u0027count o\u0027 being a tubercler. No, honey, he ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to Pap an\u0027 me \u0027ceptin\u0027 jest one o\u0027 the pore little lambs that have a right to any spare love an\u0027 shelter an\u0027 cuddlin\u0027 that\u0027s layin\u0027 around the world waitin\u0027 for sech as him. I used to wonder why the Lord let sech pore little things stay in the world, until I found out how much good they do to folks that look after \u0027em. Land! I wouldn\u0027t be without one of \u0027em on my hands now, not for more\u0027n I can say. What? Oh, yes, dearie, I take one or more of \u0027em and build \u0027em up an\u0027 get \u0027em well, with Doctor Ogilvie\u0027s tellin\u0027 me how; an\u0027 when they go back to the city all well again, I jest take one or two more. Pap an\u0027 me wouldn\u0027t know what to do now, ef we didn\u0027t have some pore little thing to look after. I\u0027m jest that selfish, I begrudge everybody else that has a bigger house the room they got for more of \u0027em.\" When the child had been made clean and cool, and the old woman had shown Rosamund how to draw in the blinds and leave the room in pleasant shadow, she led the way out to the paved place in front of the house. \"You look all tuckered out, honey,\" she said, when Rosamund had sunk wearily into a rush-seated armchair, \"an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to get you some fresh milk.\" So for a few minutes the girl was alone, with time to think over the crowding events of the past half hour, which seemed almost like a day. One emotion had come closely upon another, and now she was in this strange little harbor where, apparently, only kind winds blew, the storms of the world outside, a harbor where weak vessels found repair, where passers-by were welcomed and supplied with strength to go on. Subconsciously she wondered whether it might not be the harbor of a new, fair land, herself the storm-buffeted traveler about to find shelter. Then, more in weariness of spirit than in bodily fatigue, she drew the long hatpin from her hat and tossed it aside, leaning her head back against the stone of the house, and closed her eyes. When Mother Cary returned with a glass of creamy milk, she noted the girl\u0027s pallor, the shadows her long lashes cast on her white cheeks. \"I wouldn\u0027t feel too bad about it,\" she said. \"The little feller can\u0027t be hurt very bad, and I reckon it was jest bein\u0027 so scared an\u0027 so weak, anyway, that made him go off in his head like that.\" Rosamund could not confess that her thoughts had been of herself rather than upon the injured child. \"Do you think he will recover?\" she asked. \"Well, what Doctor Ogilvie can\u0027t do ain\u0027t to be done, I know that much,\" Mother Cary replied. \"Folks do say it\u0027s an ill wind blows nobody any good, an\u0027 it cert\u0027n\u0027y was his ill wind blew us good; \u0027cause if he hadn\u0027t been that sick he couldn\u0027t live in the city, he never would \u0027a\u0027 come to the mountings, an\u0027 I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t see how we ever did get along without him. Why, he\u0027s that good a doctor folks still come up here from the city to see him; and many\u0027s the one stays at the Summit just to be where he can look after them; and Widder Speers that he lives with told me that doctors from \u0027way off send for him to talk over sick people with them—jest to ask him what to do, like. Oh, Doctor Ogilvie can do anything anybody can!\" Rosamund was amused, in spite of herself, at the old woman\u0027s na?veté. \"He was sick, then, when he came?\" she asked, idly. \"Yes, but you\u0027d never \u0027a\u0027 known it,\" Mother Cary told her. \"Land! How he did get about from place to place, huntin\u0027 out other folks that was ailin\u0027! He hadn\u0027t been up here more\u0027n a month before he knew every soul in these mountings, which is more\u0027n I do, though I\u0027ve lived here forty year an\u0027 more. He jest took right a holt, as you might say. That\u0027s how come I begun to take care of these pore little helpless city things. \"First time he come here, he looked all about the place when he was leavin\u0027, an\u0027 he says to Pap, \u0027Plenty o\u0027 good room an\u0027 good air you got here, an\u0027 I guess there\u0027s plenty o\u0027 good food, too, ain\u0027t there?\u0027 Pap, he says, \u0027Well, we manage to make out, when the ol\u0027 lady feels like cookin\u0027!\u0027 An\u0027 the doctor laughs an\u0027 says to me, \u0027Ain\u0027t got quite as much to do as ye had when that son an\u0027 daughter o\u0027 yours were home here, have ye? Don\u0027t ye miss \u0027em?\u0027 At that the tears jest come to my eyes, like they always do whenever I think o\u0027 my own child\u0027en bein\u0027 two or three miles away from me on farms o\u0027 their own; an\u0027 the doctor he smiles an\u0027 says, \u0027Well, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to supply your want,\u0027 he says. \"Pap an\u0027 me never thought \u0027ny more about it tell a week or so later when we see him drive up behind that old white horse o\u0027 his with the puniest little boy alongside o\u0027 him ever I set my two eyes on. \u0027Here\u0027s something to keep you from bein\u0027 lonesome, Mis\u0027 Cary,\u0027 he says; an\u0027 ever since then, it bein\u0027 goin\u0027 on five year, I\u0027ve had one or another o\u0027 them pore little—land! There he comes now, without a sign of a hat on his red head! Ef he ain\u0027t that forgetful!\" Flood\u0027s big car had whirled rapidly into sight along the woodland road, and before it stopped the doctor was out and into the house. When Mother Cary hobbled in, Rosamund remaining to say a word or two to Flood, the doctor was already bending over the injured child. Cecilia was waving a frantic hand from the car, and Rosamund and Flood walked down the little path to the red gate. \"Where is your hat?\" was the first thing Mrs. Maxwell asked Rosamund. \"Do get in! We\u0027ve miles and miles to go, and we\u0027ve wasted hours! I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t see why they couldn\u0027t have sent for the doctor in the ordinary way; why, the road back there was something terrible!\" Rosamund was conscious of an absurd longing to slap or pinch Cecilia; she was really too vapid for polite endurance. \"We can\u0027t possibly leave until we know how badly hurt the child is,\" she said, and deliberately turned and walked back into the cottage. After a moment or two Flood followed her, leaving Cecilia to pour out her indignation upon Pendleton. The doctor was just coming out of the little bedroom, and nodded to them both in a general way. Rosamund looked at him curiously. She noted with some amusement that his hair was, as Mother Cary had somewhat more than suggested, frankly red; not even the best-intentioned politeness could have called it sandy. He was of average height, with keen eyes which looked black, although she afterwards knew them to be gray; his breadth of shoulder made him seem less tall than he was, and his frame was rather lightly covered, although his very evident restless energy seemed more responsible for it than any evidence of ill-health. \"Must have jabbed his ribs,\" he said, looking at Flood with a half smile, and seemingly ignoring the presence of this girl from his old familiar world. \"Cracked a couple of them, but they\u0027re soon mended in a kiddie. Only thing now is this slight concussion; needs careful nursing for a few days.\" Then he turned, looked squarely into Rosamund\u0027s face, and issued his orders in precisely the manner of a doctor to a nurse, without a trace of hesitation, apparently without a shadow of doubt that she would obey. \"Keep ice on his head, you know, and watch him every minute through the night. He\u0027s not likely to move; but if he should become conscious——\" He continued his directions carefully, explicitly, all the while looking at Rosamund intently, as if to impress them upon her. While he was speaking, Flood\u0027s face flushed darkly. With the doctor\u0027s last phrase, \"Only be sure to watch him every minute,\" he spoke sharply. \"You are making a mistake, Doctor Ogilvie,\" he said. \"Miss Randall is not a nurse.\" The doctor instantly replied, \"I know she isn\u0027t, but we\u0027ll have to do the best we can with her!\" Flood\u0027s face grew redder still; Rosamund smiled a little. \"Miss Randall cannot possibly stay here,\" Flood said. \"That is entirely out of the question. I am willing to do all I can for the child, and I am very glad he is not seriously hurt, although the accident was, I think, unavoidable. I will send a nurse to-morrow—two, if you want them. But you will have to get along with the help here for to-night.\" \"Haven\u0027t any,\" said the doctor, briefly. \"Yetta\u0027s a child, and Mother Cary goes down to her daughter\u0027s where there\u0027s a new baby.\" For a moment no one spoke. Mother Cary was smiling at Rosamund, and her look drew the girl\u0027s from the two men. Then her smile answered the old woman\u0027s. In a flash of inspiration she knew that she had found an answer to her questions of the earlier hours; something in her heart drew her symbolically toward the little silent, helpless child in the darkened room behind her, some mother-feeling as new and wonderful as the dawn of life. Both Flood and the doctor remembered, through all their lives, the look of exaltation on her face when she spoke. \"I will stay,\" she said, quietly, and walked into the darkened room.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77545.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
