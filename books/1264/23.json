{"id":22326,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"During the first week of Ogilvie\u0027s illness Rosamund went once or twice to the house at the Summit where he lay. Doctor Blake had heard the story of the fire, and in the deliberate courtesy of his manner Rosamund suspected a veiled distrust; she imagined that he was wondering, whenever he looked at her, what manner of woman it was for whom Ogilvie had risked his life, and whether she were worthy of his possible sacrifice. She told herself that she would have felt the same, in his place; while, in her humility, she secretly reiterated her own unworthiness. But she knew herself guiltless of actual blame or wrong-doing, and found it hard to endure Doctor Blake\u0027s scrutiny, which seemed both to accuse and weigh and find wanting. Yet even that was easier to bear than the tolerant manner of the young woman in the white dress and coquettish cap, who came out of Ogilvie\u0027s room to assure her, with the tolerant air that seems to be an attribute of street-car conductors, policemen and trained nurses, that there was really no immediate prospect of change in the patient\u0027s condition, as pneumonia had to run its definite course. For all the longing of her heart, and for all the courage with which she started out, Rosamund allowed herself to be snubbed into retreat. Mother Cary alone braved the authoritative one whenever she pleased, or whenever Pap would take her across the valley; and it was on the ninth night after the fire that she did what Rosamund and Ogilvie always declared to be the most merciful and courageous act of all her beautiful life. \"Now,\" she said, after supper, when Pap had gone out to the barn to harness the horse for his nightly pilgrimage, \"Now, honey, this bein\u0027 the night when he\u0027ll come to, or—when he\u0027ll come to, surely—don\u0027t you think he ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to come to, \u0027cause he is—and you\u0027re goin\u0027 over with Pap to be there!\" Rosamund rose from her place beside the table, her hands clasped against her heart, pale, then flushed, then pale again. Mother Cary looked up at her. \"Darlin\u0027, come here to yo\u0027 Ma Cary,\" she said, and, when the girl knelt beside her, she put her arms about her and laid her withered, soft old cheek against Rosamund\u0027s hair. \"Honey,\" she said, \"Ma Cary knows how you\u0027re feelin\u0027! You\u0027re a young maid, an\u0027 by words unasked; but he\u0027s your man, an\u0027 you\u0027re his woman, in the sight o\u0027 God and the knowledge o\u0027 your own hearts. Ain\u0027t it so? Yes—but don\u0027t cry, my lamb! Don\u0027t cry like that! This ain\u0027t the time to cry. Look at me, dearie! That\u0027s right! Well, I didn\u0027t tell you to go, before to-night, because I knew \u0027twasn\u0027t for the best; but now your place is over there, alongside o\u0027 him. Let him open his eyes on you, ef so be it he is to open them knowin\u0027ly in this world again. An\u0027 ef he ain\u0027t to be permitted to do that—then, my lamb, it\u0027s for you to be there to close \u0027em. There! That\u0027s right! Put it all back—grief keeps, an\u0027 maybe you won\u0027t need it, after all. Sho\u0027! Hyear me talkin\u0027! Why, I jest downright know you won\u0027t need it!\" Rosamund lifted her white, white face. \"But——\" she began. \"I know what you\u0027re thinkin\u0027,\" Mother Cary said. \"I once thought that a way, too, befo\u0027 Pap made me see what was right. Put all sech doubts away from you. Your love an\u0027 his love are worth more than that. Look Ma Cary in the face, lamb, an\u0027 tell me—ain\u0027t they? There, there, now don\u0027t let the tears rise up again. You ain\u0027t got time for tears to-night.\" \"But the nurse—Doctor Blake—what will they—Oh, how can I?\" \"It\u0027ll be all right with Doctor Blake. He knows you\u0027re comin\u0027! An\u0027 as for the nurse, she\u0027s a paid hirelin\u0027, and you\u0027re his woman. Jest you bear that in mind, honey—hurry, there\u0027s Pap\u0027s wheels!\" So it came to pass, in that critical hour before dawn when souls so often waver upon the threshold of life, when John Ogilvie\u0027s breathing became less labored and his eyes opened—tired, to be sure, but with unmistakable consciousness in them—it was Rosamund who was bending over him, while the strange woman in the white gown and cap looked at him, felt his pulse, smiled as if satisfied, and went out and closed the door behind her. It was Rosamund whose eyes smiled into his with the pitiful, brave effort of trying to make believe that there had never been any danger at all to frighten her. His hand moved toward her, his lips formed her name; and it was Rosamund\u0027s warm palm which closed over his hand, and her cheek which rested against his as he went to sleep. \"It was Rosamund whose eyes smiled into his.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77563.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
