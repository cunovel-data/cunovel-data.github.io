{"id":22325,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"Fortunately for Rosamund the succeeding days were so busy that she had but little time to be alone with her thoughts of Ogilvie. The morning after Grace\u0027s departure, Father Cary had come home with disquieting news. Pneumonia had set in; but Doctor Blake would stay at the Summit until the crisis was passed, and he had sent for another nurse—the one who was at the head of his own private hospital, Pap proudly told Rosamund in a pitying attempt at reassuring her. She had, first of all, to make some arrangement for Yetta. Cecilia rose to the occasion and found the suitable governess, who proved to be an elderly woman to whom Yetta took an immediate liking. Miss Gates had been something of a singer in her day, and she had a family of nieces and nephews that she was helping to bring up, all of whom were musical. She took Yetta with her to stay at their house until other plans could be made. Cecilia had, indeed, shown energy and good judgment, and something more; she sailed for the Mediterranean to join the Whartons at Algiers only after she saw Yetta installed in the Gates home—having been so good-natured as to let the yacht go without her in order to do so. Matt and Aunt Sue were sent back to Georgia. Secretly they were quite reconciled to going, for they were to stop in Baltimore and replace their burned wardrobes with entire new ones, with which they looked forward to dazzling their friends in Augusta; but Sue felt obliged to use the prerogative of the negro servant to make a grumbling protest. \"I suttinly wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 journeyed \u0027way up to dis yer Gord-fo\u0027saken corner ob de yearth,\" she declared to Rosamund, \"whar dey ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a passel o\u0027 Yankee white trash, ef I had \u0027a\u0027 known I was a goin\u0027 to see my best Paisley shawl what Miss Lucy done give me when she was ma\u0027ied bu\u0027nt up wid flames befo\u0027 my ve\u0027y eyes. Et don\u0027 do nobody no good traipsin\u0027 aroun\u0027 dis yer way, nohow. You better come along back home wid yer Aunt Susan, whar you b\u0027longs at, chile.\" After they left, the routine of life was simple enough; yet the days were laden with what anxiety, what care, what fears, and trembling hopes! Yet living as she was on news from the doctor\u0027s house, Rosamund was not altogether oblivious of what was passing in the hearts of her friends. She went every morning to the Tobet cottage, sometimes with Eleanor, sometimes alone. For several days Grace watched and waited for one who did not come. But at last Rosamund made a suggestion, which in a day or two brought its return. \"You know the little boy who brought that note to us at the brown house, last fall,\" she said to Grace. \"Why not give him a note to Joe?\" \"What to say?\" Grace asked. \"That whatever happens, no one shall suspect him. Tell him you have my word, and Mother Cary\u0027s, for that.\" \"I\u0027d be afraid to write words like those,\" Grace said. \"They might go to the wrong one—and then no need to tell!\" \"Then say them over to the boy, and make him remember them,\" said Rosamund; and that was the advice which Grace, in the desperate necessity of her heart, followed. A few mornings afterward, when Rosamund came in sight of the cottage, Joe was leaning against the door. He went inside when he saw her, and Rosamund turned back. She told herself that in Grace\u0027s place she would want no visitors for a while. But she had not gone far before Grace came hastening after her. She threw her arms about Rosamund\u0027s neck. \"I got my man back,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m prayin\u0027 every minute to the good Lord, Miss Rose, that you\u0027ll get yours back, too, all safe an\u0027 sound.\" But the secret of Eleanor\u0027s heart was not so readily disclosed, although Rosamund suspected, from the number of telegrams and letters that were coming, and from Eleanor\u0027s frequent look of abstraction, that she was beginning to have a good deal to think about. But how far matters had progressed, she did not suspect; for Eleanor\u0027s heart was troubled as it had never been, and she would not add to Rosamund\u0027s burden of care by confiding her own. That she was suffering could not escape the keen eyes of Mother Cary, however. \"Ain\u0027t you troubled about somethin\u0027, dearie?\" the old woman asked, one day when Rosamund and Tim were out of doors, and dinner was cooking, and they two were alone. Eleanor looked at her dumbly; a quiver passed over her face, seeming to leave it whiter than ever. \"Land!\" said Mother Cary. \"Don\u0027t look that a way, honey! No wonder little Timmy used to call you \u0027White Lady\u0027!\" She seated herself in the little chair with the legs that Father Cary had sawed off to suit her, and drew another up beside it. \"Now you come set down here by your Ma Cary, lamb, an\u0027 tell me what\u0027s the matter.\" Eleanor seated herself, and put her hand on the old woman\u0027s lap. \"I am in trouble, Mother Cary,\" she said. \"But it cannot do any good to talk about it.\" \"Well, it cert\u0027n\u0027y don\u0027t do one mite o\u0027 good to let it eat in, dearie. It don\u0027t make you die any sooner, much as you\u0027d like to sometimes, when trouble is real bad; it don\u0027t make you forget; nor it don\u0027t show you any way out. It jest makes the way seem longer.\" \"That is true,\" Eleanor said. Then she pondered for a while. Presently she asked, \"Do you remember Mr. Flood, Mother Cary?\" \"The rich gentleman that run over Timmy? Yes, lamb, I always remember them I like.\" Eleanor smiled. \"He did run over Timmy, didn\u0027t he? Or run into him! So indirectly I owe him my precious baby!\" \"And now he wants you to pay him?\" the old woman asked. \"Put it that way!\" Eleanor replied. \"But I cannot pay him, Mother Cary—not as he wants me to! I—I may become blind, some day.\" Mother Cary\u0027s hand tightened over hers. \"Ain\u0027t your poor eyes any better?\" she asked. \"Yes. Oh, yes, they are better. But I am afraid. Think of burdening a man with a blind wife! And—and he is such a splendid man, Mother Cary! He deserves the very best.\" \"I ain\u0027t doubtin\u0027 it. He\u0027s John Ogilvie\u0027s friend, and that\u0027s enough to satisfy me that he\u0027s worth a good deal.\" They sat in silence for a while; then Mother Cary said, \"Darlin\u0027, I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to tell you a little story. I ain\u0027t takin\u0027 it on me to advise you; but I jest want to tell you how, though you wouldn\u0027t guess it, maybe, I was once in the same kind of a shadder you be in now.\" \"Do tell me,\" Eleanor said. \"Well, when I was a little girl, lamb, I fell an\u0027 hurt my back, an\u0027 when I got better, two or three years afterward, I couldn\u0027t do nothin\u0027 but scrabble aroun\u0027, not even as good as I can now. An\u0027 I growed all crooked. It didn\u0027t make much difference for a while, I was that glad to be movin\u0027 at all. But as I growed up an\u0027 the other girls began to go places, an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t an\u0027 wasn\u0027t asked to, it did seem to me I jest couldn\u0027t live at all. There wasn\u0027t anythin\u0027 to look for\u0027ard to. Then my father died, an\u0027 I went into the tin shop. \"It wasn\u0027t nice work, an\u0027 the big machines like to scared me to death at first, \u0027n I got cut, \u0027n once one o\u0027 the girls near me got some of her fingers cut off. In winter I had to go before light in the mornin\u0027 an\u0027 stay workin\u0027 till long after dark. Then I had sech a cough, an\u0027 one spring I had to quit work. The doctor, he asked me if I hadn\u0027t any kin in the country, an\u0027 I not knowin\u0027 what he was aimin\u0027 at told him I didn\u0027t know o\u0027 none \u0027xcept Ma\u0027s own aunt \u0027t I\u0027d never seen nor wrote to. \"Unbeknownst to me the doctor he wrote up here an\u0027 found out \u0027t Aunt Marthy was a-keepin\u0027 house for her husband\u0027s nephew, an\u0027 she wrote back \u0027t I was to come up an\u0027 spend the summer in the mountains. I cried at first, for I hadn\u0027t ever seen the country an\u0027 I didn\u0027t know Aunt Marthy, an\u0027 I was jest afeared to come. But the doctor he put me on the train, an\u0027 when I got to the station over there it was most dark—\u0027bout as dark as it is now, I guess. There was a man on the platform, \u0027n I thought he was the biggest man I\u0027d ever seen. When he come up to me he said, \u0027Why, you are a little mite! Guess they haven\u0027t been feedin\u0027 you much where you come from.\u0027 He had a big quilt in the wagon, an\u0027 he jest wrapped me all up in it an\u0027 lifted me in like I was a baby. I was that tired an\u0027 scared, an\u0027 I hadn\u0027t ever been taken keer of before, an\u0027 I jest up an\u0027 cried. He didn\u0027t ask me what was the matter, but he jest laughed at me an\u0027 made fun o\u0027 me, an\u0027 said if I acted like a baby he\u0027d treat me like one, \u0027n he patted my hand, \u0027n tucked me all up, \u0027n talked to me all the way home. When Aunt Marthy met us at the door an\u0027 he carried me in the house in his arms, he said to her, \u0027Well, now, Aunt Marthy,\u0027 he said, \u0027we\u0027ve jest got a baby to keer for, an\u0027 I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to help you do it.\u0027 An\u0027, honey, there hasn\u0027t been a day sence then that he hasn\u0027t taken keer o\u0027 me. \"There never was a summer like that one; seems like I never had been alive before. I never knew before how spring come, but I found out that year, Jim showin\u0027 me the first bluebirds an\u0027 bringin\u0027 in flowers. I jest thought he was next to God A\u0027mighty, honey, an\u0027 I never once give a thought to me bein\u0027 a woman an\u0027 he bein\u0027 a man. I hadn\u0027t never had none o\u0027 the good times girls have, an\u0027 I guess I had come to forget I was a girl. By the time end o\u0027 summer come, Jim had gotten in the way o\u0027 carryin\u0027 me out with him everywheres, out to the barn, out to the wood-lot, out to the fields where he was a-workin\u0027. I had grown strong enough to get aroun\u0027 like I do now, but Jim jest carried me \u0027roun\u0027 like he\u0027d done that first night, an\u0027 Aunt Marthy \u0027n he wouldn\u0027t let me do a mite o\u0027 work. \"Then, when I\u0027d got real well, I said somethin\u0027 one night about goin\u0027 back to the factory. We was at supper, an\u0027 Jim he jest put down his knife an\u0027 looked at me a minute. Aunt Marthy reached over an\u0027 put her hand over his, an\u0027 then he got up an\u0027 went out. I was that scared, not knowin\u0027 what I\u0027d done, an\u0027 Aunt Marthy told me I\u0027d better go out an\u0027 find him. \"So I up an\u0027 followed him, an\u0027 he was a-standin\u0027 outside, lookin\u0027 so big against that yaller sky, an\u0027 straight an\u0027 tall with his arms folded on his chest, a-frownin\u0027, with his lips drawn in like he does when somethin\u0027s upset him right smart. \"I touched him on the arm an\u0027 said, \u0027Jim!\u0027 an\u0027 with that he turned him right aroun\u0027 quick. \"An\u0027 then, after a bit, he set me down an\u0027 held on to my hands, an\u0027 told me how he wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to let me go back to the city any more, \u0027n how it was goin\u0027 to be. I told him I wasn\u0027t fit for him, bein\u0027 crooked, an\u0027 he jest laughed at me an\u0027 fixed it all his way, \u0027n called Aunt Marthy out \u0027n told her. She laughed at him an\u0027 told him he was more of a baby \u0027n I ever was. He always was that bright an\u0027 willful, an\u0027 he didn\u0027t give me a chance to say anything. But the more he talked, the more I found I loved him, an\u0027 the more I loved him the harder I made up my mind \u0027t he shouldn\u0027t tie himself to a cripple. \"So that night when they was asleep, I got up an\u0027 took the money I had for my ticket home, an\u0027 I started to walk to the station. You know how far that is. By time mornin\u0027 come I wasn\u0027t halfway. I went into an old barn an\u0027 hid all day. I heard \u0027em callin\u0027 me, an\u0027 I saw Jim go by on horseback, an\u0027 other men, too, huntin\u0027 for me. \"Lat the nex\u0027 night I started for the station again, an\u0027 I got there jest about daybreak, thinkin\u0027 I\u0027d be in time for the early mornin\u0027 train. When I got up on the platform, there was Jim a-waitin\u0027! Course I jest set right down an\u0027 cried, but Jim he made me understand what he\u0027d been through while I was hid, an\u0027 talked to me so right then and there that I never once after that doubted in my mind but what it would be right for me to marry him. An\u0027 honey, I haven\u0027t ever had reason to doubt it since. I scarcely ever remember bein\u0027 a cripple, \u0027xcept when I do get good an\u0027 mad sometimes at not bein\u0027 able to get aroun\u0027 as spry as other folks. Sometimes I think it\u0027s been a real comfort to Jim, an\u0027 better \u0027t I was so. \"There\u0027s some folks as can\u0027t be happy \u0027nless they\u0027re doin\u0027 for somebody else; an\u0027 when it happens to be a man, an\u0027 he can do for what\u0027s his own, he\u0027s boun\u0027 to be a good deal better off than ef he had to go a-huntin\u0027 for somethin\u0027 to take up his mind. It grows on \u0027em, too. I don\u0027t ever regret bein\u0027 a cripple; my bein\u0027 helpless has been sech an occupation for Jim!\" The door had opened while she was saying the last words, and Timmy burst in, joyous and cold, to climb into Eleanor\u0027s lap and begin to pour forth an account of the mild adventures of his walk. But Eleanor, taking off his coat and leggings, hushed him. Mother Cary looked up at Rosamund and smiled. \"So you and Timmy had a fine walk, did ye? Well, I\u0027m real glad. It\u0027ll do you good to get out, honey-bud. I was jest tellin\u0027 Mis\u0027 Reeves how-come Pap and me got married!\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to get married to my muvver when I grows up,\" said Tim. Rosamund smiled back at Mother Cary; but her smiles had lost their old merriment. The old woman went on: \"I was jest a-sayin\u0027 how Pap built this house for me jest like I wanted it, an\u0027 we come into it when we were married. Aunt Marthy lived here with us tell she died. Pap\u0027s made my flower beds every spring, an\u0027 I\u0027ve planted the seeds. Seems like it\u0027s been that a way in everything. Pap does most o\u0027 the work, but I never get a chance to forget how glad he is \u0027t I\u0027m here. Whensoever he comes in all worned out, he always knows where to find me, me not bein\u0027 able to get far away; \u0027n I\u0027ve never seen the time \u0027t he didn\u0027t feel fresh an\u0027 strong again after he\u0027d set an\u0027 talked a spell, an\u0027 had a bite o\u0027 somethin\u0027 I\u0027d fixed for him. I ain\u0027t never been afeared to show him how much I loved him. When the children was little \u0027an toddlin\u0027 aroun\u0027, they\u0027d run to meet him an\u0027 hang aroun\u0027 him, but he always looked over their heads to me first. When John was married an\u0027 went away, an\u0027 I felt so bad, Pap jest used to laugh at me; an\u0027 when Lizzie got married, too, an\u0027 went off with her husband, Pap jest said he\u0027d have me all to himself again. The time when the child\u0027en were little was best to me, but I know the best time to Pap is whenever he can find somethin\u0027 to be a-doin\u0027 for me.\" The sweetness of her words seemed to fall on them all like a blessing; for a while no one spoke; but to Rosamund, watching Eleanor, it seemed as if the lovely face were slowly melting from its usual sadness to a rosy glow. As she looked, Eleanor put the child down from her lap and knelt before Rosamund. \"Rose, my sweet,\" she said, her voice a song of love and tenderness, \"would you think me deserting you, if I went to New York to-morrow?\" Rosamund half divined something of her meaning; she took Eleanor\u0027s face between her palms, looking into the eyes that were glowing as she had never seen them. \"Eleanor!\" she cried. Mother Cary gave a low laugh of delight. \"Here, Timmy,\" she said, \"you come with Ma Cary an\u0027 see what I got in the pantry!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77562.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
