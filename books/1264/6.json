{"id":22309,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"During the long silent watches of that night there came to Rosamund one of those revelations, fortunately not rare in human experience, by means of which the soul is taught some measure of the power of the infinite—power to change or to create, to lead, to see more clearly, or better to understand. The afternoon had been crowded with new impressions and emotions following each other so swiftly as to preclude consideration of them, but during the hours beside the unconscious child her mind was busy; one thing after another came back to her, and, reviewed in comparison with all the other happenings of the day, took its rightful place of importance or unimportance. \"One thing after another came back to her.\" \"One thing after another came back to her.\" After the car had borne away her irate sister and friends, the red-headed doctor carefully went over his directions to her, and she had some difficulty in ignoring the twinkle in his eyes; Cecilia\u0027s horror and Flood\u0027s disgust had been as amusing as Pendleton\u0027s lazy irony. But before supper the doctor, too, had hurried away. Flood had not offered him a lift, and the walk back to the Summit was long. Father Cary, whom she found to be a friendly giant with a well-developed rustic sense of humor, had driven off with his tiny wife down the mountain to their daughter\u0027s home, leaving Yetta to clear away the supper. Until then the black eyes of that other daughter of cities had scarcely left Rosamund. As soon as she had washed and put away the dishes, she came to the door of the room where the little boy lay, and after asking if \u0027the lady\u0027 were afraid of the quiet and dark, she went upstairs. Then Rosamund stood at the window and watched the stars come out. The great boles of the oaks and chestnuts in the strip of woods across the way drew about themselves mantles of shadow. An apple fell from a tree near the low, white spring-house, and a cricket began to chirp. From some lower mountain slope there sounded the faint tinkle of a cow bell, and still farther down the valley twinkling lights marked, in the darkness, the places where people were gathered—little beacons of home; and she knew that overhead there shone another light, set in a window by the old woman before she went down the mountain. The placing of that light in the window, Mother Cary had told her, was the uninterrupted custom of the house since her first child was born. On that day of wonder, when the shadows had deepened in the quiet room where the miracle had taken place, they had set a lamp on the window sill, and a light had burned in the same window every night since then, a signal to all who should see it that happiness had come to live on the mountain, and still dwelt there. It was so small a light that, even when dark closed in, the girl standing beneath it could scarcely discern its rays; yet she knew that it was large enough to be seen far off, miles down the valley, across on the other mountains. Flood had told her of seeing it from Doctor Ogilvie\u0027s house at the Summit. She felt its symbolism—so small and humble a light, shedding its rays and carrying its message so far; and with that thought there came another. This humble life of love and service, how beautiful it was! Only that morning she had believed her life the real one, her world the only one worth living in; but already she was beginning to suspect that there might be a life more real, a world less circumscribed. She looked back into the little bedroom, and beyond into the dimly lighted kitchen; it was so poor a house, so rich a home! And of their poverty these mountain folk had given immeasurable largesse to how many waifs—dust of the city\u0027s greed and sin, taken them into this loving shelter, tended them back to usefulness, taught them cleanliness of heart and body. Yet even to the waif so rescued the city\u0027s power of harm reached out! How strange it was that the boy lying there should have escaped so many of the city\u0027s dangers, found this safe refuge on the mountain, and then have been injured on a quiet country road by one of those very dangers he had dodged every day since he first toddled across city streets! As she watched the child, another thought presented itself, caused her cheeks to burn in the dark, sent a wave of disgust and shame over her: these people, who had added nothing to the city\u0027s harm, recognized their responsibility to the city\u0027s offspring; whereas Flood and Pendleton, her sister and herself, who fed upon the city and its workers, would almost have left the boy by the roadside, but for very shame of one another. Her friends believed her whimsical, unreasonable, utterly foolish to watch beside him through one night; and she had been, in her inmost heart, taking credit to herself for doing so! She asked herself whether, indeed, she would have remained, if it had not been for the compelling force of Ogilvie, no less insistent for being unvoiced. She recalled what Flood had told her about him; yet, now that she had met him, all of Flood\u0027s enthusiasm did not seem to explain the man, and she smiled as she remembered how little of that enthusiasm poor Flood had shown in his disgust at Ogilvie\u0027s quiet demand for her assistance. She felt suddenly ashamed as she admitted to herself her secret delight in teasing Flood and Cecilia and Marshall by obeying the doctor\u0027s appeal. In her growing humility she was almost ready to believe that there had been no impulse of good in her remaining. Yet she knew that she would have had to remain, even if the others had not been there. What manner of man, she wondered, was this red-headed country doctor who had first aroused the admiration of a man like Benson Flood, and now had forced Rosamund Randall to perform a service that, a day before, she would have thought a menial one? Certainly he must differ in many respects from the men she had hitherto met. The loudly ticking clock on the kitchen mantel struck off hour after hour. A lusty cock began calling his fellows long before the fading of the stars. Rosamund, standing again at the breast-high casement of the little window, for the first time in her life watched the day break. Rosy fingers of light reached up from the eastern mountains; valley and hillsides threw off their purple and silver wrappings of night, and gradually took on their natural colors; little fitful gusts of air, sweet with night-drawn fragrance, touched her face at the window; from their nests in the near-by fruit-trees faint, sleepy twitterings soon increased to a joyful chorus of bird music; the shadows melted, it was day, and the world awoke; but it was a new world to Rosamund. She had touched the pulse of life, and with the dawn there was born in her heart a purpose, feeble and immature as yet, but as surely purpose as the newborn babe is man. Father Cary came up the mountain early to attend to his cattle, bringing word that his daughter was not so well, and that Mother Cary could not leave her until later in the day, but that Miss Randall was to feel at home, and Yetta was to do all she could for her comfort. He had made breakfast ready by the time Rosamund came into the kitchen; and presently Yetta stumbled down the stairs, yawning and sleepy-eyed. \"Gee!\" she said, by way of morning greeting, \"If this place ain\u0027t the limit for sleep! When I first come up here I jist had to set up in bed an\u0027 listen to the quiet; kept me awake all night, it did. Now I want to sleep all day an\u0027 all night, too! Ain\u0027t it the limit?\" \"But that\u0027s the best thing in the world for you,\" Rosamund said, and smiled at her. The girl must have divined a difference in the smile, for she beamed cheerfully back. \"That\u0027s what Doctor Ogilvie says,\" she replied. \"All\u0027s the matter with me is m\u0027eyes. Y\u0027see I been sewin\u0027 ever since I\u0027s about as big as a peanut; first I sewed on buttons to help my mother, an\u0027 then I sewed beads. There was my mother an\u0027 me an\u0027 m\u0027father, on\u0027y he wasn\u0027t ever there; an\u0027 we had four boarders. Course the boarders had to set next to the light, an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t see very well. Then after my mother died, I sewed collars day-times and beads at night, till I got the job in the shirt-waist shop. Tha\u0027s where m\u0027eyes got inspected—they don\u0027t never inspect you till you get a good job. It don\u0027t do me no good to know my eyes is bad; I could a told \u0027em that m\u0027self—only thing is, that was the reason they sent me up here, so I\u0027ve that much to thank \u0027em for, I guess. Still, I——\" But Father Cary interrupted the stream of chatter. \"Now look a here,\" he said, \"supposin\u0027 you do less talkin\u0027 an\u0027 more eatin\u0027! Two glasses of milk, two dishes o\u0027 oatmeal, and two eggs is what you got to get away with before you get up from this table.\" But Yetta\u0027s tongue was irrepressible. \"You watch me!\" she replied, and grinned at him, her black eyes sparkling. \"That\u0027s another funny thing about the country,\" she informed Rosamund, nodding. It was evident that she believed Miss Randall to be as much a stranger to the country as she herself had been. \"In the city all you want to eat in the mornin\u0027 is a bite o\u0027 bread an\u0027 some tea; nobody ever heard o\u0027 eatin\u0027 eggs in the mornin\u0027, nor oatmeal any other time; but here—Gee! I can stow away eggs while the band plays on, an\u0027 tea ain\u0027t in it with milk—this yere kind o\u0027 milk!\" Rosamund\u0027s strained ear caught a faint rustle from the inner room; she sprang up, followed closely by the others; the child had moved his head, and his eyes were closed; before that they had been ever so slightly open. Rosamund laid her hand upon his forehead, bent down so that his breath fanned her soft cheek. Then she looked up at Father Cary. \"I believe he is really sleeping, not unconscious,\" she whispered. \"I think we must keep very, very quiet.\" Yetta nodded, tiptoed out of the room, and presently Father Cary\u0027s large form passed the window on the way to the stable. So again was Rosamund\u0027s vigil renewed, unbroken through several hours except by faint noises from without, the humming of a locust, the chirps of birds, the homely conversation of some chickens, who had stolen up to the little house, lonely for Mother Cary. She must have dozed, for it seemed only a short time before the kitchen clock struck eleven, and almost at the same moment the doctor stood in the doorway, with Mother Cary behind him. The doctor\u0027s hair had been very much blown by the wind, but it would have taken more than wind to send his smile awry. \"Morning!\" he threw towards Rosamund. She was at once aware that he thought of her only as the child\u0027s nurse, oblivious of all that other men saw in her, of her beauty and grace, of the signs of wealth and well-being in her garments and bearing. It amused her, though her smile was, perhaps, a little disdainful. The boy was better; the doctor could find no serious injuries. \"I am sure the car barely touched him,\" Rosamund said, and the doctor nodded. \"But it sometimes takes so little to shock the life out of a little underfed, weakened body like this,\" he said. \"There\u0027s nothing to fight with, nothing to build on.\" Rosamund\u0027s hand went over her heart. \"Then you think,\" she asked, \"you think that he will not——\" \"On the contrary, I am very sure that he will,\" the doctor smiled at her. \"Mother Cary, here, will teach you how to make him well.\" Mother Cary laid her wrinkled hand on the girl\u0027s arm, but Rosamund\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \"Poor mite!\" she said, bending over the child, \"we will try to make you well—but I don\u0027t know what for!\" Then Mother Cary spoke for the first time since her return. \"Don\u0027t you trouble yourself about the what for, dearie,\" she said. \"Folks is got plenty to keep \u0027em busy with the \u0027what way\u0027 and the \u0027what next\u0027 without troublin\u0027 themselves with the \u0027what for.\u0027 Ain\u0027t it so, Doctor?\" \"It most certainly is,\" the red-headed doctor agreed, running his fingers through his already tousled hair. When he had given her further directions for the care of the child and driven off behind his jogging old white mare, he seemed to have left with her some of his own happy energy and assurance. Quite suddenly, the fatigue of her sleepless night fell from her, and from some unsuspected inner store-house of strength there crept a serenity and determination hitherto undreamed of. The boy would sleep, the doctor had told her, until late afternoon, probably awake hungry and thirsty, and then ought to sleep again; he must be kept very quiet, nourished regularly and lightly, made clean and comfortable; such careful and ceaseless nursing should, in a week or two, bring him out with even more strength than he had had before. So, until afternoon, there would be little for her to do. She went into the kitchen to be with the old woman, who was moving about with her queer, crab-like motion of crutches and hands, preparing their dinner; Yetta had taken herself to the fields. \"No, indeedy, you can\u0027t help me one mite,\" Mother Cary declared, \"exceptin\u0027 by settin\u0027 in that arm cheer and puttin\u0027 your pretty head back and restin.\u0027 There\u0027s nothin\u0027 I enjoy more\u0027n a body to talk to whilst I\u0027m a gettin\u0027 dinner, or supper. Yetta ain\u0027t that kind of a body, though! Land! The way the child can talk, and the things she knows!\" Mother Cary turned about from her biscuit board to emphasize her horror. \"Honey,\" she said, impressively, \"that child knows more o\u0027 the world, the bad side of it, than—well, than I do!\" Rosamund smiled, and the old woman shook her head at her. \"Oh, I was brought up in the city, honey,\" she told her, \"so I know more about it than you think for. That\u0027s what makes me glad the doctor brought us a girl, this time; she\u0027s the first girl we\u0027ve had this summer. I wisht it might be that she could stay up here as I did, but land! they ain\u0027t but one Pap! Pap jest made me stay, and me a cripple, too! He said he couldn\u0027t be happy without somebody to look after; and whilst it was a new idea to me then, I come to see the sense of it many a long year ago! That poor little Yetta! It\u0027s her eyes is bad. They ain\u0027t so bad but what they won\u0027t do well enough for most things; but all she knows how to do is to sew beads and buttons and run a big sewin\u0027 machine in a shop. They say her eyes won\u0027t hold out for that! Land! If I was rich, I\u0027d have her taught music, that\u0027s what I\u0027d do! You jest ought to hear the child sing, dearie! To hear her in the evenin\u0027s settin\u0027 down on the fence an\u0027 singin\u0027, why, it\u0027s prettier \u0027n a whip-poor-will a-callin\u0027. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me a mite if Yetta could be learnt to sing that well, with some new songs and such, that folks would pay money to hear her!\" \"Perhaps we could find some way to help her,\" Miss Randall suggested. Mother Cary flashed a keen look at her. \"Do you know any rich folks, honey, that might?\" she asked eagerly. \"Yetta\u0027s a good little thing, for all the bad she knows. An\u0027 she jest loves an\u0027 loves whatever is pretty an\u0027 sweet!\" \"I think perhaps I do know someone,\" Rosamund said. \"But I wanted especially to ask you to let me board with you here for a while. Is there room for me?\" \"Room a plenty, dearie,\" the old woman said, as she hobbled to the door to strike the metal hoop that swung from the over-hanging floor of the second story. \"But,\" she added, when she had sent the summons ringing out to Pap and Yetta, and had come back and seated herself near the girl, \"but there ain\u0027t any call for you to pay. Pap an\u0027 me has a plenty to share with folks that come our way; and you\u0027re helpin\u0027 with Timmy. I\u0027d be real pleased to have you stay.\" But Rosamund hesitated. \"I\u0027m afraid I cannot do that,\" she said, \"unless you will let me pay something. I can afford it, really,\" she added, smiling. For a long moment the old woman looked at her, keenly, kindly, with the faintest, tenderest, most teasing smile on her little wrinkled face that was as brown as a nut. \"An\u0027 can\u0027t you really afford to visit?\" she asked. \"There\u0027s a plenty of folks that can afford to pay and to give; there ain\u0027t so many as can afford to take and to be done for. Ain\u0027t you forgettin\u0027 which kind you be?\" Rosamund lifted her head, and looked directly into the twinkling, faded old eyes. \"No,\" she said, \"I\u0027m not forgetting the kind I am! I think I am only beginning to find out!\" Mother Cary laid her hand over the girl\u0027s in her usual gesture of caress before she hobbled to the dinner table. Pap and Yetta had come in and were already seating themselves. It was the sweetest meal that Rosamund had ever tasted; but she had still to find out more about herself. They had not risen from the table when a musical view-halloo sounded up from the road below the stretch of woods, and in a moment Flood and Pendleton sprang out of the big red car and came briskly up the little walk. Rosamund went forward to meet them. \"Why, I say,\" said Flood, beaming at her, \"you\u0027re looking right as a trivet, you know!\" Pendleton drawled: \"Ah, fair knight-errantess! Miss Nightingale! Also Rose o\u0027 the World! You wouldn\u0027t be smiling like that if you knew Cecilia\u0027s state of mind!\" Rosamund laughed, and held out her hand to them. \"I can imagine it,\" she said. \"It\u0027s plain that I had better keep out of her way for a time!\" \"I\u0027m at your service,\" cried Flood bowing low: with mock servility, delighted at her merry mood, at her smiles which included even himself. But Pendleton understood her better. \"Now, what are you up to, Rosy?\" he asked, severely, uneasily. She came directly to the point. \"I am going to stay here,\" she announced. Both men stared at her. \"How d\u0027ye mean?\" asked Flood weakly. \"The deuce you are!\" cried Pendleton. \"Oh! With Mrs. Reeves!\" Flood beamed, as if he had found an answer even while asking. \"Is that it? Why didn\u0027t you say so? Where is Eleanor, anyway?\" Pendleton asked. Rosamund laughed again. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know!\" she said. \"She is at Bluemont, and that\u0027s miles away, isn\u0027t it? I haven\u0027t even asked. No, Marshall, no, Mr. Flood, I am going to stay here, right here, here in this house, or this valley, or this mountain, but here, here as long as I like—forever, if I want to! That\u0027s what I mean—or part of it!\" It was evident that her laughter carried more conviction than any amount of seriousness would have done. Poor Flood\u0027s face got redder, and he suddenly, after a stare, turned on his heel, and walked rather slowly down the path to his car, standing beside it with his arms folded, looking across at the strip of woods, but seeing nothing. Pendleton, however, felt it incumbent upon him to remonstrate. \"Of course, we all know you can afford any whim you like, Rosamund,\" he said, in the tone of the old friend who dares, \"but I think I ought to warn you that this sort of thing is not—not in the best of taste, you know! It is not done, really—in—in—among our sort, you know!\" Rosamund openly showed her amusement. \"That is undoubtedly true, my dear Marshall,\" she said, \"but this time it is going to be done! I am going to do it! You think it is a freak, and I\u0027m sure I can say it isn\u0027t, because I don\u0027t in the least know what it is!\" \"I think you\u0027re mad. If I had not been an unwilling observer of the accident, I should believe it was you had got concussion, and not the infant.\" \"My dear Marshall, your diagnosis is wrong! I may have a—a disease, but it is not madness. Did you ever hear of people who had suffered from loss of memory for years and years and quite suddenly recovered it? Perhaps I\u0027m one of those—I feel as if I had only just come to my senses!\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about!\" said Pendleton. \"Don\u0027t you? I thought you wouldn\u0027t!\" Again she laughed, and at the sound Flood started, looked back towards the house where she stood, radiant and lovely, framed in the doorway, and then got into his car. But Pendleton had one further protest. \"You can\u0027t stay in this—this hovel, alone, Rosamund! You can\u0027t think of doing it! Please remember I have got to go back to Cecilia! What on earth am I going to say to her?\" \"Poor Marshall! Tell Cecilia, with my love, that I am going to stay here for the present. She may send me some clothes by express, or not, as she likes. Please give her my love, and tell her that I hope she will have a pleasant visit with the Whartons—she had better go there to-morrow. And try, my dear Marshall, to assure her of my sanity! Good-by! Don\u0027t let me keep you waiting!\" Pendleton pushed back his hat, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and looked at her. Then he drew a long breath and delivered himself, oracularly. \"Rosamund,\" he said, \"you\u0027re a fool! You can\u0027t, you really can\u0027t, do this sort of thing, you know. Why, my dear girl, it—it is not done, you know, in—\" But Rosamund ran back into the house, turned a flashing, smiling look upon him over her shoulder, cried, \"Good-by, Marshall! Give my love to Cecilia!\" and was gone, leaving him there agape. There was really nothing for him to do but rejoin Flood. Cecilia, however, remained for a time inconsolable. Flood and Pendleton motored back across the mountain, told Mrs. Maxwell of Rosamund\u0027s decision to remain indefinitely in the little cottage on the mountain, and forthwith avoided the presence of the irate lady as much as possible. Fortunately, the newly arriving week-end guests had to be entertained. They were very good and very stupid; but, as Pendleton said, anything was better than Cecilia in a temper. Left to herself, Cecilia\u0027s mind was occupied with a veritable jack-straw puzzle of events, motives, contingencies. She had had good reason, before this, to know that Rosamund enjoyed unforeseen departures; but that anyone should deliberately choose to forego the luxuries of Oakleigh, to stay, instead, in what Mrs. Maxwell considered a peasant\u0027s cottage—such conduct, such a choice, were beyond the lady\u0027s imagination and experience. Rosamund must be wild; for surely not even pique at Cecilia\u0027s generalship, not even annoyance at Flood\u0027s attentions, not even the desire to be near that tiresome Eleanor Reeves, could have determined her to such a move. As for the accident, anyone could have cared for the child. Rosamund could have paid a dozen nurses to stay there, if she was charitably inclined; and certainly Mr. Flood had shown that he wanted to do what was right. Cecilia could not understand it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2805/77546.html","bookId":1264,"book":{"id":1264,"title":"The Land of Content","description":"简介： It was earliest spring, and almost the close of a day whose sunshine and warmth had coaxed into bloom many timid roadside flowers, and sent the white petals of farmyard cherries trembling to earth like tiny, belated snowfalls.
