{"id":84169,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"Boy, was he a f**king mess. Thanks for sticking around, for not giving up on me. I know that at times you wanted to. But . . . it was great having you along for the ride. If this were a fairy tale, now would be the time you’d read, “And they lived happily ever after . . .” But that’s just too boring for us. So instead, I’ll tell you this: We lived . . . the same way we loved: with passion, tenderness, and laughter. And every day—every f**king day—to the very fullest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-57.html","bookId":1810,"book":{"id":1810,"title":"Tied (Tangled #4)","description":"Storyline: In the fourth sexy romance by the New York Times bestselling author of Tangled and Twisted, Drew and Kate can’t wait to tie the knot—if they can survive the pre-wedding festivities. For most of my life, I never imagined I’d get married. But Kate did the impossible: she changed me. I think we can all agree I was pretty frigging awesome before, but now I’m even better. The road to this day wasn’t all rainbows and boners. There were mistakes and misunderstandings worthy of a Greek tragedy. But Kate and I made it through with our inexhaustible lust, boundless admiration, and everlasting love for one another intact. That being said, there were some unexpected incidents in Vegas last weekend that could have been a problem. It was kind of... my final test. I know what you’re thinking—what the hell did you do this time? Relax. Let’s not judge, or call for my castration, until you\u0027ve heard the whole story. And hold on tight, because you’re in for a wild ride. Did you expect anything less?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tied-tangled-4.jpg","author":"Emma Chase","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:01 PM"}}
