{"id":81173,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. The cameras were set so that he could watch from four different angles, all in full color, the \"battle arena\" well lit, his chair comfortable. He only regretted that he hadn\u0027t had time to return to their private residence, to watch the entertainment with Alexia by his side - al - though that had turned out to be advantageous, as well, a silver lining. The training facility\u0027s control room had cameras that could be re-angled with the touch of a but - ton, ensuring the clearest possible view. Alfred smiled, watching as Claire hesitated at the door, quite pleased with how his plan had come to fruition. She\u0027d chased him as he\u0027d hoped, stepped into his trap with hardly a struggle. He hadn\u0027t expected her to actually fire at him, but that was easily overlooked in retrospect. And truly, it made the anticipation for her up - coming death all the sweeter, the addition of a personal revenge aspect into the mix. The OR1, a highly developed BOW specifically cre - ated for field combat, was one of Alfred\u0027s all-time fa - vorites. The An3 Sandworm was impressive, to be sure, the standard Hunter 121s lethal and fast, but the ORls were special - the human skeletal structure showed through, particularly in the face and torso, giving them the look of classic Death. Thek skull faces leered out beneath corded ropes of real and synthetic tendon, like a neo grim reaper. They weren\u0027t just dangerous; the way they looked was terror inspiring, at the most basic level of instinct. The island employees called them Bandersnatches, a nonsense word from some poem that was strangely fit - ting, considering thek unique design and function. There were thirty of them at Rockfort, half of those in stasis, though Alfred had only been able to account for eight of them since the attack...... oh! Claire was opening the door. Elated, Alfred focused his full attention on the girl, his left hand on the camera controls, his right hovering over the lock functions for the storage areas. Claire stepped onto the balcony of the large, open, two-story bay with gun in hand, trying to look every-where at once. Alfred zoomed in on her face, wanting to fully appreciate her fear, but was disappointed by her lack of expression. After surmising that she was in no immediate danger, she seemed watchful, no more. But when I push this button... Alfred snickered, unable to contain his excitement, lightly stroking his right forefinger across the switches for the bay\u0027s two shuttered storage closets, one on the balcony, one bordering the freight elevator on the lower floor. At his whim, Claire Redfield would die. True, she wasn\u0027t important, her death as meaningless as her life had surely been, but it was the control that mattered, his control. And the pain, the exquisite torture, the look in her eyes when she realizes that her existence is at its end... Alfred controlled his body as tightly as he controlled his life, and prided himself on his ability to dominate his sexual desires, to feel nothing unless he chose to, but just thinking of Claire\u0027s death inspired in him a passion that was beyond physical lust, beyond words, even be - yond the simple scope of man\u0027s awareness. Alexia knows, Alfred thought, certain that his beautiful sister was watching, too, that she understood what could not be explained. In Claire\u0027s death, they would be as close as two people could ever be; it was the wonder of their relationship, the culmination of the Ashford legacy. He couldn\u0027t contain himself another moment. As Claire took another cautious step into the center of the room, he first locked the door she\u0027d come through, seal - ing off her escape - and then pressed the button for the second story shutter release. Instantly, the narrow metal shutter not ten feet from where she stood slid open and as Claire stumbled back - ward, trying to distance herself from the unknown threat, a fully matured Bandersnatch stepped out, ready to engage. It was beautiful, the creature. Between seven and eight feet tall, its face was that of a grinning skeleton, its head set low and menacing. The disproportionately huge upper body supported its primary weapon - the right arm, as thick as one of its tree-trunk legs, longer than half its full body length at rest, the hand span big enough to cover an ordinary man\u0027s entire chest. Its left arm was withered, tiny and misshapen, but a Bander - snatch only needed the one. Alfred had hoped for some exclamation from her, a curse or a scream, but she was silent as she retreated to what she believed to be a safe distance. She opened fire almost immediately. The Bandersnatch roared, a rough guttural scream, and then performed its trick. Alfred had seen it a dozen times, but never tired of watching. The massive right arm snapped toward Claire, proba - bly fifteen feet away, the engineered muscles hyperex - tending, the elastic tendons and ligaments stretching...... and it slapped Claire to the ground with scarcely any effort, the girl knocked sprawling before the Ban - dersnatch\u0027s arm snapped back into place. Yes, oh, yes! Claire crabbed backward as fast as she could, stop-ping only when her back hit the wall. Alfred zoomed in to see that a fine sheen of sweat had broken out across her face, but she still wore no expression beyond a kind of intense watchfulness. She pulled herself to her feet and sidestepped along the wall, moving fast, obviously not wanting to be knocked off the balcony by the crea - ture\u0027s next blow. Alfred grinned, ignoring the disappointment that her apparent lack of terror had brought about. She\u0027d be out of wall in another few seconds, backed into a corner... ... and then a series of blows, beating her to death against the wall... or a simple neck snap, a grasp of her head and a single, solid shake... or will it toy with her, tossing her around like one of Alexia\u0027s ragdolls? Alfred leaned in eagerly, changing the angle for one of the cameras, watching as the doomed girl raised her weapon, taking careful aim in spite of her hopeless posi - tion... ... bam! The Bandersnatch shrieked even louder than the gun-shot, shaking its head wildly, dark fluids rushing from its moving face. It sprayed the balcony walls with ichorous liquid, blood and other things, trying desper - ately to bring its arm up, to protect or comfort its wound. It all happened so fast, so violently, it was like watching a fountain geyser suddenly explode from a still lake. The eyes. She went for its eyes. Bam! Claire shot again, and then again, and the Bander-snatch cried out in fury and new pain, still trying to grasp its own injured head as it stumbled around in a weaving circle... and then, to Alfred\u0027s shock, it col - lapsed to the floor, its writhings becoming less and less urgent, its scream becoming a hoarse, dying protest. Stunned with disbelief, Alfred could finally see an emotion on Claire\u0027s face - pity. She moved to stand over the creature and shot once more, stilling it completely. Then she turned and walked toward the stairs, as casu - ally as if she was walking away from a ladies\u0027 luncheon. No-no-no-no! This was wrong, all wrong, but it wasn\u0027t over, not yet. Furious, he stabbed at the other switch, releasing the second creature from its enclosure, the shutter sliding open behind a stack of storage containers on the elevator level. You won\u0027t be so fortunate this time, he thought desper-ately, still barely able to credit what he\u0027d just seen. Claire had heard the second door open, but the stack of contain-ers obscured her point of view, hiding the new menace. She was stopped at the foot of the stairs, holding herself very still, scanning for the exact source of the noise. The second Bandersnatch stepped out of its closet and casually reached up, grasping a large metal crate at the top of a ten foot stack of them. It pulled itself up, seemingly without effort - and without Claire noticing, her attention too intently fixed on the shadowy corner opposite the stairs. The Bandersnatch reached down for her. Claire saw it coming at the last instant, too late to get out of its way. The creature wrapped its muscular fingers around her head and lifted her up, studying her as a cat studied a mouse. Or a rat, Alfred thought, some of his previous joy re - turning at the sight of the girl dropping her weapon and struggling to free herself, grasping at the OK1\u0027s steel grip with panicked hands - - and Alfred\u0027s focus was broken at the sound of shat - tering glass somewhere off screen, and someone was shooting, the sudden flurry of noise and activity making the Bandersnatch shriek, making it drop Claire. What\u0027s...? The window, Alfred answered himself, watching in horror as the young prisoner, Burnside, threw himself into the camera shot, firing two handguns at once, blast - ing at the startled creature - startled, then screaming in agony as Claire scooped up her weapon and joined the fray. The Bandersnatch tried to attack, its arm whipping out toward the new assailant, but it was driven back by the sheer number of rounds being pumped into its body, finally slumping against a storage container. Dead. Without consciously deciding to do it, Alfred reached for the freight elevator controls, a part of him remember - ing that there was at least one more OR1 below, as well as a number of virus carriers. The two youths stumbled as the floor beneath their feet began to go down, taking them to the basement of the training facility. There were no work - ing cameras there, but enjoying their deaths was no longer Alfred\u0027s primary concern - not so long as they died. Can\u0027t be, this can\u0027t be happening. The OR1s should have dispatched Claire and her meddlesome friend ef - fortlessly, but they were alive and his pets had suffered and died. He tried to convince himself that the two would soon perish in the basement, which had been locked down and isolated since the first viral leak, but suddenly, nothing seemed certain anymore. \"Alexia,\" Alfred whispered, feeling the blood drain from his face, feeling his very being flush with shame. He had to make her see that it wasn\u0027t his fault, that his trap had worked perfectly, that the impossible had oc - curred... and he\u0027d have to accept the subsequent cool - ness in her gaze, the undertone of disappointment in her sweet voice as she reassured him that she understood. The only thing that surpassed his shame was a new - found hatred for Claire Redfield, burning brighter than a thousand burning stars. No sacrifice was too great to se-cure her torment, hers and that of her shining knight. Until both had offered penitence in flesh and blood, Alfred would not rest. He swore it. \"Steve, other side,\" Claire said, the instant the freight elevator began to move. Steve nodded. Claire reloaded and Steve clambered over two of the heavy crates, both Lugers raised. As if by silent agreement, neither of them spoke as the lift descended, both watching intently for what came next. He saved my life, Claire thought wonderingly, watch - ing grease-smeared wall tracks slide past, blood still screaming through her veins from when she\u0027d realized she would die. And Steve Burnside, who she\u0027d written off as a well-intentioned but troubled, barely competent blowhard, had kept that from happening. Though he may only have delayed the inevitable... She didn\u0027t know what Alfred had in mind now, but she wasn\u0027t looking forward to meeting any more of his \"friends.\" Two skull-faced, rubber band-armed freaks had been more than enough. She\u0027d been incredibly lucky to get off with a couple of bruises and a sore neck. Claire had expected the elevator to drop them into some sort of BOW holding area, but she was pleasantly disappointed. The massive lift simply came to a stop. There was only one exit that she could see, and although she harbored no illusions about how safe things would be on the other side of that door, it seemed they were out of danger for the moment. \"Hey, Claire, check it out!\" Steve climbed back over the boxes, holding what could only be some kind of a submachine gun, boxy, dark and deadly-looking with an extended magazine. \"It was behind one of the crates,\" Steve said happily. He\u0027d already stuck the gold Lugers in his belt. \"Nine millimeter, just like the Lugers and the guard weapons. Oh, by the way, here.\" He reached into one of the outside pockets on his camo pants and pulled out three clips for the M93R. \"I searched a couple of guards on my way back from the dock. I like the Lugers better, and now that I\u0027ve got this...\" He held up the new weapon, grinning, \"I don\u0027t need the extra hardware. You can have the gun, too.\" Claire gratefully accepted the clips and the weapon, not sure how to thank him for what he\u0027d done, deter - mined to try, anyway. \"Steve... if you hadn\u0027t shown up when you did...\" \"Forget it,\" he said, shrugging. \"We\u0027re even now.\" \"Well, thanks all the same,\" Claire said, smiling warmly. He smiled back, and she saw a flicker of real interest in his gaze, a sincerity there that was quite different than his previous posturing. Not sure what to do about it, for him or for herself, she moved the conversation along. \"I thought you were going to wait at the dock,\" she said. \"It wasn\u0027t really a dock,\" Steve said, and told her what had happened since they\u0027d separated. The seaplane was terrific news; having to deal with Umbrella\u0027s bizarre key fetish yet again wasn\u0027t so terrific. \"...and when I couldn\u0027t find them, I thought I\u0027d wander over and see if you\u0027d come across anything like that,\" he finished, shrugging again, working hard to look nonchalant. \"That\u0027s when I heard the shots. How \u0027bout you, anything interesting? Besides meeting up with a couple of Umbrella\u0027s monsters, I mean.\" \"I\u0027ll say. Do you know anything about Alfred Ash-ford?\" \"Only that him and his sister are total fruitcakes,\" Steve said promptly. \"And that the guards are - were scared of him. I could tell, the way they avoided talking about him. He sent his own assistant to the infirmary, I heard. There was some whacked-out doctor working there, I guess, a lot of prisoners got taken to the infirmary and never came back. Doesn\u0027t take a genius, you know?\" Claire nodded, fascinated in spite of herself. \"What about the sister?\" \"I never heard much about her, except she\u0027s some kind of shut-in,\" Steve said. \"No one even knows what she looks like. I think her name is Alexia... Alexandra, maybe, I don\u0027t remember. Why?\" She filled him in on her encounters with Alfred, fol - lowed by a brief synopsis of where she\u0027d been and what she\u0027d found. When she mentioned that she had the med - ication she\u0027d been looking for, Steve scowled - and then blinked, his face clearly expressing a sudden change of heart. \"Maybe this Umbrella guy...\" \"Rodrigo,\" Claire interjected. \"Okay, whatever,\" Steve said impatiently. \"Maybe he knows something about these proof key things. Like where they are.\"Good idea. \"It would beat searching the entire island, wouldn\u0027t it?\" Claire said. \"You up for a trip back to the prison? Assuming we can get out of here, that is.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll clear us a path,\" Steve said, not a trace of doubt in his voice. \"You just leave that part to me.\" Claire opened her mouth to comment on the pitfalls of overconfidence, particularly where Umbrella was concerned, then closed it again. Maybe it was his belief in himself that had carried him this far - that by not ac - cepting the possibility of defeat, he was assuring him-self a win. Fine in theory, dangerous in practice. She\u0027d be there to cover him, at least. \"We were on the first floor of the training facility,\" he continued. \"Which means we\u0027re in the basement now. I know from my...\" Steve shook his head, flustered for some reason, but before she could ask about it, he continued on as if noth-ing had happened. \"There\u0027s a boiler room, and a sewer area... basi-cally, we go that way,\" he said, gesturing at the door. Claire decided not to point out that since it was the only door, she\u0027d already come to that conclusion. \"I\u0027m right behind you.\" \"Stay close,\" Steve said roughly, walking to the door and looking back over the shoulder, trying to look fierce, his jaw set and his eyes narrowed. Claire was torn between irritation and laughter, finally choosing to think of it as endearing. Then he was opening the door, and the reality of their situation came back to her, floating in on the smell of gangrenous tissue. She stopped worrying about the little things, concentrating on the need to sur-vive. What Steve knew about guns he could sum up in about five seconds, but he knew what he liked. And he decided immediately upon pulling the trigger of his newest find that it was the shit, hands down. He stepped out of the freight elevator ready to kick some rotten ass, and saw his opportunity less than ten feet away. There were five of them in all - well, five and a half, including the crawling mess on the floor over by the shelves - and all he had to do was tap the trigger, and then he was trying like hell to keep the weapon from flying out of his hand. Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam... He swept the kicking gun left to right, releasing the trigger as the last zombie\u0027s swiss-cheese brain parted company with its swiss-cheese head. It was all over in just a few seconds, so fast that it seemed unreal - like he\u0027d coughed and a building had blown up or something. Claire had taken care of the floor pizza during his sweep, and when he turned around, triumphant, he was a little surprised to see that she wasn\u0027t smiling... until he thought about it for a second, and then he felt a little ashamed of himself. As far as he was concerned, they weren\u0027t really people anymore. He knew that if he were ever infected he\u0027d want someone to plug him, to keep him from hurting anyone else - not to mention granting him a fast death, rather than letting him rot on the hoof. But they were human, once. What happened to them was entirely shitty and unfair, no question. True, and maybe he should be more respectful, but on the other hand, the gun was extremely cool, and they were zombies. It was a touchy subject, not one that he was pre - pared to mess around with, but he decided he could at least not laugh about it in front of Claire. He didn\u0027t want her to think he was some bloodthirsty asshole. He pointed at the door ahead and to the right, fairly sure that they were heading in the right direction, at least roughly. The way he figured it, they\u0027d come out at least close to the front yard of the training facility. Claire nodded, and Steve led the way once again, push - ing the door open and stepping through. They were stand - ing at the top of a half flight of open stairs, leading down into the boiler room. A room full of big, battered-looking, hissing machinery, anyway, Steve didn\u0027t actually know what a boiler looked like. There were four zombies milling around between them and the steps leading up and out, on the other side of the cold, hissing room. Steve raised the machine gun and was about to fire when Claire tapped his arm, moving to stand beside him. \"Watch,\" she said, and pointed her 9mm at the zom-bie group - not quite, he saw, she was aiming low at something just past them...... and pow, BOOM, three of the creatures went down, blackened and smoking. Behind them, what was left of a small, obviously combustible container, only jagged curls of splayed metal surrounded by a smudge of toxic smoke. The fourth zombie had been hit, but not as hard. Claire took it out with a single head shot before speaking again. \"Saves ammo,\" she said simply, and brushed past him to walk down the steps. Steve followed, slightly awed by her, but playing it detached, like he\u0027d already thought of that. If there was one thing he knew about chicks, it was that they didn\u0027t like guys who mooned all over them, acting all goofy. Not that I give a shit what she thinks about me, he told himself firmly. She\u0027s just... kind of cool, is all. Claire reached the next door first, and waited until he caught up, nodded that he was ready. As soon as she opened it they both relaxed, he could see her shoulders loosen and felt his own heart beating again. A dark stone walkway, totally empty, open on one side. There was water running somewhere below, and some kind of a narrow gate straight ahead, like an old-fashioned eleva-tor door. \"This is starting to seem a little too easy,\" Claire said softly. \"Yeah,\" Steve whispered back. So much for Alfie - boy\u0027s evil playground shtick. They were about halfway across when they heard it, echoing up from somewhere in the black running waters below - a strangely high, piercing trill, inhuman but not like an animal, either. Whatever it was, it sounded ex - tremely pissed - and from the splashing noises, it was coming closer. Steve was ready to start shooting but Claire grabbed his arm and took off running, practically jerking him off his feet. They were at the lift in about two seconds, Claire ripping the gate aside and shoving him into a tiny elevator cab, jumping in after him and slamming the gate closed. \"Okay, jeez, you don\u0027t have to push,\" Steve said, rub-bing his arm indignantly. \"Sorry,\" she said, pushing an errant strand of hair be-hind one ear, looking as rattled as he\u0027d seen her get. \"It\u0027s just... I\u0027ve heard that sound before. Hunters, I think they\u0027re called, extremely bad news. There were a bunch of them loose in Raccoon.\" She smiled shakily, which suddenly made him want to put his arm around her, or hold her hand or some - thing. He didn\u0027t. \"Brings up some bad memories, you know?\" she said. Raccoon... that was the place that had been blown up a few months ago, if he remembered right, right be - fore he\u0027d come to Rockfort. The town\u0027s own police chief had done it. \"Did Umbrella have something to do with Raccoon?\" Claire seemed surprised, but then smiled a little eas - ier, turning her attention to the elevator controls. \"Long story. I\u0027ll tell you about it when we get out of here. So, first floor?\" \"Yeah,\" Steve said, then changed his mind. \"Actually, maybe we should go up to the second. That way we can look out over the yard, see what we\u0027ll be up against.\" \"You know, you\u0027re smarter than you look,\" Claire said teasingly, punching the button. Steve was still try-ing to think of a witty comeback when the elevator came to a stop, and Claire opened the door. There was a shuttered lockdown door to their right, so they went left, the short hallway empty. There was only one door in that direction, too, but they were in luck, the knob turned when Claire tried it. Again, there were no surprises. The door opened up to a cramped wooden balcony thick with dust, overlook - ing a big room full of junk - a rusted military Jeep, stacks of grungy old oil drums, broken boxes and the like. It seemed more like a storage shed than anything else, and though it was well lit, there were enough piles of crap that it was impossible to see if anyone was down there. There was, though, Steve could hear shuffling noises. He took a few steps to the left, trying to see the corner beneath the balcony, and Claire followed. The boards creaked and shifted beneath their steps. \"Doesn\u0027t seem too sturdy...\" Claire started, and was cut off by a giant, splintering craaack, pieces of the bal - cony floor flying up as both of them went down. Shit. Steve didn\u0027t even have time to tense for the impact, it was over so quick. He landed on his left side, jarring his shoulder, his left knee cracking against a random bit of wood. Almost immediately, a pyramid of empty barrels fell over behind him, clattering hollowly to the ground and Steve heard a zombie\u0027s hungry wail. \"Claire?\" Steve called, crawling to his feet and turn-ing, looking for her and the zombie. There she was amid the barrels, still down, rubbing one ankle. Her handgun was about ten feet away. Steve saw her eyes go wide and followed her gaze, a lone zombie teetering toward her...... and all he could do was stare at it, his body sud - denly a million miles away. Claire said something but he couldn\u0027t hear her, too intent on the virus carrier. It had been a big man, leaning toward fat, but someone had blasted off part of his gut. The open, sticky, belly wounds were seeping, the dark shirt made even darker by the almost uniform layer of blood that had soaked the cloth. It was gray-faced and hollow-eyed, like all of them, and had either bitten through its tongue or had been eating - his, its mouth was smeared with blood. Claire said something else, but Steve was remember - ing something, a sudden, vivid flash of memory so real that it was almost like reliving the experience. He\u0027d been four or five years old when his parents had taken him to his first parade, a Thanksgiving parade. He was sitting on his father\u0027s shoulder, watching the clowns go by, sur - rounded by loud, shouting people, and he\u0027d started to cry. He couldn\u0027t remember why; what he remembered was his father looking up at him, his eyes concerned and full of love. When he\u0027d asked what was wrong, his voice was so familiar and well-loved that Steve had wrapped his tiny arms around his father\u0027s neck and hidden his face, still crying but knowing he was safe, that no harm could come to him so long as his father held him... \"Steve!\" Claire, practically screaming his name and he saw that the zombie was almost on top of her, its gray fingers closing around her vest, pulling her up to its drooling, bloody mouth. Steve screamed, too, opening fire, the thunder of bul - lets ripping into his father\u0027s face and body, tearing him away from Claire. He kept firing, kept screaming until his father lay still and the thunder had stopped, only dry clicks coming from the gun, and then Claire was touch - ing his shoulder, turning him away as he called out for his father, weeping. They sat for a while. When he could speak, he told her about it, parts of it, his arms around his knees and head down. Told her about his father, who had worked for Umbrella as a truck driver, who had been caught try-ing to steal a formula from one of their labs. He told her about his mother, who had been gunned down by a trio of Umbrella soldiers in their own home, lay choking and bloody and dying on the living room floor when Steve came home from school. The men had taken them away, taken Steve and his father to Rockfort. \"I thought he was killed in the air strike,\" Steve said, wiping at his eyes. \"I wanted to feel bad about it, I did, but I just kept thinking about Mom, about how she looked... but I didn\u0027t want him to die, I didn\u0027t, I... I loved him, too.\" Saying it out loud made him start crying again. Claire\u0027s arm was around him but he barely felt it, so sad that he thought he might die. He knew he had to get up, he had to find the keys and go with Claire and fly the plane, but none of that seemed important anymore. Claire had been mostly quiet, only listening and hold - ing him, but she stood up now and told him to stay where he was, that she\u0027d be back soon and then they could leave. That was okay, it was good, he wanted to be alone. And he was more exhausted than he\u0027d ever been in his life, so tired and heavy that he didn\u0027t want to move. Claire went away, and Steve decided that he should go looking for the proof keys soon, very soon, as soon as he stopped shaking.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/code-veronica-resident-evil-6/page-7.html","bookId":2461,"book":{"id":2461,"title":"Code: Veronica (Resident Evil #6)","description":"Storyline: Code: Veronica (Resident Evil #6) A desperate search for her missing brother once again pits Claire Redfield against the terrifying bioweapons of the Umbrella Corporation.
