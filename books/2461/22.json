He thought about circling the jet back, but decided against it; there was no point. If Alexia wasn\u0027t dead, his people would find out soon enough; hell, the world would find out soon enough. \"I hope you were in there, Redfield,\" he said softly, smiling a little. Of course he was; Chris wasn\u0027t bright enough or fast enough to have gotten out in time...... although he might be lucky enough. Wesker had to concede that much; Redfield had the luck of the devil. It was a shame about Alexia turning him down. She\u0027d been something, terrifying and evil, but definitely some - thing. His employers weren\u0027t going to be happy when he came back without her, and he couldn\u0027t blame them; they\u0027d shelled out plenty for the Rockfort attack, and he\u0027d practically promised them results.\\n\\n They\u0027ll live. If they don\u0027t like it, they can find them-selves a new boy. Trent, on the other hand...\\n\\n Wesker grimaced, not looking forward to their next meeting. He owed the man. After the Spencer fiasco, Trent had - quite literally - pulled his ass out of the fire, and arranged for him to be fixed up, better than new. And he\u0027d been responsible for Wesker\u0027s introduction to his current employers, men with real aspirations for power, and the means to ob - tain it.\\n\\n And...\\n\\n And he\u0027d never admit to it out loud, but Trent scared him. He was so smooth, well-mannered and soft-spo - ken, but with a glitter in his eyes that made him always seem to be laughing, like everything was a joke and he was the only one who got it. In Wesker\u0027s experience, the ones who laughed were the most dangerous; they didn\u0027t feel like they had anything to prove, and were usually at least slightly insane. I\u0027m just glad we\u0027re on the same side, Wesker assured himself, believing it because he wanted to. Because going up against someone like Trent was a bad, bad plan. Well. He could worry about Trent later, after he\u0027d made the proper apologies to the proper agents. At least Boyscout Redfield was dead, and he was still alive and kicking, working for the side that was going to win when all was said and done. Wesker smiled, looking forward to the end. It was going to be spectacular. The sun had come out and was reflecting against the snow, creating a brilliant radiance, blinding in its perfec-tion. The small plane shot away, its shadow chasing it across the sparkling plains. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/code-veronica-resident-evil-6/page-22.html","bookId":2461,"book":{"id":2461,"title":"Code: Veronica (Resident Evil #6)","description":"Storyline: Code: Veronica (Resident Evil #6) \\n A desperate search for her missing brother once again pits Claire Redfield against the terrifying bioweapons of the Umbrella Corporation.
