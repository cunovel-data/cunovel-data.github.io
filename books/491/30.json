{"id":23379,"no":30,"title":"Chapter XXIX","content":"RUTH BABCOCK was seated at the dresser curling her hair when her aunt entered the room. \"Going out tonight, Ruth?\" \"Yes, Mr. King and I are going to drive to Zala.\" \"Anything of interest going on?\" \"Yes, a very interesting affair—rather private—only a select few invited, you know.\" When her aunt left the room Ruth fell into a reverie. She thought of the past years of anxiety and hardship; they were behind her now. The last few months had removed so much of care and restored so much of the lightness of heart that she had known before her father was injured that she felt like a new creature. Jim Stover had been convicted of fraud and forgery and sentenced from ten to twenty years in the penitentiary. John Hinds, who was the principal witness against Stover, was sentenced to a short term in the penitentiary but was paroled on account of his poor health. Babcock and Watson had recovered through civil suits the value of the bank stock of which Stover had defrauded them. Mr. Babcock had been operated on by Dr. Lilly and had fully recovered. He now remembered every detail of the transaction by which Stover came into possession of the bank. With the return of his money and restored health he again engaged in business. As Ruth thought of the restored health of her father and the love of the strong young man who had been such a good friend and gallant suitor she felt that she had every reason to be thankful, and that there certainly never had lived a happier mortal than she. It was seven o\u0027clock when Harold called for her in his limousine. It was a balmy May evening. The breezes from the meadows and pastures were laden with the breath of wild flowers. Young rabbits hopped into the hedges along the way and occasionally a foolish one would get in front of the car and try to outrun it. A red bird in a hedge row was singing a blithe song. Harold stopped the car that they might enjoy the music. It was still light enough for them to discover the cause of his joy. He was singing to his mate, who as a good wife and homemaker, was on a nest nearby. As they rode past farm houses they heard the lowing of cattle and the bleating of sheep. When they passed near a pond they heard a bull-frog with a basso-profundo serenading his lady love. What a night for lovers! \"Harold,\" said Ruth, \"you remember that I won the three wishes when we pulled the wish bone?\" \"Yes, and I won the two.\" \"Mine have all come true.\" \"What were they? You told me that when they came true you would tell me.\" \"I wished that my father would get well; that you would land the hotel job at the capital, and that I would get an increase in wages. They all came true, but my increase in wages came from a different source than I had expected. Now you must tell me what your wishes were.\" \"Only one of mine has come true.\" \"What was it?\" she asked. \"I mustn\u0027t tell until the other one comes true. You know you said that if one told before all of the wishes came true the unfulfilled ones would not come true.\" \"I know I did, but I believe that part of the wish charm is superstition. I don\u0027t think it will make any difference. Come on and tell me.\" \"Oh, no, young lady, you don\u0027t work me like that. I am not taking any chances.\" When they arrived at Zala they drove at once to the parsonage where the old pastor who had preached Ruth\u0027s mother\u0027s funeral resided. A half dozen of Ruth\u0027s girl friends were at the gate to meet them. \"We have been here waiting for almost an hour,\" one of the girls said. In the minister\u0027s little study Ruth and Harold clasped hands, symbolizing the union of their lives in love, while their vows were being solemnized, which bound them—even unto death. On the way home Harold said, \"Now, Ruth, I can tell you the wishes; the other one has come true. I wished that I might be able to help your father secure the money that had been stolen from him, and I think you can guess what the other was.\" \"It must have been that you would get to Zala without having any engine trouble or puncturing a tire,\" she said, laughing. \"You are very dense, my darling, my wife,\" he said, as he put his arm around her and kissed her. \"Now be careful. You can\u0027t drive with one hand. You will run the car into the ditch,\" she cautioned. They were about half way back to Wilford Springs when Ruth exclaimed, \"Oh, look there, there\u0027s a fiery cross!\" \"It must be the Trenton Klan having a meeting.\" \"Isn\u0027t the cross beautiful and inspiring?\" \"Yes, and it represents a wonderful movement. A movement that will mean a better citizenship.\" \"Just what is the significance of the fiery cross? Of course I know that the cross is the symbol of the Christian religion, but why a fiery cross?\" \"The cross was made red with the blood of the Savior, the great Sacrifice for the sins of the world. As we behold this fiery cross we see in it the symbol of the love of God for humanity and the suggestion for unselfish service. There is also another meaning attached to it. It has a militant significance. It is the signal for the assembling of the Klansmen. \"In the old days in Scotland, when any great danger threatened their nation and it became necessary for the Klans to assemble for the defense of their country, a cross was made of wood and set afire. The fiery brand was then quenched in the blood of a sacrifice. The chief commander then gave the symbol to a Klansman to carry and pass to another, who in turn should carry it, and so on, until it had been carried through the territory of every Klan. The Klansman carrying this fiery cross would shout the name of the muster-place. No true Klansman who saw the cross and heard the muster-place called would fail to be at the gathering. And he to whom the runner passed the emblem must carry it on. \"Scott in his \u0027Lady of the Lake\u0027 shows the loyalty of the Klansmen and the women of the Klan. He tells of this summons to the gathering being carried into a home where the master of the house lay a corpse. The Klansman, to whom the cross was to have been passed, is dead, but his son takes his place. If I can recall the lines I will repeat them for you.\" After a moment of silence he quoted: \u0027All stand aghast: unheeding all, The henchman bursts into the hall; Before the dead man\u0027s bier he stood; Held forth the cross besmeared with blood; \"The muster-place is Lanrick mead; Speed forth the signal! Klansman, speed!\" Angus, the heir of Duncan\u0027s line, Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign. In haste the stripling to his side His father\u0027s dirk and broadsword tied; But when he saw his mother\u0027s eye Watch him in speechless agony, Back to her open\u0027d arms he flew, Pressed on her lips a fond adieu— \"Alas,\" she sobbed, \"and yet begone, And speed thee forth, like Duncan\u0027s son.\" He vanished and o\u0027er moor and moss Sped forward with the Fiery Cross.\u0027 \"Good,\" she said, \"that makes this emblem mean so much to me now.\" \"Fred,\" said Aunt Clara, \"it\u0027s almost eleven o\u0027clock. Ruth should be getting home.\" \"She will be back before long,\" Mr. Babcock replied. \"I expect Ruth and Mr. King will be getting married some of these times. She hasn\u0027t had anything to do with Mr. Golter since she quit work at the bank.\" \"And what\u0027s more, Clara, I don\u0027t want a girl of mine to have anything to do with that kind of stock.\" \"Golter has money, and that means a lot these days,\" Clara commented, and then added, \"but Mr. King has picked up wonderfully in the last few months.\" \"Harold King is a man,\" said Babcock. Footsteps were heard on the porch. \"There they come, now,\" said Clara. The door was thrown open and Ruth and Harold entered. \"Well, Miss Babcock,\" said her father, smiling, \"you have returned.\" \"No,\" she answered, \"Miss Babcock has not returned and never will return. Allow me to introduce my husband.\" \"What, you\u0027re not married!\" exclaimed Aunt Clara. \"Yes, didn\u0027t I tell you that a very interesting affair was to take place at Zala tonight?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89897.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
