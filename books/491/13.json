{"id":23362,"no":13,"title":"Chapter XII","content":"A GROUP of white robed figures were gathered on the summit of White Eagle mound. A great fiery cross was visible for many miles. Many of the citizens of Wilford Springs who had recently read in The Journal that the Klan was dead beheld with amazement the fiery emblem—got into their cars and drove along the road near the mound that they might get a close-up view of the cross and if possible gain some idea of the number of Klansmen who were assembled. The reports that circulated on the street the following day varied greatly, the numbers ranging from five hundred to a thousand. It was an important meeting and a large per cent of the members of Wilford Springs Klan (which now actually numbered eight hundred) were present, together with a few visiting Klansmen from neighboring Klans. It was an impressive sight for the occupants of the cars on the road when the white robed figures on the mound kneeled in a circle around the fiery cross. The Reverend Benton led the prayer. The minister, clad in the white robe which symbolizes purity, kneeling there beneath the star-lit heavens in the flickering light of the fiery cross (that signal for gathering and emblem of militant Christianity) poured out his soul in earnest supplication to Him, the all wise and loving Father: \"Lord, we bow before Thee in humble recognition of Thy power and goodness. We thank Thee, as citizens of a great republic, for the blessings and opportunities that Thou hast granted us. We thank Thee for our country; for our churches; our homes; our free schools; and our pure womanhood. \"Dear Heavenly Father, we thank Thee above all else that Thou didst send Thy Son Jesus Christ into the world \u0027to give life and to give it more abundantly.\u0027 \"Lord, help us to stand courageously for our country, its institutions and laws. Teach us our duty to our fellow man. Lead us into larger fields of usefulness and in the great conflict of righteousness against sin may we be dedicated to Thy cause in body, in mind, in spirit and in life. \"All wise Judge, as we are called upon to pass judgement on our fellow man, may Thy spirit of love prevail, and in our decisions may we be guided by Thine unerring judgment. \"Lord, we pray Thee to bless this group of men and the homes of our community. We humbly beseech Thee to be with us as we pray together in the language which the Christ who died for us taught us to pray: \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\" As the seven hundred men on the mound united their voices in the Lord\u0027s prayer the people in the cars heard and many were filled with awe and wonder. Many who had honestly believed that the Klan was an organization of undesirables were astonished. Mr. Henry Agnew, a Catholic, who was an exemplary citizen and highly respected, remarked to his wife when the \"amen\" had been pronounced, \"Mary, my suspicions and fears that the Ku Kluxers are a menace to the community is considerably lessened since seeing that large body of men kneel in prayer.\" The prayer concluded, all stood. Judge Rider, the exalted Cyclops, said: \"Klansmen, we have an important matter to come before the Klan tonight. You will each be called on to render an important decision and I ask you to listen attentively to the proceedings and render your verdict according to the evidence. Klaliff, you have some important matters to present.\" \"I have, Your Excellency.\" \"You may present the matter to the Klan.\" \"The Kladd will present Klansman Tom Glynn at the Exalted Cyclops station.\" When the Kladd brought Glynn before the Exalted Cyclops, King, the Klaliff, said: \"Klansmen, some time ago it became known to your Klaliff that the identity of Klansmen was being made known to men not Klansmen. The matter was reported promptly to your Exalted Cyclops. A secret investigation was made, and the movements of a number of Klansmen were closely observed. Klansman Glynn was seen to go directly to a room after a number of Klan meetings and confer with Pat McBryan. Will Klansmen Sam Bronson and Ned Fields come forward?\" The two Klansmen came forward and testified to Glynn\u0027s conferences with McBryan. \"The next morning after these conferences McBryan and other men were known to be in possession of information of inside affairs of the Klan. \"One day when slips were passed to Klansmen giving some valuable information a photographer succeeded in taking a very interesting snapshot. I will ask a number of Klansmen to look at the picture and write on a slip of paper what you see without conferring with each other.\" Six Klansmen who were designated for this purpose examined the picture carefully and then wrote their observations. Four of them stated that the two men in the picture were Glynn and McBryan and that they were consulting a Klan information slip. The other two stated that one of the men was Glynn, that they did not know the other man and that they were looking at the Klan information slip which Glynn held in his hand. The Klaliff read these reports and then said: \"Your Excellency, that is all the evidence we have to offer.\" \"Klansman Glynn, do you wish to offer a defense or make a statement?\" the Exalted Cyclops asked. \"I have nothing to say except that I gave the information.\" \"Why did you do this?\" the Exalted Cyclops asked. \"I did it to help the Holy Catholic Church.\" \"Are you a Catholic?\" \"I was raised a Catholic. I do not now consider myself a Catholic, but I believe in The Holy Roman Church and am glad to serve her.\" \"Glynn, who asked you to do this?\" \"I refuse to answer.\" \"Klansmen, you have heard the charge and the evidence and Klansman Glynn\u0027s confession of guilt. What say you, shall Tom Glynn be expelled from this organization?\" The vote was unanimous for expulsion. \"Tom Glynn,\" said Cyclops Judge Rider, \"you were received into this organization in good faith. You pretended to act in good faith. You took a sacred and solemn obligation to support the principles that all Klansmen are obligated to support. On the open Bible and before God you promised loyalty to Klansmen and the organization. You have confessed to violating that oath and give as a reason that you did it to assist the Catholic Church. \"It must be a strange religious conscience that will permit one to hypocritically take the obligations of a patriotic and benevolent organization for the purpose of assisting the church of his choice. The information you furnished was of value only to law violators and designing politicians, and could not possibly be of any value to a church that has no other motives than to spread the religion of Jesus Christ. \"You are now clad in the white robe of a Klansman. This robe was made white to represent purity of thought and actions, which it is the purpose of the Klan to promote. You, Tom Glynn, have disgraced this robe by your act of perfidy. You will take it off.\" Glynn removed the robe and handed it to the Exalted Cyclops. \"No true Klansman would want to wear this robe that has been disgraced by you, consequently I consign it to the flames.\" A Klansman applied a lighted torch and no one spoke as the robe was being consumed by the flames. When it had been reduced to ashes, the Judge continued. \"As the robe which you might have worn in honor has vanished so your relationship to this organization has ceased. \"If perchance in the future you behold upon some hill the fiery cross may it say to you, \u0027That they who worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\u0027 \"Guards, you will escort the expelled member to the public road.\" So Tom Glynn was conducted out of the presence of the seven hundred Klansmen and was no longer a member of the Invisible Empire. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89880.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
