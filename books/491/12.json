{"id":23361,"no":12,"title":"Chapter XI","content":"RUTH was proud that her friend, Harold King, had courageously turned his back on the proposition that would have meant the prostitution of his manhood. She was not altogether happy—it is always a great shock to discover a lack of principle in one in whom you have had great confidence. Ruth had regarded Stover not only as a friend but as a man of exceptional honor. To say that the discovery that he would try to bribe a man to do a dishonorable thing shocked her, is to put it mildly. When she next saw Harold she said, \"I tried not to hear your conversation with Mr. Stover, but you both got to talking so loudly that I could not help it. Harold, I am certainly proud of you.\" \"I would have liked to have had the job but not at the price they asked. I will get along some way. If I can\u0027t make a living as an architect I can go to work on the railroad section.\" \"I have faith that you will succeed as an architect, but I would much prefer to have a friend of mine an honorable section hand than a dishonorable architect, no matter how successful he might be in his profession.\" \"Ruth,\" he said, \"it is good to have a friend like you. You are different from so many girls who think so much of display and veneer. You think more of the things that are really worth while.\" \"I feel that I do not deserve all that, Harold. My father deserves a great deal of credit for whatever views of life I have that enable me to appraise people by a better standard than bank accounts, automobiles, clothes, painted faces, and dance steps. He has always laid great stress on the value of character. Often I have heard him say, \u0027The real gold of life is not to be found in mines or at the end of the rainbow but in hearts that are true to friends and loyal to the best interests of life.\u0027\" \"That is certainly a noble sentiment. How is your father?\" \"I don\u0027t see much change in him. He worries so much because he can\u0027t remember the man who stole his money. Ever since he had that dream he really believes that some man in whom he had confidence and to whom he had shown the combination of the safe really robbed him. (Of course it is only a delusion.) His bank stock, the only property he had except the home, was turned over to satisfy his debts.\" \"Ruth, in whom did your father have a great deal of confidence?\" \"Do you mean in a business way? Well, there were a number of men in Zala for whose honesty and ability he had great respect. Of the men out of town with whom he had business relations, I believe he trusted Mr. Stover more than any other.\" \"Ruth, who was the cashier of the bank in which your father was president?\" \"His name is Dick Watson.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"I don\u0027t know. He left Wilford Springs when Mr. Stover bought my father\u0027s interest, and I have not heard of him since.\" \"Do you suppose that it is possible that Watson defrauded your father?\" \"No, my father\u0027s account at the bank tallied with his personal pass book. His bank stock was sold to Mr. Stover, as you know.\" \"What did Watson do with his stock?\" \"He owned only a small amount of stock, and it also was purchased by Mr. Stover.\" \"What kind of a looking fellow is this man, Watson?\" \"He is fairly good looking.\" Harold laughed. \"When you ask a girl about a man\u0027s looks she answers: \u0027Handsome, good looking, fairly good looking, homely, ugly or ugly as a mud fence.\u0027\" \"That\u0027s because we think so much of looks, I presume,\" she said, laughing, \"or it may be because we are so limited in descriptive powers, but since you do not like my general statement I will try to be a little more specific. He is about five feet nine or ten inches in height, has light brown hair and dark blue eyes, his nose is rather prominent, when he smiles he displays a row of exceedingly white, even teeth. Is that sufficient?\" \"Very good. I believe you will be able to develop your descriptive powers.\" \"Why should I?\" \"Well you may want to write novels some day.\" \"If I do I will have you for one of the characters. You will be my hero.\" \"I see that you will not succeed as a novelist.\" \"Why?\" \"You have already shown sufficiently poor judgment in selecting a character to condemn you as a novelist; however, you might succeed as descriptive writer. I will test you a little farther. Did the man Watson have any peculiarities?\" \"Nothing that I remember, except he lisped slightly.\" \"Speaking of descriptions,\" he remarked, \"there is a scene that I would like to have descriptive power to describe.\" They were walking through the City\u0027s Natural Park and had come suddenly upon a little lake surrounded by wooded hills. It was the first of October, and nature\u0027s artist had tinted the foliage a rich golden hue. Two couples in row boats were rowing along the shaded side of the lake while shimmering light was reflected from the opposite side. The deep green of the grass which bordered the lake, the gold of the tree foliage, the blue of the sky above and the passing clouds mirrored in the water blended in a harmonious picture that no lover of beauty could fail to admire. \"Isn\u0027t it beautiful!\" Ruth exclaimed. \"Yes, as Riley says, \u0027A picture that no painter has the colorin\u0027 to mock.\u0027\" They walked on down a winding road, through the woods and around the hills. Ruth began humming, \"There\u0027s a long, long trail a winding into the land of my dreams.\" \"That song has a lot of truth in it,\" he remarked. \"The road is often a long one, and the night seems so long while waiting.\" \"Yes, but the song also expresses the pleasure that many enjoy while pursuing the dreams and traveling with \u0027you.\u0027 It depends a lot on who the \u0027you\u0027 is.\" It was a pleasant October afternoon and there were many people riding and strolling through the park. Harold was thankful that it was cool enough for him to wear his light overcoat. A car honked behind them and they stepped out of the road. Golter drove past. He lifted his hat and spoke very distantly. Ruth had declined an invitation to go riding with him that afternoon. \"Your special friend,\" Harold remarked. \"Don\u0027t put too much emphasis on the special if you would be exact in your expression,\" she replied. As they were leaving the park they met two young ladies. \"Why, Ruth, for the land sakes! I haven\u0027t seen you for a coon\u0027s age.\" \"Mable, I certainly am glad to see you! What are you doing here?\" \"I am visiting my cousin. Miss Babcock, my cousin, Miss Welty.\" \"And allow me to introduce my friend, Mr. King.\" After the formal recognitions of the introductions, Ruth said, \"Mable, I haven\u0027t seen you since you moved to the capital.\" \"No. This is the first time I have been any place.\" Mable Finch and Ruth had been friends at Zala. Soon after Ruth came to Wilford Springs, Mable had moved with her parents to the state capital. \"How are your folk?\" \"They are well. Father sticks right to business. Mother and I tried to get him to go to the Shriners\u0027 convention this summer, but he thinks that the business wouldn\u0027t run if he were away.\" \"Is your father still in the hotel business?\" \"Yes; you couldn\u0027t get him to do anything else. He is planning to build the largest and finest hotel in the city.\" \"Will he build soon?\" \"Yes, he expects to consider plans at once.\" Harold and Miss Welty had walked a short distance away to look at a petrified tree that had recently been donated to the park and were out of hearing. \"That\u0027s a swell looking beau you are with,\" said Mable. \"He is a splendid fellow and a very dear friend.\" \"He certainly looks good.\" \"Mable, I want you to visit me while you are here.\" \"I wish I could, but it will be impossible. I just ran down for the week-end with my cousin, but I\u0027ll tell you what I want you to do. Will you do it?\" \"Well,\" said Ruth, \"it will depend just a little on what it is.\" Both girls giggled. \"I want you to go home with me for a visit. This week we are to have our fall musical festival.\" \"I am going to surprise you by accepting the invitation. That is, provided I can get off at the bank where I work.\" Harold and Mable\u0027s cousin now rejoined them and the four left the park with the crowd that was now homeward bound. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89879.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
