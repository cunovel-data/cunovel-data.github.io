{"id":23370,"no":21,"title":"Chapter XX","content":"STOVER called a caucus of the faithful. They met in the rear room at Hennesy\u0027s place. The curtains were drawn on the two windows next to the alley. Stover, Hennesy, Goldberg, McBryan and Springer were present. Stover was elected to act as president of the caucus. They did not intend to keep a record of their proceedings, consequently they did not need a secretary. \"Hennesy,\" said McBryan, \"since you are the host here, wouldn\u0027t it be in keeping with the rules of good society if you were to serve refreshments?\" \"You can have anything you want. Nothing would please me better than to \u0027liquor up\u0027 my friends. What will you take?\" \"Whiskey for me,\" said McBryan. \"I believe I\u0027ll take a leetle whiskey, too,\" Goldberg chimed in. Springer ordered beer. Stover remarked, \"Boys, you know I never drink.\" Hennesy then stepped to the door connecting the bar room with the rear conference room. \"Jim,\" he called to his porter, \"bring two whiskeys and two bottles of beer.\" After the liquor had been consumed they were ready for business. \"Boys,\" said Stover, \"something must be done or we are going to lose this election.\" \"Vat make you tink so?\" asked Goldberg. \"There is no getting around the fact that the Klan is strong in this county and section of the state. They have strong candidates. You stand out on the street any day and listen to the conversations on political matters, and about two out of every three men who express themselves are for the Klan candidates,\" Stover replied. \"You are right,\" said McBryan. \"I heard a bunch of fellows talking down at Zala the other day, and it\u0027s the same thing down there.\" \"I thought you tell us in the Journal there was only a few Klansmen. Hey, Springer, vat you say?\" \"Goldberg, you don\u0027t suppose I would add to the influence of the Klan by telling the public through my paper that there are between eight hundred and a thousand Klansmen in Wilford Springs.\" \"You have brains, Springer, almost brains; that would have been poor bezness, very poor bezness,\" exclaimed Goldberg. \"There are a lot of people who want to be on the winning side, and if they thought that the Klan had any strength they would line up with them. Keep on telling the people that there are only a few of them here,\" remarked McBryan. \"Stover,\" said Springer, \"you want to see to it that the mayor doesn\u0027t allow the Klan to pull off a parade here. It makes too much of an impression on the public for a thousand of those masked devils to march through the streets,\" said Springer. \"I\u0027ll \u0027tend to that,\" replied Stover, \"don\u0027t you worry for a single minute about the Klan\u0027s having a parade or a public speaking within the city limits.\" \"If those \u0027night gown boys\u0027 with the pillow slips over their heads get to parading here some of us had just as well shut up shop. A lot of our men are scared now. If you want to throw a scare into the average bootlegger all you have to do is mention Kluxers,\" Hennesy remarked. \"Well, boys, now is the time to get rid of this foolishness, and if we whip these midnight riders right good in this election we will have gone a long way in checking them. On the other hand, if they succeed in electing a majority of their candidates they are going to be wonderfully strengthened, and it is liable to be very unpleasant for certain lines of business.\" As Stover delivered this speech he rubbed his hands together, as was his custom when anything of importance was being discussed. \"Vat have you to suggest; vat will help mit the eleckshun?\" Isaac Goldberg asked. \"I believe it would be a good plan,\" said Springer, \"if we would get Governor Slydell to make a speaking tour in this part of the state. While the Governor is not himself a candidate, he is backing Perdue strong for governor, and Perdue has announced that he will carry out Slydell\u0027s policies if elected.\" \"I am of the opinion that your suggestion is a good one, Springer. Sam Slydell is a good campaigner, and he is strong against the Klan. He will do us some good if we can get him to make half a dozen speeches in this part of the state, but that isn\u0027t enough—we must do something more than that if we win,\" remarked McBryan. \"Can\u0027t you get Father Rossini busy lining up all Catholic voters whom you cannot reach through the Knights of Columbus?\" asked Stover. \"Father Rossini is already busy,\" replied McBryan. \"Last week the bishop called all the priests in this diocese together for a conference. Here are the candidates they endorsed.\" McBryan reached in his pocket and drew out a slip of paper. \"Every one of them is anti-Klan and five of them are Catholics. Father Rossini says that all of the priests went home from the conference enthusiastic for these men. You can count on the solid support of all Catholics. What we do not get through the Knights of Columbus the priests will look after.\" \"Goldberg, what plan have you for lining up the Jews?\" Stover asked. \"That\u0027s easy, easy, Mr. Stover—we have the B\u0027nai B\u0027rith organization. In twenty-four hours I gets in touch wid every Jew in the state. In forty-eight hours every Jew in the United States can be informed of any matters our great organization vish to put pefore them. I will see that every Jew in this congressional district receives instruction tomorrow. I tinks that you can\u0027t work any faster through your Knights of Columbus than that.\" He directed this last remark to McBryan. \"That\u0027s all well enough,\" said McBryan, \"but you must remember that this Ku Klux Klan is a powerful organization. It\u0027s an un-American organization purposing to control politics and keep Catholics and Jews out of office. I feel that we would be warranted in using extreme measures to defeat them.\" \"Have you anything else to suggest?\" Stover asked. \"I think we should do something to cause the general public to turn against the Klan. The mayor of Freeburg is a Catholic. What would be the effect if between now and election a number of Kluxers would take him out and whip him?\" \"That would make bezness goot for our candidates,\" said Isaac. \"What do you mean, McBryan?\" asked Springer. \"I mean—just suppose some Klansmen would take Mayor Krouse out and whip him, what would the public say?\" asked McBryan. \"The public would say that it was a damned outrage,\" said Springer. \"Can it be arranged? Would Krouse stand for it?\" \"Of course he will. He is a Catholic and a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. I can arrange it with him all right,\" assured McBryan. \"It will not be necessary to actually whip him,\" said Hennesy. \"A few stripes made with a little paint across his back and a photograph made by Croskey and the witness of a few of the boys whom we can trust, is all that we need.\" \"Fine! Hennesy, your head is working,\" said Springer. \"That\u0027s a fine idea. Krouse being a foreigner and a Catholic, the public will never question that the Klan did it. Mac, you make the arrangements with Krouse. When this thing has been pulled off, Springer, you will have a chance to tell the public of the outrage. I will ask Governor Slydell to make a speaking trip through this part of the state. Hennesy, you must look after the dealers in \u0027wet goods.\u0027\" As Stover spoke his skinny hands were busy with each other and his most assuring smile played about his mouth. \"I\u0027ll have no trouble with the liquor fraternity. They know that if the Klan candidates are elected their \u0027cake is dough,\u0027\" Hennesy remarked. Hennesy ordered whiskey and all but Stover drank to the success of the campaign, before separating. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89888.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
