{"id":23378,"no":29,"title":"Chapter XXVIII","content":"THE next day after Stover\u0027s arrest the town was in a furore. The man who had for years been looked upon as one of Wilford Springs\u0027 most successful business men had been charged with a felony. Groups of excited people met on the street corners discussing the case. The Eagle stated the facts in connection with Stover\u0027s arrest without any editorial comment. The Journal stated that the arrest of \"Jim Stover, Wilford Springs\u0027 most distinguished citizen, was spite work by Klan leaders and a girl who had been discharged from Stover\u0027s employ.\" The Reverend Earl Benton had just finished reading of Stover\u0027s arrest when his door bell rang. Mrs. Benton went to the door and admitted a young lady who asked to see Rev. Benton. Mrs. Benton showed the young lady into the pastor\u0027s study. \"Rev. Benton, I am Pearl Gardner,\" she said by way of introduction. \"Have a chair, Miss Gardner. What can I do for you?\" \"I wanted to talk to you about a certain matter. I came to you because you are the only person I know whom I was sure belongs to the Ku Klux Klan. I wanted to talk to a Klansman.\" \"I have stated in a number of public lectures that I belong to the Klan.\" \"I had heard that you said that you belong to the Klan and as I wanted to get the help of the Klan, I came to you.\" \"I will be pleased to carry your message to the Klan if it appears that that organization can be of any service to you.\" \"I think it can. I have been keeping company with a young man by the name of Chester Golter. We are engaged to be married but he refuses to keep the engagement.\" \"What did you want the Klan to do in the matter?\" \"I thought if a letter were written to him telling him that if he didn\u0027t keep his promise to me he would be visited by Ku Kluxers that he would marry me.\" \"Has he actually refused to marry you?\" \"Not in so many words. He used to keep company with another girl who worked in the bank. Her name is Ruth Babcock. Since we have been engaged I have seen a letter she wrote to him. I discovered by the contents of this letter that he had asked her for her company after he had told me that he did not care for her and would not go with her again. She told him in this letter very positively that she would not go with him. Of course I was offended and refused to go with him to a show the following night. Since then he has gone with another girl several times and has said that he does not know whether we should get married or not; that he is afraid we are not compatible. He is afraid of the Klan and if he had a threatening letter from the Ku Kluxers he would keep his promise to me.\" \"My dear young lady,\" said the minister, \"you do not understand the work of this organization. The Klan does not write threatening letters, nor visit anyone for the purpose of coercing them. That is a mistaken idea that many have. Not long ago a woman came to me asking that I get the Klan to chase her husband out of town. She said he was worthless and she wanted to get rid of him. A man came to me and told me that he thought that if the Klan would give his uncle a right good whipping it might improve his conduct. It isn\u0027t strange that so many people have this mistaken idea of the mission of the Klan. The newspapers have printed so much of alleged threats and punishments by Klans that many have believed them. The Klan is not a punitive organization except as it assists officers in the enforcement of the law by furnishing evidence and giving the officers its moral support. If this young man positively refuses to marry you, of course, you have recourse in the courts. You can sue him for breach of promise.\" \"Then the Klan won\u0027t write a letter to him threatening to visit him if he doesn\u0027t many me?\" \"I am sure it would not. Maybe a little more sweetness and graciousness on your part would bring the young gentleman around all right?\u0027 \"Well, I will be going. I thank you.\" The clergyman walked to the door and as she passed out he said, \"I trust your affair with this young man may terminate satisfactorily for you, but remember this: there can be no true marriage relation except two hearts are bound captive to each other with a golden chain of love.\" After his caller had gone Rev. Benton informed his wife that he was going to town. \"Remember, dear, that you have to conduct a funeral this afternoon. You must be back promptly at noon for your lunch.\" \"I remember the funeral and will be here at twelve. These funerals are sad, gloomy occasions in the life of a minister.\" \"A funeral is always sad whether one is in the ministry or not, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Usually, but a funeral service might bring a great deal of pleasure to a minister.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It would afford me a great deal of pleasure to preach the funeral sermon over the remains of some of the brothers who are continually knocking, or of the sisters who are always suffering from the \u0027hoof and mouth disease.\u0027\" \"Tut, tut, my dear,\" his wife replied, shaking her finger at him, \"to hear you talk one would think you have some members in your flock whom you do not love.\" \"Well, to tell the truth,\" he said, laughing, \"I have a few members who would be so much more lovable dead.\" \"What a boy you are.\" She lifted her face toward his and he kissed her fervently. As she stood watching him walk down the street she noticed that his step was not quite so sprightly as it had been when they were married thirty-five years before and that his shoulders were beginning to bow under the burdens of life. She rejoiced that while his body was aging his heart and spirits retained their youthfulness. As the minister passed Isaac Goldberg\u0027s place the little Jew called to him from his door. \"Shust a minute, Reverend, I vonts to speak to you.\" \"All right, Mr. Goldberg. What is it?\" \"I understand dat the Klan is going to build a beeg klavern. Is dat right?\" \"Yes, the plans are all drawn and work will begin at once.\" \"How much the cost?\" \"Ten thousand dollars.\" \"Vel, vel, dot is lots of money. If the Klan vants to borry some moneys Isaac has it to loan. And I shust ask only 10 per cent.\" \"Isaac, would you loan money to the Klan?\" \"I loan money shust as quick to the Klan as to the Knights of Columbus.\" \"I thank you for the offer, but I am quite sure that the Klan will be able to finance this building without any outside help.\" \"Vel, remember Isaac has moneys to loan—on goot security, of course; alvays on goot security.\" A little way farther down the street Rev. Benton met Mr. Jackson. \"Good morning, Reverend.\" \"How are you, Jackson?\" \"Reverend Benton, what do you think of Stover\u0027s arrest?\" \"Well, I have never had a very exalted opinion of Stover, but I had not suspected him of being a thief.\" \"It looks bad for him, but he may be able to come clear. I hope he does.\" \"Well, I do, too. While I have never been an admirer of Stover I would regret very much to know that he had robbed a man who has become an invalid and dependent on his daughter for support.\" \"If he did defraud Babcock and then discharged his daughter who was supporting her father and aunt because she was keeping company with Harold King whom he had a personal grudge against, as reported, there aren\u0027t adjectives strong enough to use in condemning him.\" Jackson spoke with feeling. \"I know that he discharged the girl because she was keeping company with Harold King but, of course, I know nothing about the charges of fraud.\" Springer now came by and Jackson stopped him with the question, \"Springer, what do you think about this Stover affair?\" \"I think just what I stated in the Journal, that Stover\u0027s arrest is a piece of spite work.\" There was quite a crowd collected now and someone asked, \"Who was the girl you referred to in the article in the paper?\" \"Ruth Babcock who had been discharged by Stover.\" \"Oh, yes. Wasn\u0027t she the girl that published the affidavit in regard to the Rastus Jones affair?\" another man asked. \"Yes, she has been playing into the hands of the Klan all along.\" Springer showed embarrassment in his voice and manner. His feeling was of the same nature as when that affidavit was published. \"Who is back of this prosecution?\" another asked. \"Harold King,\" Springer replied. \"If Harold King is responsible for it you can rest assured that it is not spite work. Harold King is every inch a man, and while he may not be friendly to Stover he would not stoop to do a dishonorable act. If he was instrumental in causing Stover\u0027s arrest he has some proofs.\" Rev. Benton spoke in a positive voice. \"Some of the other Klan leaders may have made him think that there was some evidence against Stover and used him as a tool. They have to make a goat of someone,\" Springer remarked. \"Harold King isn\u0027t the kind that they make a goat of,\" said Jackson, \"he has a mind of his own.\" \"This is one of the consequences of that detestable Klan. It is causing trouble all over the country. I have repeatedly warned the people of this danger through the columns of the Journal.\" \"Springer, in just what way is the Klan causing trouble?\" Jackson asked. \"Haven\u0027t you been reading in the paper about the riots that have occurred in many places where Klan meetings are held?\" \"Yes, I have been reading of some attacks being made on Klan meetings and Klan parades. It seems that in every instance the Klan members were assaulted, and that the Klan did nothing to provoke the riots.\" \"Well, it doesn\u0027t make any difference who the aggressors were, the Klan is to blame; if they had not been holding meetings and having parades there wouldn\u0027t have been any riots and bloodshed. This Klan organization arouses such bitter feeling that the only sane and safe thing is for them to disorganize.\" \"Springer,\" said Rev. Benton, \"if I understand you correctly you take the position that the Klan antagonizes certain groups and for that reason the Klan should disorganize?\" \"Yes. That is about right. This Klan movement stirs up so much bitterness that its very existence is a menace to the peace and safety of the country. It doesn\u0027t make any difference what the principles of the Klan are, it stirs up strife and for that reason has no right to exist.\" \"Springer, I am surprised at you. You, who are supposed to be a leader of thought and a molder of public opinion in the community.\" It was the Rev. Benton who now addressed Springer. There were by this time forty or fifty men in the crowd and all listened attentively while the minister spoke. \"I want you men to see just how reasonable or unreasonable this argument of our friend Springer is. He says that the Klan should be disorganized because it stirs up bitter opposition. If this argument is good then the Christian Church should have been disorganized in the first centuries, as it was bitterly opposed by the pagans and the Roman government. Christians were burned at the stake and made to fight with wild beasts in the arena. The Masonic order should have been abolished in the days of its youth if Springer\u0027s argument is good, for certainly the Masonic order stirred up opposition. Then, there have existed various temperance organizations that should have been suppressed because they stirred up bitter opposition from whiskey dealers and manufacturers. According to your argument all of the cats should go out of business because the rats don\u0027t like them to guard the pantry.\" This last remark was greeted by uproarious laughter from most of the crowd. Hisses from a few. \"Eat him up, preacher,\" a large man on the edge of the crowd shouted. \"That\u0027s right, we\u0027re for you,\" came from a number. Springer turned to Scripture to defend his position. \"I believe it\u0027s better to use love and forbearance. Didn\u0027t Paul say, \u0027If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend\u0027; and didn\u0027t Christ teach the doctrine of non-resistance and say, \u0027Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\u0027? I believe in the policy of non-resistance in the spirit of love. Since the Klan gives offense to my brother—if I were a Klansman I would give it up.\" (\"That\u0027s right, Springer, you\u0027ve told it to him right,\" a fourth degree Knight of Columbus exclaimed.) \"I believe in the doctrine of love and forebearance, too, but I also believe in loyalty to principle. (The minister spoke in a well controlled voice but with great earnestness.) When Paul spoke of not eating meat if it caused his brother to offend he was speaking of meat that had been offered to idols. It would give offense to some to eat this meat and would do no violence to the conscience of any Christian to refrain from eating it. \"When Christ said, \u0027Resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on one cheek turn to him the other also,\u0027 he was repudiating the doctrine of \u0027An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u0027 Nowhere did Christ or Paul teach that one should surrender principles of truth and righteousness in case someone became offended because of his advocacy. Christ knew that His principles would stir up bitter opposition and said, \u0027Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace but a sword.\u0027 Christ himself used force to clear the temple of the money changers, and I haven\u0027t any idea that those grafters whose game was interfered with liked it. It is the fellow whose game is being interfered with by the Klan who is raising a big hullabaloo. I am a lover of peace, but if my advocacy of the tenets of the Christian religion, of the separation of church and state, free schools, pure womanhood, freedom of speech and the press, the up-holding of the constitution of the United States is an offense to any individual or group of individuals—native or foreign-born—let them be offended. I repeat it—let them be offended. \"As a method of judging the genuine from the spurious, Christ said, \u0027By their fruits ye shall know them.\u0027 What are the fruits of this organization which you despise? It has done much benevolent work in the way of assisting individuals and worthy institutions. It is establishing hospitals and orphan homes. It has assisted in enforcement of law in many localities; it has created more respect for law and encouraged church attendance and——\" \"Let me in here,\" someone demanded. The minister stopped in the middle of a sentence and turned in the direction of the authoritative voice. He saw McMichael elbowing his way through the crowd to the center of the ring where his friend Springer and himself were facing each other. \"Benton, your damn Klan has played hell in this community.\" The lawyer spoke in a loud, harsh voice. \"You seem to be excited. What is the trouble?\" the minister asked. \"Trouble enough. Now that we have Dan Brown as sheriff, Stanton as county attorney and Rider as judge, all of them Klansmen, life and property will not be safe in Wilford Springs and there will be no justice.\" \"You are mistaken, Mr. McMichael. Bootleggers and gamblers are objecting now because they are getting justice.\" \"No one can get justice in a community where there are Klan officials. If I were governor of this state, do you know what I would do?\" \"No, I don\u0027t have any idea what you would do as governor,\" the minister replied. \"Well, sir, I\u0027ll tell you what I would do. I\u0027d put every town that has Klan officers under martial law until the people of the town forced the Klan officials to resign.\" \"Well, Mr. McMichael,\" said Benton, laughing, \"if you were governor and should attempt to coerce the people and trample upon their sacred rights in such a despotic manner, I fear that you wouldn\u0027t long remain governor; but would soon join the ranks of the has-beens along with ex-governor Slydell and others who made fools of themselves.\" The crowd laughed and applauded and the minister made his way through the crowd and started for home. As Rev. Benton and Mr. Jackson walked up the street together they met a dapper young man and a girl of the flapper type. \"That is Chester Golter, Stover\u0027s nephew,\" Jackson volunteered. \"I have heard of him but have never seen him to know who he was before. And who is the young lady with him?\" \"Her name is Gladys Glendenning. She has been here for a few weeks teaching dancing lessons.\" The following day Rev. Benton saw in the paper an account of the marriage of Gladys Glendenning to Chester Golter and a few days later notice of a breach of promise suit brought against Chester Golter by Pearl Gardner who asked twenty thousand dollars as heart balm. Later he heard that the case was settled out of court for three thousand dollars. \"I wouldn\u0027t think that a heart that has been wounded through misplaced love could be repaired by payment of money,\" remarked Mrs. Benton. \"My dear, money can not heal a heart wound that is very deep,\" replied the minister, and then added, \"a girl who would ask to have her fiance frightened into keeping his engagement is entirely lacking in true love upon which real homes are built and which binds hearts together through both sunshine and storm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89896.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
