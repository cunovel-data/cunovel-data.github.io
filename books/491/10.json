{"id":23359,"no":10,"title":"Chapter IX","content":"THE door between Ruth\u0027s office and the president\u0027s office was slightly ajar. She could hear the suppressed voices of Stover and another man. She caught a sentence that caused her to leave her desk and tiptoe to the door. She stood with her ear near the opening. Ruth had a high sense of honor. She would have been the last one to eavesdrop through idle curiosity. The sentence which she caught convinced her the conversation taking place on the other side of the door concerned her indirectly, if not directly, and she felt warranted in listening. She listened with bated breath while the color left her cheeks. She opened and shut her hands nervously. When the conversation ceased and Stover\u0027s caller left she sat down to her desk and wrote a note. She looked at her watch; it was almost quitting time. She stepped to the president\u0027s office. \"Is there anything more tonight?\" \"No, Ruth, nothing more tonight. You may go if you wish to.\" She went back into her room, tore up the lengthy note that she had written and wrote a very brief one. After she had placed this in an envelope and addressed it, she put on her hat and went out on the street. She had walked but a short way from the bank when she met a small boy. \"Say, boy, will you deliver this note for me?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" She gave him a dime and he hurried away on his errand. Harold King had seen but little of Ruth in the last two weeks. He had been busy getting up a perspective and plans to submit to the mayor and commissioners. He had seen Ruth a couple of times lately in ice cream parlors with Golter. That afternoon Harold had submitted his drawing and plans. Now that he had submitted them he wondered if anything would come of it. The architect\u0027s fee would be fifteen thousand dollars for this city job. If he could just land that his financial embarrassment would be relieved and he would be sufficiently advertised to get other good jobs. He had been three years in Wilford Springs, and had barely made a living. There had been many expensive buildings erected since he came, but out-of-town architects had been employed. Sometimes he had been discouraged and felt a desire to seek a new location, but his friend, Charles Wilson, would always tell him at such times: \"Stay with it and things will come your way; just keep a stiff upper lip. When you get a job, no matter how little it is, do your best and some day the big jobs will be running after you.\" Harold was inclined to question this philosophy, but nevertheless it encouraged him somewhat. Ruth Babcock had had a large place in his thoughts since he had met her two years before. He admired her and was sure if he would allow himself to he would love her—but what right did he have to allow himself to fall in love with a girl when he couldn\u0027t properly provide for his own needs! He had felt bitter pangs of jealousy when he had seen Ruth with Golter. He didn\u0027t blame her for accepting the attentions of someone who had an income sufficient to take her out in public and properly entertain her, one who had a right to entertain thoughts of love and matrimony—but he didn\u0027t like this man Golter and wished that she would not keep company with him. Golter was a snob and in no sense a man that appealed to men, but deep down in his heart Harold knew that he would be unhappy to see Ruth escorted by any man. If he wasn\u0027t so poverty stricken he wouldn\u0027t stand back for anyone. His best suit was hardly decent to appear in at social affairs. He would not, in his present condition, embarrass Ruth by asking her to accompany him any place, but maybe fortune would soon smile on him. If he landed the city job and the fifteen thousand dollars, things would be different. His reverie was interrupted by a small boy who entered the office and asked, \"This Mr. King?\" \"Yes.\" \"Here\u0027s a letter for you. A young lady sent it to you.\" \"Was she good looking?\" asked Harold, smiling. \"You bet yer life. She\u0027s a peach.\" \"Well, I\u0027m interested. What do I owe you?\" \"How\u0027d a dime be?\" \"All right.\" Harold tossed him the coin. As he was going out the door he stopped and looked back. \"Say, mister, the girl had done give me one dime, but I thought you\u0027d want to go fifty-fifty with her.\" He hurried down the stairway without waiting for a reply. As Harold tore the letter open he thought, \"That boy may land in the penitentiary, but his chances to escape the poor house are good. However, I am inclined to believe I would be willing to go fifty-fifty with Ruth in a life partnership, but the one great obstacle is I can\u0027t furnish my fifty.\" The letter was brief but interesting: Dear Mr. King: I would like to have a talk with you. If it will not greatly inconvenience you I would be pleased to have you call at my home this evening. Yours truly, Ruth Babcock. \"There is nothing to do but to go, if I do have to wear the old suit,\" he thought. He tried to conjecture what it could be that she wanted to talk to him about. Maybe she had some suggestion to help him secure the city job. Her employer, Jim Stover, was regarded as the political boss of the town and whatever he said went with the city officials. He was quite sure Ruth was going to make a suggestion to help him to secure Stover\u0027s assistance. Wilson had already talked with Stover in his interest but had not secured a definite answer. That evening Harold got out his best suit and brushed it thoroughly. It was badly worn. When he had dressed he viewed himself in the mirror. \"Harold, old boy,\" he said to himself, \"there is no mistaking the fact you are run-down, you look seedy. You need a new casing but will have to make out with the old one for awhile.\" As Harold walked down the street to the car line he met Golter. Harold noticed his well groomed appearance. When they spoke, the supercilious smirk on Golter\u0027s face nettled Harold. \"Come in, Mr. King. Let me have your hat. Ruth ran over to a neighbor\u0027s. She said if you called before she returned to tell you that she would be back in a few minutes.\" \"How are you, Mr. Babcock? I believe you are looking better.\" \"If I could only get over having this pain in my head. Sometimes I do not have it for two or three days and then it will come back and I suffer terribly. I worry lots, Mr. King, because I can\u0027t remember my business affairs before I was hurt.\" \"It may come to you some time.\" \"I hope so. Not long ago in my dream I remembered the rest of the safe combination.\" \"Are you sure that was really your safe combination?\" \"Yes, positive of it. I had remembered all but the last number before the dream.\" \"Did you remember anything else besides the combination?\" \"Yes, I dreamed that I showed the combination to a man in whom I had confidence and that he stole the money.\" \"Whose money was in the safe, Mr. Babcock?\" \"My money.\" \"Are you sure you had money?\" \"Yes, I have always remembered that.\" \"You say you dreamed that you showed the combination to a man in whom you had confidence?\" \"Yes, I trusted him. The dream was very real.\" \"Can you remember anything about this man\u0027s appearance or what his business was or his connection with you?\" \"No, I have been trying for days to remember who he was but have not been able to.\" At this juncture Ruth came in and the subject was dropped. Soon after, the door opened and Clara Babcock started to enter, but seeing there was company present, hesitated. \"Come on in, Aunt Clara,\" said Ruth. The four visited together for a time. When Ruth\u0027s father and aunt had left the room Ruth asked, \"Were you surprised to get my note?\" \"Yes, I was somewhat surprised,\" he replied. \"I first wrote you what I wanted to tell you but afterwards decided that I could tell you better; so I tore up the letter I had written you and wrote the note asking you to come.\" \"I was pleased to come, and if I can be of any service to you I will only be too glad to help you.\" \"Harold,\" she spoke in a low, soft voice, \"I did not ask you to come here because I needed your help.\" He felt a little twinge of disappointment. He would like to have her look to him for help and be able to help her. The only time he had attempted to help her he had failed. \"I asked you to come because I wanted to help you.\" His pride was hurt. He thought she was beginning to pity him. Pity is not relished by a strong, self-respecting man. He became conscious of his run-down condition. He would not have been much surprised if she had offered to loan him money to buy a new suit of clothes. He wished he was away. \"You know,\" she continued, \"I think that friends should always guard the interests of each other and, Harold, if I should need advice or assistance I do not know of anyone, outside of my father, whom I would rather trust than you.\" He felt better. \"I hope I may always be worthy of your confidence,\" he said. \"What I have to say concerns you directly, and it concerns me because you are my friend. I know that I can trust you not to tell the source of your information.\" \"Certainly you can.\" \"This afternoon I was seated in my office with the door slightly ajar. There was someone in the president\u0027s office talking with Mr. Stover. I am not sure who the man was, but from the quality of his voice I believe it was McBryan. I heard this man say \u0027Harold King is one of them.\u0027 I moved close to the door that I might hear better. Mr. Stover asked, \u0027Are you sure of that?\u0027\" \"What did he say?\" \"He said, \u0027Yes, I am positive. We have a man who is a member of the Klan, who gave us this information.\u0027\" \"Did he say who it was?\" \"No, the man to whom Stover talked——\" \"I\u0027m sure that it was McBryan,\" said Harold, interrupting her. \"This man said, \u0027we\u0027ll fix this young upstart.\u0027\" Harold clenched his teeth and hands. He felt the muscles of his arms tighten. \"Mr. Stover said, \u0027let\u0027s give him one chance.\u0027 \u0027What do you propose?\u0027 the other asked. I could not hear what Mr. Stover said as he dropped his voice to a whisper.\" \"What else did they say?\" \"That was all I heard except the man said, \u0027I\u0027ll keep you informed.\u0027\" \"You are sure he said that he got his information from a member of the Klan?\" \"Yes, positive.\" \"So they are going to fix the \u0027young upstart,\u0027 are they?\" \"Mr. Stover did not say that; it was the other man who said it. Mr. Stover said, \u0027Let\u0027s give him another chance.\u0027\" \"I thank you, Ruth, for this information.\" \"Harold,\" she said, laying her hand gently on his arm, \"I hope you can prove that you are not a member of this organization.\" \"Didn\u0027t you say the principles were all right?\" \"Yes, but so many claim that a lawless element belongs.\" \"Ruth, you know that hatred and prejudice will cause people to make bitter accusations which they cannot prove and which have no basis in fact. Enrolled as members of the Klan are ministers, lawyers, judges, congressmen, governors. Do you believe that officers who have taken an oath to support the government and enforce its laws and who have always been law-abiding citizens would become and remain members of an outlaw organization? I tell you, Ruth, the Klan is composed of many of the best citizens and its purpose is to uphold and enforce law—not to violate it.\" \"I suppose that is true, but somehow I can\u0027t help but hope you do not belong and that if necessary you can prove that you do not. I hardly know, after what you have told me about the Klan, why I should feel this way unless it is because I am your friend and interested in you and do not want you to do anything that will injure your chances for success in the business world or subject you to worry and persecution.\" \"I appreciate your consideration for me, but, Ruth, if the issues are as vital as I believe they are and the United States needs an organization of this character to protect our American institutions and our Christian civilization would you want me to refuse my support for fear of personal consequences?\" As he asked this question, his gray eyes looked straight into her brown ones. \"Excuse me a moment,\" she said and left the room. She soon returned with two portraits. \"This,\" she said, handing him one of the pictures, \"is a portrait of Colonel Jameson, a Virginian, who was an officer in the Confederate army, and a member of the old Ku Klux Klan. He was my mother\u0027s father; and this is a picture of Major Babcock of General Sherman\u0027s staff, who was my father\u0027s father. Both of these men fought at the risk of their lives and at the sacrifice of personal interests for principles they believed to be right. On both sides of the house ancestors fought in the wars of 1812 and the Revolution. My family had a part in making this nation. Not only did the men of the Jameson and Babcock families fight, but the women folk sent them forth to battle in the spirit of love and sacrifice. The blood of these ancestors are in my veins. If the institutions and laws of our country and the sacred principles of Americanism are imperiled I ask you to do your duty courageously as becomes the man that I know you are.\" They were standing now, and as she made this speech he met her steady gaze unflinchingly. He slipped his arm about her and for a moment neither spoke. There are moments when speech is inadequate. The following morning at the breakfast table in the Babcock home Mr. Babcock remarked, \"You know that the more I see of that Mr. King the more favorably I am impressed with him. He strikes me as a man who has good stuff in him.\" \"Looks to me like he\u0027s kind of run-down at the heel—as mother used to say,\" said Aunt Clara. \"He sure isn\u0027t prosperous looking like that Mr. Golter. In this day and age it\u0027s mighty essential that a man have money or a good income when he gets married or his wife can\u0027t have a place of any consequence in society.\" Ruth blushed but made no reply. Her father noticed her embarrassment and said, \"Ruth, money has its place in life, but character is the big thing.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89877.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
