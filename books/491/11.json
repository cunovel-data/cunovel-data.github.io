{"id":23360,"no":11,"title":"Chapter X","content":"\"COME right in, Harold. Glad to see you.\" Judge Rider greeted his friend warmly. \"Judge, I ran up to talk to you a few minutes, if you are not busy.\" \"Sit down, Harold. I am not too busy to talk with you. Anything of importance?\" \"Yes, Judge, there is. Something very important. There\u0027s a leak. Somebody is giving out inside Klan information.\" \"Is that so? What has been given out?\" \"Someone told Stover that I am a member and that they would fix me. Stover suggested that I be given one chance. I don\u0027t know what that chance is to be nor how Stover\u0027s informant meant to fix me.\" \"Do you know who Stover\u0027s informant was?\" Judge Rider asked. \"Not positively. I am of the opinion that it was McBryan.\" \"How did you get your information?\" \"I am not at liberty to tell you that, Judge. It would be betraying a confidence.\" \"By all means don\u0027t tell it, then, but are you sure that it is correct?\" \"Yes, there is no question about the truthfulness of the report.\" \"You say that this man whom you think is McBryan said that they would fix you?\" \"Yes.\" \"He was going to get you because you are a Klansman?\" \"He told Stover that I was a Klansman and that they would fix me, and naturally the inference is that being a Klansman is the reason for the desire to fix me.\" \"Was that all that was said?\" \"Stover\u0027s informant said that he was sure of his information as they have a man on the inside!\" \"What! A man on the inside!\" The judge sprang to his feet. \"Yes, and when he parted from Stover he said, \u0027I will keep you informed.\u0027\" \"We must look after this at once. It is serious. Just keep it as quiet as possible and we will undertake an investigation. As this is the first leak we have heard of, it is quite likely that the traitor is someone who has recently been taken in.\" It was the middle of the afternoon of the same day that this conversation took place that Harold received a \u0027phone call from the Wilford Central State Bank requesting him to call there for a few minutes. When he arrived he was told by the teller that the president wished to see him in the office. When he entered Stover shook hands with him and asked him to be seated. The door was open into Ruth\u0027s office and she had seen Harold enter. Stover stepped to this door and closed it. Ruth was writing on the typewriter. \"Mr. King,\" said the banker, \"I had the teller \u0027phone you to come down because I wished to have a little private conversation with you. You know, Mr. King, I have been keeping my eye on you since you designed Simpson\u0027s cottage. That is an artistic and well arranged home. I said when I looked through that house that you had ability. I have been expecting ever since to see some big building constructed that you had designed, but I have been disappointed. Of course I recognize that a man in your profession needs more than ability—he needs some influential friends.\" \"One must have the ability if he makes good, but I realize the value of influential friends,\" Harold remarked. \"Yes, you must have them if you get on in this world, especially if you are short on capital. I think that you realize, Mr. King, that I have influence with the city administration.\" \"I am sure that you have.\" \"Yes, what I say usually goes. Now, Mr. King, I would like to see you get the contract to do the architectural work for the new city building.\" Ruth, writing on the typewriter in the other room, heard the sound of the men\u0027s voices. She was anxious for Harold. She wondered if Mr. Stover was going to give him the chance today. If so, she hoped the terms would be such that he would accept. She did not want to hear, and pounded unusually hard on the typewriter. \"I thank you, Mr. Stover. To be sure I want the job.\" \"I have already talked to the mayor and commissioners in your interest.\" \"I certainly appreciate it.\" \"I thought you would. If there is anything that gives me pleasure it is to help a young man get a start. I\u0027m a self-made man, Mr. King. I started to work in a bank at thirty-five dollars a month. It took me a long time to get a start. If I had had a few influential friends to back me I might have established myself ten years sooner than I did. Whenever I think of those long years of hard struggle I make a new resolution to help some young fellow to get a start. Harold, I have helped lots of them along the road to success. What I am going to say to you is in the spirit of a father to a son.\" (He placed his hand on Harold\u0027s shoulder and smiled on him affectionately.) \"I want to give you a little advice.\" \"I am willing to hear it.\" \"The city officials like your perspective drawing, but they say that you have had very little practical experience.\" \"I have not had a great deal of experience since I opened an office of my own, but before coming here I was employed in an architect\u0027s office and worked on drawings for expensive buildings. I drew up most of the plans and specifications for one building that cost a million dollars.\" \"Understand, I am not doubting your ability, but the mayor and commissioners must be convinced or influenced. I am quite sure I can overcome this objection without any trouble, but there is a more serious matter.\" \"What is it?\" \"They know that you are a Ku Kluxer.\" The banker had partially turned his face from Harold as he made this statement but gave him a side glance for the purpose of noting the effect and was disappointed that Harold did not appear surprised or alarmed. \"How do they know that?\" he asked with apparent unconcern. \"It doesn\u0027t make any difference how they found out. The fact is they know it.\" \"If it be true, what has that to do with this architectural work?\" \"It may not have anything to do with doing the work, but it has a lot to do with getting the job. You see they don\u0027t want to give this fine job to a man who is identified with an organization that is so highly objectionable.\" \"You are personally opposed to the Klan?\" \"Yes, very much. You see, I am going to advise you the same as I would if you were my son.\" \"What are your objections to the Klan?\" \"They are many; but one of the principal ones is that they hide behind masks. If they want an organization let them take off those masks and come out in the open. It\u0027s cowardly for men to hide behind masks, besides there are too many of them who take advantage of their concealed identity to get out and whip somebody.\" \"You are mistaken, Mr. Stover, the members of the Klan are not permitted to wear their masks except in the lodge or Klan meetings for the purpose of doing guard duty or putting on ritualistic work, when doing deeds of charity or in peaceful parades.\" \"Well, if they want to put themselves right before the public let them publish a list of their members.\" \"That would destroy the value of the organization as a law enforcement body. How would it do, Mr. Stover, for the secret service men of the government to publish their names when they come into a community and let everyone know just who they are?\" \"We don\u0027t need the Klan to enforce the laws. We have officers for that purpose. The Klan has no right to take the law into its own hands.\" \"The Klan does not take the law into its own hands. The Klan assists the officers in enforcing the law by furnishing evidence. If the officers refuse to act it is the purpose of the Klan to have them recalled or voted out at the election and others put in who will act. It is the duty of all good citizens to help enforce the laws.\" \"Our officers enforce the laws—we don\u0027t need the Klan.\" \"Our officers enforce the laws in Wilford Springs against the uninfluential violator, but fellows like Hennesy are permitted to operate.\" \"Well, young man, you had better not line up with a bunch who are in disfavor with the public. The last election showed what the people of Wilford Springs thinks of your Klan organization. Now to get down to business. It\u0027s of a great deal of importance to you that you get this city building job. If you will follow my suggestions I will get it for you. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" Ruth had finished her typewriting and the men were speaking so loudly that she could not help but hear now. \"I have every reason to believe that you can.\" \"Very well.\" The banker began to rub his hands together. \"What I have to propose is this, you withdraw from the Klan and make a public statement that you have done so because it is a lawless organization, and I will see that you get the city job.\" \"Would you have me make this statement in spite of the fact that all I personally know of the Klan is to the contrary?\" \"Well, you have read of enough outrages being committed by the Klan other places that you could conscientiously make that statement even though you do not have personal knowledge of law violations by Klansmen.\" A fifteen thousand dollar job was at stake. He wanted it as he had never desired anything before, but his virtue never wavered. In a flash he remembered the parting admonition of his mountain mother when he left the mountain home to make a place for himself in the world. She had said, \"Son, when you are sorely tempted to do wrong say, like your Master, \u0027Get thee behind me Satan.\u0027\" He also remembered his obligation as a Klansman. He sprang to his feet and towered like a Hercules over Stover who sat at the table rubbing his hands nervously. \"Stover,\" he said, \"if you think for a minute that you can bribe me with a fifteen thousand dollar job to betray the best interests of my country and community and violate my sacred obligation as a Klansman you have another think coming. I tell you and you can repeat it to your henchmen that you can take the job with which you have attempted to bribe me and go straight to hell with it.\" King turned on his heels and left the room. When he had finished this speech Ruth clasped her hands together in joyful admiration and exclaimed, \"Good, good!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89878.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
