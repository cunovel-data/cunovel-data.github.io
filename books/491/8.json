{"id":23357,"no":8,"title":"Chapter VII","content":"THE city election resulted in a complete triumph for the anti-law enforcement, anti-prohibition, anti-Ku Klux crowd. The Klan not being fully organized took no active part, as an organization, in the election. The enemies of the Klan who were supporting the Clark ticket, used the Klan as a scarecrow to line up the Catholics, Jews, negroes and bootleggers for Clark. This influence, together with the personal following of Clark, easily elected him. Springer boasted in many issues of the Journal of \"The victory the respectable law-abiding citizens gained over the lawless Klan and its sympathizers.\" He told the people through the columns of the Journal that the election had sounded the death knell of the Klan in Wilford Springs; that the law-abiding citizens had emphatically protested through their votes, and that no self-respecting citizen would think of joining this organization after the community had shown its disapproval. In spite of this propaganda fiery crosses and white robed figures were more frequently seen in the vicinity of Wilford Springs than before the city election. During the entire summer the frequency of these reports increased. Soon after Clark took the oath of office as mayor he appointed Roberts as chief of police. Roberts was inexperienced in politics and knew but little of the methods and less of the principles of the men who had been elected. Roberts was not a strong character, but, generally speaking, he desired to do what was right. No sooner had he become the head of the police department than he made his police force a talk and told them that he expected the law to be enforced without fear or favor. Sixty days after he had been acting as chief he was passing the Wilford Springs Central State Bank. Stover stepped to the door and asked him to come in. \"Come into my private office.\" The banker led the way. \"Have a seat, Roberts.\" \"Thank you. This electric fan feels good this kind of a day.\" \"We\u0027re having some very warm weather.\" \"We can expect it this time of the year. It\u0027s a little unpleasant but mighty good for the corn.\" \"Roberts,\" said the banker, \"you have a note here that is thirty days past due.\" \"Yes, I know I have. I have been intending to take care of that out of my salary, but one thing after another has happened to prevent my doing so. First, one of the children had to have his tonsils removed; then my wife was called back to Illinois, on account of the illness of her mother.\" \"Too bad that you have had so much bad luck.\" \"Can\u0027t you renew this note for me?\" \"Yes, we can take care of that for you. You will always find the Central ready and willing to accommodate its customers. There is another little matter I want to talk to you about. The other day Hennesy was in here paying his rent and told me that he wouldn\u0027t be wanting my building after the first of next month. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that there is a policeman hanging around there a great deal of the time and his niggers, who are employed to put out his stuff, are scared and are not doing any business. I wouldn\u0027t want to lose Hennesy as a tenant. (I couldn\u0027t get half the amount of rent he pays me for the use of the building for the use of ordinary lines of business.) Hennesy can\u0027t afford to pay me one hundred seventy-five dollars a month for that building to use for a pool hall alone.\" Roberts chewed hard and nervously on the end of a cigar. When Stover ceased speaking Roberts said, \"I didn\u0027t know that building belonged to you.\" \"And that isn\u0027t all. Hennesy was one of your best supporters. He worked faithfully for Clark and recommended you for chief. If I were you I would tell my police to lay off of Hennesy\u0027s place and of every other place where the proprietor is a well established tax-payer and has some influence.\" \"I told the people that if I were appointed chief I would see that the laws were enforced.\" \"That\u0027s all right, Roberts; but you can\u0027t afford to endanger your political future and damage your friends to enforce a law that was placed on the statute books through the influence of cranks and some old ladies.\" \"I will tell the boys to stay away from Hennesy\u0027s place. I really don\u0027t know anything against it anyway.\" During the entire conversation the lean banker had been rubbing his hands nervously together. Now he smiled. Scarcely ever did he laugh. \"Roberts,\" he said, speaking in a very confidential tone, \"there are plenty of law violators who are transients or who have no influence in the community whom you can prosecute and make an enforcement record for yourself without interfering with the business of your friends and supporters.\" \"I thank you for your suggestions,\" said Roberts as he rose to go. \"That\u0027s all right, Roberts, I am always glad to help my friends. Let that note run as long as you like.\" Stover smiled blandly as the chief left the office. After Roberts left the bank he began at once to put Stover\u0027s advice into practice. He instructed his policeman on the beat where Mike Hennesy operated his pool hall not to see anything when he passed there. He also instructed other policemen to pass up other joints and bootleggers. A few days later Roberts received word that a common bootlegger known as \"Slim\" was due to arrive that night with a carload of booze. Slim had been a resident of Wilford Springs only a year. He had no established place of business. Slim was in disfavor with Mike Hennesy and the other joint keepers of the town. He worked independently and had refused to contribute anything to the campaign fund, which Hennesy had been appointed to raise among the liquor fraternity during the campaign. Hennesy furnished Roberts the information and told him to \"pinch\" him. It was two o\u0027clock in the morning when \"Slim\" was halted as he was entering the city limits. The chief took possession of the car and booze and \"Slim\" was taken to the city jail. The next morning another wheel in the machinery turned and the police judge gave \"Slim\" sixty days in jail and a two hundred dollar fine. The Daily Eagle contained a statement of the facts. The Journal not only gave the facts but was loud in its praise of the chief and his force. It was only a short time after \"Slim\u0027s\" arrest and conviction and while he was still in durance vile that two policemen surprised a party of poker players in a room at The Antler House. The players were prominent business men. They were playing for big stakes. It was one-thirty in the morning, almost the same hour that \"Slim\" had been arrested and taken to jail. Were these poker players taken to jail? Oh, no, they were taken to the city building. The chief was then called. He called the police judge, who was accommodating enough to get out of bed to accommodate this group of business men. Each man was permitted to enter a fictitious name on the record and deposit a cash bond of twenty dollars for his appearance. (Of course they forfeited the bonds.) No reference was made of this raid by the Journal. The Eagle simply stated the facts, without giving names and without any comment. The day following this event Judge Rider, who was the youngest judge of a district court in the state, being only thirty-three years old, met Springer on the street. Judge Rider was a clean-cut, straight, upstanding man who had a strong sense of justice. He could not resist this opportunity of taking Springer to task. \"Hello, Springer.\" \"Hello, judge.\" \"Say, Springer, how did you happen to overlook such an important news item as the raid of The Antler House?\" \"I didn\u0027t overlook it, judge. I purposely omitted it.\" \"Why should such an important bit of news be omitted from the columns of the Journal?\" \"Judge, it wouldn\u0027t do to give that affair publicity. Every one of those fellows were prominent business men.\" \"If a business man violates the law he should pay the penalty the same as the friendless outcast. If publicity and the condemnation of the public is to be a part of the penalty he should have that, too.\" \"We didn\u0027t write them up because of the feelings of their families.\" \"You gave a column to \u0027Slim\u0027s\u0027 arrest and conviction. I understand that \u0027Slim\u0027 has a wife and three children. Doubtless the members of \u0027Slim\u0027s\u0027 family have feelings the same as the members of the families of these business men.\" \"If I had mentioned these men by name and they had objected, I couldn\u0027t have shown by the court records that they were charged with poker playing.\" \"Springer, you know that it wouldn\u0027t be hard to prove their identity. The police who made the arrest can give the names of every one of them. It was a shame and a disgrace that they were permitted to enter fictitious names on the record and forfeit small cash bonds. I tell you, Springer, that sort of a farce is making Bolsheviks. \u0027Slim\u0027 couldn\u0027t be made to believe that the laws are being impartially enforced, and they are not. It is just such partiality as this that makes the Klan necessary.\" \"What, you a judge and in favor of that lawless organization?\" \"The Klan I am in favor of is not lawless. It is an organization that insists on the impartial enforcement of the law. In no instance would I be a member of an organization that takes the law into its own hands. I can see how an organization of the best citizens, who will co-operate with the officers by serving as private detectives and turning all information over to the officials, can be of great benefit. Furthermore, the Klan I am for is an organization that insists that the officers do their duty and supports them in the performance of it; and demands that the officer who won\u0027t do his duty get out. If we can have a Klan like that here, I am for it.\" \"I must be going, judge,\" said Springer, and the conversation was brought to a close.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89875.html","bookId":491,"book":{"id":491,"title":"Harold the Klansman","description":"简介： The purpose of the author in writing this story is to furnish the public with reliable information about the Ku Klux Klan, and at the same time give entertainment.
