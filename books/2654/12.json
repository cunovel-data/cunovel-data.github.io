She looked pale and her limbs trembled when she tried to sit up. \"Katiya, I am so cold!\" she said.\\n\\n The window was still closed. A pale moth flapped against the inside glass frantically.\\n\\n Elena rolled her eyes as she cracked the window to let the insect fly away. \"Must you always complain?\" she asked as she quickly finished getting dressed. \"Hurry, Katerina! I\u0027m famished!\"\\n\\n \"Go to breakfast without me,\" I said, sitting on the bed and taking my cousin\u0027s hand. \"Can you ask Madame Orbel ani to come and see Dariya? She is ill.\"\\n\\n \"What a shame,\" Elena said. \"Of course. I will send her right away.\" When she had left, I looked more closely at my cousin. Dariya\u0027s pupils were large, and her breathing seemed labored.\\n\\n \"What is wrong with me? My stomach-oh, the cramps!\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I feel as if I\u0027m dying!\"\\n\\n \"Hush, Madame Orbel ani is coming,\" I said, rubbing her cold hand between my warm ones. Her right arm was floppy, like a rag doll \u0027s. I saw a cold light wrapping around her. It was growing steadily brighter and stronger. I was terrified for her. \"The headmistress will send for a doctor.\" My cousin\u0027s eyes rolled back in her head, and she slipped into unconsciousness.\\n\\n \"Dariya!\" I shouted, shaking her. Her eyes opened briefly. With a moan, she passed out again. \"Dariya!\"\\n\\n \"What is this nonsense?\" Madame Metcherskey asked severely. \"Girls, get down to the dining room at once, or you will be punished.\"\\n\\n \"Madame, Dariya is ill!\" I stood up so she could see for herself. \"You must call the doctor!\"\\n\\n Madame Metcherskey\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Katerina Alexandrovna, go downstairs immediately. I will deal with her. It is not your concern.\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever hated anyone more than I hated Madame Metcherskey at that moment. Her words stung, but I did not dare argue with her. I swallowed hard and squeezed my cousin\u0027s pale, limp hand. \"I promise I will be back, Dariya.\"\\n\\n I ran downstairs and found Madame Orbel ani, who sat at the teachers\u0027table, eating breakfast with Madame Tomilov. \"Did Elena tell you about Dariya Yevgenievna?\" I asked.\\n\\n I saw confusion in their eyes. \"Dariya?\"\\n\\n I gripped the chair in front of me. Of course Elena had not told them.\\n\\n \"She passed out!\" I explained. \"She\u0027s extremely cold and complaining of stomach pains. Madame Metcherskey would not allow me to stay with her.\\n\\n I fear something terrible will happen to her!\"\\n\\n Madame Tomilov stood up immediately. \"Madame Orbel ani, send for the doctor. Katerina Alexandrovna, take me to your cousin.\" The headmistress took one look at Dariya, still lying unconscious in her bed, and had her moved to a separate room, quarantined from the rest of us. Dr. Gall itzin arrived and I was shooed into the hall. \"She could be contagious,\" the doctor said. \"Keep all the other students away from her.\" I tried to argue that both Elena and I had breathed the same air as she had all night long, but Madame Tomilov would not listen. She sent me to class after assuring me that Dariya was in good hands.\\n\\n I grabbed Elena in the hallway on her way to algebra. \"What did you do to her?\"\\n\\n Elena\u0027s eyes grew wide and innocent. \"Moi?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever spells you\u0027re trying to cast on me with your brother\u0027s hair, whatever hateful spell you\u0027re casting on Dariya, you\u0027re going to stop immediately.\"\\n\\n \"You say the most bizarre things.\" Elena shook her head sadly. \"Perhaps you feel unwel too. Do you have a fever?\" She reached up to touch my forehead.\\n\\n I knocked her hand away. The girls in the hallway moved quickly to their next classes, making a deliberate effort to ignore us. Out of the corner of\\n\\n my eye, I saw one of the Brown Form\u0027s teachers staring at us nervously.\\n\\n Lowering my voice, I said, \"I will not let you hurt Dariya or any of the other students here.\"\\n\\n Elena rolled her eyes. She had noticed the teacher\u0027s attention as well.\\n\\n \"Enough of your foolishness, Katerina. You are making me late for class.\" She turned and disappeared into her classroom.\\n\\n I needed to see for myself what Elena was up to. I sneaked back upstairs to our dormitory, the chilly hallway now empty. I searched under Elena\u0027s cot for proof that she was working dark magic against Dariya. I found nothing under her bed, nor under her pillow, nor in her unlocked storage trunk. Nothing but the wrapped lock of her brother\u0027s hair and a single tarot card: the King of Swords. It matched the Queen of Swords that had been sent to me at Christmas. Was it part of a love spell Elena was trying to cast on me? I shuddered, glad that I\u0027d burned the queen card. But there was no evidence here of spells against Dariya.\\n\\n I headed to the sickroom and peeked inside. Madame Tomilov was bent over Dariya\u0027s bed, her hand on my cousin\u0027s cheek. Dariya\u0027s breathing was slow but even. The headmistress looked up and frowned when she saw me. \"Go to class, Katerina Alexandrovna. There has been no change in her status.\"\\n\\n Sighing, I went back downstairs and hurried to my next class before I was missed.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t long before everyone in the school knew of Dariya\u0027s mysterious ill ness. Later that morning, Aurora Demidova passed out in French class, and during the lunch hour, two of the servants fell ill. I tried to return to the sickroom to check on Dariya, but Madame Metcherskey would not excuse me from my music lessons. She glared at me for an agonizing hour as I practiced my scales on the harp. With a rebel ious, and possibly devious, impulse, I played the chords as loud as I could. If I had to play the harp, I would make sure the angels in heaven heard me.\\n\\n My fingers were bleeding by the time the class was over and I could finally leave and visit the sickroom.\\n\\n Dariya was lying as still as death in her bed, but her cold light had not\\n\\n changed. The bright swirls wrapped around her like a snowy-white cocoon.\\n\\n Beside her, Madame Orbel ani sat reading a book. She looked up and smiled sadly. \"No change, my dear,\" she said. \"Have you visited the chapel to light a candle for your cousin?\"\\n\\n I shook my head sadly. \"I wanted to see her first.\" I picked up Dariya\u0027s cold hand. She was still breathing, but it was very shallow. \"What did the doctor say?\"\\n\\n Madame Orbel ani shrugged. \"Dr. Gall itzin said only that he believes the girls have influenza, and that he would return in the morning to check in on them.\"\\n\\n Aurora Demidova slept on a nearby cot, her face as pale as Dariya\u0027s and her hands even colder.\\n\\n \"What does he recommend as treatment?\" I asked. I noticed a porcelain bowl with dried blood in it slid partially under Aurora\u0027s cot. Had the doctor decided to bleed them both? I drew the blanket back to search my cousin\u0027s arms, but there were no cut marks. I sighed in relief.\\n\\n Madame Orbel ani put a hand on my shoulder. \"I know you are worried for Dariya Yevgenievna. And the other girls. But you must allow the doctor to do what he thinks is best. No meddling, Katerina Alexandrovna.\" I was awake all night, my thoughts racing in my head. Elena slept soundly, I noticed. She seemed remarkably healthy. The cold light that surrounded her was nothing but a faint gray mist.\\n\\n I did not believe for one moment that Dr. Gall itzin was right. My cousin was not suffering from flu. There had been no fever or cough, no other reports of influenza in St. Petersburg.\\n\\n I knew Elena was responsible somehow. She\u0027d been mad at Dariya for disparaging her family. But I couldn\u0027t make sense of Aurora and the two servants. I doubted Elena even knew the servant girls existed. And why hadn\u0027t I become ill? I was the focus of her attention more often than not.\\n\\n She wanted something from me. Was she trying to frighten me?\\n\\n I could not sleep, so I saw no point in lying in bed any longer. I pulled on my wrap and looked out the window at the pale gray sky. Creeping quietly down the hall, I peeked in the room where Dariya and Aurora were both sleeping. The cold light enshrouding them had not changed in its intensity overnight. The light gave me no clue to the nature of the ill ness. Was it caused by a contagion or by a Montenegrin spell? Without any firm evidence of supernatural causes, I had to assume that it was a natural ill ness, and that it could be cured. Dariya was moaning softly in her sleep, and I could see the glistening beads of sweat on her brow. Madame Orbel ani dozed in the chair beside them, oblivious to the world.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like the way Dariya looked. She did not seem to be improving at all.\\n\\n The large clock downstairs chimed five. It would be hours before breakfast time. Returning to my room and quietly getting dressed, I decided to sneak out to speak with Dr. Kruglevski. Whatever was wrong with the girls, surely he would be the best man to examine my cousin and the other patients.\\n\\n The large front hall was dark and quiet. The heavy front door locked from within and was guarded by an elderly doorman, who still wore his faded black uniform from his younger days in the regiments. I waited until he left his post to make his rounds, then quietly unlocked the door and slipped outside.\\n\\n The late-January morning was bitterly cold, but I did not mind. The Smolny Gardens were beautiful in their icy barrenness. I skipped past them and turned down Slonovaya Ulitsa. Crossing through the Peski District, I passed sleeping town houses and newly constructed apartment buildings.\\n\\n There were few sleighs about this early in the morning. I hoped I looked like some poor factory girl on her way to work. Nobody bothered me.\\n\\n The Oldenburg Hospital was just beyond the Greek church. Dr.\\n\\n Kruglevski liked to make rounds on his patients before going to his research lab every morning.\\n\\n The nurses, in their flowing white habits, did not look happy to see me. A stout, grim-faced nurse met me at the front door. \"Our patients are sleeping! Come back during visiting hours!\" she told me.\\n\\n I shook my head, teeth chattering. \"I am here to see Dr. Kruglevski.\"\\n\\n \"Are you ill, child? Where are your parents?\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if being the daughter of the hospital\u0027s patron would help me or hinder me at this time of the day. I coughed a little. \"Please, madam, I am from the Smolny Institute. I\u0027ve been feverish and restless all night.\" I had no idea who would be maddest when they discovered my charade: the nurses, my parents, or the headmistress at Smolny. I shivered.\\n\\n The nurse noticed and quickly hurried me inside. \"Come along, then. It\u0027s much warmer in here, by the stove. Dr. Kruglevski is already making rounds. He can see you in just a moment.\" She sat me by the fire, wrapped me in a woolen blanket, and handed me a hot mug of tea before bustling off to take care of the patients on the ward.\\n\\n The doctor recognized me instantly. \"Duchess! What in heavens are you doing here at such an hour?\" he asked. \"Is your mother well?\" Drawing the blanket closer around me, I said, \"Doctor, some of the students at Smolny have been afflicted with the strangest ill ness. I\u0027ve come to beg for your assistance.\"\\n\\n The doctor took a cup of tea one of the nurses handed him, and sat in the chair opposite me. \"A strange ill ness? Tell me of the symptoms.\"\\n\\n \"It starts with stomach pains and general malaise, followed within several hours by coldness in the extremities and muscle weakness,\" I said. \"So far only four girls have become sick, including two servants.\" I\u0027d spent my entire study hour the day before trying to discover what the sick servants had in common with Aurora and Dariya. Something that would explain why they were the only four in the school who were ill. I\u0027d not been able to come up with anything.\\n\\n \"It could be food poisoning,\" the doctor mused, stirring his tea thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"But the ill ness seems to strike randomly. Madame Metcherskey called for Dr. Gall itzin but he thinks it is a touch of influenza.\"\\n\\n \"Bah! Gall itzin is a fool. Believes leeches can still cure everything.\" I nodded in agreement. The man wasn\u0027t open to modern thoughts or treatments.\\n\\n \"Very well, I will come and examine your sick friends. What did your cousin eat last?\"\\n\\n I struggled to think. She had walked with me in the gardens, where we had eaten pieces of rock candy, and then we\u0027d had cold mutton and borscht and lemon tarts for our welcome-back dinner. Dariya had eaten with the rest of us, but she and the others had not become ill until the morning-and had not come into direct contact with any of the other sick girls until they were all confined to the sickroom.\\n\\n \"Come, let us check on your Dariya Yevgenievna,\" the doctor said. He gave the head nurse instructions to call for his carriage. \"I must say it is perplexing,\" he told me as we waited by the front door. \"None of my patients at the hospital have presented with quite the same symptoms that you describe.\"\\n\\n The sun was just beginning to come up as we raced through St.\\n\\n Petersburg. I knew Madame Tomilov would frown upon me for leaving the school grounds with no chaperone. I hoped, though, that if my parents were informed, Papa would not be too angry. Sick people needed proper medical care. And there was no way they would get it without my interference.\\n\\n Madame Metcherskey and Madame Orbel ani both met us at the front gate. Madame Metcherskey looked contemptuous, her upper lip curling in disapproval as I hastened out of the carriage. Madame Orbel ani, however, seemed relieved to see me. \"Katerina Alexandrovna, thank goodness, we have been so worried about you,\" she said, embracing me before Madame Metcherskey could say anything.\\n\\n Madame Metcherskey\u0027s eyes widened as she saw Dr. Kruglevski exit the carriage. \"Young lady, what is the meaning of this?\" she asked.\\n\\n I stepped forward and introduced the doctor to my instructor. \"He is Papa\u0027s favorite doctor,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sure he can discover what is wrong with Dariya Yevgenievna and the others.\"\\n\\n \"Please forgive this foolish girl, Doctor, for disturbing you,\" Madame Metcherskey said, glaring at me. I knew I was going to be punished for this stunt. Severely. But I did not mind, as long as Dariya got better. I had faith that Dr. Kruglevski would know exactly what to do.\\n\\n \"There is nothing to forgive, madame,\" Dr. Kruglevski said. \"If there are ill students within this institute, I must be allowed to examine them. Or I shal consult the tsar to ask permission, and tell him I was denied entrance. Will you be so kind as to take me to them right away?\" Madame Metcherskey began to retort something but closed her mouth into a thin line and turned around. \"follow me, then, if you please. Madame Orbel ani, take Katerina to the headmistress\u0027s office, if you will.\" Madame Orbel ani laid a hand on my arm as the doctor followed Madame Metcherskey. \"Oh, Katerina, why would you run off and do such a crazy thing? Running down the streets of the city before sunrise? What were you thinking?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking of my sick cousin, and a doctor who I know can help her.\" Madame Orbel ani sighed as she led me to the mauve sitting room to wait for my scolding. I glanced up at the large portraits hanging in this room. Many princesses had been educated here, and the halls were covered with their likenesses. In this room was a picture of a very young Madame Metcherskey, in her court gown. She had been a beauty when she was younger, and had been a lady-in-waiting for the dowager empress Alexandra Feodorovna. My great-grandmother.\\n\\n I hated not being with my cousin while Dr. Kruglevski examined her. I was anxious to learn his diagnosis. And what his recommendations for treatment would be.\\n\\n I glanced at the golden clock on Madame Tomilov\u0027s desk, anxious most of all about my scolding. The longer I waited, the more I was convinced that I would be expelled from Smolny. Thoroughly disgraced, my family would send me away to the South of France and I would never have to worry about Danilo or his sisters again.\\n\\n A sudden thought struck me.\\n\\n Perhaps there was a school of medicine that accepted women somewhere in the South of France? Somehow, exile from Russia did not sound so bad. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-12.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888.
