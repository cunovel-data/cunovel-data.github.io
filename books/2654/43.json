The school year would be over soon, and plans were being made for me and Maman to travel to Montenegro for Prince Danilo\u0027s eighteenth birthday. I dreaded the summer.\\n\\n Elena was ecstatic. \"You will love it in Cetinje,\" she promised me. \"It is a very beautiful city, in the shadow of Black Mountain. And the people of Montenegro will adore you.\"\\n\\n I found that difficult to believe. Did the people know the truth about the Vladiki? Perhaps they lived in constant fear of their king and queen.\\n\\n \"And you will be able to meet the rest of my family,\" Elena continued as I tried to ignore her and study my Latin. \"My oldest sister, Zorka, and her husband live near the palace, since he is in exile from Serbia. She just had another child before Christmas, and he is the fattest baby! And then there are Militza and Stana, then Danilo, then me, and my younger siblings: Anna, Mirko, Zenia, and Vera.\"\\n\\n \"The palace must be always noisy,\" I said, not used to such mayhem at home.\\n\\n Elena laughed. \"Of course. But we would not have it any other way.\" I closed my Latin book and tossed it aside. There was no way Elena would let me concentrate. \"Tell me more about Danilo\u0027s birthday plans.\\n\\n What is going to happen?\" I asked.\\n\\n Elena smiled wickedly. \"It will be one of the most important days of his life, second only to his wedding day. There will be a ceremony in the church, which you must attend, as his betrothed. Then we will have dancing and feasting like you have never seen before. It will put any St. Petersburg ball to shame!\"\\n\\n Elena\u0027s father was indeed very wealthy and enjoyed spending his money more than our frugal tsar. The grand duchess Xenia had turned fourteen the previous month, and there had been no ball or party, since her birth date had fall en during Lent. But there had been a spectacular fireworks display at the empress\u0027s birthday celebration the previous fall. And a petting zoo with chattering monkeys at the young grand duchess Olga\u0027s fete the previous summer. I still had the scar on my little finger where one of the nasty creatures had bitten me.\\n\\n I caught myself wondering how the grand duke George would celebrate his eighteenth birthday. I was mostly certain he wouldn\u0027t be turning into a blood drinker. But it was no use thinking about the grand duke. \"And after the feasting?\" I asked Elena.\\n\\n \"That is when you will play the most important part,\" Elena said all too sweetly. \"But the ritual is secret and I cannot speak of it. Truthfully, I\u0027ve never seen an ascension performed. I\u0027ve only heard Maman speak of our father\u0027s ritual when he was young.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think I\u0027ll agree to participate?\" I asked.\\n\\n Elena grabbed my hand, squeezing it to the point of pain. \"You\u0027ll have no choice, Katerina. Your family\u0027s safety, and your own life, depends upon your cooperation.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-43.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888. As she attends a whirl of glittering balls, royal debutante Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, tries to hide a dark secret: she can raise the dead. No one knows. Not her family.
