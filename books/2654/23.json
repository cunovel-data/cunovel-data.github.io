{"id":63604,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The gown I wore to Miechen\u0027s ball was white, of course, with a pale blue ribbon around the waist and tiny seed pearls sewn into the bodice with silver thread. I had the same diamond earrings I\u0027d worn to Le ball Noir and a delicate silver tissue wrap. I could not find the obsidian ring, despite turning my room at home upside down. It had not been in my jewelry box at Smolny either. I resolved to be strong if I saw the crown prince. I promised myself I would not fall under his spell so easily. The empress and her family were not in attendance at Miechen\u0027s ball. I heard whispered rumors that she and the grand duchess were feuding again. I would not see Grand Duke George, so I had no way of knowing if he had found the count. Prince Danilo was his charming self again, daring to ask me for a third dance, which I declined with a smile. \"We mustn\u0027t!\" I said as he took my arm and strolled through the fragrant jardiniere with me. \"The old ladies will talk and my mother will know, and I will never hear the end of it.\" Being with the prince again made me forget everything else. There was something I needed to do that evening, but for the life of me, I could not remember what. He handed me a cup of warmed wine from the samovar. \"Why should you care what the old hags say? Their world does not concern you; I have seen that in your eyes. You would rather be anywhere else than here. Tell me, Duchess,\" he said, his black eyes burning into mine as his fingertips gently rubbed the inside of my wrist. \"Tell me where you would rather be tonight. Tell me, and I will take you there at once.\" I tried hard not to tremble; I was afraid he could hear my heart pounding in my throat. I was falling under the prince\u0027s spell all over again. And it felt delicious. I could think of nowhere on earth I would rather be at that moment, and I told the prince so. He smiled and whispered, \"I am glad,\" before kissing me. Mon Dieu! He kissed me! And I kissed him back. His grip on my hands tightened. I could have sworn I heard his heart pounding too. I broke away first, dazed, with my legs feeling weak. His arms circled me and held me up. He smiled down at me. \"Katerina, I want to bring you back to Montenegro and make you my bride. I shal speak to your father in the morning, yes?\" \"Yes,\" I said breathlessly without stopping to think. What would my father say? I did not care. All I cared about was the prince holding me in his arms. I sighed happily, resting my head on his shoulder. His hand caressed the back of my neck. I trembled all over again. \"Katiya! I have been looking all over for you!\" Dariya shouted as she hurried toward us. She stared at me and the crown prince in shock. \"Where have you been?\" I blushed, still foggy. I could not think to answer her. I was in Danilo\u0027s arms. How had that happened? \"Katiya, please come with me back to the ball,\" Dariya entreated. \"Your mother is looking for you.\" She glared at Danilo. \"That\u0027s all right,\" I said, smiling slowly. \"Do not worry about me.\" \"But-\" I looked back up into Danilo\u0027s eyes, still smiling. I was hopelessly lost. \"I found something that belongs to you, Katiya,\" my cousin said. \"Come and talk to me if you\u0027d like it back.\" Dariya gave me a frustrated look before storming off. \"We must rejoin the others, my love,\" the prince said, sighing heavily. \"Will you tell your mother that we have talked?\" \"Of course,\" I said, leaving his embrace to walk back to the ball room. I took his arm with a smile, suddenly feeling shy. \"Shal I bring her a gift tomorrow when I come to visit? Does she like flowers?\" \"Roses,\" I said, not really paying attention to what he was saying. I was intoxicated by the sound of his voice, by his warm touch, by his hypnotic eyes. He led me back to my Bavarian friends, but I honestly cannot remember anything more about the ball other than Prince Danilo\u0027s standing at my side throughout the evening. He had whispered, \"Do not dance with anyone else tonight,\" low enough that no one else could hear. And I did not dance any more after that. Who else could I have danced with? I didn\u0027t think there was another soul in the world who could make me feel like the prince did. Wasn\u0027t that love?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-23.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888. As she attends a whirl of glittering balls, royal debutante Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, tries to hide a dark secret: she can raise the dead. No one knows. Not her family. Not the girls at her finishing school. Not the tsar or anyone in her aristocratic circle. Katerina considers her talent a curse, not a gift. But when she uses her special skill to protect a member of the Imperial Family, she finds herself caught in a web of intrigue. An evil presence is growing within Europe\u0027s royal bloodlines—and those aligned with the darkness threaten to topple the tsar.
