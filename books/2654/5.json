And she did not think it wise for me to do so. \"Have him speak with your parents, Katiya,\" she told me. \"I\u0027m sure he has heard the gossip about them.\" I was too scared to tell Dariya everything that Militza had said, and I had not mentioned the grand duke\u0027s warnings. I didn\u0027t want my cousin to think that I was a monster.\\n\\n Petya\u0027s regiment was headquartered at nearby Vorontsov Palace. If I could get word to him, he could intervene with Papa on my behalf. He and his fell ow officers frequently walked in the Tauride Gardens, near our school. Elena and the Bavarian princesses, Augusta and Erzsebet, joined me and Dariya the next afternoon as we set out.\\n\\n Bundled up, we strolled along the iced-over fountains as Augusta asked Elena and Dariya endless questions about the tsarevitch and his younger brothers. I pretended to be more interested in the barren bushes and birch trees along the sidewalks.\\n\\n \"His brother George Alexandrovich is not so handsome,\" Elena said.\\n\\n \"He is sharp-tongued and mean-spirited. I should like to introduce you to the youngest one, Mikhail Alexandrovich. He is a true gentleman. Wouldn\u0027t it be wonderful if I should marry the tsarevitch and you should marry Mikhail?\"\\n\\n I wanted to laugh out loud. The youngest grand duke was only ten years old. He had not even been at the Smolny Ball. Princess Augusta was a few years younger than us, but she would still have to wait for her grand duke to grow up.\\n\\n \"Are you going to the children\u0027s Christmas Ball?\" Erzsebet asked. \"I\u0027ve heard the grand duchess Marie Pavlovna is a more gracious hostess than the empress herself.\"\\n\\n Elena shook her head, her black hair flying in the breeze. \"Sadly, I shal be back home in Montenegro for the holidays. You must tell me everything about the ball when I return. I did want to meet the grand duchess, but I\u0027m so happy that Katerina is coming home with me.\"\\n\\n Augusta sighed. \"Going abroad for the holiday? You are so lucky, Katerina!\"\\n\\n I did not feel lucky at all. But then I spotted my brother laughing with other members of his regiment. \"Pyotr Alexandrovich!\" I shouted, and ran toward him.\\n\\n \"Brat!\" He grinned when he saw me, and spun me around in his arms.\\n\\n \"Are you giving your instructors a hard time, as I taught you?\" I rolled my eyes. \"I must speak with you, Petya,\" I whispered. \"There is a dreadful plot here at Smolny to ruin my life.\"\\n\\n He glanced at the girls behind me, who were shyly speaking with the other officers. We strolled farther away from them. \"What the devil are you talking about?\" Petya asked.\\n\\n \"Elena and her sisters want me to visit Cetinje with them for Christmas,\" I explained. \"They are trying to marry me off to their brother.\" I grabbed Petya\u0027s arm. \"Please talk to Maman and Papa and beg them not to make me go.\"\\n\\n \"A crown prince, eh? What\u0027s so dreadful about that?\" Across the street, Dariya laughed as she flirted with one of the captains.\\n\\n Elena vied for their attentions as well. I turned back to Petya. I couldn\u0027t tell him everything about the Montenegrin witches. Then I would have to tell him about me. \"I do not want to move far away to some dark country in the mountains,\" I said, which was partly true. \"What am I going to do?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. And don\u0027t worry your pretty little head about anything. I\u0027ll be dining with our parents this evening. Perhaps they already have a more suitable match planned for you.\"\\n\\n For some absurd reason, the blue eyes of the grand duke George passed through my mind. I shook my head. \"You know I want to study medicine first,\" I told my brother. \"There will be plenty of time for a husband later. Look at Madame Curie.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but who wants to marry an old woman who\u0027s smarter than him?\" said one of the other officers, who had come swaggering up to us. He gave me a salute and a roguish grin.\\n\\n I was well bred enough to know I shouldn\u0027t respond to the officer\u0027s taunt, but I could not help myself. \"I\u0027m sure no smart woman would want to marry you, anyway, Count Chermenensky. That\u0027s for certain.\" Petya laughed and put his arm around me. \"Do not worry. Everything will work out. Katiya, I see that you remember my friend.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I said, holding out my hand for the count, even though he did have a low opinion of educated women. \"Petya brought you to our parents\u0027 home once.\"\\n\\n \"Enchante, mademoiselle,\" the count said gall antly.\\n\\n They walked me back to my companions and bid us adieu just as the snow began to fall. Elena was most curious about Petya\u0027s friend. \"And who was the handsome officer talking with you and your brother?\" she asked on our way back to the institute.\\n\\n \"Count Chermenensky.\"\\n\\n Elena scoffed. \"Only a count? Why should your brother waste your time with someone like that? Surely he doesn\u0027t expect your parents to approve of a count as a suitable match for you.\"\\n\\n I stopped walking and stared at the princess. \"Elena, there is much more to life than finding the richest husband possible. My brother was simply being cordial. Besides, the count is a close friend of his.\" Elena rolled her eyes. \"You are so bourgeois, Katerina.\" Dariya linked my arm with hers. \"Of course there\u0027s more to life than finding a rich husband,\" she said. \"I want a rich and handsome husband, with a title. He must be a prince or better.\" She led me back to Smolny with the Bavarian princesses and Elena laughing behind us.\\n\\n We shook the snow from our cloaks as we entered the front gates.\\n\\n Madame Metcherskey was standing at the top of the stairs glaring at us.\\n\\n We were late to dance practice. Again.\\n\\n I stayed awake in bed until late that night, worrying about Maman\u0027s answer to Elena\u0027s mother. Of course she would want me to go to Cetinje.\\n\\n She would think it such an honor. Rumors of the princesses and their dark magic would only intrigue Maman, if she did not know already.\\n\\n When I did drift off to sleep, my dreams were troubled, full of dark chanting by candlelight in a strange stone castle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-5.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888.
