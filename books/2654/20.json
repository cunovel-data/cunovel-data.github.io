{"id":63601,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"There was no word on the fate of Count Chermenensky. I heard nothing from George Alexandrovich. Nothing from the gossips at the school.\\n\\n Nothing in the newspapers I read in the library. As each day passed without news, my nerves twisted tighter and tighter in my stomach. I had unleashed a monster on the streets of St. Petersburg, even though I didn\u0027t know how. And I was worried about the poor creature\u0027s safety.\\n\\n I received an invitation to go sleigh riding on Saturday with the Montenegrin sisters and their brother, followed by tea at the Tauride Gardens pavilion. The thought of seeing Prince Danilo again after my latest horrid dream put my stomach in knots. I was both repulsed and confusingly attracted to him.\\n\\n Saturday morning was cold and crisp, with pale Russian sunshine casting a weak light across the snow. Dariya was worried about my going on an outing with the Montenegrins. \"Perhaps you should pretend to be ill, Katiya?\" she asked nervously.\\n\\n \"Do not worry about me. Princess Cantacuzene gave me a ring that I wear. She says it will protect me against their spells.\" I showed her the ring on my finger before donning my kidskin gloves. I wore it all the time now, mostly on a ribbon around my neck, hidden under my dress. It certainly wouldn\u0027t hurt anything.\\n\\n Dariya crossed herself and muttered but still tried to be helpful and told me the blue woolen dress looked better against my winter-pale skin than the brown dress.\\n\\n Elena, looking particularly rosy, was entirely too chatty as we took breakfast in the nearly empty dining hall. It was a simple breakfast of bread and jam with tea, just enough to warm our bell ies. I usually returned home each weekend, as did most of the St. Petersburg students. The foreign students remained at the institute unless invited home with another classmate. I rarely invited my friends home, never wanting anyone to witness one of Maman\u0027s seances. I did not think Madame Tomilov would approve if one of my classmates became possessed. Such things had been known to happen before-at my aunt Zina\u0027s one and only seance, for example.\\n\\n One of the Smolny servants came to the dining hall to tell us Elena\u0027s siblings were at the front gate. She helped us both into our woolen cloaks.\\n\\n Prince Danilo smiled at me, his white teeth dazzling. \"Katerina Alexandrovna,\" he said, extending his hand to help me into the sleigh. \"It is good to see you on this beautiful morning.\" He smiled at Elena too. \"And you as well, my sister.\"\\n\\n She rolled her eyes as she climbed in and sat next to Militza. The grand duke Peter Nikolayevich, Militza\u0027s fiance, sat on the other side of Militza. I bowed to the grand duke and said hello to Militza and Anastasia.\\n\\n We rode through the Summer Gardens, which were just as beautiful in the wintertime, at least to me. The sleigh was pulled by four handsome black stal ions.\\n\\n Elena was eager to tell her sisters about my outing with the imperial family. \"Our Katerina must find our company too dull for her when the Romanovs call upon her so often.\"\\n\\n \"They did not call upon me the other day.\" I felt I had to confess. \"I was walking in the woods and found a soldier who was ill. I was trying to help him when the Romanov party came upon us and helped me get the man to the military hospital.\"\\n\\n \"What a kind thing to do,\" Militza said. \"That man is most lucky that you happened upon him.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to believe that\" was all I could diplomatically say. I doubted the count would agree if anyone should ask him.\\n\\n \"You were lucky he was not a dangerous man,\" the grand duke Peter Nikolayevich said to me.\\n\\n I nodded. \"I realize walking alone in the woods was rather foolish, but I cherish winter days like this.\" I\u0027d go insane if I did not have some fresh air and solitude every day. Though if every day was like that one, I\u0027d go insane even faster.\\n\\n The horses were lively, trotting past the frozen ponds along the main garden path. I hoped the count had found a safe place to hide. Did he even realize he was in danger? He\u0027d had the sense to run away from the guards at the hospital.\\n\\n \"And tell us, what do you think of the mysterious princess Alix?\" Stana asked. \"I have heard so very little about her. Is she much like her sister, the grand duchess Elizabeth?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"I think she is a good deal younger, but she favors the grand duchess very much. Although she is shy, she seems to be enjoying her visit to St. Petersburg.\"\\n\\n Stana looked at her older sister and smiled wickedly. \"I do hope we get to make her acquaintance soon.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe she will be at the ball et tomorrow night,\" Elena said. \"I wonder what she thinks of Tchaikovsky.\"\\n\\n \"She certainly cannot be as beautiful as any of you,\" Prince Danilo said.\\n\\n \"I am surrounded by the most beautiful women of all of Europe. What lucky men we are, Peter Nikolayevich!\"\\n\\n Elena laughed. \"Dani, you are not even a man yet! Quit teasing us!\" The prince glowered at his sister. \"And you are not yet a woman, but I praise you nevertheless.\"\\n\\n The siblings got into a pushing match, making the carriage wobble from side to side.\\n\\n Princess Militza sighed. \"Children, behave.\"\\n\\n The grand duke smiled as Militza took his arm in hers. They made a very handsome couple but did not act like a young couple in love. Not at all like the tsarevitch and Princess Alix.\\n\\n Elena shoved her brother playfully, pushing him into me. \"I am so sorry, Duchess,\" he said, his dark eyes boring into mine. He took my hand gall antly. \"Have I injured you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, not at all!\" I said, even though I secretly wanted to box Elena\u0027s ears.\\n\\n I knew she had shoved him toward me on purpose. She looked positively gleeful. Be careful, I told myself. This family is dangerous. All of them, even Danilo.\\n\\n We stopped at one of the pavilions within the garden to rest the horses.\\n\\n There was no one else visiting that day, and the gardens had a barren, deserted appearance. Their naked branches and snow-covered grounds gave them a stark beauty, and I wandered off from the group to breathe in the crisp air. Away from the chattering of Elena and her sisters, it was as silent as a tomb.\\n\\n A rabbit hopped out of the thicket, saw me, and ran back into hiding. He reminded me of poor Count Chermenensky.\\n\\n \"A ruble for your thoughts, Duchess,\" Prince Danilo said, his voice low behind me.\\n\\n Believing my thoughts were truly worth more than that, I merely shook my head. \"It is so beautiful out here,\" I answered.\\n\\n \"You are a true snowbird,\" the crown prince said, taking my hand. \"I prefer the more temperate climates of my home. Yet it does grow bitterly cold in the winter in our mountains.\"\\n\\n I could not help shivering as I remembered my dream. Was there really a temple in Prince Danilo\u0027s Black Mountains?\\n\\n \"You must come and see my beautiful country,\" he said as we walked farther away from the others. \"The trees and the flowers bloom in the spring, and Cetinje is full of fragrant blossoms. We celebrate St. Yuri\u0027s Day when the earth opens up and everything blooms. There is a magnificent church festival.\"\\n\\n \"It sounds lovely,\" I said.\\n\\n The prince took my gloved hand and held it up to his lips. Even through the leather, I could almost feel his warm breath on my skin. I tried not to shudder, because I realized then that the ring was indeed protecting me. I felt nothing for the prince-except fear. \"I hope you will join us in Cetinje for St. Yuri\u0027s Day. Nothing would please me more, Katerina Alexandrovna.\" He smiled, and his teeth gleamed in the cold winter light.\\n\\n I managed to make some noncommittal remark, and the moment passed.\\n\\n But my fears stayed. If anything, they grew stronger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-20.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888.
