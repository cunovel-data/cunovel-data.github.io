{"id":63632,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"I awoke the next morning in a large bed, my head pounding and my bandaged hand throbbing. The prince had drunk my blood. We would now be forever linked. Feeling nauseated at the thought, I started sobbing miserably. How could I have let this happen?\n And now-with my blood-Konstantin had returned. Queen Milena had not realized her sister had been using the talisman to keep her lover\u0027s soul safe. He would go after Tsar Alexander and his family next.\n I climbed out of bed and tried the door. I realized with relief that it was unlocked. But then, the Montenegrins had what they needed from me. They had no reason to keep me imprisoned.\n Princess Militza met me in the hallway. \"Awake at last, I see! Mama will be pleased. Would you like something to eat? She is having tea in the parlor.\"\n \"No, thank you.\" To be truthful, I was afraid of eating or drinking anything else in the palace. \"Have my parents arrived yet?\" She did not answer. \"follow me, Duchess\" was all she said.\n Tea was held in the queen\u0027s parlor, an elegantly decorated room with red silk wall hangings. The walls were covered with portraits of her children.\n \"Duchess, good afternoon,\" Queen Milena greeted me.\n Afternoon? I hurried to the window and drew back the heavy curtains.\n Late-afternoon sun stretched across the courtyard in front of the palace. I saw several carriages slowly driving up and down the street.\n \"You have been sleeping deeply all day. Sit here and have some tea.\"\n \"I am sorry, but my stomach is feeling a little queer at the moment.\n Please forgive me.\"\n \"Oh?\" She placed the pot of tea back on its tray and stared at me with her penetrating black eyes.\n \"We should warn the tsar about Konstantin,\" I said.\n Queen Milena nodded. \"Of course. A telegraph has already been sent to St. Petersburg.\"\n \"What else can we do? How can he be stopped?\" I asked.\n The queen shrugged with a helpless smile. \"I would not have the slightest idea.\"\n \"But-\"\n \"Enough of this. We must discuss your wedding plans.\"\n \"Wedding plans?\" I felt a sickening, cold wave of apprehension wash over me.\n \"Of course. I know how young people are these days. So much in love and in such a hurry to start their lives together.\" She looked directly at me.\n \"I am not allowed to wed before my birthday. I believe my father made that clear.\"\n The queen shook her head dismissively. \"Nonsense. I was fourteen when I married my first husband. Fifteen when I had my first child. You must marry my son and bear him the heirs that he needs while you are young and fertile.\"\n \"Heirs?\" I asked faintly. The room seemed to spin.\n \"Strong sons and plenty of daughters. Heirs to spread our dynasty across Europe. When Elena marries the tsarevitch, her children can marry your children.\"\n \"But they would be first cousins. The Church forbids such marriages.\" Of all the thoughts flitting through my head at once, that was what came out of my mouth first.\n The queen waved her arms. \"The Serbian Church will grant a dispensation for our dynasty.\"\n I could not think of anything to say to her. The woman was mad. \"Your Majesty, what if the tsarevitch marries someone else?\"\n \"You mean the German bitch?\" She laughed. \"Yes, I know all about that one. She is a Protestant and is not willing to change her religion for her precious Nicholas. Besides, there is the little problem of her supernatural ... affliction. The tsar and his empress cannot possibly agree to such an all iance. The tsar looks favorably upon our dynasty. Did he not say Nikola was Russia\u0027s one true friend?\"\n I knew nothing of Princess Alix\u0027s affliction, but everything else the queen said was true. The tsar still considered King Nikola and his wife close all ies. Maman had told me he had been quick to approve my engagement to Danilo. I did not see how he could remain fond of the Montenegrins when he discovered they had released Konstantin. \"How can you know so much about the Hessian princess?\" I asked.\n \"I have spies everywhere, Duchess.\" She stopped stirring her spoon in her teacup. \"I even know of your flirtations with the tsarevitch\u0027s brother.\"\n \"Flirtations?\" I sputtered nervously. \"Your spies must be mistaken. There is no affection between me and the grand duke.\" At least, not on his side.\n \"You are now bound to my son by your blood, and soon you will be bound to him by holy matrimony,\" the queen said as she continued to stir her tea.\n \"I warn you, Katerina Alexandrovna, if you want your family to remain safe from Konstantin and the Dekebristi, you will do exactly as I say and begin to act the part of the happy bride-to-be. I will see Militza and Stana happily married before the tsar learns of Konstantin. The Dekebristi will pledge their loyalty to Militza rather than the lich tsar. And Alexander Alexandrovich will owe his life to us.\"\n I could not stand it anymore. I was tired of feeling helpless. And tired of my loved ones\u0027 safety not being in my own hands. I was still frightened for them, but I was also furious. \"Your Majesty, you have no way of protecting my family from Konstantin, and you have no reason to believe the Dekebristi will follow your daughter instead of their old master. You cannot force me to keep your secrets anymore.\" I was shaking all over, but I did not lower my gaze. \"And you cannot force me to marry your son.\" The queen did not look in the least shocked at my outburst. She smiled.\n \"Dear Katerina, I believe your mother feels quite differently.\" She turned and opened the parlor doors behind her, beyond which my mother stood-\n with Petya and Uncle George.\n Maman rushed to embrace me. I wanted to cry with relief when I smelled her familiar Paris cologne. \"Katiya! Why did you run off so foolishly? We came as quickly as we heard. The king and queen have been most kind.\" I did not know what my mother had been told, but I was ready to leave for St. Petersburg immediately. \"We can leave tonight,\" I told her. \"I have nothing to pack.\"\n \"Mon Dieu, no! We are here to celebrate the crown prince\u0027s birthday.\n The king has promised to show us around the city himself.\"\n \"No, Maman,\" I begged, looking from her to my brother. \"The tsar is in danger. We must return home and warn him.\"\n The queen laughed. \"Dear Katerina. Do not trouble your family with such things. It is time for dinner. Come.\"\n We had no choice but to follow her. Queen Milena took my mother\u0027s arm and discussed the paintings we passed in the hallway. As quietly as I could, I told Petya about everything. Yes, everything.\n My brother was horrified. \"Katiya, you should have told me! I would have protected you!\"\n \"How? They told me you would become one of the undead as well. I couldn\u0027t let that happen.\"\n \"Where did you learn this terrible power? At Smolny? Papa should never have let Maman talk him into sending you to that school.\"\n \"Smolny is not to blame. I think I was born with this curse.\" I reached out and grabbed his hands. \"You must warn the tsar, Petya. Can you get away tonight?\"\n \"And leave you and Maman in the blood drinkers\u0027 clutches? The palace is surrounded by guards. We will all leave together in the morning.\"\n \"Are you sure they will allow us to go?\" I asked.\n Petya thought silently as we approached the dining room. \"We mustn\u0027t tell Maman. Not before we get her safely away from here. She would become hysterical.\"\n \"When is she not hysterical?\" I asked glumly.\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Petya said. \"Surely at some point tonight, she\u0027ll get upset over some nonsense. We will then tell the Montenegrins that Maman is ill and we must take her back home to her own doctor.\" I knew it would not take much for Maman to have one of her hysterical fits. Telling her about the Vladiki would definitely serve such a purpose. But I also knew that if the Montenegrins discovered I\u0027d told anyone about the Black Mountain ritual, my family would be killed. Petya I could trust to keep silent. Maman I could not.\n We enjoyed more local cuisine that night at dinner. Uncle George was happy to discuss military matters with King Nikola and Princess Zorka\u0027s husband.\n Young, romantic Anna did not take her eyes off my brother the entire evening. And Danilo never took his eyes off me.\n Everyone was excruciatingly polite. My nerves were on edge as I waited for something horrible to happen.\n Maman complimented the queen on her beautiful palace. \"The grand duchess Miechen has a boudoir decorated in the Moroccan style, very similar to this,\" she said.\n \"Does she indeed?\" the queen replied, sipping her soup.\n The women discussed wedding plans for Militza and Stana. \"Now let us discuss plans for Danilo and Katerina\u0027s wedding,\" Queen Milena said as the servants served us glasses of sherry.\n Maman did not smile. \"I believe this has already been settled. We will not allow Katerina to marry before she is of age.\"\n \"Perhaps you may change your mind if your daughter was found to be in a delicate situation.\"\n Maman\u0027s face grew white with shock as she realized what the queen was implying. \"Katiya, what have you done?\"\n \"Nothing, Maman,\" I protested. At least, not what she suspected. I felt violated all the same.\n The queen laughed. \"It could happen, Duchess. They are young and their passions are hot. It has been difficult for my husband and me to keep this pair apart.\"\n I shuddered with disgust.\n But the queen\u0027s suggestion did frighten my mother. I could almost hear her thoughts.\n \"I ... well ...\"\n \"Maman, you know I would never do anything to disappoint you or Papa.\n ...\" Besides raising the dead, that is.\n \"I must speak with my husband.\" Maman\u0027s glass of sherry trembled slightly as she raised it to her lips.\n \"We are already planning two weddings in St. Petersburg for next month.\n It would be simple to arrange a third as well.\" Queen Milena smiled. She knew she already had my mother convinced I needed to be married off immediately. \"Cost is no consequence, of course.\"\n \"Of course. It does seem the sensible thing to do,\" Maman said. She had a glassy look in her eyes as she sipped her sherry.\n The queen smiled at me. I had to break her hold over my mother. I would rather die than marry Prince Danilo. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-51.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) \n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888.
