As she attends a whirl of glittering balls, royal debutante Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, tries to hide a dark secret: she can raise the dead. No one knows. Not her family. Not the girls at her finishing school. Not the tsar or anyone in her aristocratic circle. Katerina considers her talent a curse, not a gift. But when she uses her special skill to protect a member of the Imperial Family, she finds herself caught in a web of intrigue. \\n An evil presence is growing within Europe\u0027s royal bloodlines—and those aligned with the darkness threaten to topple the tsar. Suddenly Katerina\u0027s strength as a necromancer attracts attention from unwelcome sources . . . including two young men—George Alexandrovich, the tsar\u0027s standoffish middle son, who needs Katerina\u0027s help to safeguard Russia, even if he\u0027s repelled by her secret, and the dashing Prince Danilo, heir to the throne of Montenegro, to whom Katerina feels inexplicably drawn. \\n The time has come for Katerina to embrace her power, but which side will she choose—and to whom will she give her heart?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1.jpg","author":"Robin Bridges","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
