He continued to keep his rooms at Betskoi House, but he often slept at the barracks with his friends. \"No, he must have stayed at Vorontsov Palace,\" Papa said. \"How are you feeling this morning?\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said. Taking a deep breath, I picked up a warm piece of brown bread and coated it with strawberry jam. \"Papa, I\u0027m truly happy with my decision. I want you to be happy for me as well.\" I gave him a smile, and I saw his face relax. He said nothing but raised his cup of tea to me. \"We have so much work to do,\" Maman said. \"Instead of hiding in Biarritz, now we can go to Paris to look at wedding dresses. Do you remember the gown Grand Duchess Elizabeth wore? Very simple, but elegant. You would look better in something a little more daring. Your neck is one of your best features.\" I tried not to blush, thinking of Prince Danilo\u0027s hands on my throat the night before. \"I liked the grand duchess\u0027s dress.\" Maman laughed and continued chattering. \"What about the gown your aunt Zina chose? The Worth gown with all the little white feathers?\" I wondered what she would say if I admitted I detested feathers, but Papa already looked as if he were being tortured. I winked at him. \"I am sure we will find something hideously expensive and horridly tasteless, which will have all of St. Petersburg talking for years.\" I stood up and kissed both of them on their cheeks. I was on my way back to my room when my brother returned home, looking very haggard. It had been a rough night for him. \"Petya!\" I ran and hugged him, relieved that he was unhurt. \"What has happened?\" \"I cannot discuss it, Katiya,\" he said with a tired sigh. \"The actions of the Order are secret.\" But he did discuss it with Papa. I wrapped myself in the sheult spell and stood outside my father\u0027s office while he and Petya argued about the safety of the Order. \"Demidov was poisoned,\" Papa said. \"I read the report myself. By hemlock.\" \"What sort of a creature uses hemlock?\" Petya asked. He sounded incredulous. \"Is the Order truly cursed, as the cadets say?\" \"Of course not,\" Papa said. \"You\u0027re being superstitious. But it\u0027s the damnedest thing. The girls at Smolny who took ill were poisoned with hemlock as well.\" \"Is Katiya safe there?\" \"Yes, for now.\" I heard Papa chuckle. \"Kruglevski told me she had him check her blood to be certain.\" \"She is too headstrong to stay out of trouble,\" Petya said. \"She should be here at home, where you can keep an eye on her.\" \"I must say, I\u0027m unhappy about her marrying the crown prince. I thought she wanted to focus on her education. But if it\u0027s what she wants, I cannot forbid the marriage.\" I could hear my brother\u0027s boots clomping on the floor as he paced back and forth. \"There are rumors of the royal family having dark powers, Papa. I think you should look into their bloodline before agreeing to the engagement.\" \"King Nikola has pledged his loyalty to the Bear. If his family uses their powers to support the tsar, how could Katiya be in danger?\" \"Perhaps she will be safe,\" Petya said, but he did not sound convinced. I leaned back against the wall. My brother cared more about me than I\u0027d ever realized. I didn\u0027t want him to get hurt-or worse-trying to protect me. \"The War Ministry has been receiving reports of an increase in animal attacks,\" he went on. \"People have been seeing wolves in the city at night.\" \"The tsar has always tolerated the wolf-folk as long as they behave.\" I heard Papa set his glass down. \"But if they become a danger to the people of St. Petersburg, he will force them to leave.\" \"But the teeth marks on Demidov\u0027s neck were not animal but human bite marks,\" Petya said. \"The general fears it was another of the creatures that attacked him.\" I wanted to tell my father and my brother about the Montenegrins, but I couldn\u0027t endanger them by revealing the secrets of Danilo and his family. I wondered if Grand Duke George knew of Prince Demidov\u0027s blood test. I was eager to discuss it with him at the ball that evening. I smiled, wondering what the chances were of the grand duke asking me to dance that night. Then my stomach lurched as I remembered. I was engaged to Prince Danilo again. I could not dance with anyone but him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-37.html","bookId":2654,"book":{"id":2654,"title":"The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1)","description":"Storyline: The Gathering Storm (Katerina #1) St. Petersburg, Russia, 1888. As she attends a whirl of glittering balls, royal debutante Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, tries to hide a dark secret: she can raise the dead. No one knows. Not her family. Not the girls at her finishing school. Not the tsar or anyone in her aristocratic circle. Katerina considers her talent a curse, not a gift. But when she uses her special skill to protect a member of the Imperial Family, she finds herself caught in a web of intrigue. An evil presence is growing within Europe\u0027s royal bloodlines—and those aligned with the darkness threaten to topple the tsar. Suddenly Katerina\u0027s strength as a necromancer attracts attention from unwelcome sources . . . including two young men—George Alexandrovich, the tsar\u0027s standoffish middle son, who needs Katerina\u0027s help to safeguard Russia, even if he\u0027s repelled by her secret, and the dashing Prince Danilo, heir to the throne of Montenegro, to whom Katerina feels inexplicably drawn. The time has come for Katerina to embrace her power, but which side will she choose—and to whom will she give her heart?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1.jpg","author":"Robin Bridges","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:55 AM"}}
