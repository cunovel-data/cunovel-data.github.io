{"id":32704,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 7: Pressed.","content":"Many and deep were the maledictions uttered, as the smugglers climbed on board their vessel; but their captain said cheerily: \"Never mind, lads, it might have been worse. It was only the first cargo of tubs, and half of those weren\u0027t ashore. The lace and silk are all right, so no great harm is done. Set to work, and get up sail as soon as you can. Likely enough there is a cutter in the offing; that blue light must have been a signal. They seem to have got news of our landing, somehow.\" The crew at once set to work to get up sail. Three or four of the countrymen, who had, like James, got on board the boats, stood in a group looking on, confused and helpless; but James lent his assistance, until the sails were hoisted and the craft began to move through the water. \"Now, then,\" the captain said, \"let us go below and look at the wounds. We daren\u0027t show a light, here on deck.\" The wounds were, for the most part, slashes and blows with cutlasses; for in the darkness and confusion of the fight, only two of the bullets had taken effect. One of the smugglers had fallen, shot through the head, while one of those on board had his arm broken by a pistol ball. \"Now for our passengers,\" the captain said, after the wounds had been bandaged. \"Who are you?\" and he lifted a lantern to James\u0027s face. \"Why, it is young Mr. Walsham!\" he exclaimed in surprise. James knew the man now, for the lugger had several times put in at Sidmouth, where, coming in as a peaceable trader, the revenue officers, although well aware of the nature of her vocation, were unable to touch her, as vessels could only be seized when they had contraband on board. \"Why, what brings you into this affair, young master?\" James related the conversation he had overheard, and his determination to warn the smugglers of their danger. \"I should have managed it, in plenty of time, if I had known the exact spot on which you were going to land; but I saw a signal light, two miles down the coast, and that kept me there for half an hour. It struck me, then, it was a ruse to attract the officers from the real spot of landing, but though I ran as hard as I could, I was only just before them.\" \"Thank you heartily,\" the smuggler said. \"I expect you saved us from a much worse mess than we got into. I have no doubt they meant to capture the tubs, as they were loaded, without raising an alarm; and the fellows on the shore would have come up quietly, and taken us by surprise as we were landing the last boat loads. Thanks to you, we have got well out of it, and have only lost one of our hands, and a score or so of tubs.\" \"You can\u0027t put me ashore, I suppose?\" James said. \"That I can\u0027t,\" the smuggler replied. \"I have no doubt that cutter from Weymouth is somewhere outside us, and we must get well off the coast before morning. If we give her the slip, I will send you off in a boat sometime tomorrow. I must go ashore, myself, to make fresh arrangements for getting my cargo landed.\" James went on deck again. The breeze was light, and the lugger was slipping along quietly through the water. He could faintly see the loom of the cliffs on his right, and knew that the lugger was running west, keeping as close inshore as she could, to avoid the cutter watching for her outside. He wondered what they would say at home, when it was found that he was missing; but consoled himself by thinking that his mother, who was still up at the Hall, would no doubt suppose that he had gone out for a night\u0027s fishing, as he had often done before, and that, as she was away, he had forgotten to leave word with the servant. Suddenly, a blue light burned out on the top of the cliff. An angry exclamation broke from the captain, who was standing at the helm. \"Confound it!\" he exclaimed. \"They have caught sight of us from the cliff, and are signalling our whereabouts to the cutter.\" As he spoke, he turned the vessel\u0027s head seaward, and, for a quarter of an hour, sailed straight out. \"Now,\" he said quietly, \"I think we must be out of sight of those fellows on shore. Get her on the other tack, lads, but be as quiet as you can about it. There\u0027s no saying how close the cutter may be to us.\" The great sails were lowered, as the boat\u0027s head paid off to the east. The yards were shifted to the other sides of the masts, and the sails hoisted again, and the lugger began to retrace her way back along the coast. \"It\u0027s just a chance, now,\" the captain said to James, who was standing close by him, \"whether the commander of the cutter guesses, or not, that we shall change our course. He will know we are likely enough to do it.\" \"What should you do if you were in his place?\" James said. \"I should run straight out to sea, and lay to, eight or ten miles off. He would be able to make us out then at daylight, whichever course we take; whereas, by trying to follow in the dark, he would run the chance of missing us altogether. I wish the wind would get up a bit. We are not moving through the water more than three knots an hour, and it\u0027s dying away. However, I fancy it will blow up again in the morning.\" \"Do you know whether she is faster than you are?\" James asked. \"There is not much difference,\" the captain replied. \"If the wind is strong, we have the legs of her; but in a light breeze, she is the fastest. She has chased us half a dozen times already, but we have always given her the slip.\" \"Then, even if she does run out to sea, as you say,\" James said, \"we ought to be safe, as we should be a dozen miles or so along the coast.\" \"Yes, but not that ahead of her,\" the captain answered, \"for she would be so much to the seaward. Still, that would be far enough; but she will begin to fire long before we are in range, and will bring any other king\u0027s ship within hearing down on us. However, I daresay we shall give her the slip, as we have done before.\" The hours passed slowly. The wind continued to drop, until the vessel scarcely moved through the water, and, after a while, the sweeps were got out, and were worked until the day broke. All eyes were on the lookout for the cutter, as the day dawn began to steal over the sky. \"There she is, sure enough,\" the captain exclaimed at length, \"lying to on the watch, some eight miles to the west. She must have seen us, for we are against the light sky; but, like, ourselves, she is becalmed.\" It was a quarter of an hour, however, before the position of the cutter was seen to change. Then her head was suddenly turned east. \"She has got the wind,\" the captain said. \"Now we only want a good breeze, and you\u0027ll have a lively day of it, lads.\" From the time when she had turned, the lugger had made only about eight miles along the coast to the east, and an equal distance seaward, for the tide had set against her. The morning was bright and clear, the sea was perfectly smooth. As yet, the sails hung idly down, but there were dark lines on the water that showed that a breeze was coming. \"We shall have plenty of wind presently,\" the skipper said. \"See how light the sky is to the south. There will be white tops on the waves in an hour or two. \"Here comes a flaw. Haul in your sheets, lads, now she begins to move.\" The puff did not last long, dying away to nothing in a few minutes, and then the lugger lay immovable again. The men whistled, stamped the deck impatiently, and cast anxious glances back at the cutter. \"She is walking along fast,\" the skipper said, as he examined her through a glass. \"She has got the wind steady, and must be slipping along at six knots an hour. This is hard luck on us. If we don\u0027t get the breeze soon, it will be a close thing of it.\" Another quarter of an hour passed without a breath of wind ruffling the water. The cutter was fully two miles nearer to them than when she had first been seen, and was holding the wind steadily. \"Here it comes, lads,\" the skipper said cheerfully. \"Another ten minutes, and we shall have our share.\" The time seemed long, indeed, before the dark line on the water reached the lugger, and there was something like a cheer, from the crew, as the craft heeled slightly over, and then began to move through the water. It was the true breeze this time, and increased every moment in force, till the lugger was lying well over, with a white wave at her bow. But the cutter had first gained by the freshening breeze, and James Walsham, looking back at her, judged that there were not more than four miles of water between the boats. The breeze was nearly due west, and, as the lugger was headed as close as she would lie to it, the cutter had hauled in her sheets and lay up on the same course, so that they were now sailing almost parallel to each other. \"If we could change places,\" the skipper said, \"we should be safe. We can sail nearer the wind than she can, but she can edge away now, and has all the advantage of us.\" James had already perceived this, and wondered that the lugger did not pay off before the wind, so as to make a stern chase of it. \"I want to get a few miles farther out,\" the skipper said. \"Likely enough there is another cutter somewhere inshore. It is quite enough to have one of these fellows at one\u0027s heels.\" Another half hour and the cutter, edging in, was little over three miles distant. Then the skipper gave the word, the helm was put down, the sheets slackened off, and, in a minute, the lugger was running dead before the wind with her sails boomed out, one on either side. The cutter followed her example, and hoisted a large square sail. The wind was blowing fresh now, and the sea was getting up. Not a cloud was to be seen in the sky, and the sun shone brightly on the white heads which were beginning to show on the water. The lugger was tearing along, occasionally throwing a cloud of spray over her bows, and leaving a track of white water behind her. \"I think she still gains on us,\" the captain said to the mate, who had taken the helm. \"Ay, she is gaining,\" the sailor agreed, \"but the wind is freshening every minute. She can\u0027t carry that topsail much longer. It\u0027s pressing her bows under now.\" \"She will go almost as fast without it,\" the skipper said. The commander of the cutter seemed to be of the same opinion, for, just as he spoke, the topsail was seen to flutter, and then descended to the deck. It was a quarter of an hour before the skipper spoke again. \"I think we just about hold our own,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t think the Polly could have held her running.\" \"She couldn\u0027t, in a light wind,\" the mate replied; \"but with this wind, it will want a fast boat to beat her.\" The hands were now set to work, shifting the kegs further aft. \"That\u0027s better,\" the skipper said presently. \"I am sure we are gaining ground, and our masts will stand it, if the cutter\u0027s will.\" With her stern low in the water, the lugger was now tearing along at a tremendous pace. Stout as were her masts, and strong the stays, James Walsham wondered at their standing the strain of the great brown sails, as they seemed, at times, almost to lift her bodily out of the water. Buoyant as the craft was, the waves broke over her bows and flooded her decks, and sheets of spray flew over her. The cutter, with her sharper bows and all her sail forward, was feeling it still more severely, and the spirits of all on board the lugger rose rapidly, as it was evident that they were dropping their pursuers. Suddenly, the gaff of the cutter\u0027s mainsail was seen to droop, and the boom was hauled on board. \"I thought it would be too much for them,\" the skipper said exultantly. \"They are going to reef.\" \"We had better reef down too, I think,\" the mate said. \"She has had as much as she could bear for some time.\" \"I\u0027ll hold on ten minutes longer,\" the skipper said. \"Every half mile counts.\" But before that time was up, the sails were one after another reefed, for the wind continued to freshen. The sky was still cloudless, but there was a misty light in the air, and a heavy sea was beginning to run. Suddenly, a gun flashed out from the cutter. The skipper uttered an oath. Their pursuer was more than three miles astern, and he knew that she could only be firing as a signal. There were several large ships in sight on their way up or down the Channel. To these, little attention had been paid. The skipper shaded his eyes with a hand, and gazed earnestly at a large ship on the weather beam, some four miles away. \"That is a frigate, sure enough,\" he exclaimed. \"We are fairly caught between them. \"Haul in the sheets, lads, we will have a try for it yet.\" The lugger was brought sharp up into the wind, and was soon staggering along seaward, with the lee bulwark almost under water. The cutter instantly lowered her square sail, and followed her example, continuing to fire a gun every minute. All eyes were turned towards the frigate, which was now on the port beam. \"We shall cross two miles to windward of her,\" the skipper said. \"If she keeps on her course, a quarter of an hour will do it, but she is sure to notice the guns. The wind will take them down to her. \"Ah, there she goes.\" As he spoke, a puff of smoke darted out from the frigate\u0027s bow. Her sails fluttered, and her head bore round, until she was on the same tack as the lugger. The latter was now about equidistant from her two pursuers. The cutter and the lugger were nearly abreast, but the former, being to windward, could edge down. The frigate was three miles to leeward, but she was fully a mile ahead. \"There is no way out of it,\" the skipper said bitterly. \"In a light wind we could run away from the frigate, but with this breeze we have no chance with her. Look how she is piling on sail!\" The crew shared the captain\u0027s opinion. Some shook their fists and cursed vainly at their pursuers, some stood sullenly scowling, while the French portion of the crew gave way to wild outbursts of rage. Rapidly the three vessels closed in towards each other, for the cutter edged in so rapidly that the lugger was obliged to bear off towards the frigate again. As a last hope, the lugger\u0027s course was changed, and she again tried running, but the superior weight and power of the frigate brought her rapidly down. Presently a heavy gun boomed out, and a shot came dancing along the water, a hundred yards away. \"Lower the sails,\" the skipper said. \"It is no use going farther. The inside of a prison is better than the bottom of the sea, anyhow.\" Down came the sails, and the lugger lay rolling heavily in the waves, as the frigate bore down upon her with a white roll of water on her stem. \"Get ready, lads,\" the skipper said. \"There is just one chance yet. She will run by us. The instant she is past, up sail again. We shall be a mile away before they can get her round into the wind again. If she doesn\u0027t cripple us with her shot, we may weather her yet. We needn\u0027t mind the cutter.\" The frigate came foaming along, the crew busy in taking sail off her. The instant she had passed, and was preparing to round to, the sails of the lugger flew up like magic, and she was soon tearing along almost in the eye of the wind, as if to meet the cutter, which was running down towards her. \"Down below, lads, every man of you,\" the captain shouted. \"We shall have a broadside in a minute.\" In a moment, the deck was clear of all save the skipper and his mate, who stood at the tiller. The frigate swept slowly round, and then, as her guns came to bear, shot after shot was fired at the lugger, already three-quarters of a mile to the windward. The shot hummed overhead, one struck the water alongside, a yard or two away, but still she was untouched. \"Some of her shots went as near the cutter as they did to us,\" the skipper said. \"She won\u0027t fire again.\" They were now fast approaching the cutter, which, when she was within a quarter of a mile, changed her course and was brought up again into the wind, firing the four guns she carried on her broadside as she came round. The lugger\u0027s head was paid off, and this placed the cutter on her starboard quarter, both going free. The former was travelling the faster, but a gun was fired from the cutter\u0027s bow, and the shot struck splinters from the lugger\u0027s quarter. The crew were on deck again now. \"Train that gun over the stern,\" the skipper said. \"If we can knock her mast out of her, we are saved. If not, they will have us yet.\" He had scarcely spoken when there was a crash. A shot from the cutter had struck the mizzen mast, a few feet above the deck, and the mast and sail fell over to leeward. There was a cry of rage and dismay. \"Luck\u0027s against us,\" the skipper said bitterly. \"Down with the sail, lads. This time it is all up with us.\" The sail was lowered, and the lugger lay motionless in the water, until the cutter came up and lay within fifty yards of her. A boat was at once lowered, and an officer was rowed to the lugger. \"So we have caught you, my friends, at last,\" he said, as he sprang on board. \"You wouldn\u0027t have done it, if it had not been for the frigate,\" the skipper said. \"No; I will say your craft sails like a witch,\" the officer replied. \"I wish we could have done it without her. It will make all the difference to us. The frigate will get the lion\u0027s share of the prize. What is the value of your cargo?\" \"Two hundred kegs of brandy,\" the skipper replied, \"and fifteen hundred pounds\u0027 worth of lace and silks.\" \"A good prize,\" the officer said. \"Not your own, I hope, for you have made a brave chase of it.\" \"No,\" the skipper answered. \"Fortunately, I only took a very small share this time. It\u0027s bad enough to lose my boat; I own two-thirds of her.\" \"I am sorry for you,\" the officer said, for he was in high spirits at the success of the chase, and could afford to be pleasant. \"Here comes a boat from the frigate. You played them a rare trick, and might have got off, if it hadn\u0027t been for that lucky shot of ours. \"I see you were just getting out a stern chaser,\" and he pointed to the gun. \"It is well for you that you didn\u0027t fire it, as you can\u0027t be charged with armed resistance.\" \"I wish I had fired it, for all that. It might have been my luck to cripple you.\" \"It would have made no difference if you had,\" the officer replied. \"The frigate would have overhauled you. With this wind she would sail five feet to your four.\" The boat from the frigate now came alongside. \"How are you, Cotterel?\" the officer said, as he stepped on board. \"That was a lucky shot of yours; but I think it\u0027s lucky for the lugger that you hit her, for the captain was so savage, at that trick they played him, that I believe he would have sunk her when he came up to her again. I heard him say to the first lieutenant, \u0027I won\u0027t give her a chance to play me such a trick again.\u0027\" \"What orders have you brought?\" the other asked. \"We are outward bound, so you are to put a crew on board and take her into port; but, as we are very short of hands, we will relieve you of the prisoners.\" All on board the lugger were at once ordered into the frigate\u0027s boat, and were rowed off to the ship. On gaining the deck, they were drawn up in line, and the captain and first lieutenant came up. The good humour of the former had been restored by the capture of the lugger. \"Hallo!\" he said, looking at the bandaged heads and arms of some of the men, \"so you have been having a fight trying to run your cargo, I suppose. That will make it all the worse for you, when you get on shore. Now, I might press you all without giving you a choice, but I don\u0027t want unwilling hands, so I will leave it to you. Which is it to be--an English prison for two or three years, or a cruise on board the Thetis?\" The greater part of the men at once stepped forward, and announced their willingness to volunteer. \"Who have we here,\" the captain asked, looking at the three countrymen. \"They are passengers, sir,\" the skipper of the lugger said, with a half smile. A few questions brought to light the facts of the surprise while the cargo was being landed. \"Well, my lads,\" the captain said, \"you are in the same boat with the rest. You were engaged in an unlawful enterprise, and in resisting his majesty\u0027s officers. You will get some months in prison anyhow, if you go back. You had better stay on board, and let me make men of you.\" The countrymen, however, preferred a prison to a man o\u0027 war. James Walsham had been turning over the matter in his mind. He had certainly taken no part in the fray, but that would be difficult to prove, and he could not account for his presence except by acknowledging that he was there to warn them. It would certainly be a case of imprisonment. Surely, it would be better to volunteer than this. He had been longing for the sea, and here an opportunity opened for him for abandoning the career his mother intended for him, without setting himself in opposition to her wishes. Surely she would prefer that he should be at sea for a year or two to his being disgraced by imprisonment. He therefore now stepped forward. \"I do not belong to the lugger\u0027s crew, sir, and had nothing to do with running their cargo, though I own I was on the spot at the time. I am not a sailor, though I have spent a good deal of time on board fishing boats. Mr. Horton, whom I see there, knows me, and will tell you that I am a son of a doctor in Sidmouth. But, as I have got into a scrape, I would rather serve than go back and stand a trial.\" \"Very well, my lad,\" the captain said. \"I like your spirit, and will keep my eye on you.\" The three countrymen and four of the French sailors, who declined to join the Thetis, were taken back to the cutter, and the Thetis at once proceeded on her way down channel. James had given a hastily scribbled line, on the back of an old letter which he happened to have in his pocket, to the men who were to be taken ashore, but he had very little hope that it would ever reach his mother. Nor, indeed, did it ever do so. When the cutter reached Weymouth with the lugger, the men captured in her were at once sent to prison, where they remained until they were tried at assizes three months afterwards; and, although all were acquitted of the charge of unlawful resistance to the king\u0027s officers, as there was no proof against any of the six men individually, they were sentenced to a year\u0027s imprisonment for smuggling. Whether Jim\u0027s hurriedly written letter was thrown overboard, or whether it was carried in the pocket of the man to whom he gave it until worn into fragments, James never knew, but it never reached his mother. The news that James was missing was brought to her upon the day after the event by Mr. Wilks. He had, as usual, gone down after breakfast to report how Aggie was getting on, with a message from his mother that her charge was now so completely restored that it was unnecessary for her to stay longer at the Hall, and that she should come home that evening at her usual time. Hearing from the girl that James had not returned since he went out at nine o\u0027clock on the previous evening, the old soldier sauntered down to the beach, to inquire of the fishermen in whose boat James had gone out. To his surprise, he found that none of the boats had put to sea the evening before. The men seemed less chatty and communicative than usual. Most of them were preparing to go out with their boats, and none seemed inclined to enter into a conversation. Rather wondering at their unusual reticence, Mr. Wilks strolled along to where the officer of the revenue men was standing, with his boatswain, watching the fishermen. \"A fine morning, lieutenant.\" \"Yes,\" the latter assented. \"There will be wind presently. Have you heard of the doings of last night?\" \"No,\" Mr. Wilks said in surprise, \"I have heard nothing. I was just speaking to the fishermen, but they don\u0027t seem in as communicative a mood as usual this morning.\" \"The scamps know it is safest for them to keep their mouths shut, just at present,\" the officer said grimly. \"I have no doubt a good many of them were concerned in that affair last night. We had a fight with the smugglers. Two of my men were shot and one of theirs, and there were a good many cutlass wounds on each side. We have taken a score of prisoners, but they are all country people who were assisting in the landing; the smugglers themselves all got off. We made a mess of the affair altogether, thanks to some fellow who rushed down and gave the alarm, and upset all the plans we had laid. \"It is too provoking. I had got news of the exact spot and hour at which the landing was to take place. I had my men all up on the cliff, and, as the fellows came up with kegs, they were to have been allowed to get a hundred yards or so inland and would there have been seized, and any shout they made would not have been heard below. Lieutenant Fisher, with his party from the next station, was to be a little way along at the foot of the cliffs, and when the boats came with the second batch, he was to rush forward and capture them, while we came down from above. Then we intended to row off and take the lugger. There was not wind enough for her to get away. \"All was going well, and the men were just coming up the cliff with the tubs, when someone who had passed us on the cliff ran down shouting the alarm. We rushed down at once, but arrived too late. They showed fight, and kept us back till Fisher\u0027s party came up; but by that time the boats were afloat, and the smugglers managed to get in and carry them off, in spite of us. We caught, as I tell you, some of the countrymen, and Fisher has taken them off to Weymouth, but most of them got away. There are several places where the cliff can be climbed by men who know it, and I have no doubt half those fishermen you see there were engaged in the business.\" \"Then the smuggler got away?\" Mr. Wilks asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\" the lieutenant said shortly. \"I had sent word to Weymouth, and I hope they will catch her in the offing. The lugger came down this way first, but we made her out, and showed a blue light. She must have turned and gone back again, for this morning at daylight we made her out to the east. The cutter was giving chase, and at first ran down fast towards her. Then the smugglers got the wind, and the last we saw of them they were running up the Channel, the cutter some three miles astern. \"I would give a couple of months\u0027 pay to know who it was that gave the alarm. I expect it was one of those fishermen. As far as my men could make out in the darkness, the fellow was dressed as a sailor. But I must say good morning, for I am just going to turn in.\" Mr. Wilks had been on the point of mentioning that James was missing, but a vague idea that he might, in some way, be mixed up with the events of the previous night, checked the question on his lips; and yet he thought, as the officer walked away, it was not probable. Had James been foolish enough to take part in such a business, he would either have been taken prisoner, or would, after he escaped, have returned home. He had evidently not been taken prisoner, or the officer would have been sure to mention it. Much puzzled, he walked slowly back to the fishermen. Some of the boats had already pushed off. He went up to three of the men, whose boat, being higher up than the rest, would not be afloat for another quarter of an hour. \"Look here, lads,\" he said. \"My young friend Jim Walsham is missing this morning, and hasn\u0027t been at home all night. As none of the fishing boats put out in the evening he cannot have gone to sea. Can any of you tell me anything about him?\" The men gave no answer. \"You need not be afraid of speaking to me, you know,\" he went on, \"and it\u0027s no business of mine whether any of the men on the shore were concerned in that affair. The lieutenant has just been telling me of last night; but hearing of that, and finding Jim is missing, I can\u0027t help thinking there is some connection between the two things. Nothing you say to me will go further, that I can promise you; but the lad\u0027s mother will be in a terrible way. I can\u0027t make it out, for I know that, if he had anything to do with this smuggling business, he would have told me. Again, if he was there and got away, he would naturally have come straight home, for his absence would only throw suspicion upon him.\" \"Well, Mr. Wilks,\" the youngest of the sailors said, \"I don\u0027t know nothing about it myself. No one does, so far as I know, but I have heard say this morning as how he was there or thereabouts; but don\u0027t you let out as I told you, \u0027cause they would want to know who I heard it from.\" \"You can rely upon my silence, my lad, and here\u0027s half a guinea to drink my health between you. But can\u0027t you tell me a little more?\" \"Well, sir, they do say as how it war Mr. Jim as came running down into the middle of them on the beach, shouting the alarm, with the revenue men close at his heels. I don\u0027t say as it were he--likely enough it weren\u0027t--but that\u0027s the talk, and that\u0027s all I have heared about the matter. How he came for to know of it, or how he got there, no one knows, for sartin he has had nought to do with any landings afore. He was a lot among us, but I know as he never was told about it; for, though everyone would have trusted Jim, still, seeing how he was placed, with his mother up at the Hall, and the squire a magistrate, it was thought better as he shouldn\u0027t be let into it. Everyone on the shore here likes Jim.\" \"But if he was there, and he hasn\u0027t been taken prisoner--and I am sure the lieutenant would have told me if he was--why shouldn\u0027t he have got home?\" \"We didn\u0027t know as he hadn\u0027t got home, did us, Bill?\" the fisherman appealed to one of his comrades. \"No,\" the other said. \"We thought likely he had got safely away with the rest. It war a dark night, and I expect as everyone was too busy looking after himself to notice about others.\" \"He may have been wounded,\" the old soldier said anxiously, \"and may be in hiding in some house near the place.\" The fisherman was silent. Such a thing was, of course, possible. \"He might that,\" one of the sailors said doubtfully, \"and yet I don\u0027t think it. The chase was a hot one, and I don\u0027t think anyone, wounded so bad as he couldn\u0027t make his way home, would have got away. I should say as it wur more likely as he got on board one of the boats. It seems to me as though he might have come to warn us--that is to say, to warn them, I mean--just to do em a good turn, as he was always ready to do if he had the chance. But he wouldn\u0027t have had anything to do with the scrimmage, and might have been standing, quiet like, near the boats, when the other lot came along the shore, and then, seeing as the game was up, he might, likely enough, have jumped on board and gone off to the lugger.\" \"That is possible,\" Mr. Wilks said. \"Anyhow, I will go off at once, and make inquiries at all the houses within a mile or so of the landing place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3103/85478.html","bookId":941,"book":{"id":941,"title":"With Wolfe in Canada","description":"简介： In the present volume I have endeavoured to give the details of the principal events in a struggle whose importance can hardly be overrated.
