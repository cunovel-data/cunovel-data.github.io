{"id":6867,"no":6,"title":"6 \"THE LITTLE APOCRYPHA","content":"　　\"My face and hands were badly burnt. I remembered noticing a jar of anti-burn ointment when Iwas looking for sleeping pills for Rheya (I was in no mood to laugh at my na.vete), so I wentback to my room. \n \n I opened the door. The room was glowing in the red twilight. Someone was sitting in thearmchair where Rheya had knelt. For a second or two, I was paralysed with terror, filled withan overwhelming desire to turn and run. Then the seated figure raised its head: it was Snow. \n \n His legs crossed, still wearing the acid-stained trousers, he was looking through some papers, apile of which lay on a small table beside him. He put down those he was holding in his hand,let his glasses slide down his nose, and scowled up at me. \n \n Without saying a word, I went to the basin, took the ointment out of the medicine chest andapplied it to my forehead and cheeks. Fortunately my face was not too swollen and my eyes,which I had closed instinctively, did not seem to be inflamed. I lanced some large blisters onmy temples and cheekbones with a sterilized needle; they exuded a serous liquid, which Imopped up with an antiseptic pad. Then I applied some gauze dressing. \n \n Snow watched me throughout these first-aid operations, but I paid no attention to him. When atlast I had finished (and my burns had become even more painful), I sat myself down in theother chair. I had first to remove Rheya\u0027s dress—that apparently quite normal dress which wasnevertheless devoid of fastenings. \n \n Snow, his hands clasped around one bony knee, continued to observe me with a critical air. \n \n \"Well, are you ready to have a chat?\" he asked. \n \n I did not answer; I was busy replacing a piece of gauze which had slipped down one cheek. \n \n \"You\u0027ve had a visitor, haven\u0027t you?\"\"Yes,\" I answered curtly. \n \n He had begun the conversation on a note which I found displeasing. \n \n \"And you\u0027ve rid yourself of it already? Well, well! That was quick!\"He touched his forehead, which was still peeling and mottled with pink patches of new skim. Iwas thunderstruck. Why had I not realized before the implications of Snow\u0027s and Sartorius\u0027s\u0027sunburn\u0027? No one exposed himself to the sun here. \n \n Without noticing my sudden change of expression he went on: \n \n \"I imagine you didn\u0027t try extreme methods straight away. What did you use first—drugs,poison, judo?\"\"Do you want to discuss the thing seriously or play the fool? If you don\u0027t want to help, you canleave me in peace.\"He half-closed his eyes. \n \n \"Sometimes one plays the fool in spite of oneself. Did you try the rope, or the hammer? Or thewell-aimed ink-bottle, like Luther? No?\" He grimaced, \"Aren\u0027t you a fast worker! The basin isstill intact, you haven\u0027t banged your head against the walls, you haven\u0027t even turned the roomupside down. One, two and into the rocket, just like that!\" He looked at his watch. \n \n \"Consequently, we have two or three hours at our disposal…. Am I getting on your nerves?\" headded, with a disagreeable smile. \n \n \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \n \n \"Really? Well, if I tell you a little story, will you believe me?\"I said nothing. \n \n Still with that hideous smile, he went on: \n \n \"It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his cabin and refused to talk to us exceptthrough the door. And can you guess what we thought?\"I remained silent. \n \n \"Naturally, we thought he had gone mad. He let a bit of it out—through the locked door—butnot everything. You may wonder why he didn\u0027t tell us that there was someone with him. Oh,suum cuique! But he was a true scientist. He begged us to let him take his chance!\"\"What chance?\"\"He was obviously doing his damnedest to solve the problem, to get to the bottom of it. Heworked day and night. You know what he was doing? You must know.\"\"Those calculations, in the drawer of the radio-cabin—were they his?\"\"Yes.\"\"How long did it go on?\"\"This visit? About a week…We thought he was suffering from hallucinations, or having anervous breakdown. I gave him some scopolamine.\"\"Gave him?\"\"Yes. He took it, but not for himself. He tried it out on someone else.\"\"What did you do?\"\"On the third day we had decided, if all else failed, to break down the door, maybe injuring hisself-esteem, but at least curing him.\"\"Ah…\"\"Yes.\"\"So, in that locker….\"\"Yes, my friend, quite. But in the meantime, we too had received visitors. We had our handsfull, and didn\u0027t have a chance to tell him what was going on. Now it\u0027s…it\u0027s become a routine.\"He spoke so softly that I guessed rather than heard the last few words. \n \n \"I still don\u0027t understand!\" I exclaimed. \"If you listened at his door, you must have heard twovoices.\"\"No, we heard only his voice. There were strange noises, but we thought they came from himtoo.\"\"Only his voice! But how is it that you didn\u0027t hear…her?\"\"I don\u0027t know. I have the rudiments of a theory about it, but I\u0027ve dropped it for the moment. Nopoint getting bogged down in details. But what about you? You must already have seensomething yesterday, otherwise you would have taken us for lunatics.\"\"I thought it was I who had gone mad.\"\"So you didn\u0027t see anyone?\"\"I saw someone.\"\"Who?\"I gave him a long look—he no longer wore even the semblance of a smile—and answered: \n \n \"That…that black woman…\" He was leaning forward, and as I spoke his body almostimperceptibly relaxed. \"You might have warned me.\"\"I did warn you.\"\"You could have chosen a better way!\"\"It was the only way possible. I didn\u0027t know what you would see. No one could know, no oneever knows…\"\"Listen, Snow, I want to ask you something. You\u0027ve had some experience of this…phenomenon. Will she…will the person who visited me today…?\"\"Will she come back, do you mean?\"I nodded. \n \n \"Yes and no,\" he said. \n \n \"What does that mean?\"\"She…this person will come back as though nothing had happened, just as she was at thebeginning of her first visit. More precisely, she will appear not to realize what you did to getrid of her. If you abide by the rules, she won\u0027t be aggressive.\"\"What rules?\"\"That depends on the circumstances.\"\"Snow!\"\"What?\"\"Don\u0027t let\u0027s waste time talking in riddles.\"\"In riddles? Kelvin, I\u0027m afraid you still don\u0027t understand.\" His eyes glittered. \"All right, then!\"he went on, brutally. \"Can you tell me who your visitor was?\"I swallowed my saliva and turned away. I did not want to look at him. I would have preferredto be dealing with anyone else but him; but I had no choice. A piece of gauze came unstuckand fell on my hand. I gave a start. \n \n \"A woman who…\" I stopped. \"She died. An injection…\"\"Suicide?\"\"Yes.\"\"Is that all?\"He waited. Seeing that I remained silent, he murmured: \n \n \"No, it\u0027s not all…\"I looked up quickly; he was not looking at me. \n \n \"How did you guess?\" He said nothing. \"It\u0027s true, there\u0027s more to it than that.\" I moistened mylips. \"We quarrelled. Or rather, I lost my temper and said a lot of things I didn\u0027t mean. I packedmy bags and cleared out. She had given me to understand…not in so many words—when one\u0027slived together for years it\u0027s not necessary. I was certain she didn\u0027t mean it, that she wouldn\u0027tdare, she\u0027d be too afraid, and I told her so. Next day, I remembered I\u0027d left these…theseampoules in a drawer. She knew they were there. I\u0027d brought them back from the laboratorybecause I needed them, and I had explained to her that the effect of a heavy dose would belethal. I was a bit worried. I wanted to go back and get them, but I thought that would give theimpression that I\u0027d taken her remarks seriously. By the third day I was really worried and madeup my mind to go back. When I arrived, she was dead.\"\"You poor innocent!\"I looked up with a start. But Snow was not making fun of me. It seemed to me that I was seeinghim now for the first time. His face was grey, and the deep lines between cheek and nose wereevidence of an unutterable exhaustion: he looked a sick man. \n \n Curiously awed, I asked him: \n \n \"Why did you say that?\"\"Because it\u0027s a tragic story.\" Seeing that I was upset, he added, hastily: \"No, no, you still don\u0027tunderstand. Of course it\u0027s a terrible burden to carry around, and you must feel like a murderer,but…there are worse things.\"\"Oh, really?\"\"Yes, really. And I\u0027m almost glad that you refuse to believe me. Certain events, which haveactually happened, are horrible, but what is more horrible still is what hasn\u0027t happened, whathas never existed.\"\"What are you saying?\" I asked, my voice faltering. \n \n He shook his head from side to side. \n \n \"A normal man,\" he said. \"What is a normal man? A man who has never committed adisgraceful act? Maybe, but has he never had uncontrollable thoughts? Perhaps he hasn\u0027t. Butperhaps something, a phantasm, rose up from somewhere within him, ten or thirty years ago,something which he suppressed and then forgot about, which he doesn\u0027t fear since he knows hewill never allow it to develop and so lead to any action on his part. And now, suddenly, inbroad daylight, he comes across this thing…this thought, embodied, riveted to him,indestructible. He wonders where he is…Do you know where he is?\"\"Where?\"\"Here,\" whispered Snow, \"on Solaris.\"\"But what does it mean? After all, you and Sartorius aren\u0027t criminals….\"\"And you call yourself a psychologist, Kelvin! Who hasn\u0027t had, at some moment in his life, acrazy daydream, an obsession? Imagine…imagine a fetishist who becomes infatuated with,let\u0027s say, a grubby piece of cloth, and who threatens and entreats and defies every risk in orderto acquire this beloved bit of rag. A peculiar idea, isn\u0027t it? A man who at one and the same timeis ashamed of the object of his desire and cherishes it above everything else, a man who isready to sacrifice his life for his love, since the feeling he has for it is perhaps as overwhelmingas Romeo\u0027s feeling for Juliet. Such cases exist, as you know. So, in the same way, there arethings, situations, that no one has dared to externalize, but which the mind has produced byaccident in a moment of aberration, of madness, call it what you will. At the next stage, theidea becomes flesh and blood. That\u0027s all.\"Stupefied, my mouth dry, I repeated: \n \n \"That\u0027s all?\" My head was spinning. \"And what about the Station? What has it got to do withthe Station?\"\"It\u0027s almost as if you\u0027re purposely refusing to understand,\" he groaned. \"I\u0027ve been talking aboutSolaris the whole time, solely about Solaris. If the truth is hard to swallow, it\u0027s not my fault. \n \n Anyhow, after what you\u0027ve already been through, you ought to be able to hear me out! We takeoff into the cosmos, ready for anything: for solitude, for hardship, for exhaustion, death. \n \n Modesty forbids us to say so, but there are times when we think pretty well of ourselves. Andyet, if we examine it more closely, our enthusiasm turns out to be all sham. We don\u0027t want toconquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of thecosmos. For us, such and such a planet is as arid as the Sahara, another as frozen as the NorthPole, yet another as lush as the Amazon basin. We are humanitarian and chivalrous; we don\u0027twant to enslave other races, we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over theirheritage in exchange. We think of ourselves as the Knights of the Holy Contact. This is anotherlie. We are only seeking Man. We have no need of other worlds. We need mirrors. We don\u0027tknow what to do with other worlds. A single world, our own, suffices us; but we can\u0027t accept itfor what it is. We are searching for an ideal image of our own world: we go in quest of aplanet, of a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of ourprimeval past. At the same time, there is something inside us which we don\u0027t like to face up to,from which we try to protect ourselves, but which nevertheless remains, since we don\u0027t leaveEarth in a state of primal innocence. We arrive here as we are in reality, and when the page isturned and that reality is revealed to us—that part of our reality which we would prefer to passover in silence—then we don\u0027t like it any more.\"I had listened to him patiently. \n \n \"But what on earth are you talking about?\"\"I\u0027m talking about what we all wanted: contact with another civilization. Now we\u0027ve got it! \n \n And we can observe, through a microscope, as it were, our own monstrous ugliness, our folly,our shame!\" His voice shook with rage. \n \n \"So…you think it\u0027s…the ocean? That the ocean is responsible for it all? But why? I\u0027m notasking how, I\u0027m simply asking why? Do you seriously think that it wants to toy with us, orpunish us—a sort of elementary demonomania? A planet dominated by a huge devil, whosatisfies the demands of his satanic humors by sending succubi to haunt the members of ascientific expedition…? Snow, you can\u0027t believe anything so absurd!\"He muttered under his breath. \n \n \"This devil isn\u0027t such a fool as all that…\"I looked at him in amazement. Perhaps what had happened, assuming that we had experiencedit in our right minds, had finally driven him over the edge? A reaction psychosis? \n \n He was laughing to himself. \n \n \"Making your diagnosis? Don\u0027t be in too much of a hurry! You\u0027ve only been through oneordeal—and that a reasonably mild one.\"\"Oh, so the devil had pity on me!\"I was beginning to weary of this conversation. \n \n \"What is it you want exactly?\" Snow went on. \"Do you want me to tell you what this mass ofmetamorphic plasma—x-billion tons of metamorphic plasma—is scheming against us? Perhapsnothing.\"\"What do you mean, nothing?\"Snow smiled. \n \n \"You must know that science is concerned with phenomena rather than causes. The phenomenahere began to manifest themselves eight or nine days after that X-ray experiment. Perhaps theocean reacted to the irradiation with a counter-irradiation, perhaps it probed our brains andpenetrated to some kind of psychic tumor.\"I pricked up my ears. \n \n \"Tumor?\"\"Yes, isolated psychic processes, enclosed, stifled, encysted—foci smouldering under the ashesof memory. It deciphered them and made use of them, in the same way as one uses a recipe ora blue-print. You know how alike the asymmetric crystalline structures of a chromosome are tothose of the DNA molecule, one of the constituents of the cerebrosides which constitute thesubstratum of the memory-processes? This genetic substance is a plasma which \u0027remembers.\u0027 \n \n The ocean has \u0027read\u0027 us by this means, registering the minutest details, with the result that…well, you know the result. But for what purpose? Bah! At any rate, not for the purpose ofdestroying us. It could have annihilated us much more easily. As far as one can tell, given itstechnological resources, it could have done anything it wished—confronted me with yourdouble, and you with mine, for example.\"\"So that\u0027s why you were so alarmed when I arrived, the first evening!\"\"Yes. In fact, how do you know it hasn\u0027t done so? How do you know I\u0027m really the same oldRatface who landed here two years ago?\"He went on laughing silently, enjoying my discomfiture, then he growled: \n \n \"No, no, that\u0027s enough of that! We\u0027re two happy mortals; I could kill you, you could kill me.\"\"And the others, can\u0027t they be killed?\"\"I don\u0027t advise you to try—a horrible sight!\"\"Is there no means of killing them?\"\"I don\u0027t know. Certainly not with poison, or a weapon, or by injection…\"\"What about a gamma pistol?\"\"Would you risk it?\"\"Since we know they\u0027re not human…\"\"In a certain subjective sense, they are human. They know nothing whatsoever about theirorigins. You must have noticed that?\"\"Yes. But then, how do you explain…?\"\"They…the whole thing is regenerated with extraordinary rapidity, at an incredible speed—inthe twinkling of an eye. Then they start behaving again as…\"\"As?\"\"As we remember them, as they are engraved on our memories, following which…\"\"Did Gibarian know?\" I interrupted. \n \n \"As much as we do, you mean?\"\"Yes.\"\"Very probably.\"\"Did he say anything to you?\"\"No. I found a book in his room…\"I leapt to my feet. \n \n \"The Little Apocrypha!\"\"Yes.\" He looked at me suspiciously. \"Who could have told you about that?\"I shook my head. \n \n \"Don\u0027t worry, you can see that I\u0027ve burnt my skin and that it\u0027s not exactly renewing itself. No,Gibarian left a letter addressed to me in his cabin.\"\"A letter? What did it say?\"\"Nothing much. It was more of a note than a letter, with bibliographic references—allusions tothe supplement to the Annual and to the Apocrypha. What is this Apocrypha?\"\"An antique which seems to have some relevance to our situation. Here!\" He drew from hispocket a small, leatherbound volume, scuffed at the edges, and handed it to me. \n \n I grabbed the little book. \n \n \"And what about Sartorius?\"\"Him! Everyone has his own way of coping. Sartorius is trying to remain normal—that is, topreserve his respectability as an envoy of an official mission.\"\"You\u0027re joking!\"\"No, I\u0027m quite serious. We were together on another occasion. I won\u0027t bother you with thedetails, but there were eight of us and we were down to our last 1000 pounds of oxygen. Oneafter another, we gave up our chores, and by the end we all had beards except Sartorius. Hewas the only one who shaved and polished his shoes. He\u0027s like that. Now, of course, he canonly pretend, act a part—or else commit a crime.\"\"A crime?\"\"Perhaps that isn\u0027t quite the right word. \u0027Divorce by ejection!\u0027 Does that sound better?\"\"Very funny!\"\"Suggest something else if you don\u0027t like it.\"\"Oh, leave me alone!\"\"No, let\u0027s discuss the thing seriously. You know pretty well as much as I do by now. Have yougot a plan?\"\"No, none. I haven\u0027t the least idea what I\u0027ll do when…when she comes back. She will return, ifI\u0027ve understood you correctly?\"\"It\u0027s on the cards.\"\"How do they get in? The Station is hermetically sealed. Perhaps the layer on the outer hull…\"He shook his head. \n \n \"The outer hull is in perfect condition. I don\u0027t know where they get in. Usually, they\u0027re therewhen you wake up, and you have to sleep eventually!\"\"Could you barricade yourself securely inside a cabin?\"\"The barricades wouldn\u0027t survive for long. There\u0027s only one solution, and you can guess whatthat is…\"We both stood up. \n \n \"Just a minute, Snow! You\u0027re suggesting we liquidate the Station and you expect me to take theinitiative and accept the responsibility?\"\"It\u0027s not as simple as that. Obviously, we could get out, if only as far as the satellite, and sendan SOS from there. Of course, we\u0027ll be regarded as lunatics; we\u0027ll be shut up in a mad-house onEarth—unless we have the sense to retract. A distant planet, isolation, collective derangement—our case won\u0027t seem at all out of the ordinary. But at least we\u0027d be better off in a mentalhome than we are here: a quiet garden, little white cells, nurses, supervised walks…\"Hands in his pockets, staring fixedly at a corner of the room, he spoke with the utmostseriousness. \n \n The red sun had disappeared over the horizon and the ocean was a sombre desert, mottled withdying gleams, the last rays lingering among the long tresses of the waves. The sky was ablaze. \n \n Purple-edged clouds drifted across this dismal red and black world. \n \n \"Well, do you want to get out, yes or no? Or not yet?\"\"Always the fighter! If you knew the full implications of what you\u0027re asking, you wouldn\u0027t beso insistent. It\u0027s not a matter of what I want, it\u0027s a matter of what\u0027s possible.\"\"Such as what?\"\"That\u0027s the point, I don\u0027t know.\"\"We stay here then? Do you think we\u0027ll find some way…?\"Thin, sickly-looking, his peeling face deeply lined, he turned towards me: \n \n \"It might be worth our while to stay. We\u0027re unlikely to learn anything about it, but aboutourselves…\"He turned, picked up his papers, and went out. I opened my mouth to detain him, but no soundescaped my lips. \n \n There was nothing I could do now except wait. I went to the window and ran my eyes absentlyover the dark-red glimmer of the shadowed ocean. For a moment, I thought of locking myselfinside one of the capsules on the hangar-deck, but it was not an idea worth considering forlong: sooner or later, I should have to come out again. \n \n I sat by the window, and began to leaf through the book Snow had given me. The glowingtwilight lit up the room and colored the pages. It was a collection of articles and treatises editedby an Otho Ravintzer, Ph.D., and its general level was immediately obvious. Every scienceengenders some pseudo-science, inspiring eccentrics to explore freakish by-ways; astronomyhas its parodists in astrology, chemistry used to have them in alchemy. It was not surprising,therefore, that Solaristics, in its early days, had set off an explosion of marginal cogitations. \n \n Ravintzer\u0027s book was full of this sort of intellectual speculation, prefaced, it is only fair to add,by an introduction in which the editor dissociated himself from some of the texts reproduced. \n \n He considered, with some justice, that such a collection could provide an invaluable perioddocument as much for the historian as for the psychologist of science. \n \n Berton\u0027s report, divided into two parts and complete with a summary of his log, occupied theplace of honor in the book. \n \n From 14.00 hours to 16.40 hours, by expedition time, the entries in the log were laconic andnegative. \n \n Altitude 3000—or 3500—2500 feet; nothing visible; ocean empty. The same words recurredover and over again. \n \n Then, at 16.40 hours: A red mist rising. Visibility 700 yards. Ocean empty. \n \n 17.00 hours: fog thickening; visibility 400 yards, with clear patches. Descending to 600 feet. \n \n 17.20 hours: in fog. Altitude 600. Visibility 20-40 yards. Climbing to 1200. \n \n 17.45: altitude 1500. Pall of fog to horizon. Funnel-shaped openings through which I can seeocean surface. Attempting to enter one of these clearings; something is moving. \n \n 17.52: have spotted what appears to be a waterspout; it is throwing up a yellow foam. \n \n Surrounded by a wall of fog. Altitude 300. Descending to 60 feet. \n \n The extract from Berton\u0027s log stopped at this point. There followed his case-history, or, moreprecisely, the statement dictated by Berton and interrupted at intervals by questions from themembers of the Commission of Enquiry. \n \n BERTON: When I reached 100 feet it became very difficult to maintain altitude because of theviolent gusts of wind inside the cone. I had to hang on to the controls and for a short period—about ten or fifteen minutes—I did not look outside. I realized too late that a powerfulundertow was dragging me back into the fog. It wasn\u0027t like an ordinary fog, it was a thickcolloidal substance which coated my windows. I had a lot of trouble cleaning them; that fog—or glue rather—was obstinate stuff. Due to this resistance, the speed of my rotor-blades wasreduced by thirty percent and I began losing height. I was afraid of capsizing on the waves; but,even at full power, I could maintain altitude but not increase it. I still had four booster-rocketsleft but felt the situation was not yet desperate enough to use them. The aircraft was shaken byshuddering vibrations that grew more and more violent. Thinking my rotor-blades must havebecome coated with the gluey substance, I glanced at the overload indicator, but to my surpriseit read zero. Since entering the fog, I had not seen the sun—only a red glow. I continued to flyaround in the hope of emerging into one of the funnels, which, after half an hour, was whathappened. I found myself in a new \u0027well,\u0027 perfectly cylindrical in shape, and several hundredyards in diameter. The walls of the cylinder were formed by an enormous whirlpool of fog,spiralling upwards. I struggled to keep in the middle, where the wind was less violent. It wasthen that I noticed a change in the ocean\u0027s surface. The waves had almost completelydisappeared, and the upper layer of the fluid—or whatever the ocean is made of—wasbecoming transparent, with murky streaks here and there which gradually dissolved until,finally, it was perfectly clear. I could see distinctly to a depth of several yards. I saw a sort ofyellow sludge which was sprouting vertical filaments. When these filaments emerged abovethe surface, they had a glassy sheen. Then they began to exuam—they frothed—until the foamsolidified; it was like a very thick treacle. These glutinous filaments merged and becameintertwined; great bubbles swelled up on the surface and slowly began to change shape. \n \n Suddenly I realized that my machine was being driven towards the wall of fog. I had tomanoeuver against the wind, and when I was able to look down again, I saw something whichlooked like a garden. Yes, a garden. Trees, hedges, paths—but it wasn\u0027t a real garden; it was allmade of the same substance, which had hardened and by now looked like yellow plaster. \n \n Beneath this garden, the ocean glittered. I came down as low as I dared in order to take a closerlook. \n \n QUESTION: Did the trees and plants you saw have leaves on them? \n \n BERTON: No, the shapes were only approximate, like a model garden. That\u0027s exactly what itwas like: a model, but lifesize. All of a sudden, it began to crack; it broke up and split into darkcrevices; a thick white liquid ran out and collected into pools, or else drained away. The\u0027earthquake\u0027 became more violent, the whole thing boiled over and was buried beneath thefoam. At the same time, the walls of the fog began to close in. I gained height rapidly and cameclear at 1000 feet. \n \n QUESTION: Are you absolutely sure that what you saw resembled a garden—there was noother possible interpretation? \n \n BERTON: Yes. I noticed several details. For example, I remember seeing a place where therewere some boxes in a row. I realized later that they were probably beehives. \n \n QUESTION: You realized later? But not at the time, not at the moment when you actually sawthem? \n \n BERTON: No, because everything looked as though it were made of plaster. But I sawsomething else. \n \n QUESTION: What was that? \n \n BERTON: I saw things which I can\u0027t put a name to, because I didn\u0027t have time to examine themcarefully. Under some bushes I thought I saw tools, long objects with prongs. They might havebeen plaster models of garden tools. But I\u0027m not absolutely certain. Whereas I\u0027m sure, quitecertain, that I recognized an apiary. \n \n QUESTION: It didn\u0027t occur to you that it might be an hallucination? \n \n BERTON: No. I thought it was a mirage. It never occurred to me that it was an hallucinationbecause I felt perfectly well, and I had never seen anything like it before. When I reached 1000feet and took another look at the fog, it was pitted with more irregularly shaped holes, ratherlike a piece of cheese. Some of these holes were completely hollow, and I could see the oceanwaves; others were only shallow saucers in which something was bubbling. I descendedanother well and saw—the altimeter read 120 feet—I saw a wall lying beneath the oceansurface. It wasn\u0027t very deep and I could see it clearly beneath the waves. It seemed to be thewall of a huge building, pierced with rectangular openings, like windows. I even thought Icould see something moving behind them, but I couldn\u0027t be absolutely certain of that. The wallslowly broke the surface and a mucous bubbling liquid streamed down its sides. Then itsuddenly broke in half and disappeared into the depths. \n \n I regained height and continued to fly above the fog, the machine almost touching it, until Idiscovered another clearing, much larger than the previous one. \n \n While I was still some distance away, I noticed a pale, almost white, object floating on thesurface. My first thought was that it was Fechner\u0027s flying-suit, especially as it looked vaguelyhuman in form. I brought the aircraft round sharply, afraid of losing my way and being unableto find the same spot again. The shape, the body, was moving; sometimes it seemed to bestanding upright in the trough of the waves. I accelerated and went down so low that themachine bounced gently. I must have hit the crest of a huge wave I was overflying. The body—yes, it was a human body, not an atmosphere-suit—the body was moving. \n \n QUESTION: Did you see its face? \n \n BERTON: Yes. \n \n QUESTION: Who was it? \n \n BERTON: A child. \n \n QUESTION: What child? Did you recognize it? \n \n BERTON: No. At any rate, I don\u0027t remember having seen it before. Besides, when I got closer—when I was forty yards away, or even sooner—I realized that it was no ordinary child. \n \n QUESTION: What do you mean? \n \n BERTON: I\u0027ll explain. At first, I couldn\u0027t understand what worried me about it; it was onlyafter a minute or two that I realized: this child was extraordinarily large. Enormous, in fact. \n \n Stretched out horizontally, its body rose twelve feet above the surface of the ocean, I swear. Iremembered that when I touched the wave, its face was a little higher than mine, even thoughmy cockpit must have been at least ten feet above the ocean. \n \n QUESTION: If it was as big as that, what makes you say it was a child? \n \n BERTON: Because it was a tiny child. \n \n QUESTION: Do you realize, Berton, that your answer doesn\u0027t make sense? \n \n BERTON: On the contrary. I could see its face, and it was a very young child. Besides, itsproportions corresponded exactly to the proportions of a child\u0027s body. It was a…babe in arms. \n \n No, I exaggerate. It was probably two or three years old. It had black hair and blue eyes—enormous blue eyes! It was naked—completely naked—like a newborn baby. It was wet, or Ishould say glossy; its skin was shiny. I was shattered. I no longer thought it was a mirage. Icould see this child so distinctly. It rose and fell with the waves; but apart from this generalmotion, it was making other movements, and they were horrible! \n \n QUESTION: Why? What was it doing? \n \n BERTON: It was more like a doll in a museum, only a living doll. It opened and closed itsmouth, it made various gestures, horrible gestures. \n \n QUESTION: What do you mean? \n \n BERTON: I was watching it from about twenty yards away—I don\u0027t suppose I went any closer. \n \n But, as I\u0027ve already told you, it was enormous. I could see very clearly. Its eyes sparkled andyou really would have thought it was a living child, if it hadn\u0027t been for the movements, thegestures, as though someone was trying…It was as though someone else was responsible forthe gestures…QUESTION: Try to be more explicit. \n \n BERTON: It\u0027s difficult. I\u0027m talking of an impression, more of an intuition. I didn\u0027t analyze it,but I knew that those gestures weren\u0027t natural. \n \n QUESTION: Do you mean, for example, that the hands didn\u0027t move as human hands wouldmove, because the joints were not sufficiently supple? \n \n BERTON: No, not at all. But…these movements had no meaning. Each of our movementsmeans something, more or less, serves some purpose…QUESTION: Do you think so? The movements of an infant don\u0027t have much meaning! \n \n BERTON: I know. But an infant\u0027s movements are confused, random, uncoordinated. Themovements I saw were…er…yes, that\u0027s it, they were methodical movements. They wereperformed one after another, like a series of exercises; as though someone had wanted to makea study of what this child was capable of doing with its hands, its torso, its mouth. The facewas more horrifying than the rest, because the human face has an expression, and this face…Idon\u0027t know how to describe it. It was alive, yes, but it wasn\u0027t human. Or rather, the features as awhole, the eyes, the complexion, were, but the expression, the movements of the face, werecertainly not. \n \n QUESTION: Were they grimaces? Do you know what happens to a person\u0027s face during anepileptic fit? \n \n BERTON: Yes. I\u0027ve watched an epileptic fit. I know what you mean. No, it was somethingquite different. Epilepsy provokes spasms, convulsions. The movements I\u0027m talking about werefluid, continuous, graceful…melodious, if one can say that of a movement. It\u0027s the nearestdefinition I can think of. But this face…a face can\u0027t divide itself into two—one half gay, theother sad, one half scowling and the other amiable, one half frightened and the othertriumphant. But that\u0027s how it was with this child\u0027s face. In addition to that, all these movementsand changes of expression succeeded one another with unbelievable rapidity. I stayed downthere a very short time, perhaps ten seconds, perhaps less. \n \n QUESTION: And you claim to have seen all that in such a short time? Besides, how do youknow how long you were there? Did you check your chronometer? \n \n BERTON: No, but I\u0027ve been flying for seventeen years and, in my job, one can measureinstinctively, to the nearest second, the duration of what would be called an instant of time. It\u0027san acquired faculty, and essential for successful navigation. A pilot isn\u0027t worth his salt if hecan\u0027t tell whether a particular phenomenon lasts five or ten seconds, whatever thecircumstances. It\u0027s the same with observation. We learn, over the years, to take in everything ata glance. \n \n QUESTION: Is that all you saw? \n \n BERTON: No, but I don\u0027t remember the rest so precisely. I suppose I must already have seenmore than enough; my attention faltered. The fog began to close in, and I had to climb. Iclimbed, and for the first time in my life I all but capsized. My hands were shaking so muchthat I had difficulty in handling the controls. I think I shouted something, called up the base,even though I knew we were not in radio contact. \n \n QUESTION: Did you then try and get back? \n \n BERTON: No. In the end, having gained height, I thought to myself that Fechner was probablyin the bottom of one of the wells. I know it sounds crazy, but that\u0027s what I thought. I toldmyself that everything was possible, and that it would also be possible for me to find Fechner. Idecided to investigate every clearing I came across along my route. At the third attempt I gaveup. When I had regained height, I knew it was useless to persist after what I had just seen onthis, the third, occasion. I couldn\u0027t go on any longer. I should add, as you already know, that Iwas suffering from bouts of nausea and that I vomited in the cockpit. I couldn\u0027t understand it; Ihave never been sick in my life. \n \n COMMENT: It was a symptom of poisoning. \n \n BERTON: Perhaps. I don\u0027t know. But what I saw on this third occasion I did not imagine. Thatwas not the effect of poisoning. \n \n QUESTION: How can you possibly know? \n \n BERTON: It wasn\u0027t an hallucination. An hallucination is created by one\u0027s own brain, wouldn\u0027tyou say? \n \n COMMENT: Yes. \n \n BERTON: Well, my brain couldn\u0027t have created what I saw. I\u0027ll never believe that. My brainwouldn\u0027t have been capable of it. \n \n COMMENT: Get on with describing what it was! \n \n BERTON: Before I do so, I should like to know how the statements I\u0027ve already made will beinterpreted. \n \n QUESTION: What does that matter? \n \n BERTON: For me, it matters very much indeed. I have said that I saw things which I shallnever forget. If the Commission recognizes, even with certain reservations, that my testimonyis credible, and that a study of the ocean must be undertaken—I mean a study orientated in thelight of my statements—then I\u0027ll tell everything. But if the Commission considers that it is alldelusions, then I refuse to say anything more. \n \n QUESTION: Why? \n \n BERTON: Because the contents of my hallucinations belong to me and I don\u0027t have to give anaccount of them, whereas I am obliged to give an account of what I saw on Solaris. \n \n QUESTION: Does that mean that you refuse to answer any more questions until the expeditionauthorities have announced their findings? You realize, of course, that the Commission isn\u0027tempowered to take an immediate decision? \n \n BERTON: Yes. \n \n The first minute ended here. There followed a fragment of the second minute drawn up elevendays later. \n \n PRESIDENT:…after due consideration, the Commission, composed of three doctors, threebiologists, a physicist, a mechanical engineer and the deputy head of the expedition, hasreached the conclusion that Berton\u0027s report is symptomatic of hallucinations caused byatmospheric poisoning, consequent upon inflammation of the associative zone of the cerebralcortex, and that Berton\u0027s account bears no, or at any rate no appreciable, relation to reality. \n \n BERTON: Excuse me, what does \"no appreciable relation\" mean? In what proportion is realityappreciable or not? \n \n PRESIDENT: I haven\u0027t finished. Independently of these conclusions, the Commission has dulyregistered a dissenting vote from Dr. Archibald Messenger, who considers the phenomenadescribed by Berton to be objectively possible and declares himself in favor of a scrupulousinvestigation. \n \n BERTON: I repeat my question. \n \n PRESIDENT: The answer is simple. \"No appreciable relation to reality\" means thatphenomena actually observed may have formed the basis of your hallucinations. In the courseof a nocturnal stroll, a perfectly sane man can imagine he sees a living creature in a bush stirredby the wind. Such illusions are all the more likely to affect an explorer lost on a strange planetand breathing a poisonous atmosphere. This verdict is in no way prejudicial to you, Berton. \n \n Will you now be good enough to let us know your decision? \n \n BERTON: First of all, I should like to know the possible consequences of this dissenting voteof Dr. Messenger\u0027s. \n \n PRESIDENT: Virtually none. We shall carry on our work along the lines originally laid down. \n \n BERTON: Is our interview on record? \n \n PRESIDENT: Yes. \n \n BERTON: In that case, I should like to say that although the Commission\u0027s decision may notbe prejudicial to me personally, it is prejudicial to the spirit of the expedition itself. \n \n Consequently, as I have already stated, I refuse to answer any further questions. \n \n PRESIDENT: Is that all? \n \n BERTON: Yes. Except that I should like to meet Dr. Messenger. Is that possible? \n \n PRESIDENT: Of course. \n \n That was the end of the second minute. At the bottom of the page there was a note inminuscule handwriting to the effect that, the following day, Dr. Messenger had talked toBerton for nearly three hours. As a result of this conversation, Messenger had once morebegged the expedition Council to undertake further investigations in order to check the pilot\u0027sstatements. Berton had produced some new and extremely convincing revelations, whichMessenger could not divulge unless the Council reversed its negative decision. The Council—Shannahan, Timolis and Trahier—rejected the motion and the affair was closed. \n \n The book also reproduced a photocopy of the last page of a letter, or rather, the draft of a letter,found by Messenger\u0027s executors after his death. Ravintzer, in spite of his researches, had beenunable to discover if this letter had ever been sent. \n \n \"…obtuse minds, a pyramid of stupidity,\"—the text began. \"Anxious to preserve its authority,the Council—more precisely Shannahan and Timolis (Trahier\u0027s vote doesn\u0027t count)—hasrejected my recommendations. Now I am taking the matter up directly with the Institute; but,as you can well imagine, my protestations won\u0027t convince anybody. Bound as I am by oath, Ican\u0027t, alas, reveal to you what Berton told me. If the Council disregarded Berton\u0027s testimony, itwas basically because Berton has no scientific training, although any scientist would envy thepresence of mind and the gift of observation shown by this pilot. I should be grateful if youcould send me the following information by return post: \n \n i) Fechner\u0027s biography, in particular details about his childhood. \n \n ii) Everything you know about his family, facts and dates—he probably lost his parents whilestill a child. \n \n iii)The topography of the place where he was brought up. \n \n I should like once more to tell you what I think about all this. As you know, some time afterthe departure of Fechner and Carucci, a spot appeared in the centre of the red sun. Thischromospheric eruption caused a magnetic storm chiefly over the southern hemisphere, whereour base was situated, according to the information provided by the satellite, and the radio linkswere cut. The other parties were scouring the planet\u0027s surface over a relatively restricted area,whereas Fechner and Carucci had travelled a considerable distance from the base. \n \n Never, since our arrival on the planet, had we observed such a persistent fog or such anunremitting silence. \n \n I imagine that what Berton saw was one of the phases of a kind of \u0027Operation Man\u0027 which thisviscous monster was engaged in. The source of all the various forms observed by Berton isFechner—or rather, Fechner\u0027s brain, subjected to an unimaginable \u0027psychic dissection\u0027 for thepurposes of a sort of re-creation, an experimental reconstruction, based on impressions(undoubtedly the most durable ones) engraved on his memory. \n \n I know this sounds fantastic; I know that I may be mistaken. But do please help me. At themoment, I am on the Alaric, where I look forward to receiving your reply. \n \n Yours, A.\"It was growing dark, and I could scarcely make out the blurred print at the top of the grey page—the last page describing Berton\u0027s adventure. For my part, my own experience led me toregard Berton as a trustworthy witness. \n \n I turned towards the window. A few clouds still glowed like dying embers above the horizon. \n \n The ocean was invisible, blanketed by the purple darkness. \n \n The strips of paper fluttered idly beneath the air-vents. There was a whiff of ozone in the still,warm air. \n \n There was nothing heroic in our decision to remain on the Station. The time for heroism wasover, vanished with the era of the great interplanetary triumphs, of daring expeditions andsacrifices. Fechner, the ocean\u0027s first victim, belonged to a distant past. I had almost stoppedcaring about the identity of Snow\u0027s and Sartorius\u0027s visitors. Soon, I told myself, we would ceaseto be ashamed, to keep ourselves apart. If we could not get rid of our visitors, we wouldaccustom ourselves to their presence, learn to live with them. If their Creator altered the rulesof the game, we would adapt ourselves to the new rules, even if at first we jibbed or rebelled,even if one of us despaired and killed himself. Eventually, a certain equilibrium would bereestablished. \n \n Night had come; no different from many nights on Earth. Now I could make out only the whitecontours of the basin and the smooth surface of the mirror. \n \n I stood up. Groping my way to the basin, I fumbled among the objects which cluttered up theshelf, and found the packet of cotton wool. I washed my face with a damp wad and stretchedout on the bedA moth fluttered its wings…no, it was the ventilator-strip. The whirring stopped, then startedup again. I could no longer see the window; everything had merged into darkness. Amysterious ray of light pierced the blackness and lingered in front of me—against the wall, orthe black sky? I remembered how the blank stare of the night had frightened me the day before,and I smiled at the thought. I was no longer afraid of the night; I was not afraid of anything. Iraised my wrist and looked at the ring of phosphorescent figures; another hour, and the blueday would dawn. \n \n I breathed deeply, savoring the darkness, my mind empty and at rest. \n \n Shifting my position, I felt the flat shape of the tape-recorder against my hip: Gibarian, hisvoice immortalized on the spools of tape. I had forgotten to resurrect him, to listen to him—theonly thing I could do for him any more. I took the tape-recorder out of my pocket in order tohide it under the bed. \n \n I heard a rustling sound; the door opened. \n \n \"Kris?\" An anxious voice whispered my name. \"Kris, are you there? It\u0027s so dark….\"I answered: \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027m here. Don\u0027t be frightened, come!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996/29992.html","bookId":222,"book":{"id":222,"title":"Solaris 星球梭那里斯/索拉利斯星","description":"简介： 在太空站驻守的科学家小组突然切断了和地球的所有联系，心理学家基思博士奉命到太空站调查原因。但当基思到达后，却发现要求他前来的组长吉巴已神秘自杀，而另外两位科学家的情绪则极度不稳定，并经常出现妄想症状，这一切，都似乎与神秘的索拉罗斯星球有关。与此同时，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
