{"id":6866,"no":5,"title":"5 RHEYA","content":"　　Desperation and a sort of dumb rage had sustained me while working with the computer. Now,overcome with exhaustion, I could not even remember how to let down a mechanical bed. Forgetting to push back the clamps, I hung on to the handle with all my weight and themattress tumbled down on top of me. I tore off my clothes and flung them away from me, then collapsed on to the pillow, withouteven taking the trouble to inflate it properly. I fell asleep with the lights on. I reopened my eyes with the impression of having dozed off for only a few minutes. The roomwas bathed in a dim red light. It was cooler, and I felt refreshed. I lay there, the bedclothes pushed back, completely naked. The curtains were half drawn, andthere, opposite me, beside the window-pane lit by the red sun, someone was sitting. It wasRheya. She was wearing a white beach dress, the material stretched tightly over her breasts. She sat with her legs crossed; her feet were bare. Motionless, leaning on her sun-tanned arms,she gazed at me from beneath her black lashes: Rheya, with her dark hair brushed back. For along time, I lay there peacefully gazing back at her. My first thought was reassuring: I wasdreaming and I was aware that I was dreaming. Nevertheless, I would have preferred her not tobe there. I closed my eyes and tried to shake off the dream. When I opened them again, Rheyawas still sitting opposite me. Her lips were pouting slightly—a habit of hers—as though she were about to whistle; but herexpression was serious. I thought of my recent speculations on the subject of dreams. She had not changed since the day I had seen her for the last time; she was then a girl ofnineteen. Today, she would be twenty-nine. But, evidently, the dead do not change; theyremain eternally young. She went on gazing at me, an expression of surprise on her face. Ithought of throwing something at her, but, even in a dream, I could not bring myself to harm adead person. I murmured: \"Poor little thing, have you come to visit me?\"The sound of my voice frightened me; the room, Rheya, everything seemed extraordinarilyreal. A three-dimensional dream, colored in half-tones…. I saw several objects on the floorwhich I had not noticed when I went to bed. When I wake up, I told myself, I shall checkwhether these things are still there or whether, like Rheya, I only saw them in a dream. \"Do you mean to stay for long?\" I asked. I realized that I was speaking very softly, likesomeone afraid of being overheard. Why worry about eavesdroppers in a dream? The sun was rising over the horizon. A good sign. I had gone to bed during a red day, whichshould have been succeeded by a blue day, followed by another red day. I had not slept forfifteen hours at a stretch. So it was a dream! Reassured, I looked closely at Rheya. She was silhouetted against the sun. The scarlet rays casta glow over the smooth skin of her left cheek and the shadows of her eyelashes fell across herface. How pretty she was! Even in my sleep my memory of her was uncannily precise. Iwatched the movements of the sun, waiting to see the dimple appear in that unusual placeslightly below the corner of the lips. All the same, I would have preferred to wake up. It wastime I did some work. I closed my eyelids tightly. I heard a metallic noise, and opened my eyes again. Rheya was sitting beside me on the bed,still looking at me gravely. I smiled at her. She smiled back at me and leant forward. Wekissed. First a timid, childish kiss, then more prolonged ones. I held her for a long time. Was itpossible to feel so much in a dream, I wondered. I was not betraying her memory, for it was ofher that I was dreaming, only her. It had never happened to me before…. Was it then that I began to have doubts? I went on telling myself that it was a dream, but myheart tightened. I tensed my muscles, ready to leap out of bed. I was half-expecting to fail, for often, in dreams,your sluggish body refuses to respond. I hoped that the effort would drag me out of sleep. But Idid not wake; I sat on the edge of the bed, my legs dangling. There was nothing for it, I shouldhave to endure this dream right to the bitter end. My feeling of well-being had vanished. I wasafraid. \"What…\" I asked. I cleared my throat. \"What do you want?\"I felt around the floor with my bare feet, searching for a pair of slippers. I stubbed my toeagainst a sharp edge, and stifled a cry of pain. That\u0027ll wake me up, I thought with satisfaction,at the same time remembering that I had no slippers. But still it went on. Rheya had drawn back and was leaning against the end of the bed. Herdress rose and fell lightly with her breathing. She watched me with quiet interest. Quick, I thought, a shower! But then I realized that in a dream a shower would not interrupt mysleep. \"Where have you come from?\"She seized my hand and, with a gesture I knew well, threw it up and caught it again, thenplayed with my fingers. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she replied. \"Are you angry?\"It was her voice, that familiar, low-pitched, slightly faraway voice, and that air of not caringmuch about what she was saying, of already being preoccupied with something else. Peopleused to think her off-hand, even rude, because the expression on her face rarely changed fromone of vague astonishment. \"Did…did anyone see you?\"\"I don\u0027t know. I got here without any trouble. Why, Kris, is it important?\"She was still playing with my fingers, but her face now wore a slight frown. \"Rheya.\"\"What, my darling?\"\"How did you know where I was?\"She pondered. A broad smile revealed her teeth. \"I haven\u0027t the faintest idea. Isn\u0027t it funny? When I came in you were asleep. I didn\u0027t wake youup because you get cross so easily. You have a very bad temper.\"She squeezed my hand. \"Did you go down below?\"\"Yes. It was all frozen. I ran away.\"She let go of my hand and lay back. With her hair falling to one side, she looked at me with thehalf-smile that had irritated me before it had captivated me. \"But, Rheya…\" I stammered. I leaned over her and turned back the short sleeve of her dress. There, just above hervaccination scar, was a red dot, the mark of a hypodermic needle. I was not really surprised,but my heart gave a lurch. I touched the red spot with my finger. For years now I had dreamt of it, over and over again,always waking with a shudder to find myself in the same position, doubled up between thecrumpled sheets—just as I had found her, already growing cold. It was as though, in my sleep,I tried to relive what she had gone through; as though I hoped to turn back the clock and askher forgiveness, or keep her company during those final minutes when she was feeling theeffects of the injection and was overcome by terror. She, who dreaded the least scratch, whohated pain or the sight of blood, had deliberately done this horrible thing, leaving nothing but afew scribbled words addressed to me. I had kept her note in my wallet. By now it was soiledand creased, but I had never had the heart to throw it away. Time and time again I had imagined her tracing those words and making her final preparations. I persuaded myself that she had only been play-acting, that she had wanted to frighten me andhad taken an overdose by mistake. Everyone told me that it must have happened like that, orelse it had been a spontaneous decision, the result of a sudden depression. But people knewnothing of what I had said to her five days earlier; they did not know that, in order to twist theknife more cruelly, I had taken away my belongings and that she, as I was closing mysuitcases, had said, very calmly: \"I suppose you know what this means?\" And I had pretendednot to understand, even though I knew quite well what she meant; I thought her too much of acoward, and had even told her as much…. And now she was lying across the bed, looking atme attentively, as though she did not know that it was I who had killed her. \"Well?\" she asked. Her eyes reflected the red sun. The entire room was red. Rheya looked ather arm with interest, because I had been examining it for so long, and when I drew back shelaid her smooth, cool cheek in the palm of my hand. \"Rheya,\" I stammered, \"it\u0027s not possible…\"\"Hush!\"I could sense the movement of her eyes beneath their closed lids. \"Where are we, Rheya?\"\"At home.\"\"Where\u0027s that?\"One eye opened and shut again instantly. The long lashes tickled my palm. \"Kris.\"\"What?\"\"I\u0027m happy.\"Raising my head, I could see part of the bed in the washbasin mirror: a cascade of soft hair—Rheya\u0027s hair—and my bare knees. I pulled towards me with my foot one of the misshapenobjects I had found in the box and picked it up with my free hand. It was a spindle, one end ofwhich had melted to a needle-point. I held the point to my skin and dug it in, just beside asmall pink scar. The pain shot through my whole body. I watched the blood run down theinside of my thigh and drip noiselessly on to the floor. What was the use? Terrifying thoughts assailed me, thoughts which were taking a definiteshape. I no longer told myself: \"It\u0027s a dream.\" I had ceased to believe that. Now I was thinking: \"I must be ready to defend myself.\"I examined her shoulders, her hip under the close-fitting white dress, and her dangling nakedfeet. Leaning forward, I took hold of one of her ankles and ran my fingers over the sole of herfoot. The skin was soft, like that of a newborn child. I knew then that it was not Rheya, and I was almost certain that she herself did not know it. The bare foot wriggled and Rheya\u0027s lips parted in silent laughter. \"Stop it,\" she murmured. Cautiously I withdrew my hand from under the cheek and stood up. Then I dressed quickly. She sat up and watched me. \"Where are your things?\" I asked her. Immediately, I regretted my question. \"My things?\"\"Don\u0027t you have anything except that dress?\"From now on, I would pursue the game with my eyes open. I tried to appear unconcerned,indifferent, as though we had parted only yesterday, as though we had never parted. She stood up. With a familiar gesture, she tugged at her skirt to smooth out the creases. Mywords had worried her, but she said nothing. For the first time, she examined the room with anenquiring, scrutinizing gaze. Then, puzzled, she replied: \"I don\u0027t know.\" She opened the locker door. \"In here, perhaps?\"\"No, there\u0027s nothing but work-suits in there.\"I found an electric point by the basin and began to shave, careful not to take my eyes off her. She went to and fro, rummaging everywhere. Eventually, she came up to me and said: \"Kris, I have the feeling that something\u0027s happened…\"She broke off. I unplugged the razor, and waited. \"I have the feeling that I\u0027ve forgottensomething,\" she went on, \"that I\u0027ve forgotten a lot of things. I can only remember you. I…Ican\u0027t remember anything else.\"I listened to her, forcing myself to look unconcerned. \"Have I…Have I been ill?\" she asked. \"Yes…in a way. Yes, you\u0027ve been slightly ill.\"\"There you are then. That explains my lapses of memory.\"She had brightened up again. Never shall I be able to describe how I felt then. As I watched hermoving about the room, now smiling, now serious, talkative one moment, silent the next,sitting down and then getting up again, my terror was gradually overcome by the convictionthat it was the real Rheya there in the room with me, even though my reason told me that sheseemed somehow stylized, reduced to certain characteristic expressions, gestures andmovements. Suddenly, she clung to me. \"What\u0027s happening to us, Kris?\" She pressed her fists against my chest. \"Is everything all right? Is there something wrong?\"\"Things couldn\u0027t be better.\"She smiled wanly. \"When you answer me like that, it means things could hardly be worse.\"\"What nonsense!\" I said hurriedly. \"Rheya, my darling, I must leave you. Wait here for me.\"And, because I was becoming extremely hungry, I added: \"Would you like something to eat?\"\"To eat?\" She shook her head. \"No. Will I have to wait long for you?\"\"Only an hour.\"\"I\u0027m coming with you.\"\"You can\u0027t come with me. I\u0027ve got work to do.\"\"I\u0027m coming with you.\"She had changed. This was not Rheya at all; the real Rheya never imposed herself, wouldnever have forced her presence on me. \"It\u0027s impossible, my sweet.\"She looked me up and down. Then suddenly she seized my hand. And my hand lingered,moved up her warm, rounded arm. In spite of myself I was caressing her. My body recognizedher body; my body desired her, my body was attracted towards hers beyond reason, beyondthought, beyond fear. Desperately trying to remain calm, I repeated: \"Rheya, it\u0027s out of the question. You must stay here.\"A single word echoed round the room: \"No.\"\"Why?\"\"I…I don\u0027t know.\" She looked around her, then, once more, raised her eyes to mine. \"I can\u0027t,\"she whispered. \"But why?\"\"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t. It\u0027s as though…as though…\"She searched for the answer which, as she uttered it, seemed to come to her like a revelation. \"It\u0027s as though I mustn\u0027t let you out of my sight.\"The resolute tone of her voice scarcely suggested an avowal of affection; it implied somethingquite different. With this realization, the manner in which I was embracing Rheya underwentan abrupt, though not immediately noticeable, change. I was holding her in my arms and gazing into her eyes. Imperceptibly, almost instinctively, I began to pull her hands together behind her back at thesame time searching the room with my eyes: I needed something with which to tie her hands. Suddenly she jerked her elbows together, and there followed a powerful recoil. I resisted forbarely a second. Thrown backwards and almost lifted off my feet, even had I been an athlete Icould not have freed myself. Rheya straightened up and dropped her arms to her sides. Herface, lit by an uncertain smile, had played no part in the struggle. She was gazing at me with the same calm interest as when I had first awakened—as though shewas utterly unmoved by my desperate ploy, as though she was quite unaware that anything hadhappened, and had not noticed my sudden panic. She stood before me, waiting—grave,passive, mildly surprised. Leaving Rheya in the middle of the room, I went over to the washbasin. I was a prisoner,caught in an absurd trap from which at all costs I was determined to escape. I would have beenincapable of putting into words the meaning of what had happened or what was going throughmy mind; but now I realized that my situation was identical with that of the other inhabitants ofthe Station, that everything I had experienced, discovered or guessed at was part of a singlewhole, terrifying and incomprehensible. Meanwhile, I was racking my brain to think up someruse, to work out some means of escape. Without turning round, I could feel Rheya\u0027s eyesfollowing me. There was a medicine chest above the basin. Quickly I went through itscontents, and found a bottle of sleeping pills. I shook out four tablets—the maximum dose—into a glass, and filled it with hot water. I made little effort to conceal my actions from Rheya. Why? I did not even bother to ask myself. When the tablets had dissolved, I returned to Rheya, who was still standing in the same place. \"Are you angry with me?\" she asked, in a low voice. \"No. Drink this.\"Unconsciously, I had known all along that she would obey me. She took the glass without aword and drank the scalding mixture in one gulp. Putting down the empty glass on a stool, Iwent and sat in a chair in the corner of the room. Rheya joined me, squatting on the floor in her accustomed manner with her legs folded underher, and tossing back her hair. I was no longer under any illusion: this was not Rheya—and yetI recognized her every habitual gesture. Horror gripped me by the throat; and what was mosthorrible was that I must go on tricking her, pretending to take her for Rheya, while she herselfsincerely believed that she was Rheya—of that I was certain, if one could be certain ofanything any longer. She was leaning against my knees, her hair brushing my hand. We remained thus for somewhile. From time to time, I glanced at my watch. Half-an-hour went by; the sleeping tabletsshould have started to work. Rheya murmured something: \"What did you say?\"There was no reply. Although I attributed her silence to the onset of sleep, secretly I doubted the effectiveness ofthe pills. Once again, I did not ask myself why. Perhaps it was because my subterfuge seemedtoo simple. Slowly her head slid across my knees, her dark hair falling over her face. Her breathing grewdeeper and more regular; she was asleep. I stooped in order to lift her on to the bed. As I didso, her eyes opened; she put her arms round my neck and burst into shrill laughter. I was dumbfounded. Rheya could hardly contain her mirth. With an expression that was atonce ingenuous and sly, she observed me through half-closed eyelids. I sat down again, tense,stupefied, at a loss. With a final burst of laughter, she snuggled against my legs. In an expressionless voice, I asked: \"Why are your laughing?\"Once again, a look of anxiety and surprise came over her face. It was clear that she wanted togive me an honest explanation. She sighed, and rubbed her nose like a child. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said at last, with genuine puzzlement. \"I\u0027m behaving like an idiot, aren\u0027t I? But so are you…you look idiotic, all stiff and pompous like…like Pelvis.\"I could hardly believe my ears. \"Like who?\"\"Like Pelvis. You know who I mean, that fat man….\"Rheya could not possibly have known Pelvis, or even heard me mention him, for the simplereason that he had returned from an expedition three years after her death. I had not known himpreviously and was therefore unaware of his inveterate habit, when presiding over meetings atthe Institute, of letting sessions drag on indefinitely. Moreover, his name was Pelle Villis anduntil his return I did not know that he had been nicknamed Pelvis. Rheya leaned her elbows on my knees and looked me in the eyes. I put out my hand andstroked her arms, her shoulders and the base of her bare neck, which pulsed beneath myfingers. While it looked as though I was caressing her (and indeed, judging by her expression,that was how she interpreted the touch of my hands) in reality I was verifying once again thather body was warm to the touch, an ordinary human body, with muscles, bones, joints. Gazingcalmly into her eyes, I felt a hideous desire to tighten my grip. Suddenly I remembered Snow\u0027s bloodstained hands, and let go. \"How you stare at me,\" Rheya said, placidly. My heart was beating so furiously that I was incapable of speech. I closed my eyes. In that veryinstant, complete in every detail, a plan of action sprang to my mind. There was not a second tolose. I stood up. \"I must go out, Rheya. If you absolutely insist on coming with me, I\u0027ll take you.\"\"Good.\"She jumped to her feet. I opened the locker and selected a suit for each of us. Then I asked: \"Why are you bare-foot?\"She answered hesitantly: \"I don\u0027t know…I must have left my shoes somewhere.\"I did not pursue the matter. \"You\u0027ll have to take your dress off to put this on.\"\"Flying-overalls? What for?\"As she tried to take off her dress, an extraordinary fact became apparent: there were no zips, orfastenings of any sort; the red buttons down the front were merely decorative. Rheya smiled,embarrassed. As though it were the most normal way of going about it, I picked up some kind of scalpelfrom the floor and slit the dress down the back from neck to waist, so that she could pull it overher head. When she had put on the flying-overalls (which were slightly too large for her) and we wereabout to leave, she asked: \"Are we going on a flight?\"I merely nodded. I was afraid of running into Snow. But the dome was empty and the doorleading to the radio-cabin was shut. A deathly silence still hung over the hangar-deck. Rheya followed my movements attentively. Iopened a stall and examined the shuttle vehicle inside. I checked, one after another, the micro-reactor, the controls, and the diffusers. Then, having removed the empty capsule from its stand,I aimed the electric trolley towards the sloping runway. I had chosen a small shuttle used for ferrying stores between the Station and the satellite, onethat did not normally carry personnel since it did not open from the inside. The choice wascarefully calculated in accordance with my plan. Of course, I had no intention of launching it,but I simulated the preparations for an actual departure. Rheya, who had so often accompaniedme on my space-flights, was familiar with the preliminary routine. Inside the cockpit, Ichecked that the climatization and oxygen-supply systems were functioning. I switched in themain circuit and the indicators on the instrument panel lit up. I climbed out and said to Rheya,who was waiting at the foot of the ladder: \"Get in.\"\"What about you?\"\"I\u0027ll follow you. I have to close the hatch behind us.\"She gave no sign that she suspected any trickery. When she had disappeared inside, I stuck myhead into the opening and asked: \"Are you comfortable?\"I heard a muffled \"yes\" from inside the confined cockpit. I withdrew my head and slammed thehatch to with all my strength. I slid home the two bolts and tightened the five safety screwswith the special spanner I had brought with me. The slender metal cigar stood there, pointingupwards, as though it were really about to take off into space. Its captive was in no danger: the oxygen-tanks were full and there were food supplies in thecockpit. In any case, I did not intend to keep her prisoner indefinitely. I desperately needed twohours of freedom in order to concentrate on the decisions which had to be taken and to workout a joint plan of action with Snow. As I was tightening the last screw but one, I felt a vibration in the three-pronged clamp whichheld the base of the shuttle. I thought I must have loosened the support in my over-eagerhandling of the heavy spanner, but when I stepped back to take a look, I was greeted by aspectacle which I hope I shall never have to see again. The whole vehicle trembled, shaken from the inside as though by some superhuman force. Noteven a steel robot could have imparted such a convulsive tremor to an 8-ton mass, and yet thecabin contained only a frail, dark-haired girl. The reflections from the lights quivered on the shuttle\u0027s gleaming sides. I could not hear theblows; there was no sound whatever from inside the vehicle. But the outspread struts vibratedlike taut wires. The violence of the shock-waves was such that I was afraid the entirescaffolding would collapse. I tightened the final screw with a trembling hand, threw down the spanner and jumped off theladder. As I slowly retreated, I noticed that the shock-absorbers, designed to resist a continuouspressure, were vibrating furiously. It looked to me as though the shuttle\u0027s outer skin waswrinkling. Frenziedly, I rushed to the control panel and with both hands lifted the starting lever. As I didso the intercom connected to the shuttle\u0027s interior gave out a piercing sound—not a cry, but asound which bore not the slightest resemblance to the human voice, in which I couldnevertheless just make out my name, repeated over and over again: \"Kris! Kris! Kris!\"I had attacked the controls so violently, fumbling in my haste, that my fingers were torn andbleeding. A bluish glimmer, like that of a ghostly dawn, lit up the walls. Swirling clouds of vaporousdust eddied round the launching pad; the dust turned into a column of fierce sparks and theechoes of a thunderous roar drowned all other noise. Three flames, merging instantly into asingle pillar of fire, lifted the craft, which rose up through the open hatch in the dome, leavingbehind a glowing trail which rippled as it gradually subsided. Shutters slid over the hatch, andthe automatic ventilators began to suck in the acrid smoke which billowed round the room. It was only later that I remembered all these details; at the time, I hardly knew what I wasseeing. Clinging to the control-panel, the fierce heat burning my face and singeing my hair, Igulped the acrid air which smelt of a mixture of burning fuel and the ozone given off byionization. I had instinctively closed my eyes at the moment of lift-off, but the glare hadpenetrated my eyelids. For some time, I saw nothing but black, red and gold spirals whichslowly died away. The ventilators continued to hum; the smoke and the dust were graduallyclearing. The green glow of the radar-screen caught my eye. My hands flew across its controls as Ibegan to search for the shuttle. By the time I had located it, it was already flying above theatmosphere. I had never launched a vehicle in such a blind and unthinking way, with no pre-setspeed or direction. I did not even know its range and was afraid of causing some unpredictabledisaster. I judged that the easiest thing to do would be to place it in a stationary orbit aroundSolaris and then cut the engines. I verified from the tables that the required altitude was 725miles. It was no guarantee, of course, but I could see no other way out. I did not have the heart to switch on the intercom, which had been disconnected at lift-off. Icould not bear to expose myself again to the sound of that horrifying voice, which was nolonger even remotely human. I felt I was justified in thinking that I had defeated the \u0027simulacra,\u0027 and that behind the illusion,contrary to all expectation, I had found the real Rheya again—the Rheya of my memories,whom the hypothesis of madness would have destroyed. At one o\u0027clock, I left the hangar-deck.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996/29991.html","bookId":222,"book":{"id":222,"title":"Solaris 星球梭那里斯/索拉利斯星","description":"简介： 在太空站驻守的科学家小组突然切断了和地球的所有联系，心理学家基思博士奉命到太空站调查原因。但当基思到达后，却发现要求他前来的组长吉巴已神秘自杀，而另外两位科学家的情绪则极度不稳定，并经常出现妄想症状，这一切，都似乎与神秘的索拉罗斯星球有关。与此同时，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
