{"id":6874,"no":13,"title":"13 VICTORY","content":"Another three weeks. The shutters rose and fell on time. I was still a prisoner in mynightmares, and every morning the play began again. But was it a play? I put on a feignedcomposure, and Rheya played the same game. The deception was mutual and deliberate, andour agreement only contributed to our ultimate evasion. We talked about the future, and ourlife on Earth on the outskirts of some great city. We would spend the rest of our lives amonggreen trees and under a blue sky, and never leave Earth again. Together we planned the lay-outof our house and garden and argued over details like the location of a hedge or a bench. \n \n I do not believe that I was sincere for a single instant. Our plans were impossible, and I knewit, for even if Rheya could leave the Station and survive the voyage, how could I have gotthrough the immigration checks with my clandestine passenger? Earth admits only humanbeings, and even then only when they carry the necessary papers. Rheya would be detained foran identity check at the first barrier, we would be separated, and she would give herself away atonce. The Station was the one place where we could live together. Rheya must have knownthat, or found it out. \n \n One night I heard Rheya get out of bed silently. I wanted to stop her; in the darkness andsilence we occasionally managed to throw off our despair for a while by making each otherforget. Rheya did not notice that I had woken up. When I stretched my hand out, she wasalready out of bed, and walking bare-foot towards the door. Without daring to raise my voice, Iwhispered her name, but she was outside, and a narrow shaft of light shone through thedoorway from the corridor. \n \n There was a sound of whispering. Rheya was talking to somebody…but whom? Panicovertook me when I tried to stand up, and my legs would not move. I listened, but heardnothing. The blood hammered through my temples. I started counting, and was approaching athousand when there was a movement in the doorway and Rheya returned. She stood there fora second without moving, and I made myself breathe evenly. \n \n \"Kris?\" she whispered. \n \n I did not answer. \n \n She slid quickly into bed and lay down, taking care not to disturb me. Questions buzzed in mymind, but I would not let myself be the first to speak, and made no move. The silentquestioning went on for an hour, maybe more. Then I fell asleep. \n \n The morning was like any other. I watched Rheya furtively, but could not see any change inher behavior. After breakfast, we sat at the big panoramic window. The Station was hoveringamong purple clouds. Rheya was reading, and as I stared out I suddenly noticed that by holdingmy head at a certain angle I could see us both reflected in the window. I took my hand off therail. Rheya had no idea that I was watching her. She glanced at me, obviously decided from myposture that I was looking at the ocean, then bent to kiss the place where my hand had rested. \n \n In a moment she was reading her book again. \n \n \"Rheya,\" I asked gently, \"where did you go last night?\"\"Last night?\"\"Yes.\"\"You…you must have been dreaming, Kris. I didn\u0027t go anywhere.\"\"You didn\u0027t leave the cabin?\"\"No. It must have been a dream.\"\"Perhaps…yes, perhaps I dreamt it.\"The same evening, I started talking about our return to Earth again, but Rheya stopped me: \n \n \"Don\u0027t talk to me about the journey again, Kris. I don\u0027t want to hear any more about it, youknow very well…\"\"What?\"\"No, nothing.\"After we went to bed, she said that she was thirsty: \n \n \"There\u0027s a glass of fruit-juice on the table over there. Could you give it to me?\" She drank halfof it then handed it to me. \n \n \"I\u0027m not thirsty.\"\"Drink to my health then,\" she smiled. \n \n It tasted slightly bitter, but my mind was on other things. She switched the light off. \n \n \"Rheya…If you won\u0027t talk about the voyage, let\u0027s talk about something else.\"\"If I did not exist, would you marry?\"\"No.\"\"Never?\"\"Never.\"\"Why not?\"\"I don\u0027t know. I was by myself for ten years and I didn\u0027t marry again. Let\u0027s not talk aboutthat…\" My head was spinning as if I had been drinking too much. \n \n \"No, let\u0027s talk about it. What if I begged you to?\"\"To marry again? Don\u0027t be silly, Rheya. I don\u0027t need anybody except you.\"I felt her breath on my face and her arms holding me: \n \n \"Say it another way.\"\"I love you.\"Her head fell to my shoulder, and I felt tears. \n \n \"Rheya, what\u0027s the matter?\"\"Nothing…nothing…nothing…\" Her voice echoed into silence, and my eyes closed. \n \n The red dawn woke me with a splitting head and a neck so stiff that I felt as if the bones werewelded together. My tongue was swollen, and my mouth felt foul. Then I reached out forRheya, and my hand touched a cold sheet. \n \n I sat up with a start. \n \n I was alone—alone in bed and in the cabin. The concave window reflected a row of red suns. Idragged myself out of bed and staggered over to the bathroom, reeling like a drunkard andpropping myself up on the furniture. It was empty. So was the workshop. \n \n \"Rheya!\"Calling, running up and down the corridor. \n \n \"Rheya!\" I screamed, one last time, then my voice gave out. I already knew the truth…I do not remember the exact sequence of events after that, as I stumbled half naked through allthe length and breadth of the Station. It seems to me that I even went into the refrigerationsection, searched through the storage rooms, hammered with my fists on bolted doors, thencame back again to throw myself against doors which had already resisted me. I half-fell downflights of steps, picked myself up and hurried onwards. When I reached the double armoureddoors which opened onto the ocean I was still calling, still hoping that it was a dream. \n \n Somebody was standing by me. Hands took hold of me and pulled me away. \n \n I came to my senses again lying on a metal table in the little workshop and gasping for breath. \n \n My throat and nostrils were burning with some alcoholic vapor, my shirt was soaked in water,and my hair plastered over my skull. \n \n Snow was busy at a medicine cupboard, shifting instruments and glass vessels which clatteredwith an unbearable din. Then his face appeared, looking gravely down into my eyes. \n \n \"Where is she?\"\"She is not here.\"\"But…Rheya…\"He bent over me, brought his face closer, and spoke very slowly and clearly: \n \n \"Rheya is dead.\"\"She will come back,\" I whispered. \n \n Instead of dreading her return, I wanted it. I did not attempt to remind myself why I myself hadonce tried to drive her away, and why I had been so afraid of her return. \n \n \"Drink this.\"Snow held out a glass, and I threw it in his face. He staggered back, rubbing his eyes, and bythe time he opened them again I was on my feet and standing over him. How small he was…\"It was you.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Come on Snow, you know what I mean. It was you who met her the other night. You told herto give me a sleeping pill…What has happened to her? Tell me!\"He felt in his shirt-pocket and took out an envelope. I snatched it out of his hand. It was sealed,and there was no inscription. Inside was a sheet of paper folded twice, and I recognized thesprawling, rather childish handwriting: \n \n \"My darling, I was the one who asked him. He is a good man. I am sorry I had to lie to you. Ibeg you to give me this one wish—hear him out, and do nothing to harm yourself. You havebeen marvellous.\"There was one more word, which she had crossed out, but I could see that she had signed\"Rheya.\"My mind was now absolutely clear. Even if I had wanted to scream hysterically, my voice hadgone, and I did not even have the strength to groan. \n \n \"How…?\"\"Later, Kelvin. You\u0027ve got to calm down.\"\"I\u0027m calm now. Tell me how.\"\"Disintegration.\"\"But…what did you use?\"\"The Roche apparatus was unsuitable. Sartorius built something else, a new destabilizer. Aminiature instrument, with a range of a few yards.\"\"And she…\"\"She disappeared. A pop, and a puff of air. That\u0027s all.\"\"A short-range instrument…\"\"Yes, we didn\u0027t have the resources for anything bigger.\"The walls loomed over me, and I shut my eyes. \n \n \"She will come back.\"\"No.\"\"What do you know about it?\"\"You remember the wings of foam? Since that day, they do not come back.\"\"You killed her,\" I whispered. \n \n \"Yes…In my place, what else would you have done?\"I turned away from him and began pacing up and down the room. Nine steps to the corner. \n \n About turn. Nine more rapid steps, and I was facing Snow again. \n \n \"Listen, we\u0027ll write a report. We\u0027ll ask for an immediate link with the Council. It\u0027s feasible, andthey\u0027ll accept—they must. The planet will no longer be subject to the four-power convention. \n \n We\u0027ll be authorized to use any means at our disposal. We can send for anti-matter generators. \n \n Nothing can stand up against them, nothing…\" I was shouting now, and blinded with tears. \n \n \"You want to destroy it? Why?\"\"Get out, leave me alone!\"\"No, I won\u0027t get out.\"\"Snow!\" I glared at him, and he shook his head. \"What do you want? What am I supposed todo?\" He walked back to the table. \n \n \"Fine, we\u0027ll draw up a report.\"I started pacing again. \n \n \"Sit down!\"\"I\u0027ll do what I like!\"\"There are two distinct questions. One, the facts. Two, our recommendations.\"\"Do we have to talk about it now?\"\"Yes, now.\"\"I won\u0027t listen, you hear? I\u0027m not interested in your distinctions.\"\"We sent our last message about two months ago, before Gibarian\u0027s death. We\u0027ll have toestablish exactly how the \u0027visitor\u0027 phenomena function…\"I grabbed his arm: \n \n \"Will you shut up!\"\"Hit me if you like, but I will not shut up.\"\"Oh, talk away, if it gives you pleasure…\" I let him go. \n \n \"Good, listen. Sartorius will want to conceal certain facts. I\u0027m almost certain of it.\"\"And what about you? Won\u0027t you conceal anything?\"\"No. Not now. This business goes further than individual responsibilities. You know that aswell as I do. \u0027It\u0027 has given a demonstration of considered activity. It is capable of carrying outorganic synthesis on the most complex level, a synthesis we ourselves have never managed toachieve. It knows the structure, micro-structure and metabolism of our bodies…\"\"All right…But why stop there? It has performed a series of…experiments on us. Psychicvivisection. It has used knowledge which it stole from our minds without our consent.\"\"Those are not facts, Kelvin. They are not even propositions. They are theories. You could saythat it has taken account of desires locked into secret recesses of our brains. Perhaps it wassending us…presents.\"\"Presents! My God!\" I shook with a fit of uncontrollable laughter. \n \n \"Take it easy!\" Snow took hold of my hand, and I tightened my grip until I heard bonescracking. He went on looking at me without any change of expression. I let go, and walkedover to a corner of the workshop: \n \n \"I\u0027ll try to get hold of myself.\"\"Yes, of course. I understand. What do we ask them?\"\"I leave it to you…I can\u0027t think straight right now. Did she say anything—before?\"\"No, nothing. If you want my opinion, from now on we stand a chance.\"\"A chance? What chance?\" I stared at him, and light suddenly dawned. \"Contact? StillContact? Haven\u0027t you had enough of this madhouse? What more do you need? No, it\u0027s out ofthe question. Count me out!\"\"Why not,\" he asked quietly. \"You yourself instinctively treat it like a human being, now morethan ever. You hate it.\"\"And you don\u0027t?\"\"No, Kelvin. It is blind.\"—I thought that I might not have heard him correctly—\"…or rather it\u0027sees\u0027 in a different way from ourselves. We do not exist for it in the same sense that we existfor each other. We recognize one another by the appearance of the face and the body. Thatappearance is a transparent window to the ocean. It introduces itself directly into the brain.\"\"Right, what if it does? What are you driving at? It succeeded in recreating a human being whoexists only in my memory, and so accurately that her eyes, her gestures, her voice…\"\"Don\u0027t stop. Talk.\"\"I\u0027m talking…Her voice…because it is able to read us like a book. You see what I mean?\"\"Yes, that it could make itself understood.\"\"Doesn\u0027t that follow?\"\"No, not necessarily. Perhaps it used a formula which is not expressed in verbal terms. It maybe taken from a recording imprinted on our minds, but a man\u0027s memory is stored in terms ofnucleic acids etching asynchronous large-moleculed crystals. \u0027It\u0027 removed the deepest, mostisolated imprint, the most \u0027assimilated\u0027 structure, without necessarily knowing what it meant tous. Suppose, I\u0027m capable of reproducing the architecture of a symmetriad, and I know itscomposition and have the requisite technology…I create a symmetriad and I drop it into theocean. But I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m doing so, I don\u0027t know its function, and I don\u0027t know what thesymmetriad means to the ocean…\"\"Yes. You may be right. In that case it wished us no harm, and it was not trying to destroy us. \n \n Yes, it\u0027s possible…and with no intention…\"My mouth began to tremble. \n \n \"Kelvin!\"\"All right, don\u0027t get worried. You are kind, the ocean is kind. Everybody is kind. But why? \n \n Explain that. Why has it done this? What did you say…to her?\"\"The truth.\"\"I asked you what you said.\"\"You know very well. Come back to my cabin and we\u0027ll write out the report. Come on.\"\"Wait. What exactly do you want? You can\u0027t be intending to remain on the Station.\"\"Yes, I want to stay.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996/29999.html","bookId":222,"book":{"id":222,"title":"Solaris 星球梭那里斯/索拉利斯星","description":"简介： 在太空站驻守的科学家小组突然切断了和地球的所有联系，心理学家基思博士奉命到太空站调查原因。但当基思到达后，却发现要求他前来的组长吉巴已神秘自杀，而另外两位科学家的情绪则极度不稳定，并经常出现妄想症状，这一切，都似乎与神秘的索拉罗斯星球有关。与此同时，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
