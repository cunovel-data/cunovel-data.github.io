{"id":6862,"no":1,"title":"1 THE ARRIVAL","content":"　　At 19.00 hours, ship\u0027s time, I made my way to the launching bay. The men around the shaftstood aside to let me pass, and I climbed down into the capsule. \n \n Inside the narrow cockpit, there was scarcely room to move. I attached the hose to the valve onmy spacesuit and it inflated rapidly. From then on, I was incapable of making the smallestmovement. There I stood, or rather hung suspended, enveloped in my pneumatic suit and yoketo the metal hull. \n \n I looked up; through the transparent canopy I could see a smooth, polished wall and, far above,Moddard\u0027s head leaning over the top of the shaft. He vanished, and suddenly I was plunged indarkness: the heavy protective cone had been lowered into place. Eight times I heard the humof the electric motors which turned the screws, followed by the hiss of the shock-absorbers. Asmy eyes grew accustomed to the dark, I could see the luminous circle of the solitary dial. \n \n A voice echoed in my headphones: \n \n \"Ready Kelvin?\"\"Ready, Moddard,\" I answered. \n \n \"Don\u0027t worry about a thing. The Station will pick you up in flight. Have a good trip!\"There was a grinding noise and the capsule swayed. My muscles tensed in spite of myself, butthere was no further noise or movement. \n \n \"When is lift-off?\" As I asked, I noticed a rustling outside, like a shower of fine sand. \n \n \"You\u0027re on your way, Kelvin. Good luck!\" Moddard\u0027s voice sounded as close as before. \n \n A wide slit opened at eye-level, and I could see the stars. The Prometheus was orbiting in theregion of Alpha in Aquarius and I tried in vain to orient myself; a glittering dust filled myporthole. I could not recognize a single constellation; in this region of the galaxy the sky wasunfamiliar to me. I waited for the moment when I would pass near the first distinct star, but Iwas unable to isolate any one of them. Their brightness was fading; they receded, merging intoa vague, purplish glimmer, the sole indication of the distance I had already travelled. My bodyrigid, sealed in its pneumatic envelope, I was knifing through space with the impression ofstanding still in the void, my only distraction the steadily mounting heat. \n \n Suddenly, there was a shrill, grating sound, like a steel blade being drawn across a sheet of wetglass. This was it, the descent. If I had not seen the figures racing across the dial, I would nothave noticed the change in direction. The stars having vanished long since, my gaze wasswallowed up on the pale reddish glow of infinity. I could hear my heart thudding heavily. Icould feel the coolness from the air-conditioning on my neck, although my face seemed to beon fire. I regretted not having caught a glimpse of the Prometheus, but the ship must have beenout of sight by the time the automatic controls had raised the shutter of my porthole. \n \n The capsule was shaken by a sudden jolt, then another. The whole vehicle began to vibrate. \n \n Filtered through the insulating layers of the outer skins, penetrating my pneumatic cocoon, thevibration reached me, and ran through my entire body. The image of the dial shivered andmultiplied, and its phosphorescence spread out in all directions. I felt no fear. I had notundertaken this long voyage only to overshoot my target! \n \n I called into the microphone: \n \n \"Station Solaris! Station Solaris! Station Solaris! I think I am leaving the flight-path, correctmy course! Station Solaris, this is the Prometheus capsule. Over.\"I had missed the precious moment when the planet first came into view. Now it was spread outbefore my eyes; flat, and already immense. Nevertheless, from the appearance of its surface, Ijudged that I was still at a great height above it, since I had passed that imperceptible frontierafter which we measure the distance that separates us from a celestial body in terms of altitude. \n \n I was falling. Now I had the sensation of falling, even with my eyes closed. (I quickly reopenedthem: I did not want to miss anything there was to be seen.)I waited a moment in silence before trying once more to make contact. No response. \n \n Successive bursts of static came through the headphones, against a background of deep, low-pitched murmuring, which seemed to me the very voice of the planet itself. A veil of mistcovered the orange-colored sky, obscuring the porthole. Instinctively, I hunched myself up asmuch as my inflated suit would allow, but almost at once I realized that I was passing throughcloud. Then, as though sucked upwards, the cloud-mass lifted; I was gliding, half in light, halfin shadow, the capsule revolving upon its own vertical axis. At last, through the porthole, thegigantic ball of the sun appeared, looming up on the left and disappearing to the right. \n \n A distant voice reached me through the murmuring and crackling. \n \n \"Station Solaris calling! Station Solaris calling! The capsule will land at zero-hour. I repeat, thecapsule will land at zero-hour. Stand by for count-down. Two hundred and fifty, two hundredand forty-nine, two hundred and forty-eight…\"The words were punctuated by sharp screeching sounds; automatic equipment was intoning thephrases of the reception-drill. This was surprising, to say the least. As a rule, men on spacestations were eager to greet a newcomer, especially if he was arriving direct from Earth. I didnot have long to ponder this, for the sun\u0027s orbit, which had so far encircled me, shiftedunexpectedly, and the incandescent disc appeared now to the right, now to the left, seeming todance on the planet\u0027s horizon. I was swinging like a giant pendulum while the planet, itssurface wrinkled with purplish-blue and black furrows, rose up in front of me like a wall. Asmy head began to spin, I caught sight of a tiny pattern of green and white dots; it was thestation\u0027s positioning-marker. Something detached itself with a snap from the cone of thecapsule; with a fierce jerk, the long parachute collar released its hoops, and the noise whichfollowed reminded me irresistibly of Earth: for the first time after so many months, themoaning of the wind. \n \n Everything went quickly after this. So far, I had known that I must be falling; now I could seeit for myself. The green and white checker-board grew rapidly larger and I could see that it waspainted on an elongated silvery body, shaped like a whale, its flanks bristling with radarantennae. This metal colossus, which was pierced with several rows of shadowy apertures, wasnot resting on the planet itself but suspended above it, casting upon the inky surface beneath anellipsoidal shadow of even deeper blackness. I could make out the slate-colored ripples of theocean, stirring with a faint motion. Suddenly, the clouds rose to a great height, rimmed with ablinding crimson glare; the lurid sky became grey, distant and flat; everything was blotted out;I was falling in a spin. \n \n A sharp jolt, and the capsule righted itself. Through the porthole, I could see the ocean oncemore, the waves like crests of glittering quicksilver. The hoops of the parachute, their cordssnapped, flapped furiously over the waves, carried on the wind. The capsule gently descended,swaying with a peculiar slow-motion rhythm imposed on it by the artificial magnetic field;there was just time to glimpse the launchingpads and the parabolic reflectors of two radio-telescopes on top of their pierced-steel towers. \n \n With the clang of steel rebounding against steel, the capsule came to a stop. A hatch opened,and with a long, harsh sigh, the metal shell which imprisoned me reached the end of its voyage. \n \n I heard the mechanical voice from the control center: \n \n \"Station Solaris. Zero and zero. The capsule has landed. Out.\"Feeling a vague pressure on my chest and a disagreeable heaviness in the pit of my stomach, Iseized the control levers with both hands and cut the contacts. A green indicator lit up: \n \n \u0027ARRIVAL.\u0027 The capsule opened, and the pneumatic padding shoved me gently from behind,so that, in order to keep my balance, I had to take a step forward. \n \n With a muffled sigh of resignation, the spacesuit expelled its air. I was free. \n \n I found myself inside a vast, silver funnel, as high as a cathedral nave. A cluster of coloredpipes ran down the sloping walls and disappeared into rounded orifices. I turned round. Theventilation shafts were roaring, sucking in the poisonous gases from the planet\u0027s atmospherewhich had infiltrated when my capsule had landed inside the Station. Empty, resembling aburst cocoon, the cigar-shaped capsule stood upright, enfolded by a calyx mounted on a steelbase. The outer casing, scorched during flight, had turned a dirty brown. \n \n I went down a small stairway. The metal floor below had been coated with a heavy-dutyplastic. In places, the wheels of trolleys carrying rockets had worn through this plastic coveringto expose the bare steel beneath. \n \n The throbbing of the ventilators ceased abruptly and there was total silence. I looked aroundme, a little uncertain, waiting for someone to appear; but there was no sign of life. Only a neonarrow glowed, pointing towards a moving walkway which was silently unreeling. I allowedmyself to be carried forward. \n \n The ceiling of the hall descended in a fine parabolic arc until it reached the entrance to agallery, in whose recesses gas cylinders, gauges, parachutes, crates and a quantity of otherobjects were scattered about in untidy heaps. \n \n The moving walkway set me down at the far end of the gallery, on the threshold of a dome. \n \n Here there was an even greater disorder. A pool of oily liquid spread out from beneath a pile ofoil-drams; a nauseating smell hung in the air; footprints, in a series of glutinous smears, wentoff in all directions. The oil-drums were covered with a tangle of tickertape, torn paper andother waste. \n \n Another green arrow directed me to the central door. Behind this stretched a narrow corridor,hardly wide enough for two men to walk side by side, lit by slabs of glass let into the ceiling. \n \n Then another door, painted in green and white squares, which was ajar; I went in. \n \n The cabin had concave walls and a big panoramic window, which a glowing mist had tingedwith purple. Outside the murky waves slid silently past. Open cupboards lined the walls, filledwith instruments, books, dirty glasses, vacuum flasks—all covered with dust. Five or six smalltrolleys and some collapsible chairs cluttered up the stained floor. One chair alone was inflated,its back raised. In this armchair there was a little thin man, his face burnt by the sun, the skinon his nose and cheeks coming away in large flakes. I recognized him as Snow, a cyberneticsexpert and Gibarian\u0027s deputy. In his time he had published articles of great originality in theSolarist Annual. It so happened that I had never had the opportunity of meeting him. He waswearing a mesh shirt which allowed the grey hairs of his sunken chest to poke through here andthere, and canvas trousers with a great many pockets, mechanic\u0027s trousers, which had oncebeen white but now were stained at the knees and covered with holes from chemical burns. Hewas holding one of those pear-shaped plastic flasks which are used in spaceships not equippedwith internal gravitational systems. Snow\u0027s eyes widened in amazement as he looked up andsaw me. The flask dropped from his fingers and bounced several times, spilling a few drops oftransparent liquid. Blood drained from his face. I was too astonished to speak, and thisdumbshow continued for so long that Snow\u0027s terror gradually communicated itself to me. Itook a step forward. He cringed in his chair. \n \n \"Snow?\"He quivered as though I had struck him. Gazing at me in indescribable horror, he gasped out: \n \n \"I don\u0027t know…\" His voice croaked. \"I don\u0027t know you…What do you want?\"The spilt liquid was quickly evaporating; I caught a whiff of alcohol. Had he been drinking? \n \n Was he drunk? What was he so terrified of? I stood in the middle of the room; my legs weretrembling; my ears roared, as though they were stuffed with cotton wool. I had the impressionthat the ground was giving way beneath my feet. Beyond the curved window, the ocean roseand fell with regularity. Snow\u0027s blood-shot eyes never left me. His terror seemed to haveabated, but his expression of invincible disgust remained. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter? Are you ill?\" I whispered. \n \n \"You seem worried,\" he said, his voice hollow. \"You actually seem worried…So it\u0027s like thatnow, is it? But why concern yourself about me? I don\u0027t know you.\"\"Where\u0027s Gibarian?\" I asked. \n \n He gave a gasp and his glassy eyes lit up for an instant. \n \n \"Gi…Giba…No! No!\"His whole frame shook with stifled, hysterical laughter; then he seemed to calm down a little. \n \n \"So it\u0027s Gibarian you\u0027ve come for, is it? Poor old Gibarian. What do you want with him?\" Hiswords, or rather his tone of voice, expressed hatred and defiance; it was as though I hadsuddenly ceased to represent a threat to him. \n \n Bewildered, I mumbled: \"What…Where is he?\"\"Don\u0027t you know?\"Obviously he was drunk and raving. My anger rose. I should have controlled myself and leftthe room, but I had lost patience. I shouted: \n \n \"That\u0027s enough! How could I know where he is since I\u0027ve only just arrived? Snow! What\u0027sgoing on here?\" His jaw dropped. Once again he caught his breath and his eyes gleamed with adifferent light. He seized the arms of his chair with both hands and stood up with difficulty. Hisknees were trembling. \n \n \"What? You\u0027ve just arrived…Where have you come from?\" he asked, almost sober. \n \n \"From Earth!\" I retorted angrily. \"Maybe you\u0027ve heard of it? Not that anyone would ever guessit.\"\"From Earth? Good God! Then you must be Kelvin.\"\"Of course. Why are you looking at me like that? What\u0027s so startling about me?\"He blinked rapidly. \n \n \"Nothing,\" he said, wiping his forehead, \"nothing, Forgive me, Kelvin, it\u0027s nothing, I assureyou. I was simply surprised, I didn\u0027t expect to see you.\"\"What do you mean, you didn\u0027t expect to see me? You were notified months ago, and Moddardradioed only today from the Prometheus.\"\"Yes; yes, indeed. Only, you see, we\u0027re a bit disorganized at the moment.\"\"So I see,\" I answered dryly. \n \n Snow walked around me, inspecting my atmosphere suit, which was standard issue with theusual harness of wires and cables attached to the chest. He coughed, and rubbed his bony nose: \n \n \"Perhaps you would like a bath? It would do you good. It\u0027s the blue door, on the other side.\"\"Thanks—I know the Station lay-out.\"\"You must be hungry.\"\"No. Where\u0027s Gibarian?\"Without answering, he went over to the window. From behind he looked considerably older. \n \n His close-cropped hair was grey, and deep wrinkles creased his sunburnt neck. \n \n The wave-crests glinted through the window, the colossal rollers rising and falling in slow-motion. Watching the ocean like this one had the illusion—it was surely an illusion—that theStation was moving imperceptibly, as though teetering on an invisible base; then it would seemto recover its equilibrium, only to lean the opposite way with the same lazy movement. Thickfoam, the color of blood, gathered in the troughs of the waves. For a fraction of a second, mythroat tightened and I thought longingly of the Prometheus and its strict discipline; the memoryof an existence which suddenly seemed a happy one, now gone forever. \n \n Snow turned around, nervously rubbing his hands together. \n \n \"Listen,\" he said abruptly, \"except for me there\u0027s no one around for the moment. You\u0027ll have tomake do with my company for today. Call me Ratface; don\u0027t argue. You know me by myphotograph, just imagine we\u0027re old friends. Everyone calls me Ratface, there\u0027s nothing I can doabout it.\"Obstinately, I repeated my question: \n \n \"Where is Gibarian?\"He blinked again. \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry to have received you like that. It\u0027s…it\u0027s not exactly my fault. I had completelyforgotten…A lot has been happening here, you see…\"\"It\u0027s all right. But what about Gibarian? Isn\u0027t he on the Station? Is he on an observation flight?\"Snow was gazing at a tangled mass of cables. \n \n \"No, he hasn\u0027t left the Station. And he won\u0027t be flying. The fact is….\"My ears were still blocked, and I was finding it more and more difficult to hear. \n \n \"What? What do you mean? Where is he then?\"\"I should think you might guess,\" he answered in a changed voice, looking me coldly in theeyes. I shivered. He was drunk, but he knew what he was saying. \n \n \"There\u0027s been an accident?\"He nodded vigorously, watching my reactions closely. \n \n \"When?\"\"This morning, at dawn.\"By now, my sensations were less violent; this succinct exchange of questions and answers hadcalmed me. I was beginning to understand Snow\u0027s strange behavior. \n \n \"What kind of accident?\"\"Why not go to your cabin and take off your spacesuit? Come back in, say, an hour\u0027s time.\"I hesitated. \n \n \"All right,\" I said finally. \n \n As I made to leave, he called me back. \n \n \"Wait!\" He had an uneasy look, as if he wanted to add something but was finding it difficult tobring out the words. After a pause, he said: \n \n \"There used to be three of us here. Now, with you, there are three of us again. Do you knowSartorius?\"\"In the same way as I knew you—only from his photographs.\"\"He\u0027s up there, in the laboratory, and I doubt if he\u0027ll come down before dark, but…In any case,you\u0027ll recognize him. If you should see anyone else—someone who isn\u0027t me or Sartorius, youunderstand, then…\"\"Then what?\"I must be dreaming. All this could only be a dream! The inky waves, their crimson gleamsunder the low-hanging sun, and this little man who had gone back to his armchair, sitting thereas before, hanging his head and staring at the heap of cables. \n \n \"In that case, do nothing.\"\"Who could I see?\" I flared up. \"A ghost?\"\"You think I\u0027m mad, of course. No, no, I\u0027m not mad. I can\u0027t say anything more for the moment. \n \n Perhaps…who knows?…Nothing will happen. But don\u0027t forget I warned you.\"\"Don\u0027t be so mysterious. What\u0027s all this about?\"\"Keep a hold on yourself. Be prepared to meet…anything. It sounds impossible I know, buttry. It\u0027s the only advice I can give you. I can\u0027t think of anything better.\"\"But what could I possibly meet?\" I shouted. \n \n Seeing him sitting there, looking sideways at me, his sunburnt face drooping with fatigue, Ifound it difficult to contain myself. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake him. \n \n Painfully, dragging the words out one by one, he answered: \n \n \"I don\u0027t know. In a way, it depends on you.\"\"Hallucinations, you mean?\"\"No…it\u0027s real enough. Don\u0027t attack. Whatever you do, remember that!\"\"What are you getting at?\" I could hardly recognize the sound of my own voice. \n \n \"We\u0027re not on Earth, you know.\"\"A Polytherian form?\" I shouted. \"There\u0027s nothing human about them!\"I was about to rush at him, to drag him out of the trance, prompted, apparently, by his crazytheories, when he murmured: \n \n \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re so dangerous. Remember what I\u0027ve told you, and be on your guard!\"\"What happened to Gibarian?\"He did not answer. \n \n \"What is Sartorius doing?\"\"Come back in an hour.\"I turned and went out. As I closed the door behind me, I took a last look at him. Tiny,shrunken, his head in his hands and his elbows resting on his stained knees, he sat there,motionless. It was only then that I noticed the dried bloodstains on the backs of his hands. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996/29987.html","bookId":222,"book":{"id":222,"title":"Solaris 星球梭那里斯/索拉利斯星","description":"简介： 在太空站驻守的科学家小组突然切断了和地球的所有联系，心理学家基思博士奉命到太空站调查原因。但当基思到达后，却发现要求他前来的组长吉巴已神秘自杀，而另外两位科学家的情绪则极度不稳定，并经常出现妄想症状，这一切，都似乎与神秘的索拉罗斯星球有关。与此同时，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
