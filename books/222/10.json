{"id":6871,"no":10,"title":"10 CONVERSATION","content":"The following morning, I received another note from Snow: Sartorius had left off working onthe disruptor and was getting ready for a final experiment with high-power X-rays. \"Rheya, darling, I have to pay a visit to Snow.\"The red dawn blazing through the window divided the room in two. We were in an area of blueshadow. Everything outside this shadow-zone was burnished copper: if a book had fallen froma shelf, my ear would have listened instinctively for a metallic clang. \"It\u0027s to do with the experiment. Only I don\u0027t know what to do about it. Please understand, I\u0027drather…\"\"You needn\u0027t justify yourself, Kris. If only it doesn\u0027t go on too long.\"\"It\u0027s bound to take a while. Look, do you think you could wait in the corridor?\"\"I can try. But what if I lose control?\"\"What does it feel like? I\u0027m not asking just out of curiosity, believe me, but if we can discusshow it works you might find some way of keeping it in check.\"Rheya had turned pale, but she tried to explain: \"I feel afraid, not of some thing or some person—there\u0027s no focus, only a sense of being lost. And I am terribly ashamed of myself. Then, when you come back, it stops. That\u0027s what mademe think I might have been ill.\"\"Perhaps it\u0027s only inside this damned Station that it works. I\u0027ll make arrangements for us to getout as soon as possible.\"\"Do you think you can?\"\"Why not? I\u0027m not a prisoner here. I\u0027ll have to talk it over with Snow. Have you any idea howlong you could manage to remain by yourself?\"\"That depends…If I could hear your voice, I think might be able to hold out.\"\"I\u0027d rather you weren\u0027t listening. Not that I have anything to hide, but there\u0027s no telling whatSnow might say.\"\"You needn\u0027t go on. I understand. I\u0027ll just stand close enough to hear the sound of your voice.\"\"I\u0027m going to the operating room to phone him. The doors will be open.\"Rheya nodded agreement. I crossed the red zone. The corridor seemed dark by contrast, in spite of the lighting. Inside theopen door of the operating room, fragments of the Dewar bottle, the last traces of the previousnight\u0027s events, gleamed from under a row of liquid oxygen containers. When I took the phoneoff the hook, the little screen lit up, and I tapped out the number of the radio-cabin. Behind thedull glass, a spot of bluish light grew, burst, and Snow was looking at me perched on the edgeof his chair. \"I got your note and I want to talk to you. Can I come over?\"\"Yes. Right away?\"\"Yes.\"\"Excuse me, but are you coming alone or accompanied?\"\"Alone.\"His creased forehead and thin, tanned face filled the screen as he leant forward to scrutinize methrough the convex glass. Then he appeared to reach an abrupt decision: \"Fine, fine, I\u0027ll be expecting you.\"I went back to the cabin, where I could barely make the shape of Rheya behind the curtain ofred sunlight. She was sitting in an armchair, with her hands clutching the armrests. She musthave failed to hear my footsteps, and I saw her for a moment fighting the inexplicablecompulsion that possessed her and wrestling with the fierce contractions of her entire bodywhich stopped immediately she saw me. I choked back a feeling of blind rage and pity. We walked in silence down the long corridor with its polychromed walls; the designers hadintended the variations in color to make life more tolerable inside the armored shell of theStation. A shaft of red light ahead of us meant that the door of the radio-cabin was ajar, and Ilooked at Rheya. She made no attempt to return my smile, totally absorbed in her preparationsfor the coming battle with herself. Now that the ordeal was about to begin, her face waspinched and white. Fifteen paces from the door, she stopped, pushing me forward gently withher fingertips as I started to turn around. Suddenly I felt that Snow, the experiment, even theStation itself were not worth the agonizing price that Rheya was ready to pay, with myself asassistant torturer. I would have retraced my steps, but a shadow fell across the cabin doorway,and I hurried inside. Snow stood facing me with the red sun behind him making a halo of purple light out of hisgrey hair. We confronted one another without speaking, and he was able to examine me at hisleisure in the sunlight that dazzled me so that I could hardly see him. I walked past him and leaned against a tall desk bristling with microphones on their flexiblestalks. Snow pivoted slowly and went on staring at me with his habitual cheerless smile, inwhich there was no amusement, only overpowering fatigue. Still with his eyes on mine, hepicked his way through the piles of objects littered about the cabin—thermic cells, instruments,spare parts for the electronic equipment—pulled a stool up against the door of a steel cabinet,and sat down. I listened anxiously, but no sound came from the corridor. Why did Snow not speak? Theprolonged silence was becoming exasperating. I cleared my throat: \"When will you and Sartorius be ready?\"\"We can start today, but the recording will take some time.\"\"Recording? You mean the encephalogram?\"\"Yes, you agreed. Is anything wrong?\"\"No, nothing.\"Another lengthening silence. Snow broke it: \"Did you have something to tell me?\"\"She knows,\" I whispered. He frowned, but I had the impression that he was not really surprised. Then why pretend? I lostall desire to confide in him. All the same, I had to be honest: \"She started to suspect after our meeting in the library. My behavior, various other indications. Then she found Gibarian\u0027s tape-recorder and played back the tape.\"Snow sat intent and unmoving. Standing by the desk, my view of the corridor was blocked bythe half-open door. I lowered my voice again: \"Last night, while I was asleep, she tried to kill herself, She drank liquid oxygen…\" There wasa sound of rustling, like papers stirred by the wind. I stopped and listened for something in thecorridor, but the noise did not come from there. A mouse in the cabin? Out of the question, thiswas Solaris. I stole a glance at Snow. \"Go on,\" he said calmly. \"It didn\u0027t work, of course. Anyway, she knows who she is.\"\"Why tell me?\"I was taken aback for an instant, then I stammered out: \"So as to inform you, to keep you up todate on the situation…\"\"I warned you.\"\"You mean you knew?\" My voice rose involuntarily. \"What you have just told me? Of course not. But I explained the position. When it arrives, thevisitor is almost blank—only a ghost made up of memories and vague images dredged out ofits…source. The longer it stays with you, the more human it becomes. It also becomes moreindependent, up to a certain point. And the longer that goes on, the more difficult it gets…\"Snow broke off, looked me up and down, and went on reluctantly: \"Does she knoweverything?\"\"Yes, I\u0027ve just told you.\"\"Everything? Does she know that she came once before, and that you…\"\"No!\"\"Listen Kelvin,\" he smiled ruefully, \"if that\u0027s how it is, what do you want to do—leave theStation?\"\"Yes.\"\"With her?\"The silence while he considered his reply also revealed something else. Again, fromsomewhere close, and without being able to pin it down, I heard the same faint rustling in thecabin, as if through a thin partition. Snow shifted on his stool. \"All right. Why look at me like that? Do you think I would stand in your way? You can do asyou like, Kelvin. We\u0027re in enough trouble already without putting pressure on each other. Iknow it will be a hopeless job to convince you, but there\u0027s something I have to say: you aredoing all you can to stay human in an inhuman situation. Noble it may be, but it isn\u0027t going toget you anywhere. And I\u0027m not so sure about it being noble—not if it\u0027s idiotic at the same time. But that\u0027s your affair. Let\u0027s get back to the point. You renege on the experiment and take heraway with you. Has it struck you that you\u0027ll only be embarking on a different kind ofexperiment?\"\"What do you mean? If you want to know whether she can manage it, as long as I\u0027m with her, Idon\u0027t see…\" I trailed to a halt. Snow sighed: \"All of us have our heads in the sand, Kelvin, and we know it. There\u0027s no need to put on airs.\"\"I\u0027m not putting anything on.\"\"I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t want to offend you. I take back the airs, but I still think that you are playingthe ostrich game—and a particularly dangerous version. You deceive yourself, you deceiveher, and you chase your own tail. Do you know the necessary conditions for stabilizing aneutrino field?\"\"No, nor do you. Nor does anyone.\"\"Exactly. All we know is that the structure is inherently unstable, and can only be maintainedby means of a continuous energy input. Sartorius told me that. This energy creates a rotatingstabilization field. Now, does that energy come from outside the \u0027visitor,\u0027 or is it generatedinternally? You see the difference?\"\"Yes. If it is external, she…\"Snow finished the sentence for me: \"Away from Solaris, the structure disintegrates. It\u0027s only a theory, of course, but one that youcan verify, since you have already set up an experiment. The vehicle you launched is still inorbit. In my spare moments, I\u0027ve even calculated its trajectory. You can take off, intercept, andfind out what happened to the passenger…\"\"You\u0027re out of your mind,\" I yelled. \"You think so? And what if we brought the shuttle down again? No problem—it\u0027s on remotecontrol. We\u0027ll bring it out of orbit, and…\"\"Shut up!\"\"That won\u0027t do either? There\u0027s another method, a very simple one. It doesn\u0027t involve bringingthe shuttle down, only establishing radio contact. If she\u0027s alive, she\u0027ll reply, and…\"\"The oxygen would have run out days ago.\"\"She may not need it. Shall we try?\"\"Snow…Snow…\"He mimicked my intonation angrily: \"Kelvin…Kelvin…Think, just a little. Are you a man or not? Who are you trying to please? Who do you want to save? Yourself? Her? And which version of her? This one or that one? Haven\u0027t you got the guts to face them both? Surely you realize that you haven\u0027t thought itthrough. Let me tell you one last time, we are in a situation that is beyond morality.\"The rustling noise returned, and this time it sounded like nails scraping on a wall. All at once Iwas filled with a dull indifference. I saw myself, I saw both of us, from a long way off, as ifthrough the wrong end of a telescope, and everything looked meaningless, trivial, and slightlyridiculous. \"So what do you suggest? Send up another shuttle? She would be back tomorrow. And the dayafter, and the day after that. How long do you want it to go on? What\u0027s the good of disposing ofher if she keeps returning? How would it help me, or you, or Sartorius, or the Station?\"\"No, here\u0027s my suggestion: leave with her. You\u0027ll witness the transformation. After a fewminutes, you\u0027ll see…\"\"What? A monster, a demon?\"\"No, you\u0027ll see her die, that\u0027s all. Don\u0027t think that they are immortal—I promise you that theydie. And then what will you do? Come back…for a fresh sample?\" He stared at me withbantering condescension. \"That\u0027s enough!\" I burst out, clenching my fists. \"Oh, I\u0027m the one who has to be quiet? Look, I didn\u0027t start this conversation, and as far as I\u0027mconcerned it has gone on long enough. Let me just suggest some ways for you to amuseyourself. You could scourge the ocean with rods, for instance. You\u0027ve got it into your head thatyou\u0027re a traitor if you…\" He waved his hand in farewell, and raised his head as if to watch animaginary ship in flight. \"…and a good man if you keep her. Smiling when you feel likescreaming, and shamming cheerful when you want to beat your head against a wall, isn\u0027t thatbeing a traitor? What if it is not possible, here, to be anything but a traitor? What will you do? Take it out on that bastard Snow, who is the cause of it all? In that case, Kelvin, you just putthe lid on the rest of your troubles by acting like a complete idiot!\"\"You are talking from your own point of view. I love this girl.\"\"Her memory, you mean?\"\"No, herself. I told you what she tried to do. How many \u0027real\u0027 human beings could have thatmuch courage?\"\"So you admit…\"\"Don\u0027t quibble.\"\"Right. So she loves you. And you want to love her. It isn\u0027t the same thing.\"\"You\u0027re wrong.\"\"I\u0027m sorry, Kelvin, but it was your idea to spill all this. You don\u0027t love her. You do love her. She is willing to give her life. So are you. It\u0027s touching, it\u0027s magnificent, anything you like, butit\u0027s out of place here—it\u0027s the wrong setting. Don\u0027t you see? No, you don\u0027t want to. You aregoing around in circles to satisfy the curiosity of a power we don\u0027t understand and can\u0027t control,and she is an aspect, a periodic manifestation of that power. If she was…if you were beingpestered by some infatuated hag, you wouldn\u0027t think twice about packing her off, right?\"\"I suppose so.\"\"Well then, that probably explains why she is not a hag! You feel as if your hands are tied? That\u0027s just it, they are!\"\"All you are doing is adding one more theory to the millions of theories in the library. Leaveme alone Snow, she is…No, I won\u0027t say any more.\"\"It\u0027s up to you. But remember that she is a mirror that reflects a part of your mind. If she isbeautiful, it\u0027s because your memories are. You provide the formula. You can only finish whereyou started, don\u0027t forget that.\"\"What do you expect me to do? Send her away? I\u0027ve already asked you why, and you don\u0027tanswer.\"\"I\u0027ll give you an answer. It was you who wanted this conversation, not me. I haven\u0027t meddledwith your affairs, and I\u0027m not telling you what to do or what not to do. Even if I had the right, Iwould not. You come here of your own free will, and you dump it all on me. You know why? To take the weight off your own back. Well I\u0027ve experienced that weight—don\u0027t try to shut meup—and I leave you free to find your own solution. But you want opposition. If I got in yourway, you could fight me, something tangible, a man just like you, with the same flesh andblood. Fight me, and you could feel that you too were a man. When I don\u0027t give you the excuseto fight, you quarrel with me, or rather with yourself. The one thing you\u0027ve left out is telling meyou\u0027d die of grief if she suddenly disappeared…No, please, I\u0027ve heard enough!\"I countered clumsily: \"I came to tell you, because I thought you ought to know, that I intend leaving the Station withher.\"\"Still on the same tack,\" Snow shrugged. \"I only offered my opinion because I realized thatyou were losing touch with reality. And the further you go, the harder you fall. Can you comeand see Sartorius around nine tomorrow morning?\"\"Sartorius? I thought he wasn\u0027t letting anybody in. You told me you couldn\u0027t even phone him.\"\"He seems to have reached some land of settlement. We never discuss our domestic troubles. With you, it\u0027s another matter. Will you come tomorrow morning?\"\"All right,\" I grunted. I noticed that Snow had slipped his left hand inside the cabinet. How long had the door beenajar? Probably for some time, but in the heat of the encounter I had not registered that theposition of his hand was not natural. It was as if he was concealing something—or holdingsomebody\u0027s hand. I licked my lips: \"Snow, what have you…\"\"You\u0027d better leave now,\" he said evenly. I closed the door in the final glow of the red twilight. Rheya was huddled against the wall afew paces down the corridor. She sprang to her feet at once: \"You see? I did it, Kris. I feel so much better…Perhaps it will be easier and easier…\"\"Yes, of course…\" I answered absently. We went back to my quarters. I was still speculating about that cabinet, and what had beenhiding there, perhaps overhearing our entire conversation. My cheeks started to burn so hardthat I involuntarily passed the back of my hand over them. What an idiotic meeting! And wheredid it get us? Nowhere. But there was tomorrow morning. An abrupt thrill of fear ran through me. My encephalogram, a complete record of the workingsof my brain, was to be beamed into the ocean in the form of radiation. What was it Snow hadsaid—would I suffer terribly if Rheya departed? An encephalogram records every mentalprocess, conscious and unconscious. If I want her to disappear, will it happen? But if I wantedto get rid of her would I also be appalled at the thought of her imminent destruction? Am Iresponsible for my unconscious? No one else is, if not myself. How stupid to agree to let themdo it. Obviously I can examine the recording before it is used, but I won\u0027t be able to decode it. Nobody could. The experts can only identify general mental tendencies. For instance, they willsay that the subject is thinking about some mathematical problem, but they are unable tospecify its precise terms. They claim that they have to stick to generalizations because theencephalogram cannot discriminate among the stream of simultaneous impulses, only some ofwhich have any psychological \"counterpart,\" and they refuse point-blank to hazard anycomment on the unconscious processes. So how could they be expected to decipher memorieswhich have been more or less repressed? Then why was I so afraid? I had told Rheya only that morning that the experiment could notwork. If Terran neurophysiologists were incapable of decoding the recording, what chance wasthere for that great alien creature…? Yet it had infiltrated my mind without my knowledge, surveyed my memory, and laid bare mymost vulnerable point. That was undeniable. Without any assistance or radiation transmissions,it had found its way through the armored shell of the Station, located me, and come away withits spoils…\"Kris?\" Rheya whispered. Standing at the window with unseeing eyes, I had not noticed the coming of darkness. A thinveiling of high cloud glowed a dim silver in the light of the vanished sun, and obscured thestars. If she disappears after the experiment, that will mean that I wanted her to disappear—that Ikilled her. No, I will not see Sartorius. They can\u0027t force me to cooperate. But I can\u0027t tell themthe truth, I\u0027ll have to dissemble and lie, and keep on doing it…Because there may be thoughts,intentions and cruel hopes in my mind of which I know nothing, because I am a murdererunawares. Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without havingexplored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what liesbehind doorways that he himself has sealed. Was I to abandon Rheya there out of false shame,or because I lacked the courage? \"Kris,\" said Rheya, more softly still. She was standing quite close to me now. I pretended not to hear. At that moment, I wanted toisolate myself. I had not yet resolved anything, or reached any decision. I stood motionless,looking at the dark sky and the cold stars, pale ghosts of the stars that shone on Earth. My mindwas a blank. All I had was the grim certainty of having crossed some point of no return. Irefused to admit that I was travelling towards what I could not reach. Apathy robbed me of thestrength even to despise myself.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996/29996.html","bookId":222,"book":{"id":222,"title":"Solaris 星球梭那里斯/索拉利斯星","description":"简介： 在太空站驻守的科学家小组突然切断了和地球的所有联系，心理学家基思博士奉命到太空站调查原因。但当基思到达后，却发现要求他前来的组长吉巴已神秘自杀，而另外两位科学家的情绪则极度不稳定，并经常出现妄想症状，这一切，都似乎与神秘的索拉罗斯星球有关。与此同时，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/996","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
