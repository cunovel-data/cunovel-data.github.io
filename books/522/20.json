{"id":32817,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"If you take even a good-humored puppy of a savage breed and tie him to a kennel so that all his natural energy strikes in; if you feed him upon raw meat, when you feed him at all, but half starve him for the most part; and if you tantalize and goad him whenever you are in search of a pastime, he is more than likely to become a dangerous beast when he grows up. He is then a menace to the public, so you have but one course left—to take him out and shoot him. That is the proper way to bring up dogs. It makes them useful members of society. And it applies equally well to Indians. It has worked beautifully with them for several hundred years. In Canada they have run it on another principle. But they have missed much of the fun we have had out of it. In the territories there was plenty of such fun. And it had pretty well reached its height in the spring of \u002783. The Indians, being wicked, ungrateful, suspicious characters, doubted the promises of the White-eyes. But it is only just to be charitable toward their ignorance. They were children of the wilderness and of the desert places, walking in darkness. Had the lights of the benefits of civilization ever shone in upon them, they would have realized that the government[Pg 226] of these United States, down to its very least official representative, never lies, never even evades. \"Have I ever lied to you?\" Crook asked them. And the deaf old chief Pedro answered for them: \"No,\" he said, \"when you were here before, whenever you said a thing, we knew that it was true, and we kept it in our minds. When you were here, we were content; but we cannot understand why you went away. Why did you leave us? Everything was all right when you were here.\" He was but an unlearned and simple savage, and the workings of a War Department were, of course, a mystery to him. He and his people should have believed Crook. The thoughtful government which that much-harassed general represented had done everything possible to instill sweet trustfulness into their minds. But the Apache, as all reports have set forth, is an uncertain quantity. The quiet, observant, capable man, whose fate it was to be always called in for the thankless task of undoing the evil work of others, made every effort to pacify this time, but he failed. \"Yes, we believe you,\" said the Apache; \"but you may go away again.\" So he refused to be cajoled, and going upon the war-path, after much bloodshed, fled into Mexico. The general took a couple of hundred Indian scouts, enlisted for six months\u0027 service, a troop of cavalry, and a half-dozen guides and interpreters, and followed across the border. [Pg 227] There was a new treaty, just made to that end. It was the fiercest of all the Apache tribes, the Chiricahuas, that had hidden itself in the fastnesses of the Sierra Madre, two hundred miles south of the boundary line. Geronimo and Juh and Chato, and other chiefs of quite as bloody fame, were with him. To capture them would be very creditable success. To fail to do so would entail dire consequences, international complications perhaps, and of a certainty the scorn and abuse of all the wise men who sat in judgment afar off. The general kept his own counsel then, but afterward, when it was all over, he confessed,—not to the rejoicing reporter who was making columns out of him for the papers of this, and even of many another, land,—but to the friends who had in some measure understood and believed in him, that the strain and responsibility had all but worn him out. And he was no frail man, this mighty hunter of the plains. The general of romance is a dashing creature, who wears gold lace and has stars upon his shoulder straps, and rides a fiery charger at the head of his troops. He always sits upon the charger, a field-glass in his hand and waiting aides upon every side, or flourishes a sword as he plunges into the thick of the battle smoke. But Crook was not dashing, only quiet and steady, and sure as death. Upon parade and occasions of ceremony he wore the gold lace and the stars. To do his life\u0027s work he put on an old flannel shirt, tied a kerchief around his neck, and set a pith helmet over those farseeing, keen little eyes. He might have been a [Pg 228]prospector, or a cow-boy, for all the outward seeming of it. His charger was oftenest a little government mule, and he walked, leading it over many and many a trail that even its sure feet could not trust. There were plenty such trails in the Sierra Madre, through which the Apache scouts were guiding him to their hostile brothers. Cairness had come along with his own band of scouts. He had seen rough work in his time, but none equal to this. Eight mules stepped a hand\u0027s breadth from the path, and lay hundreds of feet below at the base of the precipice, their backs broken under their aparejos. The boots were torn from the men\u0027s feet, their hands were cut with sharp rocks. They marched by night sometimes, sometimes by day, always to the limit of their strength. And upon the fourteenth morning they came upon the Chiricahua stronghold. Without the scouts they could never have found it. The Indian has betrayed the Indian from first to last. It was a little pocket, a natural fortress, high up on a commanding peak. Cairness crept forward flat along the rocks, raised his head cautiously and looked down. There in the sunrise light,—the gorgeous sunrise of the southern mountain peaks where the wind is fresh out of the universe and glitters and quivers with sparks of new life,—there was the encampment of the hostiles. It was a small Eden of green grass and water and trees high up in the Sierra—that strange mountain chain that seems as though it might have been the giant model of the Aztec builders, and that holds the mystery of a[Pg 229] mysterious people locked in its stone and metal breasts, as securely as it does that of the rich, lost mines whose fabled wonders no man can prove to-day. There is a majesty about the mountains of the desolate regions which is not in those of more green and fertile lands. Loneliness and endurance are written deep in their clefts and ca?ons and precipices. In the long season of the sun, they look unshrinking back to the glaring sky, with a stern defiance. It is as the very wrath of God, but they will not melt before it. In the season of the rains, black clouds hang low upon them, guarding their sullen gloom. But just as in the sternest heart is here and there a spot of gentleness, so in these forbidding fastnesses there are bits of verdure and soft beauty too. And the Indian may be trusted to know of these. Here where the jacales clustered, there was grass and wood and water that might last indefinitely. The fortifications of Nature had been added to those of Nature\u0027s man. It was a stronghold. But the Apaches held it for only a day, for all that. They were unprepared and overconfident. Their bucks were for the most part away plundering the hapless Mexican settlements in the desert below. They had thought that no white troops nor Mexicans could follow here, and they had neglected to count with the scouts, who had been hostiles themselves in their day, and who had the thief\u0027s advantage in catching a thief. And so while the bucks and children wandered round among the trees or bathed in the creek, while the hobbled[Pg 230] ponies grazed leisurely on the rank grass, and the squaws carried fuel and built fires and began their day of drudgery, they were surprised. The fight began with a shot fired prematurely by one of the scouts, and lasted until nightfall—after the desultory manner of Indian mountain fights, where you fire at a tree-trunk or lichened rock, or at some black, red-bound head that shoots up quick as a prairie dog\u0027s and is gone again, and where you follow the tactics of the wary Apache in so far as you may. The curious part of it is that you beat him at his own game every time. It is always the troops that lose the least heavily! The Indian wars of the southwest have been made a very small side issue in our history. The men who have carried them on have gained little glory and little fame. And yet they have accomplished a big task, and accomplished it well. They have subdued an enemy many times their own number. And the enemy has had such enormous advantages, too. He has been armed, since the 70\u0027s, even better than the troops. He has been upon his own ground—a ground that was alone enough to dismay the soldier, and one that gave him food, where it gave the white man death by starvation and thirst. He knew every foot of the country, fastnesses, water holes, creeks, and strongholds over thousands of miles. The best cavalry can travel continuously but twenty-five or thirty miles a day, carrying its own rations. The Apache, stealing his stock and food as he runs, covers his fifty or seventy-five. The troops must find and follow trails that are disguised[Pg 231] with impish craft. The Apache goes where he lists, and that, as a general thing, over country where devils would fear to tread. Then throw into the scale the harassing and conflicting orders of a War Department, niggardly with its troops, several thousand miles away, wrapped in a dark veil of ignorance, and add the ever ready blame of the territorial citizen and press, and the wonder is, not that it took a score of years to settle the Apache question, but that it was ever settled at all. The all-day fight in the Sierra Madre stronghold was a very uneven one. There were two hundred and fifty of the government forces against some thirty-five bucks. But, after all, the number comes to nothing. You may as well shoot at one enemy as at a thousand, if he is not to be seen anyway, and you cannot hit him. Cairness reflected upon this as he fired for exactly the seventh time at a pair of beady eyes that flashed at him over a bush-topped rock by the creek, not five and twenty yards away, and then vanished utterly. There was something uncanny about it, and he was losing patience as well as ammunition. Three bullets from a repeating rifle had about finished him. One had gone through his hat. The eyes popped up again. Cairness fired again and missed. Then he did a thoroughly silly thing. He jumped out from behind his shelter and ran and leapt, straight down, and over to the rock by the stream. The beady eyes saw him coming and sparkled, with an evil sort of laughter. If Cairness had not slipped and gone sprawling down[Pg 232] at that moment, the fourth bullet would have brought him up short. It sung over him, instead, and splashed against a stone, and when he got to his feet again the eyes had come out from their hiding-place. They were in the head of a very young buck. He had sprung to the top of his rock and was dancing about with defiant hilarity, waving his hands and the Winchester, and grimacing tantalizingly. \"Yaw! ya!\" he screeched. Cairness discharged his revolver, but the boy whooped once more and was down, dodging around the stone. Cairness dodged after him, wrath in his heart and also a vow to switch the little devil when he should get him. But he did not seem to be getting him. The fighting stopped to watch the Ojo-blanco playing tag with the little Apache, right in the heart of the stronghold. The general stood still, with a chuckle, and looked on. \"Naughty little boy,\" he remarked to the captain of the scouts; \"but your man Cairness won\u0027t catch him, though.\" With the sublime indifference to the mockery of the world, characteristic of his race, Cairness kept at it. It was ridiculous. He had time to be dimly aware of that. And it certainly was not war. He did not know that they were affording the opposing forces much enjoyment. He had not even observed that the firing had stopped. But he meant to catch that much qualifiedly impudent little beast, or to know the reason why. And he would probably have known the reason why, if one of the Apache scouts, embarrassed by no notions of fair play, had not taken good aim and[Pg 233] brought his youthful kinsman down, with a bullet through his knee. The black eyes snapped with pain as he fell, but when Cairness, with a breathless oath at the spoiler of sport, whoever he might be, pounced down upon him, the snap turned to a twinkle. The little buck raised himself on his elbow. \"How! Cairness,\" he grinned. \"How Mees Landor?\" Cairness stopped short, speechless, with his mouth open. He did not even dodge after a bullet had hummed past his head. \"Who the devil—!\" he began. Then it dawned upon him. It was Felipa\u0027s protégé of the old Camp Thomas days. He was standing, and the boy was lying, and the shots of the Apaches flew about them. He stooped, and catching up his defeated foe, whose defeat was not half so entire as his own, scrambled out of the pocket and back among the troops. He carried his prisoner, who kicked vigorously with his good leg, and struck with both fists in protest against the ignominy of being held under anybody\u0027s arm like a sack of grain, back to the tied horses. \"Look out for the little customer, will you?\" he said to the medical officer. \"He\u0027s a great chum of mine. Many\u0027s the can of condensed milk and bag of peanuts the ungrateful young one has had out of me.\" \"What are you doing here?\" he asked in the White Mountain idiom; \"you aren\u0027t a Chiricahua.\" The boy grinned again. \"How Mees Landor?\" he repeated. His savage perception had noted that those words had some \"medicine\" or other that paralyzed[Pg 234] the Ojo-blanco temporarily. Cairness swore at him in good English, and went off abruptly. At sunset the camp surrendered. There were seven dead bucks found, but no one ever knew, of course, how many had fallen into ravines, or dragged themselves off to die in nooks. The Apache does not dread death, but he dreads having the White-man know that he has died. The spoils of the rancheria were varied, and some of them interesting as well. There were quite a hundred mules and horses, and there was money, to the sum of five thousand dollars or more. Also there were gold and silver watches and clothes and saddles and bridles—all the loot of the unhappy haciendas and pueblas down on the flat. But the most treasured of all their possessions was a little photograph album which had begun its varied career in the particular home of the misguided Indian philanthropist, Boston. There was human plunder, too—women from the villages, all Mexicans but one, and that one was American. Cairness, having gone off with some scouts to reconnoitre, did not see them that night. When he came back it was already dark, and he took his supper; and rolling himself in his blanket slept, as he had always for the past fortnight, with only the faintly radiant night sky above him. In the morning, while the cooks were getting breakfast and the steam of ration-Rio mounted as a grateful incense to the pink and yellow daybreak heavens, having bathed in the creek and elaborated his toilet[Pg 235] with a clean neckerchief in celebration of victory, he walked over to the bunch of tepees to see the women captives. He knew while he was yet afar off which was the American. She stood, big and gaunt, with her feet planted wide and her fists on her hips, looking over toward the general\u0027s tent. And when Cairness came nearer, strolling along with his hands in his pockets, observing the beauties of Nature and the entire vileness of man, she turned her head and gave him a defiant stare. He took his hands from his pockets and went forward, raising his disreputable campaign hat. \"Good morning, Mrs. Lawton,\" he said, not that he quite lived up to the excellent standard of Miss Winstanley, but that he understood the compelling force of civility, not to say the bewilderment. If you turn its bright light full in the face of one whose eyes are accustomed to the obscurity wherein walk the underbred, your chances for dazzling him until he shall fall into any pit you may have dug in his pathway are excellent. Nor was he disconcerted that she met him with a stony front and a glare of wrath. She glanced down at his outstretched hand, and kept her own great bony one on her hip still. Then she looked at him squarely again. She did not say \"Well?\" but she meant it. So he answered it blandly, and suggested that she had probably forgotten him, but that he had had the pleasure of meeting her once in the States. She continued to stare. He held that a husband is a husband still[Pg 236] until the law or death says otherwise, and that it was no part of a man\u0027s business to inquire into the domestic relations of his friends; so he said that he had had the pleasure of meeting her husband recently. \"He was at Fort Stanton,\" he added, \"upon some little matter of business, I believe. You will be glad to hear that he was well.\" He did not see fit to add that he was also in the county jail, awaiting trial on charge of destruction of government property. \"What\u0027s your name, young feller?\" she demanded. Cairness was hurt. \"Surely, Mrs. Lawton, you have not so entirely forgotten me. I am Charles Cairness, very much at your service.\" But she had forgotten, and she said so. He hesitated with a momentary compunction. She must have suffered pretty well for her sins already; her work-cut, knotty hands and her haggard face and the bend of her erstwhile too straight shoulders—all showed that plainly enough. It were not gallant; it might even be said to be cruel to worry her. But he remembered the dead Englishwoman, with her babies, stiff and dead, too, beside her on the floor of the charred cabin up among the mountains, and his heart was hardened. \"I spent a few days with the Kirbys once,\" he said, and looked straight into her eyes. They shifted, and there was no mistaking her uneasiness. He followed it up instantly on a bold hazard. It had to be done now, before she had time to retreat to the cover of her blank stolidity. \"Why did you leave them to[Pg 237] be massacred? What did you have against her and those little children?\" \"I didn\u0027t. None of your business,\" she defied him. \"I beg your pardon, madam,\" he said. \"It happens to be my business, though.\" Breakfast call sounded. At the first shrill note she started violently. She was very thoroughly unnerved, and he decided that an hour of thinking would make her worse so. He told her that he would see her after breakfast, and raising his hat again left her to the anticipation, and to helping the Mexican captives cook their meal of mescal root and rations. Later in the day, when the general and the interpreters were engaged in making clear to the bucks, who came straggling in to surrender, the wishes and intentions of the Great Father in Washington as regarded his refractory children in Arizona, he went back to the captives\u0027 tepee. The Texan was nowhere to be seen. He called to her and got no answer, then he looked in. She was not there. One of the Mexican women was standing by, and he went up to her and asked for the Gringa. The woman shrugged her round brown shoulders from which the rebozo had fallen quite away, and dropped her long lashes. \"No se,\" she murmured. \"Ay que si! You do know,\" he laughed; \"you tell me chula, or I will take you back to the United States with me.\" She laughed too, musically, with a bewitching gurgle,[Pg 238] and gave him a swift glance, at once soft and sad. \"Ella es muy fea, no es simpatica, la Gringa.\" Undoubtedly, as she said, the American was ugly and unattractive; but the Mexican was pretty and decidedly engaging. Cairness had been too nearly trapped once before to be lured now. He met the piece of brown femininity upon her own ground. \"You are quite right, querida mia. She is ugly and old, and you are beautiful and young, and I will take you with me to the States and buy a pink dress with lovely green ribbons, if you will tell me where the old woman is.\" \"\u0027Stá bajo,\" she stuck out her cleft chin in the direction of the trail that led out of the pocket down to the flat, far below. \"De veras?\" asked Cairness, sharply. He was of no mind to lose her like this, when he was so near his end. \"Truly,\" said the little thing, and nodded vehemently. He left her ignominiously, at a run. She stood laughing after him until he jumped over a rock and disappeared. \"She is his sweetheart, the vieja,\" she chattered to her companions. Cairness called to four of his scouts as he ran. They joined him, and he told them to help him search. In half an hour they found her, cowering in a cranny of rocks and manzanita. He dismissed the Indians, and then spoke to her. \"Now you sit on that stone there and listen to me,\" he said, and taking her by the shoulder put her down and stood over her. She kept her sullen glance on the ground, but she was shaking violently. [Pg 239] \"Your husband is in jail,\" he said without preface. He had done with the mask of civility. It had served its purpose. \"No he ain\u0027t.\" \"Yes he is. And I put him there.\" He left her to what he saw was her belief that it was because of the Kirby affair. \"You\u0027ll see when you get back. And I\u0027ll put you there, too, if I care to. The best chance you have is to do as I tell you.\" She was silent, but the stubbornness was going fast. She broke off a bunch of little pink blossoms and rolled it in her hands. \"Your best chance for keeping out of jail, too,\" he insisted, \"is to keep on the right side of me. Sabe? Now what I want to know is, what part Stone has in all this.\" He did not know what part any one had had in it, as a matter of fact, for he had failed in all attempts to make Lawton talk, in the two days he had had before leaving the post. \"Why don\u0027t you ask him?\" said Mrs. Lawton, astutely. \"Because I prefer to ask you, that\u0027s why—and to make you answer, too.\" He sat down cross-legged on the ground, facing her. \"I\u0027ve got plenty of time, my dear woman. I can stop here all day if you can, you know,\" he assured her. Afterward he made a painting of her as she had sat there, in among the rocks and the scrub growth, aged, bent, malevolent, and in garments that were picturesque because they were rags. He called it the Sibyl of the Sierra Madre. And, like the Trojan, he plied her with[Pg 240] questions—not of the future, but of the past. \"Well,\" he said, \"are you going to answer me?\" \"Didn\u0027t you find out from him?\" she asked. He changed his position leisurely, stretching out at full length and resting his head on his hand by way of gaining time. Then he told her that it was not until after he had caught and landed her husband that he had discovered that Stone was in it. \"Who told you he was?\" she asked. \"Never mind all that. I\u0027m here to question, not to be questioned. Now listen to me.\" And he went on to point out how she could not possibly get away from him and the troops until they were across the border, and that once there, it lay with him to turn her over to the authorities or to set her free. \"You can take your choice, of course. I give you my word—and I think you are quite clever enough to believe me—that if you do not tell me what I want to know about Stone, I will land you where I\u0027ve landed your husband; and that if you do, you shall go free after I\u0027ve done with you. Now I can wait until you decide to answer,\" and he rolled over on his back, put his arms under his head, and gazed up at the jewel-blue patch of sky. There was a long pause. A hawk lighted on a point of rock and twinkled its little eyes at them. Two or three squirrels whisked in and out. Once a scout came by and stood looking at them, then went on, noiselessly, up the mountain side. \"What do you want to know for?\" asked the woman, at length. [Pg 241] He repeated that he was not there to be questioned, and showed her that he meant it by silence. Presently she began again, \"Well, he wasn\u0027t in it at all. Stone wasn\u0027t.\" This was not what Cairness wanted either. He persisted in the silence. A prolonged silence will sometimes have much the same effect as solitary confinement. It will force speech against the speaker\u0027s own will. Mrs. Lawton gritted her teeth at him as though she would have rejoiced greatly to have had his neck between them. By and by she started once more. \"Bill jest told him about it—like a goldarned fool.\" \"That,\" said Cairness, cheerfully, \"is more like it. Go on.\" \"That\u0027s all.\" \"Begging your pardon, it\u0027s not all.\" \"What the devil do you want to know, then?\" He considered. \"Let me see. For instance, when did Lawton tell him, and why, and exactly what?\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" she mocked. \"You want the earth and some sun and moon and stars, don\u0027t you, though? Well, then, Bill told him about a week afterward. And he told him because Stone had another hold on him (it ain\u0027t any of your business what that was, I reckon), and bullied it out of him (Bill ain\u0027t got any more backbone than a rattler), and promised to lend him money to set up for hisself on the Circle K Ranch. Want to know anything else?\" she sneered. \"Several things, thanks. You haven\u0027t told me yet what version of it your husband gave to Stone.\" [Pg 242]Cairness was a little anxious. It was succeed or fail right here. \"Told him the truth, more idjit he.\" \"I didn\u0027t ask you that,\" he reminded her calmly. \"I asked what he told.\" \"Say!\" she apostrophized. \"Yes?\" \"You\u0027re English, I reckon, ain\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, and you don\u0027t like the English, I know that perfectly.\" \"You\u0027re right, I don\u0027t. You\u0027re as thick-headed as all the rest of them.\" \"Thanks. But you started out to tell me what Lawton told Stone.\" \"He told him the truth, I tell you: that when we heard the Apaches were coming, we lit out and drove out the stock from the corrals. I don\u0027t recollect his words.\" So that was it! It took all the self-command that thirty-five varied years had taught him not to rise up and knock her head against the sharp rocks. But he lay quite still, and presently he said: \"That is near enough for my purposes, thank you. But I would be interested to know, if you don\u0027t mind, what you had against a helpless woman and those two poor little babies. I wouldn\u0027t have supposed that a woman lived who could have been such a fiend as all that.\" The woman launched off into a torrent of vituperation and vile language that surprised even Cairness, whose ears were well seasoned. [Pg 243] \"Shut up!\" he commanded, jumping to his feet. \"You killed her and you ought to be burned at the stake for it, but you shall not talk about her like that, you devilish old crone.\" She glared at him, but she stopped short nevertheless, and, flinging down the stone she had been holding, stood up also. \"All right, then. You\u0027ve done with me, I reckon. Now suppose you let me go back to the camp.\" He turned and walked beside her. \"Don\u0027t you believe I know all that I want to. I\u0027ve only just begun. So that scoundrel knew the whole murderous story, and went on writing lies in his papers and covering you, when you ought to have been hung to the nearest tree, did he?—and for the excellent reason that he wanted to make use of your husband! I worked on the Circle K Ranch and on that other one over in New Mexico, which is supposed to be Lawton\u0027s, and it didn\u0027t take me long to find out that Stone was the real boss.\" \"He\u0027s got Bill right under his thumb,\" she sneered at her weak spouse. They clambered up the mountain side, back to the camp, and Cairness escorted her to the tepee in silence. Then he left her. \"Don\u0027t try to run away again,\" he advised. \"You can\u0027t get far.\" He started off and turned back. \"Speaking of running away, where\u0027s the Greaser you lit out with?\" She replied, with still more violent relapse into foul-tongued abuse, that he had gone off with a woman[Pg 244] of his own people. \"Got me down into this hell of a country and took every quartillo I had and then skedaddled.\" Cairness smiled. There was, it appeared, a small supply of poetic justice still left in the scheme of things to be meted out. \"And then the Apache came down and bore you off like a helpless lamb,\" he said. \"If I\u0027d been the Apache I\u0027d have made it several sorts of Hades for you, but I\u0027d have scalped you afterward. You\u0027d corrupt even a Chiricahua squaw. However, I\u0027m glad you lived until I got you.\" And he left her. But he kept a close watch upon her then and during all the hard, tedious march back to the States, when the troops and the scouts had to drag their steps to meet the strength of the women and children; when the rations gave out because there were some four hundred Indians to be provided for, when the command ate mescal root, digging it up from the ground and baking it; and when the presence of a horde of filthy savages made the White-man suffer many things not to be put in print. But they were returning victorious. The Chiricahuas were subdued. The hazard had turned well. There would be peace; the San Carlos Agency, breeding-grounds of all ills, would be turned over to military supervision. The general who had succeeded—if he had failed it would have been such a very different story—would have power to give his promise to the Apaches and to see that it was kept. The experiment of honesty and of giving the devil his due would have a[Pg 245] fair trial. The voices that had cried loudest abuse after the quiet soldier who, undisturbed, went so calmly on his way, doing the thing which seemed to him right, were silenced; and the soldier himself came back into his own land, crossing the border with his herds and his tribes behind him. There was no flourish of trumpets; no couriers were sent in advance to herald that the all but impossible had been accomplished. On a fine Sunday morning in June the triumphant general rode into a supply camp twelve miles north of the line, and spoke to the officer in command. \"Nice morning, Colonel,\" he said. And then his quick eyes spied the most desirable thing in all the camp. It was a tin wash basin set on a potato box. The triumphant general dismounted, and washed his face.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100/59617.html","bookId":522,"book":{"id":522,"title":"The heritage of unrest","description":"简介： It is one thing to be sacrificed to a cause, even if it is only by filling up the ditch that others may cross to victory; it is quite another to be sacrificed in a cause, to die unavailingly without profit or glory of any kind, to be even an obstacle...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
