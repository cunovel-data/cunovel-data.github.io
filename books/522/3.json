{"id":32800,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"In the \u002770\u0027s the frontier was a fact and not a memory, and a woman in the Far West was a blessing sent direct from heaven, or from the East, which was much the same thing. Lieutenants besought the wives of their brother officers to bring out their sisters and cousins and even aunts, and very weird specimens of the sex sometimes resulted. But even these could reign as queens, dance, ride, flirt to their hearts\u0027 content—also marry, which is not always the corollary in these days. The outbreak of a reservation full of Indians was a small thing in comparison with the excitement occasioned by the expectation of a girl in the post. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was now at Grant the prospect of a girl, and for days ahead the bachelors had planned about her. She was Landor\u0027s ward,—it was news to them that he had a ward, for he was not given to confidences,—and she was going to visit the wife of his captain, Mrs. Campbell. When they asked questions, Landor said she was eighteen years old, and that her name was Cabot, and that as he had not seen her for ten years he did not know whether she were pretty or not. But the vagueness surrounding her was rather attractive than otherwise, on the whole. It was not even known when she would arrive. There was no railroad to[Pg 14] Arizona. From Kansas she would have to travel by ambulance with the troops which were changing station. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was only Mrs. Campbell who knew the whole story. Landor had gone to her for advice, as had been his custom since the days before she had preferred Campbell to him. \"Felipa,\" he said, \"writes that she is going to run away from school, if I don\u0027t take her away. She says she will, and she undoubtedly means it. I have always noticed that there is no indecision in her character.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Campbell asked where she proposed running to. \\n\\n \\n\\n Landor did not know; but she was part Apache, he said, and Harry Cabot\u0027s daughter, and it was pretty certain that with that blood in her veins she had the spirit of adventure. \\n\\n \\n\\n She asked what he had thought of doing about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve thought of bringing her on here. But how can I? In a bachelor establishment? My sister won\u0027t have her at any terms. She suggested an orphan asylum from the first, and she hasn\u0027t changed her mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Campbell appliqued a black velvet imp on a green felt lambrequin, and thought. \"Do you ever happen to realize that you have your hands very full?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said shortly, \"I realize it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat staring over her head for a moment of silence. \"I foresaw it when I told Cabot I\u0027d take her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Might not an orphan asylum have been best, after all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It might for me,\" he said, \"but not for her, and I[Pg 15] told Cabot I\u0027d do my best for her.\" It had seemed to him his plain duty, and he had done it, and he asked no approbation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Campbell took it as he did, for a matter of course. She wasted no words in expressing admiration for what he had done, but kept to the main issue, making herself useful, as women are rarely content to do when they deal with men, without indulging her taste for the sentimental. \"Suppose I were to take her?\" she suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n He opposed drawbacks. \"You can\u0027t keep her always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled. \"The chances that she will marry are excellent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not answer at once, but sat watching the trumpeter come out of the adjutant\u0027s office to sound recall. \"Yes, she will marry,\" he agreed; \"if no one else marries her, I will. I am as old as her father would have been but it would save telling some fellow about her birth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did the girl know her own story?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n She did not. He had merely told her that her father was his friend and had died on the plains. \"She thinks her mother died at Stanton. It is so near the Mescalero Agency that I let it go at that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They argued it from all sides during the whole of a day, and Campbell lent his advice, and the end of it was that Felipa Cabot came out to the land of her forbears. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pending her arrival, Landor brought himself to look[Pg 16] upon it as his plain duty and only course to marry her. It would save her, and any man who might otherwise happen to love her, from learning what she was. That she might refuse to look at it in that way, did not much enter into his calculations. It required a strong effort for him to decide it so, but it was his way to pick out the roughest possible path before him, to settle within himself that it was that of duty, and to follow it without fagging or complaint. He dreaded any taint of Apache blood as he dreaded the venom of a rattler. He had seen its manifestations for twenty odd years, had seen the hostile savage and the civilized one, and shrank most from the latter. But he had promised Cabot to do his best by the waif, and the best he could see was to marry her. There was always before him, to urge him on to the sacrifice, the stalwart figure of his boyhood\u0027s friend, standing forsaken in the stretch of desert with the buzzards hovering over him in the burning sky. He permitted himself to hope, however, that she was not too obviously a squaw. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the day came he rode out with most of the garrison to meet her. He was anxious. He recalled Anne of Cleves, and had a fellow-feeling for the King. By the time they came in sight of the marching troops, he had worked himself to such an implicit faith in the worst that he decided that the wide figure, heavily blue-veiled, and linen-dustered, on the back seat of the Dougherty was she. It is one of the strongest arguments of the pessimist in favor[Pg 17] of his philosophy, that the advantage of expecting the disagreeable lies in the fact that, if he meets with disappointment, it is necessarily a pleasant one. \\n\\n \\n\\n Felipa Cabot proved to be a lithe creature, who rode beside the ambulance with the officers, and who, in spite of the dust and tan and traces of a hard march, was beautiful. In the reaction of the moment Landor thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. But she froze the consequent warmth of his greeting with a certain indefinable stolidity, and she eyed him with an unabashed intention of determining whether he were satisfactory or not, which changed his position to that of the one upon approbation. If she had been less handsome, it would have been repellent. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before they had reached the post, he had learned a good deal about her. The elderly major who had come with her from Kansas told him that a lieutenant by the name of Brewster was insanely in love with her, that the same Brewster was a good deal of an ass,—the two facts having no connection, however,—that she was an excellent travelling companion, always satisfied and always well. What the major did not tell him, but what he gathered almost at once, was that the girl had not endeared herself to any one; she was neither loved nor disliked—the lieutenant\u0027s infatuation was not to be taken as an indication of her character, of course. But then she was beautiful, with her long, intent eyes, and strong brows and features cut on classic lines of perfection. So Landor left the major and cantered ahead to join her, where she rode with Brewster. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 18] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has the trip been hard?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n She answered that she had enjoyed it all, every day of it, and Brewster joined in with ecstatic praises of her horsemanship and endurance, finishing with the unlucky comment that she rode like an Indian. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Apaches ride badly, don\u0027t they?\" she said, with calm matter of fact. \"If you mean that I am hard on my horse, though, you are right.\" Her voice was exquisitely sweet, without modulation. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the weeks that followed, Landor spent days and some nights—those when he sat up to visit the guard, as a rule—attempting to decide why his ward repelled him. She seemed to be quite like any other contented and natural young girl. She danced, and courted admiration, within the bounds of propriety; she was fond of dress, and rather above the average in intelligence. Usually she was excellent company, whimsical and sweet-humored. She rode well enough, and learned—to his intense annoyance—to shoot with a bow and arrow quite remarkably, so much so that they nicknamed her Diana. He had remonstrated at first, but there was no reason to urge, after all. Archery was quite a feminine sport. \\n\\n \\n\\n When his analysis of her failed, he went to Mrs. Campbell again. \"Do you grow fond of Felipa?\" he asked point blank. \\n\\n \\n\\n She tried to parry and evade, but he would not have it, and obliged her to admit that she did not. \"Not that I dislike her,\" she explained. \"I like to have her round. I dare say it is a whim.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 19] \\n\\n \\n\\n He shook his head. \"It is not a whim. It is the same with every one. Of course Brewster has lost his head, but that argues nothing. The endearing quality seems to be lacking in her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She sat considering deeply. She was rocking the baby, with its little fair head lying in the hollow of her shoulder, and Landor found himself wondering whether Felipa could ever develop motherliness. \"It is quite intangible,\" Mrs. Campbell half crooned, for the baby\u0027s lids were drooping heavily. \"I can\u0027t find that she lacks a good characteristic. I study her all the time. Perhaps the fault is in ourselves, as much as anything, because we insist upon studying her as a problem, instead of simply a very young girl. She is absolutely truthful,—unless she happens to have a grudge against some one, and then she lies without any scruple at all,—and she is generous and unselfish, and very amiable with the children, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Landor asked, with a gleam of hope, if they were attached to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" she told him, \"they are, and it is that makes me think that the fault may be ours. She is so patient with them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Felipa herself came up the steps and joined them on the porch. She walked with the gait of a young athlete. Her skirts were short enough to leave her movements unhampered, and she wore on her feet a pair of embroidered moccasins. She seemed to be drawing the very breath of life into her quivering nostrils, and she smiled on them both good-humoredly. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 20] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look,\" she said, going up to Landor with a noiseless tread that made him shiver almost visibly. Mrs. Campbell watched them. She was sorry for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Felipa held out her hand and showed a little brown bird that struggled feebly. She explained that its leg was broken, and he drew back instinctively. There was not a trace of softness or pity in her sweet voice. Then he took the bird in his own big hand and asked her how it had happened. \"I did it with an arrow,\" said Diana, unslinging her quiver, which was a barbaric affair of mountain-lion skin, red flannel, and beads. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see why you should take pleasure in shooting these harmless things,\" he said impatiently; \"the foot-hills are full of quail, and there are ducks along the creek. For that matter you might try your skill on prairie dogs, it seems to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked down at the curled toe of her moccasin with a certain air of repentance, and answered his question as to what she meant to do with it by explaining that she meant to keep it for a pet. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stroked its head with his finger as it lay still, opening and shutting its bright little eyes. \"It won\u0027t live,\" he told her, and then the thought occurred to him to put her to the test. He held the bird out to her. \"Wring its neck,\" he said, \"and end its misery.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She showed no especial repugnance at the idea, but refused flatly, nevertheless. \"I can\u0027t do that,\" she said, dropping down into the hammock and swinging herself with the tip of her foot on the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 21] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I fail to see why not. You can wound it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But that is sport,\" she answered carelessly. \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt that he ought to dislike her cordially, but he did not. He admired her, on the contrary, as he would have admired a fine boy. She seemed to have no religion, no ideals, and no petty vanity; therefore, from his point of judgment, she was not feminine. Perhaps the least feminine thing about her was the manner in which she appeared to take it for granted that he was going to marry her, without his having said, as yet, a word to that effect. In a certain way it simplified matters, and in another it made them more difficult. It is not easy to ask a woman to marry you where she looks into your eyes unhesitatingly. But Landor decided that it had to be done. She had been in the post four months, and with the standing exception of Brewster, whom she discouraged resolutely, none of the officers cared for her beyond the flirtation limit. \\n\\n \\n\\n So one night when they were sitting upon the Campbells\u0027 steps, he took the plunge. She had been talking earnestly, discussing the advisability of filing off the hammer of the pistol he had given her, to prevent its catching on the holster when she wanted to draw it quickly. One of her long, brown hands was laid on his knee, with the most admirable lack of self-consciousness. He put his own hand upon it, and she looked up questioningly. She was unused to caresses from any but the two Campbell children, and her frank surprise held a reproach that softened his voice almost to tenderness. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 22] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think you could love me, Felipa?\" he asked, without any preface at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n She said \"Yes\" as frankly as she would have said it to the children. It was blighting to any budding romance, but he tried hard nevertheless to save the next question from absolute baldness. He had a resentful sort of feeling that he was entitled to at least a little idealism. As she would not give it, he tried to find it for himself, noting the grace of her long free neck, the wealth of her coarse black hair, and the beauty of her smiling mouth. But the smiling mouth answered his low-spoken \"Will you marry me then, dear?\" with the same frank assent. \"Not for a good while, though,\" she added. \"I am too young.\" That was all, and in a moment she was telling him some of Brewster\u0027s absurdities, with a certain appreciation of the droll that kept it from being malicious. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he had made Mrs. Campbell his confidante from the first, he told her about this too, now, and finished with the half-helpless, half-amused query as to what he should do. \"It may be any length of time before she decides that she is old enough, and it never seems to occur to her that this state of things can\u0027t go on forever, that she is imposing upon you.\" \"And the most serious part of it,\" he added after a while, \"is that she does not love me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t love her, for that matter, either,\" Mrs. Campbell reminded him. But she advised the inevitable,—to wait and let it work itself out. \\n\\n \\n\\n So he waited and stood aside somewhat, to watch[Pg 23] the course of Brewster\u0027s suit. He derived some little amusement from it, too, but he wondered with rather a deeper tinge of anxiety than was altogether necessary what the final outcome would be. \\n\\n \\n\\n One morning Brewster met Felipa coming from the hospital and carrying a wide-mouthed bottle. He joined her and asked if the little lady were going to grow flowers in it. The little lady, who was quite as tall as and a good deal more imposing than himself, answered that it was for a vinagrone. He remonstrated. She was surely not going to make a pet of one of those villanous insects. No. She had caught a tarantula, too, and she was going to make them fight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Were you catching the tarantula yesterday when I saw you lying upon the ground by the dump heap?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"did you see me? I dare say you thought I was communing with Nature in the midst of the old tin cans and horseshoes. Well, I wasn\u0027t. I was watching the trap of a tarantula nest, and I caught him when he came out. I\u0027ve watched that hole for three days,\" she announced triumphantly. \"As for the vinagrone, the cook found him in his tent, and I bottled him. Come and see the fight,\" she invited amiably. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently she returned with two bottles. In one was the tarantula, an especially large and hideous specimen, hairy and black, with dull red tinges. In the other the vinagrone, yet more hideous. She went down to the side of the house and emptied both into the wide-mouthed bottle. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 24] \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster was in agony. He reached out and caught her hand. \"My darling,\" he cried, \"take care!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned on him quickly. \"Let me be,\" she commanded, and he obeyed humbly. Then she corked the bottle and shook it so that the animals rolled on top of each other, and laying it on the ground bent over it with the deepest interest. Brewster watched too, fascinated in spite of himself. It was so very ugly. The two wicked little creatures fought desperately. But after a time they withdrew to the sides of the bottle, and were quite still. The tarantula had left a leg lying loose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Felipa turned from them and waited, clasping her hands and smiling up at Brewster. He, misinterpreting, felt encouraged and begged her to leave the disgusting insects. He had something very different to talk about. She said that she did not want to hear it, and would he bet on the tarantula or the vinagrone? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t bring them into it,\" he implored. \"If you will not come away, I will tell you now, Felipa, that I love you.\" He was more in earnest than Landor had been. She felt that herself. His voice broke, and he paled. \\n\\n \\n\\n But she only considered the insects, which were beginning to move again, and answered absently that she knew it, that he had said it before. \"Oh! Mr. Brewster, bet quickly,\" she urged. \\n\\n \\n\\n He caught her by the arm, exasperated past all civility, and shook her. \"Do you hear me, Felipa Cabot? I tell you that I love you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 25] \\n\\n \\n\\n She was strong, slender as she was, and she freed herself almost without effort. And yet he would not be warned. \"Don\u0027t you love me?\" he insisted, as though she had not already made it plain enough. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she said shortly. \"You had better bet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He made as if to kick the bottle away, but quick as a flash she was on her feet and facing him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You touch that,\" she said resolutely, \"and I\u0027ll let them both loose on you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He turned on his heel and left her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Landor and the adjutant came by, and she called to them. The adjutant backed the vinagrone with a bag of sutler\u0027s candy, and Felipa took the tarantula. It was mainly legless trunk, but still furious. Landor studied her. She was quiet, but her eyes had grown narrow, and they gleamed curiously at the sight of the torn legs and feelers scattering around the bottle, wriggling and writhing. She was at her very worst. \\n\\n \\n\\n It ended in victory for the vinagrone, but he died from his wounds an hour later. Felipa told Landor so, as they started for a ride, early in the afternoon. \"The vinagrone is dead,\" she said; \"Mr. Brewster didn\u0027t like my fighting them.\" Then she assumed the lofty dignity that contrasted so oddly sometimes with her childish simplicity. \"He lacks tact awfully. Think of it! He took the occasion to say that he loved me. As though he had not told me so a dozen times before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you—what did you say?\" asked Landor. He was a little surprised to find how anxiously he[Pg 26] waited, and the extent of his relief when she answered, \"I told him to let me be, or I would set them loose on him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Official business called Brewster to the Agency next day. He stopped overnight, on the way, at a ranch whose owners depended more upon passing travellers than upon the bad soil and the thin cattle. And here fate threw in his way one whom he would have gone well out of that way to find. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a civilian with whom he was obliged to share his room. He did not fancy having to share his room at all, in the first place, and this and other things made his temper bad. The civilian, on the other hand, was in good temper, and inclined to be communicative. He tried several ways of opening a conversation, and undaunted by rebuffs tried yet once more. Like Bruce and the spider, it was exactly the seventh time that he succeeded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s things up at Grant?\" he drawled through his beard, as he took off that sacred and ceremonious garment known to the true frontiersman as his vest, and without which he feels as lost as without his high-heeled boots. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster mumbled out of a towel that he guessed they were all right, and implied what the dickens did it matter to him how they were. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hear you got Jack Landor up there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Brewster began to listen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, emptying the soap-caked water from the Indian basket wash basin upon the earth floor;[Pg 27] \"why?\"—\"I used to know him in \u002761. He came up to the Mescalero Agency then, not long before the Texans overran the place. I recollect there was a sort of blizzard and it was seventeen below. He came after a kid me and another feller\u0027d been looking after. Pretty little cuss, about four years old. I gave her her first bow\u0027n arrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster took on an elaborate and entirely unnecessary air of indifference, and yawned to heighten the effect. \"What did he want of the child?\" he asked negligently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her father was dead. He left her to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who was her father?\" Brewster wanted to know. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man told him. \"He\u0027d been a private up to Stanton, and had been killed by some of Cochise\u0027s people that summer. Her mother was a half-breed by the name of Felipa. Good-looking squaw, but dead, too—killed by Mexicans. Do you happen to know whatever became of the kid?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster told him that she was with Landor at the post now. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She must be a woman by this time,\" reflected the civilian. \"Is she married to him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster explained that she was visiting Captain Campbell\u0027s family. \\n\\n \\n\\n Did she show the squaw? he asked. \"Not unless you knew it was there,\" the officer said tolerantly. Then he went to bed and slept with that peace of mind which comes of a proud consciousness of holding the handle of the whip. In the morning he got the[Pg 28] man\u0027s name and address before he went on up to the Agency. \\n\\n \\n\\n There he heard of Landor again. This time it was through Barnwell, and the descriptions were picturesque. Brewster encouraged them, paying a good deal more heed to them than to the little complaints of the Indians he had been sent up to investigate. Then he returned to Grant, taking with him in the ambulance an enlisted man returning to receive his discharge. \\n\\n \\n\\n Barnwell had told Brewster about him also. \"His name is Cairness,—Charles Cairness,—and he\u0027s got a lot of fool theories too,\" he explained. \"He goes in for art, makes some pretty good paintings of the Indians, and has picked up some of their lingo. Made himself agreeable to the squaws, I guess. The interpreter says there\u0027s one got her nose cut off by her buck, on his account.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster suggested that he thought Crook had put a stop to those mutilations, but the official shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how true it was, and I certainly ain\u0027t going to look her up in her rancheria to find out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The hero of the episode rode in the ambulance, sitting on the front seat, holding his carbine across his knees, and peering with sharp, far-sighted blue eyes over the alkali flats. Occasionally he took a shot at a jack rabbit and brought it down unfailingly, but the frontiersman has no relish for rabbit meat, and it was left where it dropped, for the crows. He also brought down a sparrow hawk wounded in the wing, and, [Pg 29]having bound up the wound, offered it to Brewster, who took it as an opening to a conversation and tried to draw him out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Barnwell tells me,\" he began, \"that you have picked up a good deal of Apache.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some Sierra Blanca, sir,\" said the soldier. It was respectful enough, and yet there was somewhere in the man\u0027s whole manner an air of equality, even superiority, that exasperated the lieutenant. It was contrary to good order and military discipline that a private should speak without hesitation, or without offence to the English tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brewster resented it, and so the next thing he said was calculated to annoy. \"He says you are quite one of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is mistaken, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you an Indian policy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cairness\u0027s eyes turned from a little ground owl on the top of a mound and looked him full in the face. \"I really can\u0027t see, sir,\" he said, \"how it can matter to any one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It did not in the least matter to Brewster, but he was one of those trying people whom Nature has deprived of the instinct for knowing when to stop. A very perceptible sneer twitched his lips. \"You seem to be English,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am,\" announced the soldier. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now it is a hazardous undertaking to question an Englishman who does not care to be questioned. A person of good judgment would about as lief try to[Pg 30] poke up a cross lion to play. But Brewster persisted, and asked if Cairness would be willing to live among the Apaches. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They have their good traits, sir,\" said the man, civilly, \"and chief among them is that they mind their own business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was impossible to misunderstand, and Brewster was vexed beyond the bounds of all wisdom. \"The squaws have their good traits, too, I guess. I hear one had her nose cut off on your account.\" He should not have said it. He knew it, and he knew that the private knew it, but the man made no reply whatever. \\n\\n \\n\\n The remainder of the drive Cairness devoted to caring for the broken wing of the hawk, and, during halts, to sketching anything that presented itself,—the mules, the driver, passing Mexicans, or the cows trying to graze from ground where the alkali formed patches of white scum. He also accomplished a fine caricature of the lieutenant, and derived considerable silent amusement therefrom. \\n\\n \\n\\n The night of their return to the post, Cairness, crossing the parade ground shortly before retreat, saw Felipa. He had been walking with his eyes on the earth, debating within himself the question of his future, whether he should re?nlist, succumb to the habit of the service, which is to ambition and endeavor what opium is to the system, or drop back into the yet more aimless life he had been leading five years before, when a fit of self-disgust had caused him to decide that he was good for nothing but a trooper, if even that. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 31] \\n\\n \\n\\n A long sunset shadow fell across his path, and he looked up. Felipa was walking beside a little white burro, and holding Mrs. Campbell\u0027s golden-curled baby upon its back. She carried her head superbly erect, and her step, because of the moccasins, was quite noiseless. The glow of the sunset shone in her unflinching eyes, and lost itself in the dull black mass of her hair. She studied his face calmly, with a perfectly impersonal approval. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cairness went on, back to the barracks, and sitting at the troop clerk\u0027s desk, made a memory sketch of her. It did not by any means satisfy him, but he kept it nevertheless. \\n\\n \\n\\n That night he sat upon the edge of his bunk, in the darkness, after taps, with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hand, and thought the matter to a conclusion. The conclusion was that he would not re?nlist, and the reason for it was the girl he had met on the parade ground. He knew the power that beauty had over him. It was as real, as irresistible, as a physical sensation. And he thought Felipa Cabot the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. \"She should be done in a heroic bronze,\" he told himself; \"but as I can\u0027t do it, and as I haven\u0027t the right to so much as think about her, I shall be considerably happier at a distance, so I\u0027ll go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He went the next day but one, riding out of the post at daylight. And he saw Felipa once more. She was standing by the creek, drawing an arrow from her quiver and fitting it to her bow. Then she poised the[Pg 32] toe of her left foot lightly upon the ground, bent back, and drew the bow almost to a semicircle. The arrow flew straight up into the shimmering air, straight through the body of a little jay, which came whirling, spinning down among the trees. Felipa gave a quick leap of delight at having made such a shot, then she darted down in search of the bird. And Cairness rode on. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100/59600.html","bookId":522,"book":{"id":522,"title":"The heritage of unrest","description":"简介： It is one thing to be sacrificed to a cause, even if it is only by filling up the ditch that others may cross to victory; it is quite another to be sacrificed in a cause, to die unavailingly without profit or glory of any kind, to be even an obstacle...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
