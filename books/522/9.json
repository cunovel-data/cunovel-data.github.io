{"id":32806,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Six years of fighting, of bloodshed, of heavy loss in blood and treasure to the government, the careers of the incarnate devils Juh, Victorio, and Geronimo—all the evils let loose on the southwest from \u002778 to \u002785 were traceable primarily to the selling of bad whiskey to a hunting party of Chiricahuas by two storekeepers, greedy of gain. \n \n Of course there were complications following, a long and involved list of them. Of course the Indians only sought the excuse, and very probably would have made it if it had not been made for them. And of course the Interior Department bungled under the guidance of politicians, of whom the best that possibly can be said is that they were stupid tools of corrupt men in the territories, who were willing to turn the blood of innocent settlers into gold for their own pockets. \n \n And still, those who hated the Apache most—officers who had fought them for years, who were laboring under no illusions whatever; the Commanders of the Department of Arizona and of the Division of the Missouri—reported officially that Victorio and his people had been unjustly dealt with. And these were men, too, who had publicly expressed, time and again, their opinion that the Apaches were idle and worthless [Pg 103]vagabonds, utterly hopeless, squalid, untrustworthy; robbers and thieves by nature. They had none of Crook\u0027s so many times unjustified faith in the red savage,—that faith which, wantonly betrayed, brought him to defeat and bitter disappointment at the last. Since Crook had gone to the northern plains, in the spring of \u002775, the unrest among the Apaches had been steadily growing, until five years later it was beyond control, and there began the half decade which opened with Victorio on the war-path, and closed with the closing of the career of the unfortunate general—most luckless example of the failing of failure—and the subjection of Geronimo. \n \n The never ending changes of the service, which permitted no man to remain in one spot for more than two years at the utmost limit, had sent Landor\u0027s troop back to Grant, and it was from there that he was ordered out at the beginning of the summer. \n \n The curtain-raiser to the tragedy about to come upon the boards was a little comedy. \n \n One fine afternoon the post was moving along in its usual routine—that quiet which is only disturbed by the ever recurring military formalities and the small squabbles of an isolated community. There had been a lull in the war rumors, and hope for the best had sprung up in the wearied hearts of the plains service, much as the sun had that day come out in a scintillating air after an all-night rain-storm. \n \n Mrs. Landor sat on the top step of her porch. Landor was with her, also his second lieutenant Ellton, and[Pg 104] Brewster, who in the course of events had come into the troop. There had been, largely by Felipa\u0027s advice, an unspoken agreement to let the past be. A troop divided against itself cannot stand well on the inspector general\u0027s reports. And as Brewster was about to marry the commanding officer\u0027s daughter, it was well to give him the benefit of the doubt of his entire sanity when he had been under the influence of what had been a real, if short-lived, passion for Felipa. They were all discussing the feasibility of getting up an impromptu picnic to the foot-hills. \n \n \"Miss McLane will go, I suppose?\" asked Felipa. \n \n Brewster answered that she would, of course. He was rather annoyingly proprietary and sure of her. \n \n \"But you have no Jill,\" she said, smiling at Ellton. His own smile was very strained, but she did not see that, nor the shade of trouble in his nice blue eyes. \n \n There fell a moment\u0027s pause. And it was broken by the sound of clashing as of many cymbals, the clatter of hoofs, the rattle of bouncing wheels, and around the corner of the line there came tearing a wagon loaded with milk tins. A wild-eyed man, hatless, with his hair on end, lashed his ponies furiously and drew up all of a heap, in front of the commanding officer\u0027s quarters. \n \n Landor and his lieutenant jumped up and ran down the walk. \"What\u0027s all this, Dutchy?\" they asked. \n \n Dutchy was a little German, who kept a milk ranch some seven miles from the post. \"Apachees, Apachees,\" he squealed, gasping for breath. \n \n [Pg 105] \n \n \"Where?\" the commandant asked. \n \n \"I see dem pass by my ranch. Dey weel run off all my stock, seexty of dem, a hundred mebee. I come queek to tell you.\" \n \n \"You came quick all right enough,\" said Landor, looking at the lathered broncos. But Major McLane was inquiring, and the result of his inquiries was that two troops were hurried in hot pursuit. \n \n The post was tremendously excited. As the cavalry trotted off up the slope toward the foot-hills, the men left behind went to the back of the post and watched, women looked through field-glasses, from the upper windows, children balanced upon the fences of the back yards, and Chinese cooks scrambled to the top of chicken coops and woodsheds, shading their eyes with their hands and peering in the direction of the gap. Dogs barked and hens cackled and women called back and forth. Down at the sutler\u0027s store the German was being comforted with beer at a dollar a bottle. \n \n In the storm-cleared atmosphere the troops could be seen until they turned into the gap, and shortly thereafter they reappeared, coming back at a trot. \n \n The milk ranch and the stock were unhurt, and there were not even any Indian signs. It was simply another example, on the milkman\u0027s part, of the perfection to which the imagination of the frontier settler could be cultivated. \n \n \"I see him, I see him all the same,\" he protested, with tears and evident conviction. \n \n \"I guess not,\" said Landor, tolerantly, as he turned[Pg 106] his horse over to his orderly; \"but, anyway,\" he added to Ellton, \"we had a picnic—of a sort.\" \n \n And before the next morning the picnic that kept the southwest interested for five years had begun. Victorio and two hundred hostiles had left the Mescalero Agency for good and all, killing, burning, torturing, and destroying as they went, and troops from all the garrisons were sent out post haste. \n \n At noon Landor got his orders. He was to leave at four o\u0027clock, and when he told Felipa she planned for dinner at three, with her usual manner of making all things as pleasant as possible, and indulging in no vain and profitless regrets. \"We may as well have Mr. Brewster and Nellie McLane, too,\" she decided, and went off in search of them, bareheaded and dancing with excitement. She dearly loved rumors of war. The prospect of a scout was always inspiriting to her. \n \n Ellton messed with them regularly, but he was not to go out, because he was acting adjutant. To his intense disgust and considerable mortification—for he was young and very enthusiastic and burdened with ideals—he was obliged to appear spick and span in irreproachable undress, beside his superiors in their campaign clothes. \n \n \"They\u0027re out from Apache, two troops under Kimball and Dutton; Morris has a band of scouts, Bayard has sent two troops, Wingate one. Oh! it\u0027s going to be grim-visaged war and all that, this time, sure,\" Brewster prophesied. \n \n Ellton could not eat. He bewailed his hard fate unceasingly. \n \n [Pg 107] \n \n \"Shut up,\" said Brewster, with malicious glee. \"They also serve who only stand and wait, you know,\" he chuckled. \"You can serve your admiring and grateful country quite as well in the adjutant\u0027s office as summering on the verdant heights of the Mogollons.\" \n \n Ellton retaliated with more spirit. \"Or guarding a water hole on the border for two or three months, and that\u0027s quite as likely to be your fate.\" \n \n \"True, too,\" Brewster admitted perforce. \n \n \"I\u0027ve been talking to a fellow down at the Q. M. corral,\" Landor said, \"Englishman named Cairness,—Charley Cairness. He\u0027s going as a scout. He can\u0027t resist war\u0027s alarms. He used to be in my troop a few years ago, and he was a first-rate soldier—knew his place a good deal better than if he had been born to it, which he very obviously wasn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Squaw-man, isn\u0027t he?\" Brewster asked. \n \n Landor shrugged his shoulder, but Felipa would not have it so. \"You know he is not, Jack,\" she said a little petulantly, which was noticeably unwonted on her part. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know anything whatever about it,\" he answered; \"that is none of my affair. I should be surprised if he were, and I must say I am inclined to think he is not.\" \n \n \"I know he is not,\" she said decisively. \n \n \"I beg pardon,\" said Brewster, pointedly, accentuating the slight awkwardness. \n \n But Landor was not aware that there was any. \"Cairness is a very decent sort of a fellow,\" he said[Pg 108] good-humoredly. \"And, personally, I am indebted to him for having saved Mrs. Landor\u0027s life up Black River way.\" \n \n Ellton filled in the pause that threatened, with a return to the dominant topic. \"This not having any pack-train,\" he opined, \"is the very deuce and all. The only transportation the Q. M. can give you is a six-mule team, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"Yes; but it happens to be enough for the next few weeks. We are going to camp around San Tomaso to afford the settlers protection. We can\u0027t follow any trails, those are our orders, so the pack-train doesn\u0027t matter anyway. By that time they will have scared up one.\" \n \n As they came out from dinner the orderlies had the horses at the door. Landor gave his wife parting instructions the while Brewster took an ostentatiously affectionate farewell of Miss McLane, who was herself neither so affectionate nor so sorrowful as she might have been expected to be. The adjutant watched them, furtively and unhappily. Felipa herself was not as unmoved as usual. \n \n When Landor had trotted off, and she and the girl were left alone, she went into the house and came back with a pair of field-glasses. Through them she could see her husband riding at the head of the column, along the road, and another figure beside him, mounted on a bony little pinto bronco. \n \n So he was near her again. She had not seen him in many months, but she had felt that he must be always,[Pg 109] as he had been through those days in the fastnesses of the Sierra Blanca, following her afar off, yet near enough to warn her, if need arose. She was too superstitious to watch him out of sight, and she turned back into the house, followed by Miss McLane, just as stable call sounded, and the white-clad soldiers tramped off to the corrals. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100/59606.html","bookId":522,"book":{"id":522,"title":"The heritage of unrest","description":"简介： It is one thing to be sacrificed to a cause, even if it is only by filling up the ditch that others may cross to victory; it is quite another to be sacrificed in a cause, to die unavailingly without profit or glory of any kind, to be even an obstacle...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2100","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
