In a completely uncharacteristic move, she has put aside her misgivings and agreed to live with the enigmatic billionaire.

Amidst the ever mounting threat of a monster who wants Bianca dead, and the constant pitfalls of an indiscreet past that James can’t seem to escape, can these two passionate lovers manage to find their happily ever after?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/grounded-up-in-the-air-3.jpg","author":"R.K.
