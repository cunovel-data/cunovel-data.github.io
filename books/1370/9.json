{"id":37325,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"As A yachtsman Mr. Cornelius Blunn did not shine sartorially. As a guest and conversationalist at Grant’s improvised cruise on the following day he was easily the most popular man on board. Susan, who had been his neighbour at lunch, watched him pacing the deck, with a look almost of affection in her face. “Princess,” she confided to Gertrude, “I think your friend, Mr. Blunn, is the most amusing man I’ve ever met.” Gertrude smiled. “He is one of those impossible persons who never grow up,” she declared. “A picnic like this is the joy of his life. He was simply delighted when I gave him Mr. Slattery’s message. The strange part of it is that he can scarcely cross the gangway of a steamer without being violently ill. Yet a cruise like this he simply revels in.” “Make his fortune as a raconteur on the music-hall stage,” Bobby Lancaster chuckled. “Some of the stories he told after you girls had come up on deck!—there was one about a little Dutch girl. I really must—” “Bobby,” Susan interrupted severely, “I am ashamed of you. The story will reach us all in due course through the proper channels. You will tell your sister, of course. She will tell me. And so on.” “Then there was another about an Italian maid.” His sister rose to her feet and thrust her arm through his. “Bobby,” she said, “you and I will take a little walk. You have brought this upon yourself. I can’t see you chuckling there and leaving me to wonder what it’s about all the time. We’ll stroll down to the bows.” “This roundabout business is trying but decent,” Susan observed. “I suppose I shall have to wait at least another quarter of an hour. In the meantime, Mr. Slattery, I adore your yacht.” “She really is wonderful, Grant,” Gertrude intervened. “You hadn’t anything like this in the old days, had you?” “Perhaps it was as well,” Susan murmured, with a rare impulse of ill humour. Gertrude smiled across at her rival. Grant had scarcely left her side all day and she was beginning to feel a little sorry for this very charming young English girl to whom her coming was likely to prove so disastrous. Even the picnic had been arranged at her suggestion. “Well, the yacht has arrived, and other things,” she remarked. “It is never too late in this world, so long as one has the will. Grant, I want to go to the Dutch East Indies.” “I’d better tell him to put in at Naples and coal, then,” he suggested. “You will kindly remember,” Susan observed, “that you have the Prime Minister of the greatest empire in the world on board, who will be required at Nice at a quarter to eleven to-morrow morning to preside over the little tea party there.” “That is unfortunate,” Gertrude sighed. “Such a quarrelsome little tea party too, isn’t it?” Lymane, who was seated in the little circle, moved in his chair uneasily. Grant turned slightly towards her. “Quarrelsome, is it?” he repeated. “How do you know that?” “Oh, the air is full of rumours,” she answered carelessly. “Yesterday, for instance, everybody was saying that that poor dear Baron Naga had committed suicide because America was to be invited once more to come into the Pact.” “I thought it was because he found he had one funnel too many on his latest cruiser,” Bobby Lancaster remarked. “Idiot!” his sister exclaimed. “That’s the business of the Limitation of Armaments Congress, not the Pact.” “Naga, as a matter of fact, represented his country on both Boards,” Lymane pointed out. “Too much for one man. I know that he dreaded that journey to Washington every year.” The stewards appeared with tea. Lord Yeovil and Cornelius Blunn joined the little group. The latter removed his hat, dragged his chair out to where he could set the full benefit of the sunlight and the breeze, and smiled on every one beatifically. “Mr. Slattery,” he said, “you are, without exception, the most fortunate man in the world. You own the most perfect yacht I have ever seen, you have no business or other cares, you have the friends who make a man happy. It is a wonderful existence.” Grant smiled. “Rather a lazy one, I am afraid,” he admitted. “Laziness is the only sound philosophy of life,” Blunn insisted. “If you have no need to work for yourself, why do it? If you spend your time working for others, you meet with nothing but ingratitude. I grudge the time I have to give to the management of my own affairs, but I am always deeply grateful that I was never tempted to dabble in politics. I am training up young men, and in five years’ time I shall be free from all cares. When that time comes, I shall be like a lizard in the sun of good fortune. I will never write a letter and seldom read a newspaper.” “I thought that all Germans were politicians by instinct, from their cradles upwards,” Lord Yeovil remarked, smiling. “Not in these days,” Blunn replied, helping himself to his third cake. “My father, of course, was a rabid politician, but he lived in terrible times. A prosperous Germany is so much to the good, of course, but her sons naturally lack the inspiration of what used to be known as patriotism. The fact of it is,” he went on, “that industrially Germany has come in for a great heritage. If she had been as prosperous in nineteen-fourteen as she is today, that wicked old Kaiser of ours might have rattled his sabre forever and no one would have listened. What people have often failed to understand about my country is that we are not seekers after glory. We want money and the ease and comfort and happy days that money brings.” “You don’t think that Germany wants another war, then?” Bobby Lancaster asked. “My dear young man,” Blunn assured him emphatically, “there isn’t a leader living or a cause in existence which could induce the German of to-day to exchange the loom for the sword. There isn’t a nation which rejoices so thoroughly in the Pact. I thought that this was absolutely understood by now. Even the English sensationalists have begun to trust us.” He smiled around upon them all. Somehow or other he seemed to feel the inspiration of the circle of interested auditors. “There is only one thing needed,” he continued, “which my friends the politicians tell me would end the last hopes of the militarists, and that is that the Pact of Nations, over which my honoured friend here, Lord Yeovil, so ably presides, should induce the United States of America to join them and abandon forever her present aloofness. I do not understand myself the means by which this could be done or the etiquette necessary, but as a representative German citizen, my hand of comradeship is ready at any moment.” “I wonder,” Lord Yeovil speculated, “whether you really do speak as a representative German citizen.” “Believe me, I do,” was the earnest reply. “My simple tastes in life are shared by millions. What the German of to-day wants is his beer, his wine, his music and his womankind. He wants to spend his spare time with his children and to be able to buy his little home early in life. I am not a great traveller; I don’t know how it is with other nations. I know how it is with my own. We want to live out our days comfortably and pleasantly. We are natural human beings, filled with natural desires. I have eaten too many cakes. I shall walk for a little time or I shall have no appetite for this wonderful dinner, which our gracious host has promised us. Princess, will you do me the honour?” Gertrude rose from her place. “I am not a great walker, Mr. Blunn,” she warned him, “but for ten minutes I will be your companion.” “That ten minutes,” he rejoined, “will be the crown of my day.” They all looked after him a little curiously as he stepped out upon his promenade. Lord Yeovil was very much interested. “I am delighted. Grant,” he said to Slattery, “that you have given me an opportunity, through your friend the Princess von Diss, of meeting Mr. Blunn. I find him an extraordinary intriguing personality.” “For a multimillionaire he seems to be a very simple creature,” Rose Lancaster observed. “‘Multi’ is inadequate,” Grant interposed. “He is reputed to be worth anything from forty to sixty million pounds. It is hard to see how any one could have handled such wealth and have remained so apparendy ingenuous.” “Do you distrust him?” Susan asked a little bluntly. Grant hesitated. He seemed to be watching Gertrude and Blunn as they walked together,—Gertrude superbly beautiful, walking with the perfect grace of her long limbs and exquisite poise, Blunn striding along cheerfully by her side, a figure, by contrast, almost of absurdity. “Well, I don’t know,” he acknowledged. “You remember what our own Ambassador said many years ago. ‘Trust everybody but a German, and trust a German when he is dead.’” Lord Yeovil smiled. “Nevertheless, Grant,” he confessed, “I have a leaning towards Mr. Blunn. I am almost sorry that he is not a politician. I would rather have him seated at the Conference table than our friend Lutrecht. What about a rubber of bridge until cocktail time? We can play on deck.” Blunn stopped short in his promenade. “Bridge?” he repeated, with a broad smile. “Did I hear some one say anything about bridge?” “Mr. Blunn is a fanatic,” Gertrude declared. “Grant, you will have to come and entertain me, unless you are very anxious to play.” He rose at once to his feet and gave an order to the steward whom he had summoned. “I will show you the chart room,” he suggested. “There are plenty to play without me.” They strolled off together. Susan sat watching them with interlaced fingers. Suddenly she became aware that Blunn’s eyes were upon her. “Lady Susan and I against any two,” he proposed jovially. “Take me out if I double ‘no trumps’ with your best suit, partner. Discard from weakness. Always support me when you can, and we’ll win all the money there is on the yacht. Between ourselves, I have a yacht almost as large as this, lying up in Kiel Harbour even now. I daren’t use her because of the socialists.” “Socialists!” Lord Yeovil repeated. “One never hears of them nowadays.” “They’ve all come to Germany,” Blunn confided. “They are like mice,—they always go for the ripening cheese. They are just a slur upon our too great prosperity. One ‘no trump,’ partner. I knew it. You have brought me luck. I am going to hold every card in the pack.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1449/43559.html","bookId":1370,"book":{"id":1370,"title":"The Wrath to Come","description":"简介： It is a passage which might well be haunted with memories of the famous courtesans, dignitaries, criminals de luxe and aristocrats of the world,the long straight stretch of passage leading from the Hotel de Paris to the International Sporting Club of...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1449","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:56 AM"}}
