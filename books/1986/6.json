She did that a lot when she was nervous. \"I am so sorry I walked in on that Marcus. I feel like an idiot,\" she began explaining as soon as I made it to Jax Stone\u0027s Hummer.\\n\\n \"No worries,\" which wasn\u0027t exactly the truth. Sadie walking in on me about to kiss Will ow had screwed with my head a little. Sadie had wrapped me so tightly around her finger not too long ago I\u0027d expected to feel something when I turned around and saw her standing there with Will ow\u0027s warm body pressed against my back. But I hadn\u0027t. Nothing. No ache at the sight of her. Absolutely nothing. Righteous anger at my father and the hell he was putting my mom and sister through, yes, I\u0027d felt that. Worry for Amanda, yes, I\u0027d felt that. But nothing for Sadie. My immediate response was to protect Will ow. Not sure what I was protecting her from but none the less that had been my goal.\\n\\n Sadie opened the door and Amanda sat curled up in the corner sniffling like a little girl. My heart broke. It was like I\u0027d stepped back in time and the little sister I loved and protected needed me to fight off the monsters under her bed again. But this time the damn monster was our father.\\n\\n He was ripping us apart for a twenty year old whore. Or however old she was. She was young. That\u0027s all I knew.\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t come home last night and Mama won\u0027t come out of her room. She\u0027s screaming and packing her things.\\n\\n She\u0027s running away.\" A choked sob escaped her and she buried her face in her hands again. My spoiled sweet little sister hadn\u0027t ever had to deal with life\u0027s shit. She\u0027d been given everything she wanted. Her life had been cake and ice cream, until now.\\n\\n \"Come on baby, I\u0027m going to talk to Mama and I\u0027ll get her calmed down. She isn\u0027t going to run away. I promise.\"\\n\\n \"She can stay with me if you need her too. We\u0027ve already missed an hour of school. Might as well make it a day.\" I glanced over at Sadie and nodded. That was probably a good idea. What I had to say to Mama probably didn\u0027t need to be heard by Amanda.\\n\\n \"You want to stay with Sadie while I go handle Mama?\" She nodded slowly looking up at me with a tear streaked face.\\n\\n I leaned inside and hugged her, \"It\u0027s going to be okay sis.\\n\\n I\u0027m here and no matter what, I will fix this mess.\"\\n\\n \"K,\" she muttered against my chest.\\n\\n I knew I was making a promise I might not be able to keep but I said it anyway.\\n\\n \"Thanks Sadie,\" I said letting go of Amanda and stepping back so she could climb inside the Hummer. Jax supplied a Hummer and a chauffeur for Sadie complete with black privacy windows. Since the world found out Sadie White was Jax Stone\u0027s girlfriend she\u0027d become a celebrity.\\n\\n Paparazzi actually came to Alabama to get pictures of her.\\n\\n People treated her differently when she went out in public.\\n\\n Jax didn\u0027t like being away from her and left her with several things that made him feel she was safe. The Hummer and chauffeur/body guard was just two of them. Why the dude didn\u0027t just get her a private tutor and take her with him was beyond me. Something about not wanting to take away her high school experience or some crazy shit. Only from a guy who never lived through high school would feel like he was robbing someone of the experience. Sadie would leave in a heartbeat if he\u0027d let her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad I can help. Anything y\u0027all need from me, I\u0027m more than willing to help out. I hate this is happening. Amanda\u0027s tears are breaking my heart.\"\\n\\n Sweet, kind Sadie. I expected nothing less. One of the reasons I fell head over heels for her after only minutes in her presence last summer. She was gorgeous sure but the girl was a sweetheart. However, I had to admit standing here talking to her and feeling nothing but gratitude was pretty damn freeing.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an awesome friend Sadie,\" I said nodding and then left as she climbed inside beside my sister.\\n\\n I needed to go deal with my mother.\\n\\n The Mercedes CLS63 my dad had given my mother as an anniversary present four months ago was still sitting in the garage. This was a good thing. She hadn\u0027t taken flight yet. I headed inside the three story beach front stucco home I\u0027d lived in my entire life. \"Mom,\" I called out as I headed for the stairs leading to her room.\\n\\n \"Marcus,\" she called back followed by a loud wail. The little boy in me took off running up the stairs scared of what I might find. She was my Mom. I didn\u0027t want her hurt. As my foot hit the top stair she flung herself out of her bedroom and threw herself into my arms.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re here,\" she sobbed out.\\n\\n I stroked her blond hair gently hoping to calm her down.\\n\\n How many times had she held me while I cried in her arms?\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t even begin to count. Now, here I stood holding her.\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t come home last night,\" she sobbed, \"he didn\u0027t even call.\"\\n\\n I hated him. At this moment with my mother sobbing pitifully in my arms I knew I hated him. I didn\u0027t just hate what he was doing. I truly hated my father.\\n\\n \"I know. Manda told me. Come with me. Let\u0027s get you a wet wash cloth for your face and clean you up a little.\" She nodded against my chest and relaxed the death like grip she\u0027d had on me.\\n\\n \"Go sit down on the sofa Mama. I\u0027ll get you a cool wash cloth then we can talk about this and what we need to do.\\n\\n Okay,\" she let out another sob.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here Mama. I won\u0027t leave you. I\u0027m going to fix everything. You just trust me okay.\"\\n\\n A small smile of relief mixed with misery tugged on her lips.\\n\\n The pain in her eyes however didn\u0027t lessen.\\n\\n I was going to kill him. With my bare hands. I was going to kill my father. And God help me if that slut that works for him ever comes near me. I can still remember that flirtatious smile she shot me when I\u0027d gone into his office that day.\\n\\n She was a gold digger. And my dad was a sucker. A selfish sucker.\\n\\n \"I called his cell phone this morning and he answered. Said he was at work and would deal with me later,\" she let out a choked laugh, \"Deal with me Marcus. Like I\u0027m a problem.\\n\\n I\u0027m his wife. His Wife.\"\\n\\n I sat down beside her and used the wash cloth to clean her tear streaked face.\\n\\n \"Just don\u0027t call him anymore. I\u0027m going to go talk to him. I want him out of this house Mama.\"\\n\\n She sniffed sitting still while I washed her face as if she were the child.\\n\\n \"You think I should divorce him?\"\\n\\n \"Yes Mama, I do. He\u0027s sleeping with someone else. He doesn\u0027t deserve you. You\u0027re better than that.\" She nodded and reached up to grab my wrist and pulled my hand to her mouth and kissed it. \"I love you Marcus Hardy. You\u0027re my good boy. Always taking care of me and your sister. You\u0027re nothing like your daddy. You know that don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n There was my Mom. Even if it was for a brief moment I needed that little bit of motherly affection. Knowing she was still in there under all this hurt and pain eased my fear still in there under all this hurt and pain eased my fear some.\\n\\n \"I know that,\" I assured her allowing her to take the wash cloth from my hand so she could wipe her nose.\\n\\n \"God Marcus how did this happen? Where did it all go wrong?\" she asked in a defeated tone dropping her hands into her lap.\\n\\n \"The minute Dad lost his mind I guess. I\u0027m going to go talk to him. Don\u0027t wait up for him tonight Mama. I\u0027m going to tell him I\u0027ll bring him his clothes but I don\u0027t want him back on the property.\"\\n\\n \"Oh honey is that the best idea? What if he realizes this was a mistake? Do I really just end twenty five years of marriage over this?\"\\n\\n \"Yes Mama you do! The bastard cheated on you. He is cheating on you. You\u0027re so much better than that Mama.\\n\\n Don\u0027t you let him win. Don\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n I hated seeing her this way. She really thought Dad would change his mind and come back to her. Maybe he would when his little girlfriend left him or began to get on his nerves. But then there would be another one just like her somewhere waiting to take her place.\\n\\n \"Mama, listen,\" I pleaded taking her cold soft hands in mine,\\n\\n \"You need to divorce him. Take everything you possibly can by law. Clean him dry. Do you hear me? He is using his money on that slut. Get what he owes you and he owes you everything Mama.\"\\n\\n She straightened up and nodded her head in agreement.\\n\\n Thank God I\u0027d gotten through to her.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right honey. I need to make him pay.\" Good. I could see the revenge flashing in her eyes. At least it wasn\u0027t pain. Let her be mad as hell. Let her suck him dry.\\n\\n That\u0027s the tough as nails woman who raised me. I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek, \"I love you Mama. We\u0027re going to get through this. You\u0027re not alone. Don\u0027t push Manda away either. She needs you right now. The two of you need to eat a gallon of Rocky Road ice cream and watch movies together. Bond over this Mama. Don\u0027t let him win.\"\\n\\n Standing up Mama reached out and squeezed my hand.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m stronger than this. My baby girl needs her Mama. As long as I have you to lean on I can do this Marcus.\"\\n\\n \"Well you\u0027ve got me. Now, why don\u0027t you get out of your pajamas and come make me some breakfast because I\u0027m starving.\"\\n\\n Hearing her laughter was music to my ears.\\n\\n Willow\\n\\n It was Spring Break season so the tourist had begun flooding Sea Breeze. Which was a good thing because tips were double their norm. I\u0027d already made two hundred dollars and that was mostly from the lunch crowd. The evening crowd was just beginning to pick up. On nights when the bar side of Live Bay has a relatively known band the restaurant suffers some. Families looking for a nice seafood restaurant are put off by the packed out parking lot. They don\u0027t realize it\u0027s for the bar side. Tonight however crowds were low at the bar so the restaurant was hopping with tourists.\\n\\n \"Low, can you take a four top in section C for Macy? She said she can\u0027t handle any more in her section. That twelve top party is consuming her.\"\\n\\n I nodded my head at Kim, the hostess for the evening and went to grab some waters and a bowl of lemons before heading to their table.\\n\\n \"Hey you still looking for someone to close for you?\" she asked me as I turned to walk away. I glanced back at her,\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n She pointed to Seth, a waiter who I knew she\u0027d been seeing lately. She must want him to work late with her tonight.\\n\\n Giving her a knowing smile I headed over to intercept Seth on his way to the kitchen.\\n\\n \"Hey, you want to close tonight? I\u0027ve got to keep my niece and I need someone to close for me.\"\\n\\n Seth glanced back over his shoulder toward Kim.\\n\\n Apparently he was looking for her approval before answering. His gaze shifted back to me and he grinned.\\n\\n \"Sure. No problem.\" His obvious enthusiasm had me biting back a laugh. No doubt he was already planning his evening alone with Kim in a big empty restaurant.\\n\\n \"Hey, isn\u0027t that the lead singer of Jackdown?\" Seth asked I looked over and sure enough sitting at my four top in section C was Krit, Trisha, Rock and Green.\\n\\n \"Yep and the bassist too.\"\\n\\n \"Switch with me please,\" Seth begged.\\n\\n I glanced back at the table and Trisha waved. I couldn\u0027t do that to her.\\n\\n \"I would Seth but Trisha and Rock are my friends. I can\u0027t.\" Seth\u0027s eyes widened, \"You know Krit then?\"\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n \"Well then can you at least introduce me. I\u0027ve been wanting to audition for Jackdown for forever but they\u0027re never looking for anyone new.\"\\n\\n He was helping me out tonight so I really owed it to him.\\n\\n Even though he would no doubt be getting lucky back in the stock room tonight with Kim.\\n\\n \"Sure, stop by after I\u0027ve got their orders and I\u0027ll introduce you.\"\\n\\n Carrying a tray full of waters, I headed back to my newest table.\\n\\n \"Hey girl, hate you left early last night. You missed the last song. Krit wrote it and it was amazing,\" Trisha said smiling up at me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. It was just once I got outside in the clean air I couldn\u0027t bring myself to go back inside into that crowd.\" Not to mention I didn\u0027t want to see Marcus dancing with Jess.\\n\\n \"You broke my heart. I was looking forward to the end of my set so I could come find you. The boots and mini skirt were hot Low, you were killing me.\"\\n\\n \"She had on a mini skirt and boots? How, exactly, did I miss this?\" Green asked looking from me to Krit.\\n\\n I laughed and pulled out my order pad.\\n\\n \"What can I get y\u0027all to drink?\" I asked changing the subject.\\n\\n \"Bud on tap,\" Rock replied\\n\\n \"Diet Coke.\"\\n\\n \"Miller Light long neck.\"\\n\\n \"Sweet Tea.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t twenty-one so I couldn\u0027t serve alcohol. This would be the perfect reason to get Seth to the table.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have Seth bring y\u0027all your beers since I\u0027m not old enough to serve you. But be prepared he\u0027s a huge Jackdown fan and really wants to meet y\u0027all.\"\\n\\n Krit leaned forward and bit his bottom lip while staring me down. He really did think his sex appeal worked on everyone.\\n\\n \"What time do you get off Low?\" he asked in a husky voice.\\n\\n \"Ah shit he\u0027s already using his fuck me voice on her. Run Low before he starts the winking and dimple flashing.\" Green warned, then gave Krit a playful punch in the arm when everyone at the table burst into laughter.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go get the other drinks,\" I said smiling as I turned back toward the kitchen.\\n\\n Seth was at the soda fountain filling up two glasses.\\n\\n \"Alright I need a Bud on tap and a Miller long neck delivered to the table. The Miller is Krit\u0027s. Enjoy.\"\\n\\n \"Awesome Low thanks,\" Seth rushed off leaving the sodas behind.\\n\\n Krit\u0027s flirting proceeded throughout the meal but I was use to flirtatious customers so it didn\u0027t bother me. When I knew they were getting to the end of their meal I printed out their check and started to make my way over to them. But before I could take another step the front door opened and I halted.\\n\\n The small audible gasp that escaped me luckily went unnoticed since no one was close enough to hear it.\\n\\n Walking into the door was a very gorgeous and very determined looking Marcus Hardy. His blond hair was short enough it didn\u0027t require much brushing and although he pulled off the just got out of bed style with ease, tonight his hair had been paid attention to. The short blond locks were neatly in place with the front flipped up just barely. The jeans rode low on his hips hugging them in just the right spot and the pale green polo he had on made his green eyes stand out even more under his heavy eyelashes.\\n\\n He nodded at Kim but kept his eyes on me as he headed directly to where I stood frozen in place.\\n\\n directly to where I stood frozen in place.\\n\\n \"I heard you needed a ride tonight,\" he said with a pleased expression on his face.\\n\\n \"I do, um, but how did you know?\" The twinkle in his eyes made me feel warm all over.\\n\\n \"I have my sources. Didn\u0027t want you walking or being stranded so I thought I\u0027d come grab a drink and wait until you\u0027re ready to go.\"\\n\\n I had planned on walking to my sister\u0027s. Cage had a game tonight and I hadn\u0027t wanted to ask him to let me borrow his car.\\n\\n \"Well, okay, um, thank you. Rock\u0027s here,\" I said trying to process the fact Marcus had just shown up to take me to my sister\u0027s after work as if this was normal behavior.\\n\\n He followed my gaze, \" I see that. I\u0027ll go say hello to them.\\n\\n Take your time. I have nowhere to be. I\u0027ve got all night.\" With one last long look directed at me he turned and walked to the table I\u0027d been heading to before he walked in.\\n\\n How the heck had he known I needed a ride? And furthermore why would he come to give me one without me asking him?\\n\\n Shaking my head in confusion I followed him to the table.\\n\\n \"Marcus, man you missed the meal,\" Rock teased.\\n\\n \"Yeah I can see that but I\u0027m here for Low not you.\" Krit glanced past Marcus and locked eyes with me. His blond eyebrows shot up in question at Marcus\u0027s comment.\\n\\n \"You taking Low somewhere Marcus?\" Krit asked tearing his gaze off me and staring back up at Marcus.\\n\\n This might get more interesting than was good. I\u0027d been dodging Krit\u0027s advances for almost a year. The boy didn\u0027t take \"no\" for an answer.\\n\\n \"Yep, you got a problem with that?\" Marcus asked pulling up a chair and sitting down beside Green.\\n\\n \"I guess I do. I\u0027d been hoping to convince her to go out with me when she got off work tonight. Kinda screws that up if you\u0027re here for her.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help but watch Marcus\u0027s face to see how he reacted to Krit\u0027s explanation. He scowled and leaned back in the chair.\\n\\n \"No I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea Krit. You aren\u0027t Low\u0027s type.\"\\n\\n \"And you are?\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t bring myself to walk completely up to the table.\\n\\n This was as embarrassing as it was fascinating.\\n\\n \"Alright boys calm down,\" Rock interrupted them and waved me over.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m gonna pay for this meal and Krit you\u0027re going to leave with us. Low has plans tonight to leave with Marcus. You two can argue this out or beat the shit out of each other whatever, some other time. Right now I want to get home and spend some time with my girl, alone.\" Marcus looked entirely too pleased with everything. If he wasn\u0027t so darn cute I\u0027d remind him I wasn\u0027t some piece of property he owned. Heck we hadn\u0027t even been out on a date and here he is acting like he has some claim on me.\\n\\n His eyes lifted and locked with mine. All the reasons I had to be aggravated with him vanished. Who could stay mad at that face? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-6.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.

But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus.

Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution.
