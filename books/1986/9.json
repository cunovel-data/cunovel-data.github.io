Seeing her sitting there beside Sadie I realized how much sexier Will ow was.\n All that copper hair and fair skin and curves. Damn the girl had curves. Really, really nice curves.\n \"More like gorgeous,\" I replied backing the truck out into the street.\n \"That\u0027s what Sadie said. She was really happy about Low.\n She seems happy for you. I think she worried you were still pining away for her.\"\n I\u0027d stopped pining for Sadie awhile back. My attraction to Will ow only proved that.\n \"I mean I know Cage is a total male whore but Preston said he was like real protective of Low and then there is that little issue about his claim that he\u0027s going to marry her one day.\" I gripped the steering wheel tightly trying to control the violent reaction that reminder caused. There was no way in hell Will ow was going to marry Cage. I wasn\u0027t ready to propose marriage to her or anything. We were just in the beginning stages of a relationship. But I knew she was better than Cage York. Sure he was good to her but he reminded me of a big brother. He treated Will ow the way I treated Amanda. Will ow deserved so much more in life than that. She was smart, funny, real, so incredibly sexy, she wasn\u0027t someone\u0027s standby dammit.\n \"Your knuckles are turning white,\" Amanda chirped.\n I relaxed my tight grip and took a deep breath.\n \"Cage is a little confused about things. Low will never marry him. She\u0027ll tell you so herself. She\u0027s special.\"\n \"Like Sadie was special?\"\n I thought about it a minute and then nodded.\n \"Yeah, like Sadie I guess. You don\u0027t come across girls like those two often. Trust me, I\u0027ve looked. They\u0027re definitely rare.\"\n \"Like I said before, this time you aren\u0027t up against a rock star. My money\u0027s on you.\"\n I grinned and reached over and squeezed her knee.\n \"So tell me about this car Dad\u0027s giving you.\" An immediate frown tugged the corners of her mouth down.\n \"My Jeep has all kinds of issues and Dad said that\u0027s what happens when you buy inferior automobiles,\" she rolled her eyes. \"Anyway, he\u0027s giving me some trade in he just got. A sports coupe or something. I think he said a 250CL...\n maybe. I don\u0027t know. But I need a car and I can\u0027t afford one on my own.\"\n Figures, Dad was putting her in a Mercedes. Let the world see the Mercedes King supplies his daughter with a car.\n He won\u0027t be getting my ass in a damn Mercedes. Nothing was wrong with my Chevy truck. It was paid for, by me.\n \"It\u0027ll be a safe car. If you end up going to Tuscaloosa in the fall then I\u0027ll feel good about you being on the road in a Mercedes coupe.\"\n Amanda fidgeted in her seat and cleared her throat. Uh oh.\n That was never good. Those were her nervous ticks.\n \"Um, about college. See, Jamie and Hannah are going to Auburn\"\n \"Ah no! Amanda please tell me you\u0027re joking.\"\n \"Let me finish Marcus, GAH!\"\n I did not want to hear this but I let her continue.\n \"Like I was saying before you went all \u0027Roll Tide Monster\u0027\n on me, Jamie and Hannah are going to Auburn. Jamie got a cheerleading scholarship and Hannah\u0027s daddy is an Auburn alum, and I want to be a veterinarian. You know I love animals. It\u0027s what I really want to do,\" this was not happening. Amanda shifted in her seat until she was turned toward me. \"If you weren\u0027t a die hard Alabama fan and someone asked you the best college in Alabama to go to if you wanted to be a veterinarian what would you tell them?\n Hmm?\"\n I let out a frustrated sigh, \"Auburn,\" I mumbled.\n \"Bingo! Which is why I applied there... and I got accepted.\" Well shit. My baby sister was going to freaking Auburn.\n \"I mean I could\u0027ve applied to an out of state college and moved off really far away.\"\n I shook my head, \"No, I wouldn\u0027t want that.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I thought. I\u0027ll secretly still cheer for Bama during the Iron Bowl every year, I promise.\"\n Shaking my head I decided to focus on that kiss with Low. It made me happy. My sister\u0027s choice in college did not.\n My dad was standing outside his dealership when we pulled up. He was tall and in shape with a few silver streaks in his brown hair. He was laughing all relaxed and happy looking. You couldn\u0027t tell by his jovial appearance that he was tearing his family apart. It didn\u0027t appear to be bothering him at all. Clenching my teeth tightly shut I kept my thoughts to myself. The last thing Amanda needed was to hear me vent about what a complete ass our father was.\n \"You getting out?\" She asked glancing back at me as she opened the truck door.\n I shook my head, \"I\u0027ll just see you in a few minutes at the house.\"\n \"Okay,\" the understanding in her eyes reminded me I wasn\u0027t alone in this. We were a team.\n She stepped out of the truck. My dad began walking my way. I debated spinning off before he could get to my truck window. But for Amanda\u0027s sake I didn\u0027t. I rolled down the window as he approached.\n \"Marcus, you\u0027re not getting out to see your sister\u0027s car?\" His question chaffed me. As if I didn\u0027t care about Amanda.\n \"I\u0027ll see it in a few minutes at my mother\u0027s house.\" That caught him off guard. He cleared his throat and shifted his feet.\n I continued to glare out the front window.\n \"The other day I wasn\u0027t prepared for your verbal attack. I may have said some things I shouldn\u0027t have. I apologize.\n But this is between your mother and I. You kids don\u0027t need to be caught in the middle. You\u0027re both almost grown.\" I jerked my head around and shot my glare directly at him.\n \"This will always affect me. My mother is falling apart. She\u0027s my mama. The woman who fed me soup when I was sick and held me while I threw up. She was the one who fixed my scraped knees and held me while I got stitches because I ripped my arm open. She read me stories until I fell asleep at night. You expect me to just not care that you\u0027re hurting her. Hell, you\u0027re killing her. My mother and my sister are the only two people in this world I\u0027d die for. I\u0027ll do anything I have to in order to make them happy. So NO\n Dad this isn\u0027t just between you and mom. When Mama cries, Amanda cries. Then I\u0027m the one who has to go pick up the pieces of this mess you\u0027ve created.\" I stopped ranting and took a deep breath because at the moment I really needed to hit something and my Dad\u0027s face was looking very appealing.\n \"I didn\u0027t realize your mother was sharing our personal problems with you. I\u0027ll speak with her about it.\" I jerked the truck door open and stood face to face with my father. Our noses were almost touching. My finger was shoved against his chest so hard I knew it had to hurt. \"You go near my mother and I will break every bone in your body old man. Do you understand me?\"\n My Dad\u0027s face was bright red. I could see the fury and surprise in his eyes. I\u0027d embarrassed him in front of his employees and if he said one more word one of those employees was going to need to call an ambulance for their boss.\n Turning away from him I jumped back in the truck and spun off leaving tire tracts on his nice paved car lot.\n Willow\n Was it possible that my lips were still tingling from Marcus\u0027s kiss hours later? Surely not. It had to all be in my head. I picked up the last spoon Larissa had used to play the drums on the pots and pans. Tawny had finally shown up to get her and acted like I was being an inconvenience asking her to pick up her daughter. But even my crazy sister couldn\u0027t bring me down off my high. The memory of Marcus\u0027s kiss and his words had me floating around on a cloud no one could knock me off of.\n Yawning I decided it was time to go take a nap with all these good thoughts to spur some really nice dreams.\n Glancing at Cage\u0027s bedroom door I paused. Should I go get in his bed? Did I want to? I turned and looked back at the couch. That\u0027s where I wanted to sleep. All my really good Marcus memories were in this room around or on that couch. Surely I\u0027d have Marcus dreams if I slept on it.\n Grabbing a pillow off Cage\u0027s bed and a blanket out of the closet I headed to the couch for some overdue sleep and hopefully very good dreams.\n Warm fingers ran through my hair then traced the side of my face down to my collar bone where they teased and caressed the sensitive skin there.\n \"Hmmm,\" I murmured snuggling closer to the warmth holding me. I was having a very good realistic Marcus dream. Strong hands returned to my hair and gently massaged my head. Oh I liked that. How did Marcus know to do that? Cage always massaged my head. He knew I had a weakness for it. Dang Cage was messing up my dream. This was supposed to be a \u0027Marcus only\u0027 dream.\n Before I could get too upset his hand found its way back down to my collar bone. He was driving me crazy. Just slip a hand under my shirt already. Please. I was ready to beg.\n When his hand started moving north again I whined,\n \"Marcus please.\"\n The hand froze. I opened my eyes and stared directly up into Cage\u0027s face.\n \"Did you just call me \u0027Marcus\u0027?\"\n Fantastic. What had I done? This was not the way I was going to handle the whole me and Marcus possibility with Cage. I rolled my eyes and sat up.\n \"Probably. I was dreaming Cage. I can\u0027t control what I say when I\u0027m asleep.\"\n Cage scowled, \"You were dreaming about Marcus?\" I shrugged.\n Cage groaned, \"Will ow, we talked about this. Baby he\u0027s so not like us. He dates rich babes his parents approve of. He doesn\u0027t slum it. Don\u0027t set yourself up to get hurt. Please,\" he pleaded.\n If anyone else had referred to dating me as slumming it I would have slapped them. But it was Cage who grew up next door to me. He lived my life. He was allowed. It was different coming from him.\n \"Again, it was a dream. I can\u0027t control it.\" Cage scooted over closing the distance between us.\n \"You\u0027re so dang cute when you sleep,\" he murmured leaning over to nip at my shoulder.\n \"Stop Cage. Don\u0027t start that. If you need to get laid go elsewhere.\"\n He dropped his head back against the couch, \"I just wanted a taste Low. You\u0027re killing me.\"\n I patted his leg, \"No you\u0027re just horny and I\u0027m just available.\" Cage chuckled, \"You think you\u0027ve got me all figured out don\u0027t ya love.\"\n \"I know I\u0027ve got you all figured out. You can\u0027t fool me Cage. I happen to know spiders scare you to death and you cry every time you watch Extreme Home Makeover. There is nothing about you I don\u0027t know.\"\n Cage wiggled his eyebrows at me, \"You think so?\" He leaned over until I could feel his warm breath tickle my ear.\n Surprisingly it didn\u0027t smell like whisky... yet.\n \"I beat off to thoughts of you naked spread out in my bed with that wild red hair of yours covering my pillow.\"\n \"UGH! Cage!\" I pushed him off me and stood up. \"TMI Cage. I so did not want to know that.\"\n Cage cackled with laughter. \"What, baby? You don\u0027t think about me when you slip your hands into your panties and get naughty?\"\n \"Cage SHUT UP!\" I screamed putting my fingers in my ears.\n He stuck his pointed finger in his mouth and licked it. I swear he could be so gross.\n \"Who do you think about Low? When you\u0027re making it feel good down there?\"\n I was getting ready to slug the stupid smirk off his face.\n \"First of all I don\u0027t do that. And second of all you\u0027re a pervert. Now go get laid and leave me alone.\" Cage sat up and rested his elbows on his knees. His baby blue eyes were round as saucers.\n \"You don\u0027t stroke it Low?\"\n \"Oh. My. God. Would you please stop it!\" Cage shook his head in disbelief.\n \"You really don\u0027t. You\u0027ve never had an orgasm. I can see it all over your face. Well shit.\"\n \"Cage I mean it. This conversation,\" I stopped as the door opened and Marcus stepped inside. My face went instantly bright red. I didn\u0027t have to see it to know it. The idea that he could have heard even a tiny portion of this ridiculous conversation was humiliating.\n \"Marcus, man we were just talking about you,\" Cage said with an evil smirk and stood up from the couch. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to clarify Cage\u0027s stupid greeting. Instead I stood stock still as Cage walked by me and whispered,\n \"Remember what I said.\"\n I didn\u0027t need him reminding me that I wasn\u0027t good enough for Marcus. I already knew this. But what he didn\u0027t know was Marcus was completely clueless to this fact. And I wasn\u0027t about to point it out to him.\n I shoved Cage as he stumbled and laughed before going into his room and closing the door behind him.\n I knew Marcus was waiting on me to say something but I didn\u0027t know what to say. Tucking my hair behind my ear I glanced over at him.\n \"Um hey,\" I managed to croak out.\n A small sexy smile touched his lips and I felt like I might melt in a puddle on the ground. If it wasn\u0027t for my worry that he\u0027d heard us before opening the door I would completely be enjoying his smile.\n \"Did you get some sleep?\" He asked walking over to me slowly with a very determined gleam in his eyes.\n I nodded, \"Just woke up.\"\n He slipped his hand into my hair and cupped the back of my neck.\n \"Good,\" he replied. His eyes drifted down my face stopping to study my mouth before traveling on down to let it drift over my neck and shoulders then my chest which was rising and falling pretty darn fast.\n \"Go out with me tonight Low. We\u0027ll go do anything you want to. We can go eat, dancing, walk down the beach you name it. Just go somewhere with me.\"\n I swallowed hard and bobbed my head up and down,\n \"Okay,\" I managed to reply without it sounding like a strangled whisper.\n A pleased grin spread across his face and his eyes locked with mine again.\n \"We can do all three. I\u0027ll take you somewhere to eat.\n Somewhere nice. Then we can go dancing. I really want to dance with you. Then we can end our night with a walk down the beach.\"\n Oh wow. Yes. Yes. Yes. I nodded again.\n \"Then let me go get ready and you do the same. I\u0027ll meet you back right here in an hour. Is that enough time?\"\n \"Yes\"\n Marcus dropped his hand from my neck and stepped back.\n He gave me one last bone melting smile before turning to disappear into his room. I fantasized about following him in there. Watching him change. What would his stomach look like completely bare? The tiny peek I\u0027d gotten was mouthwatering. I could only imagine what the rest of him looked like.\n \"Low, were\u0027d you put my favorite jeans?\" Cage broke the spell. I spun around and headed for the closet where I\u0027d hung up his jeans. Crazy boy couldn\u0027t find anything.\n I pulled the jeans off the rack and handed them to Cage.\n \"Right in front of your face,\" I said handing them to him.\n \"Thanks babe. Look I gotta date. Probably won\u0027t be in until late. You stay here. After that crap Tawny pulled on you this morning I want you here.\"\n I nodded. He jerked his jeans on and I went back to the closet to find the few things of mine I\u0027d hung up.\n \"Where you going?\" he asked as he tugged on his boots.\n \"I don\u0027t know yet. Out with friends.\"\n It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t want to tell him about Marcus because I really did. I wanted to say \u0027look here I guess he doesn\u0027t think of me as slumming it\u0027 but I didn\u0027t. Telling Cage would worry him. Possibly make him get all jealous. I was never sure with Cage. But I wanted Cage to stay out all night. I didn\u0027t want him coming home and ruining my night with Marcus. I kept my mouth shut.\n Cage came up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist. \"Be safe. Call me if you need anything! And don\u0027t drink too much.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be sober and home early and safely tucked away in bed,\" I promised.\n Cage smacked a loud kiss on my cheek, \"That\u0027s my girl,\" he released me and left the closet.\n \"I\u0027m out. If I don\u0027t show up until in the morning don\u0027t worry,\" he started for the door as I walked out of the closet then stopped, \"But call me if you need me.\"\n \"I promise you, I\u0027ll call if I need you.\" He grinned at me then finally left the room. I glanced over at the clock. I had forty five minutes left. I needed to shave, paint my toenails and wax a few other areas. Throwing a few items to choose from on the bed I grabbed my toiletry bag and headed to the bathroom. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-9.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.

But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus.

The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution.

But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family.
