Standing outside the apartment door again I had a horrible case of deja vu. Last time I\u0027d come here she\u0027d completely dashed every dream I\u0027d ever had. Now I was back. I raised my hand to knock and I froze. Did I want to do this? Could I take much more of this? If she had decided we didn\u0027t need to be around each other at all until I learned to control my need to profess my love for her I might go jump off a damn bridge. No. She wouldn\u0027t do that. I was being as dramatic as a damn girl.\n My knuckles hit the smooth wood and it was done. I was here.\n The door opened almost immediately and Will ow stood there smiling nervously.\n \"You came,\" she said. I could hear the relief in her voice.\n Had she really thought I\u0027d turn her down?\n \"You ask. I come.\"\n She chewed on her bottom lip and I looked away. I couldn\u0027t think about her lips.\n \"Come in. Do you want a drink?\"\n She was wringing her hands and biting her lips, Will ow was nervous.\n \"No. I\u0027m good.\"\n I wanted to get on with this. Our combined nervous energy was driving me crazy. I wanted to grab her and reassure her. But I couldn\u0027t. Not anymore.\n \"Oh.\" She looked around and then back at me.\n \"Okay well then would you mind sitting down?\" This was getting more fascinating by the second. I walked over and sank down onto the worn couch where so many of my favorite moments with Will ow had taken place.\n my favorite moments with Will ow had taken place.\n \"You gonna sit?\" I asked as she paced a few times shooting nervous glances my way..\n \"Uh, no, don\u0027t think I can.\"\n Okay.\n \"Low, what\u0027s this about?\"\n She stopped and stood directly in front of me with the coffee table between us.\n \"I love you.\" My heart almost stopped beating in my chest.\n She hadn\u0027t spoken those words since the last time I held her in my arms.\n \"And you did leave me. But... but you came back. No one\u0027s ever come back. They leave me and that\u0027s it. They want to leave me. You didn\u0027t. And you came back.\" I wanted to stand up and reach across the table and jerk her into my arms but I wasn\u0027t sure I could stand up just yet. I needed to hear everything she had to say.\n \"Yes, I came back. My heart never left you.\"\n \"I miss you.\"\n This time I stood up and walked around the table.\n \"I miss you. Every second of every day,\" I whispered. Her eyes followed me until I was inches from her.\n \"I trust you.\"\n I needed more than that.\n \"You trust me,\" I repeated.\n She nodded and her hand came up and caressed the side of my arm.\n \"I want to try again.\"\n Those were the words I needed to hear.\n Willow\n His mouth was on mine before I could respond. I gasped in surprise and his tongue took advantage of it and tangled with mine. Tasting everywhere. I gripped the hair on the back of his head as he pulled me up, hard against him.\n Then we were on the couch. His mouth left mine and he began raining kisses all over my face and down my neck.\n He told me how much he loved me over and over again as he ran his hands down my back cupping my butt and tucking me up against him.\n Moaning into his mouth I nibbled and tasted every smooth inch of his mouth. I felt my shirt begin to lift as Marcus fingers brushed against my skin.\n \"Lift your arm,\" his demand was needy. I didn\u0027t argue. I lifted my arms and my shirt was ripped off my body, and then Marcus\u0027s hands were back on my face kissing me. His hands slowly traveled down my neck and traced my collar bone. I moaned in frustration. Then his hands covered my bra. I cried out from the sensation. The front clasp came undone and my bra fell away, slipping down my arms.\n Marcus stopped kissing me and sat back while he slowly pulled the bra off my wrist and tossed it aside.\n \"I love you,\" he breathed lifting his gaze from my naked breast to my eyes.\n \"I love you too,\" I replied breathlessly.\n \"I want you, Low.\"\n I nodded. I couldn\u0027t form words.\n Pulling me up against him he kissed me and I fumbled with the hem of his shirt.\n \"Off,\" I whispered against his mouth. In one swift movement he jerked it off and I pressed against him sighing at the feel of his warm skin naked against mine.\n \"Low,\" he groaned in my ear as he trailed kisses down my neck.\n I stopped breathing watching as he stopped kissing at the top of my chest. His warm breath tickled my nipples making them even harder.\n When his mouth finally pulled one into his mouth. I screamed out his name and let myself go. I was ready to trust Marcus. Completely.\n When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the smooth defined pecs on Marcus\u0027s chest. I inhaled him. Wrapped in his arms our legs were tangled together. Which I thought was rather delicious. I wasn\u0027t sure how much clothing I had on or if I had any. I was definitely topless. This much I could tell.\n I buried my face in his chest to muffle my giggle.\n \"What\u0027s so funny,\" Marcus sleepy voice asked amused.\n \"I\u0027m naked,\" I said against his chest.\n His chest vibrated from his chuckle.\n \"Yes, and it\u0027s incredible,\" he replied.\n He reached down and pulled the quilt up over us.\n \"I can\u0027t believe we both managed to sleep on this couch,\" I whispered wondering if Cage had come home and seen us like this.\n \"I need to talk to Cage about buying this couch. It now holds some pretty intense memories for me. I want it.\" Unable to hold back my grin I tilted my head back and stared up at him. I loved his sleep mused hair.\n \"How do you feel?\" he asked studying me carefully.\n \"Wonderful,\" I replied honestly.\n A sexy smirk touched his lips, \"Me too.\" His warm hand moved down my back and began to caress my hip.\n \"You\u0027re so soft,\" he murmured. His heavy lidded eyes made my insides do all kinds of funny things.\n \"Cage may be here,\" I reminded him sliding my leg up between his legs.\n \"Hmmm... he is.\"\n My eyes flew open wide.\n Marcus chuckled, \"Relax he didn\u0027t see anything. I had you all covered up when he walked in.\"\n \"What did he say?\"\n I believe his exact words were, \"Well it\u0027s about fucking time.\"\n Giggling I leaned up and kissed his chin.\n \"What did you say?\"\n Marcus kissed my head, \"I agreed, wholeheartedly.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-27.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.

But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution.

But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
