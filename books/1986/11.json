Like I said, I think you\u0027ve had too much too drink.\" Jess crossed her arms strategically under her breasts and pouted. I was beginning to think I\u0027d been had and that pissed me off. When Jess had come to ask me to help her get to her car out back I\u0027d told her to find Rock. But she\u0027d said she couldn\u0027t find him and there were two big stray dogs outside blocking her path to her car.\n Leaving Will ow with Preston bothered me. She was very worked up from our dancing. So damn worked up I\u0027d needed to put some space between us so I could think straight. When she\u0027d started trembling in my arms as I ran my hands over the tops of her thighs I thought I was imagining it. But then she did it again harder. By God no one but me was going to get to witness her orgasm. My heart had almost pounded out of my chest and I\u0027d been so freaking hard, I was pretty sure I\u0027d have suffered permanent damage if I hadn\u0027t gotten her off that dance floor and calmed myself down.\n Jess\u0027s appearance had been the distraction I needed to lose my boner and catch my breath. Dealing with stray dogs would clear my head. That way I could come back and take Will ow on that walk along the beach I\u0027d promised her. I wanted tonight to be special. My flipping that little dress up and sliding my hands between her legs was definitely not what I wanted to happen. Especially considering she had to be pretty damn inexperienced to be brought to an orgasm with just a few touches. Slow Marcus. I had to take it slow.\n \"Well fine then. I guess you can go back inside to your date,\" Jess grumbled.\n \"Yep I think you\u0027re safe,\" I replied and headed inside the back door. There had never been any dogs. Of that I was certain. But at least I wasn\u0027t sporting the woody from hell anymore. I stopped by the bar and picked up our drinks then headed for the table. Preston and Dewayne were alone and the severe looks on their faces made me halt in my steps.\n AH HELL NO!\n I\u0027m an idiot.\n Slamming the drinks down on the table I studied both their faces and I knew. Without asking I knew.\n \"When did she leave?\" I managed to ask over the sick knot in my stomach.\n \"Right after you walked off holding hands with Jess,\" Preston replied.\n \"Said she was getting air but we all know that means she\u0027s jetting,\" Dewayne piped up.\n \"Why did you not do something?\" I barely contained the roar in my chest.\n Preston shrugged looking somewhat sorrowful, \"I did man. I told her it probably wasn\u0027t what it looked like.\" told her it probably wasn\u0027t what it looked like.\" It probably wasn\u0027t what it looked like? Really Preston? That was the best you could do?\"\n \"Hey don\u0027t growl at me. You were the one who was dumb enough to walk off with Jess after almost having sex with Low on the dance floor.\"\n I was going to be sick.\n I stalked to the door wanting desperately to run. Had she called Cage? To save her from me? Opening the door I stepped into a parking lot full of cars but no people. No Will ow.\n Why hadn\u0027t I told her what I was going to do? Did she not realize I was doing all I could do not to find an empty corner and run my hands and tongue all over her body? How could she think I would leave her for someone else? Hadn\u0027t I made myself perfectly obvious with my interest in her?\n Jerking my truck door opened I climbed in and my eyes landed on her purse sitting in the seat she\u0027d vacated. Her phone. Reaching for the small little red purse that had matched her red high heels. Inside was tucked her phone. I pulled it out. One text from Cage.\n \"I\u0027m heading to Destin tonight baby. Should be back in the morning sometime. Text me when you get home safe.\" Dropping her purse I cranked up the truck and pulled out of the parking lot. She\u0027d had to walk home. In those heels. In the dark. Looking like the damn sexiest thing on the planet.\n My heart was racing in my chest for other reasons now.\n Please God let her be okay.\n Slowly I drove back to the apartment searching the dark sidewalks for Will ow. There was no sign of her when I finally pulled into the apartment parking lot. She couldn\u0027t have walked home. She hadn\u0027t had time to walk home. Either she was here and someone gave her a ride or I shook my head. I didn\u0027t want to think about the \u0027or\u0027. I was already starting to panic. I couldn\u0027t think that way. I needed to keep my head. Running up the stairs I opened the door to a very dark, quiet apartment.\n \"Will ow!\"\n I ran to Cage\u0027s bedroom but the bed was empty. She wasn\u0027t here. I spun around panicking. Where could she be?\n I\u0027d lost her. I get one date with her and I lose her. I couldn\u0027t even take care of her for one night. My head was pounding in tune with my heart. I\u0027d go back and stop people along the way. Maybe someone saw her. Maybe she got a ride with someone and they went somewhere else first. Someone had to have seen something. I ran back to the door and jerked it open and took the stairs two at time. I\u0027d find her. I had to.\n \"Marcus?\"\n I halted and spun around to see Will ow walking up the beach with her high heels dangling from her hand. I took off at a run toward her. She was here. She was safe. No one had hurt her. I only had a moment to take in her big expressive green eyes full of surprise before I wrapped her up in my arms.\n \"You\u0027re okay,\" I declared needing to let it register with my brain that Will ow was okay.\n \"Yes,\" she replied in a hesitant voice.\n I ran my hand down her hair needing to feel her. To know she was real and she was here. It took me a second to realize her hands had lodged themselves between our bodies and she was pushing me away. Releasing her I stepped back.\n The sweet face that had been smiling up at me earlier tonight was gone. It was replaced by a very angry scowl.\n And her face was tear streaked. Why had she been crying?\n Oh. I\u0027d forgotten why she\u0027d left in the first place. Jess.\n \"Low listen. You don\u0027t---\"\n \"No Marcus you listen. I realize I may not be the kind of girl you normally take on dates. I don\u0027t run in your family\u0027s social circle and well let\u0027s face it I don\u0027t have a swimsuit model body. But I have feelings too. Probably much more sensitive than the gorgeous females you normally date. IF\n you want to go off with some other girl you should at least alert your current date and find her someone to take her home. Don\u0027t leave her there to look like a fool. It\u0027s not nice!\" She pushed past me and started stalking toward the stairs.\n I stood dumbfounded watching her.\n \"Low,\" I called out running after her. She stopped and then slowly turned around.\n \"What?\"\n \"I would\u0027ve never left you. For anyone. I was an idiot. I made a mistake. I should\u0027ve told you about the dogs and helping Jess get to her car. But honestly I was just thinking about the distraction it would be and I really needed a distraction because you had me so freakin\u0027 worked up I could hardly walk.\"\n Taking a deep breath I waited while she weighed my explanation. I\u0027d keep begging if she needed more. I was not opposed to getting on my knees if it would stop her.\n \"Dogs?\"\n I wanted to laugh in relief.\n \"Yes dogs. Stray dogs were blocking Jess\u0027s path between the door out back and her car. She couldn\u0027t find Rock. I wouldn\u0027t have even gone and helped her if I hadn\u0027t needed a little more time before I got near you again.\" A small frown puckered her forehead.\n \"When you say worked up?\" she paused\n \"I mean, hard as a rock Low.\"\n A small smile spread across her face. I didn\u0027t wait for her to say anything else. I closed the distance between us and grabbed her face in my hands before crushing my mouth to hers. She made a small little sound of surprise but then her hands ran up my arms and gripped my shoulders. She was harder to reach standing barefoot. Those heels had helped out a lot earlier. Reaching down I grabbed her waist and picked her up until she wrapped her legs around my waist.\n Oh. Yeah.\n Willow\n It dawned on me that Marcus was opening the door just as he backed us up inside the dark apartment. I\u0027d been so lost in his kiss I missed the fact he\u0027d walked up the stairs carrying me. I opened my eyes long enough to see him walk over to the couch and sink down onto it with me straddling him. Pulling back he stared at me intently.\n \"We\u0027re going to have to stop soon. I\u0027m about at my limit,\" his voice was raspy.\n \"Limit?\" I asked before raining kisses down the side of his jaw and neck.\n \"Ah, my limit Low. You know,\" he was having trouble talking and it made me feel powerful. Feeling brave I flicked my tongue out and quickly licked at his neck. He smelled so good. Moaning he shifted under me until his erection was pressed against the crotch of my panties. The sensation was too much and I cried out in shock and pleasure.\n \"And that\u0027s my limit,\" Marcus said pushing me off him and standing up. I started to think I\u0027d done something wrong again but the way he was breathing like he\u0027d just ran a marathon I figured that must be good.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked staring up at him wanting him to just come back down here. I\u0027d found something I really liked.\n Marcus closed his eyes tightly and let out a loud groan.\n \"Low, baby please pull your dress down,\" he pleaded.\n Glancing down I noticed my dress had ridden up around my waist.\n \"Oops,\" I said giggling and pulling it back down.\n Marcus let out a small laugh and then met my questioning gaze.\n \"Low tonight was amazing. Except for the part where I hurt you and you ran away and scared the bejesus out of me.\n Being with you is incredible. I want to do it again.\n Tomorrow. And the next day,\" I laughed and he grinned then continued, \"You get the idea. But here\u0027s the thing. I don\u0027t want to move too fast with you. I\u0027m going to have to work on that because I\u0027m used to moving pretty fast.\" Then why go slow with me? Frowning I stood up. I barely came to his shoulders when I didn\u0027t have the help of heels. I wore heels on all my shoes to give me an added boost.\n \"I didn\u0027t ask you to go slow.\"\n He rubbed his face and ran his hand through his hair and let out a strange tight laugh. \"I know that but I want to. You\u0027re different. And if I\u0027m right you\u0027re really inexperienced.\" Warmth flooded my face. I should have known he\u0027d be able to tell. My kisses can\u0027t be what he\u0027s used to.\n \"No Low, you misunderstood me,\" he reached out to touch me and stopped himself, \"Listen to me. No one, I mean no one has ever got me so worked up with kisses alone.\n You\u0027re perfect. Everything about you is perfect.\" Well that made me feel better. It made me feel powerful. I liked it.\n I took a step toward Marcus and he laughed softly. \"Don\u0027t tease me Low,\" he pleaded.\n Sticking my lips out in a pout I frowned up at him. \"Okay fine. I\u0027ll leave you alone.\"\n Stepping around him I headed for Cage\u0027s bedroom.\n \"Low?\"\n I turned at the sound of his voice.\n \"Yes?\"\n He looked unsure and nervous. It made me want to go hug him and assure him everything was fine.\n \"Could you. I mean If I,\" he paused and took a deep breath,\n \"If I sleep out here on the couch would you please sleep in my bed?\"\n I hadn\u0027t been expecting that.\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I can\u0027t sleep knowing you\u0027re in Cage\u0027s bed.\" His simple explanation made me feel tingly all over.\n \"Okay,\" I replied unable to keep the silly smile off my face.\n He let out a breath like he\u0027d been holding his. \"Thank you.\" I grinned and shrugged, \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\n \"But I have to go in there and get my pajamas,\" I explained.\n \"Just get all your clothes.\"\n I laughed, \"Marcus you can\u0027t just move out onto the couch.\n That wouldn\u0027t be fair. You have a nice comfortable bed in your room. You shouldn\u0027t have to sleep on the couch.\"\n \"Then sleep. Just sleep. With me, in my bed. That\u0027s what you do with Cage now right?\"\n \"Yes but I\u0027m not attracted to Cage.\"\n \"We\u0027ll work around that. Just please move your things to my room.\"\n As wonderful as that sounded it also sounded as if we were moving in together. Which was the epitome of moving fast.\n \"Then we\u0027ll be living together? You do realize that\u0027s what it would be. That\u0027s really moving fast.\"\n Marcus frowned and looked back at the couch.\n \"You\u0027re right. Okay, I\u0027ll sleep on the couch for now. Later...\n when we\u0027re ready, I\u0027ll move into the bed.\"\n \"Are you sure about this,\" I asked.\n \"Yes. I want to see where this is going with us and I can\u0027t do that with you sleeping in Cage\u0027s bed every night. I want you here. But not in there,\" he pointed toward Cage\u0027s room.\n With an explanation like that, how could I tell him no? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-11.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.

The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
