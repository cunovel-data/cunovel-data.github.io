{"id":73479,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Two Months Later\\n\\n Marcus\\n\\n \"A sober Marcus Hardy, I do believe my eyes deceive me,\" Dewayne drawled as I pulled out a chair and sat down beside Rock at the table they\u0027d taken over at Live Bay to hear Jackdown perform.\\n\\n \"He just got here. It\u0027s early yet. Give him time,\" Preston chimed in as he plopped back down with a girl apparently attached to him. She wiggled on his lap and he licked her ear. Usual Preston behavior. The tourists were piling in and there was fresh meat everywhere. Preston would screw his way through the best looking ones for the next three months.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not drinking tonight. I dropped out of all my classes this semester before I failed them. So I figure it\u0027s time I sober up and play makeup with a few summer courses.\" Rock patted me on the back, \"There\u0027s the old Marcus we know and love. Knew you were in there somewhere. Glad you\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t look over at him. Because I wasn\u0027t back. I was just as dead inside sober as I was drunk. The old Marcus had been completely destroyed. Never to return.\\n\\n \"Smile brother, there are hot barely clothed girls crawling all over this place. And all they want are one night stands. It\u0027s freaking heaven on earth,\" Preston said grinning like a little boy in a candy store.\\n\\n \"Screwing faceless girls is getting old. I need a break from them too,\" I said and turned down the beer a waitress offered me. I had a bottled water. It was going to take a lot of water to cleanse me of all the alcohol I\u0027d forced on myself.\\n\\n \"Break from pussy? Whatever man,\" Dewayne replied with disbelief in his tone.\\n\\n \"I thought you were going on that road trip with uh,\" Rock paused and glanced at me.\\n\\n \"You can say his name. I\u0027m not an idiot and I don\u0027t care.\\n\\n How many times do I have to tell you that it doesn\u0027t matter to me.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, um, so that road trip you were talking about with Cage. You decided to pass it up?\"\\n\\n Preston shrugged, \"I don\u0027t know. Cage seems to be backing out of it. He\u0027s kind of changed lately.\" He trailed off and I could feel the tension at the table. They were so worried that one mention of Will ow would send me into a blind rage. I was past that. Sure I\u0027d gone a little mental at the mention of her name or anything that reminded me of her for a while but I was over it. Completely numb where she was concerned.\\n\\n I leaned back in my chair and watched as the sea of people danced. No one caught my attention. No one stood out to me. I was numb to more than just Will ow. I was numb to life.\\n\\n She\u0027d completely messed me up. But I survived. I was better now. I wasn\u0027t a brainless sap anymore and no female would ever have that much control over me again.\\n\\n \"Uh, Marcus man you sure you\u0027re all good with Will ow and stuff now?\" Dewayne asked.\\n\\n I glared at him. Why\u0027d he have to keep saying her name and bringing it up?\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He nodded, \"Good \u0027cause she just walked in lookin\u0027 like a damn goddess.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t seen her since the night I\u0027d left her standing in my father\u0027s new home. I\u0027d avoided her at all costs and she\u0027d done the same. Not once had she stepped foot into this place. I tried not to look for her. I told myself I didn\u0027t give a shit. But I was weak and I turned my head toward the door.\\n\\n She\u0027d lost weight.\\n\\n Her hair was longer.\\n\\n She had on a new dress that clung to every curve.\\n\\n She was breathtaking.\\n\\n And she was wrapped up in Cage York\u0027s arms.\\n\\n I\u0027d heard he didn\u0027t go out much anymore. I knew it was because of Will ow. I\u0027d told myself he was just being her friend. That he was still sleeping around just not as much.\\n\\n But the possessive gleam in his eyes as he kept her pulled up against his side told me something else. I wanted to look away. And damn I wanted not to care. She was a liar.\\n\\n Cut from the same cloth as her whore sister. That\u0027s what I\u0027d tried to convince myself over the past weeks. It never sounded believable. Even though I\u0027d caught her there.\\n\\n There were so many things about her that screamed she was nothing like her sister. Watching her as she looked nervously up at Cage as he spoke to her. He was her safety net. Just like he\u0027d predicted. I\u0027d left her and she\u0027d had Cage to run back to. But she hadn\u0027t stood by and lied to Cage either. She hadn\u0027t watched as her sister tore his family apart. NO. She\u0027d done all that to me. She\u0027d claimed to love me then let her sister almost destroy my mother. My sister.\\n\\n Me. Cage bent down and whispered in her ear and a small smile lifted the corners of her mouth. Then her head turned and her eyes locked with mine. The smile vanished and she froze. Her hand flew up to grab Cage\u0027s arm as if she needed his protection and rage ignited in me. She wasn\u0027t going to destroy me again. It was my turn. I stood up and grabbed the tipsy brunette in Preston\u0027s lap.\\n\\n \"Come on baby, dance with me,\" I didn\u0027t wait to see Low\u0027s reaction. My dance partner scrambled out of Preston\u0027s lap and clung to me, obviously happy with this turn of events.\\n\\n Closing off my feelings and shutting down my emotions, I pulled her against me and moved against her. I cupped her barely covered ass, and she purred and pressed closer to me. I\u0027d show Will ow. She wanted to show up here with Cage? Well baby, you can look your eyes full. The girl\u0027s arms ran up my chest and clasped around my neck. I smiled down at her, focusing on her face and trying my damnedest to get Will ow\u0027s image out of my head.\\n\\n \"Alright man, you accomplished what you set out to do. She turned and fled. Congrats. Now give me back my date,\" Preston said, pulling the brunette off me. I didn\u0027t even try to hold onto her. I looked back at the door. Will ow was gone.\\n\\n Willow\\n\\n Cage walked into the living room holding a large bowl of popcorn and two sodas. I\u0027d stopped drinking Jarritos. They reminded me of Marcus too much. I pulled back the blanket to let Cage under it with me. Once we had it covering us up he put the bowl in his lap and handed me a soda.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m agreeing to this chick flick shit because tonight sucked.\\n\\n But the next movie is going to have some blood and action.\\n\\n Got it?\"\\n\\n I laughed and nodded. Cage was beyond wonderful.\\n\\n \"Pinky promise,\" I said holding out my pinky. Cage looked down at it and then back at me with a mischievous grin before pulling it into his mouth and sucking it.\\n\\n \"Cage!\" I squealed pulling it out of his mouth with a pop.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t point your cute little body parts at me and I won\u0027t suck on them,\" he replied with a wink.\\n\\n I would have never made it over the past two months without Cage. My chest still ached and my anxiety attacks were back full force but I was actually doing better. Well until Cage had talked me into facing everyone at Live Bay tonight. I\u0027d thought I was ready. But Marcus had been there.\\n\\n He\u0027d looked at me and I\u0027d thought for a moment I saw relief as our gazes locked. But I\u0027d been way off base. He\u0027d jumped up and taken a girl on the dance floor and began to grope her right there for my viewing pleasure. He was sending me a message and I got it loud and clear. Cage had spun me around and hauled me out of there so quick I had spun me around and hauled me out of there so quick I didn\u0027t have time to fall apart.\\n\\n \"Eat. I\u0027ve loaded this down with butter and salt. You\u0027re doing better. Putting on a little more weight. I don\u0027t want you to relapse after tonight.\"\\n\\n I reached into the bowl and grabbed a large handful of popcorn and stuffed it into my mouth.\\n\\n Cage chuckled, \"Awesome.\"\\n\\n Chewing I settled in against Cage\u0027s side and focused on the movie. If I didn\u0027t concentrate I\u0027d think about all the times I\u0027d spent with Marcus on this couch. How many times I\u0027d watched him sleep right here where we sat. It seemed like forever ago now. Almost like that part of my life was a dream. Tonight reminded me that it wasn\u0027t. It was very real.\\n\\n And just like before the person I loved had left me. I reached over and grasped Cage\u0027s shirt tightly in my hand. I needed the reminder that I loved Cage and he hadn\u0027t left.\\n\\n Not when I\u0027d lost it and completely shattered after Marcus had left me standing there at my sister\u0027s. Not when the panic attacks started happening every night. He\u0027d stayed.\\n\\n Given up his nights out so he could take care of me. He was my family. He was all I had. Facing my sister was impossible. I missed Larissa so much it hurt but I couldn\u0027t go back there. The memories attached to that house were too painful. One day I\u0027d be okay. Then I\u0027d go see my niece.\\n\\n I\u0027d learn to accept what my sister had done and accept Jefferson Hardy as Larissa\u0027s father.\\n\\n \"He still cares.\"\\n\\n Cage\u0027s words startled me.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked looking back to the screen thinking he was commenting on what was happening.\\n\\n \"Marcus. He cares Low. I saw it in his eyes. What he did tonight was shitty but it was his defense mechanism. He doesn\u0027t want to care. But he does.\"\\n\\n I shook my head and closed my eyes. I didn\u0027t want to hear that. Not now.\\n\\n \"No Cage. Don\u0027t. I can\u0027t let myself hope. He hates me. He always will.\"\\n\\n Cage clicked his tongue, \"There\u0027s a thin line baby. A thin line between love and hate.\"\\n\\n \"No. There isn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Cage tucked the hair that had gotten loose from my braid behind my ear.\\n\\n \"Low, a guy doesn\u0027t fall in love with you and have you love him back then just throw it away. You\u0027re too special. After being loved by you, he can\u0027t completely forget. He\u0027s haunted by it. I\u0027d bet my life on it.\"\\n\\n Cage loved me. He thought I was perfect. He was the brother every girl deserves. I turned my head and kissed his chest.\\n\\n \"Thank you. I know you really believe that. And I love you for it. But you\u0027re wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you figured out by now that I\u0027m never wrong?\" Laughing I reached for another handful of popcorn. I was safe here in this moment. I didn\u0027t want to think about anything else. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-21.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story… \\n Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \\n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \\n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
