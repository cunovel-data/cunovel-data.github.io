{"id":73463,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The night air was still cool. Even though our super short spring weather was almost gone our nights hadn\u0027t begun to warm up yet. I took a deep cleansing breath of ocean air and stepped into the white sand wishing I hadn\u0027t worn boots. I could have slipped off heels easily and felt the sand between my toes.\n My phone rang in my purse and I pulled it out. It was Cage.\n \"Hey you,\" I said holding the phone pressed between my ear and shoulder as I walked down the beach toward our apartment.\n \"Where are you?\"\n Figures this would be his question. Knowing Cage he was in the middle of sex and realized he didn\u0027t know where I was tonight and grabbed the phone to call me in between thrust. Gross, bad mental image.\n \"Currently I\u0027m outside Live Bay on the beach getting some fresh air. Jackdown is playing tonight.\"\n \"Who\u0027s with you?\"\n \"Well, I was with Preston but he left with a girl and Marcus said he would give me a ride home.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Marcus?\"\n \"Inside dancing with a girl.\"\n There was a pause.\n \"You ready to leave?\"\n I was, but telling Cage that would have him leaving his date and rushing to my side. He had a hero complex when it came to me. I often wondered if it was because no one ever saved us as kids. No one saved his Mom when his step-dad beat her. He was just a kid but I knew he blamed himself for not stopping it.\n \"I\u0027m good.\"\n \"No you aren\u0027t Low. I can hear it in your voice. Something\u0027s wrong. I\u0027ll be there in five minutes.\"\n \"Cage don\u0027t--\"\n But he\u0027d hung up. Oh well. No doubt the girl will let him come right back. They always did, which baffled me. If a guy ran off on me to go help some other girl while we were on a date I would not let him just run right back and jump in my bed later. But then I wouldn\u0027t be having casual sex with a strange guy either. So this was a moot point.\n Heading back up to the street I glanced over at the lights of Live Bay and figured I\u0027d just call and let Marcus know I was leaving instead of going back inside. Besides from the looks of the blonde bombshel in his arms he probably wouldn\u0027t realize I was gone for awhile.\n Marcus\n \u0026Igrave; finally managed to untangle myself from Jess. I wanted to dance with Will ow. I\u0027d watched her briefly when I\u0027d first arrived and all I could think about was being close to her and touching her while she moved like that. Jess had come along and delayed me. Dewayne sat at the table with Rock and Trisha. They were laughing and talking but there was no Will ow. I glanced toward the bar but I couldn\u0027t see her in the crowd of people.\n \"Where\u0027s Will ow?\"\n \"What? No love for me first?\" Rock taunted as he smirked up at me.\n I turned to Dewayne. He was leaned back in his chair with a long neck beer in his hands as he watched me.\n \"Where\u0027s Will ow?\" I asked him specifically this time.\n He flicked the metal bar in his bottom lip and tilted his head toward the door, \"Went to get some air a while ago.\" Oh no.\n \"How long ago?\"\n Dewayne seemed to be enjoying my frustration. He put a stupid cigarette to his lips and took a long drag then shrugged, \"Since you ran off with Jess.\" I turned to head outside when my phone rang. I hoped it wasn\u0027t Manda with another crisis concerning Mom right now. That was the last thing I needed. I had been making some headway with Will ow. Until Jess had drug me out onto the dance floor.\n \"hello,\" I said pressing the phone close to my ear as I stepped outside.\n \"I got my girl. I\u0027m taking her home. In case you remembered you were her ride and couldn\u0027t find her later I wanted you to know.\"\n Cage had come to get Will ow. HELL!\n \"Why, what\u0027s wrong? She okay?\"\n She\u0027d called Cage to come get her and he\u0027d come to rescue her. Where had I been? Dancing. Perfect. Just perfect.\n \"She was just tired and ready for bed. Didn\u0027t want to bother you and your girl. I got her. All \u0027s good. Later man.\" The phone call ended.\n My girl? Jess was not my girl. I mean I\u0027d messed around with her in the past. She was Rock\u0027s hot little cousin but never anything serious.\n I stood in the parking lot looking out at the cars. I\u0027d screwed up already. Will ow had all kinds of walls built around her. I\u0027d wanted to get past them. I wanted her to trust me and let me in. But I\u0027d let her down and she\u0027d gone running to Cage.\n There had been interest in her eyes tonight. I\u0027d seen it. I\u0027d wanted to shout out loud in triumph at it. But then Jess had shown up and I hated turning her down. Rock said she was going through a really bad time right now. All that had been about was trying to cheer up an old friend. Nothing more.\n But to Will ow... it had looked like more. I\u0027d left her. Cage had come for her. Who would have thought competing with Cage for the most trustworthy guy would be hard?\n \"You find her?\" Trisha asked when I returned to the table. I needed another drink. This time screw the Coke. I just needed the whiskey.\n \"Cage got her.\"\n Dewayne chuckled and I shot him a warning glare. I didn\u0027t need to hear it from him right now. He always saw too much. Tonight, I wanted him to keep his opinions to himself.\n \"Awww dang. Krit wanted to come see her after this set.\" I shifted my angry glare toward Trisha who was grinning at me like she knew a hilarious secret.\n \"Hey, Hardy don\u0027t look at my woman like that. Save your angry snarls for someone else,\" Rock\u0027s warning wasn\u0027t in jest. He meant business. I ran my hand through my hair and growled looking back toward the door wanting desperately to leave.\n \"She\u0027s got you all tied up in knots. It\u0027s about fucking time.\n Sadie White did a number on you. Good to see you getting all worked up over another girl.\" There was no reason to deny Dewayne\u0027s observation. These were my best friends.\n They knew me better than anyone else. Lying to them was pointless.\n \"Why the hell does she run off to him all the time? I don\u0027t get it!\"\n Trisha sat her drink down and leaned forward staring directly at me. \"Because he\u0027s her safe house. As screwed up as it is considering who we\u0027re talking about. Cage cares about one thing in this world and it\u0027s Low. He\u0027s been fighting her battles and fixing her problems since they were kids. We all lived on the same street. I remember watching them. It always fascinated me how bad boy Cage York acted like a love sick puppy when it came to her. She fell down he came running. You want her, then good luck.\n Because every time you aren\u0027t there to pick her up I can assure you Cage will be. She knows she can call him. She knows no matter what he\u0027ll love her. Unconditional love is hard to compete with.\"\n I reached over and took a long swig of Dewayne\u0027s beer.\n Trisha was right. How did I compete with that? And did I even want to?\n Willow\n Cage closed the door behind us and threw his keys on the table.\n \"I picked up some more of your Jarrito\u0027s today. Go get you one while I get a shower.\"\n I\u0027d made Cage paranoid about the smell of perfume, sex and whiskey that always clung to him after his dates. I wanted to tell him not to worry about it. I was fine but I wanted alone time. So I nodded and headed for the fridge.\n Cage kissed the top of my head on his way to the bathroom.\n \"I\u0027ll scrub up good. I promise,\" he called out as he closed the door.\n I laughed quietly to myself and started to go to his bedroom when the couch caught my attention. Memories of curling up against Marcus and waking up in his lap had me walking over to sit down on it instead. I liked it here. He sat here for hours letting me sleep in his lap. No one other than Cage had ever done something like that for me. Smiling I took a sip of my drink. He was a good guy. A sexy guy. A fun guy to fantasize about.\n My cheeks flushed at the thought that Dewayne may have told Marcus what he suspected. He suspected right. I was jealous. I liked Marcus way more than I should. But Marcus knowing was just embarrassing. My phone dinged alerting me of a text message.\n It was from Trisha\n \"U make it home okay?\"\n I quickly typed\n \"yes. Thank you \u003d)\"\n \"U r missed,\" she replied.\n Missed by who? Marcus? Or just her? Surely Dewayne hadn\u0027t discussed with everyone those unspoken words before I left. God, I hoped not.\n I tucked my phone back inside my pocket and stood up.\n The shower had stopped and I wanted to get one next.\n Dewayne\u0027s cigarette smoke clung to my hair and clothes. I was exhausted and ready to put this night behind me.\n I woke up before anyone else and collected Cage\u0027s and my dirty laundry and headed to the washroom downstairs to get started on it. Cage had crawled in bed beside me last night and we\u0027d gone to sleep without many words. He didn\u0027t get up and leave all night which meant he was resting up for a reason. Today had to be a game day. And his uniform was dirty as were all my clothes and most of his jeans. I added bleach to the water and threw his filthy dirt stained uniform in by itself. Luckily, there were three washers and dryers down here and all three were empty. Many of the apartments had their own so rarely did I come down here and find someone else using them. It made laundry time go so much quicker. Once I got all three machines going, my phone rang. Pulling it out of my pocket, I glanced down to see it was Tawny. She never called me and when she did it was never good.\n \"hello.\"\n \"Where are you?\"\n \"At Cage\u0027s.\"\n \"Figures. Listen I need a sitter for tonight. I have a date.\n Larissa is asking for you. If you keep her then you can stay the night. I probably won\u0027t be home until the morning anyway.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got work Tawny.\"\n \"Shit. Fine. If I have to pay a sitter then don\u0027t come back here this week.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t planning on it.\"\n \"What you\u0027ve finally shacked up with Cage? Just like our Mama.\"\n \"No Tawny, YOU are just like our Mama. I\u0027m still a virgin and you have a kid and no husband. Do the math sister.\"\n \"Whatever. Bye.\"\n The call ended. I felt sick at my stomach at the thought of Larissa being left overnight with some sitter. There was no telling who Tawny would get. I dialed her number back.\n \"What?\"\n \"After work I\u0027ll come over and keep her overnight. Don\u0027t get a sitter for all night.\"\n There was a brief pause.\n \"Okay, fine. What time do I tell the sitter you\u0027ll be here?\"\n \"I work a double but I\u0027ll get someone to switch with me so I can leave by eleven. So tell her eleven thirty. I may have to walk.\"\n \"Fine.\"\n She hung up again.\n If it wasn\u0027t for my niece I doubt I\u0027d even talk to my sister.\n There was no love between us and I wasn\u0027t sure why. When we were little, I tried so hard to gain her approval, but nothing I did pleased her. It was as if my being born ruined her life. Who was I kidding. My mother acted the same way.\n My birth had not been cause for celebration for anyone in my family. Some days I imagined getting on a bus and leaving this town behind. The memories weren\u0027t good. At leaving this town behind. The memories weren\u0027t good. At least most of them weren\u0027t. I could fit my life into one suitcase. The only person who would miss me would be Cage. Well and Larissa until she forgot I existed. Just starting over anywhere else was so tempting. Eventually Cage would see the wisdom behind my leaving. He\u0027d be free of his need to protect me. I\u0027d make new friends. Maybe find a decent job and finish my education.\n \"Deep thoughts?\" Marcus\u0027s voice startled me and I jerked my gaze up from the cement floor to stare up into sleepy green eyes.\n \"Hey, what\u0027re you doing down here so early?\" He shrugged and sat down a basket of laundry on the ground beside him.\n \"Well I thought I\u0027d get some laundry done before I fixed breakfast. But it appears all the machines are in use,\" his tone was teasing.\n \"Oops. Sorry about that. I didn\u0027t think anyone would need them so early.\"\n \"That was my thought too.\"\n I let out a small laugh and fiddled with my thumbs while my hands fisted nervously in my lap. Did he know I\u0027d run out like a jealous idiot last night?\n \"So, you left me last night.\" His tone didn\u0027t give anything away.\n I tucked the hair acting as a wall between us behind my ear.\n \"Um, yeah. Sorry. I was tired and needed some air.\" He didn\u0027t respond right away and I prayed my breathing was normal because my heart was doing a strange little fluttery thing.\n \"I would\u0027ve taken you home if I\u0027d known you wanted to go.\" Because he was one of the good guys.\n \"You were having fun. Your friends obviously miss you. I didn\u0027t want to ruin your night. Cage was coming my way so it worked out okay.\"\n A small frown touched his lips and I turned my eyes back to the cement crack in the floor I\u0027d been staring at before he\u0027d arrived.\n \"I was enjoying your company too. I\u0027d looked forward to taking you home.\"\n Okay now the fluttery thing my heart was doing had turned into a full blown pounding.\n Had Marcus Hardy just insinuated he was upset because he didn\u0027t get to take me home?\n \"Oh,\" I responded. What else did I say to that?\n The first washer stopped and I jumped up and made myself busy with putting the load in the dryer.\n \"Washer is free,\" I announced smiling back at him.\n He stood up and instead of waiting on me to move out of the way he crowded me back against the washer and sat his basket on the closed washer beside it. I lifted my eyes up to his to say \"excuse me,\" but the heated look in his green eyes stopped me. A small gasp left my mouth.\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m making myself very clear Low,\" he\u0027d lowered his voice and the effect made goose bumps break out over my body. \"I was only interested in one person at that bar last night. I only came to see one person,\" he tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and softly caressed my earlobe before tracing the line of my jaw. \"I was there for you.\"\n The husky whisper in his voice made it hard for me to take a deep breath. Instead, I was making small little pants.\n \"Oh,\" I whispered.\n He chuckled and lowered his head until his lips were hovering over mine.\n \"OH! Ah, um, I, uh,\" the startled female voice broke the spell and Marcus closed his eyes tightly and cursed.\n Straightening up he turned around to face whoever had entered the room. I couldn\u0027t see over his back and the way he was keeping me cornered with his body I realized he didn\u0027t want the intruder to see me either. At least not my face.\n \"Sadie?\" I could hear the surprised confusion in his voice.\n \"Uh, Marcus I\u0027m so sorry. I was headed up to your apartment and I saw the back of your head through the window and came in. I didn\u0027t see anyone else.\"\n \"No it\u0027s okay. What\u0027re you doing here?\" Marcus body was strung tight as a bow. Something was off with this situation.\n Who was Sadie?\n \"It\u0027s Amanda. She stayed over at my place last night. I took her home this morning and your Mom was well... anyway, uh, she\u0027s outside in the Hummer and upset. I didn\u0027t know what else to do.\" The sound of the girl\u0027s musical voice was not helping my imagination. She had an odd affect on Marcus.\n \"No you did the right thing. I\u0027m coming.\" I heard the door shut and Marcus let out a defeated sigh.\n \"I gotta go check on her.\"\n \"Of course you do.\" I stepped out from around him this time and went to the other washing machine that had stopped to unload it.\n He stared at me as if he was going to say something else but instead shook his head and left the room and his dirty laundry forgotten.\n I got my other two loads in the dryer then put a load of his dark clothes in to wash.\n Standing in the washroom without Marcus suddenly felt cold and lonely. He\u0027d almost kissed me. He\u0027d come to see me last night. But then Sadie had shown up. She affected him.\n Why? Jess, Sadie... there were many girls in his life. Just like Cage. I shook my head and cleared my thoughts. I needed to finish up and get ready for work. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-5.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story… \n Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
