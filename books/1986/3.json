He smelled so good I wanted to curl up inside his clothes.\\n\\n \"Low, you need to wake up,\" his voice said a little louder. I stretched and opened my eyes. It took a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. But the first thing I saw was the very defined six pack of Marcus Hardy\u0027s stomach peeking out from underneath the dark blue t-shirt he was wearing. My next realization was my head was in his lap.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I had to wake you but it\u0027s after two and I figured you might want to get to bed before Cage gets home.\" The warm cotton of his shirt was clasp tightly in my fist. I stared at my hand and quickly released the grip I\u0027d had on his shirt. What the heck? Had I been trying to undress him in my sleep? God, I hoped not.\\n\\n I sat up and a yawn escaped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I fell asleep on you,\" I mumbled feeling my cheeks grow warm.\\n\\n He grinned and his green eyes twinkled with mischief,\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be. I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ve enjoyed a night this much.\" I ducked my head and bit my lip to keep a silly grin from breaking out on my face.\\n\\n \"Me too, well except when I fell asleep.\" His deep chuckle sent a warmth through me I didn\u0027t recognize. It wasn\u0027t something I was familiar with but it was nice. More than nice. It could be addicting.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better get to bed. You\u0027ve got that early class,\" he said softly.\\n\\n I nodded then stood up and made my way to Cage\u0027s bedroom door. Turning back before I disappeared inside I called out, \"Good night.\"\\n\\n \"Good night Low,\" his deep voice rumbled in the darkness.\\n\\n \"Hey baby, I\u0027m home and I\u0027m clean. I scrubbed in the shower and used half a bottle of mouth wash,\" Cage murmured as he crawled into bed beside me. I forced open my sleepy eyes to see the sunrise on the horizon. I nodded and rolled over to get another hour of sleep before I needed to get up.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I stayed out all night. I didn\u0027t mean to,\" he whispered reaching out and clasping my hand in his. I didn\u0027t allow him to snuggle up to me in bed. It never ended well.\\n\\n He\u0027d get a hard on and start trying to feel me up. We\u0027d tried a few times and I always ended up frustrated with him and threatening to sleep on the floor. I didn\u0027t want things to get heated with us. Cage was my family. He\u0027d never be anything more.\\n\\n \"S\u0027okay,\" I muttered\\n\\n \"Did you have a good evening? I saw you made pizza and left me a few slices in the fridge.\"\\n\\n I nodded against the pillow.\\n\\n \"Did Marcus eat with you?\"\\n\\n I nodded again.\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t like us Low. You know that right.\" I knew what Cage was saying. Marcus was out of my league. He didn\u0027t want me thinking there could ever be anything between me and his roommate. I was low class.\\n\\n Marcus was a rich kid.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not stupid Cage.\"\\n\\n \"No you\u0027re fucking brilliant. And a guy like Marcus would never get just how fucking perfect and brilliant you are. He\u0027d never see past the other stuff.\"\\n\\n I wanted to be mad at him but I knew he was right. If Marcus ever saw what I came from, what I was, he\u0027d never give me the time of day.\\n\\n \"I know,\" I whispered into the dark.\\n\\n \"I love you Low\"\\n\\n \"I love you too\"\\n\\n \"Then take this,\" he said as he slipped a key into my hand and closed my fist over it. \"I\u0027ll be able to relax knowing you have a key. Please take it.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t respond. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. The fact was I wanted that key. It gave me a warped sense of reassurance that I would be able to see Marcus even more frequently.\\n\\n Within seconds he was softly snoring in my ear. I lay there staring at the ceiling. Fate wasn\u0027t fair. It loved playing cruel jokes on me. Marcus Hardy was its new joke.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t expected Marcus to be awake when I walked out of Cage\u0027s bedroom at seven in the morning. And I really hadn\u0027t expected him to be standing at the stove cooking eggs and bacon.\\n\\n \"Good morning,\" I couldn\u0027t help but smile at how cute he looked cooking in a pair of sweats and t-shirt that covered his yummy chest I\u0027d had a peek at last night.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want you going to class hungry. So, I figured since I was up I\u0027d go ahead and fix you something.\" My heart melted a little. No one had ever made me breakfast. Not even my mother. Oh fate really did suck. Why did this amazing wonderful sexy guy have to be a freaking Hardy? Why couldn\u0027t he be one of the guys from my neighborhood? Someone who understood the life I\u0027d lived and didn\u0027t judge me or see me differently because of it.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s really sweet.\"\\n\\n He grinned and reached for a plate.\\n\\n \"Then I believe my mission is accomplished.\" Laughing softly so I didn\u0027t wake up Cage, I walked over and took the plate he was offering to me.\\n\\n \"I made coffee too. How do you drink it?\" This was really too good to be true. I glanced back at the bedroom door and wondered if I was actually still curled up in bed asleep. This was more dream like than real world.\\n\\n \"Sugar? Cream?\" his voice broke into my thoughts and I turned my gaze back to him and smiled.\\n\\n \"Both please, two teaspoons of sugar. And thank you, really. No one\u0027s ever made me breakfast before. I\u0027m kind of at a loss for words.\"\\n\\n His smile deepened and there was something in his eyes I hoped I wasn\u0027t imagining. The interest was there. I could see it. Was it because he thought I was easy?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome and if you keep looking at me like that I may become your personal chef.\"\\n\\n I covered the giggle I couldn\u0027t control. He was quite possibly the most charming guy I\u0027d ever met.\\n\\n His eyes got serious a moment and I watched as he reached out and touched my cheek almost reverently.\\n\\n \"I really like your dimples,\" he whispered.\\n\\n The heat rose up my neck so fast and flooded my face I knew I had to look like a red berry. I hated my fair skin.\\n\\n \"Go sit down and eat Low, please.\"\\n\\n I obeyed without question.\\n\\n I was on my second bite of eggs when he sat down across from me at the table.\\n\\n \"What class do you have today?\"\\n\\n I swallowed and took a drink of coffee to wash it down before responding.\\n\\n \"Calculus\"\\n\\n He grinned, \"If you need any help, math is my thing.\" I needed help but I doubted I\u0027d be able to stop smelling him and ogling him long enough to pay attention to the words coming out of his mouth.\\n\\n \"Thanks\"\\n\\n He nodded and took a drink of his coffee.\\n\\n \"Are you coming back tonight?\" He asked after a few minutes. I wanted him to be asking because he wanted to see me. But I also knew I needed to get those thoughts under control before I set myself up to get hurt.\\n\\n \"Not sure but I doubt it. I\u0027m probably going to stay at my sister\u0027s,\" I didn\u0027t want to elaborate but I was due a night since I\u0027d kept Larissa yesterday. Besides I couldn\u0027t move into Cage\u0027s bed.\\n\\n A frown creased his forehead and he appeared to be thinking about something that bothered him.\\n\\n \"You know I don\u0027t mind you being here. If you need to stay here I\u0027m completely cool with it. This is Cage\u0027s place after all.\"\\n\\n I smiled and swallowed my last bite of bacon.\\n\\n \"Thank you but that isn\u0027t why. I can\u0027t just move in here. It would crimp Cage\u0027s life and he\u0027d eventually get annoyed with me. He doesn\u0027t see it that way but I don\u0027t want to wear out my welcome.\"\\n\\n Marcus shook his head, \"You won\u0027t wear out your welcome.\\n\\n I\u0027m positive Cage would never want you somewhere else.\\n\\n He\u0027s very protective of you.\"\\n\\n I smiled and stood up to take my plate to the sink.\\n\\n \"Whether he realizes it or not he needs his freedom and room to breathe.\"\\n\\n Marcus frowned but didn\u0027t respond.\\n\\n \"Thanks again for breakfast. It was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I appreciate it.\" The small frown eased at my words and he smiled but I could still see the concern in his eyes. God he was going to get past my barriers. I needed to put some distance between us.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m gone. See ya later,\" I called out as I headed for the door without looking back.\\n\\n \"Bye Will ow.\"\\n\\n Marcus\\n\\n Amanda called me from school upset shortly after Will ow left. Apparently Dad hadn\u0027t come home last night and Mom had locked herself in her bedroom crying and wouldn\u0027t come out this morning. I\u0027d gone by to check on Mom first and she\u0027d put on a happy face for me but the dark circles under her eyes told me she knew the truth. It was time I had a talk with dad.\\n\\n As I pulled into the parking lot at Sea Breeze High School, I spotted Amanda sitting on a picnic table outside the cafeteria entrance with Sadie White right beside her.\\n\\n Sadie\u0027s arm was wrapped around Amanda\u0027s shoulders as she cried. I wondered how much my sister had shared with Sadie. I hadn\u0027t seen or spoken to Sadie in over two months. I missed being around her but it was just easier if I kept my distance. Sadie had been the one that got away for me. She\u0027d been snatched out of my reach by a freaking rock star as crazy as that sounds. Jax Stone, the hottest teen rock star in the world had been both mine and Sadie\u0027s employer last summer. We\u0027d worked as staff in his summer home located on the private island connected to Sea Breeze. One look at Sadie and he\u0027d been hooked.\\n\\n Unfortunately for me she returned the feelings.\\n\\n I parked my truck and headed over to get my sister.\\n\\n Sadie\u0027s concerned gaze met mine as I approached. I could tell by the look in her eyes she knew.\\n\\n \"Hey Sadie, thanks for being here for her,\" I said as I walked up and reached out a hand to my little sister. She threw herself at me and began weeping harder. I wanted to kill my dad with my own bare hands as her sobs shook her body. Damn him.\\n\\n \"She told me Marcus,\" Sadie said quietly, \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I nodded, \"Yeah, me too. He\u0027s an ass. A selfish bastard.\" Sadie didn\u0027t even flinch. She understood being furious with a parent. She\u0027d had her hands full with her mother until Jax Stone fell in love with her and proceeded to fix all her problems. Sadie\u0027s spoiled selfish mother, Jessica had been one of the things he fixed.\\n\\n \"I just want to get away from it all. Can I come back to your place?\" Amanda asked through her hiccups.\\n\\n \"Of course. Sadie, let the office know I have her would ya.\" She nodded and stood up, \"Of course and Marcus if there is anything I can do please don\u0027t hesitate to call me.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks Sadie\"\\n\\n I pulled my sister up tightly against my side and headed back to my truck. First I\u0027d deal with getting her calmed down then I was going to have a talk with my dad. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-3.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story… \\n Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \\n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \\n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
