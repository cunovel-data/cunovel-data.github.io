Watching her bury herself in Cage\u0027s arms had been more than I could handle. The jealousy that he was the one she went to ate me alive. I was second best. Again. But this time it was ripping me apart.\\n\\n Sadie hadn\u0027t consumed me this way. She hadn\u0027t owned me. Low did.\\n\\n The door opened slowly and I turned my head to see Will ow stepping inside the room. I watched as she closed the door behind her. The worry and fear in her eyes killed me but I didn\u0027t go to her. She hadn\u0027t wanted me. It had been Cage she wanted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you saw me like that,\" she said in a small voice.\\n\\n That\u0027s why she was sorry?\\n\\n \"You turned to him. Not me.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened in surprise.\\n\\n \"I was having an anxiety attack. I was focused on breathing.\\n\\n When I heard Cage\u0027s voice I knew he\u0027d helped me through it. He\u0027s had to help me through a lot of them.\"\\n\\n \"I could have helped you.\"\\n\\n Her eyes glistened with unshed tears and she took a tentative step toward me then stopped.\\n\\n \"I needed Cage because the attack had to do with Cage. I needed reassurance from him.\"\\n\\n What?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" I said sitting up and watching her take another step in my direction.\\n\\n \"You see, Cage has never left me. My father left me. My mother left me. My sister left me. Cage never left me. When people would leave me, he was always there. He is the one person I\u0027ve always depended on. I\u0027ve always known no matter what he\u0027ll be there.\" She stopped and took a deep breath. \"When I opened the fridge and my drinks were gone, well that\u0027s never happened. I thought he was letting me go. I thought he was leaving me too.\" Ah damn.\\n\\n Standing up I closed the distance she\u0027d been afraid to bridge.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here. You have me.\"\\n\\n She gave me a sad smile.\\n\\n \"One day, whatever this is will end. Relationships always do. Then you\u0027ll leave me too.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d been hurt so much.\\n\\n I took her face in my hands and held her gaze.\\n\\n \"Listen to me. I\u0027m in love with you. Mad crazy in love with you. I\u0027m not going anywhere. Ever. You can\u0027t get rid of me.\" A tear rolled down her face and I swiped it with my thumb then kissed the tip of her nose.\\n\\n \"I really want to believe you and I think you really believe that but Marcus where I come from, people leave.\" If it took me the rest of my life I\u0027d prove to her I wasn\u0027t going anywhere. She just needed actions not words. Words she\u0027d heard before.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll spend the rest of my life proving it to you.\" She closed her eyes, \"I hope so,\" she whispered.\\n\\n I reached down and grabbed her hand and pulled her over to the bed. I\u0027d come up here thinking about doing a little more of what we\u0027d done this morning but things had changed. Now I just wanted to be the one who held her. I wanted to make it all better. Just me.\\n\\n I opened my eyes and the room was dark and I was alone in bed. Sitting up I ran my hands through my hair and stood up to go find Will ow. When I opened the bedroom door Larissa smiled up at me, \"Martus,\" she announced loudly.\\n\\n \"Princess,\" I replied smiling down at her. Two little arms lifted in the air and I reached down to pick her up. I\u0027d already learned that wordless demand.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were coming to visit me.\" She clapped,\"Martus pay.\"\\n\\n \"He just woke up Larissa, give him a minute,\" Will ow chided her as she walked out of the kitchen.\\n\\n \"I made some chicken fettucini alfredo if you want some.\\n\\n Tawny stopped by unexpectedly about an hour ago and dropped Larissa off. I\u0027m supposed to work tonight but if I didn\u0027t keep her she was going to leave her with this awful lady down the street all night long. I couldn\u0027t let her do that, so,\" she shrugged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep her.\"\\n\\n Will ow froze and stared at me.\\n\\n \"You will?\" the shock on her face hurt a little.\\n\\n \"Yeah, of course. I was going to stay here tonight anyway.\\n\\n She and I will build blocks and knock them over, play with spoons, we\u0027ll have a blast.\"\\n\\n A smile broke across Will ow\u0027s face that made me feel ten feet tall.\\n\\n \"Okay, um, thanks, I mean, wow, are you sure?\" I walked over to her and leaned over to place a quick kiss on her surprised little mouth.\\n\\n \"Very sure.\"\\n\\n \"Martus tiss,\" Larissa said happily then leaned over and laid a very wet kiss on my cheek.\\n\\n Will ow giggled, \"Alright you don\u0027t go stealing my man.\" Her man. I liked that a lot. A whole damn lot.\\n\\n \"Impossible. Even for adorable curly headed blondes,\" I assured her and ruffled Larissa\u0027s hair.\\n\\n \"Martus pay,\" Larissa announced again.\\n\\n \"Yeah I heard you chic. Let\u0027s go play,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"Wait aren\u0027t you hungry?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d forgot she\u0027d cooked. My stomach rumbled and I looked at Larissa.\\n\\n \"Can I eat first then we\u0027ll play. You can sit beside me and eat too.\"\\n\\n \"Bite bites\" Larissa responded.\\n\\n Turning to Will ow for a translation, Larissa proceeded to chant, \"Martus bite bites\"\\n\\n \"Bite bites is what she likes to call eating,\" Will ow explained.\\n\\n \"Makes complete sense to me,\" I replied and both girls giggled.\\n\\n Willow\\n\\n The television ill uminated the dark apartment when I stepped inside. There was no sound coming from the T.V.\\n\\n but The Tonight Show was on the screen. When my eyes adjusted, I found Marcus sound asleep on the couch with Larissa snuggled up on his chest also sound asleep.\\n\\n Blocks scattered the floor and what looked like cookie crumbs made a trail from the living room to the kitchen. My heart swelled. I loved him. I never thought this would happen. I never expected to love anyone else. Not this way.\\n\\n I picked up the blocks and stacked them back in the basket I kept here for when Larissa came over. Then I leaned down to whisper in Marcus\u0027s ear, \"I\u0027m home.\" His eyes blinked open then a sleepy smile greeted me.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he mumbled.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just going to take her and put her in bed with me. I\u0027ll get you a blanket and pillow.\"\\n\\n \"I can take her,\" he said starting to sit up. I placed my hand on his shoulder and pushed him back down.\\n\\n \"No, you stay put. I\u0027ll do it.\" I kissed the small frown between his eyebrows and took Larissa from his arms.\\n\\n After tucking her in and securing her with pillows I went back out to the couch with a pillow and blanket for Marcus.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t moved. He was exhausted no doubt. Keeping Larissa wasn\u0027t for the faint hearted. His eyes were closed.\\n\\n Long blond eyelashes brushed his cheekbones. I bent over him to put the pillow under his head when two hands grabbed my waist and pulled me down on top of him.\\n\\n \"Mmmm, that\u0027s better,\" he whispered before claiming my mouth. His mouth was sweet and gentle at first but the more I shifted my body the more aggressive the kiss became.\\n\\n The warmth of his mouth tasted like chocolate chip cookies and I couldn\u0027t get enough of him. I grasped the front of his shirt pulling him closer. His hands moved up my thighs and cupped my bottom squeezing and moaning as I pressed against him. We were going there again. Before we went any further I pulled back and looked down at him. The desire in his eyes undid me.\\n\\n desire in his eyes undid me.\\n\\n \"I love you too,\" I whispered.\\n\\n His eyes widened then his mouth was back on mine. This time wide awake and determined. I wanted all of him. There was no question in my mind. His hands were everywhere and I felt shaky all over from excitement. Breaking the kiss his hands started tugging on my shorts.\\n\\n \"Take these off,\" he demanded.\\n\\n I stood up nervous but so incredibly excited I couldn\u0027t keep from trembling. I wasn\u0027t sure if he wanted everything off.\\n\\n Raising my eyes I looked at him and he shook his head.\\n\\n \"Keep your panties on. I don\u0027t want our first time to be on this couch and if you take those off I\u0027m a goner.\" Smiling I crawled back on top of him and straddled him then once again got lost in Marcus Hardy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-16.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story… \\n Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \\n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \\n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
