{"id":73462,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Willow\\n\\n My sister wasn\u0027t going to let me stay the night. I slipped my hand into the pocket of my jeans and squeezed the key Cage had given me. As much as I feared wearing out my welcome I needed somewhere to stay. Besides I\u0027d left my suitcase in Cage\u0027s bedroom this morning. To pay him back for yet another night this week I\u0027d do our laundry this evening. Feeling somewhat better about being a freaking charity case I headed for the stairs.\\n\\n \"Low, hey gorgeous it\u0027s been too long,\" Preston flashed me his pretty boy smile and tucked a strand of white blond hair behind his ear. The boy knew his affect on females but apparently he hadn\u0027t picked up on his lack of affect on me.\\n\\n \"hello Preston and yes it has. I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re not around more now that your friend is living here.\" A small frown puckered Preston\u0027s forehead. He glanced back up the steps at the door to the apartment then turned back to me.\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah well about Marcus. He\u0027s having a bad day. His sister is up there and she\u0027s really upset over some family stuff they\u0027ve got going on. Why don\u0027t you and I go grab something to eat and head over to hear Jackdown play over at Live Bay tonight that is if you\u0027re not working tonight. I haven\u0027t seen Dewayne and Rock in awhile. I\u0027m sure Dewayne would love to see you.\"\\n\\n Going to listen to Jackdown wasn\u0027t what I needed to do tonight. I had a fair amount of homework and tomorrow I would be working a double shift at the restaurant side of Live Bay. However, I also didn\u0027t want to intrude on a family problem. I knew enough about those kind of problems to know Marcus needed some privacy.\\n\\n \"Um, okay, sounds good. Uh,\" I glanced back toward the stairs, \"Do you think maybe I could run in and change real quick. I\u0027ll just go straight to Cage\u0027s room and come right back out.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yeah that\u0027s fine. I just meant they needed some time alone. They\u0027re probably in Marcus\u0027 bedroom anyway and I doubt they even hear you come in. Come on I\u0027ll go with you and grab a drink while you change.\"\\n\\n I slipped my hand into my pocket and pulled out my key feeling the strange warmth inside me at the sight of it. It was odd how something so small made me feel secure.\\n\\n We stepped inside and I left Preston in the kitchen as I stepped into Cage\u0027s room. I could hear talking coming from Marcus\u0027s closed bedroom door as I\u0027d passed by it. Maybe I could get out of here before they realized I\u0027d come in.\\n\\n Marcus seemed okay with my being here a lot. I didn\u0027t want that to change.\\n\\n I slipped into a short jean skirt and put on an emerald green halter top and then pulled on the black leather jacket Cage had given me for Christmas two years ago. My cowboy boots sat in his closet lined up beside his and I laughed at this small hint from Cage. He wanted me here. That much was obvious. The boy had no clue how impossible he made things.\\n\\n Stepping out of the bedroom I noticed Preston and Marcus whispering in the living room. I halted not wanting to intrude when Marcus eyes met mine. Slowly his green eyes traveled down my body and back up causing my pulse to race. I stood frozen in my spot until his eyes found mine again.\\n\\n \"Damn girl let\u0027s get your sexy ass out of here before Cage shows up. He\u0027ll have me hung up by my balls and you changing clothes while he stands guard at the door.\" Preston\u0027s words were meant to break the silence but it only made Marcus\u0027s eyes flare up.\\n\\n \"Um, okay, good idea,\" I forced a smile and then willed my legs to move until I was beside Preston. His arm slipped around my shoulders and he leaned his head down and sniffed me. \"Mmmm... you even smell good.\" Marcus cleared his throat loudly causing Preston to chuckle.\\n\\n \"Go deal with Manda bro. I just gave y\u0027all the privacy you need. Cage has a date with some girl from Monroevil e down here for spring break. And I intend to keep this one out late.\"\\n\\n My face heated up at the insinuation in his voice. Surely Marcus knew I wasn\u0027t going to be out doing what Preston made it sound like I would be doing. What was wrong with him anyway? He never laid his flirting on this thick.\\n\\n \"Good night Marcus, I hope you get things worked out.\" I managed to say in a calm voice with no hint to the frenzy his attention had sent my pulse into.\\n\\n He nodded and turned around without a word.\\n\\n Marcus\\n\\n Cowboy boots. Did she have to wear freaking cowboy boots with that tiny little skirt? I slammed the refrigerator door without getting a drink. A beer sounded really good after watching Preston walk out with Will ow tucked against his side. But Amanda needed me. I couldn\u0027t drink even if right now all I wanted to do was get really trashed and forget this crazy mess my dad had laid in my lap.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027re you slamming things?\" Amanda asked stepping out of my bedroom.\\n\\n I shrugged not wanting to share with my sister how I was having a small melt down over a girl I\u0027d just met while we had bigger issues to deal with.\\n\\n \"Does it have anything to do with the girl\u0027s voice I just heard in here with Preston?\"\\n\\n Slumping into a kitchen chair I glanced up at her intending to tell her \"no\" and instead replied, \"Yeah\".\\n\\n Amanda frowned at me and pulled the chair across from me out from under the table before sitting in it.\\n\\n \"Is Preston dating her?\"\\n\\n \"No, not if he doesn\u0027t want a death wish.\" Amanda\u0027s eyebrows shot up in surprise, \"You mean you like her enough to fight Preston over her?\"\\n\\n \"Not me. Cage. He thinks he\u0027s going to marry Low.\" Amanda laughed, \"Cage married? Has he gone from smoking pot to crack recently?\"\\n\\n It sounded ludicrous to me too but she hadn\u0027t seen him with Will ow. He was different with her. He actually gave a shit.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s complicated.\"\\n\\n Amanda picked at the red fringe on the placemat in front of her. The placemats were just another one of those small touches around this place that Will ow had a hand in.\\n\\n Preston was as bad as Cage when it came to women. I hated knowing he was out with Will ow.\\n\\n \"I need to get home to Mom. I\u0027d say you could come with me but the awful scowl on your face would frighten her. You need to go get changed into something sexy and go after the girl. Preston wouldn\u0027t have taken her if he knew you liked her this much. Heck , he probably took her somewhere just to get her out of the apartment for our sake.\"\\n\\n She was right. At least I hoped she was right. I stood up and glanced down at the faded jeans and Alabama football t-shirt I had on.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with the way I\u0027m dressed?\" Amanda sighed and stood up. \"Come on my clueless brother. I\u0027ll make you look irresistible. Trust me, okay. I mean the last girl you liked you completely let slip through your fingers. I\u0027d say you need my help.\"\\n\\n \"I was up against a rock star Manda. It wasn\u0027t exactly a fair game.\"\\n\\n Amanda shrugged, \"Maybe so but Preston and Cage are no Jax Stone. This time you\u0027re definitely the hottie in the group.\"\\n\\n \"Did you just call me a hottie? And Jax isn\u0027t better looking than me. He\u0027s just famous.\"\\n\\n Amanda let out a loud cackle of laughter.\\n\\n \"No brother dear, Jax Stone is hotness incarnate with or without the guitar and sexy as hell singing voice. You never stood a chance. He was what you call playing with the big dogs. This time you\u0027re definitely playing within your league.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever, just tell me what to wear and get out of here.\\n\\n You\u0027re pissing me off.\"\\n\\n Willow\\n\\n \"You want a beer?\" Preston asked pushing us through the crowd of people toward a table with familiar faces.\\n\\n \"No thanks. But a Coke would be good,\" I replied loudly so he could hear me over the music. Jackdown hadn\u0027t taken the stage yet but the band on before them had the crowd on their feet. From the sound of the band it was probably the alcohol that had them all on their feet screaming and dancing. The band wasn\u0027t that good. Jackdown was the reason the crowd was here tonight. They always drew a crowd from the locals.\\n\\n \"Okay, go on over there and sit with Rock, Trisha and Dewayne. I\u0027ll get our drinks and meet you there.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Rock and Dewayne were friends of Preston\u0027s I\u0027d gotten to know through Cage over the past year. Trisha was Rock\u0027s wife. They reminded me of Kid Rock, with a shaved head, and Pamela Anderson. Trisha wasn\u0027t very natural but she could definitely find success as a centerfold if she ever wanted to. That or an exotic dancer. Dewayne noticed me first and a smile spread across his face. His long dredlocks were pulled back in a ponytail tonight and the shirt he was wearing was snug enough to show off his impressive chiseled body.\\n\\n \"Low!\" Dewayne called out in greeting as I came up to their table. Trisha smiled brightly at me and gave me a small finger wiggling wave, \"Hey girl. Didn\u0027t know you were coming tonight. When we talked to Cage he said he had some date tonight with a girl and he doubted they\u0027d be leaving her hotel room.\"\\n\\n Rock nudged Trisha and she flashed a frown at him,\\n\\n \"What? Low isn\u0027t an idiot. The girl knows Cage is a slut.\"\\n\\n \"God baby drop it,\" Rock begged.\\n\\n I shook my head and laughed taking the chair beside Dewayne. \"She\u0027s right Rock. I know where he is and what he\u0027s doing. Just because he tells the world he\u0027s going to marry me doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m going to marry him. The boy is crazy. It doesn\u0027t bother me at all who he\u0027s with and what he\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n Rock nodded then a small frown creased his forehead. \"So you came by yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Nope, she\u0027s with me,\" Preston announced as he placed a Coke in front of me and took the chair on the other side of me.\\n\\n \"Ah shit man,\" Rock moaned and Dewayne joined in with a frustrated sigh.\\n\\n \"What? Marcus and Manda were having some family issues and he was dealing with her at the apartment. So I figured Low and I could come hang with you guys and hear Krit.\"\\n\\n \"Bad move,\" Dewayne mumbled before taking a swig of his beer.\\n\\n \"Whatever, Cage won\u0027t care. Besides he\u0027s out banging some girl tonight from Monroevil e.\"\\n\\n \"As fascinating as this conversation is I think it\u0027s up to Low to decide what she does and who she does it with. Cage isn\u0027t her daddy. Everyone stop acting like she belongs to him and let her have a life,\" Trisha\u0027s annoyed tone shut everyone up and I was grateful.\\n\\n She stood up and held her hand out to me, \"Come on girl.\\n\\n You and I are going to go shake it out there and create a stir to give these boys something to do.\" I frowned, \"What will they do?\"\\n\\n She took my hand and pulled me up. \"Threaten and scowl and possibly man handle all the guys who\u0027re going to drool over us.\"\\n\\n I could hear Rock\u0027s growl as we pushed our way into the crowd.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you get tired of everyone acting like you\u0027re Cage\u0027s property?\" Trisha asked pulling me closer to her as we made our way to the front of the crowd. Jackdown would be on in a few minutes and I knew she was getting us to the front so we could see them. And so Krit could see me.\\n\\n She\u0027d been trying to fix me and her brother up for months now. Cage always seemed to ice her attempts but tonight Cage wasn\u0027t here.\\n\\n \"Cage is all I\u0027ve got. He\u0027s my best friend and I overlook his issues. If a guy comes around worth fighting over I won\u0027t let Cage stand in my way. But so far he hasn\u0027t kept me from anyone I really want.\"\\n\\n Trisha studied me a moment. She didn\u0027t like my answer. I could see it on her face. \"But if you don\u0027t date around how will you know when the right one comes along?\" I shrugged thinking about Marcus and pushing that thought immediately out of my mind. He was so not even close to my league. That was pointless to even fantasize about.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll just know.\"\\n\\n She shrugged and started to say something when the lights went down and the sound of Krit\u0027s electric guitar squealed out sending the crowd into a frenzy of screams and cheers.\\n\\n out sending the crowd into a frenzy of screams and cheers.\\n\\n \"Here we go,\" she replied smiling and turning her attention to the stage. Smoke had engulfed the stage. Krit stepped out of the smoke into the single spotlight as he made the chords on his guitar sing. His long blond hair was so similar in color to Trisha\u0027s it made me think maybe hers wasn\u0027t out of a bottle after all. Instead of pulling his hair back he let it fall down over his naked shoulders. Which was a trademark for Krit. He never wore a shirt on stage. The jeans he wore hung loosely on his hips giving the females and probably some of the males a thril from the small peek of hip bone he flashed. His chest wasn\u0027t as broad and muscular as Dewayne and Rock\u0027s but he had lean muscle and a very obvious six pack that was covered on the right side by a coiled snake tattoo.\\n\\n The rest of the band stepped out of the smoke and Green\u0027s voice joined the electric guitar. Green was Krit\u0027s best friend and the bass player slash alternate singer in the group. Krit was the lead singer but Green could sing too and he got several songs in each set. Green almost looked like Krit\u0027s dark headed twin. The same long hair in a dark brown.\\n\\n Except Green wore a shirt of tattoos. His entire chest and arms were covered in tats. Looking at Green one would never guess he was in his second year of law school. A girl to the right of me starting screaming his name along with a few rather colorful things she wanted to do to him after the show. Shaking my head to clear the mental images I so did not ask for, I glanced toward the back of the stage at the drummer, Matty. His bright orange hair stuck straight up. It wasn\u0027t short either. The guy had to use a ton of hair product to get that stuff to stick up like he did. His chest was covered with a tight black t-shirt and although he was sitting behind the drums I knew his jeans would be just as tight.\\n\\n The boy liked his skinny jeans.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait until he sees you down here,\" Trisha squealed excitedly in my ear.\\n\\n I really just wanted to dance. Getting Krit\u0027s attention was the last thing on my mind. I turned my attention toward, the keyboard player, Legend. He was a hairy guy. He had a full on beard which was weird for a twenty four year old guy but he was proud of his hair. His shaggy brown hair was just long enough to tuck behind his ears and his jeans hugged his hips tightly and hung low enough to show off his flat stomach where his tight Aerosmith t-shirt that could have been mine it was so small, didn\u0027t meet his waist line.\\n\\n Krit\u0027s voice joined in with Green and they began their most popular original song, \"Aces\".\\n\\n Krit\u0027s bright blue eyes, which I happened to know were enhanced by the help of contacts, found me. No one\u0027s eyes were that electric blue. Cage had informed me of their false color when I\u0027d first met Krit and commented on his eyes.\\n\\n Krit winked at me and licked his lips suggestively. I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. The guy was outrageous. Not my type at all but very entertaining. His naked chest wasn\u0027t hard to look at either.\\n\\n \"I knew he\u0027d love having you up close,\" Trisha yelled over the music. Smiling I let my body move to the music.\\n\\n After several songs and several dance partners, I made my way back through the crowd toward our table. My mouth felt like cotton. I needed my Coke even if it was probably watered down by this point. Preston was talking to a girl with wild curly brown hair. I smiled to myself thinking I just might need to snag a ride home with Trisha and Rock.\\n\\n Feeling eyes on me, I turned my attention to the other people at the table. Marcus was sitting in the chair Trisha had vacated earlier. I hadn\u0027t expected to see him here tonight.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said walking up to the table unsure where I should sit since the brunette talking to Preston was in my seat.\\n\\n \"Low, you\u0027re back. Here,\" Preston stood up from his seat,\\n\\n \"sit down. You thirsty? Your ice melted. I\u0027ll get you another Coke.\"\\n\\n \"No, Preston sit back down. I\u0027m good. You continue your conversation. I\u0027ll go get my own drink.\" He didn\u0027t sit down and his expression looked unsure. Chuckling at his obvious confusion, I turned and headed for the bar. Preston didn\u0027t just have pretty platinum blond hair. He was really as air headed as one would imagine someone with his surfer boy good looks to be.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t seem to know any better. I\u0027m sorry.\" Marcus\u0027s voice was low and close to my ear. A shiver ran through me from the warmth of his breath tickling my neck.\\n\\n He\u0027d followed me. The goofy smile on my face was unavoidable.\\n\\n \"Preston\u0027s a sweetheart. I overlook him. Besides it isn\u0027t like I\u0027m his date.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not?\"\\n\\n I turned my head slightly so I could meet Marcus\u0027s gaze,\\n\\n \"No, of course not. It\u0027s Preston. We\u0027re just friends.\" A smile lifted the corners of Marcus\u0027s mouth making it hard for me to look away. The boy was just down right sexy.\\n\\n \"Do you go out as friends with him often?\"\\n\\n \"No. Not really. I mean when I do I\u0027m normally with Cage too. But tonight he felt like you needed some alone time with your sister.\"\\n\\n His smile vanished and a frown replaced it as he nodded.\\n\\n We reached the bar and Marcus came up behind me caging me in with his arms on each side of me. The small thril from his warm body pressing against my backside had me fighting the urge to snuggle in closer. I reminded myself that he was doing this to keep me from getting crushed in the sea of people swarming the bar. It was a protective gesture. Nothing more. But I liked it.\\n\\n \"Ricky! Two Cokes make one a stiff.\"\\n\\n The bartender looked our way and gave Marcus a short nod and started fixing our drinks. That was quick service. It helped to be a local around here.\\n\\n \"When did you get here?\" I asked Marcus as we waited on our drinks.\\n\\n \"About two minutes before you walked up. I was about to come find you and see if I could convince you to dance with me.\"\\n\\n The acute sense of losing out struck me. Pressing against Marcus while we moved our bodies to the music would have ranked on one of my favorite moments in life list.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" was all I could manage in reply. My heart was racing from the fantasy playing out in my head. Being wrapped up in Marcus clean masculine scent didn\u0027t help matters.I was having a strange but oh-so-pleasing fantasy of crawling up under his shirt and licking his chest when our drinks were placed in front of us. Marcus slapped some money down and took our drinks. He nodded his head back toward our table and I instantly missed his touch. Withholding my pathetic sigh I led the way back to our friends.\\n\\n Preston had moved the brunette to his lap leaving me an empty seat beside the two of them. Awesome.\\n\\n \"I thought you were leaving,\" Marcus said to Preston as I sat down in the vacated seat.\\n\\n Preston took a swig of his beer and glanced up at the girl in his lap. Her red fingernails were playing with his silky blond locks.\\n\\n \"You going with me?\" He asked her.\\n\\n She giggled and nodded sending her curls bobbing all around her shoulders. He looked around her at me, \"Is it okay if I leave you with Marcus? He said he\u0027d give you a ride home.\"\\n\\n YES! I managed to mask my pleasure at the change of plans and nodded, \"Of course.\"\\n\\n Preston grinned and stood up with his arm wrapped snuggly around the girl\u0027s waist. \"See y\u0027all later.\" I gave a small wave while I took a long drink of my Coke.\\n\\n Rock was still on the dance floor with Trisha and I had no idea where Dewayne had gone. It was just Marcus and me.\\n\\n Staring down at my glass of Coke and running my finger through the condensation trickling down the sides of it became fascinating, or so it would seem. I didn\u0027t know what to say and I suddenly felt awkward.\\n\\n \"Thanks for giving Manda and me some privacy today but you don\u0027t ever have to feel like you can\u0027t stay at the apartment. No matter what\u0027s going on with me you\u0027re always welcome.\"\\n\\n I lifted my gaze from my glass and smiled at him. \"Thanks.\\n\\n But I have family issues often and I know privacy is always best.\"\\n\\n He frowned and took a long sip of his drink that I was pretty sure was mixed with whisky. \"Well I\u0027ll be having a lot of family issues over the next few months so don\u0027t worry about me. If Manda shows up crying or is tucked away in my room don\u0027t ever feel like you have to leave. Stay. I\u0027d rather you stay than run off somewhere.\"\\n\\n Had he come looking for me? Surely not.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I wasn\u0027t going to argue with him. Although if that happened again I would not stick around and make them uncomfortable. But there was no point in arguing.\\n\\n \"Hey bro! I didn\u0027t know you were here. Day-um it feels good to have you showing up on a weekday. I miss your ugly mug when it\u0027s off at college.\" Dewayne slapped Marcus on the back and took the chair beside me grinning. Dewayne, Rock, Marcus and Preston had grown up together.\\n\\n According to Cage they were all really tight. A strange combination if you ask me. Marcus was the rich man\u0027s son although he sure didn\u0027t live like it and Rock owned his own parasailing company, Preston had no purpose in life but surfing, baseball and girls, then Dewayne was well.... I wasn\u0027t sure what he was. He looked dark and dangerous with tats and dreds, but his personality reminded me of a big teddy bear. He was always so nice and easy to talk to .\\n\\n \"I needed to get out and my roomies had both left me for the night so I followed the pretty one here.\" Did Marcus just call me pretty?\\n\\n Dewayne chuckled, \"Don\u0027t let Cage hear you call her pretty.\\n\\n He goes ape shit when guys mention Miss Will ow\u0027s attractiveness,\" Dewayne winked at me and lit up a cigarette leaning back in his chair.\\n\\n \"Cage is full of hot air,\" I assured them both but mostly Marcus who I did not want to scare off if there was any chance at all he might be interested in me.\\n\\n Dewayne let out a laugh as smoke wafted out his noise and mouth. \"Naw, baby, he\u0027s dead serious. I\u0027ve seen him in action when someone said something about you. It ain\u0027t pretty.\"\\n\\n Shut up Dewayne. I glanced over at Marcus and he was frowning again. Dangit, I needed to stop Dewayne and his mouth.\\n\\n \"Marcus! Hey you! I had no idea you were back in town.\\n\\n Why haven\u0027t you called me? I\u0027m hurt.\" She was gorgeous.\\n\\n Figures, tall blond and all will owy. Just like the girls Cage is so fond of.\\n\\n \"Jess,\" Marcus stood up and hugged the girl. My insides cringed.\\n\\n \"Come dance with me,\" she pleaded not letting go of her hold on him. She looked around him and smiled brightly at Dewayne. \"Hey D! How ya doin\u0027 baby?\"\\n\\n He nodded, \"Good Jess. You broke up with that wanker again?\"\\n\\n She scowled, \"Yes for over a month. He got someone pregnant this time. I can\u0027t forgive that.\" Dewayne let out a low whistle, \"Ouch... guess not. Daddy Hank. Never thought I\u0027d hear that one.\" She shrugged and pulled Marcus closer. \"It\u0027s okay, I got me a handful of Marcus Hardy to make it all better,\" she cooed.\\n\\n Marcus glanced down at me and I forced a smile then turned my attention to the stage that Jackdown had just returned to after their break. I couldn\u0027t watch him walk away with her. Seeing him with someone like her just reminded me of how out of my reach he was. \"One dance,\" I heard Marcus say.\\n\\n Jess squealed and led him into the crowd.\\n\\n I would not think about it. I would not think about it.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s Rock\u0027s cousin. He couldn\u0027t turn her down.\" Dewayne\u0027s voice interrupted my mental chant. My face instantly heated at his words. He could tell it bothered me.\\n\\n Well that was freaking perfect. Now I was really pathetic.\\n\\n The low class plain jane crushing on Marcus Hardy.\\n\\n Suddenly I wanted to leave. I wanted Cage. I needed to feel safe.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t bother me. I didn\u0027t come here with him.\" That didn\u0027t even sound believable. My voice had cracked for crying out loud.\\n\\n \"Hmmmm,\" was all Dewayne said through drags off his cigarette.\\n\\n \"I need some fresh air and I need to make a phone call,\" I said standing up. Dewayne raised his eyebrows and then nodded. I didn\u0027t need his all-knowing eyes on me. I headed for the door. Away from the warmth of the overcrowded bar and Dewayne\u0027s cigarette smoke blowing in my face. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-4.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.
