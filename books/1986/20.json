I searched through her things looking for her sister\u0027s phone number. Nothing. My phone dinged and I scrambled to grab it. A text from Amanda. Not what I\u0027d been hoping for. \"Mom needs you. Hurry please.\" Shit. I needed to find Will ow. I didn\u0027t have time for family drama. Dad no doubt had done something new and sent mom into a spiraling mess. \"Where are you Low,\" I growled in frustration staring down at my phone trying to decide who to call. Who would know where she was? \"I\u0027m here,\" her voice was so soft I almost didn\u0027t hear her over the chaos in my head. I spun around and found her standing in our bedroom doorway. She looked devastated. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked rushing to her and pulling her into my arms. Red swol en eyes and a tear streaked face were just the beginning of what was wrong with her. Her arms didn\u0027t embrace me in return. Instead she stood limp. \"Low, you\u0027re scaring me,\" I said into her hair needing some kind of reaction from her. She didn\u0027t respond. My phone went off again and I ignored it. Tightening my hold on her I waited hoping she\u0027d say something. Anything. My phone started ringing. Frustrated I grabbed it and started to decline it when I saw it was Amanda. Something had to really be wrong. \"What Manda, I\u0027m busy at the moment.\" \"She\u0027s taken something Marcus! Help me!\" Her screams came through the phone so loud Will ow jerked in my arms. She\u0027d heard her. \"Who? Mom took something?\" My heart was pounding in my chest. Oh God no. \"YES! She won\u0027t wake up. I called 911 but I can\u0027t find a pulse! Help me!\" she wailed. \"I\u0027m coming. Keep her alive Manda. You hear me! Keep her breathing. Do mouth to mouth. Something!\" Will ow had stood back from my embrace and her face was chalk white. I needed to deal with what was bothering her but my mother\u0027s life hung in the balance right now and I couldn\u0027t. \"Low, I gotta go.\" She nodded, \"Hurry,\" she said frantically. I could see the horror in her eyes. She\u0027d heard every word Amanda had said. She understood. I wasn\u0027t leaving her. She knew that. I bolted for the door. Please God don\u0027t let my Mama die. Five hours later, my mother\u0027s stomach had been pumped and she was being given fluids through an IV. My sister hadn\u0027t been able to find a pulse because in her panic she wasn\u0027t looking in the right place. But she had been right about one thing. Mom had taken a bottle of pain pills. The divorce papers had been signed by my dad and had been clutched against her chest when I\u0027d got there. Mom\u0027s eyes flickered open and she focused on me. I moved from my stance against the wall where I\u0027d stood for over an hour watching her, willing her to open her eyes. \"Marcus,\" she whispered. I grabbed her hand and nodded. Suddenly I wasn\u0027t a twenty-one year old man. I was a little boy. Scared and in need of his mama to hold him and tell him everything was going to be okay. Seeing them lift her lifeless body onto the gurney and take her from the house was a nightmare I never wanted to relive. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered. \"Shh Mama. Don\u0027t talk. It\u0027s okay just promise you\u0027ll never do that to me again. I can\u0027t handle that Mama. I can\u0027t.\" I squeezed her hand and she let out a small sob. I didn\u0027t want her to cry. Not now. She needed to recover. \"He left me. Took her with him. Moved to Mobile,\" she said in a hoarse whisper. I reached and got the glass of water and straw the nurse had left a few minutes ago. She\u0027d said Mom would need it when she woke up. \"Here Mama take a small sip. I don\u0027t want to talk about him. He\u0027s gone. We\u0027re all still here and we aren\u0027t going anywhere.\" She obediently took a small sip of water and laid her head back against the pillow. \"I love you,\" she said staring up at me with sad eyes. \"I love you too. Manda and I need you Mama. You can\u0027t try to leave us again. We need you.\" I spoke gently but forcefully. I needed her to understand that just because our father had cast her off we never would. She was important to us. \"I need you too.\" I nodded, \"Good. Now take another drink.\" \"You\u0027re awake.\" I glanced back as Amanda ran toward the bed and hovered over our broken mother. \"Oh Mama, you\u0027re okay. You\u0027re awake,\" she gushed. Mom reached for Amanda\u0027s hand with her other hand and grasp hers. \"I\u0027m sorry. I won\u0027t do this ever again. I had a weak moment.\" She explained slowly looking up at my sister. Amanda sniffed back tears before crawling up on the bed and curling up beside mom. \"My baby girl,\" Mom cooed and kissed Amanda\u0027s forehead. They were here and they were safe. It was going to be okay. I could do this. I could hold this family together. I\u0027d do whatever I had to do. Low would help me. Mom loved her. We\u0027d make it through this. Willow Cage saw me the minute he exited the dugout. Frowning, he made his way over to me. I\u0027d never come to his practice before. I could see the question and concern on his face. \"Low, what\u0027s wrong?\" He asked when he reached me. I felt the sob inside me well up and I covered my mouth to silence it. His eyes widened and he reached for my hand. \"Come on,\" he said pulling me with him. Away from the curious eyes of his teammates. He led us straight to his car and opened the passenger side door. \"Get in.\" I didn\u0027t argue. I climbed in. the familiar smell of safety surrounded me and my eyes filled with tears. Cage would always be my safe place. Because once Marcus knew the truth, I was going to lose him. He was going to leave me too. And I didn\u0027t blame him. Cage climbed into the driver\u0027s seat then turned to look at me. \"What happened and whose ass do I need to beat?\" I shook my head, \"No ones. Oh Cage it\u0027s awful. It\u0027s worse than I could\u0027ve ever even imagined.\" \"Nothing\u0027s that bad baby. Ever. And if it is I\u0027ll fix it.\" \"You can\u0027t fix this Cage. This is unfixable.\" \"Nothing\u0027s unfixable\" \"Larissa and Marcus have the same father,\" I yelled fisting my hands over my eyes as another sob rattled my chest. Silence. I\u0027d rendered him speechless. \"The married man Tawny\u0027s been screwing is Marcus\u0027s father. Jefferson HARDY just left his wife for my sister.\" \"Fuck.\" I dropped my hands in my lap and looked at Cage\u0027s horrified expression. \"How do you know? I mean how did you find out? Does Marcus know?\" \"She met me outside my class today. Driving a brand new Mercedes SUV. Told me that Larissa\u0027s daddy had left his wife and they were moving to Mobile. He\u0027d bought them a fancy new house and he was moving in with them. Then she handed me a check for what she called debt she owed me and left.\" I reached into my pocket and pulled out the check and handed it to Cage. \"Holy Mother.\" \"Look who wrote me the check Cage. Not the amount.\" He lifted his blue eyes to me, \"Low, baby, I\u0027m so sorry. She just keeps fucking your life up.\" \"I knew he had family problems and I knew he hated his dad and he was worried about his mother. But God, Cage I\u0027d have never in a million years have guessed this.\" Cage reached over and grasped my hand in his, \"I\u0027m here. You got me. You know that.\" I knew that. But it wasn\u0027t my losing Cage I was worried about. \"I need to talk to her, him, both of them. I need to go see Tawny and Jefferson, Marcus\u0027s dad. I have to find a way to tell Marcus and not lose him. I can\u0027t lose him Cage.\" Cage cranked up the car, \"Buckle up and type their address into my GPS.\" I quickly did as I was told then lay my head back on the seat, closed my eyes and prayed I\u0027d find a way to make this okay. It was dark when we pulled up to the large two story brick home inside the gated golf course community that my sister and niece now lived. Cage pulled into their driveway and I sat staring up at the home in front of me. Lights were on in almost every room in the house. They were here. It was time to find some answers. To understand what had happened. I just needed some way to keep Marcus. I glanced down at my phone again. Marcus hadn\u0027t texted me since his last text two hours ago telling me his mother was doing fine. He hadn\u0027t explained what happened. I thought I\u0027d heard his sister say something about calling 911 but apparently that hadn\u0027t happened. Amanda must\u0027ve overreacted. If his mother had gone to the hospital he\u0027d have told me. He\u0027d have wanted me there. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go do this,\" Cage said opening my car door. I\u0027d been so lost in thought I hadn\u0027t even noticed he\u0027d gotten out of the car. I stood up and we walked to the front double doors together. Seeing those two large double doors reminded me of the other house this man owned. The one where he\u0027d raised Amanda and Marcus. The one he\u0027d abandoned. I reached out and pressed the doorbel then waited. Jefferson Hardy opened the door. A surprised expression lit his eyes as he stood back . \"Will ow, please come in. Larissa was just talking about you.\" He remembered my name. I stepped inside and Cage was right behind me. \"Who is it?\" Tawny asked as she appeared at the top of the large elegant wooden staircase. She froze and her gaze shifted from me to Cage and back. \"Low what\u0027re you doing here?\" She was annoyed. Good. I was devastated. \"I need to talk to you,\" I turned to look back at Jefferson, \"and him.\" Jefferson and Tawny exchanged looks while I waited. \"Okay, well Tawny why don\u0027t you get Larissa and come on down here. She\u0027ll be thrilled to see Will ow.\" This man was playing house so easily. As if he hadn\u0027t just abandoned another family. The one he\u0027d had for more years than Tawny had been alive. \"follow me,\" Jefferson said smiling at me and then turned to lead us down a hallway and then into a large living room already furnished with several large leather chairs big enough for two and a huge sectional sofa. The largest flatscreen I\u0027d ever seen hung on the wall and a gas fire crackled in the fire place. Wasn\u0027t this just cozy. \"Can I offer you something to drink?\" Jefferson asked. I shook my head. \"No,\" was Cage\u0027s only reply. I felt like he was my silent bodyguard. It helped knowing he was here. \"My Lowlow,\" Larissa squealed in obvious delight when Tawny walked into the room carrying Larissa on her hip. Her hair was damp from a bath and she was in a pair of pajamas I\u0027d never seen before. They looked soft, frilly and expensive. Seeing Larissa in something so nice just added to the mass of emotions swirling around inside me. I wanted the best for Larissa. I wanted her to have a daddy who loved her and was there for her. But what about the other little girl this man had. The teenage one who was falling apart from his betrayal. I wanted to scream in frustration. Tawny put Larissa down and she ran to me her arms up in the air. I bent down and picked her up and nuzzled her sweet neck. She smelled so good. Like a baby should smell. A healthy, loved baby. \"Hey my favorite princess,\" I whispered in her ear. \"Lowlow,\" she smiled up at me. \"I missed you,\" I told her and she clapped happily and then planted a wet kiss on my cheek. \"CAY!\" she squealed when her eyes found Cage and she wiggled in my arms to get to him. \"Hey gorgeous,\" he replied taking her from my arms. I turned to look back at my sister and Jefferson. \"I didn\u0027t know until today who you were, exactly.\" I said, staring straight at Jefferson. \"It wasn\u0027t your business Low,\" Tawny snapped coming to stand beside him wrapping her arm around his. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. It unfortunately is my business\" \"Larissa is mine and Jefferson\u0027s. Just because we---\" \"Tawny shut up. You have no idea what I came here to say. So just let me talk. For once.\" I watched as my sister\u0027s eyes glowed with anger. Jefferson patted her hand soothingly. \"Let\u0027s hear her out sweetheart.\" I closed my eyes wishing with everything I had that I could reverse this. I could stop this. That Larissa could belong to another man. An unmarried man who would love her and take care of her. Not this one. \"Cage, can you and Larissa go exploring please?\" I asked not looking back at him. \"Yep.\" I saw Jefferson\u0027s displeasure. \"He\u0027s taken care of your daughter more times than you have, I can assure you. She\u0027s in very good hands.\" I hadn\u0027t won a fan with that comment but it was a fact. \"Today when I got that check, I saw Jefferson\u0027s last name for the first time. You had never mentioned it to me before. And you always refused to tell me where you worked. I figured it was because the affair you were having was with someone at work.\" \"I didn\u0027t tell you because it wasn\u0027t your business,\" Tawny snarled. \"Again, that\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. You see something has happened that makes this a very real issue for me. I hated knowing you were tearing a family apart. I hated knowing you were destroying another marriage.\" \"My marriage has been over a long time Will ow,\" Jefferson began and I glared up at him. \"Really? Because when you didn\u0027t show up to the family dinner your wife had so lovingly prepared and your daughter and son had shown up expecting to see their father it destroyed them. I watched it. I witnessed your wife put on a smile that didn\u0027t match the heartbreak in her eyes. I watched your son\u0027s hatred for you grow even stronger and I watched your daughter, the other one who still needs her daddy especially right now, while her world is falling apart, do everything she could to make her mother and brother smile. I had a front row seat, Mr. Hardy.\" \"What in the hell are you ranting about Low?\" Tawny yelled over me. \"I met a guy. For the first time in my life I fell in love. I let down my walls. I found someone who makes me laugh. Who gives me hope. I love him with everything I have in me. But he\u0027s dealing with a mother who\u0027s completely shattered. A little sister who is scared and he\u0027s doing all he can to fix it for them. While his father is off playing house with you.\" \"Marcus,\" Jefferson said with a heavy sigh. He understood. He got it. \"Yes, Marcus,\" I replied still glaring at my sister. \"So you see the predicament I\u0027m in. I love Marcus Hardy so much that I\u0027d give up anything for him. Anything. Anything but Larissa. I can\u0027t see a way out of this. He won\u0027t have anything to do with me when he finds this out. My sister is the reason his family is destroyed. The reason he got a call today from his frantic sister because something was wrong with his mother.\" I let out a hard laugh and then screamed throwing my hands up in the air. \"You\u0027re in love with Jeff\u0027s son?\" I swung around and shot daggers at Tawny. \"Yes.\" \"Just leave Low. Your dramatic performance has ruined my evening. I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re so worked up about this but it isn\u0027t our problem.\" \"Tawny, don\u0027t be so call ous,\" Jefferson said looking down at her. \"Call ous? Jeff this is utterly ridiculous. She thinks she loves your son and she thinks coming over her and ranting about us is going to make a difference she\u0027s sadly mistaken.\" A chime went through the house and I paused. \"Who else is here? My God we just moved in.\" Tawny stormed off to answer the door and I stood staring blankly into the fire. She was right. What good was this doing? I wasn\u0027t going to get an answer by sharing with them how royally they\u0027d screwed up so many lives. They simply didn\u0027t care. And even if they did what did I expect them to do about it? \"Low,\" Marcus voice broke into my thoughts and I jerked my gaze from the fire to find Tawny standing in the living room entrance with her arms crossed over her chest scowling. \"Look who else is here,\" Tawny spat walking back to Jefferson and staking her claim by slipping her arm around his. \"Marcus.\" I didn\u0027t know what else to say. I just stood there and watched the whole awful scene unfold. His eyes shifted from Tawny to me. I knew the moment he saw it. The resemblance. It was unmistakable. Especially with us standing in the same room. The emotions on his face went from shock to pain to despair to fury within seconds. \"You\u0027re her sister. This is,\" he stopped and looked at his dad. \"Oh god no,\" he started shaking his head. \"Larissa. She\u0027s not. She can\u0027t be.\" He was shattered. I could see the moment it happened. I knew the feeling. I\u0027d just experienced it myself. \"Martus pay,\" Larissa squealed when Cage walked into the room holding her. Marcus looked back at Larissa with horror in his eyes. Then he looked at me and I could see the betrayal there. He thought I\u0027d known all along. I could see it as he just stared at me. Larissa continued to try and get his attention by chanting his name and demanding he play. Marcus stared at me as his anger turned to numbness. The tick in his jaw and his rigid stance only grew more severe the longer we stood there staring at each other. I could feel him slipping away with each second but there was nothing I could say. I didn\u0027t know how to stop this. How to explain. \"You. Are. Dead. To. Me.\" He said in a hard emotionless voice. Then he turned and left. Those short clipped words woke me up from my trance. I ran after him. \"Marcus, wait! Please wait!\" I called out and he didn\u0027t stop. He didn\u0027t look back. \"MARCUS PLEASE,\" I screamed as he opened the front door. This time he paused and turned slowly around. The hatred in his eyes directed at me was crippling. \"Do you know where I\u0027ve been Will ow? Of course you don\u0027t. You\u0027ve been here with your sister and my father playing house. While I\u0027ve been by my mother\u0027s hospital bed. As she recovered from an overdose of painkil ers that she took after receiving the divorce papers my father so thoughtfully brought to the house today to inform her he was leaving her for another woman. That\u0027s where I\u0027ve been all day. So please don\u0027t say one more word. I never want to see you or even hear your name again. I\u0027ll be completely moved out of the apartment in a matter of hours. Stay away until I\u0027m gone. If you ever felt anything for me at all. Stay. Away. From. Me.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-20.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.
