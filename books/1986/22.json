That isn\u0027t ever going to change,\" Amanda said heatedly as she paced in front of the desk where I\u0027d been trying to pick the summer courses I needed to take. \"Besides, I keep seeing that little face and those blond curls and knowing she\u0027s our sister. She\u0027s a baby who did nothing wrong. She was born. It\u0027s not her fault. I want to know her Marcus. I want to have my dad back in my life again. I hate this. Mom wants us to go see him. Them. She thinks it\u0027ll be good for us. Especially you.\" Groaning, I leaned back in my chair and stared up at my very determined sister. What happened to mad Amanda?\\n\\n The one who hated our father and never wanted to see him again. I liked that Amanda. I wanted her back. We felt the same way. Except of course the part about Larissa. Every time I thought about her my chest ached. All that time I\u0027d been so fascinated with her little blond curls and happy little claps and squeals and she\u0027d been my sister. Had that been Will ow\u0027s plan? She\u0027d thought by bringing Larissa into my life under false pretenses that I\u0027d love her and accept what my father had done? God, how had I been so blind! Those damn dimples. I was lost the moment she flashed them at me. She appeared so wounded and innocent and the whole freaking time she\u0027d known exactly what her sister was doing to my mama. What she\u0027d done was unforgivable. She lied to me. To my family. And dammit I was still in love with her.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to be at the condo this week. He\u0027s invited us and I\u0027m going. I want you there with me. I need you there Marcus. Please,\" Amanda begged.\\n\\n Dinner with Dad, the other woman and the other kid. Not my idea of a good time. An image of Larissa smiling up at me and demanding I play with her tugged at me.\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027ll go. But only because you want me to so badly.\\n\\n Not because I want to make amends with him. If you want to then fine. But it\u0027ll never happen for me.\" Amanda frowned then nodded and walked around the table and kissed me on the head.\\n\\n \"Thank you. I really wish you\u0027d get past all this anger and let it go. Then maybe you can see the big picture that everyone else sees. You\u0027re living in a tunnel and if you stay blind for too long you\u0027ll miss it.\"\\n\\n What the crap did that mean? I stared up at her and she smirked then walked out of the room. I guess she thought that was supposed to be deep and meaningful. It was probably the lyrics from some God awful boy band song.\\n\\n \"Amanda,\" my dad said warmly and pulled Amanda into his arms. He patted her head and kissed her temple and whispered something to her. She nodded and his eyes raised to meet mine. \"Marcus. I\u0027m glad you came.\" I wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n But obviously Amanda needed this. I nodded and followed her inside.\\n\\n \"MARTUS,\" A loud squeal startled me and I looked down to see Larissa running toward me with her arms up in the air, grinning. Two little teeth flashed at me. I picked her up and she smelled just like I remembered.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s my princess? I see you got two teeth.\" She pointed at her new teeth, \"Two teef,\" she agreed and placed a wet kiss on my mouth.\\n\\n \"Martus come pay,\" she\u0027d added a few new words to her vocabulary. I sat her down and held her hand.\\n\\n \"You lead the way,\" I told her and she pulled me along behind her toward the living room where toys of all kinds were scattered around the floor. I quickly scanned the room and Tawny was nowhere to be found. Letting out a sigh of relief I sat down where Larissa demanded and she pulled a bucket of bright pink blocks toward me.\\n\\n \"Pinses bocks,\" she explained pointing to the picture of Cinderel a on one of the blocks.\\n\\n \"My favorite kind,\" I assured her and she giggled happily waiting for me to build her a tower of blocks to knock down.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s mentioned you several times,\" my father said as he walked into the room. I didn\u0027t look up at him. Nor did I respond. I came here for two reasons. My sisters, both of them.\\n\\n Amanda sank down on the ground on the other side of Larissa.\\n\\n \"Larissa, this is Manda,\" I said as she studied Amanda.\\n\\n \"Mana,\" she repeated. Amanda beamed at her and nodded.\\n\\n \"Yes, and it\u0027s very nice to meet you Larissa. Can I play too?\"\\n\\n Larissa grinned brightly. Amanda had said her favorite word.\\n\\n \"Mana pay too,\" she pushed some blocks toward Amanda.\\n\\n Amanda eagerly started stacking them. Larissa had that effect on people. She was hard to resist. Much like her Aunt. Aw, damn.\\n\\n Larissa was studying me and I watched as her small smile faded and she looked back at dad then at me.\\n\\n \"I \u0027ont my Lowlow,\" she whispered as tears filled her eyes.\\n\\n Dad immediately walked over and picked her up.\\n\\n \"Hey, don\u0027t cry sweetheart. You have Marcus here to play with you and Amanda. Remember I told you Lowlow would be coming tomorrow to see you. Okay,\" his voice was so gentle. Had he talked to us like that once? It was hard to see my dad as being soft hearted and loving. Larissa sniffed and nodded her head.\\n\\n \"Down,\" Larissa demanded and Dad put her back where she\u0027d been sitting.\\n\\n Larissa smiled tearily up at me. \"Lowlow come too.\" My chest hurt so bad I was having trouble breathing. Would it ever get easier seeing Larissa? Would memories of Will ow always haunt me and rip me apart all over again?\\n\\n I cleared my throat and nodded.\\n\\n \"Can you show me your other toys?\" Amanda asked. She knew I was having a hard time and she was trying to distract Larissa from anymore comments about her beloved aunt. Larissa stood up nodding and held out her hand to Amanda. \"Come see.\"\\n\\n Amanda happily followed the little chubby blond out of the room. It was like Amanda finally had a real baby doll to play with. She\u0027d always wanted a little sister. Guess she finally got one.\\n\\n I was alone with my father. Shit.\\n\\n \"You have any plans for the summer?\" he asked picking a very neutral topic.\\n\\n \"Online courses,\" I replied, standing up and walking over to the large windows overlooking the gulf.\\n\\n \"You trying to hurry up and finish?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m making up for lost time.\" He didn\u0027t deserve anymore of an explanation. He\u0027d opted out of my life.\\n\\n Turning around before he could say anymore I asked,\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the wife?\"\\n\\n \"I asked her to let me do this alone.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Afraid I\u0027ll hurt her feelings?\"\\n\\n My father shook his head, \"No, I just didn\u0027t want her here while I visited with my kids.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m only here for Amanda.\"\\n\\n \"And Larissa. I\u0027m not a fool son. I see the way you look at her. You may not want to care about her but you do.\" No reason to lie. \"I cared about Larissa before I knew.\\n\\n She\u0027s a baby. None of this is her fault.\"\\n\\n \"And she\u0027s your sister.\"\\n\\n \"And she\u0027s my sister,\" I agreed. No point in arguing. It was the truth.\\n\\n \"Have you spoken to Will ow since...\" he didn\u0027t finish. He didn\u0027t need to.\\n\\n didn\u0027t need to.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have a response for that. I started to go find the girls when his voice stopped me. \"She didn\u0027t know.\" I froze.\\n\\n \"She was devastated. She\u0027d just figured it out. She was there, at the house, having a complete emotional breakdown when you walked in.\"\\n\\n I swallowed hard. Did I want to hear this?\\n\\n \"She stripped me bare by listing every person I\u0027d hurt with my actions. She pointed out every sin I\u0027d committed and she praised the one person who\u0027d been left to pick up the pieces. She praised him rather passionately. How he\u0027d been the one to hold the family I\u0027d betrayed together. She also told me how much she loved him and how my actions and her sister\u0027s actions were going to be the reason she lost him.\"\\n\\n I grabbed hold of the chair beside me. My knees went weak. The ache from hearing Larissa ask for Will ow was nothing compared to the pain searing through my chest.\\n\\n The things I\u0027d said. Oh, God no.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been left her whole life. She\u0027s a good girl. Larissa adores her. Where her sister lacks in many honorable traits Will ow seems to have them in abundance.\" I\u0027d left her.\\n\\n Just like she feared.\\n\\n The memory of her face when she\u0027d walked into the bedroom that day before my sister had called. She\u0027d looked completely broken, devastated, lost. She\u0027d just found out. She\u0027d come to tell me. And I\u0027d had to leave.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t known.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Amanda ask as she walked into the room.\\n\\n I lifted my head and looked at her. \"She didn\u0027t know,\" I whispered horrified as the words echoed in my head that I\u0027d yelled at her that night as she pleaded with me to stop.\\n\\n \"I never thought she did,\" Amanda replied. The sadness in her voice was unmistakable. \"I tried to tell you that I was pretty sure she was innocent but you wouldn\u0027t listen to me. I wasn\u0027t allowed to even speak her name. Every time I tried to talk to you about Will ow you ended up so stupid drunk you couldn\u0027t walk.\"\\n\\n She knew as well as I did that I\u0027d lost Low, and it was all my fault.\\n\\n Willow\\n\\n Dinner with Tawny and Jefferson hadn\u0027t been too bad.\\n\\n Larissa had latched onto me and hadn\u0027t let go. I\u0027d even tucked her in and read to her until she fell asleep. I knew there was no way I could handle hearing her cry for me when I left. The way she\u0027d clung to me reminded me of how I felt. Afraid I\u0027d lose someone I loved. I wasn\u0027t going to stay away any longer. I\u0027d discussed with Tawny meeting her half way and getting Larissa one night a week. That way I could spend time with just her and not have to face that house again. Surprisingly Jefferson was behind the idea one hundred percent. He apparently didn\u0027t like Larissa crying for me either. I wanted to hate him but when I watched him with Larissa it made it hard. Things happen in life and you can\u0027t control them. It sucks and you have to move on.\\n\\n Holding a grudge against Tawny and Jefferson was pointless. It only hurt Larissa and she was innocent.\\n\\n Cage\u0027s bedroom door opened and he walked out, frowning.\\n\\n \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay with this? I\u0027d feel better about going if you\u0027d come too.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. I wasn\u0027t going to be his shadow anymore.\\n\\n He needed to get back to his life. Tonight I wanted him to go out and have a good time with his friends. I was fine right here.\\n\\n \"I have chocolate ice cream and two seasons worth of True Blood. So go. Me and vampire Eric will be just fine. I promise.\"\\n\\n He sighed and reached over and hugged me, \"Okay fine.\\n\\n I\u0027m going. But you call me the minute you feel an anxiety attack or just if you get upset or---\"\\n\\n \"Cage, GO now,\" I pointed toward the door.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going. But I\u0027ve got my phone with me.\"\\n\\n \"I heard you, Cage. Go.\"\\n\\n Once the door closed behind him I got out my chocolate ice cream and headed for the couch. Tonight I would forget about everything except hot viking vampires. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-22.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) \\n In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy.

But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \\n Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \\n Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
