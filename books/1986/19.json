{"id":73477,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Marcus I couldn\u0027t swallow. There was cotton in my throat and a pretty thick coating of it on my tongue too. Smacking my mouth I started to move and my head screeched in rebel ion. Falling back on the soft bed underneath me, I moaned. What was wrong with me? Slowly I peeled my eyelids up and the sun peeked through the blinds on my window. Confused, I glanced down at myself. I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. I was in my bed. Something was wrong. Pressing my head between my palms I forced myself to sit up. The room started spinning and I closed my eyes. I knew this feeling. It had been awhile since I\u0027d had it but I knew what it was. Massive hangover. Noise on the other side of the door helped me focus. I was in my room. Why was I in my room? How did I get to my room? Will ow. Standing up I forced my feet to move until I opened the door to my room then I leaned against it and groaned at the dizzy spell caused by the pain in my head. \"You look like shit.\" Opening my eyes I found Cage walking into the living room with a cup of coffee in his hands. Swinging my attention to the couch I noticed it was empty. Will ow. Where was Will ow? \"You\u0027re also a really bad drunk.\" Shit. What had I done? \"Low,\" I managed to say through the worst case of dry mouth I\u0027d ever had. Cage sat down on the couch and smirked at me. What was so damn funny? \"Low\u0027s in my bed.\" What? Why? She wouldn\u0027t do that? She knows I don\u0027t want her in there. Pushing off from the door I started for Cage\u0027s bedroom. \"Leave her alone. She needs sleep. Last night wasn\u0027t exactly easy on her.\" I stopped and turned to look back at him. \"What happened?\" Cage raised his eyebrows at me and the smirk on his face had vanished and he looked pissed. \"You want a complete recap? Okay,\" Cage leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees and he glared at me. \"Low came to get your drunk ass from the bar last night. When she got there you were all but screwing Jess on the dance floor. Hands all over her. Low went and snatched Jess off you and then when Jess proceeded to threaten her Low basically called her bullshit and sent her packing. From what I hear it was damn hot. Anyway, she then hauled your drunk ass home. You passed out in your truck. She had to get me to help her get you up the stairs and into bed. Then she proceeded to break down on me and cry. I cuddled her up in my arms like I always do when she\u0027s hurting and carried her to my bed where she told me all of this and then promptly fell asleep. Preston called and gave me the whole story as well.\" I was going to be sick. What had I done? My chest ached, my stomach rolled and my head pounded. I\u0027d sent her running into Cage\u0027s arms for comfort, again. I\u0027d been the reason Jess threatened her. I\u0027d put her in danger and she\u0027d taken care of me. DAMMIT Dropping into the chair nearest to me I cradled my spinning head in my hands and fought the urge to cry like a damn baby. \"I thought I\u0027d kill you when you hurt her, you know. But damned if I\u0027m not just relieved that it\u0027s over. I don\u0027t even want to hurt you. I\u0027m just so happy to have her back.\" That was all it took. I ran for the toilet and lost everything in my stomach. Several times. Then I slid down the wall and cried silently. It all came back to my father. He was the reason I got drunk. If I lost Will ow over this I\u0027d kill him. I couldn\u0027t lose her. The idea hurt so bad it made breathing impossible. The bathroom door opened slowly and I turned to look up at a very solemn Will ow. I soaked in the sight of her as she stepped inside and closed the door behind her. She handed me a cold wash cloth. \"Here.\" I took it unable to take my eyes off her as I washed the cold sweat from my face. Then she handed me the glass in her hands. \"Drink this. It\u0027ll help.\" Taking it I took several small sips and watched her afraid she\u0027d turn and leave. But she didn\u0027t. Instead she slid down the wall and sat down beside me. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m so so damn sorry, \" I choked out. She didn\u0027t respond. Instead she sat there staring down at her hands clasp tightly in her lap. I wanted to pull her in my arms and hold her. Keep her from leaving me. But I could smell the whiskey and smoke on my clothes. I stunk. \"You hurt me,\" she finally replied in a small voice. What little part of my heart was still in one piece shattered at her words. The lump in my throat constricted my airways. \"God, Low I\u0027m so sorry.\" I wanted to profess my love but right now that sounded unbelievable. I didn\u0027t want those words to be tainted by this. \"I understand that you had a fight with your father. Preston explained that. But Marcus, what I don\u0027t understand is why you\u0027d go drink so much that you were dancing and touching another woman. My sister and I fight all the time. I don\u0027t have a mom and sister like you do that love me. I have no family. The only family I have hates me. Larissa doesn\u0027t count because she\u0027s a baby. I know family problems suck Marcus. I have major problems. Things you don\u0027t know about. Issues that are eating me up inside. But none of that is an excuse for me to run off and get trashed and rub all over another guy.\" I was a selfish, spoiled brat. She was right. If the roles had been reversed I\u0027d have been a madman. I wouldn\u0027t be sitting beside her talking calmly the next morning. She was too good for me. I\u0027d already figured this out, but now I knew how undeserving I was. \"You\u0027re right. I don\u0027t deserve you.\" Will ow\u0027s hand reached out and covered mine and my body trembled from her touch. Shit I was going to cry right in front of her. Fighting the burn of tears in my eyes I couldn\u0027t look at her. Slowly I moved my thumb and hooked it through hers. I wasn\u0027t brave enough to completely take her hand. I couldn\u0027t handle it if she jerked it away. \"Don\u0027t ever do that to me again.\" Her words sank in slowly and I turned my head to meet her gaze, no longer caring that my eyes were watery from unshed tears. \"Again? You mean you forgive me. It\u0027s not over?\" I asked in disbelief. She smiled and turned her hand over and threaded her fingers through mine holding it tightly. \"I forgive you,\" she said then reached out with her other hand and wiped the moisture in my eyelashes away. \"How do I stay mad at this? Hmmm? You sitting here on the bathroom floor fighting back tears and looking completely defeated.\" She shifted closer and laid her head on my shoulder. \"I love you, Marcus. Of course,I forgive you.\" Setting the glass in my hand down on the edge of the tub, I reached for her and pulled her into my arms. I needed to hold her. I\u0027d almost lost her and I needed her close. She curled up against me and tears of relief rolled freely down my face. \"I love you too. So much Low. So very much. I promise you Low, I\u0027ll never hurt you again.\" Willow Over the next week Marcus went out of his way to do sweet romantic things for me. I came home from work one night to a candle lit bubble bath waiting on me. He left sweet little notes all over the place for me. A customer had even delivered one to me during work one night. I\u0027d awakened twice to find a vintage Aerosmith concert t-shirt beside my pillow. One was a 1984 California and the other a 1986 Aero Force. I was ready to take the next step but I was waiting on him. He needed to reassure himself that I wasn\u0027t leaving him. That he\u0027d won my forgiveness. He had, of course. We\u0027d led two very different lives. It wasn\u0027t fair of me to expect him to handle bad situations the same way I did. He\u0027d grown up protected from bad situations. He didn\u0027t know how to roll with the punches. I\u0027d been so eaten up with jealousy I\u0027d wanted to punish him. I didn\u0027t want there to be a reason for him to behave the way he did. You can\u0027t expect a sheltered person to react to disappointment the way someone who\u0027d only known disappointment reacted. Stepping outside into the sunshine after being shut up in a classroom all day I lifted my face to the sunshine and inhaled the salty breeze. Summer would be here soon and I couldn\u0027t wait to spend it with Marcus. Cage was planning a two week road trip with some of his friends. He wanted me to come too but I was looking forward to those two weeks alone with Marcus. This would be the first time Cage and I had been apart for that long. It worried me some but the fear of being left alone was beginning to wane. Since the morning I\u0027d seen the tears in Marcus\u0027s eyes when he thought he\u0027d lost me I\u0027d felt more secure in our relationship. He loved me just as fiercely as I loved him. I no longer doubted that. Calling Cage when I needed someone never even crossed my mind anymore. The first person I wanted was Marcus. Besides Marcus bought my Jarritos now. He never let them get low enough for Cage to notice. He kept me so well stocked it was comical. Cage had grumbled about it at first but he\u0027d gotten over it. My happy thoughts were interrupted when my eyes landed on my sister standing against a new Mercedes SUV smiling like the cat who caught the canary. Or more like the cat who caught the rich old dude. Walking toward her I frowned taking in her new wheels. I wondered if it had been purchased from one of Marcus\u0027s dad\u0027s lots. \"Tawny,\" I said stopping in front of her. \"Like the car?\" Tawny all but purred from pleasure. No. I didn\u0027t like the way she\u0027d gotten it. But I did like the fact Larissa would no longer be hauled around in that death trap of my sister\u0027s. \"You got it by spreading your legs, sis. I\u0027m not a fan of home-wreckers.\" She rolled her eyes and gave me a disgusted look. As if I was the gross one. hello Miss Screwing-someone-twice-your-age. \"Whatever. I wanted to let you know I was moving and I\u0027m selling the house. Jefferson feels like it\u0027s best. Letting you have it is pointless. You don\u0027t live there. It\u0027s mine anyway. Mom left it to me.\" This information stung but I expected it. She\u0027d never given me anything. Why start now? \"Where are you moving to?\" It had better not be far. I couldn\u0027t care less about Tawny but Larissa was my niece. I wanted to be able to see her. Tawny smirked and tilted her head so that her copper curls draped over her bare arm. \"Jefferson is moving us to Mobile. He has a nice big house bought for us and he is moving in with us as soon as the ink is dry on his divorce papers.\" An hour away. Not bad, but still further than I liked. At least Tawny would have no need to work. She would be home with Larissa and maybe this lifestyle would ignite the mother in her. Maybe she and Larissa could bond. I swallowed the bitter taste in my mouth. Tawny was really breaking up a marriage. But Larissa would have a daddy. I was so torn. Knowing Larissa wouldn\u0027t have to live the life I had was such a relief. But knowing a marriage had been destroyed, another family was losing their father, it broke my heart. God, could this be any more screwed up. \"Here,\" Tawny handed me an envelope. I reached out to take it. It had my name written on the outside in Tawny\u0027s swirly handwriting and it was sealed. \"It\u0027s some money. For all the times you kept Larissa and so you can get a place of your own and move out of Cage York\u0027s bed. I also put our new address in there. Larissa will want to see you.\" I stared at my sister dumbfounded. Who was this and what had she done with Tawny? \"You\u0027re giving me money?\" I asked incredulously. She straightened her shoulders and I could see the mask of indifference take its place on her face. Tawny didn\u0027t do emotion. \"I always pay my debts, Low.\" She flashed me her beauty queen smile and flipped her hair over her shoulders. \"Well, I have to go meet my fiance and pick Larissa up from the sitter.\" She turned to saunter off then stopped and glanced back over her shoulder. \"You\u0027re smart, Low. Do something with that.\" I just stood there as she climbed into her new fancy SUV and drove off. What had just happened? Had that been her way of saying she was sorry? Looking down at the envelope in my hands I opened it carefully. Pulling out a check for ten thousand dollars I stared at it in shock. Then my eyes focused on the endorser: Jefferson M Hardy I Mercedes Benz of the Gulf Coast","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-19.html","bookId":1986,"book":{"id":1986,"title":"Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2)","description":"Storyline: Because of Low (Sea Breeze #2) In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story… Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol\u0027 dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she\u0027s sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:36 AM"}}
