{"id":85875,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"After we get back to the moshav and Doda Yucky makes dinner for us, I make the final decision to go back and complete boot camp. Soon I\u0027m saying my goodbyes to my family while Avi says his goodbyes to his. Before my own family has time to miss me, I\u0027ll have graduated boot camp and be back on the moshav. Avi\u0027s family isn\u0027t so lucky. After my Sababa group graduates, Avi and the rest of the Sayeret Tzefa trainees are going to intense training at the Counter\\n\\n Terror School. The time with the Sababa group was supposed to be a relaxing break for them between parachuting and Counter Terror School. Unfortunately for Avi, I don\u0027t think being with my unit has been relaxing.\\n\\n \"Be good,\" my dad says, bending down into the passenger side window to hug me as Avi climbs behind the wheel. \"Avi, keep her safe.\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n I know it\u0027s going to be a long drive, because the base is south of the Dead Sea. The sun is setting when we reach Haifa, and we still have more than a few hours to go.\\n\\n I talk to Avi about Miranda liking Nathan, but Nathan liking Tori... and Tori not liking anyone. When I ask about Noah, Avi tells me that he\u0027s a good guy who really doesn\u0027t mind doing any of the jobs the army assigns him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never seen Noah upset. Not even once,\" he tells me.\\n\\n \"When I first met Noah, I thought he\u0027d be a good match for Miranda,\" I say. \"Or maybe Nimrod would.\"\\n\\n \"Miranda isn\u0027t Nimrod s type.\"\\n\\n I tsk. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean? Just because she has a little extra padding doesn\u0027t mean--\"\\n\\n \"Nimrod\u0027s gay.\"\\n\\n \"Gay? As in...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"Does he know that you know?\"\\n\\n \"Everyone knows. He doesn\u0027t exactly keep it a secret. This is Israel. While we might not be the most tolerant people in the world, being gay here isn\u0027t a big deal. Even in the military. Nimrod\u0027s a damn good soldier, and we\u0027re lucky he\u0027s on our squad. He\u0027s practically fearless and makes me a better soldier.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027You make me a better soldier, Avi,\" I tell him. \"I just wish I was a better friend to Miranda. I want her to be happy. Do you think setting her up with Noah would work?\"\\n\\n Avi takes my hand in his and kisses my palm. \"Trying to make the world perfect again?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good at doing it for other people. I seem to screw up my own life pretty good most of the time. I guess we all have our talents, don\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n He nods.\\n\\n \"Speaking of making life perfect, Avi. Umm... do you remember last summer when we pulled off to the side of the road?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. How could I forget?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, so I know I\u0027m a girl and shouldn\u0027t be asking this, but you only live once and life is short. Can we pull off the road? We\u0027re in the middle of a deserted road in the middle of nowhere, Israel.\"\\n\\n Avi flashes me a shocked expression. \"I thought you didn\u0027t want to have sex until we were married.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about sex. I\u0027m talking about kissing, and maybe a little body exploration...\" But as my voice trails off, I wonder what Avi has in mind. \"Why? Do you want to have sex?\"\\n\\n He nods. \"I\u0027m a guy, Amy. Of course I want to have sex with my girlfriend.\" \"You do?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah,\" he says, his voice deep and sexy. My eyes graze over him, and now I know why being alone together brings us closer to dangerous territory. These are the times my dad and mom have warned me about, when my commitment to staying a virgin until I\u0027m married is compromised by my raging teenage hormones. \"Don\u0027t look at me like that, Amy.\" \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Like you\u0027re ready to be mischievous.\" \"What if I am?\"\\n\\n Avi rakes his hand over his head and moans. \"I\u0027m seriously one minute away from begging you to be mischievous with me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now that my safia\u0027s okay, I want to think about you and me. And since you don\u0027t have to report back to base until tomorrow, and it\u0027s already late, maybe we can spend some alone time tonight. At a hotel.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Let me weigh the options. Option 1: Go back to the base, not have a second of private time with you, get up at the crack of dawn, or Option 2: Private time alone with you. It\u0027s a no-brainer, Avi. I pick private time alone with you.\"\\n\\n I think of Avi and me together... all night... in a hotel room. The word \"perfection\" doesn\u0027t do the fantasy justice.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not still feeling super mischievous, are you?\" he asks. \"Because if you are, this probably isn\u0027t the best idea.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t wait to spend all night, alone, with my boyfriend. \"Trust me, Avi. It\u0027s a great idea. Seriously, when are we going to have the chance to be alone again?\"\\n\\n He picks up his cell, makes a reservation at a hotel, and starts driving. Soon we arrive at a hotel on a kibbutz near Ein Gedi.\\n\\n Avi pays for the room, signs papers, and gets a key from the girl at the front desk. I stand beside him, trying to act like getting a hotel room with my boyfriend is no biggie.\\n\\n When in reality...\\n\\n It is a biggie. A real big biggie.\\n\\n Avi takes our bags and I follow him to our room. It\u0027s at the end of an adorable little one-story brick building with bright purple and yellow flowers outlining the front sidewalk. Avi opens the door and we walk inside.\\n\\n When the door clicks shut, the reality of being alone with Avi hits me. I\u0027m with my boyfriend without any parental supervision. I\u0027m almost a senior in high school, almost an adult... in a year I\u0027ll be living on some college campus by myself, making decisions on my own.\\n\\n I would never have put myself in the position of being alone with a boy in a hotel room if I didn\u0027t 100 percent trust him. I know Avi won\u0027t force me to do anything I don\u0027t want to do. The problem lies with me: I don\u0027t know if I trust myself. I admit, when I look at Avi I want him; I want him to kiss me until I cant breathe and touch me until my body melts under his touch, and I want to feel every inch of him. Will I be able to stop myself?\\n\\n There are two single beds on either side of the room. They\u0027re just simple foam-filled mattresses on wooden frames that don\u0027t look very comfortable (which my parents would probably think is a good thing).\\n\\n \"You seem nervous,\" he says as he puts our bags down by the little desk. There\u0027s a chill in the air, so Avi turns off the air conditioner.\\n\\n \"Why do you think I\u0027m nervous?\" I look at him and remember our talk in the car about him wanting to have sex with me.\\n\\n \"Because you haven\u0027t said anything since we arrived.\"\\n\\n I take a deep breath and watch intently as Avi steps closer to me. His boyish expression gives me a hint that he\u0027s just as nervous and insecure as I am.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not nervous. Really. I\u0027m not,\" I say.\\n\\n One side of his mouth quirks up into a smile. He doesn\u0027t believe me at all. \"You want to go change in the bathroom?\"\\n\\n Change? As in getting in PJs?\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I say. Normally this wouldn\u0027t be a problem. This isn\u0027t the first time Avis seen me in PJs, but this isn\u0027t just any normal ordinary night. I don\u0027t want to wear a big ol\u0027 T-shirt to bed. But I don\u0027t want to go all sexy, wearing a skimpy tank top to tease him. Okay, I admit I kinda do, so I can see how much I can affect him, but I realize that\u0027s totally selfish and manipulative.\\n\\n Oh, the problems of a teenage girl are endless.\\n\\n I pull out a PJ set my mom got me for the trip. It\u0027s a light blue T-shirt and matching mini-shorts. It covers enough so I\u0027m not showing too much cleave, but when I take my bra off in the bathroom I\u0027m aware that the chill in the desert air is making me nippy. Over the sink there\u0027s a mirror, so I pull up my bangs to inspect George I. He\u0027s almost gone--yeah!\\n\\n \"When I leave the bathroom, I\u0027m holding the clothes I\u0027ve worn all day clutched in front of my nippyness. Avi is sitting on one of the beds. He looks up and his breath hitches.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re beautiful,\" he says, staring at me as if I\u0027m a goddess.\\n\\n A shy smile bursts out of me. \"Thanks.\" I look back at the bathroom. \"Don\u0027t you want to, uh, wash up?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" But I notice he doesn\u0027t bring any PJs with him into the bathroom. I quickly toss my dirty clothes on top of my suitcase, pull out my pink satin pillow, and hop onto one of the beds. Pulling the thin sheet and blanket above my nippy parts, I wonder what Avi will sleep in. \"When he comes out of the bathroom, I finally know.\\n\\n My mouth drops open and I swear I have to stop myself from drooling. Avi is wearing black boxer briefs. That\u0027s it. His military-ripped bod should be oudawed. He\u0027s got a serious six-pack and has muscles in places I didn\u0027t even know existed. And when my eyes wander to the bulge in his briefs, I can\u0027t help the blush that creeps into my face.\\n\\n And I was worried about teasing him. Believe me, I\u0027m not the teaser in this room. \"You are seriously trying to tempt me, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He nods.\\n\\n I reluctantly tear my gaze away. \"Well, good night,\" I say, patting my pillow and pulling the covers over me. \"Turn out the light before you go to sleep, will ya?\"\\n\\n That\u0027ll teach him to try and tease me.\\n\\n But a minute after I pretend to go to sleep, I pop one eye open. He\u0027s still standing by the bathroom door looking every bit a hard-core male model with a body to die for... or at least to lose your virginity over. Knowing the guy inside the body is my one true love makes this situation almost unbearable.\\n\\n \"Can I at least push the beds together?\" he asks sheepishly.\\n\\n \"I thought you were going to do it while I was in the bathroom. And then I thought since you didn\u0027t, maybe you wanted to sleep separately.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to push the beds together without asking you first. And then you came out here in that sexy outfit and I forgot all about it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not sexy,\" I tell him. \"It\u0027s just a top and shorts.\"\\n\\n \"Amy, that\u0027s just about the sexiest thing I\u0027ve ever seen on anyone. Maybe it\u0027s because it matches your eyes. Maybe it\u0027s because it\u0027s got lace around the edges. Or maybe it\u0027s just because you\u0027re wearing it.\" He looks down, embarrassed, as he pushes the beds together.\\n\\n Since the frames are made of wood, there\u0027s a huge wooden gap between the mattresses. Avi folds one of the sheets into the groove and puts a blanket over it so it won\u0027t be too uncomfortable.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this?\" I ask, fingering the three-inch-long, olive green pouch hanging from a string around his neck.\\n\\n He opens the pouch and reveals a silver metal rectangle stamped with words in Hebrew and a long number. \"My ID tag. We cover it so the metal doesn\u0027t burn our skin in the heat.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s a gold metal medallion hanging next to the ID tag. \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n He fingers the medallion. \"All Sayeret Tzefa trainees get it. It has the words Respect, Strength, and Honor on it. Respect for your country, your enemies, and your comrades. Strength in body and mind. Honor to your country, your comrades, and the ones who served before you.\" He says it like he\u0027s had to rehearse the words for some test.\\n\\n \"Does everyone wear it?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re caught without it, you have to sing this stupid song to the entire squad. It\u0027s a new tradition. I think it was copied from some American Marines that did training here a few years back.\"\\n\\n While I lie back on my pillow, Avi turns off the light.\\n\\n A few seconds later I feel him sliding into bed next to me. His leg brushes mine and I hear his slow breathing. A sliver of light is shining through the window of the room, so I can make out his silhouette in the darkness. My heart is beating furiously with anticipation, especially when he turns toward me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-23.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) \\n Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
