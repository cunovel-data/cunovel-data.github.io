{"id":85879,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"Probably because we live near civilization,\" Jess says.\n We both stare up into the sky. Seriously, there must be billions of stars above us. After a minute, a streak shoots through the sky. It\u0027s there and gone before I know it, making me wonder if I\u0027ve even seen it at all.\n \"Was that what I thought it was?\" Jess asks.\n \"I saw it, too. I\u0027ve never seen a shooting star before.\"\n \"Me, either. Should we make a wish?\"\n I wish... (I can\u0027t tell you, because then it might not come true. But I bet you can guess.)\n As we\u0027re whispering, I have the sudden urge to pee. \"I\u0027ve got to go to the bathroom. Come with me.\"\n \"No way,\" Jess murmurs. \"I\u0027m not risking getting bitten by a night creature. Wait until morning.\"\n I try to settle back in my sleeping bag. But since I\u0027m not able to sleep, and I hear people snoring (Nathan is like his own little symphony), I take George II and decide to wander away from camp to find a perfect spot to squat. I need to find a place far enough away that I can take my panties and pants off, so I don\u0027t make them grosser than they already are.\n Eventually I find a large, flat rock jutting out from the ground. Thankful for the little light the billions of stars offer and for the fact I don\u0027t have to dig a hole in order to pee, I situate half of my butt on the rock and the other half, well, you get the idea.\n As I relieve myself, I hear little pop-pop-pops in the distance. Like gunfire. \"We\u0027re in Israel, on the grounds where the military does its training operations... can Avi be just a few hundred yards away? In the past, gunfire would freak me out, but now it\u0027s getting to be a familiar sound. I\u0027m getting desensitized to it. Freaky, I know.\n I must look ridiculous naked, from the waist down, sitting with half my butt on a rock and the other half hanging off--with an M16 strapped to my back while I\u0027m intently listening to gunfire. If Avi could see me now (not that I\u0027d let him see me pee, ever), he\u0027d be proud that I\u0027m roughing it without complaining.\n If the Sayeret Tzefa trainees are on some sort of outdoor firing range doing night exercises, maybe I can say a quick goodbye to him. I\u0027m aware it might not be the best idea, but I\u0027m thinking positively. As I put my pants back on, I take a few steps toward the popping sounds.\n When I hear more popping sounds, I hurry closer. Live ammo this close to the army base means training exercises, not war.\n I\u0027ve been walking for over ten minutes, praying that a snake or desert creature doesn\u0027t think I\u0027m their midnight snack. I wish I had my headlight with me so I could see better. Despite the stars, the desert has too many scary shadows. I don\u0027t know if my eyes are playing tricks on me or if the rocks are really moving snakes and coyotes.\n I climb up and over a steep hill. I think the firing range must be close, because the gunfire is getting louder.\n As I maneuver around a big boulder blocking my path, a large, strong hand clamps over my mouth.\n I try to scream as loud as I can, but the hand around my mouth tightens and my attempts at screaming are useless. I\u0027m spun around with the force of a tornado.\n Chapter 27\n Brilliance and stupidity are probably as closely related as love and hate.\n As I\u0027m twirled around so fast it makes my head spin, I\u0027m face to face with an Israeli soldier. Even with his black mask and black clothes, I know it\u0027s Avi. I can see his eyes shining through the holes in his mask. I\u0027d know those sexy eyes anywhere.\n \"Amy?\" he whispers.\n My panic starts to subside, but my pulse is still racing frantically. \"Hi,\" I say sheepishly. \"We were sleeping in the desert somewhere over there.\" I point in the approximate direction of our campsite. \"And I heard gunfire so I thought you might be over here doing night range shooting. I know I smell because I didn\u0027t shower today. And I have sweaty cleave from my monoboob. And my under- wear is full of rock dust that chafed my buttcheeks when I sat on the rock and peed. But I wanted to see you one last time before I went back to Chicago.\"\n \"First of all, never go toward the sound of gunfire. Ever. You hear me?\" he says sternly.\n \"I hear you.\"\n \"And second--\" He doesn\u0027t finish his sentence. He does curse a few times, though. Some of the words are in English, and I know some are curses in Hebrew because I\u0027ve heard my dad say them on rare occasions when he\u0027s royally pissed.\n I watch as Avi pushes a small button on a headset I didn\u0027t realize he was wearing. He says something in Hebrew. I can\u0027t hear the response, because the receiver must be some kind of earpiece in his ear.\n \"So I guess you\u0027re not doing range exercises, huh?\"\n He shakes his head.\n \"Running exercises?\"\n He shakes his head. \"Amy, I hate to break the news to you but you\u0027ve just entered military war games.\"\n \"War games? With real guns?\"\n \"With real paintball guns.\" He picks up his rifle and shows me the gadget attached to it, which turned the gun into a paintball gun. \"It\u0027s dangerous. I\u0027m taking you back.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I just wanted to say goodbye to you. It was an innocent mistake.\"\n \"All of your mistakes are innocent, and yet they still get you in loads of trouble. Come on,\" he orders. He talks into his headset again as he leads me back up the mountain. He groans into the microphone, then turns to me. \"I just got word from Nimrod that Ori got captured. He did manage to hide his weapon right before they got him.\"\n \"What does that mean?\"\n He winces, obviously pissed at this new predicament. \"It means I can\u0027t take you back, not now.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go back myself, then.\"\n \"When the other team sees you walking up the mountain, it\u0027ll give away my location. I can\u0027t let you do that. It could jeopardize my team.\" After making me put on his vest for protection, he motions for me to follow him.\n \"When will this exercise be over?\" I whisper.\n He gives a short laugh. \"When one team wins and the opposing team members are either dead or captured. Dead meaning paintball dead... not real dead.\"\n \"Oh,\" I say, grateful for the elaboration.\n Avi leads me over the rough terrain. I slip every once in a while because my high tops aren\u0027t exactly made for mountain climbing... or war games, for that matter. Avi is moving quickly, holding my hand so I don\u0027t fall on my ass.\n \"Get down,\" he mouths, motioning for me to lay on the ground next to him and stay silent. \"Stay here.\" He crawls away, and is back in less than a minute. He takes my M16 away and hands me another one. \"This is Oris. It\u0027s loaded with paintballs. They\u0027re dangerous, so don\u0027t shoot at close range and don\u0027t shoot unless fired upon.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\" I might be a Jewish warrior woman, but I\u0027m not about to shoot this thing without Avi telling me to.\n I move right next to him as he pulls small binoculars out of his pocket and surveys the area. He pushes that button again on the headset he\u0027s wearing and talks softly into the microphone in Hebrew.\n \"We\u0027ll stay here and wait for instructions from the team leader.\"\n \"Who\u0027s the team leader?\"\n \"Nimrod.\"\n \"Why not you?\"\n \"Because Nimrod doesn\u0027t have a civilian tagging along on the mission who also happens to be someone he\u0027s romantically involved with.\"\n Wait. Does that mean... \"Avi, were you the team leader ten minutes ago?\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n Oh, no. It\u0027s bad enough I\u0027ve been dragged into military war games because of my own curiosity and stupidity. But Avi being stripped of his team leader status because of me is awful. \"Let me be captured so you can be team leader again.\"\n He shakes his head. \"Not happening.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because this is real, Amy. Even though this isn\u0027t real war, we\u0027re supposed to act like it is. It\u0027s not capture the flag in gym class. In a real situation, I\u0027d give my life up to protect yours. I know it and my entire squad knows it. That makes both of us liabilities.\"\n I\u0027m quiet as this new news sinks in. \"You\u0027d die for me, Avi?\"\n He pulls the mask off his face. His soul is reflected in the depths of his pupils. \"I\u0027d do just about anything for you.\"\n Heart-melting time. I\u0027d do anything for Avi, even die for him. I\u0027m not sure he\u0027s convinced I\u0027m tough enough to deal with the war games scenario. One thing I know for sure, though, is that I\u0027ve single-handedly ruined my boyfriend\u0027s reputation. He got demoted because of me. How am I supposed to fix it?\n Avi, oblivious to the fact that I\u0027m ruining his military career, talks to his squad and waits. Then he talks again, getting information from Nimrod and passing back information from our end. \"Doron got hit.\" He lets out a breath and shakes his head. \"This isn\u0027t good.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Nimrod?\"\n \"Near the other team\u0027s headquarters, where Ori is being held. Come on,\" he says. \"Crawl on your stomach to the big rock over there. Stay low.\"\n I follow Avi to the big rock, my knees scraping the desert floor and my monoboob pressed to the ground. I don\u0027t complain, but look on the bright side of being caught in the middle of war games: I\u0027m with Avi.\n I wished on the shooting star, and my wish came true. Next time I should specify for it not to be while he\u0027s in the middle of war games, but whatever. Being with Avi is better than the alternative, any day.\n Avi is listening to instructions from Nimrod. He motions me forward, so we\u0027re side by side. \"Udi is covering Nimrod so he can rescue the hostage. I told them they needed a second cover man, but Nimrod ordered me to stay put.\"\n \"You think they can do it?\"\n \"Yeah. But it\u0027s risky with us being outnumbered.\" Avi pulls out his binoculars and surveys the situation.\n \"Can you see them?\"\n \"No. They\u0027re out of sight range.\"\n \"What happens if they\u0027re caught?\"\n He looks at me and shrugs. \"Then it\u0027s just us.\"\n I hear the pop-pop-pop of gunfire. Avi curses again. \"Nimrod\u0027s down. Udi\u0027s captured. The other team ambushed them. Nimrod and Udi got two down before getting hit. It\u0027s just you and me,\" he says. \"I probably don\u0027t have to tell you the odds aren\u0027t in our favor.\"\n I\u0027m to blame for Avi\u0027s team dying and/or being captured, one by one, as soon as I arrived. \"Are you giving up?\" I ask him.\n \"No.\"\n \"Because I have a plan.\"\n \"I do, too. It involves me opening fire when they start shooting at us. The other team knows me, and they know I\u0027m not going down without a fight.\"\n \"I have a better plan. One that might give us the advantage.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hear it,\" he says, gesturing for me to share my idea.\n \"You\u0027ll really listen to my suggestion?\"\n \"Of course. My girlfriend might be an American princess, and gets herself into ridiculous situations all the time... but she\u0027s no dummy.\"\n I straighten my back and hold my head high, ready to reveal my perfect plan. \"Avi, take off your clothes.\"\n Chapter 28\n Who knew the best time of your life could be on a mountain, in the middle of a desert, caught up in war games?\n With an M16 retrofitted paintball machine gun in my hand and Avis clothes on my body, I head into enemy territory. The mask is too big, the shirt is flimsy except in the boob area, and the pants are about to fall off, but I manage to look enough like Avi maneuvering through the rocks. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-27.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) \n Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
