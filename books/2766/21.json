{"id":85873,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"It\u0027s rustic and dusty and total farmland, but it feels like home. Poor Avi had to listen to me cry and sniff and blow my nose every two seconds all the way from the hospital, although he didn\u0027t seem to mind. He held my hand the entire time (except when I was being gross and blowing my nose, and when we stopped for dinner). Seriously, just having him here with me gives me strength. Avi lives a few houses down on the opposite side of the very narrow gravel road, but he doesn\u0027t just drop me off. My cousin Osnat (pronounced O\u0027snot -- and yes, it\u0027s a very popular Israeli name) is the first person to see me. She\u0027s sitting on the sofa, watching television with my aunt (Doda Yucky), my Uncle Chaim (I call him Uncle Chime, because I can\u0027t do that back-throat-noise Hebrew-pronunciation thing), and my little toddler cousin Matan (who is not naked, for once). They all wrap me and Avi in big hugs. Even Osnat, and she\u0027s not the most warm and fuzzy person I\u0027ve ever met--although we definitely get along way better now than we used to. I can tell she\u0027s been crying, too, because her eyes are all bloodshot. \"Amy, what happened to your chin? And your arms?\" Doda Yucky looks at Avi accusingly. He holds his hands up. \"Don\u0027t look at me. She managed to do that all on her own.\" \"You beat yourself up?\" Osnat says. \"In the morning you\u0027ll have to tell us how you managed to do that.\" I know she\u0027s just joking. Normally I\u0027d have some witty-comeback, but I\u0027m too upset and exhausted to think of one. \"Are you hungry?\" Doda Yucky asks. \"Let me fix you both something. You\u0027ve had such a long day.\" \"I took her to Marinado by Kibbutz Ein Gev,\" Avi tells them. \"I couldn\u0027t resist stopping there for one of their burgers.\" I sit with my aunt, uncle, and cousins in their small living room as we catch up on the past year. Even though we talk every week, it\u0027s not the same as actually spending time with them. Uncle Chime laughs when I tell him about my experiences on the army base, and even tells me a funny story about digging ditches when he was in the army. I guess digging ditches is a rite of passage for Israeli soldiers. Doda Yucky shares her own stories about being an instructor on one of the bases. Matan climbs on her lap and dangles off her knees while she\u0027s talking. Doda Yucky has always been sweet to me. She never stops smiling, and she loves everyone she comes in contact with. Then the conversation turns to Sofia\u0027s health. Doda Yucky tells me how she found her unconscious. The somber mood returns as they tell me to pray for the best. A yawn escapes my mouth. \"You need sleep,\" Uncle Chime tells me. \"You look exhausted.\" \"I am.\" Although I don\u0027t know if I can sleep. Too many thoughts are running through my head, but I\u0027m so overtired, hopefully my eyes will close as soon as I hit my pillow. After Avi helps bring my suitcases in from the car, Osnat drags her pillow and blanket out of her room. \"Amy can sleep in my room. I\u0027ll sleep in Sofia\u0027s room tonight,\" she says. I peer inside Osnat\u0027s room. Just like I remembered, it has two twin beds situated across the room from each other. \"I don\u0027t want to kick you out of your room. You\u0027ve got two beds. We can share.\" \"It\u0027s not a problem. Really. I\u0027d rather sleep in Sofia\u0027s bed. I\u0027d feel closer to her somehow. Besides, you snore.\" I give a huff. \"That\u0027s so not true.\" \"You\u0027re asleep, so how would you know? Seriously, last summer I needed earplugs when you slept in my room.\" I look up at Avi. \"I do not snore.\" \"I believe you,\" he says. \"But right now I need to go across the street to let my parents know I\u0027m here.\" My heart starts racing in panic. I grab a fistful of his shirt and hold on tight. \"But you\u0027re coming back tonight, right?\" \"If you want me to.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to leave for a second.\" \"You need to get ready for bed, Amy. I can\u0027t exactly be with you then, unless you want your uncle and dad to threaten to give me a second circumcision.\" He kisses me lightly on the lips. \"Take a hot shower and enjoy it. You haven\u0027t had one in a while. I\u0027ll be back after I say hi to my parents and wash up. I promise.\" Famous last words. I stand in the foyer pouting like my dog Mutt when he watches me put my jacket on. If I was a real dog, I would whimper just like Mutt, too. But I\u0027m not a dog and I have to suck it up and stay positive. I can do positive. Taking a deep breath, I grab my PJs and head for the one bathroom. There\u0027s still an open keyhole/peephole in the door for anyone inclined to look at someone peeing or taking a dump. I undress quickly, unwrap the gauze from my arms, and turn the water on, hoping none of my Israeli family members open the door without knocking. \"When the water turns hot, it\u0027s like the Almighty Lord has sent a miracle down to earth just for me. Being super gentle while soaping the still-raw cuts on my arms, I lather up, scrub, rinse, and repeat a few times before letting the water just run down my body. Ahh, this feels great. I hear the door open. \"Helloooo, I\u0027m in here,\" I say loudly, then stick my head out of the curtain to see who\u0027s barged in on me. It\u0027s little Matan, with his corkscrew hair and Power Ranger pajamas on. \"Shalom, Ami,\" he says, smiling wide. He says my name Ah-mee instead of Amy. \"Shalom. Do you mind? I\u0027m in the shower here.\" I know the kid doesn\u0027t understand English, but you\u0027d think he\u0027d get the hint. No such luck. My little toddler cousin pulls down his pants and starts peeing in the toilet next to the shower. Does he not care that I\u0027m in here, totally naked behind the curtain? To top it off, he starts scratching his butt while he\u0027s peeing. Eww. Please don\u0027t tell me every guy does this. When he\u0027s done, he gives his thingie a little shake, pulls up his pants, and waves to me with a big happy-go-lucky smile on his face. I\u0027ll never get over the fact that guys don\u0027t wipe their wee-wees after they pee. It just seems so unsanitary. It also seems unsanitary that Matan is going out of the bathroom without washing his hands. Totally not acceptable. \"Yo, Matan!\" I call after him. \"Kent\" Yes? I\u0027m still naked, in the shower with shampoo in my hair and soap running down my body, with my head the only thing peeking out from the curtain. \"Wash your hands, little buddy.\" \"Lo meda\u0027bear Angleet, Ami.\" He doesn\u0027t understand English, and he\u0027s waiting for me to translate what I just said. How the hell am I supposed to know what wash your germy hands is in Hebrew? I let go of the curtain and rub my hands together using the universal hand-washing motion, then point to the sink. \"Wash your hands,\" I tell him again, hoping he understands this time. Matan points to my now exposed boobs and says, \"Tzee-tzeem g\u0027doleem!\" I know that gadol means \"big,\" and I can just imagine that tzee-tzeem means \"boobs\" by the direction of his pointing finger. Would he think it polite of me to point to his wee-wee and announce \"Pee-pee katan!\" --Hebrew for his ding-a-ling is tiny? I quickly pull the shower curtain back over my body. Keeping one hand on the curtain, I point to the sink again. \"Wash, Matan, or I swear I\u0027m telling your mom you don\u0027t clean your hands after peeing.\" Yes, I\u0027m aware he doesn\u0027t know what my threat means, but it makes me feel better saying it. Doda Yucky knocks on the door. \"Amy, is Matan in there?\" \"Yep. He sure is.\" She opens the door, apologizes, and helps him quickly wash his hands before shooing him out. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027ll make sure he doesn\u0027t do that again.\" Matan points in the general direction of my boob area hiding behind the curtain and says to his mother, \"L\u0027Amy yesh tzee-tzeem g\u0027dokemf DodaYndsy looks embarrassed as she says, \"He doesn\u0027t mean anything by that.\" \"Uh huh.\" I\u0027ll just file that into the folder of embarrassing/humiliating moments in my life. After my shower, I change into PJs and feel like a new person. At least a new person with scratched-up arms and a chin with racer marks on it. \"Is Avi back yet?\" I ask Osnat. She\u0027s sitting on our safia\u0027s bed, looking at a photo album. \"No.\" Osnat, who\u0027s my age and will be in the Israeli army in a year, looks vulnerable and lost. \"Safta always looked forward to your Saturday calls, you know.\" \"She never seemed tired of hearing about what was going on in my life.\" There aren\u0027t many people who like to hear the sound of your voice and are happy to listen to you, no matter what you\u0027re saying. Sofia is one of those people. Some kids hate talking to their elderly grandparents on the phone, but I can\u0027t wait until I wake up Saturday morning and can call my family in Israel. \"Here\u0027s a picture of us when we went to the Kotel, the Western Wall,\" she tells me. I move closer and look at the picture. It shows my aunt, my uncle, Sofia, and my two cousins pushing tiny pieces of paper into the cracks in the Wall. I\u0027ve read about the Wall, the only standing structure from the ancient Jewish Temple. It\u0027s also called the Wailing Wall because Jews mourn the destruction of the Temple and grieve while praying there. \"What are you doing in this picture?\" I ask her. \"Putting prayers into the cracks. It\u0027s customary to do that. People think God is closer there than other places, and will answer your prayers.\" Oh, great. Why hadn\u0027t I known this sooner? I definitely think a trip to the Western Wall is in order. The only problem is that it\u0027s in Jerusalem, a few hours from the mosbav. In another picture, Matan is kissing the Wall while standing next to Sofia. I sit on the edge of Sofia\u0027s bed, thinking how lucky Osnat is. Our grandma has lived with her since she was born. I know some teens would hate sharing their home with their grandparent, but I would have loved it. Especially my grandma, because she\u0027s sweet and kind and has definitely given me good advice when I asked for it (unlike my mother, who\u0027s a master at giving me unsolicited opinions, suggestions, and critiques). \"What is Safia really like?\" Osnat looks up and smiles. \"Seriously, with Safia what you see is it. When I was younger we used to go out in the middle of the night when we both couldn\u0027t sleep and we\u0027d sit on the edge of the mountain and talk... about nothing and everything.\" \"That\u0027s so cool.\" \"It was. And there\u0027s this area about a mile away where eagles fly over a ravine. We\u0027d sit there for hours, talking about Israel and freedom and history.\" She wipes tears away. \"I guess you kinda missed out by living in America. I always think you have it so easy, and I guess I get jealous of your material stuff.\" Osnat closes the album and sits up. \"What\u0027s with you and Avi?\" \"What\u0027s with you and O\u0027dead?\" I ask her, quickly changing the subject to her boyfriend. Israelis are not overly gushy or lovey-dovey types, and I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll make fun of me if I open up and really tell her how I feel about Avi. \"Are you guys still dating?\" \"O\u0027dead and I broke up. He\u0027s dating Ofra.\" \"Wait. Isn\u0027t Ofra dating Doo-Doo?\" \"She dumped him.\" Wait a minute. \"Your best friend stole your boyfriend?\" \"Kind of. But I mover it.\" I guess when Jessica started dating Mitch, Mitch and I were still technically a couple even though I\u0027d already met Avi. Teenage dating is definitely complicated. Before Avi and I met, my friends and I used to joke that marrying your high school sweetheart was an urban myth. No teen relationships I know of have lasted.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-21.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
