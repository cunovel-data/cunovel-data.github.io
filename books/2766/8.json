{"id":85860,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"What are you doing?\" Tori asks with a stupid sneer on her face.\\n\\n \"What does it look like I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m putting on makeup.\"\\n\\n Tori rolls her eyes. \"Do you think you\u0027re going to a party?\"\\n\\n I sneer back, one of my famous sneers that beats hers hands-down. The only sneer that can rival mine is my cousin O\u0027snot\u0027s.\\n\\n I quickly apply eyeliner, mascara, and colored lip gloss while everyone scrambles around.\\n\\n Once outside, with my canteen strapped on my shoulder like a very ugly purse, I get in formation while I watch Avi. It\u0027s still dark, but I can see him clearly in the lighted courtyard. He doesn\u0027t look tired; he doesn\u0027t look as if he\u0027s just woken up before God did. And today he\u0027s wearing a huge military vest with pockets, filled with ammunition or whatever military stuff he\u0027s supposed to carry. To top it off, he\u0027s got on a military backpack and his rifle. He looks as if he\u0027s about to go on some dangerous mission and is able, willing, and ready for war.\\n\\n Nathan, on the other hand, looks horrible. He\u0027s got really bad bed-head, and is obviously super tired because his eyes are at half-mast.\\n\\n Liron, with her ever-present big-ass rifle, asks Avi a question as she points to the papers on the clipboard she\u0027s carrying. He quickly glances at me, then nods to her.\\n\\n I\u0027m trying to concentrate on Ronit\u0027s lecture about time... something about time being important and how it could mean the difference between life and death in war. She says we have to move faster. But I\u0027m not listening, because I\u0027m too busy wondering what Liron and Avi were just talking about. Besides, someone needs to clue Ronit in that we\u0027re just civilian trainees on a \"fun\" summer program. The brochure didn\u0027t say anything about actually going into combat.\\n\\n Sergeant B-S is mysteriously absent. I think he must be getting his beauty sleep. Avi, Nimrod, and three other Sayeret Tzefa trainees are in charge of our unit for this exercise. Ronit and Liron are coming along, too.\\n\\n They make us stop by a big spigot coming out of the ground.\\n\\n \"Make a line and fill your canteens,\" Avi orders in a loud Israeli accent. He stands in front of the spigot, supervising, as we wait our turn to fill our canteens.\\n\\n When it\u0027s my turn, Avi puts his hand on the small of my back. I swear that electrons or protons, or whatever they taught us in biology class is in your body, zing up my spine. This boy, this man, this soldier... one minor touch from him reminds me of the time we were in my car on the beach back in Chicago. There were no parents, no friends, no military commanders around, no rules... it was just the two of us. My mind wanders back to that night...\\n\\n \"I want to forget how inexperienced you are, \"Avi groans as he leans back on the headrest of the car.\\n\\n \"So teach me,\" I say. I bite my lower lip as I reach up and unbutton the top two buttons of my shirt, well aware Avis eyes are now totally focused on my task as I move my hands lower and start unbuttoning the rest. My hands are shaking -- I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s from the cold car or my trembling nerves.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you listen when your dad had the sex talk? Didn\u0027t he tell you boys only want one thing?\"\\n\\n \"Do you, Avi? Do you only want one thing?\" I say as I open my shirt and reveal my bra beneath it.\\n\\n \"I have to be honest and say my body\u0027s only thinking about one thing right now.\"\\n\\n \"Take your shirt off,\" I order.\\n\\n As his hands reach for the hern of his shirt he says in a strained voice, \"Your dad\u0027s gonna kill me.\" He lifts his shirt over his head and tosses it onto the drivers seat with his eyes never leaving me.\\n\\n As he brushes the tips of his fingers across my abdomen, the tingles send wild sensations through my body. \"Are you okay with this?\" he asks, his face serious.\\n\\n I nod and give him a small smile. \"I\u0027ll let you know when I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n As I lean down to press our bodies against each other, his hands reach around under my open shirt and pull me toward him. \"Your body ...so warm.\"\\n\\n His hands are like afire, consuming my body with his touch. I lean my head on his chest, hearing his heart beating the same erratic rhythm as my own while his hands move up and caress my hair, my bare back, and my breasts.\\n\\n As I reclaim his lips, raw emotions and new wonderful feelings whirl in my consciousness. I\u0027m fully aware I\u0027m not ready to have sex, but I\u0027m ready to experience more...\\n\\n \"You okay?\" Avi asks me, bringing me back to the reality of my life called boot camp. I wish we were in my car right now instead of here.\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah. Are you?\"\\n\\n Avi wants to be a hardass in the IDF and not show emotion. He once told me I\u0027m the one person who makes him emotional, and that scares him.\\n\\n I think of how I lured him to spend time alone with me yesterday. I guess deep down I knew if I begged him to go somewhere private with me he wouldn\u0027t refuse--even if it was against the rules. I have the power to make him forget the rules, and I abused that power.\\n\\n Oh, no! I\u0027m like Eve in the Garden of Eden, and he\u0027s poor Adam. Amy\u003dThe Dark Side.\\n\\n My canteen is full, so I have to step aside. \"Do you hate me?\" I murmur.\\n\\n He shakes his head and smiles. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you had to do pushups yesterday.\"\\n\\n He examines his roughed-up palms. \"I deserved it.\"\\n\\n I feel a tension between us. I\u0027m desperate for that tension to go away.\\n\\n \"Amy, I have to tell you something.\"\\n\\n Good. I hope he says he loves me. I hope he says he\u0027s glad I\u0027m here. I hope he says he wishes we were alone together. I gaze into his eyes and say in a hopeful voice, \"What? What do you want to tell me?\"\\n\\n \"Wear your hat.\"\\n\\n \"My hat?\" Is he kidding me?\\n\\n \"Wear it. It\u0027s for your protection.\"\\n\\n \"I look dorky in hats, Avi. I\u0027m not wearing it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll look worse with sunburn.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for the tip,\" I say, kind of sarcastically, then head back into formation. I\u0027m not wearing the hat, and I\u0027m sulking. I know I shouldn\u0027t expect Avi to say romantic stuff to me while we\u0027re here, but I want to hear those things coming out of his mouth nonetheless.\\n\\n \"When everyone\u0027s canteen is full, we get fifteen minutes to scarf down breakfast, then we head out the gates of the army base in perfect formation. We march to Avi\u0027s small-ydmean-smalls for a while. Every so often he orders all of us to drink from our canteens. It\u0027s no sparkling Perrier, and it\u0027s not cold, but it\u0027s wet and feels good going down my throat.\\n\\n Avi and two other guys are standing in front of us, rifles cradled in their hands. The other SayeretTzefa trainees are flanking us on all sides.\\n\\n You\u0027d think I\u0027d be freaked out with all the rifles and military precautions. But I\u0027m not. I know the risks of being in Israel, and so do the Israelis. While they go on with their daily lives, refusing to give in to the fear of terrorism, they do what they can to protect themselves. I feel safe with these warriors protecting me.\\n\\n We continue marching. This time Nimrod calls out the marching chant. The dawn chill disappears and the air grows warmer, a hint the sun will be up soon. The longer we march, the more the landscape looks like a barren desert. Mountains and rocks are our only scenery, and the uneven pebbly ground meets our shoes.\\n\\n Some kids at school have asked me what\u0027s so special about Israel. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s a fun amusement park to go to or specific \"wonders of the world\" like the pyramids in Egypt. Israel is special just by being here--if you\u0027ve never been to Israel, you can\u0027t fully \"get it.\" You can tell you\u0027re in Israel because of the people. Israeli citizens are determined and strong. They\u0027re harsh, but have a heart. They refuse to let terrorism or fear disrupt their daily lives--maybe it\u0027s because of the Holocaust and maybe it\u0027s because they\u0027ve lived in a war zone for so long. Whatever it is, their determination to live life to the fullest, without fear, is contagious.\\n\\n The land of Israel mimics the citizens of its country. The harsh landscape of the Negev desert makes you wonder why people settled here, until you reach the historical sites and are awed by the rich history of the land. Where my cousins live, in the Golan Heights, you wonder why anyone would live so far from civilization until you step to the edge of the mountain--the Sea of Galilee shines at you and confirms your belief in God all over again.\\n\\n I\u0027m not feeling the mystical effect of Israel right now, though, because I haven\u0027t had enough sleep to appreciate the Jewish homeland. Just when I\u0027m about to complain about rocks in my high-tops, we\u0027re ordered to stop and take another five-minute rest.\\n\\n I\u0027m talking to Jessica and Miranda when Nathan walks up to us. \"I feel like Moses wandering in the desert for forty years,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Why do you think they brought us here?\" Miranda asks as she wipes her sweaty face with her sleeve.\\n\\n Jess shrugs. \"Beats me. I\u0027m hot and crabby. Amy, go ask Avi why we\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Nathan asks. \"He\u0027s your soulmate, right? Isn\u0027t that what you called him last week when I asked why you were saving yourself for that big oaf?\"\\n\\n \"Um, uh, I hate to break the bad news, but that big oaf is standing right behind you,\" Jess informs him.\\n\\n Nathan looks at Miranda. \"Tell me she\u0027s lying,\" he groans.\\n\\n Miranda\u0027s answer is a rapid shake of her head.\\n\\n Avi shoves a shovel the length of his arm at Nathan.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this for, to dig my own grave?\" Nathan asks as he takes the shovel out of Avi\u0027s grip.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not that lucky,\" Avi says. \"Follow me.\"\\n\\n Everyone else is assembling next to a soldier from Sayeret Tzefa. In all, there are five groups of eight people, each with a small shovel. Avi\u0027s team consists of me, Jessica, Miranda, Tori, Nathan, and three other American guys named David, Eli, and Ethan.\\n\\n \"This is a contest,\" Nimrod says. His group stands next to ours, and Avi is stoic as he watches Nimrod explain. \"You have to dig a ditch two meters long and one hundred centimeters deep. The winning group gets a ride back to base camp.\"\\n\\n Oh, we are SO winning this since Avi is on our team. I clap my hands excitedly and pat my boyfriend\u0027s back.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be too excited. Team leaders can\u0027t help.\"\\n\\n Huh? Without his help, there\u0027s no way we can win. We\u0027ve got Tori on our team, and after spending a day with her, I know she\u0027s going to be a pain in the butt. Nathan\u0027s got this testosterone fight going on with Avi so his focus isn\u0027t on the prize. We\u0027ve got Miranda, but she\u0027s still panting and sweating from the hike. If pushed more, she might just pass out. David, Eli, and Ethan are all from big cities and are staring at the shovel as if it\u0027s a foreign object.\\n\\n We\u0027re hopeless.\\n\\n \"Put your canteens down,\" Avi orders.\\n\\n He\u0027s treating me just like everyone else. It bothers me. I want him to act like my boyfriend and let everyone know we\u0027re a couple. Yes, I\u0027m aware it\u0027s selfish and immature, but at least I\u0027m willing to admit it.\\n\\n \"Start digging!\" Nimrod orders.\\n\\n We all look to Avi for direction. He\u0027s standing with his arms crossed on his chest, watching us, not saying anything.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s obviously not going to help us,\" I inform my group. \"You have the shovel, Nathan. Start digging.\"\\n\\n Nathan picks a spot on the ground and starts digging. Dirt and rocks are flying in the air behind him as he quickly gets to work.\\n\\n After ten minutes, he stops. \"My fingers are starting to get numb.\" He hands the shovel to me. \"Your turn.\"\\n\\n I take the shovel and start where Nathan left off. I think I\u0027m doing pretty well, although my team is totally annoying. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-8.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) \\n Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.

She sleeps in a bunk bed underneath coils that look ready to give way, she\u0027s being worked to the bone, and the bathrooms are hardly up to her standards.
