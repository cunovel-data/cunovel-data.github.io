{"id":85868,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"If I had bangs, I could hide George from the rest of the world. But I don\u0027t. I head to the barracks with my hand over George and sneak past Jess. Lifting my makeup case, I pull out my trusty cover-up. But as I pat it on and examine it in my small travel mirror, the cover-up looks like caked-on silly putty. Besides, when I sweat the stuff is going to come right off. So I do the next best thing: I pull out my travel first-aid kit and cover George up with one of those round Band-Aids. \"When George is hidden from the world, I head to the courtyard to wait for Ronit to order us into formation. Nathan is outside, his tongue fully recovered from the bee incident. \"What the hell happened to your forehead?\" Nathan asks with a grimace. I swear he says it so loud everyone within a mile can hear him. \"Nothing,\" I say, hoping against all hope he\u0027ll drop the subject. \"I\u0027ve got two theories,\" he says. \"Either you cut yourself shaving your monobrow, or you\u0027re covering up a huge zit.\" \"Shut up or I\u0027ll make you eat another bee.\" \"Hi, Nathan,\" Miranda says. \"Let me guess what\u0027s for breakfast,\" Jessica says as she walks up to us. \"Ant-encrusted toast, hard-boiled eggs, and delicious bee-jam.\" Her voice trails off after a glance at my forehead. I\u0027m trying to look the other way, but she grabs my arm. \"Amy, please tell me you didn\u0027t touch it.\" \"I didn\u0027t touch it,\" I say roughly. I\u0027m not lying. I didn\u0027t touch it, I mutilated it. Nathan pretends to cough, but I know he\u0027s laughing. \"She\u0027s got a big zit she\u0027s covering up but is too embarrassed to admit it. Come on, Amy, fess up,\" he says, then reaches over to pull the Band-Aid off. I slap his hand away. \"How big is it?\" Miranda asks. \"I told you to leave it alone,\" Jess scolds. \"Okay, okay everyone!\" I yell, then pull the Band-Aid off and point to my forehead. \"Everyone, meet George.\" Nathan pretends to gag. \"That looks so nasty, Amy. \"What the hell did you do to it?\" \"You named your zit?\" Miranda asks. \"I figured since George and I are going to be together for a while, he might as well have a name,\" I tell her, ignoring Nathan. Jess is still staring at my forehead as if she\u0027s not quite sure how I managed to turn tiny George into big, red, angry George. Nathan is laughing again. \"Does it look really bad?\" I ask my friends. Nathan gives me a resounding \"Yes!\" Miranda shrugs and nods at the same time. Jess says, \"They might make you go to the infirmary for fear it\u0027s something contagious.\" I slap my hand over my forehead and run back to the barracks. Unfortunately, Tori is still in the room. \"We\u0027re supposed to be outside in less than a minute,\" Tori says. \"So leave.\" I pull out my mirror and look up at Tori. \"Do you mind? I need some privacy.\" \"For what?\" \"It\u0027s a long story that has to do with a big zit I named George.\" I examine George in the mirror. Unfortunately, Tori sees him too. Her lips curl up in disgust. \"Eww.\" \"I know. You want to call me a spaz again because I have a zit?\" \"No. But you better go out there before you get in trouble for being late.\" George looks nastier than before. \"What am I gonna do?\" Tori shrugs. \"Put on a hat.\" \"I don\u0027t even know where mine is. Besides, George might get infected from rubbing against the material.\" \"I could cut you some bangs, if you want,\" Tori says. \"My mom\u0027s a hairdresser.\" \"Really?\" \"Really. Your face structure would actually look good with bangs.\" \"You\u0027d really cut me bangs?\" \"Anything to get you to stop looking at yourself in the mirror.\" She pulls out scissors from her duffle and slides my hair through her fingers. \"Trust me.\" She has no clue how hard that is for me, but Rabbi Glassman says that sometimes it helps to make people feel needed. \"I trust you,\" I tell her. \"Thanks for sharing your story about your parents when we had kitchen duty,\" she says as she snips away. \"I see you with all the stuff you have, and I think you have the perfect life.\" \"It\u0027s my parents\u0027 way of making up for their shortcomings.\" \"There. I\u0027m done.\" She puts the scissors down and holds up the mirror so I can inspect my new do. I never really wanted bangs. I was six years old the last time I had bangs, and they feel weird brushing up against my forehead. I have to admit they don\u0027t look half bad. Outside, sure enough, everyone is in formation. Tori and I come sauntering out. Sergeant B-S isn\u0027t here, thank goodness. But Avi is. All eyes turn to Avi. \"Why are you late?\" he asks us. \"It\u0027s my fault, not Tori\u0027s,\" I tell him. \"It was a medical issue.\" \"Are you sick?\" he asks, his voice laced with concern that makes my knees weak. He cocks his head and inspects me, looking for a wound or weakness. \"Not exactly.\" \"Do you have a fever?\" To my horror, he picks his hand up and is about to feel my forehead. I jump back, afraid he\u0027ll find George. \"No!\" \"Amy, my patience is wearing thin. Fast.\" I can tell. \"Its not a fever. Tori was cutting my hair.\" \"Since when is cutting hair a medical issue?\" \"It just is.\" Avi looks up to the sky, probably asking God for the strength to deal with me. I don\u0027t blame him. Truth is, I am aspaz. \"Tori, get back in formation. Amy, give me twenty push-ups. \"Can I do girlie ones?\" \"No.\" \"I can\u0027t do guy\u0027s ones. I don\u0027t have enough upper arm strength.\" \"Yes, you do.\" He points to the ground. \"Stop stalling.\" I stretch out on the ground. Thankfully we\u0027re on a paved sidewalk so I don\u0027t have little pebbles sticking into my palms. With my hands on either side of my shoulders and the tips of my toes on the pavement, I straighten my arms. I look up, and stare straight into Avis eyes. He\u0027s squatting right in front of me. For him, pushups are no big deal. For me, on the other hand... \"Stop thinking and just do them,\" he says softly so no one else can hear. \"Pretend your body is a piece of wood and your elbows are hinges.\" He gets in position and demonstrates it for me. I bend my elbows a tiny bit and straighten them. \"That\u0027s not a pushup, Amy.\" \"It is for me.\" \"Go down farther.\" He demonstrates it again, reminding me of when I did them in front of Sergeant B-S my first night here. I look into his eyes, which have determination written all over them. \"I wouldn\u0027t ask you to do something you couldn\u0027t do,\" he says. \"Push yourself.\" The thing is, I want to make Avi proud of me. And if he says I can do it, maybe I can. I bend my elbows again, all the while trying to keep the rest of my body straight. My boobs are almost touching the ground when I straighten. \"That\u0027s it. Nineteen more,\" Avi says, doing them right along with me. I do two more, my arms shaking and struggling each time. Going down isn\u0027t the problem; it\u0027s the pushing up part. \"Seventeen more.\" I take a deep breath. My arms are tired. I\u0027m not mad at Avi for punishing me. It\u0027s my own fault for being so vain. I look up, wishing everyone wasn\u0027t watching. \"I have faith in you,\" Avi says softly. \"No matter what, I always have.\" Now I want to cry, because he probably has more faith in me than I have in myself. As I lower my body again, Avis determination makes me do more pushups. Every time I think I\u0027m going to collapse, I look up into his beautiful milk-chocolate eyes for strength. Sweat is dripping off my forehead. My shirt is wet from sweat and I probably smell, but I finish my twenty pushups and stand up. \"You\u0027d be a great soldier if you didn\u0027t complain all the time.\" I shrug. \"And you\u0027d be a great boyfriend if you didn\u0027t kiss other girls.\" Chapter 17 Running should be saved for times when you\u0027re being chased After we sit through another classroom session on rifle safety and have dinner, we\u0027re informed that we\u0027ll be going on a night run. \"Like aTaco Bell run?\" I ask. \"Fun.\" Although I\u0027ve never seen aTaco Bell in Israel, I\u0027ve seen a few McDonald\u0027s. I had a McKebab at one last summer, with cheeps on the side (which is really just French fries). Ronit and Liron look at each other in confusion. \"What\u0027s aTaco Bell run?\" \"You know... a food run.\" Liron laughs. \"We weren\u0027t talking about a food run. We mean night run literally.\" \"Where you run at night,\" Ronit adds, just in case I don\u0027t get it. \"Oh.\" If I\u0027m to be completely honest, the last thing I want to do at nine p.m. is run. In fact, the last thing I ever want to do is run, period. I\u0027d hate running if it was at nine at night or nine in the morning (or three in the afternoon, for that matter). At nine on the dot, just when the sun has almost left us, we congregate in a big, open area right outside the base. I spot Nathan and pull him aside. \"Nathan, don\u0027t you think Miranda\u0027s awesome?\" \"Uh, yeah. Why?\" \"I was just wondering if you, you know, would ever consider her as more than a friend. You know, like girlfriend material.\" \"No. She\u0027s too serious. And too nice.\" \"Nice is a good trait, Nathan.\" \"Yeah, in a friend. I like Miranda as a friend. Get it? I need a raunchy and inappropriate girl... you know, someone I consider a challenge.\" \"I got it.\" Tori\u0027s the one. Nathan shrugs. \"Truth is, I know Miranda\u0027s had a crush on me for months. I tried thinking of her that way, but it didn\u0027t work. The yin/yang thing just isn\u0027t there. I feel bad about it, if that makes you feel any better.\" I sigh, knowing that pairing my two friends isn\u0027t going to work. \"Well, as long as you feel bad about it, I guess you\u0027re off the hook.\" \"What are you wearing on your head?\" Sergeant B-S asks me, cutting my conversation with Nathan short. I reach up and feel the hot-pink headlight my mom bought me for the trip. At the time I thought it was lame to wear a flashlight strapped to your forehead, but when I got ready for the night run that has nothing to do with food or Taco Bell, I put it on. \"A flashlight.\" \"Who told you to put it on?\" \"Nobody. I thought of it all by myself. It\u0027ll help me see where I\u0027m going.\" Sergeant B-S takes the flashlight off my head. \"A flashlight in a real military operation would give away your location.\" \"This isn\u0027t a real military operation,\" I say, stating the obvious. \"We\u0027re simulating one. No flashlights. Use the moon as your light.\" He hands my flashlight back to me and faces the rest of the unit. \"In a real operation, troops move at night. Since there are only a few hours of darkness, you have to move fast so the enemy is taken by surprise.\" Four guys are chosen to carry a stretcher while they run, with four more guys as backup stretcher-holders. Nathan is one of the backups. Two other guys are assigned to carry what they call \"jerry cans,\" which are water-filled jugs, on their backs.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-16.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
