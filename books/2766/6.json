I can\u0027t do my job when I have to check up on you, worry about you, or make sure you\u0027re okay,\" he explains when the guy is out of sight. \"You\u0027re a distraction.\" \"And what about that Liron girl in your unit? She\u0027s a girl. Why aren\u0027t you worried or distracted by her?\" \"She\u0027s not my girlfriend. You are. And she\u0027s Israeli-- you\u0027re American.\" \"So if I was Israeli, you\u0027d be fine with me being here?\" \"If you were Israeli, you wouldn\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027d be required to serve in the military. But you\u0027re American.\" Yeah, technically. But... \"My dad is Israeli, so that makes me half Israeli. And I\u0027m Jewish. I\u0027ve heard that every Jewish person can automatically get Israeli citizenship just because they\u0027re Jewish.\" \"But you\u0027re not Israeli, Amy. Tell me you\u0027re okay with trading in your designer sunglasses and designer clothes.\" He takes my hand in his and looks at my painted nails. \"And your pink nails, for dirt buried under your fingernails.\" I pull my hand away. \"For your information, Avi, I don\u0027t even own designer sunglasses.\" Okay, so technically I owned them a few hours ago, before they fell into the pee/ poop hole in the bathroom. But I\u0027d rather die than admit that fact. \"And even though I do have painted nails, and I\u0027d rather be at the beach than learning how to march in formation,\" I continue, examining my nails and noticing a new chip in my polish on my index finger that I\u0027ll have to fix later, \"I\u0027m doing this for you... for us.\" \"Gefen!\" a guy yells out. That guy just happens to be none other than Sergeant B-S. Oh, no! We\u0027re totally busted! Avi straightens and whirls around. \"\u0027Ken, Hamefa\u0027ked!\u0027 he says, then salutes to the sergeant. Sergeant B-S barks out some command in Hebrew. Then he says, \"Amy, go eat. Don\u0027t stop on your way there.\" \"It\u0027s my fault that Avi and I are alone,\" I tell Sergeant B-S. \"I--\" Avi takes my elbow and gives it a gentle squeeze, cutting my explanation short. \"Just do as he says. I would make that an order, because I\u0027m a higher rank than you. But I know you better than to do that. So I\u0027ll say please.\" \"I\u0027m sorry I got you in trouble,\" I tell Avi quickly, then run to the cheder ochel. Once there, everyone is busy eating dinner. Miranda waves me over. \"Amy, over here!\" I sit next to her and she pushes a plate full of food at me. \"Here. I got you food.\" I don\u0027t feel like eating, but know I need my strength. I nibble on bread and choke down the Israeli salad (which doesn\u0027t have any lettuce--what\u0027s up with that? It\u0027s just tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions). Every second or two I glance at the door to see if Avi walks in. I wonder how much trouble he\u0027s in and wish we could have avoided getting caught altogether. Five minutes later (which means I checked the front entrance about three hundred times), Avi walks in with the sergeant. Neither look happy. Avi s gaze briefly meets mine before he sits with the rest of the Sayeret Tzefa squad. \"Where were you?\" Tori says to me from the opposite side of the table. \"In the bathroom,\" I lie. \"Oh, really? Because I saw you go off with that Israeli guy you hugged this morning and I was worried. I mean, I know the rules state we can get kicked out of the program if we\u0027re caught fooling around.\" \"So you told the sergeant?\" \"Oh, no. Actually I told Ronit I was worried something happened to you. Of course she was talking to Sergeant Ben-Shimon at the time.\" Tori puts her fingers to her lips and sucks in a breath. \"I didn\u0027t get you in trouble, did I?\" I don\u0027t buy her fake concern for a second. I let out a big, hearty chuckle. \"No.\" Tori is officially a person I will never trust. The girl is as manipulative as this girl Roxanne at my school. Tori now gestures in the direction of Avi\u0027s table. \"How do you know him?\" \"He\u0027s her boyfriend,\" Miranda informs her cheerily. \"They\u0027ve been dating for a year.\" \"Wow. A long-distance relationship?\" \"Yep,\" I say. \"So are you guys exclusive or what?\" That\u0027s a tricky question. Avi and I agreed to have a don\u0027t ask/don\u0027t tell policy since we\u0027re apart for such long periods of time. If I go on a casual date, I\u0027m not going to tell Avi. He\u0027s not going to tell me if he\u0027s been on one, either. Avi and I are boyfriend and girlfriend, but we\u0027re trying to be realistic about our relationship. \"He\u0027s not available, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking,\" I say, more defensively than I mean to. If they weren\u0027t aware of it previously, our entire table now knows I\u0027m dating Avi. I try not to glance at him while we\u0027re eating, but I can\u0027t help it. A few times I catch him looking back at me, but as soon as we make eye contact he breaks it. This is definitely not turning out the way I expected. Has coming here been a huge mistake? After we\u0027re done eating and scrape our plates into the big garbage bins (that don\u0027t have liners so I\u0027m not sure how they clean them), we\u0027re excused to our barracks. I try to linger, hoping to exchange a few words with Avi, but Ronit comes up to me with a big frown on her face. \"Amy?\" she says. \"Yeah.\" \"Follow me.\" Chapter 9 Is it any wonder the person who invented pushups hasn\u0027t come forward to claim their invention? It\u0027s just me and Ronit walking away from everyone else. I follow my instructor to an open area, beyond the barracks. To my surprise, Avi and Sergeant B-S are waiting for us. Avi is standing at attention. \"Stand next to Avi,\" Ronit orders. I have to get Avi out of trouble. I\u0027m the one who lives in the gray areas of life, not Avi, so he shouldn\u0027t be reprimanded. \"We\u0027re very disappointed in both of you,\" Ronit says. \"It was my fault,\" I admit to our superiors. \"I begged him to talk to me in priv--\" The sergeant, with a very pissed-off look on his face (which has just gone a dark shade of red resembling a very red grape), cuts me offin a stern loud voice. \"Do not speak until spoken to!\" \"But he--\" \"Die!\" (I learned back in January that die means \"stop, enough!\" in Hebrew... because when Avi told my dog to \"die\" when it was sniffing his crotch, I thought he was being rude, but he was just giving a command.) I cover my mouth with my hands to stop myself from accidentally opening my lips and getting myself or Avi into more trouble. Sergeant B-S steps between Avi and me. He gives Avi an order in Hebrew, then says, \"Gefen, Kadimal\" Then the sergeant turns to me. \"Your job is to watch him. Come,\" he says, placing me a few feet in front of my boyfriend so I\u0027m facing him. \"Watch him?\" I question. \"Yes. Just stand and watch.\" I know if I protest it\u0027s going to give him another reason to yell at me. Avi, the ever-obedient soldier, gets on the gravel ground and does a pushup, then stands and our eyes meet. He repeats the pushup/standing exercise a few more times, and each time he stands our eyes meet. We can\u0027t talk, so our eye contact is the only way to communicate with each other. Avis straight, direct eye contact with me is telling me that he\u0027s okay... he\u0027s strong and he\u0027s fine. I\u0027m feeling worse than guilty. I wonder when he\u0027ll get to stop. Avi is still going strong after five minutes, even though his back must be bruised from the rifle strapped to him. His palms are probably raw and bleeding from the gravel, too, but he doesn\u0027t give any sign he\u0027s in pain. I hate watching this. The day has started to cool off, but I\u0027m sweating again. Every time he goes down for another pushup, I wince. When he comes up, I want to tell him I\u0027m sorry and won\u0027t lure him away again. After ten minutes, I swallow back tears and give Sergeant B-S a pleading look. He\u0027s got his arms folded in front of him, and doesn\u0027t show any sign of planning to let Avi stop any time soon. I know when Avi is in pain, even though by looking at him you couldn\u0027t tell. I know it because he stops looking directly at me when he stands between those pushups. He\u0027s looking forward, but not at me... he\u0027s looking through me. He\u0027s in \"the zone\" and is a robot now. It\u0027s a miracle he hasn\u0027t thrown up his dinner. I sure feel like throwing up mine. My stomach twists. I can\u0027t deal with the fact that I\u0027m just standing here doing nothing. I can\u0027t follow the order just to watch Avi. I know Avi won\u0027t stop until the sergeant says to, even if he\u0027s in pain. I get it. Break down the soldier until they understand rules are not to be broken. Ever. Or else. Avi and I cannot go away in private even if we\u0027re dating. He knew this, but I lured him to break the rules and he did. In the army there are no gray areas. I was wrong to ask him to break the rules, and Avi is paying the price for listening to me. The next time he stands, I mimic him like a mirror and get on the ground to do a pushup with him. I try and do a manly pushup without putting my knees on the ground, even though my arms have the strength of a spaghetti noodle. Silently I pray to God to give me strength. \"When Avi and I both stand, this time he looks right at me and is not in \"the zone\" anymore. He shakes his head just the slightest bit, telling me to stop mimicking him. But I won\u0027t. I did the crime; it\u0027s not fair that he\u0027s the only one doing the time. The sergeant wanted to make me feel guilty. It worked. I am back on the ground again, doing another pushup. Little pebbles get stuck to my sweaty palms, and it makes me cringe imagining what Avi\u0027s palms must feel like. But I don\u0027t stop. \"Die!\" Sergeant B-S says. For a second, I think he\u0027s giving an order for both of us to die on the spot... maybe he\u0027ll just take his gun and shoot us both. A harsh punishment for disobeying orders, but this is the army so maybe anything goes. But then I remember it means \"stop.\" Avi and I immediately stand at ease. \"I told you watch him. You\u0027re not good with following directions,\" the sergeant tells me. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m supposed to answer or not, so I stay silent. \"Gefen tells me you and him are, uh, together. Is this the truth?\" My eyes stay on Avi when I say, \"Yes, sir.\" \"This is a problem. On this base, between parachute training and Counter Terror School, Sayeret Tzefa trainees are assigned as instructors for the American volunteers. Special Ops soldiers must obey rules or they get reassigned. Eighty percent of Sayeret Tzefa trainees flunk training. Gefen might get reassigned as a driver if he doesn\u0027t obey the rules. And Gefen would rather die than be a driver. Nachon, Gefen?\" Avi stands tall and says, \"Ken, Hamefa\u0027kedr \"I understand,\" I say. \"It won\u0027t happen again.\" \"I don\u0027t care what you do off base or when Gefen is out of uniform. On my base, he\u0027s my soldier. Amy, you are a civilian trainee, don\u0027t forget that. Israeli soldiers are not to go off in private with civilian trainees of the opposite sex. Understand?\" \"Ken, sir,\" I say, using the Hebrew word for \"yes.\" It\u0027s one of the few Hebrew words that I actually know how to use correctly. \"You\u0027re both dismissed,\" he says. \"Zooz.\" Avi does an immediate about-face and jogs away as if he hasn\u0027t just pushed his body to the limit. I want to run after him and apologize. I itch to examine his palms and take away whatever pain and cuts and bruises he\u0027s endured because of me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-6.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
