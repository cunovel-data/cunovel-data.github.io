{"id":85865,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"No. It said no going off in private and fornicating. You really need to read the details more carefully. Anyways, nobody under the age of fifty knows the actual definition of fornicating so it won\u0027t hold up in a court of law.\" \"I told you I\u0027m not doing this, Amy. \"Well, unless we pretend to date, and then after we\u0027re done with the Israeli army portion of the trip I pretend to break up with you and you pretend \u0027to be devastated in front of Tori. You can tell Tori after the fake breakup that I\u0027m good at everything. You know, make me sound like the stud you know I am. You have to promise to set us up, without her knowing you\u0027re setting us up. Then you\u0027ve got what you want, and I\u0027ve got what I want. Deal?\" I don\u0027t mention that if he was a real stud, he wouldn\u0027t need me pretending he\u0027s one. I also don\u0027t mention that Tori hates me, so the last person she\u0027ll listen to is me. But whatever. \"Fine.\" Before I can think twice about my deal with Nathan, he takes my hand and leads me to the middle of where our group has assembled around Avi. Avi is standing with his arms crossed, waiting impatiently. His jaw is clenched as he watches us walk up. \"No hand holding,\" he barks. Nathan gazes at me with love and tenderness, then kisses the back of my hand before letting it go. Avi explains that we\u0027ll be racing against another team, and it\u0027s up to us to make sure everyone participates in each obstacle. \"What if I can\u0027t scale that wall?\" Miranda asks. \"Have one of your teammates help you over it,\" Avi tells her. \"You\u0027re a team. Nobody is left behind. Everyone finishes or everyone loses.\" I hate races. They cause me too much stress. But Avi is a pro at this, and I\u0027m ready to prove I\u0027m not all talk and drama. I can kick some serious obstacle course butt when it comes right down to it. I think. The first heat is our team against Liron\u0027s team. I want to beat her team so bad, I can taste victory in my mouth. If only I paid more attention when they explained how to climb up that rope. Sergeant B-S blows his trusty whistle. We all run to the balance beam. One after another we walk across it. Next up are the monkey bars. I haven\u0027t done them since third grade, when I caught Michael Mat-thews looking up my pink-and-white plaid skirt. When I fell right on top of that little perv, and my knee connected with his face, I was secretly glad he went crying to Mrs. Feinstein with a bloody nose. Tori is first. She maneuvers across the monkey bars easily enough, although she skipped the last three bars because she fell. David goes after her, skipping every other one and finishes effortlessly. Mirandas next. \"I can\u0027t do this,\" she tells us. \"Try,\" I say. \"Why try when I know I can\u0027t do it?\" She sounds more and more like me every day--it\u0027s scary. Avi said we have to do it, and work as a team, so how can she do it without actually doing it? I\u0027m trying to think outside the box. It\u0027s a little hard to think when I see that four people from Liron\u0027s team have already successfully crossed the bars. Ah, I\u0027ve got it! \"What if we get on all fours and you step on our backs?\" Miranda shrugs. I tell the team my plan. Me, Jess, Nathan, and the rest of the guys kneel down. Miranda walks on our backs while holding onto the bars above. I catch Avi nodding in approval and pointing to us as he talks to the sergeant. Miranda finishes with the bars really quickly, then profusely apologizes to the rest of the group as we each maneuver across the bars and head to the next obstacle. Okay, so everyone finished the bars easily except for me. I got to the first bar, then slid off because my palms were sweaty and a bee buzzing in my ear freaked me out, even though I knew it was probably a worker bee. In the end, my team had to go down on their hands and knees again. I walked over them while grabbing each bar, just like Miranda. The next obstacle is a tunnel. We all climb through easily and stop when we get to the rope. It\u0027s at least the height of a flagpole, if not higher. I turn to my group. \"I just want everyone to know that I\u0027m afraid of heights.\" \"Then don\u0027t look down,\" Tori says. She steps on the first knot and starts climbing. \"Hold it so it doesn\u0027t swing!\" she yells at me. I hold down the rope, even though I\u0027m tempted to jiggle it hard until she falls off. I don\u0027t do it, because that would be mean. I might be whiny and a drama queen, but I like to think I\u0027m not viciously mean to people. David shimmies up the rope right behind Tori. When they finish, Jess climbs and then the guys hold the rope for Miranda. For a girl who couldn\u0027t do the monkey bars, she\u0027s pretty impressive on the rope. Now it\u0027s my turn. Just the thought of going up that high makes me dizzy. I turn to Nathan. \"Nathan, I don\u0027t think I can do it. I\u0027ll get vertigo. I don\u0027t want to die.\" Nathan surveys the rope and says to me, \"Well, nobody said we can\u0027t do it together. Go up and I\u0027ll follow behind you. You are my girlfriend; it\u0027s only natural we do it as a couple.\" I roll my eyes so only Nathan can see. He kisses me on the nose, putting on the boyfriend act for anyone who cares enough to watch. \"When Ethan holds the bottom of the rope, I step on the first big knot. \"Go up one,\" Nathan instructs. I pull myself up to the next knot, and Nathan steps on the first. His arms are wrapped around my knees, holding me tight. \"You okay?\" \"So far, so good.\" \"Go up one more,\" he says, loosening his hold. I go up another one. I feel Nathan right behind me, then holding me tight again. \"Any vertigo yet!\" \"Not yet.\" \"Go up another one.\" \"Come on!\" Tori yells. \"Just do it!\" \"I swear if she yells at me again I\u0027m gonna punch her in the face. If I get out of this alive,\" I add. \"Ooh, a girl fight. \"What a turn-on.\" \"My foot is close to your nuts, Nathan, and you\u0027re suspended on a rope. It\u0027s probably not the best time to piss me off.\" \"You kick me in the nuts, I\u0027m pulling your pants down,\" he says, following me up another section of rope. \"Avi will kill you if you do that.\" \"I\u0027ll already be dead from the fall so it won\u0027t matter. One more, Amy.\" I close my eyes as we get higher. I have to admit, when Nathans arms are around my knees, I feel safe. Up and up we go. I close my eyes when I get to the top and tentatively ring the bell. \"Grab the handle and ride to the bottom,\" Nathan says. \"I can\u0027t.\" \"Yes, you can. You\u0027ve come all this way--you can\u0027t stop now.\" \"We\u0027re losing because of you!\" Tori yells at me. \"\"What a spaz,\" I hear her say. That\u0027s it. My anger overrides my fear. I grab the handle and shut my eyes tight while my body glides back to earth. When my feet safely reach the ground, I open my eyes. Tori is laughing at me. Jessica looks ready to murder her, probably because she\u0027s my best friend and we always look out for each other. I storm up to the laughing hyena. \"You are seriously the most annoying person,\" I tell her. \"I wonder how anyone can be friends with you.\" She pushes me. At another time or place I might have lost my balance and fallen on my butt. But adrenaline rushes through my body, giving me strength beyond my normal capabilities. I push her back, and she goes flying. She lands on her butt. I stand above her and let it all out. \"Stop harassing me, you double-jointed, breast-challenged, designer-knockoff-wearing bully.\" Tori\u0027s mouth is open wide. \"You hit me!\" \"No, I didn\u0027t. I pushed you.\" \"It\u0027s against the Sababa rules to assault another person. I\u0027m telling!\" Oh, no. \"You pushed me first, Tori.\" Geez, and they call me a drama queen. Tori storms up to Avi. \"Your girlfriend assaulted me.\" \"You\u0027ve got two facts wrong. She\u0027s not my girlfriend. And you assaulted her first. Get back to the group and finish the course.\" \"She pushed me.\" \"This is not a discussion. Get back to the group and finish the course.\" \"Can\u0027t we just give up?\" Nathan asks, watching as the other group nears the finish line. \"We\u0027ve obviously lost.\" Looking into Avis eyes, I see strength and determination. He would never give up. He won\u0027t let us give up, either. \"Let\u0027s keep going until we finish,\" I say to my team. We walk half-heartedly to the next obstacle. When it\u0027s my turn to go through the swinging tire, I put my hands and feet in first. It\u0027s a big mistake, because now I\u0027m stuck. The front half of me is through the tire, but my butt is sticking out the other end. \"Push me, Nathan.\" \"You\u0027re giving me permission to touch your ass?\" \"Not touch it. Just push it.\" \"Avis watching. Should I caress it first to make him jealous?\" \"Oh, yeah. What a great idea. Caressing my butt while it\u0027s stuck in a tire is definitely going to make him jealous. Not.\" Nathan puts his hand on my butt. \"Don\u0027t fart.\" He pushes me hard until I pop out of the tire. We\u0027re all sweaty and hot and it\u0027s worse because we know we lost. The cargo net is easy enough to maneuver, although my foot slips a few times and I get rope burn on the back of my legs. At the half wall, Miranda and I are hopeless. The guys hold Miranda on their shoulders and heave her over, then do the same for me. I swear, the wall is impossible. You have to have major arm strength to pull your body over it. Arm strength that I just don\u0027t possess. After we step through a bunch of tires, we reach the last obstacle: crawling under the net. I look over at Avi watching us and wonder what\u0027s going through his head. There\u0027s hardly any room under the net. I kneel on the ground and duck my head. The ground is muddy, so I\u0027m definitely getting dirty. I can\u0027t even crawl; I have to wiggle on my belly in order to go under this thing. I use my fingernails to dig into the ground and my toes to help me slither forward like a snake. Seriously, how can Avi do the entire course in just over a half a minute? \"Push off my hands,\" Nathan says from behind me. He pushes me forward. I feel the time ticking away as I slide through... all the while my boobs are squished into the ground. My big C/D-cup boobs can probably fit into a training bra now. I climb out and we all jog to the finish line. I feel victorious, although I must look like a complete mess. And we are in fact the big losers. Avi has us sit on the ground while the other teams take their turns competing on the course. Tori grudgingly mumbles something about her uncle who\u0027s a lawyer and about what it did and did not say regarding assault in that infamous Sababa brochure. Our group doesn\u0027t get to compete in the final heat because we came in last. \"When I look up, Avi is standing over me. \"Amy, can I talk to you for a minute?\" \"Whatever you want to say to me, you can say in front of Nathan,\" I tell Avi. \"We have no secrets between us.\" Avi takes a deep breath, says, \"Forget it,\" then walks away to stand by himself. \"He\u0027s brooding, Amy,\" Nathan informs me. \"I know.\" I did tell Noah that whatever Avi wanted to say, he should say it to my face. Well, I guess it\u0027s time for me to hear it firsthand. I shouldn\u0027t delay the inevitable, dreaded conversation. \"Nathan, I\u0027m going over to him.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-13.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
