{"id":85877,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"Me, too. By the way, Avi and I are back together.\"\n \"I knew it was just a matter of time. You guys are meant for each other.\"\n I look at the gun resting on her lap. Guns are used as a means to help Israelis protect their land and their people.\n I\u0027m sure these guns mean something totally different to the Palestinians. \"Jess, what do you think will happen between you andTarik in the future?\"\n I\u0027ve never asked her this before, because I know she loves him and doesn\u0027t want to think about life without him. But if it\u0027s not going to work out, why torture yourself by falling more in love with a guy you know you can\u0027t have a future with?\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Jess says. \"I don\u0027t think about it.\"\n I think about my future all the time, and always imagine Avi in it. \"Have you ever gotten in a fight and thought of breaking up?\"\n Jess chuckles. \"Sure, but I can\u0027t stop dating Tarik any more than you can stop dating Avi. When the time comes to talk about the serious stuff, maybe we\u0027ll decide it won\u0027t work. Until then, I\u0027m not stressing about it. Don\u0027t tell me you and Avi talk about the future.\"\n I smile at her. \"Yeah, we do.\"\n Her mouth opens wide. \"Wow. Please tell me you\u0027re not gonna get married at eighteen and skip college.\"\n \"I\u0027m not getting married or skipping college. But I hope one day...\" My voice trails off, thinking about what our life might be like in the future.\n \" ...you\u0027ll have little Amys and Avis running around the house,\" Jess finishes for me.\n \"Maybe. But we won\u0027t name them Amy and Avi--you know most Jewish people don\u0027t name their kids after a living relative.\" Rabbi Glassman told me it\u0027s because of an old superstition that the Angel of Death will accidentally take the baby instead of the older relative of the same name. As if the Angel of Death would be confused. Maybe I don\u0027t believe it, but I\u0027m not taking any chances. There won\u0027t be an Amy Jr. or Avi Jr. in my house. Naming zits is another story.\n \"So when did you and Avi have this discussion?\" \"Last night. We stayed at a hotel in Ein Gedi.\" \"Just the two of you?\"\n \"Yeah.\" I pull out my suitcase and pretend to rearrange my stuff.\n \"So? Come on, Amy. Don\u0027t keep me in suspense.\" I look around to make sure nobody is eavesdropping. \"We didn\u0027t have sex, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re getting at,\" I whisper. \"I mean, I wanted to. And he wanted to.\"\n Jess hasn\u0027t been a virgin for years, ever since she and Michael Greenberg did it sophomore year. But Jess isn\u0027t the result of two people getting together one night out of lust and nothing else; I am.\n Jess waves her hand in a \"come on, spill the beans\" gesture. We seriously have less than five minutes before the next activity. I can\u0027t possibly describe how amazing it is that Avi and I reconnected. My body is still humming from the touch of his hands and the sound of his voice whispering sexy things in my ear, making me shiver with excitement. I\u0027m definitely applying to colleges in Israel so we can be together whenever possible. I can\u0027t wait until our next boot camp activity just so I can see him again... even if we can\u0027t be \"with\" each other. As long as we can see each other, I\u0027m totally psyched.\n Ronit comes into the barracks with Liron and they tell us to line up outside. I actually smile at Liron and don\u0027t fear that she\u0027s my rival. I pick up George II and head outside. The guys are waiting for us. I know we\u0027re going to the shooting range to practice, but I don\u0027t see anyone from Avis unit besides Liron here.\n Liron taps me on the shoulder. \"Avi\u0027s not here. He wanted me to let you know that he was sorry he couldn\u0027t say goodbye.\"\n What? Avi s not here? For how long? \"Will he be back tomorrow?\"\n Liron shakes her head. \"The Sayeret Tzefa trainees have been taken off base for intensive combat training exercises before they head to Counter Terror School. It was a surprise for everyone. Since I\u0027m an operations specialist, I can stay on base until your unit graduates.\"\n The thought of not seeing Avi for the rest of my trip to Israel is terrible, especially after last night. But Avi would want me to stay strong and positive.\n \"You okay?\" Liron asks me.\n Blinking back the tears about to spill out, I force a brave smile. \"Yeah. I\u0027m okay.\"\n We\u0027re introduced to our new team leaders. There are two Israeli girls assigned as new team leaders, and three guys.\n As one of the new team leaders steps in front of us, I notice she\u0027s wearing sunglasses suspiciously similar to the $235 ones I dropped in the poop hole my first day here.\n My mouth drops open. They are my sunglasses. I look over at Jessica, who I know also noticed because she\u0027s got the same open-mouthed, shocked expression I do.\n \"She fished them out,\" I whisper to Jess.\n Jess shakes her head. \"I\u0027m speechless, Amy. What are you gonna do? Ask for them back?\"\n \"Absolutely not!\" If a girl wants those glasses so bad she\u0027ll fish in poop to get them, she can be my guest and keep them forever.\n Noah got reassigned, and is also now a team leader for our unit. I wish Noah had another message from Avi, but he doesn\u0027t. I also wish I had Noah\u0027s outlook on life... no expectations, and then you won\u0027t be disappointed.\n When we get to the shooting range, I walk up to Nathan as we\u0027re waiting for our turn to shoot. \"Just so you know, I\u0027m breaking up with you.\"\n Nathan shakes his head vigorously. \"Nuh uh. You can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m supposed to break up with you first. That was our deal.\"\n \"So break up with me. I\u0027m back with Avi.\"\n \"Well, you can\u0027t tell Tori. You promised to pretend to be devastated about our breakup.\" Nathan pouts. \"How\u0027s it gonna look to Tori when she sees you broke up with me to go out with that... that beast?\" He puts his arm around me and says, \"Come on, Amy. You\u0027re my best friend. What\u0027s a girl best friend worth if she won\u0027t help you get laid?\"\n I push him away from me. \"Eww. You\u0027re so gross.\"\n \"I\u0027m a guy, I was born gross. Now go tell Tori we broke up. And that you\u0027re devastated. I want to see some tears. And don\u0027t forget to tell her I\u0027m good in bed.\"\n \"I\u0027m not telling her that.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because what if it\u0027s not true? I don\u0027t want my credibility questioned.\"\n \"Are you insinuating what I think you\u0027re insinuating?\"\n I hold my hands up. \"Don\u0027t blame me. Listen, Nathan. Ever since you broke up with Becky--*\n \"Bicky.\"\n \"Whatow her name is. You don\u0027t have to act like a player. I\u0027m only gonna say this once so you don\u0027t get a big head. You\u0027re cute, with that streaked-blond messy-haired garage-band-guy look you\u0027ve got goin\u0027 on.\" I gesture to his hair and cute boyish face. \"You\u0027re cool... when you\u0027re not eating my white chocolate Kit Kats. And you\u0027re funny... in an entertaining, Muppety sort of way. I\u0027m not setting you up with Tori just so you can get into her pants. I\u0027ll set you up with Tori because you\u0027re a great guy.\"\n \"You think I\u0027m a great guy?\"\n I roll my eyes. \"When you\u0027re not being an idiot you are. But I\u0027ve got to warn you, Tori\u0027s got issues.\"\n \"I do, too.\" Considering he doesn\u0027t have parents around and lives with his aunt and uncle, who aren\u0027t deliriously happy to be fostering their nephew, I\u0027m well aware of Nathan\u0027s issues.\n \"There\u0027s just one more problem,\" I tell him, as Sergeant B-S calls us to take our places on the range.\n \"What?\"\n \"Nothing I can\u0027t handle.\" I don\u0027t tell Nathan that while I\u0027m trying to get Tori to fall in love with him, I have to get Miranda to fall out of love with him. Nathan may rock Miranda\u0027s world, but he doesn\u0027t feel the same way about her. That\u0027s not to say that it will never happen... it just won\u0027t happen now. As much as I hate to admit it, Nathan and Tori have potential. They\u0027ve both got chutzpah ... a lot of attitude and nerve. Both of them could use a person to challenge them.\n \"Just don\u0027t tell Tori anything that\u0027ll ruin my reputation as a stud,\" Nathan says as he releases the magazine to his M16.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Nathan. You can do that all on your own.\"\n The sergeant passes out bullets and tells us to load our magazines. I look down at George II. I don\u0027t have Avi to help me this time. Noah is walking behind us, making sure everyone knows what they\u0027re doing. I look over at Miranda, fitting her bullets in the magazine chamber just like everyone else. I raise my hand and wave Noah over to me.\n \"Hey, Amy!\" he says with a big smile. \"How\u0027s it goin\u0027?\"\n \"Good.\"\n He kneels next to me. \"Need help?\"\n \"Not me. My friend Miranda over there...you met her in the kitchen when we had the bee incident. She says she knows how to shoot, but that\u0027s just a cover-up. She needs help. She\u0027s just too shy to ask for it.\"\n Noah pats me on the shoulder. \"I got it. I\u0027ll go over there and not help her, if you know what I mean.\" He walks toward Miranda and kneels next to her. When she says she\u0027s okay, he stays with her and chats while she loads and aims the rifle. I think I hear her laugh at something he says right before she shoots.\n I might just open my own matchmaking service when I get back to Chicago. I set up my dad and Maria this winter. Seriously, it might be hereditary...maybe my great-great-great-grandmother was a matchmaker in some little village in Russia or Germany.\n As I load George II with ammunition and get in position to shoot, I think back to my first time on the range, when Avi was lying next to me, placing my fingers into the correct position and relaxing me with his voice.\n I imagine he\u0027s here with me now, acting as my support and guide. With the butt of the rifle against my shoulder, I put the rifle into the V in my left hand to steady the barrel. I settle my fingers into position, pretending Avi\u0027s hands are patiently guiding mine. As I aim at the target ahead of me and put my finger on the trigger, I take a breath and hold it while I fire.\n I hit the target. Yeah!\n I fire again. Another hit!\n And again.\n \"Avodah tovah --nice job,\" I hear Sergeant B-S\u0027s voice from behind me.\n I look back at his approving nod. \"Thanks, sir,\" I say.\n For the rest of the day, I remember that \"nice job\" and the approving nod from Sergeant B-S and it gives me strength. Until right after dinner, when Ronit gives us the news.\n \"Yes, the rumors are true. We\u0027re going on a night hike and sleeping in the desert tonight.\"\n Like Noah, I force myself to have low expectations and keep a positive attitude. I can\u0027t help thinking about what Sofia said: You\u0027re a Barak. No Barak is a quitter. But I also can\u0027t help thinking about desert scorpions, snakes, and hairy spiders. I\u0027m thinking about other comforts of home as I raise my hand.\n \"Amy, do you have a question?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"Umm...is there a bathroom where we\u0027re headed?\"\n \"Absolutely.\" She comes back and holds up a small shovel. \"The entire place is one big bathroom. Just dig a hole and relieve yourself.\"\n Chapter 26\n Being a leader sometimes means taking one for the team.\n We line up with our rifles strapped to our backs and our canteens freshly filled with water. \"We\u0027ve been told that sleeping bags will be issued at our final destination, but it might just be a rumor. What isn\u0027t a rumor is that we\u0027re sleeping in our fatigues--talk about roughing it.\n The girls are freaking out about the toilet situation, so we\u0027ve all come up with a plan to bring Jess\u0027s biodegradable wipies in our pockets. As a last-minute grab, I snatch my pink satin pillow off my mattress. I won\u0027t be able to sleep without it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-25.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) \n Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.

But things turn out to be different from what she\u0027d hoped for. She sleeps in a bunk bed underneath coils that look ready to give way, she\u0027s being worked to the bone, and the bathrooms are hardly up to her standards.
