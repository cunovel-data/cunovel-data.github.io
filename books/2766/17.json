{"id":85869,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The rest of us wait to be led on our run. I don\u0027t know what to do with my headlight, so I strap it on my head and turn the light off. Yes, I\u0027m aware it looks ridiculous, but at least it covers up George. Sergeant B-S points to the front of the line. \"Stretcher people, move up front. People with jerry cans are next. Then slow runners and then good runners.\" \"Why are good runners last?\" I question. \"So they can help the runners who aren\u0027t so fast,\" Liron informs us. \"We\u0027re only as good as our slowest runner.\" \"I need a volunteer,\" Sergeant B-S barks out. Yeah, right. As if. Jess and I look at each other knowingly. We\u0027ve been warned not to volunteer. Especially when we don\u0027t even know what we\u0027re volunteering for. Plus, I\u0027m dreading running at night as it is... the last thing I need to do is carry something as well. I have my big boobs to carry, which is more than enough for one person to handle. Since nobody raises their hand, Sergeant B-S walks among us to pick the unlucky person for the mysterious task. I learned a long time ago that you lessen your chances of being picked if you don\u0027t make eye contact with the picker. I concentrate on my fingernails instead, as if I find my cuticles the most interesting things I\u0027ve ever laid my eyes on. Out of the corner of my eye I see Sergeant B-S moving in front of me. I hold my breath and pray he passes me. He does. Phew. But he stops right in front of Jessica. \"You,\" he says. Oh, no. Poor Jess. \"Me?\" Jess chokes out. \"Move to the front of the line. You\u0027ll be carried on the stretcher, as the pretend-wounded.\" Jess\u0027s eyes light up. \"So I don\u0027t have to run?\" \"No.\" \"Cool!\" Jess gives me an excited look before taking her place on the stretcher. I watch in envy as the stretcher-carriers lift her up. The line starts moving, and already I feel like I\u0027m in the Chicago Marathon. I sure hope we won\u0027t be running 26.2 miles. We start out at a slow jog on the paved road, but then the front of the line gains momentum and speed just as we\u0027re led up some rocky areas. Jess is lying down, enjoying a ride on a stretcher, while I\u0027m running with a dorky unlit headlight strapped to my head. Avi is bringing up the rear with Nimrod. They\u0027re both in full military gear again, with vests, rifles, and everything, which is probably heavier than the jerry cans. The area gets steeper and steeper. We\u0027re running up a mountain. I wonder if, when I get to the top, I can just roll down. Soon I\u0027m struggling to keep up. Miranda has fallen behind, and I hear Nimrod urging her on. I try to drink from my canteen, but it all spills down my neck and the front of my shirt because it\u0027s not easy to drink and run at the same time. I\u0027m not a fast runner, and when the good runners catch up to me, I get frustrated. Especially because I see Jess in the distance, lying on the stretcher like Cleopatra being carried by her manservants. When I\u0027m sweating and panting and think I can\u0027t run anymore, Avis words from earlier echo in my head. Push yourself. I have faith in you. I run faster, the mantra helping me along. I feel victorious when I catch up to the guys running with the jerry cans. Avis right. I can do this. My arms are moving fast, my legs are moving fast, and I\u0027m ignoring the fact that my canteen is banging against my side with every stride. I think of all the soldiers who have it worse, like everyone in the Sayeret Tzefa unit. They have to carry a big rifle, wear a heavy vest, and still run. I\u0027m a machine now, running fast without thinking about how much I hate it or want to go to sleep. I\u0027m not thinking about Avi, or George the Zit, or Nathan, or Tori, or Miranda, or even Jess aka Cleopatra... I am one with the earth. Except... My toe hits what must be a rock, stopping my momentum. I\u0027m gonna fall. I try to get my hands out to break the impact, but my reflexes aren\u0027t as fast as my feet. I slam to the ground. I\u0027m not lucky enough to fall on pavement or grass--just gravel and stones. My hips get slammed against sharp rocks. Pebbles slice into my forearms as I slide over them. As my chin scrapes the ground like a plane landing on a runway, my headlight slides off George and crashes onto the bridge of my nose, blocking my view. Damn. That. Hurt. My body is paralyzed from shock and pain. I\u0027m afraid to move. My forearms are burning like someone has lit a match, and the flames are licking my skin. Some people have passed me, but others have stopped. There\u0027s commotion. At least I haven\u0027t fainted, which is a good thing. \"Are you okay?\" someone asks. \"She totally wiped out,\" someone else adds. \"Amy!\" It\u0027s Avis voice. He doesn\u0027t sound like a military commando anymore. He sounds concerned. His concern, along with the burning in my arms and knees and chin, makes me emotional. As I swallow back tears, a warm, comforting hand pulls off my headlight and pushes the hair out of my face. \"Amy, can you move?\" I dread the thought of moving. I\u0027d rather stay here for a while because I fear the additional injuries I\u0027ve gotten and don\u0027t know about yet. \"I think so,\" I say, wincing as I attempt, and fail, to sit up. \"Oh, God, I\u0027m so embarrassed.\" Avi orders the gawkers to keep going. Nimrod urges the unit forward and leaves Avi to tend to my injuries. \"Everyone\u0027s gone. It\u0027s just us.\" \"Aren\u0027t we going to get in trouble if we\u0027re alone?\" I sniff a couple of times, then wipe my nose with my sleeve. I\u0027m giving up preserving my ego. In fact, my ego is nonexistent now... I think I left it back in Chicago. \"It\u0027s fine. I\u0027m trained in first aid.\" I swipe away the tears running down my cheeks as Avi slowly helps me sit up. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I say, sniffing again. \"I need to get up so I can finish the run.\" \"You\u0027re not doing anything until I know the extent of your injuries.\" I push his hands away as he pulls up my now shredded sleeves. \"Stop.\" \"Don\u0027t be stubborn, Amy.\" I try to stand, but Avi pushes me back down. He swears when he bends my elbow and sees the damage. \"You\u0027re hurt. There\u0027s blood all over your arms.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. If you got your arm shot off, you\u0027d jump right up and finish the run because you\u0027re superhuman.\" \"I\u0027m not superhuman.\" \"Sure you are. Liron is, too.\" He stops his examination and looks at me. \"Huh?\" \"She\u0027s the female version of you. If she fell, she\u0027d jump up and finish this stupid running exercise on these stupid rocks that jut out of the stupid ground without warning.\" \"That\u0027s a lot of stupids,\" he says. \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s how I feel right now. Like everything is stupid.\" I feel my hot, stupid tears streaming down my dirty, dusty face. \"I need to clean out your stupid wounds with some stupid water. Okay?\" He pours water from his canteen on my arms. I suck in my breath. \"Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.\" \"Sorry. Just hang in there.\" He unzips a pocket on his vest and takes out what I guess is first aid stuff. He rips open a packet and pulls out a little white antiseptic pad. I jerk my arm away in anticipation of the antiseptic on my open wounds. \"Ouch!\" I say before he even touches me with it. \"It\u0027s gonna sting.\" \"Only for a second. It\u0027ll help numb it, too. Trust me.\" I give him a \"yeah, right\" look. \"Trust me,\" he says, so tenderly it rocks my insides. He takes one arm and gently wipes the cloth over my wound. \"When I wince, he softly blows on the cut, easing the sting. I close my eyes and try to focus on the pain instead of his breath and his fingers touching my skin. Feeling his soft breath makes me think about when we were under the blanket on the couch at my condo. His kisses started at my lips, trailed over my skin, and then his breath followed those kisses... and then his tongue followed that same path, giving me goose bumps. \"When he stopped, I begged him to do it again and again. And he did. \"The last thing I want is a female version of me,\" he says as he\u0027s busy pulling out another antiseptic pad. He takes my other arm and cleans it, blowing on it gently like before. It feels so good I never want him to stop. My anger at him weakens with each touch of his hand and each whisper of his breath on my skin. I hope he doesn\u0027t notice. He bandages both my forearms with gauze. \"It\u0027s only a temporary fix until I get you to the infirmary, but it\u0027ll have to do. What else hurts?\" \"Everything. My hips are burning, my knees are burning. My chin feels raw.\" Even my heart hurts--being this close to him and knowing that our relationship is over stabs like a knife. I moan. \"Does anything feel like it\u0027s broken?\" he asks, his arm supporting my back. \"No.\" Nothing besides my heart, but that had nothing to do with my fall. He pushes up my pants leg, and his fingers run over my knee checking the damage. He makes me bend and straighten my leg a couple of times. \"No cuts or broken bones, but you\u0027re gonna have some nasty bruises tomorrow. I take a deep breath, gulping back tears. My breath comes out in little spurts. I hate showing this much weakness, especially in front of someone who protects his own at all costs. \"Thanks for helping me, Avi.\" He rubs my chin with another pad. He cups my cheeks in his hands and swipes my tears away with his thumbs. \"I\u0027m your team leader. You\u0027re my responsibility.\" Duh! I should\u0027ve known he wasn\u0027t being this nice because he still cared about me. I hold back a response. Time stops, though, as being this close brings back a flood of emotions. Avi leans forward, and I wonder whether, if I lean in, we\u0027ll kiss. I turn away before I\u0027m tempted to try it. What if he turns away and my lips connect with his cheek? I\u0027d die from embarrassment. He packs up the unused gauze and the open packets. \"I\u0027m taking you back to the base now,\" he says, lifting me up and carrying me in his strong, protective arms. While it\u0027s so tempting to lean my head into his neck and let him take care of me, his words from this morning are still echoing in my head. \"Avi, I want to finish the run.\" I swear I can almost hear my bruised body scream \"no/\" But I want to push myself. I want to prove to myself, to Avi, and to my entire unit that I\u0027m a warrior woman. Back when we were digging ditches, Liron accused Avi of taking it easy on me. And as much as I feel happy and safe in Avi\u0027s arms, and would love to be carried down the mountain because my body is protesting every movement I make, I don\u0027t want to give up. He slowly puts me down. \"You don\u0027t have to.\" \"I know. But you told me this morning to push myself.\" He shakes his head and points to my torn pants and shirt. \"Not while you\u0027re bleeding and hurt.\" I show him my gauze-covered arms. \"Would you run even if you were bleeding?\" \"Probably.\" \"Would Liron do it?\" \"Probably. But she\u0027s been training alongside us Sayeret Tzefa trainees.\" \"Yeah, well, if she can do it, so can I.\" I strap on my canteen and slide my hot-pink headlight onto my head. I must look ridiculous with torn clothes, a scraped-up chin, and a hot-pink light that I\u0027m not allowed to turn on, but I\u0027ve got determination on my side. \"I\u0027m a kick-ass Jewish warrior woman and don\u0027t you forget it.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" he says, smiling as we start at a slow jog up the mountain to try and catch up with everyone else. \"I\u0027m looking forward to seeing how a kick-ass Jewish warrior woman does at live-fire rifle shooting tomorrow.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-17.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.
