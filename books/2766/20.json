I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s because it hurts to recall that week of training or if it\u0027s because he desperately wants his country to live in peace but doesn\u0027t see how that\u0027s possible. Either way, I\u0027m stunned by the rush of words and emotion.\n \"Afterward, I needed you, Amy,\" he continues. \"I needed you so damn bad. I wanted to hold you in my arms again, feel your warm sweet body against mine to remind me that there\u0027s something good out there, that this world isn\u0027t only full of hatred and evil. Liron felt the same way. Her boyfriend was stationed on another base and you were in the States. I remember what you said about it being okay if we saw other people. Being with Liron until I started feeling human again seemed like a great solution at the time.\" He gives a short, cynical laugh. \"But it sucked, because she wasn\u0027t you.\" His swipes his eyes with the back of his hand, getting emotional. \"She wasn\u0027t you,\" he chokes out.\n I\u0027m starting to cry now too. \"It\u0027s not fair, Avi. We found each other but live in two different countries. Just when I feel the closest to you, we\u0027re ripped apart. It\u0027s not fair.\"\n \"Amy, tell me anyone else can make your heart pound like it does when you\u0027re with me,\" he says. \"Tell me you think anything or anyone can compare with it, and I\u0027ll give up on us.\"\n Oh, God. I want us to get back together, because nobody can make me feel like he does. I want him so bad. I can\u0027t deny it any longer, to myself or him.\n \"No, Avi. Don\u0027t give up on us.\" The Israeli side of me bursts forward with a vengeance, and I think my fighting spirit has finally come out. Boot camp has changed me. I put my hand over his. \"I forgive you. I can\u0027t forget what you did with Liron just as much as you probably can\u0027t forget I kissed Nathan. But I can definitely forgive.\"\n He lifts my hand to his lips and kisses it. \"We\u0027re both at peace with everything that happened, except there\u0027s one thing I probably should tell him. Making up feels so good and carefree. But... \"Umm, Avi, I kind of lied to you back on base.\"\n \"About what?\"\n I clear my throat. As long as Avi told the truth, I might as well spill the beans. \"Nathan and I have never been a couple. I kind of coerced him into pretending we were dating.\"\n Avi winks at me. \"I knew that.\"\n Chapter 22\n Forgiveness takes a lot less energy than holding grudges.\n Three hours after leaving boot camp, we reach the hospital. Avi takes my hand after we pass through hospital security and steers me down the front corridor. The closer I get to seeing Safia, the more scared I get. What if she looks different? What if she looks weaker than she did last year? I hate cancer. It\u0027s as dangerous and deadly as a terrorist.\n Avi asks the lobby receptionist something in Hebrew. She points to the elevator bank. The inside of the Baruch Padeh Medical Center hospital in Tiberias looks just like hospitals back home, with stark white walls and the scent of purified air bursting through the air conditioning vents.\n \"You okay?\" Avi asks as we\u0027re riding up the elevator.\n \"Yeah. Why?\"\n \"Your nails are digging into my palm.\" He loosens my hand and shows me the nail indentations in his skin.\n \"Sony. Truth is, I\u0027m freaking out.\"\n He puts his arm around me, holds me tight to him, and lightly kisses the top of my head. \"I\u0027m here for you. Always. You know that, even if you don\u0027t always want to believe it.\"\n Whenever I\u0027ve needed Avi for my minor but frequent emergencies in my life, he\u0027s been there for me. Whether it was on the base or on the phone or in person, he\u0027s always around when I\u0027m desperate for someone to keep my spirits high and lift me up... even physically.\n He slows his pace when we get closer to the room. \"Remember, it\u0027s okay to cry.\" He shrugs when I glance up at him. \"My mom told me that after my brother died.\"\n \"And did you cry, Avi?\"\n He bites his bottom lip and nods. \"Yeah... I did.\" He clears his throat and lifts his head high. \"Come on,\" he says, nudging me forward into the room.\n I take a deep breath and peek my head inside. Sofia has an oxygen mask over her nose and mouth. Her eyes are closed and it looks like she\u0027s sleeping peacefully in the hospital bed, her pale complexion making her look like an angel. My dad is sitting next to the bed. He rushes from the chair and opens his arms to hug me, but when he takes a closer look his eyes go wide with shock.\n \"Amy. Mah corah*. What happened to you?\" He gestures to my arms and chin as he inspects my scratched face.\n \"Oh, that. Umm... I kinda fell on rocks. Well, I guess skidded is more like it.\"\n \"You look like you\u0027ve been in battle.\"\n \"That\u0027s kind of how I felt. But it\u0027s better today. I\u0027ve turned into a warrior woman.\" Sort of.\n Back when I begged my dad to let me go on this trip, he warned me not to complain no matter how hard boot camp turned out to be. Either I could stay at my aunt and uncle\u0027s house with him on the moshav all summer (with possibly no chance of seeing Avi), or I could go on the army portion of the Sababa trip with my friends (and possibly see Avi). But if I chose boot camp, I\u0027d better suck it up.\n I\u0027d like you to know that this is me sucking it up. Pre-army Amy would definitely be whining Aba, they make us get up before the sun is up, and run in the dark, and pee and poop in stinky holes, and sleep with our guns, and eat jam with bees in it, and do boy pushups, and march in straight lines, and scale walls, and sleep in beds with springs missing above our heads, and dig holes with big hairy spiders in them......but I don\u0027t.\n \"Is Sofia going to be okay?\" I ask, because that\u0027s the only concern that I have at this moment. I cant lose my only living grandparent. God cant let that happen.\n Although what really scares me is that God can let that happen. Rabbi Glassman says that death is a part of life. We don\u0027t have a choice to live, and we don\u0027t have a choice as to when we\u0027ll naturally die.\n \"They\u0027ll be taking her for a CAT scan in the morning. \"We\u0027ll know more after the scan and when we get the results of her blood test. When she woke up she was in pain and disoriented, so they gave her a sedative. I don\u0027t expect her to wake up until the morning, so you might as well go back to the moshav and get some rest.\" He inspects me again. \"Wait, you look different, and it\u0027s not just the scratches. Did you get a haircut on the base?\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s a long story; don\u0027t ask.\"\n \"Okay, I won\u0027t.\" He knows better than to ask for details, because he\u0027s well aware of my special ability to get into trouble wherever I go. He shakes hands with Avi. \"Thanks for bringing Amy here.\"\n \"Ayn by\u0027ah --no problem. They gave me a forty-eight-hour leave.\"\n I stand next to my safia, bow my head, and pray silently to God to take care of her--just in case He\u0027s listening and just in case He wants to answer my prayer.\n I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do if I lose her. I didn\u0027t even know I had a grandmother until a year ago, and now here she is in a hospital. I feel like she\u0027s slipping away from my life already. She never let me tell her how much she\u0027s helped me spiritually. During my Jewish conversion classes, whenever I thought about the Jewish matriarchs, I always imagined they would look and act exactly like my safia. I read that Abraham\u0027s wife Sarah gave birth at the age of ninety and died at the ripe old age of 127.1 wish my safia could be like Sarah (obviously not the giving birth at ninety part... just the living until 127 part).\n \"Amy, I\u0027m gonna step out so you and your aba can talk alone. I\u0027ll be right outside the door if you need me,\" Avi says.\n My dad stands beside me and strokes my back as we both look down at the sweetest woman I\u0027ve ever known. \"I came home from school when I was six and told her an eight-year-old named Ido had pushed me,\" he tells me. \"Can you guess what she did?\"\n \"Went to school and threatened Ido if he didn\u0027t leave you alone?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Called I do\u0027s mother and told her that her kid was a bully?\"\n \"No. She told me to handle it myself. She said I\u0027d have to deal with bullies all my life--so I might as well figure out how to deal with them at the age of six.\"\n I try to picture my grandma as a young woman, strong and full of energy.\n \"Did you know she was in a war?\" my dad asks me.\n \"What war?\" I know all Israelis have to serve in the military. The country has been through their share of wars since they were recognized by the UN in 1948, but I can\u0027t imagine my grandmother wearing an army uniform or carrying a gun.\n \"She was in the Sinai War of \u002756. You should ask her about it. They wouldn\u0027t let women on the front lines back then, so she dressed as a boy.\"\n \"Whoa. I can\u0027t believe my grandmother was in a war.\n I can\u0027t wait to tell Roxanne back at school, who brags that her great-grandmother was one of the first women pilots.\" Pilot, shmilot. My grandmother was on the front lines. I guess I\u0027m not the only kick-ass warrior woman in the family. \"So what happened with you and Ido? Did you tell him to stop pushing you?\"\n \"Oh, I told him. Right after that, he pushed me again.\"\n \"What\u0027dyoudo?\"\n \"Well, the next day I came to school with a gift for Ido.\"\n \"Like a fist-in-your-face kind of gift?\"\n \"No. Like a new basketball my aunt gave me after she visited the States.\"\n Let me get this straight. \"Ido pushed you, and you gave him a gift?\"\n \"Since my mom wouldn\u0027t intervene, and there was no way I could fight a big kid two years older than me, I figured trying to be friends with him was my best option.\"\n \"So you became friends with the bully?\"\n He nods.\n \"That\u0027s a sellout. You shouldn\u0027t have to give the bully something. That\u0027s just wrong on so many levels.\"\n \"I had to sacrifice a little in order to get what I wanted. We ended up being friends.\"\n I guess we all sacrifice at some time or another. I just hate having to do it so often.\n \"Aba, is she going to die?\"\n \"Eventually.\"\n \"You know what I mean. Is this it? Is this the start of the end?\"\n \"She had her final chemo treatment last week. They suspect her white blood cell count is low.\"\n \"But what if it\u0027s more than that?\" I cry.\n He puts his arm around me. \"Let\u0027s not worry about that until the morning, when we know more. Let Avi take you back to the moshav.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to leave Sofia,\" I say, watching the oxygen mask fog up when she exhales.\n \"I know. But you can\u0027t do anything for her tonight. You can come back as soon as you wake up in the morning. Now go.\"\n I hug him tight, wondering how I could have ever been distant from my father. I\u0027m so grateful God brought him back into my life. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without him, especially now, with my mom and Marc starting a new family.\n I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll fit in. \"Will they still have time for me and a new baby? But one look at my dad and I know he\u0027ll never be out of my life again, no matter if I try to push him away or not. (Believe me, I\u0027ve tried it. Especially when Avi was in town and my dad was grilling him, having the \"Don\u0027t Do It\" sex talk with both of us multiple times, and acting as an overprotective chaperone the entire time.)\n After taking me for a quick dinner, Avi parks the car in front of my aunt and uncle\u0027s house on the moshav. It\u0027s on top of a big mountain overlooking the Kineret lake. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-20.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: \n How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) \n Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.

But things turn out to be different from what she\u0027d hoped for. She sleeps in a bunk bed underneath coils that look ready to give way, she\u0027s being worked to the bone, and the bathrooms are hardly up to her standards.

Strong, beautiful, and able to be with Avi all the time, Liron is everything Amy wants to be.
