Your throat might swell up so bad it\u0027ll stop the oxygen.\" Nathan opens his mouth wide and breathes in and out, proving his throat is letting enough air through. \"Close your mouth, Nathan,\" Tori says. \"You look like a damn fish gasping for air, you dork.\" \"Uthually I\u0027m thexy,\" Nathan tells her, then nudges me to intervene. \"The sexiest,\" I agree, but I don\u0027t think Tori is buying it. Noah leads Nathan, who\u0027s now screaming unintelligible obscenities, all the way to the infirmary. Great. Now I\u0027ve ruined my fake boyfriend\u0027s reputation, too. Tori finishes the task of piling plastic coffee mugs on a tray. \"Hey, Tori. I thought you said these were worker bees that don\u0027t sting,\" I say to her. \"I didn\u0027t say they won\u0027t sting if you eat them,\" she responds, then walks back out into the dining area with the tray of coffee mugs. I follow her with a tray of jam-filled bowls. \"It\u0027s too bad my boyfriend won\u0027t be able to kiss me because of his bee sting.\" \"Your problem, not mine,\" she says, attitude dripping from each word. I set two bowls on each table, wondering how I\u0027m going to make her go out with Nathan after we \"break up\" and I\u0027m supposedly devastated. \"Who do you like?\" \"As if I\u0027m gonna tell you.\" Seriously, this girl is so one-dimensional you\u0027d think when she turns sideways she\u0027d be as flat as a piece of paper. She belongs on another planet. \"You know, it wouldn\u0027t hurt if you acted a little nicer.\" \"Why should I? Acting nice didn\u0027t get me anywhere. It sure didn\u0027t keep my parents together, that\u0027s for sure.\" \"Are they divorced?\" \"That\u0027s none of your business. Just leave me alone.\" I\u0027m shocked. Tori actually opened up to me. The good part is that I now know what her deal is. She\u0027s not mad at me, per se. Okay, so I\u0027m sure I annoy her 10 percent of the time. But the real issue behind her pissy face and bitchy attitude is a daughter who wants her parents to get together and doesn\u0027t see it happening any time soon. \"Not that you care, but I know how you feel,\" I tell her. \"I doubt it. Are your parents divorced?\" \"No, worse. My parents were never married. How would you like growing up knowing you were the result of a one-night stand? That\u0027s my reality. And no matter how much attitude I have, that will never change.\" \"But you have friends. I have nobody.\" \"If you\u0027d act a little nicer maybe we could be friends. If you stop calling me a spaz every two minutes, that might be a start.\" \"\"What makes you think even if I wanted a friend, I\u0027d pick you? Besides, you are a spaz.\" Tori tosses her hair with a flick of her wrist, showing me a flash of dark hair underneath her blond locks, and stomps back to the kitchen. She ignores me the rest of the time as she busies herself with one task or another. I guess now is not the time to become buddy-buddy with her, especially when she\u0027s in charge of the hot coffee. It\u0027s not a level playing field. Avi walks in the door and I almost drop a bowl of jam. I wish I could forget the long talks we\u0027d have on the phone when he was on military leave. Or that his hands are strong enough to dig ditches in record time and gentle enough to caress my skin and make me beg for more. \"Where\u0027s Noah?\" he asks in a businesslike tone, as if I\u0027m someone he just met. \"He took Nathan to the infirmary,\" I answer back, just as businesslike. \"Why?\" \"Nathan kind of ate a live bee.\" \"Kind of? How does someone kind of cat a bee?\" \"It\u0027s a long story,\" I say, not wanting to get into it. Tori appears by Avi s side. \"He licked it off her. You know, with his tongue.\" As if Avi cant get the visual, Tori sticks her tongue out and wiggles it up and down. So much for the conversation staying businesslike. I have a vindictive urge to pull her tongue until it comes out of her mouth. Avi looks as if he\u0027s about to be ill. \"I get the picture. No need to demonstrate.\" Avi and I meet up again at the tray full of bread baskets. I figure I need to explain, so I tap him on the arm. \"When his dark gaze meets mine, I step back. I can\u0027t think straight when I\u0027m looking directly into his eyes. \"Um, yeah. The way Tori told you what happened isn\u0027t really how it went down.\" \"I don\u0027t need details.\" \"But I want to explain.\" I pretend to be busy picking up baskets of bread to set on the tables as I talk, sparing myself from looking directly at him. \"So, um, there were bees stuck in the jam. And when Nathan pinched my butt by accident, I twirled around and jam landed on my sleeve. He licked it off, not knowing there was a bee stuck in it.\" \"He didn\u0027t do anything by accident, Amy. Tell Nathan to keep his hands off your tachat. And while he\u0027s at it, tell him to keep his tongue away from you, too.\" \"You jealous?\" \"Why should I be? I have Liron, right?\" \"Right. And I have Nathan, right?\" He shrugs. \"I don\u0027t know, you tell me. You\u0027ve obviously had his tongue down your throat multiple times.\" Oh, that was low. How dare he turn this around and make me the bad person, when he\u0027s probably been playing \"battling tongues\" with Liron! \"Yeah, well, he might be tongue-challenged at the moment, but normally he\u0027s the best.\" I emphasize the last two words for effect. If Avis tight, white knuckles are any indication, I think I\u0027ve accomplished my goal. \"Amy?\" He says, his voice laced with frustration. I cross my arms on my chest (actually under my chest, because my boobs are so big). \"What?\" I know we\u0027re about to have it out, right here in the middle of the IDF cafeteria. The door between the kitchen and dining area opens. It\u0027s Jess and Ethan, bringing out the baskets of bread. Both stop in their tracks, obviously sensing the massive amount of tension in the room. \"Everything okay in here?\" Jess asks. I narrow my eyes at Avi. \"It\u0027s all peachy. Avi and I were just discussing the art of a good kiss.\" \"While that might be fascinating at another time, we have baskets of bread we need to put out. Help us,\" Jess says. I see something, out of the corner of my eye, on one of the pieces of bread in the basket Jess is holding. \"There are a couple of ants crawling on the bread.\" Jess shrugs. \"Noah said to consider them spices.\" Chapter 15 Insects, whether they\u0027re bees or ants, should not be eaten alive. Breakfast is half over when Nathan reappears. \"How\u0027s your tongue?\" Miranda asks once he reaches our table. Nathan shrugs. Noah is standing behind him. \"He says it hurts to talk. The nurse told him the swelling should go down in a few hours.\" \"That\u0027s what you get for pinching my butt. God was punishing you.\" He gives me the finger as he takes a seat beside me. \"God\u0027s gonna punish you for that, too.\" Across the table, Miranda slams down her cup of milk. It splashes all over her uniform, but I don\u0027t think she notices. \"Amy, leave him alone. Don\u0027t you think he\u0027s dealing with enough without you making him feel worse?\" \"I was just kidding, Miranda.\" \"Yeah, well...\" Miranda looks around, realizing she\u0027s causing a scene. Miranda\u0027s not used to creating drama. Her voice shakes as she says, \"Maybe Nathan doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re kidding.\" \"Nathan and I joke around all the time. We always do.\" Nathan puts his arm around me, nods, and smiles. \"Oh,\" Miranda says, slowly sitting back down. She doesn\u0027t look up until we\u0027re done eating and dismissed from breakfast. On the way back to the barracks, I catch up to Miranda. \"I know why you\u0027re pissed with me. You have the hots for Nathan.\" She glances sideways at me. \"So?\" Wow, I\u0027m right. I mean, I got the idea when she went all ballistic on me, milk splattered on her face during breakfast. But I still can\u0027t believe it. \"I\u0027m not really dating him, you know.\" Miranda stops and turns to me. \"Then who are you dating, Amy? Because you seem to be dating guys you hate, and hating guys you date, and hating girls who like the guys you date, or hate, and--\" My brain is on overload. \"You lost me. I\u0027m confused.\" \"That makes two of us.\" She stomps away from me. I hurry to catch up. \"What do you want me to do? I hate you being mad at me.\" \"I don\u0027t know. I have no claim to Nathan. He doesn\u0027t even like me.\" \"Are you double-jointed?\" \"What?\" \"Are you double-jointed?\" \"No. In case you haven\u0027t noticed, I\u0027m fat and had to step on people\u0027s backs in order to complete the monkey bars at the obstacle course.\" \"So did I. And you\u0027re not fat, Miranda.\" She picks up her shirt and grabs her bulging stomach. \"What do you call this?\" To be honest, I\u0027ve seen people way bigger. Umm... Umm... \"I call it extra.\u0027\" \"Extra what?\" Oh, I hate being put in a corner I can\u0027t get out of gracefully. \"Just extra\u0027.\" She pulls her shirt down. \"Well, I call it fat. Nathan isn\u0027t going to like me. Did you see his last girlfriend, Bicky? She was rail thin.\" \"Miranda, she was a druggie. That kind of thin is not attractive.\" \"Neither is this extra thirty pounds I carry around. And no matter how much I try to get rid of it, I cant. Because I crave sweets, and once I start eating I can\u0027t stop. Do you know what it\u0027s like not to be able to stop doing something you know isn\u0027t good for you?\" \"Sure I do.\" She puts her hand on her hip, totally unconvinced. \"Well, I know I do and say things that hurt other people,\" I tell her. \"I can\u0027t stop it sometimes. It\u0027s a protective thing. You know, so I hurt people before they have a chance to hurt me. Don\u0027t let anyone else know, but I\u0027ve got issues.\" \"Everybody has issues, Amy.\" She sighs. I guess she\u0027s right. Tori has issues from her parents\u0027 divorce, Miranda has weight/image issues, I have emotional protection/ego issues, Jess has hypochondriac issues... Is anyone human actually normal? I\u0027m beginning to think being normal is actually abnormal. Chapter 16 Zits are God\u0027s way of making sure we know we\u0027re only human and far from perfect. I\u0027d just like him to remind me a little less often. Looking at my face in the bathroom mirror the next morning, I\u0027m horrified. I stare at the small zit I noticed last night after I took a shower. The small red bump appeared above my left eyebrow. It\u0027s not small anymore. Jessica is brushing her teeth at the sink next to me. \"Don\u0027t touch it,\" she says as she wipes her mouth with a towel and places her toothbrush in a plastic tube she brought from home. \"If you do, it\u0027ll just get worse and take longer to go away. Use cover-up and forget about it. Give it two or three days, and it\u0027ll be gone.\" She walks out of the bathroom and I take another look in the mirror. Two or three days? Ugh. I tentatively touch it. It hurts. And it\u0027s so big it deserves its own name. George the Zit. George is being stubborn. \"Well, I\u0027m stubborn too. I don\u0027t listen to Jess and I try and get rid of George myself by squeezing him away. But now George looks worse and has started to throb. It looks like a bright red radish has imbedded itself on my forehead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-15.html","bookId":2766,"book":{"id":2766,"title":"How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3)","description":"Storyline: How to Ruin Your Boyfriend\u0027s Reputation (How to Ruin #3) Amy Nelson-Barak, 17, is back in this third installment about a Jewish-American teen learning how to live and love in peace.

Strong, beautiful, and able to be with Avi all the time, Liron is everything Amy wants to be. Even though the plot is predictable, readers can\u0027t help but get drawn in by Amy\u0027s fun way of telling her story, and they learn a lot about Israeli teens\u0027 mandatory military service.
