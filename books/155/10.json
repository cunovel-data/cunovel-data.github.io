And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to me, O Daniel, you man dearly loved, take in the sense of the words I say to you and get up on to your feet: for to you I am now sent; and when he had said this to me I got on to my feet, shaking with fear. \\n\\n 10:12 [hgb] 他 就 说 ， 但 以 理 阿 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 因 为 从 你 第 一 日 专 心 求 明 白 将 来 的 事 ， 又 在 你 神 面 前 刻 苦 己 心 ， 你 的 言 语 已 蒙 应 允 。 我 是 因 你 的 言 语 而 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to me, Have no fear, Daniel; for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your God, your words have come to his ears: and I have come because of your words. \\n\\n 10:13 [hgb] 但 波 斯 国 的 魔 君 拦 阻 我 二 十 一 日 。 忽 然 有 大 君 （ 就 是 天 使 长 。 二 十 一 节 同 ） 中 的 一 位 米 迦 勒 来 帮 助 我 ， 我 就 停 留 在 波 斯 诸 王 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. \\n\\n [bbe] But the angel of the kingdom of Persia put himself against me for twenty-one days; but Michael, one of the chief angels, came to my help; and when I came he was still there with the angel of the kings of Persia. \\n\\n 10:14 [hgb] 现 在 我 来 ， 要 使 你 明 白 本 国 之 民 日 后 必 遭 遇 的 事 ， 因 为 这 异 象 关 乎 后 来 许 多 的 日 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. \\n\\n [bbe] Now I have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days; for there is still a vision for the days. \\n\\n 10:15 [hgb] 他 向 我 这 样 说 ， 我 就 脸 面 朝 地 ， 哑 口 无 声 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb. \\n\\n [bbe] And after he had said these words to me, I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything. \\n\\n 10:16 [hgb] 不 料 ， 有 一 位 像 人 的 ， 摸 我 的 嘴 唇 ， 我 便 开 口 向 那 站 在 我 面 前 的 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 因 见 这 异 象 ， 我 大 大 愁 苦 ， 毫 无 气 力 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. \\n\\n [bbe] Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips; and opening my mouth, I said to him who was before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have come on me, and I have no more strength. \\n\\n 10:17 [hgb] 我 主 的 仆 人 怎 能 与 我 主 说 话 呢 ？ 我 一 见 异 象 就 浑 身 无 力 ， 毫 无 气 息 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. \\n\\n [bbe] For how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord? for, as for me, straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body. \\n\\n 10:18 [hgb] 有 一 位 形 状 像 人 的 又 摸 我 ， 使 我 有 力 量 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, \\n\\n [bbe] Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength. \\n\\n 10:19 [hgb] 他 说 ， 大 蒙 眷 爱 的 人 哪 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 愿 你 平 安 。 你 总 要 坚 强 。 他 一 向 我 说 话 ， 我 便 觉 得 有 力 量 ， 说 ， 我 主 请 说 ， 因 你 使 我 有 力 量 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to me, O man greatly loved, have no fear: peace be with you, be strong and let your heart be lifted up. And at his words I became strong, and said, Let my lord say on, for you have given me strength. \\n\\n 10:20 [hgb] 他 就 说 ， 你 知 道 我 为 何 来 见 你 吗 ？ 现 在 我 要 回 去 与 波 斯 的 魔 君 争 战 ， 我 去 后 ， 希 腊 （ 原 文 作 雅 完 ） 的 魔 君 必 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings: \\n\\n 10:21 [hgb] 但 我 要 将 那 录 在 真 确 书 上 的 事 告 诉 你 。 除 了 你 们 的 大 君 米 迦 勒 之 外 ， 没 有 帮 助 我 抵 挡 这 两 魔 君 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. \\n\\n [bbe] But I am going back to make war with the angel of Persia, and when I am gone, the angel of Greece will come. And there is no one on my side against these, but Michael, your angel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136/2026.html","bookId":155,"book":{"id":155,"title":"但以理书 Daniel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 在 位 第 三 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 城 围 困 。 [kjv] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jer...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
