then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. \n [bbe] And the captain of the unsexed servants said to Daniel, I am in fear of my lord the king, who has given orders about your food and your drink; what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation? then you would have put my head in danger from the king. \n 1:11 [hgb] 但 以 理 对 太 监 长 所 派 管 理 但 以 理 ， 哈 拿 尼 雅 ， 米 沙 利 ， 亚 撒 利 雅 的 委 办 说 ， \n [kjv] Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, \n [bbe] Then Daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: \n 1:12 [hgb] 求 你 试 试 仆 人 们 十 天 ， 给 我 们 素 菜 吃 ， 白 水 喝 ， \n [kjv] Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. \n [bbe] Put your servants to the test for ten days; let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink. \n 1:13 [hgb] 然 后 看 看 我 们 的 面 貌 和 用 王 膳 那 少 年 人 的 面 貌 ， 就 照 你 所 看 的 待 仆 人 吧 。 \n [kjv] Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king\u0027s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. \n [bbe] Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the king\u0027s table; and, having seen them, do to your servants as it seems right to you. \n 1:14 [hgb] 委 办 便 允 准 他 们 这 件 事 ， 试 看 他 们 十 天 。 \n [kjv] So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. \n [bbe] So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days. \n 1:15 [hgb] 过 了 十 天 ， 见 他 们 的 面 貌 比 用 王 膳 的 一 切 少 年 人 更 加 俊 美 肥 胖 。 \n [kjv] And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king\u0027s meat. \n [bbe] And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the king\u0027s table. \n 1:16 [hgb] 于 是 委 办 撤 去 派 他 们 用 的 膳 ， 饮 的 酒 ， 给 他 们 素 菜 吃 。 \n [kjv] Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. \n [bbe] So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink, and gave them grain. \n 1:17 [hgb] 这 四 个 少 年 人 ， 神 在 各 样 文 字 学 问 上 （ 学 问 原 文 作 智 慧 ） ， 赐 给 他 们 聪 明 知 识 。 但 以 理 又 明 白 各 样 的 异 象 和 梦 兆 。 \n [kjv] As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. \n [bbe] Now as for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book-learning and wisdom: and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams. \n 1:18 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 王 预 定 带 进 少 年 人 来 的 日 期 满 了 ， 太 监 长 就 把 他 们 带 到 王 面 前 。 \n [kjv] Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. \n [bbe] Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in, the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar. \n 1:19 [hgb] 王 与 他 们 谈 论 ， 见 少 年 人 中 无 一 人 能 比 但 以 理 ， 哈 拿 尼 雅 ， 米 沙 利 ， 亚 撒 利 雅 ， 所 以 留 他 们 在 王 面 前 侍 立 。 \n [kjv] And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. \n [bbe] And the king had talk with them; and among them all there was no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were given places before the king. \n 1:20 [hgb] 王 考 问 他 们 一 切 事 ， 就 见 他 们 的 智 慧 聪 明 比 通 国 的 术 士 和 用 法 术 的 胜 过 十 倍 。 \n [kjv] And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. \n [bbe] And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom. \n 1:21 [hgb] 到 古 列 王 元 年 ， 但 以 理 还 在 。 \n [kjv] And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. \n [bbe] And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136/2017.html","bookId":155,"book":{"id":155,"title":"但以理书 Daniel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 在 位 第 三 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 城 围 困 。 [kjv] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jer...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
