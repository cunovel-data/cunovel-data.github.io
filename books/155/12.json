[bbe] And at that time Michael will take up his place, the great angel, who is the supporter of the children of your people: and there will be a time of trouble, such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that same time: and at that time your people will be kept safe, everyone who is recorded in the book. 12:2 [hgb] 睡 在 尘 埃 中 的 ， 必 有 多 人 复 醒 。 其 中 有 得 永 生 的 ， 有 受 羞 辱 永 远 被 憎 恶 的 。 [kjv] And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. [bbe] And a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep, some to eternal life and some to eternal shame. 12:3 [hgb] 智 慧 人 必 发 光 如 同 天 上 的 光 。 那 使 多 人 归 义 的 ， 必 发 光 如 星 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 [kjv] And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. [bbe] And those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky; and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever. 12:4 [hgb] 但 以 理 阿 ， 你 要 隐 藏 这 话 ， 封 闭 这 书 ， 直 到 末 时 。 必 有 多 人 来 往 奔 跑 （ 或 作 切 心 研 究 ） ， 知 识 就 必 增 长 。 [kjv] But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. [bbe] But as for you, O Daniel, let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end: numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased. 12:5 [hgb] 我 但 以 理 观 看 ， 见 另 有 两 个 人 站 立 ， 一 个 在 河 这 边 ， 一 个 在 河 那 边 。 [kjv] Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. [bbe] Then I, Daniel, looking, saw two others, one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side. 12:6 [hgb] 有 一 个 问 那 站 在 河 水 以 上 ， 穿 细 麻 衣 的 说 ， 这 奇 异 的 事 到 几 时 才 应 验 呢 ？ [kjv] And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? [bbe] And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was over the waters of the river, How long will it be to the end of these wonders? 12:7 [hgb] 我 听 见 那 站 在 河 水 以 上 ， 穿 细 麻 衣 的 ， 向 天 举 起 左 右 手 ， 指 着 活 到 永 远 的 主 起 誓 说 ， 要 到 一 载 ， 二 载 ， 半 载 ， 打 破 圣 民 权 力 的 时 候 ， 这 一 切 事 就 都 应 验 了 。 [kjv] And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. [bbe] Then in my hearing the man clothed in linen, who was over the river, lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time, times, and a half; and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end, all these things will be ended. 12:8 [hgb] 我 听 见 这 话 ， 却 不 明 白 ， 就 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 这 些 事 的 结 局 是 怎 样 呢 ？ [kjv] And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? [bbe] And the words came to my ears, but the sense of them was not clear to me: then I said, O my lord, what is the sense of these things? 12:9 [hgb] 他 说 ， 但 以 理 阿 ， 你 只 管 去 。 因 为 这 话 已 经 隐 藏 封 闭 ， 直 到 末 时 。 [kjv] And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. [bbe] And he said, Go on your way, Daniel: for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end; 12:10 [hgb] 必 有 许 多 人 使 自 己 清 净 洁 白 ， 且 被 熬 炼 。 但 恶 人 仍 必 行 恶 ， 一 切 恶 人 都 不 明 白 ， 惟 独 智 慧 人 能 明 白 。 [kjv] Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. [bbe] Till a number are tested and make themselves clean; and the evil-doers will do evil; for not one of the evil-doers will have knowledge; but all will be made clear to those who are wise. 12:11 [hgb] 从 除 掉 常 献 的 燔 祭 ， 并 设 立 那 行 毁 坏 可 憎 之 物 的 时 候 ， 必 有 一 千 二 百 九 十 日 。 [kjv] And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. [bbe] And from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away, and an unclean thing causing fear is put up, there will be a thousand, two hundred and ninety days. 12:12 [hgb] 等 到 一 千 三 百 三 十 五 日 的 ， 那 人 便 为 有 福 。 [kjv] Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. [bbe] A blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting, and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty-five days. 12:13 [hgb] 你 且 去 等 候 结 局 ， 因 为 你 必 安 歇 。 到 了 末 期 ， 你 必 起 来 ， 享 受 你 的 福 分 。 [kjv] But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. [bbe] But you, go on your way and take your rest: for you will be in your place at the end of the days.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136/2028.html","bookId":155,"book":{"id":155,"title":"但以理书 Daniel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 在 位 第 三 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 城 围 困 。 [kjv] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jer...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
