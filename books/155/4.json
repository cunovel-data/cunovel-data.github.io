Peace be multiplied unto you. \n [bbe] Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages living in all the earth: May your peace be increased. \n 4:2 [hgb] 我 乐 意 将 至 高 的 神 向 我 所 行 的 神 迹 奇 事 宣 扬 出 来 。 \n [kjv] I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. \n [bbe] It has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done with me. \n 4:3 [hgb] 他 的 神 迹 何 其 大 。 他 的 奇 事 何 其 盛 。 他 的 国 是 永 远 的 。 他 的 权 柄 存 到 万 代 。 \n [kjv] How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. \n [bbe] How great are his signs! and how full of power are his wonders! his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and his rule goes on from generation to generation. \n 4:4 [hgb] 我 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 安 居 在 宫 中 ， 平 顺 在 殿 内 。 \n [kjv] I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: \n [bbe] I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my place, and all things were going well for me in my great house: \n 4:5 [hgb] 我 作 了 一 梦 ， 使 我 惧 怕 。 我 在 床 上 的 思 念 ， 并 脑 中 的 异 象 ， 使 我 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. \n [bbe] I saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me; I was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed, and by the visions of my head. \n 4:6 [hgb] 所 以 我 降 旨 召 巴 比 伦 的 一 切 哲 士 到 我 面 前 ， 叫 他 们 把 梦 的 讲 解 告 诉 我 。 \n [kjv] Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. \n [bbe] And I gave orders for all the wise men of Babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream. \n 4:7 [hgb] 于 是 那 些 术 士 ， 用 法 术 的 ， 迦 勒 底 人 ， 观 兆 的 都 进 来 ， 我 将 那 梦 告 诉 了 他 们 ， 他 们 却 不 能 把 梦 的 讲 解 告 诉 我 。 \n [kjv] Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. \n [bbe] Then the wonder-workers, the users of secret arts, the Chaldaeans, and the readers of signs came in to me: and I put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me. \n 4:8 [hgb] 末 后 那 照 我 神 的 名 ， 称 为 伯 提 沙 撒 的 但 以 理 来 到 我 面 前 ， 他 里 头 有 圣 神 的 灵 ， 我 将 梦 告 诉 他 说 ， \n [kjv] But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, \n [bbe] But at last Daniel came in before me, he whose name was Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I put the dream before him, saying, \n 4:9 [hgb] 术 士 的 领 袖 伯 提 沙 撒 阿 ， 因 我 知 道 你 里 头 有 圣 神 的 灵 ， 什 么 奥 秘 的 事 都 不 能 使 你 为 难 。 现 在 要 把 我 梦 中 所 见 的 异 象 和 梦 的 讲 解 告 诉 我 。 \n [kjv] O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. \n [bbe] O Belteshazzar, master of the wonder-workers, because I am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and you are troubled by no secret; this is the dream which I saw: make clear to me its sense. \n 4:10 [hgb] 我 在 床 上 脑 中 的 异 象 是 这 样 ， 我 看 见 地 当 中 有 一 棵 树 ， 极 其 高 大 。 \n [kjv] Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. \n [bbe] On my bed I saw a vision: there was a tree in the middle of the earth, and it was very high. \n 4:11 [hgb] 那 树 渐 长 ， 而 且 坚 固 ， 高 得 顶 天 ， 从 地 极 都 能 看 见 ， \n [kjv] The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: \n [bbe] And the tree became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven, and to be seen from the ends of the earth: \n 4:12 [hgb] 叶 子 华 美 ， 果 子 甚 多 ， 可 作 众 生 的 食 物 。 田 野 的 走 兽 卧 在 荫 下 ， 天 空 的 飞 鸟 宿 在 枝 上 。 凡 有 血 气 的 都 从 这 树 得 食 。 \n [kjv] The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. \n [bbe] Its leaves were fair and it had much fruit, and in it was food enough for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches, and it gave food to all living things. \n 4:13 [hgb] 我 在 床 上 脑 中 的 异 象 ， 见 有 一 位 守 望 的 圣 者 从 天 而 降 。 \n [kjv] I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; \n [bbe] In the visions of my head on my bed I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, \n 4:14 [hgb] 大 声 呼 叫 说 ， 伐 倒 这 树 。 砍 下 枝 子 。 摇 掉 叶 子 。 抛 散 果 子 。 使 走 兽 离 开 树 下 ， 飞 鸟 躲 开 树 枝 。 \n [kjv] He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: \n [bbe] Crying out with a loud voice; and this is what he said: Let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off; let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction: let the beasts get away from under it and the birds from its branches: \n 4:15 [hgb] 树 墩 却 要 留 在 地 内 ， 用 铁 圈 和 铜 圈 箍 住 ， 在 田 野 的 青 草 中 让 天 露 滴 湿 ， 使 他 与 地 上 的 兽 一 同 吃 草 ， \n [kjv] Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: \n [bbe] But keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass; let him have the young grass of the field for food, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his part be with the beasts. \n 4:16 [hgb] 使 他 的 心 改 变 ， 不 如 人 心 。 给 他 一 个 兽 心 ， 使 他 经 过 七 期 （ 期 或 作 年 。 本 章 同 ） 。 \n [kjv] Let his heart be changed from man\u0027s, and let a beast\u0027s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. \n [bbe] Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and the heart of a beast be given to him; and let seven times go by him. \n 4:17 [hgb] 这 是 守 望 者 所 发 的 命 ， 圣 者 所 出 的 令 ， 好 叫 世 人 知 道 至 高 者 在 人 的 国 中 掌 权 ， 要 将 国 赐 与 谁 就 赐 与 谁 ， 或 立 极 卑 微 的 人 执 掌 国 权 。 \n [kjv] This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. \n [bbe] This order is fixed by the watchers, and the decision is by the word of the holy ones: so that the living may be certain that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure, lifting up over it the lowest of men. \n 4:18 [hgb] 这 是 我 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 王 所 作 的 梦 。 伯 提 沙 撒 阿 ， 你 要 说 明 这 梦 的 讲 解 。 因 为 我 国 中 的 一 切 哲 士 都 不 能 将 梦 的 讲 解 告 诉 我 ， 惟 独 你 能 ， 因 你 里 头 有 圣 神 的 灵 。 \n [kjv] This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. \n [bbe] This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw; and do you, O Belteshazzar, make clear the sense of it, for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you. \n 4:19 [hgb] 于 是 称 为 伯 提 沙 撒 的 但 以 理 惊 讶 片 时 ， 心 意 惊 惶 。 王 说 ， 伯 提 沙 撒 阿 ， 不 要 因 梦 和 梦 的 讲 解 惊 惶 。 伯 提 沙 撒 回 答 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 愿 这 梦 归 与 恨 恶 你 的 人 ， 讲 解 归 与 你 的 敌 人 。 \n [kjv] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. \n [bbe] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was at a loss for a time, his thoughts troubling him. The king made answer and said, Belteshazzar, do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it. Belteshazzar, answering, said, My lord, may the dream be about your haters, and its sense about those who are against you. \n 4:20 [hgb] 你 所 见 的 树 渐 长 ， 而 且 坚 固 ， 高 得 顶 天 ， 从 地 极 都 能 看 见 。 \n [kjv] The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; \n [bbe] The tree which you saw, which became tall and strong, stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth; \n 4:21 [hgb] 叶 子 华 美 ， 果 子 甚 多 ， 可 作 众 生 的 食 物 。 田 野 的 走 兽 住 在 其 下 。 天 空 的 飞 鸟 宿 在 枝 上 。 \n [kjv] Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: \n [bbe] Which had fair leaves and much fruit, and had in it food for all; under which the beasts of the field were living, and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their resting-places: \n 4:22 [hgb] 王 阿 ， 这 渐 长 又 坚 固 的 树 就 是 你 。 你 的 威 势 渐 长 及 天 ， 你 的 权 柄 管 到 地 极 。 \n [kjv] It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. \n [bbe] It is you, O King, who have become great and strong: for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven, and your rule to the end of the earth. \n 4:23 [hgb] 王 既 看 见 一 位 守 望 的 圣 者 从 天 而 降 ， 说 ， 将 这 树 砍 伐 毁 坏 ， 树 墩 却 要 留 在 地 内 ， 用 铁 圈 和 铜 圈 箍 住 。 在 田 野 的 青 草 中 ， 让 天 露 滴 湿 ， 使 他 与 地 上 的 兽 一 同 吃 草 ， 直 到 经 过 七 期 。 \n [kjv] And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; \n [bbe] And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, saying, Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction; \n 4:24 [hgb] 王 阿 ， 讲 解 就 是 这 样 ， 临 到 我 主 我 王 的 事 是 出 于 至 高 者 的 命 。 \n [kjv] This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king: \n [bbe] This is the sense of it, O King, and it is the decision of the Most High which has come on my lord the king: \n 4:25 [hgb] 你 必 被 赶 出 离 开 世 人 ， 与 野 地 的 兽 同 居 ， 吃 草 如 牛 ， 被 天 露 滴 湿 ， 且 要 经 过 七 期 。 等 你 知 道 至 高 者 在 人 的 国 中 掌 权 ， 要 将 国 赐 与 谁 就 赐 与 谁 。 \n [kjv] That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. \n [bbe] That they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure. \n 4:26 [hgb] 守 望 者 既 吩 咐 存 留 树 墩 ， 等 你 知 道 诸 天 掌 权 ， 以 后 你 的 国 必 定 归 你 。 \n [kjv] And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. \n [bbe] And as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be, so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling. \n 4:27 [hgb] 王 阿 ， 求 你 悦 纳 我 的 谏 言 ， 以 施 行 公 义 断 绝 罪 过 ， 以 怜 悯 穷 人 除 掉 罪 孽 ， 或 者 你 的 平 安 可 以 延 长 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity. \n [bbe] For this cause, O King, let my suggestion be pleasing to you, and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evil-doing by mercy to the poor, so that the time of your well-being may be longer. \n 4:28 [hgb] 这 事 都 临 到 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 王 。 \n [kjv] All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. \n [bbe] All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar. \n 4:29 [hgb] 过 了 十 二 个 月 ， 他 游 行 在 巴 比 伦 王 宫 里 （ 原 文 作 上 ） 。 \n [kjv] At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. \n [bbe] At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon. \n 4:30 [hgb] 他 说 ， 这 大 巴 比 伦 不 是 我 用 大 能 大 力 建 为 京 都 ， 要 显 我 威 严 的 荣 耀 吗 ？ \n [kjv] The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? \n [bbe] The king made answer and said, Is this not great Babylon, which I have made for the living-place of kings, by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour? \n 4:31 [hgb] 这 话 在 王 口 中 尚 未 说 完 ， 有 声 音 从 天 降 下 ， 说 ， 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 王 阿 ， 有 话 对 你 说 ， 你 的 国 位 离 开 你 了 。 \n [kjv] While the word was in the king\u0027s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. \n [bbe] While the word was still in the king\u0027s mouth, a voice came down from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is said: The kingdom has gone from you: \n 4:32 [hgb] 你 必 被 赶 出 离 开 世 人 ， 与 野 地 的 兽 同 居 ， 吃 草 如 牛 ， 且 要 经 过 七 期 。 等 你 知 道 至 高 者 在 人 的 国 中 掌 权 ， 要 将 国 赐 与 谁 就 赐 与 谁 。 \n [kjv] And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. \n [bbe] And they will send you out from among men, to be with the beasts of the field; they will give you grass for your food like the oxen, and seven times will go by you, till you are certain that the Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure. \n 4:33 [hgb] 当 时 这 话 就 应 验 在 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 的 身 上 ， 他 被 赶 出 离 开 世 人 ， 吃 草 如 牛 ， 身 被 天 露 滴 湿 ， 头 发 长 长 ， 好 像 鹰 毛 。 指 甲 长 长 ， 如 同 鸟 爪 。 \n [kjv] The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles\u0027 feathers, and his nails like birds\u0027 claws. \n [bbe] That very hour the order about Nebuchadnezzar was put into effect: and he was sent out from among men, and had grass for his food like the oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair became long as eagles\u0027 feathers and his nails like those of birds. \n 4:34 [hgb] 日 子 满 足 ， 我 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 举 目 望 天 ， 我 的 聪 明 复 归 于 我 ， 我 便 称 颂 至 高 者 ， 赞 美 尊 敬 活 到 永 远 的 神 。 他 的 权 柄 是 永 有 的 。 他 的 国 存 到 万 代 。 \n [kjv] And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: \n [bbe] And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifting up my eyes to heaven, got back my reason, and, blessing the Most High, I gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever, whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation. \n 4:35 [hgb] 世 上 所 有 的 居 民 都 算 为 虚 无 。 在 天 上 的 万 军 和 世 上 的 居 民 中 ， 他 都 凭 自 己 的 意 旨 行 事 。 无 人 能 拦 住 他 手 ， 或 问 他 说 ， 你 做 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? \n [bbe] And all the people of the earth are as nothing: he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth: and no one is able to keep back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing? \n 4:36 [hgb] 那 时 ， 我 的 聪 明 复 归 于 我 ， 为 我 国 的 荣 耀 ， 威 严 ， 和 光 耀 也 都 复 归 于 我 。 并 且 我 的 谋 士 和 大 臣 也 来 朝 见 我 。 我 又 得 坚 立 在 国 位 上 ， 至 大 的 权 柄 加 增 于 我 。 \n [kjv] At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. \n [bbe] At the same time my reason came back to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and my great name came back to me; and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again; and I was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before. \n 4:37 [hgb] 现 在 我 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 赞 美 ， 尊 崇 ， 恭 敬 天 上 的 王 。 因 为 他 所 作 的 全 都 诚 实 ， 他 所 行 的 也 都 公 平 。 那 行 动 骄 傲 的 ， 他 能 降 为 卑 。 \n [kjv] Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. \n [bbe] Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give worship and praise and honour to the King of heaven; for all his works are true and his ways are right: and those who go in pride he is able to make low. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136/2020.html","bookId":155,"book":{"id":155,"title":"但以理书 Daniel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 在 位 第 三 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 城 围 困 。 [kjv] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jer...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
