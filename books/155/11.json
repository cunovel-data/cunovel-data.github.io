{"id":4447,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 又 说 ， 当 玛 代 王 大 利 乌 元 年 ， 我 曾 起 来 扶 助 米 迦 勒 ， 使 他 坚 强 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him. \\n\\n [bbe] And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede I was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong. \\n\\n 11:2 [hgb] 现 在 我 将 真 事 指 示 你 ， 波 斯 还 有 三 王 兴 起 ， 第 四 王 必 富 足 远 胜 诸 王 。 他 因 富 足 成 为 强 盛 ， 就 必 激 动 大 众 攻 击 希 腊 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. \\n\\n [bbe] And now I will make clear to you what is true. There are still three kings to come in Persia, and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them: and when he has become strong through his wealth, he will put his forces in motion against all the kingdoms of Greece. \\n\\n 11:3 [hgb] 必 有 一 个 勇 敢 的 王 兴 起 ， 执 掌 大 权 ， 随 意 而 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. \\n\\n [bbe] And a strong king will come to power, ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure. \\n\\n 11:4 [hgb] 他 兴 起 的 时 候 ， 他 的 国 必 破 裂 ， 向 天 的 四 方 （ 方 原 文 作 风 ） 分 开 ， 却 不 归 他 的 后 裔 ， 治 国 的 权 势 也 都 不 及 他 。 因 为 他 的 国 必 被 拔 出 ， 归 与 他 后 裔 之 外 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he has become strong, his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven; but not to his offspring, for it will be uprooted; and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these: but not with the same authority as his. \\n\\n 11:5 [hgb] 南 方 的 王 必 强 盛 ， 他 将 帅 中 必 有 一 个 比 他 更 强 盛 ， 执 掌 权 柄 ， 他 的 权 柄 甚 大 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of the south will be strong, but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler; and his rule will be a great rule. \\n\\n 11:6 [hgb] 过 些 年 后 ， 他 们 必 互 相 连 合 ， 南 方 王 的 女 儿 必 就 了 北 方 王 来 立 约 。 但 这 女 子 帮 助 之 力 存 立 不 住 ， 王 和 他 所 倚 靠 之 力 也 不 能 存 立 。 这 女 子 和 引 导 她 来 的 ， 并 生 她 的 ， 以 及 当 时 扶 助 她 的 ， 都 必 交 与 死 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king\u0027s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times. \\n\\n [bbe] And at the end of years they will be joined together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she will not keep the strength of her arm; and his offspring will not keep their place; but she will be uprooted, with those who were the cause of her coming, and her son, and he who took her in those times. \\n\\n 11:7 [hgb] 但 这 女 子 的 本 家 （ 本 家 原 文 作 根 ） 必 另 生 一 子 （ 子 原 文 作 枝 ） 继 续 王 位 ， 他 必 率 领 军 队 进 入 北 方 王 的 保 障 ， 攻 击 他 们 ， 而 且 得 胜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail: \\n\\n [bbe] But out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place, who will come against the army, forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north, and he will take them in hand and overcome them: \\n\\n 11:8 [hgb] 并 将 他 们 的 神 像 和 铸 成 的 偶 像 ， 与 金 银 的 宝 器 掠 到 埃 及 去 。 数 年 之 内 ， 他 不 去 攻 击 北 方 的 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north. \\n\\n [bbe] And their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south; and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north. \\n\\n 11:9 [hgb] 北 方 的 王 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 必 入 南 方 王 的 国 ， 却 要 仍 回 本 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will go back to his land. \\n\\n 11:10 [hgb] 北 方 王 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 的 二 子 必 动 干 戈 ， 招 聚 许 多 军 兵 。 这 军 兵 前 去 ， 如 洪 水 泛 滥 ， 又 必 再 去 争 战 ， 直 到 南 方 王 的 保 障 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress. \\n\\n [bbe] And his son will make war, and will get together an army of great forces, and he will make an attack on him, overflowing and going past: and he will again take the war even to his strong place. \\n\\n 11:11 [hgb] 南 方 王 必 发 烈 怒 ， 出 来 与 北 方 王 争 战 ， 摆 列 大 军 。 北 方 王 的 军 兵 必 交 付 他 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king of the south will be moved with wrath, and will come out and make war on him, on this same king of the north: and he will get together a great army, but the army will be given into his hand. \\n\\n 11:12 [hgb] 他 的 众 军 高 傲 ， 他 的 心 也 必 自 高 。 他 虽 使 数 万 人 仆 倒 ， 却 不 得 常 胜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the army will be taken away, and his heart will be uplifted: he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands, but he will not be strong. \\n\\n 11:13 [hgb] 北 方 王 必 回 来 摆 列 大 军 ， 比 先 前 的 更 多 。 满 了 所 定 的 年 数 ， 他 必 率 领 大 军 ， 带 极 多 的 军 装 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. \\n\\n [bbe] And again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first; and he will make an attack on him at the end of years, with a great army and much wealth. \\n\\n 11:14 [hgb] 那 时 ， 必 有 许 多 人 起 来 攻 击 南 方 王 ， 并 且 你 本 国 的 强 暴 人 必 兴 起 ， 要 应 验 那 异 象 ， 他 们 却 要 败 亡 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall. \\n\\n [bbe] In those times, a number will take up arms against the king of the south: and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true; but it will be their downfall. \\n\\n 11:15 [hgb] 北 方 王 必 来 筑 垒 攻 取 坚 固 城 。 南 方 的 军 兵 必 站 立 不 住 ， 就 是 选 择 的 精 兵 （ 精 兵 原 文 作 民 ） 也 无 力 站 住 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand. \\n\\n [bbe] So the king of the north will come, and put up earthworks and take a well-armed town: and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position, even the best of his army, but they will not have strength to do so. \\n\\n 11:16 [hgb] 来 攻 击 他 的 ， 必 任 意 而 行 ， 无 人 在 北 方 王 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 面 前 站 立 得 住 。 他 必 站 在 那 荣 美 之 地 ， 用 手 施 行 毁 灭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed. \\n\\n [bbe] And he who comes against him will do his pleasure, and no one will be able to keep his place before him: he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction. \\n\\n 11:17 [hgb] 他 必 定 意 用 全 国 之 力 而 来 ， 立 公 正 的 约 ， 照 约 而 行 ， 将 自 己 的 女 儿 给 南 方 王 为 妻 ， 想 要 败 坏 他 （ 或 作 埃 及 ） ， 这 计 却 不 得 成 就 ， 与 自 己 毫 无 益 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him. \\n\\n [bbe] And it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom, but in place of this he will make an agreement with him; and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it; but this will not take place or come about. \\n\\n 11:18 [hgb] 其 后 他 必 转 回 夺 取 了 许 多 海 岛 。 但 有 一 大 帅 ， 除 掉 他 令 人 受 的 羞 辱 ， 并 且 使 这 羞 辱 归 他 本 身 。 \\n\\n [kjv] After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him. \\n\\n [bbe] After this, his face will be turned to the islands, and he will take a number of them: but a chief, by his destruction, will put an end to the shame offered by him; and more than this, he will make his shame come back on him. \\n\\n 11:19 [hgb] 他 就 必 转 向 本 地 的 保 障 ， 却 要 绊 跌 仆 倒 ， 归 于 无 有 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found. \\n\\n [bbe] Then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land: but his way will be stopped, causing his downfall, and he will not be seen again. \\n\\n 11:20 [hgb] 那 时 ， 必 有 一 人 兴 起 接 续 他 为 王 ， 使 横 征 暴 敛 的 人 通 行 国 中 的 荣 美 地 。 这 王 不 多 日 就 必 灭 亡 ， 却 不 因 忿 怒 ， 也 不 因 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle. \\n\\n [bbe] Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together; but after a short time destruction will overtake him, but not in wrath or in the fight. \\n\\n 11:21 [hgb] 必 有 一 个 卑 鄙 的 人 兴 起 接 续 为 王 ， 人 未 曾 将 国 的 尊 荣 给 他 ， 他 却 趁 人 坦 然 无 备 的 时 候 ， 用 谄 媚 的 话 得 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. \\n\\n [bbe] And his place will be taken by a low person, to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given: but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words. \\n\\n 11:22 [hgb] 必 有 无 数 的 军 兵 势 如 洪 水 ， 在 他 面 前 冲 没 败 坏 。 同 盟 的 君 也 必 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. \\n\\n [bbe] And his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken; and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate. \\n\\n 11:23 [hgb] 与 那 君 结 盟 之 后 ， 他 必 行 诡 诈 ， 因 为 他 必 上 来 以 微 小 的 军 （ 原 文 作 民 ） 成 为 强 盛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. \\n\\n [bbe] And from the time when they make an agreement with him, he will be working falsely: for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force, \\n\\n 11:24 [hgb] 趁 人 坦 然 无 备 的 时 候 ， 他 必 来 到 国 中 极 肥 美 之 地 ， 行 他 列 祖 和 他 列 祖 之 祖 所 未 曾 行 的 ， 将 掳 物 ， 掠 物 ， 和 财 宝 散 给 众 人 ， 又 要 设 计 攻 打 保 障 ， 然 而 这 都 是 暂 时 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers\u0027 fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. \\n\\n [bbe] Against fertile places, and will make waste a part of the country; and he will do what his fathers have not done, or his fathers\u0027 fathers; he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force, and of property: he will even make designs against the strong places for a time. \\n\\n 11:25 [hgb] 他 必 奋 勇 向 前 ， 率 领 大 军 攻 击 南 方 王 。 南 方 王 也 必 以 极 大 极 强 的 军 兵 与 他 争 战 ， 却 站 立 不 住 ， 因 为 有 人 设 计 谋 害 南 方 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army: but he will be forced to give way, because of their designs against him; \\n\\n 11:26 [hgb] 吃 王 膳 的 ， 必 败 坏 他 。 他 的 军 队 必 被 冲 没 ， 而 且 被 杀 的 甚 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. \\n\\n [bbe] And his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall, and his army will come to complete destruction, and a great number will be put to the sword. \\n\\n 11:27 [hgb] 至 于 这 二 王 ， 他 们 心 怀 恶 计 ， 同 席 说 谎 ， 计 谋 却 不 成 就 。 因 为 到 了 定 期 ， 事 就 了 结 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And both these kings\u0027 hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed. \\n\\n [bbe] And as for these two kings, their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table; but it will come to nothing: for the end will be at the time fixed. \\n\\n 11:28 [hgb] 北 方 王 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 必 带 许 多 财 宝 回 往 本 国 ， 他 的 心 反 对 圣 约 ， 任 意 而 行 ， 回 到 本 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will go back to his land with great wealth; and his heart will be against the holy agreement; and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land. \\n\\n 11:29 [hgb] 到 了 定 期 ， 他 必 返 回 ， 来 到 南 方 。 后 一 次 却 不 如 前 一 次 ， \\n\\n [kjv] At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. \\n\\n [bbe] At the time fixed he will come back and come into the south; but in the later time it will not be as it was before. \\n\\n 11:30 [hgb] 因 为 基 提 战 船 必 来 攻 击 他 ， 他 就 丧 胆 而 回 ， 又 要 恼 恨 圣 约 ， 任 意 而 行 。 他 必 回 来 联 络 背 弃 圣 约 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. \\n\\n [bbe] For those who go out from the west will come against him, and he will be in fear and will go back, full of wrath against the holy agreement; and he will do his pleasure: and he will go back and be united with those who have given up the holy agreement. \\n\\n 11:31 [hgb] 他 必 兴 兵 ， 这 兵 必 亵 渎 圣 地 ， 就 是 保 障 ， 除 掉 常 献 的 燔 祭 ， 设 立 那 行 毁 坏 可 憎 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. \\n\\n [bbe] And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place, even the strong place, and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear. \\n\\n 11:32 [hgb] 作 恶 违 背 圣 约 的 人 ， 他 必 用 巧 言 勾 引 。 惟 独 认 识 神 的 子 民 必 刚 强 行 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. \\n\\n [bbe] And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words: but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well. \\n\\n 11:33 [hgb] 民 间 的 智 慧 人 必 训 诲 多 人 。 然 而 他 们 多 日 必 倒 在 刀 下 ， 或 被 火 烧 ， 或 被 掳 掠 抢 夺 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. \\n\\n [bbe] And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people: but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame, being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time. \\n\\n 11:34 [hgb] 他 们 仆 倒 的 时 候 ， 稍 得 扶 助 ， 却 有 许 多 人 用 谄 媚 的 话 亲 近 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. \\n\\n [bbe] Now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help, but numbers will be joined to them in the town, and in their separate heritages. \\n\\n 11:35 [hgb] 智 慧 人 中 有 些 仆 倒 的 ， 为 要 熬 炼 其 余 的 人 ， 使 他 们 清 净 洁 白 ， 直 到 末 了 。 因 为 到 了 定 期 ， 事 就 了 结 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed. \\n\\n [bbe] And some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean, till the time of the end: for it is still for the fixed time. \\n\\n 11:36 [hgb] 王 必 任 意 而 行 ， 自 高 自 大 ， 超 过 所 有 的 神 ， 又 用 奇 异 的 话 攻 击 万 神 之 神 。 他 必 行 事 亨 通 ， 直 到 主 的 忿 怒 完 毕 ， 因 为 所 定 的 事 必 然 成 就 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done. \\n\\n [bbe] And the king will do his pleasure; he will put himself on high, lifting himself over every god, and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods; and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete; for what has been purposed will be done. \\n\\n 11:37 [hgb] 他 必 不 顾 他 列 祖 的 神 ， 也 不 顾 妇 女 所 羡 慕 的 神 ， 无 论 何 神 他 都 不 顾 。 因 为 他 必 自 大 ， 高 过 一 切 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. \\n\\n [bbe] He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women; he will have no respect for any god: for he will put himself on high over all. \\n\\n 11:38 [hgb] 他 倒 要 敬 拜 保 障 的 神 ， 用 金 ， 银 ， 宝 石 和 可 爱 之 物 敬 奉 他 列 祖 所 不 认 识 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. \\n\\n [bbe] But in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places, and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired. \\n\\n 11:39 [hgb] 他 必 靠 外 邦 神 的 帮 助 ， 攻 破 最 坚 固 的 保 障 。 凡 承 认 他 的 ， 他 必 将 荣 耀 加 给 他 们 ， 使 他 们 管 辖 许 多 人 ， 又 为 贿 赂 分 地 与 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places; to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour: and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people, and will make division of the land for a price. \\n\\n 11:40 [hgb] 到 末 了 ， 南 方 王 要 与 他 交 战 。 北 方 王 必 用 战 车 ， 马 兵 ， 和 许 多 战 船 ， 势 如 暴 风 来 攻 击 他 ， 也 必 进 入 列 国 ， 如 洪 水 泛 滥 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. \\n\\n [bbe] And at the time of the end, the king of the south will make an attack on him: and the king of the north will come against him like a storm-wind, with war-carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships; and he will go through many lands like overflowing waters. \\n\\n 11:41 [hgb] 又 必 进 入 那 荣 美 之 地 ， 有 许 多 国 就 被 倾 覆 ， 但 以 东 人 ， 摩 押 人 ， 和 一 大 半 亚 扪 人 必 脱 离 他 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will come into the beautiful land, and tens of thousands will be overcome: but these will be kept from falling into his hands: Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon. \\n\\n 11:42 [hgb] 他 必 伸 手 攻 击 列 国 。 埃 及 地 也 不 得 脱 离 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. \\n\\n [bbe] And his hand will be stretched out on the countries: and the land of the south will not be safe from him. \\n\\n 11:43 [hgb] 他 必 把 持 埃 及 的 金 银 财 宝 和 各 样 的 宝 物 。 吕 彼 亚 人 和 古 实 人 都 必 跟 从 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. \\n\\n [bbe] But he will have power over the stores of gold and silver, and over all the valued things of the south: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps. \\n\\n 11:44 [hgb] 但 从 东 方 和 北 方 必 有 消 息 扰 乱 他 ， 他 就 大 发 烈 怒 出 去 ， 要 将 多 人 杀 灭 净 尽 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. \\n\\n [bbe] But he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north; and he will go out in great wrath, to send destruction on, and put an end to, great numbers. \\n\\n 11:45 [hgb] 他 必 在 海 和 荣 美 的 圣 山 中 间 设 立 他 如 宫 殿 的 帐 幕 。 然 而 到 了 他 的 结 局 ， 必 无 人 能 帮 助 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him. \\n\\n [bbe] He will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain: but he will come to his end with no helper. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136/2027.html","bookId":155,"book":{"id":155,"title":"但以理书 Daniel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 在 位 第 三 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 城 围 困 。 [kjv] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jer...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/136","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
