{"id":89732,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The middle of the night in Crow Valley, Wisconsin, Jessie wasn\u0027t hard to find. My car and hers were the only ones trolling Main Street.\n I stopped mine in the middle of the road, left it running, lights blazing. I felt safer that way.\n She put the squad car in park, stepped out, leaned over the door. \"What\u0027s your problem?\"\n \"Got an hour?\"\n Her eyebrows shot up. \"I got nothing but hours. They roll up the sidewalks around here at seven p.m.\n You wanna come to the station?\"\n \"How about your place? I\u0027d like to talk to Will, too.\"\n Jessie shook her head. \"He\u0027s sleeping.\"\n \"At night? What is the matter with him?\"\n She smiled at that. \"He tried to get used to my schedule, but he just couldn\u0027t cut it.\"\n \"Maybe we should wake him up?\"\n \"Maybe we shouldn\u0027t.\" Jessie\u0027s expression was set and mulish. I recognized it from the mirror. She wouldn\u0027t budge.\n \"Fine. Station it is.\"\n I got in my car and followed her. Inside the Andy Griffith museum, she took a seat at her desk. \"What\u0027s up?\"\n \"Did you find out anything about Damien?\"\n Jessie frowned. \"Why the rush?\"\n I hesitated. How much to say? How much to leave out? I decided to tell her everything that wasn\u0027t personal. Which turned out to be quite a bit.\n \"Do you think he\u0027s a rogue agent?\" she asked.\n Rogue agents had been Juger-Suchers once. They\u0027d gone off on their own, still hunting, still searching, but they no longer followed any rules but their own.\n \"Could be. All we have to do is ask Edward.\"\n He knew every agent, past and present. I put the question on my mental to-do list.\n \"I talked to the owner of the tavern,\" Jessie said. \"Fitzgerald is working for cash. The guy doesn\u0027t have his Social Security number, next of kin, address, or shoe size. The setup screams shape-shifter.\"\n \"Except for the silver ring and the silver bullet in his gun,\" I murmured.\n \"Which shoots that theory all to hell.\" She shrugged. \"I ran the name Damien Fitzgerald, from New York.\n Without his Social Security number to narrow down the field... I got back a sheet of Damien Fitzgeralds as long as my forearm. None of them have records, which means no fingerprints or photos on file.\"\n \"Damn.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n Silence fell between us. I was thinking as fast as I could, but I wasn\u0027t getting anywhere.\n \"You didn\u0027t come speeding into town to talk about Damien,\" Jessie said. \"Something else spooked you.\n Wanna tell me what?\"\n \"Not really.\"\n Jessie sighed and leaned back in her chair. \"I know about your family.\"\n My head came up so fast the room spun. My eyes narrowed.\n \"Relax. Mandenauer didn\u0027t say anything that wasn\u0027t in the police report.\" Her lips twitched. \"Except for the part about the werewolves.\"\n The police had decided that mad dogs killed my family. There were so many of them in Topeka.\n \"I can\u0027t imagine what it was like,\" she said gently.\n \"No, you can\u0027t.\"\n \"My best friend was a werewolf. She fooled me for years. Wanted to make me one of them. Then rule the world. I stopped her.\"\n Our eyes met, and I saw how much what had happened in Miniwa had affected her. Having someone you trusted turn furry and try to kill you didn\u0027t happen every day. For an instant I wanted to reach out, but she just had to open her mouth again.\n \"You know something else, and I don\u0027t want to get killed because you\u0027re too much of sissy to tell me what it is.\"\n I shook my head as if I\u0027d been doused with a bucket of water, then wiggled my ringer in my ear. \"Sissy?\"\n \"You heard me. What did you see out there tonight that scared you enough to make you run to me?\"\n Jessie might be the most annoying person on the planet, but she wasn\u0027t dumb, she wasn\u0027t slow, and she wasn\u0027t going to go away until I told her.\n In truth, I was scared. Had I seen the white wolf or hadn\u0027t I? If I had, we were all in deep shit. If I hadn\u0027t, only I was. Either way, it couldn\u0027t hurt to ask a question.\n \"Have you ever heard the name Hector Menendez?\"\n \"Should I have?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re the sheriff.\"\n \"You think he\u0027s here?\"\n I sighed. \"Maybe.\"\n \"What does he look like?\"\n \"Six-foot-two, a hundred and eighty pounds, black hair, goatee, blue eyes, Hispanic. Very... handsome,\"\n I managed.\n Hector had been one of the most beautiful men I\u0027d ever seen. Beauty was part of his allure. By the time I\u0027d discovered what that beauty hid, it had been too late.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen him,\" Jessie said. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean anything. People come and go. Did you see him?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\n \"Maybe you\u0027d better tell me who he is.\"\n \"Hector\u0027s the werewolf that killed my family,\" I said.\n Her eyes widened. \"And you saw him in Crow Valley?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I repeated. \"I thought I saw a wolf outside the bar. I followed him, but the one I shot was black, not white.\"\n \"You said Hector had black hair.\"\n \"He did.\"\n \"Then how could he be a white wolf?\"\n \"His mother was blond and so was Hector.\"\n He\u0027d shown me a picture of her and him. Hector had been a true towhead as a child - the thick, wavy locks nearly white instead of blond. I\u0027d thought it cute that he carried a picture of his mother and himself in his wallet. Later, when he\u0027d told me the rest, the picture had disturbed me. Sadly, it hadn\u0027t disturbed me enough to make me stop seeing him. Although by then it was probably too late.\n \"His mother left the family when he was very young, and he hated her. So he dyed his hair the shade of his father\u0027s. Hector is a tiny bit psychotic, I\u0027m afraid.\"\n \"How can you be a tiny bit psychotic?\"\n \"Fine.\" I threw up my hands. \"He\u0027s a raving lunatic.\"\n \"Swell. A psychotic werewolf.\" She stood up, kicked the desk. \"Just what we need.\"\n Suddenly she whirled toward me. \"Wait a second. We\u0027re searching for a cannibal. Now you tell me there\u0027s a lunatic in town. That seems like too much of a coincidence to me.\"\n \"But the brown werewolf ate the others.\"\n \"Did he? You told me you saw the brown wolf, he killed one; then later we found them eaten. It doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s our man.\" She frowned. \"I mean wolf.\"\n \"But if he isn\u0027t, that means we\u0027ve got a brown wolf killing and a white wolf eating.\"\n \"Or two of them doing both.\"\n \"Hell,\" I muttered.\n Silence fell.\n \"Jessie?\"\n She glanced at me and something in my face must have reached her, because she sat down and spread her hands. \"What?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I saw Hector. I - \" This was hard to say, especially to her. \"I lost my mind when my family died. Saw a lot of things that weren\u0027t there for quite a while. Maybe I saw Hector.\" I took a deep breath, let it out slowly, wished like hell for a cigarette. \"And maybe I didn\u0027t.\"\n I expected her to make some biting comment, put me in my place, then tell me she\u0027d call Edward and have him take me away. Instead she shrugged, pulled a pad of paper across the desk, and picked up a pencil. \"That\u0027s Menen-dez? M-e-n-e ... ?\"\n I stared at her. She made an impatient sound. \"How the hell do you spell his name?\"\n \"But - \"\n \"But what? If that psycho is in my town, I want to know about it.\"\n \"But what if I was seeing things?\"\n \"What if you weren\u0027t?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t it bother you to work with someone who was once certifiable?\"\n \"No more than it bothers me to work with someone who\u0027s as big of a pain in my ass as you are.\"\n We stared at each other for several more seconds, until she gave an annoyed growl. \"Do you mind, nut job? I\u0027ve only got so much time available to check out your delusions.\"\n Wow, another warm and fuzzy bonding moment.\n \" M-e-n-e-n-d-e-z,\" I spelled out.\n \"Gracias,\" she mocked.\n Miss Politically Incorrect.\n \"I doubt you\u0027ll find much,\" I said. \"Back when my family was killed... Well, by the time I was able to...\"\n Think without screaming? Talk without babbling? Breathe without crying?\n \"Articulate,\" I managed, \"Hector was long gone. They checked him out.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"He\u0027d been pronounced dead in 1977 from a hunting accident. Kind of made it hard to put out an APB\n on him.\"\n \"What did the police do then?\"\n I rolled my eyes. \"What do you think? When they arrived at the scene of the crime, I was in a corner talking to myself. Three months later I blame a dead man. They thought I was loony toons.\"\n \"In other words, they did nothing.\"\n \"What were they supposed to do, Jessie?\"\n \"Let me ask a better question: What did Mandenauer do?\"\n Her words made me smile. \"He saved me that night, then called the police and disappeared. I saw him next at the hospital.\" I lifted a brow. \"The psychiatric hospital.\"\n She shrugged and made a whirling motion with her finger. Big deal; get on with it.\n \"After weeks of being told I was crazy, he believed me. He got me out of there. I\u0027m not sure how.\"\n Having someone to talk to who didn\u0027t give me a pill every time I said \"werewolf\" had cleared my head better than a cold shower. Just being with Edward had made me feel sane again.\n \"He told me my family was at peace. He\u0027d made sure they wouldn\u0027t rise.\"\n \"I hate it when that happens,\" Jessie muttered.\n I glanced at her quickly. \"You\u0027ve seen one?\"\n \"Not seen - no. But I had a few disappear out of the morgue. One went in there with her head blown off.\"\n \"Uh-oh, someone didn\u0027t use silver.\"\n \"Bingo.\"\n I found it disturbing, to say the least, to have corpses with body parts blown off suddenly rejuvenate. But when you were dealing with werewolves such things happened all the time.\n Being bitten will cause a change within twenty-four hours. Day, night, full moon, no moon, it doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027re bitten, you change. After that, you can heal damn near anything - except silver.\n Hector had murdered my family. He\u0027d been after me. He\u0027d been inches away from biting me, but Edward had gotten there first. Too late to save the people I loved, but not too late to save me. Even so, Hector had left his mark on me forever.\n \"After Mandenauer sprang you from the crazy ward,\" Jessie continued, \"what did he do?\"\n \"He taught me everything he knew.\"\n \"Blah, blah, blah. I meant, what did he do about Hector?\"\n Oh. \"He used all the 7-5 resources to search for him, but we never found a trace.\"\n \"Which doesn\u0027t mean much.\"\n \"No.\"\n Hector could be anywhere, using any name, doing anything he wanted. There was a certain freedom to being dead on paper.\n \"Do you know where he came from? How old he was? Who made him?\"\n The answers to any of those questions could help pinpoint where a werewolf might hide, who he might hang with. Sadly, I knew the answers to none of them in relation to Hector Menendez.\n \"I didn\u0027t know he was a werewolf until I saw him - \"\n I broke off as a vivid image flashed through my brain. My little sister, Jimmy, Mama. Hector\u0027s blue eyes shining from the face of a white wolf.\n \"Hey!\" Jessie grabbed my hand, squeezed hard enough to make me wince. \"I thought you were going to pass out there for a second.\"\n I straightened and pulled away. I\u0027d done enough fainting for one lifetime. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I snapped.\n \"Sure you are.\"\n Being irritated with Jessie helped me focus on the here and now instead of my past. Which was probably why she was being so annoying. Or maybe she just came by it naturally. Like me.\n \"Hector told me he was from Texas. Corpus Christi. He sold drugs.\"\n Her eyes widened. \"Dealer?\"\n \"Pharmaceutical rep.\"\n Jessie turned a startled laugh into a cough. \"And none of that was true?\"\n \"None of it.\"\n I\u0027d met him in a restaurant where I\u0027d gone for dinner with my parents. He\u0027d been sitting in the bar alone, listening to music - Norah Jones, I think. Funny what you remember about one of the most important moments of your life.\n He was tall and handsome; his dark skin and hair, combined with his light eyes and a well-trimmed goatee, gave him an exotic appearance. To little Miss Kansas and her white-bread, perfect life, Hector had been danger and desire all rolled into one.\n I\u0027d gone out with him a few times - secretly, of course. I\u0027d been young, foolish, captivated, for a little while. Hector was quick to take insult - both real and imagined. He had a short temper and very little tolerance for anyone who was different from himself. An odd trait in a man named Menendez.\n \"You haven\u0027t heard from him since?\"\n I hesitated. \"He called me at the hospital.\"\n \"How did he manage that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I may have imagined the calls.\"\n As I\u0027d imagined so many things.\n \"What did he say?\"\n I didn\u0027t want to remember all that Hector had told me - his plans, our future, his obsession.\n \"Nothing important.\"\n She eyed me for a long moment, then let it go. \"Why would he be here? Why now?\"\n I\u0027d had the same thoughts. That Jessie had them, too, helped. I relaxed just a little. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted.\n \"I\u0027ll keep my eyes open. A guy like that shouldn\u0027t be hard to spot in a town like this.\"\n She was right. And if I saw him first I wasn\u0027t going to wait around to see the whites of his eyes. I doubted Jessie would, either. The very thought made me feel stronger, more in control, safer.\n \"There\u0027s one more thing.\" I paused, then forced myself to blurt, \"He has a tattoo.\"\n Jessie lifted a brow. \"Not a good thing to leave out, Leigh. A tattoo of what?\"\n \"Pentagram.\"\n She frowned. \"Isn\u0027t that supposed to be protection against a werewolf?\"\n Surprise, surprise. Jessie didn\u0027t know everything.\n \"Not exactly. A pentagram is a five-pointed star. Some believe it\u0027s evil; others believe it\u0027s good.\"\n \"What do you think?\"\n Since the only time I\u0027d ever seen one was as a tattoo on Hector\u0027s chest, I kind of thought the pentagram was Satan\u0027s tool.\n \"Supposedly, depending upon how the star is positioned, it can summon the powers of light or the powers of darkness.\"\n \"I guess we know which one Hector was after.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"So where was this tattoo?\"\n I tapped a finger between my breasts.\n Jessie\u0027s mouth fell open. I glanced away. I didn\u0027t need to explain how I\u0027d seen Hector\u0027s chest. I\u0027m sure she could figure it out.\n \"I doubt I\u0027ll get a good look at a stranger\u0027s breastbone,\" she remarked.\n I doubted she would, either, but I\u0027d told her all I knew.\n Now we had to figure out if he was slinking around town. Knowing Hector, we wouldn\u0027t see him until it was too late.\n \"I ran an Internet search on cannibals.\"\n \"Excuse me?\" Jessie\u0027s rapid change of subject left me blinking. \"On what?\"\n \"You heard me.\" She shoved some papers across the desk. \"Will said the original Weendigo was a man who ate human flesh.\"\n \"That\u0027s just a legend.\"\n \"So are werewolves.\"\n She had a point. I picked up the papers and started to read.\n Albert Fish - 1935 Stanley Dean Baker - 1970 Omaima Nelson - 1993 Nathaniel Bar-Jonah - 1996\n And, of course, Jeffrey Dahmer, the man who made Milwaukee famous.\n The accounts were gruesome, nauseating, thorough. I read them anyway. When I was done, I shoved the papers back across the desk, unwilling to hold on to them any longer. My fingers felt slimy already.\n \"What exactly are we trying to find?\" I asked.\n \"Hell if I know. Something out of the ordinary.\"\n \"In there?\"\n Everything I\u0027d read had been far from ordinary.\n \"I noticed one thing,\" Jessie continued. \"Before World War Two, there were very few serial killers.\"\n \"Maybe it was just harder to catch them then.\"\n \"Could be.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Do you remember what happened in World War Two, Leigh?\"\n \"Wanna be more specific?\"\n \"What happened that involves us?\"\n Oh, that.\n During the war Edward had been a spy. He\u0027d discovered that Josef Mengele had been doing more than experimenting on the Jews at Auschwitz. He\u0027d also had a secret lab deep in the Black Forest.\n There he\u0027d manufactured monsters. Hitler had demanded a werewolf army, among other things.\n Edward\u0027s mission had been to eliminate everything Mengele had made. By the time Mandenauer reached the lab, the Allies had hit the beaches and Russia was closing in. Mengele panicked and released all his creations into the world. They had been multiplying, mutating, spreading, ever since.\n Edward, being Edward, was still following the orders he had never completely carried out.\n \"You think the increase in serial killers has something to do with the Nazis?\" I asked.\n \"You got a better idea?\"\n I thought about it. We didn\u0027t know to this day everything Mengele had been manufacturing in his lab.\n Sure, there had been monsters before he started making them. History was full of \u0027em. But after - there\u0027d been a whole lot more.\n \"What\u0027s your theory?\" I asked.\n \"Maybe some of these cannibals were werewolves, too. Maybe they can\u0027t control themselves even when they\u0027re human.\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n Or they could just be nuts.\n \"What does that mean to us?\" I asked. \"Here and now.\"\n \"Maybe this Weendigo started out as a human.\"\n \"They all started out as human.\"\n \"Let me finish. Instead of being bitten, he was cursed by his lust for flesh. He became a beast, like the legend. But even in beast form he can\u0027t stop being a cannibal.\"\n She was making a weird sort of sense.\n \"I still don\u0027t see how we\u0027re going to figure out who it is that we\u0027re searching for.\"\n \"What if there\u0027s a suspect in a cannibalistic serial killer case who suddenly disappeared?\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"And what if a lot of dead, half-eaten wolves had turned up in the same place?\"\n She could be on to something, except -\n \"Edward said there\u0027d been no incidences of cannibalistic werewolves but this one.\"\n Jessie cursed. There went her theory.\n But something tickled at the back of my mind. \"Wait.\"\n I held up my hand, tilted my head, thought hard, and suddenly there it was. \"What if he\u0027s been soothing his need for cannibalism in human form and he just started satisfying that particular peculiarity in wolf form?\"\n Jessie stared at me as if I\u0027d just said something very interesting. \"I guess it couldn\u0027t hurt to get information on open serial killer cases.\"\n \"Right. But we don\u0027t want the FBI showing up here. They never can manage to blend in.\"\n \"Who has a contact at Quantico?\"\n \"Mandenauer,\" she said, at the same time I said, \"Edward.\"\n Jessie picked up the phone.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-14.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) \n eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
