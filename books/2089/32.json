{"id":89750,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"Fuck me,\" I muttered. \"I think that\u0027s what he has in mind.\" \"Now what?\" I asked, which seemed to be the question of the week. \"Now we keep blasting wolves whenever the opportunity presents itself, search for their lair, keep an eye out for Hector night and day, and dig, dig, dig some more for a way to end this before the moon gets full.\" \"Because if we don\u0027t?\" \"You get to do the dirty in front of every werewolf in town.\" I wanted to say something flippant, but my voice betrayed me. All I could do was move my mouth. No sound came out. Jessie appeared concerned. She moved closer and patted me on the back, hard enough to make me choke, then cough. At least it was something. \"I\u0027m OK,\" I managed. \"Will wants to go back to Cora\u0027s. Borrow some of her books. Wanna come?\" She was babysitting me. I wasn\u0027t going to let her. \"No. I\u0027ve got things to do.\" Jessie frowned. \"But - \" \"If what you say is true, I\u0027m safe until the full moon. If it\u0027s even Hector.\" \"We both know it\u0027s Hector, Leigh.\" I shifted my shoulders. Pain flashed across my skin. Yeah, we did. \"I need some sleep,\" I said. \"Why don\u0027t you come back here with the books. I\u0027ll order pizza. We\u0027ll brainstorm, then go out and kill things. It\u0027ll be a girls\u0027 night out.\" She hesitated. \"You promise you\u0027ll stay inside until we get back?\" \"Yes, Mother.\" Her eyes narrowed, but she got off the couch and moved toward the door. She seemed to have no ill effects from her own shoulder wound. I was glad. Jessie paused with her hand on the doorknob. \"We know what they\u0027re up to, Leigh. That means we\u0027re one step ahead of them. I\u0027ve got a good feeling about this.\" \"Well then, everything\u0027s gonna be all right.\" Her lips twitched. She almost laughed. \"Keep on being a smart guy. You know how I love that.\" The door shut behind her. I looked around the rented room, took in my bag and my laptop. I had no address but .com, no closet but a suitcase. I was suddenly sick of having nowhere to call home. When had that happened? I lay down, tried to sleep. Drifted in and out. But every time I closed my eyes I saw the mine, those human bones. There was something weird about that. They were almost like a warning. I sat bolt upright in my bed. We\u0027d never gone past those bones and suddenly I wanted to. I glanced at the window. Night was falling. I must have drifted further than I\u0027d thought. I\u0027d promised Jessie I wouldn\u0027t go outside, definitely shouldn\u0027t at this time of night. Oh well, I\u0027d never been very good at keeping promises. Remember the one I\u0027d made to Jimmy? I got dressed, grabbed a few guns, some ammo, then walked downstairs. Damien\u0027s cabin was dark. However, the bar was lit up like a major-league baseball field during the seventh-inning stretch. I headed in that direction. Even Jessie couldn\u0027t get mad at me for investigating with Damien at my side. What better backup than a werewolf? Too bad I couldn\u0027t tell her that. Stepping inside the tavern, I frowned. The place was empty, except for the shoes, wallets, purses, keys, and little piles of clothing. My fingers tightened on my rifle. Their lair had been here all the time. Damien had to have known. Why hadn\u0027t he told me? Of course, I hadn\u0027t asked. Who\u0027d have suspected they were changing right underneath my nose? Talk about hiding in plain sight. My plans changed. I\u0027d just sit down and wait for them to come back. I thought of how many I\u0027d kill tonight. Maybe even Hector, though I doubted it. He wouldn\u0027t be dumb enough to show his face here. So why was my scar burning as if it were a fresh, new wound? \"Waitin\u0027 for someone?\" I gasped and spun toward the bar. Cowboy stood on top, leering, snarling, or whatever the hell it was he did with his lip. \"Uh, yeah, well, I was looking for Damien.\" Cowboy narrowed his eyes. \"He ain\u0027t around.\" \"I see that.\" \"Yer not gonna ask why everyone\u0027s clothes are all over the floor?\" \"Why?\" He snorted. \"You know why.\" Cowboy jumped off the bar, his boots clicking on the wood floor as he meandered toward me. I kept my hands on my guns, my eyes on his face. I\u0027d crossed him off as a werewolf long ago, but maybe that hadn\u0027t been such a bright idea. I\u0027d figured if he was a shifter he\u0027d have cured whatever ailment had made him a midget in the first place. But maybe he hadn\u0027t. Maybe he liked being small. Maybe it got him ignored. He stopped only a foot away from me. \"I got some-thin\u0027 to show you.\" He began to unbutton his shirt. I backed toward the door. \"Uh, no thanks.\" He smiled. \"You don\u0027t mind seeing Damien\u0027s chest, but you don\u0027t want to see mine?\" \"That about sums it up.\" \"Believe me, Leigh, you\u0027re gonna want to see this.\" Somehow I doubted that. I reached for the doorknob. My hand touched the brass just as Cowboy\u0027s shirt fell open. The pentagram tattoo on his breastbone gleamed black against his pale, smooth skin. I couldn\u0027t move. Couldn\u0027t breathe. I lifted my gaze from his chest to his face. His eyes were weird - water flowing under dark ice. I stood there staring as Cowboy\u0027s black irises turned blue. \"Oh, God,\" I whispered. His face was flowing now, the skin rippling like Silly Putty. I could see another face beneath, fighting to get out. Was he getting taller? Broader? When had Cowboy grown a goatee? The tavern spun. Tiny black spots flickered in front of my eyes. I fought the weakness, but it didn\u0027t do any good. \"Querida,\" he murmured. \"I\u0027ve missed you.\" I passed out cold at the toe of itty-bitty boots, which had suddenly burst open at the seams.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-32.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
