{"id":89748,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"About a year ago,\" Damien continued, \"I was in Arkansas.\"\\n\\n \"You get around.\"\\n\\n \"Have to. People disappearing is one thing. A whole bunch of them disappearing in the same place is another.\"\\n\\n I shrugged, conceding the point.\\n\\n \"Werewolves crave human flesh. Most feed a few times a month, more often if they have a wound to heal. But there\u0027s one night we have to feed.\"\\n\\n \"The full moon.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Strange things happen on that night. Ask any cop, ER worker, any third-shift waitress or bartender. Full moon equals a very busy night. A year ago I was in the Arkansas hills. There was a woman...\" His voice faded and he stared at his feet again.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry; I won\u0027t be jealous.\"\\n\\n As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I wanted them back. I sounded like a scorned lover, a pathetic, needy girlie-girl. Everything I\u0027d never wanted to be.\\n\\n Sighing, he ignored my jibe. \"It\u0027s just... hard to remember how I was. What I did.\"\\n\\n I doubted I wanted to hear this, but I had to. \"Go on.\"\\n\\n Damien took a deep breath. \"I\u0027d done some work on her place. She was alone. Her husband took off.\\n\\n She had four kids.\"\\n\\n My eyes widened. He really was a pig.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d planned on staying awhile. I could get several full moons\u0027 worth.\"\\n\\n His voice flattened; his eyes went distant; his face was the mask it had been when I first met him, devoid of emotion and life.\\n\\n \"They lived alone. Existed hand-to-mouth. They were perfect, and they were mine.\"\\n\\n \"What happened?\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"The full moon came, so beautiful and bright. The harvest moon. September. Warm days, cool nights, clear skies. I changed and ran, the wind in my fur, the grass beneath my feet. I ran until I was starving, and then I went back.\"\\n\\n His voice shook on the last word. He scrubbed his fingers through his hair and his hand shook, too.\\n\\n \"Damien - \" I began.\\n\\n He ignored me. \"She always sat outside once she got the kids to bed. A little \u0027lone time, she called it. I walked right onto the porch. She didn\u0027t even move.\"\\n\\n He stared straight ahead as if he could see his past. \"The youngest child opened the door. The mother cried out, tried to push her back, but the little girl took one look at me and - \" Damien shook his head.\\n\\n \"She couldn\u0027t have been more than five or six, and she knew what I was going to do. She squirmed out of her mother\u0027s hold shouting, \u0027No, Damien,\u0027 threw her arms around my neck, and whispered, \u0027Take me.\\n\\n Mommy needs to be a mommy for the others.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Sacrifice,\" I murmured. \"You didn\u0027t - \"\\n\\n \"No. But I would have. I didn\u0027t give a shit about sacrifice, mother\u0027s love, anything but meat.\"\\n\\n I flinched.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have killed them all, but for one thing. The child said my human name while I was in wolf form.\"\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t work - \"\\n\\n \"Not to change a werewolf\u0027s form, but it works pretty damned well to curse him. If there\u0027s an Ozark Mountain magic woman nearby.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Mommy knew magic.\"\\n\\n \"Magic.\" I resisted the urge to snort. \"Right.\"\\n\\n His lips lifted, just a little. \"We\u0027re discussing werewolves and you\u0027re rolling your eyes about magic?\\n\\n There\u0027s a saying in the Ozarks - if you throw out the witch, you\u0027d better throw out the Bible, too.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"If you can believe in supernatural evil, why can\u0027t you believe in supernatural good?\"\\n\\n He had a point. \"So what did the Ozark magic woman do?\"\\n\\n \"Not much. The most important thing had already been done. Sacrifice.\"\\n\\n \"But you said you didn\u0027t - \"\\n\\n \"Just because I didn\u0027t kill that child doesn\u0027t make her sacrifice any less heroic. I could have run, but I was paralyzed, confused. A being that thrives on selfishness is confronted with total sacrifice. I might have been a wolf, but I still had my brain and it was on overload. I stood there while the mother yanked her child away from me. Her face was wet with tears as she cut her own wrist - \"\\n\\n \"Blood, tears, sacrifice.\"\\n\\n \"The usual,\" he murmured, echoing words of my own that he\u0027d never even heard. \"Then she cursed, or maybe she blessed, me. I\u0027m still not sure. She said, \u0027Damien, from this day on your soul is yours again.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"When I became a werewolf, my soul was possessed by evil. I was myself but not myself. She gave me back my soul and my conscience.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a terrible thing to remember what you\u0027ve done and know how wrong it was.\"\\n\\n I understood why his eyes were always sad. Why he never smiled and rarely laughed. Understood but didn\u0027t forgive.\\n\\n \"You chose to be one of them.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"When did you start to hunt your own kind?\"\\n\\n \"I left Arkansas for obvious reasons. Went to Florida, hid in the Everglades. I was haunted by fifty years of faces. Yet the next month, when the full moon came, I hunted. I had no choice. The hunger is a burning, painful thing. You can\u0027t think past it.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you shoot yourself before the next full moon?\"\\n\\n He lifted a brow. \"I wasn\u0027t quite that desperate. Yet.\"\\n\\n \"Yet?\"\\n\\n \"What do you think the gun behind the toilet tank was for, Leigh?\"\\n\\n \"I thought it wasn\u0027t yours.\"\\n\\n \"I lied.\"\\n\\n I blinked. He\u0027d lied about the gun. But what was one more lie? What disturbed me was how well he\u0027d lied. I\u0027d believed him completely. As completely as I\u0027d believed he loved me.\\n\\n \"Where is it now?\"\\n\\n \"Somewhere safe. In case I need it.\"\\n\\n \"I used the bullet.\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I can always get more.\"\\n\\n \"But you can\u0027t touch silver.\"\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t know someone who can.\"\\n\\n The idea of a hidden gun with a single silver bullet, just in case, disturbed me, and I wasn\u0027t sure why. I still might shoot him myself. I pushed the thought aside for later analysis. I had enough on my plate already.\\n\\n \"So you went hunting in the Everglades - \"\\n\\n \"Miami, actually. A lot more people. But despite the hunger, I couldn\u0027t do it. The very thought of killing and eating a person suddenly nauseated me. Then I came upon another like me and the sickness disappeared. I could kill them. With every werewolf destroyed I\u0027d be saving lives, and maybe I could atone a little bit for all the deaths.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if I believed him. What if he was the power eater? What if he was the white wolf and the brown? What if he was Hector? What if he wasn\u0027t? I wasn\u0027t truly certain my nemesis was here - except for the weird stinging of my back. Which just might mean I was halfway to crazy again.\\n\\n I decided to try a frontal assault. \"You won\u0027t get away with it.\"\\n\\n \"OK. Whatever it is.\"\\n\\n He seemed as confused as I was, but he\u0027d seemed a lot of things and none of them were true.\\n\\n \"Why are you here?\" I asked. \"There has to be a reason you came to Crow Valley instead of any other burg on the planet.\"\\n\\n He blinked. \"You don\u0027t know?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I figured that was why you were here, too.\"\\n\\n I started to feel uneasy. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Crow Valley. You don\u0027t know why it\u0027s called that?\"\\n\\n \"Because there are a lot of crows, though I\u0027ve only seen one.\"\\n\\n \"There were a lot of crows, back when the town began. Because this place was wolf haven.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"Now it\u0027s werewolf run.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\\n\\n \"When this town was founded there were a lot of crows and wolves. But when werewolves move in - \"\\n\\n \"Real wolves move out.\"\\n\\n \"And the regular folks don\u0027t notice the difference. Until it\u0027s too late.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying that Crow Valley has a higher than average population of shape-shifters.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m saying.\"\\n\\n Which would explain why the power eater was here.\\n\\n \"Tell me how you get more powerful from killing them. How can you eat your own kind?\"\\n\\n \"Eat my - What?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t bullshit me, Damien. I\u0027m here because there\u0027s a werewolf killing other werewolves - \"\\n\\n \"Me.\"\\n\\n \"And eating them.\"\\n\\n His face went blank. \"Not me.\"\\n\\n \"You said you no longer crave human flesh.\"\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t mean I crave werewolf meat.\"\\n\\n \"Well, what do you eat?\"\\n\\n \"Cheeseburgers.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d think he was kidding, but he so rarely was.\\n\\n Damien glanced away as if embarrassed. \"The blood-lust seems to be satisfied by killing them.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying you aren\u0027t trying to become the supreme alpha on the night of the hunter\u0027s moon.\"\\n\\n His gaze returned to mine. \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Right. There are two of you running around these woods killing other wolves.\"\\n\\n Something flickered in his eyes.\\n\\n \"What?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"There\u0027ve been a lot of disappearing lycanthropes. More than I\u0027ve killed. I figured some of them were scared off, or just took off, but...\"\\n\\n \"But what?\"\\n\\n \"A few times when I\u0027ve been hunting I could swear there was another wolf following me.\"\\n\\n Was he lying again? I had no idea.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d circle around, try to get a scent, but it would change. Appear. Disappear. Lap over other scents. I couldn\u0027t catch up to him. I never saw another wolf, except the ones I killed.\"\\n\\n Had the power eater been trailing Damien, eating his kills, stealing their power? Or was Damien working with him and lying to me?\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to believe. I didn\u0027t know what to do. Could I kill him - right here, right now, when he was doing nothing but talking to me? I didn\u0027t think so.\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell me what\u0027s going on?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I can help.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you can kiss my ass.\"\\n\\n \"Leigh.\" He got to his feet and started toward me.\\n\\n I aimed my rifle at his head. \"Stay over there.\"\\n\\n He stopped walking, but he didn\u0027t sit down. \"We need to talk.\"\\n\\n \"About what?\"\\n\\n \"Us.\"\\n\\n Suddenly I was out of my chair, the barrel pressed to his throat. Stupid, really. Werewolves, in both forms, can move more quickly than the human eye. He could take the gun away from me. He had before.\\n\\n He only had to want to.\\n\\n I was angry, scared, hurt. I\u0027d dreamed things about him and now those dreams were as dead as all my others.\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t any us, Damien.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still the same man you slept with.\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re the monster who lied to me.\"\\n\\n A flicker of hurt passed over his face and for an instant I almost felt bad. Then I remembered something I\u0027d chosen, for a little while, to forget.\\n\\n \"The last time we - \" I broke off. I couldn\u0027t make myself say it.\\n\\n \"Made love?\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t love.\"\\n\\n \"It was for me.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do to me?\" I gave him a little shove with the barrel of the gun.\\n\\n \"I thought I made you come.\"\\n\\n He was pissing me off. Shooting him didn\u0027t seem so bad anymore, but I needed some answers first.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t use a condom. Does this mean I\u0027ll have puppies? Cubs? What?\"\\n\\n Damien sighed. \"I meant it when I said I couldn\u0027t get you pregnant. Cross-species impregnation is impossible. I\u0027d think you hotshot Jdger-Suchers would know that.\"\\n\\n I frowned. Yeah, why didn\u0027t we?\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t give me what you have, did you?\"\\n\\n \"Lycanthropy?\"\\n\\n \"Or anything else disgusting?\"\\n\\n \"The werewolf virus can only be passed through saliva while in wolf form.\"\\n\\n I knew that.\\n\\n \"Any disease I might have would be healed the first time I changed. Just like any wound that wasn\u0027t inflicted with silver.\"\\n\\n Huh, learn something new every day.\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the case, then why did you use a condom in the first place?\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you have wondered if I didn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n Maybe. If I\u0027d been able to think beyond having him inside me.\\n\\n \"I was trying to pass for human,\" he said. \"Especially with you.\"\\n\\n \"Why especially?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t care too much about living, but I didn\u0027t want to die. I\u0027ve got too many of them to kill yet.\"\\n\\n I remembered the sentiment, from my own head. That we thought alike disturbed me. I lowered the gun from his neck. \"Move back.\"\\n\\n He did, but not far enough. Right now, Venezuela wouldn\u0027t be far enough.\\n\\n I sat down. My legs didn\u0027t want to hold me upright much longer.\\n\\n Werewolves have evil hearts, possessed souls. They\u0027d kill their own mother. Lying would be kid stuff. I couldn\u0027t believe anything Damien told me.\\n\\n So why did I want to? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-30.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) \\n eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
