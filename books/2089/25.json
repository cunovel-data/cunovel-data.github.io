{"id":89743,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"We need to make an appointment with Cora,\" Will said.\n \"An appointment?\" Jessie asked. \"She\u0027s that busy?\"\n \"You\u0027d be surprised.\"\n \"Call her then.\"\n Will undipped his cell phone from his belt. \"No service. Again.\"\n Jessie glanced at her phone and growled. Sometimes cell service was lost this deep in the woods.\n \"Why don\u0027t you two go on,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll finish up here.\"\n Jessie frowned. \"This is my job - \"\n \"Is it? I thought it was mine.\"\n \"You two could arm wrestle for it,\" Will suggested.\n I\u0027d tangled with Jessie once. In a fair fight, she could kill me. A dirty fight was another matter. But I\u0027m sure a dirty fight - as in mud wrestling - was just what Will had in mind.\n \"I\u0027ll pass.\"\n \"Me, too.\" Jessie considered for a moment, then gave in. \"Fine, Duchess, you burn the fanged and furry; we\u0027ll go back to town and set up an appointment with the voodoo priestess.\"\n \"Grand medicine spirit woman,\" Will said. \"Eighth level.\"\n \"Whatever.\"\n \"Jess, she\u0027s old and very well respected. You have to behave.\"\n Jessie looked at me. \"Don\u0027t I know how to behave?\"\n I glanced at Will. \"Am I supposed to answer that?\"\n \"No. Give us a call,\" he glanced at his cell, then hooked it back on his belt, \"when you get to your place.\n Maybe we can see Cora today.\"\n He took Jessie\u0027s arm and tugged her back the way we\u0027d come. Amazingly, she went without argument.\n Probably figured they\u0027d have time for a quickie - I glanced at the three wolves - maybe even a longie, before I was finished.\n I dragged them into the center of the clearing, as far away from trees and bushes as I was able to get, added accelerant, then pulled out a match. I\u0027d done this so many times, I wasn\u0027t really paying attention.\n Instead, my gaze drifted to the forest, absently watching the flicker of Jessie\u0027s and Will\u0027s clothing fade away.\n I struck the match, and a sudden flash between me and them made me freeze. I stared in horror at what appeared to be stealthily moving white fur. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the sight or figure out what it might mean.\n Then the match burned down to my fingertip and the pain caused me to curse, then drop it on the ground.\n I stomped the flame into oblivion and glanced back in the same direction.\n The flash of white was still there.\n I lifted my face to the sky. The sun shone brightly in the middle of the day, though the rays did not penetrate into the deep forest. Nevertheless, I drew my gun and ran.\n I should have shouted right away, warned them, something, but I wanted to kill him. I wanted to end this before I had to see someone else I cared about die.\n Time seemed to slow. They couldn\u0027t have gone far, yet I seemed to run forever without getting any closer.\n The brush cleared and I saw him. Or thought I did. Poised to spring, he was still too far away for me to hit with a handgun.\n \"Jessie!\" I shouted. \"Wolf!\"\n A gunshot rang out. I frowned at the weapon in my hand. I hadn\u0027t fired it.\n Another shot brought my head up. The gunfire was coming from the other direction, and the white wolf was gone.\n I ran toward Jessie and Will, heedless of the sniper. The shots had stopped. Because they were hit? Or because the shooter was gone?\n I burst through the trees, saw them on the ground, and my heart lurched. Jessie had thrown her body over Will. Her gun was drawn and aimed toward the shots, but when she heard me the barrel swung in my direction.\n \"Get down!\" Jessie snarled.\n I hit the dirt.\n Will struggled to get up. Jessie shoved his head into the ground. \"Don\u0027t,\" she warned.\n We lay there for five minutes at least, ears straining for the sound of approaching footsteps - or padding paws. Nothing happened.\n Eventually I motioned toward the west. Jessie nodded and I crawled into the brush as she covered me. I scouted the area all around us. Ten minutes later I returned to the clearing.\n \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Not a track, not a calling card. Zip.\"\n Jessie scowled and allowed Will to sit up. Her hands fluttered over him checking for injuries.\n \"Knock it off.\" He pushed her away. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"What happened?\" she asked me.\n I hesitated. It was broad daylight. I couldn\u0027t have seen the white wolf.\n Besides, a gun had been fired. No matter how super-duper a shape-shifter this guy was, a wolf didn\u0027t have the opposable thumbs necessary to fire a weapon. Usually didn\u0027t need to, since his teeth and claws, speed and agility, were weapons enough.\n In other words, if there\u0027d been a wolf, he would have attacked, not changed into a human and shot at them. I\u0027d been seeing things again.\n \"Leigh?\" Jessie pressed. \"What, exactly, did you see?\"\n \"Nothing.\"\n \"You shouted wolf,\" Will pointed out. I glared at him and he held up his hands in surrender. \"You said it.\"\n \"Yes,\" Jessie murmured, \"you did. Was it Hector?\"\n \"Look at the sky!\" I shouted. \"Any moon? I couldn\u0027t have seen what I thought I did.\"\n I sat down in the trampled grass and dirt, then wiped my hands across my face. \"I\u0027m losing it again,\" I whispered. \"I should go back to the padded room where I belong.\"\n Jessie grabbed my upper arm. Her fingers dug into my flesh hard enough to make me wince. \"You\u0027re not crazy. He\u0027s fucking with you.\"\n \"But it\u0027s daytime.\"\n \"Everything we believe about werewolves seems to be coming apart. For all we know, a power eater can shift any damn time that it wants to.\"\n I blinked. She could be right. For some reason, the thought cheered me.\n Jessie\u0027s hold gentled. \"You saved our lives, Leigh.\"\n \"I doubt that.\"\n \"You yelled; we hit the ground; a bullet whizzed through the air where my head had been.\"\n \"Mine, too,\" Will added.\n \"I should have called out as soon as I saw the white flash behind you.\"\n Jessie released me. \"No harm, no foul.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t he come after you?\" Will asked. \"We left you by yourself back there.\"\n I shuddered at the thought of being alone in the woods with my nightmare. \"He doesn\u0027t want me dead,\" I said, \"just furry.\"\n \"There has to be a reason he let you go this time.\" Will frowned as if an idea had just occurred to him.\n \"He must be saving you for the blood moon.\"\n \"Gee, thanks, I hadn\u0027t thought of that yet.\"\n \"Sorry,\" Will muttered.\n We clambered to our feet.\n \"Guess I\u0027d better go back and finish what I didn\u0027t even start,\" I said,\n \"I think we\u0027ll go with you.\" Jessie grabbed Will\u0027s hand and tugged him into the lead.\n \"I\u0027ll be OK.\"\n \"Sure you will.\"\n Cadotte glanced over his shoulder and shrugged. I gave up and followed them to the wolf pile. In truth, I didn\u0027t want to be alone in the woods, day or night, anymore.\n Jessie and Will stopped so fast I plowed into them. \"Shit,\" she muttered.\n I went on tiptoe and peered over her shoulder. Pieces of the wolves I\u0027d left behind were all over the place.\n \"Chalk up three more for the bad guys,\" Will said.\n \"He was trying to draw me away from them, and I let him.\"\n \"He was also trying to kill us. Those bullets meant business.\"\n \"Moves awful quick, even for a wolf,\" Jessie observed.\n \"And changes quick, too. Between the time I saw a wolf, then someone shot at you, couldn\u0027t have been more than a minute.\"\n \"Could have been two of them again.\"\n She was right. Most likely the white wolf drew me away from the kill, then circled back. Someone, or something else, had shot at Jessie and Will.\n \"Let\u0027s burn what\u0027s left and get the hell out of here,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m with you.\"\n Pulling the body parts back into a pile was one of the least pleasant experiences of my life. Thankfully, I had help doing it. By unspoken agreement, Will did the physical labor along with me while Jessie stood guard. We\u0027d been surprised once. None of us planned to be surprised again.\n I had just dumped more accelerant on the pyre and thrown on a match when Will exclaimed, \"Oh, my God!\"\n I spun, gun already in my hand, but nothing was in the clearing save the three of us and what was left of the dead wolves.\n Will ran across the damp, trampled grass toward Jessie. She scowled at him. \"What is your problem?\"\n He ignored her question, grabbing her by the shoulder and yanking her around. A bright red splotch of blood marred the back of Jessie\u0027s uniform shirt. Since she hadn\u0027t touched a single wolf body part, this concerned me.\n \"You\u0027re hit.\" He turned her to face him and tried to unbutton her blouse.\n \"Get a grip, Slick.\" She smacked his hands away. \"Not now.\"\n \"Let me see.\" He tried to undress her again.\n \"A scratch. Forget about it.\"\n My heart thundered; my mouth was dry. She\u0027d been wounded because of me. I\u0027d worried that Will would be hurt, maybe killed, and Jessie would be unable to cope. In reality, it was the other way around.\n The anguish on Will\u0027s face, the blood on Jessie\u0027s clothes... I was having a hard time thinking straight. I had to get them out of the line of fire.\n \"Take her to town and clean her up,\" I ordered.\n Jessie threw me an annoyed glare. \"Who put you in charge?\"\n \"Edward.\"\n \"This is my town. I\u0027m not going anywhere until we\u0027re done here.\"\n \"You\u0027re done.\"\n She stepped forward until we were toe-to-toe. Since she had a good six inches on me, I had to crane my neck to meet her gaze. This made some of my authority go straight down the toilet.\n \"I\u0027m done when I say I\u0027m done.\"\n I quivered with rage - at the one who had hurt her, at myself for getting them into this, at Jessie for being so damned stubborn.\n All of a sudden the tension drained out of her and she glanced at Cadotte. \"Watch the fire while I talk to Leigh.\"\n He hesitated, then nodded and moved off. Jessie turned to me.\n \"I can handle this myself,\" I began.\n She snorted. \"Right. You need us. We need you. Get used to it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll call Edward. He\u0027ll come back.\"\n All I had to do was tell him that Hector was here, he\u0027d be on the next plane. Up until now I\u0027d avoided that conversation. Edward had saved me once. This time I wanted to save myself. But not at the cost of Jessie and Will.\n \"You\u0027ll call Edward and tell him what? That I\u0027m incompetent? That Will\u0027s a pansy?\"\n I frowned. \"No...\"\n \"I chose this. So did Will. We knew the risks.\"\n Did they? I had a hard time believing that. If they knew their chances of surviving this job were forty to two, would they stay? Maybe I should tell them.\n \"You have each other. What do you need a dangerous job for? What if - ?\"\n \"We die? I\u0027ve asked myself that question a hundred times. I could get hit by a truck tomorrow. Will could get shot by an overeager redneck today. That\u0027s life, Leigh. At least we\u0027re trying to save the world before we go.\"\n A crusader. Who\u0027d have thunk it?\n \"It\u0027s not like we plan on dying,\" she continued. \"I did kill the wolf god - all by myself.\" I lifted a brow.\n \"Kind of.\"\n \"Hector is bad news.\" I looked around the bloody clearing. \"And getting badder.\"\n \"Oooh, I\u0027m all a-shiver.\"\n I started to think ahead. I\u0027d go out hunting alone. Ditch them whenever I could. Maybe I could end this without ending them.\n \"I\u0027m gonna stick to you like glue,\" Jessie murmured.\n My eyes went to hers like a magnet drawn to metal. Amusement lightened her face, but her voice was stone-cold serious.\n \"You\u0027re not running around like Dirty Harry. We\u0027re together now. All for one, one for all.\"\n \"Mix metaphors much?\"\n \"Bite me.\"\n \"If Hector gets to me first, I just might.\"\n Jessie glanced over her shoulder at Will, who was still amusing himself with the bonfire. \"Remember what you promised me and I promised you?\" she whispered.\n How could I forget a promise like that? I nodded.\n \"We\u0027re partners now.\"\n I scowled. I\u0027d never had one of those, and I wasn\u0027t sure what to do. Hug her? Shake her hand? Knock her out, tie her up, and keep her somewhere until the danger was over?\n \"I\u0027ve never had a friend like you before,\" she admitted.\n Aw, hell. Now I couldn\u0027t tie her up.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-25.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) \n eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
