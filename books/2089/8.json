{"id":89726,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Someone was banging on the door and shouting my name. I glanced at my travel alarm.\\n\\n Noon. I\u0027d overslept.\\n\\n I dragged myself out of bed, across the floor, glanced out the window, and flicked the lock. Jessie barreled inside.\\n\\n \"I woke you,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What was your first clue?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, your lovely naked ass?\"\\n\\n I glanced down. Oops. Must have stripped completely instead of leaving on my underwear as I usually did in a strange new place.\\n\\n Since I didn\u0027t have a home of my own, all places were strange, and since I traveled with the wolves, most places were new. Naked sleeping didn\u0027t happen very often. About as often as I had sex. Let\u0027s see, that would be once in every millennium.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t frigid - much. I just had a little problem with intimacy, among other things. Maybe because the last time I\u0027d had sex it had led to murder.\\n\\n Another bright and cheery thought to greet the day. No wonder I hated mornings.\\n\\n I headed for the coffeepot without stopping for clothes. I could care less who saw me naked. If they didn\u0027t like the view they could get the hell out of my way.\\n\\n Considering my notions on sex and men, I suppose my ease with nudity was contradictory. However, if you didn\u0027t think of your body as a sexual object, what was the big deal with everyone seeing it?\\n\\n \"You plan on getting dressed anytime soon?\" Jessie asked, staring pointedly out the window.\\n\\n I smirked. At last I\u0027d rattled her cage. \"You shy?\"\\n\\n \"I can see you\u0027re not.\"\\n\\n Once I had been. Once I\u0027d been a lot of things. I was none of them any longer.\\n\\n I cursed as I opened and shut all the cabinets and the tiny refrigerator. \"No coffee. Someone must die.\"\\n\\n \"When Mandenauer said you weren\u0027t a morning person, I figured you\u0027d be OK after noon.\"\\n\\n \"You figured wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you go shopping last night? Get supplies?\"\\n\\n I froze. Last night came back to me in a rush. I\u0027d planned to sleep a few hours, then go back out and burn the evidence. Instead I\u0027d slept for too long and left the dead wolves in the forest.\\n\\n I was slipping.\\n\\n I found my underwear tangled in the sheets, stuffed my legs into my discarded jeans, and picked up the same T-shirt I\u0027d worn yesterday. I rarely bothered with a bra. Didn\u0027t need one. Never had.\\n\\n \"Ahem.\"\\n\\n I glanced at Jessie.\\n\\n \"Maybe you want to put on some clean clothes?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with th - \" I looked down, and the words died on my tongue.\\n\\n My pants sported streaks that could be rust paint but we both knew weren\u0027t. My once-white T-shirt was full of soot, dirt, and more red streaks. I was lucky no one had seen me coming out of the woods last night. They might have thought I was burying a body.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t listen very well, do you?\"\\n\\n I shrugged and yanked off the shirt, replacing it with one from my bag. I left the jeans alone. I\u0027d change them after we got back. They were only going to get dirtier anyway.\\n\\n \"How many did you kill?\"\\n\\n \"Nine,\" I lied, not wanting to mention the brown wolf, which I hadn\u0027t killed. I was supposed to be training Jessie, not teaching her bad habits.\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"Nine? You\u0027re kidding.\"\\n\\n \"Unlike you, I\u0027m not much of a yuckster.\" I stuffed my gun in my pants, adjusted the shirt over top of it, and headed for the door. \"Come on.\"\\n\\n \"Where are we going?\"\\n\\n \"To burn a few bodies.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t burn them?\"\\n\\n I winced. \"Could you be a little louder? I don\u0027t think people in Toronto heard you.\"\\n\\n \"Mandenauer said we should always burn them immediately.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Mandenauer doesn\u0027t know every damn thing.\"\\n\\n \"Could have fooled me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I can.\"\\n\\n I opened the door and ran straight into the hard wall of Damien Fitzgerald\u0027s chest.\\n\\n \"Umph,\" I said, and would have fallen on my ass if he hadn\u0027t caught me by the forearms.\\n\\n \"Hey. Sorry. You all right?\"\\n\\n His hands were rough, hard, as if he\u0027d done a lot of manual labor recently - hacked up his fingers, worked calluses into his palms. You didn\u0027t get hands like that pouring drinks. You didn\u0027t get them from lifting weights, either.\\n\\n Why I found his scarred hands so fascinating - hell, I\u0027ll admit it: I found them downright stimulating - I had no idea. It was all I could do not to lose myself in a fantasy of him running those hands over every inch of my naked skin.\\n\\n He was dressed in black again. Loose cotton trousers, what appeared to be black Nikes - I didn\u0027t know they made those - and another long-sleeved black shirt. This one had a pattern embedded in the material, the only way I could tell it wasn\u0027t the same one he\u0027d worn yesterday. Except he\u0027d managed to button it. I kind of missed the smooth white flash of his skin against the silk.\\n\\n \"Who the hell are you, mister?\"\\n\\n His green-brown eyes flicked to Jessie. He let me go as if I had lice.\\n\\n \"Sheriff.\" He nodded.\\n\\n \"Do I know you?\"\\n\\n \"This is Damien Fitzgerald,\" I said. \"He bartends downstairs.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" she drawled. \"And what else does he do?\"\\n\\n I remembered that I\u0027d told her about him and that she\u0027d thought he was a fanged and furry charter member. I turned just as she reached for her gun.\\n\\n \"No!\" I said, too loudly. \"I mean...\"\\n\\n I grabbed Damien\u0027s wrist. He started at the contact and tried to pull away, but I held on. \"What a gorgeous ring. See his pretty silver ring, Jessie?\"\\n\\n She frowned, and her hand fell away from her service revolver. She crossed the room and peered at Damien\u0027s hand. \"Hmm,\" she muttered.\\n\\n Damien tugged again, and when I released him he shoved his fingers into his back pocket as if to keep us from looking at his jewelry any closer.\\n\\n What did he have to hide? And why was I so suspicious of everyone?\\n\\n Because I had good reason to be.\\n\\n \"I brought you some coffee.\" He plucked a to-go cup from the porch railing.\\n\\n I managed to refrain from declaring my everlasting love. The steam rising from the Styrofoam container smelled almost as good as he did. I wondered what kind of soap he used - something that smelled both green and blue, a little bit of moss with a crust of ice on top.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get shot for it, though.\" Damien\u0027s gaze returned to Jessie.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind her. She\u0027s jumpy.\"\\n\\n \"I never would have guessed. Something going on in Crow Valley I should know about, Sheriff?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\" Jessie continued to watch him as if she expected Damien to shape-shift at any moment, regardless of the ring and the sun blazing down on his tousled head.\\n\\n \"Thanks for the coffee,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Anytime. There\u0027s usually a pot on downstairs. Help yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go, Leigh.\"\\n\\n Jessie was impatient. I couldn\u0027t blame her. I was getting a little nervous myself at the thought of all those dead wolves in the forest. They were miles from here, pretty deep in, but that didn\u0027t mean someone couldn\u0027t stumble across them. I didn\u0027t have time for the explanations that would require.\\n\\n \"Where are you guys going?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it to you?\" Jessie demanded.\\n\\n Man, I was a social savant compared to her.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got work to do,\" I said as I brushed past him.\\n\\n \"Was there something else you wanted, Fitzgerald?\" Jessie joined us on the landing.\\n\\n \"I - \" He glanced at me. \"I wanted to make sure you were getting along all right.\"\\n\\n I got the impression he\u0027d been about to say something else, though what I had no idea. But Jessie, with what I was coining to see as her usual bull in the china shop manner, hurried on.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s fine. Just very late. OK?\"\\n\\n She ran down the steps, then stood at the bottom, foot impatiently tapping.\\n\\n I glanced at Damien and rolled my eyes. \"Gotta go.\"\\n\\n His lips twitched - almost a smile but not quite. \"Be careful out there.\"\\n\\n A warning or a joke? Why would I need to be careful in the woods, in the daytime, with the sheriff and our guns? Did Damien know something I didn\u0027t?\\n\\n I was reaching for my rifle when he touched my elbow. I started. And I\u0027d said Jessie was jumpy.\\n\\n As I lifted my gaze to his, something passed between us, something that tugged low and deep. I liked the heat of his palm against my skin, the rasp of his rough fingers, the tickle of his breath across the stubble that was my hair.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t remember the last time I\u0027d wanted to press my body against someone, slip my hands beneath his shirt, press my mouth to the pulse in his throat, and suckle.\\n\\n I jerked back, rubbed at the place where my skin was still warm from his. Damien\u0027s smile was sad.\\n\\n \"Bye,\" he murmured.\\n\\n I joined Jessie and we headed for the woods. I could feel Damien watching us, and though I tried not to look back, I couldn\u0027t help myself.\\n\\n He stood at the top of the steps in front of my door. I hadn\u0027t locked it. Not that it would do any good against him. He had a key. I made a quick mental tally of what I\u0027d left inside.\\n\\n Shotgun. Nothing unusual there, except for the silver shells. Since I possessed specially made J-S ammo, they appeared normal, just like my rifle.\\n\\n My bag contained only clothes, a few uniforms, jeans, et cetera. I rarely wore the DNR uniform. It only raised more questions. Especially if I ran into a real DNR guy. Though Edward usually made sure any area where we were working undercover was cleared of such pesky troubles as the truth.\\n\\n I carried ID in my pocket, which would only prove what I\u0027d already lied about. My computer was the best government money could buy and unhackable, as far as I knew.\\n\\n Nope, nothing incriminating in my room. That I worried about such things, that I suspected Damien of searching my space, only proved how far gone I was in my paranoia. Sadly, paranoia was what had kept me alive so far.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something weird about him,\" Jessie said.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something weird about you, but I\u0027m too nice to mention it.\"\\n\\n \"Har-har. And you say you aren\u0027t a yuckster.\"\\n\\n I almost smiled but caught myself. I was beginning to like bantering with her, and that wasn\u0027t a good idea.\\n\\n She was new, naive, untrained. She would probably be wolf bait by next month. It had happened a hundred times before.\\n\\n I wondered if Edward had told Jessie the statistics on agent survival. About twenty to one, where twenty wasn\u0027t the amount who lived.\\n\\n \"What do you see in him anyway?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Fitzgerald. He\u0027s too stringy, too short, too pale. And what\u0027s with that ring?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Silver filigree? Could he be more gay?\"\\n\\n \"This from a woman whose boyfriend wears an earring.\"\\n\\n \"I like that earring. I was not a happy camper when one of the bad guys tore it out in Miniwa.\"\\n\\n I winced. I\u0027d stopped wearing earrings when I\u0027d chopped off my hair for just that reason.\\n\\n \"When Will\u0027s ear healed, he got it repierced, and I haven\u0027t been sorry. That earring feels pretty good when it\u0027s trailing over my - \"\\n\\n \"Too much information!\" I shouted, and clapped my hands over my ears.\\n\\n She laughed. \"OK. Never mind. Fitzgerald isn\u0027t bad. For an Irishman.\"\\n\\n \"What have you got against Irishmen?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Except my father was one.\" Her laughter faded.\\n\\n Huh, Sheriff Laugh-a-Minute had an Achilles\u0027 heel and his name was McQuade. Well, none of my business. I certainly didn\u0027t want to hear all her troubles and hold her hand while she cried.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll run him through the system,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Your father?\"\\n\\n She blinked, then glanced at me as if I\u0027d said something interesting. Then she shook her head. \"No.\\n\\n Fitzgerald.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t do anything.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t mean he won\u0027t. Or that he hasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t checking someone out just because you feel like it called harassment?\"\\n\\n \"I call it fun.\"\\n\\n \"You would.\"\\n\\n We continued to tramp through the woods for several more minutes before Jessie growled, \"Where the hell were you when you shot these things? Arabia?\"\\n\\n \"Almost there,\" I said.\\n\\n But I\u0027d been running last night, faster and farther than I thought, because it took us another half an hour to find the wolves.\\n\\n Or what was left of them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-8.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) \\n eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
