{"id":89753,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"I\u0027ve got to go,\" I said. I took one step toward the door and fell to my knees as the room became a forest again. Damp earth seeped through my pants legs, chilling my skin. The air was musty. I smelled moss. In the distance a wolf howled. I lifted my mouth to call out... And ended up coughing, choking, in Damien\u0027s arms. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going anywhere.\" \"Stop me.\" \"No problem.\" He scooped me up again and took me into the bathroom, where he dumped me onto the toilet seat. \"I\u0027m cleaning that wound, and I\u0027m calling a doctor.\" \"Damien, it won\u0027t do any good. You and I both know that.\" He hung his head. \"Just let me clean it then. OK?\" \"If I do, will you let me find Jessie?\" \"No. But I will.\" I glanced into his eyes. This was the best deal I was going to get. I yanked the pillowcase bandage off my arm. \"Knock yourself out.\" His smile was the same smile I\u0027d come to love. Sweet, sad, infinitely beautiful. I was going to miss him. My arm was bloody and gaping, made me nauseous just to look at it. I turned away, and he dampened a cloth and began to wash away the gore. After a few minutes Damien made an impatient sound. \"This isn\u0027t going to do any good, Leigh. It just keeps bleeding.\" I resisted the urge to say, Told you so. \"Bandage me up again.\" \"You need stitches.\" \"Stitch me.\" \"I\u0027ll make a mess, a scar.\" I lifted a brow. \"A scar? Oh, no. I shiver. I shudder. That would be such a shame.\" He ran a hand over his face, leaving a trail of my blood across his cheek. \"Forget it,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not going to make a difference in another day anyway.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" He straightened. \"You\u0027ll heal.\" I wouldn\u0027t. But once again, he didn\u0027t need to know that. \"Which reminds me, why doesn\u0027t Hector\u0027s tattoo heal?\" \"He has a tattoo? Like Cowboy?\" \"Obviously, since they\u0027re the same person.\" \"Which makes no sense.\" \"You\u0027d be surprised.\" I didn\u0027t have the energy or the time to explain super-duper shape-shifting powers, even if I could. \"But the wolf morphing into the crow made no sense, either,\" he murmured. \"Getting back to the tattoo?\" I reminded him as he used a towel to bind my arm. \"What? Oh. That\u0027s easy. You stay the way you were when you were made a wolf. If... Was it Hector?\" I nodded. \"If he had a tattoo when he became a werewolf, he\u0027ll have one forever. Any injury after that will heal.\" Damien pointed to his thigh and I remembered the thin white scar that marred his nearly perfect flesh. \"I got that as a kid. It\u0027ll never go away.\" This was all news to me. Why didn\u0027t we know this in the J-S society? Because we didn\u0027t stop to ask questions before we shot them, and maybe that wasn\u0027t so bright. \"But what about this?\" I lifted my bandaged arm. \"Happened before I became a werewolf.\" \"The wound that infected you with the virus will heal.\" \"Convenient.\" \"Can you imagine people walking around with their throats ripped out? It isn\u0027t pretty.\" I\u0027d wondered when I first became a Jager-Sucher how people with kill wounds could heal. There was a simple, disgusting explanation. People were food. If a werewolf ate you, you died. If he nibbled but didn\u0027t snack, you got to be one of them. \"What about diseases?\" I pressed. \"They\u0027ll heal, because you still have them after you\u0027re a werewolf. At least until you shift the first time.\" \"But not scars?\" \"Sorry, Leigh.\" He thought I was worried about my back. I hadn\u0027t even considered it. Guess I got to keep the scar. Oh, boy. \"Who is Hector?\" he asked. \"Cowboy.\" \"No, who is he to you?\" I lifted my eyes. Sympathy shone in his, caring, under-standing, love. How could he love me? Because he didn\u0027t know. \"I had sex with him,\" I blurted. \"I saw him, wanted him, took him. Then he sacrificed everyone I loved so he could become like you.\" Damien frowned. I waited for the recriminations, the disgust. Instead he murmured, \"Interesting.\" \"Interesting? Is that all you can say?\" \"I didn\u0027t know someone could become a werewolf without being bitten.\" \"You\u0027d be surprised what you don\u0027t know.\" The door to my apartment banged open. Jessie and Will spilled into the room, Jessie shouting my name and cursing. I was so damn glad to see them alive, I didn\u0027t hear what they were saying. I got off the toilet and inched past Damien. As I went by, his palm slid along my good arm in a gentle, reassuring touch. My fingers clung to his for just an instant and it was good. \"I\u0027m here,\" I said. They both went silent as if I\u0027d thrown a switch, staring at me as if I were a ghost. \"Thank God,\" she breathed. \"I thought we were too late.\" \"Too late for what?\" \"We talked to Cora. He has to - \" \"Make me a werewolf before the full moon.\" Jessie shut her mouth, tilted her head. \"How did you know that?\" \"He told me.\" I lifted my bandaged arm. She drew her gun and pointed it at my head. I smiled. \"I knew you were the best friend I ever had.\" Damien barreled out of the bathroom and shoved me behind him. My hero. \"What the hell?\" he asked. \"Get lost,\" Jessie snapped. \"I don\u0027t think I will. This is murder, Sheriff.\" \"It\u0027s none of your business, Fitzgerald. Get out of my way.\" \"Jess.\" Will spoke for the first time. \"Maybe you should call in before you make any rash decisions.\" Indecision flickered over her face. \"You can always shoot her after she grows a tail,\" Damien murmured. I kicked him in the leg. He ignored me. \"You told him?\" Jessie demanded. I shrugged and didn\u0027t answer. \"Jeez, Leigh, he\u0027s a civilian.\" \"So was Cadotte, once upon a time.\" \"Got you there,\" Will said. \"Shut up.\" Jessie\u0027s answer to everything. She still pointed her gun at Damien. I didn\u0027t like it. She had silver in that gun. I tried to slide around him, but he shoved me right back. \"Without her, he can\u0027t become the supreme alpha,\" Jessie argued. \"Wolves mate for life.\" \"What does that have to do with anything?\" Damien asked. \"Thought you knew it all.\" \"I know werewolves exist. I haven\u0027t gotten the details on what you\u0027re up against.\" Will filled him in as I fought a sudden craving for raw steak. \"It seems to me,\" Damien murmured, \"that you have Hector at a disadvantage.\" \"How so?\" Jessie asked. \"Leigh can get close to him. He\u0027ll trust her.\" Jessie and Will both turned to me. \"He\u0027s right.\" Jessie holstered her gun. \"I guess I can always shoot you later.\" \"Yeah, look at the bright side.\" I pushed past Damien and moved farther into the room. \"Hector plans to use Damien for his sacrifice.\" Damien frowned, blinked, then shrugged. \"Let him try.\" \"You need to protect him, Jessie.\" \"I don\u0027t need anyone to protect me,\" Damien protested. \"I can take care of myself.\" Jessie ignored him. \"We could always shoot him before they kill him.\" \"Would you quit with the shooting?\" I said. \"Sacrifice is sacrifice. He doesn\u0027t necessarily need Damien. He just wants him.\" \"Because?\" \"He touched me.\" Jessie glanced at Damien. \"She\u0027s worth it,\" he said. Her gaze went shrewd, and she turned her attention to me with a lift of her brow. I shook my head. I wasn\u0027t going to discuss my feelings for Damien. Not now. F\u0027robably not ever. \"Hector told me you and Will wouldn\u0027t make it back from Cora\u0027s.\" \"We almost didn\u0027t,\" Will muttered. \"What happened?\" \"My car is kind of like yours now.\" \"They attacked.\" \"When we were halfway between Cora\u0027s and home. Thankfully Jessie brought a lot of guns and even more ammo.\" She patted her Magnum. \"Pays to be prepared.\" \"A regular Boy Scout,\" I agreed. \"We left quite a few dead ones behind.\" \"You didn\u0027t burn them?\" \"We didn\u0027t want to get out of the car. There were more waiting.\" I nodded. \"Did you happen to see a crow?\" Will frowned. \"It settled on the kills. Started pecking. Scavenger.\" \"That was Hector.\" Jessie and Will exchanged glances. \"You\u0027d better tell us everything,\" he urged. When I was through, Will murmured, \"Not good.\" He spread his hands. \"But hey, if this job were easy, everyone would do it.\" That startled a laugh out of me. \"Mandenauer?\" My head whipped around. Jessie held the cell phone to her ear. \"You\u0027d better get to Crow Valley. Leigh\u0027s been bitten.\" She listened for an instant, then hung up. \"Dammit, Jessie, you\u0027ll only upset him. What can he do?\" \"I guess we\u0027re gonna find out. Because he\u0027s on his way, and he\u0027s bringing Dr. Hanover.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-35.html","bookId":2089,"book":{"id":2089,"title":"Night Creature: Hunter\u0027s Moon (Nightcreature #2)","description":"Storyline: Hunter\u0027s Moon(Night Creature series book 2) eigh Tyler was once a kindergarten teacher with starry-eyed dreams-dreams that turned into nightmares when the biggest mistake she ever made came back to tear her world apart.
