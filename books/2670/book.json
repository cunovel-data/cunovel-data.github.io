An impossible choice: Malcolm offers Judith a chance to escape her predicament…But can she risk entangling her own personal white knight in a dangerous web of royal intrigue?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-lily-on-the-heath-medieval-herb-garden-4.jpg","author":"Colleen Gleason","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":52,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
