{"id":32733,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"BIRTH OF JOSEPH—FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES—TOIL AND POVERTY—REMOVAL TO NEW YORK—INTENSE RELIGIOUS EXCITEMENT. The circumstances and surroundings of the elder Joseph were of the humblest, when unto his house was born, on the 23rd of December, 1805, Joseph, the Prophet of the Last Dispensation. The family were still living in the little town of Sharon, in Windsor County, Vermont; and were, at the time, greatly impoverished. Very early, therefore, was the future Prophet compelled to learn the lessons of labor, patience and self-denial. The father was striving, with every faculty, to repair his shattered fortunes, that he might educate his children and provide for their comfort and well-being; but successive disasters consumed his little savings. After a time, he removed from Sharon, and later, in 1815, left the State of Vermont, locating at Palmyra, Ontario County, New York: in which place and the adjoining town of Manchester, whither the family moved four years afterward, they dwelt for several years. Here they engaged in clearing land and farming, the boys, including the young Joseph, giving their constant aid to the family work. With the severest toil they could only compass a frugal mode of life. But they wasted no time in useless repining. They were able to pay their obligations, to maintain their honest name, to live in happiness, and to devote some hours of each week to the rudimentary education of the younger children. The offspring of Joseph and Lucy Smith, with the dates and places of their birth, are named as follow:[1] Alvin, born February 11th, 1798, at Tunbridge, Vermont. Hyrum, born February 9th, 1800, at Tunbridge, Vermont. Sophronia, born May 18th, 1803, at Tunbridge, Vermont. Joseph, born December 23rd, 1805, at Sharon, Vermont. Samuel, born March 13th, 1808, at Tunbridge, Vermont. Ephraim, born March 13th, 1810, at Royalton, Vermont. William, born March 13th, 1811, at Royalton, Vermont. Catherine, born July 8th, 1812, at Lebanon, New Hampshire. Don Carlos, born March 25th, 1816, probably at Palmyra, New York. Lucy, born July 18th, 1821, probably at Palmyra, New York. The first quarter of the nineteenth century was a time of intense religious excitement, and New York and surrounding states were the scenes of many revivals and much strife. Not only among preachers and exhorters was the enthusiasm manifested, but the people themselves became much exercised over their sinful condition, and ran here and there in a wild search for the salvation for which their souls seemed to yearn. The movement originated with the Methodists; but it soon spread to other sects in the neighborhood, until the whole region was infected by it, and the greatest excitement was created, in which all the good effects of a revival were swallowed up in bitter contests of opinions and the strife of words between the adherents of the various creeds. The Smith family inclined towards the Presbyterian faith, and the mother, two sons and a daughter united themselves with that church. Joseph was at the time in his fifteenth year—just at an age, with his limited experience, he might be deemed most susceptible to the example of others. He listened and considered, yet could not profess the faith of his family. The clergymen of other sects assailed him; but although he became somewhat partial to the Methodist creed, their soft words and direful threats were alike unavailing. The tempest could not reach the depths of the boy\u0027s nature. Unknown to himself he was awaiting the hour when the divine message should stir the waters of his soul. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3320/90915.html","bookId":395,"book":{"id":395,"title":"The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet","description":"简介： Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak.
