{"id":32752,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXI.","content":"DEPARTURE OF THE PROPHET FROM HIRAM FOR THE CONSECRATED LAND IN MISSOURI—ACCEPTED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD—RETURNING FROM ZION, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO POISON HIM—SAVED UNDER BISHOP WHITNEY\u0027S ADMINISTRATION. On the 2nd day of April, 1832, Joseph started from Hiram for Missouri. He was carried by Elder George Pitkin in the latter\u0027s wagon to Stubenville, whence the Prophet and Sidney, who had joined him in the meantime, took passage on Wednesday, the 5th of April, 1832, on board a steamboat for Wheeling, then in the state of Virginia. After departing from Hiram, Joseph directed his wife to go to Kirtland and await his return; and this she did, finding help and consolation with his friends. From Wheeling he soon resumed his journey towards Zion, and reached there on the 24th day of April, 1832. Two days later, in a solemn assemblage of the Church, Joseph was sustained as President of the High Priesthood. Bishop Edward Partridge extended the right hand of fellowship and recognition to Joseph in the office to which he had been elected, and the Saints ratified the deed in an impressive and unanimous manner. The Prophet found the Saints in Zion surrounded by people filled with the spirit of murder and rapine, and he sought with all the vigor and faith of his soul to unite the people in the bonds of love and mutual trust and help, that thus they might be enabled to withstand the assaults of their enemies. It was characteristic of him and of the revealed work, that he should teach his brethren at this hour, as always before and always after until the hour of his death, the potency of union. His purpose was then, as ever, to show the Saints the strength of a passive defense, coupled with kindness toward all humanity. Joseph had the personal strength and courage which, when not controlled by some mighty influence, make a man ambitious to overcome and punish any cruel foe by the arm of flesh, and yet in all his sufferings and ministrations he never advised or permitted any aggression upon the law or any insult to rightful authority. The Prophet visited the Saints in Kaw Township and was received with delight. The people there loved him and rejoiced in his presence and in his teachings. On the 1st day of May, 1832, the council of the Elders was continued at Independence, and the order was made that three thousand copies of the \"Book of Commandments\" should be printed. Five days later, Joseph departed from Independence for Kirtland in company with Sidney Rigdon and Newel K. Whitney. On their return, Bishop Whitney, while attempting to jump from the coach as the horses were running away, had his leg and foot broken in several places. Joseph had succeeded in getting out unhurt, and he took the Bishop to a public house at Greenville, Indiana, remaining with him there while Sidney went forward to Kirtland. Four weeks elapsed and still Newel was unable to proceed. Several times during that period, when the Prophet walked out into the adjoining woods he saw newly made graves; and one day at dinner he was seized with a spasm caused by poison which had been administered to him in his food with murderous intent. He rushed to the door and quantities of blood and poisonous matter gushed from his mouth. The muscular contortion induced by the agony was so great that his jaw was dislocated. When the convulsion had partially passed, he wrenched his jaw back to its place with his own hands, and made his way to the couch of Bishop Whitney as speedily as possible. The Bishop administered to him, and he was healed instantly, although the poison had been so quick and strong in its effect as to loosen the hair upon his head. The Prophet felt that they must flee from this spot at once, and asked his helpless brother to promise that he would be ready to start for Kirtland the next morning. Joseph declared to Bishop Whitney that if he would agree to this plan a wagon should be in waiting the next morning to transport them to the river bank, where they should find a ferry boat to take them quickly across. On the other side they should meet a carriage ready to convey them directly to the boat landing. Here a steamer should be ready to start, and at ten o\u0027clock in the morning they should be steaming up the river. When the Prophet was led to make this prediction no arrangements had been made, neither were there any afterwards made by him to carry out this programme of travel. But animated by faith, Bishop Whitney gave his promise, and Joseph remained with him all night. Early the next morning they departed, and at ten o\u0027clock, after having found the way opened, exactly as the Prophet was led to promise, they were sailing up the river, with the Bishop\u0027s limb sound enough to bear the journey without pain. It was June, 1832, when they arrived at Kirtland, where Joseph found his wife awaiting him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3320/90934.html","bookId":395,"book":{"id":395,"title":"The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet","description":"简介： Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak.
