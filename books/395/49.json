It was a sudden shifting of scenes from Missouri to Illinois in that sad springtime of 1839. An examination had been made of lands in Iowa, and tracts were eventually secured there; but the beauty of the site of Commerce and the hospitality evinced by the people of Illinois were great attractions and decided the Prophet upon making the location at that place. It was on the 1st day of May that Joseph made the first purchase of lands in that locality. The town consisted of only six houses; the land was covered with trees and brush; and the soil was so wet that teams mired in the streets. The climate was very unhealthy; but the Prophet knew that the blessing of God would make it a fit habitation for His Saints. It was a magnificent site, overlooking the Mississippi which swept around it in a half circle, giving the place three fronts upon the noble river. Because of the loveliness of the site the name of Commerce was changed to Nauvoo which means in Hebrew, the fair or beautiful. The woes of the Saints while in Missouri had been observed with an eye of pity from Illinois. Such monstrous crime against an unoffending people shocked the patriotism and humanity of all who witnessed it, and the people of Illinois wondered how the Missourians could be so lost to all sense of justice and mercy as to commit these acts of murder and pillage. Under date of May 8, 1839, Governor Thomas Garlin, Senator Richard M. Young, and many other prominent citizens of Illinois, wrote a letter to all whom it might concern, in which they spoke of \"the sufferings of this unfortunate people [the Saints], stripped as they have been of their all, and now scattered throughout this part of the state. We say to the charitable and benevolent, you need have no fear, but your contributions in aid of humanity will be properly applied if entrusted to the hands of Mr. [John P.] Greene. He is authorized by his church to act in the premises; and we most cordially bear testimony to his piety and worth as a citizen.\" It was on the 10th day of May that Joseph arrived with his family at the Commerce purchase, taking up his abode in a small log cabin on the bank of the river, thankful to get even this poor shelter. Joseph had been as much a sufferer as any among the Saints. He and his family were in a state of utter destitution as were his brethren and sisters when the location was made at Nauvoo. His own afflictions and poverty showed him what the Saints were enduring, and he ministered among them with the unselfishness and vigor of his life. The people looked to him for counsel and help from day to day; and he found time, in all the multiplicity of the business thrust upon him, to aid and advise each individual according to his needs. It was almost a work of creation from chaos to gather the scattered people and establish the community in one spot, to feed and clothe and house the destitute and afflicted. The region surrounding Nauvoo had been too sickly for other settlers, and soon after the Saints reached there they suffered greatly from malaria. Joseph had filled his house and tents with the sick, and through his exertions in their behalf and his other labors he was soon prostrated. But on the morning of the 22nd day of July, 1839, the Spirit of the Lord rested powerfully upon him, and he arose from his own bed and commenced to administer to the sick who were at his place. He commanded them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to arise and be made whole; and all who heard him in faith were healed. The events of that day of miracles are thus minutely described in the journal of President Wilford Woodruff, which was written at the time: Many lay sick along the bank of the river, and Joseph walked along up to the lower stone house, occupied by Sidney Rigdon, and he healed all the sick that lay in his path. Among the number was Henry G. Sherwood, who was nigh unto death. Joseph stood in the mouth of his tent and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and come out of his tent, and he obeyed him and was healed. Brother Benjamin Brown and his family also lay sick, the former appearing to be in a dying condition. Joseph healed them in the name of the Lord. After healing all that lay sick upon the bank of the river as far as the stone house, he called upon Elder Kimball and some others to accompany him across the river to visit the sick at Montrose. Many of the Saints were living at the old military barracks. Among the number were several of the Twelve. On his arrival, the first house he visited was that occupied by Elder Brigham Young, the President of the quorum of the Twelve, who lay sick. Joseph healed him, when he arose and accompanied the Prophet on his visit to others who were in the same condition. They visited Elder W. Woodruff, also Elders Orson Pratt and John Taylor, all of whom were living in Montrose. They also accompanied him. The next place they visited was the home of Elijah Fordham, who was supposed to be about breathing his last. When the company entered the room the Prophet of God walked up to the dying man, and took hold of his right hand and spoke to him; but Brother Fordham was unable to speak, his eyes were set in his head like glass, and he seemed entirely unconscious of all around him. Joseph held his hand and looked into his eyes in silence for a length of time. A change in the countenance of Brother Fordham was soon perceptible to all present. His sight returned, and upon Joseph asking him if he knew him, he, in a low whisper, answered \"Yes.\" Joseph asked him if he had faith to be healed. He answered, \"I fear it is too late; if you had come sooner I think I could have been healed.\" The Prophet said, \"Do you not believe in Jesus Christ?\" He answered in a feeble voice, \"I do.\" Joseph then stood erect, still holding his hand in silence several moments, then he spoke in a very loud voice, saying, \"Brother Fordham, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from this bed and be made whole.\" His voice was like the voice of God, and not of man. It seemed as though the house shook to its very foundation. Brother Fordham arose from his bed and was immediately made whole. His feet were bound in poultices, which he kicked off, then putting on his clothes he ate a bowl of bread and milk and followed the Prophet into the street. The company next visited Brother Joseph Bates Noble, who lay very sick. He also was healed by the Prophet. By this time the wicked became alarmed, and followed the company into Brother Noble\u0027s house. After Brother Noble was healed all kneeled down to pray. Brother Fordham was mouth, and, while praying, he fell to the floor. The Prophet arose, and looking round, he saw quite a number of unbelievers in the house, whom he ordered out. When the room was cleared of them Brother Fordham came to and finished his prayer. After healing the sick in Montrose, all the company followed Joseph to the bank of the river, where he was going to take the boat to return home. While waiting for the boat a man from the west, who had seen that the sick and dying were healed, asked Joseph if he would not go to his house and heal two of his children, who were very sick. They were twins and were three months old. Joseph told the man he could not go; but he would send some one to heal them. He told Elder Woodruff to go with the man and heal his children. At the same time he took from his pocket a silk bandanna handkerchief, and gave it to Brother Woodruff, telling him to wipe the faces of the children with it and they should be healed; and remarked at the same time: \"As long as you keep that handkerchief it shall remain a league between you and me.\" Elder Woodruff did as he was commanded, and the children were healed, and he keeps the handkerchief to this day. There were many sick whom Joseph could not visit, so be counseled the Twelve to go and visit and heal them, and many were healed under their hands. On the day following that upon which the above described events took place Joseph sent Elders George A. and Don Carlos Smith up the river to heal the sick. They went up as far as Ebenezer Robinson\u0027s—one or two miles, and did as they were commanded, and the sick were healed. With the summer the building of the city was begun; also settlements were established across the river in Iowa. Joseph bestowed constant attention upon the spiritual as well as the temporal interests of the people. He gave them many important points of doctrine at this time; and he labored as a missionary among both Saints and strangers throughout the regions surrounding. His efforts and those of his brethren, the Apostles, in preaching the gospel bore rich fruit. There were many sincere people who were seeking for light and these soon joined the ranks of the believers. The material welfare of the Saints increased marvelously, the marshy wilderness on the Mississippi banks soon grew to be a solid resting place for their weary feet. The Twelve, on whom the burden of the exodus from Missouri had fallen, were now preparing for their mission to England; but before they went Joseph uttered the warning sound which was to penetrate to the ends of the earth: The signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall soon see war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls are not looking forth for Him, we shall be among those to call for the rocks to fall upon us. * * * * * * * I see men hunting the lives of their own sons, and brother murdering brother, women killing their own daughters, and daughters seeking the lives of their mothers. I see armies arrayed against armies. I see blood, fire, desolation. Jesus has said that the mother shall be against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother. These things are at our doors. They will follow the Saints of God from city to city. * * * I know not how soon these things will take place; and after a view of them, shall I cry peace? No! I will lift up my voice and testify of them. The Apostles shared in his zeal. About the 1st of July, 1839, six of them, all who were then at that point—Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor and George A. Smith, addressed a communication to the Elders of the Church, to all the branches, and to all the Saints scattered abroad wherever they might be. Their epistle was so pleasing to the Prophet that he embodied it in his personal journal, and from it the following sentiments are selected: Many of you have been driven from your homes, robbed of your possessions, and deprived of the liberty of conscience. You have been stripped of your clothing, plundered of your furniture, robbed of your horses, your cattle, your sheep, your hogs, and refused the protection of law; you have been subject to insult and abuse, from a set of lawless miscreants; you have had to endure cold, nakedness, peril and sword; your wives and your children have been deprived of the comforts of life; you have been subject to bonds, to imprisonment, to banishment, and many to death, \"for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God.\" Many of your brethren, with those whose souls are now beneath the altars, are crying for the vengeance of heaven to rest upon the heads of their devoted murderers, and saying, \"How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?\" But it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servants also, and their brethren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. Dear brethren, we should remind you of this thing; and although you have had indignities, insults and injuries heaped upon you, till further suffering would seem to be no longer a virtue: we would say, be patient, dear brethren, for as saith the Apostle, \"ye have need of patience, that after being tried you may inherit the promise.\" You have been tried in the furnace of affliction; the time to exercise patience is now come; and we shall reap, brethren, in due time if we faint not. Do not breathe vengeance upon your oppressors, but leave the case in the hands of God; \"for vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay.\" We would say to the widow and the orphan, to the destitute, and to the diseased, who have been made so through persecution, be patient; you are not forgotten; the God of Jacob has His eye upon you; the heavens have been witness to your sufferings, and they are registered on high; angels have gazed upon the scene, and your tears, your groans, your sorrows, and anguish of heart, are had in remembrance before God; they have entered into the sympathies of that bosom who is \"touched with the feelings of our infirmities,\" who was \"tempted in all points like unto you;\" they have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth; be patient then, until the words of God be fulfilled, and His designs accomplished; and then shall He pour out His vengeance upon the devoted heads of your murderers; and then shall they know that He is God, and that you are His people. * * * * * * * We wish to stimulate all the brethren to faithfulness; you have been tried; you are now being tried; and those trials, if you are not watchful, will corrode upon the mind, and produce unpleasant feelings; but recollect that now is the time of trial; soon the victory will be ours: now may be a day of lamentation—then will be a day of rejoicing; now may be a day of sorrow—but by and by we shall see the Lord; our sorrow will be turned into joy, and our joy no man taketh from us. Be honest; be men of truth and integrity; let your word be your bond; be diligent, be prayerful; pray for and with your families; train up your children in the fear of the Lord; cultivate a meek quiet spirit; clothe the naked, feed the hungry, help the destitute, be merciful to the widow and orphan, be merciful to your brethren, and to all men; bear with one another\u0027s infirmities, considering your own weakness; bring no railing accusation against your brethren. * * * * * We are glad, dear brethren, to see that spirit of enterprise and perseverance which is manifested by you in regard to preaching the gospel; and rejoice to know that neither bonds nor imprisonment, banishment nor exile, poverty nor contempt, nor all the combined powers of earth and hell, hinder you from delivering your testimony to the world, and publishing those glad tidings which have been revealed from heaven by the ministering of angels, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, and by the power of God, for the salvation of the world in these last days. And we would say to you, that the hearts of the Twelve are with you, and they with you are determined to fulfil their mission, to clear their garments of the blood of this generation, to introduce the gospel to foreign nations, and to make known to the world these great things God has developed. They are now on the eve of their departure for England, and will start in a few days. They feel to pray for you, and to solicit an interest in your prayers, and in the prayers of the Church, that God may sustain them in their arduous undertaking, grant them success in their mission, deliver them from the powers of darkness, the stratagem of wicked men, and all the combined powers of earth and hell. And if you unitedly seek after unity of purpose and design; if you are men of humility, and of faithfulness, of integrity and perseverance; if you submit yourselves to the teachings of heaven, and are guided by the Spirit of God; if you at all times seek the glory of God and the salvation of men, and lay your honor prostrate in the dust, if need be, and are willing to fulfil the purposes of God in all things, the power of the priesthood will rest upon you, and you will become mighty in testimony, the widow and the orphan will be made glad, and the poor among men rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. The bond between the Prophet and his brethren, the Apostles, was close and strong. He relied upon them, confided in them, and showed them all the respect which their nobility of soul deserved. In their exercise of authority during his incarceration in Missouri he gave them cordial support, subsequently having all their acts ratified by the voice of the general conference. When he escaped from captivity and joined them in Illinois, the love with which he greeted them was like that of brother for brothers. Brigham Young, writing of the meeting, says: It was one of the most joyful scenes of my life to once more strike hands with the Prophet, and behold him and his companions free from the hands of their enemies. Joseph conversed with us like a man who had just escaped from a thousand oppressions, and was now free in the midst of his children. Joseph met with the Apostles frequently before their departure, praying for them and blessing them for their work. He also attended their farewell meetings and added his voice to the instructions which they gave to the Saints at Nauvoo before departing to engage in the vast work in the Old World. Elder Parley P. Pratt, now freed from prison, and Elder Orson Pratt were with them. In the months of August and September seven of the Twelve departed on their mission to England. Elders John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff were the first, leaving on the 8th day of August, 1839. Elder Woodruff arose from the bed to which he had been confined for two weeks in order to start on this journey. Both of these devoted men left their no less devoted families at Montrose in sickness and poverty and distress; and yet all relying upon the Lord for preservation and blessing. Elders Taylor and Woodruff started together without purse or scrip. Elders Parley P. Pratt and Orson Pratt, making all necessary sacrifices, departed from Nauvoo on the 29th of August. Elders Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball started together on the 18th of September, 1839. Brigham was so sick that he was unable to walk a few rods down to the river without assistance. He left his wife ill with a babe only ten days old, and all his other children helpless. Heber was in the same plight. His wife and all her children but one were prostrated. After Brigham and Heber had traveled thirteen miles on their journey, they stopped at the residence of a friend and were so feeble as to be unable to carry into the house their trunks, which contained the very few articles of clothing they were able to take with them. In less than a month after their departure President Brigham Young\u0027s father John Young, died at Quincy, Adams County, Illinois; so when Brigham bade his father farewell to go on this mission, the parting was for the remainder of their earthly lives. John Young was a noble man: he had been a soldier in the Revolution. At his death the Prophet said of him: He was a firm believer in the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, and fell asleep under the influence of that faith which buoyed up his soul, in the pangs of death, to glorious hope of immortality; fully testifying to all that the religion he enjoyed in life was able to support him in death. He was driven from Missouri with the Saints; * * * he died a martyr to the religion of Jesus, for his death was caused by his sufferings in that cruel persecution. On the 21st of September, 1839, Elder George A. Smith departed for England. He left his father, mother, sister and brother sick in a log stable, all unable to help themselves or each other. He, himself, was so emaciated that after he was a little way on his journey, he met some men who cried out: \"Somebody has been robbing a graveyard of a skeleton.\" Three other men started with the Apostles: Hiram Clark in company with Parley and Orson, and Theodore Turley and Reuben Hedlock in company with George A. Smith. This was the sublime missionary movement of the Apostles. How like the grain of mustard seed! Leaving the people of God in sickness and in poverty, they themselves being on the verge of the grave, these disciples of Jesus went forth to proclaim the gospel of redemption. If their faith had not been such as not to be shaken, the world never more would have heard of their endeavor. But it was firm and steadfast, and God rewarded it; and the little mustard seed quickened and grew and became a mighty tree. The Prophet said of them: Perhaps no men ever undertook such an important mission under such peculiarly distressing, forbidding and unpropitious circumstances. Most of them * * * were worn down with sickness and disease or were taken sick on the road. Several of their families were also afflicted and needed their aid and support. But knowing that they had been called by the God of heaven to preach the gospel to other nations, they conferred not with flesh and blood, but obedient to the heavenly mandate, without purse or scrip, commenced a journey of five thousand miles entirely dependent on the providence of that God who had called them to such a holy calling. The Twelve faltered not an instant in their appointed labor, and while they spread abroad the tidings of salvation, the Prophet in Nauvoo was directing the gathering Saints that they might build a city whose loveliness and greatness should attract the eye of every beholder. On the 5th day of October, 1839, a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was convened at Nauvoo, at which it was decided to establish there a stake of Zion, and to organize a branch of the Church on the opposite side of the river in Iowa Territory, and officers were appointed to preside and officiate in the stake and over the branch. At this same conference it was resolved that Joseph Smith, accompanied by Elias Higbee and Sidney Rigdon, should proceed to Washington to lay before the President and Congress of the nation the wrongs which the Saints had endured. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3320/90957.html","bookId":395,"book":{"id":395,"title":"The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet","description":"简介： Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak.
