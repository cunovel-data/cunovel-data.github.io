The peaceful and blessed hours which the Prophet had hoped to enjoy in the performance of his holy work at his home in Harmony, were quickly intruded upon. Satan had been able already to excite Joseph\u0027s enemies to a frenzy, and to make the conversion of even honest inquirers difficult, and in many cases impossible. Not satisfied with this, the evil one stirred up the hearts of some of Joseph\u0027s friends and associates to feelings of jealous vanity and fear. Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette, was the first victim within the fold of the assaults of the adversary. While the Prophet, aided by his wife, was transcribing the revelations, he received a startling letter, couched in stern and disrespectful terms, addressed to him by Oliver from Fayette. The letter demanded that Joseph should erase certain words from one of the commandments given by God to the Church, alleging that they had been incorrectly written. The Prophet was shocked and grieved, because he saw therein the snare which Satan had set for the feet of some of the flock of Christ. He knew, too, how prone Oliver was to be lifted up in the pride of his heart; and he saw in this a concession to evil by Oliver which must soon be checked and withdrawn, or Oliver, and those who had sympathy for him, would soon be cast out. Joseph wrote a letter, full of loving admonition, and yet rebuking firmly the error to which Oliver was yielding. Joseph informed him that the revelation had been correctly written—it was the command of God, and no man had authority to take from it a single word. Joseph soon followed his letter and visited his associates at Fayette. He found there a most deplorable state of affairs. Oliver Cowdery had yielded to the power of darkness. In the vanity of his heart he had set himself up against the Prophet of the Lord, and by skillful persuasion and flattery, had succeeded in winning the Whitmers to a belief in his views. Joseph felt that they were hardened toward him, and that the spirit which possessed them must at once be subdued and cast out, else they would be lost to the cause of Christ. He prayed for help, and labored earnestly and lovingly to show to Oliver and the others the error of their way. None of them at first would listen to his words. The influence which possessed them was perfectly aware that if they gave attention to Joseph\u0027s words they would soon discover their mistake; and it encouraged in them an obstinate and hateful feeling. After some time Christian Whitmer became convinced of their error. He saw the abyss into which the archenemy had endeavored to drag him; and he joined with Joseph in supplication to the Lord that his father and brothers and Oliver Cowdery might be turned aside from their evil course, and brought back into the right way. One by one they yielded to the voice of truth, and finally all—including Oliver Cowdery—confessed that they had been misled by Satan, and that they knew the Lord\u0027s words were not within the power of man to enlarge or diminish. Thus, promptly met, was an error rooted out. If unchecked it would have led away some of those to whom angels had administered. This showed to Joseph and to all who were with him that constant vigilance was necessary to protect even the best from the devices of the evil one. They saw that it was against the elect that Satan directed his strongest efforts; and that, when blinded by his temptations, they were unable to see the way of righteousness from which they were departing or the mire of wickedness into which he was leading their feet. For some of them the lesson was long effective; but with others it was of but temporary avail. These latter seemed unable to long restrain their own eager ambition and vanity, or to close their ears to the tempting whispers of the adversary, who constantly plotted their downfall. While Joseph was laboring in Fayette to restore peace to his brethren and prosperity to the cause, the sectarian preachers were stirring up the minds of the people at Harmony to think and act evilly toward the Prophet and his work. As soon as Joseph went back to his home he found that some persons who had been his friends now spoke and bore themselves coldly toward him. A Methodist minister in the neighborhood, taking advantage of Joseph\u0027s absence, had spoken all manner of evil things concerning him, and had succeeded in making the people distrust the Prophet and the work of God. Isaac Hale and his family were thus led away. When Joseph had left them to go to Fayette, they were filled with kindness toward him and his wife. They promised and accorded him protection and help; and they were examining the principles of the gospel so earnestly that Joseph hoped soon to welcome his wife\u0027s family into the fold. But the Methodist minister, who was influential with Isaac Hale, had whispered such untruths concerning the absent Prophet, and Satan had worked so effectively to blind the eyes and becloud the understanding of the people of Harmony, that nearly all were ready in persecution against Joseph. Isaac Hale and his family were turned from the work, and became from that hour its bitter opponents. But Joseph must not falter in his labor. The branch of the Church at Colesville was also suffering persecution; and the Prophet had to forget for the time all his personal afflictions. In the latter part of August, 1830, he called to his company John Whitmer, David Whitmer and Hyrum Smith, and went to comfort and instruct Joseph Knight and those who were associated with him. Such fierce threats had been uttered by the mobocrats who sympathized with the Presbyterian ministers, that Joseph and his brethren felt that they were risking their lives in thus journeying to Colesville. They joined together in mighty prayer, beseeching God that He would blind the eyes of their enemies, and permit them to go and come without recognition by the wicked. The Prophet informed his companions that their prayer would be answered, and the angel of the Lord would protect them and cover with a veil the vision of the murderous mob. They made no effort to disguise themselves, but traveled through Colesville to the house of Joseph Knight in broad day, meeting a score of their persecutors. A reward had been offered to anyone who would give information of Joseph\u0027s return; and among those whom they met were many who would gladly have earned the money, even at the expense of the Prophet\u0027s life. But no one said a harsh word to Joseph and his companions, and they were treated merely as ordinary strangers passing through the village. A meeting of the branch was held that night, and the Spirit of God was poured out upon the believers in rich abundance. They were all made firm by the blessing given, and filled with a determination to yield nothing of their faith, though the anger of the wicked should be visited upon them through robbery or even death. The next morning Joseph and his party started back to Harmony. A few hours after they were gone, a howling mob descended upon the house of Joseph Knight and demanded the persons of the Prophet and his companions—swearing to visit vengeance in case of a refusal. This mob was composed of some of the persons who had been incited by sectarian ministers on other occasions to offer violence to the Prophet. This time they were more fierce than ever before. All day long they surged around the houses of Joseph Knight and his son Newel, cursing and threatening. Nothing apparently would appease them until, exhausted by their own evil passions, they were forced to disperse. The situation in Pennsylvania was not improved; and soon it became apparent that the Prophet could not work in the vicinity of Harmony with any degree of vigor and freedom. Persecution flourished on every side. But while the Prophet was suffering all this in body and in spirit, a messenger brought an invitation from Peter Whitmer, asking Joseph once more to come to Fayette and establish his home. The peace of the Holy Spirit had filled the hearts of the brethren at Fayette, and they desired to have the Prophet among them, to bless him with their faith, and aid him by their works in the accomplishment of his ministry. After a brief time Joseph Knight came to Harmony. Seeing the situation of the Prophet, he offered his wagon and horses for the conveyance of Joseph\u0027s family to Fayette; and in the last week of August, 1830, the Prophet found himself established once more in the house of Peter Whitmer. Wearied with the buffetings of the world, Joseph would have been glad to enjoy a little season of peace; but on his arrival at Fayette he found that the old spirit of vanity had gained an entrance, even while he was journeying from Harmony. One of the brethren named Hiram Page, had been inspired by the evil one to make known revelations which he declared he had received for the Church, through a stone he had, which were utterly at variance with the spirit of the gospel and opposed to the commands of God, previously given through Joseph, the ordained Prophet. These tempting declarations made by Hiram Page had met with the favor of Oliver Cowdery and some of the Whitmers. They were deceived by him; they had not yet fully learned that Satan could give revelations. Joseph rebuked again, and this time more sternly, the childish folly of these people. They were anxious to do right; and yet, without his presence, they were certain to do evil. He demanded that they should forsake the false doctrines which Hiram Page was promulgating, and that all should unite with him in asking God to reveal to them His will concerning the manner in which His commands should be given to the world. The answer to this petition was that revelation, given to Oliver Cowdery early in September, 1830, establishing once and forever the order of Heaven concerning God\u0027s revelations to men. It was made known to Oliver therein that God had but one head for His Church, and that head was His chosen servant, Joseph Smith. No one else should be appointed by the Church until God should so direct, to receive commandments; for Joseph held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations which were sealed, and through him alone should they be given, until some other should be chosen by the Lord in his stead. Oliver\u0027s place was defined to him: He should receive revelations, but not to be written by way of command to the Church. It was his duty to labor in secret with his brother, Hiram Page, and declare to him that the things which Hiram had written as revelations from that stone, were not of God and that Satan was deceiving him. When these things should be finished, Oliver was told, it would be his duty to go to the land of the Lamanites, or Indians, among whom the gospel must be proclaimed, and by whose borders a city should be built. The word of God had its effect, and the evil which had been done was repented of by all. Hiram Page and the Whitmers forsook that which had been condemned and asked forgiveness. Besides settling the grand principle that individuals can receive revelations for their own comfort, but not as commandments for the Church, and that the chosen Prophet who stands at the head shall alone have that authority, the Lord in this revelation informed His children of a purpose which to them must have been a source of amazement. It was within this divine purpose that a city of the Saints should be built; and yet here was but a handful of people, with a Prophet persecuted, threatened, driven, until he had no place to lay his head, except through the charity of his brethren. Doubtless these people, who were now reconciled to Heaven and united with each other, felt wonder that they should be called upon to engage in any labor likely to attract anew the vengeful feeling of mobs. But whatever worldly fear may have assailed them, they were soon blessed and encouraged by another revelation, which followed in a few days. It came through Joseph in the presence of six elders at Fayette; and it declared that they were chosen out of the world to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ with the sound of rejoicing as with the voice of a trump. They were informed that their duty would be to bring to pass the gathering of God\u0027s people upon the earth. This was the spiritual inception of that great missionary movement designed by God to bring out from every nation, kindred, tongue and people to the land which He should designate as a place of gathering, every honest soul who would have faith and accept the requirements of the gospel. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3320/90927.html","bookId":395,"book":{"id":395,"title":"The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet","description":"简介： Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak.
