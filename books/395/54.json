BENNETT JOINS THE CHURCH—NAUVOO CITY CHARTERED—NAUVOO UNIVERSITY AND LEGION ORGANIZED—JOSEPH SMITH COMMISSIONED AS LIEUTENANT-GENERAL OF THE STATE MILITIA—TEMPLE SITE—DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE—AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE. With the establishment of Nauvoo as a city Dr. John C. Bennett came into prominent association with the Church. He was a quarter-master general of the state of Illinois, and a man of extensive acquirements and many ambitions. At the time of the Prophet\u0027s imprisonment in Missouri he had offered his services to secure Joseph\u0027s release, by force, if necessary, but the tender was not accepted. His expressed sympathy was no doubt sincere. He saw the sufferings of the people and was drawn toward them. He saw the grandeur of the Prophet\u0027s character and was attracted by it. When the people moved into Illinois, he made a closer examination of their faith, and accepted it. No doubt he was still sincere at this time; and if he had been willing to heed the Prophet\u0027s warning and to be humble and pure, he might have been a blessing to the Church for many years, and might have lived and died a happy man, with a full assurance of eternal salvation. On Sunday, the 24th day of January, 1841, Hyrum Smith received the office of patriarch to the Church, to succeed his deceased father; he was also by revelation sustained as a prophet and revelator to the Church. The vacancy in the quorum of the First Presidency, thus occasioned, was filled by the selection of William Law to be second counselor to Joseph. On the 30th day of January a special conference was held at Nauvoo at which Joseph was elected sole trustee-in-trust for the Church, to hold the office during his life, his successor to be of the First Presidency of the Church. This action was taken in pursuance of the provisions of an act of the Illinois Legislature concerning religious societies. The charter of the city of Nauvoo was devised by Joseph, as he says \"on principles so broad that any honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence without distinction of sect or party.\" It was comprehensive, and in some respects unusual, but its provisions were purely republican and the end designed by its framer was insured. It was signed by Thomas Carlin, governor, and was certified by Stephen A. Douglas, secretary of state. On the 1st day of February, 1841, the charter for the city of Nauvoo took effect. On the same day an election was held for mayor and members of the city council. John C. Bennett was elected mayor; with William Marks, Samuel H. Smith, Daniel H. Wells and Newel K. Whitney for aldermen; and Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Charles C. Rich, John T. Barnett, Wilson Law, Don Carlos Smith, John P. Greene and Vinson Knight for councilors. The twenty-fourth section of the charter of the city of Nauvoo was as follows: The city council may establish and organize an institution of learning within the limits of the city, for the teachings of the arts, sciences and learned professions, to be called the \"University of the City of Nauvoo,\" which institution shall be under the control and management of a Board of Trustees, consisting of a Chancellor, Registrar and twenty-three Regents, which Board shall thereafter be a body corporate and politic, with perpetual successors by the name of the \"Chancellor and Regents of the University of the City of Nauvoo,\" and shall have full power to pass, ordain, establish and execute all such laws and ordinances as they may consider necessary for the welfare and prosperity of said University, its officers and students; provided that the said laws and ordinances shall not be repugnant to the constitution of the United States, or of this state; and provided, also, that the Trustees shall at all times be appointed by the city council, and shall have all the powers and privileges for the advancement of the cause of education which appertain to the Trustees of any other college or university of this state. In pursuance of this provision, at the first meeting of the city council Joseph Smith presented an ordinance organizing the university and appointed a board of trustees. The purpose of this institution of learning was to give the Saints and all others who loved learning an opportunity to gain a knowledge of the arts and sciences; for Joseph was ever desirous to bring his brethren and friends into close acquaintance with all that was best in the experience of the world. One of the trustees of the university was Daniel H. Wells, who also had been elected an alderman of the city. He was not then a member of the Church, but he was a young man of such manifest fairness and integrity that the Prophet was glad of his assistance. The twenty-fifth section of the city charter was as follows: The city council may organize the inhabitants of said city, subject to military duty, into a body of independent military men, to be called the \"Nauvoo Legion,\" the court martial of which shall be composed of the commissioned officers of said legion, and constitute the law-making department, with full powers and authority to make, ordain, establish and execute all such laws and ordinances as may be considered necessary for the benefit, government and regulation of said Legion; provided said court martial shall pass no law or act, repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the constitution of the United States, or of this state; and provided also that the officers of the Legion shall be commissioned by the governor of the state. The said Legion shall perform the same amount of military duty as is now or may be hereafter required of the regular militia of the state, and shall be at the disposal of the mayor in executing the laws and ordinances of the city corporation, and the laws of the state, and at the disposal of the governor for the public defense, and the execution of the laws of the state or of the United States, and shall be entitled to their proportion of the public arms; and provided also, that said Legion shall be exempt from all other military duty. In pursuance of the provisions of the charter the Nauvoo Legion was organized on the 4th day of February, 1841. Subsequently citizens of Hancock County enrolled themselves in the legion, and at the election Joseph Smith was chosen as Lieutenant-General and John C. Bennett Major-General, with Wilson Law and Don Carlos Smith as Brigadier-Generals of the two cohorts of the Legion. Speaking of the University and the Legion in a letter written at this time, the Prophet describes their purpose in these words: The \"Nauvoo Legion\" embraces all our military power, and will enable us to perform our military duty by ourselves, and thus afford us the power and privilege of avoiding one of the most fruitful sources of strife, oppression and collision with the world. It will enable us to show our attachment to the state and nation, as a people, whenever the public service requires our aid, thus proving ourselves obedient to the paramount laws of the land, and ready at all times to sustain and execute them. The \"University of the City of Nauvoo\" will enable us to teach our children wisdom, to instruct them in all knowledge and learning, in the arts, sciences and learned professions. We hope to make this institution one of the great lights of the world, and by and through it to diffuse that kind of knowledge which will be of practical utility, and for the public good, and also for private and individual happiness. The Regents of the University will take the general supervision of all matters appertaining to education, from common schools up to the highest branches of a most liberal collegiate course. They will establish a regular system of education, and hand over the pupil from teacher to professor, until the regular gradation is consummated and the education finished. At a session of the city council held on the 8th day of February, 1841, Joseph reported a bill for an ordinance to prohibit the sale of liquor at retail, which was subsequently passed and put into effect under the title \"An ordinance in relation to temperance.\" The purpose of this measure was to prevent dram drinking, and the event proved that it was wisely and safely drawn, for Nauvoo, under the strict enforcement of this provision, was able to get rid of the low and the depraved. In the discussion of the bill the Prophet spoke at some length on the use of liquors, showing that they operated as a poison upon the system and demonstrating that even in medicine other and harmless things might take their place. The part taken by Joseph Smith indicates his willingness to join in any practical labor for the advancement of his fellow-men and for the welfare of his country. He consented to act as a member of the city council because he desired to assist in the promotion of a wholesome municipal government. His inspiration was not entirely among the clouds. It prompted him to those practical works without which no community can hope to achieve happiness and prosperity. He became a trustee of the University because no man of his time loved knowledge more than he, and he wished to assist the institution to present the wisdom of past and present times to the rising generation. He consented to act as Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion—not that he loved military powers or expected to go to war, but that he recognized the duty of every citizen to be prepared to give his arm to his country\u0027s service. His conduct in this respect is a reminder that, notwithstanding his divine appointment, he held himself amenable to every law and every regulation of his country. On the 1st day of March Councilor Joseph Smith presented bills for ordinances providing for the freedom of all religious sects and denominations, and the freedom of all peaceable public meetings within the city of Nauvoo. The ordinances were passed in accordance with the provisions of his bills. His purpose was not to secure freedom for the Saints within the municipality; for this was made certain by their numerical preponderance and by the fact that nearly all the officials were of their number. But it was always Joseph\u0027s plan to encourage further discussion and consideration of religious matters, and he desired that no insult or injury should be offered by any of the people of Nauvoo to any minister, or to any other person who might desire to present views not in accordance with the opinions of the majority. He himself and his associates had suffered so much at the hands of a bigoted majority in the past that he determined to prevent any such offense against justice and against heaven, by the citizens of Nauvoo. On the 10th day of March, Governor Thomas Carlin issued a commission to Joseph Smith as \"Lieutenant-General, Nauvoo Legion, of the militia of the state of Illinois.\" The spiritual welfare of the people was never neglected by him, and during this busy period he was still able to impart religious instruction from time to time as the needs of the people made such instruction necessary. A revelation was received on the 19th day of January, 1841, concerning the building of the Nauvoo temple and the order and authority of the Priesthood; also making proclamation to all the world to give heed to the light and glory of Zion. In March of the same year the Saints were commanded by revelation to build a city in Iowa, across the river from Nauvoo, to be called Zarahemla. The building of the Nauvoo house was directed by revelation that it should be an abiding place for the weary traveler who might seek health and safety and the opportunity to contemplate the word of the Lord. The Prophet and his brethren went forward to fulfill this commandment. The site selected for a Temple at Nauvoo was most beautiful for situation. The city of Nauvoo was partly built on a level plain and on a noble hill which rose boldly to a height which gave from its summit a commanding view of the surrounding country. The site of the temple was at the summit and in the foreground of this hill. The Mississippi river swept in a half-circle around the lower level of the city, and a number of the north and south terminations of the streets in that part were on the river. The temple could be seen from up and down the river for many miles, and was the most conspicuous building in all that region. The view from its roof and tower was very grand—embracing an extensive view of the river and a wide stretch of forest and improved lands on both the Illinois and Iowa sides of the \"Father of Waters.\" On the 6th day of April, 1841, the first day of the twelfth year of the existence of the Church of Jesus Christ in this last dispensation, a general conference was convened in the city of Nauvoo. At the same time conferences were being held in England under the direction of Brigham Young and the other Apostles, nine of that quorum being in that land and at Philadelphia under the direction of Hyrum Smith. At Nauvoo the first step was to lay the corner stone of the temple as directed by revelation from the Lord. On the morning of the 6th a vast procession was formed, which proceeded to the grounds selected for a site. A hollow square of people was formed around the spot, and the officers of the Nauvoo Legion, with the architect of the building, the speakers and others, were conducted to the stand at the principal corner stone—the south-east. After an address by Sidney Rigdon, followed by hymns and prayer, the architect, by direction of the Prophet, lowered the south-east corner stone to its place, and Joseph Smith pronounced the benediction, saying: The principal corner stone, in representation of the First Presidency, is now duly laid in honor of the great God; and may it there remain until the whole fabric is completed; and may the same be accomplished speedily; that the Saints may have a place to worship God, and the Son of Man have where to lay His head. After an adjournment for one hour, the people again assembled, and the south-west corner stone was laid by direction of Don Carlos Smith and his counselors, presiding over the High Priesthood. The north-west corner stone was laid under the direction of the high council; and the north-east corner stone was put in place under the direction of Bishop Newel K. Whitney and other officers of the Aaronic Priesthood. As each stone was placed in its position a prayer was offered, and blessings were invoked upon it by the Priesthood of the quorum officiating. This occasion was a time of much rejoicing for Joseph and the Saints. After all their sufferings from mobocracy they had at last reached a place where they could rest for a season and commence the erection of a house of the Lord. The Lord had a great endowment in store for His Saints. A suitable house was necessary in which to bestow this endowment—a place where the holy ordinances of the gospel could be administered. The foundation stones were now laid, and many and fervent were the prayers which were offered up that the Saints might be permitted to complete it. Joseph was eager to push the work ahead. The people were sick and poor, and it seemed like a very heavy undertaking for so few people as there were there to attempt the erection of such a house. But God had commanded, and they stepped forth cheerfully to obey. Joseph, in alluding to the proper manner of laying the foundation stones of temples, said: If the strict order of the Priesthood were carried out in the building of temples, the first stone would be laid at the south-east corner by the First Presidency of the Church. The south-west corner should be laid next. The third or north-west corner next; and the fourth or north-east corner last. The First Presidency should lay the south-east corner stone, and dictate who are the proper persons to lay the other corner stones. If a temple is built at a distance, and the First Presidency are not present, then the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are the persons to dictate an order for that temple; and in the absence of the Twelve Apostles, then the Presidency of the Stake will lay the south-east corner stone, the Melchisedec Priesthood laying the corner stones on the east side of the temple, and the Lesser Priesthood those on the west side. At a later time President Young explained concerning the laying of the corner stones of the Salt Lake temple: The First Presidency, who are Apostles, started on the south-east corner; then the second Priesthood laid the second stone; we bring them into our ranks at the third stone, which the High Priests and Elders laid; we take them under our wing to the north-east corner stone which the Twelve and the Seventies laid; and there again joined the Apostleship. It circumscribes every other Priesthood, for it is the Priesthood of Melchisedec, which is after the order of the Son of God. The conference at Nauvoo continued five days, and the time was a happy one for the Saints. In an address to the people on the second day, the Prophet said: The Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints feel great pleasure in assembling with the Saints at another general conference, under circumstances so auspicious and cheering; and with grateful hearts to Almighty God for His providential regard, they cordially unite with the Saints, on this occasion in ascribing honor, glory and blessing to His holy name. It is with unfeigned pleasure that they have to make known the steady and rapid increase of the Church in this state, the United States and Europe. The anxiety to become acquainted with the principles of the gospel, on every hand, is intense, and the cry of \"Come over and help us\" is reaching the Elders on the wings of every wind; while thousands who have heard the Gospel have become obedient thereto, and are rejoicing in its gifts and blessings. Prejudice, with its attendant train of evils, is giving way before the force of truth, whose benign rays are penetrating the nations afar off. The reports from the Twelve Apostles in Europe are very satisfactory, and state that the work continues to progress with unparalleled rapidity, and that the harvest is truly great. In the eastern states the faithful laborers are successful, and many are flocking to the standard of truth. Nor is the south keeping back. Churches have been raised up in the southern and western states, and a very pressing invitation has been received from New Orleans for some of the Elders to visit that city, which has been complied with. In our own state and immediate neighborhood, many are avowing their attachment to the principles of our holy religion, and have become obedient to the faith. Peace and prosperity attend us, and we have favor in the sight of God and virtuous men. The time was when we were looked upon as deceivers, and that Mormonism would soon pass away, come to nought and be forgotten. But the time has gone by when it was looked upon as a transient matter, or a bubble on the wave, and it is now taking a deep hold in the hearts and affections of all those who are noble-minded enough to lay aside the prejudice of education and investigate the subject with candor and honesty. The truth, like the sturdy oak, has stood unhurt amid the contending elements which have beat upon it with tremendous force. The floods have rolled, wave after wave, in quick succession, and have not swallowed it up. \"They have lifted up their voice, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; but the Lord of Hosts is mightier than the mighty waves of the sea,\" nor have the flames of persecution, with all the influence of mobs, been able to destroy it; but, like Moses\u0027 bush, it has stood unconsumed, and now at this moment presents an important spectacle both to men and angels. Where can we turn our eyes to behold such another? We contemplate a people who have embraced a system of religion, unpopular, and the adherence to which has brought upon them repeated persecutions. A people who, for their love to God and attachment to His cause, have suffered hunger, nakedness, perils, and almost every privation. A people who, for the sake of their religion, have had to mourn the premature deaths of parents, husbands, wives and children. A people who have preferred death to slavery and hypocrisy, and have honorably maintained their characters and stood firm and immovable in times that have tried men\u0027s souls. Stand fast, ye Saints of God, hold on a little longer, and the storm of life will be past, and you will be rewarded by that God whose servants you are, and who will duly appreciate all your toils and afflictions for Christ\u0027s sake and the gospel\u0027s. Your names will be handed down to posterity as Saints of God and virtuous men. On the third day of the conference, the Prophet stated to the assembled Saints that the presidents of the different quorums would be presented before them for their acceptance or rejection. He declared the rule of acceptance or rejection to be by a majority in each quorum; and he exhorted them to deliberation, faith and prayer, that they might be strict and impartial in their examinations. Objection was made to Elder John E. Page, one of the Twelve Apostles, and his case was laid over to be tried before his quorum. Elder Page had been called to accompany Apostle Orson Hyde upon his mission to Jerusalem, but had felt the sacrifice demanded was too great for him, and had delayed until this time. On this same day Lyman Wight was chosen as an Apostle to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Elder David W. Patten. About the 1st of May, 1841, Joseph received a visit at Nauvoo from Hon. Stephen A. Douglas, of the Supreme Court of the state of Illinois. On this occasion Douglas was accompanied by his political opponent Cyrus Walker, Esq. \"The Little Giant\" had not yet entered upon the greatness of his career in politics; but the Prophet recognized in him a master spirit among men. Douglas himself was so deeply impressed by the grandeur of the Prophet\u0027s character that he sought him out with deference. On the 24th of May, the Prophet directed a call to all the Saints to gather to the counties of Lee in Iowa and Hancock in Illinois; and directed the discontinuance of all stakes of Zion outside of these two. Under date of June 1st, 1841, the Prophet records that Elder Sidney Rigdon had been ordained a prophet, seer and revelator. This ordination was probably attended to in the month of May.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3320/90962.html","bookId":395,"book":{"id":395,"title":"The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet","description":"简介： Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak.
