{"id":109943,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Chapter 13\n It was a cloudy an gray day when I got back to Mobile. I gone to Mrs. Curran\u0027s house, an she was settin inside in a rockin chair, knittin a doily or somethin. She was glad to finally see me.\n \"I don\u0027t know how much longer I could of lasted,\" she said. \"Things have been pretty hard around here.\"\n \"Yeah,\" I says, \"I can imagine.\"\n \"Forrest,\" she says, \"like I told you in my letter, I gotta sell the house so\u0027s I can get into the Little Sisters of the Poor old folks home. But once I do, they\u0027ll take care of me for good, so I will turn over the money from the house to you to help raise little Forrest.\"\n \"Aw, no, Mrs. Curran,\" I says, \"that\u0027s your money - I can\u0027t accept that.\"\n \"You got to, Forrest. I can\u0027t even get into the Little Sisters of the Poor home unless I\u0027m dead broke. And little Forrest is my grandson and the only family I have left. Besides, you gonna need all the money you can get. You ain\u0027t even got a job.\"\n \"Well, you are right about that, I guess.\"\n About that time the front door opened an a big ole young man come bustin in, says, \"Gramma, I\u0027m home.\"\n I didn\u0027t recognize him at all at first. Last time I seen him was nearly three years ago. Now he has growed up to be almost a man, fine an straight an tall. Only thing is, he is wearin a earrin in his ear, which leads me to wonder what sort of underwear he has got on.\n \"So, you\u0027re back, huh?\" he says.\n \"Looks that way.\"\n \"Yeah, for how long this time?\"\n \"Well,\" I says, \"way I got it figgered, for good.\"\n \"What you gonna do?\" he ast.\n \"That one I ain\u0027t figgered out yet.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t of thought so,\" he says, an gone on back to his room.\n Ain\u0027t nothin like a warm welcome home, is it?\n Anyhow, next mornin I begun lookin for work. Unfortunately, it ain\u0027t as though I have got a lot of high-end skills, an so my choices are limited. Like becomin a ditchdigger or somethin. But even that was a hard card to play. Seems they weren\u0027t no big market for ditchdiggin at the moment, an besides, one of the bosses tole me I was too old for such work.\n \"We need up-an-comin young fellers who are lookin to make a career of this - not some old fart who is just wantin enough work to buy a quart of jug wine\" was the way he put it.\n After three or four days I got pretty discouraged, an after three or four weeks it become downright humiliatin.\n Finally I took to lyin about it to Mrs. Curran an little Forrest.\n I tole em I done found work so\u0027s I could support em, but the truth was, I begun usin up my separation pay from the army to pay the bills an spent my days at a soda fountain drinkin CokeCola an eatin Fritos, at least when I wadn\u0027t out poundin the pavement for a job.\n One day I figgered I\u0027d go on down to Bayou La Batre an see if they was anythin for me there. After all, one time I\u0027d owned the biggest bidness in that town.\n What I found in Bayou La Batre was pretty depressin. The ole Gump Srimp Company was in a sorry state - buildins an wharfs all dilapidated an fallin in, winders busted out, an the parkin lot\u0027s growed up in weeds. It was clear that part of my life was over.\n I gone down to the docks, an they is a few srimp boats tied up, but ain\u0027t nobody hirin.\n \"Srimpin\u0027s finished down here, Gump,\" say one captain. \"They done fished out all the srimp years ago. Now you gotta have a boat big enough to go all the way down to Mexico afore you can make a profit.\"\n I was about to catch the bus back up to Mobile when it occurred to me I ought to visit poor ole Bubba\u0027s daddy. After all, I ain\u0027t seen him in nearly ten years. I gone out to where he lived, an sure enough, the ole house was still there, an Bubba\u0027s daddy was settin on the porch, drinkin a glass of iced tea.\n \"Well, I swear,\" he said when I come walkin up. \"I\u0027d heard you was in jail.\"\n \"I might of been,\" I said. \"I guess it depends on when you heard it.\"\n I ast him about the srimpin bidness an his picture was bleak as everbody else\u0027s.\n \"Nobody\u0027s catchin em, nobody\u0027s raisin em. Too few to catch an too cold to grow. Your operation was the heyday down here, Forrest. Ever since then, we been on hard times.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" I says. I set down, an Bubba\u0027s daddy fixed me a glass of tea.\n \"You ever catch up with them fellers that looted your company?\" he ast.\n \"Which fellers?\"\n \"That Lieutenant Dan, an ole Mr. Tribble - an that ape, too - what was its name?\"\n \"Sue,\" I says.\n \"Yeah, them was the ones.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t think Dan an Sue was to blame. Besides, I guess it don\u0027t matter now, anyhow. They are dead.\"\n \"Yeah? How\u0027d that happen?\"\n \"It is a long story,\" I said, an Bubba\u0027s daddy, he didn\u0027t pursue it no further, for which I was grateful.\n \"So,\" he asts finally, \"what you gonna do now?\"\n \"I dunno,\" I says, \"but I gotta do somethin.\"\n \"Well,\" say Bubba\u0027s daddy, \"there is always oysters.\"\n \"Oysters?\"\n \"Yeah. Ain\u0027t as profitable as srimp used to be, but there is some oyster beds still left out there. Problem is, people scared of eatin em raw these days - too much pollution or somethin. They can make you bad sick.\"\n \"Can a man make a livin catchin oysters?\" I ast.\n \"Sometimes. Depends on a lot of things. Pollution gets bad, they close down the beds. Then there is storms an hurricanes an, of course, your competition.\"\n \"Competition? Who is that?\"\n \"All them other fellers out there tryin to catch oysters,\" he says. \"They don\u0027t take kindly to somebody new comin in here. An they is a very rough bunch, which I suppose you know.\"\n \"Yeah, I kinda remember em that way,\" I says. It was too true. Them oystermen was not people to fool around with, at least back in the ole days.\n \"So how do I get started?\" I ast.\n \"Ain\u0027t too hard,\" say Bubba\u0027s daddy. \"Just get you a ole skiff an some oyster tongs. Don\u0027t even have to buy a outboard motor if you don\u0027t want to - you can get some oars an row, like they did when I was young.\"\n \"That\u0027s all?\"\n \"Pretty much, I reckon. I can show you where most of the oyster beds are. Course, you\u0027ll have to get a license from the state. That\u0027s probly the most expensive part.\"\n \"You know where I can buy me a skiff?\"\n \"Matter of fact,\" says Bubba\u0027s daddy, \"I got one mysef you can use. It\u0027s tied up behind the house. All you\u0027ll have to do is find some oars. Mine done broke ten or fifteen years ago.\"\n So that\u0027s what I done.\n Well, it seemed to me pretty ironic, me bein in the oyster bidness, after ole Lieutenant Dan was all the time talkin about gettin some good oysters to eat. Man, I wish he could be here today. He\u0027d be in hog\u0027s heaven!\n I started out bright an early next mornin. The day before, I\u0027d used the last of my army pay to buy the oars an get a oysterin license. I also bought a pair of coveralls an some baskets to put the oysters in. The sun was just comin up over the Mississippi Sound when I begun to row toward where Bubba\u0027s daddy tole me some oyster beds was. What he tole me was to row out to where I could see Buoy No. 6, line it up with a water tower on shore an with the tip of Petit Bois Island to the south. When I had done this, I was to work my way toward the Lake Aux Herbes, an that\u0027s where the oysters would be.\n It took me about a hour to find Buoy No. 6, but it wadn\u0027t no time from then that I got on the oyster beds. By lunch I had tonged up four bushel baskets of oysters, which was my limit, an so I rowed back into shore.\n They was a oyster processin plant in Bayou La Batre, an I carried my oysters there to be counted an sold. Time they tally everthin up, I done made forty-two dollars an sixteen cents, which struck me as a little low for upwards of four hundrit oysters they would turn around an sell in restaurants for a dollar apiece. Unfortunately, though, I wadn\u0027t in no position to argue.\n I was walkin down the street to catch the bus back to Mobile, the forty-two dollars an sixteen cents still warm in my pocket, when half-a-dozen fellers come aroun the corner an block my way on the sidewalk.\n \"Kinda new around here, ain\u0027t you?\" one big feller ast.\n \"Sort of,\" I said. \"What\u0027s it to you?\"\n \"We hear you out there tongin up our oysters,\" another guy says.\n \"Since when is they your oysters? I thought they was everbody\u0027s oysters in the water.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? Well, they is everybody\u0027s oysters - if you happen to be from here. We don\u0027t take kindly of people who try to barge in on our bidness.\"\n \"Well,\" I says, \"my name is Forrest Gump. Used to own the Gump Srimp Company. So I\u0027m kinda from here mysef.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? Well, my name\u0027s Miller. Smitty Miller. I remember your bidness. Fished us all out of srimp an put everybody out of work to boot.\"\n \"Look, Mister Miller,\" I says, \"I don\u0027t want no trouble. I got a family to look after, an I just want to tong up a few oysters an be on my way.\"\n \"Issat so? Well, you look here, Gump. We gonna be keepin a eye on you. We hear you was hangin aroun with that ole coon thats son got kilt over in Vietnam.\"\n \"His name was Bubba. He was my friend.\"\n \"Yeah? Well, we don\u0027t mix with them people down here, Gump. You gonna hang aroun in this town, you better learn the rules.\"\n \"Who makes the rules?\" I says.\n \"We do.\"\n Well, that\u0027s how it went. Smitty ain\u0027t outright tole me to stop oysterin, but I got a feelin that trouble lay ahead. Anyhow, I gone on back home an tole Mrs. Curran an little Forrest that I done got a real job, an they seemed pleased. It might even be I can earn enough to keep Mrs. Curran from sellin her place an goin to the po house. It wadn\u0027t much, but it was a start.\n Anyhow, the oysterin bidness was, for now, my salvation. Ever mornin I\u0027d ride the bus down to Bayou La Batre an tong up enough oysters to get us by another day, but what happens when the season is over or the beds is closed by pollution, I do not know. It is very worrisome.\n Second day I was there, I gone to the dock where my skiff is, an it ain\u0027t there. I look down in the water, an it is settin on the bottom. Took me a hour to pull it on shore, an when I did, I find somebody has knocked a hole in the bottom. Took me three hours to fix the hole, an I only got enough oysters to make twenty dollars that day. I am figgerin this is some kind of message from Smitty an his friends, but I got no proof for sure.\n Another time, my oars is missin, an I got to buy new ones. Few days later, somebody done smashed up my bushel baskets, but I am tryin to take it in stride.\n Meantime, I am havin some problems with little Forrest. Seems he is engagin hissef in some typical teenage activities, such as stayin in trouble all the time. First, he come home drunk one night. I noticed this, since he fell down twice tryin to get up the steps. I didn\u0027t say nothin about it next mornin, though - the truth was, I wadn\u0027t really sure of what my position with him was sposed to be. When I ast Mrs. Curran, she shakes her head an say she don\u0027t know, either. She says he ain\u0027t a bad boy, but he is very hard to discipline.\n Next, I caught him smokin a cigarette in his bathroom. I set him down an tole him how bad it was. He listened, but was kinda sullen, an when I was finished, he don\u0027t promise to stop, he just walked out of the room.\n An then there was his gamblin. Account of his brilliance, he could beat just about anybody at cards an stuff, an proceeded to do so. This got him a stern note from the school principal sayin that little Forrest was fleecin all the other kids at school with his gamblin activities.\n Finally, he didn\u0027t come home one night. Mrs. Curran stayed up till midnight, but finally went to bed. I was up till dawn, when he finally tried to sneak in the bedroom winder. I decided the time had come to set him down an have a serious talk.\n \"Look,\" I says, \"this shit has got to stop. Now, I know young fellers like you gotta sow some wile oats ever so often, but you is carryin it to the extreme.\"\n \"Yeah?\" he says. \"Like what?\"\n \"Like sneakin in past midnight - an smokin cigarettes in your bathroom.\"\n \"Whatsittoyou?\" he says. \"You been spyin on me, huh?\"\n \"I ain\u0027t spyin. I\u0027m noticin.\"\n \"Well, it ain\u0027t nice to notice. Besides, it\u0027s the same as spyin.\"\n \"Listen,\" I says, \"that ain\u0027t the point. I got some responsibility here. I\u0027m sposed to look after you.\"\n \"I can look after myself,\" he says.\n \"Yeah, I can see that. Like you lookin after yoursef by hidin a six-pack of beer in your toilet tank, huh?\"\n \"So you have been spyin on me, haven\u0027t you?\"\n \"I have not. The toilet started runnin, an when I went to look I saw one of your beer cans have fallen over an plugged up the flusher hole. How could I not notice that?\"\n \"You could of kept it to yourself.\"\n \"The hell I will! If you can\u0027t behave yoursef, it is my duty to make you - an that\u0027s what I\u0027m gonna do.\"\n \"You can\u0027t even speak English right - or keep a decent job. What gives you the idea you got some authority over me? I mean, who are you to tell me what to do? Is it because you sent me those cheap presents from everyplace? A goddamn fake Alaska totem pole? An that ridiculous ooompa horn that I\u0027d look like a fool playin? Or that great antique knife from Saudi Arabia - when it got here, the little pieces of glass you said were jewels had all fallen out, and besides, the thing\u0027s so dull it can\u0027t cut butter, let alone paper! I threw em all away! If you\u0027ve got some authority over me and what I do in life, I\u0027d like to know what it is!\"\n Well, that did it - an so I showed him. I snatched him up an thowed him across my knees an afore I raised my hand I said the only thing that come to my mind.\n \"This is gonna hurt me more than it\u0027s gonna hurt you.\"\n An I give him a big ole spankin. I ain\u0027t sure if what I just said was true, but ever time I swatted him, it was like I was swattin mysef. But I didn\u0027t know what else to do. He was so smart I couldn\u0027t reason with him, cause that ain\u0027t my specialty. But somebody gotta exercise some control around here, an see if we can get back on track. Whole time, little Forrest ain\u0027t sayin nothin, ain\u0027t hollerin or cryin or anythin, an when I am through, he got up, face beet red, an gone to his room. He didn\u0027t come out the whole day, an when he come to the supper table that night, he ain\u0027t sayin much, cept things like \"Pass the gravy, please.\"\n But also, over the next days an weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in his behavior. An I hope he noticed that I noticed that.\n A lot of days when I am out oysterin or doin my other stuff, I am thinkin about Gretchen. But what I\u0027m gonna do about it, anyway? I mean, after all, here I am livin barely hand to mouth, while she is gonna be a college graduate one day. A lot of times I thought about writin her, but can\u0027t figger out what to say. It would probly just make it worse, is what I am thinkin. So\u0027s I just kept the memories an went on about my bidness.\n One time after he got home from school, little Forrest come into the kitchen, where I am tryin to clean up an wash my hands after a long day on the oyster beds. I have cut my finger on a oyster shell, an though it don\u0027t hurt much, it bled pretty good, an that is the first thing he noticed.\n \"What happened?\" he ast.\n I tole him, an he says, \"Want me to get you a Band-Aid?\"\n He gone in an got the Band-Aid, but before he put it on my finger he washed out the cut with some peroxide or somethin that stang like hell.\n \"You gotta be careful with oyster-shell cuts,\" he say. \"They can give you a pretty serious infection, ya know?\"\n \"Yeah, how come?\"\n \"Cause the best kind of place for oysters to grow is where there is the dirtiest nastiest kind of pollution there is. Din\u0027t you know that?\"\n \"Nope. How\u0027d you find out?\"\n \"Cause I studied up on it. If you could ask a oyster where it wanted to live, it\u0027d probly say, in a cesspool.\"\n \"How come you studin up on oysters?\"\n \"Cause I\u0027m figgerin I need to start pullin my weight around here,\" he says. \"I mean, you goin out there every day an tongin up oysters, an all I\u0027m doin is goin to school.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s what you sposed to do. You gotta learn somethin so\u0027s you don\u0027t wind up like me.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I already learned enough. I mean, to tell you the truth, I don\u0027t do nothin in school. I\u0027m so far ahead of everybody in the class that the teachers just let me go sit in the library an read whatever books I want.\"\n \"That so?\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s so. And I am figgerin that maybe I could just not go to school every day anymore, but maybe come down to Bayou La Batre sometimes an help you out with the oyster-tongin bidness.\"\n \"Uh, well, I appreciate that, but uh...\"\n \"That is, if you want me to. Maybe you don\u0027t want me around.\"\n \"No, no, it ain\u0027t that. It just that about the school. I mean, your mama would of wanted...\"\n \"Well, she ain\u0027t here to have a say-so. And I think you might could use some help. I mean, tongin oysters is hard work, and maybe I could be of some use.\"\n \"Well, yeah, sure you could. But...\"\n \"Okay then, that\u0027s it,\" he says. \"How about I start tomorrow mornin?\"\n An so, right or wrong, that\u0027s what we done.\n Next mornin before dawn I got up an fixed us some breakfast an then I peeked in little Forrest\u0027s room to see if he\u0027s awake. He ain\u0027t, so\u0027s I tippy-toed in an stood there lookin at him, sound asleep in Jenny\u0027s bed. In a way, he looks so much like her I kinda got choked up for a moment, but I caught mysef, account of no matter what, we got work to do. I leaned over to shake him awake, when my foot touched somethin under the bed. I looked down, an damn if it ain\u0027t the head of the big ole totem pole from Alaska I had sent him. I bent over an peered under the bed, an sure enough, there is the other stuff, too, the ooompa horn an the knife, still in its case. He ain\u0027t thowed them away after all, but is keepin em right there. Maybe he don\u0027t play with em much, but at least he has em close, an all of a sudden I am beginnin to understand somethin about children. For just a second I felt like reachin over an kissin him on the cheek, but I didn\u0027t. But I sure felt like it.\n Anyhow, after breakfast me an little Forrest set out for Bayou La Batre. I have been able finally to make a down payment on a ole truck so\u0027s I don\u0027t have to ride the bus no more, but it is a real question ever day whether or not the truck will make it there an back. I have named the truck Wanda, in honor of, well, all the Wandas I have known.\n \"What you spose happened to her?\" little Forrest ast.\n \"Who?\" I said. We was drivin on a ole two-lane road in the dark, past broke-down houses an farm fields, toward the water. The lights on the dashboard of the ole truck, a 1954 Chevy, was glowin green an I could see little Forrest\u0027s face in the reflection.\n \"Wanda,\" he says.\n \"Your pig? Well, I reckon she\u0027s still up at the zoo.\"\n \"You really think so?\"\n \"I guess. I mean, why wouldn\u0027t she be?\"\n \"I dunno. It\u0027s been a long time. Maybe she died. Or they sold her.\"\n \"You want me to find out?\"\n \"Maybe both of us should,\" he says.\n \"Yeah. Maybe so.\"\n \"Hey,\" he says, \"I wanted to tell you I was sorry about what happened to Sue an Lieutenant Dan, ya know?\"\n \"Well, I appreciate that.\"\n \"They was real good friends, huh?\"\n \"Yup, they was.\"\n \"So what\u0027d they die for?\"\n \"Oh, I dunno. Cause they was doin what they was tole to, I guess. Ole Bubba\u0027s daddy ast me the same question a long time ago. They was just in the wrong place in the wrong time, maybe.\"\n \"Yeah, I know that, but what was the war about?\"\n \"Well, they tole us it was account of Saddamn Hussein done attacked the people in Kuwait.\"\n \"That so?\"\n \"It\u0027s what they said.\"\n \"So what do you really think?\"\n \"A lot of people said it was about awl.\"\n \"Oil - yeah, I read that, too.\"\n \"I reckon they died for awl\" was what I had to say about that.\n Well, we got on down to Bayou La Batre an put the baskets in the boat, an I rowed us out to the oyster beds. The sun was comin up off the Gulf of Mexico an they was pink fluffy clouds in the mornin sky. The water was clear an flat as a tabletop, an the oars was the only sounds. We got out to the beds, an I showed little Forrest how to stick one oar in the mud to hold the boat still while I raked over the beds an then used the tongs to pull up big globs of oysters. It was a pretty good mornin, an after a while little Forrest said he wanted to do some tongin, too. He seemed happy as he could be, almost like he was tongin pearls instead of oysters, which in fact there were some - but they wadn\u0027t worth nothin, at least not for money to amount to anythin. Wadn\u0027t them kind of oysters.\n Anyhow, after we had got all our limit, I begun to row us back to the oyster processin plant, but I ain\u0027t got halfway there before little Forrest ast if he can try his hand at rowin the boat. I moved over an he begun to pull on the oars, an after about half a hour of weavin us this way an that, he got the hang of it.\n \"How come you don\u0027t get a motor for the boat?\" he ast.\n \"I dunno,\" I says. \"Sometimes I kinda like rowin. It\u0027s pretty quiet an peaceful. An it gives me time to think.\"\n \"Yeah, about what?\"\n \"I dunno,\" I says. \"Nothin much. After all, thinkin ain\u0027t my specialty.\"\n \"A motor would save time,\" he says, \"and efficiency.\"\n \"Yeah, I spose.\"\n Well, we got on into the dock where the oyster packin plant was an unloaded our bushels of oysters. Price was a little higher today, account of, the man says, they has closed a bunch of oyster beds because of pollution, an so our oysters were rarer than yesterday, which was arright by me. I tole little Forrest to go on over to the truck an get us our lunch buckets so\u0027s we could have our sambwiches down here on the dock, kinda like a waterfront picnic.\n I had just settled up with the paymaster when little Forrest come up, lookin unhappy.\n \"You know a guy called Smitty?\" he ast.\n \"Yup, I know him. Why?\"\n \"Well, somebody\u0027s punched a hole in both our front tires on Wanda. An this guy was standin across the street laughin, an when I asked if he knew who did it, he just said, \u0027Nope, but tell your friend that Smitty says hello.\u0027 \"\n \"Umph\" was all I could manage.\n \"So who is this guy?\"\n \"Just a feller,\" I says.\n \"But he looked like he was enjoyin it.\"\n \"Probly. He an his friends don\u0027t like me oysterin down here.\"\n \"He had a oyster knife in his hand. You spose he was the one who did it?\"\n \"Maybe. Problem is, I got no proof.\"\n \"So why don\u0027t you go find out? Ask him?\"\n \"I think it\u0027s best to let them people alone,\" I says. \u0027It ain\u0027t nothin but trouble to fool with them.\"\n \"You ain\u0027t scared, are you?\"\n \"Not exactly. I mean, they all live here. They\u0027re mad cause I\u0027m tongin their oysters.\"\n \"Their oysters! Oysters in the water are anybody\u0027s oysters.\"\n \"Yeah, I know that, but they don\u0027t see it that way.\"\n \"So you gonna let them push us around?\"\n \"I\u0027m gonna go on about my bidness an let them be,\" I says.\n Little Forrest, he turn around an went on back to the truck an begun fixin the flat tire. I could see him from down the street, talkin an cussin to hissef. I knowed how he felt, but I just can\u0027t afford no screw-ups now. I have got a family to look after. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gump-and-co-forrest-gump-2/page-13.html","bookId":1569,"book":{"id":1569,"title":"Gump and Co.
