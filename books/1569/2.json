{"id":109936,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Chapter 2\n Well, the next mornin Mrs. Curran come out on the porch with a cup of coffee an a doughnut. The rain had let up a little bit, but the sky was a dark pearly gray an there was thunder growlin off someplace like God was mad.\n \"I guess you\u0027ll want to go out to the cemetery,\" Mrs. Curran said.\n \"Yeah, I guess so,\" I tole her. I didn\u0027t really know if I wanted to or not. I mean, somethin was tellin me I oughta, but it was the last place I really wanted to go.\n \"I\u0027ve got little Forrest ready,\" she says. \"He ain\u0027t been there since... Well, I think it would be a good thing for him to go along. Just to kind of get used to it.\"\n I looked behind her an there he was, standin behind the screen door, lookin sort of sad an puzzled.\n \"Who are you?\" he ast.\n \"Why, I\u0027m Forrest. You remember when I met you a while back? Up at Savannah.\"\n \"You\u0027re the one with the funny monkey?\"\n \"Yeah. Sue. But he\u0027s not a monkey. He\u0027s a purebread orangutang.\"\n \"Where is he now? He here?\"\n \"Nope. Not this time,\" I says. \"He got bidness someplace else, I reckon.\"\n \"We\u0027re gonna go see my mama now,\" the little boy says, an I like to choked up right then.\n \"Yeah, I know,\" I says.\n Mrs. Curran, she put us in the car an we drove out to the cemetery. Whole time, I got these horrible butterflies in my stomach. Little Forrest, he just lookin out the winder with big ole sad eyes, an I am wonderin what in hell is gonna happen to us all.\n It was a really pretty cemetery, as them things go. Big ole magnolia an oak trees, an we wound around an wound around till we got to a big tree an Mrs. Curran stopped the car. It was a Sunday mornin, an someplace church bells were chimin away. When we got out, little Forrest come up beside me an looked up, an so I took him by the hand an we walked to Jenny\u0027s grave. The ground was still wet from the rain, an a lot of leaves had blown down, pretty red an gold ones, shaped just like stars.\n \"Is that where Mama is?\" little Forrest ast.\n \"Yes it is, darlin,\" Mrs. Curran says.\n \"Can I see her?\"\n \"No, but she\u0027s there,\" says Jenny\u0027s mama. He was a brave little boy, he was, an didn\u0027t cry or nothin, like I would of if I\u0027d been him. An after a few minutes he found hissef a stick to play with an walked off a ways by hissef.\n \"I just can\u0027t believe it,\" Mrs. Curran said.\n \"I can\u0027t neither,\" I says. \"It ain\u0027t right.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go back to the car now, Forrest. You probably want to be alone for a while.\"\n I just stood there, kind of numb, twistin my hands. Everbody I really cared for seemed to have died or somethin. Bubba an Mama, an now poor Jenny. It had begun to drizzle a little bit now, an Mrs. Curran went an got little Forrest an put him in the car. I started to walk away mysef when I heard a voice say, \"Forrest, it\u0027s okay.\"\n I turned aroun, but ain\u0027t nobody there.\n \"I said it\u0027s okay, Forrest,\" the voice says again. It was... It couldn\u0027t be... It was Jenny!\n Cept there still ain\u0027t nobody there.\n \"Jenny!\" I says.\n \"Yes, Forrest. I just wanted you to know everything\u0027s gonna be all right.\"\n I must be goin crazy, I figgered! But then alls of a sudden I kind of seen her, just in my mind, I guess, but there she was, as beautiful as always.\n \"You\u0027re gonna have to take little Forrest now,\" she says, \"an raise him up to be strong and smart and good. I know you can do it, Forrest. You\u0027ve got a very big heart.\"\n \"But how?\" I ast. \"I\u0027m a idiot.\"\n \"No you\u0027re not!\" Jenny says. \"You might not be the smartest feller in town, but you\u0027ve got more sense than most people. You\u0027ve got a long life ahead of you, Forrest, so make the best you can of it. I\u0027ve told you that for years.\"\n \"I know, but...\"\n \"Anytime you really get stumped, I\u0027ll be there for you. Do you understand that?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Well, I will. So go on back and get busy and try to figure out what you\u0027re gonna do next.\"\n \"But, Jenny, I just can\u0027t believe it\u0027s you.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s me all right. Go on, now, Forrest,\" she says. \"Sometimes you act like you ain\u0027t got sense enough to get in out of the rain.\"\n So I gone on back to the car, soakin wet.\n \"Was you talkin to somebody out there?\" Mrs. Curran ast.\n \"Sort of,\" I said. \"I guess I was talkin to mysef.\"\n That afternoon, me an little Forrest sat in Jenny\u0027s mama\u0027s livin room an watched the New Orleans Saints play the Dallas Cowboys - or whatever it was they did with them. The Cowboys done scored four touchdowns the first quarter, an we ain\u0027t scored none. I had tried to call the stadium to explain where I was, but ain\u0027t nobody answered the phone in the locker room. I guess by the time I got around to callin, they had all done gone out on the field.\n Second quarter it was worse, an by half-time the score was forty-two to nothin, an the sportscasters were all talkin about how I wadn\u0027t there an nobody knew where I was. I finally got through to the locker room, an all of a sudden Coach Hurley got on the phone.\n \"Gump, you idiot!\" he hollered. \"Where in hell are you!\"\n I tole him Jenny had died, but he didn\u0027t seem to understand.\n \"Who in hell is Jenny?\" he screamed.\n It wadn\u0027t too easy to explain all this, so I just tole him she was a friend of mine. Then the owner got on the phone.\n \"Gump, I tole you that if you don\u0027t show up for a game, I\u0027m gonna fire your ass myself! And that\u0027s what I\u0027m doin. Your ass is fired!\"\n \"But see,\" I tole him, \"it was Jenny. I just found out yesterday...\"\n \"Don\u0027t hand me that bullshit, Gump! I know all about you and your so-called agent, Mr. Butterbutt, or whatever his name is. This is just another cheap trick to get more money. An you ain\u0027t gonna do it. Don\u0027t never come around my football team again. You hear - never!\"\n \"Did you explain it to them?\" Mrs. Curran ast, when she came back into the room. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Sort of.\"\n An so that ended my professional football playin days.\n Now I had to find some kind of job to help support little Forrest. Jenny had put most of the money I\u0027d sent her into a bank account, an with the other thirty thousan dollars Jenny\u0027s mama had sent back to me, there was enough to earn a little interest. But it weren\u0027t gonna be enough for everthin, so I knew I had to find me some work.\n Next mornin, I looked through the papers at the job ads. Wadn\u0027t much goin on. Mostly they wanted secretaries an used car salesmen an such, an I figgered I needed somethin, well, more dignified.\n Then I spotted a ad in the column marked \"Other.\"\n \"Promotional Representative,\" it says. \"No experience necessary! Huge profits for hard workers!\" An it give an address for a local motel. \"Interviews at 10 A.M. sharp.\" \"Must be able to deal with people\" was the final line.\n \"Mrs. Curran,\" I says, \"what is a \u0027promotional representative\u0027?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure, Forrest. I think it\u0027s... Well, you know the guy who dresses up like that big peanut outside the peanut store downtown and hands out little samples of nuts to folks? I think it\u0027s something like that.\"\n \"Oh,\" I says. Frankly, I was expectin somethin a little higher up on the ladder. But I am thinkin about them \"huge profits\" the ad talked about. An besides, if it was bein a peanut man or somethin, at least people wouldn\u0027t know it was me inside the costume.\n As it turned out, it was not the peanut man. It was somethin very very different.\n \"Knowledge!\" says the feller. \"Everthin in the world depends on knowledge!\"\n They was about eight or ten of us done answered the ad for \"Promotional Representative.\" We had arrived at this dinky little motel an was sent into a room that had a bunch of foldin chairs set up an a phone settin on the floor. After about twenty minutes, the door suddenly bust open an in comes this tall, thin, suntanned guy wearin a white suit an white buck shoes. He don\u0027t say his name or nothin, just comes marchin into the room an gets in front of us an begun to give us a lecture. His hair is slicked back an greasy, an he has a little pencil mustache.\n \"Knowledge!\" he shouts again. \"And here it is!\"\n He unfolded a big color-poster-size sheet of paper an begun pointin out the various forms of knowledge, which are printed on it. They is pictures of dinosaurs an ships an farm crops an big cities. They is even pictures of outer space an rocket ships, of TVs an radios an cars, an I don\u0027t know what-all else.\n \"This is the opportunity of a lifetime!\" he hollers. \"To bring all this knowledge into people\u0027s homes!\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" somebody ast. \"Does this have anything to do with selling encyclopedias?\"\n \"Certainly not,\" the man answers, sort of hurt like.\n \"Well, it looks like it does to me,\" the feller says. \"If it\u0027s not selling encyclopedias, what the hell is it?\"\n \"We do not sell encyclopedias!\" the man replies. \"We place encyclopedias in people\u0027s homes.\"\n \"Then it is about selling encyclopedias!\" the first man shouts.\n \"With an attitude like that, I don\u0027t think you should be here,\" said the feller. \"Leave us now, so the others can be informed.\"\n \"Damn right I\u0027ll leave,\" says the first man, walkin out. \"I got roped into sellin encyclopedias one time before, an it\u0027s a total bunch of bullshit.\"\n \"Nevertheless!\" hollers the feller in the white suit, \"you will be sorry when all these other guys are rich and famous.\" An he slammed the door so hard the room shook an I was afraid the doorknob might of hit the first man in the asshole.\n It took us about a week to go through our \"trainin\" period. This consisted of havin to learn a long speech, word for word, about how good the encyclopedias we was sellin was. Book of Worldwide Information was what they was called. Our instructor was the feller in the white suit, who was also the regional sales manager for the encyclopedia company. Mister Trusswell was his name, but he told us to just call him Slim.\n Like Slim said, we was not goin out there to sell encyclopedias. We was gonna place them in people\u0027s homes. Actually, the deal was this: We gave the people the encyclopedias for free, provided that they would sign a contract agreeing to buy a new two-hundrit-and-fifty-dollar annual yearbook ever year for the rest of their lives. In this way the people got their free set of encyclopedias an the company got about ten thousan dollars for sellin the yearbooks, which cost about five dollars apiece to print. I would get fifteen percent of ever contract I made. An Slim got five percent of that. Now, how could anybody lose on a deal like this?\n It was on a Monday when we was given our first assignments. We was tole to wear a coat an tie an be sure to get shaved an clean under our fingernails. An there was to be no drinkin on the job, either. We reported to the motel, an there was a big ole flatbed truck waitin for us. Slim herded us on board like cattle, an away we went.\n \"Now, listen up,\" Slim says. \"Each of you is gonna get dropped off in a neighborhood. What I want you to look for is children\u0027s toys - swings, sandboxes, tricycles - that kind of shit. We want to sell these things to young parents! That way, they got longer to have to pay for the annual yearbook! You don\u0027t see no children or children\u0027s toys outside, don\u0027t waste your time!\"\n So that\u0027s what we did. Everbody, me included, got dropped off in some neighborhood. They wadn\u0027t very nice neighborhoods, either, but Slim says that\u0027s okay, cause people in nice neighborhoods is probly too smart to fall for the kind of scam we is tryin to pull. Anyhow, first house I see with a set of children\u0027s swings, I go up an knock on the door. A woman answers an opens the screen door. Immediately I stick my foot in it, like I have been tole to do.\n \"M\u0027am,\" I says, \"you got a minute?\"\n \"Do I look like I got a minute?\" she answers. Her hair is up in curlers an she is wearin a nightgown, an they is all sorts of racket comin from the little kids in the backgroun.\n \"I want to talk to you about the future of your children,\" I says, which is part of the rehearsed speech.\n \"What is your interest in my children?\" she asts, sort of suspiciously.\n \"They are badly in need of knowledge,\" I answers.\n \"What are you, one of those religious nuts?\" she says.\n \"No, m\u0027am, I am here to make a free gift to your home of the world\u0027s best encyclopedias.\"\n \"Encyclopedias! Ha,\" she says. \"Do I look like I can afford to buy encyclopedias?\"\n I could see her point, but anyhow, I went on with the speech: \"M\u0027am, as I have said, I\u0027m not astin you to buy encyclopedias. I am gonna place them in your home.\"\n \"What do you mean - loan them to me?\"\n \"Not exactly,\" I says. \"If I could just come in for a minute...\"\n So she let me in an set me down in the livin room. Slim had done tole us if we got this far, we was almost home free! I opened my kit an begun explainin everthin to her, just like Slim had said to do. The speech was about fifteen minutes long, an she just looked an listened. Three little kids about the age of little Forrest come in an begun crawlin all over her. When I am through, she bust into tears.\n \"Oh, Mr. Gump,\" she says. \"I wish I could afford them encyclopedias. But I just can\u0027t.\" An then she begun to tell me her sad tale. Her husband done run off with a younger woman an left her without a cent. She lost her job as a diner cook cause she fell asleep from overwork fryin eggs an ruint the griddle. The power company done shut down her electricity, an the phone company is about to do the same. She also got to have a operation but can\u0027t afford it, an the kids is hungry half the time. That night the landlord is comin around to collect the fifty-dollar rent an she ain\u0027t got it, so she\u0027s about to be thowed out of her house. An there is a bunch of other stuff, too, but you get the gist of it.\n Anyhow, I done loaned her the fifty bucks an got out of there. Man, she was pitiful.\n All that day I done knocked on doors. Most people wouldn\u0027t even let me in. About half of them says they have already been taken by other encyclopedia salesmen, an they was the unhappiest ones of all. Four or five slammed the door in my face, an somebody sicced a big ole ugly dog on me. By late that afternoon, when Slim\u0027s truck pulled up to haul us off, I was exhausted an discouraged.\n \"Now, don\u0027t none of you worry about this first day,\" Slim says. \"First day\u0027s always the hardest. Just think, if any of you had sold just one of them contracts, you would be a thousand dollars richer. It don\u0027t take but one, an I guarantee you there is plenty of suckers out there.\" Then he turns to me.\n \"Gump,\" he says, \"I been watchin you. You got energy boy! An charm, too. You just need a little practice with an expert! An I am the man to show you. Tomorrow mornin, you are comin along with me!\"\n That night when I got back to Mrs. Curran\u0027s, I didn\u0027t even feel like eatin no supper. Here I was, a great \"Promotional Representative,\" fifty bucks poorer an got nothin to show for it but thinner shoe soles an a hole in my pants where the dog got me.\n Little Forrest was playin on the livin room floor, an ast me where I been.\n \"Sellin encyclopedias,\" I said.\n \"What kind of encyclopedias?\"\n An so I showed him. I did just what I was tole to do. I gave my whole speech, openin out the folder with all the pictures an layin down the samples of the encyclopedias an yearbooks. When I was finished, he looked at one of the books an says, \"This is a bunch of shit.\"\n \"What is that?\" I said. \"Who taught you to talk that way?\"\n \"Sometimes my mama would say that,\" he replied.\n \"Well, it ain\u0027t no proper way for a seven-year-ole boy to be talkin,\" I says. \"Besides, why you call my books that?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s true,\" he said. \"Look at all this stuff. Half of it\u0027s wrong.\" He points to a part of the encyclopedia that\u0027s open. \"Look at this,\" he says, pointin to a drawin that said \"1956 Buick.\" \"That\u0027s a fifty-five Buick,\" he says. \"The fifty-six didn\u0027t have fins like that. And look at this, too,\" he said. \"That\u0027s an F-eighty-five fighter plane - not an F-one-hundred!\" Little Forrest gone on to point out a bunch of other stuff, too, he said wasn\u0027t right.\n \"Any dummy would know all this is wrong,\" he says.\n Well, almost any dummy, I figgered. I didn\u0027t know if he was right or not, but I intended to ask Slim about it next mornin.\n \"You got to catch em at just the right time,\" Slim says. \"Right after the husband has gone off to work an before they take their kids to school. If you see a yard with toys for little kids who ain\u0027t old enough to go to school, save it for later in the day.\"\n We had got off the truck in a neighborhood an was walkin down the street, an Slim was teachin me the tricks of the trade.\n \"Next best time,\" he says, \"is right after the soap operas is over an before they got to go pick up the kids again, or the husband gets home from work.\"\n \"Look,\" I said, \"I need to ast you somethin. Somebody done tole me a lot of the things in the encyclopedia ain\u0027t right.\"\n \"Yeah, who tole you that?\"\n \"I\u0027d rather not say. Question is, is it true?\"\n \"How the hell would I know?\" Slim says. \"I don\u0027t read that crap. I\u0027m just here to get people to buy it.\"\n \"But what about the folks who do?\" I says. \"I mean, it don\u0027t seem fair to be gettin them to pay all that money for stuff that ain\u0027t so.\"\n \"Who cares?\" Slim answers. \"Ain\u0027t any of them people know the difference - an besides, you don\u0027t think they actually use this shit, do you? They get it to put on a shelf, and it probly don\u0027t ever get opened up.\"\n Anyhow, Slim pretty soon spotted the house he was gonna make a sale at. It needed some paint an all, but outside there was an old tire hangin from a tree branch by a rope an some small bikes on the porch.\n \"This is it,\" Slim said. \"I can feel it in my bones. Two kids, just about school age. I bet Mama\u0027s in there right now opening her checkbook for me.\"\n Slim knocked on the door, an pretty soon a lady appeared, sort of sad-eyed an tired lookin. Slim went right into his pitch. As he kept on talkin, he just sort of worked his way inside the house, an the next thing the lady knew, the two of us was settin in her livin room.\n \"But I really don\u0027t need any more encyclopedias,\" she says. \"Look I\u0027ve already bought the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Encyclopedia Americana. We\u0027ll be payin on those the next ten years.\"\n \"Exactly!\" Slim says. \"And you won\u0027t be using them until then, either! You see, them encyclopedias are for older kids - late high-school and college students. But you gotta have somethin now, while your kids are still young - somethin they can get interested in! And here it is!\"\n Slim begun handin the lady all his samples, pointin out how many pictures an all were there an how the writin was simplified an much more understandable than them other encyclopedias the lady already had bought. Time he was through, Slim had got the lady to serve us some lemonade, an when we left, Slim walked away with a contract in his hand.\n \"Now, Gump! See how easy it is! Lookee here, I just made myself a thousand dollars for twenty minutes\u0027 work - just like takin candy from a baby!\"\n In fact, he was correct. Cept I didn\u0027t feel exactly right about it. I mean, what was that poor lady gonna do with all them encyclopedia sets? But Slim said she was just the kind of \"client\" he liked. \"They believe all the bullshit you can lay on em,\" he said. \"Most of em are grateful just to have somebody to talk to.\"\n Anyway, he says for me to go on now an start pushin the encyclopedias on my own, an he expects me to have a sale or two by the end of the day - now that he has showed me how to do it.\n So that\u0027s what I did. But by late that afternoon, I had knocked on two-dozen doors an hadn\u0027t even once got ast inside. Four or five times the people wouldn\u0027t even open the door - they spoke through the mail slot an tole me to go away. One lady was hoein some crabgrass out of her driveway an when she found out why I was there, she ran me off with the hoe.\n I was walkin on back to the truck pickup point when I looked down a street that was different from the ones I had been workin on. This was a nice street, with real pretty houses an gardens an expensive cars in the driveways. An at the very end of the street, up on a little hill, was the biggest house of them all - a mansion, I guess you could call it. I figgered, what the hell. I know Slim has tole us these kinds of folks don\u0027t buy encyclopedias, but I got to try somethin, an so I gone on up to the mansion an rang the doorbell. It was the first doorbell I seen all day. First, nothin happened, an I figgered ain\u0027t nobody home. I rang two or three more times, an was about to go on my way, when suddenly the door opened. It was a lady standin there, wearin a red silk gown, an carryin a cigarette holder in her hand. She was older than me, but she was still very beautiful, with long wavy brown hair an a lot of makeup. When she saw me, she looked me over two or three times, an then gave a big ole smile. Afore I had a chance to say anythin at all, she opened the door an invited me in.\n Mrs. Hopewell was her name, but she says for me to call her Alice.\n Mrs. Hopewell - Alice - took me into a great big room with high ceilins an a lot of fancy furniture an ast me if I wanted somethin to drink. I nodded, an she says, \"What\u0027ll it be then, bourbon, gin, scotch?\" But I remembered what Slim had tole us about drinkin on the job, so I tole her a CokeCola would be just fine. When she come back with the CokeCola, I went into my spiel. About halfway through, Mrs. Hopewell says, \"Thank you, Forrest. I have heard enough. I\u0027ll buy them.\"\n \"What?\" I ast. I ain\u0027t believin my luck.\n \"The encyclopedias,\" she says. \"I\u0027ll take a set.\"\n She ast me how much to write the check for, an I explained about how she ain\u0027t really buyin them, just makin a contract to buy the annual yearbook for the rest of her life, but she waved me off. \"Just show me where to sign,\" she said, an that\u0027s what I did.\n Meantime, I took a swig of the CokeCola. Uggh! It tasted horrible! For a moment I thought she done poured me somethin else besides CokeCola, but in fact she hadn\u0027t, account of she done left the can right there on the side table.\n \"And now, Forrest, I am gonna go slip into somethin more comfortable,\" Mrs. Hopewell says.\n I am thinkin she looks comfortable enough already, but of course, this is none of my bidness.\n \"Yes\u0027m,\" I says.\n \"Just call me Alice,\" she says, and disappears out of the room with her skirts sashayin behind her.\n I set there lookin at the CokeCola an gettin thirstier an thirstier. I really wish I had a RC or somethin. Anyhow, I figger she is gonna be a few minutes, so I gone on back to where the kitchen was. I have never seen such a kitchen as this! I mean, it is bigger than the whole house Jenny growed up in, with tiles an wood an stainless stuff an lights that come out of the ceiling! I looked in the icebox to see if there was another CokeCola, thinkin maybe that one had just gone bad. To my surprise there was about fifty cans of it in there, an so I popped open another one an took a great big swig. Arrrragh! I had to spit it out. It tasted like shit!\n Well, actually it didn\u0027t taste exactly like shit, whatever shit tastes like. It tasted more like a combination of turpentine an bacon grease, with a little sugar an fizzy-water thowed in. I am thinkin somebody done played a trick on Mrs. Hopewell.\n Just about this time, Mrs. Hopewell come through the door. \"Ah, Forrest, I see you have found the CokeCola. I didn\u0027t know you were that thirsty, you poor boy. Here, let me put that in a glass for you.\" She had put on a little pink nighty that showed everthin she had, which was considerable, an was wearin little fluffy pink slippers, an I am thinkin that she must be gettin ready for bed.\n But now I was really on the spot. She got a fresh glass that sparkled like a rainbow an poured the CokeCola over some ice. I could hear it cracklin in the glass an was wonderin how I was gonna drink it when Mrs. Hopewell says she will be right back, that she is goin to \"freshen up.\" I was about to thow the CokeCola out again, when a idea come to me. Maybe I could make it better. I was rememberin the time back at the University when I wanted a limeade so bad I could just taste it, but there wadn\u0027t no limes, an my mama had sent me some peaches an I made a peach-ade by squeezin the peaches through a sock. Bad as it was, I am thinkin that I can salvage somethin out of this CokeCola, account of my tongue is dry as my toe an I might even be dyin of thirst. I could of just got me some water, but by now, I have definitely got CokeCola on my mind.\n They was a big ole pantry, an inside it was hundrits of little jars an bottles of all sorts of sizes an shapes. One says cumin, an another says Tabasco, an another says tarragon vinegar. They was jars an bottles an little boxes of other stuff, too. I found some olive oil I figgered might cut the bacon grease taste some, an then a jar of chocolate sauce that might take off some of the turpentine flavor. I mixed up about twenty or thirty different things in a bowl that was settin out on the counter, an when I was finished, I mushed them all together with my fingers an then dipped out a couple of spoonfuls an thowed it into the CokeCola glass. For a moment, the stuff begun to boil an hiss like it was gonna blow up, but the more I stirred it in with the ice, the better it looked, an after a few minutes, it begun to look like CokeCola again.\n At this point I was startin to feel like one of them desert gold prospectors that was bakin to death under the sun, an so I lifted the glass an drunk it down. This time, it gone on down pretty good, an while it wadn\u0027t exactly CokeCola, it didn\u0027t taste like shit, neither. It was so good, in fact, that I poured mysef another glass.\n Just then, Mrs. Hopewell returned to the kitchen.\n \"Ah, Forrest,\" she says, \"how is that CokeCola?\"\n \"It is pretty good,\" I tole her. \"Matter of fact, I\u0027m gonna have some more. You want some?\"\n \"Ah, thank you, but thank you, no, Forrest.\"\n \"Why not?\" I ast. \"Ain\u0027t you thirsty?\"\n \"Why, as a matter of fact I am,\" she says. \"But I\u0027d prefer, well, a little libation of a different sort.\" She went over an poured hersef a glass about half full of gin an then put some orange juice in it.\n \"You see,\" she says, \"I am always amazed that anybody can drink that crap. My husband, in fact, is the feller that invented it. Somethin they want to call \u0027New Coke.\u0027 \"\n \"Yeah?\" I say. \"Well, it don\u0027t exactly taste like the ole one.\"\n \"You\u0027re tellin me, buster! I never had anything so wretched in my life. Kinda tastes like - hell, I dunno - turpentine or something.\"\n \"Yeah,\" I says. \"I know.\"\n \"Some stupid deal his bosses up at the Coke company in Atlanta have dreamed up. \u0027New Coke\u0027 my ass,\" she says. \"They always screwing with something just so\u0027s they can figger a new angle to sell it with. Ask me, it\u0027s gonna be a bunch of bullshit.\"\n \"That so?\" I ast.\n \"Damn right. Matter of fact, you\u0027re the first person ever got a whole glass of it down without gagging. You know, my husband\u0027s the vice president of CokeCola - in charge of research and development. Some research - some development, if you ask me!\"\n \"Well, it ain\u0027t half bad if you put some other stuff in it,\" I says. \"Just fix it up a little.\"\n \"No? Well, that\u0027s not my problem. Look,\" she says, \"I didn\u0027t get you in here to talk about my husband\u0027s harebrained schemes. I bought your goddamn encyclopedias, or whatever they are, now I want a favor. I had a masseuse coming over this afternoon and he didn\u0027t show. You know how to give a back rub?\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"A back rub - you know, I lie down and you give me a rub. You\u0027re so big on books about world knowledge, you gotta know how to rub somebody\u0027s back, right? I mean, even an idiot can figure out how to do that.\"\n \"Yeah, well...\"\n \"Listen, buster,\" she says, \"bring the goddamn CokeCola and come with me.\"\n She took me around to a room that had mirrors on all the walls an a big old raised bed in the middle of it. Music was playin through speakers in the ceilin, an they was a big ole Chinese gong settin there by the bed.\n Mrs. Hopewell got up on the bed an thowed off her little slippers an nighty an put a big towel over her bottom half, an she was laid down on her stomach. I tried not to look at her while this was goin on, but account of the whole room was mirrors, this was not very easy to do.\n \"Okay,\" she says, \"start rubbing.\"\n I got sort of aside of her an begun to rub her shoulders. She begun to make little oh-ah sounds. The more I rubbed, the louder they got. \"Lower. Lower!\" Mrs. Hopewell says. I gone on an rubbed lower, an the more I did, the lower I got! It was beginnin to get awkward for sure. In fact, I was now at the top of the towel. Finally she begun to pant an then she reaches over an hits the Chinese gong! It made the room shake an the mirrors seem like they gonna fall off the walls.\n \"Take me, Forrest,\" she moans.\n \"Where you want to go?\" I ast.\n \"Just take me!\" she screams. \"Now!\"\n At this point I suddenly begun to think about Jenny an about a bunch of other things, an Mrs. Hopewell was grappin at me an writhin an pantin on the bed, an this shit seemed about to get out of hand when, without no warnin, the door to the mirror room bust open an they is a little man standin there wearin a suit an tie an steel-rimmed glasses, kinda look like a Nazi German.\n \"Alice,\" he shouts, \"I think I have got it figured out! If we put some steel-wool shavings into the formula, it will make it quit tasting like turpentine!\"\n \"Jesus God, Alfred!\" Mrs. Hopewell hollers. \"What are you doing home this time of day!\" She done bolted upright an was tryin to pull the towel up around hersef to look decent.\n \"My researchers,\" the feller says, \"have found the solution!\"\n \"Solution! Solution to what?\" Mrs. Hopewell asts.\n \"The \u0027New Coke,\u0027 \" he says. The feller strides into the room, actin like I\u0027m not even there. \"I think we got a way to get people to drink it.\"\n \"Oh, for godssake, Alfred. Who would want to drink that crap anyhow?\" Mrs. Hopewell looks like she\u0027s about to burst into tears. She ain\u0027t got but that one towel, an she is tryin to cover hersef up, bottom an top, with it. Ain\u0027t workin too good, an so she is grappin for her nighty, which is on the floor, but ever time she graps for it, the towel falls off. I am tryin to look away again, but the mirrors won\u0027t give me no other view.\n About this time, Alfred, I guess was his name, noticed me.\n \"Are you the masseuse?\" he ast.\n \"Sort of,\" I says.\n \"That your CokeCola?\"\n \"Yup.\"\n \"You\u0027re drinking it?\"\n \"Uh huh.\"\n \"No shit?\"\n I nodded. I didn\u0027t exactly know what to say, account of it is his new invention.\n \"And it don\u0027t taste awful?\" His eyes got big as biscuits.\n \"Not now,\" I says. \"I fixed it.\"\n \"Fixed it? How?\"\n \"I put some stuff in it from the kitchen.\"\n \"Let me see that,\" he says. He took the glass an helt it up to the light an examined it, sort of like a person will examine somethin nasty in a laboratory jar. Then he drunk a little sip of it an got a kind of squinty look in his eyes. He look at me, then at Mrs. Hopewell, then he slugged down a big ole swallow.\n \"My God!\" he says. \"This shit ain\u0027t half bad!\"\n He drunk some more an get a real amazed look on his face, like he was seein a vision or somethin.\n \"You fixed this!\" he shouts. \"How in hell did you fix it?\"\n \"I done put a few things from that pantry in it,\" I says.\n \"You! The masseuse?\"\n \"He\u0027s not exactly a masseuse,\" Mrs. Hopewell says.\n \"He\u0027s not? Then what is he?\"\n \"I\u0027m a encyclopedia salesman,\" I says.\n \"Encyclopedias - Huh?\" Alfred says. \"Then what are you doing here? With my wife?\"\n \"It is kind of a long story,\" I tole him.\n \"Well, it doesn\u0027t matter,\" he says. \"We\u0027ll get to that later. What I want to know now is what in hell did you do to this CokeCola? Tell me! My God, tell me!\"\n \"I dunno, exactly,\" I says. \"It was like, well, it didn\u0027t taste so good at first, an I thought it could have stood some doctorin up, you know?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t taste good! Why, you moron, it tasted like shit! Don\u0027t you think I know that? And you have made it at least drinkable! Do you have any idea what something like this is worth? Millions! Billions! C\u0027mon now, try to remember. What was it, er - What\u0027s your name, anyhow?\"\n \"Gump,\" I says. \"Forrest Gump.\"\n \"Yes, Gump - well, c\u0027mon now, Gump - let\u0027s go real slow through exactly what you did to this stuff. Show me what you put in it.\"\n So that\u0027s what I did, except I couldn\u0027t remember everthin. I got out some of the little bottles an jars an stuff an tried to do it again, but I never could seem to get it quite right again. We tried an tried again, maybe fifty times, until it was way past midnight, but each time ole Alfred spit the stuff out in the sink an says it ain\u0027t like the first batch. Meantime, Mrs. Hopewell is about on her twentieth gin an orange juice.\n \"You fools,\" she says once. \"There ain\u0027t no way to make that crap any good. Why don\u0027t we all go lay down in the bed an see what happens?\"\n \"Shut up, Alice,\" Alfred says. \"Don\u0027t you see this is the opportunity of a lifetime!\"\n \"Opportunity of a lifetime is what I just suggested,\" says Mrs. Hopewell, an she goes back out in the mirror room an starts beatin on the gong. Finally, Alfred leans up against the icebox an puts his head in his hands.\n \"Gump,\" he says, \"this is incredible. You have snatched me from the jaws of defeat, only to throw me back again. But I\u0027m not finished yet. I am gonna call the police to seal this kitchen off. And tomorrow, we are gonna get an entire staff down here to pack up every conceivable thing you might have put in this stuff and ship it all back to Atlanta.\"\n \"Atlanta?\" I ast.\n \"You bet your sweet ass, Gump. And the most prized item of all is going to be yourself!\"\n \"Me?\" I ast.\n \"Goddamn right, Gump. Your big ass is coming along to our lab in Atlanta to put this thing together right. Just think of it, Gump. Today Atlanta! Tomorrow the world!\"\n Mrs. Hopewell\u0027s face is smilin from the winder as I leave, an upon considerin all this, I have a feelin that trouble lies ahead. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gump-and-co-forrest-gump-2/page-2.html","bookId":1569,"book":{"id":1569,"title":"Gump and Co.
