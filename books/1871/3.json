{"id":82763,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I wasnt sure what Sebastians opinion of Dullsville would be. It certainly wasnt London, Paris, or Lisbon. He, like Alexander, had been to places Id seen only in Armstrong Travels brochures.\\n\\n As we sauntered down Main Street, past the courthouse, fine restaurants, and trendy boutiques, I held my crimson-streaked head high, knowing that I was in the company of two vampires and that glaring Dullsvillians werent aware of their true identity.\\n\\n I had to admit we were a motley crew. Sebastian sported his wild dreadlocks, shining rings, and snake tattoos. Alexander was gorgeous in his studded leather jeans and white T-shirt, while I danced around the sidewalk in a dark knit hat, torn black-and-red minidress, and midcalf lace-up boots.\\n\\n Townspeople, decked out in their designer jeans and Kate Spade bags, avoided us as if we were the stars of a freak show. But I loved it! I felt triumphant being surrounded by what I thought was normal. Though Dullsvillians gawked at us, I sensed that most of them were staring at me, wondering who I thought I was, drawing such negative attention.\\n\\n \\n\\n Thats it, I said when we reached the Main Squares fountain. That is our bustling metropolis.\\n\\n This town is really quaint, Sebastian remarked.\\n\\n Yes, different from what you are used to, I suppose. Instead of the Eiffel Tower, we have a ten-foot-tall bubbling fountain. And instead of the Roman Colosseum, we have Dullsville Highs stadium.\\n\\n No, I like it. I can see why Alexander and his grandmother moved here.\\n\\n You do? I asked. Did you know Alexanders grandmother?\\n\\n I never met her. She moved here years ago and rarely came back to Romania to visit. But I hear she was a wonderful woman.\\n\\n I hear that, too. I squeezed Alexanders hand tightly.\\n\\n So, Sebastian continued as we passed Shirleys bakery, where does one go in this town for a bite?\\n\\n \\n\\n I can treat you to some ice cream, I offered. Shirleys has the best in town.\\n\\n Thats not what I was referring to, Sebastian said.\\n\\n Then what exactly were you referring to? I pressed. It wasnt every day a girl from Dullsville got to hang out with two sexy vampires.\\n\\n Where are the babes in town? he said, licking his fangs. I mean besides you, of course.\\n\\n I wasnt sure if Sebastian was serious about finding a meal in the form of a girl. Even though he was Alexanders best friend and surely benign, he was a true-blooded vampire.\\n\\n Probably at home studying or shopping at the mall, I finally said.\\n\\n No bars? he asked.\\n\\n None that youd like or that we could get into.\\n\\n \\n\\n So where do you two go for fun?\\n\\n The cemetery, I answered.\\n\\n There are girls there? he asked, surprised.\\n\\n Not living ones, Alexander said.\\n\\n We all laughed.\\n\\n Yeah, I guess not, Sebastian said.\\n\\n I figured youd love cemeteries, I said. Alexander does.\\n\\n Sebastian would rather hang in an Internet caf��, Alexander told me.\\n\\n It was not the atmosphere Id imagined Alexanders best friendmuch less a vampirepreferring. But perhaps I rushed to judge him, as so many of the students at Dullsville High judged me.\\n\\n Well, theres one right there, I said, pointing across the street to Javalicious.\\n\\n \\n\\n Sebastian perked up. Lets grab some coffee.\\n\\n All right, Alexander said.\\n\\n Great, I thought. Here I was hanging out with two hotties from the Underworld, and we were going to sit in a mundane coffee shop?\\n\\n And well sip it by the tombstones, Sebastian suggested as if reading my mind.\\n\\n Happy and giddy, I linked arms with Alexander, and the three of us headed for the shop.\\n\\n I tried to pay for two jumbo-size caramel mochas with whipped cream and one hot chocolate, but Alexander insisted on treating us. He beamed like I hadnt seen before, basking in the company of his two best friends.\\n\\n An elderly couple sharing a pot of tea seemed preoccupied by our presence.\\n\\n \\n\\n Dude, did you see her checking me out? Sebastian teased as Alexander dropped a few dollars in the tip jar.\\n\\n The woman rose and made her way toward us.\\n\\n I think she heard you, my boyfriend said, taking his hot chocolate.\\n\\n I do like older women, Sebastian whispered, but this one is using a walker.\\n\\n The woman slowly approached Alexander, who towered over her. The demure lady had two circles of soft blush on her powder-white skin. Alexander politely stepped aside, assuming she was going to order.\\n\\n She was quick to grab his hand. Are you the Sterling who lives in the Mansion on Benson Hill? she asked.\\n\\n The two baristas ceased brewing and the entire shop of coffee klatches eagerly listened.\\n\\n Alexander looked as if he wasnt sure how to respond. No one in town had ever talked to him before. Even though the elderly woman wasnt threatening, we were still uncertain of her motives.\\n\\n Uhyes, he finally replied.\\n\\n We have a Sterling painting hanging in our home. I bought it at the art auction last month. We were told it was by an up-and-coming Romanian artist. Is the artist a relative of yours?\\n\\n Yes, a very distant one Sebastian interjected before Alexander had a chance to speak.\\n\\n I was surprised by Sebastians remark, especially since it wasnt true.\\n\\n Are you kidding? I asked. Alexander was too humble to speak up. Alexanders the artist, I announced proudly.\\n\\n My boyfriend glared at me and shook his head.\\n\\n But you are so young, the woman complimented. It couldnt be you.\\n\\n \\n\\n It is! I said, glowing. Isnt he wonderful?\\n\\n My husband would love to meet you, she said, referring to the older gentleman seated at her table. If you have a moment\\n\\n UhI appreciate that Alexander began politely.\\n\\n Perhaps another time, Sebastian interjected again. We really should be going.\\n\\n Like a savvy media handler, Sebastian whisked us away from the woman before she could ask any more probing questions.\\n\\n See, I told you Alexander attracts the ladies, Sebastian lamented. If only she were sixty years younger.\\n\\n Sebastian was leaning against an already tilting tombstone while Alexander and I were nestled together on a cold cement bench.\\n\\n This town is relaxing, Sebastian commented, gazing at the stars. Besides that curious woman, no one really bothers you. You could hide out here forever and no one would notice.\\n\\n \\n\\n I think they notice, I corrected. And most of the people do bother me.\\n\\n Not when Im around, Alexander said.\\n\\n True. Im lucky; I have a bodyguard. I took a sip of coffee. Speaking of bodyguardsWhy didnt you guys talk to that couple? I figured youd want to tell everyone about your paintings.\\n\\n Its probably best not to, my boyfriend said.\\n\\n You dont have to be humble, I told him. But I must confess it is an endearing quality.\\n\\n I rested my head on Alexanders shoulder, and he gently stroked my hair.\\n\\n In this case, its survival, Sebastian said. Would you like Alexander to be run out of town?\\n\\n Of course not, I said, sitting up.\\n\\n Then he cant become the next Picasso, he added.\\n\\n \\n\\n But he sold his paintings to half the town, I challenged. They are bound to wonder who painted them.\\n\\n Yes, and then theyll be asking questions. Who is this mysterious artist that lives on Benson Hill? Why does he live by candlelight? Why does he sleep in a coffin?\\n\\n I wasnt planning on telling them what he is, just who he isan amazing artist, I defended. You know that, Alexander.\\n\\n Of course, he reassured me. I dont think we have to worry. She was just a kind and elderly woman. I dont think shell be asking for a tour of the Mansion anytime soon.\\n\\n Youre right, Sebastian conceded. Far be it from me to come to town and upset what youve established here. You have a really sweet setup. But for meI need more.\\n\\n Excitement? I wondered aloud.\\n\\n No.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wi-Fi?\\n\\n Sebastian leaned toward us and glanced around. Vampires, he whispered.\\n\\n I was surprised by his candor.\\n\\n Im not sure if I could be the only one in town, he admitted to me. Thats why I always admired Alexander. He seems comforted by the things that frighten me the most.\\n\\n I melted at his compliment for my boyfriend. Id always regarded Alexander with such high esteem, and I blushed knowing that others did as well. Alexander must have been touched, too, because a warm smile came over his face.\\n\\n This is a great place for someone like us, Sebastian said, stretching out again. If you dont mind being the only immortal.\\n\\n Sebastians remark filled me with loneliness for my boyfriend. Maybe Alexander was better off not being the only vampire in town.\\n\\n \\n\\n Do you think youll move here, too? I asked. Then Alexander wouldnt be the only one.\\n\\n Actually, Ill be taking off in a few days, Sebastian replied. Alexander didnt seem surprised, but I was disappointed.\\n\\n But you just got here, I said.\\n\\n I never stay in one place too long when I travel. Dont want dust to collect on my casket.\\n\\n But were having so much fun. Arent we, Alexander?\\n\\n Yes But Alexander didnt need to respond. His face showed a contentment I wasnt sure Sebastian had ever seen.\\n\\n Besides, Im cramping your space, Sebastian said.\\n\\n Its a mansion, I said. All it has is space.\\n\\n Yesyou can stay as long as you like, Alexander said. You know that.\\n\\n \\n\\n Sebastian surveyed Alexander and me hand in hand, cuddling on the bench. Then he gazed off into the distance. Perhaps I need to add a bigger city to my collection. And, who knows, I might get lucky and meet someone there like you did here.\\n\\n Sebastian took a swig of his coffee, crushed the cup in his hand, and tossed it into a garbage can. He popped in his earbuds and began dancing his way around the tombstones.\\n\\n Looking for someone you know? I asked.\\n\\n You never know who youll find at one of these places.\\n\\n Where Alexander had found a moment of peace, Sebastian was restless. He was searching for himself in the many cities plastered on his coffin. But just like in Barcelona, New York, Rome, and the many other places he visited, he hadnt found a home in Dullsville.\\n\\n Not only was I caffeinatedI was confused. It was more than a giant-size caramel mocha that was creating my insomnia. I lay awake in bed, clutching Nightmare as she fell asleep in my arms. How could she sleep so peacefully when so much was going on? At first I didnt want another visitor in the Mansion, but now, after meeting Alexanders best friend, I wasnt ready for him to leave Dullsville. Sure, he was disorganized and messy, but he had an insight into Alexander that I couldnt get without him.\\n\\n And I found myself feeling a little jealous that he had the freedom to fly off to the bright lights of the cities far away. I could only imagine what it would be like to have the opportunity to monster-watch at Loch Ness, search for witches in Salem, or camp beneath Draculas castle in Romania.\\n\\n Also, I was getting a little attached to Sebastian. It wasnt only that he was more playful than the other vampires Id met, like Jagger or Luna, but I was concerned how Alexander would feel when his friend left him behind. I couldnt imagine a happy existence without Becky by my side.\\n\\n First Alexanders parents left, and now his best friend would be going. Could this mean that Alexander would want to leave, too? Their visits and eventual returning to his homeland, Romania, might remind him of what hed been missing since his own arrival in Dullsville. He had roots with his vampire family and friends. And if he didnt turn me into a vampire, would he eventually become lonely surrounded by mere mortals? I began to wonder if I could possibly be enough reason for him to stay. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-3.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) \\n As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
