{"id":82768,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The hours ticked away painfully slowly during school. I was tormented as Becky raved incessantly about our previous evening at Hooligans. She went on about how she and Matt had a blast hanging out with the three of us, how we all could be best buds, and what a shame it was Sebastian was going to leave. She had no idea the evening had ended with a nightmareone caused by Sebastian. I was in a fog all day. I couldnt get my mind off of Alexander and Sebastians falling-out. Did they make amends? Had Sebastian left Dullsville? I begged for the sun to set as fast as it could, but it seemed to toy with me as it hung over the trees. When it lowered below the rooftops, I jumped on my bike and took off. I had no idea what I might find when I reached the Mansion.\n The Mustang was still in the driveway, but the front door of the Mansion was open.\n Jameson? Alexander? I called. But no one answered.\n The house was eerily quiet.\n \n I scaled the main staircase and passed a half dozen rooms until I came to Sebastians.\n I tapped the door and it squeaked open.\n The room was spotless. There were no signs that Alexanders best friend had even visited the Mansion. No coffin. No iPod, boxer shorts, or wallet. Not even a trace of Romanian dirt remained.\n I felt as hollow as the empty room.\n I ran throughout the Mansion. Alexander!\n No response.\n Jameson? I called.\n The Creepy Man was nowhere in sight.\n I entered the kitchen and found Alexanders best friend sitting alone at a rustic dinette, staring vapidly at a tiny plastic sword in his hand. His hair was unkempt, his eyelids droopy.\n \n I stood for a moment. Sebastian wasnt talking. He didnt even acknowledge my presence.\n I approached him tentatively.\n Im sorry youre leaving, I finally said. Apart from the fact that you want to break up my best friend and her boyfriend, we actually got along pretty well.\n Are you really? he asked, gazing up at me.\n Sure. You brought light to the Mansionliterally, I teased.\n But Sebastian didnt even smirk.\n Ravenwhat have I done? How could I have been so recklessso selfish? A girl should never come between friends. Im sorry things didnt turn out better than this.\n Alexanders still mad at you? I was hoping\n Not only didnt I find true love, I lost my best friend.\n \n It pained me to see Sebastian hurting. He wasnt as controlled as Alexander, or as menacing as Jagger. But like all the vampires Id met, he struggled with his place in the mortal worldjust as I struggled.\n Ill talk to Alexander. Im sure youll be able to repair thingswith some time. When are you heading back to Romania?\n Im not sure. I cant return like this. What do I say to my parents? To his? I thought I might stay nearby for a few more days.\n Then youre not leaving town? I was happy at the thought.\n Im not sure. I might just take a few days to think things through. And figure out how to make amends.\n Does Alexander know?\n We didnt talk much, he said with a nervous chuckle.\n I pulled out a chair and sat by him. Where are you going to stay?\n \n Im still not sure.\n Are you planning to crash in a hotel with a coffin? I asked exasperatedly.\n I thought somewhere more obscure. In the woodsor perhaps in an old barn.\n We both paused with dead concern.\n Nonot that barn! he corrected. Not anywhere near that barn! he said. Thats what has gotten me here in the first place.\n For a moment I deliberated taking him into my house. But I knew it wouldnt work. Not only would I feel awkward getting in the middle of the two guys feud, but how on earth could I hide his coffin bed?\n Id invite you to my house, I said, wanting him to know I was trying to help, but I think you might understand the massive complications in that plan.\n Thats very kind of youeven after I did that to your friend? Well, both friends really\n I sympathized with Sebastians dilemma. He was a vampirefor better or for worseand Alexanders best friend. If anyone knew his struggle, it had to be the gorgeous guy I was in love with.\n If youll excuse me, I rose and backed out of the kitchen. Alexander! I called, running upstairs. Out of breath, I burst into Alexanders attic room.\n I found my boyfriend sitting on his bed with a paint-brush in his hand.\n On his easel was a beautiful painting of Alexander, me, and Sebastian. It was the very one hed been working on so intently and that was bringing him so much joy. The one hed never sell or auction offthe one that was created for only his possession.\n I guess Im going to have to paint over him, he said.\n Dont you dare.\n He had a quizzical look. I thought youd be Your best friend is downstairs, as upset as you are. You should understand him and his desires more than anyone.\n But I thought\n I can see that he doesnt have the same personality as you do. I know its not easy for you to understand how impulsive he can be.\n Why do people think its so easy for me, too?\n Its not? I prodded.\n But Alexander didnt elaborate.\n I held his hand. He was so strong yet so vulnerable at the same time. It pained me to see him struggle in any way, whether it was with the tribulations of being a vampire or the normal conflicts of anyone with emotions.\n I didnt say it was easy for either one of you. Its just the way you handle it. Becky is my best friend. However, shes the total opposite of me in many ways. She would die before shed ever confront anyone or defend herself. She is terrified of silly things like the dark and spiders and would rather visit a mall than a graveyard. Ive protected her for years, like youve protected Sebastian with his loose lips and impulsive actions. But if I didnt have herif she didnt stick by me, toothen I wouldnt have anyone.\n Alexander folded his arms.\n Sebastian knows he messed up. But hes not going to leave Dullsville until he finds a way to reconcile with you. To me, thats a best friend.\n But I thought youd be mad at him, too. After all, he was almost stalking Becky.\n Im not happy about it. But your friendship is more important to him than she is. I want you to have a best friend just like I do, for better or for worse.\n I waited as Alexander decided on his next move. He gazed at the picture hed painted of the three of us together.\n \n He stood up and placed the brush on the easel. He took my hand and led me downstairs.\n We entered the kitchen, but it was empty of vampires. I followed Alexander outside, where Sebastian was loading his final bag into his trunk. Alexander left me on the steps and walked quickly to Sebastian. I winced, prepared to see fists and fangs fly.\n I waited. And waited. And waited.\n The two began talking. I was out of earshot, burning to know the contents of their conversation. At any moment, Sebastian was going to get in his car and drive off. I wasnt sure if Id ever see him again. I wouldnt even get to say good-bye.\n I felt a small pang in my stomach. I hated to see Alexander so upset with someone he cared about. I heard a car door close.\n Just then, Alexander reached into the Mustangs trunk, put a duffel bag on his shoulder, and summoned his best friend. The two vampires returned toward the Mansion.\n Jameson, I called. Prepare those smoothies with the tiny swords! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-8.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) \n As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
