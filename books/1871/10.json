{"id":82770,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The party at the Mansion was going to have to be top secret. I couldnt even invite Becky and Matt. I hated having an intimate party and not inviting my best friend. However, I had to remind myself of the motivation for the partyto get Sebastians mind off Becky and onto a vampire girl.\\n\\n Becky and I sat at a side entrance to the school, she intently eating her lunch on a step while I was perched on a half wall, doodling a macabre party in my notebook.\\n\\n A figure stood next to me. Whats that? Trevor said, snatching my notebook.\\n\\n Wouldnt you like to know.\\n\\n \\n\\n It looks like a sketch for a funeral.\\n\\n And if youre luckyor rather, I amyou could be the guest of honor. I tried swiping it back, but he held it out of reach.\\n\\n You and your friends are having some gathering where you try to bring back the dead\\n\\n We call it a party, I said back to him.\\n\\n A party? And when should I be there? he asked.\\n\\n A party? Whos having a party? Becky asked, placing her trash into her brown lunch bag.\\n\\n Uh, no one. Trevors just mouthing off.\\n\\n Well, your sketch looked exactly like a party to me.\\n\\n There isnt a partynot now, not ever! Cmon, Becky, lets go. This location is suddenly very unappetizing.\\n\\n Trevor remained at the half wall, puzzled, as Becky and I escaped into school.\\n\\n Sebastian and Alexander were hanging out in the gazebo when I arrived.\\n\\n Were going to have a party, I said to Sebastian.\\n\\n I know, Alexander told me all about it. I do appreciate the lengths you guys are going to to repair my broken heart, he said dramatically, his hand over his chest.\\n\\n You never know where you might meet the perfect person, I said.\\n\\n Listen, Ive been traveling all my life and I havent found her yet. Well, I thought I had, but Ive resigned myself to my fate. Becky will marry Matt and Ill be alone for eternity.\\n\\n Alexander and I were chuckling at his histrionics when we heard the sound of a car coming up the Mansions long driveway.\\n\\n Are the guests arriving already? Sebastian asked sarcastically.\\n\\n No one drove up to the haunted-looking Mansion at night, and I didnt recognize the car. The three of us headed back inside through the kitchen and waited in the dining room as Jameson answered the door.\\n\\n Im Giles Lunken with the Gazette, we heard a voice say.\\n\\n Giles Lunken? He was a well-known writer throughout Dullsville who had a column showcasing local and international talent.\\n\\n I was wondering if I could speak with Alexander Sterling, he continued.\\n\\n May I ask what this is regarding? Jameson asked like a strict butler.\\n\\n Is he the artist that painted the canvases sold in last months auction? We were thinking of doing an article about him for the Gazette. Hes so youngits amazing hes so talented. Also, Id love to come back with my photographer.\\n\\n Im afraid thats impossible.\\n\\n Why? His voice was accusatory. Hes not the artist?\\n\\n \\n\\n UhYou will have to come back at another time.\\n\\n Then it was another artist? Mr. Lunken prompted.\\n\\n Im not saying that, Jameson answered firmly.\\n\\n Then what are you saying? Did he paint those paintings?\\n\\n Of course he did\\n\\n Then does he have a personal phone or cell number? Mr. Lunken pulled out a PDA.\\n\\n Im afraid he doesnt.\\n\\n An e-mail? Mr. Lunken questioned.\\n\\n No.\\n\\n He doesnt have e-mail?\\n\\n Jameson shook his bald head.\\n\\n \\n\\n Does he have a Web site? I couldnt find any information on him.\\n\\n You can leave your card with me, Jameson suggested.\\n\\n UhI dont have one.\\n\\n You dont have a card? Jameson asked. Interesting\\n\\n I couldnt help but snicker. Alexander put his hand gently over my mouth.\\n\\n Ill come back in a few days.\\n\\n That would be best.\\n\\n Jameson passed us, and Alexander gave him the thumbs-up sign. The Creepy Man headed for the kitchen as we settled in the living room. Sebastian plopped down on the antique sofa.\\n\\n Dude! Sebastian said with an impressed tone. You are famous. Soon well have to invest in a security system to weed out the paparazzi.\\n\\n \\n\\n Funny, Alexander said. Shouldnt we have heard his car take off by now?\\n\\n Sebastian leaned back and peeked out the worn velvet curtain.\\n\\n He didnt leave.\\n\\n Alexander and I jumped onto the sofa and the three of us peered out.\\n\\n Giless car was still in the driveway, but he was nowhere to be found. He soon emerged from the side of the Mansion with a notepad. He continued walking, staring up at the attic window. Finally, he examined the Mustang, jotting down a few notes. Several minutes later, there was a knock at the door.\\n\\n Sebastian fingered his dreadlocks, straightened his shirt, and opened the door.\\n\\n Alexander? we heard Mr. Lunken say.\\n\\n No, Im Mr. Sterlings assistant.\\n\\n \\n\\n I was just here a moment agospeaking with an older gentleman. And I noticed a light in the upstairs window and this carI just thought\\n\\n He has a very busy schedule, Sebastian said.\\n\\n I can do the story without your help.\\n\\n Sebastian paused. Fine. I think we can work you in. Hell meet you at Javalicious\\n\\n Id like to meet here, the reporter insisted.\\n\\n Sebastian turned to Alexander, who shook his head adamantly.\\n\\n Please come back in two days after sunset.\\n\\n After sunset? Giles asked.\\n\\n I mean early evening. Hell be waiting. Sebastian closed the door.\\n\\n \\n\\n What are you doing? Alexander asked. We already discussed that I need to remain private. It would be dire to have a reporter see the real Mansion and discover the real me.\\n\\n Then he wont meet the real youor the real Mansion. But we cant put him off. He could write anything.\\n\\n So what is your big plan?\\n\\n He was snooping around anywaywho knows what he might say on his own. We have to show him youre just like everyone else. Mortal.\\n\\n But youve invited him here. And why in two days? We might as well get it over with.\\n\\n He doesnt need to see the whole house. Just the first floor.\\n\\n Have you seen the first floor? I said. It would make a ghost scream.\\n\\n Sebastian thought for a moment. Not when it gets a Sebastian Camden makeover. It will look like everyone elses home. And you wont be bothered again.\\n\\n \\n\\n Alexanders stern mood quickly lightened up.\\n\\n Theres a reason hes my best friend, he said, slapping his arm around Sebastians shoulder. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-10.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) \\n As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
