{"id":82776,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I opened my eyes to find myself lying flat on the grass. Alexander was kneeling beside me. A large circle of familiar facesBecky, Matt, Onyx, Sebastian, Scarlet, Trevor, Jagger, and Lunawere staring down at me. The stars shimmered and a full moon hovered above them. It had to be a dream. I closed my eyes again. Lets give her some air, I heard a girls voice say. Did you drink too much? another asked. Did she take something? Did she OD? someone else said. My mouth was dry. I couldnt form a word in my defense. Ill take her to a doctor, Alexander said, alarmed. Here, drink this, Becky said, handing me a soda. Alexander helped me sit up, and I gulped down the bubbly liquid as if I hadnt drunk for days. Scarlet held a bag of ice on my head. Did you eat something odd? Becky asked like a ponytailed Florence Nightingale. NoI havent eaten anything, I replied, weakened. The crowd of well-wishers stopped fussing. What? Alexander asked. You havent eaten? I didnt have time. I was decorating for the party all day. Not even breakfast? Scarlet asked. No. Then no wonder you fainted, Becky said. Alexander signaled to Sebastian, who took off for the Mansion. My boyfriend swept me up in his arms and carried me to the table. He gently let me down in a wrought-iron chair and held my hand while I drank my soda. A few moments later, Jameson pushed a small cart through the crowd of partygoers. The scent of marinated steak was intoxicating to the mortals and euphoric to the vampires. A thick, juicy steak was placed before me. All the vampires, including Alexander, almost salivated. Ill do that, Scarlet said as I began to cut into the bloody steak. Its for Raven, Alexander said gently. The vampires watched with envy as I tore into my meal. As I wolfed down the steak and began to regain my strength, Alexander began to address the next issue we had on our handsbloodsucking party crashers. The candelabras lit Jaggers menacing ice-green-and-blue eyes. His sister stood behind him, basking in the glow of stares from the male partyers. I dont remember inviting Alexander said. Some girls have looser lips than others, Jagger said. Onyx appeared ashamed. Perhaps its time we mingle, Scarlet said. She led Onyx into the crowd. We didnt think youd mind, Jagger said to Alexander. Now that we are friends. Alexander was skeptical. Though their feud had ended when Alexander returned Jaggers weakened brother, Valentine, to him, Alexander wasnt expecting his longtime nemesis to instantly replace Sebastian. Friends? Alexander said. Yes, Jagger said. One can never have too many, right? I suppose you are right, but There really is safety in numbers, Jagger urged. Besides, we have so much in common: Romania, vampires, and Raven. Raven? Alexander asked suspiciously. I saw a lot of her recently, Jagger proclaimed, referring to my attendance at the Coffin Club. She fit right in. I heard, Alexander said. No one knew she was any different. Did she tell you? She didnt have to. I was hoping to see her there again, Jagger continued. It seemed she got on as well as any of the members there. She is planning on being here, Alexander said. I was hoping youd come back, Jagger said to me. But since you didnt, this way weve come to you. How sweet, I retorted. I think well be fast friends, Alexander, Jagger said. Its something Ive always wanted. There is so much we can learn from each other. Jagger gestured to the party. There is safety in numbers. We could use more members and, with your help, perhaps start a club here. Out of the question! Alexander said. Nothing you have to decide now, my friend, Jagger said calmly. But imagineIf all these mortals were just like us, then think of what could bewhat we could do. A town in which you dont have to hide out in a Mansion, all alone. I think its time you leave, Alexander demanded. But we just got here, Jagger said. Youre right. Im getting ahead of myself. Im just a visionary, thats all. Nothing you need to commit to this minute. Besides, Jagger continued, we came to party. And Luna was very eager to see Raven. So how have you been, Raven? she asked, ¨¹ber-polite. Besides lying flat on your back, she whispered in my ear. Luna was still bitter toward me for fooling her into believing I was a vampire. And even more so because Alexander had jilted her at the covenant ceremony back in Romania and he had found happiness with me. However, seeing Luna standing here today, glowing like an angel, I couldnt imagine him ever leaving her. Alexander, Luna said in a soft, sexy voice. Its great to see you. She showed off her dress for him. A group of jocks ogled her as she twirled around. Its amazing how much a person can change in just a short time, isnt it? Im sorry for you that things in your life have remained the same. Alexander wasnt pleased with her taunting. Yes, doesnt my sister look great? Jagger said. This lifestyle suits her. Shes been dying for it since she was born. Im glad you are so happy, Alexander said. Thats all I ever wanted for you. He turned back to the party. Luna took Alexanders comment as a slap in the face instead of a heartfelt sentiment. She couldnt mask her scorn and turned her venom on me. I see youve managed to fool some other girls, too, she said, referring to Onyx and Scarlet. They like me for who I am, I said. But do you like yourself as you are? Or, at the end of the day, do you really wish you were more like me? Luna was right. She had the one thing I didnt haveshe was a vampire. I have everything youve always wanted, she bragged. Except Alexander, I snapped back. Well, when you can be here for an eternity, everything is possible. I just need time. I wasnt happy with her insinuation. When he sees my potential. Perhaps what he is missing from a relationship with youWho knows what he might do? With that, she and Jagger joined the other partygoers. Alexander, I said, getting his attention, Luna isnt over you. She still cant be trusted. Her bark is worse than her bite. Im serious. Shes still in love with Hey, Sebastian said, suddenly by our side. This party is killer! You think so? I asked. Its not what I planned. Im even amazed. Alexander beamed. This mansion is going to be party central, said Sebastian. The girls think you are a rock star, and I dont mind taking your leftovers. I glared at Sebastian. I mean, taking them off your hands so you can be alone with Raven. A band of jocks bumped into the tomb-shaped table, knocking it over. Alexander rushed to help steady it. There is no reason you need to be cruising this crowd, I told Sebastian. There are two perfect and single girlsthat were just meant for you, I said as the ultimate matchmaker. Onyx or Scarlet. I know, Raven. They are beautiful, but there arent any sparks. What do you mean? You just met them. And now you are totally ignoring them. You need to spend more time with them. Its just something I feelor rather dont feel. And by the way it looks, they dont seem to be bothered. Trevor was talking to Jagger, and Onyx and Scarlet were by their sides. Well, maybe Im not meant to be in love, he said. Maybe Im supposed to just have fun. And is that so bad? I was a major failure at matchmaking. This was not supposed to happen! I said. None of this was supposed to happen! I ditched Sebastian and was heading toward Alexander when Becky jumped in front of me. Where have you been? she asked. This night has gone all wrong, I said frantically. No it hasnt. Look! Everyone is enjoying themselves. You might be having the best party Dullsvilles ever seen. Sebastian was supposed to like Scarlet or Onyx and he doesnt like either, I rambled, and to top it off, Scarlet seems to be struck by Trevorgag meand Onyx is smitten by Jagger. Its nice that they came to town for your party. Jagger and Luna werent invited. Remember? You werent even invited. Becky laughed. Raven, youve brought the whole town togethereven a neighboring one. But I didnt want to. Even Jameson is freaking out. He was standing guard outside the kitchen door. I have to do something. I know I took out my phone. Ill call the police. A noise complaint and a few squad cars are enough to drive everyone back to their sprawling estates. Becky stopped me. Raventhen Alexanders party will be a bomb. Look at him. Alexander was joking with the group of jocks as they replaced the items on the table. He was as content and happy as hed been when he was out with Sebastian and me. Wouldnt you rather the party be a hit than have your boyfriend stuck in his attic room forever alone? I weighed my friends thoughts heavily. Then what should I do? I finally asked. How about have some funlike everyone else? Why should you be the only one moping? Becky didnt understand the severity of the situation. And it wasnt something I could delicately break to her over the sounds of pounding music. However, it was Alexanders mansion, and if Alexander was having a blast, then it wasnt my place to break up the party. Alexander was now hanging out by the fire pit with Matt, Sebastian, and several soccer snobs. I was approaching him when I overheard a few cheerleaders talking to him. Are you the painter in the article? one asked. Uhyes. I like to model, another told him. Do you do nude portraits? the first one asked. The girls all laughed. I was steaming! My blood began to boil and my whole body raged. There is only one model I use, Alexander said. And her name is Raven, they said in unison. Yes, he said. A warm feeling flooded me. Perhaps you should get to know her, he said. Shes a great girl. The girls all turned their noses at him and walked away. I snuck up behind my boyfriend and gave him a huge embrace. There you are, he said. I was just talking about you. You have groupies, I said. Sebastian was right. No I dont, he said humbly. He drew me close and kissed me by the open flames. I never dreamed wed have a hit on our hands, I said. I never did, either, he said. Jagger and Onyx and Luna joined us by the fire pit. Jagger Maxwell, Sebastian said, a drink in his hand. Its been a while since Ive seen you. This is the last place Id imagine bumping into you. Jagger moved in close, out of earshot of the soccer snobs and Matt. Alexander and I have to make up for lost time. I thought now was as good a time as any to begin our new friendship. Alexander is really picky about who he hangs out with, Sebastian said protectively. Im sure he is. Rumor is you havent returned to Romania, Sebastian said. I started a club a few towns over. Ive been talking to Alexander about possibly starting one here. This town could really use a club, Sebastian said. Jaggers blue-and-green eyes lit up. Then you might be the one to help me. I love clubs. And youre rightthis town could be a perfect place to open one. You dont know what hes really talking about, Alexander warned. Perhaps we can go into business together, Jagger said to Sebastian. Maybe Luna yawned and appeared bored. Luna, Jagger said, seizing the opportunity. I want you to meet Alexanders best friend. Alexanders best friend? she asked, perking up. I dont believe weve met. No, I think Id remember, Sebastian said, tonguetied. She grew up on a different time schedule than we did. But now we are all finally the same, Jagger said. Luna, Sebastian might be interested in starting a Coffin Club here. No hes not, Alexander said. He doesnt know what you are talking about. Sebastian was lost in Lunas spell, even though she was somewhat intimidating. Any friend of Alexanders is a friend of mine, right, Alexander? Luna flirted. Lets hope so, Sebastian said. Suddenly this party doesnt seem so insipid after all, she commented. I tried to block Sebastian from Luna. I think Jameson needs our help in the kitchen. Jameson can find someone else, Luna said, gazing at Sebastian. Its a party, the night is young, and Im out for blood. Would you like to dance, Sebastian? Luna asked. Are you kidding? Sebastian looked as if he would have breathed in garlic if Luna had asked him. So tell me what it was like growing up with Alexander, Luna said, leading him to the dance floor. Jagger smiled a mischievous smile. Onyx, would you like to dance? Onyx acted as if shed just been struck by Cupids bow. Of course, she said, and followed Jagger. Alexanderwhat do we do? How about we dance, too? When we arrived on the dance floor, Alexander and I kept a watchful eye on the others. But after a few songs, we got distracted by our own connection. This was the reason to have a party, Alexander said, kissing me. For us. I was so lost in his eyes. Id gotten so sidetracked that I wasnt allowing myself to enjoy the very thing Id been dreaming about all my life: Alexander Sterling. I still want to be like you, I said. I want to be with you. Forever. Alexander pulled me into him and laid a dizzy-making kiss on my lipsso passionate and tender, my knees shook. Luna bore a gaze that blazed through us. Becky and Matt applauded, and we got a few whistles. Alexander and I embraced, and Luna left the dance floor. How about a slow one? Matt suggested. He fiddled with the sound system until he found a song he liked. The four of us danced, joined by Dullsvillian student couples. When the song was over, I was jolted out of our romantic entanglement. The Pradabees were with the other Pradabees, and the soccer snobs were mixing it up with the cheerleaders. Trevor was flirting with Scarlet, and Onyx was hanging next to Jagger. Wheres Sebastian? I asked. Hes probably in mortal babe heaven, Alexander said. I appreciate all youve done for him. Me? It was nothing. One other partygoer was not accounted for. Luna was missing. That could mean only one thing. Trouble. It was late. Bottles and trash littered the backyard of the Mansion. Alexander and I forced our way through the reveling students. A large crowd had gathered around the gazebo. I pushed through to find Luna, several soccer snobs, and Sebastian sitting in a circle. In the center, resting on its side, was the empty Transylvania 1972. The students, unbeknownst to them, were playing a deadly game of spin the bottle. We have to stop them, I said. The game seems quite uneven. She must be up to something, Alexander said. The crowd was hooping and hollering, and several guys had formed a line vying for a seat in the circle. Were waiting our turn, a guy said to me. Luna spun the bottle, and it landed on a soccer snob. On the cheek, please, she said. Are you kidding? Forget it. He got up and walked away. She spun again. It landed on another soccer snob. On the cheek, please. He gently gave her a slobbering kiss on the cheek, to the crowds delight. She made a face and wiped it off with her sleeve. Luna twirled the bottle again. It landed on Sebastian. On the cheek, I know, he said. Luna made a deadly stare at Alexander, then gazed at Sebastian. On the neck, please, she said coyly. Sebastian was stunned, and the crowd cheered. She stood up and flipped back one of her pink Wednesday Addams braids to expose her porcelain flesh. Luna put her waify arms around Sebastians waist. We have to stop this, I said to Alexander. Hes going to bite her! He better not! Alexander charged forward, but the cheering crowd grew larger, blocking our path to the gazebo. Sebastian grinned and began to lean in to Luna. I squeezed myself in between a pair of petite cheerleaders. Sebastian smiled, revealing two shiny fangs. Lunas eyes closed and she leaned back with delight. No! I screamed. I jumped between Sebastian and Luna, but at the last moment someone pulled me back. It was Jagger. What are you doing? voices from the crowd yelled at me. Alexander and I were mortified. Sebastian was smiling, and Luna was holding her neck, grinning. She removed her hand. Tiny drops of blood trickled down her neck. Sebastian turned to me and Alexander, his eyes hazy and his fangs red. He wiped his hand over his mouth and pulled Alexander close. I think Im in love, he declared. And this time its for real.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-16.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
