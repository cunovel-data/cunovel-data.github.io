{"id":82765,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The following morning, I was lumbering around my room in a towel and Jack Skellington slippers like a lost zombie, vacuously trying to figure out what to wear to school, when I heard Becky repeatedly blast her trucks horn. I threw on the first thing I saw, a charcoal-colored T-shirt dress, and layered it with a ripped Wicked Wiccas tank, gathered my backpack, and haphazardly dragged myself out of my house. When I got into her truck, Becky was sporting an overblown grin.\n Whats up? I asked.\n He texted me like a hundred times. She blurted out the words as if shed been holding them in for a decade.\n Who? I asked. But I already knew the answer. Sebastian?\n She tried to hide the smile that crept across her face by chewing on her sparkling pink lip and drove us toward school. How did you know?\n A hundred? I asked flatly.\n Wellnot exactly. But Im going to have to buy more minutes.\n What did he say?\n He wanted to know what I was doingwhat I liked to dowhat were my favorite flowers. Becky beamed.\n Did you answer?\n I did until Matt texted in. Then I told him I had to go.\n You shouldnt be texting Sebastian.\n \n Why?\n Why? Because you have a boyfriend.\n I know that. But its no big deal.\n Are you kidding? Becky was as serious as she was naive. She was so amazed that Matt liked her, she couldnt fathom that another guy might possibly feel the same. Texting another guy? In some countries you could be jailed.\n Raven, I think youre totally overreacting.\n Me? Overreact? Promise me you wont text him anymore.\n He was just being nice.\n Hes not being nice. Hes dangerous, I blurted out.\n Hes a criminal? Becky squealed.\n Of course not, I said, and sighed.\n \n Becky was being unusually stubborn. I knew it was because she simply didnt think I wasnt going to leave her in the dark anymore. I had to use all my ammunition.\n Hes dangerous for different reasons than you think. Hes in love with you!\n Becky almost slammed on the brakes. Youre joking.\n Noits true.\n No ones ever been in love with me. Not even Matt.\n What? Of course Matt loves you.\n Well, hes never said it.\n I was surprised. I figured Matt told her all the time, as Alexander told me.\n Are you sure?\n Yes, Im sure. I would have told you the minute he told me.\n \n I just assumed he already had. But clearly, he doesnt need to. Its written all over his face.\n You think so? she asked with doughy eyes. You know how I feel about him.\n Of course he loves you. Thats why you have to stay away from Sebastian. So you dont spoil your relationship with Matt.\n Id never let that happen. But I dont believe you about Sebastian. Truly, he was being totally innocent.\n Guys dont want to be just friends. Havent you seen When Harry Met Sally?\n No.\n Well, perhaps its time you watched it.\n Ill rent it tonight.\n Perfect. Then were done with the subject, I ordered. Hes supposed to be leaving soon anyway, so theres no need to mention his name.\n Mention whose name? she asked with a cute grin.\n Becky parked the truck in the student parking lot. We dashed up the front stairs through the bustling hallways and hurried to our lockers. She opened hers to find a glass vase tied with a white ribbon and filled with tiny pink roses.\n WowMatt never gave me roses before, she exclaimed. Didnt I tell you I had the best boyfriend ever?\n My stomach tied itself in a bigger knot than was on her bow.\n My guess is they arent from him, I mumbled.\n What?\n Uhnothing. Is there a card?\n Oh She picked through the flowers. Here it is. Until we meet againSebastian, she read aloud. Sebastian? My best friend was as shocked as she was flattered. She stuck the card back in the vase.\n Suddenly Matt appeared behind us. Becky gasped and turned corpse white.\n Did you miss me last night? he asked with a churlish wink.\n I did, I said truthfully.\n Thanks, Raven.\n Becky tried to envelop the flowers in her unbuttoned paisley cardigan, but her sweater was too small and a few buds peeked out from her neckline.\n Where did you get those? Matt asked. You dont have a secret admirer, do you?\n Becky froze. She never lied to Mattor anyone, for that matter.\n They are mine actually, I fibbed for her. She was holding them while I shut my locker. I held out my hand.\n \n Becky opened her sweater and I took the vase.\n The bell rang and Mrs. Hathaway, our history teacher, opened the door for class.\n I didnt think pink was your color, Matt said, bewildered.\n UhIts not. Im regifting.\n I cant believe youd give away flowers from Alexander, he charged.\n They arent from him I said, trying to defend my actions. Then I realized what Id said.\n Matt spotted the card poking out of the vase. He snatched it before I could stop him.\n Sebastian? he read. Alexanders friend? Why is he giving you flowers?\n My horror story was spinning out of control. I wasnt even sure what I was saying anymore.\n Uhwere going to be late for class, I said.\n Yes, Becky agreed. She took Matts hand and led him into class before our story got any more fictional.\n I handed Mrs. Hathaway the bouquet. She was quite surprised and a little skeptical of my gift but happily placed the vase on her desk.\n Becky and I glared at the bouquet. Even under normal circumstances I couldnt focus too long on history. Now, with Sebastians roses prominently displayed in class, both Becky and I were distracted. For once, neither of us learned a thing.\n The sky over Dullsville was picture perfectbeautifully blue and dotted with bright, puffy clouds. It didnt match the storm I felt brewing inside me during lunch as Matt questioned Becky and me about Sebastian on the bleachers.\n I have to meet this dude, Matt said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Hes either a real gentleman or a real snake.\n \n Giving flowers to another guys girl? If he did that to my girlfriend, Id have to take him out.\n Matt had grown up as Trevors shadow. Now that hed broken away from Trevors clutches and started dating Becky, he showed a confidence I didnt know existed. That said, he still was far from the type of guy to throw the first punchor the last, for that matter.\n Why dont we talk about something else? I suggested. I was trying to eat organic peanut butter and jelly on a million-grain roll my mother had bought at some overpriced health food store. Becky fingered her gluten- and flour-friendly roast beef sandwich. She noticed my distaste and happily traded lunches with me.\n Does Alexander know Sebastian gave you flowers? Matt asked skeptically.\n No, he doesnt, I said.\n Are you going to tell him?\n UhI guess.\n \n I think its important to be honest in a relationship, Matt said. Becky and I always tell each other everything. No secrets.\n Becky hid her face in her hands. Matt, theres something you should know\n Did I tell you Sebastian wont be in town much longer? I suddenly asked. Hes just passing through. So surely we can talk about something else.\n Becky paused. Yes, she agreed. Lets talk about\n Thats a shame, Matt said. I would like to meet Alexanders best friend. I imagine hes pretty cool. Whats he into?\n Hes into Becky, I wanted to say.\n Gaming, Becky said. He looks like a modern-day pirate, she said, half dreaming. All he is missing is an eye patch and a pegleg.\n Maybe I should be the one worried about him honing in on my girlfriend.\n Matt gave her a bear hug as she blushed.\n How about the five of us hang out tomorrow? he continued. The team is going to Hooligans and you guys can come, too.\n Hooligans was a grown-up version of Chuck E. Cheesewithout the oversized rat. Id gone there on a few occasions when Billy was still being called Nerd Boy. My little brother loved the video games and I loved a night out.\n I wasnt sure if Hooligans was going to be Alexander and Sebastians idea of fun, but I was more concerned with Becky being in the magnetic vampires presence again.\n Id rather spend time with just us, Becky said. I havent seen you\n Yeahthe guys have been keeping late nights, I said truthfully. They might want a night off. And more important, who wants to see Trevor?\n Its a big place. You wont even run into him, Matt said encouragingly. Besides, if Sebastian is leaving, when will you get a chance to see him again? Matt asked, excited by his idea.\n I was hoping not anytime soon, Becky whispered to me.\n Awesome, Matt declared. Well meet this week. But Im warning you, Raven, if you open your locker this afternoon and find a ring, then Im telling Alexander.\n As soon as the sun set, I hopped on my bike and motored toward the Mansion. It was imperative I get to Alexander posthaste, and this time I wasnt going to let anyone stand in my waynot even a handsome soccer snob. I was fortunate that all I had to dodge were a few cars and a woman walking her poodle.\n I pounded on the door until Jameson politely let me in. I paced on the squeaky parlor floorboards for what seemed like an hour until Alexander finally entered the room.\n Alexander was dreamy, standing in the doorway, his long black hair tousled and slightly damp from his shower.\n You have to talk to him, I exclaimed. I have to talk to him.\n \n What? Talk to who? he asked.\n Sebastian, I said, racing over to him.\n I was so harried, the note card fell out of my hoodie pocket and onto the floor. Alexander picked it up before I could place my boot over it.\n Until we meet againSebastian? he read aloud.\n Alexanders dark eyes turned angry red. What is my best friend doing giving you cards? he asked, his brow furrowing.\n It wasnt a card, Alexander. It was flowers.\n Alexander looked shocked, then angry. He couldnt hide a feeling of betrayal as his expression tightened. Sebastian! he began to call.\n I grasped his arm. They werent for me.\n Then who were they for? he asked skeptically.\n \n Becky. He texted her all night and then had roses waiting for her in her locker.\n Alexander was only partially relieved. Now he was confused. Why would he do that? he asked softly.\n You heard him last night. He said he loved her.\n I know, but I didnt think he meant it. Besides, hes copying my moves. Leaving surprises in your lockerwell, Beckys.\n He has to stop, Alexander. Becky isnt used to this kind of attention. And he is, after all\n Like me? he asked with a hint of sadness.\n No one is like you, I said, taking his hand.\n Sebastian has never acted like this before.\n To make matters worseMatt wants to meet him. He has no idea the flowers were for her. He thinks they were for me.\n \n Who gave him that idea? he asked, slightly accusatory.\n Well\n So now everyone at school thinks my best friend is hitting on my girlfriend?\n First of all, hes not. And second, no one knows.\n Youre sure?\n Of course. How would they, anyway? No one talks to mejust about me.\n He glanced away. I knew it was painful for Alexander to imagine me at school without him. I just wish\n Just say the word and Ill quit, I said, wide-eyed.\n Before Alexander could remind me of the importance of my education, I pulled him close. Matt wants the five of us to go to Hooligans.\n \n Jameson shuffled into the room with a tray of two bloodred smoothies, each garnished with a tiny blue plastic sword and three cherries. Alexander took one and I picked up the other.\n Jamesons bulging eyes bulged out even more. Miss Raven, that is for\n Ill save you the trip.\n I marched up the staircase, followed by Alexander, careful not to spill the bloody concoction, and pressed my ear to Sebastians bedroom door. I could hear the sounds of footsteps on the squeaky floors, followed by a thud.\n Room service, I called.\n The door creaked open. Sebastians hair was sticking up like a starburst. He was sitting on his closed coffin in boxers, a black wrinkled shirt, and unlaced boots and was staring at the cell phone in his hand. Socks, T-shirts, and bandannas were scattered around his coffin like the dirt from his homeland.\n \n What happened to you? Alexander asked.\n I didnt sleep. Ive been up all day.\n Well, heres your breakfast, I offered, almost shoving the drink at him.\n Im not thirsty.\n Oh, yes you are. I need you well nourished.\n He examined the smoothie and fiddled with the tiny sword.\n Try it, youll like it, I encouraged him.\n He made a face. Anybody, is there a vein in the house? he called.\n Alexander laughed.\n It was never fun dining with the Sterlings, Sebastian continued. When the Camdens had people over for dinnerwe really had them for dinner, he joked like a vaudevillian comic.\n \n Drink up, I demanded.\n I watched Sebastian as the red liquid slowly made its way up the straw, past his full lips, and into his mouth.\n I thought hed be repulsed, as one would be tasting sour milk. But he appeared to enjoy it just as any mortal might a strawberry shake.\n Raven tells me you sent flowers to Becky at school? Alexander asked.\n I didnt send them, he emphasized.\n Whateverhowever, Alexander said. The point is\n I know. Its justIve never felt this way. Really. I see how you two are. I feel that way about Becky.\n May I remind you that Becky has a boyfriend? I said firmly.\n What would you have done if you thought Raven had a boyfriend?\n \n Sebastian challenged Alexander.\n Alexander had experienced that kind of situation when he saw me with Trevor outside the Mansion last Halloween. My boyfriend thought carefully before he spoke. Its not the point what Id do.\n See? Sebastian said. I cant forget her. Besides, people break up all the time.\n Becky and Matt will never break up. I hadnt imagined that scenario before, and I shuddered at the thought. Shes going to get married to him.\n Married? Shes still in high school.\n When she gets out. And she certainly isnt going to date a vampire!\n They both looked at me. I had just stuck my combat-booted foot in my black-lipsticked mouth.\n I mean that in a good way, I said. Im the one who likes vampires, I declared. But Becky has a thing for mortals.\n \n I\u0027m sorry, Raven, I cant change my feelings, Sebastian said sincerely. What am I supposed to do? he asked with an almost childlike quality.\n You can change what you do about them, Alexander said. Ravens right. You have to back off.\n Sebastian cooled down. I know. I just couldnt sleep all daywaiting and wondering when I could see her again.\n Well, youll get to see her tomorrow night, Alexander revealed.\n Really?\n Matt wants the five of us to hang out, Alexander said.\n Whos Matt?\n Beckys boyfriend, I stressed\n Sebastian turned toward the window. The moonlight cast a glow against his sad and almost lonely expression.\n \n Perhaps once he saw how happy Becky was with Matt hed be cured of his feelings for her.\n Sebastian snapped back with a wicked grin. Great! Ill be on my best behavior. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-5.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) \n As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
