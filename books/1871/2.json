{"id":82762,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The following day, I was bursting to tell my best friend, Becky, the news of Alexanders surprise visitor. I waited impatiently by the swings in Evans Park until I finally saw her heading down the hill. Where have you been? I asked, catching up to her. I had to drive Matt to practice. I hate saying good-bye. And yet I love saying good-byeif you know what I mean. She giggled, still in swoon mode. I knew what she meant and how she felt about kissing her favorite guy. But for once, I had other things on my mind. I intently led her toward the bottom of the yellow plastic double-wide slide. Whats so urgent? she asked as we sat down. First it was Alexanders parents. Although you know I adored them. Yes. Whats up? Now Alexanders best friend has invaded the Mansion. Becky was puzzled. I didnt know he had a best friend. Neither did I. I sighed. WowAlexanders so mysterious. Evasive. Reclusive, she added. Tell me about it Just like a vampire, my best friend said. I think thats why hes the perfect match for you. You really think so? I asked. Of course. A perfect match? Or a vampire? A perfect match, silly. But if anyone was a vampireAlexander could be one. You think so? You honestly think so? I prodded. He is from Romania and has a butler. Come to think of it, Ive only seen him at night, she said, and laughed. And that garlic allergy But I wasnt laughing. Did I say something wrong? she asked. No. In fact, you said something right, I wanted to say. Could I finally bare all the secrets to my best friend? Would she realize this time that her statements were true, instead of laughing at me when I suggested the very same thing? At last Id be able to unleash the truth about Jagger, Luna, Alexanders parents, Onyx and Scarlet from the Coffin Club, and, most important, my boyfriend. The load Id been carrying in silence was too heavy on my temporarily rose-tattooed shoulders. I weighed my thoughts. If Becky knew Alexanders true identity, then shed surely blab the facts to Matt. I knew he was more tight-lipped than Becky. Guys didnt gossipI didnt even know Alexander had a best friend! But this news was bigger than a footnote to a byline. This was front-page Dullsville Gazette breaking news. Vampires Aliveor UndeadAtop Benson Hill. And if this information did slip out at practice or a game, then Trevor Mitchell would know. Not only would Alexander have to return to Romania, but it would be imperative that he never inhabit Dullsville again. Whats wrong? Becky asked. Alexander is a perfect match, I said with a sigh. I was just thinking how I didnt want Sebastian to crowd us. Thats totally normal. I get bummed when I have to share Matt with the entire soccer team. They talk about the most inane subjects, like ESPN and computer sports games. But I imagine Sebastian and Alexander are different from guys here. Is he an artist, too? I dont know. They probably talk about world events, she imagined aloud. I dont even know what they talk about, I answered, clueless. Well, whats he like? He is hottheres no doubt about that. But other than that, I dont know. Hes a total flirt and he likes electricity. Becky laughed. I think its a good thing. You can find out more about Alexander through him, she said. She had a point. Sebastian possibly held the key to the Alexander I never knew. For a moment, I lost myself in thought as I lay back on the slide. I imagined a young version of our goateed guest and Alexander having sleepovers in the cemetery, dining with Draculas descendants, or flying in bat form over European cities. Is he like Alexander? she asked, awaking me from my daydream. In some ways he isbut Im still not sure. Well, weve been friends forever and we arent the same. It should be exciting to see what hes all about. Was Sebastian a real romantic or was he a player? Did he have a menacing streak like Jagger or more noble intentions like my own boyfriend? I still cant believe that for so many years Trevor and Matt were best friends, Becky said to me, breaking me out of my fantasy. It really turns my stomach. But Im sure Sebastian is not like Trevor. Lets hope not. Becky and I were best friends but polar opposites. Were Alexander and his best friend like Matt and Trevor? I knew one thing for sureI couldnt wait to find out! Unlike when Alexanders parents arrived in town, Alexander wasnt keeping me a secret from Sebastian. I was invited to the Mansion as usual. Perhaps Sebastians arrival wasnt a bad thing after all. He could show me the side of Alexander Id never known, as Becky suggested. I biked over to the Mansion, hoping to get there just in time for the sun to set. I happily coasted down a hill and squeezed the brakes as I turned the corner to avoid any oncoming or parked cars. What I didnt anticipate was an obstacle of another kinda pack of runners. I barely avoided smacking into them and veered off into a small band of hedges instead. Watch where youre going, Monster Girl! I heard a male voice call. I withdrew my bike from the bush and picked a few leaves off my hoodie. Trevor stormed over to me, flanked by a few soccer snobs, and held the handlebars of my bike so I couldnt pass. Where are you off to in such a hurry? His stunning green eyes bore through me. A corpse convention? Even sweaty, Trevor was gorgeous. What are you running away from? I retorted. Your mirror? The soccer snobs laughed. Trevors already flushed face reddened like a sunburn. The Mansion loomed behind Trevor up ahead on Benson Hill, the sun moments from setting. I suggest you turn back now. Before its too late, he tried to warn as only an adversary could. When darkness falls, the monsters arise. The monster has already arisen, I said, in his face. And hes standing right in front of me. Trevors cohorts snickered again. How about I just take your bike then? He tried to wrestle the handlebars away from me, and for a moment the two of us struggled. Finally, I released my grip. Be my guest, I relented. Pedal your way back to practice on a girls bike. Im sure it will end up on YouTube. Trevor thought for a moment as his cohorts tried to hide their chuckles. My nemesis let my bike fall to the ground. We better get back. Its getting dark, one of the soccer snobs said. Trevor locked his gaze with mine. His torment was palpable. He owned a portrait Alexander had painted of methe only thing he could own of me. And as I stood before him, he strained with the knowledge that I was the only girl in town that he couldnt haveand perhaps the only one he truly wanted. Get out of here already, he finally acquiesced. Run off to your little Monster Boy, freak. I dusted myself off and picked up my bike. Id have felt sorry for Trevor if he didnt bring his own torment on himself. I pushed past my nemesis and the other runners, and we both headed off in opposite directions. I pedaled through the darkness as fast as possible. I didnt want to miss any precious moments with Alexander and Sebastian. I felt as if I were hauling my bike up a ski hill. Exhausted, I barely had enough strength to bang on the Mansions door. I was still out of breath and perhaps a little disheveled when Jameson let me in. Good evening, Miss Ravenare you all right? Jameson stood crisp and creepy in his gray butlers uniform. Yes, I said. Ive never been better. Are you sure? His voice and expression were kind and sincere. I guess I appeared worse for the wear. Had there been mirrors in the Mansion, I might have been able check out my appearance. Out of respect for the Mansions inhabitants, I didnt dare open Rubys compact, nestled in my purse. Instead, I just combed my hair with my fingers and tried to straighten my outfit. I believe they are upstairs, Jameson directed. I hurried up the creaking staircase. I passed Sebastians new accommodations and peeked in. The once-barren room was a messclothes, CDs, and games were strewn all over the hardwood floor. It appeared as if hed been living there for decades. His coffin was finished, and the lid was closed and topped with junk. The sides of the coffin were adorned with stickers of global citiesLisbon, Beijing, Romelike a giant suitcase. I could hear the sounds of battle coming from down the hall. I headed into the TV room to find Sebastian stretched out, his boots propped up on the coffee table, gaming console in one hand and a cell phone in the other. Two knights were jousting on the screen. Alexander saw me in the doorway. He immediately rose and greeted me with concern. Sebastian didnt budge but took Alexanders absence as an opportunity and whacked his blue knights sword against Alexanders unprotected red knight. Are you okay? Alexander asked. Are you okay? I asked. I think he just flattened you. Oh, thatits only a game. Do I look that awful? I asked, suddenly self-conscious. You have leaves in your hair. I thought I got them out. I did my best to smooth out my hair. What happened? Alexander asked, picking out the remaining leaves. I bumped into Trevor. Alexanders sweet expression furrowed. In the woods? Did he hurt you? Ill NoI just hit a bush. I should have hit him instead, I teased. Alexander shook his head. I knew he was tormented, just like Trevor, but for different reasons. Alexander felt the need to protect me from all evilvampire and mortal. He was tortured, knowing that during the daylight hours it wasnt possible for him to safeguard me against my nemesis. Ill pick you up from now on, he firmly instructed. When my parents put me under curfew, I rebelled. However, when Alexander was overprotective, it made my heart race. Trevorwhos Trevor? Sebastian finally said, pausing the game and typing on his cell phone. Though the Mansion was as decayed as an ancient ruin, I was disappointed with Sebastians lack of refinement. Instead of behaving like a guest, he was sitting like he was in a fraternity house, scuffing the already antique coffee table with his shoes. I wasnt Miss Manners myself, and heaven knows I wouldnt have cared if Becky had put her John Deere, soil-stained boots on my bed. But this was the Mansion, after all, the house of my dreams, and, more important, Alexanders home. I spotted a beat-up old ottoman in the corner and scooted it in front of him. You might be more comfortable, I said graciously. Thanks, he said. Now I feel like a king. I can see why you like it here, he said to Alexander. I didnt know if he was sincere or making a snide remark. Alexander sat on the couch, and I curled up next to him. I was curious about this friend who seemed like the opposite of Alexander. So how do you like it here so far? I asked. Awesome, now that Ive found a room with outlets. And I cant believe Alexander still doesnt have a cell phone. How do you two communicateby smoke signals? Excuse me? I asked defensively. Its okayhes just joking, Alexander reassured me. Oh, I said, relieved. My first response was to protect Alexander. I hadnt been exposed to anyone before who amiably ribbed my boyfriend. So who are you texting? A girlfriend? I wondered aloud. One of many, Alexander said. A lady in every town. It must be nice to receive steamy texts, I hinted to Alexander. Id cherish every one. Alexander only shook his head. Ohyeah, Sebastian said. Im being rude, arent I? After a few clicks, he closed his phone. Sebastian sat up, now ready for conversation. So, what did you do all day? he asked. Soak up the sun? Hardly. I was stuck in school. How about you? Well, my day started about two minutes ago. Yes, thats what I figured. Soits really cool you came to town. I havent met any of Alexanders friends. He likes to keep us hiddenlike tucked away in a vault somewhere. So do you live in Romania, too? I inquired. Yes. We lived next door to each other. I imagined two Gothic mansions resting on top of a large mountain surrounded by fog, witchlike trees, and a ghostly cemetery and protected by a full moon. I guess you didnt live in the suburbs? I asked. Not exactly. Do you live in a mansion, too? I guess. I never thought about it really. It was just our home. But we had lights, he said, giving Alexander a verbal jab. Do you know Jagger and Luna? Vaguely. I wasnt there for that whole covenant thing. I crossed paths with Jagger, but Luna was a mortalso I never saw her. My family travels a lot. Are they art dealers like Alexanders? Nothey are pilots. Are they all But before I could say vampires, Alexander placed his hand on mine. So many questions. Dont you want to save a few? he hinted politely. Finally, a woman who is interested in me for a change, Sebastian said coyly. And a beautiful one, at that. He flashed a mesmerizing smile. So what do you want to know? Sebastian was charming, no doubt about it. But my interest was in Alexander. I wanted to know more about Sebastian but even more about my own handsome boyfriend. Are you homeschooled like Alexander? Yes. But we took night classes together. We had to take a few for exams. Alexander helped me pass themwithout knowing it. So what was Alexander like? I think its time we figure out what were going to do, Alexander interjected. Sebastian ignored his host. Ahthats the real question. About Alexander. You were working your way through me to get to him, werent you? he asked. Its okay. Im used to it. Alexander always got the girls, he revealed. Oh, really? I asked. I couldnt bear to imagine Alexander with any other girl than me. I felt a sword of jealousy pierce straight through my heart. Something about long hair and being an artist, Sebastian added. I bit my black lip. Alexander shot Sebastian a cold stare. Maybe we should go, I said. Dont worry, Sebastian said sweetly. He broke many hearts. Thats why I had to check out the girl who made him stay. Most keep him running. I felt relieved and flattered at the same time. So what about you? I asked. Where is your girlfriend? Me? he asked. I dont have one. I figured with all your travels, I said. True love has always eluded me, he confessed. He spoke in a charming and intimate tone, as if he was baring his heart for the first time. So, what are you looking for? I asked. Someone kind, sincere, and captivating. Someone unlike anyone else Ive ever met. Someone like Raven? Alexander said proudly, giving me a gentle squeeze. Yes, just like Raven. Sebastian grinned. But without the artistic boyfriend. Then Im sure you will find her, I reassured him. Sebastian gazed at me with a stare so bold, yet sincere, that tiny hairs rose on the back of my neck. I havent found her yet. But Im hoping my true love is closer than I think. Well, I hope you find her soon, I said. Alexander switched off the game and TV. Lets get something to eat. We all rose and collected our things. As Alexander returned the remote to the TV stand, Sebastian leaned toward me so closely his goatee brushed softly against my cheek. I hope I find her soon, too, Raven. He whispered in my ear with such intensity that chills raced down my spine. Im starved to death.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-2.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
