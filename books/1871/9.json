{"id":82769,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I met Alexander at the Evans Park covered bridge the following night. The old pedestrian bridge was unused and unkempt. Wooden slatted shingles worn off over the years had gone unfixed. Paint had chipped away. Even the birds nests were forgotten. I always thought the bridge was beautiful. A trickling creek ran beneath it and a tiny broken bench overlooked a dead bed of flowers. Tonight, however, I found the bridge decorated with twinkling yellow and white lights, which hung like sparkling icicles, making it a truly romantic and magical scene. I crept inside to find a table with a flickering candelabra on it and two champagne glasses filled with soda. Alexander emerged from the shadows, dreamy and gorgeous. I was breathless. There wasnt a place Id rather be than in Alexanders presence. I rushed to him and squeezed him with all my might. It seemed like ages since we had been alone, and I planned to take advantage of our solitude. My fingers begged to touch his skin, to feel my boyfriend close, sense his breath against mine. His strong hands grasped my smaller ones and he intently kissed them, as if he, too, had missed our moments together. I gently stroked his face and ran my fingers over his lips, my black nail polish in striking contrast to his alabaster skin and pale red mouth. Alexander and I had only a short time for our date. Becky was in the safe company of Matt and the soccer snobs at a scrimmage, and Jameson was doing his best to keep Sebastian entertained with a newly purchased Guitar Hero. I curled up in Alexanders arms. The electricity between the two of us seemed unbreakable. When he kissed my neck, I wondered if it was as much a torture for him as it was for me. Alexander had the power at any moment to turn mewhether I wanted him to or not. Was he thinking what it would be like to pierce his fangs into me and take my blood into his? But Alexander was thoughtful and cautious. If I were in the arms of another kind of vampire, perhaps like Jagger or Sebastian, I might have blood dripping down my neck. I wondered and admired how he could be so different. I dont know how you do it. Sebastian cant. Its not easy. Im sitting with the most gorgeous girl Ive ever seen in my life and she wants to be a vampire. I melted at his compliment. It seems easy to me. I couldnt help but want to be bittenif only to become a vampire before my best friend did. A few pings of raindrops began to hit the roof of the bridge. A few moments later, it began to pour. It only added to our magically romantic night. I snuggled even closer to Alexander. Imagine it, I began. Wed live in the Mansion together. Id make you smoothies, and if we ran outthen youd have me. Wed have a beautiful coffin together, I continued. Id decorate it with the most comfy pillows and blankets and tiny portraits that youd paint of us. And we could wire it so we could listen to morbidly melodic music. I could take you to Romania and you could see my home, Alexander added. We would dine outside on our balcony overlooking the twinkling city lights with my parents, and Id take you into town and wed dance until dawn. I was excited by Alexanders enthusiasm. Youd become a famous painter and Id be an editor of a gothic magazine, I continued. Wed travel to Paris for your showings and wed attend gothic fashion shows. Wed hang out all night long and sleep all day. But you do that now, he joked. By myself. But if I were like youwed never have to be apart again, I said. Wed be together, hidden away from the sunlight. And holding hands in the moonlight, he imagined. Youd never be alone. Not for a moment. Not for one moment? he asked coyly. Well, maybe one. If you wanted some space. Forget it, he assured me. Ive been waiting for you all my life. Alexander kissed me again. We wouldnt only have stolen moments like tonight, I urged. Wed be together longer. Raindrops continued to fall against the roof as he kissed my wrist. My vein showed prominently. Alexanders attention was drawn to my blue blood vessel. Are you ready? I asked. Were not on sacred ground, but we could go to the cemetery. We could finally be together. Alexander paused. He stared deeply into my eyes, and so intently, I felt as if I were staring back into his soul. Then suddenly he turned away. Its not fair, I said, clasping my hands. Sebastian wants to turn Becky and you dont want to turn me. Alexander sat up. First of all, he doesnt. He feels strongly for herand now that hes crossed the line hes put all of us in jeopardy. He tasted her blood. He has a stronger pull to her than he already had. It was a mistake to have brought up Sebastian. Now Id distracted Alexander from his thoughts about me. I know, I said. Its just that sometimes Raven, its hard enough for mewith you, as we are right now. I couldnt push him any further. Id already spoiled his mood and the gorgeous night hed created for me. I could tell he was just as concerned for Sebastian as he was for himself. I guess I shouldnt have let him in, he lamented. Are you kidding? Hes your best friend. Sebastian is a sweetie, I reassured Alexander. Hes much more impulsive than I am. Kind of like someone else I know, he said, lightening up. Hes just fallen for the wrong girl, I said with a sigh. Then we have to find someone else for Sebastian to fall for, Alexander thought aloud. Thats a great idea. He hasnt really had a steady girlfriend. Not only would this be helpful for Becky, but it would truly be helpful to him. I was so touchednot only that Alexander was concerned for the welfare of my best friend, but that he felt such responsibility and loyalty for his own. Another mortal? I asked. I thought about the Dullsvillian girls who had plagued me all my life. Theres a bunch of cheerleaders at school that I certainly wouldnt miss, I offered. But on second thought, I refuse to let one of them be turned before I am. No, my boyfriend said. She has to be a vampire. Im afraid Im short on vampire girls here, I said. But then I had a thought. But in Hipsterville, theres a whole club full! Alexander lit up. I know two very eligible ones. Onyx and Scarlet. One of them could be a perfect match! How do we get them here? he wondered aloud. That, I have no idea. Lets think. They are party girls, I said. Then well have a party. Thats awesome! I love parties. Though truth be told, I havent hosted manyor, in fact, any. No one would show up besides Becky. It will be a small, intimate gathering. Shall we have it at the cemetery? Alexander disagreed. Well have it at the Mansion. That way it will be discreet and no one will find out about it. I gave Alexander a huge hug. I was excited to be hosting a party and thrilled at the prospect of seeing Scarlet and Onyx again. But how are we going to invite them? he finally asked. I reached into my purse and took out my cell phone. I have them on speed dial. After a few minutes of canoodling, I strolled outside the covered bridge to get more light from the streetlamp. I avoided a few puddles, as the rain had ceased. I scrolled to Scarlets contact number and pressed send. The line began to ring. And ring. And ring. Is she there? Alexander asked impatiently. I shook my head. Just then, someone picked up. I could hear the pounding of loud music with overloaded bass in the background. Scarlet? I said. Hello? I barely heard her voice. Hello? Then the phone went dead. I dont think she wants to speak to me, I said. I think she probably cant hear you. That club can be deafening. Ill try again. I pushed redial and waited. This time she picked up right away. Raven, is that you? Yes! Can you hear me? Ravenis that you? Yes! I yelled. I think its Ravenbut I cant hear her, she said to someone. Scarlet? Onyx? Are you there? The call was dropped. All I heard was my own voice shouting. I guess well have to try later, Alexander said, resigned. He wiped off the damp bench with a tissue he had in his pocket and sat down. If she cant hear my invite, then maybe she can see it. What do you mean? I sat down next to Alexander and texted as fast as I could. He peered over my shoulder, curious. Onyx and Scarlet Mansion Mayhem! Mansion on top of Benson Hill only a few towns away. Saturday Night @ Sunset Raven Now what? he asked. We wait. How long? If she sees the message, it could be within a minute. If she doesnt, it could take days. We dont have days. I know. We sat in silence, his arm around me, my cell phone in my lap. We both were zoned out when we heard a few beeps. I showed Alexander my phone. Cant W8 2 party w/u! X, S \u0026 O Alexander gave me a huge squeeze, and we spent the rest of the evening pressed against each others black and pale red lips.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-9.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
