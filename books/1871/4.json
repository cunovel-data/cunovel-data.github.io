{"id":82764,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Alexander appeared confident and content in the company of our cryptic clique as we entered Hatsys Diner. He hummed Love Me Tender as Elviss voice crooned throughout the fifties-themed restaurant. Once again our odd threesome was met with glaring eyeballs, but my immortal companions appeared unaware. Sebastian seemed immediately taken with the charm and authenticity of the diner and was intrigued by the juke-boxes. While the vampires picked out a few songs, I found Becky sitting in a red vinyl booth, texting. I plopped down across from her. Wheres Matt? I asked. He has to study. But he says hello. She held her phone in front of my face. It displayed the words L8TR QT followed by Tel R Hi. I waved to the phone. Although I loved that Alexander was reclusive and shrouded himself in mystery, I did wonder what it would be like if Alexander had a phone and I could receive sweet nothings on my phoneLUV U LOTZ, Cant W8 2 C U, A X R. I had a million girlie texts from Becky and quite a few nagging ones from my mom but nothing close to the love notes Becky was receiving from Matt. Suddenly, Alexander and Sebastian were standing at our booth. Alexanders black hair hung sexily over his deep, dark eyes, his white collar perched up around his neck, and he wore a dark jacket and tight jeans. His Underworldly cohort, Sebastian, stood with his hands in his oversized pockets, sporting sparkling earrings and wildly woolly locks. Becky, I began. This is Sebastian. Sebastian and Becky locked eyes. They both froze for a moment that lingered like an extra heartbeat. There seemed to be an electric charge that surged between the two. His pale face flushed ruby red. She giggled without a sound. Come sit down, I said, hoping to sever their strange and sudden connection. Oh yeah, Sebastian said, as if coming out of a fog. Becky quickly shut her phone. Alexander scooted next to me and placed one hand on my red-and-black-striped tighted knee and the other around my shoulder. He smelled yummy in his lightly scented Drakkar, and my pulse quickened. Sebastian inched awkwardly onto the bench next to Becky. The seemingly self-assured guy appeared suddenly shy and smitten. He tucked his hair behind his ear and played with the rings on his fingers. Becky held her purse tightly in her lap like a childs teddy bear and nervously twisted the nylon strap. I hope youre hungry, I said, and handed Sebastian a menu that sat behind the tabletop jukebox. You know I am, he mumbled. Sebastian fidgeted in the booth and tapped his fingers against the menu. Becky avoided him by flipping through the jukebox songs. Dixie, a familiar waitress, came over. She wore her hair in a black beehive, and her curvy figure was squeezed into her white uniform like a forties pinup girls. When she wasnt reading a tabloid magazine at the soda counter, she was heckling her customers. She had a heart of gold but little patience for the teen clientele. Whatll you have? she asked. Sebastian hadnt had time to open his menu; he was too busy perusing Becky. What are you getting? he asked Alexander. The malts are fabulous, Alexander said. Order anything youd like, Sebastian, I said. Anything? Or anyone? Sebastian gave a cheeky wink to my best friend. Sebastian waited for her response. Embarrassed, Becky blushed and giggled. Sebastian took that as a positive sign and he, too, grinned. Alexander chuckled and I sneered. I was the only one not finding any humor in his comment. Four chocolate malts, four burgers, and two atomic fries, I said to Dixie. Sounds good to me, Becky said. How do you want the burgers cooked? Dixie cracked her gum so loud it sounded like a car backfiring. Rare, Sebastian said. Alexander kicked Sebastian underneath the table. Rare? Becky asked. We dont serve hamburgers rare here. With the tip of her pen she pointed to a small disclaimer on the bottom of the menu. This isnt a five-star restaurant, if you hadnt noticed. You can order your burgers burnt or not burnt. Then four not-burnt burgers, Alexander said with a grin. Dixie blew a pink bubble, winked at Alexander, and wiggled toward the kitchen. We all cracked up, and when our laughter subsided there was an awkward silence. Sebastian checked out Becky, which caused her to fiddle with her napkin. Alexander and Sebastian grew up together in Romania, I told her. Just like us, best buds. Thats great, Becky said demurely. She wrung the napkin again. Since no one else was talking and I was dying to find out more about Alexander, I figured this was as good a chance as any to steer the conversation in that direction. So what did you two guys do for fun in Romania? I asked. Alexander shrugged his shoulders. I dont knowwe just hung out. And played golf? I asked. No. Alexander laughed. We did the things kids do Yesbut you werent normal kids. Becky appeared puzzled. I mean, since Alexanders grandmother was a baroness, I said, covering my comments. Dixie returned with our shakes. Becky hid behind hers and the rest of us began to devour ours. Did you get into trouble? I asked. I did Sebastian said. But Alexander was always there to get me out of it. I nestled into my boyfriend. What do you do for fun? Sebastian asked Becky. Me? she asked, surprised the conversation was directed toward her. Yes. Becky leered at me as if I were going to answer for her. Sebastian waited, but Becky didnt answer. She just played with her straw. We do girlie things, I answered for her. Talk, gossip, and talk some more. Do you like cemeteries? he asked. Me? She shook her head vehemently. Was Alexander in his attic room painting like he is now? I asked. Uhyes. He always was working on some masterpiece. But he rarely showed me. He kept them hidden in an armoire in his room. Do you paint or draw? he asked Becky. NoIm not an artist. Did you guys go clubbing? I asked Sebastian. Sure, sometimes. Do you like to go out, Becky? Uhme? Alexander, I said, clearing my throat. I left something in the car. Can we go get it? Uhsure, my boyfriend replied. Sebastian reached into his back pocket and handed Alexander his keys. Once Alexander and I were outside Hatsys, I stopped. The car is over there, Alexander said. I didnt forget anything. I wanted to talk to you. Alexander was perplexed. What do you want to talk about? What is going on with Sebastian? What do you mean? Im trying to have a conversation with him and all he wants to do is talk to Becky. He doesnt mean anything by it. Hes just being polite. Does he think we were fixing him up? I asked. I dont think so. Well, he needs to back off. Dont you see the way hes staring at her? Hes hitting on her. I think you might be overthinking it, Alexander said soothingly. Did he ask me one question? I charged. Alexander paused. Is that what this is about? That hes not paying attention to you? he asked sweetly. He doesnt always have the best manners. I do try to tell him. NoI dont care that he doesnt ask me. But perhaps it did bother me. Maybe I was getting wrapped up in his attention toward Becky. Maybe I was oversensitive to his advances since they were not directed toward me. I felt like a heel, accusing Alexanders friend of preying on Becky. Okay, okay. I guess Im just being overprotective of Becky, like you are of me. When we returned, Sebastian was holding Beckys hand and reading her palm. This is your life lineand this is your love line. He was seductively tracing her lines with his finger. Very strong indeed. See? I whispered to Alexander. Now Ill show you mine. He scooted closer to her and held out his palm. Becky giggled uncontrollably. She glanced at a long line running through his hand. She had a quizzical look on her face. Wowyour life line seems to go on forever. Now Alexander wasnt pleased with Sebastians flirting. How about you tell them about the time you drove your Mustang through the cemetery and it almost fell into an empty grave, Alexander prompted his friend, taking charge of the situation. Just then Dixie arrived with a tray full of food. Sebastian tore into his burger while Becky picked at her fries. I could tell she wanted to say something to Sebastian. Normally, Becky was painfully shy, but with Sebastians playful attitude toward her, she was loosening up. What do you and Alexander do all day while we go to school? she asked suddenly. Sebastian was pleased with her interest. Sleep. You sleep all day? I cant imagine not getting up when the sun rises. Well, I stay up all night. Like Raven? She has insomnia. Shed sleep all day and go to school at night if she could. Or not go to school at all, I chimed in. They laughed, but I was serious. You are so different from other girls I meet, Sebastian said. Becky slunk down. I knowIve never been to Europe or even New York. NoI mean that as a compliment, he continued. Becky lit up. She wasnt used to being paid so much attention by a good-looking stranger. Yes, Beckys the greatest, I praised. Not like those other girls in school who are obsessed with everything Gucci. Weve been friends since the third grade. I can see why you like it so much here, Sebastian said to Alexander. The people are really genuine. And cute. Becky turned as red as the bottle of ketchup she was reaching for. She squeezed it over her fries but then left them untouched. So, Alexander, I said, taking over. Now we know what we do all day. What do you do? Alexander sat up as we waited for his response. I spend it thinking about you, of course. After stuffing our faces with burgers and chocolate malts, Alexander gallantly paid Dixie and we headed for the parking lot. We escorted Becky to her truck underneath a star-filled night sky. It was great meeting you, Sebastian. She opened her arms to give him a friendly hug. Alexander cleared his throat when Sebastian squeezed her a bit too long. When will I have the pleasure of seeing you again? Sebastian asked. Clearly, Sebastian didnt want our visit to end. Becky twisted her hair and shrugged her shoulders. She gave me a quick hug, hopped into her truck, and rolled down the window. Good night, Raven, she said. Ill talk to you tomorrow. Good night, Alexander. We watched and waved as Becky drove out of the parking lot and down the street. So now what do you want to do? I asked. Hang out at the cemetery again? I guess we should be dropping you off, Alexander said. Me? But the night is so young, I moaned. Alexander put his arm around me and we headed for the Mustang, but Sebastian continued to stare in the direction Becky had just driven. Whats up? Alexander asked him, tripping him out of his trance. Sebastian was silent. Hello. Are you in there? Alexander prompted again. Is something wrong? I dont know, Sebastian said. Ive never felt like this before. Are you sick? I wondered. I thinkIm in love, Sebastian announced, as if it was just occurring to him. With who? I asked. Dixie? I can see why you like it here, dude, he said to Alexander. You found your soul mate, and now Ive found mine. Who are you talking about? Alexander asked. Becky. I laughed. But then I could see that Sebastian was dead serious. She has a boyfriend, I said. She does? Yes, I said emphatically. Of course she does. Someone as pretty as her. But does that matterin the long run? Sebastian mused. It matters. Besides, shes not really your type. AB negative? I like all kinds. Sebastian didnt seem to be joking, but Alexander broke a smile. Its not funny, I said. I think its time to go Im not laughing, Sebastian said. It aches in here, he said, pointing to his heart. Thats not love, thats indigestion, I said. Hatsys is known for it. I cant shake it. We can stop at the pharmacy and get you some Rolaids, I offered. Sebastian faced me intently. This isnt heartburn. Dont you see? All right, Alexander said, putting his hands on Sebastians shoulders. Its time we head out. Did you see how into me she was? Sebastian asked. Asking me all sorts of questions? She was just being polite, I told him. I like that. Most girls I meet are into themselves. Can you give me her number? Her number? I asked, alarmed. But she already has a boyfriend! Something I can overlook. For now. I really dont think One cannot dodge Cupids arrow, Sebastian proclaimed. I rolled my eyes. Cupid isnt the only one with an arrow. I scowled. Alexander rubbed my neck. Its okay. Hes just playing. We got into the Mustang, and as Sebastian drove me home, the ghostly duo boisterously sang to tunes blasted from his speakers. I pretended to not be disturbed by Sebastians off-key singing or his sudden proclamation. Sebastian waited in the car while Alexander escorted me up the front steps. Why didnt you say anything about Becky? I asked when we reached the door. Hes harmless. He falls for girls all the time and whines when they dont fall back. I was surprised he didnt declare his love for you. Alexander fingered my belt loops and drew me to him. Yeah, why didnt he? I asked, gazing up at him. Im sure he did, he said, brushing my hair away from my face. He just knows what Id do to him if he did anything about it. You think hed really like me? For a moment, I too was as giddy as Becky had been. Not because I liked Sebastian but because I liked the idea of being admired. I spent so much of my life in Dullsville being ostracized, it was exhilarating to know that I might be attractive to the male species, especially when the male species was the vampire kind. How could he miss the most beautiful girl in Dullsvilleor the world, for that matter? Alexander asked. Hed have to be blinder than a bat. My boyfriend stared at me, his chocolate eyes burning through me. He leaned into me and gave me a five-star kiss.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-4.html","bookId":1871,"book":{"id":1871,"title":"Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7)","description":"Storyline: Love Bites (Vampire Kisses #7) As a mortal girl dating a vampire, Raven knows that love isn\u0027t always easy.
