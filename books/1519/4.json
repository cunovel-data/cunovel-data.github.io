And they were biting him.\\n\\n Geoffrey Paxton was only one and probably the least of them, but because he was reachable and immediate he was the most frightening. Harry wasn\u0027t frightened of Paxton, rather of what he might do to Paxton if he lost control. And of what losing control might conceivably do to him, to the Necroscope himself. He knew how easy it would be to betray himself and reveal that he was no longer an innocent but that some great and as yet undeveloped (but developing, certainly) Darkness had entered him.\\n\\n That was what Paxton was looking for, Harry knew: proof that the Necroscope was no longer a fit citizen or habitant of Earth - no longer, indeed, a man, not entirely - but an alien creature and a monstrous threat. And when he knew it for sure, when there was no longer any doubt, then Paxton would report that fact and there would be war. Harry Keogh versus The Rest. The rest of Mankind. And that was the last thing Harry wanted, to be at odds with a world and its peoples which he had fought so long and so hard to keep safe.\\n\\n Paxton, then, was a flea on Harry\u0027s back, a niggle at the edge of - attempting to dig its way deeper into - his mind, an irritation. And because Paxton\u0027s presence was representative of an even greater threat, which must ultimately challenge the Necroscope\u0027s very existence, it was something Harry could well do without. For to the Wamphyri the single \u0027honourable\u0027 answer to any challenge may only be written in blood!\\n\\n Wamphryri!\\n\\n The word itself was ... a Power.\\n\\n It was a tingling in the core of his being, an awareness of passions beyond the feeble, fumbling emotions of men, a savage, explosive nuclear energy contained - but barely - in his seething blood. It was a chain-reaction which was happening to him even now, whose catalyst was blood. And in itself it, too, was a challenge. But one which he must resist, which he must not, dare not answer. Not if he desired to remain ascendant and for the most part human.\\n\\n A flea, then, this Paxton. An invader who would stick his proboscis in that most private and inviolable of all human territories, the mind itself, and siphon out its thoughts. A spy, a thought-thief- a parasite come to sup on Harry\u0027s secrets - a flea. But only one flea of several, and not one whose bites he could afford to scratch.\\n\\n Another unbearable itch was the fact that the dead -the Great Majority of mankind, who yet lay apart from and unknowable to mankind, with the sole (the soul?) exception of Harry Keogh - were withdrawing from him. He was losing his rapport; the change in him had wrought a change in them. Their trust was weakening.\\n\\n Oh, there were many among them who owed him beyond their means to repay, and many more who had loved him for his own sake, to whom the Necroscope had always been the one glimmer of light in an otherwise everlasting darkness, but even these were wary of him now. For when he had been simply Harry - unsullied and unsullying, innocent and gentle - why, then it had been a marvellous thing that he could touch the dead and they touch him! But all of that was yesterday.\\n\\n And now that he was more than Harry? There are certain things which even dead men fear, and limits to what even they will lie still for...\\n\\n Since the destruction of Janos Ferenczy and his works, Harry had been busy. Other than the constant irritation of Geoffrey Paxton the only intrusion he\u0027d allowed - the single distraction from his purpose, because he had no control over it - was the knowledge that a necromancer lived and practised his abominations in England. It distracted him because Penny Sanderson was now his friend (his ward, even?) and because he was privy to what she and others like her had gone through.\\n\\n Of the fact that the forces of law and order would track down and apprehend Penny\u0027s torturer, murderer, and then violator eventually, Harry had little doubt; but they would never charge him with the full range of his offences, because they had no yardstick by which to measure them. They neither knew nor were capable of defining a full range of offences, not in this case. And certainly there was no punishment which would fit the crime. Not in law.\\n\\n But the Necroscope fully understood the nature of this beast and his crimes, and his ideas of punishment were rather more stringent. Even before his contamination he\u0027d had that. It was a flame which had been sparked in him by the murder of his own sweet mother, and which burned just as lively to this day. An eye for an eye.\\n\\n As to what Harry had been doing since removing the last of the Ferenczys forever from the world of men: his works had been weird and wonderful, and the thoughts in his MÃ¶bius mind even more so.\\n\\n To begin with, he\u0027d brought back Trevor Jordan\u0027s ashes from Rhodes. The incorporeal telepath had wished it (death might have some sort of meaning with Harry to talk to), but not even Jordan had suspected Harry\u0027s real purpose.\\n\\n By themselves, however, the essential salts of a man were insufficient to put Harry\u0027s plan into action, not and achieve the entirely satisfactory result which he sought. Which was why, before reducing further the ruins of Janos Ferenczy\u0027s castle, the Necroscope had removed from them certain chemical substances by means of which Janos had performed his own monstrous brand of necromancy.\\n\\n Not all of the dead would wish for such a resurgence, Harry knew: the Thracian warrior-king Bodrogk and his wife Sofia, whose world had lain two thousand years in the past, had been happy to collapse in each other\u0027s arms and return to dust (a merciful release for them, who had prayed for it so often). But what of the much more recently dead?\\n\\n Like Trevor Jordan, for instance?\\n\\n The answer might seem easy: why not ask him? But in fact that was the hardest thing of all. \u0027I intend to return you to life. I have the apparatus but I\u0027m not one hundred per cent sure of the system. It worked perfectly well for another, but he had the advantage of many hundreds of years of experimentation. In the event all goes well you will be as you were; except, well... you\u0027ll recall that you did put a bullet through your brain. I\u0027m not entirely sure how that will affect you. If when I call you up from your ashes I discover that you\u0027re a complete gibbering fucking idiot then, however reluctantly, I\u0027ll be obliged to put you down again. Now, provided you\u0027re perfectly happy with all of this\\n\\n Or, in Penny Sanderson\u0027s case: \u0027Penny, I think I can bring you back. But if I get the mixture wrong it could be that you\u0027ll not be as lovely as you were. I mean, your skin and features could be imperfect, or blemished, or pocked... hideously. For example, some of the things I called up in the Castle Ferenczy were quite monstrous; there were depletions, inconsistencies, er, anomalies? Wherefore I reserve the right to erase you if things go wrong. But of course we\u0027ll always be able to try again, later, when with a bit of luck I\u0027ll get it right.\u0027\\n\\n No, he couldn\u0027t tell them what he had in mind, not yet. If he gave them the bare bones of the matter they\u0027d require him to flesh it out, and if he elaborated they\u0027d fret about every smallest detail. And from now until the actual - resurrection? - they\u0027d mix anticipation with dread, alternating shivers of excitement with shudders of terror most extreme. They\u0027d climb high mountains of hope, only to tumble back into black lakes of deepest despair and depression.\\n\\n \u0027I have a shot which may cure your cancer... but it just might give you AIDS.\u0027\\n\\n That was how it would feel to Harry, if the roles were reversed; but at the same time he knew that of course it wasn\u0027t like that: when you\u0027re dead you\u0027re beyond hope, and so any hope has to be better than none. Or does it? Or was that simply the vampire in him - tenacity aspiring to immortality - doing his thinking for him?\\n\\n Or ... perhaps he hesitated for another, far more elemental reason: something which warned him that with his small talents (small, yes, in the scale of a universe or parallel multiverses) he must not, dare not, usurp one of the Greater Talents of that Other whom men called God? History\u0027s necromancers, among which Janos had been a latecomer, had dared it, and where were they now? Had there been avenging angels before Harry, to put right the wrongs of these wizards? And if so, would there be one after him, to chastise him in his turn?\\n\\n Harry had been the Necroscope, was becoming a vampire, and now would be a necromancer in his own right. How dare he seek out Penny\u0027s murderer to punish him on the one hand, and on the other pursue the practice of that same black art? What would be his punishment?\\n\\n Perhaps the gears were already engaged, the wheels even now turning. Perhaps the Necroscope had already gone too far, disturbing the delicate balance between Good and Evil to such an extent that it now required radical readjustment. Had he simply become too powerful, which is to say corrupt? How did the old saying go: \u0027Absolute power corrupts absolutely\u0027? Ridiculous! Was God Himself corrupt? No, for the maxims of men are like their laws: they apply only to men.\\n\\n Such arguments were endless in the metamorphosis of the Necroscope\u0027s mind and body, until sometimes he thought he was mad. But when his thoughts were clear he knew that he was not mad; it was just the thing that was in him, altering his perceptions along with everything else.\\n\\n And then he would remember how he used to be, determine that he must always be that way, and know that he hesitated only out of consideration for his friends among the dead. It was simply that he didn\u0027t want Trevor and Penny to suffer agonies of protracted uncertainty, only to let them down when the waiting was over. To die once is enough, as had been made perfectly plain by Janos\u0027s many Thracian thralls in the bowels of the Castle Ferenczy.\\n\\n As for God: if there was such a One (and Harry had never been sure) then the Necroscope supposed he must consider his talents God-given and use them accordingly. While he could.\\n\\n Harry had spent a good deal of his time arguing, not least with himself. If a subject took his fancy - almost any subject - he would play word-games with himself to the point of distraction and delirium: a sort of mental masturbation. But it wasn\u0027t just himself he was jerking off; in conversations with the dead he was equally argumentative, even when he suspected that they were right and he was wrong.\\n\\n Indeed, he seemed to argue for the sake of it, out of sheer contrariness. He thought and argued about God; also about good and evil, about science, pseudoscience and sorcery, their similarities, discrepancies and ambiguities. Space, time and space-time fascinated him, and especially mathematics with its inalienable laws and pure logic. The very changelessness of maths was a constant joy and relief to the Necroscope\u0027s changeling mind in its changeling body.\\n\\n Within a day or two of returning from the Greek islands he had used the instantaneous medium of the MÃ¶bius Continuum to go to Leipzig and see (speak to) August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius where he lay in his grave. MÃ¶bius had been and still was a great mathematician and astronomer; indeed he was the man whose genius had saved Harry\u0027s life on several occasions, again through the medium of his MÃ¶bius Continuum. But while Harry\u0027s primary purpose in visiting MÃ¶bius was to thank him for the return of his numeracy, instead he ended up arguing with him.\\n\\n The great man had happened to mention that his next project would be to measure space, and as soon as the Necroscope heard this he threw himself headlong into an argument. This time the argument was \u0027Space, Time, Light and the Multiverses\u0027.\\n\\n Won\u0027t \u0027Universe\u0027 suffice? MÃ¶bius had wanted to know.\\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Harry had answered, \u0027because we know there are parallels. I\u0027ve visited one, remember?\u0027 (And East German students with their notebooks had wondered at this peculiar man who stood by a dead scientist\u0027s tomb muttering to himself.)\\n\\n Very well then, let\u0027s concentrate on the one we know best, MÃ¶bius had been logical about it. This one.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll measure it?\u0027\\n\\n I propose to.\\n\\n \u0027But since it\u0027s constantly expanding, how will you go about it?\u0027\\n\\n I shall stand at its outermost rim, beyond which there is nothing, transfer myself instantaneously through the universe to the far rim, beyond which there is likewise nothing, and in so doing measure the distance between. Then I shall transfer myself instantaneously back here and perform the same experiment exactly one hour later, and again an hour after that.\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Harry had answered. \u0027But ... to what purpose?\u0027\\n\\n (A sigh.) Why, from that time forward - and whenever I require to know it - a correct calculation of the size of the universe will be instantly available!\\n\\n Harry had stayed grudgingly silent for a moment, until: \u0027I too have given the matter a little thought,\u0027 he said. \u0027Though purely on the theoretical level, because the physical measurement of a constantly changing quantity seems rather fruitless to me. Whereas to understand what is happening, how and to what degree the age of the universe is tied to its rate of expansion - a constant, incidentally - and so forth, seems so much more satisfying.\u0027\\n\\n (An astonished pause.) Oh, indeed! And Harry had almost been able to see MÃ¶bius\u0027s eyebrows joining in a frown across the bridge of his nose. \u0027You\u0027 have thought about it, have you? Theoretically, you say? And might I inquire as to \u0027your\u0027 conclusions?\\n\\n \u0027You want to know all about space, time, light and the multiverses?\u0027\\n\\n If you\u0027ve the time for it! MÃ¶bius had been scathing in his sarcasm.\\n\\n To which the Necroscope had answered: \u0027Your initial measurement will suffice; no other is necessary. Knowing the size of the universe - and not only this one, incidentally, but all the parallels, too - at any given moment of time, we will automatically know their exact age and rate of expansion, which will be uniform for all of them.\u0027\\n\\n Explain.\\n\\n \u0027Now the theory,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027In the beginning there was nothing. Came the Primal Light! Possibly it shone out of the MÃ¶bius Continuum, or perhaps it came with the colossal fireball of the Big Bang. But it was the beginning of the universe of light. Before the light there was nothing, and after it there was a universe expanding at the speed of lightr\\n\\n Eh?\\n\\n \u0027Do you disagree?\u0027\\n\\n The universe was expanding at the speed of light?\\n\\n \u0027Actually, at twice the speed of light,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027That was the essence of your problem, remember, which sparked the return of my numeracy? Switch on a light in space and a pair of observers 186,000 miles away from it on opposite sides would both see its light one second later, because the light expands in both directions. Now, do you disagree?\u0027\\n\\n Of course not! The Primal Light, as any light, must have expanded just as you say. But... the universe?\\n\\n \u0027At the same speed!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And it still is expanding at that speed.\u0027\\n\\n Explain. And make it good.\\n\\n \u0027Before the light there was nothing, no universe.\u0027\\n\\n Agreed.\\n\\n \u0027Does anything travel faster than light?\u0027\\n\\n No - yes! We can, but only in the MÃ¶bius Continuum. And I suppose thought is likewise instantaneous.\\n\\n \u0027Now think!\u0027 said Harry. The Primal Light is still travelling outwards, expanding on all frontiers at a constant speed of 186,000 miles per second. Tell me: does anything lie beyond those frontiers? And I do mean any thing?\u0027\\n\\n Of course not, because in the physical universe nothing travels faster than light.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly! Wherefore light defines the extent - the size -of the universe! That\u0027s why I called it the universe of light. A formula:\\n\\n aU \u003d rU\\n\\n c\\n\\n Do you disagree?\u0027\\n\\n MÃ¶bius had looked at the thing scrawled on the screen of Harry\u0027s mind. The age of the universe is equal to its radius divided by the speed of light. And after a moment, but very quietly now: Yes, I agree.\\n\\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027It\u0027s hard to get a decent argument going these days. Everyone cries uncle.\u0027\\n\\n MÃ¶bius had been angry. He had never seen Harry like this before. Certainly the Necroscope\u0027s instinctive maths was a wonderful thing, an awesome talent in its own right, but where was Harry\u0027s humility? What on earth had got into him? Perhaps MÃ¶bius should let him continue to expound and then try to pick holes, bring him down a peg or two.\\n\\n And time? And the multiverses?\\n\\n But Harry had been ready for him: \u0027The space-time universe - which has the same size and age as any and all of the parallels - is cone-shaped, the point of the cone being the Big Bang/Primal Light where time began, and the base being its current boundary or diameter. Is that feasible, logical?\u0027\\n\\n Desperately seeking errors, still MÃ¶bius had been unable to discover them. Yes, he was obliged to answer, eventually. Feasible, logical, but not necessarily correct.\\n\\n \u0027Grant me feasible,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And then tell me: what lies outside the cone?\u0027\\n\\n Nothing, since the universe is contained within it.\\n\\n \u0027Wrong! The parallels are cone-shaped, too, born at the same time and expanding from the same source!\u0027\\n\\n MÃ¶bius had pictured it. But... then each cone is in contact with a number of other cones. Is there evidence of this?\\n\\n \u0027Black holes,\u0027 said Harry at once, \u0027which juggle with matter and so perform a necessary balancing act. They suck matter out of universes which are too heavy, into universes which are too light. White holes are, of course, the other ends of the black holes. In space-time such holes are the lines of contact between cones, but in space they are simply - \u0027 (a shrug,) \u0027 - holes.\u0027\\n\\n MÃ¶bius was tired, but: Cones are circular in cross-section, he\u0027d argued. Put three together and you get a triangular shape between them.\\n\\n And Harry had nodded his agreement. \u0027Grey holes. There\u0027s one at the bottom of the Perchorsk ravine, and another up an underground river in Romania.\u0027\\n\\n And so he\u0027d made his point and won his argument, if there had been one to win in the first place. For the fact was he\u0027d only argued for the sake of it and neither knew nor cared if he was right or wrong.\\n\\n But MÃ¶bius had cared, because he didn\u0027t know if Harry was right or wrong either...\\n\\n Another time, the Necroscope had talked to Pythagoras. Again his principal reason for going to see him was to convey his thanks (the great Greek mystic and mathematician had been of some assistance in his quest for numeracy), but again the visit had ended in argument.\\n\\n Harry had thought to find the Greek\u0027s grave at Metapontum, or if not there then at Crotona in southern Italy. But all he found was a follower or two until, by pure chance, he stumbled upon the forgotten, 2,480-year-old tomb of a member of the Pythagorean Brotherhood on the Island of Chios. There was no marker; it was a stony, ochre place where goats ate thistles not fifty yards from a rocky shore looking north on the Aegean.\\n\\n Pythagoras? No, not here, that one informed, in a hushed and very secretive manner, when Harry\u0027s dead-speak broke into his centuried thoughts. He is elsewhere, waiting out his time.\\n\\n \u0027His time?\u0027\\n\\n Until his metempsychosis, into a living, breathing man!\\n\\n \u0027But do you converse? Are you able to contact him?\u0027\\n\\n He will occasionally contact us, when a thought has occurred to him.\\n\\n \u0027Us?\u0027\\n\\n The Brotherhood! But I have said too much. Begone. Leave me in peace.\\n\\n \u0027As you wish,\u0027 Harry had told him. \u0027But he won\u0027t thank you that you turned away the Necroscope.\u0027\\n\\n What? The Necroscope? (Astonishment, and awe.) You are that one, who taught the dead to speak out in their graves, so enabling them to talk to one another as in life?\\n\\n \u0027The same.\u0027\\n\\n And do you seek to learn from Pythagoras?\\n\\n \u0027I seek to instruct him.\u0027\\n\\n That is a blasphemy!\\n\\n \u0027Blasphemy?\u0027 Harry had raised an eyebrow. \u0027And is Pythagoras a god, then? If so, a painfully slow one! Consider this: I have already achieved my metempsychosis. Even now I embark upon a second phase, a new... condition.\u0027\\n\\n Your soul is in process of migration?\\n\\n \u0027I may say that a change is in the offing, certainly.\u0027\\n\\n And after a while: If I speak to our master Pythagoras on your behalf, and if you have lied to me, be sure he willdamn you with Numbers. Aye, and possibly me with you! No, I dare not. First prove yourself.\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps I can show you some numbers.\u0027 Harry had contained his impatience as best he could. \u0027As a member of the Brotherhood, I\u0027m sure you will appreciate their importance.\u0027\\n\\n Do you seek to seduce me with your puny figures? What, the work of a mere lifetime? Are you suggesting that in the two thousand years and more which have passed since I was lain to rest here I\u0027ve dreamed no numbers or equations or formulae of my own? Necroscope or none, you are presumptuous!\\n\\n \u0027Presumptuous?\u0027 Harry\u0027s anger had been aroused. \u0027Equations? Formulae? Why, I have formulae such as you could never dream.\u0027 And he\u0027d displayed the computer screen of his mind, and covered it with the endlessly mutating algebraics of MÃ¶bius mathematics. Then he\u0027d formed a MÃ¶bius door, and let the other gaze a moment upon the nowhere and everywhere across the threshold.\\n\\n Until, gaspingly: What... what is that?!\\n\\n The Big Zero,\u0027 Harry had growled then, letting the door close on itself. The place where all numbers begin. But I\u0027m wasting my time. I came to talk to a master and ended up chatting with a mere student - and a middling one at that. Now tell me: do I get my audience with Pythagoras or don\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n He ... he is in Samos.\\n\\n \u0027Where he was born?\u0027\\n\\n The same. The last place anyone would think to look for him, he thought... And then, frantically: Necroscope -plead with him for me! I have betrayed him! He will exclude me!\\n\\n \u0027Rubbish!\u0027 Harry had growled, but without scorn. \u0027Exclude you? He will elevate you - for you have gazed upon the secret mathematical door to all times and places.\\n\\n You don\u0027t believe me?\u0027 (And he\u0027d shrugged). \u0027Well, it\u0027s your choice. My thanks anyway - and farewell.\u0027 And conjuring another MÃ¶bius door he\u0027d stepped through it -\\n\\n - And out again on Samos, twenty miles away, where Pythagoras had spent his childhood two and a half millennia ago, and to which his bones had been returned in secrecy when at last he died. Pythagoras, however introvert, secretive, diffident, could hardly escape or ignore the Necroscope\u0027s deadspeak probe at such close range. That thought in itself had been deadspeak and as such the recluse (in death even more than in life) had heard it. And answered: What is your number?\\n\\n \u0027Any you choose for me,\u0027 Harry had shrugged, homing in on the mystic\u0027s mental whisper. And when he\u0027d located him definitely, one further MÃ¶bius jump took him from a deserted, wooded shoreline straight there: to a small olive grove on a terraced hillside above a headland with a tiny white church. Down the coast a little way, scarcely glimpsed through pines and wind-warped oaks, Tigani\u0027s harbour glinted turquoise, blue, silver; music from a taverna came drifting on the bright summer air.\\n\\n It was cool in the shade of the trees and the Necroscope had been grateful to take off his wide-brimmed hat, also the dark-lensed spectacles which protected his now delicate eyes. And because Pythagoras had remained silently thoughtful: There are numbers galore. I\u0027m not fussy.\u0027\\n\\n Then you should be, the mystic\u0027s whisper was tremulous, fevered. They are The All. The gods themselves are numbers, though no man knows them. When I have discovered the numbers of the gods, then my metempsychosis may commence.\\n\\n \u0027If you truly believe that, then you\u0027ve a long time to wait,\u0027 Harry had answered at once. \u0027You can know all the numbers in all their combinations from now to eternity and it won\u0027t change anything, not for you. It isn\u0027t a magical thing, Pythagoras. However many numbers you employ, your soul won\u0027t fly into a new body. There\u0027s no science or sorcery can help you now.\u0027\\n\\n Hah! the other was filled with wrath and not a little scorn. Only see who utters these blasphemies! And is this the Necroscope, who was impotent and innumerate, to whom the simplest sum was a mystery? Are you the one they pleaded for, the legions of dust, the teeming dead? MÃ¶bius came to me on his knees for you, and what are you after all but an ingrate?\\n\\n Harry had been needled but hid it from the Greek. Likewise he hid his thoughts: Pompous old fart! While out loud: \u0027I came to thank you, for my numeracy. Without it I\u0027d be like you: dust in a grave. Or perhaps not like you, for there was a man who would have called me up to torture me for my secrets.\u0027 A necromancer? \u0027Just so.\u0027 It is a black art!\\n\\n \u0027Not always. It has its uses. What I am doing now is a sort of necromancy after all. For I am a living man, talking to one who is dead.\u0027\\n\\n Pythagoras gave this a moment\u0027s thought, and: I overheard your conversation with one of the Brothers, he said. Is blasphemy your byword? You alleged reincarnation, transmigration, metempsychosis.\\n\\n \u0027I stated a fact,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I was one man in his own body, and when it died I inhabited another. Don\u0027t take my word for it but ask the dead, who have nothing to gain from lying. They\u0027ll tell you it\u0027s true. Moreover, if your ashes were pure, I tell you I could even call you up from the dead! Not with numbers but with words. And this isn\u0027t blasphemy, Pythagoras, but simple truth. Or ... perhaps the act itself would constitute blasphemy, I can\u0027t be sure. If so then you\u0027re right and I am a blasphemer, and plan to be again.\u0027\\n\\n You could call me up from my ashes?\\n\\n \u0027Only if they were pure, unsullied. Were you buried in a jar?\u0027\\n\\n I was buried in soil, in secret, here beneath your feet, where as a boy I ran among the trees. My flesh and bones are now one with the earth. Anyway, I cannot believe you. Words and not numbers? Words are from the lips, frivolous things which are spoken and change, while numbers spring from pure mind and are immutable.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s academic, after all,\u0027 Harry had shrugged. \u0027In two thousand years your salts have been washed into the soil. There are no words - and certainly no numbers - which can help you now.\u0027\\n\\n Blasphemy and sedition! Do you seek to turn my followers against me?\\n\\n Harry could contain himself no longer. \u0027Pythagoras, you\u0027re a charlatan! In your world you guarded your small, pointless mathematical \"secrets\" - basic discoveries which any child under instruction knows today from his school-books - as if they were Life and Death. And true death has not changed you. I gave you deadspeak, since when you could have conferred with more modern, more genuine masters, if you\u0027d wished it. To Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein; to Roemer, Maxwell and - \u0027\\n\\n Enough! the other had been outraged. I should have ignored MÃ¶bius! I should have -\\n\\n \u0027But you couldn\u0027t ignore him!\u0027 (Harry\u0027s turn to cut in.) \u0027You dared not...\u0027\\n\\n What do you mean?\\n\\n \u0027That I know your real secret. That you were a fraud. That you not only made fools of your precious \"Brotherhood\" in life but continue to deceive them in death! There is no mysticism in numbers, Pythagoras, and you must know it. If only because you\u0027re a learned man. Why, you yourself have told me that numbers are immutable, unchanging and unchangeable. Which means that they are solid truth, not flights of fancy! Iron truth, not ethereal magic.\u0027\\n\\n Liar! Liar! Pythagoras had raged. You twist words, change meanings!\\n\\n \u0027Why do you hide yourself, even from the dead?\u0027\\n\\n Because they have no understanding. Because their ignorance is contagious.\\n\\n \u0027No, because they know more than you! Your followers would desert you. You told them they would migrate, return again to men and meet with you in worlds of pure Number - and now you know that this was false.\u0027\\n\\n I thought it was truth.\\n\\n \u0027But that was two and a half thousand years ago. And are you returned? How long does it take to admit you were wrong?\u0027\\n\\n I have dreamed numbers that would blast you!\\n\\n \u0027Blast me, then.\u0027\\n\\n By this time Pythagoras had been sobbing. He hurled a catalogue of numbers at Harry, which shattered against the wall of the Necroscope\u0027s metaphysical mind. But at least they shocked him into recognition of his predicament: that again the thing inside was striving to replace him, this time by use of convoluted Wamphyri \u0027logic\u0027.\\n\\n On this occasion it was his salvation, for it had never been Harry\u0027s desire to hurt or even alarm the dead. And: \u0027I ... I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Sorry? You are a fiend! Pythagoras had sobbed. But... you are right.\\n\\n \u0027No, I merely argued. Perhaps I am right, perhaps not. But I was wrong to argue for the sake of it. And let\u0027s face it, I stand in contradiction of my own argument.\u0027\\n\\n How so?\\n\\n \u0027I know that numbers are not immutable.\u0027 Ahhh! (A long drawn-out sigh.) Would you... could you demonstrate?\\n\\n At which Harry had shown him the screen of his mind, with all of MÃ¶bius\u0027s configurations crawling on its surface, mutating and sprawling into infinity. And for a long time the old Greek had been silent. Then: I was a clever child who thought he knew everything, he said, his voice broken. Time has passed me by.\\n\\n \u0027But it will never forget you,\u0027 Harry had been quick to point out. \u0027We remember your theorem; books have been written about you; there are Pythagoreans even today.\u0027\\n\\n My theorem? My numbers? If I hadn\u0027t done it others would have.\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s your name we remember. And anyway, that could be said of anyone and anything.\u0027 Except the Necroscope.\\n\\n But: \u0027I\u0027m not even sure about that,\u0027 Harry had answered. \u0027I think that perhaps there were others before me. And certainly there was one after me. They dwell in other worlds now.\u0027 And will you dwell there, too? \u0027Possibly. Probably. And perhaps soon.\u0027\\n\\n What\u0027s it like now? Pythagoras had asked after a while, and Harry had suspected it was the first thing he\u0027d inquired of anyone in a long time.\\n\\n \u0027Upon this island,\u0027 the Necroscope had answered, \u0027lie many of the more recently dead. But you\u0027ve shunned them. You could have asked them about Samos, the world, the living. But you were afraid to know the truth. And do you know, the last thing of any importance to the living on this island is number? Well, perhaps not entirely true. I\u0027m sure they\u0027re interested in the quantities of drachmae to the pound, to the Deutschmark and the dollar.\u0027 He explained his meaning.\\n\\n The world is so small now!\\n\\n Harry had put on his hat, his glasses, and gone out from the shade into sunlight. With his hands in his pockets the latter didn\u0027t bother him too much, but he must go slowly or lose his balance on the rough tracks and roads into Tigani. Pythagoras had gone with him, his deadspeak, anyway; distance wasn\u0027t too important once contact had been established.\\n\\n I\u0027ll open up the Brotherhood, dissolve it entirely, put it aside. There\u0027s so much to learn.\\n\\n \u0027Men have landed on the moon,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Pythagoras\u0027s mind had flown in circles.\\n\\n \u0027They have calculated the speed of light.\u0027\\n\\n The old mystic\u0027s thoughts were one huge, astonished question mark.\\n\\n \u0027But you know, among the dead are those mathematicians who could benefit greatly from your knowledge.\u0027\\n\\n What, mine? I am an infant!\\n\\n \u0027Not a bit of it. You stuck to pure number. Why, in two thousand and more years, by now you\u0027re a lightning calculator! May I test you?\u0027\\n\\n By all means - but please, a simple thing. Not the dizzy designs inscribed upon your secret mind.\\n\\n \u0027Then give me the sum of all the numbers between one and one hundred, inclusive.\u0027\\n\\n Five thousand and fifty, Pythagoras\u0027s answer had been instantaneous.\\n\\n \u0027A lightning calculator,\u0027 Harry had been right. \u0027Among the less practical mathematicians - the theoretical mathematicians - why, you\u0027d be like a talking slide-rule! I think that for a dead man you\u0027ve a great future, Pythagoras.\u0027\\n\\n But it was such a simple thing. The Greek had been flattered. And known by heart. Multiplication, division, addition and subtraction - aye, and trigonometry, too -I\u0027ve done it all so often. There isn\u0027t an angle I can\u0027t calculate.\\n\\n There you are.\u0027 Harry had smiled. And, however drily: \u0027Believe me, there aren\u0027t many today who know all the angles.\u0027\\n\\n And you, Harry? Are you a lightning calculator? Harry hadn\u0027t wished to shatter him. \u0027Ah, but with me it\u0027s different, intuitive.\u0027\\n\\n Between one and a million, then!\\n\\n \u0027500,000,500,000,\u0027 the Necroscope had answered almost in the same breath. \u0027Take ten and multiply it by itself as many times as you like, and it works every time. Half of ten is five; put the two halves together again: 55. Half of a hundred is fifty, put the halves together: 5,050. And so on. \"Magic\" to some, intuition to me.\u0027\\n\\n Pythagoras had been downcast. Why would they need me when they already have you?\\n\\n \u0027Because, as I\u0027ve stated, I may not be here too long. It\u0027s like you said: the world is a small place. And it\u0027s hard to find a hiding place.\u0027\\n\\n On the outskirts of Tigani he\u0027d found a small taverna and seated himself in its shade, and ordered ouzo with a dash of lemonade. English girls splashed in the warm, blue waters of a small, rocky bay. Their breasts were shiny and Harry could smell the oil of coconut from here. Pythagoras had picked the picture from Harry\u0027s mind and scowled at it. Perhaps it\u0027s as well I\u0027m unbodied to stay, he\u0027d commented, darkly. Like vampires, they deplete a man.\\n\\n For a moment the Necroscope had been caught off guard, but then: \u0027Ah!\u0027 he\u0027d answered. \u0027But there are vampires and there are vampires...\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-4.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
