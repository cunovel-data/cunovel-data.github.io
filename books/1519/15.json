{"id":62529,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Finding Johnny\\n\\n In Edinburgh it would soon be dawn, but Harry Keogh knew that things - all sorts of things - were rapidly coming to a head and he wasn\u0027t nearly ready to ease off now. Now that he\u0027d started this job his one thought was to get it finished. In darkness or, if needs be, in light.\\n\\n Early-summer sunlight would be a problem from now on in, but it was more an inconvenience than a threat proper. The sun wouldn\u0027t kill him - not yet, anyway - but taken in large doses it would sicken and weaken him. His glasses helped keep its glare out of his eyes; his floppy hat protected his head and face but was a dead giveaway; he must keep his hands in his pockets for long periods, which gave him the slovenly look of a delinquent youth or a Labour politician but was absolutely necessary. Only the British weather, almost invariably mean, was on his side. Trevor Jordan, on the other hand, suffered no such restrictions and could come and go as he pleased; and with Harry\u0027s help, go as far as he pleased and instantly.\\n\\n In the Necroscope\u0027s Bonnyrig house they drank coffee (Harry would prefer good red wine but needed a re-supply), and split the list of Frigis Express depots down the middle. They would work through them alphabetically until they found what they were looking for. Jordan would take the day shift with Harry supplying the transport; Harry would do nights with Jordan for lookout. The telepath had asked what was the big deal with this job and Harry had showed him a series of vivid mind-pictures taken from Penny Sanderson and Pamela Trotter, and now Jordan was as eager as he was. There was a monster loose in the world and he had to die.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027ll be night watchmen on these places, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 Jordan said, studying his half of the list, \u0027but at this hour of the morning they\u0027ll be kipping off: asleep in some secret corner. We could do a few depots right now, before the drivers or packers or whatever get in.\u0027\\n\\n The bloke we\u0027re after is a driver,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027He uses the Ml and possibly the Al or A7. Maybe we should start with depots close to those major routes.\u0027\\n\\n Jordan had been glancing through the files on the murdered girls. Penny\u0027s report seemed to interest him greatly. Ignoring what the Necroscope had just said, he asked, \u0027Harry, did you know Penny\u0027s body was found in the gardens under the Castle\u0027s walls?\u0027\\n\\n Harry frowned. \u0027Yes. Is that significant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It could be,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027There are quite a few small, specialized units housed in the Castle. For all we know our man from Frigis delivered meat to the various messes and cookhouses that night, and when the coast was clear he bundled Penny over the wall.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027I\u0027ll check out the exact spot where she was found. I remember looking over the wall. There are places where it rears over grassy ledges and steep banks, where the drop is only a few feet and if she fell - or was tossed - her body might slip and slither a bit without breaking anything or suffering any real damage. Because apart from the damage and suffering he had caused her, she wasn\u0027t in bad shape.\u0027 His gaunt face had turned angry as he remembered Penny as she had been the first time he saw her. Shaking his head to dismiss the memory, he growled. \u0027Anyway, I\u0027ll look at it. If it seems at all likely or even possible... well, it could be you\u0027ve narrowed down the field a little. Thanks, Trevor.\u0027 And then, ruefully: \u0027As you can see, I\u0027d never have made the grade as a detective, or even a common or garden policeman!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Jordan told him. \u0027You drop me off in Edinburgh right now and let me follow it up. Let\u0027s face it, you\u0027ve been seen up in the Castle. People may remember you. But they don\u0027t know me. I\u0027ll take this file with me. I still have an old E-Branch identity card I picked up fromthe flat. It\u0027s as good as a policeman\u0027s uniform for getting me into places to gather information. Then, while I concentrate on this end of the job, you can get on with checking out the list of depots.\u0027\\n\\n Harry saw the sense of it. \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we\u0027ll meet back here tonight. Meanwhile, we can easily contact each other if anything breaks. But you have to understand that the sun hampers me. It might stop me getting through to you or you to me. On the other hand, if the day is dull everything will be OK. The only thing is...\u0027 He paused uncertainly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Jordan waited.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll be on your own,\u0027 the Necroscope continued. \u0027If the Branch decides to move on me, they\u0027ll be picking my friends up, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But picking them up\u0027 Jordan repeated him. \u0027Not picking them off! And anyway, Darcy said he\u0027d take care of that.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027But he can\u0027t take care of the fact that I\u0027m a vampire. And you know the Branch won\u0027t be taking any chances, Trevor. In fact I\u0027d lay you odds that my warrant has already been issued, and that right now they\u0027re busy closing off any boltholes. For now... they\u0027ll probably lay off this place, because it\u0027s mine and I know it better than they do. But sooner or later even this house of mine won\u0027t be safe. Hell, it would be the perfect place to settle with me! Out of the way, alone and lonely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Morbid\u0027s not the way to go, Harry,\u0027 the other told him. \u0027Let\u0027s for now just try to find this Johnny, right? Plenty of time then to sort the rest of it.\u0027 And the Necroscope knew he was right. All except the plenty of time part...\\n\\n The following morning, the Minister Responsible called Darcy Clarke in to E-Branch HQ. When Clarke walked into what had once been his office, the Minister was seated at his old desk... and Geoffrey Paxton was standing in one corner of the room, arms folded across his chest and with his back to the reinforced glass windows. Clarke could do without Paxton picking at his mind, but he was no longer in a position to complain about it.\\n\\n After apparently casual nods of greeting or acknowledgement, the Minister remarked how ragged Clarke looked; to which he replied, \u0027I was up late. In fact I\u0027d just managed to snatch an hour or two when your office called to arrange this meeting. Well, that was good, for I was coming in anyway. You see, last night I had a couple of visitors. Except I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re not much likely to believe me when I tell you who one of them was.\u0027\\n\\n Paxton spoke up at once. \u0027We know who they were, Clarke,\u0027 he said, sourly. \u0027Harry Keogh and Trevor Jordan -vampires!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke had been ready for that. He sighed and turned to the Minister. \u0027Do we have to have this meathead in on this? I mean, if he must forever be wriggling about like a fucking great maggot in people\u0027s heads, can\u0027t it be from a distance? Say, right outside the door here?\u0027\\n\\n Unruffled, the Minister stared right back at him. \u0027Are you saying that Paxton is wrong, Clarke?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke sighed again. \u0027I saw Harry and Trevor last night, yes. He\u0027s right that far.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027re saying that Harry Keogh and Jordan aren\u0027t vampires?\u0027 The Minister\u0027s voice was very quiet.\\n\\n Clarke looked at him, looked away, chewed his bottom lip. And the Minister prompted him: \u0027They are vampires?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke faced him again and said, \u0027Jordan... isn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Keogh is?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke snapped, \u0027But you were already pretty sure of that, right? All thanks to -\u0027 he glanced fire at Paxton \u0027- to this slimy shit! Yes, Harry\u0027s been contaminated. He picked up this bloody thing protecting us - every single one of us - doing a job out in the Greek islands which I had asked him to help us with. So that in my book at least he\u0027s not about to turn killer now! What more can I tell you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We think quite a lot,\u0027 Paxton answered, but softly now, his pasty face reddening from the sting of Clarke\u0027s insult.\\n\\n Clarke looked at him, looked at the Minister, and felt no rapport. He wasn\u0027t getting through to them at all. \u0027Why don\u0027t you let me tell it my way?\u0027 he pleaded. \u0027And why don\u0027t you try listening to me? Who knows, you may even learn something?\u0027\\n\\n But Paxton said, \u0027Yes, and we might get thrown right off the track, too.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke glared at him, looked at the Minister across his desk and said, \u0027Look, your pet parrot here isn\u0027t making much sense. Shit, I don\u0027t understand a word! Do you know what he\u0027s raving about?\u0027\\n\\n The Minister came to a decision, gave an abrupt nod and said, \u0027Clarke, I\u0027m going to give it to you straight. E-Branch was monitoring your place last night. Yours and Jordan\u0027s both. You see, we knew even before you did that Jordan was back from the dead, which is to say undead. What? A man dead and gone, yet up and about among the living? Undead! That\u0027s how we see it, the only way we can see it. And not only Jordan but one of those murdered girls, too. Vampires, for there\u0027s nothing else they can be.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke cut in desperately, \u0027But if you\u0027ll only listen to me -\u0027\\n\\n But the Minister wasn\u0027t listening. \u0027We know what time Keogh got to Jordan\u0027s flat, the time they left it together and where they went, and the fact that however much we don\u0027t know - and even if you hadn\u0027t admitted as much -still we\u0027d be absolutely sure that Harry Keogh is a vampire! How can we be so sure? Because he carries all the stigmata. You could say he even smells of vampire: which is to say he covers himself in mind-smog. Do you follow me so far?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I do,\u0027 Clarke answered, feeling his desperation increasing by leaps and bounds, knowing that the Minister was building a case, but what sort of case? Against whom? He had to take one last stab at getting through to him. \u0027But can\u0027t you see that even in this you\u0027re wrong? With all due respect, you don\u0027t know anything about vampires. You\u0027ve had no experience of them. You\u0027re not even talented. You only know what you\u0027ve read or heard from others. And hearsay can\u0027t make up for experience. See, this mind-smog you\u0027re talking about is something Harry can\u0027t control. He doesn\u0027t \"cover himself\" with it, it just is. It\u0027s a result of what he is. Like a dog has a tail, Harry has mind-smog. It isn\u0027t deliberate. In fact if he could get rid of it he would, for it\u0027s a dead giveaway!\u0027\\n\\n The Minister looked questioningly at Paxton, who nodded however grudgingly. Or perhaps it wasn\u0027t so much a grudging nod as a grim one. A nod of affirmation? And even as his apprehension went up another notch, so Clarke said, \u0027So you see how easy it is to make mistakes?\u0027\\n\\n Unblinking, unwavering, the Minister said, \u0027All vampires have this mind-smog, right?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke did blink, however, as his nerves started to jump. There was nothing to fear here, for his talent would warn him of it, but still his nerves were jumping. \u0027As far as we know, yes,\u0027 he answered. \u0027All of them that we\u0027ve dealt with, anyway. When a telepath tries to scan a vampire, he gets mind-smog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Darcy Clarke.\u0027 The Minister\u0027s face was white now. \u0027It must have taken a lot of nerve to come here. Either that or you\u0027re a madman, or you really don\u0027t know what\u0027s happened to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Happened to me?\u0027 Clarke could feel the tension building and didn\u0027t know what it was about. \u0027What the hell are you talking - ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have mind-smog!\u0027 Paxton spat the words out.\\n\\n Clarke\u0027s jaw dropped. \"What? I have...?\u0027\\n\\n The Minister raised his voice. \u0027You out there, Miss Cleary, and Ben. You can come in now.\u0027\\n\\n The door opened and Millicent Cleary stepped inside, with Ben Trask right behind her. The girl looked at Clarke and her voice was breathless as she said, \u0027It\u0027s true, sir. You... you have it.\u0027 She had always called Clarke sir. He looked at her, backed away a step and shook his head.\\n\\n But Ben Trask said, \u0027Darcy, she\u0027s telling the truth. Even Paxton is telling the truth.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke took two hesitant steps towards him... and Trask narrowed his eyes, backed off and held up his arms to ward him off! Clarke saw the look in his old friend\u0027s eyes and couldn\u0027t believe it. \u0027Ben, it\u0027s me!\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, with your talent you have to know that I\u0027m telling the truth, too!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Darcy,\u0027 Trask answered, still backing away, \u0027you\u0027ve been got at. It\u0027s the only answer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got at?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Without your knowing it. You believe you\u0027re telling the truth, and on your own that would be enough to throw me. But it\u0027s two to one, Darcy. And you have been pretty close to Harry Keogh.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke spun on his heel, looked at the faces surrounding him. The Minister, white as chalk behind his desk. Paxton, grim-faced, his right hand nervously playing with the lapel of his jacket. Trask, whose talent had never once let him down - until now. And Millicent Cleary, still respectful for all that she\u0027d just accused him of being a monster!\\n\\n \u0027Crazy, every damned one of you!\u0027 Clarke shakily husked. He thrust his left hand into his pocket, brought out his Branch ID and tossed it on to the desk. That\u0027s it; I\u0027m through with all of this; finished with the Branch for good. I\u0027m walking.\u0027 He reached with his right hand inside his jacket and dragged his issue 9mm pistol into view -\\n\\n - And Paxton yelled, \u0027Freeze!\u0027 and aimed the gun which he had produced a moment earlier.\\n\\n Astonished, Clarke turned towards him - turned his empty gun towards him, too - and Paxton squeezed off two shots.\\n\\n Simultaneous with the deafening reports, Millicent Cleary and Ben Trask yelled, \u0027No!\u0027\\n\\n Too late, for Clarke had been hurled halfway across the room by the first bullet, then swatted from his feet and tossed against the wall by the second. His gun went flying as he crumpled to his knees against the bloodied wall, and his hand crept tremblingly to an area over his heart. There were two holes in his jacket, both turning red and dripping through his twitching fingers. \u0027Shit!\u0027 he whispered. And: \u0027What - ?\u0027\\n\\n He fell forward on to his face, rolled over on to his side, and Trask and the Cleary girl went to their knees beside him. The Minister was on his feet, aghast, holding on to the edge of the desk to keep from falling; and Paxton had come forward, his gun still at the ready, face pale as a sheet of paper with holes punched out for eyes and mouth. \u0027He had a gun.\u0027 He gasped the words out. \u0027He was going to use his gun!\u0027\\n\\n The Minister said, \u0027I ... I thought he was trying to hand it in. That\u0027s what it looked like to me.\u0027\\n\\n Ben Trask cradled Clarke\u0027s head, moaning, \u0027Jesus, Darcy! Jesus!\u0027 The girl had unbuttoned Clarke\u0027s jacket, torn open his crimson shirt. But the blood had almost stopped pumping.\\n\\n Clarke looked down disbelievingly at his chest and the red life leaking out of him. \u0027Not... not possible!\u0027 he said. And the fact was that yesterday it wouldn\u0027t have been.\\n\\n \u0027Darcy, Darcy!\u0027 Trask said again.\\n\\n \u0027Not possible!\u0027 Clarke murmured for the last time, before his eyes filmed over and his head lolled into Trask\u0027s lap. And as yet, no one had even called for a doctor or an ambulance.\\n\\n For long seconds the tableau held... until Paxton broke the silence with, \u0027Get away from him! Are you crazy? Get away from him!\u0027\\n\\n Trask and the girl looked at him.\\n\\n \u0027His blood,\u0027 Paxton told them. \u0027You have his blood all over you! He\u0027ll contaminate you!\u0027\\n\\n Trask stood up and the horror slowly cleared from his eyes. The horror of what had happened, anyway. But his horror of Paxton was something else. \u0027Darcy will contaminate...?\u0027 He started to repeat Paxton, and took a long loping pace towards him. \u0027His blood will contaminate us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What the hell\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 Paxton backed off.\\n\\n \u0027Darcy was right,\u0027 Trask snarled. \u0027About you.\u0027 He pointed at the Minister Responsible. \u0027And you.\u0027 And he took another pace after Paxton.\\n\\n \u0027Back off!\u0027 Paxton warned him, waving his gun.\\n\\n Trask caught his wrist and twisted it, and his strength was furious. The gun went clattering to the floor. \u0027He never spoke a truer word,\u0027 Trask said, holding Paxton at arm\u0027s length like a piece of stinking, rotten meat. \u0027You don\u0027t know anything about vampires except what you\u0027ve read or been told. You have no experience of them. If you did you\u0027d know that bullets don\u0027t stop them - not for long, anyway! But poor Darcy there, if you have any talent at all you\u0027ll know that he\u0027s stone dead. And you killed him!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I ... I...\u0027 Paxton struggled but he couldn\u0027t free himself from Trask\u0027s grip.\\n\\n \u0027Contaminate?\u0027 Trask grated through clenched teeth. He drew Paxton close and rubbed Clarke\u0027s blood into his hair, his eyes and nostrils. \u0027You piece of shit, what could contaminate you?\u0027 He drew back a ham of a hand and bunched it into a fist, and -\\n\\n Trask!\u0027 the Minister snapped. \u0027Ben! Let Paxton go! Let it be! What\u0027s done is done. An accident, maybe. A mistake, possibly. But it\u0027s done. And it\u0027s only one of several things we\u0027re not going to like doing.\u0027\\n\\n Trask\u0027s fist hung in mid-air, shaking with its need to crash into Paxton\u0027s face. But as the Minister\u0027s words sank in, so he tossed the telepath away from him. And lurchingly, almost drunkenly, he went back to Clarke\u0027s crumpled, lifeless body.\\n\\n The Minister said to Paxton, \u0027Get a doctor... and an ambulance.\u0027 Then he saw the look on Paxton\u0027s face.\\n\\n The telepath had recovered both his wits and his nerve; he was cleaning his face with a large pocket handkerchief and shaking his head. His look said, think what you\u0027re saying, what you\u0027re doing. And out loud he said, \u0027We don\u0027t need a doctor or an ambulance, just an incinerator. Clarke\u0027s for burning, by us, right now. Right or wrong, we can\u0027t take any chances with him. He\u0027s for the fire just as soon as possible. And me, I\u0027m for bathing. Trask, Cleary, I know how you must feel, but if I were you - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, you don\u0027t know how we feel.\u0027 Ben Trask looked up at him, all emotion gone now from his face.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 Paxton continued, \u0027I\u0027d bathe if I were you. And right now.\u0027\\n\\n The Minister indicated the door. \u0027Go on, then,\u0027 he told Paxton. \u0027Go and arrange... disposal. Do it now - and take a shower, too, if you feel it\u0027s necessary - then report back to me.\u0027\\n\\n And after the telepath had left the room, past the gaping espers where they crowded the corridor: \u0027Ben,\u0027 said the Minister, \u0027the killing has started. Right or wrong, like Paxton said, it\u0027s started. And we both know it has to go on. So from now on I want you in charge of this thing. I want you to run the entire show, until it\u0027s sorted out one way or the other.\u0027\\n\\n Trask stood up, leaned against the wall, looked at the Minister and thought: One way or the other? No, it can only be one way, for the other is unthinkable. Well, someone has to do it, and I\u0027m as experienced as any of them. More than most. And at least if I\u0027m running it I\u0027ll know that that idiot Paxton won\u0027t be doing any more damage.\\n\\n In the old days it would have been Darcy, Ken Layard, Trevor Jordan and a handful of others. And Harry, of course. But this time they\u0027d be hunting Harry himself, and that was different. And despite what Clarke had said, it looked as if they\u0027d be hunting Jordan, too. And the girl, Penny Sanderson? Jesus, according to the file she was just a kid! But an undead kid.\\n\\n \u0027All right?\u0027 said the Minister.\\n\\n And Trask sighed and answered with an almost imperceptible nod. Yes, it was all right. And Paxton could well have been right, too. If there had been something -anything at all - wrong with Darcy...\\n\\n Trask looked at the girl, her bloodied hands and blouse. \u0027Shower,\u0027 he said, simply. \u0027And make a good job of it.\u0027 Then, when he and the Minister were alone, he said, \u0027When Darcy\u0027s been... burned, we have to scatter the ashes. Scatter them far and wide.\u0027 He gave a small shudder. \u0027For the fact is, Harry Keogh does things with ashes. And I really don\u0027t think I ever want to see Darcy again. Not on his feet, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n 9:40 a.m.\\n\\n Harry Keogh had just finished examining the personnel files at Frigis Express\u0027s Darlington depot when three things happened simultaneously. One: the depot clerk, whom Harry had lured from his tiny box of an office with a bogus telephone call, returned unexpectedly. Two: Harry felt a pang - almost a pain - of a sort he\u0027d never experienced before, within his chest, as if someone had doused his heart with ice water. And three: the fading echo of an unrecognized cry bounced off his mind to ricochet into an unreachable metaphysical limbo of its own. And it seemed to the Necroscope that whatever its source, it was intended specifically for him: as if his name had been called from the gulf between life and death.\\n\\n Deadspeak? But this had been different. Telepathy? Well, maybe. Or a cross between the two? That seemed more likely, and Harry remembered how his mother had described the feelings in her incorporeal heart when a pup called Paddy had been killed by a car on a Bonnyrig road.\\n\\n So ... had someone died? But who? And why had he cried out to Harry?\\n\\n \u0027Who the fuck are you?\u0027 demanded the burly, short-sleeved, red-headed clerk, as he herded Harry into the shadows of a dusty corner where the metal filing cabinet met the wall. He gaped at the former contents of the cabinet, now spilling across the floor.\\n\\n Harry barely glanced at the man\u0027s suspicious, mottled face and said, \u0027Shh!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh!?\u0027 the other repeated him, disbelievingly. \u0027You\u0027ll get shh!, breaking in here! Now what\u0027s the score?\u0027\\n\\n Harry was trying desperately to hang on to the diminishing ethereal echo of ... a cry for help? Was that what it had been? \u0027Look,\u0027 he told the very untypical clerk, \u0027be quiet a minute, will you?\u0027 He tried to push by him.\\n\\n \u0027Why you - !\u0027 Blotches of angry red appeared on the man\u0027s jowly cheeks. \u0027A conman and thief, right? I recognize your voice. It was you on the \u0027phone - right. Well, you picked the wrong man this time, thief!\u0027 He grabbed Harry by the lapels and looked as if he was going to butt him in the face.\\n\\n The Necroscope continued to concentrate on the cry, and at the same time reached out and caught his assailant by the throat. With one huge hand he held him at bay, choking, and with the other he reached up and took off his dark spectacles. The clerk saw his eyes and choked all the more, and commenced windmilling his arms as Harry shoved him effortlessly backwards, driving him across the floor. Finally the clerk\u0027s legs hit the edge of his desk and he sat down in a plastic paper tray, shattering it with his fat backside.\\n\\n Still Harry held him, and still he listened for a repeat performance of the cry. But it was gone now, probably disappeared for ever.\\n\\n Harry felt anger expanding inside him - felt frustrated, cheated - and his hand on the clerk\u0027s windpipe was like iron. His nails bit into the man\u0027s flesh as if it were putty, and Harry knew that if he wanted to he could crush his Adam\u0027s apple and tear his throat out all in one. What\u0027s more, the thing inside was urging him to do it, do it!\\n\\n But he didn\u0027t. Instead he swept the clerk from the desk top and set him crashing down among the debris of his shattering chair and a wooden waste-paper basket.\\n\\n \u0027M-my... G-God!\u0027 The clerk coughed and spat and massaged his throat, and crawled dazedly into a corner where he turned and looked back fearfully at the spot where the blood-eyed, fanged, furious stranger had been standing. But of course the Necroscope was no longer there. No one was there.\\n\\n And again the clerk gurgled, \u0027My God! My g-good G-God!\u0027\\n\\n Working from his list, alphabetically, Harry had already investigated three Frigis depots and installations: the vehicle depot at Alnwick, the slaughterhouse and meat dressing station in Bishop Auckland, and lastly the freezer complex in Darlington. So far he had copied the addresses of four possibles, all of them \u0027Johns\u0027 or \u0027Johnnies\u0027 and all drivers for the firm. Now, however, with the morning only halfway through, the weird mind-cry out of nowhere had disturbed him, damaged his resolve and destroyed his concentration; to such an extent that he took the M\u0026ouml;bius route home to Bonnyrig, and from there contacted Trevor Jordan at the Castle on the Mount in Edinburgh.\\n\\n Harry? Jordan came back at once, his telepathic \u0027voice\u0027 full of his relief that the Necroscope was in touch again. I tried to reach you but your mind-smog was too dense, and getting thicker all the time. Can you come and get me? I think I may have a lead.\\n\\n Harry nodded, just as if he was speaking to someone directly in front of him and not ten miles away, and said, Do you know the Laird\u0027s Larder? It\u0027s a coffee shop up there just off the Royal Mile. Ask anyone and they\u0027ll direct you. I\u0027ll be there in five minutes. But Trevor, tell me: has anything peculiar happened? Have you felt anything strange? Do I need to be, well, more than usually careful how I move?\\n\\n Watchers, you mean? The Branch? (A mental shake of the other\u0027s head). Not that I\u0027ve detected. Maybe a tentative touch now and then, but nothing you could nail down.\\n\\n Nothing concentrated anyway. If they have people up here, then they\u0027re too good for me. And I\u0027m pretty damn good!\\n\\n No static? Paxton, maybe?\\n\\n I don\u0027t feel any static. Distantly, maybe, but nothing local. As for Paxton: I\u0027m sure I\u0027d be able to pick him up twenty miles away. And you?\\n\\n Just an ... experience, Harry answered. In Darlington.\\n\\n Darlington? (The Necroscope could almost see the other\u0027s eyebrows going up.) Now there\u0027s a coincidence! And did you find any Johnnies in Darlington?\\n\\n Harry was intrigued. Two, he replied. And one of them a real-life \u0027Johnny\u0027. That\u0027s how he spells his name, anyway: Johnny Courtney. The other is called John Found.\\n\\n And now he pictured Jordan\u0027s grim nod as the telepath said: Yes, and Dragosani was a foundling, too, wasn\u0027t he?\\n\\n Harry said, Is that supposed to mean something? He knew it was.\\n\\n Better believe it! Jordan confirmed.\\n\\n See you outside the Laird\u0027s Larder, Harry told him. Five minutes...\\n\\n He waited out the five minutes in a fever of anticipation, then made it six to be sure Jordan had got there, and finally M\u0026ouml;bius-tripped to the steep, cobbled road just off the Royal Mile. He emerged from the Continuum on a crowded, bustling pavement where tourists and locals alike were clustered like bees in a hive, jostling and filled with purpose as they went about their various businesses. No one noticed that Harry was suddenly there; people loomed everywhere, from every direction, side-stepping each other; the Necroscope was just another face in the crowd.\\n\\n Jordan was in the doorway of the Laird\u0027s Larder. He spotted Harry, grabbed his elbow and guided him off the street into the shade. Harry was glad of that, for the sun was out and it had grown to be more than a mere irrritation. He now actively hated it. \u0027Buy three sandwiches,\u0027 he told the telepath. \u0027Steak for me and rare as they\u0027ve got it, whatever you like for yourself, and anything with plenty of bread around it for the third. OK?\u0027\\n\\n Mystified, Jordan nodded and went to the busy counter. He ordered, was served, and came back to Harry where he waited. Harry took his arm, said, \u0027Close your eyes,\u0027 and ushered him through a M\u0026ouml;bius door. To anyone watching it would look as if they just stepped out of the coffee shop into the street. Except they didn\u0027t arrive in the street. Instead, a moment later, they emerged two miles away by the lake on the crest of the vast volcanic outcrop called Arthur\u0027s Seat. There was an empty bench where they sat down and ate a while in silence, and Harry tore up the third sandwich into small pieces which he fed to the ducks and a lone swan that came paddling to the feast.\\n\\n And eventually the Necroscope said, \u0027Tell me about it.\u0027 But Jordan answered, \u0027You first. What\u0027s all this about an \"experience\" in Darlington? You sounded like something had worried you, Harry. Something other than finding a couple of suspect Johnnies, that is. I mean, tracking this maniac down is important - no one would deny that - but there\u0027s such a thing as personal safety, too. So you\u0027d better tell me, are there going to be problems?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027And soon. Something inside tells me that not even Darcy Clarke can do anything about that. But that\u0027s not what this was about.\u0027 And as best he could he explained what he had felt, and told Jordan how his mother had reacted to the death of a small dog.\\n\\n \u0027You think someone died this morning? Any idea who?\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027Someone cried out to me, that\u0027s all. I think so, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And your deadspeak? Can\u0027t you... make inquiries?\u0027\\n\\n Harry gave a wry snort. \u0027The Great Majority don\u0027t want to know me,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Not now. Not any longer. I can\u0027t say I blame them.\u0027 He shrugged, then brightened a little. \u0027On the other hand, if someone did die and still wants to contact me, then pretty soon he\u0027ll be able to do just that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Through deadspeak,\u0027 Harry explained. \u0027Except he\u0027ll have to contact me in person, for I wouldn\u0027t know where to start looking. And it will have to be by night. During the daylight hours the sun interferes too much. If not for this hat of mine I\u0027d be in trouble. Even with the hat I feel tired, sick, unable to think straight. There were a few clouds earlier but they\u0027re clearing. And the brighter it gets the duller I get!\u0027 He stood up and threw the last handful of crumbs on to the surface of the lake between the crags. \u0027Let\u0027s get out of here. I could use some shade.\u0027\\n\\n They took the M\u0026ouml;bius route to the gloomy old house on the outskirts of Bonnyrig, then telepathically probed the countryside all around. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Jordan declared, and Harry agreed.\\n\\n And finally: \u0027All right.\u0027 The Necroscope threw off his hat and sprawled gratefully in an easy chair. \u0027Now it\u0027s your turn. Just what did you discover up there at the Castle? I can tell that something\u0027s excited you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right.\u0027 Jordan grinned. \u0027It was my chance to pay you back, Harry, for what you\u0027ve done for me. For my life, my resurrection. My God, I\u0027m alive, and I know how wonderful it is! So I wanted things to work out. You could say I almost willed it to happen, and it did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think you\u0027ve found our man, or monster?\u0027 Harry leaned forward eagerly in his chair.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m pretty sure I have,\u0027 the telepath answered. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m pretty damn sure!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-15.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
