And the Necroscope had moved so quickly that as he seated himself in the shade of a tree close by Pamela Trotter\u0027s simple headstone, so Paxton was still catching his breath where he\u0027d dragged himself up on to the river bank a hundred miles away.\\n\\n \u0027Pamela,\u0027 said the Necroscope, \u0027I\u0027m Harry Keogh. I believe my mother might have mentioned my name to you.\u0027\\n\\n Your mother and others, she came back at once. I\u0027ve been expecting you, Harry - and I\u0027ve been warned off you, too!\\n\\n Harry nodded, perhaps ruefully. \u0027My reputation has suffered a bit lately, it\u0027s true.\u0027\\n\\n Mine suffered a lot, she chuckled. For nearly six years, in fact, ever since I was fourteen and a nice \u0027uncle\u0027 showed me his little pink sprinkler and told me where it went. Actually, I seduced him, for I\u0027d noticed that whenever he was near me he had a hard on. But if it hadn\u0027t been him it would have been someone else, because I was just naturally like that. We played around a lot until his old lady caught us at it one day, the jealous old bat! I was going bouncy-bouncy on him when she walked in. He whipped it out but was too far gone and spurted on the carpet. I don\u0027t think she\u0027d seen him spurt for a long time, and she\u0027d certainly never had it like that! Come to think of it, I don\u0027t think he had either. Not before me. But I liked it all ways. It helps when you enjoy your work.\\n\\n Harry was silent for a moment, surprised, even a little taken aback. He really didn\u0027t know how to answer her.\\n\\n Didn\u0027t your Ma tell you I was a tart, a trollop, a whore? There was no bitterness in her, not even much of sadness, and Harry liked her for it.\\n\\n \u0027Something like that,\u0027 he answered, eventually. \u0027Not that I think it matters a great deal. There have to be a hell of a lot of you down there by now!\u0027\\n\\n She laughed and Harry liked her even more. The oldest profession, she said.\\n\\n \u0027But one night, nearly eight weeks ago, it caught up with you, right?\u0027 He felt that with her he could get right to it.\\n\\n Her assumed indifference fell away from her at once. That wasn\u0027t why it happened, she said. I didn\u0027t fetch him on. And anyway he didn\u0027t want me ... like that.\\n\\n \u0027It was just an assumption,\u0027 Harry told her, quickly. \u0027I meant no offence, and I\u0027m not eager to bring back hurtful memories. But it\u0027s hard to see how I can track this bloke down if no one is able to tell me about him.\u0027\\n\\n Oh, I\u0027d like to see him get his, Harry, she answered. And I\u0027ll help you any way I can. I just hope I can remember enough, that\u0027s all.\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t know until you try.\u0027\\n\\n Where do you want me to start?\\n\\n \u0027First show me how you were, or how you thought you were,\u0027 he said. For he knew well enough that the dead retain pictures of themselves as they were in life, and he wanted to try and draw some sort of comparison with Penny Sanderson. In short, he wondered if his necromancer quarry followed a pattern.\\n\\n From her mind he immediately got back a picture of a tall, dark-eyed, leggy brunette in a mini-skirt, with slightly loose breasts unsupported under a blue silk blouse, and a shapely backside. But there was nothing of character in the picture, her picture, nothing to suggest quality of mind or personality; it was all sensual or outright sexual. Which didn\u0027t fit with his first impressions.\\n\\n So? How was I?\\n\\n \u0027Very attractive,\u0027 he told her. \u0027But I think you\u0027re selling yourself short.\u0027\\n\\n Often, she agreed, but without her customary laugh. Then she sighed, and that was something Harry was used to in the dead. It was the realization of a time and a thing done and finished with, which could never return. But she brightened up at once. And here am I actually talking to a man, and for once not wondering what he\u0027s got in his pants. In the front, and in the back-pocket.\\n\\n \u0027Was it always like that, for money?\u0027\\n\\n And sometimes for fun. I\u0027ve told you, I was nympho. Do you want to get on now?\\n\\n Harry was embarrassed. She\u0027d given him a stock answer, had obviously heard that question before, often. \u0027Was I prying?\u0027\\n\\n It\u0027s OK, she answered. All men wonder about it, about what goes on in a pro\u0027s mind. But suddenly her deadspeak was very cold. All men except that one, anyway. He doesn\u0027t have to wonder, for he can always find out for himself, afterwards, when they\u0027re dead.\\n\\n And with that the Necroscope was sure she\u0027d give him all she could. \u0027Tell me about it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n And she did...\\n\\n It was a Friday night and I went to the dance. Being freelance, my time was my own. I didn\u0027t need a pimp touting for me, taking my money and bringing his friends round for freebies. But the dance was in town and I lived quite a few miles out. After the midnight hour taxis are expensive; Cinders needed her coach home.\\n\\n That was OK; there are always a handful of likely lads who\u0027ll buzz a girl home on the chance of a grope. And if I liked the guy and if he wasn\u0027t too pushy, maybe he could get more than a grope. A ride for a ride, as the saying goes.\\n\\n On this occasion I picked the wrong one: no, not our man, but an armful all the same. Once I was in the car his polite, concerned attitude went right out the window. He didn\u0027t know what I was, thought I was just a straight kid but easy meat. He could hardly drive for drooling and wanted to stop in every layby and back alley. I was wearing expensive clothes and didn\u0027t want them ripped up. And anyway I didn\u0027t like him.\\n\\n He said he knew a place just off the motorway, and before I could tell him I didn\u0027t need it he took the fly-on for Edinburgh. In a layby under some trees he made his move, and got my knee in his soft bits for his trouble! When he could drive again he did, but left me stranded there.\\n\\n There was a service station a quarter-mile up the motorway. I went there and had a coffee. I wasn\u0027t shaken up or anything, just dehydrated. Too many gin-and-its at the Palace.\\n\\n But sitting there in this little booth I was joined by a driver. That was how I saw him: a driver. A long-distance man shaking off his weariness with a mug of coffee.\\n\\n Don\u0027t ask me what he looked like; the place was three-quarters empty and they\u0027d turned the lights low to keep the bills down, and there was still a lot of gin in me. I spoke to him but I didn\u0027t really look at him, you know? Anyway, he didn\u0027t seem a bad sort and he wasn\u0027t pushy. When he finished his coffee and made to stand up, I asked him which way he was heading.\\n\\n \u0027Where do you want to go?\u0027 he said. His voice was soft, not unfriendly.\\n\\n I told him where I lived and he said he knew it. \u0027Your luck\u0027s in,\u0027 he told me. \u0027I go past it on the motorway. About five miles from here? There\u0027s a flyoff where I can drop you. A couple of hundred yards and you\u0027ll be at your door. Can\u0027t take you any closer than that, I\u0027m afraid, because my miles and fuel are monitored. Anyway, it\u0027s up to you. Maybe you\u0027d feel safer calling a taxi?\u0027\\n\\n But I wasn\u0027t one to look a gift horse in the mouth.\\n\\n We left the cafeteria and went out into the lorry park. He was cool and calm, in no hurry. I felt perfectly safe with him. In fact I didn\u0027t give it a thought. His vehicle was one of these big articulated jobs, which we approached from the side and the rear. The headlights of a passing car as it flashed by on the motorway lit it up in a swath of light. The lorry had ice-blue panels with white lettering saying: frigis express. I remember it well because the white paint had peeled off one leg of the \u0027X\u0027 making it look like eypress.\\n\\n But at the back of the lorry my driver paused and looked at me, and said: \u0027I just have to make sure this door is secure.\u0027\\n\\n I stood beside him as he unlocked and slid up this roller door across the full width of the truck. A blast of ice-cold air came out, which made me shiver as it turned to a cloud of mist. Inside... there seemed to be rows of things hanging in there, but it was dark and I couldn\u0027t see what they were. He reached inside with both hands and did something, then looked over his shoulder and said, \u0027It\u0027s OK.\u0027 And I think it was then I realized that I hadn\u0027t seen him smile. Not once.\\n\\n He indicated we should go to the cab, and as he started to pull the door down again I turned away from him. That was when he grabbed me from behind. One arm went round my neck and the other hand held something over my face. Of course I gasped for air - and got chloroform!\\n\\n I kicked and struggled, but that only makes you gasp all the more! And then I passed out...\\n\\n When I came to I was lying - or slithering about - on a patch of ice: that\u0027s what it felt like, anyway. There was a smell but I couldn\u0027t quite make out what it was. I was much too cold; all my senses were numb from the cold. And I felt dizzy and nauseous from the chloroform.\\n\\n Then I remembered everything and knew I was in the back of the truck, slipping and slithering when he applied his brakes or accelerated. And of course I also knew I was in trouble, in fact dead trouble. Whatever my driver wanted, he was going to get it. And then there was a fair chance that he\u0027d kill me. I\u0027d seen his truck; I could more or less describe him, if not now, certainly later; it was odds on I was a goner.\\n\\n I propped myself in one corner of the dark refrigerator (I suppose that\u0027s what it was: a large mobile fridge, a freezer truck) and tried to get some warmth back into my body. I hugged myself, blew on my hands, beat my arms about. But I was weak from the cold and the after-effect of the chloroform. I didn\u0027t have the strength of a kitten.\\n\\n Then, after - oh, I don\u0027t know how long, maybe fifteen minutes - there was a bumpy patch and I heard his airbrakes go on. To this day I don\u0027t know where we were, for I never did see the outside again. The truck stopped; in a little while the door rolled up and it was dark outside; a dark figure clambered up panting into the rear of the trailer. He pulled the door shut again and put on a dim interior light, just a single bulb under a grille in the ceiling. And then he came for me.\\n\\n He was wearing a long coat which was all dark-stained leather on the outside and brown fur inside; he took it off as he approached me and threw it down on me. \u0027Get on it,\u0027 he said, panting with some weird emotion. But his voice was just as cold as the place where he planned to have me, which I now saw was a meat safe. Beast carcases, all grey, brown and red, hung from rows of hooks. And the layer of ice on the floor was frozen beast blood.\\n\\n There... there doesn\u0027t have to be any rough stuff,\u0027 I told him. \u0027We can do it just as you say.\u0027 And freezing cold though I was I opened my blouse and hitched up my mini to show him my frilly panties.\\n\\n He looked down on me in that unsmiling way of his, and I saw that his face was all puffy and bloated, and his eyes winking like little lumps of shiny coal in the swollen red mask of his face. \u0027Just as I say?\u0027 He repeated my words.\\n\\n \u0027Any way at all. And I swear it will be good. Only just don\u0027t hurt me. And you can trust me. Afterwards ... I won\u0027t say a word.\u0027 I lied like hell. I wanted to live.\\n\\n Take \u0027em off,\u0027 he panted. \u0027Everything.\u0027\\n\\n God, there was no soul behind his voice, nothing behind his eyes. There was just the steam-heat of his body and the pounding of his feverish blood. I could feel how strong he was, and how weird and different. \u0027Quickly!\u0027 he said, and his voice was a croak and his gorged face was wobbling with strain and horrible excitement.\\n\\n I had to do what he told me, keep him happy. But I was so cold my fingers wouldn\u0027t obey me. I couldn\u0027t get my clothes off. He got down on one knee and I could see tools glinting in the loops of his wide leather belt. One of them was a meat-hook, which he took out and showed me!\\n\\n When I gasped and turned my face away, he tore my jacket right off my back; my blouse, too. Then he put the hook in the top of my skirt and ripped it down through the plastic belt and material, laying it open. He ripped open my panties in the same way. And all I could do was huddle there as cold as one of the dead animals on its hook. And I thought: What if he uses that hook on me? But he didn\u0027t. Not the hook.\\n\\n Then he was tearing his clothes off: not his upper clothes, just his pants. And I knew this was it. But a man as strong and as dangerous as this could hurt me badly. I had to make it as easy for him - as easy for myself - as possible. I opened my legs and stroked my bush of cold hair. And God help me, I tried to smile at him. \u0027It\u0027s all here,\u0027 I said, my words turning to snow as they came out. \u0027All for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 he grunted, looking at me, his penis huge and jerking about on its own, with a life of its own. \u0027All for me? All for Johnny? That?\u0027 And then he smiled. And he took up another of his tools.\\n\\n This one was like a knife, but it was hollow and had been cut from steel tubing about an inch and a half in diameter, cut at an angle, to give it a sharp point. And its edges had been sharpened to razor brightness.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, God!\u0027 I gasped then, for I couldn\u0027t hold my terror any longer. And I clutched at myself and tried to cover my nakedness. But my driver, my all-too-soon-to-be murderer, that... that thing, he only laughed. There was no emotion in it, not as I understood emotion, but he laughed anyway.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, cover yourself,\u0027 he gurgled at me, the saliva of his lust overflowing from his wobbling, grimacing mouth. \u0027Cover it up, girlie. For Johnny doesn\u0027t want your ugly little fuckie hole. Johnny makes his own holes!\u0027\\n\\n He moved closer and his flesh was alive and leaping, bursting for me. And then... and then...\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s OK.\u0027 It was as much as Harry could bear. His voice was trembling, broken. \u0027I know what then. You\u0027ve said enough. I ... I\u0027ll go on what I have.\u0027\\n\\n Pamela was crying now, spilling out her poor mutilated soul, all of her defiance and resilience crushed and drained from her by the horror of what she\u0027d forced herself to remember for the Necroscope.\\n\\n He ... he made my body ugly! she sobbed. He made holes in me! Before I was dead he was into me. And after I was dead I could still feel him grunting on me, hurting me. It\u0027s not right that when you\u0027re dead someone should still be able to hurt you, Harry.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s OK, it\u0027s OK,\u0027 was all Harry could say to comfort her. But even saying it he knew it wasn\u0027t, knew it wouldn\u0027t be until he himself had put this thing right.\\n\\n She took this from his deadspeak, understood his resolve, reinforced his anger with her own. Get him for me, Harry! Get that dog\u0027s bastard for me!\\n\\n \u0027And for myself,\u0027 he told her. \u0027For if I don\u0027t I know he\u0027ll always be there, clinging like slime to the walls of my mind. But, Pamela - \u0027\\n\\n Yes?\\n\\n \u0027Simply killing this one won\u0027t be enough. I mean, it\u0027s just not enough! But if you\u0027re willing, there\u0027s a way you can help me. You\u0027re strong, Pamela, in death just as you were in life. And what I have in mind ... I believe it\u0027s something you would enjoy even more than you did in life.\u0027 He explained his meaning, and for a little while she was silent.\\n\\n Then: I think I know now why the dead are afraid of you, Harry, she said, wonderingly. And: Is it true that you\u0027re a vampire?\\n\\n \u0027Yes... no!\u0027 he said. \u0027Not like that. Not yet, anyway. And not here. But somewhere else I will be - or may be -one day.\u0027\\n\\n Yes. He sensed her nod. I think you must be - or will be - for nothing human could ever think the thought you thought just then. Nothing entirely human, anyway.\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027ll do it?\u0027\\n\\n Oh, yes, she answered him at last with a grim, emphatic deadspeak nod. Who or whatever you are, I\u0027ll do anything you tell me, Harry Keogh, vampire, Necroscope. Anything, everything and whatever it takes to get even. Whatever you ask and whenever you ask it. Anything...\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027So be it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n For the next thirty-odd hours the Necroscope was busy; not only him but E-Branch, too. And the next day, a warm evening in mid-May, the Minister Responsible caused the Branch emergency call-in system to be brought into play.\\n\\n First, acting on disturbing information received from Geoffrey Paxton (concerning among other things the files Darcy Clarke had mailed to Harry Keogh), the Minister had relieved Clarke of all duties and placed him under what amounted to house arrest at Clarke\u0027s own north London flat in Crouch End. Second, he must now attend the O-group briefing he\u0027d called at E-Branch HQ. The espers would know, of course, that something big was in the offing: all available agents were to be present.\\n\\n Paxton was there to meet the Minister on the ground floor. Even as they exchanged curt greetings Ben Trask, just back from a job, came in from the street through the swing doors. Trask looked drawn, even haggard. The Minister took him to one side where they conversed in lowered tones for a minute or two, and for once Paxton knew enough to keep his nose out. Then they all three took the elevator upstairs and went directly to the ops room.\\n\\n The called-in agents were silent, seated, waiting for the Minister. He took the podium and his eyes swept the mainly ordinary-looking faces of the espers - Britain\u0027s ESP-endowed mindspies - where they stared back at him. He knew them all from photographs in their files, but only Darcy Clarke and Ben Trask had ever met him. And Paxton, of course.\\n\\n If Clarke had been here, perhaps he would have stood up as a sign of respect, and maybe the rest of them would have followed suit. Or there again maybe not. The trouble with this lot had always been that they thought they were special. But here the Minister knew he wasn\u0027t fooling anybody, least of all himself. They were special, bloody special!\\n\\n And looking at them he felt as several before him must surely have felt. Physics and metaphysics, robots and romantics, gadgets and ghosts. Two sides of the same coin. Were they really? Science and parapsychology? The mundane and the supernatural? And he wondered what was the difference anyway? Isn\u0027t a telephone or radio magic? To speak with someone on the other side of the world, even on the moon? And has there ever been a more powerful, more monstrous spell or invocation than E\u003dmc2?\\n\\n These were some of the Minister\u0027s thoughts as he scanned the faces of E-Branch\u0027s espers and put names to them: Ben Trask, the human lie-detector; blocky, overweight, mousey-haired and green-eyed, slope-shouldered and lugubrious. Possibly Trask\u0027s sad expression sprang from the knowledge that the whole world was a liar. Or if not all of it, a hell of a lot of it. It was Trask\u0027s talent: to recognize whatever was false. Show him or tell him a lie and he would know it at once. He wouldn\u0027t always know the truth of the thing, but he would always know when what was represented as true wasn\u0027t so. No facade, however cleverly constructed, could ever fool him. The police used him a lot, to crack stone killers; also he came in handy in respect of international negotiations, when it was good to know if the cards on the table made a full deck.\\n\\n David Chung: a young Londoner, a locator and scryer of the highest quality. He was slight, wiry, slant-eyed and yellow as they come. But he was British, loyal, and his talent was amazing. He tracked Soviet nuclear \u0027stealth\u0027 subs, IRA units in the field, drug-runners. Especially the latter. Chung\u0027s parents had been addicts, and their addiction had killed them. That\u0027s where his talent had started, and it was still growing.\\n\\n Anna Marie English was something else. (But weren\u0027t they all?) Twenty-three, bespectacled, enervated, pallid and dowdy, she was hardly an English rose! That was a direct result of her talent, for she was \u0027as one with the Earth\u0027: her way of defining it. She felt the rain forests being eaten away; she knew the extent of the ozone holes; when the deserts expanded she felt their desiccation, and the mass erosion of mountain soil made her physically sick. She was \u0027ecologically aware\u0027 beyond the five senses of mundane mankind. Greenpeace could base their entire campaign on her, except no one would believe. The Branch did believe, and used her as it used David Chung: as a tracker. She tracked illicit nuclear waste, monitored pollution, warned of invasions of Colorado beetle and Dutch elm disease, cried aloud the extinction of whales, elephants, dolphins, other species. And she knew that the Earth was sick and growing sicker. She only had to look in the mirror each day to know that.\\n\\n Then there was Geoffrey Paxton, a telepath, one of several. An unpleasant person, the Minister thought, but his talent was useful. And it takes all sorts to make a world. Paxton was ambitious, he wanted it all. Better to employ him where he too could be watched than have him turn to high-stakes blackmail or become the mindspy agent of some foreign power. Later... Paxton\u0027s would be a career worth following. And closely.\\n\\n Sixteen of them gathered here, under one roof, and eleven more out in various parts of the world, guiding that world, or at least watching over it. They were paid according to their talents, handsomely! And they were worth every penny. It would cost a lot more if they ever decided to work for themselves...\\n\\n Sixteen of them, and as the Minister\u0027s eyes roved over them so they studied him: a man who so far had kept himself to the shadows and would prefer to stay there, except that now some affair of the utmost moment had lured him out. He was in his mid-forties, small and dapper, dark hair brushed back and plastered down. And he had no nerves to speak of, or none that was visible, anyway. He wore patent-leather black shoes, a dark-blue suit and light-blue tie. His brow had a few wrinkles but other than these his face was normally unlined, and his eyes were bright, clear and blue. Right now, though, and especially since his conversation with Ben Trask, he was looking harried.\\n\\n \u0027Ladies, gentlemen,\u0027 (he wasn\u0027t one for preamble), \u0027what I have to say would seem fantastic to almost anyone outside these walls, as would almost everything that goes on within them. But I\u0027ll try not to bore you with too many things you already know. Mainly, I\u0027ve gathered you together to tell you we have one hell of a problem. First I\u0027ll tell you how it came to be, and how it came to light. Then you\u0027ll have to tell me how we\u0027re going to deal with it, in which instance I know that even the least of you - if there is such a thing - has more practical experience than I have. In fact, you\u0027re the only people with practical experience of these things, and so the only ones who can deal with the matter in hand.\u0027\\n\\n He took a deep breath, then continued: \u0027Some time ago we appointed a traitor as head of E-Branch. I\u0027m talking about Wellesley, yes. Well, he can\u0027t do any more harm. But after him it was my job to make sure it couldn\u0027t happen again. In short, we needed someone who was capable of spying on the spies. Now, I know you people have an unwritten code: you don\u0027t spy on each other. So I couldn\u0027t use one of you, not in situ anyway. I had to take one of you out of the Branch and make him responsible to myself alone. And I had to do it before he could build up too many loyalties. So I chose Geoffrey Paxton, a relative newcomer, as my watcher over the watchers.\u0027\\n\\n He at once held up his hands, as if to ward off protests, though none was forthcoming - as yet. \u0027None of you, and I do mean none of you, was suspect in any way. But after Wellesley I couldn\u0027t take any chances. Still, I\u0027d like to have it understood that your personal lives are still yours, and no tampering. Paxton has always been under the strictest instructions not to interfere or pry into anything extraneous, but confine himself solely to Branch business. Which is to say, Branch security.\\n\\n \u0027A few weeks ago we had some business in the Mediterranean. Two of our members, Layard and Jordan, had come up against... unpleasant opposition. It was the worst sort of business, but not without precedent. The head of E-Branch, Darcy Clarke, went out there with Harry Keogh and Sandra Markham to see what could be done. Later, Trask and Chung joined them, and they also had help from other quarters. As for qualifications: Clarke and Trask both had experience of that sort of thing, and Keogh... well, Keogh is Keogh. If he could be reactivated, get his talents back, that would be a wonderful bonus for the Branch. But initially he went out as an observer and adviser, for no one knew more about vampirism than he did...\u0027 (And here he paused, perhaps significantly.)\\n\\n \u0027Now, we still don\u0027t know exactly what happened out there in Rhodes, the Greek islands, Romania, but we do know that we lost Trevor Jordan, Ken Layard and Sandra Markham. I mean lost them dead! So it can be seen they had a real problem, one which Darcy Clarke would have us believe is now... resolved? Harry Keogh, of course, could tell us everything, but so far he\u0027s chosen to tell us very little.\u0027\\n\\n By now the breathing of the Minister\u0027s audience was quite audible, perhaps even heavy, impatient; and he saw that someone had stood up. Since the light was on the podium he had to squint to see who it was on his feet back there in the shadows, but in a little while he made it out to be the very tall, skeletally thin hunchman or prognosticator Ian Goodly. \u0027Yes, Mr Goodly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Minister,\u0027 Goodly answered, his high-pitched voice shrill but not unnaturally or unusually so, \u0027I know you won\u0027t be offended by any sort of imagined implication when I say that so far every word you\u0027ve said has been spoken with absolute honesty and integrity. It came straight from the heart, was told the way you see it and with the best of intentions. I don\u0027t think anyone here doubts that, or that it takes a brave sort of man to come in here and try to tell us anything, especially in the knowledge that there are people here who could pick your mind clean in a moment.\u0027\\n\\n The Minister nodded. \u0027I don\u0027t know about the bravery bit, but everything else is correct. What\u0027s more it puts any sort of subterfuge right out of the question; it can be seen - you people can surely see - that I have no axe to grind. So ... are you making a point, Mr Goodly?\u0027\\n\\n The point is that I do have an axe to grind, sir,\u0027 Goodly answered, quietly. \u0027We all do. And the way this briefing is going, it strikes me as likely we could have several axes to grind before you\u0027re through. Not with you, you understand. That would be pointless anyway, for my talent tells me that you\u0027re going to be our Minister Responsible for a long time to come. So ... not with what you\u0027ve said or what you think, but maybe with what you\u0027ve done and plan to do. Or plan to ask us to do. Unless, of course, there are some damn good reasons.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you mind explaining?\u0027 The Minister\u0027s confusion was mounting. \u0027But briefly, because I really do have to get on, and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Explanations are easy.\u0027 Someone else was on his - no, her - feet: Millicent Cleary, a pretty little telepath whose talent was as yet embryonic. She merely glanced at the Minister but scowled furiously at the back of Paxton\u0027s head where he sat in the first row of seats. \u0027Some explanations, anyway. I mean, it was inevitable we\u0027d be monitored eventually, but... by that?\u0027 And still scowling, she tossed her head to give the final word extra emphasis. She was pointing at Paxton.\\n\\n \u0027Miss, er - ?\u0027 In his confusion the Minister had forgotten her name. He prided himself on not forgetting names. He looked at her, looked at Paxton.\\n\\n \u0027Cleary,\u0027 she said. \u0027Millicent...\u0027 And she breathlessly continued: \u0027Paxton didn\u0027t follow your instructions. He simply ignored your orders. Branch security? Branch business? Oh, that was the handy excuse you gave him - which he scarcely needed - but other people\u0027s business, more like! And his nose right in it!\u0027\\n\\n The Minister was frowning. He looked harder at Paxton. \u0027Can you be more specific, Miss Cleary?\u0027\\n\\n But she wouldn\u0027t. She could but wouldn\u0027t. What, and tell everyone here that during Paxton\u0027s first month with the Branch she\u0027d caught the shrivelled little scumbag in her mind one night, playing with himself to the purr of her vibrator and the tingling of her senses?\\n\\n \u0027He looked at all of us.\u0027 Someone else saved her, his voice strong and gravelly. \u0027He looked at the juicy bits, which like it or not we each and every one of us have, and he was doing it before you gave him his brief! Since when, why ... by now he\u0027s probably looked at your juicy bits, too!\u0027\\n\\n And back to the gangling Goodly again: \u0027Minister, if you hadn\u0027t taken Paxton out of the organization, we would have. He\u0027s about as trustworthy as a defective contraceptive. If AIDS was a psychic disease, all our brains would be shrivelling to shit right now! All of them!\u0027\\n\\n He paused to let that sink in, and after a moment: \u0027So it seems to us that what you\u0027ve done is to take away the one man we all trust, while at the same time giving us a watchdog who snaps at his keepers. Yes, and you\u0027ve chosen one hell of a time to do it.\u0027 That was twice he\u0027d cursed, and it wasn\u0027t Goodly\u0027s style to swear at all, not even mildly.\\n\\n Paxton had been cleaning his fingernails, apparently unconcerned, but now his ears reddened up a little. He stood up and turned round, glared at the others where they all stared at him in silent accusation. \u0027My talent is... unruly!\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Also it\u0027s eager, full of all the enthusiasm which you jealous bastards have lost! I\u0027m still finding out about it, still experimenting. It isn\u0027t some bloody bonsai tree you can just force into any old shape!\u0027\\n\\n Almost as one person they shook their heads; they were the last people he should ever try to convince; his pallid, lame excuses wouldn\u0027t work on them. Each and every one of them, they had it in for Paxton. Finally Ben Trask spoke up, giving their single unified thought shape and substance. \u0027You\u0027re a liar, Paxton,\u0027 he said, quite simply. And because Trask was what he was, he didn\u0027t have to enlarge upon his accusation.\\n\\n The Minister felt as if he\u0027d bumped into a hornets\u0027 nest and for his pains (or by them) was being driven off course, which he really couldn\u0027t afford to let happen. He held up his hands, took on a harder, more authoritative tone of voice. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, put your feuding and personal feelings aside!\u0027 he cried. \u0027At least for the moment, or for as long as it takes. Whatever else any one of you is or isn\u0027t, there\u0027s one thing we can at least be sure of: you\u0027re all human!\u0027\\n\\n Which hit them like a truck.\\n\\n Seeing that he now had their attention, and while he retained the upper hand, the Minister turned pleadingly to Ben Trask. \u0027Mr Trask - but level-headed, if you please - will you repeat what you told me downstairs?\u0027\\n\\n Trask looked at him grudgingly but nodded. \u0027Only first let me finish telling them what you started. They already know most of it and have probably guessed the rest, so I\u0027ll get straight to it. And it just might come easier if they hear it from me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 the Minister replied, sighing his relief.\\n\\n And Trask began:\\n\\n \u0027Zek Föener gave us a helping hand in the Greek islands,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ll know who she is from the Keogh files, what happened at Perchorsk and on Starside, etc. She\u0027s a powerful telepath, one of the world\u0027s best. But like the Necroscope himself she\u0027s opted out of cloak and daggery.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, it was dodgy out there in the Med. We were killing vampires, and there were plenty of times when they nearly killed us. But Harry took the brunt of it and went up against the Big One, Janos Ferenczy himself -and I know I don\u0027t have to tell you about the Ferenczys. When Harry was in Romania that last time, just before the end, Zek tried to get in touch with him to see how things were going. But telepathy over great distances isn\u0027t easy and she didn\u0027t get too much. At least that\u0027s what she told us, but we could see that what she did get shocked her rigid.\\n\\n \u0027I know Darcy Clarke has been worried stiff about it, for the fact is Darcy thinks the Necroscope\u0027s the best thing since sliced bread. I know several of you also think so, and, hell, so do I! Or I used to ...\\n\\n \u0027So ... we did the job and came back, and as far as we know Harry was successful, too. It seems he made a great job of it. Except he\u0027s been a bit cagey about what actually happened up in the Carpathians. Now me, I haven\u0027t read too much into that. Nor has Darcy Clarke. For after all, Harry did lose Sandra Markham out there. So Darcy was going to let him get it off his chest in his own good time.\\n\\n \u0027For which - or so it would seem - Darcy\u0027s been sort of \"reduced to the ranks\", de-commissioned, bust, etc. But for what, that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know? For inefficiency, in that he maybe didn\u0027t want to prejudge an old friend? For holding back awhile and not going off half-cocked? For having - shit - just a little faith!?\u0027\\n\\n Both the Minister and Paxton opened their mouths as if to butt in, but Trask cut them out with: The thing you have to remember about Darcy Clarke is this: that his talent doesn\u0027t go sneaking into other people\u0027s minds, eavesdropping or spying from a distance. All it does is look after Darcy. But he\u0027s kept in touch with the Necroscope and so far there\u0027s nothing to report. Darcy\u0027s talent didn\u0027t warn him of any immediate danger. If it had... you can bet your life he\u0027d have been the first to yell! The last thing he\u0027d want is for another Yulian Bodescu to be out and about!\u0027 \u0027But - \u0027 Paxton started.\\n\\n \u0027Shut your face!\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027These people are still listening to someone telling the truth! Only the truth...\u0027 And he eventually continued: \u0027Anyway, that was all yesterday and today is today. And now things seem to have changed...\u0027 He paused and looked at the Minister. \u0027Did you want to take it from there, sir?\u0027\\n\\n The Minister gave him a grim look and raised an eyebrow. \u0027But you haven\u0027t told it all, Mr Trask.\u0027\\n\\n Trask gritted his teeth but nodded. And after a moment: \u0027I\u0027m just back from a job,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s this serial killer thing we\u0027ve been working on, these brutal, horrific murders of young women. The thing is, Darcy had approached Harry for his help on this one, because... you know... that\u0027s what the Necroscope is: the one man in the world who can talk to a victim after she\u0027s dead. And Darcy told me how Harry had been especially upset by the death of the latest one, a girl called Penny Sanderson.\\n\\n \u0027Well, two days ago Penny turned up - like a bad Penny, eh?\u0027 But he wasn\u0027t grinning. \u0027Now this girl was dead and gone for ever, and yet suddenly here she is, right as rain, back home with her old folks. And the point is she couldn\u0027t even convince them that she hadn\u0027t been murdered! They had seen her body; they\u0027d known it was their daughter; they regarded her return as nothing short of a miracle.\\n\\n The police weren\u0027t happy with any of this. Oh, she had a story to tell, but it rang like a cracked bell. And if she really was Penny Sanderson, then who had been cremated? So the Minister sent me up there to sit on a \"standard police procedure interview\". Of course, I was their lie-detector.\\n\\n \u0027Well, she was - is - Penny Sanderson; she wasn\u0027t lying about that. But she was lying about her loss of memory and what all. So knowing the Keogh connection, I just sort of thought to ask her if she knew him: had she ever heard of him or met him? And she said no, never, and just looked blank. A bare-faced lie! Which led to my next question, except I didn\u0027t frame it like a question. I simply shrugged and said: \"You\u0027re a lucky girl. It might easily have been you who was dead and not your double.\"\\n\\n \u0027And she looked me straight in the eye and said: \"I\u0027m sorry for her, whoever she was, but she had nothing to do with me. I didn\u0027t die.\" And again she was lying through her teeth. Well, I trust my talent. It never has let me down. She wasn\u0027t sorry for the other girl because there wasn\u0027t another girl. And her statement that she didn\u0027t die? A funny way of putting it at best, right? So the only conclusion I can come to is that Penny Sanderson did die, and that she\u0027s now... back from the dead!\u0027\\n\\n The gathered espers let their air out in a concerted sigh. All of them. And Trask finished off with: \u0027Of course, I couldn\u0027t tell the police she\u0027d been - what the hell - brought back, resurrected? So I simply said she was OK. Just how \"OK\" she is ... well, that\u0027s a different matter.\u0027\\n\\n At which point the Minister Responsible took his best yet opportunity to introduce a further item of damning information. \u0027Clarke sent Keogh the files on all those murdered girls. And up in the Castle on the Mount in Edinburgh, he actually let the Necroscope talk to Penny Sanderson - er, in his own way, you understand.\u0027\\n\\n Ben Trask, despite what he himself had just related, still wasn\u0027t one hundred per cent convinced. \u0027But at the time, wasn\u0027t that the idea? So that Harry could find out who killed her?\u0027\\n\\n The Minister nodded. \u0027That was the idea.\u0027 He dabbed at his face with a handkerchief. \u0027But a bad one, it now seems.\u0027\\n\\n It was Paxton\u0027s turn. \u0027He\u0027s a telepath,\u0027 he said, his voice hard-edged, defiant.\\n\\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 Ben Trask stared at him.\\n\\n Paxton nodded. \u0027He was into my mind like a ferret down a rat-hole! He warned me off and told me he wouldn\u0027t be warning me again. Also, his eyes were feral: they shone behind those dark glasses he wears. And he doesn\u0027t much care for the sunlight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve really been hard at work, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 Trask growled. But this time he couldn\u0027t accuse him of lying.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 said the other, \u0027I was given a job to do. Like the Minister said, after Wellesley he couldn\u0027t take any chances. So when Clarke came back from the Greek islands I hooked into him. And I learned about his suspicion that maybe Keogh was a vampire. Another thing: Keogh told me to tell the Minister that his \"worst nightmare\" had come true. Ergo: Keogh\u0027s a vampire!\u0027\\n\\n The Minister was quick to add: \u0027That last isn\u0027t proven yet. But it is starting to look that way. The thing is, Keogh has had a lot of contact with these creatures. Close contact. Maybe this last time there was a little too much contact.\u0027\\n\\n Paxton again: \u0027Look, I know I\u0027m a relative newcomer, and you don\u0027t much like me, and in the past you\u0027ve all had reason to be grateful for Harry Keogh. But have these things blinded you to the facts? OK, so you don\u0027t want to believe me - don\u0027t even want to believe yourselves - but just think what we\u0027re up against if we\u0027re right.\\n\\n \u0027He can talk to the dead, who apparently know a hell of a lot. He uses the Möbius Continuum to go anywhere he wants to, instantly, like we take a step into another room. He\u0027s a telepath. And now he not only speaks to the dead but calls them back, too!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He could do that before,\u0027 said Ben Trask, not without a shudder.\\n\\n \u0027But now he calls them back to what looks like life.\u0027 Paxton was relentless. \u0027From their ashes! Life? Or undeath?\u0027\\n\\n At which David Chung gave a mighty start, reeled like someone had hit him, and choked something out in Cantonese. Most of the espers were on their feet by now, but Chung gropingly found a chair and flopped down again. Frowning, the Minister Responsible said, \u0027Mister Chung?\u0027\\n\\n Chung\u0027s pallor gave his face a sickly lemon tint. He wiped his shining brow and licked his lips, and again mumbled something to himself in Chinese. Then he looked up and his eyes were wide. \u0027You all know what I do,\u0027 he said, his words a little sibilant and clipped in his fashion. \u0027I\u0027m a locator, sympathetic. I take a model or a piece of something and use it to find the real thing. It\u0027s Branch policy that I take and keep safe from each one of you a small item of your personal belongings. This is for your own safety: if you go missing, I can find you.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I also have several items belonging to Harry Keogh, stuff he\u0027s left here from time to time...\\n\\n \u0027I was out in the Mediterranean with the others. I knew Zek Föener had been worried about something, and so I too have been keeping tabs on Harry. I told myself it was for his own good. But I knew what I was doing and what I was looking for.\\n\\n \u0027At first when I scried on him it was just him; there was nothing different; it felt right. I got a picture of him, you know? Not doing anything, just a picture of him as I knew him, up there at his home in Edinburgh or wherever he was. But recently the picture has been dim, misty, and last night and this morning there wasn\u0027t much of Harry there at all; just a mist, a fog. I was going to submit a report on it tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the old days,\u0027 Trask said, \u0027we used to call that mind-smog. It\u0027s what you get when you try to scan a vampire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Chung nodded. He was more nearly recovered now. \u0027It was partly that which hit me, and partly something else. Paxton said that Harry could call dead people up from their ashes. That\u0027s what hit me the most.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 the Minister was frowning again.\\n\\n Chung looked at him. \u0027I also have things which used to belong to Trevor Jordan,\u0027 he said. \u0027And this morning, just by accident, I happened to touch one of them. It was like Trevor was right here, right next door or down the street. And I thought it was something out of my memory. It was there and then it was gone. But it just struck me that he very well could have been here, just down the street!\u0027\\n\\n The Minister still hadn\u0027t taken it in, but Trask soon took care of that. Pale as a ghost, he whispered: \u0027My God! Jordan was cremated out in Rhodes, burned to ashes in case he\u0027d been infected with vampirism. But Jesus, now that I think of it, I remember how it was Harry Keogh who insisted on it!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-7.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
