{"id":62528,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The Hunters and the Hunted Harry Keogh, Necroscope and would-be avenger, had thought at first that it would not be especially difficult to track down his quarry: a young driver working for Frigis Express, who also happened to be a necromancer, sex monster, and the insane serial killer of (to date) six young women. But he\u0027d soon discovered that it wouldn\u0027t be nearly as simple as he\u0027d thought. Frigis had a dozen branches up and down the country, with a like number of warehouses and freezer depots, and over two hundred trucks of which fifty per cent were on the roads at any given hour of the day or night. The firm must therefore employ quite a few drivers who would fit the vague description in Harry\u0027s possession; (vague, yes, for he suspected that the bloated, lusting creature he\u0027d been shown was more a figure of terrified imagination than of the real man). Also, it seemed likely that Frigis would use casual labour, and it could be that Harry\u0027s man was one of these; but somewhere there should be a list of regular employees at least. Harry hoped to find that list, and also that the John or \u0027Johnny\u0027 he was looking for would be on it. On the third Wednesday in May at 3:30 in the morning, he paid a visit to Frigis\u0027s main office in London to have a look at the company\u0027s books. He went there via the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, making several stops at well-known exit points before finally emerging in a shop doorway in Oxford Street. At that hour the normally polluted air was almost wholly free of traffic fumes and even bracing, and the night-lighting loaned the street a certain alien luminosity. Large, lethargically flapping pages from a discarded, dismembered newspaper fluttered like strange slow birds on buffets of blustery air along the gutters. The offices Harry was looking for were directly opposite; no lights showed within the building; he hoped there\u0027d be no night watchman to complicate matters. And there wasn\u0027t. Entering the building by the M\u0026ouml;bius route, Harry let his burgeoning vampire instincts guide him to the correct floor and then to the records office. Locked doors were no trouble at all to the Necroscope, who used numbers to conjure doors of his own out of the thin air. But twice, purely out of habit, he went to switch on lights before realizing that he no longer had need of them; and once he came face to face with a full-length mirror, which both shocked and fascinated him with its picture of a gaunt-faced man with luminous, red-tinged eyes. He had known of course that the change was taking place in him, but only then realized how quickly it was happening. It filled him with mixed emotions and alien longings; it was the night and the mystery, and the going in strange places, as if in search of prey. Well, and so he was. Except there is prey and there is prey... The records office was dirty and untidy, and smelled of strong coffee and stale cigarette smoke. It had an antiquated system of filing cabinets, all open for Harry\u0027s inspection. He quickly turned up a list of branch and depot managers, but no information on rank-and-file employees. There was, however, a list of addresses and telephone numbers of all Frigis Express\u0027s subsidiary offices, which Harry pocketed. That should save him a little time, at least. But that was all there was, which was hardly satisfactory. Disgruntled, Harry pondered over his next move: presumably to start at the top of the list of branches and work down it. But then, out of nowhere, he found himself wondering if maybe Trevor Jordan was up and about. He could use a cup of coffee, a little companionship and friendly conversation, someone... to be with - briefly, anyway - if only to work the weirdness out of his system. It was unlikely Jordan would be awake, but just on the off chance Harry reached out with his telepathic mind and searched for him - and immediately found him. Harry? Jordan\u0027s unmistakable \u0027voice\u0027 sounded in Harry\u0027s mind as clearly as if he\u0027d whispered the words in his ear. Is that you? Harry found telepathy similar to and yet quite different from deadspeak. He had used something like it before - a sort of reverse deadspeak, he supposed - but that had been quite a few years ago in his incorporeal days and also very different. Telepathy was therefore new to him. Even so, still it struck him as being... more natural? Well, and he supposed it was more natural. For after all, almost anything in the world would be. But telepathy: it was something like a telephone conversation, even down to the hiss and crackle of psychic \u0027static\u0027; whereas dead-speak was the wind whistling eerily down a bleak desert canyon under a full, floating moon. In short, it was the difference between talking mind-to-mind with living people, and conversing metaphysically with dead ones. And yet Jordan had seemed wary, unsure of Harry\u0027s identity and even unwilling to reveal his own. Just why that should be the Necroscope couldn\u0027t guess. He frowned and asked, Who else would it be, Trevor? And hearing his voice, Jordan knew him at once. But his mind-sigh (of relief?) warned Harry that something was very wrong. Likewise what he said next: Harry, you know my old place in Barnet? That\u0027s where I am. But I can\u0027t say for how long. I\u0027d like to get out of here. I don\u0027t want to explain right now - it mightn\u0027t even be safe to - but do you think you could get round here? I mean, like now? What\u0027s the trouble? Harry was switched on now, alert to danger. And he could still sense Jordan\u0027s uncertainty. Harry, I don\u0027t know. I came down to London to see if I could maybe find something out for you, but I\u0027ve been blocked all along the line, almost from the start. I came here to watch them, E-Branch, but hell... I didn\u0027t think there\u0027d be anyone watching me! Right now? Right now, yes. I\u0027m on my way, said Harry. Air made a small implosion into the empty space where he stepped through a M\u0026ouml;bius door, its draught causing papers to rustle in a filing cabinet he\u0027d left standing open. But before the papers had stopped rustling Harry had tracked down Jordan\u0027s thoughts to Barnet. He emerged silently into the resurrected telepath\u0027s front room, whose first-floor bay windows overlooked a cobbled cul-de-sac, the end wall of a park, and the dark, gently mobile silhouette of trees beyond. The room was in darkness and Jordan was at the window, looking out through a crack in the curtains on a street shining dull yellow in electric lamplight. Harry reached out to a wall switch and put on the light, and Jordan hissed, fell into a crouch and whirled to face him. There was a gun in his hand. \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 the Necroscope told him. \u0027It\u0027s just me.\u0027 Jordan drew a deep breath and almost fell into a chair. He waved his hand to indicate Harry should also sit down. \u0027It\u0027s just the way you come and go,\u0027 he said. \u0027You invited me,\u0027 Harry reminded him. Jordan nodded. \u0027Here I am a bag of nerves, looking out into the street - and then the light going on like that!\u0027 Harry said, \u0027It wasn\u0027t deliberate; or rather, it was. If I had spoken you\u0027d have turned and seen me. I\u0027m not sure which would have shocked you more: the light going on suddenly, or seeing my eyes in the dark.\u0027 \u0027Your eyes?\u0027 Harry grimaced, nodding. \u0027They\u0027re red as hell, Trevor. And there\u0027s nothing to stop it now. What\u0027s in me is a strong one.\u0027 \u0027But... you still have a little time?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027I don\u0027t know how long. Long enough to do one last thing, I hope, and then I\u0027ll be on my way.\u0027 He finally sat down. \u0027Now, would you like to put your gun away and tell me what\u0027s on your mind?\u0027 Jordan looked at the gun in his hand as if he\u0027d forgotten it was there. He gave a snort and replaced it in its shoulder holster. \u0027Nervous as a cat,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Or rather, as a mouse watched by a cat!\u0027 \u0027Are you watched?\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t know where to aim his thoughts to check. Searching for Jordan had been different, for he\u0027d known what he was looking for; likewise Paxton. But looking for someone he wasn\u0027t used to -some unknown someone - was a trick he\u0027d yet to master. \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 Jordan got up and put out the light, went to the curtains again. \u0027I\u0027ve never been so sure. He or they are out there right now, not too far away, scanning me. Or if not scanning, obscuring. They\u0027re blocking me. I can\u0027t read past them. I keep thinking it can only be E-Branch, but how the hell would they know I was back? Alive, I mean?\u0027 He looked back from the curtains, saw Harry\u0027s alien face and said, \u0027I ... I see what you mean.\u0027 Harry, a tall, dark silhouette whose eyes made his face a mask from hell, nodded. But there were other things to worry about than the glare of his blood-hued eyes. \u0027What does it feel like, to have someone watching you, blocking your mind?\u0027 \u0027Being watched is how it felt with Paxton; blocking is mental interference. A screen of static.\u0027 \u0027But I wasn\u0027t even sure Paxton was there until you told me. He was just an itch. And as for mental interference...\u0027 \u0027OK.\u0027 The other matched Harry\u0027s shrug. \u0027I\u0027ll give you an example. Try aiming your thoughts right at me.\u0027 Harry did it and met a buzzing wall of interference. If he hadn\u0027t known it was Jordan, then he wouldn\u0027t have known what it was. Jordan said, \u0027Find something like that, and you know someone\u0027s scrambling you. Deliberately. I know because I\u0027ve had practice. When the Russian espers used to cover the Chateau Bronnitsy, it was like this all the time. We used to try and break through, and they were always trying to get through to us.\u0027 He looked at Harry again, penetratingly. \u0027Incidentally, you do it all the time, Harry, except when you\u0027re wanting to read someone, or wanting someone to read you. But with you it\u0027s different. Something that\u0027s permanent and getting stronger all the time. It isn\u0027t static but something else, and it comes natural to you. So natural you didn\u0027t even know about it, did you? Or maybe \"natural\" is the wrong word for it. What you have is ... well, in E-Branch we used to call it mind-smog.\u0027 The Necroscope nodded. \u0027I wondered about that. It\u0027s a dead giveaway. By now Darcy\u0027s espers must know what I am. Or if not he should fire the lot of them! So it looks like the talent Wellesley gave me is going to be redundant ... or maybe not.\u0027 And after a moment\u0027s thought: \u0027No definitely not. Wellesley\u0027s thing is a total blanket: it doesn\u0027t just make my mind unreadable but blanks it out entirely. The vampire thing is just mind-smog, like you said. But it makes me wonder: how come Paxton didn\u0027t discover what was happening to me earlier? How was he able to get to me at all?\u0027 \u0027It was only just starting then,\u0027 Jordan answered. \u0027Your vampire thing wasn\u0027t fully developed. It still isn\u0027t, but sufficiently so that it stopped me. I\u0027ve tried to reach you half a dozen times this last couple of days but was only able to make it when you wanted to contact me. Oh, and something else. You mentioned Darcy Clarke, right? Well -\u0027 Suddenly he paused and held up a cautioning hand. \u0027Wait!\u0027 And in another moment: \u0027Did you feel that?\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027A probe,\u0027 said Jordan. \u0027Someone trying to get in to me. The moment I relax, they\u0027re there.\u0027 Harry stepped toward Jordan and the large, curved windows, but held himself back a little in the shadows. \u0027You said it was on your mind to get out of here. What did you mean?\u0027 \u0027Only that I don\u0027t know what\u0027s on their minds,\u0027 the other told him. \u0027I mean, I know it can only be E-Branch out there, but I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re up to or what they\u0027re planning. Do they know it\u0027s me? That seems unlikely: what, that I\u0027m back from the dead? But on the other hand, and from their point of view, who else can I be if I\u0027m a telepath using Trevor Jordan\u0027s flat? And this watch they\u0027re keeping on me: it reminds me of that time we were covering Yulian Bodescu. I mean, who the hell do they think I am, Harry?\u0027 Very slowly, Harry nodded. T begin to understand,\u0027 he said. And he gripped Jordan\u0027s elbow. \u0027And you\u0027re right: it\u0027s exactly like that time they were covering Yulian Bodescu. Which means that it\u0027s not so much a case of who they think you are but what they think you are!\u0027 Jordan gasped. \u0027You mean they think I\u0027m...?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s possible. You\u0027re back from the dead, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027But I have no mind-smog.\u0027 \u0027Neither did I, until recently.\u0027 Again Jordan\u0027s gasp. \u0027They\u0027re waiting to see how things develop before they move in! Which would explain just about everything. Certainly it would explain why I\u0027m shit-scared of them! I\u0027m picking up something of their suspicions, their intentions. I\u0027m sensing the hunters hot on my track. Harry, they think - they suspect - that I\u0027m a vampire!\u0027 The Necroscope tried to calm him down. \u0027But you\u0027re not, and it\u0027s easy to prove that you\u0027re not. Also, Darcy Clarke\u0027s in charge of E-Branch, and... what were you going to tell me about Darcy, anyway?\u0027 Jordan came away from the window. Another look at Harry\u0027s face convinced him the light would be better on. He tripped the switch on the wall, then sat down heavily. \u0027Darcy\u0027s at home,\u0027 he said, \u0027and very unhappy about something. He was the one I was supposed to be watching, remember? Because he\u0027s the boss and would know which ways things are jumping. But now he seems to have been taken off the job. And while he isn\u0027t a telepath himself, still somebody is throwing up a pretty good shield around him, making it hard to get anything.\u0027 That felt ominous. Harry said, \u0027Maybe we should go and see him. Maybe we should confront him, ask him straight out what\u0027s going on. I\u0027m pretty sure I know already - that the Branch is just waiting for me to put a foot wrong - but if we hear it from Darcy then we\u0027ll know it for sure.\u0027 Jordan shrugged. \u0027At least it would get me out of here. I feel that if I don\u0027t get out, then I\u0027ll go nuts! God, I don\u0027t like being watched and not know what they\u0027re thinking.\u0027 \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And afterwards? Will you come back here or what? The thing is, I could use some help on this serial killer thing. And we can use my place in Bonnyrig as a base. For the time being, anyway. That way we\u0027ll be able to spell each other watching out for the watchers. And when this task I\u0027ve set myself is done, then, before I leave - I mean before I really leave everything - we\u0027ll find a way to square it with E-Branch and put your own record straight.\u0027 That all sounds good to me.\u0027 Jordan breathed a sigh of relief. \u0027Just say the word, Harry, and I\u0027m your man.\u0027 The other nodded. \u0027The word is we go and see Darcy. He\u0027s single, isn\u0027t he, like most of you espers? I know he used to live in Hoddesdon; is he still there? And will he be on his own, or is there a woman? Darcy isn\u0027t likely to buckle under a shock or two, I\u0027m sure, but I don\u0027t want to go scaring any women.\u0027 Jordan shook his head. \u0027No woman that I know of. Darcy\u0027s been married to the job too long. But he\u0027s not in Hoddesdon any more. He got himself a house in Crouch End, just a mile or two away. A nice place with a garden in Haslemere Road. Only been there a couple of weeks. He moved in right after the Greek job.\u0027 Again Harry\u0027s nod. \u0027I don\u0027t know the area but you can show it to me. Is there anything you want to take with you?\u0027 \u0027My suitcase is already packed.\u0027 Then we can go right now.\u0027 \u0027At 4:20 in the morning? If you say so. I don\u0027t have a car, though, so we either walk it or I\u0027ll need to call a - \u0027 But Jordan knew his mistake at once, as soon as he saw Harry\u0027s strange wan smile. \u0027A taxi\u0027s not necessary,\u0027 the Necroscope told him. \u0027I have my own transport...\u0027 Darcy Clarke was still up, pacing the floor as he\u0027d paced it all night. It wasn\u0027t his talent that was bothering him - he himself wasn\u0027t in any danger - he was just worried about the Branch and the job he suspected was being planned right now, at this very moment. About that, and about Harry Keogh. But in fact the two were one and the same thing. The ground-floor lights of Clarke\u0027s house were bright behind a facade of shrubs and trees as Harry guided Jordan out through a M\u0026ouml;bius exit and back into the real world. \u0027You can open your eyes now,\u0027 he told the telepath as Jordan staggered under the briefly suspended, now renewed, pull of gravity. It was like the feeling in the pit of your stomach when an elevator descends to the level you want and jerks to a halt there, except this elevator had no walls, floor or ceiling and you \u0027fell\u0027 in every direction at once. Which was why Harry had asked Jordan to close his eyes a moment. \u0027My God!\u0027 Jordan whispered, swaying a little as he looked all around at the night street. Harry thought: God? The M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum? Well, and you could be right. August Ferdinand thinks so, anyway! He steadied the telepath and said, \u0027I know. It\u0027s a weird sensation, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Jordan looked at Harry and felt himself in awe of him. He talked about the immundane, the utterly unbelievable, as if it were merely odd. But finally Jordan gathered his senses to say, \u0027Nice shot, Harry. That\u0027s Darcy\u0027s place right there.\u0027 They let themselves in through the garden gate and walked up a path between the shrubs. The glowing white globe of a lamp drew a cloud of moths where it hung like a small moon over the front door. Harry directed Jordan to stand to one side, put on his dark glasses and pushed the doorbell; in a little while footsteps sounded from within. The door was equipped with a peephole lens; Clarke used it and saw Harry standing on his doorstep, staring right at him. His talent made no objection as he opened the door, which told him a lot. \u0027Harry!\u0027 he said. \u0027Come in, come in!\u0027 \u0027Darcy,\u0027 Harry said, taking hold of his arm, \u0027listen, take it easy - but there\u0027s someone with me.\u0027 \u0027Someone with - ?\u0027 Darcy started to say as Jordan stepped into view. He saw him and said, \u0027Trevor...?\u0027 Then he started violently and took a pace to the rear. Harry, following him in, said: \u0027It\u0027s OK, it\u0027s OK!\u0027 \u0027Trevor!\u0027 Clarke breathed, his eyes bulging in his suddenly pale face. \u0027Trevor Jordan! Oh, my God! Oh, sweet Jesus!\u0027 Harry wished people wouldn\u0027t keep using these Names of Power so casually, but on this occasion he understood and made nothing of it. Trevor Jordan pushed past Harry and took Clarke\u0027s other arm; Clarke at once strained back and away from both of them. But again it was a \u0027normal\u0027 reaction, nothing to do with his talent. Jordan said, \u0027Darcy, it really is me. And I\u0027m OK.\u0027 \u0027OK?\u0027 Clarke\u0027s mouth open and closed and the word came out like a croak. He tried again. \u0027Really you? Yes, I can see that. But I know you\u0027re dead. I was with you in that Rhodes hospital, remember, when you put a bullet in your brain!\u0027 Harry said, \u0027Can we go inside, sit down, talk?\u0027 Talk?\u0027 Clarke looked at him - at both of them - as if they were mad, or as if he was. But then he nodded. \u0027Sure, why not? And then I might wake up!\u0027 In the living room Clarke pointed to chairs, poured drinks like a robot, actually apologized for the untidiness and said he wasn\u0027t quite settled in yet. And then he very carefully sat down and tossed back his large whisky in one... and at once sprang to his feet again and said, \u0027So for fuck\u0027s sake, talk! Convince me that I haven\u0027t cracked!\u0027 Harry calmed him down and very quickly explained everything - or almost everything - but without going into the fine details. And when he was through: \u0027So we\u0027ve come to see you to find out what\u0027s going on, what it is that you and E-Branch are up to. Actually I\u0027m pretty sure I already know. So I\u0027m counting on you to keep them off my back until I get done with what I\u0027m pledged to do.\u0027 Finally Clarke closed his mouth and turned to stare hard at Jordan. Jordan, yes - looking exactly as Clarke had always known him - but still he took the other\u0027s hand and squeezed it, and stared even harder just to be one hundred per cent sure. But in the end there was no way round it; this could only be Trevor Jordan. The telepath suffered Clarke\u0027s astonished scrutiny and made no complaint as this old friend of so many years\u0027 standing checked him out, checked every well-remembered line of his face and form. Jordan\u0027s face was fresh, oval and open, and with his fair, thinning hair falling forward over grey eyes, it would normally look boyish; except that now it was lined with worry and not a little astonishment of his own. His feelings were reflected in the line of his mouth: naturally crooked, it would tighten and straighten out if something was wrong. Which was how it looked now, straight and tight. Well, and Clarke could well understand that. And Clarke thought: Good old easy-going Trevor! Transparent as a window, readable as an open book. Such has always been your guise, anyway. As if you\u0027d like people to be able to read you as easily as you read them, like you were trying to compensate for your metaphysical talent, or even apologize for it. Trevor Jordan: sensitive but always determined, I never met the man who didn\u0027t like you. And if there was such a one, why, you\u0027d simply avoid him. And if you really are you, you\u0027ll know exactly what I\u0027m thinking. Jordan grinned and said, \u0027You missed out the handsome, rangy-limbed, athletic bit! But what\u0027s this about \"boyish\"? Are you calling me a big kid, Darcy?\u0027 Clarke sat back in his chair and touched his feverish brow with a trembling hand. He didn\u0027t know which one of them to look at, Harry Keogh or Trevor Jordan. Finally he said, \u0027What can I say? Except... welcome back, Trevor!\u0027 After more drinks, it was Darcy\u0027s turn. He told them what he knew, which wasn\u0027t much, and finished up: \u0027So Paxton must have reported how I sent you the files on those girls, Harry, which was sufficient to get me suspended. As for them coming after you: you know how the Branch works almost as well as I do. Of course they\u0027ll be coming after you, sooner or later.\u0027 Trevor said, \u0027And me?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Darcy told him, \u0027because tomorrow first thing, I\u0027ll go into town and put them in the picture. I could \u0027phone the Minister Responsible right now, but at this hour he wouldn\u0027t thank me for that. So I\u0027ll go in and speak to everyone who is anyone in E-Branch, and make sure they fully understand what\u0027s going on. It might do the trick and get them off Harry\u0027s back for a while.\u0027 \u0027I hope it gets them off my back,\u0027 said the Necroscope, unemotionally. \u0027I really do.\u0027 And he took off his dark-lensed glasses and asked Darcy to dim the lights. When E-Branch\u0027s suspended boss saw Harry\u0027s face in the darkened room, he quietly said, \u0027Harry, I hope so too ... for their sake, every last one of them!\u0027 Harry supposed that Darcy was genuine, supposed he was one of only a very few men in the entire world whom he could trust; but the Necroscope\u0027s vampire weirdness was strong in him now, and looking at Darcy Clarke he saw a man who was half-friend and half-enemy. Harry couldn\u0027t read the future, not with any certainty - and in any case he knew that prognostication was a dangerous game, fraught with paradoxes - but he could make a damn good guess at what was coming. If he had to stay here in this world longer than he\u0027d planned, if this task he\u0027d set himself took longer than just a few more days, then it could well be that Darcy would be obliged to join the other team. Darcy was an expert, and as Harry\u0027s metamorphosis progressed the Branch would need all the expert help it could get. Eventually, one way or another, even Darcy would turn against him. He\u0027d have no choice: sooner or later the plague carrier would have to be destroyed. It was as simple as that. \u0027Darcy,\u0027 Harry said, as he turned the lights up again, \u0027if we ever did come up against one another, why, you\u0027d be just about the only one who could stop me! For which reason I\u0027m half afraid of you. You know I\u0027m a telepath now? Well, I am. And I wonder: would it bother you if I took a closer look into your mind?\u0027 Darcy\u0027s talent sensed no danger. Of course not, for Harry intended him no harm. What he did intend was to take out a sort of insurance policy, one which could be cancelled later, when the danger was past. No harm at all to Darcy Clarke the man, only to his talent itself. For that was what the Necroscope feared: to come up against Clarke knowing he couldn\u0027t win, that the deflector\u0027s guardian angel would protect him. But with his talent taken away from him, Clarke would be impotent. At least for what remained of Harry\u0027s term here. Afterwards... he would give it back to him. \u0027Look into my mind?\u0027 Darcy repeated him. \u0027With your permission,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027But it has to be of your own free will.\u0027 Darcy read nothing into the Necroscope\u0027s words. \u0027But can\u0027t you read my mind, just like Trevor here?\u0027 This is different,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027For this you need to invite me in, as if your mind was a door which you were opening for me.\u0027 \u0027Anything you say.\u0027 Darcy shrugged; and his eyes met the other\u0027s and locked on them, and in another moment Harry was into his mind. The mechanism Harry sought wasn\u0027t difficult to find, and he saw at once that it was a freak, a mutation. It was Clarke\u0027s unique talent, which all of his life had protected him from external dangers but was impotent to save itself from the internal danger which was Harry Keogh. And even if it could save itself it did nothing, because Harry meant no harm. There was no trigger Harry could jam, so he simply wrapped the entire mechanism in a fragment of Wellesley\u0027s blanket. The job took as long as it takes to tell and then he was out again. And he was satisfied that Clarke\u0027s guardian angel had been gagged, for the time being at least. \u0027Is that it?\u0027 Darcy frowned. \u0027Are you satisfied I\u0027ll do you no harm?\u0027 Absolutely, Harry said to himself, while outwardly he merely nodded. Because if you try you\u0027ll have no protection, which means I\u0027ll at least be able to protect myself. And then he heard another voice in his head, Jordan\u0027s saying: Which means he\u0027s no longer protected from anything. Won\u0027t you at least tell him what you\u0027ve done? No, Harry answered. You know Darcy: he\u0027d become paranoid about his safety in a moment. That was always his paradox, that despite this weird talent of his, still he looked after himself like he was accident-prone or something. I hope he\u0027ll be all right, that\u0027s all, said the other. \u0027Well?\u0027 Darcy prompted Harry. \u0027I\u0027m satisfied you won\u0027t go against me,\u0027 the Necroscope told him. \u0027And now we have to be on our way.\u0027 Jordan said, \u0027It strikes me as likely that the Branch will know we\u0027ve been here. If you want to stay on their good side, Darcy, you might like to call the Duty Officer and confirm it. Let them see that you\u0027re not in collusion with us. And at the same time you might use your good offices to clear me.\u0027 Darcy pulled a wry face. \u0027Actually, my \"offices\" aren\u0027t looking any too hot right now,\u0027 he said. \u0027But certainly I\u0027ll give it a try.\u0027 He looked at Harry. \u0027So where are you two off to now? Or shouldn\u0027t I ask?\u0027 \u0027You shouldn\u0027t ask - \u0027 Harry answered. \u0027 - but I\u0027ll tell you anyway: we\u0027re tracking your serial killer. I sort of got hooked up on it. That\u0027s the job I want finished before I move on.\u0027 Darcy nodded. \u0027That way you\u0027ll leave a clean sheet behind you, Harry, which is the way it should be. You\u0027ll always be the right sort of legend: famous instead of infamous.\u0027 Harry said nothing. Fame, even infamy, didn\u0027t concern him. All that mattered was his obsession. What was more, he knew why it had become an obsession. He was being chased off his territory, forced to vacate his very own world, which he had fought for. Not physically driven out - not yet, anyway - but soon. And the vampire, especially one of the Wamphyri, is tenacious and territorial. Frustrated almost beyond endurance, Harry was fighting back. But if he must take it out on someone, then at least let that someone be a fiend in his own right. Namely, the serial killer, the necromancer, the torturer of Penny and those other poor innocents. Even Pamela Trotter, innocent, yes. Compared to him, anyway. It was time Harry and Trevor Jordan were on their way. They said the usual farewells, very simply, and Harry told Jordan to close his eyes again. Darcy Clarke watched them go and when they were no longer there held out his trembling hand into the space where they\u0027d passed through a M\u0026ouml;bius door into nothing. And that was all he found there.
