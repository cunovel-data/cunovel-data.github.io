{"id":62524,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The Ferenc\u0027s Story\n Shaithis slept long and long.\n The bats kept him warm (at least kept him from freezing solid in his ice-niche); his wounds healed; his thoughts, like Shaithis himself, remained hidden. Until it was time to rouse himself and be up and about. Which was when his hiding place was discovered.\n What!? Who!? The astonished, involuntary mental exclamations brought Shaithis starting awake, echoing in his mind. While still the echoes rang he was on his feet, his blanket of albino bats breaking up in chittering disarray, whirring away from him like a shock of sentient snow. Another moment and his hand filled his gauntlet; he let his Wamphyri senses reach out - but cautiously, tentatively - to discover who was there. Whoever, he must be near, else he wouldn\u0027t have sensed Shaithis\u0027s emergence.\n While sleeping, Shaithis\u0027s thoughts had flowed inwards, an art in which he was adept; his dreams could not be \u0027heard\u0027 by any other. But during the transition from deep, healing sleep to waking they had escaped like a yawn, and someone had been close enough to hear it. Too close by far.\n Shaithis allowed his mental probe to touch that of the other, and immediately snatched it back. Contact had been brief but recognition mutual: insufficient to detail specific identities, but enough that each creature was certain of the other\u0027s presence. Shaithis glanced this way and that. There was only one way out of his niche; if he was trapped then he was trapped; so be it.\n Who is it? he sniffed the cold air with his bat\u0027s snout. Is it you, Fess, come for your supper? Or must I soil my good gauntlet in pus to tear out the loathsome heart of the odious Volse Pinescu?\n And back came the answer, like an astonished gasp in the vampire\u0027s mind: Hah! Shaithis! You survived The Dweller\u0027s death-beams, then?\n Arkis Leperson! Shaithis knew him at once. He breathed his relief, watched curiously for a moment while his breath fell as snow, then made for the exit. Along the way he flexed his muscles, swung his limbs, inhaled deeply and tested his ribs. All seemed in order. Pah! What had those minor dents and scratches been for wounds anyway? Repairs had been minimal; his vampire flesh had scarcely been overtaxed; he was left with an ache here, a bruise there.\n Arkis stood close to the foot of the ice-staircase. He was squat for a Lord of the Wamphyri: scarcely more than six feet tall - ah, but a good three feet broad, too! A massive barrel of a man, his strength had been prodigious. Now: it seemed he\u0027d lost a little weight. Shaithis moved towards him, closing the distance between with the easy, flowing glide of the vampire; sinister to ordinary men, but normal by Wamphyri standards. In another moment they were face to face.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Shaithis, \u0027and is it peace? Or are you too hungry to think straight? I\u0027ll be frank: I could use a friend. And by the look of you... huh! Our circumstances are much the same. The choice is yours, but I know where there\u0027s food!\u0027\n The other\u0027s entirely instinctive reaction was a single belched word: \u0027Food?\u0027 His eyes opened wide and his flaring, convoluted snout plumed ice-crystal breath.\n Plainly Arkis was starving. Shaithis offered him a grim smile, took from his pouch the last piece of cold bear-heart and devoured half in a single bite, then tossed the rest to the leper\u0027s son - who snatched it from the air with a cry almost of pain. And without pause he crammed his mouth full.\n Arkis had been sired by Morgis Griefcry out of a Traveller waif. She\u0027d been a leper and her infection had taken Morgis in his member which (along with his lips, eyes and ears) had been among the first of his parts to slough. The disease had been like a fire in him, burning him faster than his vampire could replenish. Finally, with cries of grief echoing his name to the full, Morgis had taken a firebrand and hurled himself and his Traveller odalisque into a refuse pit whose accumulation of methane gas had done the rest. His suicide had left Arkis the youthful Lord and heir to a fine aerie. Even better, Arkis had not contracted his forebears\u0027 disease! Not yet, anyway. Perhaps he never would. It had all been many sundowns agone.\n While Arkis ate, Shaithis studied him.\n Squat in the body, Arkis\u0027s skull was likewise squat, as if it had been crushed down a little. His face seemed pushed out in front, and his bottom jaw farther yet, with boar\u0027s teeth curving upward over his fleshy upper lip. And yet the overall effect wasn\u0027t so much swinish as wolfish, especially with the inordinate length of his furred, tapering ears. Aye, somewhere in his lineage there\u0027d been a grey one for sure. Moreover, he was lean as a wolf; well, by the standards of former times, at least. Now, eyes ablaze with the lust of feeding, upon however small a morsel, he nevertheless narrowed them to gaze on Shaithis. And when he was done: Til grant you it was a bite,\u0027 he grunted, \u0027but was that the food you promised?\u0027\n \u0027I made no promises,\u0027 Shaithis answered. \u0027I stated a fact: I know where there\u0027s food - by the ton!\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 the other grunted, and cocked his head on one side. \u0027Volse\u0027s flyer, d\u0027you mean? Ah, but they guard it well, Volse and the Ferenc. It\u0027s a mousetrap, Shaithis; only approach their private pantry too closely and you\u0027ll end up in it! No chivalry here, my friend. Cold, crystallized meat can never taste as good as red juice of meat spurting from a severed artery! But... beggars can\u0027t be choosers. I have tried and failed; they\u0027re never too far away; I know they lust after my blood.\u0027\n \u0027Are you reduced to this?\u0027 Shaithis raised a black, spiky eyebrow. \u0027Scavenging after each other?\u0027 He knew of course that they were; knew that he would be, too, soon enough. The \u0027chivalry\u0027 of the Wamphyri was at best a myth. But in any case, his insult - the word \u0027scavenging\u0027 - was lost on Arkis Leperson.\n \u0027Shaithis,\u0027 said the other, \u0027I\u0027ve been here four, going on five sundowns; five auroral displays, anyway, which I reckon amounts to much the same thing. Reduced to hunting each other? Let me tell you that if it moves I\u0027ll hunt it! I had bats by the handful at first: squeezed \u0027em to pulp so they\u0027d drip into my mouth - then ate the pulp, too! - but now they won\u0027t come anywhere near me. They have minds of their own, these tiny albinos. Right now, I\u0027m on my way to see the shrivelled old granddad frozen in the ice up top. I\u0027d have tried to get at him before, if I was desperate enough - which now I am! So don\u0027t talk to me about being reduced to this or that. We\u0027re all reduced, Shaithis, and you no less than anyone else!\u0027\n So maybe Shaithis\u0027s insult had got through after all. That came as something of a surprise; the leper\u0027s son had always seemed such a dullard. Perhaps the cold had sharpened his wits.\n \u0027Arkis,\u0027 Shaithis said, \u0027there are two of us now and we\u0027ve shared food. That\u0027s good, for it strikes me we\u0027ll do better as a team. While you\u0027ve been here you\u0027ve learned things and must know many of the pitfalls. Such knowledge has value. Also, the disgusting Volse Pinescu and gigantic Fess Ferenc will think twice before coming on the two of us together. Now, what say we leave this echoing shell of ice and find our breakfast?\u0027\n The leper\u0027s son sighed his impatience, which angered Shaithis a little: he wasn\u0027t used to dull, squat creatures playing the equal with him. \u0027Now let me repeat myself,\u0027 Arkis grunted. \u0027They guard Volse\u0027s flyer, and guard it well! They\u0027re likewise well-fuelled, which we\u0027re not. And as you yourself have just this minute pointed out, the Ferenc\u0027s a bloody giant!\u0027\n Shaithis flared his nostrils and for a moment thought to leave the fool to his own devices. Except that would also mean leaving him to the tender mercies of the others -eventually. And Shaithis wanted Arkis for himself -eventually. But these were thoughts he steered inwards, lest Arkis hear them. \u0027And can they guard two beasts?\u0027 he said. \u0027And did you think I\u0027d walked here, Arkis Dire-death?\u0027 (the idiot\u0027s other name).\n It stopped Arkis dead. \u0027Eh? Another flyer? I haven\u0027t seen it. But then, I\u0027ve not dared venture too far out on the ice lest they see me! Where then, this flyer?\u0027\n \u0027Where I sent it,\u0027 said Shaithis. \u0027Still good and fresh and... wait a moment - \u0027 He sent out a beast-oriented thought: Do you hear me? - and in return sensed life flickering still, but burning very low. \u0027Aye, and not yet bled to death. Not quite.\u0027\n \u0027They know it\u0027s there, that great vat of filth and the Ferenc?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, else I\u0027d not require assistance from you.\u0027\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Arkis cried. \u0027I might have known it! Something for nothing? What? Think again, Arkis my lad. This is the Grand Lord Shaithis you\u0027re talking to. Oh, let\u0027s be friends, Arkis - because I\u0027ve need of you!\u0027\n \u0027So be it.\u0027 Shaithis shrugged. \u0027I merely envisaged a joint venture which would furnish joint returns, that\u0027s all. Equal shares. But something for nothing? What, and did you think this was Sunside at sundown, with plenty of sweet Traveller game afoot?\u0027 He made as if to turn away. \u0027Starve, then.\u0027\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 The other took a pace closer. And in a more reasonable tone: \u0027What\u0027s your plan?\u0027\n \u0027None,\u0027 said Shaithis, \u0027except to eat.\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\n Shaithis\u0027s turn to sigh. \u0027Listen, and I\u0027ll ask you again: can they guard two flyers, Volse and the Ferenc?\u0027\n \u0027Certainly - a man to each.\u0027\n \u0027But we are two men!\u0027\n \u0027And if they\u0027re both together?\u0027\n \u0027Then one beast goes unguarded! Has the cold numbed your once agile brain, Arkis?\u0027 (That last was a lie, but a little flattery wouldn\u0027t hurt.)\n \u0027Hmm!\u0027 The leper\u0027s son thought about it for a moment, then scowled and stabbed a finger at Shaithis. \u0027Very well - but if we come upon Volse Pinescu on his own, we kill him. And I want his heart! Is it a deal?\u0027\n \u0027Agreed,\u0027 said Shaithis. \u0027Actually, I should think it\u0027s the only part worth eating.\u0027\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Arkis snorted. And: \u0027Har, har! Oh, ha - ha -haaa.r he laughed, in his way.\n And: Go on, laugh, Shaithis kept his thoughts hidden. But when Volse and Fess are done for, you\u0027re next, bone-brain! And out loud: \u0027Now guard your thoughts. We go out onto the ice...\u0027\n Volse Pinescu\u0027s flyer was rimed with frost, stiff as a board.\n Still Arkis Leperson would have set to, but Shaithis\n cautioned him: \u0027Let\u0027s not waste valuable time here. What?\n Why, you\u0027d wear those tusks of yours to stumps on this!\u0027 Arkis turned to him with a scowl. \u0027It\u0027s food, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Aye.\u0027 Shaithis nodded. \u0027And half a mile over there a lot more of it - but thick, red and flowing in juicy pipes. Good beasts I breed, Arkis, of the finest flesh. Now listen: do you sense our enemies? No? Neither do I. So today they\u0027re not doing much guarding, right?\u0027\n Arkis sniffed the icy air. \u0027It worries me. What are they up to, d\u0027you suppose?\u0027\n Time for supposing after we\u0027ve filled our bellies.\u0027 Shaithis had already set off across the blue foxfire ice. And Arkis came shambling after. Shaithis glanced back once and nodded, then faced forward and grinned his sly grin as of old. Ever the leader, Shaithis, and how easy once more to take up the mantle. And behind him Arkis Leperson, like a dog to heel...\n A wind came up.\n While Shaithis and Arkis Leperson, called Diredeath, sat in a cave carved by Volse and Fess in the underbelly of Shaithis\u0027s flyer and sipped the feebly pulsing juices of that now insensate beast, the radiant stars were blotted out by dark, scudding clouds. Snow came down in a shortlived blizzard, which loaned the ice a thin, soft coating.\n When the wind died down again the cannibalized flyer was dead and its arteries already stiffening. \u0027Cold fare from this time forward,\u0027 commented Shaithis, sticking up his head to spy out the land around. He looked towards the spine of volcanic peaks. Then looked again. And frowned his concern.\n \u0027Arkis, what do you make of this?\u0027\n Arkis stood up, belched noisomely, looked where Shaithis pointed. \u0027Eh? That? A whirlwind, a snow-devil, the last flurry in the wake of the storm. What\u0027s this great fascination with Nature, Shaithis?\u0027\n \u0027Fascination? With what\u0027s natural, none whatsoever. With what\u0027s unnatural, plenty! Especially in a place like this.\u0027\n \u0027Unnatural?\u0027\n \u0027By Nature\u0027s mundane standards, aye, if not by those of the Wamphyri.\u0027 He continued to study the phenomenon: a whirling cloud of snow forming a squat cylinder twenty feet high and the same in diameter. Something seemed to move in its heart, like a tadpole in a jelly egg, and the whole - device? - making a beeline their way. It threw off whips of snow which quickly settled to the ground without diminishing the central mass.\n Shaithis nodded; he knew what it was; \u0027Fess Ferenc,\u0027 he whispered, grimly.\n \u0027What, Fess?\u0027 Arkis gaped at the thing, now only a hundred yards away across the shining ice, coming at walking pace and beginning to thin out a little. \u0027How, Fess?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a vampire mist,\u0027 said Shaithis, donning his gauntlet. \u0027On Starside it would creep, flow, drift outwards from him. Here it turns to snow! Fess was a fine mist-maker ... his great mass. During the hunt, I\u0027ve seen him cover an entire hillside.\u0027\n They both threw out their vampire senses towards the weird, earthbound cloud. Only one creature inside it; the Ferenc, aye, but weary as never before. He hadn\u0027t the strength to hide himself. \u0027Ah-hahr growled Arkis. \u0027We have him!\u0027\n \u0027But let\u0027s first discover what goes on,\u0027 Shaithis cautioned him.\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious what goes on?\u0027 The Leper\u0027s son was scowling again. \u0027Why, he\u0027s finally burst that monstrous boil Volse Pinescu, but in the fight depleted himself. So now he\u0027s at our mercy, of which I have precious little.\u0027\n Twenty paces away the cloud fell as a final flurry and Fess stood there, naked! Entirely naked, and not only of his snow-cloud cover. Arkis gawped but Shaithis called out: \u0027Well, Fess, and how fortunes change, eh?\u0027\n \u0027It would seem so.\u0027 The other\u0027s deep bass voice echoed over the ice-plain. But there was a shiver in it; he was freezing. And yet under one arm he carried his clothes in a bundle. Shaithis couldn\u0027t see the sense of it. There must be a story here and he wanted to know it.\n Arkis sensed Shaithis\u0027s curiosity. \u0027Me, I\u0027m not interested,\u0027 he snarled. \u0027I say we kill him now!\u0027\n \u0027You say too much,\u0027 Shaithis hissed. \u0027You think only of your own survival, now, without a thought for the future. Myself, I think of my continued survival, now and however long I may sustain it. So you bide your time or our partnership ends here.\u0027\n \u0027Am I to die?\u0027 The Ferenc stood tall, glooming on Shaithis across that short distance. \u0027If so then get it over with, for I\u0027ve no wish to turn to a block of ice.\u0027 But he threw down his clothes and hunched forward a little, and his talons were sharp as razors hanging at his sides.\n \u0027It seems I have the advantage,\u0027 said Shaithis. \u0027Also a score to settle. You caused me not a little pain.\u0027 The Ferenc made no answer. \u0027However,\u0027 Shaithis continued, \u0027we may yet come to an agreement. As you see, Arkis and I have formed a team of our own: safety in numbers, you know? But two against the Icelands? The odds are too high. Three of us might fare better.\u0027\n \u0027Some kind of trick?\u0027 Fess couldn\u0027t believe it. If their roles had been reversed Shaithis would have been already dead.\n \u0027No trick.\u0027 Shaithis shook his head. \u0027Like Diredeath here you have knowledge of this place. And just as the blood is the life, so is knowledge. That has always been my conviction. To fight among ourselves is to die. Sharing knowledge - pooling our resources - we might yet survive.\u0027\n \u0027Say on,\u0027 said Fess, his voice more shivery than ever.\n \u0027Nothing more to say.\u0027 Shaithis shook his head. \u0027Come out of the cold and replenish yourself, and tell us what\u0027s happened that you go naked as a babe in such a place, hidden in a weird and very unsubtle mist. Aye, and then perhaps you\u0027d advise us on the whereabouts of the unlovely Volse Pinescu, your erstwhile companion.\u0027\n The Ferenc had no choice. Flee and they would catch him, for they were well fuelled. Stand still and freeze, and they\u0027d thaw him out and eat him. Go forward and talk, and... perhaps he could yet make his peace with Shaithis. As for Arkis, that one was something else.\n He came on, got down in the lee of the stiffening flyer, tore a vein from the wall of flesh and bit through it. Nothing was forthcoming (the creature\u0027s blood was finished or frozen in the outer regions of its bulk) so he merely stripped the pipe down with his teeth and swallowed the pulp. It was sustenance if nothing else. Between mouthfuls he commented, \u0027Perhaps we should have stayed on Starside. At least The Dweller would have made a quick end of it.\u0027\n \u0027Still blaming me, Fess?\u0027 Shaithis stood over him, watched him fuelling himself. Arkis sat well away, scowling as usual.\n \u0027I blame all of us,\u0027 the Ferenc answered, perhaps bitterly. \u0027Hotheads, we rushed in like blind men over a precipice. Fools, we went to murder and instead committed suicide. It was your plan, aye, but we all fell in with it.\u0027 He stood up and went back on to the ice to his garments, there crouching and cleaning them thoroughly with snow. At least there was that to be said for the giant: he\u0027d always been scrupulous. When he was done he returned again to the cave of cooling flesh and lay his clothes aside to dry or freeze out.\n \u0027Some strange contamination?\u0027 Shaithis wondered out loud.\n \u0027You could say that.\u0027 The other wrinkled his already much convoluted snout. Those stinking stains were Volse!\u0027 And as he continued to eat, so, between mouthfuls, he told them about it.\n \u0027Volse and I, we\u0027d noticed smoke from the central cone. Also some strange activity now and then in a high cave. And we thought: if that old mountain contains heat and fire, it\u0027s only reasonable that someone\u0027s settled there. But who? Common men? Exiled Wamphyri, perhaps? No way to discover, unless we went to see. Oh, we cast our probes ahead of us, of course, but who- or whatever lived in the volcano, he kept his thoughts to himself.\n \u0027The way is longer than it looks: maybe five miles to the foot of the mount, then a rising climb of two more to its cone. But near the top where the way gets steep, there was this cave. And that was where we\u0027d seen signs of activity, like mirrors glinting in the starlight. Dwellers, we\u0027d thought. Snow-trogs or the like. Meat, anyway.\n \u0027Aye, there was meat, all right,\u0027 (the Ferenc\u0027s aspect was suddenly grim). \u0027A ton of it! But best if I tell it as it happened and not go ahead of myself...\n \u0027So we arrived at the mouth of this cave, all craggy and yellow with sulphur: an old lava-run, I fancied. But hardly fit habitation, and no jot warmer than any other place around here. We cast our probes ahead of us; there was life in there, some dull intelligence far back in the cave; we hardly felt threatened. And it seemed likely the bore hole passed right through the mountain all the way to the core. And if that\u0027s where the warmth was, that\u0027s where we\u0027d find the life.\n \u0027So we went in. The tunnel had its twists and turns, and it was dark and smelly as a refuse pit in there. But what is darkness to the Wamphyri?\n \u0027Volse, who had fashioned the most incredible pustules to enhance his already hideous appearance, took the lead. He\u0027d stripped off his jacket and his upper body was entirely festooned with all manner of morbid things. \"Who- or whatever,\" he said, \"only let them see me or feel me near, and they\u0027ll know there\u0027s nothing for it but to faint and hope it\u0027s a bad dream!\" I thought he was probably correct and had no objection to his going first.\n \u0027Then... Ah - I\u0027 Fess gave a small start as he spied a miniature albino bat hovering near, under the overhang of the dead flyer\u0027s side. In a lightning swipe he scythed it in two parts in mid-air. And: \u0027Ah, yes!\u0027 he said. \u0027And perhaps I should mention: Volse and I, we had companions all along the way. These damned bats! They get everywhere.\u0027\n \u0027Why treat them so harshly?\u0027 Shaithis cut in. \u0027On Starside they were our small familiars.\u0027\n \u0027These aren\u0027t the same.\u0027 Fess shook his great head. \u0027They lack obedience.\u0027\n Shaithis frowned. They\u0027d obeyed him - hadn\u0027t they?\n Arkis growled: \u0027Never mind the bats but finish your story. It interests me.\u0027\n Partially replenished, invigorated from his feeding, the Ferenc began to don his clothes, generating body heat to complete the job of drying them out. He was adept at this as he was at mist-making. And while he dressed so he continued with his story: \u0027Volse went first, then, into the heart of the riddled rock; and I\u0027ll be honest, we thought there was nothing there. Nothing to alarm or threaten us, anyway. And yet I sensed that the picture we had of that place, of its suspected dweller or dwellers, was probably a false one. It seemed to me that my mind was watched, even though I\u0027d failed to detect the watcher. But the deeper we proceeded into the mountain, the more the conviction grew in me that our progress was monitored, even minutely; as if each step led us closer to some terrific confrontation, some contrived and monstrous conclusion. In short, an ambush!\u0027\n Arkis grunted and nodded his head. \u0027The very way I felt,\u0027 he remarked, in a low, dark mutter, \u0027on those several occasions when I\u0027d approach Volse\u0027s flyer for a bite to eat.\u0027\n \u0027Just so.\u0027 Fess nodded, without taking offence, and perhaps deliberately failing to find anything of accusation in Arkis\u0027s statement. \u0027And I knew... fear? Well no, not fear, for we\u0027re none of us bred that way. Shall we simply say then that I experienced a new sensation, which was not pleasant? Nor was this presentiment without foundation, as will be seen. And all the while those damned albinos tracking our course, until their fluttering and chittering had grown to be such an annoyance that I stayed back a little to strike out at them where they swooped overhead. Which probably saved my life.\n \u0027Ahead of me, Volse had gone striding on. But he sensed it coming in the same instant that I sensed it, and he said one word before it struck. The word he said was: \"What?\" Yes, he questioned it, and even questioning it never knew what hit him.\u0027\n \u0027Explain!\u0027 Arkis was breathless. And Shaithis was intent, rapt upon the Ferenc\u0027s story.\n Fess shrugged. Fully dressed again, he sliced gobbets of flesh from the flyer\u0027s alveolate ribs, sliding them one by one down his throat. \u0027Hard to explain,\u0027 he said, after a while. \u0027Fast, it was. Huge. Mindless. Terrible! But I saw what it did to Volse, and I determined that it would not do the same to me. I never fled from anything in my life before - well, except The Dweller and the awesome destruction he wrought in the battle for his garden - but I fled from this.\n \u0027It was white, but not a healthy white. The white of hiding in places too dark, like some cavern fungus. It had legs - a great many, I think - with clawed, webbed feet. Its body was fishlike, its head too, with jaws ferocious! But the weapon it bore - \u0027\n \u0027A weapon?\u0027 Arkis thrust his face forward. \u0027But you said the thing was mindless. And now... mind enough to carry a weapon?\u0027\n The Ferenc glanced at him scornfully, then held up his own talon hands. \u0027And are these not weapons? This thing\u0027s weapon was part of it, fool, just as your own boar\u0027s tusks are part of you!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, understood,\u0027 said Shaithis impatiently. \u0027Say on.\u0027\n Fess settled down again, but his eyes were uneasy, wide in his massive, malformed face. \u0027Its weapon was a knife, a sword, a lance. But with tines like thorns all down its length, from tip to snout. A barbed rod for stabbing, and once stabbed the victim\u0027s hooked, with no way to free himself except tear his own flesh wide open! And at the tip of that bone-plated ram, twin holes like nostrils. But not for breathing...\u0027He paused.\n \u0027... For what, then?\u0027 Volse could not contain himself.\n \u0027For sucking!\u0027 said the Ferenc.\n \u0027A vampire thing.\u0027 Shaithis seemed convinced. \u0027A warrior, but uncontrolled, with no rightful master. A creature created by some exiled Wamphyri Lord, which has outlasted its maker.\u0027 He said these things, but he did not necessarily believe them. No, he uttered them aloud to cover the nature of his true thoughts, which were different again.\n Fess fell for Shaithis\u0027s ploy, anyway. \u0027These are possibilities, aye.\u0027 The giant nodded. \u0027Stealthy - sly as a fox, and all unheralded - it crept out from a side tunnel; but when it struck - ah! - lightning moves more slowly. It slid into view and its spear stabbed at Volse three times. The first blow ripped him open through boils and all, and spattered me and the walls of the tunnel with all of his pus, whose amount was prodigious. He was like one huge blister, bursting and wetting everything with his vile liquids. I was drenched. The second thrust hit him while he was still reeling from the first; it almost sawed his head off. And the third: that sank into him - into his heart -where it commenced to suck like a great pump! And while the thing held him upright, impaled on its weapon against the wall, sucking at him, so the creature\u0027s saucer eyes fixed me in their monstrous glare. So that I knew I was next.\n \u0027That was when I fled.\u0027 (And Fess actually shuddered, which amazed Shaithis.)\n \u0027You couldn\u0027t have saved him?\u0027 Arkis sneered, questioning Fess\u0027s manhood; a dangerous line of inquiry at best.\n But the other took it well. \u0027I tell you Volse was a goner! What? And so much of his liquids used up, his head half shorn away, and the thing\u0027s great siphon in him, emptying him? Save him? And what of myself? You, Diredeath, have not seen this creature! Why, even Lesk the Glut - in whichever hell he now resides - would not stray near such a monster! No, I fled.\n \u0027And all the way out of that long, long tunnel, I could hear the thing\u0027s slobbering as it drained Volse\u0027s juices. Also, by the time I struck light and open air, I fancied it slobbered all the louder, perhaps hot on my trail. In something of a panic - yes, I admit it -1 called a mist out of myself and hurried out onto the slopes and down to the plain of snow and ice. There I stripped off, for Volse\u0027s drench was poisonous, and without further pause hurried back here... and found you two waiting for me.\n \u0027The tale is told\n Arkis and Shaithis sat back, narrowed their eyes and fingered their chins. Shaithis kept his thoughts mainly to himself (though truth to tell there was nothing especially sinister or vindictive about them); but Diredeath, feeling that he still had the Ferenc at something of a disadvantage, was somewhat loath to let the giant so lightly off the hook.\n \u0027Times and fortunes change,\u0027 the leper\u0027s son eventually said. \u0027I went starving - went, indeed, in fear of my life! -when you and the great wen had the upper hand. But now... you are only one man against myself and the Lord Shaithis.\u0027\n \u0027These things are true,\u0027 Fess answered, standing up and stretching, and flexing the mighty talons which were his hands. \u0027But do you know, I can\u0027t help wondering what the Lord Shaithis sees in you, leper\u0027s son? For it seems to me there\u0027s about as much use in you as there was in that mighty bag of slops called Volse Pinescu! Also, and now that I come to think of it, it strikes me I sat still for a good many hurtful slights and insults while relating my story. Of course, I was hungry and cold as death, and a man will sit still for a lot while there\u0027s a chance he can fill his belly. But now that my belly\u0027s full and I\u0027m warm again ... I think you\u0027d do well to back off, Diredeath. Or come to just such an end as your name suggests.\u0027\n \u0027Aye,\u0027 said Shaithis with a quick nod, coming between them. \u0027Well, and enough of that. For let\u0027s face it, we\u0027ve all we can handle in the Icelands themselves, without we\u0027re at each other\u0027s throats, too.\u0027 He took their arms and sat down, drawing them down with him. \u0027Now tell me,\u0027 he said, \u0027what are the secrets of these Icelands? For after all, I\u0027m the newcomer here; but the two of you...? Why, you\u0027ve explored and adventured galore! And so the sooner I know all that you know, the sooner we\u0027ll be able to decide on our next move.\u0027\n Shaithis let his gaze wander to and fro, from one to the other, finally allowing it to settle on Arkis\u0027s dark and twitching countenance, his coarse lips and the yellow ivory of his tusks. \u0027So how about it, Arkis?\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve had a little less freedom than Fess, it\u0027s true, but still you\u0027ve managed to explore a few ice-castles. Well, the Ferenc has told us his tale of the horror in the cone, so now I reckon it\u0027s your turn. What of the ice-aeries, eh? What of these ancient, exiled, ice-encysted Wamphyri Lords?\u0027\n Arkis scowled at him. \u0027You want to know about the frozen ones?\u0027\n \u0027The sooner all is known,\u0027 said Shaithis, nodding, \u0027the sooner we may proceed.\u0027\n Arkis shrugged, however grudgingly. \u0027I have no problem with that,\u0027 he said. \u0027So ... you want to know what I\u0027ve seen, done, discovered? It won\u0027t take long in the telling, I promise you!\u0027\n Tell us anyway,\u0027 said Shaithis, \u0027and we\u0027ll see what we make of it.\u0027\n Again Arkis\u0027s shrug. \u0027So be it,\u0027 he said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-10.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
