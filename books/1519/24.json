{"id":62538,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Harry and Karen - The Threat of the Icelands Karen glided her flyer to earth at the north-facing front of the garden, just beyond the low wall there, where the ground sloped steeply away towards Starside. It was a good relaunch site and well known to her, for this was where she\u0027d blinded the crazed Lesk the Glut, cut out his heart, and given his grotesque body to the garden\u0027s defenders for burning. Leaving The Dweller\u0027s old house and making his way towards her through the dispersing mist, the Necroscope sent a dazed thought ahead of him: Is it really you, Karen, or am I seeing and hearing things? I mean, how can this be real? I saw you dead and broken on the scree where you\u0027d thrown yourself down from the roof of your aerie. Hah! she answered. And without malice: But that was when you were seeing things, Harry Keogh! She had stepped through a break in the wall and stood poised there, waiting for him, silhouetted against wall and flyer both. The latter, a nightmare dragon thing but harmless for all its prehistoric design, nodded, salivated, and blinked huge, owlish eyes. It swayed its flat, spatulate head this way and that; its damp, gleaming manta wings were of fine, flexible alveolate bone thinly sheathed in metamorphic flesh; worm legs or thrusters bunched beneath the doughy bulge of its body. Harry looked at it and wondered why he felt no horror and very little pity. For he knew that the thing had been fashioned from the flesh of trogs or Travellers. Perhaps there was no more horror left in him. Or perhaps there was no more human. Except, drawing closer to Karen, he knew that some of his emotions at least were still human. She was breathtaking. In the world beyond the sphere Gate - the world of men, now an entire universe away - her like had been quite unknown. Even her crimson eyes seemed beautiful... now. Harry was awed by her beauty, struck by it no less than when he\u0027d first seen her, that time when she came here to join the garden\u0027s defenders in defiance of the Wamphyri. She had enthralled him then and did so again now. He couldn\u0027t take his eyes off her. He drank her in: From the burnished copper of her hair, down through every gorgeous curve of her body (which, whether half-hidden or half-exposed, was always given emphasis by her sheath of soft white leather), to the pale leather sandals on her feet, open at the toes to show her toenails painted gold, she was ravishing. Over her shoulders she wore a cloak of black fur, and about her waist a wide black belt whose grey-metal buckle was shaped into a snarling wolf\u0027s head. The sigil\u0027s significance was lost in the past; Dramal Doombody\u0027s ancestors had passed it down to him, and he in his turn had passed it to Karen. And not only his crest, but Dramal had given Karen his egg, too. Riveted for long moments by her weirdness, her unearthly beauty and contrasting colours, Harry had paused; now he moved closer. Face to face, Karen was even more beautiful, more desirable. Countering his approach - shifting her body to mirror his every move -she displayed the sinuous motion of a Gypsy dancer which he remembered so well. But of course, for upon a time she\u0027d been a Traveller. Why, only listen and he might hear the chime and jingle of her movements... yes, even when there was none to hear! He heard these things now, and then her telepathic voice, chiming in his mind: You very nearly killed me once, Harry. And I should warn you: my first reason for coming here was to return the favour! She brought forward her right hand, until now hidden behind her back. Her battle gauntlet was in position; when she flexed her hand, a torturer\u0027s delight of blades, hooks and small scythes gleamed silver in the starlight. Harry conjured a M\u0026ouml;bius door on his immediate right and fixed it there. Invisible, it was the perfect bolthole if such were needed. Let Karen take a swing at him, he\u0027d merely feint right and disappear. But these were thoughts he must keep to himself, while out loud: \u0027Are you saying you\u0027re here to kill me?\u0027 To which, in a voice that trembled at the very edge of her control, she answered in kind: \u0027And are you saying you don\u0027t deserve it?\u0027 Still keeping his own mind guarded, Harry looked into hers and saw the furious passions brewing there, saw anger bordering on rage, but nothing of hatred. Also, and very importantly, he saw the Lady Karen\u0027s loneliness. They were two of a kind now. \u0027I didn\u0027t understand what it was like to be...\u0027he began, and paused; and tried again: \u0027I mean, I thought I was helping you, curing you, as of some vile disease. But I admit it, I did it for my son as much as for you. For if I could cure you...\u0027 \u0027Cure!\u0027 She spat the word out. \u0027Why don\u0027t you try curing yourself! There is no cure, Necroscope! Surely you must know that by now?\u0027 He nodded, took a chance and inched closer yet. And: \u0027Yes, I do know,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But in a way I did cure you. You had a vampire in you, the sort the Wamphyri called a \"mother\". If you had spawned so many vampires, in the end it must diminish you, kill you. Am I right?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll never know, will we?\u0027 she growled. Harry stood directly before her, less than a pace away, well within the arc of her gauntlet. \u0027So you came to kill me.\u0027 He nodded. \u0027But surely you can see I\u0027ve suffered my own change? And surely you know in your heart that I was never your enemy, Karen? I was merely innocent. In my way.\u0027 She stared hard at him for a moment, narrowed her eyes a little, then nodded and smiled. But it was more a sneer than a smile proper. \u0027I\u0027ve found you out!\u0027 she said. \u0027I sense your door, Harry! You took me there once, remember? You carried me from the garden to my aerie, all in a moment. And now there\u0027s another door right here beside you. Would you dare stand so close without it? If so, then do it. Show me how \"innocent\" you are.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027That was then,\u0027 he said. \u0027As for now: whatever I might wish to be, I can only be Wamphyri! Precious little of innocence in me now... about as much as there is in you? Yes, the thing within advised me to conjure a door, for my protection. Or for its protection? But the man which I still am tells me I don\u0027t need this safeguard, that it makes anything I might say to you - the things I want to say to you - a mockery. And while I live, the man in me has the upper hand. So be it!\u0027 He threw caution to the wind, collapsed the M\u0026ouml;bius door and opened his mind wide to her. In a few moments she read or scanned all that was written there, for he kept nothing hidden. But in telepathy, to read is often to feel, and most of all she felt his pain: as great and greater than her own. And his loss - all of his losses - whose total was so much more. And she saw how lonely and empty he was, which brought her own loneliness and emptiness into proper perspective. But... she was a woman and remembered certain things. As his right hand closed in the curve of her waist at first gently, then possessively, so she bent her elbow at his side until her open gauntlet leaned loosely against his back and upper-left arm. And she said, \u0027Do you recall the time I told you how I\u0027d lusted after you? In how many ways I lusted after you? Like a woman, perhaps - but certainly like a vampire! And do you remember when you trapped me in my room, how I tried to lure you? I went naked, writhing, panting, thrusting at you - and you ignored me. It was as if your flesh was iron and your blood ice.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he husked in her ear, drinking in the natural musk of her body, drawing her to him and bending down his head to her. \u0027My body was flesh and my blood was fire. But I had set myself a course and must run it. Now... it\u0027s run.\u0027 She felt his need swelling to match, to intensify, her own - so much need - and was aware of his heartbeat like a hammer against her breast. \u0027You... you\u0027re a fool, Harry Keogh!\u0027 she whispered, as he crushed her even tighter. And every nerve of her body thrilled as Wamphyri instinct demanded that she scoop her gauntlet into the flesh and bone of his back and spoon it out, then reach inside and slice his heart to a crimson-pumping geyser. Thrilled, yes, and thrilled again - in astonishment - when she relaxed her hand so that the weapon fell from her fluttering fingers, fell loose to the ground! \u0027Even as great a fool as I am,\u0027 she moaned then, sinking red-painted razor-sharp nails through cloth and skin and shivering flesh into his back and neck, as he in turn wrenched her sheath dress apart, and clutched her bruisingly wherever his hands would reach, and bit her face and mouth until the blood flowed. \u0027Which is to say,\u0027 she panted, when finally they held each other burning at bay, \u0027a very great fool indeed!\u0027 They flew to her aerie. Mounted behind her in the ornate saddle at the base of the flyer\u0027s neck where its manta wings sprouted, Harry must cling to Karen or risk falling - in which case he would conjure a door and fall through it into the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. But he would not fall while he fondled her straining breasts, whose nipples were nuggets under her ruined sheath. And he would not fall while his manhood strained in the crevice of her delicious behind, surging there as if to lift her out of her seat. \u0027Wait!\u0027 she had told him back there in the garden, at the wall, where with his new-found Wamphyri passions he would have taken her immediately and ploughed her like a field of yielding flesh. And: \u0027Wait!\u0027 she\u0027d repeated twice during the flight, when he\u0027d moaned louder than the wind in her ear and bitten the back of her neck, and she had felt his metamorphic flesh flowing to enfold her while his hands enlarged and flattened as if to touch all of her at once. And yet again, \u0027Wait! Oh, wait! she had pleaded with him, when the flyer set them down in a launching-landing bay some levels lower than her topmost apartments, and she had almost to flee before his lust across the cartilage causeways and up stairways of fretted bone to her rooms. But at last he caught her in her bedroom and knew that the waiting was over, for both of them. Harry had made love so very recently, yet now it was all forgotten and perhaps not surprisingly. For if space and time are so linked as to be inextricable (to any ordinary man), just how long ago was it since he had known Penny? A dimension ago? An entire universe? And as a universe is huge almost to infinity, how then the time-gap between universes? Time is relative, as the Necroscope knew only too well. But in any case, that earlier phase now seemed fuzzy as a dream, while \u0027now\u0027 was the only reality. Penny had been a mirage, a dream-creature, a waif light as thistledown, enthralled and drawn into his dream with him, and at last destroyed by it. But Karen was... Woman. She was substantial, compelling, consuming; a magnet, with gravity of her own great as a small planet, so that she held him like a moon to light her flesh and lust after it. For Harry she was the embodiment of all earthly (unearthly?) desire; greater than a mere planet, she was his own personal black hole, which might suck him in in his entirety. Indeed, Karen was all of this and more. Karen was Wamphyri! Upon her bed they twined and tangled, panted, grunted and groaned, and in all truth Harry no longer knew what was real and what was fantasy. He had not previously explored his metamorphism; he didn\u0027t know the extent of fleshly flexibility; he was \u0027innocent\u0027 in respect of his own passion\u0027s potential. And Karen, too, innocent. Or very nearly so. \u0027You have kept yourself to yourself?\u0027 the Necroscope gaspingly inquired of his vampire love while extending a hand and its fingers within her to examine and caress all of her innermost organs and places, and while she moistened with spittle the shining fist which was his glans and taunted its throbbing with the slither of her forked tongue. \u0027No,\u0027 she groaned truthfully. Twice I flew to Sunside at sundown to seek me out a lover. But how may one seduce a terrified man? Anyway, I brought one back here. In a little while he overcame something of his fear and crept into my bed. Ah, I was a yawning chasm, an aching gorge... into which he dropped a pebble! He could not fill me. I milked him dry and wanted more, but all he had left was blood. I knew that I could grind him down, turn him to pulp, murder him within the heart of my womanhood and devour him into myself as easily as eating him. But ... I took him back to Sunside. Since when I\u0027ve kept me to myself, yes. Just as men and women are for each other, so we Wamphyri may only cleave unto Wamphyri flesh. For there\u0027s no pleasure in beasts, and when Wamphyri blood is up humanity is frail.\u0027 \u0027All true,\u0027 gurgled the Necroscope, feeling her left nipple extend into his throat like a tongue, while his scrotum swelled to bursting from the pressure of his juices. \u0027A woman would die in agony from what I have done to you!\u0027 \u0027Likewise a man from these caresses of mine,\u0027 she replied, shuddering. \u0027But of pleasure, however monstrous!\u0027 And she drew out his great, soft, spidercrab hand from her body, folded his legs at the knees and fed them into herself; until finally he was drawn in to his navel, and she experienced the geysering of his cold semen laving her palpitating innards. \u0027And yet the Old Lords in their time took Traveller women for themselves,\u0027 Harry panted in his delirium. She was full of him now, her pale belly round and shining, grotesquely bloated where his arms and hands encircled it; and her body had so gorged on him that he looked half-born. She coiled herself forward to kiss him, and their teeth clashed as the flesh of their faces melted into one face. A moment later she extruded him in a huge contraction; but just as quickly he entered her again, head-first this time, so that she must speak to him telepathically to answer his query. Those women died screaming, she said. I\u0027ve heard it said that following a raid, Lesk the Glut would take ten or more in a night, bursting them like bladders with his sex! Ah, that was violation! But the so-called \u0027Lords\u0027 weren\u0027t all alike; if a girl was beautiful, then she might survive. Brought on by degrees, she would be vampirized, and as her metamorphosis progressed so her satyr Lord would instruct her. The Lord Magula fashioned himself a huge mound of a woman, and slept within her when their excesses exhausted him. She expanded herself convulsively to let him out, then fell on him and grasped at his slick body with exploratory hands of her own. The Wamphyri equivalent of \u0027talking dirty\u0027 had incensed them... what orifices could be entered (of each of them) were entered; their kisses fetched blood; their juices drenched the bed and dripped from it on to the floor all around. They themselves flopped damply from the bed, slipping and sliding in their own liquids. Harry\u0027s system endlessly manufactured semen, which was endlessly sucked from him by Karen\u0027s various lips. They let their vampires run rampant. Scythe teeth nibbled (but never so deep as the bone), and nails like claws of Tyrannosaur pulled and gouged (but only to bruise, never to break). They reduced the bedclothes to drenched rags, the slate bed itself to rubble, the huge room to a shambles. Their lovemaking (lustmaking?) grew frantic and impossible to follow in its contortions and convolutions. Their cries became primal as their bodies shared totally; they knew sex as no merely human beings had ever known it; the Necroscope\u0027s greatest climax of many was when Karen entered him. For fifteen hours they spent themselves, vented, tormented and demented themselves. So that in the end they didn\u0027t merely sleep but fell unconscious in each other\u0027s coils... When Harry came out of it, Karen was washing him. \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 he said, feebly trying to push her away. \u0027A waste of time. I want you again, now, while you\u0027re still here.\u0027 \u0027Still here?\u0027 She took his member in her hand to cool its bruises with water, and watched it grow there like a club. \u0027It\u0027s a dream, Karen, a dream!\u0027 he gasped, his hand seeking her softness. \u0027Like everything gone before. Dreams of a madman. I know it now for sure, for I saw you lying dead. Yet here, now... you live! Unless ... is there a necromancer in Starside?\u0027 She shook her head, drawing back from him a little where his hands began to pull with some insistence at her once more entirely human breasts. And: \u0027It were best if you listened to me, Harry,\u0027 she said. \u0027I wasn\u0027t dead that time. It wasn\u0027t me you saw lying there, broken in the bony scree.\u0027 \u0027Not you? Then who?\u0027 \u0027Do you remember when you starved me?\u0027 Karen stared hard, earnestly, even accusingly at him. \u0027Do you remember how you lured my vampire out of my body with a trail of pig\u0027s blood? Ah, but I was Wamphyri and crafty! The mother creature Inside me was crafty! More so than any other. She - it - left an egg in me. The tenacity of the vampire, Harry.\u0027 \u0027You... you were still Wamphyri?\u0027 His mouth had fallen half-open. \u0027Even after I burned your vampire and its eggs?\u0027 \u0027You burned all but one!\u0027 she insisted, \u0027which remained in me. The thing would grow again, yes. But I knew that if you suspected as much, then that you\u0027d try again. And then that I would die! Oh, and the thought of that terrified me.\u0027 \u0027I remember how I slept.\u0027 Harry licked dry, almost desiccated lips. \u0027I was even more exhausted than now: by what I\u0027d seen and done.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 She nodded. \u0027You fell asleep in a chair, which was when I was saved. For while you slept one of mine returned to the aerie.\u0027 \u0027One of yours? A creature?\u0027 Harry frowned. \u0027But they were all destroyed or sent away.\u0027 \u0027Sent away, yes,\u0027 she answered. \u0027You had set this one free out of the \"goodness\" of your heart... sent her away to die!\u0027 \u0027Her?\u0027 \u0027A trog, a handmaiden, a creature who performed menial tasks within the aerie and in my personal chambers. But she had been born here and understood no other existence, and eventually she returned to the only home she\u0027d ever known. I knew it the moment she set foot on the bottom step of the nethermost stairwell; she heard my mind-call and came as fast as she could; but she was starved from her wandering in the cold wilderness of Starside, and wearied unto death by her climb through all the aerie\u0027s levels. Even unto death, aye.\u0027 \u0027She died?\u0027 Harry felt Karen\u0027s small sadness, as at the death of a favourite pet. The vampire Lady nodded. \u0027But not before she\u0027d removed the silver chains from my door and disposed of the potted kneblasch plants! Then she collapsed and died, and I saw my chance. \u0027While still you slept, I dressed her corpse in my best white dress and bundled it from the ramparts. She fluttered down, down, almost as if she flew! But in the end she rushed to the rocks and was broken. This was what you saw when you looked down from that high balcony, Harry. But me: I was in hiding, where I stayed until you were gone from here.\u0027 The Necroscope saw it all now. \u0027I went back to The Dweller\u0027s garden,\u0027 he said. \u0027My son knew what I\u0027d done. Fearing for his own existence, he took my powers from me, then transported me back to my own world where for a time I was only a man. But I discovered monsters there and they discovered me. Until, as you can see, in the end I set myself against one vampire too many.\u0027 Karen had settled down between his spread legs. Despite the seriousness of their discussion of past events, Harry\u0027s shaft pounded there like a second heart where her fingers teased the shining rim of its bell. She paused a while to moisten its pulsing tip with her snake\u0027s tongue, and to trap its swaying trunk between her breasts. And: \u0027How strong you are, Harry,\u0027 she sighed, perhaps wonderingly. \u0027Indeed, I do believe you\u0027re full again.\u0027 \u0027To see your face,\u0027 he answered, \u0027to smell your body, and feel you wet in your core... how could I be other than full again?\u0027 He lifted her up to seat her on his rod, but instead she slipped from his grasp and stepped down from the bed. \u0027Not here,\u0027 she panted. \u0027Oh?\u0027 \u0027There!\u0027 she said. \u0027There?\u0027 \u0027In that secret place of yours.\u0027 \u0027The M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum? To make love there?\u0027 \u0027Why not? Is it a holy place?\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t answer. But ... it could well be. It could well be. \u0027Will you take me there, Harry? And will you take me, fuck me there?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he answered, throatily. \u0027And I\u0027ll show you a place you just won\u0027t believe, where we can fuck for a second or a century, as you will!\u0027 She flew into his arms and he rolled her out of the sheets and into the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. \u0027But... there\u0027s no light!\u0027 she hissed, opening her legs wide and guiding him into her. \u0027I need to see you: the way your face quakes when you come, the slackening of your mouth as the throbbing subsides and the aching starts.\u0027 \u0027You shall have light,\u0027 he grunted, nodding... and in the next moment felt a deadly fear. For that had been close to blasphemy. But he had not intended it. She would have light, yes: blue light, green, and a little red. And as she clawed at his buttocks and rode his bucking, whipping piston shaft, so he foamed within her and carried her moaning through a future-time door. And now she saw the future racing away from her, and the scarlet light streaming from her own body, with only the faintest trace of blue. Indeed Karen\u0027s light mingled with Harry\u0027s, twining even as their bodies twined, and his was only slightly less red than hers. Our life-lines, he told her. We ride them into our future. And then, quoting Fa��thor: We ride there faster than life! We ride each other into the future, she answered, thrilling to the starburst sensation of it, and to the shock of Harry bursting inside her. And in a little while: \u0027The blues?\u0027 Travellers, he told her. True human beings. Then the handful of reds can only be Wamphyri! Survivors in the Icelands. And the greens must be trogs. I... I never saw such colours, such light! Even the brightest auroras over the Icelands were never as bright as this. Harry plied her breasts like dough in his hands and came yet again, and she felt his seed spraying her inner walls and shuddered to its gush. Your come is cold as a waterfall. No, it\u0027s hot. But cool against your insides, which are a volcano. It only feels that way, she moaned. For in truth we\u0027re both cold, Harry. Both of us. We\u0027re Wamphyri, he answered, but we aren\u0027t undead. We\u0027ve never been dead, not in the way some vampirized people \u0027die\u0027 and sleep a while before their rebirth from the grave. I had expected to be cold, certainly - expected to feel the lust of the Wamphyri, their raw, roaring appetite for life and for all dark carnal experience - but with nothing of enduring emotion. But this is much more than that, other than that. For you, perhaps, she answered, for you\u0027re not long a vampire. And yet... maybe you\u0027re right. This isn\u0027t as I imagined it. The Old Wamphyri were liars, as anyone knows; could it be that they lied about this, too? Incapable of love, they said. But were they? Or merely incapable of owning up to it? Is it weak to love someone, Harry? And is it strong to be cold and without love? He welded himself to her, all of his parts melting into hers. Cold? he growled. Well, if we\u0027re that cold, then why is our blood so hot? And if we\u0027re that weak, then why do I feel so strong? No, I think you\u0027ve got it in one. The last and most blatant lie of the Wamphyri: that they were without love. They weren\u0027t, they were merely afraid to admit it. And the Necroscope knew that at last the truth of the matter was exposed. The Wamphyri had always been capable of dark passions, desires and deeds beyond the human range; but now, on the same far side of the spectrum, he and Karen had discovered in themselves genuine, equally powerful bonding emotions. And letting those emotions rule could only properly be described as an ecstasy. However sudden, weird and alien their love, they were true lovers. There was lust in it, of course, but was there ever a love affair between man and woman without lust? As a single fused mass - the first half-human couple ever to \u0027cleave\u0027 to one another in the fullest sense of the word - they sped down the future time-stream. Until out of nowhere, suddenly: A new light... golden fire... incredible... bursting... all-consuming! At first Harry thought it was some strange and wonderful effect of their sex, their love, but it was more than that. The great, throbbing, one-note Ahhhhhh chorus of the future - which was not sound at all as such but the mind\u0027s reaction to a three-dimensional display of ever-expanding time - changed in the space of a single moment to a fiery hissssss! And the Necroscope brought their headlong rush to an abrupt, tumbling halt. Partly extricating themselves but still mainly fused, they spun on an axis of their own while time rushed on. And Karen, temporarily blind, sank needle claws into Harry\u0027s shoulders to gasp, What was that? But the Necroscope, even Harry Keogh, had no answer. As his own eyes adjusted to the golden brilliance, and his mind to the sear and the sizzle, so he glanced back at what had been: like looking into the heart of an exploding blue star, where chemical imbalances caused red and green imperfections. Back there, all was as before. But up ahead, in future time - - Harry\u0027s and Karen\u0027s threads of life were no longer red but bright gold where they rushed out of their bodies into the future. And the future itself was a blaze of gold tinged with the leaping orange flares of fire! Slowly the brazen yellow glare diminished and faded away, smoking into darkness like embers drenched in rain. And the life-lines of the two vanished with it. Beyond this point there was no future for them, not on Starside. But there was a future for some. For the dazed blue life-lines raced on; likewise the greens, though there were fewer of them now. But as for the reds: nowhere a sign of them. And the darkness seemed greater than the light. A disaster! Harry thought, and Karen heard him. But what happened - what will happen - here? Baffled, he could only shake his head and shrug. The greens seem sickly. They are dying. It was so: a good many trog life-lines grew dim, flickered low and blinked out even as they watched. But the Necroscope\u0027s heart picked up again as he noted that others seemed to gain strength and brightness to speed on. And he breathed a mental sigh of relief as new lines commenced to spark into existence, signifying new births and beginnings. Then: he gathered his startled wits, conjured a door and drew Karen through it into the more nearly \u0027normal\u0027 flux of metaphysical being. But what happened? She clung to him even tighter. I don\u0027t know. He shook his head and guided her through a final door, emerging from the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum onto the roof of her aerie. And facing into a cold wind off Starside, he added, \u0027But whatever it was, it will happen, be sure.\u0027 Feeling her shivering where she huddled in his arms, and sensing her despair, he stared inquiringly into her crimson eyes. \u0027Perhaps I know,\u0027 she told him then. \u0027For we\u0027ve sensed their resurgence a while now.\u0027 \u0027We?\u0027 He allowed her to lead him below, out of the starlight and into the aerie\u0027s topmost rooms. \u0027Your son and I.\u0027 She nodded. \u0027While he was still himself.\u0027 And: \u0027Their resurgence? Them?\u0027 But even asking, so Harry worked out the answer for himself. And now, too, he understood Lardis Lidesci\u0027s anxiety and animosity in The Dweller\u0027s garden. The Wamphyri.\u0027 She nodded. The Old Lords. Condemned to the Icelands, but not content with the Icelands.\u0027 They passed through massive, fiercely frescoed halls of fretted bone and carved stone, descended cartilage stairs to her chambers where they collapsed into great chairs. And in a while: Tell me all,\u0027 Harry grunted. It had started (on Harry\u0027s time scale) two years earlier, which was to say two years after the battle for The Dweller\u0027s garden, whose outcome had been the defeat and rout of the Old Wamphyri Lords. \u0027Sensing a threat from the Icelands,\u0027 (Karen went on), \u0027I requested an audience with The Dweller, during which I confided in him the substance of my fears. By that time he knew well enow that I had survived your \"cure\", but in any case there was a truce between us. After all, I\u0027d fought alongside you and your son against the Wamphyri; he could not doubt but that I was his ally. Occasionally I would visit him in the mountains, and there were times when he even came to see me here. We were friends, you understand, nothing more. \u0027But they were strange times: the change was on him; he was losing human flesh and putting on the shape and ways of a wolf. Still and all, and while he retained the mind of a man, we became true allies a second time. For he, too, in his way, had felt the Icelands threat: a weird foreboding that waxed and waned with the auroras, a DOOM which crouched there like a beast on the frozen frontier, all hunched down into itself and tensed ready to spring. \u0027I have said he sensed it \"in his way\". Your son is a wolf now, Necroscope, with a wolf\u0027s senses and instincts. Across all the leagues he could smell them on the winds out of the north, see them riding in the auroras, hear them whispering and plotting. Plotting their return and their revenge, aye! \u0027Their revenge, Harry: on The Dweller and his people, on me, on any and all who had helped defeat them, destroy their aeries and banish them into the great cold. Which is to say, on you, too. Except, of course, you were not here at that time. There was only The Dweller and myself. And going the way he was ... it would not be long before I was alone. \u0027I asked him what must be done. \u0027\"We must set guards,\" he told me, \"out there in the cold waste, to look north and report back on any curious incursions from the Icelands.\" \u0027\"Guards?\" \u0027\"You must make them,\" he said. \"Are you not Wamphyri and Dramal Doombody\u0027s rightful heir? Didn\u0027t he show you how?\" \u0027\"Indeed, I know how to make creatures,\" I told him. \u0027\"Then do it!\" he barked. \"Make warriors, but make them male and female. Make them so they can make themselves!\" \u0027\"Self-reproducing?\" The very idea made me gasp. \"But that is forbidden! Even the worst of the old Wamphyri Lords would never have dared... would not even consider - \" \u0027\" - Which is why you must do it!\" He was forceful. \"Aye, for it will save you time at the vats. Make them so they can live and breed on the ice, and feed themselves on the great fishes which live under the ice. But build them with a safety device: only three whelps to a pair, and all males. After that, they\u0027ll die out soon enough. But not until they\u0027ve reported whatever it is that threatens - and done battle with it when it comes rumbling out of the north!\"\u0027 Karen shrugged. \u0027Your son had great wisdom, Necroscope. He knew good from evil, and knew the source of the worst possible evil. But his humanity was failing fast: he knew that when the time came he would not be able to help me, and so he would help me now, with good advice. I thought it was good, anyway.\u0027 \u0027And in the Icelands?\u0027 Harry queried. \u0027Shaithis? Is it him?\u0027 Karen shuddered. \u0027None other. And not alone.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 She grasped his arm. \u0027Do you remember that time at the garden? The fire and thunder; the gas beasts exploding in the sky and raining their guts down on everything; the screams of trogs and Travellers when Wamphyri Lords and lieutenants came strutting with their gauntlets dripping red?\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027I remember all of that: also how we seared them with The Dweller\u0027s lamps, blinded their flyers, set your warriors against theirs, and finally reduced them to vile evaporation with rays from the sun itself!\u0027 \u0027But not all of them,\u0027 she said. \u0027And Shaithis was only one of the survivors.\u0027 \u0027Who else?\u0027 \u0027The giant Fess Ferenc and the hideous Volse Pinescu; also Arkis Leperson, plus several lieutenants and thralls. None of these were accounted for in the fighting. We must assume they fled north after discovering their aeries shattered and tumbled down to the plain.\u0027 The Necroscope breathed a sigh of relief. \u0027No more than a handful, then.\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027Shaithis on his own would be more than a handful, Harry. Not then, when we had your son and his army to side with, but now, when we have only survivors. And what of all the other Lords banished and driven into the Icelands throughout Wamphyri history? What if they have survived, too? Prior to the battle in the garden, all such went singly, slinking, never in a group. Or they might be allowed to take a woman and the odd thrall with them. Perhaps Shaithis and the others have found them and organized them into a small army. But could any army of the Wamphyri ever be said to be small?\u0027 \u0027It could be worse than that,\u0027 Harry gloomed at her. \u0027If they took women with them - if they could live with the unending cold - why shouldn\u0027t they breed like your warriors? Let\u0027s face it, we don\u0027t even know what the Icelands are like. Maybe the only thing that kept Icelanders from invading all of this time was the fact that the Old Wamphyri were stronger! But now... there are no \"Old\" Wamphyri. Only us, the \"new\" Wamphyri.\u0027 \u0027Also,\u0027 she reminded him, \u0027out there at the rim of the cold and sluggish sea, a dozen or more warriors, watchers, guards.\u0027 \u0027You followed my son\u0027s advice and made yourself some creatures?\u0027 \u0027Yes...\u0027 But she looked away. \u0027Out of what? And why do you avoid my eyes?\u0027 Karen snatched her head round to glare her defiance at him. \u0027I avoid nothing! I found my materials in the stumps of the shattered aeries, in the workshops of the Lords. Most were ruined, crushed or buried forever, but some were intact. At first I blundered, creating flyers which could not fly, warriors which would not fight. But gradually I perfected my art. You have seen and ridden upon my flyer: an exceptional beast. Likewise my warriors. I made three pairs which were sound and fearsome and mighty, who by now have made six or even nine more. Except...\u0027 And again she turned her face away. Harry caught her chin in a hand and turned it back again. \u0027Except?\u0027 \u0027For a while now they have not answered my calls. I send my thoughts out across Starside, requesting information, but they don\u0027t hear me. Or if they do, they fail - or refuse - to answer.\u0027 Harry frowned. \u0027You\u0027ve lost control over them?\u0027 She tossed her head. \u0027It was something the Old Wamphyri were always afraid of: to make creatures with a will of their own, which might one day bolt and run wild. Mercifully I heeded The Dweller\u0027s warning and they are doomed genetically: there\u0027ll be no females among the offspring.\u0027 Harry gave a grunt. \u0027So, you have watchers who don\u0027t watch, and warriors which won\u0027t war. What other \"precautions\" have you taken against this threat from the Icelands?\u0027 Now she hissed at him. \u0027Do you snigger at my works, Necroscope? And should I tell you how I had decided to meet the threat, when and if it should arise? Remember, before you came I was a woman alone; and how do you think Shaithis would deal with me - with Karen, great traitor bitch of the Wamphyri! - if he had survived the Icelands and would now return here? Should I surrender myself to his tender mercies? Hah, no, not while I could defy him to the last!\u0027 \u0027Defy him?\u0027 (Lit up in the blaze of her hair and eyes, and in the gleam of her teeth, Harry was struck anew with the thought: She\u0027s a volcano, inside and out!) And out loud: \u0027How, defy him?\u0027 Again she tossed her head. \u0027Why, rather than have Shaithis force himself upon me, I\u0027d give myself to a more destructive, even more faithless lover. For I\u0027d mount my flyer and head south, over the mountains and across Sunside, even into the brazen face of the sun itself. Let Shaithis chase me there if he would, into streaming gases and exploding flesh and nothingness. So be it!\u0027 Harry drew her into his arms and she came without resistance. \u0027It won\u0027t come to that,\u0027 he husked, stroking her hair while her furious tremors subsided. \u0027Not if I have anything to do with it.\u0027 But etched on the mirror of the Necroscope\u0027s inner mind, kept hidden even from Karen\u0027s telepathy, was a scene out of future time which try as he might he could not banish. A picture of a fiery, molten gold future. A vision of THE END, framed in the scarlet, all-consuming fires of an ultimate hell...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-24.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
