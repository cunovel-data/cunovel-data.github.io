{"id":62534,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Nightmare Junction Johnny had stopped at an all-services motorway watering-hole north of Newark. He\u0027d chosen the A1(T) rather than the larger Ml because its service stations usually had richer pickings: not only long-distance truckers and motorists used its facilities but locals, too. It was Johnny\u0027s experience that when the town and village dance halls slowed down around midnight the young ones headed this way for a cheap motorway meal after a hard night\u0027s drinking, dancing and whatever. He\u0027d stopped here before, but no luck as yet. Maybe tonight. On clutch and air-brakes, he\u0027d snorted and whoofed the big articulated truck around the tarmac until he\u0027d found a place to park it where its nose sniffed the exit route. It was as well to be able to drive out of such places with as little trouble as possible. The place was on a major junction; the car park was busy and the lorry park half-empty; people came and went in small parties to and from the brightly-lit diner. Johnny\u0027s would be just one more face over a plate of chicken and chips and a pint of alcohol-free. Inside, there\u0027d been nothing much of a queue at the self-service bar; in a little while Johnny had settled at a table in a corner booth where he\u0027d toyed with his food and casually looked the place over for a likely female face. There were several, but... they didn\u0027t fit his bill: too old, too drab, slack-faced, sharp-eyed, accompanied, or stone-cold sober. A few bright-eyed young things, yes, but all hanging on to flash boyfriends. Well, that\u0027s how it went. But there were plenty more places just like this between here and London. And you never could tell when your luck was going to change. He remembered a time when, on a lonely stretch of road, this bird had roared by in a little red sports job. He\u0027d bombed after her and forced her off the road into a ditch, then told her he was sorry and it was an accident -but he would be glad to give her a lift to the nearest I garage. Oh, he\u0027d given her a lift, all right, but not to a garage. And then it had been her turn to give him a lift, a really good one, a real high. Johnny had been in a weird mood that night: after killing her he\u0027d chopped a channel up under her jaw and fucked her in the throat. She\u0027d felt it, of course, and how the dead bitch had yelped! Oh, she\u0027d had cock in her throat before, but not coming from that direction. Thinking about it had got him worked up. He must have one tonight. But not from this place. Maybe he should move on. And that was when he saw ... he saw... what the shit? It wasn\u0027t possible but ... he had to fight with his eyes to keep them from looking in her direction again. She was just over there; she\u0027d just slid her backside on to a seat in a booth close by; there was a blind guy there, too - or a guy in dark glasses, anyway - but he didn\u0027t seem to be with her. She had a coffee, just a coffee, and she was the same as last time. She was exactly the same. And for a moment Johnny\u0027s mind whirled, for he could swear he\u0027d had this one before! How can that be? he asked himself. How can it be? And the answer was simple: it couldn\u0027t be. Unless this girl was the other\u0027s twin sister ... or her double.\u0027 And then he remembered reading something about that in the papers: how they thought the one he\u0027d had in Edinburgh - Penny, that was her name - was someone else. But then she\u0027d turned up alive: the spitting image of the one he\u0027d screwed, murdered, and screwed again. Stranger still, the one who\u0027d turned up had also been called Penny. Coincidence? Jesus, coincidence! But the biggest coincidence of them all: here she was, right now, right here. That is, unless he\u0027d started seeing fucking things. Slowly Johnny looked up from his food, through the acid-etched, fern-patterned glass dividers which loaned the booths a little privacy, until her face was directly in his line of vision. Maybe for a moment he caught her eye, but just for a moment, and then she looked away. The half-blind guy - the guy with the eye problem, anyway, who shared her booth - had his back to Johnny; but he didn\u0027t look much anyway, slumped over his mug of coffee like that. Her father, maybe? No, her lover, Harry Keogh answered, but silently, speaking only to himself. Her vampire lover, you scumbag. He had been into Pound\u0027s mind from the moment he and Penny had entered the place, and the mental cesspool in there was as rank as anything he\u0027d ever come up against. Together with the necromancer\u0027s recognition of Penny as a former victim, or that victim\u0027s double, it strengthened Harry\u0027s resolve, confirmed his commitment. But as yet Pound\u0027s recognition of her hadn\u0027t produced the reaction Harry had expected. Curiosity, yes, but not fear. In a way, perhaps that was understandable. For after all Found knew that the other Penny was dead; he knew that this couldn\u0027t be the girl he had violated. Still, his shock had been short-lived and Harry was disappointed. Also, he knew now that he was dealing with a very cool customer. Whether Found would be able to stay cool when confronted with what was on the cards for him... that was something else entirely. Leaving Johnny\u0027s mind, the Necroscope leaned across the table a little toward Penny and quietly said, \u0027I can see how badly shaken you are. I can feel it, too. I\u0027m sorry, Penny, but just try to stay calm. It won\u0027t be long now; when Found leaves I\u0027ll go after him; you\u0027ll stay here and wait for me. OK?\u0027 She nodded and said, \u0027You seem very... well, cold about all of this, Harry.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Just determined. But you see, Found is cold, which might give him an advantage if I allowed myself to get too heated.\u0027 As he spoke, Harry saw two men enter the diner from the car park. They seemed ordinary enough but there was something about them. As they moved along the self-service bar collecting cold drinks, their eyes scanned the room, found the Necroscope and Penny in their booth, moved on. Harry went on to probe their minds - and his telepathic probe at once came up against a wall of mental static! He withdrew immediately. At least one of these men was an esper, which meant E-Branch was closing in ... on both Johnny Found and Harry Keogh! They probably wouldn\u0027t try anything in here - maybe not even in the darkness of the car park - but in any case Harry didn\u0027t want them on his trail. And they\u0027d obviously figured out that if they followed Found they\u0027d find the Necroscope, too. Now of all times he really couldn\u0027t afford this sort of complication. Now, too, he remembered the car he\u0027d seen tailing Pound\u0027s truck out of Darlington: an unmarked police car with... how many men aboard? Two or three? He\u0027d thought they were all policemen but now knew better. Suddenly, coming from nowhere, he felt a growl rising in his throat. His Wamphyri side was reacting to the threat. Aware of Penny\u0027s gaze, he stifled the growl at once. \u0027Harry.\u0027 Her voice was concerned. \u0027You\u0027re very pale.\u0027 Fury, my love. \u0027There\u0027s something I must do,\u0027 he told her. \u0027It will mean leaving you here - but only for a minute. You\u0027ll be OK?\u0027 \u0027In here, alone with him?\u0027 Her eyes were huge and round. There are fifty people in here,\u0027 he answered. And two of them at least are pretty sharp characters. \u0027I promise I\u0027ll be right back.\u0027 She touched his hand and nodded. Then I\u0027ll be OK.\u0027 But she avoided looking Pound\u0027s way. Harry stood up, smiled a robot\u0027s smile at her and went out into the night. At first, to anyone watching, it would appear that he\u0027d been heading for the gents\u0027 toilets, but as he passed close to the swinging glass doors of the exit he turned sharply and pushed through them - - And as soon as he was outside crouched down, breathed a mist and moved wraithlike between the cars ranked like soldiers on the hard-standing. His Wamphyri senses guiding him, he went straight to the unmarked police car and approached it from the rear. There was a driver, a plain-clothes policeman, with one elbow on the sill and a cigarette dangling from his lips where he sat silhouetted in a steel frame, looking out of his wound-down window into the darkness and breathing the mild night air. Exuding fog, the Necroscope moved like a low-slung spider - performed a weirdly loping limbo - to draw silently alongside the car. And then he stood up. The policeman\u0027s jaw fell open in a gasp of astonishment as a shadow, coming from nowhere, blocked out the stars and flowed over him; his cigarette flew as the Necroscope hit him once, hard enough to send him sprawling across the front passenger seat. He was out like a light - or like his cigarette, which Harry ground under his heel. Then he reached inside the car and snapped the key in half in the ignition. So much for that: they wouldn\u0027t be following Johnny - or Harry -anywhere in this car. But to be doubly sure he took out Pound\u0027s steel-tube knife and drove it into the wall of a tyre until it hissed air and sagged down on to its rim. But as he began to straighten up he glanced into the back of the car and froze. The Necroscope\u0027s eyes were attuned to the night, which was his element. He could see into the back of the car just as clearly as in broad daylight. And there on the back seat, a bulky, ugly, dark-snouted shape which Harry knew at once: a flamethrower. And on the floor back there, the blued-steel glitter of a pair of loaded crossbows. Loaded crossbows! Harry hissed and crouched down into himself. They were ready for him, all of them. It must be coming soon. Perhaps sooner than he\u0027d anticipated. Bastards! And he was the one who\u0027d showed them how! He attacked a second tyre and grunted his satisfaction as it collapsed into extinction, then moved round the car and did a third. Following which he paused and drew a ragged breath, and forced himself to be calm, calm... He was trembling, but only trembling. No more hissing, snarling. Mere moments of violence, but they had acted as a safety valve on Harry\u0027s awful pressure. As his mist began to thin he sighed his relief, stood more humanly erect, put away the knife and headed back towards the diner... Mere moments - less than two, three minutes at most -but more than sufficient time that the menace of Johnny Found had got to Penny, cancelling her former resolve to \u0027be OK\u0027. For she had known from the moment Harry left the glass doors swinging behind him and disappeared into the night that she would not be OK, not in the same enclosed space as this monster, not with fifty or five hundred people around her. Mere moments, yes, but enough time for Johnny to make up his mind that Penny would be The One. Obviously the guy with the dark glasses hadn\u0027t been with her after all, and now she was on her own. What was more, she was aware that Johnny was interested; he could feel her avoiding his eyes, even avoiding his thoughts, his existence. And suddenly he wondered: Does she know me? But how could she possibly know him? What the fuck was going on here, anyway? He put aside his plate and placed his hands on the table, palms down, as if to push himself to his feet. And all the while he stared at Penny, willing her to look his way. She was looking his way, however obliquely, and saw him slowly rising. All the colour fled from her face as she too rose, slid out of her booth, backed away from him. She collided with a fat man with a tray and sent milk, hot food, bread rolls flying. Johnny paced after her, smiling a deliberately feigned, surprised smile. It was as if he were saying \u0027What\u0027s wrong? Did I startle you?\u0027 Anyone watching would think: what on earth is wrong with that girl? Is she drunk, on drugs? So pale! And that nice young man looking so surprised, so astonished. And that was the whole thing of it: Johnny Found did look like a \u0027nice young man\u0027. When Harry Keogh had seen him, he\u0027d been surprised that he didn\u0027t more nearly fit the bill. Medium height and blocky build; blond, shoulder-length hair; good, square teeth in a full mouth with a droopy, almost innocent smile... only his slightly sallow complexion marred the boy-next-door image. That and his eyes, which were dark and deep-sunken. And the fact that he lived in a pigsty. And that he was a coldblooded ravager of both living and dead flesh. Penny blurted an apology to the gaping, spluttering fat man where he fingered his milk-soaked jacket, looked up and saw Johnny closing with her, turned and fled for the swing doors. Johnny glanced around at the dozen or so nearby patrons in their booths, shrugged and pulled a wry face, as if to say: \u0027A weirdo... nothing to do with me, folks!\u0027 and calmly walked after her. But he was so intent on his act, and on following the girl into the night, that as he caught the still swinging door on the inswing and passed out through it he didn\u0027t see the two sharp-eyed men starting to their feet and coming after him. Outside Penny turned frantically this way and that. A thin mist lay on the tarmac of the sprawling, tree-bordered car park; the headlights of vehicles on the nearby trunk road blinded her where they went scything by; she couldn\u0027t see Harry anywhere. But Johnny Found could see Penny, and he was right behind her. She heard the crunch of gravel on the path leading back to the diner\u0027s door but didn\u0027t dare turn round. Of course, it could be anyone... but it could also be him. She felt rooted to the spot, all of her senses straining to identify what if anything was going on behind her, but utterly incapable of turning round and using the most obvious sense of all. And: God! she prayed. Please let it not be him! But it was. \u0027Penny?\u0027 he said, sly and yet somehow wonderingly. Now she turned, but with a sort of slow-motion jerkiness, like a puppet controlled by a spastic puppeteer. And there he was, bearing down on her, wearing a painted-on smile under eyes that were jet-black and flint-hard. Her heart very nearly stopped; she wanted to cry out but could only choke; she almost fainted into his arms. He caught her up, looked quickly all around and saw no one. And: \u0027Mine!\u0027 he gurgled, glaring into her half-glazed, sideways-sliding eyes behind their fluttering lids. \u0027All Johnny\u0027s now, Penny!\u0027 He wanted to ask her questions, right now, right here, but knew she wouldn\u0027t hear them. She was sliding away from him - away from the horror of him - into another world. Escaping into unconsciousness. That was a laugh. Why, no way she could escape from Johnny! Not even into death! Here, in front of the diner, was the car park; behind it was the lorry park, and dividing the two a belt of trees with paths between. Johnny picked Penny up, hurried with her into the cover of the trees, carried her through them light as a child. Behind him the E-Branch spotter and a Special Branch Detective Inspector erupted from the diner, glanced this way and that, saw him hurrying into darkness. They came running after him - and the Necroscope came loping after them. Harry had heard her cry out. Not aloud, for she\u0027d been too terrified to make any sound whatsoever. He\u0027d heard her in his mind. She was his thrall, and she\u0027d called to him. The call had come just as he was leaving the disabled police car, and at first he hadn\u0027t known what it was. But the vampire in him had known. He had seen Found carrying Penny into the screening trees, towards the lorry park, and he\u0027d seen the two men from the diner running after him. All of them were moving quickly, but not as quick as Harry. His lope was more wolf - more alien - than human, and he covered ground like the shadow of a fast-fleeting cloud under the moon. But as he entered the trees on a diagonal course calculated to intercept Johnny Found and his captive, he knew he\u0027d made a mistake. The trees and the shrubs beneath them were an ornamental screen designed to separate the two car parks, and as such they were protected by high wire-mesh fences. Precious seconds were lost as Harry came up against a fence, cursed and conjured a M\u0026ouml;bius door. In another moment he cleared the belt of trees and emerged on the perimeter of the hard-standing... ... Where a reeling, gagging figure collided with him and brought him to a halt! It was the esper. He knew Harry at once - sensed the awesome power of his metaphysical mind, that and the vampire in him - and threw up a hand to ward him off. The hand was bloody as the gaping wound in his cheek, where Johnny Found had torn a third of his face away. Harry held him upright, snarled at him, then thrust him toward one of the paths through the trees. \u0027Go and get help, quickly, before you bleed to death!\u0027 And as the esper choked out something inarticulate and staggered away, the Necroscope reached out with his vampire awareness to cover the entire park. He found three people at once: Penny, unconscious; Johnny Found, furious and bloody; and the policeman, dead where Pound\u0027s weapon had crashed through his ear to gouge into his brain. Harry pinpointed their location, conjured a door and ran through it ... and out again at the rear of the Frigis Express truck, where even now Johnny was slamming home the bolt on the roller door. At his feet, the policeman lay crumpled in a pool of his own blood, the left side of his face a raw red pulp. The necromancer had taken the policeman\u0027s gun; he sensed Harry\u0027s presence, whirled, aimed and fired! Harry was coming head-on; he felt a colossal blow as the bullet smashed into his collarbone on the right side, spun him round and hurled him down on the tarmac. Then, startled by the explosion and the flash, Johnny was fumbling the gun and dropping it. Stumbling across Harry, he kicked at him where he lay curled up in his pain; and running past the trailer toward his truck\u0027s cab, the madman raved, cursed and laughed all in one. The pain in Harry\u0027s shoulder was a living thing that took hold of his flesh with white-hot pincers and twisted it, causing him to moan his agony. And he thought: Bastard thing in my blood, my mind! Your fault, you berserk, headlong, idiot! Very well, you\u0027ve caused me to be hurt - now heal me! Found was in his cab, starting up and revving the engine. Air-brakes hissed and the reversing lights blazed crimson to match Harry\u0027s eyes or the jelly coagulating on the side of the dead policeman\u0027s head. Racked by pain, the Necroscope saw the huge bulk of the truck jerk, shudder and start backing up; in another moment a pair of its twinned wheels skidded viciously, then gripped and dragged the policeman\u0027s body under. Blood and guts gushed as the wheels lifted up barely an inch and the weight of the truck squeezed the corpse\u0027s innards like toothpaste from a tube. He\u0027s lucky he\u0027s dead! Harry dazedly, unthinkingly thought. It\u0027s something he wouldn\u0027t want to happen while he was still alive! They were instinctive thoughts, shocked out of him by the squelching eruption of brains and shit and flailing guts, but they were also deadspeak and the policeman heard him. Exhaust gases belched in Harry\u0027s face where he rolled desperately from the path of the reversing truck; the scarlet-dripping wheels missed him by inches; but through all the roar and the stink and the mess on the tarmac he heard and was riveted by the policeman\u0027s answer: But I did feel it! And God, it was like dying twice! And Harry\u0027s blood - even his blood - froze as he remembered who was driving the truck: Johnny Found, necromancer, whose actions his victims could feel even as the teeming dead had once felt Dragosani\u0027s! Then the air-brakes hissed again and the truck jerked to a halt, shuddered, started forward, turned and rumbled away towards the exit. Johnny Found was making his escape, with Penny aboard. But: No, you fucking don\u0027t! Harry fixed the truck\u0027s location in his mind, got to his knees, toppled through a M\u0026ouml;bius door and out again into the refrigerated trailer. It was dark in there but that was nothing to the Necroscope. He saw Penny, crawled to her, put his left hand under her head and drew it into his lap. She opened her eyes and looked into his where they blazed. \u0027Harry, I ... I didn\u0027t stay in the diner,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I know,\u0027 he growled. \u0027Did he hurt you?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 She shook her head, but weakly, \u0027I ... I think I just fainted.\u0027 Harry had no time to waste. Not now, for his blood was up. Literally! \u0027Cling to me,\u0027 he said. She did as she was told and Harry let the M\u0026ouml;bius equations roll across the computer screen of his mind. One moment later and Penny felt the awesome immensity of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, and in the next gravity returned where they fell prone on to Harry\u0027s bed in the house outside Bonnyrig. \u0027This time stay here!\u0027 he told her. And before she could even sit up he was gone again... In the operations room at E-Branch HQ, Millicent Cleary and the Minister Responsible sat with David Chung, who was also the Duty Officer, at one end of a large desk. The desk was equipped with a radio receiver, a radio telephone, standard telephones, blown-up Ordnance Survey maps of England under illuminated plastic, and a tray containing various small items of property belonging to Branch agents in the field. Spotlights in the ceiling were concentrated on the desk, turning it and its immediate surroundings into an island of light in the large room\u0027s comparative darkness. Millicent Cleary had just a moment ago received a brief telepathic message from Paxton at the house near Bonny-rig, stating that the assault team was in position. Keogh and the girl had been back, briefly, but Paxton was sure that the Necroscope was no longer in the house. Similarly Frank Robinson, the spotter who was Paxton\u0027s partner on the job, believed one of the two was still there; since there was no noticeable disturbance of the psychic \u0027ether\u0027, he would guess it was the girl. Keogh must have used the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum to drop her off at the house before moving on. If there\u0027d been any indication that the Necroscope himself was still in there, then the team would have maintained ESP silence. But since he wasn\u0027t... Paxton was eager to learn what was happening. Cleary passed the mind-message on and the Minister Responsible gave a snort. \u0027I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that you\u0027re right about Paxton,\u0027 he said. \u0027All of you. I get the feeling he won\u0027t be satisfied until he\u0027s running the world!\u0027 Cleary frowned and nodded. \u0027Ruining it, you mean!\u0027 she said, sourly; then quickly added, \u0027Er... sir! But we are right, and you don\u0027t have to be psychic to know it. He\u0027s a menace. We\u0027re lucky Ben Trask is up there keeping an eye on him. Do you want me to tell him anything?\u0027 The Minister looked at her - also at Chung where he busied himself touching and concentrating on his many contact sigils in their tray, fathoming the whereabouts, mood and feelings of the agents in the field - and mentally reviewed the situation: The telepath Trevor Jordan (who by all rights and natural laws should be a small heap of ashes in a vase), was on a night train heading for London via Darlington. Two E-Branch agents were on the same train and didn\u0027t anticipate too much trouble, even though it was a pretty safe bet that Jordan was a vampire. They were equipped with powerful automatic weapons, and one of them had a small but deadly crossbow. Another man was on his way to the mainline station in Darlington to give them a hand. He had a car, and in its boot a flamethrower. Penny Sanderson, also a resurrected vampire, was probably in Keogh\u0027s house outside Bonnyrig. The agents up there were (again probably) as strong a team of espers as E-Branch could throw together, which they would need to be if or when Keogh rejoined the party. For the odds were that sooner or later he\u0027d go back there for the girl. As for the Necroscope himself: he could be quite literally anywhere, but he was probably tracking Johnny Found. His reasons for doing so were all his own, but the Sanderson girl had been one of Pound\u0027s victims. Vengeance? Why not? It seemed the Wamphyri had always been big on revenge. So, if E-Branch moved now, two of the three targets were good as dead (the Minister recoiled for a moment, shocked by the necessarily cold efficiency of his own thoughts) but Keogh would still remain the big question mark, the pivot on which everything else turned. And it would be to everyone\u0027s advantage - literally everyone\u0027s, everywhere - if the Necroscope could be taken out at the same time as the others. \u0027Sir?\u0027 The girl was still waiting for an answer. The Minister opened his mouth to speak, but at that moment David Chung held up a hand and said, \u0027Hold it!\u0027 Cleary and the Minister looked at the locator; his other hand was resting on a Zippo cigarette lighter, the longtime property of Paul Garvey, a telepath working with the police out of Darlington. That hand was steady, the tips of Chung\u0027s long fingers motionless where they touched the cold metal. But the hand he held up was trembling, violently. Suddenly he snatched back his hand from the tray, stepped back a little from the desk. In another moment he\u0027d recovered himself, came forward again and said: \u0027Garvey has been hurt! I don\u0027t know how, but it\u0027s serious...\u0027 He closed his eyes and his hand hovered a moment over the maps beneath their clear plastic laminate. As the small Chinaman\u0027s hand came down to cover a section of the Al north of Newark, the Minister turned to Cleary. \u0027Can you get hold of Garvey?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve worked with him, lots.\u0027 She was breathless. \u0027Let me try.\u0027 She closed her eyes and concentrated on mental pictures of her fellow esper, and got him at once. Garvey was in fact sending at that very moment. But his signal and message were weak, garbled, distorted by his pain... which Cleary immediately became heir to! She gasped and staggered, and for a second lost him. Then she picked him up again, but barely in time before he blacked out and his telepathic thoughts flew into shards in her mind. The rush of psychic sendings had not been without images, however, which she\u0027d received even as he was going under. She turned to the Minister and her features were drawn, bloodless. \u0027Paul\u0027s face,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s ruined! His cheek is hanging in tatters. But there\u0027s a doctor with him. They\u0027re in some sort of ... motorway cafe? I think he was attacked by Johnny Found - but the Necroscope was also there. And a policeman is dead!\u0027 The Minister grabbed her wrist, steadied her. \u0027A policeman, dead? And Keogh was there? You\u0027re sure?\u0027 She nodded, gulped. \u0027It was in Paul\u0027s mind: a picture of a ... a bloody hole in a policeman\u0027s head. And another of Harry, with eyes like red lamps burning in his face!\u0027 Chung said, \u0027Garvey\u0027s somewhere here,\u0027 and he pointed at the map. \u0027On the Al.\u0027 The Minister took a deep breath, nodded and said, This is it: it\u0027s all coming to a head, right now. Keogh might have guessed it all along but by now he must know we\u0027re after him, definitely. So while all three of these... these creatures, are in different locations - from which two of them at least can\u0027t escape - now has to be the best time to move on them.\u0027 He turned to the girl. \u0027Miss Cleary, er, Millicent? Is Paxton still waiting? Get back on to him and tell him to move in now, at once. Then speak to Scanlon and tell him the same thing.\u0027 He turned to Chung. \u0027And David - \u0027 But the locator was already busy on the radio, speaking to people in Darlington. Meanwhile: By the time Johnny Pound\u0027s thundering Frigis Express truck took the curves on the roundabout at the junction of the Al and A46 outside Newark, he was much calmer and showing a lot of skill and driving discipline. Had there been a police patrol car stationed at the roundabout, its officers probably wouldn\u0027t look twice at him. There was no patrol car, however. Just Harry Keogh. Using Pound\u0027s knife, the Necroscope had followed the truck\u0027s progress in a series of short M\u0026ouml;bius jumps, waiting for his quarry to slow down a little before attempting what would have to be an extremely accurate jump on to a moving object - directly into Pound\u0027s cab! Also, it must be accomplished as smoothly as possible, so as not to jar Harry\u0027s badly shattered collarbone. The pain of that alone would have left any other man writhing on his back or entirely unconscious. But Harry wasn\u0027t any other man. Indeed, with every passing moment he was a little less a man and more a monster, albeit one with a human soul. And so, as the necromancer straightened up his truck off the roundabout and back on to the Al, Harry emerged from the eternal darkness of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum into the empty seat on his left. At first Found didn\u0027t see him, or if he did he considered him a shadow in the corner of his eye. And Harry sat still and quiet in the very corner of the cab, pressed against the door with his face and upper body turned towards the driver. He kept his eyes three-quarters shuttered, studying Johnny\u0027s face, which had seemed previously scarcely to match up with any of the descriptions given him by the girls, but which he now saw to be very terrible indeed. As for Johnny himself: he knew that it was all over. Too many people had seen him tonight, in the diner, the car park, with or close to the girl. Indeed, it seemed to him that he\u0027d been set up. They had traced him, then trapped him with a girl who was the image of one of his victims. And he had fallen for it. Well, two of the bastards at least had paid for it, and the girl would pay, too, when he climbed into the trailer with her, chopped a passage through the orbit of her left eye and fucked her brain! These were his thoughts, which Harry, looking directly at him, read as clearly as - more clearly than - the pages of a book. And if before there had been any doubt at all in the Necroscope\u0027s mind that his intended course of action was the right one, these were also the thoughts which dispelled it. Now, as Johnny dwelled more intimately on the pleasures he intended taking with or from the girl, Harry very quietly spoke up and said: \u0027None of those things will happen, for the girl isn\u0027t in the trailer. I freed her. As I intend freeing all of the dead. From their terror, Johnny. From your tyranny.\u0027 Pound\u0027s jaw had fallen open at the first word. There was a trickle of saliva, slime, froth, in the left-hand corner of his mouth, which now ran down under his lip and into the dimple of his chin. He said \u0027Who - ?\u0027 and his coal-black eyes slowly slid to the left in their deep sockets... then stood out like inkblots on the gaunt parchment which until a moment ago had been the flushed, bloated flesh of his face. \u0027You\u0027re a goner, Johnny,\u0027 Harry told him, and opened his furnace eyes to reflect ruddily on the other\u0027s paralysed, astonished features. But Pound\u0027s paralysis was short-lived, and the rest of it - his almost immediate response - was all instinct, so that not even the Necroscope could have seen it coming. \u0027What?\u0027 he gurgled, taking his left hand from the wheel and reaching up behind his head for a meat-hook where it hung from the cab\u0027s frame. \u0027A goner? Well, one of us is, that\u0027s for sure!\u0027 Harry\u0027s plan had been simple: as Found attacked him, he\u0027d conjure a M\u0026ouml;bius door and wrestle him through it. But it was difficult enough just to take hold of a man in the cab of a truck, let alone when he was wielding a meat-hook. Johnny had seen the huge bloodstain on Harry\u0027s jacket and recognized him as the one he\u0027d shot back in the diner\u0027s vehicle park. How he came to be in the cab was something else, but he surely wouldn\u0027t be much good for anything with a gaping hole in his shoulder. And even less good when Johnny was finished with him. \u0027Whoever you are,\u0027 he grunted, swinging the hook, \u0027you\u0027re dead fucking meat!\u0027 The blow was awkward and left-handed, but still Harry couldn\u0027t avoid it. He ducked down a little and the question mark of shining metal passed over his right shoulder, swooped down on him and caught in the hole which the bullet had torn out of his back. He gasped his renewed agony as Found yanked him towards him and glared into his face. Then - - Using Harry as a counterweight, the necromancer lifted his left leg, reached it across Harry\u0027s knees and kicked open the cab door. And as the truck careened down the twin lanes he kicked again, this time at Harry himself, and simultaneously released his hold on the meat-hook. Sliding free of his seat into the rush of night air, the Necroscope made a desperate grab for the wildly swinging door. Luckily the window was down; as he looped his arms through the frame, so his feet slammed down on to the running board. Johnny could no longer reach him without letting go of the wheel, but he could at least try to shake him loose. Heedless of other vehicles, the maniac threw his huge truck this way and that across the lanes, and Harry hung on like grim death until the thought suddenly occurred. Why not a big door? Why not the biggest bloody door you could ever imagine? On his left and almost directly under his skidding, skittering feet, a car was sideswiped and sent spinning, crashing through the roadside barrier in a shriek of ruptured metal. It smashed into the embankment nose first and exploded like a bomb. But the big truck rushed on and left people frying and dying in its wake, and in the cab Johnny fuelled himself with their pain and knew that even dead they would hear his crazy laughter. Enough! Harry thought, and conjured his giant door - on the road directly in front of the truck. The rumble and thunder and rocking violence of the vehicle died away in a moment as it plunged through the M\u0026ouml;bius door into darkness absolute; likewise the mad laughter of Johnny Found, shut off as he delivered a single gonging thought into the aweseome M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum: WHAT? What indeed? The beam of his headlights went on for ever, cutting a tunnel through infinity. But apart from the headlight beams and the truck where its mass surrounded him, there was nothing whatsoever. No road, no sound, no sensation of motion, nothing. WHAAAAT!? Johnny screamed again, deafeningly, in both his and the Necroscope\u0027s mind. But: No good shouting now, Johnny, Harry told him, hanging on the door and guiding the truck, aiming it like a missile to its final destination. Like I said, you\u0027re a goner. And we\u0027re very nearly there. Welcome to hell! Johnny let go of the wheel and sprawled across the wide seat, reaching for the Necroscope where he clung to the door of the cab. But too late; they were there; Harry conjured another door in front of the truck and pushed himself free, slowing his motion to an abrupt halt. And the truck went rushing on - - Out of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum to emerge inches over the surface of a narrow road. It crashed down, bounced, rocked and roared; and as its free-spinning tyres found purchase on the tarmac, so it rocketed forward. Johnny screamed as he saw the sharp bend coming up where the road skirted a long, high wall of ivy-clad stone. He made a desperate grab for the steering wheel, but the truck had already mounted the kerb. It shot across a narrow strip of grass, tore through a mass of night-black shrubbery, slammed into the wall... and stopped. Stopped dead. ... But not Johnny! As the truck and its trailer concertinaed - as the wall cracked and sent stone debris flying - as massive petrol tanks shattered and showered fuel on to hot, tortured metal, turning the truck into a blazing inferno - so Johnny was ripped out of his driver\u0027s seat and hurled through the windscreen. Bones in his left arm and shoulder broke where, pinwheeling, he hit the top of the wall before crushing down on to something hard far on the other side. There was pain, more pain than he\u0027d ever known; and then, apart from flickering firelight from beyond the wall, and a booming, whooshing explosion as the emergency tank blew, there was a deafening silence. The silence of mental concentration, of knowing even through waves of agony that someone - several pitiless someones - were watching him. He cranked his neck up an inch from where sharp gravel chips stuck to the tattered mess of his face, and saw Harry Keogh standing there, looking down on him. And behind the red-eyed Necroscope there were other - people? Things, anyway - which Johnny knew should never be. They came (crawled, staggered, crumbled) forward, and one of them was or had once been a girl. Johnny backed off, pushing with his raw hands, sliding on his belly and his knees, skidding in the bloodied gravel until he collided with something hard, which brought him up short. He somehow turned his head and looked back, and saw what had stopped him: a headstone. \u0027A ... a ... fucking graveyard!\u0027 he gasped. And Harry Keogh said, \u0027End of the road, Johnny.\u0027 Pamela Trotter said, You kept your promise, Harry. And he nodded. And Johnny Found, Necromancer, knew what had passed between them. \u0027No!\u0027 he gasped. Then screamed: \u0027Noooooooo!\u0027 He would get to his feet. Even broken, shattered, cut to ribbons, he would flee from the hell of it. But Pamela\u0027s dead friends fell or flopped on him and bore him down, and a hand that shed rotting flesh and maggots stoppered his mouth. Then she came to him and searched among his rags, until she found his new knife. And close up like that - badly gone into corruption though she was, even with the flesh beginning to slough from her face - still he knew her. You remember that good time we had? she said. You didn\u0027t even say thanks, Johnny, and you didn\u0027t leave me anything to remember you by. Well, now I think it\u0027s time I had me a small memento. Or even a big one, eh? Something I can take back down into the earth with me, right? She showed him his own knife and smiled at him, and her teeth were long where the blackened gums had shrivelled back from them. Harry turned away and shut out the sight; shut out Pound\u0027s silent, frenzied shrieking, too, from his mind. But to Pamela he said, \u0027Make sure you kill him.\u0027 Except: Too late! She was weeping her frustration. Or rather, too soon! Damn the bastard, Harry, but he\u0027s already died on me! Harry sighed his relief and thought, Just as well. She heard him and a moment later agreed: Yes, I suppose it is. Shit, I didn\u0027t want to dirty my hands on this filth anyway! And now Pound\u0027s deadspeak reached out to both of them, to Harry and to Pamela. What... is this? Where... am I? Who... is it out there? Neither one of them answered him, but the sheer weight of Harry\u0027s presence impressed itself on Pound\u0027s mind like a light shining in through the stretched membrane of shuttered eyelids. He knew that Harry was there, and that he was special. It\u0027s you, right? he said. The guy with the dark glasses, with some kind of magic. You brought me here with your magic, right? Harry knew that Pamela would probably never speak to Johnny Found, neither Pamela nor any other of the outraged Great Majority. Instead of taunting the necromancer, they\u0027d merely shun him, lock him up or out, like a leper. So maybe Harry shouldn\u0027t speak to him either but simply go away. And perhaps that would be the most merciful thing to do. Except... Harry had a less than merciful thing inside him, which now caused him to speak up. You had the same magic, Johnny, he said. Or you could have had. You could speak to the dead - could have trained yourself, as I did, to converse with them and befriend them - but no, you chose to torture them instead. Found was quick to catch on. So now I\u0027m one of them, right? I\u0027m dead and you did it to me. But just answer me this: why? Harry could have explained: that he\u0027d needed to focus his Wamphyri passions on something - to have something to let them loose on - rather than people who were previously his friends; which was to say E-Branch and the world in general. He could have explained, but didn\u0027t. For his vampire wouldn\u0027t let him. Found had been the cold, cruel, uncaring one in life; death should be a cold, cruel place, too. And just as uncaring. An eye for an eye. Why did I kill you? Harry shrugged, began to turn away. Hey, fuckface! Found shouted after him, defiant, furious even in death. That doesn\u0027t cut it. You had your reasons, sure enough. Because of the dead? Shit! Who gives a fuck for the dead? So come on, tell me ... why? And so - coldly, cruelly and uncaringly - Harry told him. You\u0027re right, he said. No one gives a fuck for the dead. And you, Johnny, you\u0027re dead. You want to know why? And again he shrugged. Well, why the fuck not?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-20.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
