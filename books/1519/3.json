Harry stayed with her for a further half-hour: calming, soothing, doing what he could, and in so doing managing to get a few more personal details out of her, enough to give the police something to go on, anyway. But when it was time to go she wouldn\u0027t let him without his promise that he\u0027d see her again. She hadn\u0027t been there long, but already Penny had discovered that death was a lonely place. The Necroscope was jaded - or thought he was - by life, death, everything. He believed he needed motivation. Before leaving her he asked if she\u0027d mind if he looked at her. She told him that if it were anyone else she couldn\u0027t care less, because she wouldn\u0027t even know they were looking, not any longer. But with Harry she would know, because he was the Necroscope. She was just a shy kid. \u0027Hey!\u0027 he protested, but gently, \u0027I\u0027m no voyeur!\u0027 It wasn\u0027t... if he hadn\u0027t... if I was unmarked, then I don\u0027t think I\u0027d mind, she said. \u0027Penny, you\u0027re lovely,\u0027 Harry told her. \u0027And me? After all\u0027s said and done, I\u0027m only human. But believe me I\u0027m not putting you down when I tell you that right now I\u0027m not interested in that side of things. It\u0027s because you\u0027re marked that I want to see you. I need to feel angry. And now that I know you, I know that to see what he did would make me feel angry.\u0027 Then I\u0027ll just have to pretend you\u0027re my doctor, she said. Harry very gently took the rubber sheet off her pale, young body, looked at her, and tremblingly put the sheet back again. Is it bad? She fought down a sob. It\u0027s such a shame. Mum always said I could be a model. \u0027So you could,\u0027 he told her. \u0027You were very beautiful.\u0027 But not now? And though she kept from actually sobbing, he could feel her despair brimming over. But in a little while she said: Harry? Did it make you angry? He felt a growl rising in his throat, suppressed it, and before he left her said, \u0027Oh yes. Yes, it did.\u0027 Darcy Clarke was still outside the door with the plain-clothes man. Looking washed out, Harry joined them and closed the door after him. \u0027I\u0027ve left the sheet off her face,\u0027 he said. And then, speaking specifically to - and glaring at - the officer: \u0027Don\u0027t cover her face!\u0027 The other raised an indifferent eyebrow and shrugged. \u0027Who, me?\u0027 he said, his accent nasal, Glaswegian, less than sympathetic. \u0027Ah had nothing tae do wi\u0027 it, Chief. It\u0027s just that when they\u0027re dead \u0027uns, people usually cover them up!\u0027 Harry turned swiftly towards him, eyes widening and nostrils flaring in his pale, grimacing face, and Darcy Clarke\u0027s instinct took over. The Necroscope was suddenly dangerous and Clarke\u0027s weird talent knew it. There was a terrible anger in him, which he needed to take out on someone. But Clarke knew that it wasn\u0027t directed at him, wasn\u0027t directed at anyone but simply required an outlet. Quickly forcing himself between Harry and the special-duty officer, he grabbed the Necroscope\u0027s arms. \u0027It\u0027s OK, Harry,\u0027 he said, urgently. \u0027It\u0027s OK. It\u0027s just that these people see things like this all the time. It doesn\u0027t affect them so much. They get used to it.\u0027 Harry got a grip of himself, but not without an effort of will. He looked at Clarke and growled, They don\u0027t see things like that all the time! No one\u0027s ever going to \"get used\" to the idea that someone - something - could do that to a girl!\u0027 And then, seeing Clarke\u0027s bewildered expression: \u0027I\u0027ll explain later.\u0027 He turned his gaze across Clarke\u0027s shoulder, and in a tone more nearly civil now - more civilized? - asked the officer, \u0027Do you have a notebook?\u0027 Mystified - not knowing what was going on, just trying to do his job - the other said, \u0027Aye,\u0027 and groped in his pocket. He scribbled quickly as Harry fired Penny\u0027s name, address and family details at him. Following which, and looking even more mystified: \u0027You\u0027re sure about these details, sir?\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Just be sure to pass on what I said, right? I don\u0027t want anyone to cover her face over. Penny always hated having her face covered.\u0027 \u0027You knew the young lady, then?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But I know her now.\u0027 They left the officer muttering into his walkie-talkie and scratching his head, and went up into the courtyard and the fresh air. As they moved into sunlight Harry put on his dark glasses and turned up the collar of his coat. And Clarke said to him: \u0027You got something else, right?\u0027 Harry nodded, but in the next moment: \u0027Never mind what I got - what have you got? Do you have any idea what you\u0027re dealing with?\u0027 Clarke threw up his hands. \u0027Only that he\u0027s a serial killer, and that he\u0027s weird.\u0027 \u0027But you know what he does?\u0027 Clarke nodded. \u0027Yes. We know it\u0027s sexual. A sort of sex, anyway. A sick sort of sex.\u0027 \u0027Sicker than you think.\u0027 Harry shivered. \u0027Dragosani\u0027s kind of sickness.\u0027 That pulled Clarke up short. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027A necromancer,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027A murderer, and a necromancer. And in a way worse than Dragosani, because this one\u0027s a necrophiliac, too!\u0027 Clarke somehow succeeded in grimacing and looking blank at the same time. Then: \u0027Refresh my mind,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know I should be getting something, but I\u0027m not.\u0027 Harry thought about it for a few moments before answering, but in the end there was no way to tell it other than the way it was. \u0027Dragosani tore open the bodies of dead men for information,\u0027 he finally said. \u0027That was his \"talent\", just like you have yours and I have mine. Necromancy. It was his job when he worked for Gregor Borowitz and Soviet E-Branch at the Chateau Bronnitsy: to \"examine\" the corpses of his country\u0027s enemies. He could read their passions in the mucus of their eyes, tear the truths of their lives right out of their steaming tripes, tune in on the whispering of their stiffening brains and sniff their smallest secrets in the gases of their swollen guts!\u0027 Clarke held up a hand in protest. \u0027Christ, Harry - I know all that!\u0027 The Necroscope nodded. \u0027But you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be dead, and that\u0027s why you\u0027re not getting it. It\u0027s because you can\u0027t imagine what I\u0027m talking about. You know what I do and accept it because you know it for a fact, but deep inside yourself you still think it\u0027s just too way out to think about. So you don\u0027t. And I don\u0027t blame you. Now listen. \u0027I know I always protested I was different from Dragosani, but in certain ways he and I were alike. Even now I don\u0027t like admitting it, but it\u0027s true. I mean, you know what the bastard did to Keenan Gormley - the mess he made of him - but only I know what Gormley thought about it!\u0027 And now Clarke got it. He snatched air in a great gasp and felt the short hairs stiffen at the back of his neck as an irrepressible shudder wracked his body. And: \u0027Jesus, you\u0027re right!\u0027 he breathed. \u0027I just don\u0027t think about it - because I don\u0027t want to think about it! But in fact Keenan knew! He felt everything Dragosani did to him!\u0027 \u0027Right,\u0027 Harry was relentless. \u0027Torture is the necromancer\u0027s principal tool. The dead feel the necromancer working on them just like they hear me talking to them. Except unlike the living, there\u0027s nothing they can do about it, not even scream. Not and be heard, anyway. And Penny Sanderson?\u0027 Clarke went pale in a moment. \u0027She could feel - ?\u0027 \u0027Everything,\u0027 Harry growled. \u0027And that bastard, whoever he is, knew it! So you see while rape is one thing, and bad enough when it\u0027s done to the living, and while necrophilia is something else, an outrage carried out upon the unfeeling dead, what he does hits new lows. He tortures his victims alive, then tortures them dead - and he knows while he\u0027s doing it that they can feel it! He uses a knife with a curved blade, like a tool for scooping earth when you\u0027re planting bulbs. It\u0027s razor-sharp and... and he doesn\u0027t use it for scooping earth.\u0027 It had been Clarke\u0027s intention to stop at the guardroom and speak to the policemen there. But now, pale as a ghost, he reeled to the castle\u0027s low wall. Clutching its masonry for support, he gulped at the gusting air and fought down the bile he felt rising from the churning of his guts. And: \u0027Jesus, Jesus!\u0027 he choked. For he could see it all now and there was nothing he could do to cleanse the picture from his mind\u0027s eye. Weird sex? God, what an understatement! Harry had followed Clarke to the wall. The head of E-Branch looked at him sideways from a watery eye. \u0027He ... he digs holes in those poor kids, then makes love to the holes!\u0027 \u0027Love?\u0027 the Necroscope hissed. \u0027His flesh ruts in blood like a pig\u0027s snout ruts in soil, Darcy! Except the soil can\u0027t feel! Didn\u0027t the police tell you where he leaves his semen?\u0027 Clarke\u0027s eyes were swimming and his brow feverish, but he felt his nausea being replaced by a cold loathing almost as strong as the Necroscope\u0027s own. No, the police hadn\u0027t told him that, but now he knew. He looked out over the blurred city and asked: \u0027How do you know he knows they feel it?\u0027 \u0027Because he talks to them while he\u0027s doing it,\u0027 Harry told him, mercilessly. \u0027And when they cry out in their agony and beg him to stop, he hears them. And he laughs!\u0027 Clarke thought: Christ, I shouldn\u0027t have asked! And you - you bastard, Harry Keogh - you shouldn\u0027t have told me! With fury in his eyes, he turned to face the Necroscope... and faced thin air. A wind blew up the esplanade and tourists leaned into it, balancing themselves. Overhead, seagulls cried where they spiralled on a rising thermal. But Harry was no longer there... Later, with Clarke\u0027s help, Harry fixed it that Penny Sanderson would be cremated. Her parents wanted it, and it wouldn\u0027t hurt them that it was all a show. They wouldn\u0027t know it anyway: that Penny was already ashes when their tears fell on her empty box, before it slid away from them behind swishing curtains and became wood smoke. Clarke hadn\u0027t wanted to do it but he owed Harry. For a good many things. And he wanted very badly to catch the maniac who had done this thing to Penny and too many other innocents. Harry had told him: \u0027If I have her ashes - her pure ashes, not damaged or spoiled by burned linen or charcoal - then I\u0027ll be able to talk to her any time I want to. And maybe she\u0027ll remember something important.\u0027 It had seemed logical at the time (if anything about the Necroscope could ever seem logical) and so Clarke had pulled strings. As the head of E-Branch he had that sort of power. But if he\u0027d known the whole story of what had happened at the castle of Janos Ferenczy, in Transylvania, maybe he would have thought twice about it. And then not done it at all. He certainly wouldn\u0027t have gone along with it if Zek Föener had stood firm on her first... accusation? Or if not an accusation, a premonition at least. Zek was a telepath and as loyal to the Necroscope as they came. In the Greek islands at the end of the Ferenczy business, she\u0027d had occasion to try and contact Harry with her mind, during the course of which something had shocked her rigid. But it had been a while before she could tell Clarke what it was. They had been on the island of Rhodes at the time, less than a month ago, and their conversation was still fresh in his mind. \u0027What is it, Zek?\u0027 he\u0027d said to her, when he could talk to her in private. \u0027I saw that change come over your face when you contacted Harry. Is he in some sort of trouble?\u0027 \u0027No - yes - I don\u0027t know!\u0027 she\u0027d answered, fear and frustration audible in her every word, visible in her every move. Then she\u0027d looked at him and it was that same, strange, disbelieving look he\u0027d seen when she tried to contact Harry: as if she gazed on alien things, in a distant world beyond the times and places we know. And he remembered that indeed she had once been in just such a world, with Harry Keogh. A world of vampires! \u0027Zek,\u0027 he\u0027d said then, \u0027if there\u0027s something I should know about Harry, it\u0027s only fair that - \u0027 \u0027 - Only fair to who?\u0027 She had cut him off. To whom? To ... what? And is it fair to him?\u0027 At which Clarke had felt an icy chill in his blood. And: \u0027I think you\u0027d better explain,\u0027 he\u0027d said. \u0027I can\u0027t explain!\u0027 she\u0027d snapped at him. \u0027Or maybe I can.\u0027 And then the empty expression in her beautiful eyes had filled itself in a little, and her tone had become more reasonable, even pleading. \u0027It\u0027s just that every other mind I\u0027ve touched in the last few days has seemed to be one of them! So maybe I\u0027ve started to find them where... where there aren\u0027t any? Where they can\u0027t possibly be?\u0027 And then he\u0027d known for certain what she was trying to tell him. \u0027You mean that when you contacted Harry, you sensed - ?\u0027 \u0027Yes - yes!\u0027 she\u0027d snapped again. \u0027But I could be mistaken. I mean, isn\u0027t that what he\u0027s doing at this very moment, going up against them? He\u0027s close to vampires right now, even as we talk. It could be one of them I sensed. God, it has to be one of them...\u0027 End of conversation, but it hadn\u0027t been out of Clarke\u0027s mind from that day to this. When it was time to leave the islands and come home again, he had asked Zek if she\u0027d like to visit England, as a guest of E-Branch. Her answer had been more or less what he expected: \u0027You\u0027re not fooling anyone, Darcy. And anyway I don\u0027t like the idea that you would want to fool me, not after all of this. So I\u0027ll tell you straight out: I detest the E-Branches, whether they\u0027re Russian, British, whoever they belong to! No, not the espers themselves but the way they\u0027re used, the fact that they need to be used at all. As for Harry: I won\u0027t go against the Necroscope.\u0027 And she\u0027d given her head a very definite shake. \u0027We were on different sides once before, Harry and me, and he gave me some good advice. \"Never again go up against me or mine,\" he said, and I never will. I\u0027ve seen inside his mind, Darcy, and I know that when someone like Harry says something like that to you, you\u0027d better listen to him. So if there are... problems, well, they\u0027re your problems, not mine.\u0027 It had been the kind of answer to make him worry all the more. Back in London after the Greek expedition, at E-Branch HQ, a mass of work had built up. During the first few days back at his desk Clarke had cleared or at least begun to clear quite a lot of it, and had also managed to clear his mind of much of the horror of the Ferenczy job. But nightmares kept him awake most nights. One in particular was very bad and very persistent. This was the essence of it: they (Clarke, Zek, Jazz Simmons, Ben Trask, Manolis Papastamos: most of the Greek team, with the important exception of Harry Keogh) were in a boat that lolled gently on an absolutely flat ocean. It was so blue, that sea, that it could only be the Aegean. A small, stark, sloping island of rock floating on the blue made a gold-rimmed, black silhouette against the blinding refraction of a half-sun where it prepared to dip down beyond the slanting rock of the island into a short-lived twilight. The serenity of the scene was immaculately structured, vivid, real, with nothing in it to hint that it was prelude to nightmare. But since the thing was recurrent - indeed a nightly event - Clarke always knew what was coming and where to look for the start of it. He would look at Zek, gorgeous in a swimsuit that left little to the imagination, stretched out along a narrow sunbathing platform attached to the upper strakes at the stern. She lay on her stomach, her face turned sideways, with one hand dangling in the water. And the sea so calm that her fingers made ripples. But then... She glanced sharply at her hand in the water, snatched it out and stared at it, gave a cry of disgust and tumbled herself inboard! Her hand was red, bleeding! No, not bleeding, but bloody - as if it had been dipped in someone else\u0027s blood! By which time the entire crew had seen that the sea itself was sullied by a great crimson swath, an elongated splotch like an oilslick (a bloodslick?) which had drifted to surround the boat with its thick, red ribbons. But drifted from where? They looked out across the sea, followed the swath to its source. Previously unnoticed, the warty, barnacled prow of a sunken vessel stuck up in grotesque salute from the water only fifty yards away. Its figurehead was a hideous but recognizable face, mouth gaping, hugely disproportionate fangs jutting, and blood spewing in an unending torrent from the silently shrieking mouth! And the vessel\u0027s name, as she gurgled down out of sight into her own blood? Clarke didn\u0027t need to read all of those black letters daubed on her scabby hull as they disappeared, in reverse order, one by one into the crimson ocean: O... R... C... E... N. No, for he already knew that this was the plagueship Necroscope, out of Edinburgh, contaminated in strange ports of call and doomed for ever to oceans of gore! Or until, like now, she sank. Aghast, he watched her go down, then jumped to his feet as Papastamos cursed and leaped to snatch up a speargun. The swath of blood beside the boat was bubbling, fuming, as some nameless thing drifted to the surface. A body, naked, face-down, floated up and lolled like some weird jellyfish, dangling its tentacle arms and legs. And feeble as a jellyfish, it tried to swim! Then Papastamos was at the side of the boat, aiming his gun, and Clarke was starting forward, screaming, \u0027No!\u0027... but too late! The steel spear hissed through the air and thwacked into the lone survivor\u0027s back, and he jerked in the water and rolled over. And his face was the face on the figurehead, and his scarlet eyes glared and his scarlet mouth belched blood as he sank down out of sight for the last time... Which was when Clarke would start awake. He started now as his telephone chirruped, then sighed his relief that his morbid chain of thoughts had been broken. He let the telephone chirp away to itself for a few moments, and considered his nightmare in the light of cold logic. Clarke was no oneiromancer but the dream\u0027s interpretation seemed simple enough. Zek, to her own dismay, had pointed the finger of suspicion at Harry. As for the Aegean backdrop and the blood: these were hardly inappropriate in the circumstances and considering the occurrences of the recent past. And the dream\u0027s conclusion? Papastamos had put an end to the horror but that wasn\u0027t significant, hadn\u0027t been the point of it. It didn\u0027t have to be Papastamos but could have been any one of them - except Clarke himself. That had been the point of it: that Darcy Clarke himself hadn\u0027t done it and didn\u0027t want it to happen. In fact he had tried to stop it. Just like, right now, he was less than eager to start anything... The telephone was starting its fifth ring when he reached for it, but the relief he\u0027d felt at the first chirrup was shortlived: his nightmare was right there on the other end of the wire. \u0027Darcy?\u0027 The Necroscope\u0027s voice was calm, collected, about as detached as Clarke had ever heard it. \u0027Harry?\u0027 Clarke pressed a button on his desk, ensuring the conversation would be recorded, and another which alerted the switchboard to start a trace. \u0027I\u0027d thought I might have heard from you before now.\u0027 \u0027Oh, why?\u0027 Harry asked good questions, and this one stopped Clarke dead. For after all, E-Branch didn\u0027t own Harry Keogh. \u0027Why - \u0027 he thought quickly, \u0027 - because of your interest in the serial killer case! I mean, it\u0027s been ten days since we met in Edinburgh; we\u0027ve spoken only once since then. I suppose I\u0027d been hoping you\u0027d come up with something pretty quick.\u0027 \u0027And your people?\u0027 Harry returned. \u0027Your espers: have they come up with anything? Your telepaths and hunch-men, spotters, precogs and locators? Have the police come up with anything? No, they haven\u0027t, because if they had you wouldn\u0027t be asking me. Hey, I\u0027m only one man, Darcy, and you have a whole gang!\u0027 Clarke decided to play the other at his own circuitous game. \u0027OK, so tell me, to what do I owe the pleasure, Harry? I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s a social call.\u0027 The Necroscope\u0027s chuckle - normal, however dry -brought a little more relief with it. \u0027You make a good sparring partner,\u0027 he said. \u0027Except you cry uncle too quick.\u0027 And before Clarke could counter, he went on: \u0027I need some information, Darcy, that\u0027s why I\u0027m calling.\u0027 Who am I talking to? Clarke wondered. What am I talking to? God, if only I could be sure it was you, Harry! I mean, all you, just you. But I can\u0027t be sure, and if it\u0027s not all you... then sooner or later it will be my job to do something about it. Which, of course, was what his nightmare was all about. But out loud he only said, \u0027Information? How can I help you?\u0027 Two things,\u0027 Harry told him. The first one\u0027s a big one: details of the other murdered girls. Oh, I know I could get them for myself; I have friends in the right places, right? But this time I\u0027d prefer not to put the teeming dead to the trouble.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Clarke was curious. Suddenly Harry sounded cagey. Put the Great Majority to the trouble? But the dead would do anything for the Necroscope - even rise from their graves! \u0027We\u0027ve asked enough of the dead,\u0027 Harry tried to explain himself, almost as if he\u0027d read Clarke\u0027s mind. \u0027Now it\u0027s time we did them a few favours.\u0027 Still puzzled, Clarke said, \u0027Give me half an hour and I\u0027ll duplicate everything we have for you. I can mail it or ... but no, that would be silly. You can simply pick it up yourself, right here.\u0027 Again Harry\u0027s chuckle. \u0027You mean via the Möbius Continuum? What, and set off all those alarms again?\u0027 He stopped chuckling. \u0027No, mail it,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know I\u0027m not struck on that place of yours. You espers give me the shivers!\u0027 Clarke laughed out loud. It was forced laughter but he hoped the other wouldn\u0027t notice. \u0027And what\u0027s the other thing I can do for you, Harry?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s easy,\u0027 said the Necroscope. \u0027You can tell me about Paxton.\u0027 It was delivered like a bolt out of the blue, and quite deliberately. \u0027Pax - ?\u0027 The smile slid from Clarke\u0027s face, was replaced by a frown. Paxton? What about Paxton? He didn\u0027t know anything about him - only that he\u0027d done a few months\u0027 probation as an esper, a telepath, and that the Minister Responsible had found cause to reject him: something about a couple of small kinks in his past record, apparently. \u0027Yes, Paxton,\u0027 Harry said again. \u0027Geoffrey Paxton? He\u0027s one of yours, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 There was an edge to his voice now, an almost mechanical precision which was cold and controlled. Like a computer waiting for some vital item of information before it could begin its calculations. \u0027Was,\u0027 Clarke finally answered. \u0027Was going to be one of ours, yes. But it seems he had a couple of black marks against him and so missed the boat. How do you know about him, anyway? Or more to the point, what do you know about him?\u0027 \u0027Darcy.\u0027 The edge on Harry\u0027s voice had sharpened. It wasn\u0027t menacing - there was no threat in it, no way - but still Clarke could sense its warning. \u0027We\u0027ve been friends, of sorts, for a long time. I\u0027ve stuck my neck out for you. You\u0027ve stuck yours out for me. I\u0027d hate to think you were shafting me now.\u0027 \u0027Shafting you?\u0027 Clarke\u0027s answer was instinctive, natural, even mildly affronted; with every right, for he wasn\u0027t hiding anything or shafting anyone. \u0027I don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re talking about! It\u0027s like I said: Geoffrey Paxton is a middling telepath, but developing rapidly. Or he was. Then we lost him. Our Minister found something he didn\u0027t like and Paxton was out. Without us he won\u0027t ever be able to develop to his full potential. We\u0027ll give him the onceover now and then, just to make sure he\u0027s not using what he has to take too much of an advantage on society, but apart from that - \u0027 \u0027But he\u0027s already taking advantage,\u0027 the Necroscope, plainly angry now, cut in. \u0027Or trying to - and of me! He\u0027s on my back, Darcy, and he sticks like glue. He tries to get into my mind, but so far I\u0027ve kept him out. Only that takes effort, gets tiring, and I\u0027m getting pissed off exerting so much effort on something like this! On some sneaking little bastard who\u0027s doing someone else\u0027s dirty work!\u0027 For a moment Clarke\u0027s mind was full of confusion, but he knew that to hesitate would only make him look suspect. \u0027What do you want me to do?\u0027 he said. \u0027Find out who\u0027s running him, of course!\u0027 Harry snapped. \u0027And why.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do what I can.\u0027 \u0027Do better than that,\u0027 Harry came back like a shot. \u0027Or I\u0027ll have to do it myself.\u0027 Why haven\u0027t you already? Clarke wondered. Are you afraid of Paxton, Harry? And if so, why? \u0027I\u0027ve told you he isn\u0027t one of mine,\u0027 he said out loud. \u0027Now that\u0027s the truth, so you can\u0027t threaten me through him. But like I said, I\u0027ll do what I can.\u0027 There was a pause. Then: \u0027And you\u0027ll get the details of those girls to me?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a promise.\u0027 \u0027OK.\u0027 The Necroscope\u0027s voice had slackened a little, lost some of its tension. \u0027I ... I didn\u0027t mean to come on so strong, Darcy.\u0027 Clarke\u0027s heart at once went out to him. \u0027Harry, I think you\u0027ve a lot on your mind. Maybe we can speak sometime - in person, I mean? What I\u0027m saying is, don\u0027t be afraid to come to me.\u0027 \u0027Afraid?\u0027 It had been the wrong word. \u0027Apprehensive, then. I mean, don\u0027t worry that there might be something you can\u0027t tell me or we can\u0027t talk about. There isn\u0027t anything you can\u0027t tell me, Harry.\u0027 Again that long, perhaps indicative pause. Then: \u0027But right now I don\u0027t have anything to tell you, Darcy. However, I\u0027ll get back to you if I ever do.\u0027 \u0027Is that a promise?\u0027 \u0027Yes, that\u0027s a promise too. And Darcy - thanks.\u0027 Clarke sat and thought about it for long minutes. And while he sat there behind his desk, drumming his fingers in a continuous, monotonous tattoo, so he became aware of the first small warning bells growing to an insistent clamour at the back of his mind. Harry Keogh had required him to find out who was running Paxton. But who could be running him if not E-Branch? And to what end? The last man to occupy this desk had been Norman Harold Wellesley, a traitor. Wellesley was gone now, dead, but the fact that he\u0027d ever existed at all - and in this of all jobs - must have caused ructions further up the line. What, a double-agent? A spy among mindspies? Something which must never be allowed to happen again, obviously; but how to stop it from happening again? Could it be that someone had been appointed to watch the watchers? It reminded Clarke of a ditty his mother had used to say to him when he was small and had an itch. She would find the spot and scratch it, reciting: \u0027Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite \u0027em. And little fleas have smaller fleas, and so ad infinitum!\u0027 Was Clarke himself under esper scrutiny? And if so, what had been read from his mind? He got on to the switchboard, said: \u0027Get me the Minister Responsible. If he\u0027s not available, leave a message that he\u0027s to call me back soonest. Also, I\u0027d like someone to run me off a duplicate set of police reports on those girls in that serial killer case.\u0027 Half an hour later the reports were delivered to him, and as he was putting them in a large envelope he got his call from the Minister. \u0027Yes, Clarke?\u0027 \u0027Sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027I just had Harry Keogh on the \u0027phone.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 \u0027He asked for a set of reports on the girls in the serial killer case. As you\u0027ll recall, we asked for his help on that.\u0027 \u0027I recall that you asked for his help, Clarke, yes. But in fact I\u0027m not so sure it was a good idea. Indeed, I think it\u0027s time to rethink our attitude towards Keogh.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 \u0027Yes. I know he\u0027s been of some assistance to the Branch, and -\u0027 \u0027Some?\u0027 Clarke had to cut in. \u0027Some assistance? We\u0027d have all been goners long ago without him. We can\u0027t ever repay him. Not just us but everyone. And I do mean everyone.\u0027 Things change, Clarke,\u0027 said that unseen, unknown other. \u0027You people are a weird lot - no offence - and Keogh has to be the weirdest of all. Also, he\u0027s not really one of you. So as of now I want you to avoid contact with him. But we\u0027ll talk about him again later, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 The warning bells rang even louder. Talking to the Minister Responsible was always like talking to a very smooth robot, but this time he was just too smooth. \u0027And the police reports? Does he get them?\u0027 \u0027I think not. Let\u0027s just keep him at arm\u0027s length for the moment, right?\u0027 \u0027Is there something to worry about, maybe?\u0027 Clarke came straight out with it. \u0027Do you think perhaps we should watch him?\u0027 \u0027Why, you surprise me!\u0027 said the other, smooth as ever. \u0027It was my understanding that Keogh had always been a good friend of yours.\u0027 \u0027He has.\u0027 \u0027Well, and doubtless that was of value at the time. But as I said, things change. I will get back to you about him - one way or the other - in good time. But until then... was there anything else?\u0027 \u0027One small thing.\u0027 Clarke kept his tone neutral but scowled at the \u0027phone. \u0027About Paxton...\u0027It was a leaf straight out of Harry Keogh\u0027s book, and it worked just as well for Clarke. \u0027Paxton?\u0027 (He actually heard the Minister catch his breath!) Then, more cautiously, perhaps curiously: \u0027Paxton? But we\u0027re no longer interested in him, are we?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s just that I was reading through his records,\u0027 Clarke lied, \u0027his progress reports, you know? And it seemed to me we lost a good one there. Is it possible you\u0027ve been maybe a bit too thorough? A shame to lose him if there\u0027s a chance we can bring him on. We really can\u0027t afford to waste talents like his.\u0027 \u0027Clarke,\u0027 the Minister sighed, \u0027you have your side of the job, and I have mine. I don\u0027t question your decisions, do I?\u0027 Don\u0027t you? \u0027And I really would appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t question mine. Forget about Paxton, he\u0027s out of it.\u0027 \u0027As you wish - but I think I\u0027ll at least keep an eye on him. If only from a distance. After all, we\u0027re not the only ones in the mindspy game. I\u0027d hate it if he were recruited by the other side...\u0027 The Minister was getting peeved. \u0027For the moment you have quite enough work on your plate!\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Leave Paxton be. A periodic check will suffice - when I say so!\u0027 Clarke was only polite when people were polite to him. He was far too important to let himself be stepped on. \u0027Keep your shirt on ... sir,\u0027 he growled. \u0027Anything I say or do is in the Branch\u0027s best interest, believe me - even when I step on toes.\u0027 \u0027Of course, of course.\u0027 The other was at once conciliatory. \u0027But we\u0027re all in the same boat, Clarke, and none of us knows everything. So for the time being let\u0027s just trust each other, all right?\u0027 Oh, yeah, let\u0027s! Sure! \u0027Fine,\u0027 Clarke said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve taken up so much of your time.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all right. We\u0027ll be speaking again soon, I\u0027m sure...\u0027 Clarke put the \u0027phone down and continued to scowl at it a while, then sealed the envelope containing the police reports and scrawled Harry Keogh\u0027s address on it. He erased his and Keogh\u0027s recent conversation, then asked the switchboard if they\u0027d traced the call. They had and it was Harry\u0027s Edinburgh number. He \u0027phoned it direct but got no answer. And finally he called a courier into his office and gave him the envelope. \u0027Post it, please,\u0027 he said, but before the courier could leave: \u0027No, repackage the whole thing and send it off special delivery. And then forget you ever saw it, right?\u0027 In a little while he was alone with his dark, suspicious thoughts again, and an itch between his shoulderblades which he couldn\u0027t quite get at. And his mother\u0027s ditty about fleas, which was equally persistent.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-3.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
