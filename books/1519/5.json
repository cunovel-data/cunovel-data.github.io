{"id":62519,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Someone Dying\\n\\n The Necroscope\u0027s vampire - as yet a mere tadpole of alien, parasitic contamination - was immature. As such it had no desire for conflict either internal or external but wished only to evolve and get on with the long process of its host\u0027s conversion; which was why its influence was mainly enervating. Keep Harry mentally and emotionally drained, and he\u0027d be less likely to jeopardize himself. Which by definition meant that he\u0027d be less likely to jeopardize his horrific tenant. Hence his flashes of Wamphyri-awareness (half-glimpsed knowledge of burgeoning, ungovernable Power) and the burning need to argue and cross-examine, even to engage his own mind in long spells of intense self-inquisition, despite the bouts of inwardly-directed anger and mental exhaustion which invariably resulted.\\n\\n But quite apart from the Necroscope\u0027s mind, his blood was also aware that the invader was here; it seemed filled with a weird psychic fever which kept him jumpy and constantly on guard. He was a man with a volcano inside him, which for now merely simmered and let off a little steam. Not knowing when the volcano was set to go off, he couldn\u0027t relax but must hold the cap firmly in place, and listen with a rapt, horrified and yet curious intentness to the rumbling within.\\n\\n On the one hand Harry would like to test out his Wamphyri talents to the full (for they were part of him even now, while yet the physical side of the thing was still embryonic) but on the other he knew that to do so would be to accelerate the process. For one thing was certain: however immature his symbiont might be, it was also fast-growing and fast-learning. No slow starter, this vampire.\\n\\n But while the parasite like all its kind would be dogged, the Necroscope was no less tenacious in his own right. His son had managed to keep his vampire in order, hadn\u0027t he? Like son, like father: Harry would do his damnedest to follow suit.\\n\\n Except that would be hard enough in itself without the current recalcitrance of the Great Majority... and the knowledge or at least strong suspicion that E-Branch was gearing itself for war... and the fact that despite all of this Harry had determined to bring a certain fiend to justice but first must find him.\\n\\n Previously he would have been able to work out a logical system of approach, like writing down an order of priorities. But his mental confusion and the weariness it produced obfuscated, so that while he was aware of the passage of time and of forces mobilizing against him, still he felt incapable of rising above and proceeding beyond his personal miasma. Which in turn brought frustration, more anger, and the first gale warnings that his whirling, gusting emotions craved physical release.\\n\\n Like an alien autism incapable of self-expression, Harry could feel his violence lying just beneath the surface. His violence, yes, for the vampire in him was neither violent nor emotional: it merely amplified these properties in its host.\\n\\n Perhaps most frustrating of all, he knew that none of the things he was doing - or would do if he felt capable -was of the slightest importance to his own personal survival. Another in his position might seek to change his identity, find a safe place, extricate himself permanently from all dangerous sources and focuses.\\n\\n Or would he? Would he even be able to? For as Harry had pointed out to Pythagoras, the world is a small place.\\n\\n And by definition any other in Harry\u0027s position would likewise be Wamphyri and territorial. This was his world; this house not far from Edinburgh was his house; especially his thoughts and actions were his territory -most of them, most of the time - at least when others weren\u0027t snooping on them.\\n\\n Yesterday he had gone to the ruins of the Castle Ferenczy and spoken to Bodrogk the Thracian. Bodrogk was too recent a friend to have known Harry before the start of his transition; he accepted him for what he was now. Also, Bodrogk was fearless and in any case could not possibly fear the Necroscope, nor for that matter any other living man. His dust, and the dust of his wife Sofia, was scattered to the winds and only their spirits remained in the Carpathians now. They were quite beyond earthly harm.\\n\\n The subject of Harry\u0027s inquiry had been the composition and proportions of the chemical ingredients of Janos Ferenczy\u0027s necromantic potions. He would retrieve Trevor Jordan and Penny Sanderson from their \u0027essential salts\u0027 only if he could bring them back perfect or as close to perfect as possible. Bodrogk, because he had been subjected to just such experiments, was an authority. Even so, he\u0027d inquired at length into the Necroscope\u0027s purpose before passing on the necessary information.\\n\\n And so today Harry had been ready to become a true necromancer in his own right, and would have proceeded... but at the last moment he\u0027d felt that twinge, that covert tweaking at the corner of his mind, which had warned him that Geoffrey Paxton was close by and watching him. Knowing that Paxton was seeking to prove just such unnatural activity in him, Harry had been obliged to postpone the experiment. And then, barely able to control his rage, he\u0027d spoken to Darcy Clarke at E-Branch HQ.\\n\\n It had come as a relief to know that Paxton wasn\u0027t Darcy\u0027s man; but if not his, whose? Maybe Darcy would find out and let him know, and maybe not. And in any case what odds? For Harry knew that sooner or later Darcy and the others must all join forces against him. The hell of it was that the boss of E-Branch had been a good friend, once. The Necroscope couldn\u0027t see any way that he would ever be able to hurt Darcy. But how to explain that to the thing inside him?\\n\\n At two in the afternoon Harry had sat quite still in his study and \u0027listened\u0027. But his vampire awareness was still a fledgling thing and he\u0027d detected nothing. Or maybe he had: the very briefest wriggle of something on the outermost rim of his perceptions. Whatever, it was suspicious enough that he\u0027d put back his experiment yet again, then rammed his wide-brimmed hat on to his head and gone outdoors to talk to his mother.\\n\\n Now, sitting on the crumbling river bank, Harry dangled his legs and looked down into the gently swirling water which had been Mary Keogh\u0027s grave for most of his life, and let his deadspeak thoughts reach out to her. Since there was no one here to see him, he simply spoke to her, which was also deadspeak and felt far more natural: \u0027Ma, I\u0027m in a mess.\u0027\\n\\n If she\u0027d answered: \u0027So what\u0027s new?\u0027 he would understand; it seemed he was always in a mess. But Mary Keogh loved her son as all mothers do, and death had not diminished that.\\n\\n Harry? her voice seemed very faint now, very distant, as if she\u0027d been washed away downriver along with her physical shell. Oh, Harry, I know you are, son.\\n\\n Well, and that was only to be expected. He\u0027d never been able to hide anything from his Ma, who had warned him often enough that there are some things you daren\u0027t get too close to. This time he\u0027d let himself get too close. \u0027Do you know what I\u0027m talking about?\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s only one thing you can be talking about, son, (she sounded so sad, so sorry for him). And even if you hadn\u0027t come to speak to me, still I would know. All of us know, Harry.\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027They\u0027re not so keen to talk to me any more,\u0027 he said, maybe a little bitterly. \u0027And yet I never harmed a single one of them.\u0027\\n\\n But you should try to understand, Harry, she was at pains to explain. The Great Majority were once living and now are dead. They remember what life was, and they know what death is, but they don\u0027t understand and want nothing to do with anything that lies between. They can\u0027t understand something which preys on the living to make them undead, which takes away true life and replaces it with soulless greed and lust and... and evil. The children and grandchildren of the teeming dead are still in the world of the living, and so are you. And that\u0027s what worries them. It makes no difference how long people are dead, Harry, they still worry about their children. But you know that, son, don\u0027t you?\\n\\n Harry sighed. Her deadspeak, however faint (and possibly even chiding?) was as warm as ever. It covered the Necroscope like a blanket, kept him safe, made it easier to think and plan and even dream. It was so alien to the nightmare thing inside him that that part of Harry could neither understand nor interfere with it. Namely, it was the love of his mother, soothing as nothing else could ever be.\\n\\n \u0027But the point is,\u0027 he said, in a little while, \u0027that I\u0027ve one more thing to do before I ... before I\u0027m finished here. And it\u0027s important, Ma. Important to me, and to you and the teeming dead alike. There\u0027s a monster running loose, and I have to nail him.\u0027\\n\\n A monster, son? Her voice was very soft, but he knew what she meant. Who was he to talk about monsters?\\n\\n \u0027Ma, I\u0027ve done nothing wrong,\u0027 he answered. \u0027And so long as I\u0027m me, I\u0027m not going to.\u0027\\n\\n Harry, she said, son, I\u0027m all used up. And she wasn\u0027t only faint but very tired, too. We\u0027re not inexhaustible. Left alone we\u0027d just go on thinking our thoughts, gradually fading as all things do. We do fade in the end, be it ever so long. But torn by outside influences we go that much faster. I think that\u0027s how it works, anyway. You were a light in our long night, son, and it was like we could see again. But now we have to let you go and suffer the darkness. Alive we used to wonder: is there anything on the other side? Well, there was, and then you came and joined us up, and there was a kind of life again. So now I wonder: what\u0027s next? What I\u0027m telling you is I haven\u0027t long here. But I\u0027d hate to leave you not knowing you were all right. What are your plans, Harry?\\n\\n And for the first time he realized that he really did need a plan. As simply as that, his mother had cut through all of his confusion.\\n\\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s a place I can go,\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027Not much of a place, but better than dying ... I think. And there\u0027s someone there who can teach me things, if he\u0027s willing. He had problems, too, but the last time I saw him he was coping. Maybe he still is. Maybe I can learn something from him.\u0027\\n\\n She knew where, who and what he meant, of course. But isn\u0027t that a sinister sort of place, Harry?\\n\\n \u0027It was.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027Maybe it still is. But at least I won\u0027t be hunted there. I would be hunted here, eventually, if I stayed. Which means I\u0027d be forced to hunt, too. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of and what I\u0027m trying to avoid. I\u0027m a plague in a bottle, Ma, safe only so long as no one shakes or tries to break me. But in that other place the plague has already run its course. What\u0027s unthinkable here is understood there. Not acceptable, never that, but a reality all the same.\u0027\\n\\n She sighed. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not just giving in, son. And with something of her old fondness: You\u0027re a fighter, Harry. You always were.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I was,\u0027 he agreed, \u0027but I can\u0027t fight here. That would only bring it on. And in the end I\u0027m afraid it might be stronger than me. There are still things I have to do here, that\u0027s all, business that needs clearing up. Which is how I\u0027ll occupy myself until it\u0027s time. You asked about my plans.\\n\\n They\u0027re simple, really. When my head\u0027s on straight I can read them like words in a book. There\u0027s a girl who died horribly and didn\u0027t deserve it, because no one deserves to die like that; and there\u0027s the creature who killed her and other innocents like her, who does deserve it. There\u0027s a long talk - an explanation - which I owe to Darcy Clarke; and oh, there are talents I\u0027d like to gather, which might be useful to me in the other place.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all of it: a few things to do, something I have to straighten out, and one or two new things to learn. And then it will be time I walked. I\u0027d rather walk than be chased.\u0027\\n\\n And you\u0027ll never come back?\\n\\n \u0027I might, if I learned how to hold the thing permanently in check. But if I can\u0027t... no, never.\u0027\\n\\n How will you deal with this man, murderer, monster you\u0027re looking for?\\n\\n \u0027As quick and as cleanly as he\u0027ll let me. You don\u0027t know what he does, Ma, but I can tell you I won\u0027t soil my hands on him, not if I can help it. Killing him will be like cutting out a tumour in the flesh of humanity.\u0027\\n\\n You\u0027ve cut out a few of those, son.\\n\\n \u0027And one more to go,\u0027 Harry nodded.\\n\\n And the girl who doesn\u0027t deserve to be dead? That was a strange way of putting it, Harry.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s such a recent thing for her, Ma,\u0027 (Harry knew he\u0027d strayed into a minefield, looked in vain for a safe landmark). \u0027She\u0027s not used to it yet. And... and she doesn\u0027t have to get used to it. I mean, I can help her.\u0027\\n\\n You\u0027ve learned a new thing, Harry, she answered, but very slowly, and he sensed something different in her voice which was never there before - fear? You learned it from Janos Ferenczy, and I can feel it. Yes, and it\u0027s what puts you apart from us now. We can all feel it! And suddenly her deadspeak was wracked with small shudders.\\n\\n His Ma, too? Had he alienated even his warm, sweet Ma? Suddenly he had the feeling that if he let her go she\u0027d just drift away from him and keep on drifting. Perhaps into that beyond place which she sensed waiting there.\\n\\n But he had one trump card left, and now played it: \u0027Ma, am I good or bad? Was I born good or evil?\u0027\\n\\n She read the anxiety in his deadspeak and returned at once. Oh, you were good, son. How can you doubt it? You were always so good!\\n\\n \u0027Well, nothing\u0027s changed, Ma. Not yet, and not here. I promise you, I won\u0027t let anything change me, not here. If and when I feel it - as soon as I feel I can\u0027t hold it any longer-then I\u0027ll go.\u0027\\n\\n But if you bring that girl back, what will she be?\\n\\n \u0027Beautiful, just as she was. Maybe not physically beautiful - though it\u0027s a fact she was lovely - but alive. And that\u0027s to be beautiful. You know that.\u0027\\n\\n But for how long, son? I mean, will she age? Will she die? What will she be? What will she be, Harry?!\\n\\n He had no answer. \u0027Just a girl. I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n And her children? What will they be?\\n\\n \u0027Ma, I don\u0027t know! I only know she\u0027s too much alive to be dead.\u0027\\n\\n Are you doing it for... yourself?\\n\\n \u0027No, just for her, and for all of you.\u0027\\n\\n He sensed her shaking her head. I don\u0027t know, son. I just don\u0027t know.\\n\\n Trust me, Ma.\u0027\\n\\n Well, I suppose I\u0027ll have to. So how can I help?\\n\\n Harry was eager now, except: \u0027Ma, I don\u0027t want to weaken you. You said you were all used up.\u0027\\n\\n So I am, but if you can fight so can I. If the dead won\u0027t talk to you, maybe they\u0027ll still talk to me. While they can.\\n\\n He nodded his gratitude and in a little while said: \u0027There were others before Penny Sanderson. I know their names from the newspapers, but I have to know where they were laid to rest and I need an introduction. See, they were badly hurt and probably won\u0027t trust someone like me, who can touch them from this side. I mean, the one who killed them, he could do that, too. While I do need to talk to them, I don\u0027t want to frighten them more than they already are. So you see, without you it would be just too difficult.\u0027\\n\\n So you want to know which graveyards they\u0027re in, right?\\n\\n \u0027Right. It probably wouldn\u0027t be too hard to find out for myself, but there are so many things on my mind that keep getting in the way. And so time goes by.\u0027\\n\\n All right, Harry, I\u0027ll do what I can. But I don\u0027t want to have to track you down any more, so it would be better if you came to see me. That way I... She paused, cut off abruptly.\\n\\n \u0027Ma?\u0027\\n\\n Didn\u0027t you feel that, son? I always feel it, when they\u0027re close by like that.\\n\\n \u0027What was it?\u0027\\n\\n Someone joining us, she answered, sadly. Someone dying. Some thing, anyway.\\n\\n A medium in life, in death Mary Keogh\u0027s contact with death was that much sharper. But what had she meant? It wasn\u0027t clear, and Harry felt the short hairs prickle on the back of his neck. \u0027Some... thing?\u0027 he repeated her.\\n\\n A pet, a puppy, an accident, she sighed. And some poor child\u0027s heart broken. In Bonnyrig. Just this minute.\\n\\n The Necroscope felt his own heart give a start; he\u0027d lost so much during his life that the thought of another\u0027s loss, however small, stung him with its poignancy. Or maybe it was just the way his mother had reported the occurrence, so soulfully. Or there again it could be an effect of his heightened emotional awareness. Maybe there was someone he could comfort.\\n\\n \u0027Bonnyrig, did you say? Ma, I\u0027ll be going now. I\u0027ll come and see you tomorrow. Maybe you\u0027ll know something by then.\u0027\\n\\n Take care, son.\\n\\n Harry stood up, looked up and down the river and across it to the other side. The bright sun had passed behind fluffy, drifting clouds, which was a relief.\\n\\n He climbed a tottering fence and entered a small copse, and in the dappled heart of the greenery conjured a Möbius door. A moment later and he emerged in a back alley close to the high street in Bonnyrig. And letting his deadspeak sensitivity spread out around him like a fan or cobweb, he searched for a newcomer among the ranks of the dead.\\n\\n And there it was, close by: a whining yelp in memory of the panic and pain of a few moments ago, and a certain astonishment that the pain was no longer here, and disbelief that the bright day could so quickly turn black and blacker than night. A dumb animal\u0027s perception of sudden death.\\n\\n Harry understood it very well, for it wasn\u0027t too dissimilar to the reaction of a human being. The only difference being that dogs have neither foreknowledge of nor preoccupation with death, so that their surprise is that much greater. But strike or kick a dog unjustly or cruelly and it will draw back with just the same astonishment, the same disbelief.\\n\\n Taking a chance that he wasn\u0027t observed, the Necroscope used the Möbius Continuum to follow the pup\u0027s thoughts to their source: a kerbside in the main village street, at a junction where the street turned left on to the main road into Edinburgh. A workday, there weren\u0027t many people about; the handful which had gathered had their backs to Harry anyway where he emerged on to the pavement as if from thin air. And the first thing he saw was the long, dark skidmark burned into the road\u0027s surface.\\n\\n The pup\u0027s deadspeak thoughts were more desperate now as it realized that it couldn\u0027t extricate itself from this new predicament. There was no feeling, no contact, no light. Where was its God, its young master?\\n\\n Shh! Harry hushed. It\u0027s OK, boy! It\u0027s all right! Shh!\\n\\n He moved to the forefront of the handful of onlookers, saw a young boy kneeling there in the gutter, his cheeks shiny with tears, the broken pup dead in his arms. One of the pup\u0027s shoulders was askew and its spine kinked; its right foreleg flopped like a rubber band; its crushed head oozed brain fluid from a torn right ear.\\n\\n Harry got down on one knee, put an arm round the boy and stroked the dead pet. And again: \u0027Shh, boy!\u0027 He comforted both of them. And in his mind the pup\u0027s whines and yelps quietened to a panting whimper. It could feel again. It felt Harry.\\n\\n But the boy couldn\u0027t be comforted. \u0027He\u0027s dead!\u0027 he kept moaning. \u0027He\u0027s dead! Paddy\u0027s dead! Why didn\u0027t the car hit me and not Paddy? Why didn\u0027t the car stop?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where do you live, son?\u0027 Harry asked the boy, a towhead of maybe eight or nine.\\n\\n The other glanced at him through blurred-blue eyes. \u0027Down there.\u0027 He nodded vaguely over his right shoulder. \u0027Number seven. We live there, Paddy and me.\u0027\\n\\n Harry took the dog gently into his arms and stood up. \u0027Let\u0027s get him home then,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The crowd parted for them and Harry heard someone say, \u0027It\u0027s a shame. What a terrible shame!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Paddy\u0027s dead!\u0027 The kid clutched the Necroscope\u0027s elbow as they turned the corner into a narrow, deserted street.\\n\\n Dead? Yes, he was, but ... did he really have to be? You don\u0027t have to be, do you, Paddy?\\n\\n The deadspeak answer which came back wasn\u0027t quite a bark and it wasn\u0027t quite a word - but it was an agreement. A dog will usually agree with his friends, and rarely if ever disagree with his master. While Harry wasn\u0027t Paddy\u0027s beloved master, he certainly was a new friend.\\n\\n And the decision was made as quickly as that.\\n\\n Before they reached the small garden in front of number seven, Harry looked down at the lad and said: \u0027What\u0027s your name, son?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Peter.\u0027 The other could scarcely get it out past his tears and the lump in his throat.\\n\\n \u0027Peter, I - \u0027 Harry jerked to a halt. Play-acting for all he was worth, he glanced at the pet in his arms. \u0027 - I think I felt him move!\u0027\\n\\n The boy\u0027s mouth fell open. \u0027Paddy moved? But he\u0027s so bad hurt!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Son, I\u0027m a vet,\u0027 Harry lied. \u0027Maybe I can save him. You run quickly now and tell your people what\u0027s happened, and I\u0027ll take Paddy to the surgery. And whatever happens, I\u0027ll be in touch just as soon as I know how bad he is - or how good. OK?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t waste time, Peter,\u0027 Harry urged. \u0027It\u0027s Paddy\u0027s life, right?\u0027\\n\\n The other gulped, nodded once, flew to the gate of number seven and through it, and as he vanished pell-mell into the garden Harry conjured a Möbius door. By the time Peter\u0027s Ma came out of the house wringing her hands - came flying to see the vet - Harry was at a different address entirely ...\\n\\n The Necroscope had perhaps too few friends among the living, but one of them was an old potter up in the Pentlands who fired his own kilns. Paddy was absolutely dead, no doubt about that, when Harry handed him over to Hamish McCulloch for calcination in one of his ovens. \u0027It\u0027s worth a twenty to me, Hamish,\u0027 he told the old Scot, \u0027if you can bring him down to ashes. Well, if not to me, to his master, a young lad with a broken heart. And I\u0027ll pay you for one of your pots, too, to keep him in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I reckon we can manage that, Harry.\u0027 Hamish nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Only one thing,\u0027 said the Necroscope, \u0027be careful how you gather him up. I mean, the young lad wants to know he has all of him, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just as you say.\u0027 Another nod. And Harry waited for five hours until the job was done, but stayed calm and patient and controlled throughout. For now he was the old Harry who, while he had little enough time left of his own, nevertheless had all the time in the world for this.\\n\\n And anyway it would serve his wider purposes too, wouldn\u0027t it? A little preview of what was to come? A chance to observe any possible... discrepancies? For Trevor Jordan\u0027s brain had also been shattered, and Penny\u0027s flesh had been torn.\\n\\n At 10:00 p.m. Harry was down in the spacious, dusty cellar of his old house a mile or so out of Bonnyrig. He\u0027d cleaned the place out as best he could and scrubbed an area in the centre of the stone floor until it was smooth as glass. Old Hamish had told him the weight of the dead pup\u0027s body before calcination, so that even if Harry\u0027s grasp of maths had been meagre it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult to calculate pound for pound the various amounts of chemicals required. His knowledge was anything but meagre and he\u0027d calculated it down into grams.\\n\\n Finally ashes and chemicals were poured together, making a very small mound in the scrubbed floor space, and Harry was ready. And this time there was no pausing to check if his own personal mind-flea was up and jumping, for this time he wasn\u0027t worried for himself but for a little kid who wouldn\u0027t be sleeping easy tonight.\\n\\n Except now that he was ready it all seemed so ridiculously easy. Was this all there was to it? Had he perhaps forgotten something? Had those weirdly esoteric words he\u0027d uttered down in the bowels of Janos Ferenczy\u0027s ruined castle - that formula out of hideous aeons - really sufficed to bring about... resurrection? And if so, had it been an act of blasphemy? On the other hand, where was the profit in worrying about that now? If the Necroscope was to be damned for his works then he was already damned. And purgatory has to be something like infinity: if you\u0027re to suffer for all eternity, there\u0027s no way you can be made to suffer twice as long. Is there?\\n\\n As always his arguments went in a circle, making his head spin. But suddenly he \u0027knew\u0027 that it was the vampire in him, working to confuse him, and in that same moment he acted and so broke the thread. Directing a rigid finger and his thoughts at the pile of ingredients, he spoke the words of evocation:\\n\\n \u0027Y\u0027ai \u0027Ng\u0027ngah,\\n\\n Yog-Sothoth\\n\\n H\u0027ee-L\u0027geb,\\n\\n F\u0027ai Throdog\\n\\n - Uaaahr\\n\\n It was like putting a lighted match to a pile of incendiary materials: there was phosphorescent light, coloured smoke, a not-quite-sulphur stench. And there was a yelp!\\n\\n Paddy, called up from his ashes, came staggering from a mushrooming smoke-ring of rapidly dispersing gas or vapour. His ears and stump of a tail were down, trembling, and he wobbled on legs of jelly which seemed incapable of supporting him. He had returned from death and weightlessness - from incorporeity - to life and substantiality in a moment, but his pup\u0027s legs were already unused to it.\\n\\n \u0027Paddy,\u0027 the Necroscope whispered, going down on one knee. \u0027Paddy - here, boy!\u0027 And the little dog fell down, stood up, shook himself so as almost to fall again, and came to him.\\n\\n Black and white, short in the leg, floppy-eared, a mongrel entirely - and entirely alive!\\n\\n ... Was he?\\n\\n Paddy, the Necroscope spoke again, this time in dead-speak. But there was no answer.\\n\\n Paddy lived. Truly.\\n\\n Half an hour later Harry delivered Paddy to house number seven of a row of neat terraced houses in Bonnyrig. He didn\u0027t mean to stay, would escape immediately if he could, but there were things he needed to know. About Paddy. About Paddy\u0027s character. Was he the same dog exactly?\\n\\n And apparently he was. Certainly Peter thought so. Paddy\u0027s master had been ready for bed for an hour, but he wouldn\u0027t go until he\u0027d heard from his \u0027vet\u0027. And Paddy\u0027s return was a miracle to him, though only the Necroscope knew how much of a miracle.\\n\\n Peter\u0027s father was a tall, thin, callused man, but a kind one. \u0027The boy told us he thought Paddy must be dead,\u0027 he said, pouring Harry a liberal whisky, after Peter and his pup had disappeared for the night. \u0027Broken bones, blood and brains from his ear, a spine all out of joint - it had us worried. He loves that pup.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It looked a lot worse than it was,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027The pup was unconscious, which made his limbs flop; there was some blood from a few scratches, and that always looks bad; and he\u0027d coughed up some slaver. Shock, mostly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And his shoulders?\u0027 The other raised an eyebrow. \u0027Peter said they weren\u0027t working, that they were definitely broken.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dislocated.\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Once we fixed that everything else came right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re grateful to you.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do we owe you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s very kind of you...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just wanted to be sure that Paddy was the same dog,\u0027 said the Necroscope. \u0027I mean, that the bump he took hadn\u0027t changed his personality. Did he seem the same to you?\u0027\\n\\n There came a yelp and a bark, and laughter from Peter\u0027s bedroom.\\n\\n \u0027Playing.\u0027 The boy\u0027s mother nodded, and smiled under-standingly. They shouldn\u0027t be, but tonight\u0027s special. Oh, yes, Mr...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Keogh,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, Paddy\u0027s just the same.\u0027\\n\\n Peter\u0027s father saw Harry to the garden gate, thanked him again and said goodnight. When he went back inside his wife said: \u0027What an uncommonly decent, nice person. His eyes, so soulful!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm?\u0027 Her husband was thoughtful.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t you think so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, aye, certainly. But - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But? Didn\u0027t you like him, then? Is there something you can\u0027t trust in a man who won\u0027t accept payment for a job well done?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, it\u0027s not that! But, his eyes...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Soulful, weren\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Were they? Down at the garden gate, in the darkness, when he looked at me -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n But: \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Peter\u0027s father, shaking his head. \u0027A trick of the light, that\u0027s all...\u0027\\n\\n Back home Harry felt good. Better than at any time since Greece, when he\u0027d got his deadspeak and numeracy back. Maybe he could feel even better, and cause others to feel better, too.\\n\\n In his study he sat in an easy chair and talked to an urn where it stood shadowed in one corner of the room. Or it would appear that he talked to an urn, but urns don\u0027t talk back: Trevor, you were a telepath and a good one. Which means that you still are. So I know that even when I don\u0027t speak to you, still you\u0027re listening to me. You listen to my thoughts. So ... you know what I did tonight, right?\u0027\\n\\n I can\u0027t help what I am, Harry, Trevor Jordan answered, his deadspeak voice \u0027breathless\u0027 with excitement. No more than you can. Yes, I know what you did - and what you\u0027re planning to do. I can\u0027t believe it yet, and don\u0027t suppose 1 will for quite some little time after it has happened, if it happens. It\u0027s like a wonderful dream that I don\u0027t want to wake up from. Except there\u0027s a chance it will be even more wonderful when I do wake up. There was no hope, none, and now there is...\\n\\n \u0027But surely you knew my intention all along?\u0027\\n\\n Knowing what someone wants to do doesn\u0027t make them capable of doing it, the other answered. But now, after the dog...\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027But a dog\u0027s a dog, and a man\u0027s a man. We still can\u0027t be sure until... we\u0027re sure.\u0027\\n\\n Do I have anything to lose?\\n\\n \u0027I suppose not.\u0027\\n\\n Harry, any time you\u0027re ready, then so am I. Boy, am I ready!\\n\\n Trevor, just a second ago you said you can\u0027t help being what you are any more than I can. Did that mean more than it sounded? You must have read quite a lot, in my mind.\u0027\\n\\n And after a long pause: I won\u0027t lie to you, Harry. I know what\u0027s happened to you, what you\u0027re becoming. You don\u0027t know how sorry 1 am.\\n\\n \u0027Pretty soon,\u0027 said the Necroscope, \u0027the whole damn rat pack will be after me.\u0027\\n\\n I know. And I know what you\u0027ll do then, and where you\u0027ll go.\\n\\n Again Harry\u0027s nod. \u0027But it\u0027s like my Ma told me,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s a strange and sinister place. Any help I can get, I\u0027ll probably need it.\u0027\\n\\n Is there something I can do? Not much, I reckon. Not from where I am right now.\\n\\n \u0027Actually, yes,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027We could do it right now. But I won\u0027t take that sort of advantage. If the thing works, that will be soon enough. And even then - especially then - the decision will still be yours.\u0027\\n\\n So ... when? (Again Jordan\u0027s breathlessness.)\\n\\n Tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n Jesus!\\n\\n But: \u0027Don\u0027t!\u0027 the Necroscope cautioned him then. \u0027Curse all you want, but be careful who you name...\u0027\\n\\n After that they talked generally and remembered old times. A pity there wasn\u0027t anything good to remember. Oh, good had come out of it, but it had been evil as Hell at the time.\\n\\n And after a lull in their deadspeak conversation: Harry, you know that Paxton\u0027s still watching you, don\u0027t you? It was Jordan who had first brought the mindspy to the Necroscope\u0027s attention. Harry remembered that with gratitude. But ever since the initial warning a week ago, it had been his own intuition which alerted him to the telepath\u0027s proximity.\\n\\n His first instinctive reaction to the problem had been to invoke a talent he\u0027d inherited from Harold Wellesley, an ex-boss of E-Branch who had suicided after being found out as a double-agent. Wellesley\u0027s talent had been a negative sort of thing: his mind had been better than the vaults of a bank, literally impregnable. But it had seemed to make him the ideal candidate for head of the British mindspy security organization. Had seemed to, anyway. By way of atonement, he\u0027d passed on his talent to Harry.\\n\\n But Wellesley\u0027s talent was sometimes a two-edged sword: if you bolt your doors against your enemies, your friends get locked out, too. Also, when you blow out the candle in a deep cave, everyone goes blind. Harry would prefer the light, prefer to know Paxton was there and what he was about.\\n\\n And in any case it was draining to have to keep his guard up like that. Power, all power, has to be generated somewhere, and with the Necroscope\u0027s constantly increasing emotional stress his batteries were already sufficiently drained.\\n\\n Now it was the business of Harry\u0027s intuition to keep tabs on the mindspy, his intuition and the expanding intelligence of the thing inside him, its waxing talents. Eventually these would develop into a sort of telepathy in their own right - into telepathy and other forms of ESP -but it could do no harm to have Jordan\u0027s brand of the art as an \u0027optional extra\u0027.\\n\\n Jordan heard that, too.\\n\\n Harry, there\u0027s no sweat on that. I know you\u0027re different. Anything I can give you, take it. Now or after you ... try it out on me, it makes no difference. I\u0027m not going to change my mind. You\u0027ll use it to protect yourself, of course you will, but not to hurt us, I\u0027m sure.\\n\\n \u0027Us?\u0027\\n\\n People, Harry. I don\u0027t think you could hurt people.\\n\\n \u0027I wish I could be so sure. But the thing is, it won\u0027t be me. Or it will be, but I won\u0027t think the same any more.\u0027\\n\\n So all you have to do is stick to your plan. When you know it\u0027s coming - or when circumstances force you to take defensive or evasive action - that\u0027s when you get the hell out of it.\\n\\n \u0027Chased out of my own world!\u0027 the Necroscope growled.\\n\\n That or let the genie out of its bottle, yes.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a straight talker, Trevor.\u0027\\n\\n Isn\u0027t that what friends are for?\\n\\n \u0027But in a way you\u0027re a kind of genie in a bottle yourself, right?\u0027 Harry\u0027s contrary Wamphyri side was surfacing, his need to argue the point. Any point. Jordan hadn\u0027t sensed it yet, but in any case he was trying to keep the conversation light.\\n\\n Maybe that\u0027s where those old Moslem legends spring from, eh? A man with the Power, who knows the magic words, calling up a powerful slave from dust in a bottle. What is your wish, O Master?\\n\\n \u0027My wish?\u0027 Harry\u0027s voice was gaunt as his face. \u0027Sometimes I wish to fuck I\u0027d never been born!\u0027\\n\\n And now Jordan sensed it: Harry\u0027s duality - the strange tides in his blood, eroding the coastline of his will - the horror which challenged his human ascendancy even now, whose challenge was strengthening hour by hour, day by day.\\n\\n You\u0027re tired, Harry. Maybe you should take it easy for a while. Get some sleep.\\n\\n \u0027At night?\u0027 The Necroscope chuckled, but drily, darkly. \u0027It\u0027s not my nature, Trevor.\u0027\\n\\n You have to fight it.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been fighting it!\u0027 Harry\u0027s growl was deeper. \u0027All I do is fight it.\u0027\\n\\n Jordan was silent for a moment. Then: Maybe... Maybe we should give it a break now. His deadspeak was full of trembling. Harry could feel his fear, the terror of a dead man. And to his innermost self, where Jordan couldn\u0027t reach:\\n\\n Oh, God! Even the dead are afraid of me now.\\n\\n He stood up abruptly, starting to his feet so as almost to topple his chair. And lurching to the curtains he looked out through an inch of space where the drapes came together, across the river and into the night. At which precise moment, on the far river bank and under the trees there, someone struck a match to light a cigarette. Just for a second Harry saw the flare before it was cupped in the windshield of a hand. And then there was only a yellow glow, brightening when the watcher took a deep drag.\\n\\n The bastard\u0027s out there right now,\u0027 Harry spoke, almost to himself.\\n\\n It might as well be to himself, for Jordan was too frightened to answer... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-v-deadspawn-necroscope-5/page-5.html","bookId":1519,"book":{"id":1519,"title":"Necroscope V: Deadspawn (Necroscope #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Keogh discovers that he is being transformed into a member of the Wamphyri by the spores of the mushrooms he inhaled at the ruins of Faethors house in Ploesti.
