I made dinner reservations at our hotel for eight o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know I don\u0027t have plans?\"\\n\\n \"I just assumed you wouldn\u0027t be going out. How long has it been since you\u0027ve had a date?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re getting off topic here.\"\\n\\n \"You just don\u0027t want to answer the question.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t had any real dates . . . or at least what you\u0027d call a date,\" she said in all honesty. She wondered what Charlotte would do if she told her about the sex with Liam. She\u0027d probably applaud, Allison concluded.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a pity,\" Charlotte consoled.\\n\\n Allison laughed. \"It kinda is. I\u0027m really happy you\u0027re here,\" she blurted. \"When do you have to go back to Seattle?\"\\n\\n \"Tuesday,\" she answered.\\n\\n \"About tonight . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n She tucked her cell phone in the crook of her neck and opened the yogurt container, then swallowed a spoonful before answering, \"I have to attend a cocktail party for one of my professors. It\u0027s at the Hamilton,\" she added. \"It starts at six thirty and I\u0027ll probably be there until eight.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027ll move our reservation back to eight thirty,\" Charlotte said. \"The Hamilton Hotel is just around the corner from the Four Seasons. It won\u0027t take you any time at all to get here.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure you wouldn\u0027t rather come to my apartment? We\u0027ll order pizza.\"\\n\\n \"No, every time we get together we eat pizza. Getting dressed up and dining out will be fun. You\u0027ll have to be dressed for the cocktail party anyway. Are you going to wear makeup? Do you have any? I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen you wearing lipstick or mascara in real life.\"\\n\\n That was probably true, even though Charlotte had seen the pictures from Giovanni\u0027s photo shoots. \"Yes, I have makeup, and yes, I\u0027ll wear makeup.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to be fun.\" Charlotte sounded so giddy she practically giggled her response.\\n\\n Allison smiled at her sister\u0027s enthusiasm. \"You don\u0027t get out much, do you?\"\\n\\n \"More than you.\"\\n\\n \"I want to ask you something.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I hate to ruin your good mood, but have you heard from Aunt Jane or Uncle Russell?\"\\n\\n \"No, not since Oliver and I cut them out of our lives. You should have done the same a long time ago.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Allison agreed. She rinsed the spoon under the faucet and dropped it in the dishwasher. \"I finally severed connections, but they keep harassing me. It\u0027s awful.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk about it tonight. Oliver and I have something to tell you, and we don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to like it. I\u0027ve got to go-\"\\n\\n \"Oh no, you don\u0027t. You can\u0027t say something like that and not tell me now.\"\\n\\n \"It has to be face-to-face.\"\\n\\n \"That means it\u0027s bad, right? I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I? Are you and Oliver having problems? You\u0027re not thinking of divorce, are you? Charlotte, you\u0027re never going to find anyone as sweet and patient as he is. Have you tried marriage counseling?\" Her imagination was getting away from her. \"He\u0027s perfect for you, and he\u0027s-\" \\n\\n Charlotte cut her off. \"No, dummy, we aren\u0027t getting divorced.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, good,\" Allison said with a sigh of relief. \"So now I have to think you\u0027re going to try to talk me out of something or into something. I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"See you tonight.\"\\n\\n Charlotte disconnected the call before Allison could coax her into explaining.\\n\\n Allison absolutely refused to worry about what Charlotte and Oliver wanted to talk to her about, so she did exactly that the rest of the day. She came up with all sorts of horrible things, and by the time she had showered, curled her hair, and applied makeup, she decided either Charlotte or Oliver was dying, or they were moving to some remote country and she would never see them again. She realized how mental she was acting, but she told herself she was just a worrier and not out of her mind.\\n\\n Time was getting away from her. She needed to hurry if she was going to make it to Father Basher\u0027s party on time. She opened her closet door and studied her clothes. Creating outfits was not one of her strengths, but luckily Giovanni had been a good teacher and she channeled his expertise now. She decided to wear one of her favorites, a short fitted dress the color of deep burgundy wine. The sleeves came to her elbows, and the hem of the rather tight skirt didn\u0027t quite reach her knees. The slit up one side, though provocative, was necessary so she could walk, but the scoop neckline was modest with only a hint of cleavage. Small hoop earrings and her delicate gold watch, a gift from Charlotte and Oliver, were her only accessories. She tried on two different pairs of heeled sandals before choosing. Standing in front of the full-length mirror, she surveyed her reflection and decided Giovanni would have approved. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-59.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \\n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
