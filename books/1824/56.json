{"id":87996,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"Liam had a lusty appetite and proceeded to kiss every inch of her. Most models were as thin as cardboard, but Allison had curves. Full, lush breasts, a narrow waist, perfect hips, and the longest shapely legs. Her ass was pretty damn near perfect, too. He kissed the valley between her breasts, and when his tongue glided across one nipple, she almost came off the bed. He took it into his mouth and began to suckle while he caressed her other breast. He moved lower. His tongue circled her navel. His hands were everywhere. He pushed her thighs apart and she thought foreplay was over. But she was wrong. He kissed her stomach, then slid lower. She sucked in her breath when his mouth and tongue began to make love so intimately. It was carnal, so shocking, so wonderful, she could feel herself losing control, and that terrified her. She cried out and tried to push him away, but he wouldn\u0027t be deterred. She was quickly consumed with desire. She understood what was happening; she just had never experienced it before. She came apart. Her orgasm took her by surprise and completely overwhelmed her. Wave after wave of intense pleasure poured over her. She clung to him and called his name. He knew the second she climaxed, so he moved up her body and kissed her hungrily as he thrust into her. She was wet, hot, and ready for him, and damn, she was tight. Once he was fully embedded, he forced himself to stop and give her time to adjust to him. \"Are you okay?\" Her nails dug into his shoulders. She could already feel the pressure building. \"Don\u0027t stop,\" she pleaded. \"Please don\u0027t stop.\" She wasn\u0027t sure if she shouted the demand or whispered it. Liam would have laughed if he hadn\u0027t been in such agony. \"Not a chance,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t stop.\" He loved the feel of her squeezing him, slowly withdrawing and then thrusting again and again, faster and faster. He kept telling himself to slow down, to savor the moment, but his body wasn\u0027t cooperating. Neither was she. She lifted her legs and wrapped them around him, taking him deeper inside, and then she began to moan. He knew she was close. His hand moved down between their bodies, and he caressed the spot he knew would drive her wild. She cried out, tightened around him, and climaxed again. He was there with her and found his own release. Allison felt as though she had reached the stars and was floating back to earth. It was the most amazing thing. Frightening, too, for she had lost all control. She realized then she had trusted him completely and was shocked how quickly that had happened. She was still holding on to him and never wanted to let go. As soon as the truth registered in her mind, she forced herself to pull back. Her arms fell to her sides. Her heart was still hammering in her chest, and she was still panting, trying to recover. Liam was having difficulty accepting what had just happened to him. He had had God knew how many orgasms but never one like this. As soon as she let go of him, he kissed her gently on the lips, then rolled away, got up, and went into the bathroom. He wasn\u0027t gone long. Allison was swinging her legs over the side of the bed and just about to stand when he grabbed her around the waist and pulled her down on top of him. \"Now you can be on top,\" he said, grinning. She stacked her hands on his chest, rested her chin on them, and stared at his handsome face. It seemed strange to her that she wasn\u0027t feeling at all unsure of herself or vulnerable now, and she didn\u0027t need praise or words of affection from him. He was rubbing her back and it felt wonderful. She was having trouble believing that she was stark naked and lying on top of a naked man. Not just any man, though, but Liam, who she decided was built like a Greek god, and at the moment was just about the sexiest man in the world. He was just so . . . male. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked, brushing a dangling strand of hair from her forehead. \"You have beautiful eyes,\" she said. \"Yeah?\" His hands moved down her spine, and he said, \"You\u0027ve got a great ass.\" She rolled her eyes. \"Only you would notice my backside.\" \"Every man you walk past notices, sweetheart.\" She laughed. \"You can\u0027t possibly know that.\" His devilish smile was back. \"Sure, I can. We discussed it. Everyone agreed. You\u0027ve got a great ass.\" His hand moved to the back of her neck, and he pulled her down to kiss her. His mouth covered hers, and his tongue moved inside to stroke her. \"I love the way you taste,\" he whispered before kissing her again. He couldn\u0027t get enough of her. He was already hard and all he wanted was to make love to her again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-56.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
