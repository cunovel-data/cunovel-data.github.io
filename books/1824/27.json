That\u0027s what would nail you.\" \"Yes, it would,\" she agreed. \"If you could find the file.\" \"You think we couldn\u0027t?\" \"I know you couldn\u0027t.\" Liam appreciated her arrogance. \"You\u0027re awfully confident, Allison,\" Alec remarked. \"None of it matters now, does it? Besides, I\u0027ve decided to quit. No more looking in on protected sites. I promise.\" \"Except you\u0027re going to help us,\" Liam reminded her. Allison didn\u0027t respond immediately. \"Yes, I\u0027ll help you with this problem, but . . . I\u0027m not going to commit to working for the FBI for an entire year. I have plans. As soon as I find your leak, I\u0027m gone. And no one else will know I\u0027ve done this. Agreed?\" It wasn\u0027t the deal they had hoped for, and Phillips wasn\u0027t going to like it, but Allison appeared to be resolute in her position. Liam nodded to Alec and then said, \"Agreed.\" Jordan walked into the living room and sat next to Allison on the sofa. \"I\u0027m assuming all the secret talk is over.\" \"I explained to them that, as soon as I get a chance, I\u0027ll tell you everything,\" Allison said. \"We don\u0027t want either one of you to talk about this outside this house. Got that?\" Alec warned. \"What about Noah? May I tell him?\" Jordan asked. \"You\u0027re going to anyway, aren\u0027t you?\" Allison wondered. Jordan nodded. \"Yes. I just thought it would be nice if I asked.\" \"For God\u0027s sake, Jordan,\" Alec said, \"this is serious.\" \"I know,\" she replied. \"Neither one of us is going to post this conversation on the Internet, and Allison doesn\u0027t need to tell me what the assignment is. I\u0027ve already guessed the obvious. You want her to catch a hacker, don\u0027t you?\" \"Something like that,\" Alec answered. \"Don\u0027t leave me out. I want to help.\" \"No, absolutely not,\" Allison said. \"If anything went wrong, you could get into trouble.\" \"So could you.\" \"I don\u0027t matter,\" she blurted, unaware how telling the comment was. \"Of course you matter. The FBI has given you immunity. You can\u0027t get into trouble.\" \"What I meant to say is that, if I were to get into trouble, I\u0027d deserve it. I\u0027ve broken the law. You haven\u0027t. Things have a way of getting messed up. It could be dangerous.\" \"How?\" \"What if the person or people I\u0027m going after find out who I am and come after me? It could happen,\" she insisted. Jordan turned to Liam. \"Are you running this?\" He nodded slowly. He kept his gaze on Allison and said, \"I\u0027m not going to let anything happen to you. You\u0027ll be safe.\" \"I still want to help,\" Jordan insisted. \"I\u0027ve got a better chance of searching without being detected. That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying,\" Allison said. The two of them began to argue in a language Liam had never heard before. It was computer talk on an incomprehensible level. \"What would you do, Jordan, if . . .\" was as much as Liam or Alec understood. As Liam listened to the two women debate the best ways of entering a secure site, he couldn\u0027t stop staring at Allison. She was beautiful, yes, but what held his attention was the way her mind worked. Alec interjected a thought into the discussion. \"You know, Allison, there are some people who have sold various bugs and viruses for a lot of money.\" \"I\u0027d never sell them,\" she protested. Allison\u0027s phone rang again. She muted it and didn\u0027t even bother to see who was calling. \"I\u0027m curious. How many viruses have you collected?\" Alec asked. \"Oh, you know.\" \"No, I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why I asked,\" Alec said. She started to blush. \"I\u0027d like to know, too,\" Liam said. \"A few?\" Alec asked. It was obvious she was embarrassed. \"More than a few.\" \"How many more than a few?\" Liam asked. \"Several?\" Alec asked. \"Or a bunch?\" Jordan nudged Allison and said, \"You\u0027ve already admitted that you have a file of viruses. You might as well tell them how many. They can\u0027t do anything to you.\" Eventually they would find out, Allison thought. If she just told them now, she\u0027d save time. \"Not including the ones I\u0027ve destroyed, I\u0027d say there\u0027re a hundred seventy or so in the file, give or take twenty or thirty.\" \"So . . . two hundred,\" Liam guessed. She nodded. \"Or thereabouts. Maybe a few more.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-27.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
