{"id":87990,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"While she was working, she was usually left alone. Phillips would saunter in every now and then to look over her shoulder at the monitor, but he rarely spoke to her. Occasionally she would notice employees walking by her office, and sometimes she would pass them in the hall, yet she never stopped to chat, nor did they try to engage her in conversation. Even though they weren\u0027t aware of her purpose for being there, no one expressed curiosity. She wondered if they had been ordered not to ask about the work others were doing.\n With each day that passed, she knew she was getting closer to the answer. Finding it was just a matter of time and persistence. By Friday afternoon of the second week, she sensed the end was in sight. She glanced up at the clock on the wall. It was getting late, and she prayed that Liam wouldn\u0027t appear at the door to stop her. She was so close. She narrowed her concentration on the screen and worked furiously, as though all her work would slip away if she lost focus for even one second. Suddenly there it was. Everything came together in one single spot. She found the source. The urge to jump up and shout was nearly overwhelming. She couldn\u0027t, of course, so she sat there and cheered silently.\n Now what? She could either go to Phillips and report what she had found, or wait for Liam and tell him. A no-brainer. She would wait. Phillips wasn\u0027t going to take the news well, no matter who told him. He had insisted it was impossible for her to trace the origin of the leaks back to the FBI-and he hated to be wrong. Besides, she had just seen Curtis Bale, the former head of the Detroit division, heading for Phillips\u0027s office. It wouldn\u0027t be such a good idea to rush in now and announce that she had identified the exact computer the breach had originated from and that it was located in Detroit.\n Impatient, she glanced up at the clock again. Where was Liam?\n While she waited, she was curious to look around and see what else she could find. Her fingers hovered over the keys. What would be the harm of checking out a few e-mails? Maybe there were other incriminating messages. She shook her head. As much as she wanted to snoop, she knew she couldn\u0027t go any further without permission, no matter how great the temptation. She had made up her mind not to break any more laws, and she meant to keep her promise.\n But making certain there weren\u0027t any more damning messages would be helping, wouldn\u0027t it?\n While she was having her moral debate-should she or shouldn\u0027t she?-Liam walked in. She nearly jumped out of her chair when she noticed him watching her. She was sure she looked as guilty as she felt. He, on the other hand, looked wonderful, but then, when didn\u0027t he? The man certainly knew how to wear a suit. Every time he gave her his full attention, her heart did a little flip. She wished she could make herself not care because she knew she was headed for misery. Thank God she hadn\u0027t gotten more involved with him. She could get over a couple of kisses. No big deal . . . right?\n \"Are you ready to leave? I\u0027d like to get out of here. It\u0027s been a long week,\" he said.\n She didn\u0027t ease into the news. \"I found it.\"\n His smile faded. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Show me.\" He pulled up a chair and sat next to her.\n \"I can show you the original e-mails, but explaining how I got to the source would take a long time.\" She didn\u0027t add her concern that he probably wouldn\u0027t understand what she was trying to explain anyway.\n \"I don\u0027t need to know how you got there,\" he said. \"Phillips and his team will want the step-by-step explanation.\"\n \"I know what he\u0027s going to do. He\u0027ll point to that chair, tell me to sit, and then question me for hours.\"\n More like days, Liam thought, but didn\u0027t say. \"That chair?\"\n \"You know. The one in his office. It\u0027s like he\u0027s training a dog.\"\n Liam put his arm on her shoulder, leaned toward the screen, and began to read the damning messages, examining each carefully as she scrolled through one and then another. He was so engrossed in what he was seeing he didn\u0027t realize he was absentmindedly stroking her upper arm.\n \"The e-mails came from Detroit,\" he said. \n \"Yes.\"\n She couldn\u0027t tell what he was thinking. His expression wasn\u0027t revealing anything, but when the muscle in his cheek flexed once, then again, she knew he was keeping his temper under control. When he finished reading, he looked at her intensely, which immediately messed with her ability to concentrate. How could one man have such a powerful effect on her?\n \"You did it, Allison. You got to the source. You should be proud of yourself.\"\n Uncomfortable with praise, probably because she\u0027d gotten so little of it in her life, she immediately downplayed her role. \"It took much longer than I had anticipated, and I\u0027m sure others wouldn\u0027t have taken as long.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-50.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
