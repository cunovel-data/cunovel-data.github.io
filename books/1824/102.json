Several seconds passed before she responded. \"You want me to lie for you.\"\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t be a lie,\" Jane insisted. \"No, no. We did give you a place to sleep, and we fed you.\"\\n\\n \"What happens if I don\u0027t go to court?\"\\n\\n Jane dabbed at the corners of her eyes, pretending to keep the tears at bay. \"We could end up in prison.\"\\n\\n \"Think of the positive,\" Allison said. \"You\u0027d get to see Will more often.\"\\n\\n Liam coughed to cover his laughter. He had to admit that the utter audacity of Jane and Russell\u0027s plea was impressive, but even more impressive was the way Allison stood up to them.\\n\\n \"You would let us go to prison?\" Jane demanded.\\n\\n The sneer that Allison was accustomed to seeing on her aunt\u0027s face was making its way to the surface once again. So much for acting timid, she thought. She went to the door and Liam opened it for her. \"It\u0027s time for you to leave,\" she ordered. \"Don\u0027t come here again. If you do, I\u0027ll get a restraining order and call the police. Now, get out.\"\\n\\n There was fire in her uncle\u0027s bloodshot eyes. \"You\u0027ll go to hell for this,\" he mumbled as he stormed past.\\n\\n Aunt Jane made it to the doorway and then stopped. \"Why are you doing this to us?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" Allison smiled. \"I guess I\u0027m just ungrateful.\" She slammed the door shut and fell back against it, taking a long, deep breath. When she was calm enough to speak again, she looked at Liam. \"I\u0027m sorry you had to see that,\" she apologized.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" he said. \"I\u0027m very proud of you.\"\\n\\n \"Proud?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he answered. \"You stood up to them, and they deserved it. The way I figure it, there are three kinds of people. The first kind are the good people who mostly do good things with their lives. The second are good people who sometimes get off track and do bad things. And then the third kind are the bad people who do bad things. I\u0027d put your aunt and uncle in that category. I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll ever see the error of their ways.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m sure they still think they can badger me. I haven\u0027t heard the last of them.\" She straightened her shoulders. \"But I can handle it,\" she said with assurance.\\n\\n \"Good girl,\" Liam said as he gave her a hug.\\n\\n He went to the desk for his gun. As he was strapping it on, a text came into his phone. He glanced at the screen. \"I\u0027ve got to go,\" he said without explanation. He slipped the phone back into his pocket and then walked over to give her a quick kiss. \"Sorry. I\u0027ve got to take care of something. You said you had a question. Can it wait?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Allison said, resignedly.\\n\\n And once again she watched him leave.\\n\\n -\\n\\n Her job saved her from dwelling on Liam, and fortunately at night, once she turned on her new laptop, she could still escape into her work, and the world swirling around her ceased to exist.\\n\\n She was back to two agents driving her to and from work, but now she knew most of them and enjoyed their company. Her assignments had become intense, many involving missing funds, and she had to stay late nearly every night.\\n\\n Jordan had seen the photo of Allison\u0027s crunched car-Noah got it from Alec, who had gotten it from Liam. She called to commiserate.\\n\\n Allison\u0027s greeting wasn\u0027t the usual. \"Men still suck.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-oh. Should I come over?\" \\n\\n \"No. I was just making a statement of fact. What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Your car. Tell me what happened.\"\\n\\n \"You already know what happened. I told you about it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but I just now saw the photo. I can\u0027t believe you walked away from that crash. My God, you hit a tree stump and then flipped and flipped. . . .\"\\n\\n Allison laughed. \"I know. I was there.\"\\n\\n They spent a half hour discussing the horrible crash. Then Allison said, \"I\u0027ve got to get going. I\u0027ll talk to you soon.\"\\n\\n \"Wait. Did you want to embellish on your opening remark?\" Jordan asked, trying to be diplomatic.\\n\\n \"No, not now.\"\\n\\n Allison worked another hour and then went to bed. She was thankful Jordan hadn\u0027t asked any questions about Liam. Maybe she already knew that the nonrelationship was over. Regardless, Allison wasn\u0027t ready to talk about him. Her emotions were still too raw.\\n\\n Just as she was drifting off to sleep, her phone rang. Her uncle Russell was on the line and was so drunk his words were slurred. He wanted her to know what an ungrateful bitch she was. All of his misery was her fault. She agreed just to get him to stop, but that didn\u0027t work. She could hear her aunt Jane screeching like a colony of bats in the background. The sound was ear-piercing. Allison ended the call in the middle of one of his colorful threats. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-102.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \\n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
