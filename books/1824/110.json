I know you want to.\"\n He did exactly that. Once he calmed down, she explained that she was still going to run her company with Jordan. \"Please don\u0027t tell Phillips.\"\n \"He\u0027s going to notice when you keep coming to work.\"\n \"He\u0027s going to gloat.\"\n \"Yes, he will.\"\n \"The working conditions will have to change, of course. I\u0027m only going to be available part-time. And I don\u0027t want him pointing to the chair any longer. It\u0027s just plain rude.\"\n \"He loves pointing. You\u0027re going to take that away from him?\"\n She sighed. \"Okay, I\u0027ll let him point to the chair.\"\n \"You\u0027re such a pushover,\" he laughed.\n \"Hey!\" She jabbed his shoulder with her finger.\n Liam grabbed her hand and kissed it. \"When will you tell Charlotte you\u0027re going to stay in Boston?\"\n \"About that . . .\"\n \"You want me to tell her.\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell her we\u0027re getting married first, and then I\u0027ll slip in that we\u0027re staying in Boston. I\u0027ll probably blame you.\"\n \"That\u0027s fine with me. Are you going to tell her you finally confronted your aunt and uncle and really let them have it?\"\n \"Probably,\" she said. \"Letting them have it didn\u0027t seem to do any good. They\u0027re both still calling. Uncle Russell is always drunk and always shouting.\"\n \"You\u0027ve done enough,\" he said. \"I\u0027m begging you. Let me have a turn. I can get them to stop. I promise.\"\n \"Sure. Why not? Take a turn. Then they can start calling your number.\"\n \"No, they won\u0027t,\" he said with complete confidence.\n \"You mentioned with your promotion you can take a step back and let other agents you\u0027ve trained handle more of the work.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n She raised herself up on her elbow and propped her chin in her hand so she could stare into his amazing green eyes. \"And exactly what is that work?\"\n He answered, \"Maybe someday when we\u0027re old and gray, and we\u0027re rocking on the front porch watching our grandchildren, I\u0027ll tell you all about it.\"\n She kissed him on the cheek and laid her head back down on his chest. For the first time in her life she knew how it felt to love and be loved.\n \"Sounds good to me,\" she whispered. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-110.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
