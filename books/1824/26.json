I think I can be pretty accurate.\"\n \"There couldn\u0027t be that many more,\" Alec commented.\n If he only knew. Should she pretend to agree? She decided to keep silent.\n \"You\u0027ve never looked in on any federal agency?\" Alec asked, clearly skeptical.\n \"You\u0027ve already asked me that. No, never. That would be breaking the law.\" She rushed to explain, \"I know. I\u0027m not making any sense. I broke the law every time I entered a bank\u0027s or a credit card company\u0027s system, but I felt I was helping them. Going into the FBI or any other federal agency wouldn\u0027t be helping.\"\n \"Anything else you want to tell us? Now\u0027s your chance. You\u0027ve got immunity,\" Liam reminded her.\n Should she tell them about the hackers who\u0027d stolen from the nursing home residents? It had happened three years ago. She thought she was safe, but there was always the chance that someone would come along and figure out she was the one who had gone after them. \"There are a few other things I\u0027ve done.\"\n \"Be specific.\"\n \"Now or never, Allison,\" Alec said. \"What else have you done?\"\n \"When I said I had never taken any money . . . that wasn\u0027t exactly true,\" she admitted. \n Alec and Liam leaned forward expectantly.\n She took a deep breath, then said, \"I stole thirty-eight million dollars and sent an e-mail to the FBI telling them where they could access the funds.\"\n Liam seemed to take the announcement in stride. Did anything faze him? Alec, on the other hand, looked shocked.\n \"Thirty-eight . . . ,\" Alec began, then stopped.\n \"Million,\" she supplied.\n She explained everything, from the nursing home segment on the news to the e-mail she\u0027d sent. Alec said he hadn\u0027t heard of the hacking. Liam didn\u0027t respond. He seemed to be studying her as he listened to her recount the details.\n \"Did they get the hackers?\" Alec asked.\n \"Yes,\" she answered. \"It was on the news, but it all happened a long time ago.\"\n \"About three years ago,\" Liam added.\n \"Then you knew about it?\"\n \"I read a report on it,\" he answered. \"A lot of people tried to take credit for getting that money back. None of them could tell the investigators what was said in the e-mail sent to the director, though.\"\n \"Do you remember what it said?\" Alec asked Liam.\n He nodded. \"Yeah, I do. It made me laugh.\"\n \"What was so funny?\" Allison wanted to know.\n \"Prove you did it,\" Alec urged. \"Tell us what the e-mail said.\"\n She didn\u0027t hesitate. \"\u0026lsquo;You\u0027re welcome.\u0027\"\n Alec looked at Liam, who nodded. \"That\u0027s right,\" he confirmed.\n \"Any other chunks of money you\u0027ve liberated?\" Alec asked.\n \"Yes, and each time I gave specific instructions on how to locate the hackers. And proof so they would go to prison.\"\n \"What about the money?\"\n \"I told the FBI where they could find it.\"\n \"I\u0027m curious,\" Alec said. \"How much money-the total?\"\n \"Around eighty million.\"\n They both looked incredulous.\n Alec had a good laugh and, shaking his head, said, \"You\u0027re lucky you have immunity.\"\n Jordan entered the room as Alec was speaking. Hands on her hips, she snapped, \"But you did promise her immunity, and you\u0027re not going to take it back.\" When they all turned to look at her, she defended her eavesdropping. \"What? You didn\u0027t think I wouldn\u0027t find out what was going on, did you? The house is still empty. Sound echoes,\" she protested with indignation.\n \"Don\u0027t get all worked up,\" Alec said, exasperated. \"I was just saying what could happen if she didn\u0027t have immunity.\"\n \"Stop trying to scare her. What she did might have been illegal, but not a serious crime. She didn\u0027t cause any harm. Nobody goes to jail for looking.\"\n \"Does she seem scared to you?\" Liam asked.\n Jordan frowned. \"Okay, she doesn\u0027t. Allison, don\u0027t let them bully you into doing anything you don\u0027t want to do.\"\n \"I won\u0027t,\" she assured her. \"Alec, there\u0027s another way of looking at this situation. If for whatever reason you were to take away immunity and decide to arrest me, what evidence do you really have? I could explain that I was telling you a story. I could say that I made it all up to show off,\" she added with a nod. \"You don\u0027t have any proof that I\u0027ve done anything wrong.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-26.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
