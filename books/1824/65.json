{"id":88005,"no":65,"title":"Page 65","content":"Liam could see the resemblance between the sisters. They had the same high cheekbones and blue eyes. Their smiles were almost identical, too. But there were a couple of distinct differences. Charlotte had light brown hair and Allison\u0027s was a deep, lush sable. Charlotte was the scrubbed girl next door, pretty, with freckles on her cheeks, while Allison was a stunning beauty with flawless skin. There was only one other big difference. Charlotte didn\u0027t turn him on the way Allison did. Charlotte hadn\u0027t said anything yet. When she finally stopped staring at Liam, she turned toward Allison with wide, questioning eyes. Obviously astonished to see her sister with a man, she interrogated her with one look. Allison read the signals loud and clear. She knew Charlotte was dying to find out about him. There was little that Allison had ever done in her life that surprised her sister, and she loved watching the expressions that were skipping across Charlotte\u0027s face now. Oliver drew his wife\u0027s attention. While they discussed what they wanted to drink, Allison picked up the glass she\u0027d emptied and frowned. Then she looked at Liam. \"What happened to the ice?\" she whispered. \"You swallowed it.\" He didn\u0027t look as though he was joking. Okay, so she was flustered and hadn\u0027t been paying attention to what she was doing. \"I was thirsty,\" she rationalized in a flimsy excuse to hide her embarrassment. Charlotte couldn\u0027t hold her curiosity any longer. She looked at Liam, then back at Allison. \"How did you two meet?\" \"I did some computer work for him.\" \"And you\u0027ve known each other long?\" Charlotte asked. \"Not long,\" Allison answered. The sisters had never had any secrets between them, and Allison sensed Charlotte\u0027s irritation at not being told about Liam. There was one other secret that Allison was keeping. Charlotte persisted with one question after another, but Allison was evasive with her answers because she didn\u0027t want her sister to know about the deal she had struck to keep their cousin out of prison. If Charlotte knew, she\u0027d have thrown a fit. Unlike Allison, she had absolutely no sympathy for Will. Her attitude was set. He had made his bed and he should have to wallow in it. Oliver changed the subject. \"Allison, when are you moving? Maybe we can fly down and help you get settled.\" \"She\u0027s moving to Santa Clara right after graduation,\" Charlotte explained. \"Allison, I\u0027m so sorry we can\u0027t be there to see you graduate. If we could change our schedules . . .\" \"It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s no big deal. Honest,\" she said. \"And, Oliver, I\u0027m putting off the move for another six months. I\u0027m going to do some work for the government.\" \"Do it from California. All you need is your laptop.\" \"No, I have to work here.\" \"Why?\" Charlotte asked. Allison felt like groaning. Her sister wasn\u0027t going to give up. \"Because I gave my word, and I\u0027m going to sign a contract.\" More questions resulted from that bit of honesty, and Liam watched Allison bob and weave like a pro, sometimes giving only half answers. After five more questions were asked and partially answered, he decided Charlotte could work for the CIA. She was tenacious with her inquisition. A break came when the waiter reappeared. While Oliver and Charlotte talked to him, Liam leaned down and whispered, \"I\u0027m getting the idea you don\u0027t want your sister to know you helped your cousin.\" \"You promised not to say a word,\" Allison whispered back with a warning glance. \"Promise what?\" Charlotte asked. She didn\u0027t just have the persistence of a honey badger; she had the hearing of a bat, too. Allison decided she was tired of being the center of attention and was determined to get the upper hand. Liam ordered another club soda, and she said she\u0027d like one, too. Then she sat back, smiled at her sister, and said, \"Liam\u0027s from Australia.\" She waved her hand in the air. \"Discuss.\" Allison was sure Charlotte would have a hundred questions. She didn\u0027t have a single one. Still determined to find out every detail in Allison\u0027s contract, she persevered. \"Will you please let it go?\" Allison pleaded in exasperation. \"Just help me understand why you would want to sign a contract. Have you forgotten your plan to move to California?\" Oliver\u0027s cell phone interrupted. \"I\u0027ve got to take this,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" Allison waited until he\u0027d left the bar, then said, \"Oliver looks rested.\" She was hoping to turn Charlotte\u0027s attention yet again. \"He must like his job.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-65.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
