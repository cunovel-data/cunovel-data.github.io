Did he actually believe that would be an incentive? \"As enticing as that is, I\u0027m still going to decline.\"\n Phillips came around the desk. \"I hope you\u0027ll reconsider.\"\n She shook his hand, then Scott\u0027s, while she thanked both of them for letting her see a little of the cyber unit. There was only one problem with a quick exit: Agent Scott wouldn\u0027t let go of her. She tugged; he pulled. \"Is there a problem?\" It was difficult to tell what was going on behind his smile.\n \"I was hoping you could answer a couple of questions before you left,\" he replied. \"I guess I could ask them tonight.\"\n Oh no. After this encounter, there was no way she was going to Jordan\u0027s tonight. She decided to keep that information to herself and play along. \"Yes, you could ask me then. Are you about ready to let go of me, Agent Scott?\"\n \"Liam.\"\n Phillips drew her attention. \"There is one thing we need to know before you go.\"\n She turned to him. \"Yes?\"\n \"Have you ever hacked into a government agency?\"\n The question shocked her. She wasn\u0027t prepared for it. \"No,\" she answered emphatically. Technically she was telling the truth. She had e-mailed the FBI with sensitive information, but she had never broken into their system.\n \"FBI? CIA? NSA?\"\n \"You can go through the alphabet if you want. The answer is still no. I haven\u0027t hacked into any government agencies. It\u0027s against the law.\"\n \"Never?\"\n \"Never,\" she insisted.\n \"If you had, would you admit it to a federal agent?\"\n He had her there. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Now you understand the need for a lie detector test.\"\n \"Sure, I do. I\u0027m still not taking one.\"\n \"Because?\"\n It seemed to her that they were back where they started. \"Because I don\u0027t want to work here.\"\n \"About the government agencies . . . ,\" Phillips said.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"You\u0027ve really never hacked . . .\"\n How obtuse was the man? \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\n \"Could you?\"\n He posed the question just as she skirted past Liam and headed for the door. She turned around and said, \"I\u0027ve never tried.\"\n Liam shook his head. \"That\u0027s not what he was asking. Could you?\"\n She decided to be honest, no matter how arrogant she sounded. \"Probably.\" She thought about it another couple of seconds, then added, \"Yes, I\u0027m sure I could. Happy now?\"\n Liam grinned. \"You have no idea.\"\n SIX\n Allison wanted to find out why she was being interrogated, but her curiosity was overridden by her desire to escape. Liam Scott\u0027s piercing green eyes were staring intensely into hers, yet giving nothing away. \n \"Let me guess. You\u0027re not going to explain,\" she said.\n \"No, not now,\" Liam said. He opened the door for her. \"We\u0027ll talk tonight, and you can ask as many questions as you\u0027d like.\"\n \"Will you answer them?\"\n \"Yes,\" he assured her. \"I\u0027ll pick you up at seven.\"\n Before she could argue and tell him she wasn\u0027t going anywhere with him at seven tonight or any other night, Agent Phillips spoke up. \"Trust me, Allison. I\u0027ll find a way to convince you. I think you\u0027ll enjoy working here.\"\n She shook her head to let him know she disagreed, and when she turned back, Liam was gone.\n \"Would you like to see the rest of the facility now?\" Phillips offered.\n \"No, thank you.\"\n She didn\u0027t wait for an escort. Quickly exiting Phillips\u0027s office, she located Jordan and convinced her it was time to leave. When they were finally alone in the car, Allison began to grill her.\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about Agent Scott?\"\n \"Who\u0027s Agent Scott?\"\n \"Liam Scott.\"\n Jordan drove through the gates and onto the road before glancing over at Allison. \"I don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t know they checked up on me and planned this whole visit to get me out here?\"\n Jordan looked completely befuddled. \"What?\"\n \"Liam Scott is coming to your home tonight for dinner, and he thinks he\u0027s picking me up at seven and bringing me along.\"\n Since they were driving on a deserted gravel road, Jordan didn\u0027t bother to pull over. She stopped the car and turned to her friend. \"What do you mean, he\u0027s coming over for dinner?\"\n Before Allison could respond, Jordan said, \"Take a breath and tell me what happened. Start at the beginning and try to make sense.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-16.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
