For the most part we ignored each other . . . that is, until he needed the money I could bring in.\"\n \"You had a hell of a time growing up, didn\u0027t you?\"\n She stiffened. \"Don\u0027t feel sorry for me. It wasn\u0027t all bad, and I got away with a lot. As long as I didn\u0027t bother them and I stayed out of trouble, I could do whatever I wanted. And as long as my sister was around, I was okay.\"\n \"What about when she wasn\u0027t around?\" he asked quietly.\n \"I was more cautious,\" she said. \"I took care of myself,\" she added before abruptly changing the subject. \"How soon will my aunt and uncle find out that Will is going to get probation?\"\n \"Tomorrow or the day after. What happens when he screws up again, Allison?\"\n \"You\u0027ve already asked me that question.\"\n \"I\u0027m asking again.\"\n She knew he wanted to make sure she wouldn\u0027t waver. \"He\u0027s on his own if he messes up. I haven\u0027t changed my mind. I\u0027m done. I promise.\"\n They were just a couple of blocks from her house when Liam said, \"If your uncle is still sitting out front, I\u0027m going to talk to him.\"\n \"No, I\u0027ll handle him. You don\u0027t need to fight my wars for me.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m talking to him,\" he insisted. \"And if he\u0027s behind the wheel and has been drinking, he\u0027s going to be spending the night in lockup.\"\n The set of his jaw indicated he was going to be stubborn, and when they turned the corner to her street, she was relieved. Fortunately her uncle had left. She was thankful there wouldn\u0027t be a confrontation. \n Liam walked her to the door and once again held most of the contents of her purse while she searched for her house key. As soon as she got the key in the lock, he turned to leave.\n \"I\u0027ll pick you up at eight,\" he said.\n \"I can drive myself. I have GPS. I won\u0027t get lost.\"\n \"I\u0027m still picking you up at eight.\"\n Thoroughly confused, she asked, \"Why?\"\n He walked back to her. \"Because I want to.\"\n The mood changed the closer he got to her. They stood in the shadows staring at each other, and Allison wondered if he would kiss her again.\n Liam was wondering how he was going to keep away from her. Did she have any idea how seductive she was? He couldn\u0027t stop staring at her mouth, remembering how soft her lips were and how sweet she tasted.\n \"Thank you for dinner,\" she said without taking her eyes away from his.\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\" His voice was gruff.\n He told himself to turn around and walk away, but he couldn\u0027t make himself do it. What was happening to him? He\u0027d never had any problems with women before. Allison was different, though. She was messing with his head, and he doubted she even realized it.\n \"Are you going to kiss me?\"\n \"No.\"\n His abrupt answer should have embarrassed her, but it didn\u0027t. \"You looked like you were about to kiss me.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Why not?\" She sounded disgruntled.\n The blunt question made him smile. \"I\u0027m trying to keep my distance.\"\n \"And I\u0027m making that difficult for you.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"In my defense, you\u0027re making it difficult for me, too.\"\n \"Yeah? How\u0027s that?\"\n \"Mixed signals,\" she said, nodding. \"You say you don\u0027t want to get involved, and the next minute you\u0027re grabbing me and kissing me crazy.\"\n She had a point there. The last time he had brought her home, he was bouncing back and forth between doing the right thing and acting like a teenager with out-of-control hormones. \"You\u0027re right. From now on we keep this on a professional level. Understand?\"\n \"Absolutely. And just so you know, I don\u0027t usually throw myself at men.\"\n She stared at him expectantly, seeming to need his agreement. \"Yeah, okay,\" he responded.\n \"What happened before was as much my fault as it was yours,\" she explained very matter-of-factly. \"For as long as I\u0027m your asset, we\u0027ll keep a professional relationship. I promise I won\u0027t let you kiss me again. I have more self-control than you do.\"\n \"You think so, huh?\"\n \"Absolutely.\"\n He leaned down and whispered in her ear, \"Wanna bet?\"\n TWELVE\n Allison now understood what lust was all about. No wonder it was such a sin. According to the militant sisters at St. Dominic\u0027s High School, it was one of the worst offenses, the burning-in-hell kind. Until Liam came along, she had never felt such a raw physical reaction. With him everything was different. He was masculine and sexy and strong, and oh, did he know how to make her want him! All he had to do was look at her a certain way and she felt she was melting inside. Being with him even topped writing code, and how freaky was that? These feelings were so completely foreign to her she didn\u0027t quite know what to do about them . . . except keep them to herself. They had agreed their relationship should be a professional one, and she was determined to prove she could be sensible and focus on the work. Liam certainly didn\u0027t seem to have any trouble with it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-48.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
