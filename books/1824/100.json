She could see the weariness in his eyes.\n \"Allison, I\u0027m afraid our talk is going to have to wait,\" he said.\n \"Answer my question. When did you get back from Berlin?\"\n \"A week ago.\"\n TWENTY-FIVE\n A week? He\u0027d been back in Boston seven days and nights and hadn\u0027t bothered to call her? What was the matter with him? Didn\u0027t he have any idea how much he was hurting her? No, of course not. How could he know? He was an idiot.\n Any other woman would have thrown her hands up and moved on. She had tried, but, fortunately or unfortunately, she wasn\u0027t any other woman. It was time for her to find some courage and confront him, and that wasn\u0027t going to be easy. If he didn\u0027t like what she had to say, would she be able to walk away? What if he rejected her? She thought about that possibility for a few minutes and then decided, yes, it would be devastating, but then at least she would know, and she could then figure out a way to put him out of her life.\n Her mind was cluttered with worries while she showered and got ready for bed. Every time she thought about barreling down the hill in her car, she felt sick to her stomach. Time to lose herself in her laptop, she concluded. It was the only way she knew to disappear from the world. And then she remembered her laptop had been destroyed, and she was going to have to buy a new one. Thankfully, she had external backups of all her work.\n She walked into the living room and came to a quick stop. Liam was still there. He was standing at the window, staring out into the night. He seemed to be deep in thought. His phone was in his hand, and every once in a while he glanced down at it. \n \"I thought you\u0027d left.\"\n He didn\u0027t look at her when he answered, \"No.\" He was staring at his phone again and shaking his head. \"Know what I\u0027m looking at?\" He walked over to her and handed her his phone.\n She looked at the photo and cringed. It was her car, or rather the remains of her car, at the bottom of that hill.\n \"You could have broken your neck.\" He sounded angry, but his hands were gentle when he took her by the shoulders. \"You should have bruises all over your body.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t,\" she assured him. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n He didn\u0027t let go of her. His hands slid down her shoulders and rested on the buttons of her silk pajamas. Then he kissed the side of her neck. As his kisses slowly made their way down to her breasts, he unbuttoned her top.\n When she let out a low gasp, he swept her up in his arms and carried her to the bed. They were ravenous for each other, and there was no slowing down once the passion between them was ignited.\n \"Am I hurting you?\" he panted. \"I\u0027ll stop if I\u0027m hurting you.\"\n \"No, no. Don\u0027t stop,\" she demanded, and then she bit his earlobe, and he was lost.\n They reached climax at the same time. She squeezed him tight and cried out. Liam groaned before collapsing on top of her. His head dropped to her shoulder as he took deep breaths, trying to recover.\n \"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" He was breathing hard.\n She was still reeling. \"Yes,\" she said with a sigh.\n He finally found enough energy to move before he crushed her. He rolled to his back but kept her locked in his arms. He couldn\u0027t seem to make himself let go of her.\n \"I\u0027ve never lost control the way I do with you,\" he confessed.\n \"You make that sound like a bad thing.\"\n He shrugged. \"It is what it is.\"\n What\u0027s that supposed to mean? she wondered. Liam got out of bed then, grabbed his clothes, and went into the bathroom.\n \"Here we go again,\" she muttered. Would he say, \"See you later,\" or nothing at all? Oh no, not this time. There was no way she was going to let him walk out the door without acknowledging a few things first.\n He came out of the bathroom, all buttoned up and tucked in, ready to leave. He seemed preoccupied. She suddenly became furious. All he had to do was leave a little money on her dresser to make her feel like a call girl. She grabbed her robe, put it on, and chased him into the living room. \"Please don\u0027t leave just yet. I want to ask you a question.\"\n She wasn\u0027t given time to ask it. Stamos was knocking on the door and calling Allison\u0027s name. She tightened her robe and opened the door a crack.\n The doorman didn\u0027t ease into his news. \"Those maniacs are downstairs again. They\u0027re very upset.\"\n \"Enough already. Wait ten minutes and then send them up, please.\"\n Muttering to herself, she rushed into the bedroom to get dressed. \"I\u0027m through being patient. They aren\u0027t going to go away without a fight, and by God, I\u0027m going to give them one.\" She called to Liam in the living room, \"You should probably leave. Otherwise, you\u0027ll have to arrest me when I start punching them.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-100.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
