{"id":88007,"no":67,"title":"Page 67","content":"Seeing that he was entering uncomfortable territory and not wanting to cause Allison further embarrassment, Oliver halted his condemnation of her aunt and uncle. \"The clerk I talked to was in foster care, and boy, did he sympathize! He took the folder and all the legal papers to a young, new judge, and the clerk is sure he\u0027ll sign the order.\" Allison grabbed Liam\u0027s glass and took a drink. \"What order?\" \"Our aunt and uncle will have to account for the five hundred thousand dollars,\" Charlotte answered. \"We know where three hundred thousand went. It took some digging, but we found what we were looking for.\" \"\u0026lsquo;We\u0027?\" Allison asked. Charlotte glanced at her husband before answering, \"Okay, I found what I was looking for. I won\u0027t tell you how I found out, because it might not be legal and there\u0027s an FBI agent sitting at the table.\" \"What did you find out?\" \"They didn\u0027t own that house. They rented, and as soon as they got the insurance money, they purchased it. Uncle Russell paid off all their other debts, too. They owed almost a hundred thousand dollars to credit card companies and department stores. They even had a tab running at the neighborhood liquor store. I\u0027m guessing the rest went to whatever Will wanted. And lawyer fees, of course. They sure didn\u0027t spend a penny on either one of us.\" Allison wasn\u0027t impressed by the threat of a court order. \"They won\u0027t tell where the money went. They\u0027ll make up stuff.\" \"With receipts. They have to prove each expense with receipts,\" Oliver explained. It was completely unrealistic, Allison decided. A good attorney was all her aunt and uncle needed to make it go away. When she voiced her reservation, another debate ensued, and it continued until the hostess came to collect them for their table. Oliver and Charlotte led the way to the dining room, but Allison hung back and lowered her voice for Liam. \"I\u0027ll understand if you want to take off. You could maybe stop by tomorrow, and I\u0027ll make the changes in the contract then.\" His response to her suggestion was to take her hand and pull her along. \"I\u0027m not at all hungry,\" she said then. \"The six club sodas fill you up?\" \"I didn\u0027t . . .\" She stopped and gave him a quizzical look. \"Did I?\" He nodded. \"I was distracted.\" \"I know.\" Ever since they were little girls, Charlotte had possessed a strong sense of right and wrong, and she had been willing to act on it. Allison loved that about her, but this time her sister\u0027s need for justice had consequences, and Allison wondered if she truly understood what she had done. \"I just wish Charlotte would leave it alone,\" she whispered. Her sister heard her, of course, and once they were seated offered her take on the situation. \"You\u0027re such a peacemaker, Allison, but sometimes you have to take a stand. I won\u0027t feel bad for doing the right thing.\" \"Good for you, Charlotte,\" Allison retorted. \"When are these legal papers going to be sent?\" Charlotte looked at Oliver, who answered, \"The court will have to investigate, and knowing how these things work, I expect it could take some time. Maybe weeks. Maybe months.\" Allison leaned back in her chair and folded her arms defiantly, fixing her gaze on Charlotte. \"Then I have one question for you.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Where will you be when our aunt and uncle receive the notice?\" \"In Seattle, I assume,\" Charlotte answered with a slight shrug at stating the obvious. \"Exactly. And where will I be?\" she asked. \"Here in Boston,\" her sister said. Allison paused to give her sister time to comprehend the implications of what she was saying and then asked, \"So, who do you think they\u0027ll come after?\" SIXTEEN Dinner was a trial of endurance for Allison, but Liam seemed to be having a good time. He and Oliver talked football, and both men couldn\u0027t have been more enthusiastic about the sport. Allison pushed her fish around on her plate, and although it was quite tasty, she could eat only a couple of bites. Her stomach wouldn\u0027t settle, and it didn\u0027t help that Charlotte kept bringing up the relatives from hell. \"Do you know what Oliver found out about Will?\" Charlotte asked. She took a bite of her pasta and waited for Allison to answer. \"Can we please not talk about any of them?\" \"Okay, but you have to hear this.\" Allison gave up. \"What did you find out, Oliver?\" \"Will\u0027s going to get probation.\" \"Can you believe it?\" Charlotte asked. She took another bite of pasta and said, \"Oliver, you have to taste this. It\u0027s delicious.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-67.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
