It\u0027s still readable.\" He handed the first sheet of paper to Allison and sat back while she read through it. \"What it boils down to-,\" he began. \"He\u0027d like to own me for six months, and he has the option to add another month or two or three, should he feel I\u0027m needed.\" \"That\u0027s about right.\" \"I\u0027m not signing this.\" She\u0027d sounded so outraged he couldn\u0027t help smiling. \"I\u0027m not suggesting that you do. Let\u0027s go through it line by line and change what you want changed. I\u0027ll have the new one typed up tomorrow and you can sign it.\" \"Do I need a lawyer?\" she asked, and before he could answer her question, she said, \"I probably need a lawyer.\" \"I\u0027m a lawyer. I\u0027ll look out for you.\" \"You\u0027re a lawyer?\" She sounded suspicious. \"Yes.\" He didn\u0027t give her any more information. Frowning, she said, \"Okay, you\u0027re a lawyer. But you work for him.\" \"Him?\" \"Phillips.\" \"No, I don\u0027t work for him. Alec and I brought you in, and we won\u0027t let him take advantage of you. Do you trust me?\" \"Yes.\" He pulled her chair closer, handed her a pen, and said, \"Let\u0027s get started.\" Allison held the pages close to the candle as she pored over the document, crossing out a phrase here, changing a word there. The candlelight cast a beautiful glow on her perfect features, and Liam was finding it difficult to focus. He tried not to be distracted, but damn, it was difficult. Her scent, a blend of flowers and sunshine, was messing with his concentration. \"What did you say?\" His voice was gruff. She looked up at him. \"I didn\u0027t say anything.\" Liam\u0027s mouth was just inches from hers, and he thought it might be a good idea to kiss her. She had the same idea. Her gaze never left his mouth as she inched closer and closed her eyes. She could feel his breath on her lips, and she parted her own in anticipation. Her heart pounded in her chest, just as- \"A Diet Coke and a club soda.\" Allison\u0027s eyes snapped open to see the waiter set the tall glasses on cocktail napkins. His eyes were downcast as though he had just witnessed something he shouldn\u0027t have. She gave him a weak smile before he pivoted and hurried back to the bar. Feeling the blood rush to her face, she picked up her glass and downed every bit of her drink. \"You\u0027re kind of flustered, aren\u0027t you?\" Liam asked with an impish grin. He was obviously enjoying her mortification. \"No, I\u0027m not. Not at all.\" \"You just drank my club soda.\" She looked at the empty glass in front of her. She didn\u0027t think her face could have felt any hotter, and she put her hand to her cheek to see if it was burning. Liam\u0027s smile wasn\u0027t helping any. After a deep breath, she said, \"Shall we get back to this?\" She finished making changes to the first page and, after setting it aside, began on the second. Liam\u0027s arm was on the back of her chair, and as he examined the contract with her, he stroked her neck. She couldn\u0027t tell if it was a sign of affection or an absentminded gesture. All she was sure of was that he was making her task extremely difficult, but it felt too good to make him stop. She finally handed him the pen and the pages. \"Did Phillips really think I would sign this?\" \"I\u0027m sure he knew it was a long shot.\" He put the contract back in the envelope. \"I\u0027ll have this retyped and you can sign it when you start Monday.\" \"No, that would give Phillips time to sneak in a few surprises I might not notice. It will only take a few minutes to revise it on my laptop and print it out. I\u0027d like you to give him a signed contract so it\u0027s a done deal before I start.\" \"Are we interrupting?\" Allison jumped when she heard her sister\u0027s voice and then immediately felt guilty. She hadn\u0027t done anything wrong, and she was being foolish acting as though she had. She was simply sitting in a bar with a man, a very attractive man. Okay, she had had sex with him the night before . . . lots of sex . . . but Charlotte didn\u0027t know that. Allison hugged her sister and kissed Oliver on his cheek, then quickly introduced Liam. When he stood to shake Oliver\u0027s hand, he towered over him. Oliver was stocky but solid in build, and his sturdy handshake was accompanied by a genuine smile. Behind his wire-rimmed glasses were eyes that revealed a keen intelligence and an affable nature. \"They\u0027ll come get us when our table is ready,\" Oliver said. \"We\u0027re early.\" He pulled out a chair for his wife.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-64.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
