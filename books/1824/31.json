She wondered when he\u0027d started or if this was just a continuation from partying the night before.\n He wasn\u0027t much for proper greetings. He took a drink of his beer, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said, \"My mother snaps her fingers and you come running.\"\n Allison wasn\u0027t offended, and she wasn\u0027t going to let him bait her into an argument. \"No, Will. She calls and calls and calls until I give in and do what she wants.\" \n \"She makes you feel guilty.\" He laughed after stating the obvious.\n \"Yes, she does,\" she admitted. \"Why are you here?\"\n \"I want a new lawyer.\"\n \"Then get a new one.\"\n \"My lazy-ass lawyer says it won\u0027t matter how many lawyers I hire. None of them can get the charges reduced. You know what happened, don\u0027t you?\"\n She shook her head. She knew what he was going to tell her, though. None of what happened was his fault.\n \"I really got screwed,\" he said. \"I\u0027m the one who was attacked at the bar. I didn\u0027t start the fight. I just protected myself. I mean, I should, right? I should be able to protect myself.\"\n He looked at her expectantly, waiting for sympathy. She wouldn\u0027t give him any. \"Were there witnesses?\"\n \"Yes, but they aren\u0027t on my side. If it goes to trial, they\u0027ll lie under oath. Just you watch and see.\"\n While Allison didn\u0027t know any of the particulars, she guessed this time Will wasn\u0027t going to be able to find a way out. \"Do you want it to go to trial?\"\n \"My lawyer says it would be a mistake to take it to trial. He wants me to take the deal they\u0027re offering.\"\n His face was turning red, and she could see the anger washing over him. She wasn\u0027t sure if she should continue asking him questions for fear of adding fuel to the fire.\n \"Don\u0027t you want to know what was offered?\" he asked. Antagonistic now, he glared at her.\n \"Yes, I do.\"\n \"Five to seven years, Allison. I\u0027d get seven years, but with good behavior, I could get out as early as five years.\"\n Good behavior? Then it was going to be seven long years, she thought, because there was no way Will could keep his temper controlled that long. He didn\u0027t know how.\n \"What happens if you decide to go to trial?\"\n \"According to my useless lawyer, I could get twice as long. Now do you understand why I need a new lawyer? One of those high-priced big shots who knows how to manipulate the law. That\u0027s what I need.\"\n \"Do you think a new lawyer could keep you out of prison?\"\n \"Yes, of course I do, if he knows what he\u0027s doing. Don\u0027t you agree?\"\n She nodded. She was determined to placate him, no matter what. Debating him would only incite his anger.\n \"Are you on my side or not?\" he asked.\n \"I don\u0027t want you to go to prison,\" she said, giving him an evasive answer.\n Allison wondered if he would ever face reality. She knew there had to be more to the story than he was telling. A bar fight didn\u0027t usually bring such harsh charges, did it? Unless someone was seriously injured, or unless the prosecutor could prove that there was an established pattern of behavior. How many fights had Will started? Probably more than he could remember.\n \"I guess I\u0027d better go inside and find out why I was summoned,\" she said as she climbed the steps.\n She already knew the reason her aunt had called her, of course. If Will wanted a new, more expensive lawyer, then, by God, he was getting one, which meant his parents needed help coming up with the money.\n On the drive to Emerson, Allison had played out the impending scene with her aunt and uncle in her head. She had witnessed it so many times in the past she could practically recite the dialogue by heart. In the end, her aunt would play the gratitude card and expect her to cave. Something was different this time, though. Maybe it was seeing Will at the end of his rope. Maybe Allison had reached the end of hers. Regardless of the reason, she knew what she had to do.\n Her hand on the doorknob, she paused, then turned back to Will. \"This is the last time I\u0027ll be coming back here.\"\n He acted as though he hadn\u0027t heard her. \"I\u0027m scared,\" he blurted. \"This could be bad. I swear, if I get out of this, I\u0027m going to change. I know I\u0027ve said that before, but I mean it this time. I want to go back to college and finish. I can\u0027t go to prison.\" A look of panic crossed his face, and there was a pathetic whine in his voice when he said, \"I just can\u0027t. I wouldn\u0027t last a week.\"\n Will looked so tormented, she almost felt pity for him. Was this finally the wake-up call he needed? Or was she being naive once more? Charlotte had told her again and again not to believe anything Will said. He was a habitual liar and would do or say anything to get what he wanted. Allison had fought against becoming that cynical. She wanted to believe that people were basically good even though life\u0027s lessons wore them down. She also wanted to believe in second chances, but how many chances had Will already had to turn his life around? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-31.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
