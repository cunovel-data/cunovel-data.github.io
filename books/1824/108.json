Before Brett finished his first howl of pain, Liam had grabbed the gun from his hand and pulled Allison away from him.\\n\\n \"You shot me,\" Brett cried. \"You shot my arm.\"\\n\\n Liam nodded. \"Yes. Yes, I did.\"\\n\\n The other two agents came running. Allison moved close to Liam and watched Brett being handcuffed. As one of the agents carted him away, Brett clutched his arm and demanded to be driven to a hospital. The second agent turned to Liam. \"We\u0027ll take it from here,\" he said, and then turned to Allison. \"I can send a car for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you home, Allison,\" Liam stated in his no-nonsense, \"don\u0027t argue with me\" voice.\\n\\n \"Wait a minute. What are you doing here?\" she asked. The fact that he had appeared out of nowhere had just hit her. \"Did you know Brett was coming?\"\\n\\n Liam wanted to get out of there and tried to pull her along, but she wasn\u0027t cooperating. Seeing that she wasn\u0027t going to wait for an answer, he decided to give in. \"I came here for you,\" he began, and before she could react, he continued. \"I knew someone was going to come after you, and I wanted to get you out of here and make sure you were safe. If anything ever happened to you . . .\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t go on. The thought of losing Allison was almost too much to bear. He pulled her into his arms and held her tight against him.\\n\\n She could feel him shaking. \"You were worried about me.\"\\n\\n \"Hell yes, I was worried.\" He kissed her forehead, then pulled away from her. \"The man who ran you off the road works for Stiles. His name is Jud Bronsky, and he\u0027s going to turn state\u0027s evidence against the bastard. He\u0027s got a lot to tell.\"\\n\\n Astonished by the lengths Stiles had been willing to go to, she whispered, \"He gave Brett the gun. I don\u0027t know if he would have shot me or not.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m certain Stiles or one of his men wouldn\u0027t have had any qualms about killing you. He not only wanted your laptop; he wanted you. He was sure he would be able to force you to give him the rest of the code for your software. You\u0027d disappear and he\u0027d sell your work and make a fortune.\"\\n\\n She was having trouble taking it all in. \"Where is Stiles now?\"\\n\\n \"I just got a call. Bronsky was able to give enough information to track him down. He\u0027s in a gated enclave about a half hour out of Boston. Agents are picking him up right now.\"\\n\\n She was weak with relief. \"Brett told me he was afraid of Stiles. Now I understand why. I can\u0027t help feeling sorry for Brett.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, hell no.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" she asked, confused by his reaction.\\n\\n \"You are not going to try to make a deal for Brett or plead on his behalf. He had a gun on you. I\u0027m never going to forget that.\" He took her hand and started to walk toward the lobby. \"I don\u0027t like you wearing all that makeup,\" he said, hoping to change the subject until he could get his nerves under control.\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t like you looking half-dead.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like seeing anyone pointing a gun at you.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t particularly like it, either,\" she replied.\\n\\n \"It scared the hell out of me.\"\\n\\n She glanced up at him. \"Me, too.\"\\n\\n They were in the middle of the lobby when he stopped and turned to her. \"I\u0027m never going to let anyone hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n He leaned down and kissed her. Now was neither the time nor the place, he told himself, but it didn\u0027t seem to matter. \"I love you, Allison.\"\\n\\n \"I know you do.\"\\n\\n She tried to keep walking, but he stopped her. \"That\u0027s all you have to say to me?\"\\n\\n \"I love you, too, Liam.\"\\n\\n He kissed her then. His mouth covered hers in a kiss that held nothing back. They were both having difficulty catching their breath when he lifted his head. She tried to take a step back. He wouldn\u0027t let her. \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t this where you tell me you have to leave tomorrow, and a life with me could never work because of your job and the demands on you?\" she asked.\\n\\n His arms were wrapped around her waist, and he stared into her eyes as he answered, \"Yeah, that\u0027s pretty much what I used to believe . . . until now. I can\u0027t seem to stay away from you. Have you noticed?\"\\n\\n \"I have noticed.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think we ought to do about it?\" he asked.\\n\\n She had a sly twinkle in her eyes, and he couldn\u0027t wait to hear what she would say.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re conflicted, Liam, but I\u0027ll be happy to clear it all up for you.\"\\n\\n \"Conflicted, huh?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t let her explain. He was suddenly eager to get her back to her apartment so he could show her how much he loved her. He had quite a bit inside him to say to her, too. It wasn\u0027t until they were on their way that she finally got his full attention. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-108.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \\n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
