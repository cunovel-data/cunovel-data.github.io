He probably mentioned you to Phillips. So, do you want to go or not?\"\n \"Absolutely. I\u0027m in.\"\n She hadn\u0027t unpacked from her trip yet and went to her closet to find something to wear. She didn\u0027t think her usual uniform, jeans and a T-shirt, would be appropriate, so she chose a skirt and a silk blouse with a pair of nude heels.\n When Jordan came to pick her up, Allison\u0027s two housemates were shooting hoops in the driveway. They stopped to watch her walk down the sidewalk and whistled in appreciation.\n \"Where you goin\u0027, Al? Must be someplace special for you to put on a skirt in the middle of the afternoon,\" Mark called out in a singsong tease.\n She smiled and waved to them as she got in the car.\n The ride took a long while. Jordan\u0027s GPS led them onto three different highways before they exited into an old industrial area. Allison wasn\u0027t even sure they were still in Boston. They turned a corner and ended up on a long, winding road that seemed to be heading to the middle of nowhere. There weren\u0027t any houses or other commercial properties around, just thick trees on either side. The branches draped over them like an umbrella.\n \"Why would the bureau put an office all the way out here?\" Allison asked.\n Jordan was just as puzzled. \"I don\u0027t know. When I told Noah we were going there today, he warned me it was in a remote area. I wish he could have come with us, but he had to leave for Florida this morning.\"\n They pulled up to a gate in a tall chain-link fence, and the GPS announced that they had reached their destination. Beyond the fence was a modern three-story building, all tinted glass and steel. There weren\u0027t any signs indicating it was an FBI office.\n \"Are you sure we\u0027re in the right place?\" Allison asked. \"It looks deserted.\"\n \"This is the address Agent Phillips gave me,\" Jordan said.\n The gate suddenly opened.\n \"I guess they know we\u0027re here,\" Jordan said as she stepped on the accelerator and drove through. She pulled into an empty lot obviously meant for visitors and parked in the slot closest to the front door. \"There must be a parking garage on the other side of the building or maybe it\u0027s underground.\"\n \"There\u0027s a guard just inside the door watching us.\"\n Jordan nodded. \"I count two cameras on top of the building, and the red eyes are definitely on us.\"\n \"This is very weird,\" Allison said. \"But the fact that it\u0027s such a highly protected site makes me all the more excited to see what\u0027s inside. I wonder if they have a code room.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they do.\"\n They started for the door. \"Don\u0027t let me forget to thank Agent Phillips. This is such a cool opportunity,\" Allison said.\n \"About Phillips . . . ,\" Jordan began.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"You won\u0027t like him much at first. He\u0027s arrogant and wants things done his way, but he grows on you. He can be a real pain. . . .\"\n \"And he\u0027s your friend?\"\n Jordan nodded. \"If you\u0027re in the mood, I\u0027d love it if you\u0027d take him down a peg, maybe chip away some of his arrogance.\"\n \"You want me to show off for an FBI agent?\"\n \"I kinda do.\"\n \"It\u0027s not going to happen.\" Allison began to laugh. \"You\u0027ve got a crazy amount of faith in me. I\u0027m sure the head of the cyber task force won\u0027t be interested in anything I have to say.\"\n The guard at the door escorted them to a reception desk where another guard sat behind a bank of computer screens. The young man, with a badge clipped to his blazer pocket identifying him as Tom Pritchard, picked up the phone to notify Phillips of their arrival. While they waited, the door guard leaned against the counter, obviously happy to have a break in the monotony of his job and ready to chat. \"We hardly ever get visitors, and today we have three.\" \n \"Three?\" Jordan asked.\n \"That\u0027s right. You two and an agent, but not with this division. I\u0027m not real sure who he works for,\" he admitted. \"But I do know he\u0027s got higher clearance than Agent Phillips. He could shut us down if he wanted to.\"\n \"Why would he want to?\" Allison wondered.\n The guard grinned. \"I\u0027m not saying he would. I\u0027m saying he could. He\u0027s got the authority.\"\n The elevator doors opened and a man stepped out. He was putting his jacket on as he strode toward the desk. He appeared to be in his mid-forties. His hair was trimmed so close to his head he almost looked bald, and his stocky build and thick neck strained the buttons of his shirt. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-11.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
