It didn\u0027t take her more than a few seconds to see the picture taking shape in her mind. And then she went to work, snapping the pieces together.\n She was incredibly fast. Jordan watched the three men. They looked mesmerized.\n \"Faster than a speeding bullet, right?\" she whispered to her husband.\n Noah nodded. \"Her brain\u0027s a computer, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I swear she\u0027s wired differently than the rest of us.\"\n \"I can hear you,\" Allison said. \"So stop making fun.\"\n \"How can you talk and do that at the same time?\" Alec asked.\n \"I can also walk and talk at the same time.\"\n \"No need to be sarcastic, sweetheart.\" Liam made the comment.\n \"Liam, talk to Agent Phillips,\" Jordan said. \"Tell him to let up on Allison.\"\n Allison was exasperated. She didn\u0027t look up when she said, \"Do not talk to him. I can take care of myself.\"\n \"How come he wants to track you?\" Jordan asked.\n \"He thinks I could be dangerous. At least that\u0027s what he keeps telling me. He makes it sound like I have an affliction.\"\n \"He\u0027s right,\" Liam said. \"You are dangerous.\"\n Allison continued snapping the pieces together. After the first few minutes the others pulled out chairs and sat down to watch in awe, as though they were spectators at some phenomenal sporting event. When the last piece had been inserted, she stepped back and surveyed her work, then turned around.\n \"Wow\" was all Alec could say.\n \"When my contract is up, I\u0027m not doing anything more for the FBI,\" she blurted, finishing her argument. \"I know that\u0027s why you\u0027re here, and I\u0027m not-\"\n Liam didn\u0027t let her finish. He took her by the hand and led her toward the French doors that opened to the patio.\n \"What are you doing?\" she asked. Two months without a single phone call, and now he was being domineering? No way was she going to let him get away with it.\n She was about to resist when he said, \"We have to talk.\"\n Glancing over her shoulder, she wondered why Alec wasn\u0027t following them. After they stepped onto the patio and Liam closed the doors behind them, she pulled her hand away. With a bite in her voice, she asked, \"More hacker talk?\"\n \"No,\" he replied. He walked over to the short brick wall that surrounded the patio and leaned against it.\n She took a seat next to him. \"Then why are you and Alec here?\"\n \"We\u0027re going fishing with Noah.\"\n \"So you\u0027re going to Nathan\u0027s Bay?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n She couldn\u0027t make up her mind if she was happy or irritated that he would be with her that weekend. Two months without a word and now he was acting as though he\u0027d only just seen her yesterday. Irritated, she decided. She was irritated. She had already been thinking like a clingy rejected woman, and that was simply unacceptable. If she let that attitude continue, she would soon be singing those stupid melancholy songs. \"Why do you have bruises on your face? Were you in a fight?\" \n \"Yes.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"London.\"\n \"Are you going to tell me what happened?\"\n \"No.\"\n She didn\u0027t know if he couldn\u0027t tell her or wouldn\u0027t tell her, and she once again pretended she didn\u0027t care. \"You\u0027ve been in London all this while?\"\n \"No,\" he answered. \"I had to go back last week.\"\n She wanted to ask where he had been for the last two months besides London, but she repressed the urge to pursue the subject. Where he had been or what he had been doing-or whom he had been doing it with-wasn\u0027t any of her business. Right?\n \"Okay, then.\" She started to get up, but he put his hand on her shoulder and stopped her.\n \"I have something to tell you.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n He didn\u0027t ease into the news. \"There\u0027s a warrant out for your cousin\u0027s arrest.\"\n She braced herself. \"What happened?\"\n \"Will\u0027s girlfriend, Mary Lou Something-or-other, went to the movie with another man. Will found out about the date and waited in the parking lot for them to come outside. According to the police report, Will was pretty drunk when he jumped the guy. There were dozens of phone cameras filming your cousin beating him to a bloody pulp. He put him in the hospital.\"\n She thought she might be sick. \"How bad was the man hurt?\"\n \"He\u0027s stable now, but still in ICU.\"\n \"Is he going to be okay?\"\n \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I gotta say, Mary Lou sure set the bar low for boyfriends. The guy in the hospital is younger than Will, but he\u0027s already a felon with a record that goes way back. I wouldn\u0027t waste any tears on him, Allison, because as soon as he\u0027s released from the hospital he\u0027s going to be locked up. Turns out, the police have been looking for him. He was involved in an armed robbery a couple of months ago.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-75.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
