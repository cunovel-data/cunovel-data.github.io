Exasperated, he said, \"Didn\u0027t we decide that was a bad idea?\" \"No, you and Noah decided it was a bad idea. I didn\u0027t.\" There was a small alcove near the bell captain\u0027s desk, and without any explanation, Liam pulled her toward it and told her to stay put. \"What do you mean, \u0026lsquo;stay put\u0027? And will you stop dragging me around!\" She was about to go into a full-blown lecture on the merits of good manners and suggest he might want to get some until she noticed he wasn\u0027t paying any attention to her. Standing directly in front of her, he was looking across the lobby as he unbuttoned his jacket and unsnapped the leather holster securing his gun. Liam knew Brett hadn\u0027t seen them, but Fred Stiles and the guard hired to protect the door from unwanted guests during their presentation had seen them. They were coming at them, and coming fast. The thick-shouldered guard with squinty eyes reached them first. Standing just a foot away, he looked up at Liam and said, \"You don\u0027t intimidate me. Get out of my way. I want to talk to that bitch hiding behind you.\" Liam didn\u0027t move. In a voice Allison had never heard before, he said, \"Get the hell out of here.\" \"That troublemaker cost me a lot of money tonight. I was supposed to get a bonus if everything went smooth. She\u0027s the reason it all fell apart, so she owes me.\" He tried to push Liam out of his way, but Liam didn\u0027t budge. Then the man tried to shove him in his chest next. Liam had had enough of pretending to be a nice guy. He grabbed the man\u0027s hand and twisted his fingers back as he turned him and half lifted him, slamming him into the wall. Stiles looked appalled by the guard\u0027s behavior. Liam knew his outrage was all a pretense. People coming and going through the doors of the hotel didn\u0027t notice the guard, who had dropped to the floor inside the alcove. When he slowly sat up and rubbed the side of his head, he looked dazed. Allison was amazed by Liam\u0027s strength. She knew he was muscular. She should have known, for she had kissed and caressed every part of him. Still, to twist a man\u0027s fingers, lift him, and slam his head into the wall took remarkable strength. And a temper. She was shocked by that revelation. Liam had always been so calm and easygoing with everyone . . . until now. Unfortunately, the confrontation didn\u0027t end with the guard. Stiles tried to walk around Liam to get to Allison, but Liam wasn\u0027t about to let that happen, either. He quickly blocked Stiles. \"I want to talk to her,\" Stiles protested. \"No,\" Liam said. \"Now get out of here.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll have to get my attorneys involved, then,\" he threatened, glaring at her before abruptly turning and storming away. The guard, finally regaining his feet, staggered behind him. Allison had been silent long enough. \"I\u0027d love it if you did,\" she called after them. She\u0027d sounded so thrilled by the possibility Liam laughed. It took all the discipline he possessed not to pull her into his arms and kiss her the way he\u0027d been thinking about all day. It suddenly occurred to him he\u0027d been fighting an impossible war. He couldn\u0027t stay away from her. Then again, he didn\u0027t want to. \"Are you ready to get out of here?\" His voice was gruff. - Allison waited until they were back in her apartment to lecture him. \"You didn\u0027t need to use such force with that guard. You could have-\" He cut her off. \"He called you a bitch. I didn\u0027t like it.\" \"You can\u0027t go around slamming heads into walls just because you don\u0027t like the names they call me.\" \"Apparently, I can,\" he replied. \"Because I just did.\" She kicked off her shoes and picked them up. She stopped at her bedroom door and turned. Frowning, she asked, \"Is this a pattern? Do you punch all men who insult your assets?\" \"No, just the ones who insult you.\" She opened her mouth to say something, then closed it. He was walking toward the door, and she couldn\u0027t let him leave without answering a question for her. She\u0027d wanted to ask him for days and so far hadn\u0027t been able to get up the courage. Now or never, she thought. \"Liam, wait. I want to ask you something, and I want you to be completely honest with me. I need to know . . . if this makes you uncomfortable . . .\" Her voice was whisper soft and apologetic. He couldn\u0027t imagine what was going on inside that brilliant but decidedly confused mind of hers. He had a feeling he wasn\u0027t going to like the question and told himself that, no matter what she asked, he would not get angry. Unless, of course, she wanted another favor for Will. Then he\u0027d probably end up yelling at her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-92.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
