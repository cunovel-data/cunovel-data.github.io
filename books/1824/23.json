If he wanted to be optimistic, it was okay with her.\n Jordan began to gather up the food cartons. \"Allison, if you\u0027re finished, why don\u0027t you and Liam go into the living room and talk? I know you\u0027re anxious to find out what this meeting is about.\"\n Anxious didn\u0027t quite describe how she was feeling. She took her plate into the kitchen, got another bottle of water out of the refrigerator, and followed Liam into the living room. He waited until she had taken a seat on the sofa, then pulled up a chair to face her. There was nothing to separate her from the intimidating man who sat in front of her. He focused his attention entirely on her as though he was studying her, getting ready to pounce.\n Alec surprised her by joining them. He moved the other chair over next to Liam\u0027s. Allison could feel her heart beating in her chest. If the two men intended to unnerve her, they were doing a fine job of it.\n Liam leaned forward. \"Whatever is said here is confidential. I would appreciate it if you didn\u0027t discuss what we\u0027re about to tell you with anyone. Okay?\"\n He expected a quick agreement before he continued and was totally unprepared for her refusal. \"I\u0027m sorry. No, I can\u0027t do that.\"\n \"No?\" Alec said, nonplussed.\n \"I can\u0027t promise you that I\u0027ll keep this conversation confidential,\" she explained.\n \"Why not?\" Alec asked.\n \"I\u0027ll tell Jordan.\" Before they could respond, she continued. \"I know this must be an important matter. I\u0027ll still tell her, though. She\u0027s my friend, and if she asks . . . which she will . . . I\u0027ll tell her.\"\n \"At least she\u0027s honest,\" Alec said to Liam.\n \"Yes, she is,\" Liam agreed. He looked very serious, yet he sounded as though he was about to smile.\n Clearly exasperated, Alec asked, \"Is there anyone else you know you\u0027ll tell besides my sister?\"\n \"No, just Jordan,\" she said. She thought she should probably offer some sort of explanation, so she added, \"I\u0027m assuming whatever you have to say involves my work with computers, and Jordan\u0027s an expert. I value her opinion.\"\n \"Talking to her won\u0027t be a problem,\" Alec assured her. Liam agreed with a nod.\n Allison looked first at Alec and then at Liam, examining each of their faces to see if there was the slightest cause for suspicion. They definitely were intense, and yet they seemed sincere. Her anxiety lessened slightly. Maybe they hadn\u0027t brought her here to interrogate her or to accuse her of a crime after all. Maybe they had other intentions. She mulled over her situation for several more seconds. \"Okay,\" she said finally. \"What is it you want?\"\n \"We believe someone is leaking information on sensitive case files. We\u0027re hoping you can help us find out who it is.\"\n \"FBI files?\" she asked.\n \"Yes,\" Alec answered. \"At first, there were minor details of cases getting out, but then some crucial information was released. Recently there was a major leak that all but destroyed a case and an agent\u0027s credibility. We believe whoever is doing this has access to our system, but we haven\u0027t been able to find the leak.\"\n Liam said. \"Have you ever heard of the CSA?\"\n Allison shook her head.\n \"It\u0027s the federal cyber security agency,\" Alec continued. \"Everyone who works there spends their days monitoring other agencies, including the FBI. They also look for viruses. They\u0027re the best in the country.\"\n \"Best what?\" she asked.\n \"Hackers,\" Liam answered.\n \"The FBI gets weekly reports from the CSA,\" Alec said. \"And those reports show there hasn\u0027t been any abnormal activity. In other words, no breaches. We don\u0027t know if the leaks are coming from the inside or the outside, and we need someone who\u0027s never had a connection to either of these agencies to work on this. My fear is that, if we don\u0027t stop them, the leaks could get even bigger. Whoever is behind this could be just testing the waters.\"\n \"Who discovered this?\" she asked.\n Alec answered, \"We knew there was a leak when we were on a case in Hawaii. We couldn\u0027t prove it, though. There were very few people involved in the investigation, and we checked every one of them thoroughly.\"\n \"We couldn\u0027t find anything suspicious,\" Liam interjected. \n Alec nodded. \"The most recent incident was in Atlanta. A field agent was assigned a case involving bribery of a state official. He was just beginning to collect names of possible witnesses, and before he could even do a thorough investigation, the names of the witnesses were released on the Internet. Within a couple of days, two of them disappeared. The blame for the leak fell directly on him, but there wasn\u0027t any proof he had let the information out. We\u0027re fairly sure there\u0027s one source to these leaks, and it\u0027s in our computer system. The problem is, there\u0027s absolutely no trace of a hack.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-23.html","bookId":1824,"book":{"id":1824,"title":"Wired (Buchanan-Renard #13)","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful computer hacker and a bad-boy FBI agent must collaborate—in more ways than one—in the sizzling new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Allison Trent doesn’t look like a hacker.
