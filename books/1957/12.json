It was Steve’s sister. \"What are you doing here?\"\n \"I was just about to ask you the same thing.\"\n Lindy looked fantastic. It had been nearly two years since Carol had last seen her former sister-in-law. Lindy had been a senior in college at the time, girlish and fun loving that summer she and Steve had visited his family. Had that been only two summers ago? It felt as though a decade had passed. Lindy had always held a special place in Carol’s heart, and she smiled and hugged her close. When she drew back, Carol was surprised at the new maturity Lindy’s eyes revealed.\n \"I work here,\" Lindy said, squeezing Carol’s fingers. \"I have since this past summer.\"\n \"Me, too – for over a year now.\"\n Lindy tossed the sky a chagrined look. \"You mean to tell me we’ve been employed by the same company, working at the same plant, and we didn’t even know it?\"\n Carol laughed. \"It looks that way.\"\n They started walking toward the main entrance, still bemused, laughing and joking like long-lost sisters… which they were of sorts.\n \"I’m going to kick Steve,\" Lindy muttered. \"He didn’t tell me you worked for Boeing.\"\n \"He doesn’t know. I suppose he assumes I’m still at Larson’s Sporting Goods. I quit… long before the divorce was final. We haven’t talked about my job, and I didn’t think to mention it.\"\n \"How are you?\" Lindy asked, but didn’t give her more than a second to respond. \"Steve growls at me every time I mention your name, which by the way, tells me he’s still crazy about you.\"\n Carol needed to hear that. She grinned, savoring the warm feeling Lindy’s words gave her. \"I’m still crazy about him, too.\"\n \"Oh, Carol,\" Lindy said with a giant sigh. \"I can’t tell you how glad I am to hear that. Steve never told any of us why the two of you divorced, but it nearly destroyed him. I can’t tell you how happy I was when you phoned last Christmas. He hasn’t been the same since.\"\n \"The divorce was wrong---We should never have gone through with it,\" Carol said softly. Steve had been the one who had insisted on ending their marriage, and Carol had been too hurt, too confused to fight him the way she should have. Not wanting to linger on the mistakes of the past, Carol added, \"Steve told me about you and Rush. Congratulations.\"\n \"Thanks.\" Lindy’s eyes softened at the mention of Rush’s name, and translucent joy radiated from her smile. \"You met Paul didn’t you?\"\n Carol nodded, recalling the time she had been introduced to Lindy’s ex-fiance in Minneapolis. She hadn’t been overly impressed by him and, as she recalled, neither had Steve.\n \"He married…someone else,\" Lindy explained. \"I was devastated, convinced my life was over. That’s how I ended up in Seattle. I’m so happy I moved here. Paul did me the biggest favor of my life when he dumped me; I found Rush and we were meant to be together – we both know it.\"\n Hold on to that feeling, Carol mused, saddened that she’d been foolish enough to allow Steve to walk away from her. It had been a mistake, and one they’d both paid for dearly. \"I’m really pleased for you, Lindy,\" she said sincerely.\n \"Thank you…oh, Carol, I can’t tell you how good it is to see you again.\"\n They paused once they passed the security gate, delaying their parting. \"What area are you working in?\" Carol asked, stopping. The others flooding through the entrance gate walked a wide circle around them.\n \"Section B.\"\n \"F for me.\" Which meant they were headed in opposite directions.\n \"Perhaps we could meet for lunch one day,\" Lindy suggested, anxiously glancing at her watch.\n \"I’d like that. How about next Tuesday? I can’t until then, I’m involved with a special project.\"\n \"Great. Call me. I’m on extension 314.\"\n \"Will do.\"\n Steve walked past the captain’s quarters and through the narrow hallway to his stateroom. Tired, he sat on the edge of his berth and rubbed his hand across his eyes. This was his favorite time of day. His shift was complete, and he had about an hour to kill before he thought about catching some sleep. For the past several days, he’d been writing Carol. His letter had become a journal of his thoughts. Chances were that he would be home long before the letter arrived. Because submarines spent their deployment submerged, there were few opportunities for the pickup or delivery of mail. Any emergencies were handled by radio transmission. There were occasions when they could receive mail, but it wasn’t likely to happen this trip.\n Steve felt good. From the moment his and Carol’s divorce had been declared final, he’d felt as if he’d steered his life off course. He’d experienced the first turbulent storm and, instead of riding it out as he should have, he’d jumped overboard. Ever since, he’d felt out of sync with his inner self.\n In his letter, he’d tried to explain that to Carol, but putting it in words had been as difficult as admitting it had been.\n He didn’t know what had happened between Todd and Carol. Frankly he didn’t want to know. Whatever had been between them was over and Steve could have her back. Lord knew he wanted her. He was destined to go to his grave loving that woman.\n When he’d sailed out of Hood Canal and into the Pacific Ocean, Steve had felt such an indescribable pull to the land. He loved his job, loved being a part of the Navy, but at that moment he would have surrendered his commission to have been able to stay in Seattle another month.\n Although he’d told Carol that they should use this time apart to consider a reconciliation, he didn’t need two seconds to know his own mind: he wanted them to remarry.\n But first they had to talk, really talk, and not about Todd. There were some deep-rooted insecurities he’d faced the past couple of weeks that needed to be discussed.\n One thing that had always bothered Steve was the fact that Carol had never seemed to need him. His peers continually related stories about how things fell apart at home while they were deployed. Upon their return, after the usual hugs and kisses, their wives handed them long lists of repairs needed around the house or relayed tales of horror they’d been left to deal with in their husband’s absence.\n Not Carol. She’d sent him off to sea, wearing a bright smile and greeted him with an identical one on his return. The impression she gave him was that it was great when he was home, but was equally pleasant if he wasn’t.\n Her easy acceptance of his life-style both pleased and irritated Steve. He appreciated the strength of her personality, and yet a small part of him wished she weren’t quite so strong. He wasn’t looking for a wife who was a clinging vine, but occasionally he wished for something less than Carol’s sturdy oak-tree character. Just once he would have liked to hear her tell him how dreadful the weeks had been without him, or how she’d wished he’d been there to take care of the broken dryer or to change the oil in the car.\n Instead she’d given him the impression that she’d been having a grand ol’ time while he was at sea. She chatted about the classes she took, or how her herb garden was coming along. If he quizzed her about any problems, she brushed off his concern and assured him she’d already dealt with whatever turned up.\n Steve knew Carol wasn’t that involved in the Navy-wife activities. He figured it was up to her whether or not she joined. He hadn’t pressed her, but he had wished she would make the effort to form friendships with the wives of his close friends.\n Carol’s apparent strength wasn’t the only thing that troubled Steve, but it was one thing he felt they needed to discuss. The idea of telling his ex-wife that the least she could do was shed a few tears when he sailed away from her made him feel ungrateful. But swallowing his pride would be a small price to pay to straighten matters between them.\n What she’d said about wanting a baby right away made him feel soft inside every time he thought about it. He’d yearned for them to start a family long before now, but Carol had always wanted to wait. Now she appeared eager. He didn’t question her motivation. He was too damned grateful.\n A knock on his door jerked his attention across the room. \"Yes?\"\n Seaman Layle stepped forward. \"The Captain would like to see you, sir.\"\n Steve nodded and said, \"I’ll be right there.\"\n Carol sat at the end of the examination table, holding a thin piece of tissue over her lap. The doctor would be in any minute to give her the news she’d been waiting to hear for the past month. Okay, so her period was two weeks late. There could be any number of reasons. For one thing, she’d been under a good deal of stress lately. For another…\n Her thoughts came to a grinding halt as Dr. Stewart stepped into the room. His glasses were perched on the end of his nose and his brow compressed as he read over her chart.\n \"Well?\" she asked, unable to disguise the trembling eagerness in her voice.\n \"Congratulations, Carol,\" he said, looking up with a grandfatherly smile. \"You’re going to be a mother.\"\n Chapter Seven\n Carol was almost afraid to believe what Dr. Stewart was telling her; her hand flew to her heart. \"You mean, I’m pregnant?\"\n The doctor looked up at her over the edge of his bifocals. \"This is a surprise?\"\n \"Oh, no… I knew – or at least I thought I knew.\" The joy that bubbled through her was unlike anything she had ever known. Ready tears blurred her vision and she bit her lower lip to hold back the tide that threatened to overwhelm her.\n The doctor took her hand and gently patted it. \"You’re not sure how you feel – is that it?\"\n \"Of course I do,\" she said, in a voice half an octave higher than usual. \"I’m so happy I could just…\"\n \"Cry?\" he inserted.\n \"Dance,\" she amended. \"This is the most wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me since…\"\n \"Your high-school prom?\"\n \"Since I got married. I’m divorced now, but…Steve, he’s my ex-husband, will marry me again… at least, I think he will. I’m not going to tell him about this right away. I don’t want him to marry me again just because of the baby. I won’t say a word about this. Or maybe I should? I don’t know what to do, but thank you, Doctor, thank you so much.\"\n A fresh smile began to form at the edges of his mouth. \"You do whatever you think is best. Now, before we discuss anything else I want to go over some key points with you.\"\n \"Oh, of course, I’ll do anything you say. I’ll quit smoking and give up junk food, and take vitamins. If you really think it’s necessary, I’ll try to eat liver once a week.\"\n His gaze reviewed her chart. \"It says here you don’t smoke.\"\n \"No, I don’t, but I’d start just so I could quit if it would help the baby.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-blues-navy-2/page-12.html","bookId":1957,"book":{"id":1957,"title":"Navy Blues (Navy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Navy Blues (Navy Series #2) \n From New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber comes Navy Blues, a poignant and emotional tale in her popular Navy series.
