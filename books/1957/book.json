{"id":1957,"title":"Navy Blues (Navy #2)","description":"Storyline: Navy Blues (Navy Series #2) From New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber comes Navy Blues, a poignant and emotional tale in her popular Navy series. After many years, Silhouette Books is proud to give readers the chance to enjoy Debbie Macomber\u0027s famous Navy series. Spanning five books, this emotional series brought fans Debbie\u0027s trademark humor, poignancy and affable characters. Navy Blues follows the February rerelease of the first title, Navy Wife, and will pave the way for the remaining three Navy titles coming in 2004. Carol Kyle hadn\u0027t spoken to her bullheaded ex-husband in nearly a year, so luring him into her bed for one tempestuous night would be no mean feat. But even if it required strategy skills befitting a Navy admiral, she would manage. Because Carol wanted a child, and only Lieutenant Commander Steve Kyle would do as father-to-be. Somehow she\u0027d break through the wall of bitterness Steve was hiding behind. Shameless seduction wasn\u0027t forthright Carol\u0027s style, but her slinky red dress and an unsteady Christmas tree seemed to be working to sultry perfection...until her carefully wrought baby-trap suddenly slammed shut--on her own unsuspecting heart!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/navy-blues-navy-2.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":31,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
