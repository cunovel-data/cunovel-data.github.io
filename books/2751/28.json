You want me out of your house and out of your life and ...\" She wrenched her hand from his grasp. \"So, what do you have lined up? Is it a play?\" she asked with feigned casualness. \"A movie?\" She saw him flinch, and she knew she\u0027d hit a vein of truth. \"You can tell me,\" she said, wanting to ignore the alarm bells sounding in her mind. Then she looked at his bag on the floor and saw the corner of a script peeking out from the side pocket. She pointed at the pages. \"Where did you get that?\" she asked. Tell me I\u0027m wrong, Lance, she thought. Tell me I\u0027m wrong. \"Julia, it\u0027s not...\" \"Don\u0027t tell me what it isn\u0027t. Tell me what it is\" she said, but then her eyes fell to the ashes in the fireplace, to what was left of her great secret, and she realized where the script had come from. \"He gave that to you. Didn\u0027t he?\" Guilt spread across Lance\u0027s face. \"You didn\u0027t break in and throw his clothes in the pool. You lied to me.\" She sank into the truth, then whispered, \"You lied.\" \"Julia,\" he said, \"I did what I had to do.\" Then another image came to mind. \"You knew last night you were going back, and still you tried ...\" Julia couldn\u0027t finish. She played through the scene again and again, wondering how she\u0027d known that he would betray her, wishing that she hadn\u0027t been right. \"Like I said, thanks for your help. Good luck.\" She bolted for the stairs, but Lance was instantly beside her, looking into her eyes. \"Just say you don\u0027t want me to go. All right? Just say it. Don\u0027t pick this fight, please.\" \"I\u0027m not fighting. You\u0027re the one who wants to leave. I\u0027m not standing in your way.\" \"Then stand in my way,\" he said. \"If that\u0027s what you want, then stand in my way.\" \"What I want is my life back!\" Julia cried. \"I want my reputation. I want my career. I—\" \"You are like a little kid!\" he barked. \"Spoiled. Used to having your own way—\" \"Did I just hear you correctly?\" she asked, her voice seeping with indignation. \"Did you just infer that I am not a grownup?\" \"Yeah.\" He nodded his head, defiantly. \"I did.\" \"I\u0027ve been on my own for fifteen years! I\u0027ve built a dynasty! I\u0027ve been on Oprah’ Lance pointed to her grandmother\u0027s painting that still leaned against the wall. \"Where are you going to hang your picture, Julia? You\u0027ve leaned it up against every wall in this house. Pick one. I\u0027ll drive the nail.\" \"What does that have to do with anything?\" \"Thirteen cabinet knobs, Julia. Thirteen. You can\u0027t even commit to a two-dollar knob.\" He shook his head as the headlights of the shuttle washed across the widows facing the porch. \"How did I ever expect you to commit to me?\" He grabbed his bag and walked toward the door. \"Keep on playing solitaire,\" he told her. \"Keep on staying up nights and wondering why you\u0027re too tired to get out of bed in the morning. Keep on laying out those cards, and then ask yourself when you\u0027re Ro-Ro\u0027s age if it would have been so awful to put that painting someplace.\" The car outside honked, and Lance glanced involuntarily toward it before turning back to her. \"I don\u0027t have a lot of pride, Julia, but I can\u0027t hang around here waiting just because you\u0027re not used to other people\u0027s noise.\" He opened the door, then stepped onto the wide-planked porch with its peeling paint and sagging center and started for the rickety stairs. When he reached the bottom step, he turned to her. \"Good-bye, Julia,\" he said. \"And good luck. I really mean it.\" Julia watched him walk away. She stood in the cold wind until the taillights of the shuttle disappeared. Then she went inside again, locked the door, sat in front of the fireplace, and shuffled. Chapter Twenty Six WAY #88: Plan for your later years. It\u0027s a well-accepted truth that eventually, it\u0027s the children who care for the parents. If you\u0027re single, that likely won\u0027t be an option, so think about your future and long-term care. Finally, create and stick to a savings plan that will give you the financial security to keep your independence as long as possible. —from 707 Ways to Cheat at Solitaire \"If this is supposed to be a welcome-home banner made I by Cassie, then why isn\u0027t Cassie making it?\" Julia asked as she peeled layers of glittery glue from the ends of her fingers. \"Because it has to look nice, but like it was made by an actual five-year-old—that\u0027s why you\u0027re doing it and not Nina,\" Caroline said. Julia studied the crude puffy letters and runny strips of glue and realized that if she were a five-year-old, she would never see the first grade based on her creation. She craned her head, hoping the banner might improve with distance, but no. WELCOME HOME AUNT ROSEMARY was still crooked on the long strip of yellow paper, the a-r-y of Rosemary still squished together and disproportionately small in relation to the w-e-1 of welcome. She looked across Caroline\u0027s massive dining-room table, at the glitter and errant marker doodles covering the newspaper they\u0027d laid out to protect the wood, and felt certain that Cassie herself would have been neater. She started to pick up pieces of the newspaper and slide the glitter into nice, uniform piles. Caroline stared at her blankly as she worked. \"Hey, Caroline, it\u0027s okay to breathe. Ro-Ro\u0027s hired nurses, and she\u0027s going to her own apartment when she leaves the rehab center, remember? We talked her out of coming here or to Mom and Dad\u0027s. You don\u0027t have to take care of Ro-Ro!\" But that newsflash didn\u0027t make Caroline smile. Instead, she was looking around her own formal dining room as if she were a buyer at an open house. \"We never use this room,\" she said finally. \"Did you know that? We\u0027ve eaten in here maybe twice in eight months. Twice.\" Caroline reached under the table and came back up with an extendible duster, which she used to reach the corners of the twelve-foot ceiling. \"Doesn\u0027t stop it from getting dirty, though, does it?\" \"Caroline,\" Julia started, but her sister cut her off. \"Did you know we have five bathrooms? Five?\" Caroline faced Julia. \"Four people, one of whom is in diapers, live in a house with five bathrooms.\" Caroline turned and began parading through her home. \"Have you seen our formal living room?\" she asked, arms outstretched as she walked and Julia followed. \"It\u0027s very nice. It\u0027s the room we walk through on our way to the family room, which is the room we walk through to get to the kitchen, which is the room the family actually lives in.\" \"Caroline\"—Julia grew firm—\"sit down.\" She wrestled her sister onto one of the barstools at the granite-covered kitchen island. \"Tell me what\u0027s going on.\" \"Oh, I hate to say it,\" Caroline whimpered, burying her head in her hands, \"but I think Ro-Ro\u0027s right. This house is too big for us. All Steve does is work because he\u0027s worried about the mortgage. All I do is clean. We don\u0027t even see each other most days. The only way I know he\u0027s living here is because I\u0027m still doing his laundry.\" Caroline was crying, but she kept talking in sharp little gasps of breath. \"And we can\u0027t sell because no one wants to live in an unfinished development.\" She paused. \"Next to Myrtle!\" \"You\u0027ll pay down the mortgage,\" Julia comforted her. \"And it\u0027ll get better. I can help.\" Caroline looked at her, shocked. \"You mean give us money?\" \"We could call it a loan if that makes any difference.\" \"No.\" Caroline shook her head vigorously. \"Why not?\" Julia asked. \"I\u0027ve got more than I\u0027ll ever need.\" \"Julia, we\u0027re not taking your money. Steve and I made a grown-up decision when we bought this place, and we\u0027re going to deal with it like grown-ups.\" Grown-ups. Julia remembered the last time she\u0027d heard that term. \"It\u0027s Nick and Cassie\u0027s inheritance,\" Julia said bluntly. \"You saw Mom. You saw the way she worried these last few weeks, spending every day at the hospital or at the rehab center because she\u0027s Ro-Ro\u0027s only family. Well, that\u0027s me, Caroline. Someday, Nick and Cassie are going to have to take care of me because I\u0027m not going to have any kids of my own to do it. So let me help you out now.\" \"Julia,\" Caroline cried in disbelief. \"You don\u0027t honestly believe that!\" \"Of course I do. You know that.\" \"You\u0027re nothing like Ro-Ro,\" Caroline exclaimed, but Julia wasn\u0027t so sure. They were both stubborn and full of themselves, set in their ways, and growing older. She thought about Lance, the way he\u0027d always said that Ro-Ro reminded him of someone he knew, and only then did she realize that he was talking about her. \"Caroline,\" Julia said slowly, \"let\u0027s face it. Ro-Ro is me with better jewelry.\" She\u0027d said it to be funny, but the truth hit Julia hard. When Caroline didn\u0027t laugh, Julia focused on the problem at hand. \"How much would bring your payment down to a manageable level?\" Caroline didn\u0027t offer her a figure. Instead, she asked, \"Have you heard from Lance?\" \"Lance and I aren\u0027t pen pals, Caroline. We\u0027ve gone back to our own lives like we were supposed to. Besides,\" Julia added, \"I\u0027m leaving for Europe in three weeks. You know how hectic book tours are, and ...\" She broke off. \"Oh, Julia.\" \"Caroline, it\u0027s okay. I\u0027m going to be so busy, you wouldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve got to do press, and Abby wants to put out a new book really quickly, so I\u0027ve got to do that. I\u0027ve got to, work. This is what I do, remember?\" \"Yes,\" Caroline admitted. \"It\u0027s what you do.\" Julia looked down at the half-eaten pizza slice that rested on the molded plastic seat beside her in the airport waiting area. \"I guess you found lunch without me,\" Abby was saying, her voice clear through Julia\u0027s cellular phone. \"Oh, don\u0027t worry about me, Abby. I won\u0027t starve,\" Julia said before taking a sip of her full-calorie Coke. Damn Lance Collins. He had left an entire case of the stuff, and Julia couldn\u0027t bear to throw it out. Now she was addicted. Between that and the whole milk she\u0027d been drinking, she was glad to be going on tour. She needed to drop a few pounds, and more than a couple of Lance\u0027s bad habits, to distance herself from all the parts of Lance that remained long after he was gone. Abby carried on. \"Well, I\u0027m heartbroken I couldn\u0027t see you while you were in town, but you know how it is.\" Julia looked at the notebook peeking out of her bag and reassured her editor. \"That\u0027s fine, Abby. I\u0027ll see you on my way back through. Maybe I\u0027ll have a draft ready for you by then.\" \"Jules,\" Abby protested, \"I know you\u0027re good, but you\u0027re not Wonder Woman. No one can finish a book and travel and do press at the same time. Just enjoy the trip. And sell lots of books!\" \u0027I will. Thanks, Abby.\" \"Oh, hey, while I\u0027ve got you on the line, I should fill you in on some sad news.\" A tremor of dread rippled down Julia\u0027s spine. \"Turns out our friend Richard Stone hasn\u0027t paid income taxes in seven years.\" Julia felt like the jets that were taking off outside. \"Really?\" \"Really. He\u0027s left town completely. I think we\u0027ve heard the last of Richard Stone.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-28.html","bookId":2751,"book":{"id":2751,"title":"Cheating at Solitaire (Cheating at Solitaire #1)","description":"Storyline: Cheating at Solitaire (Cheating at Solitaire #1) Self-help guru Julia James is so good at being single that she\u0027s become famous for it-advising women that they don\u0027t need a man to be happy.
