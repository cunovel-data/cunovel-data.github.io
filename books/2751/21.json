Jules, I get the feeling there\u0027s something here you\u0027re not telling me.\"\\n\\n Actually, there were a lot of things Julia hadn\u0027t told her simply because Abby hadn\u0027t allowed her time to speak. She thought about Crazy Myrtle, the fact that Lance was living with her, and the missing Veronica, and she also remembered what her mother always said about lasting relationships being rooted in truth. She adjusted her grip on the phone and aimed tor \"completely reliable business associate.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Julia said. \"Nothing else.\"\\n\\n Chapter Eighteen\\n\\n WAY #18: Value persistence.\\n\\n The single people who cope best with life are those who are persistent and surround themselves with people who don\u0027t settle for second best.

She could see Nick sleeping peacefully in his crib and Lance standing beside him with Cassie mounted firmly on his back. \"At first, I didn\u0027t want a little brother,\" Cassie went on. \"But I know women have longer life expectancies, so it\u0027s okay that I\u0027m older.\"\\n\\n \"Five going on forty, huh?\" Lance said softly as Julia appeared in the doorway.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah,\" she whispered back. She took Cassie from Lance and felt the little girl\u0027s arms and legs wrap around her. \"Whatcha doing, girlie?\" she asked her niece.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m explaining how to be a sister, because Lance doesn\u0027t have one.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Julia asked, eyebrows raised. \"That\u0027s very nice of you.\"\\n\\n Julia carried Cassie toward the door. She felt Lance place his hand on the small of her back and guide her around the array of toys that Cassie had left, like a trail of breadcrumbs, to follow. Don\u0027t we look like a little family, Julia thought, but she didn\u0027t protest as they eased down the long hall.\\n\\n \"Lance knows Shrek!\" Cassie squealed.\\n\\n Julia cut him an inquiring look.\\n\\n \"Well,\" he fudged, \"I know a guy who works as Mike Myers\u0027s stand-in.\"\\n\\n For Cassie, and by extension Julia, that was close enough.\\n\\n \"There you are!\" Caroline shouted as she suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs. She leaned over and fought to catch her breath. \"I ought to be a size two, as many times a day as I go up and down these things,\" she said to no one but herself. Then she straightened, looked at Lance and Julia, and exclaimed, \"His agent is here!\"\\n\\n Instinctively, Julia tightened her grip on Cassie, as if she were going to have to get the children to safety before the shots started to fly.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t let him in, did you?\" Lance asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" Nina said, appearing behind Caroline. \"He\u0027s at Myrtle\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Caroline hadn\u0027t been exaggerating when she said she could stand in the upstairs playroom and keep an eye on Crazy Myrtle. As Julia peered through the telescope, she could see straight into what must be Myrtle\u0027s formal living room, where Richard Stone sat with the older woman, enjoying a cup of tea. At least Julia thought it was tea. It could just as easily have been human blood.\\n\\n \"Oh, she\u0027s enjoying this,\" Caroline said, sounding bitter. When a buzzer sounded from deep within the house, she bolted for the stairs. \"Whites are done.\"\\n\\n \"Caroline,\" Julia said, \"can\u0027t that wait\"\\n\\n Caroline wheeled. \"Julia, the sun is going to come up tomorrow, whether my family has clean underwear or not.\" She took a step down the stairs. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n With Caroline gone, Lance was next in turn for the telescope. \"How\u0027s Harvey?\" he asked, and Julia had to remind herself that Lance had never even met Harvey; she fought to remember that only a few days before, she had never met Lance.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s better,\" Julia said, reflecting on the quick call she\u0027d shared with Francesca after she\u0027d said good-bye to Abby. \"He\u0027ll be in rehab for a while, but things look good.\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" Caroline said over the heaping pile of sheets and towels she had dropped in the center of the playroom floor.\\n\\n \"Mom will be glad to hear African violets haven\u0027t lost their healing power.\"\\n\\n Caroline plopped down on the floor and started folding like a pro. Lance joined her, and Nina shifted into place for telescope duty. Julia watched Lance with the laundry. As he neatly tucked the corners of a fitted sheet into one another, she thought, He actually knows what he\u0027s doing. \"You really didn\u0027t have a sister?\" she asked.\\n\\n He grinned. \"I bake, too.\"\\n\\n \"So what did your new editor say when you told her about the lost Veronica?\" Caroline asked as she segued from sheets to hand towels.\\n\\n \"Well ...\" Julia started.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell her,\" Caroline said, sounding completely unsurprised. \"Julia, you\u0027re going into business with her. She\u0027s taking a chance on you. You can\u0027t let—\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t need to know. Abby Warner is used to dealing with the nonfiction big boys—corporate CEOs, prime ministers, chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trust me, she\u0027s not going to give someone with Veronica White\u0027s sales history the time of day.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so,\" Caroline chimed.\\n\\n \"Maybe we\u0027re reading too much into this,\" Lance said. \"Richard Stone\u0027s not going to care what type of books you used to write.\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding?\" Julia asked. \"This is fresh wood for the fire. This keeps the headlines on the front page a few days longer.\" She looked out the window at Myrtle\u0027s house and the decaying subdivision and fought not to say, This is how my career might end.\\n\\n \"What happens when he reads it?\" Nina added sheepishly.\\n\\n Caroline\u0027s hand flew to her mouth. \"He\u0027s going to notice.\"\\n\\n \"I noticed as soon as I saw the picture,\" Nina agreed. \"Lance fits the description exactly. That\u0027s why I thought it was true!\"\\n\\n \"What aren\u0027t you telling me?\" Lance demanded. Caroline and Nina stared at each other, then Nina gave Caroline a \"go ahead\" nod, and Caroline said, \"It\u0027s about you.\" \"Caroline!\" Julia cried.\\n\\n But Nina picked up the novel and began to read over Julia\u0027s protests: \"Philippe\u0027s arms, still sore from the long journey, hung loosely by his side while the wind blew through his dark brown hair. His gray eyes squinted against the rising sun. His chin ...\"\\n\\n \"So, there are some similarities,\" Julia jumped in, stopping Nina.\\n\\n \"Similarities?\" Nina turned to Lance, thrusting the book into his hands. \"The hero looks like you. Exactly like you. Twelve years ago, Julia wrote a romance novel about a man who looks like you,\" Nina finished. Then, keeping the same tone she\u0027d had before, she said, \"I\u0027m hungry,\" and she and her GIVE LANCE A CHANCE T-shirt disappeared down the stairs.\\n\\n Lance looked at the book again. \"How many of these did you write?\" he asked.\\n\\n Julia answered, \"Eight.\"\\n\\n He studied her, then asked, \"Did they sell well?\" She had to laugh a little. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"They did really well.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with what you wrote,\" he said. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with who you are.\" \"I\u0027m not her,\" Julia stated.\\n\\n \"Yes, you are. Isn\u0027t that what this crisis is about? And what I m telling you is that there\u0027s no shame in that.\"\\n\\n She struggled to believe Lance, but she knew too well that he world wasn\u0027t that idyllic. Veronica White died the day Candon Jeffries took Julia to lunch at the Ritz. A card turned over. Everything changed. She had traded one life for another, and to be the person she was now, no one could ever know who she\u0027d been then. \"No one can know about these books,\" she said simply and solidly, steadying herself for the arguments that would come next. But she felt Lance\u0027s hand on her arm and knew the topic was closed.\\n\\n \"Something\u0027s happening,\" Caroline spoke from the telescope. A moment passed while Lance and Julia crowded around. \"Yep. There he goes.\"\\n\\n Together, they watched Myrtle\u0027s front door open and Richard step onto the front porch. He shook the woman\u0027s hand and turned to leave, walking with a slight bounce in his step through the underdeveloped area between the unfinished houses across the street.\\n\\n Lance eased away from the window. \"Crazy Myrtle doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s got yet. Or, if she does, she\u0027s smart enough not to share it with Stone, and hold out for someone bigger. And be certainly doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s got.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\" Julia asked.\\n\\n \"Because he wasn\u0027t carrying anything. If that manuscript I what you say it is, no way in hell does Richard Stone walk on without it.\"\\n\\n \"We could steal it,\" Nina said from the doorway. She was eating a cherry Popsicle, and the juice ran, like blood, down her hands. It made for an ominous scene.\\n\\n In unison, they all yelled \"No!\"\\n\\n Chapter Nineteen\\n\\n WAY #92: Lose yourself in a good book.\\n\\n Life\u0027s best adventures are often as close as your nearest bookshelf. Tour Europe with the Count of Monte Cristo. Dance at a ball with Mr. Darcy. Hunt down the bad guys with Stephanie Plum. Amazing things can happen when you read.\\n\\n —from 707 Ways to Cheat at Solitaire\\n\\n The fire crackled, and her house felt warm. Julia stretched her legs across the couch, trying to focus on a back issue of Publishers Weekly, but she kept looking down at Lance, who lay on the floor beneath her with his feet near the fireplace, reading Veronica White\u0027s first book. Either he was a very slow reader or he was very thorough. Slow. Definitely slow. Nothing there to savor, she said to herself, the way a highway patrolman says \"Nothing to see here, folks.\" Yet that didn\u0027t change the fact that a man was lying on the floor, reading her deepest secret, literally. To make matters worse, every few pages he\u0027d moan.\\n\\n He turned slightly, rested his elbow on the floor and hit head in the palm of his upturned hand, and read aloud: \"Isabella\u0027s hands, small and narrow but fiercely strong, gripped the horse\u0027s reins as if she were holding on to life itself. Her] blood ran hot beneath her cool, pale skin, and the pounding of ; her heart matched the pounding of the horse\u0027s hooves. ...\"\\n\\n He climbed onto his knees and inched closer, putting his elbows on the couch beside her, crowding into Julia\u0027s space. He read on: \"Isabella\u0027s mind outran the Thoroughbred as she leapt in space and time between her desperate flight on the runaway stallion and the strange figure she had seen the night before, the silhouette that seemed to call to her, a ghost from another lifetime.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an excellent reader,\" Julia said dryly as she tried to snatch the book away, but he was too quick and too strong. In a flash, he was on the edge of the couch, with Julia pinned to the cushions behind him. One large hand was pressing against her collarbone while the other held the book far away from her flailing arms. Heat burned from his fingers through her T-shirt, and he continued to read, despite her constant jabs and lunges. He read louder, drowning out the sound of Julia\u0027s cries.\\n\\n \"The mud-soaked road didn\u0027t slow the stallion\u0027s hooves.\"\\n\\n \"Lance, give me the ...\"\\n\\n \"Her thin nightgown flew violently in the night wind, her unruly auburn hair as wild as the horse\u0027s mane.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-21.html","bookId":2751,"book":{"id":2751,"title":"Cheating at Solitaire (Cheating at Solitaire #1)","description":"Storyline: Cheating at Solitaire (Cheating at Solitaire #1) \\n Self-help guru Julia James is so good at being single that she\u0027s become famous for it-advising women that they don\u0027t need a man to be happy.
