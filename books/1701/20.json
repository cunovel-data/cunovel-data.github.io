{"id":65894,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Jonas went home the next morning, cheerfully greeted his parents, and lied easily about what a busy, pleasant night he had had.\\n\\n His father smiled and lied easily, too, about his busy and pleasant day the day before.\\n\\n Throughout the school day, as he did his lessons, Jonas went over the plan in his head. It seemed startlingly simple. Jonas and The Giver had gone over it and over it, late into the night hours.\\n\\n For the next two weeks, as the time for the December Ceremony approached, The Giver would transfer every memory of courage and strength that he could to Jonas. He would need those to help him find the Elsewhere that they were both sure existed. They knew it would be a very difficult journey.\\n\\n Then, in the middle of the night before the Ceremony, Jonas would secretly leave his dwelling. This was probably the most dangerous part, because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on official business to leave a dwelling at night.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave at midnight,\" Jonas said. \"The Food Collectors will be finished picking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the Path-Maintenance Crews don\u0027t start their work that early. So there won\u0027t be anyone to see me, unless of course someone is out on emergency business.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you should do if you are seen, Jonas,\" The Giver had said. \"I have memories, of course, of all kinds of escapes. People fleeing from terrible things throughout history. But every situation is individual. There is no memory of one like this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" Jonas said. \"No one will see me.\"\\n\\n \"As Receiver-in-training, you\u0027re held in very high respect already. So I think you wouldn\u0027t be questioned very forcefully.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d just say I was on some important errand for the Receiver. I\u0027d say it was all your fault that I was out after hours,\" Jonas teased.\\n\\n They both laughed a little nervously. But Jonas was certain that he could slip away, unseen, from his house, carrying an extra set of clothing. Silently he would take his bicycle to the riverbank and leave it there hidden in bushes with the clothing folded beside it.\\n\\n Then he would make his way through the darkness, on foot, silently, to the Annex.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no nighttime attendant,\" The Giver explained. \"I\u0027ll leave the door unlocked. You simply slip into the room. I\u0027ll be waiting for you.\"\\n\\n His parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone. They would also find a cheerful note from Jonas on his bed, telling them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river; that he would be back for the Ceremony.\\n\\n His parents would be irritated but not alarmed. They would think him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later.\\n\\n They would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be forced to go, taking Lily to the Ceremony without him.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t say anything to anyone, though,\" Jonas said, quite certain. \"They won\u0027t call attention to my rudeness because it would reflect on their parenting. And anyway, everyone is so involved in the Ceremony that they probably won\u0027t notice that I\u0027m not there. Now that I\u0027m a Twelve and in training, I don\u0027t have to sit with my age group any more. So Asher will think I\u0027m with my parents, or with you—\"\\n\\n \"And your parents will assume you\u0027re with Asher, or with me—\"\\n\\n Jonas shrugged. \"It will take everyone a while to realize that I\u0027m not there at all.\"\\n\\n \"And you and I will be long on our way by then.\"\\n\\n In the early morning, The Giver would order a vehicle and driver from the Speaker. He visited the other communities frequently, meeting with their Elders; his responsibilities extended over all the surrounding areas. So this would not be an unusual undertaking.\\n\\n Ordinarily The Giver did not attend the December Ceremony. Last year he had been present because of the occasion of Jonas\u0027s selection, in which he was so involved. But his life was usually quite separate from that of the community. No one would comment on his absence, or on the fact that he had chosen this day to be away.\\n\\n When the driver and vehicle arrived, The Giver would send the driver on some brief errand. During his absence, The Giver would help Jonas hide in the storage area of the vehicle. He would have with him a bundle of food which The Giver would save from his own meals during the next two weeks.\\n\\n The Ceremony would begin, with all the community there, and by then Jonas and The Giver would be on their way.\\n\\n By midday Jonas\u0027s absence would become apparent, and would be a cause for serious concern. The Ceremony would not be disrupted—such a disruption would be unthinkable. But searchers would be sent out into the community.\\n\\n By the time his bicycle and clothing were found, The Giver would be returning. Jonas, by then, would be on his own, making his journey Elsewhere.\\n\\n The Giver, on his return, would find the community in a state of confusion and panic. Confronted by a situation which they had never faced before, and having no memories from which to find either solace or wisdom, they would not know what to do and would seek his advice.\\n\\n He would go to the Auditorium where the people would be gathered, still. He would stride to the stage and command their attention.\\n\\n He would make the solemn announcement that Jonas had been lost in the river. He would immediately begin the Ceremony of Loss.\\n\\n \"Jonas, Jonas,\" they would say loudly, as they had once said the name of Caleb. The Giver would lead the chant. Together they would let Jonas\u0027s presence in their lives fade away as they said his name in unison more slowly, softer and softer, until he was disappearing from them, until he was no more than an occasional murmur and then, by the end of the long day, gone forever, not to be mentioned again.\\n\\n Their attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the memories themselves. The Giver would help them.\\n\\n \"Yes, I understand that they\u0027ll need you,\" Jonas had said at the end of the lengthy discussion and planning. \"But I\u0027ll need you, too. Please come with me.\" He knew the answer even as he made the final plea.\\n\\n \"My work will be finished,\" The Giver had replied gently, \"when I have helped the community to change and become whole.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m grateful to you, Jonas, because without you I would never have figured out a way to bring about the change. But your role now is to escape. And my role is to stay.\"\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you want to be with me, Giver?\" Jonas asked sadly.\\n\\n The Giver hugged him. \"I love you, Jonas,\" he said. \"But I have another place to go. When my work here is finished, I want to be with my daughter.\"\\n\\n Jonas had been staring glumly at the floor. Now he looked up, startled. \"I didn\u0027t know you had a daughter, Giver! You told me that you\u0027d had a spouse. But I never knew about your daughter.\"\\n\\n The Giver smiled, and nodded. For the first time in their long months together, Jonas saw him look truly happy.\\n\\n \"Her name was Rosemary,\" The Giver said.\\n\\n 21\\n\\n It would work. They could make it work, Jonas told himself again and again throughout the day.\\n\\n But that evening everything changed. All of it—all the things they had thought through so meticulously—fell apart.\\n\\n That night, Jonas was forced to flee. He left the dwelling shortly after the sky became dark and the community still. It was terribly dangerous because some of the work crews were still about, but he moved stealthily and silently, staying in the shadows, making his way past the darkened dwellings and the empty Central Plaza, toward the river. Beyond the Plaza he could see the House of the Old, with the Annex behind it, outlined against the night sky. But he could not stop there. There was no time. Every minute counted now, and every minute must take him farther from the community.\\n\\n Now he was on the bridge, hunched over on the bicycle, pedaling steadily. He could see the dark, churning water far below.\\n\\n He felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving the community behind. But he felt a very deep sadness that he had left his closest friend behind. He knew that in the danger of his escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind, he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond, The Giver would know that Jonas had said goodbye.\\n\\n It had happened at the evening meal. The family unit was eating together as always: Lily chattering away, Mother and Father making their customary comments (and lies, Jonas knew) about the day. Nearby, Gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk, looking with glee now and then toward Jonas, obviously delighted to have him back after the unexpected night away from the dwelling.\\n\\n Father glanced down toward the toddler. \"Enjoy it, little guy,\" he said. \"This is your last night as visitor.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Jonas asked him.\\n\\n Father sighed with disappointment. \"Well, you know he wasn\u0027t here when you got home this morning because we had him stay overnight at the Nurturing Center. It seemed like a good opportunity, with you gone, to give it a try. He\u0027d been sleeping so soundly.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t it go well?\" Mother asked sympathetically.\\n\\n Father gave a rueful laugh. \"That\u0027s an understatement. It was a disaster. He cried all night, apparently. The night crew couldn\u0027t handle it. They were really frazzled by the time I got to work.\"\\n\\n \"Gabe, you naughty thing,\" Lily said, with a scolding little cluck toward the grinning toddler on the floor.\\n\\n \"So,\" Father went on, \"we obviously had to make the decision. Even I voted for Gabriel\u0027s release when we had the meeting this afternoon.\"\\n\\n Jonas put down his fork and stared at his father. \"Release?\" he asked.\\n\\n Father nodded. \"We certainly gave it our best try, didn\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we did,\" Mother agreed emphatically.\\n\\n Lily nodded in agreement, too.\\n\\n Jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. \"When?\" he asked. \"When will he be released?\"\\n\\n \"First thing tomorrow morning. We have to start our preparations for the Naming Ceremony, so we thought we\u0027d get this taken care of right away.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,\" Father had said, in his sweet, sing-song voice.\\n\\n Jonas reached the opposite side of the river, stopped briefly, and looked back. The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now, sleeping. At dawn, the orderly, disciplined life he had always known would continue again, without him. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\\n\\n He pushed firmly again at the pedal with his foot and continued riding along the road. It was not safe to spend time looking back. He thought of the rules he had broken so far: enough that if he were caught, now, he would be condemned.\\n\\n First, he had left the dwelling at night. A major transgression.\\n\\n Second, he had robbed the community of food: a very serious crime, even though what he had taken was leftovers, set out on the dwelling doorsteps for collection.\\n\\n Third, he had stolen his father\u0027s bicycle. He had hesitated for a moment, standing beside the bikeport in the darkness, not wanting anything of his father\u0027s and uncertain, as well, whether he could comfortably ride the larger bike when he was so accustomed to his own.\\n\\n But it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back.\\n\\n And he had taken Gabriel, too.\\n\\n He could feel the little head nudge his back, bouncing gently against him as he rode. Gabriel was sleeping soundly, strapped into the seat. Before he had left the dwelling, he had laid his hands firmly on Gabe\u0027s back and transmitted to him the most soothing memory he could: a slow-swinging hammock under palm trees on an island someplace, at evening, with a rhythmic sound of languid water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby. As the memory seeped from him into the newchild, he could feel Gabe\u0027s sleep ease and deepen. There had been no stir at all when Jonas lifted him from the crib and placed him gently into the molded seat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-20.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) \\n Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
