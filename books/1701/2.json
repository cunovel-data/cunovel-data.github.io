It was written very clearly in the rules. Lily giggled. \"Well,\" she said, \"I thought maybe just this once.\" Next, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of Justice, talked about her feelings. Today a repeat offender had been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his home, his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And even guilt, that she hadn\u0027t made a difference in his life. \"I feel frightened, too, for him,\" she confessed. \"You know that there\u0027s no third chance. The rules say that if there\u0027s a third transgression, he simply has to be released.\" Jonas shivered. He knew it happened. There was even a boy in his group of Elevens whose father had been released years before. No one ever mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to imagine. Lily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mother\u0027s arm. From his place at the table, Father reached over and took her hand. Jonas reached for the other. One by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, and murmured that she felt soothed. The ritual continued. \"Jonas?\" Father asked. \"You\u0027re last, tonight.\" Jonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelings hidden. But it was, of course, against the rules. \"I\u0027m feeling apprehensive,\" he confessed, glad that the appropriate descriptive word had finally come to him. \"Why is that, son?\" His father looked concerned. \"I know there\u0027s really nothing to worry about,\" Jonas explained, \"and that every adult has been through it. I know you have, Father, and you too, Mother. But it\u0027s the Ceremony that I\u0027m apprehensive about. It\u0027s almost December.\" Lily looked up, her eyes wide. \"The Ceremony of Twelve,\" she whispered in an awed voice. Even the smallest children—Lily\u0027s age and younger—knew that it lay in the future for each of them. \"I\u0027m glad you told us of your feelings,\" Father said. \"Lily,\" Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, \"Go on now and get into your nightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk to Jonas for a while.\" Lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. \"Privately?\" she asked. Mother nodded. \"Yes,\" she said, \"this talk will be a private one with Jonas.\" 2 Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee. He waited. \"You know,\" his father finally said, \"every December was exciting to me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, I\u0027m sure. Each December brings such changes.\" Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to When he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lily\u0027s earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One. The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned One. One at a time—there were always fifty in each year\u0027s group, if none had been released—they had been brought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers. \"I enjoy the Naming,\" Jonas said. His mother agreed, smiling. \"The year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that we\u0027d receive our female, because we\u0027d made our application and been approved. But I\u0027d been wondering and wondering what her name would be.\" \"I could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony,\" Father confided. \"The committee always makes the list in advance, and it\u0027s right there in the office at the Nurturing Center. \"As a matter of fact,\" he went on, \"I feel a little guilty about this. But I did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this year\u0027s Naming list had been made yet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up number Thirty-six—that\u0027s the little guy I\u0027ve been concerned about—because it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if I could call him by a name. Just privately, of course, when no one else is around.\" \"Did you find it?\" Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didn\u0027t seem a terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him. He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling. His father nodded. \"His name—if he makes it to the Naming without being released, of course—is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him when I feed him every four hours, and during exercise and playtime. If no one can hear me. \"I call him Gabe, actually,\" he said, and grinned. \"Gabe.\" Jonas tried it out. A good name, he decided. Though Jonas had only become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learned her name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how she would fit into their established family unit. He remembered climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his side that year instead of with the Nurturers, since it was the year that he would be given a newchild of his own. He remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her arms, while the document was read to the assembled family units. \"Newchild Twenty-three,\" the Namer had read. \"Lily.\" He remembered his father\u0027s look of delight, and that his father had whispered, \"She\u0027s one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be the one.\" The crowd had clapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked his sister\u0027s name. Lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist. Then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit. \"When I was an Eleven,\" his father said now, \"as you are, Jonas, I was very impatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. It\u0027s a long two days. I remember that I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but that I didn\u0027t pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for my sister\u0027s. She became a Nine that year, and got her bicycle. I\u0027d been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically I wasn\u0027t supposed to.\" Jonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously and was almost always broken. The children all received their bicycles at Nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then. But almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones. Jonas had been thinking already about teaching Lily. There was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlier age. A committee was studying the idea. When something went to a committee for study, the people always joked about it. They said that the committee members would become Elders by the time the rule change was made. Rules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very important rule—unlike the one governing the age for bicycles—it would have to go, eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The Receiver was the most important Elder. Jonas had never even seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position of such importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never bother The Receiver with a question about bicycles; they would simply fret and argue about it themselves for years, until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study. His father continued. \"So I watched and cheered when my sister, Katya, became a Nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle,\" Father went on. \"Then I didn\u0027t pay much attention to the Tens and Elevens. And finally, at the end of the second day, which seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was the Ceremony of Twelve.\" Jonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy and quiet boy, for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his group, waiting to be called to the stage. The Ceremony of Twelve was the last of the Ceremonies. The most important. \"I remember how proud my parents looked—and my sister, too; even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn came. \"But to be honest, Jonas,\" his father said, \"for me there was not the element of suspense that there is with your Ceremony. Because I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment was to be.\" Jonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in advance. It was a secret selection, made by the leaders of the community, the Committee of Elders, who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokes made about Assignments. His mother seemed surprised, too. \"How could you have known?\" she asked. His father smiled his gentle smile. \"Well, it was clear to me—and my parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them, too—what my aptitude was. I had always loved the newchildren more than anything. When my friends in my age group were holding bicycle races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction sets, or—\" \"All the things I do with my friends,\" Jonas pointed out, and his mother nodded in agreement. \"I always participated, of course, because as children we must experience all of those things. And I studied hard in school, as you do, Jonas. But again and again, during free time, I found myself drawn to the newchildren. I spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, from their observation.\" Jonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the increasing level of observation. In school, at recreation time, and during volunteer hours, he had noticed the Elders watching him and the other Elevens. He had seen them taking notes. He knew, too, that the Elders were meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the other Elevens had had during their years of school. \"So I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when my Assignment was announced as Nurturer,\" Father explained. \"Did everyone applaud, even though they weren\u0027t surprised?\" Jonas asked. \"Oh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was what I wanted most. I felt very fortunate.\" His father smiled. \"Were any of the Elevens disappointed, your year?\" Jonas asked. Unlike his father, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. But he knew that some would disappoint him. Though he respected his father\u0027s work, Nurturer would not be his wish. And he didn\u0027t envy Laborers at all. His father thought. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Of course the Elders are so careful in their observations and selections.\" \"I think it\u0027s probably the most important job in our community,\" his mother commented. \"My friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor,\" Father said, \"but she was thrilled. And let\u0027s see, there was Andrei—I remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical things. He spent all the recreation time he could with his construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building sites. The Elders knew that, of course. Andrei was given the Assignment of Engineer and he was delighted.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-2.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
