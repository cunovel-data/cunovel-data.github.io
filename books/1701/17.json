It was a game he had often played with the other children, a game of good guys and bad guys, a harmless pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground. He had never recognized it before as a game of war. \"Attack!\" The shout came from behind the small storehouse where play equipment was kept. Three children dashed forward, their imaginary weapons in firing position. From the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout: \"Counter-attack!\" From their hiding places a horde of children—Jonas recognized Fiona in the group—emerged, running in a crouched position, firing across the field. Several of them stopped, grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated gestures, and pretended to be hit. They dropped to the ground and lay suppressing giggles. Feelings surged within Jonas. He found himself walking forward into the field. \"You\u0027re hit, Jonas!\" Asher yelled from behind the tree. \"Pow! You\u0027re hit again!\" Jonas stood alone in the center of the field. Several of the children raised their heads and looked at him uneasily. The attacking armies slowed, emerged from their crouched positions, and watched to see what he was doing. In his mind, Jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying on a field and had begged him for water. He had a sudden choking feeling, as if it were difficult to breathe. One of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt to destroy him with a firing noise. \"Pssheeew!\" Then they were all silent, standing awkwardly, and the only sound was the sound of Jonas\u0027s shuddering breaths. He was struggling not to cry. Gradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children looked at each other nervously and went away. He heard the sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the path that led from the field. Only Asher and Fiona remained. \"What\u0027s wrong, Jonas? It was only a game,\" Fiona said. \"You ruined it,\" Asher said in an irritated voice. \"Don\u0027t play it anymore,\" Jonas pleaded. \"I\u0027m the one who\u0027s training for Assistant Recreation Director,\" Asher pointed out angrily. \"Games aren\u0027t your area of expertness.\" \"Expertise,\" Jonas corrected him automatically. \"Whatever. You can\u0027t say what we play, even if you are going to be the new Receiver.\" Asher looked warily at him. \"I apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve,\" he mumbled. \"Asher,\" Jonas said. He was trying to speak carefully, and with kindness, to say exactly what he wanted to say. \"You had no way of knowing this. I didn\u0027t know it myself until recently. But it\u0027s a cruel game. In the past, there have—\" \"I said I apologize, Jonas.\" Jonas sighed. It was no use. Of course Asher couldn\u0027t understand. \"I accept your apology, Asher,\" he said wearily. \"Do you want to go for a ride along the river, Jonas?\" Fiona asked, biting her lip with nervousness. Jonas looked at her. She was so lovely. For a fleeting instant he thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along the river path, laughing and talking with his gentle female friend. But he knew that such times had been taken from him now. He shook his head. After a moment his two friends turned and went to their bikes. He watched as they rode away. Jonas trudged to the bench beside the Storehouse and sat down, overwhelmed with feelings of loss. His childhood, his friendships, his carefree sense of security—all of these things seemed to be slipping away. With his new, heightened feelings, he was overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and shouted, playing at war. But he knew that they could not understand why, without the memories. He felt such love for Asher and for Fiona. But they could not feel it back, without the memories. And he could not give them those. Jonas knew with certainty that he could change nothing. Back in their dwelling, that evening, Lily chattered merrily about the wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very short try on her father\u0027s bicycle. \"I can\u0027t wait till I get my very own bicycle next month. Father\u0027s is too big for me. I fell,\" she explained matter-offactly. \"Good thing Gabe wasn\u0027t in the child seat!\" \"A very good thing,\" Mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it. Gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself. He had begun to walk just the week before. The first steps of a newchild were always the occasion for celebration at the Nurturing Center, Father said, but also for the introduction of a discipline wand. Now Father brought the slender instrument home with him each night, in case Gabriel misbehaved. But he was a happy and easygoing toddler. Now he moved unsteadily across the room, laughing. \"Gay!\" he chirped. \"Gay!\" It was the way he said his own name. Jonas brightened. It had been a depressing day for him, after such a bright start. But he set his glum thoughts aside. He thought about starting to teach Lily to ride so that she could speed off proudly after her Ceremony of Nine, which would be coming soon. It was hard to believe that it was almost December again, that almost a year had passed since he had become a Twelve. He smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully before the other, grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried them out. \"I want to get to sleep early tonight,\" Father said. \"Tomorrow\u0027s a busy day for me. The twins are being born tomorrow, and the test results show that they\u0027re identical.\" \"One for here, one for Elsewhere,\" Lily chanted. \"One for here, one for Else—\" \"Do you actually take it Elsewhere, Father?\" Jonas asked. \"No, I just have to make the selection. I weigh them, hand the larger over to a Nurturer who\u0027s standing by, waiting, and then I get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy. Then I perform a small Ceremony of Release and—\"He glanced down, grinning at Gabriel. \"Then I wave bye-bye,\" he said, in the special sweet voice he used when he spoke to the newchild. He waved his hand in the familiar gesture. Gabriel giggled and waved bye-bye back to him. \"And somebody else comes to get him? Somebody from Elsewhere?\" \"That\u0027s right, Jonas-bonus.\" Jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used the silly pet name. Lily was deep in thought. \"What if they give the little twin a name Elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe Jonathan? And here, in our community, at his naming, the twin that we kept here is given the name Jonathan, and then there would be two children with the same name, and they would look exactly the same, and someday, maybe when they were a Six, one group of Sixes would go to visit another community on a bus, and there in the other community, in the other group of Sixes, would be a Jonathan who was exactly the same as the other Jonathan, and then maybe they would get mixed up and take the wrong Jonathan home, and maybe his parents wouldn\u0027t notice, and then—\" She paused for breath. \"Lily,\" Mother said, \"I have a wonderful idea. Maybe when you become a Twelve, they\u0027ll give you the Assignment of Storyteller! I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve had a Storyteller in the community for a long time. But if I were on the Committee, I would definitely choose you for that job!\" Lily grinned. \"I have a better idea for one more story,\" she announced. \"What if actually we were all twins and didn\u0027t know it, and so Elsewhere there would be another Lily, and another Jonas, and another Father, and another Asher, and another Chief Elder, and another—\" Father groaned. \"Lily,\" he said. \"It\u0027s bedtime.\" 18 \"Giver,\" Jonas asked the next afternoon, \"Do you ever think about release?\" \"Do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of release?\" \"Both, I guess. I apologi—I mean I should have been more precise. But I don\u0027t know exactly what I meant.\" \"Sit back up. No need to lie down while we\u0027re talking.\" Jonas, who had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came to his mind, sat back up. \"I guess I do think about it occasionally,\" The Giver said. \"I think about my own release when I\u0027m in an awful lot of pain. I wish I could put in a request for it, sometimes. But I\u0027m not permitted to do that until the new Receiver is trained.\" \"Me,\" Jonas said in a dejected voice. He was not looking forward to the end of the training, when he would become the new Receiver. It was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was, despite the honor. \"I can\u0027t request release either,\" Jonas pointed out. \"It was in my rules.\" The Giver laughed harshly. \"I know that. They hammered out those rules after the failure ten years ago.\" Jonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous failure. But he still did not know what had happened ten years before. \"Giver,\" he said, \"tell me what happened. Please.\" The Giver shrugged. \"On the surface, it was quite simple. A Receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. The selection went smoothly enough. The Ceremony was held, and the selection was made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. The new Receiver was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were.\" \"My parents told me it was a female.\" The Giver nodded. Jonas thought of his favorite female, Fiona, and shivered. He wouldn\u0027t want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on the memories. \"What was she like?\" he asked The Giver. The Giver looked sad, thinking about it. \"She was a remarkable young woman. Very self-possessed and serene. Intelligent, eager to learn.\" He shook his head and drew a deep breath. \"You know, Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented herself to begin her training—\" Jonas interrupted him with a question. \"Can you tell me her name? My parents said that it wasn\u0027t to be spoken again in the community. But couldn\u0027t you say it just to me?\" The Giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the name aloud might be excruciating. \"Her name was Rosemary,\" he told Jonas, finally. \"Rosemary. I like that name.\" The Giver went on. \"When she came to me for the first time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. She was eager and excited and a little scared. We talked. I tried to explain things as well as I could.\" \"The way you did to me.\" The Giver chuckled ruefully. \"The explanations are difficult. The whole thing is so beyond one\u0027s experience. But I tried. And she listened carefully. Her eyes were very luminous, I remember.\" He looked up suddenly. \"Jonas, I gave you a memory that I told you was my favorite. I still have a shred of it left. The room, with the family, and grandparents?\" Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It had that wonderful feeling with it. You told me it was love.\" \"You can understand, then, that that\u0027s what I felt for Rosemary,\" The Giver explained. \"I loved her. \"I feel it for you, too,\" he added. \"What happened to her?\" Jonas asked. \"Her training began. She received well, as you do. She was so enthusiastic. So delighted to experience new things. I remember her laughter...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-17.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
