I don\u0027t think you need to worry about that,\" his father reassured him. \"And if there are, you know there\u0027s an appeal process.\" But they all laughed at that—an appeal went to a committee for study.\\n\\n \"I worry a little about Asher\u0027s Assignment,\" Jonas confessed. \"Asher\u0027s such fun. But he doesn\u0027t really have any serious interests. He makes a game out of everything.\"\\n\\n His father chuckled. \"You know,\" he said, \"I remember when Asher was a newchild at the Nurturing Center, before he was named. He never cried. He giggled and laughed at everything. All of us on the staff enjoyed nurturing Asher.\"\\n\\n \"The Elders know Asher,\" his mother said. \"They\u0027ll find exactly the right Assignment for him. I don\u0027t think you need to worry about him. But, Jonas, let me warn you about something that may not have occurred to you. I know I didn\u0027t think about it until after my Ceremony of Twelve.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s the last of the Ceremonies, as you know. After Twelve, age isn\u0027t important. Most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes, though the information is in the Hall of Open Records, and we could go and look it up if we wanted to. What\u0027s important is the preparation for adult life, and the training you\u0027ll receive in your Assignment.\"\\n\\n \"I know that,\" Jonas said. \"Everyone knows that.\"\\n\\n \"But it means,\" his mother went on, \"that you\u0027ll move into a new group. And each of your friends will. You\u0027ll no longer be spending your time with your group of Elevens. After the Ceremony of Twelve, you\u0027ll be with your Assignment group, with those in training. No more volunteer hours. No more recreation hours. So your friends will no longer be as close.\"\\n\\n Jonas shook his head. \"Asher and I will always be friends,\" he said firmly. \"And there will still be school.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true,\" his father agreed. \"But what your mother said is true as well. There will be changes.\"\\n\\n \"Good changes, though,\" his mother pointed out. \"After my Ceremony of Twelve, I missed my childhood recreation. But when I entered my training for Law and Justice, I found myself with people who shared my interests. I made friends on a new level, friends of all ages.\"\\n\\n \"Did you still play at all, after Twelve?\" Jonas asked.\\n\\n \"Occasionally,\" his mother replied. \"But it didn\u0027t seem as important to me.\"\\n\\n \"I did,\" his father said, laughing. \"I still do. Every day, at the Nurturing Center, I play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and hug-the-teddy.\" He reached over and stroked Jonas\u0027s neatly trimmed hair. \"Fun doesn\u0027t end when you become Twelve.\"\\n\\n Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. \"This is certainly a very long private conversation,\" she said. \"And there are certain people waiting for their comfort object.\"\\n\\n \"Lily,\" her mother said fondly, \"you\u0027re very close to being an Eight, and when you\u0027re an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.\"\\n\\n But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily\u0027s, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas\u0027s had been called a bear.\\n\\n \"Here you are, Lily-billy,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll come help you remove your hair ribbons.\"\\n\\n Jonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched affectionately as Lily and her father headed to her sleeping-room with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort object when she was born. His mother moved to her big desk and opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even when she was at home in the evening. Jonas went to his own desk and began to sort through his school papers for the evening\u0027s assignment. But his mind was still on December and the coming Ceremony.\\n\\n Though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he hadn\u0027t the slightest idea what Assignment the Elders would be selecting for his future, or how he might feel about it when the day came.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n \"Oh, look!\" Lily squealed in delight. \"Isn\u0027t he cute? Look how tiny he is! And he has funny eyes like yours, Jonas!\" Jonas glared at her. He didn\u0027t like it that she had mentioned his eyes. He waited for his father to chastise Lily. But Father was busy unstrapping the carrying basket from the back of his bicycle. Jonas walked over to look.\\n\\n It was the first thing Jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild peering up curiously from the basket. The pale eyes.\\n\\n Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. His parents did, and Lily did, and so did all of his group members and friends. But there were a few exceptions: Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed had the different, lighter eyes. No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals. Lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, or she would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive chatter.\\n\\n Father put his bike into its port. Then he picked up the basket and carried it into the house. Lily followed behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder at Jonas and teased, \"Maybe he had the same Birthmother as you.\"\\n\\n Jonas shrugged. He followed them inside. But he had been startled by the newchild\u0027s eyes. Mirrors were rare in the community; they weren\u0027t forbidden, but there was no real need of them, and Jonas had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when he found himself in a location where a mirror existed. Now, seeing the newchild and its expression, he was reminded that the light eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a certain look—what was it? Depth, he decided; as if one were looking into the clear water of the river, down to the bottom, where things might lurk which hadn\u0027t been discovered yet. He felt self-conscious, realizing that he, too, had that look.\\n\\n He went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the newchild. On the other side of the room, Mother and Lily were bending over to watch as Father unwrapped its blanket.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s his comfort object called?\" Lily asked, picking up the stuffed creature which had been placed beside the newchild in his basket.\\n\\n Father glanced at it. \"Hippo,\" he said.\\n\\n Lily giggled at the strange word. \"Hippo,\" she repeated, and put the comfort object down again. She peered at the unwrapped newchild, who waved his arms.\\n\\n \"I think newchildren are so cute,\" Lily sighed. \"I hope I get assigned to be a Birthmother.\"\\n\\n \"Lily!\" Mother spoke very sharply. \"Don\u0027t say that. There\u0027s very little honor in that Assignment.\"\\n\\n \"But I was talking to Natasha. You know the Ten who lives around the corner? She does some of her volunteer hours at the Birthing Center. And she told me that the Birthmothers get wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods, and most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while they\u0027re waiting. I think I\u0027d like that,\" Lily said petulantly.\\n\\n \"Three years,\" Mother told her firmly. \"Three births, and that\u0027s all. After that they are Laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the day that they enter the House of the Old. Is that what you want, Lily? Three lazy years, and then hard physical labor until you are old?\"\\n\\n \"Well, no, I guess not,\" Lily acknowledged reluctantly.\\n\\n Father turned the newchild onto his tummy in the basket. He sat beside it and rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. \"Anyway, Lily-billy,\" he said affectionately, \"the Birthmothers never even get to see newchildren. If you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope for an Assignment as Nurturer.\"\\n\\n \"When you\u0027re an Eight and start your volunteer hours, you can try some at the Nurturing Center,\" Mother suggested.\\n\\n \"Yes, I think I will,\" Lily said. She knelt beside the basket. \"What did you say his name is? Gabriel? Hello, Gabriel,\" she said in a singsong voice. Then she giggled. \"Ooops,\" she whispered. \"I think he\u0027s alseep. I guess I\u0027d better be quiet.\"\\n\\n Jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk. Some chance of that, he thought. Lily was never quiet. Probably she should hope for an Assignment as Speaker, so that she could sit in the office with the microphone all day, making announcements. He laughed silently to himself, picturing his sister droning on in the self-important voice that all the Speakers seemed to develop, saying things like, ATTENTION, THIS IS A REMINDER TO FEMALES UNDER NINE THAT HAIR RIBBONS ARE TO BE NEATLY TIED AT ALL TIMES.\\n\\n He turned toward Lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her ribbons were, as usual, undone and dangling. There would be an announcement like that quite soon, he felt certain, and it would be directed mainly at Lily, though her name, of course, would not be mentioned. Everyone would know.\\n\\n Everyone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the announcement ATTENTION, THIS IS A REMINDER TO MALE ELEVENS THAT OBJECTS ARE NOT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE RECREATION AREA AND THAT SNACKS ARE TO BE EATEN, NOT HOARDED had been specifically directed at him, the day last month that he had taken an apple home. No one had mentioned it, not even his parents, because the public announcement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate remorse. He had, of course, disposed of the apple and made his apology to the Recreation Director the next morning, before school.\\n\\n Jonas thought again about that incident. He was still bewildered by it. Not by the announcement or the necessary apology; those were standard procedures, and he had deserved them—but by the incident itself. He probably should have brought up his feeling of bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared their feelings of the day. But he had not been able to sort out and put words to the source of his confusion, so he had let it pass.\\n\\n It had happened during the recreation period, when he had been playing with Asher. Jonas had casually picked up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept, and had thrown it to his friend. Asher had thrown it back, and they had begun a simple game of catch.\\n\\n There had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he had performed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. It was effortless for Jonas, and even boring, though Asher enjoyed it, and playing catch was a required activity for Asher because it would improve his hand-eye coordination, which was not up to standards.\\n\\n But suddenly Jonas had noticed, following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes, that the piece of fruit had—well, this was the part that he couldn\u0027t adequately understand—the apple had changed. Just for an instant. It had changed in mid-air, he remembered. Then it was in his hand, and he looked at it carefully, but it was the same apple. Unchanged. The same size and shape: a perfect sphere. The same nondescript shade, about the same shade as his own tunic.\\n\\n There was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. He had tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times, then thrown it again to Asher. And again—in the air, for an instant only—it had changed.\\n\\n It had happened four times. Jonas had blinked, looked around, and then tested his eyesight, squinting at the small print on the identification badge attached to his tunic. He read his name quite clearly. He could also clearly see Asher at the other end of the throwing area. And he had had no problem catching the apple. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-3.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) \\n Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
