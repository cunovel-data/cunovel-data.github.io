Jonas stowed his bicycle beside Mother\u0027s and made his way through the throng to find his group.\n The entire community attended the Ceremony each year. For the parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in the huge hall. Children sat with their groups until they went, one by one, to the stage.\n Father, though, would not join Mother in the audience right away. For the earliest ceremony, the Naming, the Nurturers brought the newchildren to the stage. Jonas, from his place in the balcony with the Elevens, searched the Auditorium for a glimpse of Father. It wasn\u0027t at all hard to spot the Nurturers\u0027 section at the front; coming from it were the wails and howls of the newchildren who sat squirming on the Nurturers\u0027 laps. At every other public ceremony, the audience was silent and attentive. But once a year, they all smiled indulgently at the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names and families.\n Jonas finally caught his father\u0027s eye and waved. Father grinned and waved back, then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap, making it wave, too.\n It wasn\u0027t Gabriel. Gabe was back at the Nurturing Center today, being cared for by the night crew. He had been given an unusual and special reprieve from the committee, and granted an additional year of nurturing before his Naming and Placement. Father had gone before the committee with a plea on behalf of Gabriel, who had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family unit. Normally such a newchild would be labeled Inadequate and released from the community.\n Instead, as a result of Father\u0027s plea, Gabriel had been labeled Uncertain and given the additional year. He would continue to be nurtured at the Center and would spend his nights with Jonas\u0027s family unit. Each family member, including Lily, had been required to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protest or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next year\u0027s Ceremony.\n At least, Jonas thought, after Gabriel was placed next year, they would still see him often because he would be part of the community. If he were released, they would not see him again. Ever. Those who were released—even as newchildren—were sent Elsewhere and never returned to the community.\n Father had not had to release a single newchild this year, so Gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness. Even Jonas, though he didn\u0027t hover over the little one the way Lily and his father did, was glad that Gabe had not been released.\n The first Ceremony began right on time, and Jonas watched as one after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the Nurturers to its new family unit. For some, it was a first child. But many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way Jonas had when he was about to be a Five.\n Asher poked Jonas\u0027s arm. \"Remember when we got Phillipa?\" he asked in a loud whisper. Jonas nodded. It had only been last year. Asher\u0027s parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a second child. Maybe, Jonas suspected, they had been so exhausted by Asher\u0027s lively foolishness that they had needed a little time.\n Two of their group, Fiona and another female named Thea, were missing temporarily, waiting with their parents to receive newchildren. But it was rare that there was such an age gap between children in a family unit.\n When her family\u0027s ceremony was completed, Fiona took the seat that had been saved for her in the row ahead of Asher and Jonas. She turned and whispered to them, \"He\u0027s cute. But I don\u0027t like his name very much.\" She made a face and giggled. Fiona\u0027s new brother had been named Bruno. It wasn\u0027t a great name, Jonas thought, like—well, like Gabriel, for example. But it was okay.\n The audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each Naming, rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with pride, took a male newchild and heard him named Caleb.\n This new Caleb was a replacement child. The couple had lost their first Caleb, a cheerful little Four. Loss of a child was very, very rare. The community was extraordinarily safe, each citizen watchful and protective of all children. But somehow the first little Caleb had wandered away unnoticed, and had fallen into the river. The entire community had performed the Ceremony of Loss together, murmuring the name Caleb throughout an entire day, less and less frequently, softer in volume, as the long and somber day went on, so that the little Four seemed to fade away gradually from everyone\u0027s consciousness.\n Now, at this special Naming, the community performed the brief Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, repeating the name for the first time since the loss: softly and slowly at first, then faster and with greater volume, as the couple stood on the stage with the newchild sleeping in the mother\u0027s arms. It was as if the first Caleb were returning.\n Another newchild was given the name Roberto, and Jonas remembered that Roberto the Old had been released only last week. But there was no Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony for the new little Roberto. Release was not the same as Loss.\n He sat politely through the ceremonies of Two and Three and Four, increasingly bored as he was each year. Then a break for midday meal—served outdoors—and back again to the seats, for the Fives, Sixes, Sevens, and finally, last of the first day\u0027s ceremonies, the Eights.\n Jonas watched and cheered as Lily marched proudly to the stage, became an Eight and received the identifying jacket that she would wear this year, this one with smaller buttons and, for the first time, pockets, indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track of her own small belongings. She stood solemnly listening to the speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of Eight and doing volunteer hours for the first time. But Jonas could see that Lily, though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row of gleaming bicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to the Nines.\n Next year, Lily-billy, Jonas thought.\n It was an exhausting day, and even Gabriel, retrieved in his basket from the Nurturing Center, slept soundly that night.\n Finally it was the morning of the Ceremony of Twelve.\n Now Father sat beside Mother in the audience. Jonas could see them applauding dutifully as the Nines, one by one, wheeled their new bicycles, each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back, from the stage. He knew that his parents cringed a little, as he did, when Fritz, who lived in the dwelling next door to theirs, received his bike and almost immediately bumped into the podium with it. Fritz was a very awkward child who had been summoned for chastisement again and again. His transgressions were small ones, always: shoes on the wrong feet, schoolwork misplaced, failure to study adequately for a quiz. But each such error reflected negatively on his parents\u0027 guidance and infringed on the community\u0027s sense of order and success. Jonas and his family had not been looking forward to Fritz\u0027s bicycle, which they realized would probably too often be dropped on the front walk instead of wheeled neatly into its port.\n Finally the Nines were all resettled in their seats, each having wheeled a bicycle outside where it would be waiting for its owner at the end of the day. Everyone always chuckled and made small jokes when the Nines rode home for the first time. \"Want me to show you how to ride?\" older friends would call. \"I know you\u0027ve never been on a bike before!\" But invariably the grinning Nines, who in technical violation of the rule had been practicing secretly for weeks, would mount and ride off in perfect balance, training wheels never touching the ground.\n Then the Tens. Jonas never found the Ceremony of Ten particularly interesting—only time-consuming, as each child\u0027s hair was snipped neatly into its distinguishing cut: females lost their braids at Ten, and males, too, relinquished their long childish hair and took on the more manly short style which exposed their ears.\n Laborers moved quickly to the stage with brooms and swept away the mounds of discarded hair. Jonas could see the parents of the new Tens stir and murmur, and he knew that this evening, in many dwellings, they would be snipping and straightening the hastily done haircuts, trimming them into a neater line.\n Elevens. It seemed a short time ago that Jonas had undergone the Ceremony of Eleven, but he remembered that it was not one of the more interesting ones. By Eleven, one was only waiting to be Twelve. It was simply a marking of time with no meaningful changes. There was new clothing: different undergarments for the females, whose bodies were beginning to change; and longer trousers for the males, with a specially shaped pocket for the small calculator that they would use this year in school; but those were simply presented in wrapped packages without an accompanying speech.\n Break for midday meal. Jonas realized he was hungry. He and his groupmates congregated by the tables in front of the Auditorium and took their packaged food. Yesterday there had been merriment at lunch, a lot of teasing and energy. But today the group stood anxiously, separate from the other children. Jonas watched the new Nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles, each one admiring his or her nametag. He saw the Tens stroking their new shortened hair, the females shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness without the heavy braids they had worn so long.\n \"I heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be assigned Engineer,\" Asher muttered as they ate, \"and instead they gave him Sanitation Laborer. He went out the next day, jumped into the river, swam across, and joined the next community he came to. Nobody ever saw him again.\"\n Jonas laughed. \"Somebody made that story up, Ash,\" he said. \"My father said he heard that story when he was a Twelve.\"\n But Asher wasn\u0027t reassured. He was eyeing the river where it was visible behind the Auditorium. \"I can\u0027t even swim very well,\" he said. \"My swimming instructor said that I don\u0027t have the right boyishness or something.\"\n \"Buoyancy,\" Jonas corrected him.\n \"Whatever. I don\u0027t have it. I sink.\"\n \"Anyway,\" Jonas pointed out, \"have you ever once known of anyone—I mean really known for sure, Asher, not just heard a story about it—who joined another community?\"\n \"No,\" Asher admitted reluctantly. \"But you can. It says so in the rules. If you don\u0027t fit in, you can apply for Elsewhere and be released. My mother says that once, about ten years ago, someone applied and was gone the next day.\" Then he chuckled. \"She told me that because I was driving her crazy. She Threatened to apply for Elsewhere.\"\n \"She was joking.\"\n \"I know. But it was true, what she said, that someone did that once. She said that it was really true. Here today and gone tomorrow. Never seen again. Not even a Ceremony of Release.\"\n Jonas shrugged. It didn\u0027t worry him. How could someone not fit in? The community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\n Even the Matching of Spouses was given such weighty consideration that sometimes an adult who applied to receive a spouse waited months or even years before a Match was approved and announced. All of the factors—disposition, energy level, intelligence, and interests—had to correspond and to interact perfectly. Jonas\u0027s mother, for example, had higher intelligence than his father; but his father had a calmer disposition. They balanced each other. Their Match, which like all Matches had been monitored by the Committee of Elders for three years before they could apply for children, had always been a successful one. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-6.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) \n Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
