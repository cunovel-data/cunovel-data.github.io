But it was my job. It was what I had to do, the way I\u0027ve had to do it to you.\"\\n\\n The room was silent. Jonas waited. Finally The Giver continued.\\n\\n \"Five weeks. That was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on a merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. Sometimes I chose one just because I knew it would make her laugh, and I so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room that had always been so silent.\\n\\n \"But she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. She knew that it was her responsibility. And so she asked me for more difficult memories.\"\\n\\n Jonas held his breath for a moment. \"You didn\u0027t give her war, did you? Not after just five weeks?\"\\n\\n The Giver shook his head and sighed. \"No. And I didn\u0027t give her physical pain. But I gave her loneliness. And I gave her loss. I transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents. That was the first one. She appeared stunned at its end.\"\\n\\n Jonas swallowed. Rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem real to him, and he pictured her looking up from the bed of memories, shocked.\\n\\n The Giver continued. \"I backed off, gave her more little delights. But everything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in her eyes.\"\\n\\n \"She wasn\u0027t brave enough?\" Jonas suggested.\\n\\n The Giver didn\u0027t respond to the question. \"She insisted that I continue, that I not spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, of course, that she was correct.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. But I gave her anguish of many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror.\\n\\n \"I had to, Jonas. It was my job. And she had been chosen.\" The Giver looked at him imploringly. Jonas stroked his hand.\\n\\n \"Finally one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard session. I tried to finish—as I do with you—by transferring something happy and cheerful. But the times of laughter were gone by then. She stood up very silently, frowning, as if she were making a decision. Then she came over to me and put her arms around me. She kissed my cheek.\" As Jonas watched, The Giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of Rosemary\u0027s lips ten years before.\\n\\n \"She left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her dwelling. I was notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to the Chief Elder and asked to be released.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s against the rules! The Receiver-in-training can\u0027t apply for rel—\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn\u0027t in hers. She asked for release, and they had to give it to her. I never saw her again.\"\\n\\n So that was the failure, Jonas thought. It was obvious that it saddened The Giver very deeply. But it didn\u0027t seem such a terrible thing, after all. And he, Jonas, would never have done it—never have requested release, no matter now difficult his training became. The Giver needed a successor, and he had been chosen.\\n\\n A thought occurred to Jonas. Rosemary had been released very early in her training. What if something happened to him, Jonas? He had a whole year\u0027s worth of memories now.\\n\\n \"Giver,\" he asked, \"I can\u0027t request release, I know that. But what if something happened: an accident? What if I fell into the river like the little Four, Caleb, did? Well, that doesn\u0027t make sense because I\u0027m a good swimmer. But what if I couldn\u0027t swim, and fell into the river and was lost? Then there wouldn\u0027t be a new Receiver, but you would already have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even though they would select a new Receiver, the memories would be gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? And then what if—\"\\n\\n He started to laugh, suddenly. \"I sound like my sister, Lily,\" he said, amused at himself.\\n\\n The Giver looked at him gravely. \"You just stay away from the river, my friend,\" he said. \"The community lost Rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster for them. I don\u0027t know what the community would do if they lost you.\"\\n\\n \"Why was it a disaster?\"\\n\\n \"I think I mentioned to you once,\" The Giver reminded him, \"that when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. If you were to be lost in the river, Jonas, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are forever.\\n\\n \"Rosemary had only those five weeks worth, and most of them were good ones. But there were those few terrible memories, the ones that had overwhelmed her. For a while they overwhelmed the community. All those feelings! They\u0027d never experienced that before.\\n\\n \"I was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own feeling of failure, that I didn\u0027t even try to help them through it. I was angry, too.\"\\n\\n The Giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. \"You know,\" he said, finally, \"if they lost you, with all the training you\u0027ve had now, they\u0027d have all those memories again themselves.\"\\n\\n Jonas made a face. \"They\u0027d hate that.\"\\n\\n \"They certainly would. They wouldn\u0027t know how to deal with it at all.\"\\n\\n \"The only way / deal with it is by having you there to help me,\" Jonas pointed out with a sigh.\\n\\n The Giver nodded. \"I suppose,\" he said slowly, \"that I could—\"\\n\\n \"You could what?\"\\n\\n The Giver was still deep in thought. After a moment, he said, \"If you floated off in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community the way I\u0027ve helped you. It\u0027s an interesting concept. I need to think about it some more. Maybe we\u0027ll talk about it again sometime. But not now.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re a good swimmer, Jonas. But stay away from the river.\" He laughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. His thoughts seemed to be elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled.\\n\\n 19\\n\\n Jonas glanced at the clock. There was so much work to be done, always, that he and The Giver seldom simply sat and talked, the way they just had.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry that I wasted so much time with my questions,\" Jonas said. \"I was only asking about release because my father is releasing a newchild today. A twin. He has to select one and release the other one. They do it by weight.\" Jonas glanced at the clock. \"Actually, I suppose he\u0027s already finished. I think it was this morning.\"\\n\\n The Giver\u0027s face took on a solemn look. \"I wish they wouldn\u0027t do that,\" he said quietly, almost to himself.\\n\\n \"Well, they can\u0027t have two identical people around! Think how confusing it would be!\" Jonas chuckled.\\n\\n \"I wish I could watch,\" he added, as an afterthought. He liked the thought of seeing his father perform the ceremony, and making the little twin clean and comfy. His father was such a gentle man.\\n\\n \"You can watch,\" The Giver said.\\n\\n \"No,\" Jonas told him. \"They never let children watch. It\u0027s very private.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas,\" The Giver told him, \"I know that you read your training instructions very carefully. Don\u0027t you remember that you are allowed to ask anyone anything?\"\\n\\n Jonas nodded. \"Yes, but—\"\\n\\n \"Jonas, when you and I have finished our time together, you will be the new Receiver. You can read the books; you\u0027ll have the memories. You have access to everything. It\u0027s part of your training. If you want to watch a release, you have simply to ask.\"\\n\\n Jonas shrugged. \"Well, maybe I will, then. But it\u0027s too late for this one. I\u0027m sure it was this morning.\"\\n\\n The Giver told him, then, something he had not known. \"All private ceremonies are recorded. They\u0027re in the Hall of Closed Records. Do you want to see this morning\u0027s release?\"\\n\\n Jonas hesitated. He was afraid that his father wouldn\u0027t like it, if he watched something so private.\\n\\n \"I think you should,\" The Giver told him firmly.\\n\\n \"All right, then,\" Jonas said. \"Tell me how.\"\\n\\n The Giver rose from his chair, went to the speaker on the wall, and clicked the switch from OFF to ON.\\n\\n The voice spoke immediately. \"Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?\"\\n\\n \"I would like to see this morning\u0027s release of the twin.\"\\n\\n \"One moment, Receiver. Thank you for your instructions.\"\\n\\n Jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. Its blank face began to flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers appeared, followed by the date and time. He was astonished and delighted that this was available to him, and surprised that he had not known.\\n\\n Suddenly he could see a small windowless room, empty except for a bed, a table with some equipment on it—Jonas recognized a scale; he had seen them before, when he\u0027d been doing volunteer hours at the Nurturing Center— and a cupboard. He could see pale carpeting on the floor.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just an ordinary room,\" he commented. \"I thought maybe they\u0027d have it in the Auditorium, so that everybody could come. All the Old go to Ceremonies of Release. But I suppose that when it\u0027s just a newborn, they don\u0027t—\"\\n\\n \"Shhh,\" The Giver said, his eyes on the screen.\\n\\n Jonas\u0027s father, wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tiny newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. A uniformed woman followed through the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a similar blanket.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my father.\" Jonas found himself whispering, as if he might wake the little ones if he spoke aloud. \"And the other Nurturer is his assistant. She\u0027s still in training, but she\u0027ll be finished soon.\"\\n\\n The two Nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical newborns on the bed. They were naked. Jonas could see that they were males.\\n\\n He watched, fascinated, as his father gently lifted one and then the other to the scale and weighed them.\\n\\n He heard his father laugh. \"Good,\" his father said to the woman. \"I thought for a moment that they might both be exactly the same. Then we\u0027d have a problem. But this one,\" he handed one, after rewrapping it, to his assistant, \"is six pounds even. So you can clean him up and dress him and take him over to the Center.\"\\n\\n The woman took the newchild and left through the door she had entered.\\n\\n Jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on the bed. \"And you, little guy, you\u0027re only five pounds ten ounces. A shrimp!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the special voice he uses with Gabriel,\" Jonas remarked, smiling.\\n\\n \"Watch,\" The Giver said.\\n\\n \"Now he cleans him up and makes him comfy,\" Jonas told him. \"He told me.\"\\n\\n \"Be quiet, Jonas,\" The Giver commanded in a strange voice. \"Watch.\"\\n\\n Obediently Jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what would happen next. He was especially curious about the ceremony part.\\n\\n His father turned and opened the cupboard. He rook out a syringe and a small bottle. Very carefully he inserted the needle into the bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid.\\n\\n Jonas winced sympathetically. He had forgotten that newchildren had to get shots. He hated shots himself, though he knew that they were necessary.\\n\\n To his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle into the top of newchild\u0027s forehead, puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed. The newborn squirmed, and wailed faintly.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s he—\"\\n\\n \"Shhh,\" The Giver said sharply.\\n\\n His father was talking, and Jonas realized that he was hearing the answer to the question he had started to ask. Still in the special voice, his father was saying, \"I know, I know. It hurts, little guy. But I have to use a vein, and the veins in your arms are still too teeny-weeny.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-18.html","bookId":1701,"book":{"id":1701,"title":"The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1)","description":"Storyline: The Giver (The Giver Quartet #1) \\n Jonas\u0027 world is perfect.
