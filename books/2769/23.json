I bury my head in his chest, soaking up the warmth of his embrace. “Promise me you’ll always be honest with me, Luis.” “I promise.” 27 Luis The second lie I just told my new girlfriend is that I’d be honest with her. The first is that I’m not in the LB. If she knew I have a task to do for the Latino Blood, and I’m ordered to pack heat to prove my allegiance, I’d lose her. I understand that makes me a selfish bastard, but I don’t want to give up the chance at having Nikki be a part of my life. The back door opens. It’s Brittany, holding Paco in her arms. The second she sees us, she gasps. “Oops, sorry,” she says, backing up. “I didn’t mean to interrupt. Paco was looking for you, Luis, and your mom said you were outside. I didn’t know you were with someone.” She squints in confusion as recognition sets in. “Nikki Cruz, is that you?” “Yeah,” Nikki says, stepping away from me. “Oh. Wow, okay. I didn’t know you and Luis were, um, friends.” “We’re kinda more than that,” I tell my sister-in-law. “What’s going on? Are you guys, like, dating?” I drape an arm around Nikki, because it feels right and I want her close. She looks up at me, and I swear I can stare into her expressive dark brown eyes forever. “Yeah, we’re datin’,” I say without looking away from my girl. “Right, mi chava?” Our eyes are still locked on each other as Nikki smiles up at me and nods. “Does your mom know?” Brittany asks. “Not yet,” I tell her. Brittany laughs. “I think she’s got a pretty good idea. I caught her peeking out the kitchen window at least a dozen times since I came in. I had no clue you were out here with a girl … which completely explains why she was snooping. Mamá Fuentes protects her boys like a mother hen. I’m sure I won’t be any different when my son starts to discover girls. You remember that, Paco.” “Weese!” Paco yells, and squirms to get out of his mom’s grasp. “Paco, Tío Luis is busy,” she tells him. “He can’t play with you right now.” “It’s okay,” Nikki says, tearing her gaze away. “I have to go home anyway.” As soon as Brittany lets him down, Paco runs over to me. “How’s my little taquito?” I ask, picking him up and giving him a high five. “Shouldn’t you be asleep by now?” “Yes, he should,” Brittany chimes in, exasperated. “My son likes to be up all night and sleep all day … just like his father.” She places a hand over her growing stomach. “This one keeps me up all night, too. God help me.” “He’s a Fuentes,” I tell her proudly. “Right, Paco? You’re gonna have a little brother to boss around soon?” He nods. Brittany doesn’t. “Hopefully this one’s a girl. The male Fuenteses in this family are exhausting me. I don’t know how your mom survived living with three of you boys under one roof.” “Never a dull moment.” I faintly hear Carlos laughing. “It’s still not dull.” Alex calls Brittany back to the house, leaving me holding Paco. “Remember me?” Nikki asks, tickling my nephew’s stomach. “I’m Nikki.” “Ki-ki!” Paco yells. “Ki-ki-ki-ki. Ki-ki-ki-ki.” He bobs his head from side to side as if he’s singing a song. “We’re workin’ on his verbal skills,” I tell her. She gently smoothes a hand over Paco’s hair. “He’s perfect.” “So are you.” I lean in to kiss her, and for an instant an image of us repeating this moment in the future flashes across my mind … me, Nikki, and a child of our own. Nikki says, “I really have to go. We have school tomorrow, you know.” “I don’t want you to go.” “I know that you made the soccer team. I could watch your practice after school. We can hang out after.” “I’ve got to do something after practice.” A little task Chuy gave me that Nikki doesn’t need to know about. “But I’ll meet you later on.” “Okay,” she says, nodding. I can’t tell if she’s skeptical or not. We walk back in the house. Everyone is, unfortunately, still here. And, unfortunately, all eyes are on us. “I’m gonna walk Nikki to her car,” I announce to my family. I hand Paco to my brother. “Bye,” Nikki says, smiling shyly as she gives a nervous, general wave to everyone in the room. She walks up to mi\u0027amá. “It was really nice seeing you again, Mrs. Fuentes.” “Thank you,” mi\u0027amá responds politely. “Give my regards to your parents.” Regards to her parents? Suddenly mi\u0027amá has turned into a mild-mannered socialite. Is she putting on an act for Officer Reyes? Whatever it is, I’m grateful. Nikki and I walk to her car parked out front. She leans against her car door before opening it. “Hey,” she says, then bites down on her bottom lip nervously. “Hey.” “You know that’s our routine, right?” she says. “You always say ‘Hey’ to me, and I say ‘Hey’ back. Or I say ‘Hey’ to you, and you say it back to me.” I smile. She would pay attention to something like that. I look down at those sweet lips I’m dying to taste again. “Hey,” I whisper as I bend down to kiss her. “Hey,” she whispers softly against my lips. She puts a hand on my chest. “Um, before we go ahead and make out … I think you should know that your family is watching us.” I glance back at the house. The lights are suddenly off, and I can make out the shadows of my family spying through the front window. “This is embarrassin’,” I mumble. “Call me later,” she says as she opens her car door. “Wait, aren’t we gonna kiss?” Seriously, now that I have a girlfriend, I’m gonna reap the benefits. Hell, the way my week has been going I figure being liplocked with her will keep me sane. She gives me a peck. “There.” “My cousin Elena’s stupid kisses are better than that, Nik. Come on, mi chava, throw me a bone here.” “I told you, we have an audience,” she says. I shrug. “I don’t care. Let’s give ’em somethin’ worth watchin’. My back is facin’ them, so they won’t see much.” She wraps her arms around my neck. I moan, loving the feeling of her body leaning against mine. It’s dark and quiet outside with only the streetlights giving off a yellow glow. Nikki knows how to get me fired up with a mere touch of her lips, and she uses that to her advantage. Her soft lips brush against mine, over and over. We start making out. Good thing my back is hiding our hot embrace. A car driving by honks repeatedly and stops beside her car, ruining the moment. “Gettin’ lucky, Fuentes?” a familiar voice yells out the window. It’s Marco. Nikki freezes, then buries her face in my chest in an attempt to hide her identity. It’s no use, though, because her car is a dead giveaway. My hands are braced against the car, shielding her even though I know it’s useless. “What’s up, Delgado?” I ask. He sticks his head out the window. “Obviously not as much as you and Nikki. Just a tip: she likes it when you lick her behind her ear.” “Thanks for the advice, man, but I think I can figure it out on my own,” I tell him. “Now get the fuck out of here.” Marco’s laugh lingers as he screeches away and disappears down the block. “Is he gone?” she asks, her voice muffled because she’s still got her head buried in my chest. “Yeah. Don’t worry. I’ll tell Marco to lay off.” I tip her chin up so I can get lost in her soulful eyes again. “My goal is to make you forget you ever dated him.” I lean down to kiss her again, but she pulls back. “I just, you know, need to say something before I leave. I don’t want to be worrying about it all night.” “Hit me with it.” “I won’t have sex with you,” she blurts out. Her words slam into my libido like a bucket of water on a flame full of testosterone. I think my dick just twitched in protest. “Like, ever?” I ask. “I just don’t want our relationship to be about sex and nothing else,” she says. “If we remove the sex expectation right now, it’ll be better.” Better for who? “I don’t want us to be all about sex, either, Nik, but I got to be honest … I was hopin’ it’d be part of it at some point.” She glances to her left and right, as if she wants to make sure nobody else can hear our conversation. “I just can’t. Too many complications, you know.” No, I don’t know. Do I even want to know? Shit. Is this about Marco? Or is this all about me? “I’ll understand if the no sex thing is a deal-breaker for you,” she says shyly. I’m not gonna lie. Just lookin’ at Nikki makes me horny, but it’s more than that. I like her. A lot. Enough to want to call her my girlfriend. I like just sitting with her and talking. The rest will come when she’s ready. “All right,” I tell her. “I’m cool with the no sex rule. But, uh, can we keep the option open to talk about it in the future? You know, just in case you change your mind.” “Yeah,” she says, lightly kissing me on the lips. “But don’t hold your breath that I will. We can do other things, though.” I raise my eyebrows, interested. “Like what?” “I’ll show you later.” She covers her mouth when a smile crosses her face. “I can’t talk about this when your mother is watching. I’ll see you tomorrow.” She gets in her car and pulls away just as mi\u0027amá opens our front door. “Is there something you need to tell me?” she asks before I step in the house and face the rest of the family. “Yeah. I have a girlfriend.” “Don’t you think a girlfriend will complicate your life?” “Sí, Mamá. It will complicate my life.” But not in the same way she thinks. The Latino Blood is a black cloud over my head. I wish finding out what Chuy is up to didn’t include me getting caught up in the Blood. But it has. “It’ll all work out.” “College is most important,” she says. “More important than girls. Don’t let anything sidetrack you from your goals, Luis. You’ll regret it the rest of your life.” Right now my goal is to get past tomorrow after soccer practice, when I’ll be going into Evanston. It’s my first errand for Chuy and another way to prove that I’m willing to take risks for the Blood. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit a part of me was looking forward to the challenge.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chain-reaction-perfect-chemistry-3/page-23.html","bookId":2769,"book":{"id":2769,"title":"Chain Reaction (Perfect Chemistry #3)","description":"Storyline: Chain Reaction (Perfect Chemistry #3) Like his brothers, Luis Fuentes is a risk taker; whether he\u0027s scaling the Rocky Mountains or dreaming of a future as an astronaut, Luis is always looking for the next thrill.
