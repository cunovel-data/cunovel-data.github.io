{"id":9921,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT.","content":"The chamber at the Albion Hotel occupied by Bernard was a small one, connecting by a side door with the larger one which had been taken by Professor Puffer. Bernard was not ordinarily suspicious, but his distrust of his traveling companion led him to examine carefully the door leading into the larger room. It seemed to be locked, but the key was probably in the other room, at the disposal of its occupant. This did not suit Bernard’s views, and he, with some difficulty, pushed up the bureau so that it would bar the entrance even if the door were opened. This Professor Puffer didn’t know. Both retired at a comparatively early hour. It was quite dark, when Bernard, rousing from a light slumber, thought he heard a noise near the door. He was instantly wide awake. Presently he heard a key grating in the lock, and then he saw the door behind the bureau open. There was a light in the adjoining room. By the help of this Bernard saw the figure and face of the professor as he peered into the room. Evidently he was surprised and disconcerted at the sight of the bureau. He looked over towards the bed, but this was in shadow, and he could not see Bernard gazing at him. He made an attempt to move the bureau, but it was heavy, and it could not be done without making a noise likely to wake a sleeper. “Confound it!” Bernard heard the professor mutter, and then, after a pause, he closed the door and locked it. “What was he going to do?” Bernard asked himself, not without alarm. “Did he wish to do me any harm?” This question was readily asked, but not so easily answered. Bernard remained awake for some time, being almost afraid to go to sleep. After a while, however, he reflected that Professor Puffer would not dare to make a second attempt. Besides, he was a light sleeper, and the noise which Puffer must unavoidably make would be sure to waken him. So after a while he fell asleep, and did not wake up till seven o’clock. His first step was to remove the bureau to its former place. Then he began to dress. He had nearly finished the process when a knock was heard at the door leading into the hall. Bernard opened it, and his glance rested on Professor Puffer. “Are you nearly ready to go down to breakfast?” asked the professor. “Yes, sir.” Unbidden Puffer entered the room and looked quickly towards the connecting door. He observed that the bureau had been removed. He frowned slightly, but did not refer to the matter. “Did you sleep well?” he asked. “Yes, sir,” answered Bernard. “So did I. I was conscious of nothing until I woke up this morning.” He glanced at Bernard, to see whether this statement made any impression upon him. He wished to ascertain whether Bernard had been aware of his attempted entrance during the night. Bernard made no comment. “Liverpool seems to be a good place to sleep,” he went on. “It seems good to step on shore after so long a time on shipboard.” “You are right.” “Are you ready to go down to breakfast?” “Yes, sir.” “Come down then. I feel hungry.” They went into the coffee room, and were soon served with mutton chops, beautiful, flaky potatoes, coffee, and bread and butter. The chops were good, and the coffee as good as the average British article of that name. In spite of the disturbance of the night before, Bernard enjoyed his breakfast. So, apparently, did the professor, but he did not say much. He appeared busy thinking. Presently a cheery voice was heard from the next table: “How are you, professor? Good morning, Bernard!” Looking up, Bernard saw that the speaker was Nelson Sturgis, the Boston buyer. “Good morning!” said Bernard, with real pleasure, for Mr. Sturgis had a pleasant manner, and he was glad to meet him. “Morning!” muttered Professor Puffer coldly. “Well, how do you like Liverpool?” “I don’t know. Have not had an opportunity to go about yet.” “Nor I. Come around with me, if you have nothing better to do.” “I don’t know whether Professor Puffer will require my company or not,” said Bernard, in a tone of hesitation. “No,” answered Professor Puffer. “If you wish to take a walk with Mr. Sturgis, I have no objection.” “Thank you, sir.” “You can report at half-past twelve or one, and we will dine then.” “All right, sir.” “How long do you remain in Liverpool, professor?” asked Nelson Sturgis. “I am not quite sure.” “You will be here to-night?” “Yes, sir; I shall be here to-night.” “So shall I. I expect to go to London to-morrow.” After breakfast Bernard put on his hat, and started out with his new friend. “Now, my boy, I am going to show you the town,” said Mr. Sturgis. “I shall be very much obliged to you, sir.” First they visited the docks, which are considered the most noteworthy feature of Liverpool. They extend for five miles along the margin of the river, and are built in the most solid and enduring manner. “I am a patriotic American,” observed Mr. Sturgis, “but I am obliged to confess that no American city can boast of docks that are equal to these.” “How many are there?” asked Bernard. “Over fifty, I believe. They have been built at immense expense. I hope to see the time when New York will have docks like them.” They visited some of the large squares, walked past St. George’s hall, the custom house, the free library and museum, and all these interested Bernard. “We can’t see everything,” said Mr. Sturgis, “but you now have some idea of Liverpool. Do you know how long we have been walking about?” “No, sir.” “Three hours. I begin to feel tired. Suppose we go back to the hotel.” “All right, sir. I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Sturgis, for showing me so much.” “I have enjoyed the walk myself. By the way, Bernard, at the risk of hurting your feelings, I will venture to say that I don’t much admire your traveling companion.” “Nor I, sir.” “I have wondered more than once what brought you together.” “My guardian. I never saw Professor Puffer till we went on board the Vesta.” “Do you expect to make a long tour with him?” “I don’t know, sir.” “Hasn’t he disclosed his plans to you?” “No, sir. I believe he is engaged on some literary work, and I am engaged to help him.” “Then, I suppose, you will settle down somewhere?” “I suppose so.” “Mr. Sturgis,” said Bernard, after a short pause, “I find myself in a difficult, not to say dangerous, position, and I would like to ask your advice.” Nelson Sturgis looked a little surprised, but he answered cordially: “Speak freely, Bernard. I will give you the best advice I can.” “First, I must tell you how I am situated.” Then Bernard gave an account of Professor Puffer’s attempt to throw him over the rail during the voyage. Mr. Sturgis listened in amazement. “I can hardly believe this,” he said. “Do you think the professor knew what he was talking about?” “Yes, sir, I fully believe it.” “What excuse did he make?” “He said that he was walking in his sleep.” “But what motive could he possibly have? It looks unaccountable.” “I can’t understand it myself, but I think he was acting under instructions from my guardian.” “What reason have you for thinking so?” In reply Bernard produced the fragment of a letter which he had picked up in the stateroom. “This certainly does look suspicious. Have you any idea why it is that your guardian wishes to get rid of you?” “Yes, sir. I met a gentleman before I left New York who knew my father. He tells me that he is certain that my father left property, and he thinks that Mr. McCracken has it in his possession, and is resolved to keep it.” “It is not unlikely. Does your guardian know that you have any suspicion of this?” “He knows that I met an old friend of my father’s, and he may suspect that Mr. Franklin has told me this.” “You certainly are in a difficult position,” said Nelson Sturgis thoughtfully. “Has anything happened since you arrived in Liverpool?” In reply Bernard told the incident of the night before. “I can’t understand why he wished to enter my room,” he concluded. “He would not dare attempt my life. Do you think so?” “It is hard to tell what to think. If you have any fear as to sleeping in your own room to-night, you will be welcome to share mine. I occupy No. 15.” “I will remember it, sir.” When, at ten o’clock Bernard went up to bed, he was struck as he entered the chamber by one significant circumstance. The bureau had disappeared!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2955/81268.html","bookId":434,"book":{"id":434,"title":"Bernard Brooks\u0027 Adventures","description":"简介： Youre a bad lot, Bernard Brooks.
