There she discovers an overgrown maze and a strange stone map-and lands back in time, in the Lochaber of 1654. \n Ewen, Chief of the Clan Cameron, must save his people from the brutal redcoats. But then he meets a saucy lass with a peculiar accent, no regard for his title-and an arousing body. Drawn to each other despite their differences, they both realize that they don\u0027t want her to go back to her own time. But with battles brewing, staying is a gamble.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/master-of-the-highlands-highlands-1.jpg","author":"Veronica Wolff","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":53,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
