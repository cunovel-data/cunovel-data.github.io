{"id":11367,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. DARK DEALING","content":"Only an honest man doing his duty. When Jack Meredith said that there was not another man in Africa who could make his way from Loango to the Simiacine Plateau he spoke no more than the truth. There were only four men in all the world who knew the way, and two of them were isolated on the summit of a lost mountain in the interior. Meredith himself was unfit for the journey. There remained Joseph. True, there were several natives who had made the journey, but they were as dumb and driven animals, fighting as they were told, carrying what they were given to carry, walking as many miles as they were considered able to walk. They hired themselves out like animals, and as the beasts of the field they did their work—patiently, without intelligence. Half of them did not know where they were going—what they were doing; the other half did not care. So much work, so much wage, was their terse creed. They neither noted their surroundings nor measured distance. At the end of their journey they settled down to a life of ease and leisure, which was to last until necessity drove them to work again. Such is the African. Many of them came from distant countries, a few were Zanzibaris, and went home made men. If any doubt the inability of such men to steer a course through the wood, let him remember that three months\u0027 growth in an African forest will obliterate the track left by the passage of an army. If any hold that men are not created so dense and unambitious as has just been represented, let him look nearer home in our own merchant service. The able-bodied seaman goes to sea all his life, but he never gets any nearer navigating the ship—and he a white man. In coming down to Loango, Joseph had had the recently-made track of Oscard\u0027s rescuing party to guide him day by day. He knew that this was now completely overgrown. The Simiacine Plateau was once more lost to all human knowledge. And up there—alone amidst the clouds—Guy Oscard was, as he himself tersely put it, “sticking to it.” He had stuck to it to such good effect that the supply of fresh young Simiacine was daily increasing in bulk. Again, Victor Durnovo seemed to have regained his better self. He was like a full-blooded horse—tractable enough if kept hard at work. He was a different man up on the Plateau to what he was down at Loango. There are some men who deteriorate in the wilds, while others are better, stronger, finer creatures away from the luxury of civilisation and the softening influence of female society. Of these latter was Victor Durnovo. Of one thing Guy Oscard soon became aware, namely, that no one could make the men work as could Durnovo. He had merely to walk to the door of his tent to make every picker on the little Plateau bend over his tree with renewed attention. And while above all was eagerness and hurry, below, in the valley, this man\u0027s name insured peace. The trees were now beginning to show the good result of pruning and a regular irrigation. Never had the leaves been so vigorous, never had the Simiacine trees borne such a bushy, luxuriant growth since the dim dark days of the Flood. Oscard relapsed into his old hunting ways. Day after day he tranquilly shouldered his rifle, and alone, or followed by one attendant only, he disappeared into the forest, only to emerge therefrom at sunset. What he saw there he never spoke of. Sure it was that he must have seen strange things, for no prying white man had set foot in these wilds before him; no book has ever been written of that country that lies around the Simiacine Plateau. He was not the man to worry himself over uncertainties. He had an enormous faith in the natural toughness of an Englishman, and while he crawled breathlessly in the track of the forest monsters he hardly gave a thought to Jack Meredith. Meredith, he argued to himself, had always risen to the occasion: why should he not rise to this? He was not the sort of man to die from want of staying power, which, after all, is the cause of more deaths than we dream of. And when he had recovered he would either return or send back Joseph with a letter containing those suggestions of his which were really orders. Of Millicent Chyne he thought more often, with a certain tranquil sense of a good time to come. In her also he placed a perfect faith. A poet has found out that, if one places faith in a man, it is probable that the man will rise to trustworthiness—of woman he says nothing. But of these things Guy Oscard knew little. He went his own tranquilly strong way, content to buy his own experience. He was thinking of Millicent Chyne one misty morning while he walked slowly backwards and forwards before his tent. His knowledge of the country told him that the mist was nothing but the night\u0027s accumulation of moisture round the summit of the mountain—that down in the valleys it was clear, and that half an hour\u0027s sunshine would disperse all. He was waiting for this result when he heard a rifle-shot far away in the haze beneath him; and he knew that it was Joseph—probably making one of those marvellous long shots of his which roused a sudden sigh of envy in the heart of this mighty hunter whenever he witnessed them. Oscard immediately went to his tent and came out with his short-barrelled, evil-looking rifle on his arm. He fired both barrels in quick succession and waited, standing gravely on the edge of the Plateau. After a short silence two answering reports rose up through the mist to his straining ears. He turned and found Victor Durnovo standing at his side. “What is that?” asked the half-breed. “It must be Joseph,” answered Guy, “or Meredith. It can be nobody else.” “Let us hope that it is Meredith,” said Durnovo with a forced laugh, “but I doubt it.” Oscard looked down in his sallow, powerful face. He was not quick at such things, but at that moment he felt strangely certain that Victor Durnovo was hoping that Meredith was dead. “I hope it isn\u0027t,” he answered, and without another word he strode away down the little pathway from the summit into the clouds, loading his rifle as he went. Durnovo and his men, working among the Simiacine bushes, heard from time to time a signal shot as the two Englishmen groped their way towards each other through the everlasting night of the African forest. It was midday before the new-comers were espied making their way painfully up the slope, and Joseph\u0027s welcome was not so much in Durnovo\u0027s handshake, in Guy Oscard\u0027s silent approval, as in the row of grinning, good-natured black faces behind Durnovo\u0027s back. That night laughter was heard in the men\u0027s camp for the first time for many weeks—nay, several months. According to the account that Joseph gave to his dusky admirers, he had been on terms of the closest familiarity with the wives, and families of all who had such at Loango or on the Coast. He knew the mother of one, had met the sweetheart of another, and confessed that it was only due to the fact that he was not “a marryin\u0027 man” that he had not stayed at Loango for the rest of his life. It was somewhat singular that he had nothing but good news to give. Durnovo heard the clatter of tongues, and Guy Oscard, smoking his contemplative pipe in a camp-chair before his hut door, noticed that the sound did not seem very welcome. Joseph\u0027s arrival with ten new men seemed to give a fresh zest to the work, and the carefully-packed cases of Simiacine began to fill Oscard\u0027s tent to some inconvenience. Thus things went on for two tranquil weeks. “First,” Oscard had said, “let us get the crop in and then we can arrange what is to be done about the future.” So the crop received due attention; but the two leaders of the men—he who led by fear and he who commanded by love—were watching each other. One evening, when the work was done, Oscard\u0027s meditations were disturbed by the sound of angry voices behind the native camp. He turned naturally towards Durnovo\u0027s tent, and saw that he was absent. The voices rose and fell: there was a singular accompanying roar of sound which Oscard never remembered having heard before. It was the protesting voice of a mass of men—and there is no sound like it—none so disquieting. Oscard listened attentively, and suddenly he was thrown up on his feet by a pistol-shot. At the same moment Joseph emerged from behind the tents, dragging some one by the collar. The victim of Joseph\u0027s violence was off his feet, but still struggling and kicking. Guy Oscard saw the flash of a second shot, apparently within a few inches of Joseph\u0027s face; but he came on, dragging the man with him, whom from his clothing Oscard saw to be Durnovo. Joseph was spitting out wadding and burnt powder. “Shoot ME, would yer—yer damned skulking chocolate-bird? I\u0027ll teach you! I\u0027ll twist that brown neck of yours.” He shook him as a terrier shakes a rat, and seemed to shake things off him—among others a revolver which described a circle in the air and fell heavily on the ground, where the concussion discharged a cartridge. “\u0027Ere, sir,” cried Joseph, literally throwing Durnovo down on the ground at Oscard\u0027s feet, “that man has just shot one o\u0027 them poor niggers, so \u0027elp me God!” Durnovo rose slowly to his feet, as if the shaking had disturbed his faculties. “And the man hadn\u0027t done \u0027im no harm at all. He\u0027s got a grudge against him. I\u0027ve seen that this last week and more. It\u0027s a man as was kinder fond o\u0027 me, and we understood each other\u0027s lingo. That\u0027s it—he was afraid of my \u0027earing things that mightn\u0027t be wholesome for me to know. The man hadn\u0027t done no harm. And Durnovo comes up and begins abusing \u0027im, and then he strikes \u0027im, and then he out with his revolver and shoots \u0027im down.” Durnovo gave an ugly laugh. He had readjusted his disordered dress and was brushing the dirt from his knees. “Oh, don\u0027t make a fool of yourself,” he said in a hissing voice; “you don\u0027t understand these natives at all. The man raised his hand to me. He would have killed me if he had had the chance. Shooting was the only thing left to do. You can only hold these men by fear. They expect it.” “Of course they expect it,” shouted Joseph in his face; “of course they expect it, Mr. Durnovo.” “Why?” “Because they\u0027re SLAVES. Think I don\u0027t know that?” He turned to Oscard. “This man, Mr. Oscard,” he said, “is a slave-owner. Them forty that joined at Msala was slaves. He\u0027s shot two of \u0027em now; this is his second. And what does he care?—they\u0027re his slaves. Oh! shame on yer!” turning again to Durnovo; “I wonder God lets yer stand there. I can only think that He doesn\u0027t want to dirty His hand by strikin\u0027 yer down.” Oscard had taken his pipe from his lips. He looked bigger, somehow, than ever. His brown face was turning to an ashen colour, and there was a dull, steel-like gleam in his blue eyes. The terrible, slow-kindling anger of this Northerner made Durnovo catch his breath. It was so different from the sudden passion of his own countrymen. “Is this true?” he asked. “It\u0027s a lie, of course,” answered Durnovo, with a shrug of the shoulders. He moved away as if he were going to his tent, but Oscard\u0027s arm reached out. His large brown hand fell heavily on the half-breed\u0027s shoulder. “Stay,” he said; “we are going to get to the bottom of this.” “Good,” muttered Joseph, rubbing his hands slowly together; “this is prime.” “Go on,” said Oscard to him. “Where\u0027s the wages you and Mr. Meredith has paid him for those forty men?” pursued Joseph. “Where\u0027s the advance you made him for those men at Msala? Not one ha\u0027penny of it have they fingered. And why? Cos they\u0027re slaves! Fifteen months at fifty pounds—let them as can reckon tot it up for theirselves. That\u0027s his first swindle—and there\u0027s others, sir! Oh, there\u0027s more behind. That man\u0027s just a stinkin\u0027 hotbed o\u0027 crime. But this \u0027ere slave-owning is enough to settle his hash, I take it.” “Let us have these men here—we will hear what they have to say,” said Oscard in the same dull tone that frightened Victor Durnovo. “Not you!” he went on, laying his hand on Durnovo\u0027s shoulder again; “Joseph will fetch them, thank you.” So the forty—or the thirty-seven survivors, for one had died on the journey up and two had been murdered—were brought. They were peaceful, timorous men, whose manhood seemed to have been crushed out of them; and slowly, word by word, their grim story was got out of them. Joseph knew a little of their language, and one of the head fighting men knew a little more, and spoke a dialect known to Oscard. They were slaves they said at once, but only on Oscard\u0027s promise that Durnovo should not be allowed to shoot them. They had been brought from the north by a victorious chief, who in turn had handed them over to Victor Durnovo in payment of an outstanding debt for ammunition supplied. The great African moon rose into the heavens and shone her yellow light upon this group of men. Overhead all was peace: on earth there was no peace. And yet it was one of Heaven\u0027s laws that Victor Durnovo had broken. Guy Oscard went patiently through to the end of it. He found out all that there was to find; and he found out something which surprised him. No one seemed to be horror-struck. The free men stood stolidly looking on, as did the slaves. And this was Africa—the heart of Africa, where, as Victor Durnovo said, no one knows what is going on. Oscard knew that he could apply no law to Victor Durnovo except the great law of humanity. There was nothing to be done, for one individual may not execute the laws of humanity. All were assembled before him—the whole of the great Simiacine Expedition except the leader, whose influence lay over one and all only second to his presence. “I leave this place at sunrise to-morrow,” said Guy Oscard to them all. “I never want to see it again. I will not touch one penny of the money that has been made. I speak for Mr. Meredith and myself—” “Likewise me—damn it!” put in Joseph. “I speak as Mr. Meredith himself would have spoken. There is the Simiacine—you can have it. I won\u0027t touch it. And now who is going with me—who leaves with me to-morrow morning?” He moved away from Durnovo. “And who stays with me?” cried the half-breed, “to share and share alike in the Simiacine?” Joseph followed Oscard, and with him a certain number of the blacks, but some stayed. Some went over to Durnovo and stood beside him. The slaves spoke among themselves, and then they all went over to Durnovo. So that which the placid moon shone down upon was the break-up of the great Simiacine scheme. Victor Durnovo had not come off so badly. He had the larger half of the men by his side. He had all the finest crop the trees had yielded—but he had yet to reckon with high Heaven. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2775/76822.html","bookId":1327,"book":{"id":1327,"title":"With Edged Tools","description":"简介： Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain.My dearMadamwhat you call heart does not come into the question at all.Sir John Meredith was sitting slightly behind Lady Cantourne, leaning towards her with a somewhat stiffened replica of his former grac...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2775","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
