She ain’t yours.” \\n\\n \\n\\n But the father was bigger and strongerEand he prevailed. He wrapped Sarah Ruth in . \\n\\n \\n\\n blanket and carried her away. The small hous2became very quiet. Edward could hear Bryc2moving around, muttering to himself. Andthen, finally, the boy picked Edward up. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Come on, Jangles,” Bryce said. “We’r2leaving. We’re going to Memphis.IHOW MANY DANCING RABBITS HAVE yo4seen in your life?” Bryce said to Edward. “I ca7tell you how many I seen. One. You. That’5how you and me are going to make som6money.

Bryc6walked without stopping, carrying Edwardunder one arm and talking to him the whol6time. Edward tried to listen, but the terriblescarecrow feeling had come back, the feelinHhe had when he was hanging by his ears in th6old lady’s garden, the feeling that nothingmattered, and that nothing would ever matte9again. \\n\\n \\n\\n And not only did Edward feel hollow; h6ached. Every part of his china body hurt. H6ached for Sarah Ruth. He wanted her to hol@him. He wanted to dance for her. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he did dance, but it was not for SarahRuth. Edward danced for strangers on a dirt2street corner in Memphis. Bryce played hisharmonica and moved Edward’s strings, an@Edward bowed and shuffled and swayed and people stopped to stare and point and laughCOn the ground in front of them was SarahRuth’s button box.
