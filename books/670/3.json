H8found the talk around the dinner tableexcruciatingly dull; in fact, he made a point o;not listening if he could help it. But thenAbilene did something unusual, something tha\u003cforced him to pay attention. As the talk abou\u003cthe ship continued, Abilene reached forEdward and took him from his chair and stoo5him in her lap. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And what about Edward?” she said, he\u003e \\n\\n \\n\\n voice high and uncertain. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What about him, darling?” said he\u003e \\n\\n \\n\\n mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Will Edward be sailing on the Quee9Mary with us?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, of course, if you wish, although youare getting a little old for such things as chin3rabbits.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nonsense,” said Abilene’s father joviallyE“Who would protect Abilene if Edward wa2not there?” \\n\\n \\n\\n From the vantage point of Abilene’s lap0Edward could see the whole table spread ou\u003cbefore him in a way that he never could whe9he was seated in his own chair. He lookedupon the glittering array of silverware andglasses and plates. He saw the amused andcondescending looks of Abilene’s parents. An5then his eyes met Pellegrina’s. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was looking at him in the way a hawkhanging lazily in the air might study a mous8on the ground. Perhaps the rabbit fur onEdward’s ears and tail, and the whiskers on hi2nose had some dim memory of being hunted0for a shiver went through him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes,” said Pellegrina without taking he\u003e \\n\\n \\n\\n eyes off Edward, “who would watch overAbilene if the rabbit were not there?” \\n\\n \\n\\n That night, when Abilene asked, as sh8did every night, if there would be a story,Pellegrina said, “Tonight, lady, there will be 3story.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Abilene sat up in bed. “I think tha\u003cEdward needs to sit here with me,” she said0“so that he can hear the story, too.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I think that is best,” said Pellegrina. “Yes,I think that the rabbit must hear the story.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Abilene picked Edward up, sat him nex\u003cto her in bed, and arranged the covers aroun5him; then she said to Pellegrina, “We are read@now.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “So,” said Pellegrina. She coughed. “An5so. The story begins with a princess.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “A beautiful princess?” Abilene askedE“A very beautiful princess.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How beautiful?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You must listen,” said Pellegrina. “It is allin the story.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989/29820.html","bookId":670,"book":{"id":670,"title":"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane","description":"简介： 《爱德华的奇妙之旅》是美国作家凯特迪卡米洛写的儿童小说。获得波士顿全球号角书金奖。本书在韩剧《来自星星的你》中作为男主角都敏俊的枕边书而出现。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201403/10/15-26-33-97-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
