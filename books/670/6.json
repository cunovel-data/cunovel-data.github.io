These were the questions that Edwar7asked himself as he went sailing out over th\u003e blue sea. The sun was high in the sky, andfrom what seemed to be a very long wayaway, Edward heard Abilene call his nameE“Edwaaarrd,” she shouted, “come back.HCome back? Of all the ridiculous things toshout, thought Edward. As he tumbled, ears over tail through th\u003e air, he managed to catch one last glimpse oBAbilene. She was standing on the deck of th\u003e ship, holding on to the railing with one handEIn her other hand was a lamp — no, it was /ball of fire — no, Edward realized, it was hi: gold pocket watch that Abilene held in herhand; she was holding it up high, and it wa: reflecting the light of the sun. My pocket watch, he thought. I need thatEAnd then Abilene disappeared from vie9and the rabbit hit the water with suchtremendous force that his hat blew off hishead. That answers that question, though6Edward as he watched the hat dance away o0the wind. And then he began to sink. He sank and sank and sank. He kept hi: eyes open the whole time. Not because he wa: brave, but because he had no choice. Hispainted-on eyes witnessed the blue waterturning to green and then to blue again. The\u003cwatched as it finally became as black as nightEEdward went down and down. He said t8himself, If I am going to drown, certainly Iwould have done so by now. Far above him, the ocean liner, wit2Abilene aboard it, sailed blithely on; and th\u003e china rabbit landed, finally, on the ocean floorFface-down; and there, with his head in themuck, he experienced his first genuine andtrue emotion.
