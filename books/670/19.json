He was walking on his own)putting one foot in front of the other withou\u003dany assistance from anybody. He was wearin3a fine suit made of red silk. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked down the sidewalk, and the2he turned onto a path that led up to a hous7with lighted windows. \\n\\n \\n\\n I knowthis house, thought Edward. This isAbilene’s house. I am on Egypt Street. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy came running out the front door o\u003e \\n\\n \\n\\n the house, barking and jumping and waggin3her tail. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Down, girl,” said a deep, gruff voice8Edward looked up and there was Bull)standing at the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hello, Malone,” said Bull. “Hello, goo4old rabbit pie. We’ve been waiting for you.HBull swung the door wide and Edward walke4inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abilene was there, and Nellie andLawrence and Bryce. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Susanna,” called Nellie. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Jangles,” said Bryce. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Edward,” said Abilene. She held out he? \\n\\n \\n\\n arms to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Edward stood still. He looked aroun4the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You searching for Sarah Ruth?” Bryc7asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Edward nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You got to go outside if you want to se7Sarah Ruth,” said Bryce. \\n\\n \\n\\n So they all went outside, Lucy and Bul/and Nellie and Lawrence and Bryce andAbilene and Edward. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Right there,” said Bryce. He pointed up atthe stars. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yep,” said Lawrence, “that is the Sara: \\n\\n \\n\\n Ruth constellation.” He picked Edward up an4put him on his shoulder. “You can see it righ\u003dthere.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Edward felt a pang of sorrow, deep an4sweet and familiar. Why did she have to be s5far away? \\n\\n \\n\\n If only I had wings, he thought, I could flyto her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Out of the corner of his eye, the rabbi\u003dsawsomething flutter. Edward looked over hi6shoulder and there they were, the mostmagnificent wings he had ever seen, orang7and red and blue and yellow. And they wer7on his back. They belonged to him. They wer7his wings. \\n\\n \\n\\n What a wonderful night this was! He wa6walking on his own. He had an elegant nesuit. And nowhe had wings. He could flyanywhere, do anything. Why had he neverrealized it before? \\n\\n \\n\\n His heart soared inside of him. He spreadhis wings and flewoff Lawrence’s shoulders)out of his hands and up into the nighttime sky)toward the stars, toward Sarah Ruth. \\n\\n \\n\\n “No!” shouted Abilene. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Catch him,” said Bryce. \\n\\n \\n\\n Edward flewhigher. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy barked. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Malone!” shouted Bull. And with . \\n\\n \\n\\n terrific lunge, he grabbed hold of Edward’s fee\u003dand pulled him out of the sky and wrestledhim to the earth. “You can’t go yet,” said Bull8“Stay with us,” said Abilene. \\n\\n \\n\\n Edward beat his wings, but it was no use8Bull held him firmly to the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Stay with us,” repeated Abilene. \\n\\n \\n\\n Edward started to cry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I couldn’t stand to lose you again,” sai4Nellie. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Neither could I,” said Abilene. “It woul4break my heart.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy bent her face to Edward’s. \\n\\n \\n\\n She licked his tears away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989/29836.html","bookId":670,"book":{"id":670,"title":"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane","description":"简介： 《爱德华的奇妙之旅》是美国作家凯特迪卡米洛写的儿童小说。获得波士顿全球号角书金奖。本书在韩剧《来自星星的你》中作为男主角都敏俊的枕边书而出现。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201403/10/15-26-33-97-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
