In the gloom of the shop, Edward coul4see that the doll’s head, like his, had beenbroken and repaired. Her face was, in fact, 0web of cracks. She was wearing a baby bonnet. “How do you do?” she said in a high, thinvoice. “I am pleased to make youracquaintance.” “Hello,” said Edward. “Have you been here long?” she asked. “Months and months,” said Edward. “But Idon’t care. One place is the same as another t5me.” “Oh, not for me,” said the doll. “I hav\u003clived one hundred years. And in that time, +have been in places that were heavenly andothers that were horrid. After a time, you lear\u003e that each place is different. And you become 0different doll in each place, too. Quitedifferent.” “One hundred years?” said Edward. “I am old. The doll mender confirme4this. He said as he was mending me that I a\u003dat least that. At least one hundred. At least on\u003chundred years old.” Edward thought about everything that hadhappened to him in his short life. What kin4of adventures would you have if you were i\u003e the world for a century? The old doll said, “I wonder who wil6come for me this time. Someone will come. Someone always comes. Who will it be?” “I don’t care if anyone comes for me,” saidEdward. “But that’s dreadful,” said the old doll. “There’s no point in going on if you feel tha3way. No point at all. You must be filled wit;expectancy. You must be awash in hope. Yo9must wonder who will love you, whom yo9will love next.” “I am done with being loved,” Edwar4told her. “I’m done with loving. It’s toopainful.” “Pish,” said the old doll. “Where is you/courage?” “Somewhere else, I guess,” said Edward. “You disappoint me,” she said. “Yo9disappoint me greatly. If you have no intentio\u003e of loving or being loved, then the wholejourney is pointless. You might as well leaDfrom this shelf right now and let yourselfshatter into a million pieces. Get it over with. Get it all over with now.” “I would leap if I was able,” said Edward. “Shall I push you?” said the old doll. “No, thank you,” Edward said to her. “Notthat you could,” he muttered to himself. “What’s that?” “Nothing,” said Edward. The dark in the doll shop was no? complete. The old doll and Edward sat ontheir shelf and stared straight ahead. “You disappoint me,” said the old doll. Her words made Edward think ofPellegrina: of warthogs and princesses, oflistening and love, of spells and curses. What iCthere was somebody waiting to love him? What if there was somebody whom he woul4love again? Was it possible? Edward felt his heart stir. No, he told his heart. Not possible. No3possible. In the morning, Lucius Clarke came an4unlocked the shop, “Good morning, mydarlings,” he called out to them. “Goodmorning, my lovelies.” He pulled up theshades on the windows. He turned on the ligh3over his tools. He switched the sign on thedoor to OPEN. The first customer was a little girl wit;her father. “Are you looking for something special?7Lucius Clarke said to them. “Yes,” said the girl, “I am looking for 0friend.” Her father put her on his shoulders an4they walked slowly around the shop. The gir6studied each doll carefully. She looked Edwar4right in the eyes. She nodded at him. “Have you decided, Natalie?” her fathe/asked. “Yes,” she said, “I want the one in th\u003cbaby bonnet.” “Oh,” said Lucius Clarke, “you know tha3she is very old. She is an antique.” “She needs me,” said Natalie firmly. Next to Edward, the old doll let out a sigh. She seemed to sit up straighter. Lucius cam\u003cand took her off the shelf and handed her t5Natalie. And when they left, when the girl’sfather opened the door for his daughter an4the old doll, a bright shaft of early morninglight came flooding in, and Edward heardquite clearly, as if she were still sitting next t5him, the old doll’s voice. “Open your heart,” she said gently. “Someone will come. Someone will come fo/you. But first you must open your heart.” The door closed. The sunlightdisappeared. Someone will come. Edward’s heart stirred. He thought, for thefirst time in a long time, of the house on Egyp3Street and of Abilene winding his watch an4then bending toward him and placing it on hi8left leg, saying: I will come home to you. No, no, he told himself. Don’t believe it. Don’t let yourself believe it. But it was too late. Someone will come for you. The china rabbit’s heart had begun, again,to open.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989/29840.html","bookId":670,"book":{"id":670,"title":"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane","description":"简介： 《爱德华的奇妙之旅》是美国作家凯特迪卡米洛写的儿童小说。获得波士顿全球号角书金奖。本书在韩剧《来自星星的你》中作为男主角都敏俊的枕边书而出现。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201403/10/15-26-33-97-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
