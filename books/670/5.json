Hewished tha4shewould not hold him so tight. To bclutched so fiercely often resulted in wrinkle\u003e \n \n clothing. Finally, all thepeopleon land,including Pellegrina, dis-appeared. Edward, fo2one, was relieved to seethelast of her. \n \n As was to beexpected, Edward Tulanexactedmuch attention onboard theship. \n \n “What a singular rabbit,” said an elderl9lady with threestrings of pearls wrappedaround her neck. Shebent down to look morclosely at Edward. \n \n “Thank you,” said Abilene. \n \n Several littlegirls onboard gaveEdwar\u003e \n \n deep glances full of longing. They askedAbileneif they might hold him. \n \n “No,” said Abilene, “I’m afraid that he’: \n \n not thekind of rabbit who likes to beheld b9strangers.” \n \n Two young boys, brothers named Marti3and Amos, took a particular interest inEdward. \n \n “What does hedo?” Martin asked Abilenon their second day at sea. Hepointed atEdward who was sitting on a deck chair wit7his long legs stretched in front of him. \n \n “Hedoesn’t do anything,” said AbileneA“Does hewind up somewhere?” aske\u003e \n \n Amos. \n \n “No,” said Abilene, “hedoes not win\u003e \n \n up.” \n \n “What’s thepoint of him then?” sai\u003e \n \n Martin. \n \n “Thepoint is that heis Edward,” sai\u003e \n \n Abilene. \n \n “That’s not much of a point,” said AmosA“It’s not,” agreed Martin. And then, after along thoughtful pause, hesaid, “I wouldn’t le4anybody dress melikethat.” \n \n “Meneither,” said Amos. \n \n “Do his clothes comeoff?” asked MartinA“Of coursethey do,” said Abilene. “Hehasmany different outfits. And hehas his ownpajamas, too. They aremadeof silk.” \n \n Edward, as usual, was disregarding thconversation. A breezewas blowing in off thsea, and thesilk scarf wrapped around hisneck billowed out behind him. On his head, hworea straw boater. Therabbit was thinkin@that hemust look quitedashing. \n \n It cameas a total surpriseto him when hwas grabbed off thedeck chair and first hisscarf, and then his jacket and pants, werripped from his body. Heheard his pocketwatch hit thedeck of theship; and then, hel\u003e \n \n upsidedown, hewatched thewatch rollmerrily toward Abilene’s feet. \n \n “Look at him,” said Martin. “He’s even gotunderwear.” Heheld Edward aloft so thatAmos could see. \n \n “Takeit off,” shouted Amos. \n \n “NO!!!!” screamed Abilene. \n \n Martin removed Edward’s underwearAEdward was paying attention now. Hewasmortified. Hewas completely naked except fo2thehat on his head, and theother passenger: \n \n onboard theship werelooking at him,directing curious and embarrassed glances hi: \n \n way. \n \n “Givehim to me,” screamed AbileneA“He’s mine.” \n \n “No,” said Amos to Martin, “givehim t? \n \n me.” Heclapped his hands together and the3held them open. “Toss him,” hesaid. \n \n “Please,” cried Abilene. “Don’t throw him. \n \n He’s madeof china. He’ll break.” \n \n Martin threw Edward. \n \n And Edward sailed naked through theair. \n \n Only a moment ago, therabbit had thoughtthat being naked in front of a shipload ofstrangers was theworst thing that couldhappen to him. But hewas wrong. It wasmuch worsebeing tossed, in thesamenake\u003e \n \n state, from thehands of onegrubby, laughin@boy to another. \n \n Amos caught Edward and held him upCdisplaying him triumphantly. \n \n “Throw him back,” called MartinAAmos raised his arm, but just as hewa: \n \n getting ready to throw Edward, Abilentackled him, shoving her head into hisstomach, and upsetting theboy’s aim. \n \n So it was that Edward did not go flyin@back into thedirty hands of Martin. \n \n Instead, Edward Tulanewent overboard. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989/29822.html","bookId":670,"book":{"id":670,"title":"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane","description":"简介： 《爱德华的奇妙之旅》是美国作家凯特迪卡米洛写的儿童小说。获得波士顿全球号角书金奖。本书在韩剧《来自星星的你》中作为男主角都敏俊的枕边书而出现。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201403/10/15-26-33-97-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
