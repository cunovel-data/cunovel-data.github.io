Edwar\u003e possessed a small trunk, and Abilenepacked i4for him, ..lling it with his ..nest suits an\u003e several of his best hats and threepairs o1shoes, all so that hemight cut a ..ne..gurei3London. Beforesheplaced each out..t in thtrunk, shedisplayed it to him. “Do you likethis shirt with this suit?” shasked him. Or, “Would you liketo wear your blacBderby? You look very handsomein it. Shall wpack it?” And then, finally, on a bright Saturda9morning in May, Edward and Abileneand MrAand Mrs. Tulanewereall onboard theship,standing at therailing. Pellegrina was at thdock. On her head, sheworea floppy hatstrung around with flowers. Shestared straigh4at Edward. Her dark eyes glowed. “Goodbye,” Abileneshouted to he2grandmother. “I loveyou.” Theship pulled away from thedockAPellegrina waved to Abilene. “Goodbye, lady,” shecalled, “goodbye.QEdward felt something damp in his earsAAbilene’s tears, hesupposed. Hewished tha4shewould not hold him so tight. To bclutched so fiercely often resulted in wrinkle\u003e clothing. Finally, all thepeopleon land,including Pellegrina, dis-appeared. Edward, fo2one, was relieved to seethelast of her. As was to beexpected, Edward Tulanexactedmuch attention onboard theship. “What a singular rabbit,” said an elderl9lady with threestrings of pearls wrappedaround her neck. Shebent down to look morclosely at Edward. “Thank you,” said Abilene. Several littlegirls onboard gaveEdwar\u003e deep glances full of longing. They askedAbileneif they might hold him. “No,” said Abilene, “I’m afraid that he’: not thekind of rabbit who likes to beheld b9strangers.” Two young boys, brothers named Marti3and Amos, took a particular interest inEdward. “What does hedo?” Martin asked Abilenon their second day at sea. Hepointed atEdward who was sitting on a deck chair wit7his long legs stretched in front of him. “Hedoesn’t do anything,” said AbileneA“Does hewind up somewhere?” aske\u003e Amos. “No,” said Abilene, “hedoes not win\u003e up.” “What’s thepoint of him then?” sai\u003e Martin. “Thepoint is that heis Edward,” sai\u003e Abilene. “That’s not much of a point,” said AmosA“It’s not,” agreed Martin. And then, after along thoughtful pause, hesaid, “I wouldn’t le4anybody dress melikethat.” “Meneither,” said Amos. “Do his clothes comeoff?” asked MartinA“Of coursethey do,” said Abilene. “Hehasmany different outfits. And hehas his ownpajamas, too. They aremadeof silk.” Edward, as usual, was disregarding thconversation. A breezewas blowing in off thsea, and thesilk scarf wrapped around hisneck billowed out behind him. On his head, hworea straw boater. Therabbit was thinkin@that hemust look quitedashing. It cameas a total surpriseto him when hwas grabbed off thedeck chair and first hisscarf, and then his jacket and pants, werripped from his body. Heheard his pocketwatch hit thedeck of theship; and then, hel\u003e upsidedown, hewatched thewatch rollmerrily toward Abilene’s feet. “Look at him,” said Martin. “He’s even gotunderwear.” Heheld Edward aloft so thatAmos could see. “Takeit off,” shouted Amos. “NO!!!!” screamed Abilene. Martin removed Edward’s underwearAEdward was paying attention now. Hewasmortified. Hewas completely naked except fo2thehat on his head, and theother passenger: onboard theship werelooking at him,directing curious and embarrassed glances hi: way. “Givehim to me,” screamed AbileneA“He’s mine.” “No,” said Amos to Martin, “givehim t? me.” Heclapped his hands together and the3held them open. “Toss him,” hesaid. “Please,” cried Abilene. “Don’t throw him. He’s madeof china. He’ll break.” Martin threw Edward. And Edward sailed naked through theair. Only a moment ago, therabbit had thoughtthat being naked in front of a shipload ofstrangers was theworst thing that couldhappen to him. But hewas wrong. It wasmuch worsebeing tossed, in thesamenake\u003e state, from thehands of onegrubby, laughin@boy to another. Amos caught Edward and held him upCdisplaying him triumphantly. “Throw him back,” called MartinAAmos raised his arm, but just as hewa: getting ready to throw Edward, Abilentackled him, shoving her head into hisstomach, and upsetting theboy’s aim. So it was that Edward did not go flyin@back into thedirty hands of Martin. Instead, Edward Tulanewent overboard.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989/29822.html","bookId":670,"book":{"id":670,"title":"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane","description":"简介： 《爱德华的奇妙之旅》是美国作家凯特迪卡米洛写的儿童小说。获得波士顿全球号角书金奖。本书在韩剧《来自星星的你》中作为男主角都敏俊的枕边书而出现。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201403/10/15-26-33-97-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
