{"id":95922,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"Kimball had articles printed off the Internet that he was now leafing through and wanting to share with me, as I sat disconsolately in my office, staring out the window at the lawn sloping toward the street and the detective’s car parked there. Two boys raced by, teetering on skateboards. A crow landed on the lawn and picked disinterestedly at an autumn leaf. It was followed by another larger crow. The lawn instantly reminded me of the carpet in the living room.\\n\\n Kimball could tell I was trying to distract myself, that I was trying to wish it all away, and gently said, “Mr. Ellis, you do understand where I’m going—”\\n\\n “Am I a suspect?” I asked suddenly.\\n\\n Kimball seemed surprised. “No, you’re not.”\\n\\n There was a tiny moment of relief that fled in an instant.\\n\\n “How do you know I’m not?”\\n\\n “The night of June first you were in a rehab clinic. And on the night Sandy Wu was murdered you were giving a lecture at the college on . . .” Kimball glanced at his notes—“on the legacy of the Brat Pack in American literature.”\\n\\n I swallowed hard and collected myself again. “So this is obviously not a series of coincidences.”\\n\\n “We—that is, myself and the Midland Sheriff’s Office—believe that whoever’s committing these crimes is actually following the book and replicating them.”\\n\\n “Let me get this straight.” I swallowed again. “You’re telling me that Patrick Bateman is alive and well and killing people in Midland County?”\\n\\n “No, someone out there is copycatting the murders from the book. And in order. It’s not random. It’s actually fairly careful and very well planned, to the point where the assailant has even gone so far as to locate people—victims—with similar names or similar, if not exact, occupations.”\\n\\n I was freezing. Nausea started sliding through me.\\n\\n “You have got to be kidding me. This is a joke, right?”\\n\\n “It’s no longer a theory, Mr. Ellis” was all Kimball would say, as if he was warning someone.\\n\\n “Do you have any leads?”\\n\\n Again, Kimball sighed. “The big obstacle in terms of our investigation is that the crime scenes themselves—even with the fairly formidable amount of planning and time the killer spent at each one—are, well, they’re”—and now he shrugged—“immaculate.”\\n\\n “What does that mean? What does that mean when you say ‘immaculate’?”\\n\\n “Well, basically forensics is baffled.” Kimball checked his notes, though I knew he didn’t need to. “No fingerprints, no hair, no fibers, nothing.”\\n\\n Like a ghost. That was the first thing I thought. Like a ghost.\\n\\n Kimball repositioned himself on the couch, and then looking at me directly asked, “Have you received any strange mail lately? Any kind of correspondence from a fan that would lead you to suspect that maybe something isn’t quite right?”\\n\\n “Wait—why? You think this person might contact me? Do you think he’s after me?” I was unable to contain my panic and immediately felt ashamed.\\n\\n “No, no. Please, Mr. Ellis, calm down. That doesn’t seem to be where this person is heading,” Kimball said, failing to reassure me. “However, if you feel someone has contacted you in a way that’s inappropriate or a violation of some kind, please tell me now.”\\n\\n “You’re fairly sure whoever this is is not heading toward me?”\\n\\n “That’s correct.”\\n\\n “Well, I mean, then who is he heading for . . . next?”\\n\\n Kimball looked at his notebook, even though again I was positive he didn’t need to. It was a calculated and empty gesture and I resented him for it.\\n\\n “The next victim in the book is Paul Owen.”\\n\\n “And?”\\n\\n Kimball paused. “There’s a Paul Owen in Clear Lake.”\\n\\n “Clear Lake is only fifteen miles from here,” I murmured.\\n\\n “Mr. Owen is now under heavy surveillance and police protection. And what we’re hoping is that if anyone suspicious shows up, we’ll be able to apprehend him.” Pause. “This is also why these connections between the crimes haven’t been leaked to the press. At this point that would only compromise the investigation . . . And of course we hope you won’t say anything either.”\\n\\n “Why do you think this person isn’t gonna come after me or my family?” I asked again. By now I was rocking back and forth in the swivel chair.\\n\\n “Well, the author of the book isn’t in the book,” Kimball said, offering a pointlessly reassuring smile that failed utterly. “I mean, Bret Ellis is not a character in the book, and so far the assailant is only interested in finding people with similar identities or names of fictional characters.” Pause. “You’re not a fictional character, are you, Mr. Ellis?” Kimball knew this smile hadn’t reassured me and he did not attempt it again. “Look, I can see why you’re becoming so upset, but we really feel that at this point you’re not in any danger. Still, if you’d rest easier we could offer you police protection that would be extremely unobtrusive. If you want to talk this over with Ms. Dennis—” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-56.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
