And she responded even more urgently this time. We were suddenly interrupted by my ringing cell phone. I ignored it. We kept kissing but I already felt the pangs of disappointment—there was no chance anything more was going to happen in this bathroom tonight—and the phone kept vibrating in my back pocket until I had to answer it. Aimee finally pushed me away. “Okay—that’s enough.” “For now,” I said in my sexiest voice, though it came out sounding merely ominous. My arm still around her, I held the phone to my ear with my free hand. “Yo?” I said, checking the incoming number. “It’s me.” It was Jay but I could barely hear him. “Where are you?” I whined. “Jesus, Jay, you are one lost bastard.” “What do you mean, where am I?” he asked. “You sound like you’re at some kind of party.” I paused. “Don’t tell me that many people showed up at your goddamn reading.” “Well, open the door and you’ll see where I am” was his reply. “Open which door?” “The one you’re behind, moron.” “Oh.” I turned to Aimee. “It’s the Jayster.” “Why don’t you just let me out first,” Aimee suggested, hurrying toward the mirror to make sure everything was in place. But I opened the door, high and not caring, and Jay stood there, his hair fashionably tousled, wearing black slacks and an orange Helmut Lang button-down. “Ah, I thought I’d find you in a bathroom.” And then Jay turned his gaze on Aimee and said, after looking her over appreciatively, “It’s where he can usually be located.” “I have a weak bladder.” I shrugged and bent down to retrieve my sombrero. “And you also have”—Jay reached over and touched my nose as I stood up—“what I am and am not hoping is baby powder above your upper lip.” I leaned toward the bathroom mirror and wiped off the residue of coke, then placed the straw hat back onto my head at what I thought was a raffish angle. “So creative yet so destructive, I know, I know,” Jay said, causing Aimee to crack up. “Jay McInerney, Aimee Light.” I leaned closer to the mirror and checked my nose again. “I’m a big fan—” Aimee started. “Hey, watch it.” I scowled. “Aimee’s a student at the college and she’s doing her thesis on me.” “So that explains . . . this?” Jay said, gesturing at the scene in the bathroom. Aimee looked away nervously and said, “Nice to meet you, but I’ve gotta go.” “Want a bump?” I asked Jay, blocking Aimee’s exit. “Look, I’ve really gotta go,” Aimee said more insistently and squeezed past me, and then I took one last look in the mirror and followed, closing the bathroom door behind us. The three of us, outside in the hall, were suddenly approached by a very tall and sexy cat holding a tray of nachos. I slung the guitar back across my chest, almost hitting her with the neck but she ducked in time. Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition” was now pumping through the house. “Meow,” Jay said, and took a chip dripping with cheese. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” Aimee muttered. I nodded, watching as she moved back to where her friend was still chatting up the werewolf. “Hey,” I called out. “Enjoy the rest of your evening.” And I continued to stare until it became apparent she was not going to look back. Knocking me out of my reverie, Jay gestured at the cat with the nachos. “I take it the thought of food is the furthest thing from your mind?” “Want a bump?” I whispered into his ear involuntarily. “Even though you’re sounding like a parrot, there is really no other reason to be here.” He looked around the darkened living room as a man dressed as Anna Nicole Smith pushed past us to use the bathroom. “But is there someplace more private?” “Follow me,” I said, and when I noticed him taking another nacho I snapped, “And stop flirting with the help.” But we were trapped. Jay and I were huddled on the periphery of the party, and I was strategizing how to get to my office without Jayne seeing us; back inside, she was introducing David Duchovny to the Allens, our neighbors and truly tiresome bores, and my plans had become increasingly urgent since I desperately needed another line—the garage, I suddenly realized, the garage—when I felt someone tugging at my guitar. I looked down: it was Sarah. “Daddy?” she said, her face a frown of concern. She was wearing a little T-shirt with the word BABE on it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-18.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
