I’m going to hang up.”\n “Though of course I could make things happen.” The voice lowered itself, yet became clearer. “I could get you involved.”\n Wounds kept opening.\n “What do you mean? How could you do that?”\n “Well, you were a mentor to her. She was the young and obliging student. Quite attractive, by the way.” The voice paused, and considered something. “Maybe Aimee Light wanted more from the big famous teacher she was doing her dissertation on.” The voice paused again. “Maybe you let her down in some way. Maybe there are even e-mails to back this up. Maybe Aimee Light left behind a trail that included a note or two. And let’s just say these notes hinted at the possibility she was expecting you to fulfill a promise. Let’s just say that maybe there was the possibility she was going to tell your very famous wife—”\n “Who in the f**k is this?”\n “—about the two of you.” The voice sighed, then spoke quickly. “Though when I asked about your ‘affair’ it seemed like she was saying that nothing had happened between the two of you. Of course I had taped her mouth shut and by that point she was losing so much blood, but it was pretty clear that the two of you had never f**ked. Maybe you were angry at Aimee Light for not putting out. That’s another scenario we could pursue. The rejection was just too much for the writer who always got what he wanted and you snapped.” The voice paused. “I see you haven’t informed the authorities about your relationship with the deceased.”\n “Because I’m not connected to anything crimin—”\n “Oh, but you are.”\n “How?” This was sending me out so much further than I had ever expected: a place beyond strength.\n “You were seen outside her house by three witnesses the night her dismembered body was discovered in that very messy room at the Orsic Motel. Now, what were you doing there, Bret?”\n “I have an alibi for—”\n “Actually, you don’t.”\n “There’s no way—”\n “You mean the night you wandered around ‘your’ house making some realizations about the past? Everyone was asleep. You were all alone. No one saw you after you got back from Buckley until the next morning when Marta saw you racing to your office because of those attachments. That gives you a lot of time, Bret. By the way, did you like the video? It took you an awfully long time to find it. I’ve been wanting to show it to you for years.”\n I leapt back to Aimee. “They don’t even know that body is hers.”\n “I could send them the head. I still have it.”\n “This is a joke. You’re not even real. You don’t exist.”\n “If you think so, then why are you still on the line?”\n I had nothing to say except “What do you want?”\n “I want you to realize some things about yourself. I want you to reflect on your life. I want you to be aware of all the terrible things you have done. I want you to face the disaster that is Bret Easton Ellis.”\n “You’re murdering people and you’re telling me—”\n “How can I murder people if I’m not real, Bret?” The voice was grinning. It was presenting a mystery. “Again, you are lost,” the voice sighed. “Again, Bret doesn’t get it.”\n “If you ever come near my family I’ll kill you.”\n “I’m not particularly interested in your family. Besides, I don’t think you’ve figured out a way to get rid of me, not yet.”\n “If you’re not real, how am I going to accomplish that?”\n “Did you read the manuscript?” the voice asked again.\n I was on the verge of tears. I shoved a fist into my mouth and I was biting on it.\n “Let’s play a game, Bret.”\n “I’m not—”\n “The game is called ‘Guess Who’s Next?’ ”\n “You’re not alive.”\n And then, suddenly and very sweetly, the voice began humming a song I recognized—“The Sunny Side of the Street”—before a roar overtook the humming and the line clicked dead.\n When I laid the phone back on the desk I noticed a bottle of vodka that had not been there when I walked into the room. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-102.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \n \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
