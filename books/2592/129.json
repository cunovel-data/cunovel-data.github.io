Fresh blood burst from its snout. I smashed my hand again into its face.\\n\\n The face kept spouting blood, and the dog continued shrieking.\\n\\n I started screaming back at the dog.\\n\\n I was sliding in place as I looked up to see how far I had to go before reaching the landing.\\n\\n It was about eight steps.\\n\\n I started pulling myself upward, dragging my mangled leg behind me.\\n\\n And then I felt the thing leap on my back when it realized where I was going.\\n\\n I whirled over, knocking the thing off me.\\n\\n I thrashed around in all the blood, trying to kick it away.\\n\\n I vomited helplessly onto my chest, and then whispered, “I hear you I hear you I hear you.”\\n\\n But this promise did not work any longer.\\n\\n The dog gathered strength and reared up like a horse on its hind legs, looming over me, its wings obscenely outstretched, flapping them, spraying us with more blood.\\n\\n At that moment I lifted my left leg up and, without thinking, kicked it hard in the chest.\\n\\n It toppled back, trying to beat its wings to keep in place, but they were still too heavy with blood and flesh and it fell backwards, sliding to the bottom of the staircase and landing on the floor, shrieking, while trying to scramble upright with insectile urgency.\\n\\n On the landing, I began crawling madly toward Robby’s room at the top of the stairs.\\n\\n Below me, the thing righted itself and started scrambling up the staircase after me, snapping the horribly uneven rows of fangs that now made up its mouth as it neared.\\n\\n I lunged forward and slid into Robby’s room, slamming the door shut and locking it with a hand soaked in blood. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-129.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
