It was a greenhouse, and the smell of the Pacific slowly traced itself in the muggy air.\\n\\n . . . scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind . . .\\n\\n Suddenly, from upstairs: “There’s something here,” Sam called. “It just materialized.” Pause. “Bob, did you hear me?”\\n\\n . . . smiles we gave to one another . . .\\n\\n “What is it?” Miller called up.\\n\\n Sam’s voice, less enthusiastic: “It’s, um . . . it’s a human form . . . skeletal . . . it just exited the little girl’s room . . .”\\n\\n Actually, the writer informed me, Sam was wrong. It came from Robby’s room, since Robby is, in fact, the focal point of the haunting.\\n\\n Not you, Bret.\\n\\n Did you grasp that yet?\\n\\n Not everything’s about you, even though you would like to think so.\\n\\n From Dale: “I see it too, Bob.”\\n\\n “What’s its location now?” Miller called up.\\n\\n . . . the way we were . . .\\n\\n “It’s moving toward the staircase . . . it’s gonna head downstairs . . .”\\n\\n Their excited cries were suddenly replaced by what sounded like a choked awe.\\n\\n “Holy Christ,” one of them shouted. “What the f**k is it?”\\n\\n “Bob.” This was Sam, I think. “Bob, it’s coming down the stairs.”\\n\\n The song stopped midlyric.\\n\\n Miller and I were facing the grand staircase that flowed into the foyer and the adjacent living room.\\n\\n There were clicking noises.\\n\\n (I am not going to defend what I’m about to describe. I am not going to try to make you believe anything. You can choose to believe me, or you can turn away. The same goes for another incident that occurs later on.)\\n\\n The only reason I witnessed this was because it happened so quickly, and the only reason I did not immediately turn away was because it seemed fake, like something I had seen in a movie—a prank to scare the children. The living room might as well have been a screen and the house a theater.\\n\\n It was lurching down the staircase, pausing on various steps.\\n\\n It was tall and had a vaguely human form, and though it was skeletal it had eyes.\\n\\n Rapidly my father’s face was illuminated in the skull.\\n\\n And then another face replaced it.\\n\\n Clayton’s.\\n\\n I was stunned into rigidity.\\n\\n My panting could not be heard above the meters or the cameras.\\n\\n The skeleton-thing was now standing at the bottom of the staircase.\\n\\n It was making the clicking noises with its teeth.\\n\\n Within the skull were eyeballs.\\n\\n Suddenly, it launched itself toward us.\\n\\n Miller and I quickly backed away and when we did, the thing stopped.\\n\\n It began raising its arms, extending them upward.\\n\\n The arms were so long that finger bones scraped the ceiling.\\n\\n I was moaning.\\n\\n What were we waiting for? I didn’t understand what we were waiting for it to do.\\n\\n My father’s face flashed on again, followed by Clayton’s.\\n\\n As the faces rapidly interchanged, sharing the skull, the resemblance between the two men could not be questioned.\\n\\n It was the face of a father being replaced by the face of a son.\\n\\n It kept clicking its teeth, as if chewing something invisible.\\n\\n Its fingers started trailing across the ceiling as it moved toward us.\\n\\n When it started lowering its arms, both Miller and I noticed something.\\n\\n It was carrying a scalpel.\\n\\n As it lunged toward us I braced myself, my eyes locked open.\\n\\n “I hear you,” I whispered. “I hear you.”\\n\\n And then the lights in the house flickered for a moment.\\n\\n When the house was suddenly reborn with light the thing stopped and tilted its head before swirling into a cyclone of ash.\\n\\n Sam and Dale watched this from the top of the stairs.\\n\\n The moment the house burst into light they raced toward us.\\n\\n Miller was asking me, “Did you turn off the fuse box?”\\n\\n “Yes, yes.”\\n\\n Miller breathed in. “There are two spirits at work here—”\\n\\n At the moment Miller said this, the door to my office—visible from where we now stood—flew off its hinges with such force that it sailed across the room and dented a wall.\\n\\n (I did not see this because I was staring at the ash that had sprayed across the generator. The writer described it to me later on the plane.)\\n\\n The ceiling above us suddenly cracked open in a long, jagged strip, dusting our hair with plaster.\\n\\n (I don’t remember seeing this but the writer insisted I had. The writer said, You were gaping.)\\n\\n Paint began to peel and curl in waves off the walls. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-121.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
