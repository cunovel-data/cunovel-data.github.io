I forced myself not to be surprised, because it was only the narrative saving itself.\\n\\n I did not bother rereading the rest of the scene.\\n\\n I simply placed the book back on its shelf.\\n\\n I had to think about this.\\n\\n First thought: How did the person who said he was Donald Kimball ever see this original unread manuscript with the details of Amelia Light’s murder in it? A murder that was identical to the one that occurred on November third in the Orsic Motel.\\n\\n Second thought: Someone was impersonating a fictional character named Donald Kimball.\\n\\n He had been in my home.\\n\\n He had been in my office.\\n\\n I suddenly realized—hopefully—that everything he had told me was a lie.\\n\\n I suddenly hoped that there had been no murders.\\n\\n I hoped that the book I had written about my father was not responsible for the deaths “Donald Kimball” had relayed to me.\\n\\n (Will I find out later that this Donald Kimball’s private number was, in fact, Aimee Light’s cell phone number? Yes.)\\n\\n But then I thought: If Donald Kimball was responsible for the murders in Midland County, then who was Clayton?\\n\\n As I thought about this I glimpsed something by my shoe.\\n\\n There was a drawing from a children’s book I had made when I was a boy.\\n\\n One of a number of pages that had scattered to the floor as I rifled through my closet.\\n\\n These pages were from an illustrated book I had written when I was seven.\\n\\n The book had a title.\\n\\n The title was “The Toy Bret.”\\n\\n I slowly reached down to pick up the title page but stopped when I saw the tip of a black triangle.\\n\\n I pulled the other pages away until the entire sheet was revealed.\\n\\n And I was confronted with the wrecked stare of the Terby.\\n\\n As I moved the pages around, I saw the Terby replicated a hundred times throughout a book I had written thirty years ago.\\n\\n The Terby emerging from a coffin.\\n\\n The Terby taking a bath.\\n\\n The Terby nibbling the white petal of a bougainvillea flower.\\n\\n The Terby drinking a glass of milk.\\n\\n The Terby attacking a dog.\\n\\n The Terby entering the dog and making it fly.\\n\\n It was at this moment in L.A. on that Saturday night in November—when I saw the children’s book about the Terby and knew that a person named Donald Kimball did not exist—that I made a decision.\\n\\n If I had created Patrick Bateman I would now write a story in which he was uncreated and his world was erased.\\n\\n I would write a story in which he was killed.\\n\\n I left the house on Valley Vista.\\n\\n Driving back to Bel Air, I began formulating a story.\\n\\n I began making notes.\\n\\n I needed to write the story hurriedly.\\n\\n It would be short and Patrick Bateman would be killed.\\n\\n The point of the story: Patrick Bateman was now dead.\\n\\n I would never find explanations.\\n\\n (That’s because explanations are boring, the writer whispered as I drove through a canyon.)\\n\\n Everything would remain disguised and remote.\\n\\n I would struggle to piece things together, and the writer would ultimately deride me for attempting this task.\\n\\n There were too many questions.\\n\\n This would always happen. The further you go, the more there are.\\n\\n And every answer is a threat, a new abyss that only sleep can close.\\n\\n No one would ever say, I will show you what happened and I will make everything perfect by taking you to the vacant places where you won’t need to think of this anymore.\\n\\n Back at the hotel in Bel Air I slipped Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round into the DVD player, simply because it was the first credit on Harrison Ford’s résumé and I wanted background noise. It would wash out the distracting silence.\\n\\n I sat down at the desk and opened my laptop and began writing as the movie played.\\n\\n Formlessness quickly led to shape.\\n\\n “Patrick Bateman stands on a burning pier . . .”\\n\\n I sat motionless during the half hour it took to write the story.\\n\\n The story was static and artificial and precise.\\n\\n It wasn’t a dream—which is what a novel should be.\\n\\n But that was not the purpose of this story.\\n\\n The purpose of the story was to let myself be carried into the past, advancing backwards and rearranging something.\\n\\n The story was a denial.\\n\\n Soon Patrick Bateman’s voice was resonating faintly, whispering and scattered, until he flickered away and was void. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-125.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
