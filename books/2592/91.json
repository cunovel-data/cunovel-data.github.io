Ordering a cocktail had been so natural an act that I hadn’t even thought about it. It had been involuntary. “I’m sorry . . .” “Why are you having a drink?” she asked. “It’ll be my reward vodka?” “How did I know you’d say something shitty like that?” But there was no rancor in her voice, and we were still holding hands in the dimness of the restaurant. “Do you really want to be here this week?” Jayne asked. It was as if the intensity of the heartfelt plea—on my knees, with my head bowed—in Dr. Faheida’s office had vanished from memory. But then I thought, During that impassioned speech, were you thinking only of yourself? “What do you mean? Where else would I want to be?” “Well, I thought maybe you’d want to take a week off.” She shrugged. “Marta will be there. And Rosa.” “Jayne—” “Or you could come to Toronto with me.” “Hey,” I said, leaning forward. “You know that would definitely not work out.” “You’re right, you’re right.” She shook her head. “That was a dumb idea.” “It wasn’t a dumb idea.” “I just thought maybe you’d like to go someplace. Have a vacation.” “I’ve got nowhere else to go.” I was doing my Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman impersonation. “I’ve got nowhere else to go . . .” She laughed lightly, and it didn’t seem faked, and we squeezed hands again. Then I decided to tell her. “Well, I’m up for this Harrison Ford thing and they might want to meet this week.” I paused. “In L.A.” “I think that’s great,” Jayne said. Though I wasn’t surprised by her enthusiasm, I said, “Really?” “Yeah. You should definitely think about it.” “It would only be for a day or two,” I said. “Good. I hope you do it.” Suddenly I asked, “Why do you stay with me?” “Because . . .” She sighed. “Because . . . I get you, I guess.” “Yet all I do is disappoint you,” I muttered guiltily. “All I do is disappoint everybody.” “You have potential.” She stopped. The unspecific comment was transformed into something else by her tenderness. “There was a time when you made me laugh and you were . . . kind . . .” She paused again. “And I believe that will happen again.” She lowered her head and didn’t look up for a long time. “You’re acting like this is the end of the world,” I said softly. The waiter came with our drinks. He pretended to recognize Jayne only now and grinned widely at her. She acknowledged this and offered a sad smile. He warned us that the kitchen would be closing soon, but this didn’t really register. I noticed people slipping away from the bar. There was a whirlpool in the center of the dining room. After Jayne sipped her wine she let go of my hand and asked, “Why didn’t we work on this more?” Pause. “I mean in the beginning . . .” Another pause. “Before we broke up.” “I don’t know.” It was the only answer I could come up with. “We were too young?” I guessed. “Could that have been it?” “You never trusted my feelings,” she murmured to herself. “I don’t think you ever really believed I liked you.” “That’s not true at all,” I said. “I did. I did know that. I just . . . wasn’t ready.” “And you are now? After one particularly volatile session?” “On the volatility scale I would say that was only about a seven.” And then after we both tried to smile, I said, “Maybe you never really understood me.” I said this in the same soft voice I had been using since we entered the restaurant. “You say that you did. But maybe you didn’t. Not really.” I thought about this. “Maybe not enough to resolve anything? But that was probably my fault. I was just this . . . hidden person and—” “Who made it so impossible to resolve anything.” She finished the sentence. “I want to now. I want to make things work out . . . and . . .” My foot found hers beneath the table. And then I had a flash: Jayne standing alone over a grave in a charred field at dusk, and this image forced me to admit, “You’re right about something.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-91.html","bookId":2592,"book":{"id":2592,"title":"Lunar Park","description":"Storyline: \u0027Lunar Park\u0027 confounds one expectation after another, passing through comedy and mounting psychological and supernatural horror toward an astonishing resolution - about love and loss, fathers and sons - in what is surely the most powerfully original and moving novel of an extraordinary career.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lunar-park.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:16 PM"}}
