{"id":82934,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Sandro had made good on his promise and had enlisted both Lisa and Phumsile\u0027s aid in ensuring that she took her vitamins and rested enough... but that was the only promise he kept. A month passed with barely any word from him, his phonecalls, the few that came, were rushed and impersonal and barely lasted three minutes each time. When Theresa tried to contact him, he was never available, or so the cold female voices on the other end of the line told her. She had no choice but to take them at their word.\\n\\n She kept track of Sandro\u0027s movements through the news; online, televised and printed, his father\u0027s death and Sandro\u0027s subsequent taking over of an empire were pretty hot news items and barely a day went by that it wasn\u0027t mentioned in some form of news. There had been paparazzi coverage of the funeral, despite the media ban the family had put on proceedings, some intrepid photographer had managed to get a picture of Sandro standing over his father\u0027s open grave, his face closed up tighter than a fist, flanked by his mother and by Francesca who had stood with her hand woven through his arm, offering the support of a lover, the support a wife would offer. A lot had been written about that photograph, a lot of cynical criticism had been aimed at his cold, absent wife and a lot of praise for the stoic Francesca who stood by him through thick and thin.\\n\\n No word about her difficult pregnancy which made travel nearly impossible for her. A few local reporters had contacted her, wanting her \"side of the story\" and her refusal to be interviewed or offer any comment had merely added fuel to the fodder that she was unfeeling and cold. The media, when given free rein, were ruthless. For the most part they left her alone, content to write what they wanted and in every article the beautiful, vivacious Francesca was lauded for her unwavering and loving support, while the \"plain and anti-social\" Theresa was criticised for her seeming neglect of her husband in his time of need.\\n\\n She sighed quietly, as she stared out at the heavy downpour, missing Sandro so much it hurt and wishing that she could just talk with him. The baby moved restlessly and she winced slightly as a tiny foot caught her just beneath the ribs. She sang a quiet lullaby and ran her hands over the mound of her stomach. She was feeling her burden more and more with each passing day and it was getting increasingly difficult just to make it through the day.\\n\\n \"Theresa?\" The quiet voice coming from behind her made her jump nearly out of her skin and she yelped before turning to face Lisa and Rick both of whom stood framed in the doorway of the den.\\n\\n \"God, you startled me,\" she gasped as they stepped into the room, neither cracking a smile, both looking relentlessly grim. \"What\u0027s wrong? Has something happened?\"\\n\\n . \"Terri... we have to get you out of here,\" Lisa said urgently, rounding the sofa to stand in front of her.\\n\\n \"What? Why?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll explain once we\u0027re out of here...\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she shook her head stubbornly. \"Tell me now. Is it Sandro? Was he hurt?\"\\n\\n \"He will be once I get done with him,\" Rick suddenly threatened furiously.\\n\\n \"Rick, not now,\" Lisa groaned and Theresa\u0027s eyes settled on the grim-faced man in confusion.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand...\" her confused gaze went from Lisa\u0027s frantic expression to Rick\u0027s furious one. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"A story just broke in the European newspapers...\"\\n\\n \"What story?\" She asked in bewilderment and Rick swore softly.\\n\\n \"Sweetheart we can discuss it later, for now we have to leave before the vultures descend.\"\\n\\n \"No, Rick,\" she maintained stubbornly. \"I\u0027m not leaving my home without good reason.\" Rick\u0027s jaw clenched and his expression clearly gave away his frustration with her.\\n\\n \"Terri they\u0027re saying that Sandro was blackmailed into marrying you. That he did so for his father. They\u0027re also saying that a source close to the family claims that since Sandro has no reason to be with you anymore he\u0027ll be filing for a divorce as soon as he gets back.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought of that,\" Theresa half-whispered to herself. \"Of course he\u0027s free now. That\u0027s probably why I never heard from him, he\u0027s been busy planning this... I should have realised that he would want that. I should have seen this coming.\"\\n\\n \"Theresa, don\u0027t you dare beat yourself up about it. If the divorce rumours are true then he\u0027s a bastard for abandoning his pregnant wife when she needs him most,\" Rick fumed.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m happy for him. He was trapped...\" she was so dazed, she barely realised what she was saying and Rick swore in disbelief.\\n\\n \"My God, it\u0027s like you have battered wife syndrome. Stop making excuses for him, he\u0027s an ass who hurt you time and again.\" When it looked like she was about to protest, Lisa stepped forward.\\n\\n \"Come on, darling, let\u0027s get you packed up and out of here,\" her cousin took charge, grabbing hold of Theresa\u0027s arm and jerking her out of her stupor. Lisa steered her out of the room, tossing a warning look over her shoulder when it looked like Rick wanted to say something more.\\n\\n After getting settled at Rick and Lisa\u0027s, Theresa decided to give the couple, who were walking on eggshells around her, a break from her presence by taking a nap. She was just slipping into a troubled doze when she heard the unmistakable voice of her husband coming from a distance. She frowned and sat upright, pushing her tangled hair out of her face. She tilted her head, not sure if her imagination was playing tricks on her, until she heard it again. It was Sandro, without a doubt, and he sounded agitated.\\n\\n She got out of bed with some difficulty before padding to the door on bare feet and opening it slightly. This time she could clearly make out his voice.\\n\\n \"I had nothing to do with that story,\" he was protesting. \"And I\u0027ll be damned if you keep me away from my family like this.\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t want to see you, Sandro,\" Rick informed with obvious relish and there was a moment\u0027s charged silence.\\n\\n \"Maybe not,\" Sandro finally conceded quietly. \"But that\u0027s because she doesn\u0027t know everything. I just need to explain things to her. I need to talk with her...\"\\n\\n \"Explain what? How you\u0027ve been cheating on her with that woman since nearly the day of your wedding? How you\u0027ve spent every available moment with her since you returned to Italy for the funeral, while your heavily pregnant wife waited in vain for you to call her every day?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t cheated on her,\" Sandro growled after a moment\u0027s silence. \"Not in deed and not in thought. Not once. She knows that.\"\\n\\n \"All she knows is that her husband left nearly two weeks ago, supposedly to attend his father\u0027s funeral but then hooked up with his mistress and started divorce proceedings once he realised that nothing was tying him to his wife anymore.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a hell of a lot tying me to my wife, Palmer,\" Sandro gritted. \"Our baby for one.\"\\n\\n \"Oh please, we know how little you actually want that baby, De Lucci.\"\\n\\n \"I want him,\" Sandro said quietly, so quietly she nearly missed it. \"I want them both...\"\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" Theresa could stand it no more, she waddled into the living room where Rick and Lisa stood on one side of the room and Sandro on the other. The atmosphere was so charged that Theresa was sure her hair was standing on end. Sandro\u0027s face tightened at the sight of her.\\n\\n \"Theresa,\" he whispered. \"This was not meant for you to hear.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" she shrugged listlessly. \"I\u0027m tired... I\u0027m so tired of all this, Sandro.\"\\n\\n \"I know, cara but it will get better. I promise you that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how it can...\" she shook her head bitterly and he groaned, closing the distance between them in four strides, before gathering her into his arms and hugging her tenderly.\\n\\n \"It can. It will. I didn\u0027t file for a divorce, Theresa. I have no reason to divorce you...\"\\n\\n \"Sandro please just... shut up!\" She interrupted furiously, pushing him away forcefully and his face went ruddy but his mouth slammed shut. \"If you won\u0027t divorce me then I\u0027ll be the one divorcing you. I don\u0027t want a husband who feels obligated to be with me. You have no reason to stay with me anymore. I can take care of myself and I can take care of this baby. I don\u0027t need you or your guilt anymore. You\u0027re free to leave. In fact, I want you to go.\" He said nothing, merely stared down at her, with one hand squeezing the nape of his neck. His face was inscrutable, his eyes dark with an emotion that she could not read. He looked stunned, incapable of movement and Theresa realised that he needed a harder push.\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake, go back to the woman you love! Go back to Francesca.\" She turned away from him, dismissing him contemptuously but froze when he swore shakily.\\n\\n \"God, you are the most contrary little bitch!\" He hissed. \"I don\u0027t love Francesca. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever loved her. Maybe when I married you, for about five seconds, I believed that I did. But I was disabused of that notion pretty damned early on in our marriage. I don\u0027t love her... and I have no idea why the hell you\u0027re so fixated on her.\" She turned on him furiously, ignoring Rick and Lisa who were watching the exchange in morbid fascination.\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027m fixated on her because every time you go to Italy, the papers and Internet are full of pictures of you two attending the same functions, touching, kissing, dancing or hugging! Don\u0027t you dare insult my intelligence by saying that it meant nothing. I believe you when you say that you\u0027ve never slept other women while we were married. But I\u0027m willing to bet you came pretty close with her. I mean, how the hell could she be the other woman? I was the other woman. Your entire family knew it, my father knew it... I know it.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re in the same social circle, Theresa. She was always at the same functions as I am. She\u0027s an old friend, naturally I hugged her or touched her occasion. Yes I danced with her, dropped a few casual kisses on her cheek or mouth... it meant nothing. I treated her as I would one of my sisters. I don\u0027t desire her, I don\u0027t love her and I don\u0027t want her! Those are feelings reserved for you... only for you,\" his voice deepened and his face softened at the admission, his eyes were gentle as he registered the confusion on her face. Was he saying he loved her? And if he was... did she believe him? She wasn\u0027t sure of the answer to either question and a second later she didn\u0027t really care when she suddenly doubled over in pain.\\n\\n Sandro, Rick and Lisa all surged forward in concern but her husband got to her first, he had an arm around her thickened waist before she could blink.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" He demanded hoarsely. Theresa grabbed his free hand in both of hers and squeezed it urgently as her entire body quivered in excruciating pain. After an eternal moment, the pain lessened and faded and she pushed her way upright, meeting Sandro\u0027s frantic gaze with a panicky one of her own.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the baby...\" she whispered in fear. \"I think the baby\u0027s coming...\"\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" the naked panic and fear in his eyes did nothing to alleviate Theresa\u0027s own terror. \"He can\u0027t be coming now. He\u0027s nearly a month early! Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been cramping all day but I thought it was due to stress,\" Theresa moaned after the pain had subsided. \"But now I think I\u0027m having contractions.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, it\u0027s okay,\" he soothed, automatically gathering her trembling body into a hug. \"We\u0027ll be fine. We have to get you to the hospital.\"\\n\\n Theresa had argued, begged, cajoled, attempted to reason but Sandro had refused point blank to defer his position as her coach to Lisa. In the end, Lisa had simply declined to go in to hospital with her, saying that it was best for Theresa to have her original coaching partner with her. Shocked and hurt by what she felt was an unforgivable betrayal, Theresa had refused to look, or even talk, to her cousin while Sandro shepherded her out to his car. Lisa had seemed to be cheerfully and deliberately oblivious to Theresa\u0027s pointed and rather childish, silent treatment, promising that she and Rick would be at the hospital soon.\\n\\n \"She did what she thought was best, cara,\" Sandro tried to placate en-route to the hospital. She simply turned her head and stared out at the passing scenery, scared and angry and not really in the mood to be comforted by him. \"She knew that I would have insisted and we\u0027d have just wasted time arguing futilely about it.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted somebody I trusted in there with me,\" she suddenly said, keeping her eyes glued on the road ahead. He didn\u0027t respond to that but from the corner of her eye she saw his hands tighten on the steering wheel and knew that she\u0027d scored a direct hit. The rest of the journey went by quickly and before she knew it she was being admitted into the elite private maternity clinic that Sandro had arranged for months ago. She\u0027d had only one contraction en-route but it had nearly sent Sandro off the road in a panic.\\n\\n Still it was hours before anything more interesting than that happened. The doctor confirmed that she was indeed in labour but reassured them that it was perfectly normal for women to go into labour a few weeks early. They were taking extra precautions because of her health issues during the pregnancy but for someone whose pregnancy had been fraught with drama, Theresa\u0027s labour was pretty boring aside from the intense periods of pain. Her obstetrician monitored her condition carefully and weathered Sandro\u0027s demanding, panicked questions with admirable calm. Her contractions seemed to leave Sandro more wrung out than they did her and he wasn\u0027t dealing with it very well.\\n\\n About five hours after her admission Theresa found herself glaring up at her hovering husband in frustration.\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake, go and get yourself some coffee or something, you\u0027re driving me up the wall!\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t leave you. What if you have another contraction? What if your water breaks and they rush you into the delivery room? What if there are complications?\" He asked hoarsely, his eyes dilating more with each anxious question. And Theresa rolled her eyes in exasperation.\\n\\n \"I doubt any of those things will happen in the two minutes it would take you to leave the room and get a cup of coffee, Sandro,\" she sighed impatiently.\\n\\n \"They could,\" he insisted stubbornly.\\n\\n \"Unlikely.\" He didn\u0027t respond, merely continued to sit by her bedside. They were both silent for a few minutes.\\n\\n \"Why are you here?\" Theresa suddenly asked tiredly.\\n\\n \"Because this is where I want to be,\" he responded promptly and she squeezed her eyes shut.\\n\\n \"Why do you want to be here?\" She persisted.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re my wife, cara. You\u0027re having my baby,\" he reached out and covered one of her hands with his. \"I belong here.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t belong here,\" she whispered hoarsely.\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"You have another life, a family that wants you to come home, a woman you love and who loves you. You don\u0027t have to be here, Sandro,\" she shook her head tiredly, tears seeping from beneath her eyelids.\\n\\n \"I have this life, with you. It\u0027s the only one that matters to me,\" he insisted. \"I have a wife who loved me once, and who maybe... someday, would dare to love and trust me again? I don\u0027t have to be here... but I want to be here.\"\\n\\n \"Too many things have happened between us. More than two years of pain,\" she whispered rawly and his hand contracted around hers. \"I can\u0027t go back to being the naive girl who loved you with all her heart.\"\\n\\n \"But maybe... the woman who replaced the girl could find a way to love the flawed man she\u0027d once placed on a pedestal he had no business being on?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve hurt me so many times,\" she confessed. Opening her eyes and meeting his gaze full on. He flinched slightly beneath the accusatory glare.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"In so many ways.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Why should I forgive you and love you again? Why should I open up my heart to a man who would probably crush it in the palms of his hands?\"\\n\\n \"You probably shouldn\u0027t,\" he smiled bitterly. \"But I wish you would.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t,\" she whispered, tears drenching her pale cheeks and he nodded slightly, reaching out to wipe at the tears.\\n\\n \"I know,\" he finally said again, before lapsing into silence.\\n\\n Her water finally broke four hours later and she was moved to the delivery room. She and Sandro hadn\u0027t exchanged any further meaningful conversation, he\u0027d just continued to soothe her and coach her through the ever-increasing pain. She didn\u0027t ever say it but she was pretty grateful to have him there. Even though he was as nervous and edgy as a cat in a barrel between contractions, he was a solid rock during them.\\n\\n Four intensely nerve-wracking, sweaty and pain-riddled hours later, during which time Sandro supported her, swore at her doctors, threatened the nurses and seemed to come close to breaking down into tears on several occasions, Theresa finally gave one last painful push. There was a rush of activity at the foot of the bed as Theresa felt an overwhelming flood of relief. Sandro\u0027s eyes remained glued to her face, bright and feverish above the surgical mask they had forced him to wear. He dragged down the mask and leaned down toward her, until his mouth was so close to her ear she could feel his hot and moist breath fanning over her overheated skin.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re amazing, cara mia. So incredible...\" she jerked her head away from his mouth and turned her face to stare at him in bewilderment, rocked by the emotion she heard in his voice. But his attention was now on the doctor and the squalling, naked and tiny bundle the man held cradled in his gentle and capable hands.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the little lady who\u0027s been causing all that fuss and bother,\" the man was saying jovially. \"Congratulations Mr and Mrs De Lucci you have a beautiful and perfectly healthy baby girl.\"\\n\\n Theresa\u0027s breath hitched in her chest at the man\u0027s words and her eyes remained glued to Sandro\u0027s face. But instead of the rapidly concealed disappointment she would have expected to see, she witnessed something she would never have believed if she hadn\u0027t seen it with her own eyes... she watched her husband fall hopelessly and helplessly head over heels in love with the outraged bundle of femininity the doctor placed onto Theresa\u0027s chest.\\n\\n Theresa was overwhelmed as she stared down at the tiny, wailing infant her chest and not entirely sure what to do with this baby girl who should have been a boy.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s beautiful,\" the smitten Sandro crooned, dropping a large hand to the baby\u0027s tiny head and stroking the soft skin and tufts of still-wet hair, gently. \"She\u0027s so very beautiful, Theresa.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she muttered automatically. \"I suppose she is.\" He frowned down at her, puzzled by her response or lack thereof.\\n\\n \"Theresa... what\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Your wife is exhausted Mr De Lucci,\" the doctor said brusquely. \"Give her time to recover and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be fawning all over this little beauty in no time at all.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I\u0027m tired,\" Theresa said remotely and Sandro\u0027s brow furrowed. He watched as Theresa absently stroked the baby\u0027s down-soft back, without once looking down at the infant and knew that something was terribly wrong. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unwanted-wife-unwanted-1/page-10.html","bookId":1874,"book":{"id":1874,"title":"The Unwanted Wife (Unwanted #1)","description":"Storyline: The Unwanted Wife (Unwanted #1) \\n All Alessandro de Lucci wants from his wife is a son but after a year and a half of unhappiness and disillusionment, all Theresa de Lucci wants from her ice cold husband is a divorce.
