And you\u0027ve been along with me,Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?\u0027 　　It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made theremark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. `If themwould only purr for \"yes\" and mew for \"no,\" or any rule of that sort,\u0027 shehad said, `so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN youtalk with a person if they always say the same thing?\u0027 　　On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible toguess whether it meant `yes\u0027 or `no.\u0027 　　So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had foundthe Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, andput the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. `Now, Kitty!\u0027 shecried, clapping her hands triumphantly. `Confess that was what you turnedinto!\u0027 　　(`But it wouldn\u0027t look at it,\u0027 she said, when she was explaining thething afterwards to her sister: `it turned away its head, and pretended notto see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it MUSThave been the Red Queen.\u0027)`Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!\u0027 Alice cried with a merry laugh. 　　`And curtsey while you\u0027re thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time,remember!\u0027 And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, `just inhonour of having been a Red Queen.\u0027 　　`Snowdrop, my pet!\u0027 she went on, looking over her shoulder at theWhite Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, `when WILLDinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must bethe reason you were so untidy in my dream-- Dinah! do you know thatyou\u0027re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it\u0027s most disrespectful of you! 　　`And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?\u0027 she prattled on, as shesettled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. `Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to HumptyDumpty? I THINK you did--however, you\u0027d better not mention it to yourfriends just yet, for I\u0027m not sure. 　　`By the way, Kitty, if only you\u0027d been really with me in my dream,there was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity ofpoetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have areal treat. All the time you\u0027re eating your breakfast, I\u0027ll repeat \"TheWalrus and the Carpenter\" to you; and then you can make believe it\u0027soysters, dear! 　　`Now, Kitty, let\u0027s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is aserious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your pawlike that--as if Dinah hadn\u0027t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, itMUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DOhelp to settle it! I\u0027m sure your paw can wait!\u0027 But the provoking kittenonly began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn\u0027t heard the question. 　　Which do YOU think it was? 　　A boat beneath a sunny sky,Lingering onward dreamilyIn an eveningof July-Children three that nestle near,Eager eye and willing ear,Pleased asimple tale to hear-Long has paled that sunny sky:Echoes fade and memories die.Autumnfrosts have slain July. 　　Still she haunts me, phantomwise,Alice moving under skiesNever seenby waking eyes. 　　Children yet, the tale to hear,Eager eye and willing ear,Lovingly shallnestle near. 　　In a Wonderland they lie,Dreaming as the days go by,Dreaming as thesummers die: 　　Ever drifting down the stream--Lingering in the golden gleam--Life,what is it but a dream?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/316.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
