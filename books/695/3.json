{"id":37307,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 Looking-Glass Insects","content":"Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of thecountry she was going to travel through. `It\u0027s something very likelearning geography,\u0027 thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes ofbeing able to see a little further. `Principal rivers--there ARE none. 　　Principal mountains--I\u0027m on the only one, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s got anyname. Principal towns--why, what ARE those creatures, making honeydown there? They can\u0027t be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off, youknow--\u0027 and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that wasbustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, `just asif it was a regular bee,\u0027 thought Alice. 　　However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was anelephant--as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breathaway at first. `And what enormous flowers they must be!\u0027 was her nextidea. `Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put tothem--and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I\u0027ll go downand--no, I won\u0027t JUST yet, \u0027 she went on, checking herself just as she wasbeginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turningshy so suddenly. `It\u0027ll never do to go down among them without a goodlong branch to brush them away--and what fun it\u0027ll be when they ask mehow I like my walk. I shall say-- \"Oh, I like it well enough--\"\u0027 (herecame the favourite little toss of the head), `\"only it was so dusty and hot,and the elephants did tease so!\"\u0027 　　`I think I\u0027ll go down the other way,\u0027 she said after a pause: `andperhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to getinto the Third Square!\u0027 　　So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the firstof the six little brooks. 　　* * * * * * ** * * ** ** * * * * * *`Tickets, please!\u0027 said the Guard, putting his head in at the window. 　　In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about thesame size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage. 　　`Now then! Show your ticket, child!\u0027 the Guard went on, lookingangrily at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (`like thechorus of a song,\u0027 thought Alice), `Don\u0027t keep him waiting, child! Why,his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!\u0027 　　`I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t got one,\u0027 Alice said in a frightened tone: `therewasn\u0027t a ticket-office where I came from.\u0027 And again the chorus of voiceswent on. `There wasn\u0027t room for one where she came from. The landthere is worth a thousand pounds an inch!\u0027 　　`Don\u0027t make excuses,\u0027 said the Guard: `you should have boughtone from the engine-driver.\u0027 And once more the chorus of voices went onwith `The man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth athousand pounds a puff!\u0027 　　Alice thought to herself, `Then there\u0027s no use in speaking.\u0027 Thevoices didn\u0027t join in this time, as she hadn\u0027t spoken, but to her greatsurprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand whatTHINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ don\u0027t),`Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!\u0027 　　`I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!\u0027 　　thought Alice. 　　All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,then through a microscope, and then through an opera- glass. At last hesaid, `You\u0027re travelling the wrong way,\u0027 and shut up the window and wentaway. 　　`So young a child,\u0027 said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (hewas dressed in white paper), `ought to know which way she\u0027s going, evenif she doesn\u0027t know her own name!\u0027 　　A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyesand said in a loud voice, `She ought to know her way to the ticket-office,even if she doesn\u0027t know her alphabet!\u0027 　　There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queercarriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be thatthey should all speak in turn, HE went on with `She\u0027ll have to go back from here as luggage!\u0027 　　Alice couldn\u0027t see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarsevoice spoke next. `Change engines--\u0027 it said, and was obliged to leaveoff. 　　`It sounds like a horse,\u0027 Alice thought to herself. And an extremelysmall voice, close to her ear, said, `You might make a joke on that-something about \"horse\" and \"hoarse,\" you know.\u0027 　　Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, `She must be labelled\"Lass, with care,\" you know--\u0027 　　And after that other voices went on (What a number of people thereare in the carriage!\u0027 thought Alice), saying, `She must go by post, as she\u0027sgot a head on her--\u0027 `She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--\u0027 　　`She must draw the train herself the rest of the way--\u0027 and so on. 　　But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards andwhispered in her ear, `Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take areturn-ticket every time the train stops.\u0027 　　`Indeed I shan\u0027t!\u0027 Alice said rather impatiently. `I don\u0027t belong tothis railway journey at all--I was in a wood just now --and I wish I couldget back there.\u0027 　　`You might make a joke on THAT,\u0027 said the little voice close to herear: `something about \"you WOULD if you could,\" you know.\u0027 　　`Don\u0027t tease so,\u0027 said Alice, looking about in vain to see where thevoice came from; `if you\u0027re so anxious to have a joke made, why don\u0027t youmake one yourself?\u0027 　　The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently,and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, `If it wouldonly sigh like other people!\u0027 she thought. But this was such awonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn\u0027t have heard it at all, if it hadn\u0027tcome QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickledher ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappinessof the poor little creature. 　　`I know you are a friend, the little voice went on; `a dear friend, andan old friend. And you won\u0027t hurt me, though I AM an insect.\u0027 　　`What kind of insect?\u0027 Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thoughtthis wouldn\u0027t be quite a civil question to ask. 　　`What, then you don\u0027t--\u0027 the little voice began, when it was drownedby a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm,Alice among the rest. 　　The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew itin and said, `It\u0027s only a brook we have to jump over.\u0027 Everybody seemedsatisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trainsjumping at all. `However, it\u0027ll take us into the Fourth Square, that\u0027s somecomfort!\u0027 she said to herself. In another moment she felt the carriage risestraight up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest toher hand. which happened to be the Goat\u0027s beard. 　　* * * * * * ** * * * * ** * * * * * *But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she foundherself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the insectshe had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head,and fanning her with its wings. 　　It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: `about the size of a chicken,\u0027 　　Alice thought. Still, she couldn\u0027t feel nervous with it, after they had beentalking together so long. 　　`--then you don\u0027t like all insects?\u0027 the Gnat went on, as quietly as ifnothing had happened. 　　`I like them when they can talk,\u0027 Alice said. `None of them evertalk, where _I_ come from.\u0027 　　`What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from?\u0027 theGnat inquired. 　　`I don\u0027t REJOICE in insects at all,\u0027 Alice explained, `because I\u0027mrather afraid of them--at least the large kinds. But I can tell you thenames of some of them.\u0027 　　`Of course they answer to their names?\u0027 the Gnat remarkedcarelessly. 　　`I never knew them do it.\u0027 　　`What\u0027s the use of their having names the Gnat said, `if they won\u0027tanswer to them?\u0027 　　`No use to THEM,\u0027 said Alice; `but it\u0027s useful to the people whoname them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?\u0027 　　`I can\u0027t say,\u0027 the Gnat replied. `Further on, in the wood down there,they\u0027ve got no names--however, go on with your list of insects: you\u0027rewasting time.\u0027 　　`Well, there\u0027s the Horse-fly,\u0027 Alice began, counting off the names onher fingers. 　　`All right,\u0027 said the Gnat: `half way up that bush, you\u0027ll see aRocking-horse-fly, if you look. It\u0027s made entirely of wood, and getsabout by swinging itself from branch to branch.\u0027 　　`What does it live on?\u0027 Alice asked, with great curiosity. 　　`Sap and sawdust,\u0027 said the Gnat. `Go on with the list.\u0027 　　Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, andmade up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so brightand sticky; and then she went on. 　　`And there\u0027s the Dragon-fly.\u0027 　　`Look on the branch above your head,\u0027 said the Gnat, `and thereyou\u0027ll find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, itswings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.\u0027 　　`And what does it live on?\u0027 　　`Frumenty and mince pie,\u0027 the Gnat replied; `and it makes its nest ina Christmas box.\u0027 　　`And then there\u0027s the Butterfly,\u0027 Alice went on, after she had taken agood look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, `Iwonder if that\u0027s the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles-because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!\u0027 　　`Crawling at your feet,\u0027 said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back insome alarm), `you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thinslices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump ofsugar.\u0027 　　`And what does IT live on?\u0027 　　`Weak tea with cream in it.\u0027 　　A new difficulty came into Alice\u0027s head. `Supposing it couldn\u0027tfind any?\u0027 she suggested. 　　`Then it would die, of course.\u0027 　　`But that must happen very often,\u0027 Alice remarked thoughtfully. 　　`It always happens,\u0027 said the Gnat. 　　After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnatamused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at lastit settled again and remarked, `I suppose you don\u0027t want to lose yourname?\u0027 　　`No, indeed,\u0027 Alice said, a little anxiously. 　　`And yet I don\u0027t know,\u0027 the Gnat went on in a careless tone: `onlythink how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home withoutit! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, shewould call out \"come here--,\" and there she would have to leave off,because there wouldn\u0027t be any name for her to call, and of course youwouldn\u0027t have to go, you know.\u0027 　　`That would never do, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Alice: `the governess wouldnever think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn\u0027t remember myname, she\u0027d call me \"Miss!\" as the servants do.\u0027 　　`Well. if she said \"Miss,\" and didn\u0027t say anything more,\u0027 the Gnatremarked, `of course you\u0027d miss your lessons. That\u0027s a joke. I wishYOU had made it.\u0027 　　`Why do you wish _I_ had made it?\u0027 Alice asked. `It\u0027s a very badone.\u0027 　　But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rollingdown its cheeks. 　　`You shouldn\u0027t make jokes,\u0027 Alice said, `if it makes you so unhappy.\u0027 　　Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this timethe poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alicelooked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as shewas getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walkedon. 　　She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other sideof it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up hermind to go on: `for I certainly won\u0027t go BACK,\u0027 she thought to herself,and this was the only way to the Eighth Square. 　　`This must be the wood, she said thoughtfully to herself, `wherethings have no names. I wonder what\u0027ll become of MY name when I goin? I shouldn\u0027t like to lose it at all--because they\u0027d have to give meanother, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then thefun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name! That\u0027sjust like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs-\"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF `DASH:\u0027 HAD ON A BRASSCOLLAR\"--just fancy calling everything you met \"Alice,\" till one of themanswered! Only they wouldn\u0027t answer at all, if they were wise.\u0027 　　She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: itlooked very cool and shady. `Well, at any rate it\u0027s a great comfort,\u0027 shesaid as she stepped under the trees, `after being so hot, to get into the--intoWHAT?\u0027 she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of theword. `I mean to get under the--under the--under THIS, you know!\u0027 　　putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. `What DOES it call itself, Iwonder? I do believe it\u0027s got no name--why, to be sure it hasn\u0027t!\u0027 　　She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly beganagain. `Then it really HAS happened, after all! And now, who am I? 　　I WILL remember, if I can! I\u0027m determined to do it!\u0027 But beingdetermined didn\u0027t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal ofpuzzling, was, `L, I KNOW it begins with L!\u0027 　　Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with itslarge gentle eyes, but didn\u0027t seem at all frightened. `Here then! Herethen!\u0027 Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it onlystarted back a little, and then stood looking at her again. 　　`What do you call yourself?\u0027 the Fawn said at last. Such a softsweet voice it had! 　　`I wish I knew!\u0027 thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,`Nothing, just now.\u0027 　　`Think again,\u0027 it said: `that won\u0027t do.\u0027 　　Alice thought, but nothing came of it. `Please, would you tell me what YOU call yourself?\u0027 she said timidly. `I think that might help alittle.\u0027 　　`I\u0027ll tell you, if you\u0027ll move a little further on,\u0027 the Fawn said. `I can\u0027tremember here.\u0027 　　So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her armsclasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out intoanother open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,and shook itself free from Alice\u0027s arms. `I\u0027m a Fawn!\u0027 it cried out in a voiceof delight, `and, dear me! you\u0027re a human child!\u0027 A sudden look of alarmcame into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had dartedaway at full speed. 　　Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation athaving lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. `However, I knowmy name now.\u0027 she said, `that\u0027s SOME comfort. Alice--Alice--I won\u0027tforget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow, Iwonder?\u0027 　　It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only oneroad through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. 　　`I\u0027ll settle it,\u0027 Alice said to herself, `when the road divides and they pointdifferent ways.\u0027 　　But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a longway, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-postspointing the same way, one marked `TO TWEEDLEDUM\u0027S HOUSE\u0027 andthe other `TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.\u0027 　　`I do believe,\u0027 said Alice at last, `that they live in the same house! Iwonder I never thought of that before--But I can\u0027t stay there long. I\u0027ll justcall and say \"how d\u0027you do?\" and ask them the way out of the wood. If Icould only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!\u0027 So she wanderedon, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she cameupon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back,but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/307.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
