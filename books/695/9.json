{"id":37313,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 Queen Alice","content":"`Well, this IS grand!\u0027 said Alice. `I never expected I should be aQueen so soon--and I\u0027ll tell you what it is, your majesty,\u0027 she went on in asevere tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), `it\u0027ll never dofor you to be lolling about on the grass like that! Queens have to bedignified, you know!\u0027 　　So she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as shewas afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herselfwith the thought that there was nobody to see her, `and if I really am aQueen,\u0027 she said as she sat down again, `I shall be able to manage it quitewell in time.\u0027 　　Everything was happening so oddly that she didn\u0027t feel a bitsurprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close toher, one on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them howthey came there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However,there would be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. 　　`Please, would you tell me--\u0027 she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen. 　　`Speak when you\u0027re spoken to!\u0027 The Queen sharply interrupted her. 　　`But if everybody obeyed that rule,\u0027 said Alice, who was alwaysready for a little argument, `and if you only spoke when you were spokento, and the other person always waited for YOU to begin, you see nobodywould ever say anything, so that--\u0027 　　`Ridiculous!\u0027 cried the Queen. `Why, don\u0027t you see, child--\u0027 hereshe broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenlychanged the subject of the conversation. `What do you mean by \"If youreally are a Queen\"? What right have you to call yourself so? You can\u0027tbe a Queen, you know, till you\u0027ve passed the proper examination. Andthe sooner we begin it, the better.\u0027 　　`I only said \"if\"!\u0027 poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone. 　　The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked,with a little shudder, `She SAYS she only said \"if\"--\u0027 　　`But she said a great deal more than that!\u0027 the White Queen moaned, wringing her hands. `Oh, ever so much more than that!\u0027 　　`So you did, you know,\u0027 the Red Queen said to Alice. `Alwaysspeak the truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.\u0027 　　`I\u0027m sure I didn\u0027t mean--\u0027 Alice was beginning, but the Red Queeninterrupted her impatiently. 　　`That\u0027s just what I complain of! You SHOULD have meant! 　　What do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even ajoke should have some meaning--and a child\u0027s more important than a joke,I hope. You couldn\u0027t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.\u0027 `Idon\u0027t deny things with my HANDS,\u0027 Alice objected. 　　`Nobody said you did,\u0027 said the Red Queen. `I said you couldn\u0027t ifyou tried.\u0027 　　`She\u0027s in that state of mind,\u0027 said the White Queen, `that she wants todeny SOMETHING--only she doesn\u0027t know what to deny!\u0027 　　`A nasty, vicious temper,\u0027 the Red Queen remarked; and then therewas an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two. 　　The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, `Iinvite you to Alice\u0027s dinner-party this afternoon.\u0027 　　The White Queen smiled feebly, and said `And I invite YOU.\u0027 　　`I didn\u0027t know I was to have a party at all,\u0027 said Alice; `but if there isto be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.\u0027 　　`We gave you the opportunity of doing it,\u0027 the Red Queen remarked: 　　`but I daresay you\u0027ve not had many lessons in manners yet?\u0027 　　`Manners are not taught in lessons,\u0027 said Alice. `Lessons teach youto do sums, and things of that sort.\u0027 　　`And you do Addition?\u0027 the White Queen asked. `What\u0027s one andone and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?\u0027 　　`I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Alice. `I lost count.\u0027 　　`She can\u0027t do Addition,\u0027 the Red Queen interrupted. `Can you doSubtraction? Take nine from eight.\u0027 　　`Nine from eight I can\u0027t, you know,\u0027 Alice replied very readily: `but-\u0027 　　`She can\u0027t do Subtraction,\u0027 said the White Queen. `Can you doDivision? Divide a loaf by a knife--what\u0027s the answer to that?\u0027 　　`I suppose--\u0027 Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered forher. `Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Takea bone from a dog: what remains?\u0027 　　Alice considered. `The bone wouldn\u0027t remain, of course, if I tookit--and the dog wouldn\u0027t remain; it would come to bite me --and I\u0027m sure Ishouldn\u0027t remain!\u0027 　　`Then you think nothing would remain?\u0027 said the Red Queen. 　　`I think that\u0027s the answer.\u0027 　　`Wrong, as usual,\u0027 said the Red Queen: `the dog\u0027s temper wouldremain.\u0027 　　`But I don\u0027t see how--\u0027 　　`Why, look here!\u0027 the Red Queen cried. `The dog would lose itstemper, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 　　`Perhaps it would,\u0027 Alice replied cautiously. 　　`Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!\u0027 the Queenexclaimed triumphantly. 　　Alice said, as gravely as she could, `They might go different ways.\u0027 　　But she couldn\u0027t help thinking to herself, `What dreadful nonsense weARE talking!\u0027 　　`She can\u0027t do sums a BIT!\u0027 the Queens said together, with greatemphasis. 　　`Can YOU do sums?\u0027 Alice said, turning suddenly on the WhiteQueen, for she didn\u0027t like being found fault with so much. 　　The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. `I can do Addition,\u0027 `if yougive me time--but I can do Subtraction, under ANY circumstances!\u0027 　　`Of course you know your A B C?\u0027 said the Red Queen. 　　`To be sure I do.\u0027 said Alice. 　　`So do I,\u0027 the White Queen whispered: `we\u0027ll often say it overtogether, dear. And I\u0027ll tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter! 　　Isn\u0027t THAT grand! However, don\u0027t be discouraged. You\u0027ll come to it intime.\u0027 　　Here the Red Queen began again. `Can you answer usefulquestions?\u0027 she said. `How is bread made?\u0027 　　`I know THAT!\u0027 Alice cried eagerly. `You take some flour--\u0027 　　`Where do you pick the flower?\u0027 the White Queen asked. `In agarden, or in the hedges?\u0027 　　`Well, it isn\u0027t PICKED at all,\u0027 Alice explained: `it\u0027s GROUND --\u0027 　　`How many acres of ground?\u0027 said the White Queen. `You mustn\u0027tleave out so many things.\u0027 　　`Fan her head!\u0027 the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. `She\u0027ll befeverish after so much thinking.\u0027 So they set to work and fanned her withbunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hairabout so. 　　`She\u0027s all right again now,\u0027 said the Red Queen. `Do you knowLanguages? What\u0027s the French for fiddle-de-dee?\u0027 　　`Fiddle-de-dee\u0027s not English,\u0027 Alice replied gravely. 　　`Who ever said it was?\u0027 said the Red Queen. 　　Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. `If you\u0027lltell me what language \"fiddle-de-dee\" is, I\u0027ll tell you the French for it!\u0027 sheexclaimed triumphantly. 　　But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said `Queensnever make bargains.\u0027 　　`I wish Queens never asked questions,\u0027 Alice thought to herself. 　　`Don\u0027t let us quarrel,\u0027 the White Queen said in an anxious tone. 　　`What is the cause of lightning?\u0027 　　`The cause of lightning,\u0027 Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quitecertain about this, `is the thunder--no, no!\u0027 she hastily corrected herself. 　　`I meant the other way.\u0027 　　`It\u0027s too late to correct it,\u0027 said the Red Queen: `when you\u0027ve oncesaid a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.\u0027 　　`Which reminds me--\u0027 the White Queen said, looking down andnervously clasping and unclasping her hands, `we had SUCH athunderstorm last Tuesday--I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, youknow.\u0027 　　Alice was puzzled. `In OUR country,\u0027 she remarked, `there\u0027s onlyone day at a time.\u0027 　　The Red Queen said, `That\u0027s a poor thin way of doing things. NowHERE, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together--forwarmth, you know.\u0027 　　`Are five nights warmer than one night, then?\u0027 Alice ventured to ask. 　　`Five times as warm, of course.\u0027 　　`But they should be five times as COLD, by the same rule--\u0027 　　`Just so!\u0027 cried the Red Queen. `Five times as warm, AND fivetimes as cold--just as I\u0027m five times as rich as you are, AND five times asclever!\u0027 　　Alice sighed and gave it up. `It\u0027s exactly like a riddle with noanswer!\u0027 she thought. 　　`Humpty Dumpty saw it too,\u0027 the White Queen went on in a lowvoice, more as if she were talking to herself. `He came to the door with acorkscrew in his hand--\u0027 　　`What did he want?\u0027 said the Red Queen. 　　`He said he WOULD come in,\u0027 the White Queen went on, `becausehe was looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasn\u0027tsuch a thing in the house, that morning.\u0027 　　`Is there generally?\u0027 Alice asked in an astonished tone. 　　`Well, only on Thursdays,\u0027 said the Queen. 　　`I know what he came for,\u0027 said Alice: `he wanted to punish thefish, because--\u0027 　　Here the White Queen began again. `It was SUCH a thunderstorm,you can\u0027t think!\u0027 (She NEVER could, you know,\u0027 said the Red Queen.)`And part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and itwent rolling round the room in great lumps-- and knocking over the tablesand things--till I was so frightened, I couldn\u0027t remember my own name!\u0027 　　Alice thought to herself, `I never should TRY to remember my namein the middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it?\u0027 but she didnot say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen\u0027s feeling. 　　`Your Majesty must excuse her,\u0027 the Red Queen said to Alice, takingone of the White Queen\u0027s hands in her own, and gently stroking it: `shemeans well, but she can\u0027t help saying foolish things, as a general rule.\u0027 　　The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she OUGHT tosay something kind, but really couldn\u0027t think of anything at the moment. 　　`She never was really well brought up,\u0027 the Red Queen went on: `butit\u0027s amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see howpleased she\u0027ll be!\u0027 But this was more than Alice had courage to do. 　　`A little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonderswith her--\u0027 　　The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice\u0027sshoulder. `I AM so sleepy?\u0027 she moaned. 　　`She\u0027s tired, poor thing!\u0027 said the Red Queen. `Smooth her hair-lend her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.\u0027 　　`I haven\u0027t got a nightcap with me,\u0027 said Alice, as she tried to obeythe first direction: `and I don\u0027t know any soothing lullabies.\u0027 　　`I must do it myself, then,\u0027 said the Red Queen, and she began: 　　`Hush-a-by lady, in Alice\u0027s lap! Till the feast\u0027sready, we\u0027ve time for a nap: When the feast\u0027s over, we\u0027ll go tothe ball-- Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all! 　　`And now you know the words,\u0027 she added, as she put her headdown on Alice\u0027s other shoulder, `just sing it through to ME. I\u0027m gettingsleepy, too.\u0027 In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, andsnoring loud. 　　`What AM I to do?\u0027 exclaimed Alice, looking about in greatperplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down fromher shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. `I don\u0027t think it EVERhappened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep atonce! No, not in all the History of England--it couldn\u0027t, you know,because there never was more than one Queen at a time. `Do wake up,you heavy things!\u0027 she went on in an impatient tone; but there was noanswer but a gentle snoring. 　　The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more likea tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened soeagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardlymissed them. 　　She was standing before an arched doorway over which were thewords QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch therewas a bell-handle; one was marked `Visitors\u0027 Bell,\u0027 and the other `Servants\u0027 　　Bell.\u0027 　　`I\u0027ll wait till the song\u0027s over,\u0027 thought Alice, `and then I\u0027ll ring--the-WHICH bell must I ring?\u0027 she went on, very much puzzled by the names. 　　`I\u0027m not a visitor, and I\u0027m not a servant. There OUGHT to be one marked\"Queen,\" you know--\u0027 　　Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a longbeak put its head out for a moment and said `No admittance till the weekafter next!\u0027 and shut the door again with a bang. 　　Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a veryold Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towardsher: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on. 　　`What is it, now?\u0027 the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper. 　　Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. `Where\u0027s theservant whose business it is to answer the door?\u0027 she began angrily. 　　`Which door?\u0027 said the Frog. 　　Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which hespoke. `THIS door, of course!\u0027 　　The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: 　　then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were tryingwhether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice. 　　`To answer the door?\u0027 he said. `What\u0027s it been asking of?\u0027 He wasso hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him. 　　`I don\u0027t know what you mean,\u0027 she said. 　　`I talks English, doesn\u0027t I?\u0027 the Frog went on. `Or are you deaf? 　　What did it ask you?\u0027 　　`Nothing!\u0027 Alice said impatiently. `I\u0027ve been knocking at it!\u0027 　　`Shouldn\u0027t do that--shouldn\u0027t do that--\u0027 the Frog muttered. `Vexes it,you know.\u0027 Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of hisgreat feet. `You let IT alone,\u0027 he panted out, as he hobbled back to histree, `and it\u0027ll let YOU alone, you know.\u0027 　　At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice washeard singing: 　　`To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said, \"I\u0027ve asceptre in hand, I\u0027ve a crown on my head; Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be, Come and dine with the Red Queen, theWhite Queen, and me.\"\u0027 　　And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus: 　　`Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, And sprinklethe table with buttons and bran: Put cats in the coffee, and mice inthe tea-- And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!\u0027 　　Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought toherself, `Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any one\u0027scounting?\u0027 In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voicesang another verse;`\"O Looking-Glass creatures,\" quothe Alice, \"draw near! 　　\u0027Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: \u0027Tis a privilege high tohave dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen,and me!\"\u0027 　　Then came the chorus again: -`Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, Or anythingelse that is pleasant to drink: Mix sand with the cider, and wool withthe wine-- And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!\u0027 　　`Ninety times nine!\u0027 Alice repeated in despair, `Oh, that\u0027ll never bedone! I\u0027d better go in at once--\u0027 and there was a dead silence the momentshe appeared. 　　Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the largehall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: somewere animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them. 　　`I\u0027m glad they\u0027ve come without waiting to be asked,\u0027 she thought: `Ishould never have known who were the right people to invite!\u0027 　　There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and WhiteQueens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty. 　　Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing forsome one to speak. 　　At last the Red Queen began. `You\u0027ve missed the soup and fish,\u0027 　　she said. `Put on the joint!\u0027 And the waiters set a leg of mutton beforeAlice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve ajoint before. 　　`You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,\u0027 　　said the Red Queen. `Alice--Mutton; Mutton--Alice.\u0027 The leg of muttongot up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned thebow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused. 　　`May I give you a slice?\u0027 she said, taking up the knife and fork, andlooking from one Queen to the other. 　　`Certainly not,\u0027 the Red Queen said, very decidedly: `it isn\u0027t etiquetteto cut any one you\u0027ve been introduced to. Remove the joint!\u0027 And thewaiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place. 　　`I won\u0027t be introduced to the pudding, please,\u0027 Alice said ratherhastily, `or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?\u0027 　　But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled `Pudding--Alice;Alice--Pudding. Remove the pudding!\u0027 and the waiters took it away soquickly that Alice couldn\u0027t return its bow. 　　However, she didn\u0027t see why the Red Queen should be the only oneto give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out `Waiter! Bring back thepudding!\u0027 and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. Itwas so large that she couldn\u0027t help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as shehad been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a greateffort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen. 　　`What impertinence!\u0027 said the Pudding. `I wonder how you\u0027d likeit, if I were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature!\u0027 　　It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn\u0027t a word tosay in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp. 　　`Make a remark,\u0027 said the Red Queen: `it\u0027s ridiculous to leave allthe conversation to the pudding!\u0027 　　`Do you know, I\u0027ve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me today,\u0027 Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment sheopened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her;`and it\u0027s a very curious thing, I think-- every poem was about fishes insome way. Do you know why they\u0027re so fond of fishes, all about here?\u0027 　　She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of themark. `As to fishes,\u0027 she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting hermouth close to Alice\u0027s ear, `her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in poetry--all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?\u0027 　　`Her Red Majesty\u0027s very kind to mention it,\u0027 the White Queenmurmured into Alice\u0027s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. 　　`It would be SUCH a treat! May I?\u0027 　　`Please do,\u0027 Alice said very politely. 　　The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice\u0027s cheek. 　　Then she began: 　　`\"First, the fish must be caught.\" That is easy: ababy, I think, could have caught it. \"Next, the fish must bebought.\" That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it. 　　\"Now cook me the fish!\" That is easy, and will not takemore than a minute. \"Let it lie in a dish!\" That is easy,because it already is in it. 　　\"Bring it here! Let me sup!\" It is easy to set such adish on the table. \"Take the dish-cover up!\" Ah, THAT isso hard that I fear I\u0027m unable! 　　For it holds it like glue-- Holds the lid to the dish,while it lies in the middle: Which is easiest to do, Undish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?\u0027 　　`Take a minute to think about it, and then guess,\u0027 said the RedQueen. `Meanwhile, we\u0027ll drink your health--Queen Alice\u0027s health!\u0027 shescreamed at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking itdirectly, and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glassesupon their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down theirfaces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the edgesof the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos) scrambledinto the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up the gravy, `justlike pigs in a trough!\u0027 thought Alice. 　　`You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,\u0027 the Red Queen said,frowning at Alice as she spoke. 　　`We must support you, you know,\u0027 the White Queen whispered, asAlice got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened. 　　`Thank you very much,\u0027 she whispered in reply, `but I can do quitewell without.\u0027 　　`That wouldn\u0027t be at all the thing,\u0027 the Red Queen said verydecidedly: so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace. 　　(`And they DID push so!\u0027 she said afterwards, when she was tellingher sister the history of the feast. `You would have thought they wantedto squeeze me flat!\u0027)In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while shemade her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, thatthey nearly lifted her up into the air: `I rise to return thanks--\u0027 Alicebegan: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but she gothold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down again. 　　`Take care of yourself!\u0027 screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice\u0027shair with both her hands. `Something\u0027s going to happen!\u0027 　　And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of thinghappened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, lookingsomething like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles,they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, andso, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: `and verylike birds they look,\u0027 Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in thedreadful confusion that was beginning. 　　At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned tosee what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. `Here I am!\u0027 cried a voicefrom the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see theQueen\u0027s broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over theedge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup. 　　There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guestswere lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the tabletowards Alice\u0027s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of itsway. 　　`I can\u0027t stand this any longer!\u0027 she cried as she jumped up and seizedthe table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes, guests,and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor. 　　`And as for YOU,\u0027 she went on, turning fiercely upon the RedQueen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to thesize of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round andround after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her. 　　At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but shewas far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. `As for YOU,\u0027 　　she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumpingover a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, `I\u0027ll shake you into akitten, that I will!\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/313.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
