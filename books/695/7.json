{"id":37311,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7 The Lion and the Unicorn","content":"The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at firstin twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowdsthat they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fearof being run over, and watched them go by.\n 　　She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers souncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something orother, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, sothat the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.\n 　　Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed ratherbetter than the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then;and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled therider fell off instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alicewas very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she foundthe White King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.\n 　　`I\u0027ve sent them all!\u0027 the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeingAlice. `Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you camethrough the wood?\u0027\n 　　`Yes, I did,\u0027 said Alice: `several thousand, I should think.\u0027\n 　　`Four thousand two hundred and seven, that\u0027s the exact number,\u0027 theKing said, referring to his book. `I couldn\u0027t send all the horses, you know,because two of them are wanted in the game. And I haven\u0027t sent the twoMessengers, either. They\u0027re both gone to the town. Just look along theroad, and tell me if you can see either of them.\u0027\n 　　`I see nobody on the road,\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`I only wish _I_ had such eyes,\u0027 the King remarked in a fretful tone.\n 　　`To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, it\u0027s as muchas _I_ can do to see real people, by this light!\u0027\n 　　All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along theroad, shading her eyes with one hand. `I see somebody now!\u0027 sheexclaimed at last. `But he\u0027s coming very slowly--and what curious attitudes he goes into!\u0027 (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spreadout like fans on each side.)`Not at all,\u0027 said the King. `He\u0027s an Anglo-Saxon Messenger-- andthose are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he\u0027s happy.\n 　　His name is Haigha.\u0027 (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with `mayor.\u0027)`I love my love with an H,\u0027 Alice couldn\u0027t help beginning, `becausehe is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed himwith--with--with Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and helives--\u0027\n 　　`He lives on the Hill,\u0027 the King remarked simply, without the leastidea that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating forthe name of a town beginning with H. `The other Messenger\u0027s calledHatta. I must have TWO, you know--to come and go. Once to come,and one to go.\u0027\n 　　`I beg your pardon?\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`It isn\u0027t respectable to beg,\u0027 said the King.\n 　　`I only meant that I didn\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Alice. `Why one tocome and one to go?\u0027\n 　　`Didn\u0027t I tell you?\u0027 the King repeated impatiently. `I must haveTwo--to fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry.\u0027\n 　　At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out ofbreath to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make themost fearful faces at the poor King.\n 　　`This young lady loves you with an H,\u0027 the King said, introducingAlice in the hope of turning off the Messenger\u0027s attention from himself-but it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinaryevery moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.\n 　　`You alarm me!\u0027 said the King. `I feel faint--Give me a hamsandwich!\u0027\n 　　On which the Messenger, to Alice\u0027s great amusement, opened a bagthat hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, whodevoured it greedily.\n 　　`Another sandwich!\u0027 said the King.\n 　　`There\u0027s nothing but hay left now,\u0027 the Messenger said, peeping intothe bag.\n 　　`Hay, then,\u0027 the King murmured in a faint whisper.\n 　　Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. `There\u0027snothing like eating hay when you\u0027re faint,\u0027 he remarked to her, as hemunched away.\n 　　`I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,\u0027 Alicesuggested: `or some sal-volatile.\u0027\n 　　`I didn\u0027t say there was nothing BETTER,\u0027 the King replied. `I saidthere was nothing LIKE it.\u0027 Which Alice did not venture to deny.\n 　　`Who did you pass on the road?\u0027 the King went on, holding out hishand to the Messenger for some more hay.\n 　　`Nobody,\u0027 said the Messenger.\n 　　`Quite right,\u0027 said the King: `this young lady saw him too. So ofcourse Nobody walks slower than you.\u0027\n 　　`I do my best,\u0027 the Messenger said in a sulky tone. `I\u0027m surenobody walks much faster than I do!\u0027\n 　　`He can\u0027t do that,\u0027 said the King, `or else he\u0027d have been here first.\n 　　However, now you\u0027ve got your breath, you may tell us what\u0027s happened inthe town.\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027ll whisper it,\u0027 said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouthin the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the King\u0027s ear.\n 　　Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too. However,instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice `They\u0027re atit again!\u0027\n 　　`Do you call THAT a whisper?\u0027 cried the poor King, jumping up andshaking himself. `If you do such a thing again, I\u0027ll have you buttered!\n 　　It went through and through my head like an earthquake!\u0027\n 　　`It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!\u0027 thought Alice. `Whoare at it again?\u0027 she ventured to ask.\n 　　`Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,\u0027 said the King.\n 　　`Fighting for the crown?\u0027\n 　　`Yes, to be sure,\u0027 said the King: `and the best of the joke is, that it\u0027sMY crown all the while! Let\u0027s run and see them.\u0027 And they trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old song:-`The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:\n 　　The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town. Some gave themwhite bread, some gave them brown; Some gave them plum-cakeand drummed them out of town.\u0027\n 　　`Does--the one--that wins--get the crown?\u0027 she asked, as well asshe could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.\n 　　`Dear me, no!\u0027 said the King. `What an idea!\u0027\n 　　`Would you--be good enough,\u0027 Alice panted out, after running alittle further, `to stop a minute--just to get--one\u0027s breath again?\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027m GOOD enough,\u0027 the King said, `only I\u0027m not strong enough.\n 　　You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try tostop a Bandersnatch!\u0027\n 　　Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the Lionand Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that atfirst Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managedto distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.\n 　　They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger,was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a pieceof bread-and-butter in the other.\n 　　`He\u0027s only just out of prison, and he hadn\u0027t finished his tea when hewas sent in,\u0027 Haigha whispered to Alice: `and they only give themoyster-shells in there--so you see he\u0027s very hungry and thirsty. How areyou, dear child?\u0027 he went on, putting his arm affectionately round Hatta\u0027sneck.\n 　　Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread andbutter.\n 　　`Were you happy in prison, dear child?\u0027 said Haigha.\n 　　Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickleddown his cheek: but not a word would he say.\n 　　`Speak, can\u0027t you!\u0027 Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta onlymunched away, and drank some more tea.\n 　　`Speak, won\u0027t you!\u0027 cried the King. \u0027How are they getting on with the fight?\u0027\n 　　Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter. `They\u0027re getting on very well,\u0027 he said in a choking voice:\n 　　`each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.\u0027\n 　　`Then I suppose they\u0027ll soon bring the white bread and the brown?\u0027\n 　　Alice ventured to remark.\n 　　`It\u0027s waiting for \u0027em now,\u0027 said Hatta: `this is a bit of it as I\u0027meating.\u0027\n 　　There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and theUnicorn sat down, panting, while the King called out `Ten minutesallowed for refreshments!\u0027 Haigha and Hatta set to work at once,carrying rough trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece totaste, but it was VERY dry.\n 　　`I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll fight any more to-day,\u0027 the King said to Hatta:\n 　　`go and order the drums to begin.\u0027 And Hatta went bounding away like agrasshopper.\n 　　For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenlyshe brightened up. `Look, look!\u0027 she cried, pointing eagerly. `There\u0027s theWhite Queen running across the country! She came flying out of thewood over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run!\u0027\n 　　`There\u0027s some enemy after her, no doubt,\u0027 the King said, withouteven looking round. `That wood\u0027s full of them.\u0027\n 　　`But aren\u0027t you going to run and help her?\u0027 Alice asked, very muchsurprised at his taking it so quietly.\n 　　`No use, no use!\u0027 said the King. `She runs so fearfully quick. Youmight as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But I\u0027ll make a memorandumabout her, if you like--She\u0027s a dear good creature,\u0027 he repeated softly tohimself, as he opened his memorandum-book. `Do you spell \"creature\"with a double \"e\"?\u0027\n 　　At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in hispockets. `I had the best of it this time?\u0027 he said to the King, just glancingat him as he passed.\n 　　`A little--a little,\u0027 the King replied, rather nervously. `You shouldn\u0027thave run him through with your horn, you know.\u0027\n 　　`It didn\u0027t hurt him,\u0027 the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on,when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round ratherinstantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepestdisgust.\n 　　`What--is--this?\u0027 he said at last.\n 　　`This is a child!\u0027 Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice tointroduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an Anglo-Saxon attitude. `We only found it to-day. It\u0027s as large as life, and twiceas natural!\u0027\n 　　`I always thought they were fabulous monsters!\u0027 said the Unicorn.\n 　　`Is it alive?\u0027\n 　　`It can talk,\u0027 said Haigha, solemnly.\n 　　The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said `Talk, child.\u0027\n 　　Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began:\n 　　`Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! Inever saw one alive before!\u0027\n 　　`Well, now that we HAVE seen each other,\u0027 said the Unicorn, `ifyou\u0027ll believe in me, I\u0027ll believe in you. Is that a bargain?\u0027\n 　　`Yes, if you like,\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!\u0027 the Unicorn went on,turning from her to the King. `None of your brown bread for me!\u0027\n 　　`Certainly--certainly!\u0027 the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha.\n 　　`Open the bag!\u0027 he whispered. `Quick! Not that one-- that\u0027s full of hay!\u0027\n 　　Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of itAlice couldn\u0027t guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.\n 　　The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked verytired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. `What\u0027s this!\u0027 he said,blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that soundedlike the tolling of a great bell.\n 　　`Ah, what IS it, now?\u0027 the Unicorn cried eagerly. `You\u0027ll neverguess! _I_ couldn\u0027t.\u0027\n 　　The Lion looked at Alice wearily. `Are you animal--vegetable --ormineral?\u0027 he said, yawning at every other word.\n 　　`It\u0027s a fabulous monster!\u0027 the Unicorn cried out, before Alice couldreply.\n 　　`Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,\u0027 the Lion said, lyingdown and putting his chin on this paws. `And sit down, both of you,\u0027 (tothe King and the Unicorn): `fair play with the cake, you know!\u0027\n 　　The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit downbetween the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.\n 　　`What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW!\u0027 the Unicorn said,looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking offhis head, he trembled so much.\n 　　`I should win easy,\u0027 said the Lion.\n 　　`I\u0027m not so sure of that,\u0027 said the Unicorn.\n 　　`Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!\u0027 the Lion repliedangrily, half getting up as he spoke.\n 　　Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he wasvery nervous, and his voice quite quivered. `All round the town?\u0027 he said.\n 　　`That\u0027s a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the marketplace? You get the best view by the old bridge.\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\u0027 the Lion growled out as he lay down again.\n 　　`There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is,cutting up that cake!\u0027\n 　　Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the greatdish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. `It\u0027svery provoking!\u0027 she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite usedto being called `the Monster\u0027). `I\u0027ve cut several slices already, but theyalways join on again!\u0027\n 　　`You don\u0027t know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,\u0027 the Unicornremarked. `Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.\u0027\n 　　This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, andcarried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as shedid so. `NOW cut it up,\u0027 said the Lion, as she returned to her place withthe empty dish.\n 　　`I say, this isn\u0027t fair!\u0027 cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife inher hand, very much puzzled how to begin. `The Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me!\u0027\n 　　`She\u0027s kept none for herself, anyhow,\u0027 said the Lion. `Do you likeplum-cake, Monster?\u0027\n 　　But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.\n 　　Where the noise came from, she couldn\u0027t make out: the air seemedfull of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quitedeafened.
