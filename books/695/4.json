{"id":37308,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4 Tweedledum And Tweedledee","content":"They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round theother\u0027s neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because oneof them had `DUM\u0027 embroidered on his collar, and the other `DEE.\u0027 `Isuppose they\u0027ve each got \"TWEEDLE\" round at the back of the collar,\u0027 shesaid to herself.\\n\\n 　　They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she wasjust looking round to see if the word \"TWEEDLE\" was written at the backof each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the onemarked `DUM.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`If you think we\u0027re wax-works,\u0027 he said, `you ought to pay, youknow. Wax-works weren\u0027t made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Contrariwise,\u0027 added the one marked `DEE,\u0027 `if you think we\u0027realive, you ought to speak.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m sure I\u0027m very sorry,\u0027 was all Alice could say; for the words ofthe old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, andshe could hardly help saying them out loud:-so, They quite forgot their quarrel.\\n\\n 　　`Tweedledum and TweedledeeAgreed to have a battle;Had spoiled his nice newJustrattle.\\n\\n 　　then flewFor Tweedldown aedmonstrous crow,um said TweedledeeAs black as a tar-barrel; Which frig\u0027\\n\\n 　　htened both the heroes`I know what you\u0027re thinking about,\u0027 said Tweedledum: `but it isn\u0027tso, nohow.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Contrariwise,\u0027 continued Tweedledee, `if it was so, it might be; andif it were so, it would be; but as it isn\u0027t, it ain\u0027t. That\u0027s logic.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I was thinking,\u0027 Alice said very politely, `which is the best way outof this wood: it\u0027s getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?\u0027\\n\\n 　　But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.\\n\\n 　　They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alicecouldn\u0027t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying `First Boy!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Nohow!\u0027 Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth upagain with a snap.\\n\\n 　　`Next Boy!\u0027 said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she feltquite certain he would only shout out `Contrariwise!\u0027 and so he did.\\n\\n 　　`You\u0027ve been wrong!\u0027 cried Tweedledum. `The first thing in a visitis to say \"How d\u0027ye do?\" and shake hands!\u0027 And here the two brothersgave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free,to shake hands with her.\\n\\n 　　Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear ofhurting the other one\u0027s feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty,she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancinground in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards),and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to comefrom the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well asshe could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, likefiddles and fiddle-sticks.\\n\\n 　　`But it certainly WAS funny,\u0027 (Alice said afterwards, when she wastelling her sister the history of all this,) `to find myself singing \"HERE WEGO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH.\" I don\u0027t know when I began it,but somehow I felt as if I\u0027d been singing it a long long time!\u0027\\n\\n 　　The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. `Fourtimes round is enough for one dance,\u0027 Tweedledum panted out, and theyleft off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at thesame moment.\\n\\n 　　Then they let go of Alice\u0027s hands, and stood looking at her for aminute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn\u0027t know how tobegin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. `Itwould never do to say \"How d\u0027ye do?\" NOW,\u0027 she said to herself: `weseem to have got beyond that, somehow!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I hope you\u0027re not much tired?\u0027 she said at last.\\n\\n 　　`Nohow. And thank you VERY much for asking,\u0027 saidTweedledum.\\n\\n 　　`So much obliged!\u0027 added Tweedledee. `You like poetry?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Ye-es. pretty well--SOME poetry,\u0027 Alice said doubtfully. `Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?\u0027 `What shall I repeat toher?\u0027 said Tweedledee, looking round at Tweedledum with great solemneyes, and not noticing Alice\u0027s question.\\n\\n 　　`\"THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER\" is the longest,\u0027\\n\\n 　　Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.\\n\\n 　　Tweedledee began instantly:\\n\\n 　　`The sun was shining--\u0027\\n\\n 　　Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. `If it\u0027s VERY long,\u0027 she said,as politely as she could, `would you please tell me first which road--\u0027\\n\\n 　　Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:\\n\\n 　　`The sun was shining on the sea,Shining with all his might: He did his very best to makeThe billows smooth and bright-- And this was odd,because it was The middle of the night.\\n\\n 　　The moon was shining sulkily,Because she thought the sun Had got no business to bethere After the day was done-- \"It\u0027s veryrude of him,\" she said, \"To come and spoil the fun!\"The sea was wet as wet could be, Thesands were dry as dry. You could not see a cloud, becauseNo cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying over head-There were no birds to fly.\\n\\n 　　The Walrus and the Carpenter Werewalking close at hand; They wept like anything to seeSuch quantities of sand: \"If this were only cleared away,\"They said, \"it WOULD be grand!\"\"If seven maids with seven mopsSwept it for half a year, Do you suppose,\" the Walrus said,\"That they could get it clear?\" \"I doubt it,\" said theCarpenter, And shed a bitter tear.\\n\\n 　　\"O Oysters, come and walk with us!\"The Walrus did beseech. \"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four,To give a hand to each.\"The eldest Oyster looked at him. Butnever a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye,And shook his heavy head-- Meaning to say he did notchoose To leave the oyster-bed.\\n\\n 　　But four young oysters hurried up,All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, theirfaces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat-And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn\u0027t anyfeet.\\n\\n 　　Four other Oysters followed them,And yet another four; And thick and fast they came at last,And more, and more, and more-- All hopping through thefrothy waves, And scrambling to the shore.\\n\\n 　　The Walrus and the Carpenter Walkedon a mile or so, And then they rested on a rockConveniently low: And all the little Oysters stoodAnd waited in a row.\\n\\n 　　\"The time has come,\" the Walrus said,\"To talk of many things: Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax-- Of cabbages--and kings-- Andwhy the sea is boiling hot-- And whether pigs havewings.\"\"But wait a bit,\" the Oysters cried,\"Before we have our chat; For some of us are out of breath,And all of us are fat!\" \"No hurry!\" said the Carpenter.\\n\\n 　　They thanked him much for that.\\n\\n 　　\"A loaf of bread,\" the Walrus said, \"Iswhat we chiefly need: Pepper and vinegar besidesAre very good indeed-- Now if you\u0027re ready Oysters dear,We can begin to feed.\"\"But not on us!\" the Oysters cried,Turning a little blue, \"After such kindness, that would beA dismal thing to do!\" \"The night is fine,\" the Walrus said\"Do you admire the view?\\n\\n 　　\"It was so kind of you to come! Andyou are very nice!\" The Carpenter said nothing but\"Cut us another slice: I wish you were not quite so deaf-I\u0027ve had to ask you twice!\"\"It seems a shame,\" the Walrus said,\"To play them such a trick, After we\u0027ve brought them outso far, And made them trot so quick!\"The Carpenter said nothing but \"The butter\u0027s spread toothick!\"\"I weep for you,\" the Walrus said. \"Ideeply sympathize.\" With sobs and tears he sorted outThose of the largest size. Holding his pocket handkerchiefBefore his streaming eyes.\\n\\n 　　\"O Oysters,\" said the Carpenter.\\n\\n 　　\"You\u0027ve had a pleasant run! Shall we be trotting homeagain?\" But answer came there none-And that was scarcely odd, because They\u0027d eaten everyone.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I like the Walrus best,\u0027 said Alice: `because you see he was aLITTLE sorry for the poor oysters.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`He ate more than the Carpenter, though,\u0027 said Tweedledee. `You seehe held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn\u0027t count howmany he took: contrariwise.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`That was mean!\u0027 Alice said indignantly. `Then I like theCarpenter best--if he didn\u0027t eat so many as the Walrus.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`But he ate as many as he could get,\u0027 said Tweedledum.\\n\\n 　　This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, `Well! They wereBOTH very unpleasant characters--\u0027 Here she checked herself in somealarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a largesteam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likelyto be a wild beast. `Are there any lions or tigers about here?\u0027 she askedtimidly.\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s only the Red King snoring,\u0027 said Tweedledee.\\n\\n 　　`Come and look at him!\u0027 the brothers cried, and they each took one of Alice\u0027s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.\\n\\n 　　`Isn\u0027t he a LOVELY sight?\u0027 said Tweedledum.\\n\\n 　　Alice couldn\u0027t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-capon, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,and snoring loud--`fit to snore his head off!\u0027 as Tweedledum remarked.\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,\u0027 said Alice,who was a very thoughtful little girl.\\n\\n 　　`He\u0027s dreaming now,\u0027 said Tweedledee: `and what do you thinkhe\u0027s dreaming about?\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice said `Nobody can guess that.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Why, about YOU!\u0027 Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his handstriumphantly. `And if he left off dreaming about you, where do yousuppose you\u0027d be?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Where I am now, of course,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`Not you!\u0027 Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. `You\u0027d benowhere. Why, you\u0027re only a sort of thing in his dream!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`If that there King was to wake,\u0027 added Tweedledum, `you\u0027d go out-bang!--just like a candle!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I shouldn\u0027t!\u0027 Alice exclaimed indignantly. `Besides, if I\u0027M only asort of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Ditto\u0027 said Tweedledum.\\n\\n 　　`Ditto, ditto\u0027 cried Tweedledee.\\n\\n 　　He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn\u0027t help saying, `Hush!\\n\\n 　　You\u0027ll be waking him, I\u0027m afraid, if you make so much noise.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him,\u0027 said Tweedledum,`when you\u0027re only one of the things in his dream. You know very wellyou\u0027re not real.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I AM real!\u0027 said Alice and began to cry.\\n\\n 　　`You won\u0027t make yourself a bit realler by crying,\u0027 Tweedledeeremarked: `there\u0027s nothing to cry about.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`If I wasn\u0027t real,\u0027 Alice said--half-laughing though her tears, it allseemed so ridiculous--`I shouldn\u0027t be able to cry.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I hope you don\u0027t suppose those are real tears?\u0027 Tweedleduminterrupted in a tone of great contempt.\\n\\n 　　`I know they\u0027re talking nonsense,\u0027 Alice thought to herself: `and it\u0027sfoolish to cry about it.\u0027 So she brushed away her tears, and went on ascheerfully as she could. `At any rate I\u0027d better be getting out of the wood,for really it\u0027s coming on very dark. Do you think it\u0027s going to rain?\u0027\\n\\n 　　Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother,and looked up into it. `No, I don\u0027t think it is,\u0027 he said: `at least--notunder HERE. Nohow.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`But it may rain OUTSIDE?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`It may--if it chooses,\u0027 said Tweedledee: `we\u0027ve no objection.\\n\\n 　　Contrariwise.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Selfish things!\u0027 thought Alice, and she was just going to say `Goodnight\u0027 and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under theumbrella and seized her by the wrist.\\n\\n 　　`Do you see THAT?\u0027 he said, in a voice choking with passion, andhis eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with atrembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s only a rattle,\u0027 Alice said, after a careful examination of the littlewhite thing. `Not a rattleSNAKE, you know,\u0027 she added hastily, thinkingthat he was frightened: only an old rattle--quite old and broken.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I knew it was!\u0027 cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildlyand tear his hair. `It\u0027s spoilt, of course!\u0027 Here he looked at Tweedledee,who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself underthe umbrella.\\n\\n 　　Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, `Youneedn\u0027t be so angry about an old rattle.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`But it isn\u0027t old!\u0027 Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever.\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s new, I tell you--I bought it yesterday--my nice New RATTLE!\u0027 and hisvoice rose to a perfect scream.\\n\\n 　　All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that itquite took off Alice\u0027s attention from the angry brother. But he couldn\u0027tquite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella,with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouthand his large eyes--\u0027looking more like a fish than anything else,\u0027 Alice thought.\\n\\n 　　`Of course you agree to have a battle?\u0027 Tweedledum said in a calmertone.\\n\\n 　　`I suppose so,\u0027 the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of theumbrella: `only SHE must help us to dress up, you know.\u0027\\n\\n 　　So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, andreturned in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters,blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. `I hopeyou\u0027re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?\u0027 Tweedledum remarked.\\n\\n 　　`Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made aboutanything in all her life--the way those two bustled about-- and the quantityof things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings andfastening buttons--`Really they\u0027ll be more like bundles of old clothes thatanything else, by the time they\u0027re ready!\u0027 she said to herself, as shearranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, `to keep his head frombeing cut off,\u0027 as he said.\\n\\n 　　`You know,\u0027 he added very gravely, `it\u0027s one of the most seriousthings that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get one\u0027s head cutoff.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, forfear of hurting his feelings.\\n\\n 　　`Do I look very pale?\u0027 said Tweedledum, coming up to have hishelmet tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly lookedmuch more like a saucepan.)`Well--yes--a LITTLE,\u0027 Alice replied gently.\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m very brave generally,\u0027 he went on in a low voice: `only to-dayI happen to have a headache.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And I\u0027VE got a toothache!\u0027 said Tweedledee, who had overheardthe remark. `I\u0027m far worse off than you!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Then you\u0027d better not fight to-day,\u0027 said Alice, thinking it a goodopportunity to make peace.\\n\\n 　　`We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don\u0027t care about going onlong,\u0027 said Tweedledum. `What\u0027s the time now?\u0027\\n\\n 　　Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said `Half-past four.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Let\u0027s fight till six, and then have dinner,\u0027 said Tweedledum.\\n\\n 　　`Very well,\u0027 the other said, rather sadly: `and SHE can watch us-only you\u0027d better not come VERY close,\u0027 he added: `I generally hiteverything I can see--when I get really excited.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And _I_ hit everything within reach,\u0027 cried Tweedledum, `whether Ican see it or not!\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice laughed. `You must hit the TREES pretty often, I shouldthink,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n 　　Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. `I don\u0027tsuppose,\u0027 he said, `there\u0027ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, bythe time we\u0027ve finished!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And all about a rattle!\u0027 said Alice, still hoping to make them aLITTLE ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.\\n\\n 　　`I shouldn\u0027t have minded it so much,\u0027 said Tweedledum, `if it hadn\u0027tbeen a new one.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I wish the monstrous crow would come!\u0027 though Alice.\\n\\n 　　`There\u0027s only one sword, you know,\u0027 Tweedledum said to his brother:\\n\\n 　　`but you can have the umbrella--it\u0027s quite as sharp. Only we must beginquick. It\u0027s getting as dark as it can.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And darker.\u0027 said Tweedledee.\\n\\n 　　It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be athunderstorm coming on. `What a thick black cloud that is!\u0027 she said.\\n\\n 　　`And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it\u0027s got wings!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s the crow!\u0027 Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm:\\n\\n 　　and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.\\n\\n 　　Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.\\n\\n 　　`It can never get at me HERE,\u0027 she thought: `it\u0027s far too large to squeezeitself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn\u0027t flap its wings so--itmakes quite a hurricane in the wood-- here\u0027s somebody\u0027s shawl beingblown away!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/308.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
