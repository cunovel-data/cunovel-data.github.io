{"id":37310,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6 Humpty Dumpty","content":"However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and morehuman: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it hadeyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she sawclearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. `It can\u0027t be anybodyelse!\u0027 she said to herself. `I\u0027m as certain of it, as if his name were writtenall over his face.\u0027\\n\\n 　　It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormousface. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, onthe top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered howhe could keep his balance--and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in theopposite direction, and he didn\u0027t take the least notice of her, she thought hemust be a stuffed figure after all.\\n\\n 　　`And how exactly like an egg he is!\u0027 she said aloud, standing withher hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him tofall.\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s VERY provoking,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence,looking away from Alice as he spoke, `to be called an egg-- VERY!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir,\u0027 Alice gently explained. `Andsome eggs are very pretty, you know\u0027 she added, hoping to turn her remarkinto a sort of a compliment.\\n\\n 　　`Some people,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her asusual, `have no more sense than a baby!\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice didn\u0027t know what to say to this: it wasn\u0027t at all likeconversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact, hislast remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and softlyrepeated to herself: -`Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:\\n\\n 　　Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King\u0027s horses andall the King\u0027s men Couldn\u0027t put Humpty Dumpty in hisplace again.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`That last line is much too long for the poetry,\u0027 she added, almost out loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.\\n\\n 　　`Don\u0027t stand there chattering to yourself like that,\u0027 Humpty Dumptysaid, looking at her for the first time, `but tell me your name and yourbusiness.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`My NAME is Alice, but--\u0027\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s a stupid enough name!\u0027 Humpty Dumpty interruptedimpatiently. `What does it mean?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`MUST a name mean something?\u0027 Alice asked doubtfully.\\n\\n 　　`Of course it must,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: `MYname means the shape I am--and a good handsome shape it is, too. Witha name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Why do you sit out here all alone?\u0027 said Alice, not wishing to beginan argument.\\n\\n 　　`Why, because there\u0027s nobody with me!\u0027 cried Humpty Dumpty.\\n\\n 　　`Did you think I didn\u0027t know the answer to THAT? Ask another.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Don\u0027t you think you\u0027d be safer down on the ground?\u0027 Alice went on,not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-naturedanxiety for the queer creature. `That wall is so VERY narrow!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`What tremendously easy riddles you ask!\u0027 Humpty Dumptygrowled out. `Of course I don\u0027t think so! Why, if ever I DID fall off-which there\u0027s no chance of--but IF I did--\u0027 Here he pursed his lips andlooked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. `IF Idid fall,\u0027 he went on, `THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--WITH HISVERY OWN MOUTH--to--to--\u0027\\n\\n 　　`To send all his horses and all his men,\u0027 Alice interrupted, ratherunwisely.\\n\\n 　　`Now I declare that\u0027s too bad!\u0027 Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking intoa sudden passion. `You\u0027ve been listening at doors--and behind trees-- anddown chimneys--or you couldn\u0027t have known it!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I haven\u0027t, indeed!\u0027 Alice said very gently. `It\u0027s in a book.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Ah, well! They may write such things in a BOOK,\u0027 HumptyDumpty said in a calmer tone. `That\u0027s what you call a History ofEngland, that is. Now, take a good look at me! I\u0027m one that has spokento a King, _I_ am: mayhap you\u0027ll never see such another: and to show you I\u0027m not proud, you may shake hands with me!\u0027 And he grinnedalmost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fellof the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him alittle anxiously as she took it. `If he smiled much more, the ends of hismouth might meet behind,\u0027 she thought: `and then I don\u0027t know whatwould happen to his head! I\u0027m afraid it would come off!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Yes, all his horses and all his men,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty went on.\\n\\n 　　`They\u0027d pick me up again in a minute, THEY would! However, thisconversation is going on a little too fast: let\u0027s go back to the last remarkbut one.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t quite remember it,\u0027 Alice said very politely.\\n\\n 　　`In that case we start fresh,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty, `and it\u0027s my turnto choose a subject--\u0027 (`He talks about it just as if it was a game!\u0027 thoughtAlice.) `So here\u0027s a question for you. How old did you say you were?\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice made a short calculation, and said `Seven years and sixmonths.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Wrong!\u0027 Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. `You neversaid a word like it!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I though you meant \"How old ARE you?\"\u0027 Alice explained.\\n\\n 　　`If I\u0027d meant that, I\u0027d have said it,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty.\\n\\n 　　Alice didn\u0027t want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.\\n\\n 　　`Seven years and six months!\u0027 Humpty Dumpty repeatedthoughtfully. `An uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you\u0027d asked MYadvice, I\u0027d have said \"Leave off at seven\"--but it\u0027s too late now.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I never ask advice about growing,\u0027 Alice said indignantly.\\n\\n 　　`Too proud?\u0027 the other inquired.\\n\\n 　　Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. `I mean,\u0027 shesaid, `that one can\u0027t help growing older.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`ONE can\u0027t, perhaps,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty, `but TWO can. Withproper assistance, you might have left off at seven.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`What a beautiful belt you\u0027ve got on!\u0027 Alice suddenly remarked.\\n\\n 　　(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and ifthey really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.)`At least,\u0027 she corrected herself on second thoughts, `a beautiful cravat, I should have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon!\u0027 she added indismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she beganto wish she hadn\u0027t chosen that subject. `If I only knew,\u0027 the thought toherself, \u0027which was neck and which was waist!\u0027\\n\\n 　　Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothingfor a minute or two. When he DID speak again, it was in a deep growl.\\n\\n 　　`It is a--MOST--PROVOKING--thing,\u0027 he said at last, `when aperson doesn\u0027t know a cravat from a belt!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I know it\u0027s very ignorant of me,\u0027 Alice said, in so humble a tone thatHumpty Dumpty relented.\\n\\n 　　`It\u0027s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It\u0027s a presentfrom the White King and Queen. There now!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Is it really?\u0027 said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen agood subject, after all.\\n\\n 　　`They gave it me,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as hecrossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, `they gaveit me--for an un-birthday present.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I beg your pardon?\u0027 Alice said with a puzzled air.\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m not offended,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty.\\n\\n 　　`I mean, what IS an un-birthday present?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`A present given when it isn\u0027t your birthday, of course.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice considered a little. `I like birthday presents best,\u0027 she said atlast.\\n\\n 　　`You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about!\u0027 cried Humpty Dumpty.\\n\\n 　　`How many days are there in a year?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Three hundred and sixty-five,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`And how many birthdays have you?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`One.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, whatremains?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. `I\u0027d rather see that done onpaper,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n 　　Alice couldn\u0027t help smiling as she took out her memorandum- book,48 THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASSand worked the sum for him:\\n\\n 　　365 1 ___364 ___Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. `Thatseems to be done right--\u0027 he began.\\n\\n 　　`You\u0027re holding it upside down!\u0027 Alice interrupted.\\n\\n 　　`To be sure I was!\u0027 Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned itround for him. `I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, thatSEEMS to be done right--though I haven\u0027t time to look it over thoroughlyjust now--and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four dayswhen you might get un-birthday presents--\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Certainly,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`And only ONE for birthday presents, you know. There\u0027s glory foryou!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I don\u0027t know what you mean by \"glory,\"\u0027 Alice said.\\n\\n 　　Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. `Of course you don\u0027t-till I tell you. I meant \"there\u0027s a nice knock-down argument for you!\"\u0027\\n\\n 　　`But \"glory\" doesn\u0027t mean \"a nice knock-down argument,\"\u0027 Aliceobjected.\\n\\n 　　`When _I_ use a word,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornfultone, `it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`The question is,\u0027 said Alice, `whether you CAN make words meanso many different things.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`The question is,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master-that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minuteHumpty Dumpty began again. `They\u0027ve a temper, some of them-particularly verbs, they\u0027re the proudest--adjectives you can do anythingwith, but not verbs--however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them!\\n\\n 　　Impenetrability! That\u0027s what _I_ say!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Would you tell me, please,\u0027 said Alice `what that means?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Now you talk like a reasonable child,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty,looking very much pleased. `I meant by \"impenetrability\" that we\u0027ve hadenough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you\u0027d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don\u0027t mean to stop here all the restof your life.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`That\u0027s a great deal to make one word mean,\u0027 Alice said in athoughtful tone.\\n\\n 　　`When I make a word do a lot of work like that,\u0027 said HumptyDumpty, `I always pay it extra.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Oh!\u0027 said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any otherremark.\\n\\n 　　`Ah, you should see \u0027em come round me of a Saturday night,\u0027\\n\\n 　　Humpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side:\\n\\n 　　`for to get their wages, you know.\u0027\\n\\n 　　(Alice didn\u0027t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see Ican\u0027t tell YOU.)`You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,\u0027 said Alice. `Wouldyou kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called \"Jabberwocky\"?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Let\u0027s hear it,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty. `I can explain all the poemsthat were ever invented--and a good many that haven\u0027t been invented justyet.\u0027\\n\\n 　　This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:\\n\\n 　　\u0027Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Didgyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were theborogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.\\n\\n 　　`That\u0027s enough to begin with,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty interrupted: `thereare plenty of hard words there. \"BRILLIG\" means four o\u0027clock in theafternoon--the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`That\u0027ll do very well,\u0027 said Alice: and \"SLITHY\"?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Well, \"SLITHY\" means \"lithe and slimy.\" \"Lithe\" is the same as\"active.\" You see it\u0027s like a portmanteau--there are two meanings packedup into one word.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I see it now,\u0027 Alice remarked thoughtfully: `and what are\"TOVES\"?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Well, \"TOVES\" are something like badgers--they\u0027re something likelizards--and they\u0027re something like corkscrews.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`They must be very curious looking creatures.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`They are that,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty: `also they make their nestsunder sun-dials--also they live on cheese.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Andy what\u0027s the \"GYRE\" and to \"GIMBLE\"?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`To \"GYRE\" is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To\"GIMBLE\" is to make holes like a gimlet.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And \"THE WABE\" is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?\u0027\\n\\n 　　said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.\\n\\n 　　`Of course it is. It\u0027s called \"WABE,\" you know, because it goes along way before it, and a long way behind it--\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And a long way beyond it on each side,\u0027 Alice added.\\n\\n 　　`Exactly so. Well, then, \"MIMSY\" is \"flimsy and miserable\"(there\u0027s another portmanteau for you). And a \"BOROGOVE\" is a thinshabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round-- somethinglike a live mop.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And then \"MOME RATHS\"?\u0027 said Alice. `I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m givingyou a great deal of trouble.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Well, a \"RATH\" is a sort of green pig: but \"MOME\" I\u0027m notcertain about. I think it\u0027s short for \"from home\"--meaning that they\u0027d losttheir way, you know.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`And what does \"OUTGRABE\" mean?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Well, \"OUTGRABING\" is something between bellowing andwhistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you\u0027ll hear itdone, maybe--down in the wood yonder--and when you\u0027ve once heard ityou\u0027ll be QUITE content. Who\u0027s been repeating all that hard stuff toyou?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I read it in a book,\u0027 said Alice. `But I had some poetry repeated tome, much easier than that, by--Tweedledee, I think it was.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`As to poetry, you know,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out oneof his great hands, `_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comesto that--\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Oh, it needn\u0027t come to that!\u0027 Alice hastily said, hoping to keep himfrom beginning.\\n\\n 　　`The piece I\u0027m going to repeat,\u0027 he went on without noticing herremark,\u0027 was written entirely for your amusement.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it, so shesat down, and said `Thank you\u0027 rather sadly.\\n\\n 　　`In winter, when the fields are white,sing this song for your delight-only I don\u0027t sing it,\u0027 he added, as an explanation.\\n\\n 　　`I see you don\u0027t,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`If you can SEE whether I\u0027m singing or not, you\u0027ve sharper eyesthan most.\u0027 Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.\\n\\n 　　`In spring, when woods are getting green,I\u0027ll try and tell you what I mean.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`Thank you very much,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`In summer, when the days are long,Perhaps you\u0027ll understand the song: In autumn, when theleaves are brown, Take pen and ink, and write it down.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I will, if I can remember it so long,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`You needn\u0027t go on making remarks like that,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty said:\\n\\n 　　`they\u0027re not sensible, and they put me out.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I sent a message to the fish: I told them\"This is what I wish.\"The little fishes of the sea, They sent ananswer back to me.\\n\\n 　　The little fishes\u0027 answer was \"We cannotdo it, Sir, because--\"\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t quite understand,\u0027 said Alice.\\n\\n 　　`It gets easier further on,\u0027 Humpty Dumpty replied.\\n\\n 　　`I sent to them again to say \"It will bebetter to obey.\"The fishes answered with a grin, \"Why,what a temper you are in!\"I told them once, I told them twice:\\n\\n 　　They would not listen to advice.\\n\\n 　　I took a kettle large and new, Fit for thedeed I had to do.\\n\\n 　　My heart went hop, my heart went thump;I filled the kettle at the pump.\\n\\n 　　Then some one came to me and said,\"The little fishes are in bed.\"I said to him, Imust wake them up again.\"I said it very loshouted in his ear.\u0027\\n\\n 　　said it plain,ud and clear;\"Then youI went andHumpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeatedthis verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, `I wouldn\u0027t have been themessenger for ANYTHING!\u0027\\n\\n 　　`But he was very stiff and proud; Hesaid \"You needn\u0027t shout so loud!\"And he was very proud and stiff; Hesaid \"I\u0027d go and wake them, if--\"I took a corkscrew from the shelf: Iwent to wake them up myself.\\n\\n 　　And when I found the door was locked,I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.\\n\\n 　　And when I found the door was shut, Itried to turn the handle, but--\u0027\\n\\n 　　There was a long pause.\\n\\n 　　`Is that all?\u0027 Alice timidly asked.\\n\\n 　　`That\u0027s all,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty. `Good-bye.\u0027\\n\\n 　　This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERYstrong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civilto stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. `Good-bye, till we meetagain!\u0027 she said as cheerfully as she could.\\n\\n 　　`I shouldn\u0027t know you again if we DID meet,\u0027 Humpty Dumptyreplied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake;`you\u0027re so exactly like other people.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`The face is what one goes by, generally,\u0027 Alice remarked in athoughtful tone.\\n\\n 　　`That\u0027s just what I complain of,\u0027 said Humpty Dumpty. `Your faceis the same as everybody has--the two eyes, so--\u0027 (marking their places in the air with this thumb) `nose in the middle, mouth under. It\u0027s always thesame. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, forinstance--or the mouth at the top--that would be SOME help.\u0027\\n\\n 　　`It wouldn\u0027t look nice,\u0027 Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty onlyshut his eyes and said `Wait till you\u0027ve tried.\u0027\\n\\n 　　Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as henever opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said `Goodbye!\u0027 once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:\\n\\n 　　but she couldn\u0027t help saying to herself as she went, `Of all theunsatisfactory--\u0027 (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to havesuch a long word to say) `of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER met--\u0027\\n\\n 　　She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shookthe forest from end to end.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/310.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
