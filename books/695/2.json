{"id":37306,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2 The Garden of Live Flowers","content":"`I should see the garden far better,\u0027 said Alice to herself, `if I couldget to the top of that hill: and here\u0027s a path that leads straight to it--atleast, no, it doesn\u0027t do that--\u0027 (after going a few yards along the path, andturning several sharp corners), `but I suppose it will at last. But howcuriously it twists! It\u0027s more like a corkscrew than a path! Well, THISturn goes to the hill, I suppose--no, it doesn\u0027t! This goes straight back tothe house! Well then, I\u0027ll try it the other way.\u0027 　　And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn,but always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once,when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against itbefore she could stop herself. 　　`It\u0027s no use talking about it,\u0027 Alice said, looking up at the house andpretending it was arguing with her. `I\u0027m NOT going in again yet. Iknow I should have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into theold room--and there\u0027d be an end of all my adventures!\u0027 　　So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out oncemore down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. 　　For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, `I reallySHALL do it this time--\u0027 when the path gave a sudden twist and shookitself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she foundherself actually walking in at the door. 　　\u0027Oh, it\u0027s too bad!\u0027 she cried. `I never saw such a house for gettingin the way! Never!\u0027 　　However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to bedone but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with aborder of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle. 　　`O Tiger-lily,\u0027 said Alice, addressing herself to one that was wavinggracefully about in the wind, `I WISH you could talk!\u0027 　　`We CAN talk,\u0027 said the Tiger-lily: `when there\u0027s anybody worthtalking to.\u0027 　　Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily onlywent on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in awhisper. `And can ALL the flowers talk?\u0027 　　`As well as YOU can,\u0027 said the Tiger-lily. `And a great deallouder.\u0027 　　`It isn\u0027t manners for us to begin, you know,\u0027 said the Rose, `and Ireally was wondering when you\u0027d speak! Said I to myself, \"Her face hasgot SOME sense in it, thought it\u0027s not a clever one!\" Still, you\u0027re theright colour, and that goes a long way.\u0027 　　`I don\u0027t care about the colour,\u0027 the Tiger-lily remarked. `If only herpetals curled up a little more, she\u0027d be all right.\u0027 　　Alice didn\u0027t like being criticised, so she began asking questions. 　　`Aren\u0027t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobodyto take care of you?\u0027 　　`There\u0027s the tree in the middle,\u0027 said the Rose: `what else is it goodfor?\u0027 　　`But what could it do, if any danger came?\u0027 Alice asked. 　　`It says \"Bough-wough!\" cried a Daisy: `that\u0027s why its branchesare called boughs!\u0027 　　`Didn\u0027t you know THAT?\u0027 cried another Daisy, and here they allbegan shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. 　　`Silence, every one of you!\u0027 cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself passionatelyfrom side to side, and trembling with excitement. `They know I can\u0027t getat them!\u0027 it panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice, `or theywouldn\u0027t dare to do it!\u0027 　　`Never mind!\u0027 Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down tothe daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, `If you don\u0027thold your tongues, I\u0027ll pick you!\u0027 　　There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisiesturned white. 　　`That\u0027s right!\u0027 said the Tiger-lily. `The daisies are worst of all. 　　When one speaks, they all begin together, and it\u0027s enough to make onewither to hear the way they go on!\u0027 　　`How is it you can all talk so nicely?\u0027 Alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. `I\u0027ve been in many gardens before, butnone of the flowers could talk.\u0027 　　`Put your hand down, and feel the ground,\u0027 said the Tiger-lily. `Thenyou\u0027ll know why. 　　Alice did so. `It\u0027s very hard,\u0027 she said, `but I don\u0027t see what that hasto do with it.\u0027 　　`In most gardens,\u0027 the Tiger-lily said, `they make the beds too soft-so that the flowers are always asleep.\u0027 　　This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased toknow it. `I never thought of that before!\u0027 she said. 　　`It\u0027s MY opinion that you never think AT ALL,\u0027 the Rose said in arather severe tone. 　　`I never saw anybody that looked stupider,\u0027 a Violet said, sosuddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn\u0027t spoken before. 　　`Hold YOUR tongue!\u0027 cried the Tiger-lily. `As if YOU ever sawanybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there,till you know no more what\u0027s going on in the world, than if you were abud!\u0027 　　`Are there any more people in the garden besides me?\u0027 Alice said,not choosing to notice the Rose\u0027s last remark. 　　`There\u0027s one other flower in the garden that can move about likeyou,\u0027 said the Rose. `I wonder how you do it--\u0027 (`You\u0027re alwayswondering,\u0027 said the Tiger-lily), `but she\u0027s more bushy than you are.\u0027 　　`Is she like me?\u0027 Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed hermind, `There\u0027s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!\u0027 　　`Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,\u0027 the Rose said, `butshe\u0027s redder--and her petals are shorter, I think.\u0027 　　`Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,\u0027 the Tiger-lilyinterrupted: `not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.\u0027 　　`But that\u0027s not YOUR fault,\u0027 the Rose added kindly: `you\u0027rebeginning to fade, you know--and then one can\u0027t help one\u0027s petals getting alittle untidy.\u0027 　　Alice didn\u0027t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, sheasked `Does she ever come out here?\u0027 　　`I daresay you\u0027ll see her soon,\u0027 said the Rose. `She\u0027s one of thethorny kind.\u0027 　　`Where does she wear the thorns?\u0027 Alice asked with some curiosity. 　　`Why all round her head, of course,\u0027 the Rose replied. `I waswondering YOU hadn\u0027t got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.\u0027 　　`She\u0027s coming!\u0027 cried the Larkspur. `I hear her footstep, thump,thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!\u0027 　　Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. 　　`She\u0027s grown a good deal!\u0027 was her first remark. She had indeed: whenAlice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--andhere she was, half a head taller than Alice herself! 　　`It\u0027s the fresh air that does it,\u0027 said the Rose: `wonderfully fine air itis, out here.\u0027 　　`I think I\u0027ll go and meet her,\u0027 said Alice, for, though the flowers wereinteresting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk witha real Queen. 　　`You can\u0027t possibly do that,\u0027 said the Rose: `_I_ should advise youto walk the other way.\u0027 　　This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off atonce towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in amoment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again. 　　A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere forthe queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought shewould try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction. 　　It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minutebefore she found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sightof the hill she had been so long aiming at. 　　`Where do you come from?\u0027 said the Red Queen. `And where areyou going? Look up, speak nicely, and don\u0027t twiddle your fingers all thetime.\u0027 　　Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as shecould, that she had lost her way. 　　`I don\u0027t know what you mean by YOUR way,\u0027 said the Queen: `allthe ways about here belong to ME--but why did you come out here at all?\u0027 she added in a kinder tone. `Curtsey while you\u0027re thinking what to say, itsaves time.\u0027 　　Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of theQueen to disbelieve it. `I\u0027ll try it when I go home,\u0027 she thought to herself. 　　`the next time I\u0027m a little late for dinner.\u0027 　　`It\u0027s time for you to answer now,\u0027 the Queen said, looking at herwatch: `open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak, and alwayssay \"your Majesty.\"\u0027 　　`I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty--\u0027 　　`That\u0027s right,\u0027 said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alicedidn\u0027t like at all, `though, when you say \"garden,\"--I\u0027VE seen gardens,compared with which this would be a wilderness.\u0027 　　Alice didn\u0027t dare to argue the point, but went on: `--and I thought I\u0027dtry and find my way to the top of that hill--\u0027 　　`When you say \"hill,\"\u0027 the Queen interrupted, `_I_ could show youhills, in comparison with which you\u0027d call that a valley.\u0027 　　`No, I shouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: 　　`a hill CAN\u0027T be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense--\u0027 　　The Red Queen shook her head, `You may call it \"nonsense\" if youlike,\u0027 she said, `but I\u0027VE heard nonsense, compared with which that wouldbe as sensible as a dictionary!\u0027 　　Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen\u0027s tone thatshe was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they gotto the top of the little hill. 　　For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in alldirections over the country--and a most curious country it was. Therewere a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side toside, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number oflittle green hedges, that reached from brook to brook. 　　`I declare it\u0027s marked out just like a large chessboard!\u0027 Alice said atlast. `There ought to be some men moving about somewhere --and sothere are!\u0027 She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quickwith excitement as she went on. `It\u0027s a great huge game of chess that\u0027sbeing played--all over the world--if this IS the world at all, you know. 　　Oh, what fun it is! How I WISH I was one of them! I wouldn\u0027t mindbeing a Pawn, if only I might join--though of course I should LIKE to be aQueen, best.\u0027 　　She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but hercompanion only smiled pleasantly, and said, `That\u0027s easily managed. Youcan be the White Queen\u0027s Pawn, if you like, as Lily\u0027s too young to play;and you\u0027re in the Second Square to began with: when you get to theEighth Square you\u0027ll be a Queen --\u0027 Just at this moment, somehow orother, they began to run. 　　Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards,how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were runninghand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do tokeep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying `Faster! Faster!\u0027 butAlice felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left tosay so. 　　The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the otherthings round them never changed their places at all: however fast theywent, they never seemed to pass anything. `I wonder if all the thingsmove along with us?\u0027 thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queenseemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, `Faster! Don\u0027t try to talk!\u0027 　　Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT. She felt as if shewould never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: 　　and still the Queen cried `Faster! Faster!\u0027 and dragged her along. `Arewe nearly there?\u0027 Alice managed to pant out at last. 　　`Nearly there!\u0027 the Queen repeated. `Why, we passed it tenminutes ago! Faster!\u0027 And they ran on for a time in silence, with thewind whistling in Alice\u0027s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head,she fancied. 　　`Now! Now!\u0027 cried the Queen. `Faster! Faster!\u0027 And theywent so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardlytouching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was gettingquite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,breathless and giddy. 　　The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, `You may rest a little now.\u0027 　　Alice looked round her in great surprise. `Why, I do believe we\u0027vebeen under this tree the whole time! Everything\u0027s just as it was!\u0027 　　`Of course it is,\u0027 said the Queen, `what would you have it?\u0027 　　`Well, in OUR country,\u0027 said Alice, still panting a little, `you\u0027d generallyget to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time, as we\u0027ve beendoing.\u0027 　　`A slow sort of country!\u0027 said the Queen. `Now, HERE, you see, ittakes all the running YOU can do, to keep in the same place. If you wantto get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\u0027 　　`I\u0027d rather not try, please!\u0027 said Alice. `I\u0027m quite content to stayhere--only I AM so hot and thirsty!\u0027 　　`I know what YOU\u0027D like!\u0027 the Queen said good-naturedly, taking alittle box out of her pocket. `Have a biscuit?\u0027 　　Alice thought it would not be civil to say `No,\u0027 though it wasn\u0027t at allwhat she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and itwas VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked inall her life. 　　`While you\u0027re refreshing yourself,\u0027 said the Queen, `I\u0027ll just take themeasurements.\u0027 And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked ininches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in hereand there. 　　`At the end of two yards,\u0027 she said, putting in a peg to mark thedistance, `I shall give you your directions--have another biscuit?\u0027 　　`No, thank you,\u0027 said Alice,: `one\u0027s QUITE enough!\u0027 　　`Thirst quenched, I hope?\u0027 said the Queen. 　　Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did notwait for an answer, but went on. `At the end of THREE yards I shallrepeat them--for fear of your forgetting them. At then end of FOUR, Ishall say good-bye. And at then end of FIVE, I shall go!\u0027 　　She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked onwith great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowlywalking down the row. 　　At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, `A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you\u0027ll go VERY quickly throughthe Third Square--by railway, I should think--and you\u0027ll find yourself inthe Fourth Square in no time. Well, THAT square belongs toTweedledum and Tweedledee--the Fifth is mostly water--the Sixth belongsto Humpty Dumpty--But you make no remark?\u0027 　　`I--I didn\u0027t know I had to make one--just then,\u0027 Alice faltered out. 　　`You SHOULD have said,\u0027 `\"It\u0027s extremely kind of you to tell me allthis\"--however, we\u0027ll suppose it said--the Seventh Square is all forest-however, one of the Knights will show you the way--and in the EighthSquare we shall be Queens together, and it\u0027s all feasting and fun!\u0027 Alicegot up and curtseyed, and sat down again. 　　At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said,`Speak in French when you can\u0027t think of the English for a thing --turn outyour toes as you walk--and remember who you are!\u0027 She did not wait forAlice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, whereshe turned for a moment to say `good-bye,\u0027 and then hurried on to the last. 　　How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to thelast peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether sheran quickly into the wood (`and she CAN run very fast!\u0027 thought Alice),there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began toremember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her tomove.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/306.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
