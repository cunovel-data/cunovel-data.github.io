{"id":37309,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 Wool and Water","content":"She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner:\n 　　in another moment the White Queen came running wildly through thewood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alicevery civilly went to meet her with the shawl.\n 　　`I\u0027m very glad I happened to be in the way,\u0027 Alice said, as she helpedher to put on her shawl again.\n 　　The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort ofway, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that soundedlike `bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,\u0027 and Alice felt that if there was tobe any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she beganrather timidly: `Am I addressing the White Queen?\u0027\n 　　`Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,\u0027 The Queen said. `It isn\u0027tMY notion of the thing, at all.\u0027\n 　　Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the verybeginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, `If your Majestywill only tell me the right way to begin, I\u0027ll do it as well as I can.\u0027\n 　　`But I don\u0027t want it done at all!\u0027 groaned the poor Queen. `I\u0027ve beena-dressing myself for the last two hours.\u0027\n 　　It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she hadgot some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. `Everysingle thing\u0027s crooked,\u0027 Alice thought to herself, `and she\u0027s all over pins!-may I put your shawl straight for you?\u0027 she added aloud.\n 　　`I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with it!\u0027 the Queen said, in amelancholy voice. `It\u0027s out of temper, I think. I\u0027ve pinned it here, andI\u0027ve pinned it there, but there\u0027s no pleasing it!\u0027\n 　　`It CAN\u0027T go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,\u0027 Alicesaid, as she gently put it right for her; `and, dear me, what a state your hairis in!\u0027\n 　　`The brush has got entangled in it!\u0027 the Queen said with a sigh.\n 　　`And I lost the comb yesterday.\u0027\n 　　Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair into order. `Come, you look rather better now!\u0027 she said, after alteringmost of the pins. `But really you should have a lady\u0027s maid!\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll take you with pleasure!\u0027 the Queen said. `Twopence aweek, and jam every other day.\u0027\n 　　Alice couldn\u0027t help laughing, as she said, `I don\u0027t want you to hireME--and I don\u0027t care for jam.\u0027\n 　　`It\u0027s very good jam,\u0027 said the Queen.\n 　　`Well, I don\u0027t want any TO-DAY, at any rate.\u0027\n 　　`You couldn\u0027t have it if you DID want it,\u0027 the Queen said. `The ruleis, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day.\u0027\n 　　`It MUST come sometimes to \"jam to-day,\"\u0027 Alice objected.\n 　　`No, it can\u0027t,\u0027 said the Queen. `It\u0027s jam every OTHER day: to-dayisn\u0027t any OTHER day, you know.\u0027\n 　　`I don\u0027t understand you,\u0027 said Alice. `It\u0027s dreadfully confusing!\u0027\n 　　`That\u0027s the effect of living backwards,\u0027 the Queen said kindly: `italways makes one a little giddy at first--\u0027\n 　　`Living backwards!\u0027 Alice repeated in great astonishment. `I neverheard of such a thing!\u0027\n 　　`--but there\u0027s one great advantage in it, that one\u0027s memory worksboth ways.\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027m sure MINE only works one way.\u0027 Alice remarked. `I can\u0027tremember things before they happen.\u0027\n 　　`It\u0027s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,\u0027 the Queenremarked.\n 　　`What sort of things do YOU remember best?\u0027 Alice ventured to ask.\n 　　`Oh, things that happened the week after next,\u0027 the Queen replied ina careless tone. `For instance, now,\u0027 she went on, sticking a large piece ofplaster [band-aid] on her finger as she spoke, `there\u0027s the King\u0027sMessenger. He\u0027s in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn\u0027teven begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.\u0027\n 　　`Suppose he never commits the crime?\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`That would be all the better, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 the Queen said, as shebound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.\n 　　Alice felt there was no denying THAT. `Of course it would be all the better,\u0027 she said: `but it wouldn\u0027t be all the better his being punished.\u0027\n 　　`You\u0027re wrong THERE, at any rate,\u0027 said the Queen: `were YOUever punished?\u0027\n 　　`Only for faults,\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`And you were all the better for it, I know!\u0027 the Queen saidtriumphantly.\n 　　`Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for,\u0027 said Alice:\n 　　`that makes all the difference.\u0027\n 　　`But if you HADN\u0027T done them,\u0027 the Queen said, `that would havebeen better still; better, and better, and better!\u0027 Her voice went higherwith each `better,\u0027 till it got quite to a squeak at last.\n 　　Alice was just beginning to say `There\u0027s a mistake somewhere--,\u0027\n 　　when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave thesentence unfinished. `Oh, oh, oh!\u0027 shouted the Queen, shaking her handabout as if she wanted to shake it off. `My finger\u0027s bleeding! Oh, oh, oh,oh!\u0027\n 　　Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, thatAlice had to hold both her hands over her ears.\n 　　`What IS the matter?\u0027 she said, as soon as there was a chance ofmaking herself heard. `Have you pricked your finger?\u0027\n 　　`I haven\u0027t pricked it YET,\u0027 the Queen said, `but I soon shall-- oh, oh,oh!\u0027\n 　　`When do you expect to do it?\u0027 Alice asked, feeling very muchinclined to laugh.\n 　　`When I fasten my shawl again,\u0027 the poor Queen groaned out: `thebrooch will come undone directly. Oh, oh!\u0027 As she said the words thebrooch flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp itagain.\n 　　`Take care!\u0027 cried Alice. `You\u0027re holding it all crooked!\u0027 And shecaught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and theQueen had pricked her finger.\n 　　`That accounts for the bleeding, you see,\u0027 she said to Alice with asmile. `Now you understand the way things happen here.\u0027\n 　　`But why don\u0027t you scream now?\u0027 Alice asked, holding her hands ready to put over her ears again.\n 　　`Why, I\u0027ve done all the screaming already,\u0027 said the Queen. `Whatwould be the good of having it all over again?\u0027\n 　　By this time it was getting light. `The crow must have flown away,I think,\u0027 said Alice: `I\u0027m so glad it\u0027s gone. I thought it was the nightcoming on.\u0027\n 　　`I wish _I_ could manage to be glad!\u0027 the Queen said. `Only Inever can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in thiswood, and being glad whenever you like!\u0027\n 　　`Only it is so VERY lonely here!\u0027 Alice said in a melancholy voice;and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down hercheeks.\n 　　`Oh, don\u0027t go on like that!\u0027 cried the poor Queen, wringing her handsin despair. `Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a longway you\u0027ve come to-day. Consider what o\u0027clock it is. Consider anything,only don\u0027t cry!\u0027\n 　　Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.\n 　　`Can YOU keep from crying by considering things?\u0027 she asked.\n 　　`That\u0027s the way it\u0027s done,\u0027 the Queen said with great decision: `nobody cando two things at once, you know. Let\u0027s consider your age to begin with-how old are you?\u0027\n 　　`I\u0027m seven and a half exactly.\u0027\n 　　`You needn\u0027t say \"exactually,\"\u0027 the Queen remarked: `I can believeit without that. Now I\u0027ll give YOU something to believe. I\u0027m just onehundred and one, five months and a day.\u0027\n 　　`I can\u0027t believe THAT!\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`Can\u0027t you?\u0027 the Queen said in a pitying tone. `Try again: draw along breath, and shut your eyes.\u0027\n 　　Alice laughed. `There\u0027s no use trying,\u0027 she said: `one CAN\u0027Tbelieve impossible things.\u0027\n 　　`I daresay you haven\u0027t had much practice,\u0027 said the Queen. `When Iwas your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I\u0027vebelieved as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goesthe shawl again!\u0027\n 　　The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust ofwind blew the Queen\u0027s shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread outher arms again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded incatching it for herself. `I\u0027ve got it!\u0027 she cried in a triumphant tone.\n 　　`Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!\u0027\n 　　`Then I hope your finger is better now?\u0027 Alice said very politely, asshe crossed the little brook after the Queen.\n 　　* * * * * * ** * * * * ** * * * * * *`Oh, much better!\u0027 cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak asshe went on. `Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!\u0027 Thelast word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.\n 　　She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrappedherself up in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn\u0027tmake out what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was thatreally--was it really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of thecounter? Rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she wasin a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and oppositeto her was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every nowand then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.\n 　　`What is it you want to buy?\u0027 the Sheep said at last, looking up for amoment from her knitting.\n 　　`I don\u0027t QUITE know yet,\u0027 Alice said, very gently. `I should like tolook all round me first, if I might.\u0027\n 　　`You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,\u0027 saidthe Sheep: `but you can\u0027t look ALL round you--unless you\u0027ve got eyes atthe back of your head.\u0027\n 　　But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contentedherself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.\n 　　The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things-- but theoddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, tomake out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quiteempty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.\n 　　`Things flow about so here!\u0027 she said at last in a plaintive tone, aftershe had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing, thatlooked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and wasalways in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. `And this oneis the most provoking of all--but I\u0027ll tell you what--\u0027 she added, as a suddenthought struck her, `I\u0027ll follow it up to the very top shelf of all. It\u0027llpuzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!\u0027\n 　　But even this plan failed: the `thing\u0027 went through the ceiling asquietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.\n 　　`Are you a child or a teetotum?\u0027 the Sheep said, as she took upanother pair of needles. `You\u0027ll make me giddy soon, if you go onturning round like that.\u0027 She was now working with fourteen pairs atonce, and Alice couldn\u0027t help looking at her in great astonishment.\n 　　`How CAN she knit with so many?\u0027 the puzzled child thought toherself. `She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!\u0027\n 　　`Can you row?\u0027 the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles as she spoke.\n 　　`Yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--\u0027 Alice wasbeginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands,and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between banks: sothere was nothing for it but to do her best.\n 　　`Feather!\u0027 cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.\n 　　This didn\u0027t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alicesaid nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about thewater, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and wouldhardly come out again.\n 　　`Feather! Feather!\u0027 the Sheep cried again, taking more needles.\n 　　`You\u0027ll be catching a crab directly.\u0027\n 　　`A dear little crab!\u0027 thought Alice. `I should like that.\u0027\n 　　`Didn\u0027t you hear me say \"Feather\"?\u0027 the Sheep cried angrily, takingup quite a bunch of needles.\n 　　`Indeed I did,\u0027 said Alice: `you\u0027ve said it very often--and very loud.\n 　　Please, where ARE the crabs?\u0027\n 　　`In the water, of course!\u0027 said the Sheep, sticking some of theneedles into her hair, as her hands were full. `Feather, I say!\u0027\n 　　`WHY do you say \"feather\" so often?\u0027 Alice asked at last, rathervexed. \u0027I\u0027m not a bird!\u0027\n 　　`You are,\u0027 said the Sheet: `you\u0027re a little goose.\u0027\n 　　This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for aminute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds ofweeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), andsometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks frowningover their heads.\n 　　`Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!\u0027 Alice cried in asudden transport of delight. `There really are--and SUCH beauties!\u0027\n 　　`You needn\u0027t say \"please\" to ME about `em\u0027 the Sheep said, withoutlooking up from her knitting: `I didn\u0027t put `em there, and I\u0027m not going totake `em away.\u0027\n 　　`No, but I meant--please, may we wait and pick some?\u0027 Alicepleaded. `If you don\u0027t mind stopping the boat for a minute.\u0027\n 　　`How am _I_ to stop it?\u0027 said the Sheep. `If you leave off rowing,it\u0027ll stop of itself.\u0027\n 　　So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till itglided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeveswere carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep toget the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for awhile Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent overthe side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into thewater--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after anotherof the darling scented rushes.\n 　　`I only hope the boat won\u0027t tipple over!\u0027 she said to herself. Oh,WHAT a lovely one! Only I couldn\u0027t quite reach it.\u0027 `And it certainlyDID seem a little provoking (`almost as if it happened on purpose,\u0027 shethought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as theboat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn\u0027t reach.\n 　　`The prettiest are always further!\u0027 she said at last, with a sigh at theobstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began toarrange her new-found treasures.\n 　　What mattered it to her just than that the rushes had begun to fade,and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that shepicked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very littlewhile--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, asthey lay in heaps at her feet-- but Alice hardly noticed this, there were somany other curious things to think about.\n 　　They hadn\u0027t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oarsgot fast in the water and WOULDN\u0027T come out again (so Alice explainedit afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught herunder the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of `Oh, oh, oh!\u0027\n 　　from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among theheap of rushes.\n 　　However, she wasn\u0027t hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep wenton with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. `Thatwas a nice crab you caught!\u0027 she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.\n 　　`Was it? I didn\u0027t see it,\u0027 Said Alice, peeping cautiously over theside of the boat into the dark water. `I wish it hadn\u0027t let go--I should solike to see a little crab to take home with me!\u0027 But the Sheep onlylaughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.\n 　　`Are there many crabs here?\u0027 said Alice.\n 　　`Crabs, and all sorts of things,\u0027 said the Sheep: `plenty of choice,only make up your mind. Now, what DO you want to buy?\u0027\n 　　`To buy!\u0027 Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and halffrightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in amoment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.\n 　　`I should like to buy an egg, please,\u0027 she said timidly. `How do yousell them?\u0027\n 　　`Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two,\u0027 the Sheep replied.\n 　　`Then two are cheaper than one?\u0027 Alice said in a surprised tone,taking out her purse.\n 　　`Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two,\u0027 said the Sheep.\n 　　`Then I\u0027ll have ONE, please,\u0027 said Alice, as she put the money downon the counter. For she thought to herself, `They mightn\u0027t be at all nice,you know.\u0027\n 　　The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said`I never put things into people\u0027s hands--that would never do--you must getit for yourself.\u0027 And so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop,and set the egg upright on a shelf.\n 　　`I wonder WHY it wouldn\u0027t do?\u0027 thought Alice, as she groped herway among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards theend. `The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it.\n 　　Let me see, is this a chair? Why, it\u0027s got branches, I declare! How veryodd to find trees growing here! And actually here\u0027s a little brook! Well,this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!\u0027\n 　　* * * * * * ** * * * * ** * * * * * *So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, aseverything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quiteexpected the egg to do the same.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/309.html","bookId":695,"book":{"id":695,"title":"镜中缘 Through The Looking Glass","description":"简介： Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a work of children\u0027s literature by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson).
