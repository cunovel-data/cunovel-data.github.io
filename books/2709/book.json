{"id":2709,"title":"Sisters in Sanity","description":"Storyline: Have you ever had the out-of-control dream? The one where you know you\u0027re not crazy, but no one around you--not your parents, not your teachers, not even the authorities--will listen to you? For sixteen-year-old Brit Hemphill, the out-of-control dream comes true when her dad enrolls her at Red Rock, a bogus treatment center that claims to cure rebellious teen girls. At Red Rock, Brit is forced into therapy, and her only hope of getting her life back is in the hands of an underqualified staff of counselors. Brit\u0027s dad thinks Red Rock can save her, but the truth is it\u0027s doing more harm than good. No girl could survive Red Rock alone--but at a treatment center where you earn privileges for ratting out your peers, it\u0027s hard to know who you can trust. For Brit, everything changes when she meets V, Bebe, Martha, and Cassie, four girls who keep her from going over the edge. Together they\u0027ll hold on to their sanity and their sisterhood while trying to keep their Red Rock reality from becoming a full-on nightmare.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sisters-in-sanity.jpg","author":"Gayle Forman","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":24,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
