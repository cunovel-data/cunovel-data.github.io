{"id":8531,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. NO. 61 AND NO. 62.","content":"The stateroom was small, as most staterooms on river boats are. There appeared to be no means of ventilation. Mr. Waterbury[95] was a stout man, and inclined to be short-breathed. After an hour he rose and opened the door, so as to leave it slightly ajar. With the relief thus afforded he was able to go to sleep, and sleep soundly. Tom was already asleep, and knew nothing of what had happened. The number of the stateroom was 61. Directly opposite was 62, occupied by Milton Graham and his companion. If Graham did not go to sleep it was because his brain was busily scheming how to obtain possession of the money belonging to his neighbors. \"Won\u0027t your key fit?\" asked Vincent, for this was the name of the dark-complexioned young man. \"No use, even if it does. Of course they will lock it inside, and probably leave the key in the lock.\" About midnight, Graham, who had not fully undressed, having merely taken off his coat, got up, and, opening the door, peered out. To his surprise and joy he saw that the door of No. 61 was ajar. He at first thought of rousing Vincent, who was asleep; but a selfish[96] thought suggested itself. If he did this, he must share with Vincent anything he might succeed in stealing; if not, he could keep it all himself. He left his stateroom silently, and looked cautiously around him. No one seemed to be stirring in the cabin. Next he stepped across, and, opening wider the door of 61, looked in. The two inmates were, to all appearances, sleeping soundly. \"So far, so good,\" he said to himself. He stepped in, moderating even his breathing, and took up a pair of pants which lay on a chair. They belonged to Mr. Waterbury, for Tom had merely taken off his coat, and lain down as he was. His belt of gold he therefore found it unnecessary to take off. Graham saw at once, from the size of the pants, that they must belong to the elder passenger. This suited him, however, as he knew from Vincent\u0027s information that Mr. Waterbury had six hundred dollars, and Tom could not be supposed to have anything like this sum. He felt eagerly in the pockets, and to his great joy his hand came in contact with a pocketbook. He drew it out without ceremony.[97] It was a comfortable-looking wallet, fairly bulging with bills. \"He\u0027s got all his money inside,\" thought Graham, delighted. \"What a fool he must be to leave it so exposed—with his door open, too!\" At this moment Graham heard a stir in the lower berth. There was no time to wait. He glided out of the room, and reentered his own stateroom. Immediately after his departure Mr. Waterbury, who had awakened in time to catch sight of his receding figure, rose in his berth, and drew toward him the garment which Graham had rifled. He felt in the pocket, and discovered that the wallet had been taken. Instead of making a fuss, he smiled quietly, and said: \"Just as I expected.\" \"I wonder if they have robbed Tom, too,\" he said to himself. He rose, closed the door, and then shook Tom with sufficient energy to awaken him. \"Who\u0027s there?\" asked Tom, in some bewilderment, as he opened his eyes. \"It\u0027s I—Mr. Waterbury.\" \"Is it morning? Have we arrived?\"[98] \"No, it is about midnight.\" \"Is there anything the matter?\" \"I want you to see if you have been robbed.\u0027\" Tom was broad awake in an instant. \"Robbed!\" he exclaimed, in alarm. He felt for his belt and was relieved. \"No,\" he answered. \"What makes you ask?\" \"Because I have had a wallet taken. It makes me laugh when I think of it.\" \"Makes you laugh!\" repeated Tom, under the transient impression that his companion was insane. \"Why should you laugh at the loss of your money?\" \"I saw the thief sneak out of the stateroom,\" continued Mr. Waterbury; \"but I didn\u0027t interfere with him.\" \"You didn\u0027t!\" said Tom, completely mystified. \"I would. Did you see who it was?\" \"Yes; it was your friend and late roommate.\" \"Mr. Graham?\" \"As he calls himself. I don\u0027t suppose he has any rightful claim to the name.\" \"Surely, Mr. Waterbury, you are not going to let him keep the money,\" said Tom energetically;[99] \"I\u0027ll go with you, and make him give it up. Where is his stateroom?\" \"Just opposite—No. 62.\" \"We had better go at once,\" said Tom, sitting up in his berth. \"Oh, no; he\u0027s welcome to all there is in the pocketbook.\" \"Wasn\u0027t there anything in it?\" \"It was stuffed full.\" Tom was more than ever convinced that his roommate was crazy. He had heard that misfortune sometimes affected a man\u0027s mind; and he was inclined to think that here was a case in point. \"You\u0027ll get it back,\" said he soothingly. \"Graham can\u0027t get off the boat. We will report the matter to the captain.\" \"I don\u0027t care whether I get it back or not,\" said Mr. Waterbury. Tom looked so confused and bewildered that his companion felt called upon to end the mystification. \"I know what is in your mind,\" he said, smiling. \"You think I am crazy.\" \"I don\u0027t understand how you can take your loss so coolly, sir.\"[100] \"Then I will explain. That wallet was a dummy.\" \"A what, sir?\" \"A sham—a pretense. My pocketbook and money are safe under my pillow. The wallet taken by your friend was filled with imitation greenbacks; in reality, business circulars of a firm in Marietta.\" Tom saw it all now. \"It\u0027s a capital joke,\" he said, laughing. \"I\u0027d like to see how Graham looks when he discovers the value of his prize.\" \"He will look green, and feel greener, I suspect,\" chuckled Mr. Waterbury. \"You are certain you have lost nothing, Tom?\" \"Perfectly certain, sir.\" \"Then we won\u0027t trouble ourselves about what has happened. I fancy, however, it will be best to keep our own door locked for the remainder of the night, even at the risk of suffocation.\" \"That\u0027s a capital trick of yours, Mr. Waterbury,\" said Tom admiringly. \"It has more than once saved me from robbery. I have occasion to travel considerably, and so am more or less exposed.\"[101] \"I wonder if Graham will discover the cheat before morning.\" \"I doubt it. The staterooms are dark, and the imitation is so good that on casual inspection the strips of paper will appear to be genuine greenbacks.\" Mr. Waterbury retired to his berth, and was soon asleep again. Tom, as he lay awake, from time to time laughed to himself, as he thought of Graham\u0027s coming disappointment, and congratulated himself that he and that young man were no longer roommates. When Graham returned to his stateroom Vincent, who was a light sleeper, was aroused by the slight noise he made. \"Are you up, Graham?\" he asked. \"Yes; I got up a minute.\" \"Have you been out of the stateroom?\" \"Yes.\" \"What for?\" \"To get a glass of water.\" There was a vessel of water in the cabin, and this seemed plausible enough. \"Any chance of doing anything to-night?\" \"No, I think not.\" Vincent sank back on his pillow, and Graham[102] got back into his berth. Quietly he drew the wallet from his pocket, in which he had placed it, and eagerly opened it. The huge roll of bills was a pleasant and welcome sight. \"There\u0027s all of six hundred dollars here!\" he said to himself. \"I mustn\u0027t let Vincent know that I have them.\" It occurred to Graham that, of course, Mr. Waterbury would proclaim his loss in the morning, and it also occurred to him that he might be able to fasten suspicion upon Tom, who, as his roommate, would naturally have the best chance to commit the robbery. One thing might criminate him—the discovery of the wallet upon his person. He therefore waited till Vincent was once more asleep, and, getting up softly, made his way to the deck. He drew the bills from the wallet, put them in an inside pocket, and threw the wallet into the river. \"Now I\u0027m safe,\" he muttered, with a sigh of relief. \"The money may be found on me, but no one can prove it is not my own.\" He gained his berth without again awakening his companion.[103] \"A pretty good night\u0027s work!\" he said to himself, in quiet exultation. \"Alone I have succeeded, while Vincent lies in stupid sleep. He is no match for me, much as he thinks of himself. I have stolen a march upon him this time.\" It is not in accordance with our ideas of the fitness of things that a man who has committed a midnight robbery should be able to sleep tranquilly for the balance of the night, but it is at any rate certain that Graham slept soundly till his roommate awakened him in the morning. \"Rouse up, Graham,\" he said. \"Breakfast is nearly ready.\" \"Is it?\" asked Graham. \"Instead of sleeping there, you ought to be thinking how we can make a forced loan from our acquaintances in 61.\" \"To be sure,\" said Graham, smiling. \"I am rather stupid about such things. Have you any plan to suggest?\" \"You seem very indifferent all at once,\" said Vincent. \"Not at all. If you think of anything practical I am your man.\"[104] He longed to get rid of Vincent, in order to have an opportunity of counting his roll of bills. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83165.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
