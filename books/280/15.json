{"id":8534,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. THE ALLEGHANY HOUSE.","content":"It was a bright, sunny morning when the River Belle touched her pier at Cincinnati. The passengers gathered on deck, and discussed their plans. In one group were Tom,[118] Mr. Waterbury, Jennie Watson, and her mother. \"I am sorry you are going to leave us, Tom,\" said Jennie; \"I shall feel awfully lonely.\" \"So shall I,\" said Tom. \"What\u0027s the use of going to that hateful California? Why can\u0027t you stay here with us?\" \"Business before pleasure, Jennie,\" said her mother. \"You mustn\u0027t forget that Tom has his fortune to make.\" \"I wish he could make it in Cincinnati, mother.\" \"So do I; but I must admit that California presents a better prospect just at present. You are both young, and I hope we may meet Tom in after years.\" \"When I have made my pile,\" suggested Tom. \"Precisely.\" \"You won\u0027t go right on, Tom, will you?\" asked Jennie. \"You\u0027ll stay here a day or two.\" \"Yes; I should like to see something of Cincinnati.\" \"And you\u0027ll call on us?\"[119] \"I shall be very happy to do so. Where are you going to stay?\" \"At the Burnet House. Won\u0027t you come there, too?\" \"Is it a high-priced hotel?\" \"I believe it is.\" \"Then I can\u0027t afford to stay there; but I can call on you all the same.\" \"Stay there as my guest, Tom,\" said Mr. Waterbury cordially. \"It shall not cost you anything.\" \"Thank you, sir. You are very kind, but I don\u0027t like to accept unnecessary favors. I will put up at some cheap hotel, and call upon you both.\" \"You would be heartily welcome, my boy,\" said Mr. Waterbury. \"I don\u0027t doubt it, sir, and the time may come when I will gladly accept your kindness,\" replied Tom. \"But now you mean to have your own way; is that it, Tom.\" \"You won\u0027t be offended, sir?\" \"On the contrary, I respect you for your manly independence. You won\u0027t forget that I am your friend?\"[120] \"I don\u0027t want to forget that, sir.\" So it happened that while Mrs. Watson, Jennie, and Mr. Waterbury registered at the Burnet House, Tom, carpetbag in hand, walked through the streets till he came to a plain inn, bearing the name Alleghany House. It is not now in existence, having given way to an imposing business block. \"That looks as if it might suit my purse,\" thought Tom. He walked in, and, approaching the desk, inquired: \"How much do you charge at this hotel?\" \"A dollar a day,\" answered the clerk. \"Will you have a room?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Please register your name.\" Tom did so. \"Cato,\" called the clerk—summoning a colored boy, about Tom\u0027s size—\"take this young man to No. 18.\" \"All right, sar,\" said Cato, showing his ivories. \"When do you have dinner?\" asked Tom. \"One o\u0027clock.\" Preceded by Cato, Tom walked up-stairs, and was ushered into a small, dingy room on[121] the second floor. There was a single window, looking through dingy panes upon a back yard. There was a general air of cheerlessness and discomfort, but at any rate it was larger than the stateroom on the River Belle. \"Is this the best room you have?\" asked Tom, not very favorably impressed. \"Oh, no, sar,\" answered Cato. \"If your wife was with you, sar, we\u0027d give you a scrumptious room, \u0027bout twice as big.\" \"I didn\u0027t bring my wife along, Cato,\" said Tom, amused. \"Are you married?\" \"Not yet, sar,\" answered his colored guide, with a grin. \"I think we can wait till we are a little older.\" \"Reckon so, sar.\" \"Just bring up a little water, Cato. I feel in need of washing.\" \"Dirt don\u0027t show on me,\" said Cato, with a guffaw. \"I suppose you do wash, now and then, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sar, sometimes,\" answered Cato equivocally. When Tom had completed his toilet he[122] found that it was but ten o\u0027clock. He accordingly went down-stairs, intending to see a little of the city before dinner.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83168.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
