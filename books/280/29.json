{"id":8548,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. A RACE FOR LIFE.","content":"The Indians were taken by surprise. They so outnumbered their intended captives that they had not anticipated an attempt at escape. But they had no intention of losing their prey. There was a howl of surprise and disappointment; then they sprang for their horses, and, with little delay, were on the track of our two friends. The delay was small, but it was improved by Scott and Tom. Pressing their animals to their highest speed they gained a lead of several hundred feet before their savage pursuers had fairly started. It was well that Tom was a good rider, or he might not have been able to keep his seat. In fact, he had never ridden so rapidly before: but he felt that he was riding for his life, and was only anxious to ride faster. Scott had felt a little anxious on this point; but his anxiety vanished when he saw how easily and fearlessly his boy companion kept at his side.[231] \"Well done, Tom!\" he said, as they flew over the prairie. \"Keep up this pace, and we will escape yet.\" \"I can do it, if my horse holds out,\" returned Tom briefly. Scott looked over his shoulder, and, brave man as he was, it almost made him shudder. The whole party of Indians was on his track. He could see their dusky faces, distorted by wrath, and the longing for a savage revenge. He knew that Tom and he had little to hope for if they were caught. Fortunately their horses were strong and fleet, and not likely to break down. \"Ride for your life, Tom!\" he shouted. \"They will show us no mercy if they catch us.\" \"All right, Mr. Scott!\" said Tom, his face flushed, and panting with excitement. If he had not felt that so much depended upon it; if he could have thrust out from his mind the sense of the awful peril in which he stood—he would have enjoyed the furious pace at which his horse was carrying him. The horses ridden by the Indians were not equal in speed or endurance to those which[232] the two friends bestrode. They were fresher indeed, but they did not make up for the difference between them. There was one exception, however: Dan, the stolen horse, was not only equal to either of their horses, but had the advantage of being fresher. This, after a while, began to tell. It was ridden by a young Indian brave, a brother of the leader. Soon he drew away from his companions, and, yard by yard, lessened the distance between himself and the pursued. At the end of three miles he was close upon them, and at least fifty rods in advance of his comrades. Scott saw this in one of his backward glances. \"Tom,\" said he, \"the redskin on Dan is overhauling us.\" \"Will he catch us?\" \"I mean to catch him,\" said Scott coolly. Tom did not need to ask for an explanation. Scott wheeled round, took hasty but accurate aim at the Indian, and fired. The hapless warrior reeled in his saddle, loosed his hold of the reins, and fell to the ground, while his horse, continuing in his course, his pace accelerated by fright, soon galloped alongside of Scott. There was a howl of rage from the main body[233] of Indians, who saw the fate of their comrade, without being able to help him. \"Now, Tom, ride as you never rode before!\" shouted Scott. \"We will circumvent those Indian devils yet, and bring Dan safe into camp. Come along, Dan, old fellow; you\u0027re doing nobly.\" Dan recognized the familiar voice. He entered into the spirit of the race, and, relieved from the weight of his rider, dashed forward with increased speed, till he led, and Scott and Tom were forced to follow. The Indians were mad with rage. Their comrade had received a fatal wound. They saw the round hole in his breast, from which the life-blood was gushing, and they thirsted for vengeance. Should two palefaces, one of them a boy, escape from them? That would be a disgrace, indeed; the blood of their brother called for blood in return. Could they have inspired their horses with the same spirit which animated themselves, they might, perhaps, have overtaken their intended captives; but, happily for our two[234] friends, the horses were less interested than their riders. The danger was well-nigh over. It was scarcely two miles to the camp. There they would be so re-enforced that the Indians would not venture an attack. That was the goal they had in view. Already they could see in the distance the wagon-train, ready for a start. They were surely safe now. But at this unlucky moment Tom\u0027s horse stumbled. The motion was so rapid that he could not retain his seat. He was thrown over the horse\u0027s head, and lay stunned and insensible upon the ground. His horse kept on his way to the camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83182.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
