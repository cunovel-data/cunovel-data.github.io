{"id":8544,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. A NIGHT PANIC.","content":"Lawrence Peabody\u0027s feelings when night approached were not unlike those of a prisoner under sentence of death. He was timid, nervous, and gifted with a lively imagination. His fears were heightened by the sad spectacle that he had recently witnessed. His depression was apparent to all; but I regret to say that it inspired more amusement than sympathy. Men winked at each other as they saw him pass; and, with the exception of Tom and his Scotch friend, probably nobody pitied the poor fellow. \"He\u0027s a poor creature, Tom,\" said Donald Ferguson; \"but I pity him. We wouldn\u0027t[202] mind watching to-night; but I doubt it\u0027s a terrible thing to him.\" \"I would volunteer in his place, but Mr. Fletcher won\u0027t agree to it,\" said Tom. \"He is right. The young man must take his turn. He won\u0027t dread it so much a second time.\" \"What would the poor fellow do if he should see an Indian?\" \"Faint, likely; but that is not probable.\" \"Mr. Fletcher thinks there are some not far off.\" \"They don\u0027t attack in the night, so I hear.\" \"That seems strange to me. I should think the night would be most favorable for them.\" \"It\u0027s their way. Perhaps they have some superstition that hinders.\" \"I am glad of it, at any rate. I can sleep with greater comfort.\" The rest were not as considerate as Tom and Ferguson. They tried, indeed, to excite still further the fears of the young Bostonian. \"Peabody,\" said Miles, \"have you made your will?\" \"No,\" answered Peabody nervously. \"Why should I?\"[203] \"Oh, I was thinking that if anything happened to you to-night you might like to say how your things are to be disposed of. You\u0027ve got a gold watch, haven\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" said Peabody nervously. \"And a little money, I suppose.\" \"Not very much, Mr. Miles.\" \"No matter about that. Of course if you are killed you won\u0027t have occasion for it,\" said Miles, in a matter-of-fact tone. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t talk that way,\" said Peabody irritably. \"It makes me nervous.\" \"What\u0027s the use of being nervous? It won\u0027t do any good.\" \"Do you really think, Mr. Miles, there is much danger?\" faltered Peabody. \"Of course there is danger. But the post of danger is the post of honor. Now, Peabody, I want to give you a piece of advice. If you spy one of those red devils crouching in the grass, don\u0027t stop to parley, but up with your revolver, and let him have it in the head. If you can\u0027t hit him in the head, hit him where you can.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t it be better,\" suggested Peabody,[204] in a tremulous voice, \"to wake you up, or Mr. Fletcher?\" \"While you were doing it the savage would make mince-meat of you. No, Peabody, fire at once. This would wake us all up, and if you didn\u0027t kill the reptile we would do it for you.\" \"Perhaps he would see me first,\" suggested Peabody, in a troubled tone. \"You mustn\u0027t let him. You must have your eyes all about you. You are not near-sighted, are you?\" \"I believe I am—a little,\" said Peabody eagerly, thinking that this might be esteemed a disqualification for the position he dreaded. \"Oh, well, I guess it won\u0027t make any difference, only you will need to be more vigilant.\" \"I wish I was blind; just for to-night,\" thought Peabody to himself, with an inward sigh. \"Then they would have to excuse me.\" John Miles overtook Fletcher, who was with the head wagon. \"Captain Fletcher,\" he said, \"I am afraid Peabody will make a mighty poor watch.\" \"Just my opinion.\"[205] \"He is more timid than the average woman. I\u0027ve got a sister at home that has ten times his courage. If she hadn\u0027t I wouldn\u0027t own the relationship.\" \"I am not willing to excuse him.\" \"Of course not; but I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll keep an eye open myself, so that we sha\u0027n\u0027t wholly depend on him.\" \"If you are willing to do it, Miles, we shall all be indebted to you. Don\u0027t let him know it, though.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to. He shall suppose he is the only man awake in camp.\" At a comparatively early hour the party stretched themselves out upon the ground, inviting sleep. Generally they did not have to wait long. The day\u0027s march brought with it considerable physical fatigue. Even those who were light sleepers at home slept well on the trip across the plains. Few or none remained awake half an hour after lying down. So Peabody knew that he would soon be practically alone. With a heavy heart he began to pace slowly forward and back. He came to where Tom lay.[206] \"Tom—Tom Nelson,\" he called, in a low voice. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Tom, in a sleepy tone. \"Are you asleep?\" \"No; but I soon shall be.\" \"Won\u0027t you try to keep awake a little while? It won\u0027t seem so lonesome.\" \"Sorry I can\u0027t accommodate you, Mr. Peabody; but I\u0027m awfully tired and sleepy.\" \"Who\u0027s that talking there?\" drowsily demanded the nearest emigrant. \"Can\u0027t you keep quiet, and let a fellow sleep?\" \"Good night, Mr. Peabody,\" said Tom, by way of putting an end to the conversation. \"Good night,\" returned the sentinel disconsolately. The hours passed on, and Lawrence Peabody maintained his watch. He was in no danger of going to sleep, feeling too timid and nervous. He began to feel a little more comfortable. He could see nothing suspicious, and hear nothing except the deep breathing of his sleeping comrades. \"It is not so bad as I expected,\" he muttered to himself.[207] He began to feel a little self-complacent, and to reflect that he had underrated his own courage. He privately reflected that he was doing as well as any of his predecessors in duty. He began to think that after he had got back to Boston with a fortune, gained in California, he could impress his friends with a narrative of his night-watch on the distant prairies. But his courage had not yet been tested. He took out his watch to see how time was passing. It pointed to twelve o\u0027clock. Why there should be anything more alarming in twelve o\u0027clock than in any other hour I can\u0027t pretend to say, but the fact none will question. Mr. Peabody felt a nervous thrill when his eyes rested on the dial. He looked about him, and the darkness seemed blacker and more awe-inspiring than ever, now that he knew it to be midnight. \"Will it ever be morning?\" he groaned. \"Four long hours at least before there will be light. I don\u0027t know how I am going to stand it.\" Now, there was attached to the wagon-train one of those universally despised but useful[208] animals, a donkey, the private property of a man from Iowa, who expected to make it of service in California. The animal was tethered near the camp, and was generally quiet. But to-night he was wakeful, and managed about midnight to slip his tether, and wandered off. Peabody did not observe his escape. His vigilance was somewhat relaxed, and with his head down he gave way to mournful reflection. Suddenly the donkey, who was now but a few rods distant, uplifted his voice in a roar which the night stillness made louder than usual. It was too much for the overwrought nerves of the sentinel. He gave a shriek of terror, fired wildly in the air, and sank fainting to the ground. Of course the camp was roused. Men jumped to their feet, and, rubbing their eyes, gazed around them in bewilderment. It was not long before the truth dawned upon them. There lay the sentinel, insensible from fright, his discharged weapon at his feet, and the almost equally terrified donkey was in active flight, making the air vocal with his peculiar cries. There was a great shout of laughter, in the[209] midst of which Peabody recovered consciousness. \"Where am I?\" he asked, looking about him wildly, and he instinctively felt for his scalp, which he was relieved to find still in its place. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked the leader. \"What made you fire?\" \"I—I thought it was the Indians,\" faltered Peabody. \"I thought I heard their horrid war-whoop.\" \"Not very complimentary to the Indians to compare them with donkeys,\" said Miles. Lawrence Peabody was excused from duty for the remainder of the night, his place being taken by Miles and Tom in turn. It was a long time before he heard the last of his ridiculous panic, but he was not sensitive as to his reputation for courage, and he bore it, on the whole, pretty well. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83178.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
