{"id":8535,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. THE EVENTS OF A MORNING.","content":"Graham and Vincent had kept quiet during the latter part of the voyage. They had a wholesome fear of Mr. Waterbury, and kept aloof from him and Tom. They even exchanged their stateroom for one at a different part of the boat. All was satisfactory to Tom and his companion. When the worthy pair reached Cincinnati they were hard up. Their united funds amounted to but seven dollars, and it seemed quite necessary that they should find the means of replenishing their purses somewhere. They managed to ascertain that Tom and his friend were going to separate, and this afforded them satisfaction, since it made their designs[123] upon our hero more feasible. At a distance they followed Tom to the Alleghany House, and themselves took lodgings at a small, cheap tavern near-by. Like Tom, they set out soon after their arrival in quest of adventure. \"We must strike a vein soon, Graham,\" said Vincent, \"or we shall be in a tight place.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" answered Graham. \"Thus far our trip hasn\u0027t paid very well. It\u0027s been all outgo and no income.\" \"You\u0027re right, partner; but don\u0027t give up the ship,\" responded Graham, whose spirits returned, now that he was on dry land. \"I\u0027ve been in the same straits about once a month for the last five years.\" \"I\u0027ve known you for three years, Graham, and, so far as my knowledge extends, I can attest the truth of what you say. By the way, you never say anything of your life before that date.\" A shadow passed over Graham\u0027s face. \"Because I don\u0027t care to think of it; I never talk of it,\" he said. \"Pshaw, man, we all of us have some ugly secrets. Suppose we confide in each[124] other. Tell me your story, and I will tell you mine. It won\u0027t change my opinion of you.\" \"Probably not,\" said Graham. \"Well, there is no use in holding back. For this once I will go back to the past. Five years ago I was a favorite in society. One day an acquaintance introduced me into a gambling house, and I tried my hand successfully. I went out with fifty dollars more than I brought in. It was an unlucky success, for it made me a frequent visitor. All my surplus cash found a market there, and when that was exhausted I borrowed from my employer.\" \"Without his knowledge?\" \"Of course. For six months I evaded discovery. Then I was detected. My friends interceded, and saved me from the penitentiary, but I lost my situation, and was required to leave the city. I went to New York, tried to obtain a situation there, failed, and then adopted my present profession. I need not tell you the rest.\" \"My dear friend, I think I know the rest pretty well. But don\u0027t look sober. A fig for the past. What\u0027s the odds, as long as you\u0027re happy?\"[125] \"Are you happy?\" inquired Graham. \"As long as I\u0027m flush,\" answered Vincent, shrugging his shoulders. \"I\u0027m nearly dead-broke now, and of course I am miserable. However, my story comes next in order. I was a bank teller, appropriated part of the funds of the bank, fled with it, spent it, and then became an ornament to our common profession.\" \"Where was the bank?\" \"In Canada. I haven\u0027t been there since. The climate don\u0027t suit me. It\u0027s bleak, but I fear it might prove too hot for me. Now we know each other.\" \"You don\u0027t allow it to worry you, Vincent,\" said Graham. \"No, I don\u0027t. Why should I? I let the dead past bury its dead, as Longfellow says, and act in the living present. That reminds me, we ought to be at work. I have a proposal to make. We won\u0027t hunt in couples, but separate, and each will try to bring home something to help the common fund. Is it agreed?\" \"Yes.\" \"Au revoir, then!\"[126] \"That fellow has no conscience,\" thought Graham. \"Mine is callous, but he goes beyond me. Perhaps he is the better off.\" Graham shook off his transient dull spirits, and walked on, keeping a sharp lookout for a chance to fleece somebody. In front of a railroad ticket office he espied a stolid-looking German, who was trying to read the placard in the window. Graham approached him, and said politely, \"My friend, perhaps I can help you. Are you thinking of buying a railroad ticket?\" The German turned, and his confidence was inspired by the friendly interest of Graham\u0027s manner. \"I go to Minnesota,\" he said, \"where my brother live.\" \"Exactly, and you want a ticket to go there?\" \"Yes, I want a ticket. Do they sell him here?\" \"No,\" said Graham. \"That is, they do sell tickets here; but they ask too much.\" \"I will not pay too much,\" said the German, shaking his head decisively.[127] \"Of course not; I will take you to a cheaper place.\" \"That is good,\" said the German, well pleased. \"It is luck I meet mit a friend like you.\" \"Yes,\" said Graham, linking his arm in that of his new acquaintance. \"I don\u0027t like to see a worthy man cheated. Come with me. How much money have you?\" This inquiry ought to have excited the suspicions of the German; but he was trustful, and answered promptly, \"Two hundred dollar.\" Graham\u0027s eyes sparkled. \"If I could only get the whole of it,\" he thought. But that didn\u0027t seem easy. They walked through street after street till Graham stopped in front of an office. \"Now,\" said he, \"give me your money, and I will buy the ticket.\" \"How much money?\" asked his new acquaintance. \"I don\u0027t know exactly,\" said Graham carelessly. \"Just hand me your pocketbook, and I will pay what is needed.\"[128] But here the German\u0027s characteristic caution came in. \"I will go with you,\" he said. \"If you do, I can\u0027t get the tickets so cheap. The agent is a friend of mine, and if he thinks it is for me he will give it to me for less. Don\u0027t give me all your money. Fifty dollars will do. I will buy the ticket, and bring you the rest of the money.\" This seemed plausible enough, and Graham would have got what he asked for, but for the interference of Tom, who had come up just in time to hear Graham\u0027s proposal. He had no difficulty in comprehending his purpose. \"Don\u0027t give him the money,\" he said. \"He will cheat you.\" Both Graham and his intended victim wheeled round, and looked at our hero. \"Clear out of here, you young vagabond!\" said Graham angrily. \"This man wants to cheat you,\" persisted Tom. \"Don\u0027t give him your money.\" The bewildered foreigner looked from one to the other. \"This is no ticket office,\" said Tom. \"I[129] will lead you to one, and you shall buy a ticket for yourself.\" \"He wants to swindle you,\" said Graham quickly. \"You shall keep your money in your own hands,\" said Tom. \"I don\u0027t want it.\" \"I go with you, my young friend,\" said the German, convinced by Tom\u0027s honest face. \"The other man may be all right, but I go with you.\" Graham protested in vain. His victim went off with Tom, who saw that he was provided with the ticket he wanted. His new friend tried to force a dollar upon him; but this Tom steadily refused. \"I\u0027ll get even with you yet!\" said Graham furiously; but our hero was not disturbed by this menace. Vincent, meantime, was making a tour of observation, ready for any adventure that might put an honest or dishonest penny into his pocket. About half an hour later he found himself on the leading retail street in Cincinnati. In front of him walked a lady, fashionably attired, holding a mother-of-pearl portemonnaie carelessly in her hand. He brushed[130] by her, and at the same moment the pocketbook was snatched from her hand. The lady screamed, and instinctively clutched Vincent by the arm. \"This man has robbed me, I think,\" she said. The crowd began to gather about Vincent, and he saw that he was cornered. Among the crowd, unluckily for himself, was Tom. By a skilful movement Vincent thrust the portemonnaie into our hero\u0027s pocket. \"You are mistaken, madam,\" he said coolly; \"I saw that boy take your money.\" Instantly two men seized Tom. \"Search him,\" said Vincent, \"and see it I am not right.\" The portemonnaie was taken from Tom\u0027s pocket, amid the hootings of the crowd. \"So young, and yet so wicked!\" said the lady regretfully. \"I didn\u0027t take the money, madam,\" protested Tom, his face scarlet with surprise and mortification. \"Don\u0027t believe him, ma\u0027am. I saw him take it,\" said Vincent virtuously. Poor Tom looked from one to another; but[131] all faces were unfriendly. It was a critical time for him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83169.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
