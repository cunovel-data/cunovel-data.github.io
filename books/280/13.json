{"id":8532,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. GRAHAM\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT.","content":"Milton Graham, on reaching a place where he could do so unobserved, drew from his pocket the roll of bills, with a smile of exultation. But the smile faded, and was succeeded by a look of dismay, when he recognized the worthlessness of his booty. An oath rose to his lips, and he thrust the roll back into his pocket, as he noticed the approach of a passenger. \"It\u0027s a cursed imposition!\" he muttered to himself, and he really felt that he had been wronged by Mr. Waterbury. \"What are you doing out here, Graham?\" asked Vincent, for it was his confederate who approached. \"Nothing in particular. Why?\" responded Graham.[105] \"What makes you look so glum?\" \"Do I look glum?\" \"You look as if you had but one friend in the world, and were about to lose him.\" \"That may be true enough,\" muttered Graham. \"Come, man, don\u0027t look so downcast.\" \"I\u0027m out of luck, and out of cash, Vincent.\" \"We\u0027re both in the same boat, as far as that goes; but that isn\u0027t going to last. How about our stout friend? Can\u0027t we make him contribute to our necessities?\" \"I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s got any money.\" \"No? Why, I heard him tell the boy he had six hundred dollars.\" \"Where does he keep it?\" \"In his pocketbook probably.\" \"Will you oblige me by stating how we are going to get hold of it?\" \"I look to you for that.\" \"He\u0027s too careful. I leave you to try your hand.\" \"Let me go in to breakfast. There\u0027s nothing like a full stomach to suggest ideas.\"[106] So the two went to the breakfast table, and Graham, in spite of his disappointment, managed to eat a hearty meal. An hour later Mr. Waterbury and Tom were standing on deck, conversing with Jennie Watson and her mother, when Graham and Vincent approached arm in arm. As soon as they were within hearing distance Mr. Waterbury purposely remarked, \"By the way, Mrs. Watson, I met with a loss last night.\" \"Indeed!\" returned the lady. Graham was about to push on, not wishing Vincent to hear the disclosure, as it might awaken his suspicions; but the latter\u0027s curiosity was aroused. \"Wait, Graham,\" he said; and Graham, against his will, was compelled to slacken his pace. \"A man entered my stateroom during the night, and stole a wallet from my coat pocket.\" Graham changed color a little, and Vincent seemed amazed. \"Did you hear that, Graham?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" \"What does it mean?\" \"How can I tell?\"[107] \"I hope you did not lose much,\" said Mrs. Watson, in a tone of sympathy. \"I lost the wallet,\" said Mr. Waterbury, laughing. \"Was there nothing in it?\" \"It was full of bills.\" Vincent looked at Graham with new-born suspicion, but Graham looked indifferent. \"It appears to me that you take the loss cheerfully,\" said Mrs. Watson, puzzled. \"I have reason to. The fact is, I was prepared for the visit, and had filled the wallet with bogus bills. I fancy they won\u0027t do my visitor much good.\" The lady smiled. \"You were fortunate, Mr. Waterbury,\" said she. \"Do you suspect any one of the theft?\" \"I know pretty well who robbed me,\" returned Mr. Waterbury, and he suffered his glance to rest on Graham, who seemed in a hurry to get away. \"Come along, Vincent,\" he said sharply. Vincent obeyed. Light dawned upon him, and he determined to verify his suspicions. \"Graham,\" said he, in a low voice, \"you did this.\"[108] \"Did what?\" \"You got that wallet.\" Graham concluded that he might as well make a clean breast of it, since it had become a matter of necessity. \"Well,\" said he, \"suppose I did?\" \"You were not going to let me know of it,\" said Vincent suspiciously. \"That is true. I was ashamed of having been imposed upon.\" \"When did you find out that the money was bogus?\" \"Immediately.\" \"If it had been good, would you have shared with me honorably?\" \"Of course. What do you take me for?\" Vincent was silent. He did not believe his companion. He suspected that the latter had intended to steal a march on him. \"You might have told me of it,\" he continued, in a tone of dissatisfaction. \"There was no need to say anything, as there was nothing to divide.\" \"Have you got the wallet with you now?\" \"No; I threw it overboard.\" \"And the bills?\"[109] \"You may have them all, if you like.\" \"Come into the stateroom, where we can be unobserved, and show them to me.\" Graham complied with his suggestion. \"It would have been a good haul if they had been genuine,\" said Vincent, as he unfolded the roll. \"Yes, but they are not; worse luck!\" \"I didn\u0027t give the old fellow credit for being so sharp.\" \"Nor I. There\u0027s more in him than I supposed there was.\" \"Well, what is to be done?\" \"Nothing. The old man is on his guard, and, besides, he suspects me. He was probably awake when I entered the stateroom. He and the boy have probably laughed over it together. I hate that boy.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he is a green country boy, and yet he has succeeded in thwarting me. I am ashamed whenever I think of it.\" \"Would you like to play a trick on him in turn?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then give me this roll of bills.\"[110] \"What do you want to do with them?\" \"Put them in his pocket.\" \"Can you do it unobserved?\" \"Yes. The fact is, Graham, I served an apprenticeship as a pickpocket, and flatter myself I still have some dexterity in that line.\" \"Very well, it will be some satisfaction, and if the old man didn\u0027t see me enter the stateroom, he may be brought to believe that the boy robbed him. If that could be, I should feel partly compensated for my disappointment. I should like to get that boy into trouble.\" \"Consider it done, so far as I am concerned. Now let us separate, so as to avoid suspicion.\" Vincent began to pace the deck in a leisurely manner, in each case passing near Tom, who was still engaged in conversation with Jennie Watson and her mother. For a time he was unable to effect his purpose, as our hero was sitting down. But after a while Tom rose, and stood with his back to Vincent. He wore a sack coat, with side pockets. This was favorable to Vincent, who, as he passed, adroitly slipped the bills into one of them, without attracting the attention of our hero.[111] Presently Tom thrust his hand into his pocket mechanically. They encountered the bills. In surprise he drew them out, and looked at them in amazement. \"What\u0027s that, Tom?\" asked Jennie, with great curiosity. \"It looks like money,\" answered Tom, not yet understanding what had happened. \"You seem to be rich.\" \"By gracious!—it\u0027s Mr. Waterbury\u0027s money,\" exclaimed Tom. Then he colored, as it flashed upon him that its presence in his pocket might arouse suspicion. \"I don\u0027t see how it got there,\" he continued, in a bewildered way. Just then Mr. Waterbury came up, and was made acquainted with the discovery. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ll think, Mr. Waterbury,\" said Tom, coloring; \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea how the money came in my pocket.\" \"I have,\" said Mr. Waterbury quietly. Tom looked at him, to discover whether he was under suspicion. \"The companion of your friend Graham slipped it into your pocket. He was very[112] quick and adroit, but I detected him. He wanted to throw suspicion upon you.\" \"It is lucky you saw him, sir.\" \"Why?\" \"You might have suspected me.\" \"My dear boy, don\u0027t trouble yourself about that. No circumstantial evidence will shake my confidence in your integrity.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom gratefully. \"What a wicked man to play a trick on you, Tom!\" exclaimed Jennie indignantly. \"I see there is somebody else who has confidence in you, Tom,\" said Mr. Waterbury, smiling; \"I\u0027d like to give him a piece of my mind.\" \"I am ready to forgive him,\" said Mr. Waterbury, \"as he has restored the money. It will do as a bait for the next thief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83166.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
