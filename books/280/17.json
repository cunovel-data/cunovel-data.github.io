{"id":8536,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. TOM\u0027S ARREST.","content":"To one who is scrupulously honest a sudden charge of dishonesty is almost overwhelming. Now, Tom was honest, not so much because he had been taught that honesty was a virtue, as by temperament and instinct. Yet here he saw himself surrounded by hostile faces, for a crowd soon collected. Not one believed in his innocence, not even the lady, who thought it was such a pity that he was \"so young and yet so wicked.\" \"Will somebody call a policeman?\" asked Vincent. A policeman soon made his appearance. He was a stout, burly man, and pushed his way through the crowd without ceremony. \"What\u0027s the row?\" he inquired. \"This boy has picked a lady\u0027s pocket,\" exclaimed Vincent.[132] The officer placed his hand roughly on Tom\u0027s shoulder. \"You were a little too smart, young feller!\" said he. \"You must come along with me.\" \"I didn\u0027t take the money,\" protested Tom, pale, but in a firm voice. \"That\u0027s too thin,\" said Vincent, with a sneer. \"Yes, it\u0027s too thin,\" repeated two or three in the crowd. \"It\u0027s true,\" said Tom. \"Perhaps you\u0027ll tell us how the money came in your pocket,\" suggested a bystander. \"That man put it in,\" answered Tom, indicating Vincent. The latter shrugged his shoulders. \"He says so, because I exposed him,\" he remarked, turning to the crowd. \"Of course; that\u0027s a common game,\" interposed the policeman. \"Have you any reason for what you say, my boy?\" asked a quiet-looking man, with a pleasant face. \"Of course he hasn\u0027t,\" replied Vincent hastily.[133] \"I spoke to the boy, sir.\" \"I have a reason,\" answered Tom. \"A friend of this man roomed with me at Pittsburg, and during the night tried to rob me. We were both passengers on the River Belle on the last trip. During the trip he entered our stateroom, and stole a wallet from my roommate. This man slyly put it into my pocket, in order to escape suspicion.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" exclaimed Vincent uneasily. \"Gentlemen, the boy is very artful, and the greatest liar out.\" \"Of course he is!\" assented the policeman. \"Come along, young feller!\" \"Wait a minute,\" said the quiet man. \"Have you any proof of your statements, my boy, except your own word?\" \"Yes, sir; my roommate will tell you the same thing.\" \"Who is he? Where can he be found?\" \"He is Mr. Nicholas Waterbury, of Marietta. He is now at the Burnet House.\" \"That\u0027s all gammon!\" said the officer roughly. \"Come along. I can\u0027t wait here all day.\" \"Don\u0027t be in a hurry, officer,\" said the quiet[134] man. \"I know Mr. Waterbury, and I believe the boy\u0027s story is correct.\" \"It ain\u0027t any of your business!\" said the officer insolently. \"The boy\u0027s a thief, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to lock him up.\" \"Look out, sir!\" said the quiet man sternly. \"You are overstepping the limits of your duty, and asserting what you have no possible means of knowing. There is reason to believe that this man\"—pointing out Vincent—\"is the real thief. I call upon you to arrest him.\" \"I don\u0027t receive no orders from you, sir,\" said the policeman. \"I\u0027m more likely to take you along.\" \"That\u0027s right, officer,\" said Vincent approvingly. \"The man is interfering with you in the exercise of your duty. You have a perfect right to arrest him.\" \"I have a great mind to,\" said the officer, who was one of the many who are puffed up by a little brief authority, and lose no opportunity of exercising it. The quiet man did not seem in the least alarmed. He smiled, and said, \"Perhaps, officer, it might be well for you to inquire my name, before proceeding to arrest me.\"[135] \"Who are you?\" demanded the officer insolently. \"I am Alderman Morris.\" A great change came over the policeman. He knew now that the quiet man before him was President of the Board of Aldermen, and he began to be alarmed, remembering with what rudeness he had treated him. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said humbly; \"I didn\u0027t know you.\" \"What is your name, sir?\" demanded the alderman, in a tone of authority. \"Jones, sir.\" \"How long have you been on the force?\" \"Six months, your honor.\" \"Then you ought to be better fitted for your position by this time.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t take no offense at what I said, not knowing you, alderman.\" \"That\u0027s no personal offense, but I object to your pronouncing upon the guilt of parties arrested when you know nothing of the matter.\" \"Shall I take the boy along, sir?\" \"Yes, and this man also. I don\u0027t wish to[136] interfere with the exercise of justice, but it is my opinion that the boy is innocent.\" \"I protest against this outrage,\" said Vincent nervously. \"Am I to be punished because I expose a thief?\" \"Come along, sir,\" said the policeman. \"The alderman says so.\" \"I appeal to the gentlemen present,\" said Vincent, hoping for a forcible deliverance. \"Madam,\" said the alderman to the lady who had been robbed, \"did you see the boy take your pocketbook?\" \"No, sir! I thought it was the man, till he told me it was the boy, and the money was found on the boy.\" \"I should think that told the story,\" said Vincent. \"Any man here might be arrested as soon as I. Fellow citizens, is this a free country, where a man of reputation can be summarily arrested at the bidding of another? If so, I would rather live under a monarchy.\" There was a murmur of approval, and some sympathy was excited. \"There will be no injustice done, sir,\" said the alderman. \"I propose to follow up this[137] matter myself. I will see my friend, Mr. Waterbury, and I can soon learn whether the boy\u0027s story is correct.\" \"He may lie, too!\" said Vincent, who had very good reasons for fearing Mr. Waterbury\u0027s testimony. \"Mr. Waterbury is a gentleman of veracity,\" said Alderman Morris sharply. \"I see you recognize the name.\" \"Never heard of him,\" said Vincent. \"I suppose it is one of the boy\u0027s confederates.\" \"I will answer for him,\" said the alderman. \"My boy,\" he said, \"I hope we shall be able to prove your innocence. Be under no anxiety. Go with the officer, and I will seek out Mr. Waterbury. Officer, take care to treat him gently.\" \"All right, sir.\" There was no fear now that Tom would be roughly treated. He had too much regard for his own interest, and his tenure of office, to disoblige a man so influential and powerful as Alderman Morris. Notwithstanding there had been such a turn in his favor, Tom felt humiliated to feel that he was under restraint, and his cheeks burned[138] with shame as he walked beside the officer. Vincent, upon the other side, gnashed his teeth with rage, as he thought of his unexpected detention. Just as revenge was in his grasp, he had been caught in the same trap which he had so willingly set for Tom. \"That Alderman Morris is a fool!\" he said. \"He isn\u0027t fit to be in office.\" \"Don\u0027t you say nothin\u0027 against him!\" said the policeman. \"It won\u0027t be best for you. He\u0027s one of our leadin\u0027 citizens, Alderman Morris is.\" \"He snubbed you!\" sneered Vincent. \"He talked to you as if you were a dog.\" \"No, he didn\u0027t. You\u0027d better shut up, prisoner.\" \"Oh, well, if you\u0027re willing to be trampled upon, it isn\u0027t any of my business. I wouldn\u0027t stand it, alderman or no alderman. Such things wouldn\u0027t be allowed in New York, where I live.\" \"Oh, New York\u0027s a model city, so I\u0027ve heard,\" retorted the policeman, in a tone of sarcasm. \"We don\u0027t pretend to come up to New York.\" Finding that nothing was to be gained by[139] continuing his attacks upon the alderman, Vincent became silent; but his brain was active. He felt that Mr. Waterbury\u0027s testimony would be fatal to him. He must escape, if possible. Soon a chance came. He seized his opportunity, shook off the grasp of the officer, and darted away. Not knowing what to do with Tom, who was also under arrest, the officer paused an instant, then, leaving our hero, hastened in pursuit. \"Now\u0027s your chance to escape, boy!\" said a sympathetic bystander to him. \"I don\u0027t want to escape,\" answered Tom. \"I want my innocence proved. I shall stay where I am till the officer returns.\" And he kept his word. Ten minutes later the officer came back, puffing and panting, after an unsuccessful pursuit; prepared to find Tom gone also. \"What, are you there?\" he asked, staring in wonder. \"Yes,\" said Tom; \"I don\u0027t want to escape. I shall come out right.\" \"I believe you will,\" said the officer, with a revulsion of sentiment in Tom\u0027s favor. \"Just walk along beside me, and I won\u0027t take[140] hold of you. I\u0027m not afraid of your running away now.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83170.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
