{"id":8529,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. ON THE STEAMER.","content":"In half an hour the River Belle was on her way. Tom watched the city as it receded from view. He enjoyed this new mode of travel better than riding on the cars. He had never before been on any boat except a ferry-boat, and congratulated himself on his decision to journey by boat part of the way. Milton Graham had passed him two or three times, but Tom, though seeing him, had not volunteered recognition. Finding that he must make the first advances, Graham finally stopped short, looked full at our hero, and his face wore a very natural expression of surprise and pleasure. \"Why, Tom, is that you?\" he said, offering his hand, which Tom did not appear to see.[77] \"Yes,\" said our hero coldly. \"I didn\u0027t expect to see you here.\" \"I told you I intended to sail on the River Belle.\" \"So you did; but I thought you had changed your mind.\" It made very little difference to Tom what Mr. Graham thought, and he turned from him to watch the scenery past which the boat was gliding. \"I suppose,\" continued the young man, \"you were surprised to find me gone when you came down-stairs to breakfast.\" \"Yes, I was.\" \"He resents it because I left him,\" thought Graham. \"I guess I can bring him around.\" \"The fact was,\" explained Graham, in a plausible manner, \"I went out to call on a friend, meaning to come back to breakfast; but he made me breakfast with him, and when I did return you were gone. I owe you an apology, Tom. I hope you will excuse my unintentional neglect.\" \"Oh, certainly,\" said Tom indifferently; \"it\u0027s of no consequence.\" Mr. Graham looked at him sharply. He[78] could not tell whether our hero was aware of his dishonest intentions or not, but as Tom must still have money, which he wanted to secure, he thought it best to ignore his coldness. \"No,\" said he; \"it\u0027s of no consequence as long as we have come together again. By the way, have you secured a stateroom?\" \"Yes.\" \"If the other berth is not taken, I should like very much to go in with you,\" said Graham insinuatingly. \"I have a roommate,\" said Tom coolly. \"You have? Who is it?\" demanded Graham, disappointed. \"That gentleman,\" answered Tom, pointing out Mr. Nicholas Waterbury. \"Humph! do you know him?\" \"I met him at the Pittsburg House.\" \"My young friend,\" said Graham, with the air of a friendly mentor, \"I want to give you a piece of advice.\" \"Very well.\" \"Don\u0027t be too ready to trust strangers. This Mr. Waterbury may be a very good man, but,[79] on the other hand, he may be a confidence man. Do you understand me?\" \"I think so.\" \"Now, I suppose you have money?\" \"A little.\" \"Take care that he doesn\u0027t get possession of it. There are men who go about expressly to fleece inexperienced strangers.\" \"I suppose you know all about that,\" Tom could not help saying. \"What do you mean?\" demanded Graham suspiciously. \"You are an old traveler, and must know all about the sharpers.\" \"Oh, to be sure,\" said Graham, immediately dismissing his suspicions. \"You couldn\u0027t leave your companion, could you, and come into my stateroom?\" \"I don\u0027t think I could.\" \"Oh, very well. It\u0027s of no consequence. Keep a good lookout for your roommate.\" Graham turned away, and resumed his walk. Soon Tom saw him in company with the dark young man, to whom reference has already been made.[80] \"Well,\" said the latter, \"how did you make out with the boy?\" \"He\u0027s offish. I don\u0027t know as he suspects me. I wanted to get him into my stateroom, but he has already taken up with another man—that stout party over there.\" \"So I suspected. I can tell you something about that man.\" \"What?\" \"He carries six hundred dollars about him.\" \"You don\u0027t say so! How did you find out?\" \"I overheard him telling the boy so.\" \"That\u0027s important news. The boy must have a couple of hundred, or thereabouts, as he is on his way to California.\" \"Eight hundred dollars together! That would make a good haul.\" \"So it would, but it won\u0027t be easy to get it.\" While this conversation was going on Tom informed Mr. Waterbury of what had passed between Graham and himself. \"So he warned you against me, did he?\" said Mr. Waterbury laughingly. \"Yes, he thought I would be safer in his company.\"[81] \"If you want to exchange, I will retire,\" said Mr. Waterbury, smiling. \"Thank you; I would rather not. I am glad I met you, or he might have managed to get in with me.\" It was not long before they came to a landing. It was a small river village, whose neat white houses, with here and there one of greater pretensions, presented an attractive appearance. A lady and her daughter came on board here. The lady was dressed in black, and appeared to be a widow. The girl was perhaps fourteen years of age, with a bright, attractive face. Two trunks were put on the boat with them, and as they were the only passengers from this landing, Tom inferred that they were their property. \"That\u0027s quite a pretty girl,\" said Mr. Waterbury. \"Yes,\" answered Tom. \"You ought to get acquainted with her,\" said Mr. Waterbury jocosely. \"Perhaps,\" said Tom shyly, \"you will get acquainted with them, and then you can introduce me.\" \"You are quite sharp,\" said Mr. Waterbury,[82] laughing. \"However, your hint is a good one. I may act upon it.\" It happened, however, that Tom required no introduction. As the lady and her daughter walked across the deck, to occupy some desirable seats on the other side, the former dropped a kid glove, which Tom, espying, hastened forward and, picking up, politely tendered to the owner. \"You are very kind,\" said the lady, in a pleasant voice. \"I am much obliged.\" \"Mama is quite in the habit of dropping her gloves,\" said the young girl, with a smiling glance at Tom. \"I really think she does it on purpose.\" \"Then, perhaps, I had better keep near-by to pick them up,\" said Tom. \"Really, Jennie,\" said her mother, \"you are giving the young gentleman a strange impression of me.\" \"Well, mama, you know you dropped your gloves in the street the last time you were in Pittsburg, but there was no gentleman to pick them up, so I had to. Are you going to Cincinnati?\" she asked, turning to Tom.[83] \"Yes, and farther; I am going to California,\" replied Tom. \"Dear me, you will be quite a traveler. I wish I were going to California.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t like to go there on the same business that I am.\" \"What is that?\" \"I am going to dig gold.\" \"I don\u0027t know. I suppose it isn\u0027t girl\u0027s work; but if I saw any gold about, I should like to dig for it. Is that your father that was standing by you?\" \"No,\" answered Tom. \"I never met him till yesterday. We were staying at the same hotel in Pittsburg.\" \"He seems like quite a nice old gentleman.\" Mr. Waterbury was not over fifty, but to the young girl he seemed an old gentleman. \"I find him very pleasant.\" There was a seat next to Jennie, and Tom ventured to occupy it. \"What is your name?\" asked the young lady sociably. \"Thomas Nelson, but most people call me Tom.\"[84] \"My name is Jane Watson, but everybody calls me Jennie.\" \"That is much prettier than Jane.\" \"So I think. Jane seems old-maidish, don\u0027t you think so?\" \"Are you afraid of becoming an old maid?\" asked Tom, smiling. \"Awfully. I wouldn\u0027t be an old maid for anything. My school-teacher is an old maid. She\u0027s horribly prim. She won\u0027t let us laugh, or talk, or anything.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll grow up like that.\" \"I hope not.\" \"How you run on, Jennie!\" said her mother. \"What will this young gentleman think of you?\" \"Nothing very bad, I hope,\" said Jennie, smiling archly on Tom. \"I suppose,\" she continued, addressing him, \"I ought to be very quiet and reserved, as you are a stranger.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t be,\" said Tom heartily. \"Then I won\u0027t. Somehow you don\u0027t seem like a stranger. You look a good deal like a cousin of mine. I suppose that is the reason.\" So they chatted on for an hour or more.[85] Jennie was very vivacious, occasionally droll, and Tom enjoyed her company. The mother saw that our hero was well-behaved and gentlemanly, and made no objection to the sudden intimacy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83163.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
