{"id":8546,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. THE LOST HORSE.","content":"Day followed day, and every sunset found the party from eighteen to twenty miles nearer[218] the land of gold. They had not yet been molested by Indians, though on more than one occasion they had encountered the remains of those whom the savages had ruthlessly slaughtered. When they witnessed such a spectacle they were moved less by fear than indignation. \"I didn\u0027t think I should ever thirst for a fellow creature\u0027s blood,\" said John Miles; \"but if I could meet the savages that did this bloody work, I would shoot them down like dogs, and sleep all the more soundly for it. How is it with you, friend Ferguson?\" \"I am inclined to agree with you,\" said the Scotchman. \"When an Indian makes himself a beast of prey he should be treated accordingly.\" \"Are there any Indians in California?\" asked Peabody nervously. \"I don\u0027t think we shall have any trouble with them there, Mr. Peabody,\" said Ferguson. \"Then I wish I was there now. It must be terrible to be scalped;\" and the young man from Boston shuddered. \"I don\u0027t think it would be an agreeable surgical operation,\" said Fletcher, who had just[219] come up. \"Let us hope that we shall not be called upon to undergo it.\" The next morning, when breakfast was over, and the party was preparing to start, an unpleasant discovery was made. One of the most valuable horses was missing. He must have slipped his tether during the night, and strayed away; as they were situated, the loss of such an animal would be felt. \"He can\u0027t be far away,\" said Fletcher. \"Some of us must go after him.\" \"Let Peabody mount the mustang, and undertake to find him,\" suggested John Miles, winking at the captain. \"Mr. Peabody,\" said Captain Fletcher gravely, \"will you undertake to recover the horse? We shall all feel under great obligations to you.\" \"I—I hope you will excuse me, Captain Fletcher,\" stammered Peabody, in great alarm. \"I know I couldn\u0027t find the horse. I shouldn\u0027t know where to look.\" \"This is where he got away. You can see his trail in the grass,\" said Scott, a young man from Indiana. \"All you will have to do will be to follow the trail, Mr. Peabody.\"[220] \"I\u0027m very near-sighted,\" pleaded Peabody. \"I should lose my way, and never come back.\" \"Carrying the mustang with you? That would be a loss indeed,\" said John Miles pointedly. \"On the whole, Captain Fletcher, we had better excuse Mr. Peabody.\" \"Mr. Peabody is excused,\" said the leader. \"Thank you,\" said Peabody, looking relieved. \"I would go, I am sure, if I could do any good; but I know I couldn\u0027t.\" \"Who will volunteer?\" asked Fletcher. \"Let me go,\" said Tom eagerly. \"You are not afraid of losing your way, Tom?\" said Miles. \"No; or if I do, I will find it again.\" \"That boy is more of a man now than Peabody will ever be,\" said Miles, in a low voice to Ferguson. \"That he is,\" said the Scotchman, who was a firm friend of our young hero. \"There is the making of a noble man in him.\" \"I believe you.\" \"I have no objection to your going, Tom,\" said Fletcher; \"but it is better that you should have company. Who will go with the boy?\"[221] \"I,\" said several, among them John Miles and Henry Scott. \"You may go, Scott,\" said the leader. \"I have work for Miles at camp. The sooner you get started the better.\" \"All right, captain. Come along, Tom.\" The two were in the saddle before two minutes had passed, and, guided by the trail, struck out upon the prairie. Scott was a tall, broad-shouldered young farmer, not over twenty-five, strong and athletic, and reported, the best runner, wrestler, and vaulter in the party. Tom was very well pleased to have his company.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83180.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
