{"id":8549,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. TOM BECOMES AN INDIAN.","content":"Scott did not immediately notice Tom\u0027s mishap. The boy had shown himself so good a rider that such an accident had not occurred to him as likely to happen. When he did look back there was already a considerable distance between them. In fact, Tom lay midway between the Indians and himself.[235] What was he to do? If he returned there was no hope of rescuing Tom; and he would infallibly fall into the hands of the Indian pursuers. In that case his fate was sealed. He had killed an Indian warrior, and his life would pay the forfeit. By going on he could head a rescuing party from the camp. His heart ached for Tom. It was hard to leave him in the hands of the savage foe; but Tom was a boy, and there was hope that he would be spared; so he felt that it was better to continue his flight. There was a shout of fierce joy when the Indians saw Tom\u0027s fall. They would have preferred to capture Scott, for he it was who had killed their comrade; but they were glad to have one prisoner. They reined up their horses, and halted beside the still insensible boy. They held a brief consultation, and decided not to continue the pursuit. They could see the encampment, which Scott was sure to reach before he could be overtaken. They could not tell the number of the party to which he belonged; but, being few in numbers themselves, the risk would be a hazardous one. They decided to retire with their prisoner.[236] Tom was lifted to a seat in front of one of the party, and they rode leisurely back. This was the position in which our hero found himself when he roused from his stupor. One glance revealed to him the whole. His heart sank within him. They might kill him. Remembering the ghastly sights he had seen on his trip across the plains, he thought it likely that they would. Life was sweet to Tom. To what boy of sixteen is it not? It seemed hard to be cut off in the threshold of an active career, and by savage hands. But there was an additional pang in the thought that now he would be unable to help his father. The result of his plan would only be to impose an additional burden upon the modest home which his father found it so hard to keep up. Tom sighed; and, for the first time in his life, he felt discouraged. He looked about him, scanning the dark, grave faces, and read no hope or encouragement in any. Finally the Indians came to a halt at their old camping-ground, and Tom was lifted from the horse. He was placed upon the ground, in the center of the group. Then followed a consultation. From the glances[237] directed toward him Tom understood that he was the subject of deliberation. In fact, his fate was being decided. It was certainly a trying ordeal for our young hero. He was not sure of half an hour\u0027s life. An unfavorable decision might be followed by immediate execution. Tom felt that his best course was to remain perfectly passive. He could not understand what was said; but we are able to acquaint the reader with the general purport of the conference. Several of the Indians favored immediate death. \"Our brother\u0027s blood calls for vengeance,\" they said. \"The white boy must die.\" \"The boy did not kill him,\" said others. \"It was the white warrior who spilled our brother\u0027s blood. He must be pursued and slain.\" \"What, then, shall be done with the boy? Shall he go?\" \"No; we will keep him. He has strong limbs. We will adopt him into our tribe. He will make a brave warrior.\" \"He shall be my brother,\" said the chief.[238] \"I will take him in place of my brother who is dead.\" There was a low murmur of approval. Even those who had first recommended the infliction of death seemed to have changed their minds. They looked at the boy as he lay stretched out upon the ground. He was stout, comely, and strongly made. He had proved that he was an admirable rider. If he should join them he would grow up into a warrior who would do credit to their tribe. So the matter was settled. The only thing that remained was to acquaint the prisoner with the decision. The interpreter approached Tom, and said, \"White boy, you are our captive. Why should we not kill you?\" \"You can if you wish,\" answered Tom; \"but why should you kill me? I have done you no harm.\" \"Our brother is killed. He lies dead upon the plain.\" \"I did not kill him,\" said Tom. \"The white boy speaks truth. He did not kill our brother, but his white friend took his life.\"[239] \"You ought not to kill me for that,\" said Tom, gathering courage, for he inferred he was to live. \"The white boy speaks truth, and therefore he shall live, but he must join us. He must live with us, hunt with us, and fight for us.\" \"You want me to become an Indian!\" ejaculated Tom. \"We will take you in place of the warrior that is gone,\" said the interpreter. Tom looked thoughtful. He did not enjoy the prospect before him, but it was, at all events, better than death. While there was life there was hope of escape. He concluded to make one appeal for freedom, and, if that was denied, to accept the proposal. \"I have a father and mother far away,\" he said; \"I have brothers and a sister, who will mourn for me. My father is poor; he needs my help. Let me go back to them.\" The interpreter communicated Tom\u0027s words to his companions, but it was easy to see that they were not favorably received. The original advocates of the death penalty looked at our hero with hostile eyes, and he saw that he had made a mistake.[240] \"The white boy must become one of us; he must take our brother\u0027s place, or he must die,\" said the interpreter. Tom very sensibly concluded that it would be better to live with the Indians than to be killed, and signified his acceptance of the offer. Upon this the Indians formed a circle about him, and broke into a monotonous chant, accompanied with sundry movements of the limbs, which appeared to be their way of welcoming him into their tribe. It seemed like a dream to Tom. He found it very hard to realize his position, so unexpectedly had he been placed in it. He could not help wondering what the family at home would say when they should learn that he had joined an Indian tribe far beyond the Mississippi. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011/83183.html","bookId":280,"book":{"id":280,"title":"The Young Adventurer","description":"简介： I wish I could pay off the mortgage on my farm, said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room where his wife and family were assembled....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3011","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
