That\u0027s how it must have been, he thought; he wanted to rope me in, and he researched me to find the quickest, easiest lever with which to pry me out of my place in the ordered world. If I hadn\u0027t been married to that castrating woman, he\u0027d have had to find some other lever ... I wonder what that might have been ... my pride, perhaps, he could have maneuvered me into an illegal but unavoidable-with-honor duel ... or my honesty, put me in the position of having to beggar myself by repaying some dire debt undertaken by my wife. But of course I made it easy for him. All he had to do was pay Ramona\u0027s whores to give me back what my wife had taken from me, and then eventually to drug me and send a girl in who was a perfect duplicate, in looks and derisive manner, of my wife ... And then afterward, when my laboring heart had purged my bloodstream of the drug, and I was staring down at the dead girl\u0027s face, which no longer bore a resemblance to anyone, that evil giant strode into the room, a grin on him like a stratum of exposed granite in a mountainside, and he offered me the choice. Some choice. Chapter Ten To Beth Hurwood\u0027s right lay the vast swamp that penetrated, they said, far inland - a region where land and water blurred into each other, seldom distinct, where snakes swam in the pools and fish crawled along the banks, where the very arrangement of channels and islands would, like a diabolically animate maze, change, rendering maps no more useful for navigating than sketches of clouds would be, where still air became stagnant like still water, and so miasmally thick that insects too large to do more than crawl anywhere else could fly here. Even as she glanced at that dark quarter of the landscape, far off in the marsh there appeared one of the randomly floating spheres of phosphorescence that the pirates called spirit balls; it lifted above the wispy surface of the fog and bounced slowly among the cypress branches and the dangling masses of Spanish moss, and then, just as slowly, fell back into the fog-river, and the glow became nebulous and then died out. She looked in the other direction then toward the steel-gray sea, below which the sun had sunk half an hour before in so vast and molten a blaze that the high, wispy cirrus clouds still glowed pink; and being on higher ground and undazzled by the fires, she saw the sail a moment before the pirates did. First a shout came faintly across the water from one of the three moored ships, and then one of the men down by the fires pointed and yelled, \"A sail!\" The pirates all leaped up and sprinted for the boats, instinctively preferring to be on the water rather than on the land if there was to be trouble. Beth wavered uncertainly. If the sail - a single one, and disappointingly small - was a Royal Navy craft, she certainly didn\u0027t want to be aboard any ship that succeeded in fleeing them; but if she hid and stayed behind, would the Navy craft stop and send someone to check for stragglers ashore? Someone giggled very close by, and she jumped and smothered a scream. Leo Friend stepped out from behind a cluster of swamp maple trees. \"Going for a walk, my d-d-d - Elizabeth?\" His eyes, she noticed, seemed to show too much white around the irises, and a smile came and went on his face as quickly and randomly as something that should have been secured in a wind. \"Uh, yes,\" she said, wondering desperately how to be rid of him. \"What sail is that, do you suppose?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Friend said. His voice was shriller than usual tonight. \"Royal Navy, rival pirates - it\u0027s too late for anyone to stop us.\" The smile poked his pudgy lips out and then disappeared again. \"And t-t-tomorrow w-w-we\u0027ll - to-m-morrow we s-s-sail from h-h ... damn it ... here.\" He pulled a lace handkerchief from his sleeve and mopped his forehead. \"In the meantime I\u0027ll walk with you.\" \"I\u0027m going down toward the fires to see what\u0027s going on,\" she told him, knowing that since shooting Davies the fat physician had been reluctant, even with his various protective fetishes, to mingle with the pirates. \"Your buccaneer s-sweetheart\u0027s dead, Elizabeth,\" Friend snapped, his sparky cheer abruptly gone, \"and I think it shows at least a lack of imagination to choose his suc-suc-suc-successor from out of the same stew.\" Beth ignored him and began picking her way down the slope. To her alarm, she heard Friend following. How on earth, she wondered frantically, can I get away from him and keep the appointment with Bonnett? A man out on the anchored Carmichael shouted something Beth couldn\u0027t hear, but the message was repeated by the men on the beach. \"It\u0027s the bleedin\u0027 Jenny!\" came a wondering shout. \"The Jenny got free of that man-o\u0027-war!\" With no clear transition point the pirates\u0027 panicky rout became a riot of celebration. Bells began ringing on the Vociferous Carmichael and Bonnett\u0027s Revenge - though not on Blackbeard\u0027s ship) - and muskets were fired into the darkening sky, and the various ships\u0027 musicians hastily snatched up their instruments and began clamoring. Glad now that it wasn\u0027t a Royal Navy vessel, Beth Hurwood quickened her pace, while Friend, seeing that the vessel was not one that offered her a chance of escape, sulkily slacked off his own pace. Having a much shallower draft than the three ships, the Jenny was able to tack in very close to shore before dropping her anchor - the rattling of the chain lost in the general pandemonium - and a few of the men aboard her didn\u0027t wait for boats but took running dives off the bow, daringly trusting the speed and angle of their dives to carry them into water that wouldn\u0027t be over their chins in depth. A few could actually swim, and took this opportunity to show off their exotic skill by paddling around in circles, splashing and blowing like dolphins, before heading in to shore with theatrically nonchalant strokes. One of them, though, just dove in and made his way to shore in a swift, unpretentious crawl, and he was the first to stand up in the shallows and wade in through the surge and ebb to the sand. \"Saints be praised!\" cried one of the men waiting ashore. \"The cook survived!\" \"Whip us up one of your dinners, Shandy,\" called another, \"before the captains start inland!\" A few more sailors had made their way ashore by this time, and the ships\u0027 boats were being dragged down the sand to the surf to facilitate the more formal disembarking, and Jack Shandy was able to avoid the worst of the welcoming press. He glanced around, clearly trying to keep from ruining his night vision by looking directly into the fires, and then his dark, bearded face split in a smile when he saw the slim figure of Beth Hurwood just now striding into the central clearing. She hurried across the sand to him even as he broke into an unsteady run toward her, and when they met it seemed to her only natural to throw her arms around his neck. \"Everybody told me you were all killed - in that last broadside,\" she gasped. \"A lot of us were,\" he said. \"Listen, I\u0027ve been talking to Davies a lot during these last five days, and - \" \"No, you listen. Stede Bonnett and I are going to steal a boat and escape tonight, and I\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be room for you too. The Jenny\u0027s arrival will postpone it a little, I imagine, but it should at the same time provide a fine diversion. Now here\u0027s what you do - linger by the shore for a while until Bonnett can choose a boat, and then watch for me. I\u0027ll - \" \"Shandy!\" came a yell from the fireside crowd. \"Jack! Where in hell are you?\" \"Damn,\" said Shandy. \"I\u0027ll be back.\" He strode away from her toward the crowd. \"Here he is!\" shouted Davies. \"May I present, gentlemen, my new quartermaster!\" The applause that followed this announcement was sporadic, but Davies went on. \"I know - you all think it\u0027s cookery and puppets he does best, and so did I, but it develops his real values are brassier; courage and deceit and a quick, steady hand with a pistol. You want to know how we got away from that man-o\u0027-war?\" The pirates loudly indicated that they wanted to know. On the outskirts of the crowd, Beth Hurwood took several slow steps backward, her face expressionless. Shandy looked back at her over his shoulder, clearly wanting to return and say something to her, but a dozen hands, and even an encouraging boot or two, were propelling him toward Davies and the flattened clearing between the fires. The lean old pirate chief grinned at him; though Davies had cursed the absence of a bocor during the past five days, he had, himself, taken the dead bocor\u0027s kit and managed to \"slap Mate Care-For awake\" and to some extent keep that personage\u0027s attention on the sloop, and now the wounded men were recovering unfevered and Davies\u0027 shoulder seemed to be restored. \"After I was shot off the Carmichael,\" said Davies loudly, \"a circumstance I\u0027ll take up with certain parties presently, I was picked out of the water by the Navy boys and taken aboard their ship. I found the Jenny crippled and captured, and all her surviving lads under armed guard - except for our boy Shandy, who\u0027d told the captain, \u0027Oh dear me, sir, I\u0027m not one of these dirty pirates, I was forced to join them, and I\u0027ll be delighted to testify at their trials.\" Several of the Jenny\u0027s crew had attained the shore and joined the crowd, and now they hollered their delighted agreement. \"That\u0027s just what he said, Phil!\" \"Innocent as a bloody sheep, that captain thought Jacky was!\" \"But,\" Davies went on, \"he tipped me a wink when no one was looking, so I waited to see what he was up to. And what Jack did was convince the captain that I should be questioned privately, down in the great cabin, and no sooner had the three of us and a couple of officers got in there and shut the door than Jack snatched a pistol and shot the captain\u0027s head clean off his body!\" The applause this time was tumultuous, and Shandy was forcibly picked up and marched around the fires on the shoulders of a number of pirates. Beth took another backward step and then turned and ran toward the dark shoreline, as Davies, behind her, went on with relish to describe the way Shandy had engineered the utter destruction of the British man-of-war. She found Bonnett standing just to the dry side of the high-water line, staring out at the darkening sea, his hands locked behind his back and the tilt of his three-cornered hat indicating that he was staring into the sky. \"Let\u0027s go, quickly,\" Beth panted. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve confided our intentions to one who\u0027ll betray us, but perhaps if we leave instantly that won\u0027t matter. And the arrival of the Jenny can surely be used to our profit - you can pretend that the supplies you take from your ship are to replenish those of the ravaged Jenny, can\u0027t you? So for God\u0027s sake, let\u0027s go, every second - \" She halted then, for Bonnett had turned around to look at her, and his face bore an uncharacteristically sardonic smile. \"Ah!\" he said gently. \"Escape, is it? Furtive flight? That explains his extreme tension and anxiety ... very conspicuous states of mind, if one has learned to smell such things.\" He shrugged, and gave her a smile not devoid of sympathy. \"I\u0027m sorry. Neither of the two pieces you propose removing from the board is dispensable right now.\" Beth gasped, then whirled and ran back in despair toward the fires, her most basic assumptions about the world shaken for the first time; for she knew beyond hope of rationalization that, though the voice had been Bonnett\u0027s and had come out of his mouth, it had been someone else speaking to her through them. Shandy swore under his breath, for he\u0027d lost sight of Beth, and he\u0027d hoped to be able to give her his account of Davies\u0027 rescue before she heard the flamboyant version the Jenny\u0027s crew had come to agree on. He was about to demand that the pirates put him down when he caught a whiff of the by now not unfamiliar smell of overheated metal. He tensed, trying to remember some of the things Davies had taught him during the past five days. He exhaled totally and hummed one of the simpler parrying-tunes, and he shifted around on his unsteady perch, trying to face all corners of the compass. He found that his nose burned most uncomfortably when he was facing the farthest fire, and after a moment\u0027s peering he noticed the stocky, red-haired figure of Venner standing there. Shandy braced himself, then raised his left hand, curling the fingers into the uncomfortable position Davies had shown him, but as soon as Venner realized Shandy had noticed him he looked away, and the smell was gone instantly. Shandy whistlingly sucked air into his heaving lungs. Well now, he thought as the pirates wearied of their sport and let him hop down to the packed sand, that\u0027s worth knowing. I guess Venner doesn\u0027t agree that I\u0027m the best man for the quartermaster job. The cheering and howling had abated in the clumps of the crowd nearest to the shore, and after a few seconds the stillness spread to the rest of the crowd; an inattentive pirate or two shouted, and one drunken old man worked his way to the end of a long fit of laughter, and Mr. Bird reminded everyone one more time that he was not a dog, but after that the silence on shore was absolute. And from the dark sea came the kalunk ... clunk ... kalunk ... clunk of oars knocking in oarlocks. Shandy blinked around in uneasy puzzlement. \"What\u0027s up?\" he whispered to a man near him. \"A boat\u0027s coming in - what\u0027s so terrible?\" The man\u0027s right hand darted to his forehead, but he hesitated and then just scratched his scalp. Shandy guessed his first impulse had been to make the sign of the cross. \"It\u0027s Thatch,\" the man said quietly. \" ... Oh.\" Shandy stared out at the boat that was now halfway between the shore and the lightless bulk of the Queen Anne\u0027s Revenge. There were two figures in the boat, one of whom, the bigger one, seemed at this distance to be wearing a tiara of fireflies. More profoundly than ever, Shandy wished that Captain Wilson had not tried to kill Davies. He recalled all the stories he\u0027d heard about this man in the approaching boat, and it occurred to him that Thatch - Blackbeard - the dreaded hunsi kanzo - was the most successful of the buccaneers who had tried to adapt to this new, western world. Blackbeard seemed as much and as inseparably a part of this world as the Gulf Stream.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-stranger-tides/page-17.html","bookId":1558,"book":{"id":1558,"title":"On Stranger Tides","description":"Storyline: Aboard the Vociferous Carmichael, puppeteer John Chandagnac is sailing toward Jamaica to claim his stolen birthright from an unscrupulous uncle, when the vessel is captured . . . by pirates!
