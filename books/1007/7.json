{"id":18987,"no":7,"title":"PERSEVS SHOWING THE GORGON\u0027S HEAD","content":"On a platform, within full view of the balcony, sat the mighty King Polydectes, amid his evil counselors, and with his flattering courtiers in a semicircle round about him. Monarch, counselors, courtiers, and subjects, all gazed eagerly towards Perseus. \"Show us the head! Show us the head!\" shouted the people; and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear Perseus to pieces, unless he should satisfy them with what he had to show. \"Show us the head of Medusa with the snaky locks!\" A feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful Perseus. \"O King Polydectes,\" cried he, \"and ye many people, I am very loath to show you the Gorgon\u0027s head!\" \"Ah, the villain and coward!\" yelled the people, more fiercely than before. \"He is making game of us! He has no Gorgon\u0027s head! Show us the head, if you have it, or we will take your own head for a football!\" The evil counselors whispered bad advice in the king\u0027s ear; the courtiers murmured, with one consent, that Perseus had shown disrespect to-38- their royal lord and master; and the great King Polydectes himself waved his hand, and ordered him, with the stern, deep voice of authority, on his peril, to produce the head. \"Show me the Gorgon\u0027s head, or I will cut off your own!\" And Perseus sighed. \"This instant,\" repeated Polydectes, \"or you die!\" \"Behold it, then!\" cried Perseus, in a voice like the blast of a trumpet. And, suddenly holding up the head, not an eyelid had time to wink before the wicked King Polydectes, his evil counselors, and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the mere images of a monarch and his people. They were all fixed, forever, in the look and attitude of that moment! At the first glimpse of the terrible head of Medusa, they whitened into marble! And Perseus thrust the head back into his wallet, and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer be afraid of the wicked King Polydectes. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84514.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
