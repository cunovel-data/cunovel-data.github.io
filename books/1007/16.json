{"id":18996,"no":16,"title":"THE PARADISE OF CHILDREN","content":"LONG, long ago, when this old world was in its tender infancy, there was a child, named Epimetheus, who never had either father or mother; and, that he might not be lonely, another child, fatherless and motherless like himself, was sent from a far country, to live with him, and be his playfellow and helpmate. Her name was Pandora. The first thing that Pandora saw, when she entered the cottage where Epimetheus dwelt, was a great box. And almost the first question which she put to him, after crossing the threshold, was this,— \"Epimetheus, what have you in that box?\" \"My dear little Pandora,\" answered Epimetheus, \"that is a secret, and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it. The box was left here to be kept safely, and I do not myself know what it contains.\" \"But who gave it to you?\" asked Pandora. \"And where did it come from?\" \"That is a secret, too,\" replied Epimetheus.-79- \"How provoking!\" exclaimed Pandora, pouting her lip. \"I wish the great ugly box were out of the way!\" \"Oh come, don\u0027t think of it any more,\" cried Epimetheus. \"Let us run out of doors, and have some nice play with the other children.\" It is thousands of years since Epimetheus and Pandora were alive; and the world, nowadays, is a very different sort of thing from what it was in their time. Then, everybody was a child. There needed no fathers and mothers to take care of the children; because there was no danger, nor trouble of any kind, and no clothes to be mended, and there was always plenty to eat and drink. Whenever a child wanted his dinner, he found it growing on a tree; and, if he looked at the tree in the morning, he could see the expanding blossom of that night\u0027s supper; or, at eventide, he saw the tender bud of to-morrow\u0027s breakfast. It was a very pleasant life indeed. No labor to be done, no tasks to be studied; nothing but sports and dances, and sweet voices of children talking, or carolling like birds, or gushing out in merry laughter, throughout the livelong day. What was most wonderful of all, the children never quarreled among themselves; neither had they any crying fits; nor, since time first began, had a single one of these little mortals ever gone apart into a corner, and sulked. Oh, what a good time was that to be alive in! The truth is, those ugly little winged monsters, called Troubles, which are now almost as numerous as mosquitoes, had never yet been seen on the earth. It is probable-80- that the very greatest disquietude which a child had ever experienced was Pandora\u0027s vexation at not being able to discover the secret of the mysterious box. This was at first only the faint shadow of a Trouble; but, every day, it grew more and more substantial, until, before a great while, the cottage of Epimetheus and Pandora was less sunshiny than those of the other children. \"Whence can the box have come?\" Pandora continually kept saying to herself and to Epimetheus. \"And what in the world can be inside of it?\" \"Always talking about this box!\" said Epimetheus, at last; for he had grown extremely tired of the subject. \"I wish, dear Pandora, you would try to talk of something else. Come, let us go and gather some ripe figs, and eat them under the trees, for our supper. And I know a vine that has the sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted.\" \"Always talking about grapes and figs!\" cried Pandora, pettishly. \"Well, then,\" said Epimetheus, who was a very good-tempered child, like a multitude of children in those days, \"let us run out and have a merry time with our playmates.\" \"I am tired of merry times, and don\u0027t care if I never have any more!\" answered our pettish little Pandora. \"And, besides, I never do have any. This ugly box! I am so taken up with thinking about it all the time. I insist upon your telling me what is inside of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84523.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
