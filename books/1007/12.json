{"id":18992,"no":12,"title":"MIDAS\u0027 DAVGHTER TVRNED TO GOLD","content":"Yes, there she was, with the questioning look of love, grief, and pity, hardened into her face. It was the prettiest and most woeful sight that ever mortal saw. All the features and tokens of Marygold were there; even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin. But the more perfect was the resemblance, the greater was the father\u0027s agony at beholding this golden image, which was all that was left him of a daughter. It had been a favorite phrase of Midas, whenever he felt particularly fond of the child, to say that she was worth her weight in gold. And now the phrase had become literally true. And now, at last, when it was too late, he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart, that loved him, exceeded-63- in value all the wealth that could be piled up betwixt the earth and sky! It would be too sad a story, if I were to tell you how Midas, in the fullness of all his gratified desires, began to wring his hands and bemoan himself; and how he could neither bear to look at Marygold, nor yet to look away from her. Except when his eyes were fixed on the image, he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold. But, stealing another glance, there was the precious little figure, with a yellow tear-drop on its yellow cheek, and a look so piteous and tender, that it seemed as if that very expression must needs soften the gold, and make it flesh again. This, however, could not be. So Midas had only to wring his hands, and to wish that he were the poorest man in the wide world, if the loss of all his wealth might bring back the faintest rose-color to his dear child\u0027s face. While he was in this tumult of despair, he suddenly beheld a stranger standing near the door. Midas bent down his head, without speaking; for he recognized the same figure which had appeared to him, the day before, in the treasure-room, and had bestowed on him this disastrous faculty of the Golden Touch. The stranger\u0027s countenance still wore a smile, which seemed to shed a yellow lustre all about the room, and gleamed on little Marygold\u0027s image, and on the other objects that had been transmuted by the touch of Midas. \"Well, friend Midas,\" said the stranger, \"pray how do you succeed with the Golden Touch?\"-64- Midas shook his head. \"I am very miserable,\" said he. \"Very miserable, indeed!\" exclaimed the stranger. \"And how happens that? Have I not faithfully kept my promise with you? Have you not everything that your heart desired?\" \"Gold is not everything,\" answered Midas. \"And I have lost all that my heart really cared for.\" \"Ah! So you have made a discovery, since yesterday?\" observed the stranger. \"Let us see, then. Which of these two things do you think is really worth the most,—the gift of the Golden Touch, or one cup of clear cold water?\" \"O blessed water!\" exclaimed Midas. \"It will never moisten my parched throat again!\" \"The Golden Touch,\" continued the stranger, \"or a crust of bread?\" \"A piece of bread,\" answered Midas, \"is worth all the gold on earth!\" \"The Golden Touch,\" asked the stranger, \"or your own little Marygold, warm, soft, and loving as she was an hour ago?\" \"Oh, my child, my dear child!\" cried poor Midas, wringing his hands. \"I would not have given that one small dimple in her chin for the power of changing this whole big earth into a solid lump of gold!\" \"You are wiser than you were, King Midas!\" said the stranger, looking seriously at him. \"Your own heart, I perceive, has not been entirely changed from flesh to gold. Were it so, your case would indeed be desperate. But you appear-65- to be still capable of understanding that the commonest things, such as lie within everybody\u0027s grasp, are more valuable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle after. Tell me, now, do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden Touch?\" \"It is hateful to me!\" replied Midas. A fly settled on his nose, but immediately fell to the floor; for it, too, had become gold. Midas shuddered. \"Go, then,\" said the stranger, \"and plunge into the river that glides past the bottom of your garden. Take likewise a vase of the same water, and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change back again from gold into its former substance. If you do this in earnestness and sincerity, it may possibly repair the mischief which your avarice has occasioned.\" King Midas bowed low; and when he lifted his head, the lustrous stranger had vanished. You will easily believe that Midas lost no time in snatching up a great earthen pitcher (but, alas me! it was no longer earthen after he touched it), and hastening to the river-side. As he scampered along, and forced his way through the shrubbery, it was positively marvelous to see how the foliage turned yellow behind him, as if the autumn had been there, and nowhere else. On reaching the river\u0027s brink, he plunged headlong in, without waiting so much as to pull off his shoes. \"Poof! poof! poof!\" snorted King Midas, as his head emerged out of the water. \"Well; this-66- is really a refreshing bath, and I think it must have quite washed away the Golden Touch. And now for filling my pitcher!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84519.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
