{"id":19002,"no":22,"title":"THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES","content":"DID you ever hear of the golden apples, that grew in the garden of the Hesperides? Ah, those were such apples as would bring a great price, by the bushel, if any of them could be found growing in the orchards of nowadays! But there is not, I suppose, a graft of that wonderful fruit on a single tree in the wide world. Not so much as a seed of those apples exists any longer. And, even in the old, old, half-forgotten times, before the garden of the Hesperides was overrun with weeds, a great many people doubted whether there could be real trees that bore apples of solid gold upon their branches. All had heard of them, but nobody remembered to have seen any. Children, nevertheless, used to listen, open-mouthed, to stories of the golden apple-tree, and resolved to discover it, when they should be big enough. Adventurous young men, who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows, set out in quest of this fruit. Many of them returned no more; none of them brought back the apples. No won-110-der that they found it impossible to gather them! It is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree, with a hundred terrible heads, fifty of which were always on the watch, while the other fifty slept. In my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple. Had the apples been sweet, mellow, and juicy, indeed that would be another matter. There might then have been some sense in trying to get at them, in spite of the hundred-headed dragon. But, as I have already told you, it was quite a common thing with young persons, when tired of too much peace and rest, to go in search of the garden of the Hesperides. And once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world. At the time of which I am going to speak, he was wandering through the pleasant land of Italy, with a mighty club in his hand, and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders. He was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen, and which he himself had killed; and though, on the whole, he was kind, and generous, and noble, there was a good deal of the lion\u0027s fierceness in his heart. As he went on his way, he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden. But none of the country people knew anything about the matter, and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question, if the stranger had not carried so very big a club. So he journeyed on and on, still making the-111- same inquiry, until, at last, he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers. \"Can you tell me, pretty maidens,\" asked the stranger, \"whether this is the right way to the garden of the Hesperides?\" The young women had been having a fine time together, weaving the flowers into wreaths, and crowning one another\u0027s heads. And there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers, that made the flowers more fresh and dewy, and of brighter hues, and sweeter fragrance, while they played with them, than even when they had been growing on their native stems. But, on hearing the stranger\u0027s question, they dropped all their flowers on the grass, and gazed at him with astonishment. \"The garden of the Hesperides!\" cried one. \"We thought mortals had been weary of seeking it, after so many disappointments. And pray, adventurous traveler, what do you want there?\" \"A certain king, who is my cousin,\" replied he, \"has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples.\" \"Most of the young men who go in quest of these apples,\" observed another of the damsels, \"desire to obtain them for themselves, or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love. Do you, then, love this king, your cousin, so very much?\" \"Perhaps not,\" replied the stranger, sighing. \"He has often been severe and cruel to me. But it is my destiny to obey him.\"-112- \"And do you know,\" asked the damsel who had first spoken, \"that a terrible dragon, with a hundred heads, keeps watch under the golden apple-tree?\" \"I know it well,\" answered the stranger, calmly. \"But, from my cradle upwards, it has been my business, and almost my pastime, to deal with serpents and dragons.\" The young women looked at his massive club, and at the shaggy lion\u0027s skin which he wore, and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure; and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men. But, then, the dragon with a hundred heads! What mortal, even if he possessed a hundred lives, could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster? So kind-hearted were the maidens, that they could not bear to see this brave and handsome traveler attempt what was so very dangerous, and devote himself, most probably, to become a meal for the dragon\u0027s hundred ravenous mouths. \"Go back,\" cried they all,—\"go back to your own home! Your mother, beholding you safe and sound, will shed tears of joy; and what can she do more, should you win ever so great a victory? No matter for the golden apples! No matter for the king, your cruel cousin! We do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84529.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
