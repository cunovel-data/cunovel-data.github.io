{"id":18999,"no":19,"title":"PANDORA OPENS THE BOX","content":"\"Oh, I am stung!\" cried he. \"I am stung! Naughty Pandora! why have you opened this wicked box?\" Pandora let fall the lid, and, starting up, looked about her, to see what had befallen Epimetheus. The thunder-cloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it. But she heard a disagreeable buzzing, as if a great many huge flies, or gigantic mosquitoes, or those insects which we call dor-bugs, and pinch-93-ing-dogs, were darting about. And, as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light, she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes, with bats\u0027 wings, looking abominably spiteful, and armed with terribly long stings in their tails. It was one of these that had stung Epimetheus. Nor was it a great while before Pandora herself began to scream, in no less pain and affright than her playfellow, and making a vast deal more hubbub about it. An odious little monster had settled on her forehead, and would have stung her I know not how deeply, if Epimetheus had not run and brushed it away. Now, if you wish to know what these ugly things might be, which had made their escape out of the box, I must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly Troubles. There were evil Passions; there were a great many species of Cares; there were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows; there were Diseases, in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes; there were more kinds of Naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about. In short, everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box, and given to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept safely, in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them. Had they been faithful to their trust, all would have gone well. No grown person would ever have been sad, nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear, from that hour until this moment. But—and you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole-94- world—by Pandora\u0027s lifting the lid of that miserable box, and by the fault of Epimetheus, too, in not preventing her, these Troubles have obtained a foothold among us, and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry. For it was impossible, as you will easily guess, that the two children should keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage. On the contrary, the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows, in hopes of getting rid of them; and, sure enough, away flew the winged Troubles all abroad, and so pestered and tormented the small people, everywhere about, that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterwards. And, what was very singular, all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth, not one of which had hitherto faded, now began to droop and shed their leaves, after a day or two. The children, moreover, who before seemed immortal in their childhood, now grew older, day by day, and came soon to be youths and maidens, and men and women by and by, and aged people, before they dreamed of such a thing. Meanwhile, the naughty Pandora, and hardly less naughty Epimetheus, remained in their cottage. Both of them had been grievously stung, and were in a good deal of pain, which seemed the more intolerable to them, because it was the very first pain that had ever been felt since the world began. Of course, they were entirely unaccustomed to it, and could have no idea what it meant. Besides all this, they were in exceedingly bad humor, both with themselves and with one another. In order to indulge it to the utmost, Epimetheus-95- sat down sullenly in a corner with his back towards Pandora; while Pandora flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal and abominable box. She was crying bitterly, and sobbing as if her heart would break. Suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid. \"What can that be?\" cried Pandora, lifting her head. But either Epimetheus had not heard the tap, or was too much out of humor to notice it. At any rate, he made no answer. \"You are very unkind,\" said Pandora, sobbing anew, \"not to speak to me!\" Again the tap! It sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairy\u0027s hand, knocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box. \"Who are you?\" asked Pandora, with a little of her former curiosity. \"Who are you, inside of this naughty box?\" A sweet little voice spoke from within,— \"Only lift the lid, and you shall see.\" \"No, no,\" answered Pandora, again beginning to sob, \"I have had enough of lifting the lid! You are inside of the box, naughty creature, and there you shall stay! There are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world. You need never think that I shall be so foolish as to let you out!\" She looked towards Epimetheus, as she spoke, perhaps expecting that he would commend her for her wisdom. But the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late.-96- \"Ah,\" said the sweet little voice again, \"you had much better let me out. I am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their tails. They are no brothers and sisters of mine, as you would see at once, if you were only to get a glimpse of me. Come, come, my pretty Pandora! I am sure you will let me out!\" And, indeed, there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone, that made it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice asked. Pandora\u0027s heart had insensibly grown lighter at every word that came from within the box. Epimetheus, too, though still in the corner, had turned half round, and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before. \"My dear Epimetheus,\" cried Pandora, \"have you heard this little voice?\" \"Yes, to be sure I have,\" answered he, but in no very good humor as yet. \"And what of it?\" \"Shall I lift the lid again?\" asked Pandora. \"Just as you please,\" said Epimetheus. \"You have done so much mischief already, that perhaps you may as well do a little more. One other Trouble, in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world, can make no very great difference.\" \"You might speak a little more kindly!\" murmured Pandora, wiping her eyes. \"Ah, naughty boy!\" cried the little voice within the box, in an arch and laughing tone. \"He knows he is longing to see me. Come, my dear Pandora, lift up the lid. I am in a great hurry to comfort you. Only let me have some fresh air,-97- and you shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal as you think them!\" \"Epimetheus,\" exclaimed Pandora, \"come what may, I am resolved to open the box!\" \"And as the lid seems very heavy,\" cried Epimetheus, running across the room, \"I will help you!\" So, with one consent, the two children again lifted the lid. Out flew a sunny and smiling little personage, and hovered about the room, throwing a light wherever she went. Have you never made the sunshine dance into dark corners, by reflecting it from a bit of looking-glass? Well, so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairy-like stranger, amid the gloom of the cottage. She flew to Epimetheus, and laid the least touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the Trouble had stung him, and immediately the anguish of it was gone. Then she kissed Pandora on the forehead, and her hurt was cured likewise. After performing these good offices, the bright stranger fluttered sportively over the children\u0027s heads, and looked so sweetly at them, that they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened the box, since, otherwise, their cheery guest must have been kept a prisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails. \"Pray, who are you, beautiful creature?\" inquired Pandora. \"I am to be called Hope!\" answered the sunshiny figure. \"And because I am such a cheery little body, I was packed into the box, to make amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly-98- Troubles, which was destined to be let loose among them. Never fear! we shall do pretty well in spite of them all.\" \"Your wings are colored like the rainbow!\" exclaimed Pandora. \"How very beautiful!\" \"Yes, they are like the rainbow,\" said Hope, \"because, glad as my nature is, I am partly made of tears as well as smiles.\" \"And will you stay with us,\" asked Epimetheus, \"forever and ever?\" \"As long as you need me,\" said Hope, with her pleasant smile,—\"and that will be as long as you live in the world,—I promise never to desert you. There may come times and seasons, now and then, when you will think that I have utterly vanished. But again, and again, and again, when perhaps you least dream of it, you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage. Yes, my dear children, and I know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter!\" \"Oh, tell us,\" they exclaimed,—\"tell us what it is!\" \"Do not ask me,\" replied Hope, putting her finger on her rosy mouth. \"But do not despair, even if it should never happen while you live on this earth. Trust in my promise, for it is true.\" \"We do trust you!\" cried Epimetheus and Pandora, both in one breath. And so they did; and not only they, but so has everybody trusted Hope, that has since been alive. And to tell you the truth, I cannot help being glad—(though, to be sure, it was an un-99-commonly naughty thing for her to do)—but I cannot help being glad that our foolish Pandora peeped into the box. No doubt—no doubt—the Troubles are still flying about the world, and have increased in multitude, rather than lessened, and are a very ugly set of imps, and carry most venomous stings in their tails. I have felt them already, and expect to feel them more, as I grow older. But then that lovely and lightsome little figure of Hope! What in the world could we do without her? Hope spiritualizes the earth; Hope makes it always new; and, even in the earth\u0027s best and brightest aspect, Hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite bliss hereafter. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84526.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
