{"id":19016,"no":36,"title":"BELLEROPHON SLAYS THE CHIM?RA","content":"\"Well-a-day!\" thought the poor king; \"the Chim?ra is certainly coming to devour me!\" Meanwhile Pegasus had again paused in the air, and neighed angrily, while sparkles of a pure crystal flame darted out of his eyes. How unlike the lurid fire of the Chim?ra! The aerial steed\u0027s spirit was all aroused, and so was that of Bellerophon. \"Dost thou bleed, my immortal horse?\" cried the young man, caring less for his own hurt than for the anguish of this glorious creature, that ought never to have tasted pain. \"The execrable Chim?ra shall pay for this mischief with his last head!\" Then he shook the bridle, shouted loudly, and guided Pegasus, not aslantwise as before, but straight at the monster\u0027s hideous front. So rapid was the onset, that it seemed but a dazzle and a flash before Bellerophon was at close gripes with his enemy. The Chim?ra, by this time, after losing its second head, had got into a red-hot passion of pain and rampant rage. It so flounced about, half on earth and partly in the air, that it was impossible to say which element it rested upon. It opened its snake-jaws to such an abominable-202- width, that Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of flame, singeing the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man\u0027s golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot. But this was nothing to what followed. When the airy rush of the winged horse had brought him within the distance of a hundred yards, the Chim?ra gave a spring, and flung its huge, awkward, venomous, and utterly detestable carcass right upon poor Pegasus, clung round him with might and main, and tied up its snaky tail into a knot! Up flew the aerial steed, higher, higher, higher, above the mountain-peaks, above the clouds, and almost out of sight of the solid earth. But still the earth-born monster kept its hold, and was borne upward, along with the creature of light and air. Bellerophon, meanwhile, turning about, found himself face to face with the ugly grimness of the Chim?ra\u0027s visage, and could only avoid being scorched to death, or bitten right in twain, by holding up his shield. Over the upper edge of the shield, he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster. But the Chim?ra was so mad and wild with pain, that it did not guard itself so well as might else have been the case. Perhaps, after all, the best way to fight a Chim?ra is by getting as close to it as you can. In its efforts to stick its hor-203-rible iron claws into its enemy, the creature left its own breast quite exposed; and perceiving this, Bellerophon thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel heart. Immediately the snaky tail untied its knot. The monster let go its hold of Pegasus, and fell from that vast height, downward; while the fire within its bosom, instead of being put out, burned fiercer than ever, and quickly began to consume the dead carcass. Thus it fell out of the sky, all a-flame, and (it being nightfall before it reached the earth) was mistaken for a shooting star or a comet. But, at early sunrise, some cottagers were going to their day\u0027s labor, and saw, to their astonishment, that several acres of ground were strewn with black ashes. In the middle of a field, there was a heap of whitened bones, a great deal higher than a haystack. Nothing else was ever seen of the dreadful Chim?ra! And when Bellerophon had won the victory, he bent forward and kissed Pegasus, while the tears stood in his eyes. \"Back now, my beloved steed!\" said he. \"Back to the Fountain of Pirene!\" Pegasus skimmed through the air, quicker than ever he did before, and reached the fountain in a very short time. And there he found the old man leaning on his staff, and the country fellow watering his cow, and the pretty maiden filling her pitcher. \"I remember now,\" quoth the old man, \"I saw this winged horse once before, when I was quite a lad. But he was ten times handsomer in those days.\"-204- \"I own a cart-horse, worth three of him!\" said the country fellow. \"If this pony were mine, the first thing I should do would be to clip his wings!\" But the poor maiden said nothing, for she had always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time. So she ran away, and let her pitcher tumble down, and broke it. \"Where is the gentle child,\" asked Bellerophon, \"who used to keep me company, and never lost his faith, and never was weary of gazing into the fountain?\" \"Here am I, dear Bellerophon!\" said the child, softly. For the little boy had spent day after day, on the margin of Pirene, waiting for his friend to come back; but when he perceived Bellerophon descending through the clouds, mounted on the winged horse, he had shrunk back into the shrubbery. He was a delicate and tender child, and dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow should see the tears gushing from his eyes. \"Thou hast won the victory,\" said he, joyfully, running to the knee of Bellerophon, who still sat on the back of Pegasus. \"I knew thou wouldst.\" \"Yes, dear child!\" replied Bellerophon, alighting from the winged horse. \"But if thy faith had not helped me, I should never have waited for Pegasus, and never have gone up above the clouds, and never have conquered the terrible Chim?ra. Thou, my beloved little friend, hast done it all. And now let us give Pegasus his liberty.\"-205- So he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the head of the marvelous steed. \"Be free, forevermore, my Pegasus!\" cried he, with a shade of sadness in his tone. \"Be as free as thou art fleet!\" But Pegasus rested his head on Bellerophon\u0027s shoulder, and would not be persuaded to take flight. \"Well then,\" said Bellerophon, caressing the airy horse, \"thou shalt be with me, as long as thou wilt; and we will go together, forthwith, and tell King Iobates that the Chim?ra is destroyed.\" Then Bellerophon embraced the gentle child, and promised to come to him again, and departed. But, in after years, that child took higher flights upon the aerial steed than ever did Bellerophon, and achieved more honorable deeds than his friend\u0027s victory over the Chim?ra. For, gentle and tender as he was, he grew to be a mighty poet! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3057/84543.html","bookId":1007,"book":{"id":1007,"title":"A Wonder Book for Girls \u0026 Boys","description":"简介： THE author has long been of opinion that many of the classical myths were capable of being rendered into very capital reading for children.
