{"id":97566,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"There\u0027s Barony.\"\n Idaho had converted him to the old Harkonnen name for the sprawling city with its giant black centerpiece of plasteel.\n \"We\u0027ll land on the Flat to the north.\"\n He spoke the words but his hands gave the orders.\n Quickly now!\n For brief moments when they disgorged troops, no-ships were visible and vulnerable. He held elements of the entire force responsive to his comboard and responsibility was heavy.\n \"This is only a feint. We go in and out after inflicting serious damage. Junction is our real target.\"\n Odrade\u0027s parting admonition lay there in memory. \"Honored Matres must be taught a lesson such as never before. Attack us and you get hurt badly. Press us and the pain can be enormous. They\u0027ve heard about Bene Gesserit punishments. We\u0027re notorious. No doubt Spider Queen sniggered a bit. You must shove that snigger down her throat!\"\n \"Quit ship!\"\n This was the vulnerable moment. Space above them remained empty of threat but fire lances arced inward from the east. His gunners could handle those. He concentrated on the possibility that enemy no-ships might return for a suicide attack. Command bay projections showed his hammerships and troop carriers pouring from the holds. The shock force, an armored elite on suspensors, already had the perimeter secured.\n There went the portable comeyes to spread his field of observation and relay the intimate details of violence. Communication, the key to responsive command, but it also displayed bloody destruction.\n \"All clear!\"\n The signal rang through the bay.\n He lifted off the Flat and repositioned in full invisibility. Now, only the comlinks gave defenders a clue to his position and that was masked by decoy relays.\n Projection displayed the monstrous rectangle of the ancient Harkonnen center. It had been built as a block of light-absorbing metal to confine slaves. The elite had lived in garden mansions on top. Honored Matres had returned it to its former oppression.\n Three of his giant hammerships came into view.\n \"Clear the top of that thing!\" he ordered. \"Wipe it clean but do as little damage as possible to the structure.\"\n He knew his words were superfluous but spoke for the release. Everyone in the attack force knew what he wanted.\n \"Relay reports!\" he ordered.\n Information began flowing from the horseshoe on his shoulders. He brought it up on secondary. Comeyes showed his troops clearing the perimeter. Battle overhead and on the ground was well in hand for at least fifty klicks out. Going far better than he had expected. So Honored Matres kept their heavy stuff off-planet, not anticipating bold attack. A familiar attitude and he had Idaho to thank for predicting it.\n \"They\u0027re power-blind. They think heavy armor is for space and only light stuff for the ground. Heavy weapons are brought down as needed. No sense keeping them on planet. Takes too much energy. Besides, awareness of all that heavy stuff up there has a quieting effect on captive populations.\"\n Idaho\u0027s concepts of weaponry were devastating.\n \"We tend to fix our minds on what we believe we know. A projectile is a projectile even when miniaturized to contain poisons or biologicals.\"\n Innovations in protective equipment improved mobility. Built into uniforms where possible. And Idaho had brought back the shield with its awesome destruction when struck by a lasgun beam. Shields on suspensors hidden in what appeared to be soldiers (but were actually inflated uniforms) spread out ahead of troops. Lasgun fire at them produced clean atomics to clear large areas.\n Will Junction be this easy?\n Teg doubted it. Necessity enforced quick adaptation to new methods.\n They could have shields on Junction in two days.\n And no inhibitions about how to employ them.\n Shields had dominated the Old Empire, he knew, because of that oddly important set of words called \"Great Convention.\" Honorable people did not misuse weapons of their feudal society. If you dishonored the Convention, your peers turned against you with united violence. More than that, there had been the intangible, \"Face,\" that some called \"Pride.\"\n Face! My position in the pack.\n More important to some than life itself.\n \"This is costing us very little,\" Streggi said.\n She was becoming quite the battle analyst and much too banal for Teg\u0027s liking. Streggi meant they were losing few lives but perhaps she spoke truer than she knew.\n \"It\u0027s difficult to think of cheap devices doing the job,\" Idaho had said. \"But that\u0027s a powerful weapon.\"\n If your weapons cost only a small fraction of the energy your enemy spent, you had a potent lever that could prevail against seemingly overwhelming odds. Prolong the conflict and you wasted enemy substance. Your foe toppled because control of production and workers was lost.\n \"We can begin to pull out,\" he said turning away from the projections as his hands repeated the order. \"I want casualty reports as soon as -\" He broke off and turned at a sudden stir.\n Murbella?\n Her projection was repeated in all of the bay\u0027s fields. Her voice blared from the images: \"Why are you disregarding reports from your perimeter?\" She overrode his board and the projections displayed a field commander caught in mid-sentence: \"... orders, I will have to deny their request.\"\n \"Repeat,\" Murbella said.\n The field commander\u0027s sweaty features turned toward his mobile comeye. The comsystem compensated and he appeared to look directly into Teg\u0027s eyes.\n \"Repeating: I have self-styled refugees here asking for asylum. Their leader says he has an agreement requiring the Sisterhood to honor his request but without orders...\"\n \"Who is he?\" Teg demanded.\n \"He calls himself Rabbi.\"\n Teg moved to resume control of his comboard. \"I don\u0027t know of any -\"\n \"Wait!\" Murbella overrode his board.\n How does she do that?\n Again her voice filled the bay. \"Bring him and his party to the flagship. Make it quick.\" She silenced the perimeter relay.\n Teg was outraged but at a disadvantage. He chose one of the multiple images and glared at it. \"How dare you interfere?\"\n \"Because you don\u0027t have the proper data. The Rabbi is within his rights. Prepare to receive him with honors.\"\n \"Explain.\"\n \"No! There\u0027s no need for you to know. But it was proper for me to make this decision when I saw you were not responding.\"\n \"That commander was in a diversionary area! Not important to -\"\n \"But the Rabbi\u0027s request has priority.\"\n \"You\u0027re as bad as Mother Superior!\"\n \"Perhaps worse. Now hear me! Get those refugees into your flagship. And prepare to receive me.\"\n \"Absolutely not! You are to stay where you are!\"\n \"Bashar! There\u0027s something about this request that demands a Reverend Mother\u0027s attention. He says they are in peril because they gave temporary sanctuary to the Reverend Mother Lucilla. Accept this or step down.\"\n \"Then let me get my people aboard and pull back first. We\u0027ll rendezvous when we\u0027re clear.\"\n \"Agreed. But treat those refugees with courtesy.\"\n \"Now, get off my projections. You\u0027ve blinded me and that was foolish!\"\n \"You have everything well in hand, Bashar. During this hiatus another of our ships accepted four Futars. They came asking that we take them to Handlers but I ordered them confined. Treat them with extreme caution.\"\n The bay\u0027s projections resumed battle status. Teg once more called in his force. He was seething and it was minutes before he restored a sense of command. Did Murbella know how she undermined his authority? Or should he take this as a measure of the importance she attached to the refugees?\n When the situation was secure, he turned the bay over to an aide and, riding on Streggi\u0027s shoulders, went to see these important refugees. What was so vital about them that Murbella risked interference?\n They were in a troop-carrier hold, a congealed party held apart by a cautious commander.\n Who knows what may be concealed among these unknowns?\n The Rabbi, identifiable because he was being deferred to by the field commander, stood with a brown-robed woman at the near side of his people. He was a small, bearded man wearing a white skullcap. Cold light made him appear ancient. The woman shielded her eyes with a hand. The Rabbi was speaking and his words became audible as Teg approached.\n The woman was under verbal attack!\n \"The prideful one will be brought low!\"\n Without removing her hand from its defensive position, the woman said: \"I am not proud of what I carry.\"\n \"Nor of the powers this knowledge may bring you?\"\n With knee pressure, Teg ordered Streggi to stop them about ten paces away. His commander glanced at Teg but stayed in position, ready to act defensively if this should prove to be a diversion.\n Good man.\n The woman bent her head even lower and pressed her hand against her eyes when she spoke. \"Are we not offered knowledge that we might use it in holy service?\"\n \"Daughter!\" The Rabbi held himself stiffly erect. \"Whatever we may learn that we may better serve, it never can be a great thing. All we call knowledge, were it to encompass everything a humble heart could hold, all of that would be no more than one seed in the furrows. \"\n Teg felt reluctant to interfere. What an archaic way of speaking. This pair fascinated him. The other refugees listened to the exchange with rapt attention. Only Teg\u0027s field commander appeared aloof, keeping his attention on the strangers and giving an occasional hand-signal to aides.\n The woman kept her head respectfully lowered and the shielding hand in place but she still defended herself. \"Even a seed lost in the furrows may bring forth life.\"\n The Rabbi\u0027s lips tightened into a grim line, then: \"Without water and care, which is to say, without the blessing and the word, there is no life. \"\n A great sigh shook the woman\u0027s shoulders but she held herself in that oddly submissive position when she responded: \"Rabbi, I hear and obey. Still, I must honor this knowledge that has been thrust upon me because it contains the very admonition you have just voiced.\"\n The Rabbi placed a hand on her shoulder. \"Then convey it to those who want it and may no evil enter where you go.\"\n Silence told Teg the argument had ended. He urged Streggi forward. Before she could move, Murbella strode past and nodded to the Rabbi while keeping her gaze on the woman.\n \"In the name of the Bene Gesserit and our debt to you, I welcome you and give you sanctuary,\" Murbella said.\n The brown-robed woman lowered her hand and Teg saw contact lenses glittering in the palm. She lifted her head then and there were gasps all around. The woman\u0027s eyes were the total blue of spice addiction but they also held that inner force marking one who had survived the Agony.\n Murbella made instant identification. A wild Reverend Mother! Not since Dune\u0027s Fremen days had one of these been known.\n The woman curtsied to Murbella. \"I am called Rebecca. And I am filled with joy to be with you. The Rabbi thinks I am a silly goose but I have a golden egg for I carry Lampadas: seven million six hundred twenty-two thousand and fourteen Reverend Mothers and they are rightfully yours.\"\n Answers are a perilous grip on the universe. They can appear sensible yet explain nothing.\n - The Zensunni Whip\n As the wait for their promised escort lengthened, Odrade became first angry and then amused. Finally, she began following lobby robos, interfering with their movements. Most were small and none appeared humanoid.\n Functional. Hallmark of Ixian servos. Busy, busy, busy little accompaniments to a sojourn at Junction or its equivalent anywhere.\n They were so commonplace that few people noticed them. Since they were not capable of dealing with deliberate interference, they subsided into motionless humming.\n \"Honored Matres have little or no sense of humor.\" I know, Murbella. I know. But do they get my message?\n Dortujla obviously did. She came out of her funk and watched these antics with a wide grin. Tam looked disapproving but tolerant. Suipol was delighted. Odrade had to restrain her from helping to immobilize the devices.\n Let me do the antagonizing, child. I know what is in store for me.\n When she was sure she had made her point, Odrade took a position under one of the chandeliers.\n \"Attend me, Tam,\" she said.\n Tamalane obediently placed herself in front of Odrade with an attentive expression.\n \"Have you noticed, Tam, that modern lobbies tend to be quite small?\"\n Tamalane spared a glance for her surroundings.\n \"Lobbies once were large,\" Odrade said. \"To provide a prestigious feeling of space for the powerful, and impressing others with your importance, of course.\"\n Tamalane caught the spirit of Odrade\u0027s playlet and said: \"These days you\u0027re important if you travel at all.\"\n Odrade looked at the immobilized robos scattered across the lobby floor. Some hummed and jittered. Others waited quietly for someone or some thing to restore order.\n The autoreceptionist, a phallic tube of black plaz with a single glittering comeye, came out from behind its cage and picked its way through the stalled robos to confront Odrade.\n \"Much too humid today.\" It had a soupy feminine voice. \"Don\u0027t know what Weather is thinking of.\"\n Odrade spoke past it to Tamalane. \"Why do they have to program these mechanicals to simulate friendly humans?\"\n \"It\u0027s obscene,\" Tamalane agreed. She forcibly shouldered the autoreceptionist aside and it swiveled to study the source of this intrusion but made no other move.\n Odrade was suddenly aware she had touched on the force that had powered the Butlerian Jihad - mob motivation.\n My own prejudice!\n She studied the mechanical confronting them. Was it waiting for instructions or must she address the thing directly?\n Four more robos entered the lobby and Odrade recognized her party\u0027s luggage piled on them.\n All of our things carefully inspected, I\u0027m sure. Search where you will. We carry no hint of our legions.\n The four scurried along the edge of the room and found their passage blocked by the ones rendered motionless. The luggage robos stopped and waited for this unique state of affairs to be sorted out. Odrade smiled at them. \"There go the signs of the transient concealing our secret selves.\"\n Concealing and secret.\n Words to annoy the watchers.\n Come on, Tam! You know the ploy. Confuse that enormous content of unconsciousness, arouse feelings of guilt they will be incapable of recognizing. Give them the jitters the way I did with the robos. Make them wary. What are the real powers of these Bene Gesserit witches?\n Tamalane took her cue. Transients and secret selves. She explained for the comeyes in tones one used with children. \"What do you carry when you leave your nest? Are you one who tries to pack it all? Or do you prune to necessities?\"\n What would the watchers classify as necessities? Tools of hygiene and washable or replaceable clothing? Weapons? They sought those in our luggage. But Reverend Mothers tend not to carry visible weapons.\n \"What an ugly place this is,\" Dortujla said, joining Tamalane in front of Odrade and picking up on the drama. \"You would almost think it deliberate.\"\n Ahhh, you nasty watchers. Observe Dortujla. Remember her? Why has she returned when she must know what you might do to her? Food for Futars? See how little that concerns her?\n \"A transition point, Dortujla,\" Odrade said. \"Most people would never want this as their destination. An inconvenience, and the small discomforts serve only to remind you of that.\"\n \"A wayside stop, and it will never be much more unless they completely rebuild,\" Dortujla said.\n Would they hear? Odrade aimed a look of utter composure at the selected comeye.\n This is ugliness that betrays intent. It says to us: \"We will provide something for the stomach, a bed, a place to evacuate bladder and bowels, a place to conduct the little maintenance rituals flesh requires, but you will be gone quickly because all we really want is the energy you leave behind.\"\n The autoreceptionist backed around Tamalane and Dortujla, once more trying to make contact with Odrade.\n \"You will send us to our quarters immediately!\" Odrade said, glaring into the cyclopean eye.\n \"Dear me! We\u0027ve been inconsiderate.\"\n Where had they found that syrupy voice? Repulsive. But Odrade was on her way out of the lobby in less than a minute, luggage on its robos ahead of them, Suipol close behind, Tamalane and Dortujla following.\n There was an air of neglect to one wing clearly visible as they passed it. Did that mean Junction\u0027s traffic had declined? Interesting. Shutters had been sealed along an entire corridor. Hiding something? In the resulting gloom she detected dust on floor and ledges with only a few tracks of maintenance mechs. Concealment of what lay outside those windows? Unlikely. This had been closed off for some time.\n She detected a pattern in what was being maintained. Very little traffic. Honored Matre effect. Who dared move around much when it felt safer to dig in and pray you would not be noticed by dangerous prowlers? Access lanes to elite private quarters were being kept up. Only the best was being maintained at its best.\n When Gammu\u0027s refugees arrive, there will be room.\n In the lobby, a robo had handed Suipol a guide pulser. \"To find your way later.\" Round blue ball with a yellow arrow floating in it to point your chosen way. \"Rings a tiny bell when you arrive.\"\n The pulser\u0027s tiny bell rang.\n And where have we arrived?\n Another place where their hosts had provided \"every luxury\" while keeping it repellent. Rooms with soft yellow floors, pale mauve walls, white ceilings. No chairdogs. Be thankful for that even though the absence spoke of economics rather than care for a guest\u0027s preferences. Chairdogs required sustenance and expensive staff. She saw furnishings with permaflox fabrics. And behind the fabrics she felt plastic resilience. Everything done in the other colors of the rooms.\n The bed was a small shock. Someone had taken the request for a hard mat too literally. Flat surface of black plaz without cushion. No bedding.\n Suipol, seeing this, started to object but Odrade silenced her. Despite Bene Gesserit resources, comfort sometimes fell by the wayside. Get the job done! That was their first order. If Mother Superior had to sleep occasionally on a hard surface without covers, this could be passed off in the name of duty. Besides, the Bene Gesserit had ways of adjusting to such inconsequentials. Odrade steeled herself to discomfort, aware that if she objected she might find another deliberate insult.\n Let them add this to all of that unconscious content and worry about it.\n Her summons came while she was inspecting the rest of their quarters, displaying minimal concern and open amusement. A voice piped through ceiling vents intruded as Odrade and her companions emerged into the common sitting room: \"Return to the lobby where you will meet your escort to Great Honored Matre.\"\n \"I will go alone,\" Odrade said, silencing objections.\n A green-robed Honored Matre waited on a fragile chair where the corridor entered the lobby. She had a face built up like a castle wall - stone laid on stone. Mouth a watergate through which she inhaled some liquid via a transparent straw. Flow of purple up the straw. Sugar odor in the liquid. The eyes were weapons peeking over ramparts. Nose: a slope down which eyes dispatched their hatred. Chin: weak. Not necessary, that chin. An afterthought. Something left over from earlier construction. You could see the infant in it. And hair: artificially darkened to muddy brown. Unimportant. Eyes, nose, and mouth, those were important.\n The woman stood slowly, insolently, emphasizing what a favor she did merely by noticing Odrade.\n \"Great Honored Matre agrees to see you.\"\n Heavy, almost masculine voice. Pride walled up so high she exposed it whatever she did. Packed solid with immovable prejudice. She knew so many things she was a walking display of ignorance and fears. Odrade saw her as a perfect demonstration of Honored Matre vulnerability.\n At the end of many turnings and corridors, all of them bright and clean, they came to a long room - sun pouring in a line of windows, sophisticated military console at one end; space maps and terrain maps projected there. Center of Spider Queen\u0027s web? Odrade entertained doubts. Console too obvious. Something of different design from the Scattering but no mistaking its purpose. Fields that humans could manipulate had physical limits, and a hood for mental interface could be nothing else even though it was a towering oval shape and a peculiar dirty yellow.\n She swept her gaze over the room. Sparsely furnished. A few slingchairs and small tables, a large open area where (presumably) people could await orders. No clutter. This was supposed to be an action center.\n Impress that upon the witch!\n Windows on one long wall revealed flagstones and gardens beyond. This whole thing was a set piece!\n Where is Spider Queen? Where does she sleep? What is the appearance of her lair?\n Two women came in through an arched doorway from the flagstones. Both wore red robes with glittering arabesques and dragon shapes on them. Soostones shattered for decorations.\n Odrade held her silence, exercising caution until after introductions by the escort, who uttered as few words as possible and left hurriedly.\n Without Murbella\u0027s hints, the tall one standing beside Spider Queen was the one Odrade would have taken for commander. But it was the smaller one. Fascinating.\n This one did not just climb to power. She sneaked between the cracks. One day, her Sisters awoke to accomplished fact. There she was, firmly seated at the center. And who could object? Ten minutes after leaving her you would have difficulty remembering the target of your objections.\n The two women examined Odrade with equal intensity.\n Well and good. That is needed at this moment.\n Spider Queen\u0027s appearance was more than a surprise. Until this moment, no physical description of her had been achieved by the Bene Gesserit. Only temporary projections, imaginative constructs based on scattered bits of evidence. Here she was, finally. A small woman. Expected stringy muscles visible under red leotards beneath her robe. Face a forgettable oval with bland brown eyes, orange flecks dancing in them.\n Fearful and angered by it but cannot place the precise reasons for her fear. All she has is a target - me. What does she think to gain from me?\n The aide was something else: in appearance, far more dangerous. Golden hair so carefully coiffed, slight hook to the nose, thin lips, skin stretched tightly over high cheekbones. And that venomous glare.\n Odrade passed her gaze once more over Spider Queen\u0027s features: a nose that some would have trouble describing a minute after leaving her.\n Straight? Well, somewhat.\n Eyebrows a match to straw-colored hair. The mouth opened to become pinkly visible and almost vanished when closed. It was a face in which you had difficulty finding a central focus and thus the entire thing became blurred.\n \"So you lead the Bene Gesserit.\"\n Voice equally low-key. Oddly inflected Galach and no jargon, yet you sensed it just behind her tongue. Linguistic tricks were there. Murbella\u0027s knowledge emphasized that.\n \"They have something close to Voice. Not the equal of what you gave me but there are other things they do, word tricks of a sort.\"\n Word tricks.\n \"How should I address you?\" Odrade asked.\n \"I hear you call me the Spider Queen.\" Orange flecks dancing viciously in her eyes.\n \"Here at the center of your web and considering your vast powers, I\u0027m afraid I must confess to it.\"\n \"So that is what you notice - my powers.\" Vain!\n The first thing Odrade actually had marked was the woman\u0027s smell. She was bathed in some outrageous perfume.\n Covering up pheromones?\n Warned about Bene Gesserit ability to judge on the basis of minuscule sense data? Perhaps. Just as probable she preferred this perfume. The odious concoction had about it an underlying hint of exotic flowers. Something from her homeland?\n The Spider Queen put a hand to her forgettable chin. \"You may call me Dama.\"\n The companion objected. \"This is the last enemy in the Million Planets!\"\n So that\u0027s how they think of the Old Empire.\n Dama held up a hand for silence. How casual and how revealing. Odrade saw a luster reminiscent of Bellonda in the aide\u0027s eyes. Viciousness watchful in there and looking for places to attack.\n \"Most are required to address me as Great Honored Matre,\" Dama said. \"I have conferred an honor upon you.\" She gestured toward the arched doorway behind her. \"We will walk outside, just the two of us, while we talk.\"\n No invitation; it was a command.\n Odrade paused beside the door to look at a map displayed there. Black on white, little lines of paths and irregular outlines with labels in Galach. It was the gardens beyond the flagstones, identification of plantings. Odrade bent close to study it while Dama waited with amused tolerance. Yes, esoteric trees and bushes, very few bearing edible fruits. Pride of possession and this map was here to emphasize it.\n On the patio, Odrade said: \"I noticed your perfume.\"\n Dama was thrown back into memories and her voice carried subtle undertones when she responded.\n Floral identity marker for her own flamebush. Imagine that! But she is both sad and angry when she thinks of this. And she wonders why I bring it to attention.\n \"Otherwise, the bush would not have accepted me,\" Dama said.\n Interesting choice of verb tense.\n The accented Galach was not hard to understand. She obviously adjusted unconsciously for the listener.\n Good ear. Spends a few seconds, watching, listening and adjusts to make herself understood. Very old art form that most humans adopt quickly.\n Odrade saw the origins as protective coloration.\n Don\u0027t want to be taken for an alien.\n An adjustable characteristic built into the genes. Honored Matres had not lost it but this was a vulnerability. Unconscious tonalities were not completely covered and they revealed much.\n Despite her blatant vanity, Dama was intelligent and self-disciplined. It was a pleasure to come to that opinion. Certain circumlocutions were not necessary.\n Odrade stopped where Dama stopped at the edge of the patio. They stood almost shoulder to shoulder and Odrade, gazing outward at the garden, was struck by the almost Bene Gesserit appearance.\n \"Speak your piece,\" Dama said.\n \"What value do I have as a hostage?\" Odrade asked.\n Orange glare!\n \"You\u0027ve obviously asked the question,\" Odrade said.\n \"Do continue.\" Orange subsiding.\n \"The Sisterhood has three replacements for me.\" Odrade produced her most penetrating stare. \"It is possible for us to weaken each other in ways that would destroy us both.\"\n \"We could crush you as we would swat an insect!\"\n Beware the orange!\n Odrade was not deflected by warnings from within. \"But the hand that swatted us would fester, and eventually, sickness would consume you.\"\n It could not be stated plainer without specific details.\n \"Impossible!\" An orange glare.\n \"Do you think us unaware of how you were driven back here by your enemies?\"\n My most dangerous gambit.\n Odrade watched it take effect. A dark scowl was not Dama\u0027s only visible response. Orange vanished, leaving her eyes an oddly bland discrepancy on the glowering face.\n Odrade nodded as though Dama had answered. \"We could leave you vulnerable to those who assail you, those who drove you into this cul de sac.\"\n \"You think we...\"\n \"We know.\"\n At least, now I know.\n The knowledge produced both elation and fear.\n What is out there to subdue these women? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-27.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) \n The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
