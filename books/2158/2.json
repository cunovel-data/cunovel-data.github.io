She caught the reference immediately. \"The ecological circle.\"\\n\\n He turned and looked up at her, waiting.\\n\\n \"Enclosed,\" she said. \"How tempting it is to raise high walls and keep out change. Rot here in our own self-satisfied comfort.\"\\n\\n Her words filled him with disquiet. He felt he had heard them before... some other place with a different woman holding his hand.\\n\\n \"Enclosures of any kind are a fertile breeding ground for hatred of outsiders,\" she said. \"That produces a bitter harvest.\"\\n\\n Not exactly the same words but the same lesson.\\n\\n He walked slowly beside Odrade, his hand sweaty in hers.\\n\\n \"Why are you so silent, Miles?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re farmers,\" he said. \"That\u0027s really what you Bene Gesserit do. \"\\n\\n She saw immediately what had happened, Mentat training coming out in him without his knowing. Best not explore that yet. \"We are concerned about everything that grows, Miles. It was perceptive of you to see this.\"\\n\\n As they parted, she to return to her tower, he to his quarters in the school section, Odrade said: \" I will tell your Proctors to place more emphasis on subtle uses of power.\"\\n\\n He misunderstood. \"I\u0027m already training with lasguns. They say I\u0027m very good.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve heard. But there are weapons you cannot hold in your hands. You can only hold them in your mind.\"\\n\\n Rules build up fortifications behind which small minds create satrapies. A perilous state of affairs in the best of times, disastrous during crises.\\n\\n - Bene Gesserit Coda\\n\\n Stygian blackness in Great Honored Matre\u0027s sleeping chamber. Logno, a Grand Dame and senior aide to the High One, entered from the unlighted hallway as she had been summoned to do and, seeing darkness, shuddered. These consultations with no illumination terrified her and she knew Great Honored Matre took pleasure from that. It could not be the only reason for darkness, though. Was Great Honored Matre fearful of attack? Several High Ones had been deposed in bed. No... not just that, although it might bear on the choice of setting.\\n\\n Grunts and moans in the darkness.\\n\\n Some Honored Matres snickered and said Great Honored Matre dared bed a Futar. Logno thought it possible. This Great Honored Matre dared many things. Had she not salvaged some of The Weapons from the disaster of the Scattering? Futars, though? The Sisters knew Futars could not be bonded by sex. At least not by sex with humans. That might be the way the Enemies of Many Faces did it, though. Who knew?\\n\\n There was a furry smell in the bedchamber. Logno closed the door behind her and waited. Great Honored Matre did not like to be interrupted in whatever she did there within shielding blackness. But she permits me to call her Dama.\\n\\n Another moan, then: \"Sit on the floor, Logno. Yes, there by the door. \"\\n\\n Does she really see me or only guess?\\n\\n Logno did not have the courage to test it. Poison. I\u0027ll get her that way someday. She\u0027s cautious but she can be distracted. Although her Sisters might sneer at it, poison was an accepted tool of succession... provided the successor possessed further ways to maintain ascendancy.\\n\\n \"Logno, those Ixians you spoke with today. What do they say of The Weapon?\"\\n\\n \"They do not understand its function, Dama. I did not tell them what it was.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not.\"\\n\\n \"Will you suggest again that Weapon and Charge be united?\"\\n\\n \"Are you sneering at me, Logno?\"\\n\\n \"Dama! I would never do such a thing.\"\\n\\n \"I hope not. \"\\n\\n Silence. Logno understood that they both considered the same problem. Only three hundred units of The Weapon survived the disaster. Each could be used only once, provided the Council (which held the Charge) agreed to arm them. Great Honored Matre, controlling The Weapon itself, had only half of that awful power. Weapon without Charge was merely a small black tube that could be held in the hand. With its Charge, it cut a brief swath of bloodless death across the arc of its limited range.\\n\\n \"The Ones of Many Faces,\" Great Honored Matre muttered.\\n\\n Logno nodded to the darkness where that muttering originated.\\n\\n Perhaps she can see me. I do not know what else she salvaged or what the Ixians may have provided her.\\n\\n And the Ones of Many Faces, curse them through eternity, had caused the disaster. Them and their Futars! The ease with which all but that handful of The Weapon had been confiscated! Awesome powers. We must arm ourselves well before we return to that battle. Dama is right.\\n\\n \"That planet - Buzzell,\" Great Honored Matre said. \"Are you sure it\u0027s not defended?\"\\n\\n \"We detect no defenses. Smugglers say it is not defended.\"\\n\\n \"But it is so rich in Soostones!\"\\n\\n \"Here in the Old Empire, people seldom dare attack the witches.\"\\n\\n \"I do not believe there are only a handful of them on that planet! It\u0027s a trap of some kind.\"\\n\\n \"That is always possible, Dama.\"\\n\\n I do not trust smugglers, Logno. Bond a few more of them and test this thing of Buzzell again. The witches may be weak but I do not think they are stupid.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Dama.\"\\n\\n \"Tell the Ixians they will displease us if they cannot duplicate The Weapon.\"\\n\\n \"But without the Charge, Dama...\\n\\n \"We will deal with that when we must. Now, leave.\"\\n\\n Logno heard a hissing \"Yessssss!\" as she let herself out. Even the darkness of the hallway was welcome after the bedchamber and she hurried toward the light.\\n\\n We tend to become like the worst in those we oppose.\\n\\n - Bene Gesserit Coda\\n\\n The water images again!\\n\\n We\u0027re turning this whole damned planet into a desert and I get water images!\\n\\n Odrade sat in her workroom, the usual morning clutter around her, and sensed Sea Child floating in the waves, washed by them, carried by them. The waves were the color of blood. Her Sea Child self anticipated bloody times.\\n\\n She knew where these images originated: the time before Reverend Mothers ruled her life; childhood in the beautiful home on the Gammu seacoast. Despite immediate worries, she could not prevent a smile. Oysters prepared by Papa. The stew she still preferred.\\n\\n What she remembered best of childhood was the sea excursions. Something about being afloat spoke to her most basic self. Lift and fall of waves, the sense of unbounded horizons with strange new places just beyond the curved limits of a watery world, that thrilling edge of danger implicit in the very substance that supported her. All of it combined to assure her she was Sea Child.\\n\\n Papa was calmer there, too. And Mama Sibia happier, face turned into the wind, dark hair blowing. A sense of balance radiated from those times, a reassuring message spoken in a language older than Odrade\u0027s oldest Other Memory. \"This is my place, my medium. I am Sea Child.\"\\n\\n Her personal concept of sanity came from those times. The ability to balance on strange seas. The ability to maintain your deepest self despite unexpected waves.\\n\\n Mama Sibia had given Odrade that ability long before the Reverend Mothers came and took away their \"hidden Atreides scion.\" Mama Sibia, only a foster mother, had taught Odrade to love herself.\\n\\n In a Bene Gesserit society where any form of love was suspect, this remained Odrade\u0027s ultimate secret.\\n\\n At root, I am happy with myself. I do not mind being alone. Not that any Reverend Mother was ever truly alone after the Spice Agony flooded her with Other Memories.\\n\\n But Mama Sibia and, yes, Papa, too, acting in loco parentis for the Bene Gesserit, had impressed a profound strength upon their charge during those hidden years. The Reverend Mothers had been reduced to amplifying that strength.\\n\\n Proctors had tried to root out Odrade\u0027s \"deep desire for personal affinities,\" but failed at last, not quite sure they had failed but always suspicious. They had sent her to Al Dhanab finally, a place deliberately maintained as a mimic of the worst in Salusa Secundus, there to be conditioned on a planet of constant testing. A place worse than Dune in some respects: high cliffs and dry gorges, hot winds and frigid winds, too little moisture and too much. The Sisterhood had thought of it as a proving ground for those destined to survive on Dune. But none of this had touched that secret core within Odrade. Sea Child remained intact.\\n\\n And it is Sea Child warning me now.\\n\\n Was it a prescient warning?\\n\\n She had always possessed this bit of talent, this little twitching that told of immediate peril to the Sisterhood. Atreides genes reminding her of their presence. Was it a threat to Chapterhouse? No... the ache she could not touch said it was others in danger. Important, though.\\n\\n Lampadas? Her bit of talent could not say.\\n\\n The Breeding Mistresses had tried to erase this dangerous prescience from their Atreides line but with limited success. \"We dare not risk another Kwisatz Haderach!\" They knew of this quirk in their Mother Superior, but Odrade\u0027s late predecessor, Taraza, had advised \"cautious use of her talent.\" It had been Taraza\u0027s view that Odrade\u0027s prescience worked only to warn of dangers to the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n Odrade agreed. She experienced unwanted moments when she glimpsed threats. Glimpses. And lately she dreamed.\\n\\n It was a vividly recurring dream, every sense attuned to the immediacy of this thing occurring in her mind. She walked across a chasm on a tightrope and someone (she dared not turn to see who) was coming from behind with an axe to cut the rope. She could feel the rough twists of fiber beneath bare feet. She felt a cold wind blowing, a smell of burning on that wind. And she knew the one with the axe approached!\\n\\n Each perilous step required all of her energy. Step! Step! The rope swayed and she stretched her arms out straight on each side, struggling for balance.\\n\\n If I fall, the Sisterhood falls!\\n\\n The Bene Gesserit would end in the chasm beneath the rope. As with any living thing, the Sisterhood must end sometime. A Reverend Mother dared not deny it.\\n\\n But not here. Not falling, the rope severed. We must not let the rope be cut! I must get across the chasm before the axe-wielder comes. \"I must! I must!\"\\n\\n The dream always ended there, her own voice ringing in her ears as she awoke in her sleeping chamber. Chilled. No perspiration. Even in the throes of nightmare, Bene Gesserit restraints did not permit unnecessary excesses.\\n\\n Body does not need perspiration? Body does not get perspiration.\\n\\n As she sat in her workroom remembering the dream, Odrade felt the depth of reality behind that metaphor of a slender rope: The delicate strand on which I carry the fate of my Sisterhood. Sea Child sensed the approaching nightmare and intruded with images of bloody waters. This was no trivial warning. Ominous. She wanted to stand and shout: \"Scatter into the weeds, my chicks! Run! Run!\"\\n\\n And wouldn\u0027t that shock the watchdogs!\\n\\n The duties of a Mother Superior required her to put a good face on her tremors and act as though nothing mattered except the formal decisions in front of her. Panic must be avoided! Not that any of her immediate decisions were truly trivial in these times. But calm demeanor was required.\\n\\n Some of her chicks already were running, gone off into the unknown. Shared lives in Other Memory. The rest of her chicks here on Chapterhouse would know when to run. When we are discovered. Their behavior would be governed then by the necessities of the moment. All that really mattered was their superb training. That was their most reliable preparation.\\n\\n Each new Bene Gesserit cell, wherever it finally went, was prepared as was Chapterhouse: total destruction rather than submission. The screaming fire would engorge itself on precious flesh and records. All a captor would find would be useless wreckage: twisted shards peppered with ashes.\\n\\n Some Chapterhouse Sisters might escape. But flight at the moment of attack - how futile!\\n\\n Key people shared Other Memory anyway. Preparation. Mother Superior avoided it. Reasons of morale!\\n\\n Where to run and who might escape, who might be captured? Those were the real questions. What if they captured Sheeana down there at the edge of the new desert waiting for sandworms that might never appear? Sheeana plus the sandworms: a potent religious force Honored Matres might know how to exploit. And what if Honored Matres captured ghola-Idaho or ghola-Teg? There might never again be a hiding place if one of those possibilities occurred.\\n\\n What if? What if?\\n\\n Angry frustration said: \"Should\u0027ve killed Idaho the minute we got him! We should never have grown ghola-Teg.\"\\n\\n Only her Council members, immediate advisors and some among the watchdogs shared her suspicion. They sat on it with reservations. None of them felt really secure about those two gholas, not even after mining the no-ship, making it vulnerable to the screaming fire.\\n\\n In those last hours before his heroic sacrifice, had Teg been able to see the unseeable (including no-ships)? How did he know where to meet us on that desert of Dune?\\n\\n And if Teg could do it, the dangerously talented Duncan Idaho with his uncounted generations of accumulated Atreides (and unknown) genes might also stumble upon the ability.\\n\\n I might do it myself!\\n\\n With sudden shocking insight, Odrade realized for the first time that Tamalane and Bellonda watched their Mother Superior with the same fears that Odrade felt in watching the two gholas.\\n\\n Merely knowing it could be done - that a human could be sensitized to detect no-ships and the other forms of that shielding - would have an unbalancing effect on their universe. It would certainly set the Honored Matres on a runaway track. There were uncounted Idaho offspring loose in the universe. He had always complained he was \"no damned stud for the Sisterhood,\" but he had performed for them many times.\\n\\n Always thought he was doing it for himself. And maybe he was.\\n\\n Any mainline Atreides offspring might have this talent the Council suspected had come to flower in Teg.\\n\\n Where did the months and years go? And the days? Another harvest season and the Sisterhood remained in its terrible limbo. Midmorning already, Odrade realized. The sounds and smells of Central made themselves known to her. People out there in the corridor. Chicken and cabbage cooking in the communal kitchen. Everything normal.\\n\\n What was normal to someone who dwelt in water images even during these working moments? Sea Child could not forget Gammu, the smells, the breeze-blown substance of ocean weeds, the ozone that made every breath oxygen-rich, and the splendid freedom in those around her so apparent in the way they walked and spoke. Conversation on the sea went deeper in a way she had never plumbed. Even small talk had its subterranean elements there, an oceanic elocution that flowed with the currents beneath them.\\n\\n Odrade felt compelled to remember her own body afloat in that childhood sea. She needed to recapture the forces she had known there, take in the strengthening qualities she had learned in more innocent times.\\n\\n Face down in salty water, holding her breath as long as she could, she floated in a sea-washed now that cleansed away woes. This was stress management reduced to its essence. A great calmness flooded her.\\n\\n I float, therefore I am.\\n\\n Sea Child warned and Sea Child restored. Without ever admitting it, she had needed restoration desperately.\\n\\n Odrade had looked at her own face mirrored in a workroom window the previous night, shocked by the way age and responsibilities combined with fatigue to suck in her cheeks and turn down the corners of her mouth: the sensual lips thinner, the gentle curves of her face elongated. Only the all-blue eyes blazed with their accustomed intensity and she still was tall and muscular.\\n\\n On impulse, Odrade punched up the call symbols and stared at a projection above the table: the no-ship sitting on the ground at the Chapterhouse spacefield, a giant bump of mysterious machinery, separated from Time. Over the years of its semi-dormancy, it had depressed a great sunken area into the landing flat, becoming almost wedged there. It was a great lump, its engines ticking away only enough to keep it hidden from prescient searchers, especially from Guild Navigators who would take a special joy in selling out the Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n Why had she called up this image just now?\\n\\n Because of the three people confined there - Scytale, the last surviving Tleilaxu Master; Murbella and Duncan Idaho, the sexually bonded pair, held as much by their mutual entrapment as they were by the no-ship.\\n\\n Not simple, any of it.\\n\\n There seldom were simple explanations for any major Bene Gesserit undertaking. The no-ship and its mortal contents could only be classified as a major effort. Costly. Very costly in energy even in its standby mode.\\n\\n The appearance of parsimonious metering to all of that expenditure spoke of energy crisis. One of Bell\u0027s concerns. You could hear it in her voice even when she was being her most objective: \"Down to the bone and nowhere else to cut!\" Every Bene Gesserit knew the watchful eyes of Accounting were on them these days, critical of the Sisterhood\u0027s outflowing vitality.\\n\\n Bellonda strode into the workroom unannounced with a roll of ridulian crystal records under her left arm. She walked as though she hated the floor, stamping on it as if to say: \"There! Take that! And that!\" Beating the floor because it was guilty of being underfoot.\\n\\n Odrade felt her chest tighten as she saw the look in Bell\u0027s eyes. The ridulian records went \"Slap!\" as Bellonda threw them onto the table.\\n\\n \"Lampadas!\" Bellonda said and there was agony in her voice.\\n\\n Odrade had no need to open the roll. Sea Child\u0027s bloody water has become reality.\\n\\n \"Survivors?\" Her voice sounded strained.\\n\\n \"None.\" Bellonda slumped into the chairdog she kept on her side of Odrade\u0027s table.\\n\\n Tamalane entered then and sat beside Bellonda. Both looked stricken.\\n\\n No survivors.\\n\\n Odrade permitted herself a slow shudder that went from her breast to the soles of her feet. She did not care that the others saw such a revealing reaction. This workroom had seen worse behavior from Sisters.\\n\\n \"Who reported?\" Odrade asked.\\n\\n Bellonda said, \"It came through our CHOAM spies and had the special mark on it. The Rabbi supplied the information, no doubt of it. \"\\n\\n Odrade did not know how to respond. She glanced at the wide bow window behind her companions, seeing a soft flutter of snowflakes. Yes, this news deservedly went with winter marshaling its forces out there.\\n\\n The sisters of Chapterhouse were unhappy about the sudden plunge into winter. Necessities had forced Weather Control to let the temperature drop precipitately. No gradual decline into winter, no kindness to growing things that now must pass through the freezing dormancy. This was three and four degrees colder every night. Get the whole thing over in a week or so and plunge them all into the seemingly interminable chill.\\n\\n Cold to match the news about Lampadas.\\n\\n One result of this weather shift was fog. She could see it dissipating as the brief snow flurry ended. Very confusing weather. They got the dewpoint next to the air temperature and the fog rolled into the remaining wet spots. It lifted from the ground in tulle mists that wandered through leafless orchards like a poisonous gas.\\n\\n No survivors at all?\\n\\n Bellonda shook her head from side to side in answer to Odrade\u0027s questioning look.\\n\\n Lampadas - a jewel in the Sisterhood\u0027s network of planets, home of their most prized school, another lifeless ball of ashes and hardened melt. And the Bashar Alef Burzmali with all of his handpicked defense force. All dead?\\n\\n \"All dead,\" Bellonda said.\\n\\n Burzmali, favorite student of the old Bashar Teg, gone and nothing gained by it. Lampadas - the marvelous library, the brilliant teachers, the premier students... all gone.\\n\\n \"Even Lucilla?\" Odrade asked. The Reverend Mother Lucilla, vice chancellor of Lampadas, had been instructed to flee at the first sign of trouble, taking with her as many of the doomed as she could store in Other Memory.\\n\\n \"The spies said all dead,\" Bellonda insisted.\\n\\n It was a chilling signal to surviving Bene Gesserit: \"You may be next!\"\\n\\n How could any human society be anesthetized to such brutality? Odrade wondered. She visualized the news with breakfast at some Honored Matre base: \"We\u0027ve destroyed another Bene Gesserit planet. Ten billion dead, they say. That makes six planets this month, doesn\u0027t it? Pass the cream, will you, dear?\"\\n\\n Almost glassy-eyed with horror, Odrade picked up the report and glanced through it. From the Rabbi, no doubt of that. She put it down gently and looked at her Councillors.\\n\\n Bellonda - old, fat and florid, Mentat-Archivist, wearing lenses to read now, uncaring what that revealed about her. Bellonda showed her blunt teeth in a wide grimace that said more than words. She had seen Odrade\u0027s reaction to the report. Bell might argue once more for retaliation in kind. That could be expected from someone valued for her natural viciousness. She needed to be thrown back into Mentat mode where she would be more analytical.\\n\\n In her own way, Bell is right, Odrade thought. But she won\u0027t like what I have in mind. I must be cautious in what I say now. Too soon to reveal my plan.\\n\\n \"There are circumstances where viciousness can blunt viciousness,\" Odrade said. \"We must consider it carefully.\"\\n\\n There! That would forestall Bell\u0027s outburst.\\n\\n Tamalane shifted slightly in her chair. Odrade looked at the older woman. Tam, composed there behind her mask of critical patience. Snowy hair above that narrow face: the appearance of aged wisdom.\\n\\n Odrade saw through the mask to Tam\u0027s extreme severity, the pose that said she disliked everything she saw and heard.\\n\\n In contrast to the surface softness of Bell\u0027s flesh, there was a bony solidity to Tamalane. She still kept herself in trim, her muscles as well-toned as possible. In her eyes, though, was the thing that belied this: a sense of withdrawing there, pulling back from life. Oh, she observed yet, but something had begun the final retreat. Tamalane\u0027s famed intelligence had become a kind of shrewdness, relying mostly on past observations and past decisions rather than on what she saw in the immediate present.\\n\\n We must begin readying a replacement. It will be Sheeana, I think. Sheeana is dangerous to us but shows great promise. And Sheeana was blooded on Dune.\\n\\n Odrade focused on Tamalane\u0027s shaggy eyebrows. They tended to hang over her lids in a concealing disarray. Yes. Sheeana to replace Tamalane.\\n\\n Knowing the complicated problems they must solve, Tam would accept the decision. At the moment of announcement, Odrade knew she would only have to turn Tam\u0027s attention to the enormity of their predicament.\\n\\n I will miss her, dammit!\\n\\n You cannot know history unless you know how leaders move with its currents. Every leader requires outsiders to perpetuate his leadership. Examine my career: I was leader and outsider. Do not assume I merely created a Church-State. That was my function as leader and I copied historical models. Barbaric arts of my time reveal me as outsider. Favorite poetry: epics. Popular dramatic ideal: heroism. Dances: wildly abandoned. Stimulants to make people sense what I took from them. What did I take? The right to choose a role in history.\\n\\n - Leto II (The Tyrant): Vether Bebe Translation\\n\\n I am going to die! Lucilla thought.\\n\\n Please, dear Sisters, don\u0027t let it come before I pass along the precious burden I carry in my mind!\\n\\n Sisters!\\n\\n The idea of family seldom was expressed among the Bene Gesserit but it was there. In a genetic sense, they were related. And because of Other Memory, they often knew where. They had no need for special terms such as \"second cousin\" or \"great aunt.\" They saw the relationships as a weaver sees his cloth. They knew how the warp and weft created the fabric. A better word than Family, it was the fabric of the Bene Gesserit that formed the Sisterhood but it was the ancient instinct of Family that provided the warp.\\n\\n Lucilla thought of her sisters only as Family now. The Family needed what she carried.\\n\\n I was a fool to seek refuge on Gammu!\\n\\n But her damaged no-ship would limp no farther. How diabolically extravagant Honored Matres had been! The hatred this implied terrified her.\\n\\n Strewing the escape lanes around Lampadas with deathtraps, the Foldspace perimeter seeded with small no-globes, each containing a field projector and a lasgun to fire on contact. When the laser hit the Holzmann generator in the no-globe, a chain reaction released the nuclear energy. Bzzz into the trap field and a devastating explosion spread silently across you. Costly but efficient! Enough such explosions and even a giant Guildship would become a crippled derelict in the void. Her ship\u0027s system of defensive analyses had penetrated the nature of the trap only when it was too late, but she had been lucky, she supposed.\\n\\n She did not feel lucky as she looked out the second story window of this isolated Gammu farmhouse. The window was open and an afternoon breeze carried the inevitable smell of oil, something dirty in the smoke of a fire out there. The Harkonnens had left their oily mark on this planet so deep it might never be removed.\\n\\n Her contact here was a retired Suk doctor but she knew him as much more, something so secret that only a limited number in the Bene Gesserit shared it. The knowledge lay in a special classification: The secrets of which we do not speak, even among ourselves, for that would harm us. The secrets we do not pass from Sister to Sister in the sharing of lives for there is no open path. The secrets we dare not know until a need arises. Lucilla had stumbled into it because of a veiled remark by Odrade.\\n\\n \"You know an interesting thing about Gammu? Mmmmm, there\u0027s a whole society there that bands itself on the basis that they all eat consecrated foods. A custom brought in by immigrants who have never been assimilated. Keep to themselves, frown on outbreeding, that sort of thing. They ignite the usual mythic detritus, of course: whispers, rumors. Serves to isolate them even more. Precisely what they want.\"\\n\\n Lucilla knew of an ancient society that fitted itself neatly into this description. She was curious. The society she had in mind supposedly had died out shortly after the Second Interspace Migrations. Judicious browsing in Archives whetted her curiosity even more. Living styles, rumor-fogged descriptions of religious rituals - especially the candelabra - and the keeping of special holy days with a proscription against any work on those days. And they were not just on Gammu!\\n\\n One morning, taking advantage of an uncommon lull, Lucilla entered the workroom to test her \"projective surmise,\" something not as reliable as a Mentat\u0027s equivalent but more than theory.\\n\\n \"You have a new assignment for me, I suspect.\"\\n\\n \"I see you\u0027ve been spending time in Archives.\"\\n\\n \"It seemed a profitable thing to do just now.\"\\n\\n \"Making connections?\"\\n\\n \"A surmise.\" That secret society on Gammu - they\u0027re Jews, aren\u0027t they?\\n\\n \"You may have need of special information because of where we are about to post you.\" Extremely casual.\\n\\n Lucilla sank into Bellonda\u0027s chairdog without invitation.\\n\\n Odrade picked up a stylus, scribbled on a sheet of disposable and passed it to Lucilla in a way that hid it from the comeyes.\\n\\n Lucilla took the hint and bent over the message, holding it close beneath the shield of her head.\\n\\n \"Your surmise is correct. You must die before revealing it. That is the price of their cooperation, a mark of great trust.\" Lucilla shredded the message.\\n\\n Odrade used eye and palm identification to unseal a panel on the wall behind her. She removed a small ridulian crystal and handed it to Lucilla. It was warm but Lucilla felt a chill. What could be so secret? Odrade swung the security hood from beneath her worktable and pivoted it into position.\\n\\n Lucilla dropped the crystal into its receptacle with a trembling hand and pulled the hood over her head. Immediately, words formed in her mind, an oral sense of extremely old accents clipped for recognition: \"The people to whom your attention has been called are the Jews. They made a defensive decision eons ago. The solution to recurrent pogroms was to vanish from public view. Space travel made this not only possible but attractive. They hid on countless planets - their own Scattering - and they probably have planets where only their people live. This does not mean they have abandoned age-old practices in which they excelled out of survival necessity. The old religion is sure to persist even though somewhat altered. It is probable that a rabbi from ancient times would not find himself out of place behind the Sabbath menorah of a Jewish household in your age. But their secrecy is such that you could work a lifetime beside a Jew and never suspect. They call it \u0027Complete Cover,\u0027 although they know its dangers.\"\\n\\n Lucilla accepted this without question. That which was so secret would be perceived as dangerous by anyone who even suspected its presence. \"Else why do they keep it secret, eh? Answer me that!\"\\n\\n The crystal continued to pour its secrets into her awareness: \"At the threat of discovery, they have a standard reaction, \u0027We seek the religion of our roots. It is a revival, bringing back what is best from our past.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Lucilla knew this pattern. There were always \"nutty revivalists.\" It was guaranteed to blunt most curiosity. \"Them? Oh, they\u0027re another bunch of revivalists.\"\\n\\n \"The masking system (the crystal continued) did not succeed with us. We have our own well-recorded Jewish heritage and a fund of Other Memory to tell us reasons for secrecy. We did not disturb the situation until I, Mother Superior during and after the battle of Corrin (Very old, indeed!), saw that our Sisterhood had need of a secret society, a group responsive to our requests for assistance.\"\\n\\n Lucilla felt a surge of skepticism. Requests?\\n\\n The long-ago Mother Superior had anticipated skepticism. \"On occasion, we make demands they cannot avoid. But they make demands on us as well.\"\\n\\n Lucilla felt immersed in the mystique of this underground society. It was more than ultra-secret. Her clumsy questions in Archives had elicited mostly rejections. \"Jews? What\u0027s that? Oh, yes - an ancient sect. Look it up for yourself. We don\u0027t have time for idle religious research.\"\\n\\n The crystal had more to impart: \"Jews are amused and sometimes dismayed at what they interpret as our copying them. Our breeding records dominated by the female line to control the mating pattern are seen as Jewish. You are only a Jew if your mother was a Jew. \"\\n\\n The crystal came to its conclusion: \"The Diaspora will be remembered. Keeping this secret involves our deepest honor.\"\\n\\n Lucilla lifted the hood from her head.\\n\\n \"You are a very good choice for an extremely touchy assignment on Lampadas,\" Odrade had said, restoring the crystal to its hiding place.\\n\\n That is the past and likely dead. Look where Odrade\u0027s \"touchy assignment\" has brought me!\\n\\n From her vantage in the Gammu farmhouse, Lucilla noted a large produce carrier had entered the grounds. There was a bustle of activity below her. Workers came from all sides to meet the big carrier with towbins of vegetables. She smelled the pungent juices from the cut stems of marrows.\\n\\n Lucilla did not move from the window. Her host had supplied her with local garments - a long gown of drab gray everwear and a bright blue headscarf to confine her sandy hair. It was important to do nothing calling undue attention to herself. She had seen other women pause to watch the farm work. Her presence here could be taken as curiosity.\\n\\n It was a large carrier, its suspensors laboring under the load of produce already piled in its articulated sections. The operator stood in a transparent house at the front, hands on the steering lever, eyes straight ahead. His legs were spread wide and he leaned into the web of sloping supports, touching the power bar with his left hip. He was a large man, face dark and deeply wrinkled, hair laced with gray. His body was an extension of the machinery - guiding ponderous movement. He flicked his gaze up to Lucilla as he passed, then back to the track into the wide loading area defined by buildings below her.\\n\\n Built into his machine, she thought. That said something about the way humans were fitted to the things they did. Lucilla sensed a weakening force in this thought. If you fitted yourself too tightly to one thing, other abilities atrophied. We become what we do.\\n\\n She pictured herself suddenly as another operator in some great machine, no different from that man in the carrier.\\n\\n The big machine trundled past her out of the yard, its operator not sparing her another glance. He had seen her once. Why look twice?\\n\\n Her hosts had made a wise choice in this hiding place, she thought. A sparsely populated area with trustworthy workers in the immediate vicinity and little curiosity among the people who passed. Hard work dulled curiosity. She had noted the character of the area. when she was brought here. Evening then and people already trudging toward their homes. You could measure the urban density of an area by when work stopped. Early to bed and you were in a loosely-packed region. Night activity said people remained restless, twitchy with inner awareness of others active and vibrating too near.\\n\\n What has brought me to this introspective state?\\n\\n Early in the Sisterhood\u0027s first retreat, before the worst onslaughts of the Honored Matres, Lucilla had experienced difficulty coming to grips with belief that \"someone out there is hunting us with intent to kill.\"\\n\\n Pogrom! That was what the Rabbi had called it before going off that morning \"to see what I can do for you.\"\\n\\n She knew the Rabbi had chosen his word from long and bitter memory, but not since her first experience of Gammu before this pogrom had Lucilla felt such confinement to circumstances she could not control.\\n\\n I was a fugitive then, too.\\n\\n The Sisterhood\u0027s present situation bore similarities to what they had suffered under the Tyrant, except that the God Emperor obviously (in retrospect) never intended to exterminate the Bene Gesserit, only to rule them. And he certainly ruled!\\n\\n Where is that damned Rabbi?\\n\\n He was a large, intense man with old-fashioned spectacles. A broad face browned by much sunlight. Few wrinkles despite the age she could read in his voice and movements. The spectacles focused attention on deeply set brown eyes that watched her with peculiar intensity.\\n\\n \"Honored Matres,\" he had said (right here in this bare-walled upper room) when she explained her predicament. \"Oh, my! That is difficult.\"\\n\\n Lucilla had expected that response and, what was more, she could see he knew it.\\n\\n \"There is a Guild Navigator on Gammu helping the search for you,\" he said. \"It is one of the Edrics, very powerful, I am told.\"\\n\\n \"I have Siona blood. He cannot see me.\"\\n\\n \"Nor me nor any of my people and for the same reason. We Jews adjust to many necessities, you know.\"\\n\\n \"This Edric is a gesture,\" she said. \"He can do little.\"\\n\\n \"But they have brought him. I\u0027m afraid there is no way we can get you safely off the planet.\"\\n\\n \"Then what can we do?\"\\n\\n \"We will see. My people are not entirely helpless, you understand?\"\\n\\n She recognized sincerity and concern for her. He spoke quietly of resisting the sexual blandishments of Honored Matres, \"doing it unobtrusively so as not to arouse them.\"\\n\\n \"I will go whisper in a few ears,\" he said.\\n\\n She felt oddly restored by this. There often was something coldly remote and cruel about falling into the hands of the medical professions. She reassured herself with the knowledge that Suks were conditioned to be alert to your needs, compassionate and supportive. (All of those things that can fall by the wayside in emergencies.) She bent her efforts to restoring calm, focusing on the personal mantra she had gained in solo death education. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-2.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) \\n The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
