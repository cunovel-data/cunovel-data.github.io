{"id":97569,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Odrade Within won that argument. But you were prepared for it from the first, weren\u0027t you, Dar? Your plan!\n The Proctors said: \"There\u0027s still Sheeana.\" They gave Murbella a one-man lighter and sent her to Junction alone.\n Even though she transmitted her Honored Matre identity ahead of her, there were touchy moments at the Landing Flat.\n A squad of armed Honored Matres confronted her as she emerged from the lighter beside a smoking pit. The smoke smelled of exotic explosives.\n Where Mother Superior\u0027s lighter was destroyed.\n An ancient Honored Matre led the squad, her red robe stained, some of its decorations gone and a rip down the left shoulder. She was like some dried-up lizard, still poisonous, still with a bite but running on well-used angers, most of her energy gone. Disarrayed hair like the outer skin of a fresh-dug ginger root. There was a demon in her. Murbella saw it peering from orange-flecked eyes.\n For all the fact that a full squad backed up the old one, the two of them faced each other as though isolated at the foot of the lighter\u0027s drop, wild animals cautiously sniffing, trying to judge the extent of danger.\n Murbella watched the old one carefully. This lizard would dart her tongue a bit, testing the air, giving vent to her emotions, but she was sufficiently shocked to listen.\n \"Murbella is my name. I was taken captive by the Bene Gesserit on Gammu. I am an adept of the Hormu.\"\n \"Why are you wearing a witch\u0027s robes?\" The old one and her squad stood ready to kill.\n \"I have learned everything they had to teach and have brought that treasure to my Sisters.\"\n The old one studied her a moment. \"Yes, I recognize your type. You\u0027re a Roc, one we chose for the Gammu project.\"\n The squad behind her relaxed slightly.\n \"You did not come all the way in that lighter,\" the old one accused.\n \"I escaped from one of their no-ships.\"\n \"Do you know where their nest is?\"\n \"I do.\"\n A wide smile spread on the old one\u0027s lips. \"Well! You are a prize! How did you escape?\"\n \"Do you have to ask?\"\n The old one considered this. Murbella could read the thoughts on her face as though they were spoken: These ones we brought from Roc - deadly, all of them. They can kill with hands, feet, or any other movable part of their bodies. They all should carry a sign: \"Dangerous in any position.\"\n Murbella moved away from the lighter, displaying the sinewy grace that was a mark of her identity.\n Speed and muscle, Sisters. Beware.\n Some of the squad pressed forward, curious. Their words were full of Honored Matre comparisons, eager questions Murbella was forced to parry.\n \"Did you kill many of them? Where is their planet? Is it rich? Have you bonded many males there? You were trained on Gammu?\"\n \"I was on Gammu for the third stage. Under Hakka.\"\n \"Hakka! I\u0027ve met her. Did she have that injured left foot when you knew her?\"\n Still testing.\n \"It was the right foot and I was with her when she took the injury!\"\n \"Oh, yes, the right foot. I remember now. How was she injured?\"\n \"Kicking a lout in the rear. He had a sharp knife in his hip pocket. Hakka was so angry she killed him.\"\n Laughter swept through the squad.\n \"We will go to Great Honored Matre,\" the old one said.\n So I\u0027ve passed first inspection.\n Murbella sensed reservations, though.\n Why is this Hormu adept wearing those enemy robes? And she has a strange look to her.\n Best face that one at once.\n \"I took their training and they accepted me.\"\n \"The fools! Did they really?\"\n \"You question my word?\" How easy it was to revert, adopting touchy Honored Matre ways.\n The old one bristled. She did not lose hauteur but she sent a warning look to her squad. All of them took a moment to digest what Murbella had said.\n \"You became one of them?\" someone behind her asked.\n \"How else could I steal their knowledge? Know this! I was the personal student of their Mother Superior.\"\n \"Did she teach you well?\" That same challenging voice from behind.\n Murbella identified the questioner: middle echelon and ambitious. Anxious for notice and advancement.\n This is the end of you, anxious one. And little loss to the universe.\n A Bene Gesserit feint drifted the feather that was her foe into range. One Hormu-style kick for them to recognize. The questioner lay dead on the ground.\n Marriage of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre abilities creates a danger you should all recognize and envy.\n \"She taught me admirably,\" Murbella said. \"Any other questions?\"\n \"Ehhhhh!\" the old one said.\n \"How are you called?\" Murbella demanded.\n \"I am a Senior Dame, Honored Matre of the Hormu. I am called Elpek.\"\n \"Thank you, Elpek. You may call me Murbella.\"\n \"I am honored, Murbella. It is indeed a treasure you have brought us.\"\n Murbella studied her a moment with Bene Gesserit watchfulness before smiling without humor.\n The exchange of names! You in your red robe that marks you as one of the powerful surrounding Great Honored Matre, do you know what you have just accepted into your circle?\n The squad remained shocked and looked at Murbella with wariness. She saw this with her new sensitivity. The Old Girl network had never gained a foothold in the Bene Gesserit but it performed for Honored Matres. Simulflow amused her with a parade of confirmation. How subtle the power transfers: right school, right friends, graduation and transfer onto the first rungs of the ladder - all guided by relatives and their connections, mutual back-scratching that managed alliances, including marriages. Simulflow told her it led into the pit but ones on the ladder, the ones in controlling niches, never let that worry them.\n Today is sufficient unto today, and that is how Elpek sees me. But she does not see what I have become, only that I am dangerous but potentially useful.\n Turning slowly on one foot, Murbella studied Elpek\u0027s squad. No bonded males here. This was too sensitive a duty for any but trusted women. Good.\n \"Now, you will listen to me, all of you. If you have any loyalty to our Sisterhood, which I will judge on future performance, you will honor what I have brought. I intend it as a gift for those who deserve it.\"\n \"Great Honored Matre will be pleased,\" Elpek said.\n But Great Honored Matre did not appear pleased when Murbella was presented.\n Murbella recognized the tower setting. Almost sunset now but Streggi\u0027s body still lay where it had fallen. Some of Teg\u0027s specialists had been killed, mostly the comeye crew who doubled as his guard.\n No, we Honored Matres do not like others spying on us.\n Teg still lived, she saw, but he was swathed in shigawire and shoved disdainfully into a corner. Most surprising of all: Odrade stood unfettered near Great Honored Matre. It was a gesture of contempt.\n Murbella felt she had lived through such a scene many times - aftermath of Honored Matre Victory: swaths of their enemies\u0027 bodies left where they had been brought down. Honored Matre attack with the bloodless weapon had been swift and deadly, a typical viciousness that killed when killing no longer was required. She suppressed a shudder at the memory of this deadly reversal. There had been no warning, only the troops dropping in wide lines - a domino effect that left the survivors in shock. And Great Honored Matre obviously enjoyed the shock.\n Looking at Murbella, Great Honored Matre said, \"So this is the bag of insolence you say you trained in your ways.\"\n Odrade almost smiled at the description.\n Bag of insolence?\n A Bene Gesserit would accept it without rancor. This rheumy-eyed Great Honored Matre faced a quandary and could not call on her weapon that killed without blood. Very delicate balance of power. Agitated conversations among Honored Matres had revealed their problem.\n All of their secret weapons had been exhausted and could not be reloaded, something they had lost when driven back here.\n \"Our weapon of last resort and we wasted it!\"\n Logno, who thought herself supreme, stood in a different arena now. And she had just learned of the fearful ease with which Murbella could kill one of the elect.\n Murbella cast a measuring gaze over Great Honored Matre\u0027s entourage, gauging their potentials. They recognized this situation, of course. Familiar. How did they vote?\n Neutral?\n Some were wary and all were waiting.\n Anticipating a diversion. No concern over who triumphed as long as power continued to flow in their direction.\n Murbella let her muscles flow into the waiting stance of combat she had learned from Duncan and the Proctors. She felt as cool as though standing on the practice floor, running through responses. Even as she reacted, she knew she moved in ways for which Odrade had prepared her - mentally, physically, and emotionally.\n Voice first. Give them a taste of inner chill.\n \"I see you have assessed the Bene Gesserit quite poorly. The arguments of which you are so proud, these women have heard them so many times your words go beyond boredom.\"\n This was delivered with scathing vocal control, a tone that brought orange to Logno\u0027s eyes but held her motionless.\n Murbella was not through with her. \"You consider yourself powerful and clever. One begets the other, eh? What idiocy! You\u0027re a consummate liar and you lie to yourself.\"\n As Logno remained motionless in the face of this attack, those around her began moving away, opening space that said, \"She is all yours.\n \"Your fluency in these lies does not hide them,\" Murbella said. She swept a scornful gaze across the ones behind Logno. \"Like the ones I know in Other Memory, you are headed for extinction. The problem is that you take so infernally long dying. Inevitable but oh, the boredom meanwhile. You dare call yourself Great Honored Matre!\" Returning her attention to Logno. \"Everything about you is a cesspool. You have no style.\"\n It was too much. Logno attacked, left foot slashing outward with blinding speed. Murbella grasped the foot as she would catch a wind-blown leaf and, continuing the flow of it, levered Logno into a threshing club that ended with her head pulped on the floor. Without pausing, Murbella pirouetted, left foot almost decapitating the Honored Matre who had stood at Logno\u0027s right, the right hand crushing the throat of the one who had stood at Logno\u0027s left. It was over in two heartbeats.\n Examining the scene without breathing hard (to show how easy it was, Sisters), Murbella experienced a sense of shock and recognition of the inevitable. Odrade lay on the floor in front of Elpek, who obviously had chosen sides without hesitation. The twisted position of Odrade\u0027s neck and flaccid appearance of her body said she was dead.\n \"She tried to interfere,\" Elpek said.\n Having killed a Reverend Mother, Elpek expected Murbella (a Sister, after all!) to applaud. But Murbella did not react as expected. She knelt beside Odrade and put her head against that of the corpse, staying there an interminable time.\n The surviving Honored Matres exchanged questioning looks but dared not move.\n What is this?\n But they were immobilized by Murbella\u0027s terrifying abilities.\n When she had Odrade\u0027s recent past, all of the new added to previous Sharing, Murbella stood.\n Elpek saw death in Murbella\u0027s eyes and took one backward step before trying to defend herself. Elpek was dangerous but no match for this demon in the black robe. It was over with the same shocking abruptness that had taken Logno and her aides: a kick to the larynx. Elpek sprawled across Odrade.\n Once more, Murbella studied the survivors, then stood a moment looking down at Odrade\u0027s body.\n In a way, that was my doing, Dar. And yours!\n She shook her head from side to side, absorbing consequences.\n Odrade is dead. Long live Mother Superior! Long live Great Honored Matre! And may the heavens protect us all.\n She gave her attention then to what must be done. These deaths had created an enormous debt. Murbella took a deep breath. This was another Gordian knot.\n \"Release Teg,\" she said. \"Clean up in here as quickly as possible. And somebody get me a proper robe!\"\n It was Great Honored Matre giving orders but those who leaped to obey sensed the Other in her.\n The one who brought her a red robe elaborate with soostone dragons held it deferentially from a distance. Large woman with heavy bones and square face. Cruel eyes.\n \"Hold it for me,\" Murbella said and when the woman tried to take advantage of proximity to attack her, Murbella dumped the woman hard. \"Try again?\"\n This time there were no tricks.\n \"You are the first member of my Council,\" Murbella said. \"Name?\"\n \"Angelika, Great Honored Matre.\" See! I was first to call you by your proper title. Reward me.\n \"Your reward is that I promote you and let you live.\"\n Proper Honored Matre response. Accepted as such.\n When Teg came to her rubbing his arms where the shigawire had bitten deep, some Honored Matres tried to caution Murbella. \"Do you know what this one can -\"\n \"He serves me now,\" Murbella interrupted. Then in Odrade\u0027s mocking tones: \"Isn\u0027t that right, Miles?\"\n He gave her a rueful smile, an old man on a child\u0027s face. \"Interesting times, Murbella.\"\n \"Dar liked apples,\" Murbella said. \"See to that.\"\n He nodded. Return her to a cemetery orchard. Not that prized Bene Gesserit orchards would endure long in a desert. Still, some traditions were worth perpetuating while you could.\n What do Holy Accidents teach? Be resilient. Be strong. Be ready for change, for the new. Gather many experiences and judge them by the steadfast nature of our faith.\n - Tleilaxu Doctrine\n Well within Teg\u0027s original timetable, Murbella picked her Honored Matre entourage and returned to Chapterhouse. She expected certain problems and the messages she sent ahead paved the way for solutions.\n \"I bring Futars to attract Handlers. Honored Matres fear a biological weapon from the Scattering that made vegetables of them. Handlers may be the source.\"\n \"Prepare to keep Rabbi and party in no-ship. Honor their secrecy. And remove the protective mines from the ship!\" (That went in keeping of a Proctor messenger.) She was tempted to ask for her children but that was non-Bene Gesserit. Someday... maybe.\n Immediately on returning, she had Duncan to accommodate and this confused Honored Matres. They were as bad as the Bene Gesserit. \"What\u0027s so special about one man?\"\n No longer a reason for him to remain in the ship but he refused to leave. \"I\u0027ve a mental mosaic to assemble: a piece that cannot be moved, extraordinary behavior, and willing participation in their dream. I must find limits to test. That\u0027s missing. I know how to find it. Get in tune. Don\u0027t think; do it.\"\n It made no sense. She humored him although he was changed. A stability to this new Duncan that she accepted as a challenge. By what right did he assume a self-satisfied air? No... not self-satisfied. It was more being at peace with a decision. He refused to share it!\n \"I\u0027ve accepted things. You must do the same.\"\n She had to admit this described what she was doing.\n On her first morning back, she arose at dawn and entered the workroom. Wearing the red robe, she sat in Mother Superior\u0027s chair and summoned Bellonda.\n Bell stood at one end of the worktable. She knew. The design became clear in execution. Odrade had imposed a debt on her as well. Thus, the silence: assessing how she must pay.\n Service to this Mother Superior, Bell! That is how you pay. No Archival declension of these events will put them into proper perspective. Action is required.\n Bellonda spoke finally. \"The only crisis I\u0027d care to compare with this one is the advent of the Tyrant.\"\n Murbella reacted sharply. \"Hold your tongue, Bell, unless you\u0027ve something useful to say!\"\n Bellonda took the reprimand calmly (uncharacteristic response). \"Dar had changes in mind. This what she expected?\"\n Murbella softened her tone. \"We\u0027ll rehash ancient history later. This is an opening chapter.\"\n \"Bad news.\" That was the old Bellonda.\n Murbella said: \"Admit the first group. Be cautious. They are Great Honored Matre\u0027s High Council.\"\n Bell left to obey.\n She knows I have every right to this position. They all know it. No need for a vote. No room for a vote!\n Now was the time for the historical art of politics she had learned from Odrade.\n \"In all things you must appear important. No minor decisions pass through your hands unless they are quiet acts called \u0027favors\u0027 done for people whose loyalty can be earned.\"\n Every reward came from on high. Not a good policy with the Bene Gesserit but this group entering the workroom, they were familiar with a Patroness Great Honored Matre; they would accept \"new political necessities.\" Temporarily. It was always temporary, especially with Honored Matres.\n Bell and watchdogs knew she would be a long time sorting this out. Even with amplified Bene Gesserit abilities.\n It would require extremely demanding attention from all of them. And the first thing was the sharply discerning gaze of innocence.\n That is what Honored Matres lost, and we must restore it before they can fade into the background where \"we\" belong.\n Bellonda ushered in the Council and retired silently.\n Murbella waited until they were seated. A mixed lot: some aspirants to supreme power. Angelika there smiling so prettily. Some waiting (not even daring to hope yet) but gathering what they could.\n \"Our Sisterhood was acting with stupidity,\" Murbella accused. She noted the ones who took this angrily. \"You would have killed the goose!\"\n They did not understand. She dredged up the parable. They listened with proper attention, even when she added: \"Don\u0027t you realize how desperately we need every one of these witches? We outnumber them so greatly that each of them will carry an enormous teaching burden!\"\n They considered this and, bitter though it was, they were forced to a qualified acceptance because she said it.\n Murbella hammered it home. \"Not only am I your Great Honored Matre... Does anyone question that?\"\n No one questioned.\n \"... but I am Bene Gesserit Mother Superior. They can do little else but confirm me in office.\"\n Two of them started to protest but Murbella cut them short. \"No! You would be powerless to enforce your will on them. You would have to kill them all. But they will obey me.\"\n The two continued to babble and she shouted them down: \"Compared to me with what I acquired from them, the lot of you are miserable weaklings! Do any of you challenge that?\"\n No one challenged but orange flecks were there.\n \"You are children with no knowledge of what you might become,\" she said. \"Would you return defenseless to face the ones of many faces? Would you become vegetables?\"\n That caught their interest. They were accustomed to this tone from older commanders. The content held them now. It was difficult to accept from one so young... still... the things she had done. And to Logno and her aides!\n Murbella saw them admire the bait.\n Fertilization. This group will carry it away with them. Hybrid vigor. We are fertilized to grow stronger. And flower. And go to seed? Best not dwell on that. Honored Matres will not see it until they are almost Reverend Mothers. Then they will look back angrily as I did. How could we have been that stupid?\n She saw submission take shape in councillor\u0027s eyes. There would be a honeymoon. Honored Matres would be children in a candy store. Only gradually would the inevitable grow plain to them. Then they would be trapped.\n As I was trapped. Don\u0027t ask the oracle what you can gain. That\u0027s the trap. Beware the real fortune teller! Would you like thirty-five hundred years of boredom?\n Odrade Within objected.\n Give the Tyrant some credit. It couldn\u0027t all have been boredom. More like a Guild Navigator picking his passage through foldspace. Golden Path. An Atreides paid for your survival, Murbella.\n Murbella felt burdened. The Tyrant\u0027s payment dumped on her shoulders. I didn\u0027t ask him to do it for me.\n Odrade could not let that pass. He did it nonetheless.\n Sorry, Dar. He paid. Now, I must pay.\n So you are a Reverend Mother at last!\n The councillors had grown restive under her stare.\n Angelika elected to speak for them. After all, I am first chosen.\n Watch that one! A blaze of ambition in her eyes.\n \"What response are you asking us to take with these witches?\" Alarmed by her own boldness. Was not Great Honored Matre also a witch now?\n Murbella spoke softly. \"You will tolerate them and offer them no violence whatsoever.\"\n Angelika was emboldened by Murbella\u0027s mild tone. \"Is that Great Honored Matre\u0027s decision or the -\"\n \"Enough! I could bloody the floor of this room with the lot of you! Do you wish to test it?\"\n They did not wish to test it.\n \"And what if I say to you that it is Mother Superior speaking? You will ask do I have a policy to meet our problem? I will say: Policy? Ahh, yes. I have a policy for unimportant things such as insect infestations. Unimportant things call for policies. For such of you as do not see the wisdom in my decision, I need no policy. Your kind I dispose of quickly. Dead before you know you\u0027ve been injured! That is my response to the presence of filth. Is there any filth in this room?\"\n It was language they recognized: the lash of the Great Honored Matre backed by ability to kill.\n \"You are my Council,\" Murbella said. \"I expect wisdom from you. The least you can do is pretend you are wise.\"\n Humorous sympathy from Odrade: If that\u0027s the way Honored Matres give and take orders, it won\u0027t require much deep analysis by Bell.\n Murbella\u0027s thoughts went elsewhere. I am no longer Honored Matre.\n The step from one to another was so recent she found her Honored Matre performance uncomfortable. Her adjustments were a metaphor of what would happen to her former Sisters. A new role and she did not wear it well. Other Memory simulated long association with herself as this new person. This was no mystical transubstantiation, merely new abilities.\n Merely?\n The change was profound. Did Duncan realize this? It pained her that he might never see through to this new person.\n Is that the residue of my love for him?\n Murbella drew back from her questions, not wanting an answer. She felt repelled by something that went deeper than she cared to burrow.\n There will be decisions I must make that love would prevent. Decisions for the Sisterhood and not for myself. That is where my fear is pointing.\n Immediate necessities restored her. She sent her councillors away, promising pain and death if they failed to learn this new restraint.\n Next, Reverend Mothers must be taught a new diplomacy: getting along with no one - not even with each other. It would grow easier in time. Honored Matres slipping into Bene Gesserit ways. One day, there would be no Honored Matres; only Reverend Mothers with improved reflexes and augmented knowledge of sexuality.\n Murbella felt haunted by words she had heard but not accepted until this moment. \"The things we will do for Bene Gesserit survival have no limits.\"\n Duncan will see this. I cannot keep it from him. The Mentat will not hold to a fixed idea of what I was before the Agony. He opens his mind as I open a door. He will examine his net. \"What have I caught this time?\"\n Was this what happened to Lady Jessica? Other Memory carried Jessica threaded into the warp and woof of Sharings. Murbella unraveled a bit and paraded elder knowledge.\n Heretic Lady Jessica? Malfeasance in office?\n Jessica had plunged into love as Odrade had plunged into the sea and the resultant waves had all but engulfed the Sisterhood.\n Murbella sensed this taking her where she did not want to go. Pain clutched her chest.\n Duncan! Ohhhh, Duncan! She dropped her face into her hands. Dar, help me. What am I to do?\n Never ask why you\u0027re a Reverend Mother.\n I must! The progression is clear in my memory and...\n That\u0027s a sequence. Thinking of it as cause and effect beguiles you away from totality.\n Tao?\n Simpler: You are here.\n But Other Memory goes back and back and...\n Imagine it\u0027s pyramids - interlocked.\n Those are just words!\n Is your body still functioning?\n I hurt, Dar. You don\u0027t have a body any more and it\u0027s useless to...\n We occupy different niches. The pains I felt are not your pains. My joys are not yours.\n I don\u0027t want your sympathy! Ohh, Dar! Why was I born?\n Were you born to lose Duncan?\n Dar, please!\n So you were born and now you know that\u0027s never enough. So you became an Honored Matre. What else could you do? Still not enough? Now you\u0027re a Reverend Mother. You think that\u0027s enough? It\u0027s never enough as long as you\u0027re alive.\n You\u0027re telling me I must always reach beyond myself.\n Pah! You don\u0027t make decisions on that basis. Didn\u0027t you hear him? Don\u0027t think; do it! Will you chose the easy way? Why should you feel sad because you\u0027ve encountered the inevitable? If that\u0027s all you can see, confine yourself to improving the breed!\n Damn you! Why did you do this to me?\n Do what?\n Make me see myself and my former Sisters this way!\n What way?\n Damn you! You know what I mean!\n Former Sisters, you say?\n Oh, you are insidious.\n All Reverend Mothers are insidious.\n You never stop teaching!\n Is that what I do?\n How innocent I was! Asking you what you really do.\n You know as well as I do. We wait for humankind to mature. The Tyrant only provided them time to grow but now they need care.\n What\u0027s the Tyrant have to do with my pain?\n You foolish woman! Did you fail the Agony?\n You know I didn\u0027t!\n Stop stumbling over the obvious.\n Oh, you bitch!\n I prefer witch. Either is preferable to whore.\n The only difference between Bene Gesserit and Honored Matre is the marketplace. You married our Sisterhood. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-30.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) \n The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
