{"id":97565,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"I merely tell what they believe. They see taxation as evidence of the drift, taking away free energy that might create more new things. A sensitized person detects it, they say.\" \"And these... these Honored Matres?\" \"They fit the pattern. Power-closed government intent on making all potential challengers ineffectual. Screen out the bright ones. Blunt intelligence.\" A tiny beeping sound came from the machinery area. Joshua was past them before they could stand. He bent over the screen that revealed events on the surface. \"They are back,\" he said. \"See! They dig in the ashes directly above us.\" \"Have they found us?\" The Rabbi sounded almost relieved. Joshua watched the screen. Rebecca placed her head beside his, studying the diggers - ten men with that dreaming look in their eyes of those who had been bonded to Honored Matres. \"They only dig at random,\" Rebecca said, straightening. \"You\u0027re sure?\" Joshua stood and looked into her face, seeking secret confirmation. Any Bene Gesserit could see it. \"Look for yourself.\" She gestured at the screen. \"They are leaving. They go to the sligsty now.\" \"Where they belong,\" the Rabbi muttered. Making workable choices occurs in a crucible of informative mistakes. Thus Intelligence accepts fallibility. And when absolute (infallible) choices are not known, Intelligence takes chances with limited data in an arena where mistakes are not only possible but also necessary. - Darwi Odrade Mother Superior did not just board an outgoing lighter and transfer to any convenient no-ship. There were plans, arrangements, strategies - contingencies on contingencies. It took eight hectic days. Timing with Teg had to be precise. Consultations with Murbella ate up hours. Murbella had to know what she faced. Discover their Achilles heel, Murbella, and you have it all. Stay on the observation ship when Teg attacks but watch carefully. Odrade took detailed advice from all who could help. Then came the vital-signs implant with encrypting to transmit her secret observations. A no-ship and long-range lighter had to be refitted, crew chosen by Teg. Bellonda muttered and growled until Odrade intervened. \"You are distracting me! Is that your intent? Weaken me?\" It was late morning four days before departure and they were temporarily alone in the workroom. Weather clear but unseasonably cold and air an ochre tinge from a dust storm that had blown across Central in the night. \"Convocation was a mistake!\" Bellonda needed her parting shot. Odrade found herself snapping back at Bellonda, who had become a bit too caustic. \"Necessary!\" \"To you, maybe! Saying goodbye to your family. Now, you leave us here taking in each other\u0027s laundry.\" \"Did you just come up here to complain about the Convocation?\" \"I don\u0027t like your latest comments on Honored Matres! You should have consulted us before spreading -\" \"They\u0027re parasites, Bell! It\u0027s time we made that clear: a known weakness. And what does a body do when afflicted by parasites?\" Odrade delivered this with a broad grin. \"Dar, when you assume this... this pseudo-humorous pose, I would like to throttle you!\" \"Would you smile as you did it, Bell?\" \"Damn you, Dar! One of these days...\" \"We don\u0027t have many more days together, Bell, and that\u0027s what\u0027s eating you. Answer my question.\" \"Answer it yourself!\" \"The body welcomes periodic delousing. Even addicts dream of freedom.\" \"Ahhhhh.\" A Mentat peered from Bellonda\u0027s eyes. \"You think addiction to Honored Matres could be made painful?\" \"In spite of your dreadful inability at humor, you still can function.\" A cruel smile flexed Bellonda\u0027s mouth. \"I\u0027ve managed to amuse you,\" Odrade said. \"Let me discuss this with Tam. She has a better head for strategy. Although... Sharing softened her.\" When Bellonda had gone, Odrade leaned back and laughed quietly. Softened! \"Don\u0027t go soft tomorrow, Dar, when you Share.\" The Mentat stumbles on logic and misses the heart. She sees the process and worries about failure. What do we do if... We open windows, Bell, and let in common sense. Even hilarity. Puts more serious matters in perspective. Poor Bell, my flawed Sister. Always something to occupy your nervousness. Odrade left Central on departure morning much entangled in her thinking - an introspective mood, worried by what she had learned Sharing with Murbella and Sheeana. I\u0027m being self-indulgent. That offered no relief. Her thoughts were framed by Other Memory and almost cynical fatalism. Queen bees swarming? That had been suggested of Honored Matres. But Sheeana? And Tam approves? This carried more in it than a Scattering. I cannot follow into your wild place, Sheeana. My task is to produce order. I cannot risk what you have dared. There are different kinds of artistry. Yours repels me. Absorbing lifetimes of Murbella\u0027s Other Memory helped. Murbella\u0027s knowledge was a powerful leverage on Honored Matres but full of disturbing nuances. Not hypnotrance. They use cellular induction, a byproduct of their damned T-probes! Unconscious compulsion! How tempting to use it for ourselves. But this is where Honored Matres are most vulnerable - enormous unconsciousness content locked in by their own decisions. Murbella\u0027s key only emphasizes its danger to us. They arrived at the Landing Flat in the midst of a windstorm that buffeted them when they emerged from their car. Odrade had vetoed a walk through what remained of orchards and vineyards. Leaving for the last time? The question in Bellonda\u0027s eyes as she said goodbye. In Sheeana\u0027s worried frown. Does Mother Superior accept my decision? Provisionally, Sheeana. Provisionally. But I have not warned Murbella. So... perhaps I do share Tam\u0027s judgment. Dortujla, in the van of Odrade\u0027s party, was withdrawn. Understandable. She has been there... and watched her Sisters eaten. Courage, Sister! We are not yet defeated. Only Murbella had appeared to take this in stride but she was thinking ahead to Odrade\u0027s encounter with the Spider Queen. Have I armed Mother Superior sufficiently? Does she know in her guts how very dangerous this will be? Odrade pushed such thoughts aside. There were things to do on the crossing. None of them more important than gathering her energies. Honored Matres could be analyzed almost out of reality, but the actual confrontation would be played as it came - a jazz performance. She liked the idea of jazz although the music distracted her with its antique flavors and the dips into wildness. Jazz spoke about life, though. No two performances ever identical. Players reacted to what was received from the others: jazz. Feed us with jazz. Air and space travel did not often concern itself with weather. Bludgeon your way through transitory interferences. Depend on Weather Control to provide launch windows through storms and cloud cover. Desert planets were an exception and that would have to be entered into Chapterhouse equations before long. Many changes, including return to Fremen mortuary practices. Bodies rendered for water and potash. Odrade spoke of this as they waited for transport up to the ship. That wide cummerbund of hot, dry land expanding around the planet\u0027s equator would begin generating dangerous winds before long. One day, there would be coreolis storms: a blast-furnace from the desert interior with speeds in hundreds of kilometers an hour. Dune had seen winds of more than seven hundred kmh. Even space lighters took notice of such force. Air travel would be subject to the constant whims of surface conditions. And frail human flesh must find whatever shelter it could. As we always have. The lounge at the Flat was old. Stone inside and out, their first major building material here. Spartan slingchairs and low tables of molded plaz were more recent. Economy could not be ignored even for Mother Superior. The lighter arrived in a dusty maelstrom. No nonsense about suspensor cushioning. This would be a quick lift with uncomfortable gees but not high enough to damage flesh. Odrade felt almost disembodied as she said her final farewells and turned Chapterhouse over to a triumvirate of Sheeana, Murbella, and Bellonda. One last word: \"Don\u0027t interfere with Teg. And I don\u0027t want anything nasty happening to Duncan. Hear me, Bell?\" All of the wonderful technological things they could accomplish and they still could not keep a thick sandstorm from almost blinding them as they lifted. Odrade closed her eyes and accepted the fact that she was not to get a last low-level overview of her beloved planet. She awoke to the thump of docking. Buzzcar waiting in a corridor just beyond the lock. A humming traverse to their quarters. Tamalane, Dortujla, and the acolyte servant maintained silence, respecting Mother Superior\u0027s desire to be with her own thoughts. The quarters, at least, were familiar, standard on Bene Gesserit ships: a small sitting-dining room in elemental plaz of uniform light green; smaller sleeping chamber with walls in the same color and a single hard cot. They knew Mother Superior\u0027s preferences. Odrade glanced into a usiform bath and toilet. Standard facilities. Adjoining quarters for Tam and Dortujla were similar. Time later to look at the ship\u0027s refittings. All essentials had been provided. Including unobtrusive elements of psychological support: subdued colors, familiar furnishings, a setting to disturb none of her mental processes. She gave orders for departure before returning to her sitting-dining room. Food was waiting on a low table - blue fruit, sweet and plummy, a savory yellow spread on bread tailored to her energy needs. Very good. She watched the assigned acolyte at her self-effacing work arranging Mother Superior\u0027s effects. The name evaded Odrade for a second, then: Suipol. A dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient. It struck Odrade suddenly that these assignments had an element of callousness in them. A small entourage, not to offend Honored Matres. And keep our losses to a minimum. \"Have you unpacked all of my things, Suipol?\" \"Yes, Mother Superior.\" Very proud of having been chosen for this important assignment. It showed in her walk as she left. There are some things you cannot unpack for me, Suipol. I carry those in my head. No Bene Gesserit from Chapterhouse ever left the planet without taking along a certain amount of chauvinism. Other places were never quite as beautiful, never quite as serene, never as pleasant a habitat. But this is the Chapterhouse that was. It was an aspect of the desert transformation she had never before viewed in quite that way. Chapterhouse was removing itself. Going away, never to return, at least not in the lifetimes of those who knew it now. It was like being abandoned by a beloved parent-disdainfully and with malice. You are no longer important to me, child. On the way to becoming a Reverend Mother, they were taught early that travel could provide a peaceful byway for rest. Odrade fully intended to take advantage of this and told her companions immediately after eating, \"Spare me details.\" Suipol was sent to summon Tamalane. Odrade spoke in Tam\u0027s own terse meter. \"Inspect the refitting and tell me what I should see. Take Dortujla.\" \"Good head, that one.\" High praise from Tam. \"When we\u0027re through, isolate me as much as possible.\" During part of the crossing, Odrade strapped herself into the webbing of her cot and occupied herself composing what she thought of as a last will and testament. Who would be executor? Murbella was her personal choice, especially after the Sharing with Sheeana. Still... the Dune waif remained a potent candidate if this venture to Junction failed. Some assumed any Reverend Mother could serve if responsibility fell on her. But not in these times. Not with this trap set. Honored Matres were unlikely to avoid the pitfall. If we\u0027ve judged them correctly. And Murbella\u0027s data says we\u0027ve done our best. The opening is there for Honored Matres to enter, and oh, how inviting it will appear. They won\u0027t see the dead end until they\u0027re well into it. Too late! But what if we fail? Survivors (if any) would hold Odrade in contempt. I have often felt diminished but never an object of contempt. Yet the decisions I made may never be accepted by my Sisters. At least, I make no excuses... not even to the ones with whom I Shared. They know my response comes from the darkness before a human dawn. Any of us may do a futile thing, even a stupid thing. But my plan can give us victory. We will not \"just survive.\" Our grail requires us to persist together. Humans need us! Sometimes, they need religions. Sometimes, they need merely know their beliefs are as empty as their hopes for nobility. We are their source. After the masks are removed, that remains: Our Niche. She felt then that this ship was taking her into the pit. Closer and closer to awful threat. I go to the axe; it does not come to me. No thoughts of exterminating this foe. Not since the Scattering magnified human population had that been possible. A flaw in Honored Matre schemes. The high-pitched beep and flashing orange light that signaled arrival brought her out of repose. She struggled from her sling straps and, with Tam, Dortujla, and Suipol close behind, followed a guide to the transport lock where a long-range lighter clung to its shiptit. Odrade looked at the lighter visible in bulkhead scanners. Incredibly small! \"It\u0027ll only be nineteen hours,\" Duncan had said. \"But that\u0027s as close as we dare bring the no-ship. They\u0027re sure to have foldspace sensors close around Junction.\" Bell, for once, had agreed. Don\u0027t risk the ship. It\u0027s there to plot outer defenses and receive your transmissions, not just to deliver Mother Superior. The lighter was the no-ship\u0027s forward sensor, signaling what it encountered. And I am the foremost sensor, a fragile body with delicate instruments. There were guide arrows at the lock. Odrade led the way. They went through a small tube in free-fall. She found herself in a surprisingly rich cabin. Suipol, tumbling behind, recognized it and went up a notch in Odrade\u0027s estimation. \"This was a smuggler ship.\" One person awaited them. Male by his smell but an opaque pilot\u0027s hood bristling with connectors concealed his face. \"Everyone strap in.\" Male voice within that instrumentation. Teg chose him. He\u0027ll be the best. Odrade slipped into a seat behind a landing port and found the lumpy protrusions that unreeled into web harness. She heard the others obeying the pilot\u0027s command. \"All secure? Stay strapped in unless I say otherwise.\" His voice came from a floating speaker behind his seat at the drive console. The umbilicus went \"Bap!\" Odrade felt gentle motions, but the view in the relay beside her showed the no-ship receding at a remarkable rate. It winked out of existence. Going about its business before anyone can come out to investigate. The lighter had surprising speed. Scanners reported planetary stations and transition barriers at eighteen-plus hours but winking dots identifying them were visible only because they had been enhanced. A window in the scanner said the stations would be naked-eye visible in a little more than twelve of those hours. The sense of motion ceased abruptly and Odrade no longer felt the acceleration her eyes reported. Suspensor cabin. Ixian technology for a nullfield this small. Where had Teg acquired it? Not necessary for me to know. Why tell Mother Superior where every oak plantation is located? She watched sensor contacts begin within the hour and gave silent thanks for Idaho\u0027s astuteness. We\u0027re beginning to know these Honored Matres. Junction\u0027s defensive pattern was apparent even without scanner analysis. Overlapping planes! Just as Teg predicted. With knowledge of how barriers were spaced, Teg\u0027s people could weave another globe around the planet. Surely it\u0027s not that simple. Were Honored Matres so confident of overwhelming power that they ignored elementary precautions? Planetary Station Four began calling when they were just under three hours out. \"Identify yourself!\" Odrade heard an \"or else\" in that command. The pilot\u0027s response obviously surprised the watchers. \"You come in a little smuggler ship?\" So they recognize it. Teg is right once more. \"I\u0027m about to burn the sensor equipment in the drive,\" the pilot announced. \"It will add to our thrust. Make sure you\u0027re all securely harnessed.\" Station Four noticed. \"Why are you increasing velocity?\" Odrade leaned forward. \"Repeat the countersign and say our party is fatigued from too long in cramped quarters. Add that I have equipped myself with a precautionary vital-signs transmitter to alert my people should I die.\" They won\u0027t find the encryption! Clever Duncan. And wasn\u0027t Bell surprised to discover what he hid in Shipsystems. \"More romantics!\" The pilot relayed her words. Back came the order: \"Reduce velocity and lock onto these coordinates for landing. We are taking over your ship control at this point.\" The pilot touched a yellow field on his board. \"Just the way the Bashar said they would.\" A gloating sound in his voice. He lifted the hood off his head and turned. Odrade was shocked. Cyborg! The face was a metal mask with two glittering silver balls for eyes. We enter dangerous ground. \"They didn\u0027t tell you?\" he asked. \"Waste no pity. I was dead and this gave me life. It\u0027s Clairby, Mother Superior. And when I die this time, that will buy me life as a ghola.\" Damn! We\u0027re trading in coin that may be denied us. Too late to change. And that was Teg\u0027s plan. But... Clairby? The lighter landed with a smoothness that spoke of superb control by Station Four. Odrade knew the moment because a manicured landscape visible in her scanner no longer moved. The nullfield was turned off and she felt gravity. The hatch directly in front of her opened. Temperature pleasantly warm. Noise out there. Children playing some competitive game? Luggage floating behind, she stepped onto a short flight of steps and saw that the noise did indeed come from a large group of children in a nearby field. In their high teens and female. They were butting a suspensor float-ball back and forth, shouting and screaming as they played. Staged for our benefit? Odrade thought it likely. There probably were two thousand young women on that field. Look how many recruits we have coming along! No one to greet her but Odrade saw a familiar structure down a paved lane to her left. Obvious Spacing Guild artifact with a recent tower added. She spoke of the tower as she glanced around her, giving the implanted transmitter data on a change from Teg\u0027s groundplan. Nobody who had ever seen a Guild building could mislabel this place, though. So this was like other Junction planets. Somewhere in Guild records there doubtless was a serial number and code for it. So long under Guild control before Honored Matres that, in these first moments of debarking, getting their \"ground legs,\" everything around them could be seen to have that special Guild flavor. Even the playing field - designed for outdoor meetings of Navigators in their giant containers of melange gas. The Guild flavor: It was compounded of Ixian technology and Navigator design - buildings wrapped around space in the most energy-conserving way, paths direct; few slide-walks. They were wasteful and only the gravity-bound needed them. No flowery plantings near the Landing Flat. They were susceptible to accidental destruction. And that permanent grayness to all construction - not silver but as dull as Tleilaxu skin. The structure on her left was a great bulging shape with extrusions, some rounded and some angular. This had been no lavish hostelry. Opulent little nooks, of course, but those were rare, built for VVIPs, mostly inspectors from the Guild. Once more, Teg is right. Honored Matres kept existing structures, remodeling minimally. A tower! Odrade reminded herself then: This is not only another world but also another society with its own social glue. She had a handle on that from Sharing with Murbella but did not think she had plumbed what held Honored Matres together. Surely not just a lusting after power. \"We\u0027ll walk,\" she said and led the way down the paved lane toward the giant structure. Goodbye, Clairby. Blow your ship as soon as you can. Let it be our first great surprise for Honored Matres. The Guild structure loomed higher as they approached. The most astonishing thing to Odrade whenever she saw one of these functional constructions was that someone had taken a great deal of care in planning it. Intentional detail in everything although you sometimes had to dig for it. Budget dictated reduced quality in many choices, endurance preferred over luxury or eye appeal. Compromise and, like most compromise, satisfying no one. Guild comptrollers undoubtedly had complained at the price, and present occupants still could feel irritated at shortcomings. No matter. The thing was tangible substance. It was here to be used now. Another compromise. The lobby was smaller than she had expected. Some interior changes. Only about six meters long and perhaps four meters wide. Reception slot was on their right as they entered. Odrade motioned Suipol to register their party and indicated that the rest of them should wait in the open area well within striking distance of one another. Treachery had not been ruled out. Dortujla obviously expected it. She looked resigned. Odrade made a careful inspection and commented on their surroundings. Plenty of comeyes but the rest of it... Each time she entered one of these places, she had the sensation of being in a museum. Other Memory said hostelries of this sort had not changed significantly in eons. Even in early times she found prototypes. A glimpse of the past in the chandeliers - gigantic glittering things imitative of electric devices but furnished with glowglobes. Two of them dominated the ceiling like imaginary spaceships descending in splendor from the void. There were more glimpses of the past that few transients in this age would notice. The arrangement of reception area behind grilled slots, space for waiting with its mixture of seats and inconvenient lighting, signs directing them to services - restaurants, narcoparlors, assignation bars, swimming and other exercise facilities, automassage rooms, and the like. Only language and script had changed from ancient times. Given an understanding of the language, the signs would be recognizable to pre-space primitives. This was a temporary stopping place. Plenty of security installations. Some had the look of artifacts from the Scattering. Ix and Guild had never wasted gold on comeyes and sensors. A frenetic dance of roboservants in the reception area - dartings here and there, cleaning, picking up litter, guiding newcomers. A party of four Ixians had preceded Odrade\u0027s group. She gave them close attention. How self-important yet fearful. To her Bene Gesserit eye, the people of Ix were always recognizable no matter the disguises. Basic structure of their society colored its individuals. Ixians displayed a Hogbenesque attitude toward their science: that political and economic requirements determined permissible research. That said the innocent naivete of Ixian social dreams had become the reality of bureaucratic centralism - a new aristocracy. So they were headed into a decline that would not be stopped by whatever accommodation this Ixian party made with Honored Matres. No matter the outcome of our contest, Ix is dying. Witness: no great Ixian innovations in centuries. Suipol returned. \"They ask us to wait for an escort.\" Odrade decided to start negotiations immediately with a chat for the benefit of Suipol, the comeyes, and listeners on her no-ship. \"Suipol, did you notice those Ixians ahead of us?\" \"Yes, Mother Superior.\" \"Mark them well. They are products of a dying society. It is naive to expect any bureaucracy to take brilliant innovations and put them to good use. Bureaucracies ask different questions. Do you know what those are?\" \"No, Mother Superior.\" Spoken after a searching look at their surroundings. She knows! But she sees what I\u0027m doing. What have we here? I\u0027ve misjudged her. \"These are typical questions, Suipol: Who gets the credit? Who will be blamed if it causes problems? Will it shift the power structure, costing us jobs? Or will it make some subsidiary department more important?\" Suipol nodded on cue but her glance at the comeyes might have been a little obvious. No matter. \"These are political questions,\" Odrade said. \"They demonstrate how motives of bureaucracy are directly opposed to the need for adapting to change. Adaptability is a prime requirement for life to survive.\" Time to talk directly to our hosts. Odrade turned her attention upward, picking a prominent comeye in a chandelier. \"Note those Ixians. Their \u0027mind in a deterministic universe\u0027 has given way to \u0027mind in an unlimited universe\u0027 where anything may happen. Creative anarchy is the path to survival in this universe.\" \"Thank you for this lesson, Mother Superior.\" Bless you, Suipol. \"After all of their experiences with us,\" Suipol said, \"surely they no longer question our loyalty to one another.\" Fates preserve her! This one is ready for the Agony and may never see it. Odrade could only agree with the acolyte\u0027s summation. Compliance with Bene Gesserit ways came from within, from those constantly monitored details that kept their own house in order. It was not philosophical but a pragmatic view of free will. Any claim the Sisterhood might have to making its own way in a hostile universe lay in scrupulous adherence to mutual loyalty, an agreement forged in the Agony. Chapterhouse and its few remaining subsidiaries were nurseries of an order founded in sharing and Sharing. Not based on innocence. That had been lost long ago. It was set firmly in political consciousness and a view of history independent of other laws and customs. \"We are not machines,\" Odrade said, glancing at the automata around them. \"We always rely on personal relationships, never knowing where those may lead us.\" Tamalane stepped to Odrade\u0027s side. \"Don\u0027t you think they should be sending us a message at the very least?\" \"They\u0027ve already sent us a message, Tam, putting us up in a second-class hostelry. And I have responded.\" Ultimately, all things are known because you want to believe you know. - Zensunni koan Teg took a deep breath. Gammu lay directly ahead, precisely where his navigators had said it would be when they emerged from foldspace. He stood beside a watchful Streggi seeing this in displays of his flagship\u0027s command bay. Streggi did not like it that he stood on his own feet instead of riding her shoulders. She felt superfluous amidst military hardware. Her gaze kept going to the multi-projection fields at command bay center. Aides moving efficiently in and out of pods and fields, bodies draped with esoteric hardware, knew what they were doing. She had only the vaguest idea of these functions. The comboard to relay Teg\u0027s orders lay under his palms, riding there on suspensors. Its command field formed a faint blue glow around his hands. The silvery horseshoe linking him to the attack force rested lightly on his shoulders, feeling familiar there in spite of being much larger relative to his small body than comlinks of his previous lifetime. None of those around him any longer questioned that this was their famous Bashar in a child\u0027s body. They took his orders with brisk acceptance. The target system looked ordinary from this distance: a sun and its captive planets. But Gammu in center focus was not ordinary. Idaho had been born there, his ghola trained there, his original memories restored there. And I was changed there. Teg had no explanation for what he had found in himself under the stresses of survival on Gammu. Physical speed that drained his flesh and an ability to see no-ships, to locate them in an image field like a block of space reproduced in his mind. He suspected a wild outcropping in Atreides genes. Marker cells had been identified in him but not their purpose. It was the heritage Bene Gesserit Breeding Mistresses had meddled with for eons. There was little doubt they would view this ability as something potentially dangerous to them. They might use it but he would certainly lose his freedom. He put these reflections out of his mind. \"Send in the decoys.\" Action! Teg felt himself assume a familiar stance. There was a sense of climbing onto a refreshing eminence when planning ended. Theories had been articulated, alternatives carefully worked out, and subordinates deployed, all thoroughly briefed. His key squad leaders had committed Gammu to memory - where partisan help might be available, every bolt hole, every known strongpoint and which access routes were most vulnerable. He had warned them especially about Futars. The possibility that humanoid beasts might be allies could not be overlooked. Rebels who had helped ghola-Idaho escape from Gammu had insisted Futars were created to hunt and kill Honored Matres. Knowing the accounts of Dortujla and others, you could almost pity Honored Matres if this were true, except that no pity could be spared for those who never showed it to others. The attack was taking its designed shape - scout ships laying down a decoy barrage and heavy carriers moving into strike position. Teg became now what he thought of as \"the instrument of my instruments.\" It was difficult to determine which commanded and which responded. Now, the delicate part. Unknowns were to be feared. A good commander kept that firmly in mind. There were always unknowns. Decoys were nearing the defensive perimeter. He saw enemy no-ships and foldspace sensors - bright dots arrayed through his awareness. Teg superimposed this onto the positions of his force. Every order he gave must appear to originate from a battle-plot they all shared. He felt thankful Murbella had not joined him. Any Reverend Mother might see through his deception. But no one had questioned Odrade\u0027s order that Murbella wait with her party at a safe distance. \"Potential Mother Superior. Guard this one well.\" Explosive demolition of decoys began with a random display of brilliant flashes around the planet. He leaned forward, staring at projections. \"There\u0027s the pattern!\" There was no such pattern but his words created belief and pulses quickened. No one questioned that the Bashar had seen vulnerability in the defenses. His hands flashed over the comboard, sending his ships forward in a blazing display that littered space behind them with enemy fragments. \"All right! Let\u0027s go!\" He fed the flagship\u0027s course directly into Navigation, then turned full attention to Fire Control. Silent explosions dotted space around them as the flagship mopped up surviving elements of Gammu\u0027s perimeter guardians. \"More decoys!\" he ordered. Globes of white light blinked in the projection fields. Attention in the command bay concentrated on the fields, not on their Bashar. The unexpected! Teg, justly famous for that, was confirming his reputation. \"I find this oddly romantic,\" Streggi said. Romantic? No romance in this! The time for romance was past and yet to come. A certain aura might surround plans for violence. He accepted that. Historians created their own brand of drama-cum-romance. But now? This was adrenaline time! Romance distracted you from necessities. You had to be cold inside, a clear and unimpaired line between mind and body. As his hands moved in the comboard\u0027s field, Teg realized what had driven Streggi to speak. Something primitive about the death and destruction being created here. This was a moment cut out of normal order. A disturbing return to ancient tribal patterns. She sensed a tom-tom in her breast and voices chanting: \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\" His vision of guardian no-ships showed survivors fleeing in panic. Good! Panic has a way of spreading and weakening your enemies.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-26.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
