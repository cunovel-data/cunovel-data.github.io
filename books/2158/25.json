{"id":97564,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"What?\" Surprised at the sharpness of his tone. Didn\u0027t he know he was talking to a Reverend Mother?\\n\\n \"I know all of this, Murbella. Any Mentat does.\"\\n\\n \"Are you trying to shut me up?\" Angry.\\n\\n \"Our job is to think like our enemy,\" he said. \"We do have a common enemy?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sneering at me, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"Are your eyes orange?\"\\n\\n \"Melange doesn\u0027t allow that and you know... Oh.\"\\n\\n \"The Bene Gesserit need your knowledge but you must cultivate it!\" He turned on a glowglobe and found her flaring at him. Not unexpected and not really Bene Gesserit.\\n\\n Hybrid.\\n\\n The word leaped into his mind. Was it hybrid vigor? Did the Sisterhood expect this of Murbella? The Bene Gesserit surprised you sometimes. You found them facing you in odd corridors, eyes unwavering, faces masked in that way of theirs and, behind the masks, unusual responses brewing. That was where Teg learned to do the unexpected. But this? Idaho thought he could grow to dislike this new Murbella.\\n\\n She saw this in him, naturally. He remained open to her as to no other person.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t hate me, Duncan.\" No pleading but something deeply hurt behind the words.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll never hate you.\" But he turned off the light.\\n\\n She nestled against him almost the way she had before the Agony. Almost. The difference tore at him.\\n\\n \"Honored Matres see the Bene Gesserit as competitors for power,\" Murbella said. \"It\u0027s not so much that men who follow my former Sisters are fanatics, but they\u0027re made incapable of self-determination by their addiction.\"\\n\\n \"Is that the way we are?\"\\n\\n \"Now, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"You mean I could get this commodity at another store?\"\\n\\n She chose to assume he was talking about Honored Matre fears. \"Many would abandon them if they could.\" Turning toward him fiercely, she demanded a sexual response. Her abandon shocked him. As though this might be the last time she could experience such ecstasy.\\n\\n Afterward, he lay exhausted.\\n\\n \"I hope I\u0027m pregnant again,\" she whispered. \"We still need our babies.\"\\n\\n We need. The Bene Gesserit need. No longer \"they need.\"\\n\\n He fell asleep to dream he was in the ship\u0027s armory. It was a dream touched by realities. The ship remained a weapons factory as it actually had become. Odrade was talking to him in the dream armory. \"I make decisions of necessity, Duncan. Little likelihood you\u0027ll break out and run amok.\"\\n\\n \"I am too much the Mentat for that!\" How self-important his dream voice! I\u0027m dreaming and I know I dream. Why am I in the armory with Odrade?\\n\\n A list of weapons scrolled before his eyes.\\n\\n Atomics. (He saw big blasters and deadly dusts.) Lasguns. (No counting the various models.) Bacteriologicals.\\n\\n The scroll was interrupted by Odrade\u0027s voice. \"We can assume smugglers concentrate as usual on small things that bring a big price. \"\\n\\n \"Soostones, of course.\" Still self-important. I\u0027m not that way!\\n\\n \"Assassination weapons,\" she said. \"Plans and specifications for new devices.\"\\n\\n \"Theft of trade secrets is a big item with smugglers.\" I\u0027m insufferable!\\n\\n \"There are always medicines and the diseases that require them,\" she said.\\n\\n Where is she? I can hear her but I can\u0027t see her. \"Do Honored Matres know our universe harbors blackguards not above sowing the problem before providing the solution?\" Blackguards? I never use that word.\\n\\n \"All things relative, Duncan. They burned Lampadas and butchered four million of our finest.\"\\n\\n He awoke and sat upright. Specifications for new devices! There it was in delicate detail, a way to miniaturize Holzmann generators. Two centimeters, no more. And much cheaper! How was that smuggled into my mind?\\n\\n He slipped out of bed, not awakening Murbella, and groped his way to a robe. He heard her snuffle as he let himself out into the workroom.\\n\\n Seating himself at his console, he copied the design from his mind and studied it. Perfect! Englobement for sure. He transmitted to Archives with a flag for Odrade and Bellonda.\\n\\n With a sigh, he sat back and examined his design once more. It vanished in a return to his dream scroll. Am I still dreaming? No! He could feel the chair, touch the console, hear the field buzzing. Dreams do that.\\n\\n The scroll produced cutting and stabbing weapons, including some designed to introduce poisons or bacteria into enemy flesh.\\n\\n Projectiles.\\n\\n He wondered how to stop the scroll and study details.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all in your head!\"\\n\\n Humans and other animals bred for attack scrolled past his eyes, hiding the console and its projection. Futars? How did Futars get in there? What do I know about Futars?\\n\\n Disruptors replaced the animals. Weapons to cloud mental activity or interfere with life itself. Disruptors? I\u0027ve never heard that name before.\\n\\n Disruptors were succeeded by null-G \"seekers\" designed to hunt specific targets. Those I know.\\n\\n Explosives next, including ones to spread poisons and bacteriologicals.\\n\\n Deceptives, to project false targets. Teg had used those.\\n\\n Energizers appeared next. He had a private arsenal of those: ways of increasing capacities of your troops.\\n\\n Abruptly, the shimmering net from his vision replaced scrolling weapons and he saw the elderly couple in their garden. They glared at him. The man\u0027s voice became audible. \"Stop spying on us!\"\\n\\n Idaho gripped the arms of his chair and jerked himself forward but the vision disappeared before he could study details.\\n\\n Spying?\\n\\n He sensed a residue of the scroll in his mind, no longer visible but a musing voice... masculine.\\n\\n \"Defenses often must take on characteristics of the attack weapons. Sometimes, however, simple systems can divert the most devastating weapons.\"\\n\\n Simple systems! He laughed aloud. \"Miles! Where the hell are you, Teg? I have your disguised attack vessels! Inflated decoys! Empty except for a miniature Holzmann generator and lasgun.\" He added this to his Archives transmissions.\\n\\n When he was finished, he asked himself once more about the visions. Influencing my dreams? What have I tapped?\\n\\n In every spare minute since becoming Teg\u0027s Weapons Master, he had been calling up Archival records. There had to be some clue in all of that massive accumulation!\\n\\n Resonances and tachyon theory held his attention for a time. Tachyon theory figured in Holzmann\u0027s original design. \"Techys,\" Holzmann had called his energy source.\\n\\n A wave system that ignored light speed\u0027s limits. Light speed obviously did not limit foldspace ships. Techys?\\n\\n \"It works because it works,\" Idaho muttered. \"Faith. Like any other religion.\"\\n\\n Mentats squirreled away much seemingly inconsequential data. He had a storehouse marked \"Techys\" and proceeded to go through it without satisfaction.\\n\\n Not even Guild Navigators professed knowledge of how they guided foldspace ships. Ixian scientists made machines to duplicate Navigator abilities but still could not define what they did.\\n\\n \"Holzmann\u0027s formulae can be trusted.\"\\n\\n No one claimed to understand Holzmann. They merely used his formulae because they worked. It was the \"ether\" of space travel. You folded space. One instant you were here and the next instant you were countless parsecs distant.\\n\\n Someone \"out there\" has found another way to use Holzmann\u0027s theories! It was a full Mentat Projection. He knew its accuracy from the new questions it produced.\\n\\n Murbella\u0027s Other Memory ramblings haunted him now even though he recognized basic Bene Gesserit teachings in them.\\n\\n Power attracts the corruptible. Absolute power attracts the absolutely corruptible. This is the danger of entrenched bureaucracy to its subject population. Even spoils systems are preferable because levels of tolerance are lower and the corrupt can be thrown out periodically. Entrenched bureaucracy seldom can be touched short of violence. Beware when Civil Service and Military join hands!\\n\\n The Honored Matre achievement.\\n\\n Power for the sake of power... an aristocracy bred from unbalanced stock.\\n\\n Who were those people he saw? Strong enough to drive out Honored Matres. He knew it for a Projection datum.\\n\\n Idaho found this realization profoundly dislocating. Honored Matres fugitives! Barbaric but ignorant in the way of all such raiders even from before the Vandals. Moved by impulsive greed as much as by any other force. \"Take Roman gold!\" They filtered all distractions out of awareness. It was a stupefying ignorance that faltered only when the more sophisticated culture insinuated itself into the...\\n\\n Abruptly, he saw what Odrade was doing.\\n\\n Gods below! What a fragile plan!\\n\\n He pressed his palms against his eyes and forced himself not to cry out in anguish. Let them think I\u0027m tired. But seeing Odrade\u0027s plan told him also he would lose Murbella... one way or another.\\n\\n When are the witches to be trusted? Never! The dark side of the magic universe belongs to the Bene Gesserit and we must reject them.\\n\\n - Tylwyth Waff, Master of Masters\\n\\n The great Common Room in the no-ship, with its tiered seating and raised platform at one end, was packed with Bene Gesserit Sisters, more than had ever before been assembled. Chapterhouse was almost at a standstill this afternoon because few wanted to send proxies and important decisions could not be delegated to service cadre. Black-robed Reverend Mothers dominated the assemblage in their aloof clusterings close to the stage but the room swirled with acolytes in white-trimmed robes and there were even the newly enrolled. Groups of white robes marking the youngest acolytes were sprinkled around in tight little groups, flocking for mutual support. All others had been excluded by Convocation Proctors.\\n\\n The air was heavy with melange-perfumed breaths and it had that dank, overused quality it got when conditioning machinery was overloaded. Odors of the recent lunch, strong with garlic, rode on this atmosphere like an uninvited intruder. This and stories being spread throughout the room heightened tensions.\\n\\n Most kept their attention on the raised platform and the side door where Mother Superior must enter. Even while talking to companions or moving about, they focused on that place where they knew someone soon would enter and create profound changes in their lives. Mother Superior did not herd them all into a great Common Room with a promise of important announcements unless something to shake the Bene Gesserit foundations was at hand.\\n\\n Bellonda preceded Odrade into the room, mounting to the platform with that belligerent waddle which made her easily recognizable even at a distance. Odrade followed Bellonda at five paces. Then came senior councillors and aides, black-robed Murbella (still looking somewhat dazed from her Agony only two weeks past) among them. Dortujla limped close behind Murbella with Tam and Sheeana at her side. At the end of this procession came Streggi carrying Teg on her shoulders. There were excited murmurs when he appeared. Males seldom shared assemblies but everyone on Chapterhouse knew this was the ghola of their Mentat Bashar, living now at the cantonment with all that remained of a Bene Gesserit military.\\n\\n Seeing the massed ranks of the Sisterhood this way, Odrade experienced an empty feeling. Some ancient had said it all, she thought. \"Any damned fool knows one horse can run faster than another.\" Often at the minor assemblages here in this copy of a sports stadium she had been tempted to quote that bit of advice but she knew the ritual had its better purposes as well. Assembly showed you to one another.\\n\\n Here we are together. Our kind.\\n\\n Mother Superior and attendants moved like a peculiar bundle of energy through the throng to the platform, her position of eminence at the edge of the arena.\\n\\n Mother Superior was never subjected to the mass scrimmage of assemblies. She never had elbows jammed into her ribs or felt the trodding of a neighbor\u0027s foot. She was never forced to move as others moved in a kind of inchworm flow composed of bodies pressed together in unwanted proximity.\\n\\n Thus did Caesar arrive. Thumbs down on the whole damned thing! To Bellonda, she said: \"Let it begin.\"\\n\\n Afterward, she knew she would wonder why she had not delegated someone to make this ritual appearance and utter portentous words. Bellonda would love the pre-eminent position and, for that reason, must never have it. But perhaps there was some lower echelon Sister who would be embarrassed by elevation and would obey only out of loyalty, out of that underlying need to do what Mother Superior commanded.\\n\\n Gods! If there are any of you around, why do you permit us to be such sheep?\\n\\n There they were, Bellonda preparing them for her. The battalions of the Bene Gesserit. They were not really battalions, but Odrade often imagined ranked Sisters, cataloging them by function. That one is a squad leader. That one is a Captain General. This one is a lowly sergeant and here is a messenger.\\n\\n The Sisters would be outraged if they knew this quirk in her. She kept it well concealed behind an \"ordinary assignment\" attitude. You could assign lieutenants without calling them lieutenants. Taraza had done the same thing.\\n\\n Bell was telling them now that the Sisterhood might have to make a new accommodation with their captive Tleilaxu. Bitter words for Bell: \"We have gone through the crucible, Tleilaxu and Bene Gesserit alike, and we have come out changed. In a way, we have changed each other.\"\\n\\n Yes, we are like rocks rubbed against each other for so long that each takes on some of the conforming shape required by the other. But the original rock is still there at the core!\\n\\n The audience was becoming restive. They knew this was preliminary, no matter the hidden message within these hints about Tleilaxu. Preliminary and relative in importance. Odrade stepped to Bellonda\u0027s side, signaling her to cut it short.\\n\\n \"Here is Mother Superior.\"\\n\\n How hard the old patterns die. Does Bell think they don\u0027t recognize me?\\n\\n Odrade spoke in compelling tones, just short of Voice.\\n\\n \"Actions have been taken that require me to meet on Junction with Honored Matre leadership, a meeting from which I may not emerge alive. I probably will not survive. That meeting will be partly distraction. We are about to punish them.\"\\n\\n Odrade waited for murmurs to subside, hearing both agreement and disagreement in the sounds. Interesting. The ones who agreed were closer to the stage and farther back among new acolytes. Disagreement from advanced acolytes? Yes. They knew the warning: We dare not feed that fire.\\n\\n She pitched her voice lower, letting remotes carry it to those in the high tiers. \"Before leaving, I will Share with more than one Sister. These times require such caution.\"\\n\\n \"Your plan?\" \"What will you do?\" Questions were shouted at her from many places.\\n\\n \"We will feint at Gammu. That should drive Honored Matre allies to Junction. We then will take Junction and, I hope, capture the Spider Queen.\"\\n\\n \"The attack will occur while you are on Junction?\" This question came from Garimi, a sober-faced Proctor directly below Odrade.\\n\\n \"That is the plan. I will be transmitting my observations to the attackers.\" Odrade gestured to Teg seated on Streggi\u0027s shoulders. \"The Bashar will lead the attack in person.\"\\n\\n \"Who goes with you?\" \"Yes. Who are you taking?\" No mistaking the worry in those cries. So the word had not yet spread through Chapterhouse.\\n\\n \"Tam and Dortujla,\" Odrade said.\\n\\n \"Who will Share with you?\" Garimi again. Indeed! That is the political question of most interest. Who may succeed Mother Superior? Odrade heard nervous stirring behind her. Bellonda excited? Not you, Bell. You already know that.\\n\\n \"Murbella and Sheeana,\" Odrade said. \"And one other if Proctors care to name a candidate.\"\\n\\n Proctors formed little consulting groups, shouting suggestions from group to group, but no names were submitted. Someone had a question though: \"Why Murbella?\"\\n\\n \"Who knows Honored Matres better?\" Odrade asked.\\n\\n That silenced them.\\n\\n Garimi moved closer to the stage and looked up at Odrade with a penetrating stare. Don\u0027t try to mislead a Reverend Mother, Darwi Odrade! \"After our feint at Gammu, they will be even more alert and reinforced on Junction. What makes you think we can take them?\"\\n\\n Odrade stepped aside and motioned Streggi forward with Teg.\\n\\n Teg had been watching Odrade\u0027s performance with fascination. He looked down now at Garimi. She was currently Chief Assignment Proctor and no doubt had been chosen to speak for a bloc of Sisters. It occurred to Teg then that this ludicrous position on the shoulders of an acolyte had been planned by Odrade for reasons other than those she voiced.\\n\\n To put my eyes closer to a level with adults around me... but also to remind them of my lesser stature, to reassure them that a Bene Gesserit (if only an acolyte) still controls my movements.\\n\\n \"I will not go into all of the weaponry details at the moment,\" he said. Damn this piping voice! He had their attention, though. \"But we are going for mobility, for decoys that will destroy a great deal of the area around them if a lasgun beam hits them... and we are going to englobe Junction with devices to reveal the movements of their no-ships.\"\\n\\n When they continued to stare at him, he said: \"If Mother Superior confirms my previous knowledge of Junction, we will know our enemy\u0027s positions intimately. There should not be significant changes. Not enough time has passed.\"\\n\\n Surprise and the unexpected. What else did they expect from their Mentat Bashar? He stared back at Garimi, daring her to voice more doubts of his military ability.\\n\\n She had another question. \"Are we to presume that Duncan Idaho advises you on weapons?\"\\n\\n \"When you have the best, you would be a fool not to use it,\" he said.\\n\\n \"But will he accompany you as Weapons Master?\"\\n\\n \"He chooses not to leave the ship and you all know why. What is the meaning of that question?\"\\n\\n He had deflected her and silenced her and she did not like it. A man should not be able to maneuver a Reverend Mother that way!\\n\\n Odrade stepped forward and put a hand on Teg\u0027s arm. \"Have you all forgotten that this ghola is our loyal friend, Miles Teg?\" She stared at particular faces in the throng, choosing ones she was certain watchdogged the comeyes and knew Teg was her father, moving her gaze from face to face with a deliberate slowness that could not be misinterpreted.\\n\\n Is there one among you who dares cry \"nepotism\"? Then look once more at his record in our service!\\n\\n Sounds of the Convocation became once more those in keeping with other graces they expected in assemblies. No more vulgar clash of demanding voices vying for attention. Now, they fitted their speech into a pattern much like plainsong and yet not quite a chant. Voices moved and flowed together. Odrade always found this remarkable. No one directed the harmony. It happened because they were Bene Gesserit. Naturally. This was the only explanation they needed. It happened because they were practiced in adjusting to each other. The dance of their everyday movements continued in their voices. Partners no matter transitory disagreements.\\n\\n I will miss this.\\n\\n \"It is never enough to make accurate predictions of distressful events,\" she said. \"Who knows this better than we? Is there one among us who has not learned the lesson of the Kwisatz Haderach?\"\\n\\n No need to elaborate. Evil prediction should not alter their course. That kept Bellonda silent. The Bene Gesserit were enlightened. Not dullards who attacked the bearer of bad tidings. Discount the messenger? (Who could expect anything useful from the likes of that one?) That was a pattern to be avoided at all costs. Will we silence disagreeable messengers, thinking the deep silence of death obliterates the message? The Bene Gesserit knew better than that! Death makes a prophet\u0027s voice louder. Martyrs are truly dangerous.\\n\\n Odrade watched reflexive awareness spread through the room, even up to the highest tiers.\\n\\n We are entering hard times, Sisters, and must accept that. Even Murbella knows it. And she knows now why I was so anxious to make a Sister of her. We all know it one way or another.\\n\\n Odrade turned and glanced at Bellonda. No disappointment there. Bell knew why she was not among the chosen. It\u0027s our best course, Bell. Infiltrate. Take them before they even suspect what we\u0027re doing.\\n\\n Shifting her gaze to Murbella, Odrade saw respectful awareness. Murbella was beginning to get her first batches of good advice from Other Memory. The manic stage had passed and she was even regaining a fondness for Duncan. In time perhaps... Bene Gesserit training assured that she would judge Other Memory on her own. Nothing in Murbella\u0027s stance said: \"Keep your lousy advice to yourself!\" She had historical comparisons and could not evade their obvious message.\\n\\n Don\u0027t march in the streets with others who share your prejudices. Loud shouts are often the easiest to ignore. \"I mean, look at them out there shouting their fool heads off! You want to make common cause with them?\"\\n\\n I told you, Murbella: Now judge for yourself. \"To create change you find leverage points and move them. Beware blind alleys. Offers of high positions are a common distraction paraded before marchers. Leverage points are not all in high office. They are often at economic or communications centers and unless you know this, high office is useless. Even lieutenants can alter our course. Not by changing reports but by burying unwanted orders. Bell sits on orders until she believes them ineffective. I give her orders sometimes for this purpose: so she can play her delaying game. She knows it and yet she plays her game anyway. Know this, Murbella! And after we Share, study my performance with great care.\"\\n\\n Harmony had been achieved but at a cost. Odrade signaled that Convocation was ended, knowing well that all questions had not been answered nor even asked. But the unasked questions would come filtering through Bell where they would get the most appropriate treatment.\\n\\n Alert ones among the Sisters would not ask. They already saw her plan.\\n\\n As she left the Great Common Room, Odrade felt herself accept full commitment for choices she had made, recognizing previous hesitancy for the first time. There were regrets, but only Murbella and Sheeana might know them.\\n\\n Walking behind Bellonda, Odrade thought about the places I will never go, the things I will never see except as a reflection in the life of another.\\n\\n It was a form of nostalgia that centered on the Scatterings and this eased her pain. There was just too much for one person to see out there. Even the Bene Gesserit with its accumulated memories could never hope to catch up with all of it, not with every last interesting detail. It was back to grand designs. The Big Picture, the Mainstream. The specialties of my Sisterhood. Here were essentials Mentats employed: patterns, movements of currents and what those currents carried, where they were going. Consequences. Not maps but the flowings.\\n\\n At least, I have preserved key elements of our jury-monitored democracy in original form. They may thank me for that one day.\\n\\n Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.\\n\\n - The Coda\\n\\n \"Who expected the air machinery to break down?\"\\n\\n The Rabbi asked his question of no one in particular. He sat on a low bench, a scroll clutched to his breast. The scroll had been reinforced by modern artifice but it still was old and fragile. He was not sure of the time. Midmorning probably. They had eaten not long ago food that could be described as breakfast.\\n\\n \"I expected it.\"\\n\\n He appeared to be addressing the scroll. \"Passover has come and gone and our door was locked.\"\\n\\n Rebecca came to stand over him. \"Please, Rabbi. How does this help Joshua at his labors?\"\\n\\n \"We have not been abandoned,\" the Rabbi told his scroll. \"It is we who have hidden ourselves away. When we cannot be found by strangers, where would anyone look who might help us?\"\\n\\n He peered up abruptly at Rebecca, owlish behind his glasses. \"Have you brought evil to us, Rebecca?\"\\n\\n She knew his meaning. \"Outsiders always think there\u0027s something nefarious about the Bene Gesserit,\" she said.\\n\\n \"So now I, your Rabbi, am Outsider!\"\\n\\n \"You estrange yourself, Rabbi. I speak from the viewpoint of the Sisterhood you made me help. What they do is often boring. Repetitious but not evil.\"\\n\\n \"I made you help? Yes, I did that. Forgive me, Rebecca. If evil joins us, I have done it.\"\\n\\n \"Rabbi! Stop this. They are an extended clan. And still, they keep a touchy individualism. Does an extended clan mean nothing to you? Does my dignity offend you?\"\\n\\n \"I tell you, Rebecca, what offends me. By my hand you have learned to follow different books than...\" He raised the scroll as though it were a bludgeon.\\n\\n \"No books at all, Rabbi. Oh, they have a Coda but it\u0027s just a collection of reminders, sometimes useful, sometimes to be discarded. They always adjust their Coda to current requirements.\"\\n\\n \"There are books that cannot be adjusted, Rebecca!\"\\n\\n She stared down at him with ill-concealed dismay. Was this how he saw the Sisterhood? Or was it fear talking?\\n\\n Joshua came to stand beside her, hands greasy, black smears on forehead and cheeks. \"Your suggestion was the right one. It\u0027s working again. How long I don\u0027t know. The problem is -\"\\n\\n \"You do not know the problem,\" the Rabbi interrupted.\\n\\n \"The mechanical problem, Rabbi,\" Rebecca said. \"This no-chamber\u0027s field distorts machinery.\"\\n\\n \"We could not bring in frictionless machinery,\" Joshua said. \"Too revealing, not to mention the cost.\"\\n\\n \"Your machinery is not all that has been distorted.\"\\n\\n Joshua looked at Rebecca with raised eyebrows. What\u0027s wrong with him? So Joshua trusted Bene Gesserit insights, too. That offended the Rabbi. His flock sought guidance elsewhere.\\n\\n The Rabbi surprised her then. \"You think I\u0027m jealous, Rebecca?\"\\n\\n She shook her head from side to side.\\n\\n \"You display talents,\" the Rabbi said, \"that others are quick to use. Your suggestion fixed the machinery? These... these Others told you how?\"\\n\\n Rebecca shrugged. This was the Rabbi of old, not to be challenged in his own house.\\n\\n \"I should praise you?\" the Rabbi asked. \"You have power? Now, you will govern us?\"\\n\\n \"No one, least of all I, ever suggested that, Rabbi.\" She was offended and did not mind showing it.\\n\\n \"Forgive me, daughter. That is what you call \u0027flip.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need your praise, Rabbi. And of course I forgive.\"\\n\\n \"Your Others have something to say about this?\"\\n\\n \"The Bene Gesserit say fear of praise goes back to an ancient prohibition against praising your child because that brings down the wrath of the gods.\"\\n\\n He bowed his head. \"Sometimes a bit of wisdom.\"\\n\\n Joshua appeared embarrassed. \"I\u0027m going to try sleeping. I should be rested.\" He aimed a meaningful glance at the machinery area where a labored rasping could be heard.\\n\\n He left them for the darkened end of the chamber, stumbling on a child\u0027s toy as he went.\\n\\n The Rabbi patted the bench beside him. \"Sit, Rebecca.\"\\n\\n She sat.\\n\\n \"I am fearful for you, for us, for all of the things we represent.\" He caressed the scroll. \"We have been true for so many generations.\" His gaze swept the room. \"And we don\u0027t even have a minyan here.\"\\n\\n Rebecca wiped tears from her eyes. \"Rabbi, you misjudge the Sisterhood. They wish only to perfect humans and their governments.\"\\n\\n \"So they say.\"\\n\\n \"So I say. Government, to them, is an art form. You find that amusing?\"\\n\\n \"You arouse my curiosity. Are these women self-deluded by dreams of their own importance?\"\\n\\n \"They think of themselves as watchdogs.\"\\n\\n \"Dogs?\"\\n\\n \"Watchdogs, alert to when a lesson may be taught. That is what they seek. Never try to teach someone a lesson he cannot absorb.\"\\n\\n \"Always these bits of wisdom.\" He sounded sad. \"And they govern themselves artistically?\"\\n\\n \"They think of themselves as a jury with absolute powers that no law can veto.\"\\n\\n He waved the scroll in front of her nose. \"I thought so!\"\\n\\n \"No human law, Rabbi.\"\\n\\n \"You tell me these women who make religions to suit themselves believe in a... in a power greater than themselves.\"\\n\\n \"Their belief would not accord with ours, Rabbi, but I do not think it evil.\"\\n\\n \"What is this... this belief?\"\\n\\n \"They call it the \u0027leveling drift.\u0027 They see it genetically and as instinct. Brilliant parents are likely to have children closer to the average, for example.\"\\n\\n \"A drift? This is a belief?\"\\n\\n \"That is why they avoid prominence. They are advisors, even king-makers on occasion, but they do not want to be in the target foreground. \"\\n\\n \"This drift... do they believe there is a Drift-Maker?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t assume there is. Only that there is this observable movement.\"\\n\\n \"So what do they do in this drift?\"\\n\\n \"They take precautions.\"\\n\\n \"In the presence of Satan, I should think so!\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t oppose the current but seem only to move across it, making it work for them, using the back eddies.\"\\n\\n \"Oyyy!\"\\n\\n \"Ancient sailing masters understood this quite well, Rabbi. The Sisterhood has what amounts to current charts telling them places to avoid and where to make their greatest efforts.\"\\n\\n Again, he waved the scroll. \"This is no current chart.\"\\n\\n \"You misinterpret, Rabbi. They know the fallacies about overwhelming machines.\" She glanced at the laboring machinery. \"They see us in currents machinery cannot breast.\"\\n\\n \"These little wisdoms. I do not know, daughter. Meddling in politics, I accept. But in holy matters...\"\\n\\n \"A leveling drift, Rabbi. Mass influence on brilliant innovators who move out of the pack and produce new things. Even when the new helps us, the drift catches the innovator.\"\\n\\n \"Who is to say what helps, Rebecca?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-25.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) \\n The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
