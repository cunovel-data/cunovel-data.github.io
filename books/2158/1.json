{"id":97540,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Those who would repeat the past must control the teaching of history.\n - Bene Gesserit Coda\n When the ghola-baby was delivered from the first Bene Gesserit axlotl tank, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade ordered a quiet celebration in her private dining room atop Central. It was barely dawn, and the two other members of her Council - Tamalane and Bellonda - showed impatience at the summons, even though Odrade had ordered breakfast served by her personal chef.\n \"It isn\u0027t every woman who can preside at the birth of her own father,\" Odrade quipped when the others complained they had too many demands on their time to permit of \"time-wasting nonsense.\"\n Only aged Tamalane showed sly amusement.\n Bellonda held her over-fleshed features expressionless, often her equivalent of a scowl.\n Was it possible, Odrade wondered, that Bell had not exorcised resentment of the relative opulence in Mother Superior\u0027s surroundings? Odrade\u0027s quarters were a distinct mark of her position but the distinction represented her duties more than any elevation over her Sisters. The small dining room allowed her to consult aides during meals.\n Bellonda glanced this way and that, obviously impatient to be gone. Much effort had been expended without success in attempts to break through Bellonda\u0027s coldly remote shell.\n \"It felt very odd to hold that baby in my arms and think: This is my father,\" Odrade said.\n \"I heard you the first time!\" Bellonda spoke from the belly, almost a baritone rumbling as though each word caused her vague indigestion.\n She understood Odrade\u0027s wry jest, though. The old Bashar Miles Teg had, indeed, been the Mother Superior\u0027s father. And Odrade herself had collected cells (as fingernail scrapings) to grow this new ghola, part of a long-time \"possibility plan\" should they ever succeed in duplicating Tleilaxu tanks. But Bellonda would be drummed out of the Bene Gesserit rather than go along with Odrade\u0027s comment on the Sisterhood\u0027s vital equipment.\n \"I find this frivolous at such a time,\" Bellonda said. \"Those madwomen hunting us to exterminate us and you want a celebration!\"\n Odrade held herself to a mild tone with some effort. \"If the Honored Matres find us before we are ready perhaps it will be because we failed to keep up our morale.\"\n Bellonda\u0027s silent stare directly into Odrade\u0027s eyes carried frustrating accusation: Those terrible women already have exterminated sixteen of our planets!\n Odrade knew it was wrong to think of those planets as Bene Gesserit possessions. The loosely organized confederation of planetary governments assembled after the Famine Times and the Scattering depended heavily on the Sisterhood for vital services and reliable communications, but old factions persisted - CHOAM, Spacing Guild, Tleilaxu, remnant pockets of the Divided God\u0027s priesthood, even Fish Speaker auxiliaries and schismatic assemblages. The Divided God had bequeathed humankind a divided Empire - all of whose factions were suddenly moot because of rampaging Honored Matre assaults from the Scattering. The Bene Gesserit - holding to most of their old forms - were the natural prime target for attack.\n Bellonda\u0027s thoughts never strayed far from this Honored Matre threat. It was a weakness Odrade recognized. Sometimes, Odrade hesitated on the point of replacing Bellonda, but even in the Bene Gesserit there were factions these days and no one could deny that Bell was a supreme organizer. Archives had never been more efficient than under her guidance.\n As she frequently did, Bellonda without even speaking the words managed to focus Mother Superior\u0027s attention on the hunters who stalked them with savage persistence. It spoiled the mood of quiet success Odrade had hoped to achieve this morning.\n She forced herself to think of the new ghola. Teg! If his original memories could be restored, the Sisterhood once more would have the finest Bashar ever to serve them. A Mentat Bashar! A military genius whose prowess already was the stuff of myths in the Old Empire.\n But would even Teg be of use against these women returned from the Scattering?\n By whatever gods may be, the Honored Matres must not find us! Not yet!\n Teg represented too many disturbing unknowns and possibilities. Mystery surrounded the period before his death in the destruction of Dune. He did something on Gammu to ignite the unbridled fury of the Honored Matres. His suicidal stand on Dune should not have been enough to bring this berserk response. There were rumors, bits and pieces from his days on Gammu before the Dune disaster. He could move too fast for the human eye to see! Had he done that? Another outcropping of wild abilities in Atreides genes? Mutation? Or just more of the Teg myth? The Sisterhood had to learn as soon as possible.\n An acolyte brought in three breakfasts and the sisters ate quickly, as though this interruption must be put behind them without delay because time wasted was dangerous.\n Even after the others had gone, Odrade was left with the aftershock of Bellonda\u0027s unspoken fears.\n And my fears.\n She arose and went to the wide window that looked across lower rooftops to part of the ring of orchards and pastures around Central. Late spring and already fruit beginning to form out there. Rebirth. A new Teg was born today! No feeling of elation accompanied the thought. Usually she found the view restorative but not this morning.\n What are my real strengths? What are my facts?\n The resources at a Mother Superior\u0027s command were formidable: profound loyalty in those who served her, a military arm under a Teg-trained Bashar (far away now with a large portion of their troops guarding the school planet, Lampadas), artisans and technicians, spies and agents throughout the Old Empire, countless workers who looked to the Sisterhood to protect them from Honored Matres, and all the Reverend Mothers with Other Memories reaching into the dawn of life.\n Odrade knew without false pride that she represented the peak of what was strongest in a Reverend Mother. If her personal memories did not provide needed information, she had others around her to fill the gaps. Machine-stored data as well, although she admitted to a native distrust of it.\n Odrade found herself tempted to go digging in those other lives she carried as secondary memory - these subterranean layers of awareness. Perhaps she could find brilliant solutions to their predicament in experiences of Others. Dangerous! You could lose yourself for hours, fascinated by the multiplicity of human variations. Better to leave Other Memories balanced in there, ready on demand or intruding out of necessity. Consciousness, that was the fulcrum and her grip on identity.\n Duncan Idaho\u0027s odd Mentat metaphor helped.\n Self-awareness: facing mirrors that pass through the universe, gathering new images on the way - endlessly reflexive. The infinite seen as finite, the analogue of consciousness carrying the sensed bits of infinity.\n She had never heard words come closer to her wordless awareness. \"Specialized complexity,\" Idaho called it. \"We gather, assemble, and reflect our systems of order.\"\n Indeed, it was the Bene Gesserit view that humans were life designed by evolution to create order.\n And how does that help us against these disorderly women who hunt us? What branch of evolution are they? Is evolution just another name for God?\n Her Sisters would sneer at such \"bootless speculation.\"\n Still, there might be answers in Other Memory.\n Ahhhh, how seductive!\n How desperately she wanted to project her beleaguered self into past identities and feel what it had been to live then. The immediate peril of this enticement chilled her. She felt Other Memory crowding the edges of awareness. \"It was like this!\" \"No! It was more like this!\" How greedy they were. You had to pick and choose, discreetly animating the past. And was that not the purpose of consciousness, the very essence of being alive?\n Select from the past and match it against the present: Learn consequences.\n That was the Bene Gesserit view of history, ancient Santayana\u0027s words resonating in their lives: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"\n The buildings of Central itself, this most powerful of all Bene Gesserit establishments, reflected that attitude wherever Odrade turned. Usiform, that was the commanding concept. Little about any Bene Gesserit working center was allowed to become nonfunctional, preserved out of nostalgia. The Sisterhood had no need for archeologists. Reverend Mothers embodied history.\n Slowly (much slower than usual) the view out her high window produced its calming effect. What her eyes reported, that was Bene Gesserit order.\n But Honored Matres could end that order in the next instant. The Sisterhood\u0027s situation was far worse than what they had suffered under the Tyrant. Many of the decisions she was forced to make now were odious. Her workroom was less agreeable because of actions taken here.\n Write off our Bene Gesserit Keep on Palma?\n That suggestion was in Bellonda\u0027s morning report waiting on the worktable. Odrade fixed an affirmative notation to it. \"Yes.\"\n Write it off because Honored Matre attack is imminent and we cannot defend them or evacuate them.\n Eleven hundred Reverend Mothers and the Fates alone knew how many acolytes, postulants, and others dead or worse because of that one word. Not to mention all of the \"Ordinary lives\" existing in the Bene Gesserit shadow.\n The strain of such decisions produced a new kind of weariness in Odrade. Was it a weariness of the soul? Did such a thing as a soul exist? She felt deep fatigue where consciousness could not probe. Weary, weary, weary.\n Even Bellonda showed the strain and Bell feasted on violence. Tamalane alone appeared above it but that did not fool Odrade. Tam had entered the age of superior observation that lay ahead of all Sisters if they survived into it. Nothing mattered then except observations and judgments. Most of this was never uttered except in fleeting expressions on wrinkled features. Tamalane spoke few words these days, her comments so sparse as to be almost ludicrous:\n \"Buy more no-ships.\"\n \"Brief Sheeana.\"\n \"Review Idaho records.\"\n \"Ask Murbella.\"\n Sometimes, only grunts issued from her, as though words might betray her.\n And always the hunters roamed out there, sweeping space for any clue to the location of Chapterhouse.\n In her most private thoughts, Odrade saw the no-ships of Honored Matres as corsairs on those infinite seas between the stars. They flew no black flags with skull and crossbones, but that flag was there nonetheless. Nothing whatsoever romantic about them. Kill and pillage! Amass your wealth in the blood of others. Drain that energy and build your killer no-ships on ways lubricated with blood.\n And they did not see they would drown in red lubricant if they kept on this course.\n There must be furious people out there in that human Scattering where Honored Matres originated, people who live out their lives with a single fixed idea: Get them!\n It was a dangerous universe where such ideas were allowed to float around freely. Good civilizations took care that such ideas did not gain energy, did not even get a chance for birth. When they did occur, by chance or accident, they were to be diverted quickly because they tended to gather mass.\n Odrade was astonished that the Honored Matres did not see this or, seeing it, ignored it.\n \"Full-blown hysterics,\" Tamalane called them.\n \"Xenophobia,\" Bellonda disagreed, always correcting, as though control of Archives gave her a better hold on reality.\n Both were right, Odrade thought. The Honored Matres behaved hysterically. All outsiders were the enemy. The only people they appeared to trust were the men they sexually enslaved, and those only to a limited degree. Constantly testing, according to Murbella (our only captive Honored Matre), to see if their hold was firm.\n \"Sometimes out of mere pique they may eliminate someone just as an example to others.\" Murbella\u0027s words and they forced the question: Are they making an example of us? \"See! This is what happens to those who dare oppose us!\"\n Murbella had said, \"You\u0027ve aroused them. Once aroused, they will not desist until they have destroyed you.\"\n Get the outsiders!\n Singularly direct. A weakness in them if we play it right, Odrade thought.\n Xenophobia carried to a ridiculous extreme?\n Quite possibly.\n Odrade pounded a fist on her worktable, aware that the action would be seen and recorded by Sisters who kept constant watch on Mother Superior\u0027s behavior. She spoke aloud then for the omnipresent comeyes and watchdog Sisters behind them.\n \"We will not sit and wait in defensive enclaves! We\u0027ve become as fat as Bellonda (and let her fret over that!) thinking we\u0027ve created an untouchable society and enduring structures.\"\n Odrade swept her gaze around the familiar room.\n \"This place is one of our weaknesses!\"\n She took her seat behind the worktable thinking (of all things!) about architecture and community planning. Well, that was a Mother Superior\u0027s right!\n Sisterhood communities seldom grew at random. Even when they took over existing structures (as they had with the old Harkonnen Keep on Gammu) they did so with rebuilding plans. They wanted pneumotubes to shunt small packages and messages. Lightlines and hardray projectors to transmit encrypted words. They considered themselves masters at safeguarding communications. Acolyte and Reverend Mother couriers (committed to self-destruction rather than betray their superiors) carried the more important messages.\n She could visualize it out there beyond her window and beyond this planet - her web, superbly organized and manned, each Bene Gesserit an extension of the others. Where Sisterhood survival was concerned, there was an untouchable core of loyalty. Backsliders there might be, some spectacular (as the Lady Jessica, grandmother of the Tyrant), but they slid only so far. Most upsets were temporary.\n And all of that was a Bene Gesserit pattern. A weakness.\n Odrade admitted a deep agreement with Bellonda\u0027s fears. But I\u0027ll be damned if I allow such things to depress all joy of living! That would be giving in to the very thing those rampaging Honored Matres wanted.\n \"It\u0027s our strengths the hunters want,\" Odrade said, looking up at the ceiling comeyes. Like ancient savages eating the hearts of enemies. Well... we will give them something to eat all right! And they will not know until too late that they cannot digest it!\n Except for preliminary teachings tailored to acolytes and postulants, the Sisterhood did not go in much for admonitory sayings, but Odrade had her own private watchwords: \"Someone has to do the plowing.\" She smiled to herself as she bent to her work much refreshed. This room, this Sisterhood, these were her garden and there were weeds to be removed, seeds to plant. And fertilizer. Mustn\u0027t forget the fertilizer.\n When I set out to lead humanity along my Golden Path I promised a lesson their bones would remember. I know a profound pattern humans deny with words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, conditions they call peace. Even as they speak, they create seeds of turmoil and violence.\n - Leto II, the God Emperor\n So she calls me Spider Queen!\n Great Honored Matre leaned back in a heavy chair set high on a dais. Her withered breast shook with silent chuckles. She knows what will happen when I get her in my web! Suck her dry, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do.\n A small woman with unremarkable features and muscles that twitched nervously, she looked down on the skylighted yellow-tile floor of her audience room. A Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother sprawled there in shigawire bindings. The captive made no attempt to struggle. Shigawire was excellent for this purpose. Cut her arms off, it would!\n The chamber where she sat suited Great Honored Matre as much for its dimensions as for the fact that it had been taken from others. Three hundred meters square, it had been designed for convocations of Guild Navigators here on Junction, each Navigator in a monstrous tank. The captive on that yellow floor was a mote in immensity.\n This weakling took too much joy in revealing what her so-called Superior named me!\n But it still was a lovely morning, Great Honored Matre thought. Except that no tortures or mental probes worked on these witches. How could you torture someone who might choose to die at any moment? And did! They had ways of suppressing pain, too. Very wily, these primitives.\n She\u0027s loaded with shere, too! A body infused with that damnable drug deteriorated beyond the reach of probes before it could be examined adequately.\n Great Honored Matre signaled an aide. That one nudged the sprawled Reverend Mother with a foot and, at a further signal, eased the shigawire bindings to allow minimal movement.\n \"What is your name, child?\" Great Honored Matre asked. Her voice rasped hoarsely with age and false bonhomie.\n \"I am called Sabanda.\" Clear young voice, still untouched by the pain of probings.\n \"Would you like to watch us capture a weak male and enslave him?\" Great Honored Matre asked.\n Sabanda knew the proper response to this. They had been warned. \"I will die first.\" She said it calmly, staring up at that ancient face the color of a dried root left too long in the sun. Those odd orange flecks in the crone\u0027s eyes. A sign of anger, Proctors had told her.\n A loosely hung red-gold robe with black dragon figures down its open face and red leotards beneath it only emphasized the scrawny figure they covered.\n Great Honored Matre did not change expression even with a recurrent thought about these witches: Damn them! \"What was your task on that dirty little planet where we took you?\"\n \"A teacher of the young.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid we didn\u0027t leave any of your young alive.\" Now why does she smile? To offend me! That\u0027s why!\n \"Did you teach your young ones to worship the witch, Sheeana?\" Great Honored Matre asked.\n \"Why should I teach them to worship a Sister? Sheeana would not like that.\"\n \"Would not... Are you saying she has come back to life and you know her?\"\n \"Is it only the living we know?\"\n How clear and fearless the voice of this young witch. They had remarkable self-control, but even that could not save them. Odd, though, how this cult of Sheeana persisted. It would have to be rooted out, of course, destroyed the way the witches themselves were being destroyed.\n Great Honored Matre lifted the little finger of her right hand. A waiting aide approached the captive with an injection. Perhaps this new drug would free a witch\u0027s tongue, perhaps not. No matter.\n Sabanda grimaced when the injector touched her neck. In seconds she was dead. Servants carried the body away. It would be fed to captive Futars. Not that Futars were much use. Wouldn\u0027t breed in captivity, wouldn\u0027t obey the most ordinary commands. Sullen, waiting.\n \"Where Handlers?\" one might ask. Or other useless words would spill from their humanoid mouths. Still, Futars provided some pleasures. Captivity also demonstrated they were vulnerable. Just as these primitive witches were. We\u0027ll find the witches\u0027 hiding place. It\u0027s only a matter of time.\n The person who takes the banal and ordinary and illuminates it in a new way can terrify. We do not want our ideas changed. We feel threatened by such demands. \"I already know the important things!\" we say. Then Changer comes and throws our old ideas away.\n - The Zensufi Master\n Miles Teg enjoyed playing in the orchards around Central. Odrade had first taken him here when he could just toddle. One of his earliest active memories: hardly more than two years old and already aware he was a ghola, though he did not understand the word\u0027s full meaning.\n \"You are a special child,\" Odrade said. \"We made you from cells taken from a very old man.\"\n Although he was a precocious child and her words had a vaguely disturbing sound, he was more interested then in running through tall summer grass beneath the trees.\n Later, he added other orchard days to that first one, accumulating as well impressions about Odrade and the others who taught him. He recognized quite early that Odrade enjoyed the excursions as much as he did.\n One afternoon in his fourth year, he told her: \"Spring is my favorite time.\"\n \"Mine, too.\"\n When he was seven and already showing the mental brilliance coupled to holographic memory that had caused the Sisterhood to place such heavy responsibilities on his previous incarnation, he suddenly saw the orchards as a place touching something deep inside him.\n This was his first real awareness that he carried memories he could not recall. Deeply disturbed, he turned to Odrade, who stood outlined in light against the afternoon sun, and said: \"There are things I can\u0027t remember!\"\n \"One day you will remember,\" she said.\n He could not see her face against the bright light and her words came from a great shadow place, as much within him as from Odrade.\n That year he began studying the life of the Bashar Miles Teg, whose cells had started his new life. Odrade had explained some of this to him, holding up her fingernails. \"I took tiny scrapings from his neck-cells of his skin and they held all we needed to bring you to life. \"\n There was something intense about the orchards that year, fruit larger and heavier, bees almost frenetic.\n \"It\u0027s because of the desert growing larger down there in the south,\" Odrade said. She held his hand as they walked through a dew-fresh morning beneath burgeoning apple trees.\n Teg stared southward through the trees, momentarily mesmerized by leaf-dappled sunlight. He had studied about the desert, and he thought he could feel the weight of it on this place.\n \"Trees can sense their end approaching,\" Odrade said. \"Life breeds more intensely when threatened.\"\n \"The air is very dry,\" he said. \"That must be the desert.\"\n \"Notice how some of the leaves have gone brown and curled at the edges? We\u0027ve had to irrigate heavily this year.\"\n He liked it that she seldom talked down to him. It was mostly one person to another. He saw curled brown on leaves. The desert did that.\n Deep in the orchard, they listened quietly for a time to birds and insects. Bees working the clover of a nearby pasture came to investigate but he was pheromone-marked, as were all who walked freely on Chapterhouse. They buzzed past him, sensed identifiers and went away about their business with blossoms.\n Apples. Odrade pointed westward. Peaches. His attention went where she directed. And yes, there were the cherries east of them beyond the pasture. He saw resin ribbing on the limbs.\n Seeds and young shoots had been brought here on the original no-ships some fifteen hundred years ago, she said, and had been planted with loving care.\n Teg visualized hands grubbing in dirt, gently patting earth around young shoots, careful irrigation, the fencing to confine the cattle to wild pastures around the first Chapterhouse plantations and buildings.\n By this time he already had begun learning about the giant sandworm the Sisterhood had spirited from Rakis. Death of that worm had produced creatures called sandtrout. Sandtrout were why the desert grew. Some of this history touched accounts of his previous incarnation - a man they called \"The Bashar.\" A great soldier who had died when terrible women called Honored Matres destroyed Rakis.\n Teg found such studies both fascinating and troubling. He sensed gaps in himself, places where memories ought to be. The gaps called out to him in dreams. And sometimes when he fell into reverie, faces appeared before him. He could almost hear words. Then there were times he knew the names of things before anyone told him. Especially names of weapons.\n Momentous things grew in his awareness. This entire planet would become desert, a change started because Honored Matres wanted to kill these Bene Gesserit who raised him.\n Reverend Mothers who controlled his life often awed him - black-robed, austere, those blue-in-blue eyes with absolutely no white. The spice did that, they said.\n Only Odrade showed him anything he took for real affection and Odrade was someone very important. Everyone called her Mother Superior and that was what she told him to call her except when they were alone in the orchards. Then he could call her Mother.\n On a morning walk near harvest time in his ninth year, just over the third rise in the apple orchards north of Central, they came on a shallow depression free of trees and lush with many different plants. Odrade put a hand on his shoulder and held him where they could admire black stepping-stones in a meander track through massed greenery and tiny flowers. She was in an odd mood. He heard it in her voice.\n \"Ownership is an interesting question,\" she said. \"Do we own this planet or does it own us?\"\n \" I like the smells here,\" he said.\n She released him and urged him gently ahead of her. \"We planted for the nose here, Miles. Aromatic herbs. Study them carefully and look them up when you get back to the library. Oh, do step on them!\" when he started to avoid a plant runner in his path.\n He placed his right foot firmly on green tendrils and inhaled pungent odors.\n \"They were made to be walked on and give up their savor,\" Odrade said. \"Proctors have been teaching you how to deal with nostalgia. Have they told you nostalgia often is driven by the sense of smell?\"\n \"Yes, Mother.\" Turning to look back at where he had stepped, he said: \"That\u0027s rosemary.\"\n \"How do you know?\" Very intense.\n He shrugged. \"I just know.\"\n \"That may be an original memory.\" She sounded pleased.\n As they continued their walk in the aromatic hollow, Odrade\u0027s voice once more became pensive. \"Each planet has its own character where we draw patterns of Old Earth. Sometimes, it\u0027s only a faint sketch, but here we have succeeded.\"\n She knelt and pulled a twig from an acid-green plant. Crushing it in her fingers, she held it to his nose. \"Sage.\"\n She was right but he could not say how he knew.\n \"I\u0027ve smelled that in food. Is that like melange?\"\n \"It improves flavor but won\u0027t change consciousness.\" She stood and looked down at him from her full height. \"Mark this place well, Miles. Our ancestral worlds are gone, but here we have recaptured part of our origins.\"\n He sensed she was teaching him something important. He asked Odrade: \"Why did you wonder if this planet owned us?\"\n \"My Sisterhood believes we are stewards of the land. Do you know about stewards?\"\n \"Like Roitiro, my friend Yorgi\u0027s father. Yorgi says his oldest sister will be steward of their plantation someday.\"\n \"Correct. We have a longer residence on some planets than any other people we know of but we are only stewards.\"\n \"If you don\u0027t own Chapterhouse, who does?\"\n \"Perhaps nobody. My question is: How have we marked each other, my Sisterhood and this planet?\"\n He looked up at her face then down at his hands. Was Chapterhouse marking him right now?\n \"Most of the marks are deep inside us.\" She took his hand. \"Come along.\" They left the aromatic dell and climbed up into Roitiro\u0027s domain, Odrade speaking as they went.\n \"The Sisterhood seldom creates botanical gardens,\" she said. \"Gardens must support far more than eyes and nose.\"\n \"Food?\"\n \"Yes, supportive first of our lives. Gardens, produce food. That dell back there is harvested for our kitchens.\"\n He felt her words flow into him, lodging there among the gaps. He sensed planning for centuries ahead: trees to replace building beams, to hold watersheds, plants to keep lake and river banks from crumbling, to hold topsoil safe from rain and wind, to maintain seashores and even in the waters to make places for fish to breed. The Bene Gesserit also thought of trees for shade and shelter, or to cast interesting shadows on lawns.\n \"Trees and other plants for all of our symbiotic relationships,\" she said.\n \"Symbiotic?\" It was a new word.\n She explained with something she knew he already had encountered - going out with others to harvest mushrooms.\n \"Fungi won\u0027t grow except in the company of friendly roots. Each has a symbiotic relationship with a special plant. Each growing thing takes something it needs from the other.\"\n She went on at length and, bored with learning, he kicked a clump of grass, then saw how she stared at him in that disturbing way. He had done something offensive. Why was it right to step on one growing thing and not on another?\n \"Miles! Grass keeps the wind from carrying topsoil into difficult places such as the bottoms of rivers.\"\n He knew that tone. Reprimanding. He stared down at the grass he had offended.\n \"These grasses feed our cattle. Some have seeds we eat in bread and other foods. Some cane grasses are windbreaks.\"\n He knew that! Trying to divert her, he said: \"Windbrakes?\" spelling it.\n She did not smile and he knew he had been wrong to think he could fool her. Resigned to it, he listened as she went on with the lesson.\n When the desert came, she told him, grapes, their taproots down several hundred meters, probably would be the last to go. Orchards would die first.\n \"Why do they have to die?\"\n \"To make room for more important life.\"\n \"Sandworms and melange.\"\n He saw he had pleased her by knowing the relationship between sandworms and the spice the Bene Gesserit needed for their existence. He was not sure how that need worked but he imagined a circle: Sandworms to sandtrout to melange and back again. And the Bene Gesserit took what they needed from the circle.\n He was still tired of all this teaching, and asked: \"If all these things are going to die anyway, why do I have to go back to the library and learn their names?\"\n \"Because you\u0027re human and humans have this deep desire to classify, to apply labels to everything.\"\n \"Why do we have to name things like that?\"\n \"Because that way we lay claim to what we name. We assume an ownership that can be misleading and dangerous.\"\n So she was back on ownership.\n \"My street, my lake, my planet,\" she said. \"My label forever. A label you give to a place or thing may not even last out your lifetime except as a polite sop granted by conquerors... or as a sound to remember in fear.\"\n \"Dune,\" he said.\n \"You are quick!\"\n \"Honored Matres burned Dune.\"\n \"They\u0027ll do the same to us if they find us.\"\n \"Not if I\u0027m your Bashar!\" The words were out of him without thought but, once spoken, he felt they might have some truth. Library accounts said the Bashar had made enemies tremble just by appearing on a battlefield.\n As though she knew what he was thinking, Odrade said: \"The Bashar Teg was just as famous for creating situations where no battle was necessary.\"\n \"But he fought your enemies.\"\n \"Never forget Dune, Miles. He died there.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"Do the Proctors have you studying Caladan yet?\"\n \"Yes. It\u0027s called Dan in my histories.\"\n \"Labels, Miles. Names are interesting reminders but most people don\u0027t make other connections. Boring history, eh? Names - convenient pointers, useful mostly with your own kind?\"\n \"Are you my kind?\" It was a question that plagued him but not in those words until this instant.\n \"We are Atreides, you and I. Remember that when you return to your study of Caladan.\"\n When they went back through the orchards and across a pasture to the vantage knoll with its limb-framed view of Central, Teg saw the administrative complex and its barrier plantations with new sensitivity. He held this close as they went down the fenced lane to the arch into First Street.\n \"A living jewel,\" Odrade called Central.\n As they passed under it, he looked up at the street name burned into the entrance arch. Galach in an elegant script with flowing lines, Bene Gesserit decorative. All streets and buildings were labeled in that same cursive.\n Looking around him at Central, the dancing fountain in the square ahead of them, the elegant details, he sensed a depth of human experience. The Bene Gesserit had made this place supportive in ways he did not quite fathom. Things picked up in studies and orchard excursions, simple things and complex, came to new focus. It was a latent Mentat response but he did not know this, only sensing that his unfailing memory had shifted some relationships and reorganized them. He stopped suddenly and looked back the way they had come - the orchard out there framed in the arch of the covered street. It was all related. Central\u0027s effluent produced methane and fertilizer. (He had toured the plant with a Proctor.)
