{"id":97555,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Yes, Dama.\" Someone else moved into Logno\u0027s attendant position. Dama did not turn to identify the replacement. There were always enough aides to carry out necessary orders. One was much like another except in the matter of threat. Logno was a constant threat. Keeps me alert. Dama inhaled deeply of the fresh air. It was going to be a good day precisely because that was what she desired. She gathered in her secret memories then and let them soothe her. Guldur be blessed! We\u0027ve found the place to rebuild our strength. Consolidation of the Old Empire was proceeding as planned. There could not be many witches\u0027 nests left out there and, once that damnable Chapterhouse was found, the limbs could be destroyed at leisure. Ix, now. There was a problem. Perhaps I should not have killed those two Ixian scientists yesterday. But the fools had dared demand \"more information\" from her. Demanded! And after saying they still had no solution to rearming The Weapon. Of course, they did not know it was a weapon. Did they? She could not be sure. So it had been a good thing to kill those two after all. Teach them a lesson. Bring us answers, not questions. She liked the order she and her Sisters were creating in the Old Empire. There had been too much wandering about and too many different cultures, too many unstable religions. Worship of Guldur will serve them as it serves us. She felt no mystical affinity to her religion. It was a useful tool of power. The roots were well known: Leto II, the one those witches called \"The Tyrant,\" and his father, Muad\u0027Dib. Consummate power brokers, both of them. Lots of schismatic cells around but those could be weeded out. Keep the essence. It was a well-lubricated machine. The tyranny of the minority cloaked in the mask of the majority. That was what the witch Lucilla had recognized. No way to let her live after discovering she knew how to manipulate the masses. The witch nests would have to be found and burned. Lucilla\u0027s perceptiveness clearly was not an isolated example. Her actions betrayed the workings of a school. They taught this thing! Fools! You had to manage reality or things really got out of control. Logno returned. Dama could always tell the sound of her footsteps. Furtive. \"The old witch will be brought from Buzzell,\" Logno said. \"And her attendants.\" \"Don\u0027t forget about the Futars.\" \"I have given the orders, Dama.\" Oily voice! You\u0027d like to feed me to the herd, wouldn\u0027t you, Logno? \"And tighten up security on the cages, Logno. Three more of them escaped last night. They were wandering around in the garden when I awoke.\" \"I was told, Dama. More cage guards have been assigned.\" \"And don\u0027t tell me they\u0027re harmless without a Handler.\" \"I do not believe that, Dama.\" And that\u0027s truth from her, for once. Futars terrify her. Good. \"I believe we have our power base, Logno.\" Dama turned, noting that Logno had encroached at least two millimeters into the danger zone. Logno saw it, too, and retreated. As close as you want in front where I can see you, Logno, but not behind my back. Logno saw the orange blaze in Dama\u0027s eyes and almost knelt. Definite bending of the knees. \"It is my eagerness to serve you, Dama!\" Your eagerness to replace me, Logno. \"What of that woman from Gammu? Odd name. What was it?\" \"Rebecca, Dama. She and some of her companions have... ahhh, temporarily eluded us. We will find them. They cannot get off the planet.\" \"You think I should have kept her here, don\u0027t you?\" \"It was wise to think of her as bait, Dama!\" \"She\u0027s still bait. That witch we found on Gammu did not go to those people by accident.\" \"Yes, Dama.\" Yes, Dama! But the subservient sound in Logno\u0027s voice was enjoyable. \"Well, get on with it!\" Logno scurried away. There were always those little cells of potential violence meeting secretly somewhere. Building up their mutual charges of hate, swarming out to disrupt the orderly lives around them. Someone always had to clean up after those disruptions. Dama sighed. Terror tactics were so... so temporary! Success, that was the danger. It had cost them an empire. If you waved your success around like a banner someone always wanted to cut you down. Envy! We will hold our success more cautiously this time. She fell into a semi-reverie, still alert to the sounds behind her, but relishing the evidence of new victories that had been displayed to her this morning. She liked to roll the names of captive planets silently on her tongue. Wallach, Kronin, Reenol, Ecaz, Bela Tegeuse, Gammu, Gamont, Niushe... Humans are born with a susceptibility to that most persistent and debilitating disease of intellect: self-deception. The best of all possible worlds and the worst get their dramatic coloration from it. As nearly as we can determine, there is no natural immunity. Constant alertness is required. - The Coda With Odrade away from Central (and probably only for a short time) Bellonda knew swift action was required. That damned Mentat-ghola is too dangerous to live! Mother Superior\u0027s party was barely out of sight into the lowering afternoon before Bellonda was on her way to the no-ship. Not for Bellonda a thoughtful approach through ring orchards. She ordered space on a tube, windowless, automatic, and fast. Odrade, too, had observers who might send unwanted messages. En route, Bellonda reviewed her assessment of Idaho\u0027s many lives, a record she had kept in Archives ready for quick retrieval. In the original and early gholas, his character had been dominated by impulsiveness. Quick to hate, quick to give loyalty. Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying impulsiveness remained. The Tyrant had called it to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern. He can be goaded by pride. His long service to the Tyrant fascinated her. Not only had he been a Mentat several times but there was evidence he had been a Truthsayer in more than one incarnation. Idaho\u0027s appearance reflected what she saw in her records. Interesting character lines, a look around the eyes and a set to his mouth that went with complex inner development. Why would Odrade not accept the danger of this man? Bellonda had felt frequent misgivings when Odrade spoke of Idaho with such flaunting of her emotions. \"He thinks clearly and directly. There\u0027s a fastidious cleanliness about his mind. It\u0027s restorative. I like him and I know that\u0027s a trivial thing to influence my decisions.\" She admits his influence! Bellonda found Idaho alone and seated at his console. His attention was fixed on a linear display she recognized: the no-ship\u0027s operational schematics. He washed the projection when he saw her. \"Hello, Bell. Been expecting you.\" He touched his console field and a door opened behind him. Young Teg entered and took up a position near Idaho, staring silently at Bellonda. Idaho did not invite her to sit or find a chair for her, forcing her to bring one from his sleeping chamber and place it facing him. When she was seated, he turned a look of wary amusement on her. Bellonda remained taken aback by his greeting. Why did he expect me? He answered her unspoken question. \"Dar projected earlier, told me she was off to see Sheeana. I knew you\u0027d waste no time getting to me when she was gone.\" Simple Mentat projection or... \"She warned you!\" \"Wrong.\" \"What secrets do you and Sheeana share?\" Demanding. \"She uses me the way you want her to use me.\" \"The Missionaria!\" \"Bell! Two Mentats together. Must we play these stupid games?\" Bellonda took a deep breath and sought Mentat mode. Not easy under these circumstances, that child staring at her, the amusement on Idaho\u0027s face. Was Odrade displaying an unsuspected slyness? Working against a Sister with this ghola? Idaho relaxed when he saw Bene Gesserit intensity become that doubled focus of the Mentat. \"I\u0027ve known for a long time that you want me dead, Bell.\" Yes... I have been readable in my fears. It had been very close there, he thought. Bellonda had come to him with death in mind, a little drama to create \"the necessity\" all prepared. He entertained few illusions about his ability to match her in violence. But Bellonda-Mentat would observe before acting. \"It\u0027s disrespectful the way you use our first names,\" she said, goading. \"Different recognition, Bell. You\u0027re no longer Reverend Mother and I\u0027m not \u0027the ghola.\u0027 Two human beings with common problems. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re unaware of this.\" She glanced around his workroom. \"If you expected me why didn\u0027t you have Murbella here?\" \"Force her to kill you while protecting me?\" Bellonda assessed this. The damned Honored Matre probably could kill me, but then... \"You sent her away to protect her.\" \"I\u0027ve a better protector.\" He gestured at the child. Teg? A protector? There were those stories from Gammu about him. Does Idaho know something? She wanted to ask but did she dare risk diversion? Watchdogs must receive a clear scenario of danger. \"Him?\" \"Would he serve the Bene Gesserit if he saw you kill me?\" When she did not answer, he said: \"Put yourself in my place, Bell. I\u0027m a Mentat caught not only in your trap but in that of the Honored Matres.\" \"Is that all you are, a Mentat?\" \"No. I\u0027m a Tleilaxu experiment but I don\u0027t see the future. I\u0027m not a Kwisatz Haderach. I\u0027m a Mentat with memories of many lives. You, with your Other Memories - think about the leverage that gives me.\" While he was speaking, Teg came to lean against the console at Idaho\u0027s elbow. The boy\u0027s expression was one of curiosity but she saw no fear of her. Idaho gestured at the projection focus over his head, silver motes dancing there ready to create their images. \"A Mentat sees his relays producing discrepancies - winter scenes in summer, sunshine when his visitors have come through rain... Didn\u0027t you expect me to discount your little playlets?\" She heard Mentat summation. To that extent, they shared common teaching. She said: \"You naturally told yourself not to minimize the Tao.\" \"I asked different questions. Things that happen together can have underground links. What is cause and effect when confronted with simultaneity?\" \"You had good teachers.\" \"And not just in one life.\" Teg leaned toward her. \"Did you really come here to kill him?\" No sense lying. \"I still think he is too dangerous.\" Let watchdogs argue that! \"But he\u0027s going to give me back my memories!\" \"Dancers on a common floor, Bell,\" Idaho said. \"Tao. We may not appear to dance together, may not use the same steps or rhythms but we are seen together.\" She began to suspect where he might be leading and wondered if there might be another way to destroy him. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Teg said. \"Interesting coincidences,\" Idaho said. Teg turned to Bellonda. \"Maybe you would explain, please?\" \"He\u0027s trying to tell me we need each other.\" \"Then why doesn\u0027t he say so?\" \"It\u0027s more subtle than that, boy.\" And she thought: The record must show me warning Idaho. \"The nose of the donkey doesn\u0027t cause the tail, Duncan, no matter how often you see the beast pass that thin vertical space limiting your view of it.\" Idaho met Bellonda\u0027s fixed gaze. \"Dar came here once with a sprig of apple blossoms, but my projection showed harvest time.\" \"It\u0027s riddles, isn\u0027t it!\" Teg said, clapping his hands. Bellonda recalled the record of that visit. Precise movements by Mother Superior. \"You didn\u0027t suspect a hothouse?\" \"Or that she just wanted to please me?\" \"Am I supposed to guess?\" Teg asked. After a long silence, Mentat gaze locked to Mentat gaze, Idaho said: \"There\u0027s anarchy behind my confinement, Bell. Disagreement in your highest councils.\" \"There can be deliberation and judgment even in anarchy,\" she said. \"You\u0027re a hypocrite, Bell!\" She drew back as though he had struck her, a purely involuntary movement that shocked her by the forced reaction. Voice? No... something reaching deeper. She was suddenly terrified of this man. \"I find it marvelous that a Mentat and a Reverend Mother could be such a hypocrite,\" he said. Teg tugged at Idaho\u0027s arm. \"Are you fighting?\" Idaho brushed the hand away. \"Yes, we\u0027re fighting.\" Bellonda could not tear her gaze from Idaho\u0027s. She wanted to turn and flee. What was he doing? This had gone completely awry! \"Hypocrites and criminals among you?\" he asked. Once more, Bellonda remembered the comeyes. He was playing not only her but the watchers as well! And doing it with exquisite care. She was suddenly filled with admiration for his performance but this did not allay her fear. \"I ask why your Sisters tolerate you?\" His lips moved with such delicate precision! \"Are you a necessary evil? A source of valuable data and, occasionally, good advice?\" She found her voice. \"How dare you?\" Guttural and containing all of her vaunted viciousness. \"It could be that you strengthen your Sisters.\" Voice flat, not changing tone in the slightest. \"Weak links create places others must reinforce and that would strengthen those others.\" Bellonda realized she was barely keeping her hold on Mentat mode. Could any of this be true? Was it possible Mother Superior saw her that way? \"You came with criminal disobedience in mind,\" he said. \"All in the name of necessity! A little drama for the comeyes, proving you had no other choice.\" She found his words restoring Mentat abilities. Did he do that knowingly? She was fascinated by the need to study his manner as well as his words. Did he really read her that well? The record of this encounter might be far more valuable than her little playlet. And the outcome no different! \"You think Mother Superior\u0027s wishes are law?\" she asked. \"Do you really think me unobservant?\" Waving a hand at Teg, who started to interrupt. \"Bell! Be only a Mentat.\" \"I hear you.\" And so do many others! \"I\u0027m deep into your problem.\" \"We\u0027ve given you no problem!\" \"But you have. You have, Bell. You\u0027re misers the way you parcel out the pieces but I see it.\" Bellonda abruptly remembered Odrade saying: \"I don\u0027t need a Mentat! I need an inventor.\" \"You... need... me,\" Idaho said. \"Your problem is still in its shell but the meat\u0027s there and must be extracted.\" \"Why would we possibly need you?\" \"You need my imagination, my inventiveness, things that kept me alive in the face of Leto\u0027s wrath.\" \"You\u0027ve said he killed you so many times you lost count.\" Eat your own words, Mentat! He gave her an exquisitely controlled smile, so precise that neither she nor the comeyes could mistake its intent. \"But how can you trust me, Bell?\" He condemns himself! \"Without something new you\u0027re doomed,\" he said. \"Only a matter of time and you all know it. Perhaps not this generation. Perhaps not even the next one. But inevitably.\" Teg pulled sharply at Idaho\u0027s sleeve. \"The Bashar could help, couldn\u0027t he?\" So the boy really listened. Idaho patted Teg\u0027s arm. \"The Bashar\u0027s not enough.\" Then to Bellonda: \"Underdogs together. Must we growl over the same bone?\" \"You\u0027ve said that before.\" And doubtless will say it again. \"Still Mentat?\" he asked. \"Then discard drama! Get the romantic haze off our problem.\" Dar\u0027s the romantic! Not me! \"What\u0027s romantic,\" he asked, \"about little pockets of Scattered Bene Gesserit waiting to be slaughtered?\" \"You think none will escape?\" \"You\u0027re seeding the universe with enemies,\" he said. \"You\u0027re feeding Honored Matres!\" She was fully (and only) Mentat then, required to match this ghola ability for ability. Drama? Romance? The body got in the way of Mentat performance. Mentats must use the body, not let it interfere. \"No Reverend Mother you\u0027ve Scattered has ever returned or sent a message,\" he said. \"You try to reassure yourselves by saying only the Scattered ones know where they go. How can you ignore the message they send in this other fact? Why has not one tried to communicate with Chapterhouse?\" He\u0027s chiding all of us, damn him! And he\u0027s right. \"Have I stated our problem in its most elemental form?\" Mentat questioning! \"Simplest question, simplest projection,\" she agreed. \"Amplified sexual ecstasy: Bene Gesserit imprint? Are Honored Matres trapping your people out there?\" \"Murbella?\" A one-word challenge. Assess this woman you say you love! Does she know things we should know? \"They\u0027re conditioned against raising their own enjoyment to addictive levels but they are vulnerable.\" \"She denies there are Bene Gesserit sources in Honored Matre history.\" \"As she was conditioned to do.\" \"A lust for power instead?\" \"At last, you have asked a proper question.\" And when she did not reply, he said: \"Mater Felicissima.\" Addressing her by the ancient term for Bene Gesserit Council members. She knew why he did it and felt the word produce the wanted effect. She was firmly balanced now, Mentat Reverend Mother encompassed by the mohalata of her own Spice Agony - that union of benign Other Memory protecting her from domination by malignant ancestors. How did he know to do that? Every observer behind the comeyes would be asking that question. Of course! The Tyrant trained him thus, time and time again. What do we have here? What is this talent Mother Superior dares employ? Dangerous, yes, but far more valuable than I suspected. By the gods of our own creation! Is he the tool to free us? How calm he was. He knew he had caught her. \"In one of my lives, Bell, I visited your Bene Gesserit house on Wallach IX and there talked to one of your ancestors, Tersius Helen Anteac. Let her guide you, Bell. She knows.\" Bellonda felt familiar prodding in her mind. How could he know Anteac was my ancestor? \"I went to Wallach IX at the Tyrant\u0027s command,\" he said. \"Oh, yes! I often thought of him as Tyrant. My orders were to suppress the Mentat school you thought you had hidden there.\" Anteac-simulflow intruded: \"I show you now the event of which he speaks.\" \"Consider,\" he said. \"I, a Mentat, forced to suppress a school that trained people the way I was trained. I knew why he ordered it, of course, and so do you.\" Simulflow poured it through her awareness: Order of Mentats, founded by Gilbertus Albans; temporary sanctuary with Bene Tleilax who hoped to incorporate them into Tleilaxu hegemony; spread into uncounted \"seed schools\"; suppressed by Leto II because they formed a nucleus of independent opposition; spread into the Scattering after the Famine. \"He kept a few of the finest teachers on Dune, but the question Anteac forces you to confront now does not go there. Where have your Sisters gone, Bell?\" \"We have no way of knowing yet, do we?\" She looked at his console with new awareness. It was wrong to block such a mind. If they were to use him, they must use him fully. \"By the way, Bell,\" as she stood to leave. \"Honored Matres could be a relatively small group.\" Small? Didn\u0027t he know how the Sisterhood was being overwhelmed by terrifying numbers on planet after planet? \"All numbers are relative. Is there something in the universe truly immovable? Our Old Empire could be a last retreat for them, Bell. A place to hide and try to regroup.\" \"You suggested that before... to Dar.\" Not Mother Superior. Not Odrade. Dar. He smiled. \"And perhaps we could help with Scytale.\" \"We?\" \"Murbella to gather information, I to assess it.\" He did not like the smile this produced. \"Precisely what are you suggesting?\" \"Let our imaginations roam and fashion our experiments accordingly. Of what use would even a no-planet be if someone could penetrate the shielding?\" She glanced at the boy. Idaho knew their suspicion that the Bashar had seen the no-ships? Naturally! A Mentat of his abilities... bits and pieces assembled into a masterful projection. \"It would require the entire output of a G-3 sun to shield any halfway livable planet.\" Dry and very cool the way she looked down at him. \"Nothing is out of the question in the Scattering.\" \"But not within our present capabilities. Do you have something less ambitious?\" \"Review the genetic markers in the cells of your people. Look for common patterns in Atreides inheritance. There may be talents you have not even guessed.\" \"Your inventive imagination bounces around.\" \"G-3 suns to genetics. There may be common factors.\" Why these mad suggestions? No-planets and people for whom prescient shields are transparent? What is he doing? She did not flatter herself that he spoke only for her benefit. There were always the comeyes. He remained silent, one arm thrown negligently across the boy\u0027s shoulders. Both of them watching her! A challenge? Be a Mentat if you can! No-planets? As the mass of an object increased, energy to nullify gravitation passed thresholds matched to prime numbers. No-shields met even greater energy barriers. Another magnitude of exponential increase. Was Idaho suggesting that someone in the Scattering might have found a way around the problem? She asked him. \"Ixians have not penetrated Holzmann\u0027s unification concept,\" he said. \"They merely use it - a theory that works even when you don\u0027t understand it.\" Why does he direct my attention to the technocracy of Ix? Ixians had their fingers in too many pies for the Bene Gesserit to trust them. \"Aren\u0027t you curious why the Tyrant never suppressed Ix?\" he asked. And when she continued to stare at him: \"He only bridled them. He was fascinated by the idea of human and machine inextricably bound to each other, each testing the limits of the other.\" \"Cyborgs?\" \"Among other things.\" Didn\u0027t Idaho know the residue of revulsion left by the Butlerian Jihad even among the Bene Gesserit? Alarming! The convergence of what each - human and machine - could do. Considering machine limitations, that was a succinct description of Ixian shortsightedness. Was Idaho saying the Tyrant subscribed to the idea of Machine Intelligence? Foolishness! She turned away from him. \"You\u0027re leaving too quickly, Bell. You should be more interested in Sheeana\u0027s immunity to sexual bonding. The young men I send for polishing are not imprinted and neither is she. Yet no Honored Matre is more of an adept.\" Bellonda saw now the value Odrade placed in this ghola. Priceless! And I might have killed him. This nearness of that error filled her with dismay. When she reached the doorway, he stopped her once more. \"The Futars I saw on Gammu - why were we told they hunt and kill Honored Matres? Murbella knows nothing of this.\" Bellonda left without looking back. Everything she had learned about Idaho today increased his danger... but they had to live with it... for now. Idaho took a deep breath and looked at the puzzled Teg. \"Thank you for being here and I do appreciate the fact that you remained silent in the face of great provocation.\" \"She wouldn\u0027t really have killed you... would she?\" \"If you had not gained me those first few seconds, she might have.\" \"Why?\" \"She has the mistaken idea that I might be a Kwisatz Haderach.\" \"Like Muad\u0027Dib?\" \"And his son.\" \"Well, she won\u0027t hurt you now.\" Idaho looked at the door where Bellonda had gone. Reprieve. That was all he had achieved. Perhaps he no longer was just a cog in the machinations of others. They had achieved a new relationship, one that could keep him alive if carefully exploited. Emotional attachments had never figured in it, not even with Murbella... nor with Odrade. Deep down, Murbella resented sexual bondage as much as he did. Odrade might hint at ancient ties of Atreides loyalty but emotions in a Reverend Mother could not be trusted. Atreides! He looked at Teg, seeing family appearance already beginning to shape the immature face. And what have I really achieved with Bell? They no longer were likely to provide him with false data. He could place a certain reliance in what a Reverend Mother told him, coloring this by awareness that any human might make mistakes. I\u0027m not the only one in a special school. The Sisters are in my school now! \"May I go find Murbella?\" Teg asked. \"She promised to teach me how to fight with my feet. I don\u0027t think the Bashar ever learned that.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-16.html","bookId":2158,"book":{"id":2158,"title":"Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6)","description":"Storyline: Chapterhouse: Dune (Dune Chronicles #6) The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed.
