You cross the bridge and get to an area that looks nice still. It used to be a medical research building. The name on the front of it is Luminarc. But the sign is old and decrepit. It says umina. U-M-I-N-A. Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\\n\\n I watch his face and nod, \"You\u0027re leaving us.\"\\n\\n He laughs, \"Yeah. I\u0027m not going in there. You\u0027ll be safe from the military in there. It\u0027s the infected, and possibly the others, that you\u0027ll need to worry about.\"\\n\\n I don’t know him, but I don’t want him to go back there. I grab his hand, in an act that is completely awkward for me, \"I know where a retreat is. You can go there and just rest. The people will help you.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"I have to go back and help as much as I can. I\u0027m one of the few on the inside, who are trying to stop it.\"\\n\\n I frown, \"Why?\"\\n\\n His leathery smile doesn’t reach his eyes, \"I\u0027m your dad\u0027s right-hand man. He doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m not on his side.\"\\n\\n My eyebrows knit together, \"You will go back there and live like this?\" The words are awkward.\\n\\n He nods, \"I have to. I\u0027m the only hope for a lot of the women. The facility is quite nice.\"\\n\\n \"I was there—it was a shit show.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"The building where you were being kept isn’t the facility. It\u0027s down the way, closer to the nice part of the city that’s still standing. My life there is nice. I\u0027m supposed to be on a convoy this week. The rebels are making sure it\u0027s destroyed. I\u0027ll be the only survivor. I\u0027m heading there now, opposite direction of where you\u0027re going.\"\\n\\n His eyes are so familiar and suddenly I see it, \"You were the first doctor in the room with the cold table. The one who was nice to me?\"\\n\\n He nods, \"I was. I planned on getting you out, but I needed the abortion to be completed. I couldn’t release you into the world pregnant. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I swallow, \"Why?\" Anna draws nearer to me but I scowl at her, \"Keep your distance. I have it on me. I need soap.\"\\n\\n She steps back as he ignores us and continues, \"You already live with the possibility of being unstable. Your emotions are so heightened compared to normal girls. It\u0027s a problem with the DNA. You don\u0027t have normal emotions. You don’t feel things normally. Everything is bigger and faster in your world. We don’t know what someone like you would make. You have to try not to ever have a baby, Emma.\" He hangs his head, like he\u0027s ashamed.\\n\\n I didn’t have that as an option for myself, not in the world I lived in, but his words hurt me. I\u0027m ashamed Anna has heard them. I\u0027m a freak. How many times could he say the words not normal?\\n\\n I feel my anger rising, but I force myself to remain calm. A thousand flashes pass behind my eyes as I see it all. I nod, \"Okay.\"\\n\\n He grabs my arms and squeezes, \"You deserve to be free. Your father is a monster. Run and don\u0027t ever come back. Stay hidden away. Stay away from other people. You don’t know when your brain will switch and you\u0027ll become one of the Gen kids in every way. The rage and irrational behavior is a side effect. Your father doesn’t see it. He is constantly trying to perfect them, but he sees only the positives, he misses the negatives. I know you\u0027ve proven you don’t have the irrational behavior, but you never know. Better to be safe.\"\\n\\n I almost twitch, thinking about the times I\u0027ve done things he would call irrational. Would I though? I can justify every action in my mind. I am instantly wondering what Anna is thinking. I can\u0027t look at her.\\n\\n I need Leo.\\n\\n \"How will you get back?\" Anna asks him, changing the subject.\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"Don\u0027t worry about me. Get to the wolf and get out. You\u0027re one of a kind, Emma. You should know that, at least. What you did back there with the infected and the gunmen—you\u0027re one of a kind. The other Gen kids are a disaster. I think you are what we had planned all along.\"\\n\\n I could spit on him. \"I don’t care. I just wanna go home.\" That\u0027s not the truth. I want to stop my father who was my uncle. What a mess.\\n\\n I look both ways, because it\u0027s how I still cross streets, and walk across the broken filthy road. I can hear Anna following with the gun. The destroyed concrete crunches under the crappy boots he gave me. I\u0027m exhausted and I haven’t even started yet. I climb the wall of crap on the side of the road and look into the street. The infected are not there. I expected hordes, but I don\u0027t see any.\\n\\n I look back at him. He waves. He looks desperate and beat down.\\n\\n I hate him. Him and everything he represents. \"Stupid bastard,\" I mutter and pull my knives out. I glance at Anna who grins and tightens her grip on the gun.\\n\\n \"I don’t care what he says; you\u0027re amazing, Em.\" She nudges me and starts down the hill of debris into the infected zone.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" I don’t feel amazing. I feel not normal. I guess I always have and now I have a reason to feel that way.\\n\\n Chapter Five\\n\\n The infected move fast. Not as fast as we can—thank god. The gun helps a lot. It, and the fact, Anna is a deadly shot. The ones that get close, as we race through the alley, get cut. I already have their blood on me.\\n\\n We entered the alley and didn\u0027t see any at first, but when we got in deeper, we could see them moving about. They never move when you\u0027re looking for them. Damned infected.\\n\\n Their infected blood scares me still, but I assume I\u0027m already sick if I can get it. We get to the end of the next alley. My thighs hurt from the running. Everything hurts. My body is weak from the little food I\u0027ve eaten and the way I\u0027ve laid around.\\n\\n I look behind at the horde of them running after us, the high moans are grating on my skin. Anna fires a shot, dropping one in front of us.\\n\\n I heave for breath and look around. I see a building with a smashed-in window.\\n\\n \"Anna, here,\" I shout and run to it. I smash out the glass more and leap into the window. She is in and falling on me, before I can get out of the way.\\n\\n Before I can scream for her to get off of me and get away from the possible infection on my clothes, the stink hits my nose, filling my eyes with water.\\n\\n \"Sweet God,\" Anna gags and covers her face.\\n\\n I can\u0027t ignore the stench of rotting flesh and possible sewage. The room is no doubt filed with germs. I don’t know how they work but the room is bad. There isn’t anything in here but office equipment but the smell must be coming from somewhere.\\n\\n I grab the bookcase at the side of the wall and tip it over. It slides across the window. My head is jerking and twitching as I gag and heave. Anna moves another shelf against the one I put there. I can taste the dead in the air.\\n\\n \"Leo and then the forest,\" I whisper, trying to calm myself down.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait for the forest. I can\u0027t wait to go swimming,\" she mutters.\\n\\n I move a leather couch in front of the bookcase and run to the door of the office.\\n\\n She follows me. The hallway is dark. Instantly, I want to turn around but I can hear the infected at the window. Their high moans and screams make my skin crawl. The stench in the hallway is worse. I step out into the darkness. The only light is coming from the door I am leaving behind. I walk quickly into the abyss with my hands extended, running my blood-soaked knives along the wall. My left hand drops into a doorway. I lower my hand, searching for the knob. It\u0027s locked. I continue walking. My feet meet soft things and crunchy things, but I keep walking. I\u0027m grateful for the dark and for her.\\n\\n \"Thanks for coming for me,\" I whisper.\\n\\n \"You did it for me. No one leaves their family behind.\"\\n\\n Her words bring tears to my eyes. Even after everything she\u0027s heard, she still calls me family. Even though I\u0027m not a normal kid/woman/girl.\\n\\n The high moans are the only sounds, beyond my breathing and the scratch of my knives on the wall.\\n\\n I ignore when my right hand slips into a doorway. I need to get out the other side, opposite the infected horde behind me. The feeling of their hands grabbing for me, lingers on my arms. I shiver as my left hand drops into a doorway again. I grab the handle. It\u0027s unlocked. I open it slowly. The air is stale but less like rotting flesh. Dim light filters in the room.\\n\\n The high moans sound like they\u0027re in the building as I slip inside and close the door. I lock it and drag a desk from the inside over to the door. It\u0027s a small office with rotting furniture and dust. Layers of dust. The smell in the stale air is the dust and mildew getting into the furniture. The small windows are closed. They don’t open but there is a door.\\n\\n \"That looks like what we\u0027re looking for,\" she mutters.\\n\\n It still has a sign over it that says ‘Open in Case of Emergency’.\\n\\n \"Feels like an emergency,\" I mutter back. She laughs.\\n\\n I grip the lock and take a deep breath. The windows show no signs of life, just broken down shit and bushes. The city is slowly becoming the jungle again.\\n\\n \"See anything?\" I ask. She shakes her head and scouts the street.\\n\\n A scratch at the door startles us both. I turn, holding my breath and waiting. Not only have they made it inside, but they can smell us. I\u0027m not sure how they can smell us over the rotting things in the dark hallway. Then I look down at my crotch and wince. The miscarriage. It\u0027s disturbing on so many levels.\\n\\n I look out the windows again, as I turn the lock and open the door. I should have waited. I\u0027m panicking as I peek my head out, but the scratches have become thumps on the doors.\\n\\n The fresh air of the city is welcomed. My nostrils are burning from the other smells. I look both ways and step out into it. God only knows, what waits for us.\\n\\n Anna closes the door and we turn and run. I don’t even care if more of them chase us, we just need to run. I need Leo. I\u0027m close, I think.\\n\\n Something moves to the right of me, but I ignore it. I run. It chases us, but the gun goes off.\\n\\n In its place, I can hear footsteps behind us. I get to a wall of debris, like the one I climbed over to get into the infected section. I jump at it. I\u0027m clawing and climbing. Anna is doing the same. We scramble up fast and furiously. I can hear them behind us, the ones who saw us running in the alley. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-9.html","bookId":1605,"book":{"id":1605,"title":"Born to Fight (Born #2)","description":"Storyline: Born to Fight (Born #2) \\n When Emma wakes strapped to a cold metal table she has only one name on her lips, \"Marshall!\" What she doesn\u0027t expect is discovering that he is only one of the disturbing people in her small world who deserves to die in a fiery death. \\n Twenty years ago scientists made some remarkable discoveries with genetics and the ability to perfect the babies we gave birth to. \\n Ten years ago the governments of the world made a hard choice, earth or people. \\n Nine weeks ago the choices they made came full circle. \\n Fourteen days ago the truth of their mutations leaked out into the borderlands and other areas. \\n Yesterday the worst thing they ever made learned about what she was. \\n Today she\u0027s coming for them and she knows about the strengths they gave her. \\n Tomorrow she plans on destroying everything. \\n She plans on starting with her her own creator.
