Something grabs at my boot as I get a hold of a metal bar and pull myself up. I curl up into a ball on the top of the junk wall and look back. I lean against the top of the debris wall of junk and take deep breaths. Anna nudges me, \"That was scary,\" she heaves for air.\n I nod.\n The infected are making their way to the bottom of the wall and crowding around us. They breathe hard, making whistled sounds that will haunt my dreams forever. I am eighty-percent certain, I will be wandering aimlessly with them in a week—once the fever is done burning my brain. I don\u0027t believe everything he said to me. I don’t want to. I\u0027d rather be dead than manufactured. I look down at the green goo and filth covering me. There is no way I have escaped getting the infection, if I can get it.\n I turn my back on them and look at the road ahead. There is a small bridge that lies in ruin and a road that looks like a highway. I\u0027m at the edge of the city. I would sigh relief but I\u0027m more terrified of the things outside of the city.\n The infected we can outrun or kill, but the things outside of the city are strong and armed. I glance back at the city and swallow.\n \"That looks like the place, the doctor was talking about,\" she points to the side with the bridge.\n I nod, \"Yeah, I think it is.\"\n The infected try to climb the wall. Their shrieks and screams are distracting and frightening. I see them differently now, though. Up close I can see it, the faces of what used to be human.\n Anna looks at them and shrugs the gun up higher on her shoulder, as she starts the climb down into the open roads. I follow.\n I still feel the bad feelings from the days before. I still feel my impending doom. I nudge her and mutter, \"I had this bad dream a few times when I was in the room. It was about Leo and he was in a cage. He looked hungry and scared. His ears were twitching like a cat\u0027s. They do that when he gets nervous. He looked at me from the cage and smiled his sloppy-wolf smile. His tail wagged. But I could see a man behind the cage. Leo couldn’t see him. I tried screaming to him. I was jumping up and down and pointing but Leo just smiled at me. The man was wearing one of the space suits and holding a red-hot poker. He stuck it in the cage and Leo\u0027s fur singed. I could hear his howl. It\u0027s still haunting me.\"\n She shudders, \"Creepy. You know he\u0027ll be fine. It\u0027s Leo.\"\n I chuckle, \"He\u0027s survived far worse I suppose.\"\n \"Yeah, God…he was so nice when that horrid kid of Mary\u0027s was always mauling him. Little brat.\"\n I laugh harder and we continue in silence. We know how to move quietly and not be seen.\n The wind whistles and replaces the sounds of the infected. The clean wind is exactly the way I remember it being, fresh and warm. The smell of rot and sewage and stale cooking is gone. I\u0027m grateful for it, but at the same time, I miss the closed-in feeling of the city. Now my eyes dart nervously. Every speck of gravel that is dragged across the ground, sounds like footsteps. It sounds worse than the simple knock at my door. The memories flash in my mind when I let my mind wander. My doubts still think I made the wrong choice. Looking at her, I know I made the right one. I hold my knives and walk, pushing the memories away. She came for me. She is my ‘us’.\n Loving them all, and missing the ones not with us, hurts me in a way I cannot understand. It hurt when my mom died. It hurt when my dad dragged me away from my Granny\u0027s house. It hurt the most, when my dad died. But none of it hurts the way, being away from him does.\n His eyes and the way he watches me—he\u0027s always got my back. I feel tears threaten my eyes. I\u0027ll never needed anything the way I need him. He is the one who was there when I was small and scared. He\u0027s my first family member after the world ended and I was alone.\n The closer we get to the small cluster of buildings in front of us, particularly the one that says U.M.I.N.A., the worse the fears get in my belly. I\u0027m terrified of what we will find.\n I pocket one of the knives and jog up to the first building, Anna slides along the wall with me and looks the other way. I slip along the side of it, away from her and glance around the side. It seems cleaner here. I hear something I haven’t heard in a while. A truck. I freeze and wait for a better idea of where it is. I look back at Anna; she\u0027s listening too. It\u0027s coming towards us. I turn and run for the far side of the building, following Anna. She heard the truck\u0027s direction too. She moves like I do. She is getting better and better at this life. That would make me sad, but we don’t have time for that. I look back the way we came. I don’t see anything.\n We stand there breathing softly and wait. The truck\u0027s engine has a slight squeal. We crouch in a bush and wait. The truck drives by slowly, patrolling. It\u0027s a pickup with two men in the back with huge guns. Guns like I\u0027ve never seen before. They turn to the right and disappear into the tidy area.\n \"The others?\" she whispers.\n I shake my head subtly, \"Worse, military.\"\n I hear her swallow, \"What does that even mean?\"\n I shake my head again, \"I don’t know. Wait here. Cover me and shoot only when you have to.\"\n She gives me a look.\n Sweat is pouring down my face. My nerves and exhaustion, combined with the midday summer sun, are brutal. I creep back to where I was, trying to forget the dry feeling in my mouth, and the ache of starvation in my stomach.\n I glance up to the top of the buildings. I notice movement. I realize it\u0027s just like the camps. I lean against the wall and watch them. I\u0027m never going to get him back. I turn and wave for her to follow me. We run around the building, going in the opposite direction of the guards. I round the corner and fight the feelings of rage and hopelessness that are brewing inside of me. I\u0027m feeling psychotic enough to make my hands shake.\n I take deep breaths and glance up. No movements. Looking down the road, I can\u0027t see anything, just buildings with huge lettering and parking lots like the breeder farms. Things are clean here like the farms too, like nature is kept at bay by something. It isn’t overrun with bushes and trees and vines like in the city.\n I hear voices. Women\u0027s voices. I freeze, Anna stands right next to me. I hear her fingers slide against the gun as her grip tightens. We lean against the building and look out into the road. Two women walk with matching guns and bandanas on their heads.\n \"You think they\u0027re part of the army?\" I whisper.\n \"I don\u0027t know. What should we do? Want me to shoot?\" she asks softly, crouching down.\n I shake my head and whisper, \"Get in the bush and play possum. They have guns and those matching bandanas; they\u0027re guards. This must be their patrol.\"\n I curl into a ball next to the bush I am beside and she follows, doing the same.\n \"Don\u0027t move till I say it\u0027s okay. No matter what,\" I whisper into the warm silence.\n The bushes hide her and the gun. I tuck my hands behind my back, holding my knives. I let my face go slack.\n I lie there and wait. If they\u0027re any good at their job, they’ll find me. If they\u0027re really good they\u0027ll just shoot me dead. It\u0027s what I would do. But after seeing the training on the other guards, I have hope I\u0027ll be alive and well within minutes of them both being dead.\n The voices get louder, \"Oh I know. I heard she was at the farms. It\u0027s sad but we all have to do our part.\" She sounds cold and detached.\n The other lady doesn’t sound the same. She sounds upset, \"She was seventeen. It isn’t right. I don’t give a shit what anyone says, she was too young.\"\n The other lady\u0027s voice grows tense, \"Well, when you are in ear shot of the others you better sing a different tune, Linda.\"\n \"I will.\"\n They\u0027re almost on top of me. I relax my breath and play possum.\n \"Oh my God—look. It\u0027s a girl.\" One of them rushes at me. It\u0027s the distant sounding one. Her hands are warm when they touch my arms.\n \"She might be infected, Luce. Masks.\"\n \"She isn’t infected, no fever. She\u0027s sick; look at her. She\u0027s pale.\"\n I take a breath and open my eyes.\n The cold lady has dark hair and soft brown eyes. She smiles, \"You okay?\"\n I nod and swallow.\n \"You been bit?\"\n I shake my head but I\u0027m covered in brownish-green blood. I look like I\u0027m carrying the infection.\n \"Can you get up?\" she asks. The other lady watches me with sharp, steel-blue eyes and holds her gun on me.\n As I get up, I move my hands fast. I slice the first lady across the throat and grab and spin her. The other woman fires but she shoots her friend in the back. I toss her friend aside and kick her legs out from under her. When she goes down, I stab into her heart hard. I pull the gun away and her bandana. I tie it around my throat the way they have it. I take the one with blue eyes and drag her into the bush. Looking around, I pull her shirt off. I rip mine off and pull on hers. We take their boots and pants too. It\u0027s against my rules, but I need clean clothes and we both need better boots. They aren’t amazing but they\u0027re better than the crap Vincent gave me.\n \"Get up,\" I whisper.\n We rifle through the pockets and find the card that is the door key.\n \"Put the bandana on the way she has it.\"\n We drag them both into the bushes and grab their guns. A truck comes along with men and women in it.\n \"HALT!\" a man shouts, just as we leave the two dead naked women.\n We stop.\n He narrows his eyes, \"You fire a shot?\"\n I shake my head.\n \"You hear a shot?\"\n I turn and point back the way I came, \"No. We just came from there and a truck was driving by. It had a fan belt that was making a squeal. We didn’t hear anything but that.\"\n He looks that way and nods.\n I\u0027m trembling inside. Anna is completely silent.\n \"Eyes and ears open, both of you,\" he points forward. The people in the truck drive on. I\u0027m sucking air, like I\u0027ve held it for a year. I think I\u0027ve peed my pants a little. I look down at the small wet spot and shake my head, \"Damn, new pants too.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-10.html","bookId":1605,"book":{"id":1605,"title":"Born to Fight (Born #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Born to Fight (Born #2) \n When Emma wakes strapped to a cold metal table she has only one name on her lips, \"Marshall!\" What she doesn\u0027t expect is discovering that he is only one of the disturbing people in her small world who deserves to die in a fiery death. \n Twenty years ago scientists made some remarkable discoveries with genetics and the ability to perfect the babies we gave birth to. \n Ten years ago the governments of the world made a hard choice, earth or people. \n Nine weeks ago the choices they made came full circle. \n Fourteen days ago the truth of their mutations leaked out into the borderlands and other areas. \n Yesterday the worst thing they ever made learned about what she was. \n Today she\u0027s coming for them and she knows about the strengths they gave her. \n Tomorrow she plans on destroying everything. \n She plans on starting with her her own creator.
