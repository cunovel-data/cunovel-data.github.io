I look back at the floor and clean.\n \"Emma, I am coming too. You are not leaving me here,\" Anna comes storming into the kitchen.\n I see something in the corner of my eye and am up fast. I grab her arm and hold it out, \"What\u0027s this?\"\n She looks down at the greenish goo and red blood on her arm.\n \"Its their blood? I fought with one in the yard before we made it inside. I\u0027m going to wash it now.\"\n I close my eyes, \"They don’t have red blood, Anna.\"\n I hear Will\u0027s footsteps, \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"She\u0027s got a cut with infected blood all over it,\" I mutter and pull her to the sink.\n Will crosses the floor fast. He grabs her arm and holds it out, \"For fuck\u0027s sake, Anna. What is this?\"\n Her lip trembles but her eyes stay hard and focused, \"I didn…didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"Pour the bleach on it,\" Star nods at the huge jug.\n I look at her and Bernie and wish it were one of them. Bernie nods, \"We can wash the cut with bleach but wiping the infected blood might force it into the wound.\"\n My hands tremble when I hold her arm out. Will\u0027s tremble equally as he lifts the huge jug. Anna\u0027s eyes glisten, \"If I get sick, you kill me, okay? I don’t want to wander around killing things.\"\n I shake my head, \"We\u0027ll find a cure.\"\n Will looks like he might just tear the arm off. He barks at me, \"Hold it over the sink!\"\n I drag her arm over the metal sink. He looks at her, \"This is gonna sting.\"\n She bites down hard and nods. He pours it and she starts screaming.\n I feel my own body reacting, like it\u0027s happening to me too. I\u0027m clenched and scared and shaking with her arm. I hold it out as he wipes with a clean rag. The green goo is gone, and in its place, is a whitened, deep gash. The edges of it start to look like cooked chicken. She writhes in agony.\n He pours once more and wipes again. I turn on the tap and pour cold water over the wound. Bernie passes me soap. I wash my hands first and then the bleached wound. It feels toughened and hard. We\u0027ve scarred her arm brutally.\n Tears stream down her cheeks, as she sniffles and sucks in her air in jagged breaths. Will washes his hands and wraps his arms around her.\n \"Emma, come clean her in the shower now!\" he barks again.\n I follow.\n Jake follows too. He looks sick. I imagine we all look the same.\n Will leaves her in the bathroom with me and a plastic bag, \"All clothes in the bag.\"\n I rip mine off first and then hers. I start the shower and drag her in. She is still crying and holding her arm.\n \"I\u0027m gonna get sick and die, Em,\" she whispers though the tears. I haven\u0027t seen her like this since the front door of my cabin.\n I make lather with the soap and clean my whole body. The lye soap stings against my skin. I rinse and make the lather. I scrub her body like I would Leo. I don’t think about the fact, I\u0027m touching another person. I think about saving my family.\n I wash her hair and pick the tangles with the conditioner. It’s the same stuff as at the breeder farms. It\u0027s disturbing how much I like the familiar smell.\n We stand under the water in silence. She glances up at me and shakes her head, \"You don’t let me infect them. You kill me. You swear to me now.\"\n I nod, \"I swear.\" The sick part is, I do. I would kill her if I had to. I would kill anyone, except Leo. I know I couldn’t ever kill him.\n Chapter eleven\n The dusty road we take isn’t like the one we came in on. It’s a back road with no broken down cars or burned-out vehicles, that have become giant planters.\n \"The city is not like anything you\u0027ve seen before. People live without engaging each other too much. They don’t really speak to one another on a deep level, it\u0027s fake and functional. They\u0027re pleasant, overly pleasant. Everyone is afraid of everyone else, like they will be turned in to the officials. If you break one of the five laws, you are either sent to a work farm or sent to the borderlands.\n I frown, \"What\u0027s wrong with the borderlands?\"\n He looks at me in the rearview, \"I will bet living in the borderlands was hard, even for you, in the beginning?\"\n I nod, \"I was ten. Don’t get me wrong, your shower is amazing and having food so easy is too. But wasn’t that, all the stuff that brought us down in the first place? Why aren’t we trying to rebuild and be simple? They should be grateful to go to the borderlands and discover the true meaning of rebuilding the world.\"\n He shrugs, \"Well, imagine it\u0027s the beginning for you all over again. These people have lived a cushy life for a while. Most of them never leave the cities, except to work in the breeder farms. They believe that they\u0027re trying to make a difference. They believe that the only way to save humanity, is to breed out the sickness and disease, by breeding people of superior quality. They believe they are the best of the best quality people. Most of them see the sickness of greed, disease, and war mongering as the evils that existed.\"\n I cock an eyebrow, \"Why don’t they breed themselves and just stay in their perfect city then, and leave the rest of us alone?\"\n He nods, \"Oh they will. They are starting to rebuild society. There is controlled breeding within marriages now.\"\n I shake my head, \"I don’t understand why they still keep the breeder farms open then?\"\n His eyes dull, \"He\u0027s obsessed with perfect people. He wants to build an army of perfect people to protect the future from ever becoming the decayed society, we once were. People like you and Star who don’t need a lot to live, who never get sick and need treatments. Me, Jake, Anna, and Will will probably get cancer one day from the fallout. Most people will. The soil, water and air were all polluted. We will get cancer. It\u0027s inevitable. We\u0027ve all made the mistake of eating things people find or grow and drinking water from contaminated wells. The borderlands are worse than anywhere else. There isn’t a lot of healthy food. The retreats and camps are better than the towns. The towns are really bad.\"\n I nod, \"You sound like my dad.\"\n He raises his eyebrows, \"He probably knew a lot about the conspiracies. I guarantee he knew about you and what his brother did. It\u0027s all very disturbing. It probably tainted your dad, made him crazy and obsessed. I know I have moments. Some things disturb me. You know why the breeders are killed off? ‘Cause they get sick after three breeder babies. They can only ever have three at a max. The babies are designed to take everything from the mother, like a parasite in a host. It makes a very healthy baby but leaves the mom weak. By the third pregnancy, those women are dying, they just don’t know it.\"\n I look up at Will. He bites his lip and looks away from me.\n \"If we stop the breeder farms and destroy the work camps, what are the odds people will just go back to normal?\" I ask after a minute.\n He shakes his dark head, \"I don’t know, Emma. There are a lot of believers. They did have a tough time in the very beginning. They did live a rough life in the start.\"\n \"What about the people who don’t believe?\"\n Will turns and looks at me, \"We lived amongst them at the camps. Those are the non-believers. They don’t believe in the breeder farms or the work camps. Most of the scientists I encountered, hated it. They saw the unnatural selection it all was.\"\n I don’t get it. I process it and shake my head, \"No. The people in the camps didn’t even know how the breeder farms worked, until we discovered the girls were dying.\"\n Will sighs, \"Yeah, but they knew the breeders existed and disagreed. I\u0027m sure Marshall knew all along, you can\u0027t tell me, he didn’t.\"\n I make a face, \"The cities must know how it all works. They work the farms.\"\n Bernie nods, \"Most people know how the work camps and farms function. They probably would disagree if it was their family members, but it\u0027s dirty borderlanders. They believe— they believe it\u0027s for the greater good.\"\n I cross my arms and lean against Leo. He pants and watches me get further annoyed. I twitch my foot. I still haven’t worked out how Leo can come with me. He refused to stay with Anna, even after I shouted at him. He isn’t even holding a grudge, which normally he would. He hates being shouted at.\n I nuzzle my face into his fur and take in deep breaths. He smells like the forest still, somehow. If I close my eyes, I can feel the trees against me.\n Will grabs my arm, \"You have to be civilized.\"\n I scowl, \"I can do that just fine.\"\n He gives me a look that makes my cheeks blush, \"Em.\"\n I chew my lip and then sigh, \"I think I can. I remember when I was a girl and Granny would swat me for saying rude things and being mean. She was always swatting after me. When her friends were there, I was to be seen and not heard. I was to cross my legs nicely and not chew with my mouth open.\" My brain almost hurts trying to remember the many rules she gave me. \"Uhm, she said I had to keep my elbows off the table, not bring animals in the house, always flush when I was done, and always wash my hands.\" I tap my fingers against my legs and point at him as a smile breaks across my lips, \"Not to interrupt people when they were talking, with stupid thoughts that could have waited till they were done.\"\n He looks at Bernie and both of them burst into laughter.\n I scowl, \"What?\"\n Will shakes his head, \"You were just a little savage weren’t you, even before the world ended.\"\n I cross my arms and lean back into Leo, \"No. I watched Days of Our Lives with Granny and read her books. She liked Dean something and Stephen something and V.C. something. Her favorite was a highlander romance series about a guy named Jamie and a lady named Claire. It was sad.\" My cheeks heat up as I recall the details of that book. They have stayed with me forever. \"Diana Gabaldon. I won\u0027t ever forget her name.\" I can\u0027t help but wish Will was more like the Jamie guy. He was perfect. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-25.html","bookId":1605,"book":{"id":1605,"title":"Born to Fight (Born #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Born to Fight (Born #2) \n When Emma wakes strapped to a cold metal table she has only one name on her lips, \"Marshall!\" What she doesn\u0027t expect is discovering that he is only one of the disturbing people in her small world who deserves to die in a fiery death. \n Twenty years ago scientists made some remarkable discoveries with genetics and the ability to perfect the babies we gave birth to. \n Ten years ago the governments of the world made a hard choice, earth or people. \n Nine weeks ago the choices they made came full circle. \n Fourteen days ago the truth of their mutations leaked out into the borderlands and other areas. \n Yesterday the worst thing they ever made learned about what she was. \n Today she\u0027s coming for them and she knows about the strengths they gave her. \n Tomorrow she plans on destroying everything. \n She plans on starting with her her own creator.
