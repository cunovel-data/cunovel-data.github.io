I turn to see Jake in the doorway.\\n\\n \"Hey.\"\\n\\n He runs a hand through his dark hair, \"You okay?\"\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n He leans on the door and points back at the door across from us, \"I\u0027m going to take the room across the hall. He said we have to shower one at a time, water pressure or something.\" I see the smirk I love cross his lips slowly, \"Unless you wanna just shower with me?\" he tries to be serious.\\n\\n I bite my lip and shake my head.\\n\\n He frowns but the grin is still making attempts, \"No? Okay. Just thought, maybe, it would be faster if we showered together.\"\\n\\n The sound of the water pouring and Anna humming, feels like it\u0027s taking over the room, or the space is shrinking with him in it. I step back but he steps forward. My heart rate picks up and he makes me feel the thing that Will always makes me feel. I shake my head again, \"No.\"\\n\\n His blue eyes search for something. He steps back nodding, \"Okay. Wow. I feel like an idiot. I thought you were smarter than this. You want him because he\u0027s strong and smart in the forest? Really?\" His eyes aren’t friendly and sweet. They turn and I can see the hurt on his face. \"I would never hurt you the way he has.\"\\n\\n I swallow hard, \"It isn\u0027t that. I just want to be your friend, Jake…yours and his. I need to focus my energy on killing my other dad and ending the things he does. I don’t want to have to choose who I want to be with. I can\u0027t be with anyone. I have to stop my dad. I have to free the other girls.\"\\n\\n The anger stays in his bright-blue eyes, \"For a girl who walked away from everyone and never cared about anything, you sure got some serious causes now, don’t you?\"\\n\\n I don’t have any real excuse for why I am so determined now. I nod, \"I\u0027m related to the monster who started it. I know the truth of it all. I feel like it\u0027s a heavy weight on my shoulders, and the only way to get rid of it, is to kill him and end it all.\"\\n\\n He turns and walks from the doorway.\\n\\n I look down at the hardwood floors and try to push away the bad feelings inside of me. I hate the way I feel, like I have to choose one of them. I hear footsteps and close the door quickly. I turn and press my back into it.\\n\\n Anna comes out with wet hair and a huge towel wrapped around her. She points, \"That was amazing.\"\\n\\n I push off the door and walk to the bathroom, \"Good. I need it.\" I close the bathroom door and pull my clothes off. They stick to me from getting dressed when I was wet still. I leave them on the floor next to hers. They look like a pile of dirt on the clean bright floor. The shower is a walk-in kind. I turn the knob and step in. The heat from the shower is instantly relaxing. I take misty breaths of the steamy air in. I shampoo twice, scrubbing my head free of the debris and dirt. It feels like the dirt coming off of me has been there since the breeder farms. I haven’t felt clean since. Not real clean, like I used to before I opened the door to the cabin and let them in my life.\\n\\n I finish and leave the bathroom in a towel. I\u0027m not ready to put my dirty things back on.\\n\\n Star is standing in the room holding a stack of clothes. She smiles, \"I brought y\u0027all some of my things.\"\\n\\n \"Short shorts and tank tops?\" I ask.\\n\\n She flinches, \"No.\" She places them on the dresser and turns.\\n\\n \"She didn’t mean that,\" Anna says quickly and shoots me a dirty look.\\n\\n I nod, \"I\u0027m sorry. I don’t know why I said that.\" I\u0027m not sorry and I do know why. What I don’t know, is why she makes me so angry. Why I hate her. It\u0027s unnatural the amount of anger I have inside of me when she\u0027s around.\\n\\n She gives me a look, \"He\u0027s never picked me, you know. Since he met you, it\u0027s been you. Before you, it was no one. He never cares about anyone like that. He helps everyone but he doesn’t let anyone in.\" She opens the door and leaves and I feel awful. I try to make it go away but it won\u0027t. It eats at me. It\u0027s a horrid feeling.\\n\\n Anna laughs when she sees my face, \"Oh you feel like shit now, don’t you?\" She grabs some of the clothes and pulls them on. I sit on the bed and try to just let the bad feelings eat me up, like they\u0027re trying to.\\n\\n \"What is this?\" I hold my stomach.\\n\\n \"Guilt. You feel guilty for hurting her, for no reason. You acted like a jerk and now you have to suffer through it until she forgives you, or you can go back to not giving a shit.\" She straightens the t-shirt and looks at me, \"I feel amazing. That was incredible.\"\\n\\n I look up at her and smile weakly, \"Hot showers have to be the thing I miss the most about the real world.\\n\\n The door flings open. I stand to see Star walking back in. She looks savage. Her hand comes back, I see it too late. The sting of her hand across my face burns instantly. She shouts, \"That’s for saying I dress like I want to be raped and always being hateful to me! I never did a thing to you!\"\\n\\n She turns and storms out of the room again. When the shock wears off, I smile at Anna, \"That feels better in my stomach.\" I rub my cheek and glance at Leo, sleeping on the bed. His one open yellow eye closes.\\n\\n Anna laughs, \"Even Leo thought you had that one coming.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"I did. At least she hits like a girl.\"\\n\\n I pull on the clothes and walk out of the room after Anna. Star is leaned against the wall at the top of the stairs. She shakes her sobbing head, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I frown, \"I deserved that. I had no right to say that about you. I have no right to judge you.\" Anna gives me a look I don’t understand, but she isn’t happy. She mouths, \"SORRY!\"\\n\\n I stammer, \"I-I\u0027m s-s-sorry.\"\\n\\n Star sniffles, \"I just didn’t understand why you hated me from the start.\"\\n\\n I frown and look for answers, there are none. I hate that Will kissed me and then kissed her. I shake my head, \"I just never was around other people.\"\\n\\n Anna points laughing, \"This is her—way more social. See how she doesn’t really move her lips much, she never cries, and she is always kind of hard-ass? This is nothing. You should have seen how bitchy she was, when I met her. We\u0027ve slowly been fixing her.\"\\n\\n My jaw drops. Anna winks when Star smiles. I don’t know what just happened, but I don’t like it. I turn back to the room and grab my bow and quiver. Leo gives me a look. I nod. He climbs off the bed and follows me out of the room. Anna eyes me up, \"You know it was a joke right?\"\\n\\n I nod, \"I\u0027m hungry.\" I\u0027m starved actually. We haven’t eaten much and I need something.\\n\\n Star laughs, \"He has tons of food downstairs.\"\\n\\n My gaze narrows, \"How?\"\\n\\n She shrugs, \"He is a smart guy. He knew this was coming. He was preparing for years before hand. He stays in the city for work and brings food.\"\\n\\n I cross my arms, gripping my weapons, \"He\u0027s your brother?\"\\n\\n She nods, \"Stepbrother. My mom married his rich dad when I was little. They died almost right away, and me and Bernie came here.\"\\n\\n I tilt my head, \"How did you get caught?\"\\n\\n She shrugs and I see her sparkly eyes turn flat and dead inside, \"I was stupid. I didn’t want to listen to Bernie. I went out of the yard. He told me to stay here while he was going to the city. He didn’t want me to come because I was at breeder age. He didn’t think he would be able to protect me.\"\\n\\n \"How old were you?\" I can\u0027t stop myself.\\n\\n \"Fifteen, almost sixteen. They made a few of us stay behind when they got to the farm.\" She shudders, \"Then Will came. He was with Marshall. Will just kept hitting and hitting. They were dead but he couldn’t stop. I can still hear the sound of it.\"\\n\\n We all shudder together. She stares for a minute, I know she\u0027s reliving it. She shakes her head, \"Then they brought me to the camps. I showed Will the way back to here. Him and Bernie became friends. I went back to the camp with him. I couldn’t stay here and do nothing. So I help the wounded, give massages and try to be of help.\"\\n\\n I feel sick again.\\n\\n Her eyes sparkle again but it\u0027s the tears in them that makes them shine, \"When Marshall betrayed you I decided I was done. They don’t want to fix things. Marshall wants to make it look like he\u0027s putting in an effort, but it\u0027s so that the camps will still run. He wants people motivated to work and gather and stay together but it\u0027s an act. He just doesn’t want to do any of that shit alone. He may not have agreed to the breeder farms or the military, but he would be in that city, if it weren’t for the fact he\u0027s diabetic.\"\\n\\n Anna frowns, \"He is?\"\\n\\n She nods, \"Yup. The only reason he\u0027s out in the woods like that is the diabetes. The city has a no-sickness law. I still think he traded you for a free pass. He knew what you were.\"\\n\\n I swallow the bad feelings associated with those words, \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n She winks, \"He was fond of my massages. He told me when you came back from the breeder farms, that he figured you were one of the early seed-gen babies from the breeder farms. One of the ones they experimented on early. He said you were dangerous like those kids in the cities—unruly and unpredictable. I could see it.\"\\n\\n I flinched.\\n\\n She shrugged and wiped her face, \"He said that he could tell right away. Then you got ambushed and he admitted to being responsible. He said he was protecting the camps, but I think he did it to get a free pass to the city. Rebuilding a city has been his main focus for a few years.\"\\n\\n Leo whines and yawns. I look at the bow, \"I have to get him something to eat.\" I walk past them both with Leo on my heels. We walk down the stairs and out the front door.\\n\\n I hate that I\u0027m a seed gen and that I\u0027m different. I stalk across the concrete to the gravel and sigh, \"Stupid gravel.\" We crunch along to the far side of the yard. It\u0027s huge and surrounded by a wall of massive trees. Leo crouches and runs into the woods. He disappears. I follow along and wait for my eyes to adjust. I pull an arrow and lean against a tree.\\n\\n \"I wouldn’t go in there, Emma.\" I sigh again when I hear Will\u0027s voice calling me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-21.html","bookId":1605,"book":{"id":1605,"title":"Born to Fight (Born #2)","description":"Storyline: Born to Fight (Born #2) \\n When Emma wakes strapped to a cold metal table she has only one name on her lips, \"Marshall!\" What she doesn\u0027t expect is discovering that he is only one of the disturbing people in her small world who deserves to die in a fiery death. \\n Twenty years ago scientists made some remarkable discoveries with genetics and the ability to perfect the babies we gave birth to. \\n Ten years ago the governments of the world made a hard choice, earth or people. \\n Nine weeks ago the choices they made came full circle. \\n Fourteen days ago the truth of their mutations leaked out into the borderlands and other areas. \\n Yesterday the worst thing they ever made learned about what she was. \\n Today she\u0027s coming for them and she knows about the strengths they gave her. \\n Tomorrow she plans on destroying everything. \\n She plans on starting with her her own creator.
