I bite my bottom one to try to stop the spread.\\n\\n \"Man, your pasty face even got a bit of color there for a second,\" she laughs but seems uneasy still.\\n\\n I look at her, \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n She shakes her head, \"No, but I will be. Some of that shit scared me, bad. Being lost in the city was too much to take. But we got Will, me, Jake, you and Leo. We just need Sarah and Megs and I\u0027ll be okay. I need some downtime maybe.\"\\n\\n We think the same. I like that.\\n\\n Her eyes dart around. I kick her this time. It takes more effort than I\u0027m prepared for. \"What?\" I ask and drag my leg back into the bed.\\n\\n She sighs and picks her teeth with her tongue, \"Will put Marshall in something the doc called a coma.\"\\n\\n I close my eyes instantly and absorb it, \"He what?\"\\n\\n \"He beat him to near death. The only reason he\u0027s alive at all, is Jake. Jake ripped Will off and stopped him from killing him,\" she sounds annoyed.\\n\\n I open my eyes, climb off the bed, and stalk from the tent in my baggy t-shirt and underwear.\\n\\n \"Emma, you\u0027re awake.\" I see a lady I barely recall. I walk past her, scanning the grounds for the tall lug.\\n\\n The wrong one comes bounding over, \"Em, what\u0027s wrong? You should be in bed.\"\\n\\n I walk past him, \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n He chuckles, \"You gotta calm down. The doc says you\u0027re pretty sick.\" He grabs my arm.\\n\\n I tug it away, \"Jake, where is he?\"\\n\\n He sighs, but doesn’t have to say anything.\\n\\n \"You should be in bed,\" a voice says from behind me.\\n\\n I spin and almost lose my balance. I would sit but I\u0027m too damned angry.\\n\\n His eyes steel when he looks at me, \"Bed.\"\\n\\n I cross my arms, \"You can\u0027t tell me what to do. I\u0027m fine. What the hell did you do to Marshall?\"\\n\\n He crosses his thick arms back at me, \"I did what I had to.\"\\n\\n I don’t know what to say to that. \"I needed answers from him.\"\\n\\n He shrugs, \"He needed to pay for he did to you.\"\\n\\n I scowl, \"He betrayed me ‘cause he thought…stuff. I needed to know how he knew…stuff.\" I can feel heat creeping up my face.\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"You need to get back to bed.\" He takes a step but Leo is there instantly. He stands in between us.\\n\\n I grab his fur and use him to keep myself steady, \"You can\u0027t tell me what to do. You don’t need to defend my honor. I coulda taken Marshall. I wanted answers.\"\\n\\n He takes another step but Leo growls. Will stops, giving me a look.\\n\\n I grin hard, \"What are you going to do? Leo will eat you before you get another step in.\"\\n\\n He snarls at me, just as Leo snarls at him. I point, \"This is an impasse.\" I read about it in one of Granny\u0027s books. There was a princess with a dragon and she fought with two swords. She was badass.\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"We aren’t done talking, but you need bed. Go.\"\\n\\n I feel like I\u0027m about to lose the chicken and the juice so I turn to Jake, \"Help me back to bed?\" I say quietly. The crowd has gathered.\\n\\n He beams and winks at Will. Leo growls and fakes at Will who jumps back a bit.\\n\\n Jake laughs, \"C\u0027mon Leo.\"\\n\\n Leo watches Will for a second longer and then walks to us. He rubs against Jake, making me laugh.\\n\\n Jake helps me back, but doesn’t let me off the hook, \"You acted like an idiot. You need to stay in bed.\"\\n\\n I feel my brow pinch together. I don’t like it when he\u0027s mad at me. Leo and him give me the same look and usually it involves some degree of doubt or sarcasm.\\n\\n Anna is still in the chair, chewing and drinking.\\n\\n I lie back down and curl into the blanket, \"We need to go check on Meg and Sarah.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe in a week or so,\" Jake says and crosses his arms. The twinkle in his eyes is still there. I sigh in relief. It\u0027s the thing I wanted the most in the world, to see that twinkle. I swear it\u0027s food for my heart. He makes me believe that things could be okay again, maybe. It\u0027s saved me, when I was sure I had no heart. I never had a reason to hope before, not even before we ruined the whole world.\\n\\n Leo whines and nudges me with his cold nose, \"You okay, boy?\" I ask, watching his eyes. They still seem like they\u0027re full of fire and life. He pants, making me smile as I run my fingers through his fur. The thickness seems lessened than before we got taken. I can\u0027t imagine how it was for him.\\n\\n \"Did you check him for any wounds?\"\\n\\n Anna swallows chicken and nods, \"Yeah. We had doc look at him. He got feisty about it, but Jake did the whole stand up really tall and crossed his arms like Will. Then Doc just looked him over, said he seemed fine.\"\\n\\n I shake my head at her, \"You\u0027re eating like Meg. What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\\n\\n She laughs, \"I was starved for weeks.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes and look at Jake, \"How did you guys lose her?\"\\n\\n His cheeks blush and I realize, it was him. He runs a hand through his hair and smiles, \"It was a misunderstanding. I thought Will was going back to see if she was okay, but I guess it was supposed to be me.\"\\n\\n I shake my head and hold my hand out for the juice. She passes it to me, \"Did they check me for infection? Did they check you?\" I ask Anna and keep my eyes off Jake.\\n\\n She nods slowly, \"You\u0027ve asked this too many times. You really are immune. Stop asking me about the friggin’ infection. I\u0027m fine. No infection in this body.\"\\n\\n I swallow and shake my head, \"Yeah…well…you don\u0027t know when it could happen to any of us.\"\\n\\n She picks her teeth, making me frown, \"Stop it.\"\\n\\n She kicks at me, \"Shush. I\u0027ve been living amongst the undead and pretending to be a nurse and killing shit. I\u0027m allowed to have a few moments of acting like a savage.\"\\n\\n Jake shoves her, \"Yeah, moments. Keep telling yourself that.\"\\n\\n She snarls at him.\\n\\n \"Where is the golden Jake dog?\" I ask looking around.\\n\\n Jake looks confused and Anna\u0027s almost choking, she\u0027s laughing so hard. She hits her own chest a couple times and moans, \"He found that circle of old ladies and befriended them. He\u0027s ditched us.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes, \"Sounds about right.\"\\n\\n I look at the huge beast next to me and grin, \"You stayed, right boy? No ditching us for old ladies like the Jake dog.\"\\n\\n Jake frowns, \"What Jake dog? What does that even mean?\"\\n\\n Anna snickers, \"It\u0027s so true. He was clumsy and happy like you. Dang dog.\"\\n\\n Leo is making the purring sound as I run my fingers through his fur. It\u0027s making me sleepy doing it. I move over on the single cot. He assesses the situation and climbs up gingerly, not trusting a bed off the ground. He tries to spin and get comfortable, but instead ends up giving me a sideways look. We all laugh. He lies at my feet, covering them and the entire lower half of the bed, but keeps his butt to me.\\n\\n The smile almost hurts my sore, exhausted face.\\n\\n Jake is laughing still, \"Guess you know how he feels about you lately.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"I don\u0027t blame him. I would have been so angry if he got me shot and caged.\"\\n\\n Anna smiles, \"I think he\u0027s mad cause he wants the hunt. He\u0027s been coming with me but he seems weird. You know what he\u0027s like with you; he doesn’t do the same things with me and Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Jakey, we need to have some help over here to lift a few barrels,\" Will lifts back the tent flap. I cringe when I hear the name Jakey. I hate that damned name.\\n\\n He doesn’t make eye contact with me, but Leo lifting his head might have something to do with it.\\n\\n Jake leaves with him, \"Be back in a bit.\"\\n\\n I look at Anna, \"What is the deal with the Jakey?\"\\n\\n She rolls her eyes, \"It was what our mom called him. Every morning it was \u0027wakey wakey, Jakey the snakey\u0027 and Will used to get so excited when it was his turn to say it. Jake was always a sleeper. Even when he was a baby, he was lazy as hell.\" She shrugs, \"Will always just called him that. He was pretty little when Jake was born. They were old and trouble by the time I was born. I was princess Anna.\"\\n\\n A snort escapes from me, before I can stop laughing at her.\\n\\n She glares, \"I used to like nice stuff. I was so little and all those Disney princesses and shows were my favorite.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"I see.\" I don’t. I can\u0027t see her like that.\\n\\n She passes Leo the bone of the leg, that she has eaten to nearly clean, and takes the jug of juice from me. Leo nibbles at the meat carefully. I reach for the bone but he growls.\\n\\n \"LEO!\" I snap. He cowers. I stroke his head and turn his face. He sees my angry eyes and lowers his head in shame. I look at Anna, \"Cooked bones are bad for him. He could get hurt.\"\\n\\n She shakes her head, \"I have never heard him growl at you.\"\\n\\n I stroke him and slip the bone from his ashamed face. I pass it back to her, \"Leave with it quickly.\" I say calmly, \"Bring him a raw one.\" She gets up slowly and leaves the tent. I stroke him softly, \"What did they do to you, baby?\"\\n\\n He turns and faces me. His soft Leo face is back, but he still seems funny, ‘off’ maybe. She\u0027s back and tosses it on the ground of the tent. He gives me a look. I nod once. He humbly picks it up and crawls under my bed. I can feel him under me, like the Princess and the Pea, but with a wolf.\\n\\n \"He seems weird.\" She sits and tucks her feet up.\\n\\n \"He might be worried about me, he might be upset about Marshall being here, or he might be slightly traumatized from the captivity. Could be anything,\" I mutter and try to ignore the lump under my back.\\n\\n \"Want me to stay again?\" she asks.\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n She gets comfy in the chair and closes her eyes.\\n\\n I close mine and feel safe with her there. \"I need a new bow,\" I say when my body starts to relax.\\n\\n \"I got your old one. I found it in the basement when the building never blew.\"\\n\\n I open one eye. She smiles at me, \"I knew I would be seeing you again, so I saved it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-14.html","bookId":1605,"book":{"id":1605,"title":"Born to Fight (Born #2)","description":"Storyline: Born to Fight (Born #2) \\n When Emma wakes strapped to a cold metal table she has only one name on her lips, \"Marshall!\" What she doesn\u0027t expect is discovering that he is only one of the disturbing people in her small world who deserves to die in a fiery death. \\n Twenty years ago scientists made some remarkable discoveries with genetics and the ability to perfect the babies we gave birth to. \\n Ten years ago the governments of the world made a hard choice, earth or people. \\n Nine weeks ago the choices they made came full circle. \\n Fourteen days ago the truth of their mutations leaked out into the borderlands and other areas. \\n Yesterday the worst thing they ever made learned about what she was. \\n Today she\u0027s coming for them and she knows about the strengths they gave her. \\n Tomorrow she plans on destroying everything. \\n She plans on starting with her her own creator.
