The room was immense, beamed and paneled, furnished with impeccable taste--and filled with light. \"We don\u0027t have to worry about \u0027catching\u0027 the morning or afternoon sun,\" Albert told me. \"All rooms get the same amount of light at all times.\" I looked around the room. No fireplace, I thought. The room seemed made for one. \"I could have one if I wished,\" Albert said as though I\u0027d voiced the thought. \"Some people do.\" I had to smile at the ease with which he read my mind. We\u0027d have a fireplace, I thought. Like the pair of fieldstone fireplaces we had in our home. For atmosphere mostly; they provided little heat. But Ann and I liked nothing better than to lie in front of a crackling fire, listening to music. I moved to a superbly crafted table and examined it. \"Did you make this?\" I asked, impressed. \"Oh, no,\" he said. \"Only an expert could create such a beautiful piece.\" Without thinking, I ran a finger over its surface, then tried to hide the movement. Albert laughed. \"You won\u0027t find any dust here,\" he said, \"since there\u0027s no disintegration.\" \"Ann would certainly like that,\" I told him. She always liked our house to be immaculate and California being what it is, she always had to do a lot of dusting to keep the furniture polished. Standing on the table was a vase of flowers--brilliant shades of red, orange, purple and yellow. I\u0027d never seen such flowers. Albert smiled at them. \"They weren\u0027t here before,\" he said. \"Someone left them as a gift.\" \"Won\u0027t they die now that they\u0027ve been picked?\" I asked. \"No, they\u0027ll stay fresh until I lose interest in them,\" Albert said. \"Then they\u0027ll vanish.\" He smiled at my expression. \"For that matter, the entire house would, eventually, vanish if I lost interest in it and left.\" \"Where would it go?\" I asked. \"Into the matrix.\" \"Matrix?\" \"Back to its source to be reused,\" he explained. \"Nothing is lost here, everything recycled.\" \"If mind creates it and loss of interest can un-create it,\" I said, \"does it have any reality of its own?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just that its reality is always subject to mind.\" I was going to ask more but it all seemed too confusing and I let it go as I followed Albert through his house. Every room was large, bright and airy with massive window openings which overlooked the luxuriant scenery. \"I don\u0027t see any other houses,\" I told him. \"They\u0027re out there,\" Albert said. \"It\u0027s just that we have lots of room here.\" I was going to comment on the absence of a kitchen and bathrooms when the reason became obvious. Clearly, the bodies we possessed did not require food. And, since there was neither dirt nor disposal, bathrooms would be superfluous. The room I liked best was Albert\u0027s study. Each wall had a floor-to-ceiling bookcase packed with finely bound volumes and there were large chairs, tables and a sofa on the polished wood floor. To my surprise, I saw a line of bound scripts on one of the shelves and recognized the titles as my own. My reaction came in layers--surprise first, as I\u0027ve said, then pleasure at seeing them in Albert\u0027s home, then disappointment that I\u0027d never had my own scripts bound while I was on earth. My last reaction was one of shame as I realized how many of the scripts dealt with subjects either violent or horrific. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Albert said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to disturb you.\" \"It\u0027s not your fault,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m the one who wrote them.\" \"You\u0027ll have lots of time to write other things now,\" he reassured me. Kindness, I know, kept him from saying \"better\" things. He gestured toward the sofa and I sank down on it as he sat on one of the chairs. Katie sat beside my right leg and I stroked her head as Albert and I continued talking. \"You called this place Harvest,\" I said. \"Why?\" \"Because the seeds a man plants in life create the harvest he reaps here,\" he answered. \"Actually, the most authentic name--if one wants to be a purist--is the third sphere.\" \"Why?\" \"It\u0027s somewhat complicated,\" Albert said. \"Why don\u0027t we wait until you\u0027ve rested first?\" Odd, I thought. How could he know that I was starting to feel weary? I\u0027d only become aware of it that very moment. \"How can that be?\" I asked, knowing he would understand the question. \"You\u0027ve been through a traumatic experience,\" he told me. \"And rest between periods of activity is nature\u0027s way; here as on earth.\" \"You get tired too?\" I asked in surprise. \"Well, perhaps not tired,\" Albert said. \"You\u0027ll soon find that there\u0027s little actual fatigue here. To refresh oneself, however, there are periods of mental rest.\" He gestured toward the sofa. \"Why don\u0027t you lie down?\" he told me. I did and looked up at the beamed ceiling, then, after several moments, at my hands. I made a soft, incredulous sound. \"They look so real,\" I said. \"They are,\" he replied. \"Your body may not have fiber but it isn\u0027t vapor either. It\u0027s simply finer grained than the body you left behind. It still has a heart and lungs to breathe air with and purify your blood. Hair still grows on your head, you still have teeth and finger- and toenails.\" I felt my eyelids getting heavy. \"Do nails stop growing at the right length like the grass?\u0027\u0027 I asked. Albert laughed. \"I\u0027ll have to check that out,\" he said. \"What about my clothes?\" I asked. My eyes closed momentarily, then opened again. \"They\u0027re as real as your body,\" Albert told me. \"Everybody--except certain natives, of course--has, in their mind, the conviction that clothes are indispensable. The conviction garbs them after death.\" I closed my eyes again. \"It\u0027s hard to comprehend it all,\" I said. \"You still think it\u0027s a dream?\" he asked. I opened my eyes and looked at him. \"You know- about that too?\" He smiled. I looked around the room. \"No, I can hardly believe that,\" I said. I looked at him sleepily. \"What would you do if I did though?\" \"There are ways,\" he said. \"Close your eyes while we talk.\" He smiled as I hesitated. \"Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll wake up again. And Katie will stay with you, won\u0027t you Kate?\" I looked at her. She wagged her tail, then lay down with a sigh beside the sofa. Albert rose to put a pillow underneath my head. \"There,\" he said. \"Close your eyes now.\" I did. I actually yawned. \"What ways?\u0027\u0027 I murmured. \"Well--\" I heard him sit back on his chair. \"I might ask you to recall some relative who died, then show the relative to you. I might bring, to your recollection, the details of what happened just before your passing. In an extreme case, I might take you back to earth and show you your environment without you.\" Despite the mounting grogginess I felt, I reopened my eyes to look at him. \"You said I couldn\u0027t go back,\" I said. \"You couldn\u0027t, alone.\" \"Then--\" \"We could only go as observers, Chris,\" he said. \"Which would only plunge you back into that terrible frustration. You couldn\u0027t help your wife, only watch her distress again.\" I sighed unhappily. \"Will she be all right, Albert?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m so worried about her.\" \"I know you are,\" he said, \"but it\u0027s out of your hands now, you can see that. Close your eyes.\" I closed them again and, for an instant, thought I saw her lovely face in front of me: those childlike features, her dark brown eyes. \"When I met her, all I could see were those eyes,\" I thought aloud. \"They seemed enormous to me.\" \"You met her on a beach, didn\u0027t you?\" he asked. \"In Santa Monica, 1949,\" I said. \"I\u0027d come to California from Brooklyn. I was working at Douglas Aircraft from four to midnight. After I finished writing every morning, I went to the beach for an hour or two. \"I can still see the bathing suit she wore that day. It was pale blue, one piece. I watched her but didn\u0027t know how to speak to her; I\u0027d never done that sort of thing before. Finally, I resorted to the age-old \u0027Have you got the time?\u0027 \u0027\u0027 I smiled, remembering her reaction. \"She fooled me by pointing to a building in Santa Monica with a clock on it. So I had to think of something else.\" I stirred restlessly. \"Albert, is there nothing I can do to help her?\" I asked. \"Send her loving thoughts,\" he told me. \"That\u0027s all?\" \"That\u0027s quite a lot, Chris,\" he said. \"Thoughts are very real.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-10.html","bookId":2541,"book":{"id":2541,"title":"What Dreams May Come","description":"Storyline: A LOVE THAT TRANSCENDS HEAVEN AND HELL What happens to us after we die?
