{"id":110574,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I SAT UP on the bed abruptly, laughing. It had only been a dream! I felt alert, all senses magnified. Incredible, I thought, how real a dream can be. But something was wrong with my vision. Everything was blurred as I looked around. I couldn\u0027t see beyond ten feet. The room was familiar; the walls, the stucco ceiling. Fifteen feet by twelve. The drapes were beige with brown and orange stripes. I saw a color television set hung near the ceiling. To my left, a chair--orange-red upholstery like leather, arms of stainless steel. The carpeting was the same orange-red. Now I knew why things looked blurred. The room was filled with smoke. There was no odor though; I found that odd. Not smoke; I suddenly changed my mind. The accident. My eyes were damaged. I was not dismayed. The relief of knowing I was still alive transcended such concern. First things first, I thought. I had to find Ann and tell her I was all right, end her suffering. I dropped my legs across the right side of the mattress and stood. The bedside table was made of metal, painted beige, a top as in our kitchen. Spell. F-o-r-m-i-c-a. I saw an alcove with a sink. The faucets looked like golf-club heads, you know? There was a mirror hung above the sink. My vision was so blurred I couldn\u0027t see my reflection. I started moving closer to the sink, then had to stop. A nurse was coming in. She walked directly toward me and I stepped aside. She didn\u0027t even look at me but gasped and hurried toward the bed. I turned. A man was lying on it, slack-jawed, skin a pasty gray. He was heavily bandaged, an array of plastic tubes attached to him. I turned back in surprise as the nurse ran from the room. I couldn\u0027t hear what she was shouting. I moved in closer on the man and saw that he was probably dead. How come someone else was in my bed though? What kind of hospital would put two patients in the same bed? Strange. I leaned in close to look at him. His face was just like mine. I shook my head. That was impossible. I looked down at his left hand. He wore a wedding band exactly like the one I wore. How could that be? I began to feel an aching coldness in my stomach. I tried to draw the sheet back from his body but I couldn\u0027t. Somehow, I had lost the sense of touch. I kept on trying until I saw my fingers going through the sheet, then pulled my hand back, sickened. No, it isn\u0027t me, I told myself. How could it be when I was still alive? My body even hurt. Proof positive of life. I whirled as a pair of doctors rushed into the room, stepping back to let them at the body. One of them began to blow his breath into the man\u0027s mouth. The other had a highp-- spell. H-y-p-o-dermic; yes. I watched him shove the needle end into the man\u0027s flesh. Then a nurse came running in, pushing some machine on wheels. One of the doctors pressed the ends of two thick, metal rods against the man\u0027s bare chest and he twitched. Now I knew that there was no relationship between the man and me for I felt nothing. Their efforts were in vain. The man was dead. Too bad, I thought. His family would be grieved. Which made me think of Ann and the children. I had to find and reassure them. Especially Ann; I knew how terrified she was. My poor, sweet Ann. I turned and walked toward the doorway. On my right was a bathroom. Glancing in, I saw a toilet, light switch and a button with a red bulb next to it, the word Emergency printed beneath the bulb. I walked into the hall and recognized it. Yes, of course. The card in my wallet said to take me there in case of accident. The Motion Picture Hospital in Woodland Hills. I stopped and tried to work things out. There\u0027d been an accident, they\u0027d brought me here. Why wasn\u0027t I in bed then? But I had been in bed. The same one the dead man was in. The man who looked like me. There had to be an explanation for all this. I couldn\u0027t find it though. I couldn\u0027t think with clarity. The answer finally came. I wasn\u0027t sure it was correct-- but there was nothing else. I had to accept it; for the moment anyway. I was under anesthetic, they were operating on me. Everything was happening inside my mind. That had to be the answer. Nothing else made sense. Now what? I thought. Despite the distress of what was taking place, I had to smile. If everything was happening in my mind, then, being conscious of it, couldn\u0027t I control it? Right, I thought. I\u0027d do exactly what I chose. And what I chose to do was find my Ann. As I decided that, I saw another doctor running down the hall toward me. Deliberately, I tried to stop him as he hurried past but my outstretched hand passed through his shoulder. Never mind, I told myself. In essence, I was dreaming. Any foolish thing could happen in a dream. I started walking down the hall. I passed a room and saw a green card with white lettering: NO SMOKING-- OXYGEN IN USE. Unusual dream, I thought, I\u0027d never been able to read in dreams; words always ran together when I tried. This was completely legible despite the general blurring which continued. It\u0027s not exactly a dream, of course, I told myself, seeking to explain it. Being under anesthesia isn\u0027t like being asleep. I nodded in agreement with the explanation, kept on walking. Ann would be in the waiting room. I set my mind on reaching her and comforting her. I felt her suffering as though it were my own. I passed the nurses\u0027 station and heard them talking. I made no attempt to speak to them. All of this was in my mind. I had to go along with that; accept the rules. All right, it\u0027s not a dream persay--per s-e--but it was easier to think of it as one. A dream then; under anesthesia. Wait, I thought, stopping. Dream or not, I can\u0027t walk around in my patient\u0027s gown. I glanced down at myself, startled to see the clothes I was wearing when the accident occurred. Where\u0027s the blood? I wondered. I recalled an instant vision of myself unconscious in the wreckage. Blood had been spraying. I felt a sense of eggs--no! Sorry for the impatience. E-x-u-1-t-a-t-i-o-n. Why? Because I\u0027d reasoned something out despite the dullness of my mind. I couldn\u0027t possibly be that man in the bed. He was in a patient\u0027s gown, bandaged, fed by tubes. I was dressed, unbandaged, mobile. Total difference. A man in street clothes was approaching me. I expected him to pass me. Instead, to my surprise, he put his hand on my shoulder and stopped me. I could feel the pressure of each separate finger on my flesh. \"Do you know what\u0027s happened yet?\" he asked. \"Happened?\" \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"You\u0027ve died.\" I looked at him in disgust. \"That\u0027s absurd,\" I said. \"It\u0027s true.\" \"If I were dead, I wouldn\u0027t have a brain,\" I told him, \"I couldn\u0027t talk to you.\" \"It doesn\u0027t work that way,\" he persisted. \"The man in that room is dead, not me.\" I said, \"I\u0027m under anesthesia, being operated on. In essence, I\u0027m dreaming.\" I was pleased by my analysis. \"No, Chris,\" he said. I felt a chill. How did he know my name? I peered at him closely. Did I know him? Was that why he\u0027d appeared in my dream? No; not at all. I felt distaste for him. Anyway, I thought (the idea made me smile despite my irritation) this was my dream and he had no claim to it. \"Go find your own dream,\" I said, gratified by the cleverness of my dismissal. \"If you don\u0027t believe me, Chris,\" he told me, \"look in the waiting room. Your wife and children are there. They haven\u0027t been told yet that you\u0027ve died.\" \"Wait a minute, wait a minute.\" I pointed my finger at him, jabbing at the air. \"You\u0027re the one who told me not to fight it, aren\u0027t you?\" He started to reply but I was so incensed by that I wouldn\u0027t let him speak. \"I\u0027m tired of you and tired of this stupid place,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going home.\" Something pulled me from him instantaneously. It was as though my body was encased in metal with a distant magnet drawing me to itself. I hurtled through the air so fast I couldn\u0027t see or hear a thing. It ended as abruptly as it started. I was standing in fog. I looked around but saw nothing in any direction. I began to walk, moving slowly through the mist. Now and then, I thought I caught a fleeting glimpse of people. When I tried to see them clearly, though, they faded off. I almost called to one, then chose not to. I was master of this dream. I wouldn\u0027t let it dominate me. I attempted to distract myself by making believe I was back in London. Remember how I traveled there in 1957 to write a film? It had been November and I\u0027d walked in fogs like this more than once--\"pea soup\" is a good description. This was even thicker, though; like being underwater. It even felt wet. Finally, through the fog, I saw our house. That sight relieved me in two ways. One, the very look of it. Two, the way I\u0027d gotten there so quickly. That could only happen in a dream. Suddenly, an inspiration came to me. I\u0027ve told you how my body hurt. Even though it was a dream, I still felt pain. Accordingly, I told myself that, since the pain was dream- eng-e-n-dered, it wasn\u0027t necessary that I feel it. Robert, with the thought, the pain was gone. Which caused another sense of pleasure and relief. What more vivid proof could one require that this was dream and not reality? I remembered, then, how I had sat up on the hospital bed, laughing, because it had all been a dream. That\u0027s exactly what it was. Period. I was in the entry hall without transition. Dream, I thought and nodded, satisfied. I looked around, my vision still blurred. Wait, I thought. I\u0027d been able to dispel the pain, why not the vision? Nothing happened. Everything beyond ten feet was still obscured by what appeared to be a pall of smoke. I whirled at the clicking noise of claws across the kitchen floor. Ginger was running into the front hall; you recall, our German Shepherd. She saw me and began her rocking, bouncing run of joy. I spoke her name, delighted by the sight of her. I bent to stroke her head and saw my hand sink deep into her skull. She recoiled with a yelp and scuttled back in terror, bumping hard against the kitchen door jamb, ears pressed tight to her head, hair erected on her back. \"Ginger,\" I said. I fought away a sense of dread. \"Come here.\" She\u0027s acting foolishly, I told myself. I moved after her and saw her slipping frantically on the kitchen floor, trying to run away. \"Ginger!\" I cried. I wanted to be irritated with her but she looked so frightened that I couldn\u0027t be. She ran across the family room and lunged out through the flap of the dog door. I was going to follow her, then decided not to. I would not be victimized by this dream no matter how insane it got. I turned and called Ann\u0027s name. No answer to my call. I looked around the kitchen, seeing that the coffee maker was on, its pair of red bulbs burning. The glass pot on the heater plate was almost empty. I managed a smile. She\u0027s done it again, I thought. In no time, the house would be per--p-e-r-me-at-ed with a reek of burning coffee. I reached out to pull the plug, forgetting. My hand went through the wire and I stiffened, then forced back amusement. You can\u0027t do anything right in dreams, I reminded myself. I searched the house. Our bedroom and the bathroom, lan\u0027s and Marie\u0027s rooms, their connecting bathroom. Richard\u0027s room. I ignored the blurring of my vision. That was unimportant, I decided. What I found myself unable to ignore was an increasing lethargy I felt. Dream or not, my body felt like stone. I went back inside our bedroom and sat on my side of the bed. I felt a twinge of uneasiness because it didn\u0027t shift beneath me; it\u0027s a water bed. Forget it, a dream\u0027s a dream, I told myself. They\u0027re insane, that\u0027s all. I looked at my clock-radio, leaning close to see the hands and numbers. It was six fifty- three. I looked out through the glass door. It wasn\u0027t dark outside. Misty but not dark. Yet how could it be morning if the house was empty? At this time, they should all be in their beds. \"Never mind,\u0027\u0027 I said, struggling to get it all together in my mind. You\u0027re being operated on. You\u0027re dreaming this. Ann and the children are at the hospital waiting for-- A new confusion struck me. Was I really in the hospital? Or had that been part of the dream too? Was I actually asleep on this bed, dreaming everything? Maybe the accident had never occurred. There were so many possibilities, each one affecting the next. If only I could think more clearly. But my mind felt numb. As though I\u0027d been drinking or taken sedation. I lay down on the bed and closed my eyes. It was the only thing to do; I knew that much. Presently, I\u0027d wake up with the truth: a dream in the hospital while under anesthesia or a dream in my bed while asleep. I hoped it was the latter. Because, in that case, I\u0027d wake up to find Ann lying by my side and could tell her what a crazy dream I\u0027d had. Hold her lovely warmth in my arms and kiss her tenderly and laugh as I told her how bizarre it is to dream of dreaming.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-4.html","bookId":2541,"book":{"id":2541,"title":"What Dreams May Come","description":"Storyline: A LOVE THAT TRANSCENDS HEAVEN AND HELL What happens to us after we die?
