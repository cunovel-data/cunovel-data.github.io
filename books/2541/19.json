{"id":110589,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"WE WERE APPROACHING a two-story structure which, like the others, had the texture and translucence of alabaster, which Leona told me was the Hall of Literature.\n We ascended the broad steps and went inside. Like the Office of Records, there were many people inside but almost total silence. Leona escorted me into a large, high- ceilinged room the walls of which were shelved with books. Spaced throughout the room were large, attractive tables, dozens of people sitting at them, reading.\n I realized, abruptly, why it was so quiet, the main source of sound absent since we conversed with our minds. \"We can talk and not disturb anyone,\" I said. \"A perfect library.\"\n She smiled. \"That\u0027s right.\"\n I looked around the room. \"What kind of books are these?\"\n \"The histories of every nation on earth,\" she told me. \"As they were though--nothing suppressed.\"\n \"That must be an eye-opener,\" I said, thinking of the near impossibility, on earth, of trying to establish the literal truth of history.\n \"It is indeed,\" Leona agreed. \"The history books on earth are largely fictional.\"\n We walked around the room and I noticed that, like every object in Summerland, the books, too, emitted a faint yet visible radiation.\n \"Are there books here that were published on earth?\" I asked, remembering my scripts in Albert\u0027s home.\n Leona nodded. \"As well as some that are yet to be published there.\"\n \"How does that work?\"\n \"The contents will be impressed on the brains of living persons.\"\n \"Will they know they didn\u0027t really write the book?\"\n \"That\u0027s a rather complicated question,\" Leona said. \"Generally speaking, however, they don\u0027t know.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to read one of those,\" I said.\n \"They\u0027re not usually available,\" she told me. \"Those who read them might, in some way, mar them, how I\u0027m not exactly sure. I wanted to read a particular book once, though, and was told that, since everything here is mental, my thoughts might alter the contents of the book.\"\n She took me to another room which was devoted to books on psychic science, the occult, metaphysics. Walking among the racks, I felt emanations from them more powerful than those in the history room.\n She stopped at one of the racks and pulled out a volume, handing it to me. Its vibrations were rather unpleasant. \"It\u0027s customary to show first visitors this book or one like it,\" Leona said.\n I turned the book to read the title on its spine: The Fallacy of Afterlife. Despite the uncomfortable sensation the book imparted, I had to smile. \"Ironical to say the least,\" I said. As I returned the book to its shelf, I began to feel a sense of anxiety about Ann again. She didn\u0027t believe in afterlife; I\u0027d heard her say it. Was it possible that she might, literally, refuse to accept the evidence of her senses?\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be concerned about that,\" Leona said. \"She\u0027ll believe in you. The rest will follow.\"\n I won\u0027t describe our full tour of the Hall of Literature; it is not really part of my story. Suffice to say, the building and its contents were unendingly impressive. When I commented on the intimidation of all that knowledge to be studied, Leona reminded me that I had unlimited time in which to study it.\n As we left the building, I turned to her questioningly.\n \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027d be quite ready yet,\" she said.\n \"All right,\" I nodded. Patience, I told myself. A little more time and you\u0027ll know.\n \"Would you like to see one of our art galleries?\" Leona asked.\n \"Fine.\"\n She squeezed my arm. \"It\u0027ll be very soon now.\"\n We exchanged a smile. \"I apologize for being so selfish,\" I said, \"I haven\u0027t asked a single question about you.\"\n \"There\u0027s lots of time for that,\" she replied. \"Your first priority is your wife.\"\n I was about to reply when another surprise occurred. A woman passed us with a strange, drifting kind of movement, looking as though she were in a coma, walking underwater. For several moments, she reminded me of the waxy image of myself I\u0027d seen at the seance and I felt a chill. \"Who is she?\" I asked.\n \"She\u0027s still alive,\" Leona said, \"her spirit self is journeying here in sleep. It happens now and then.\"\n \"She doesn\u0027t know she\u0027s here?\"\n \"No. And probably won\u0027t remember when she wakes.\" I turned to watch the woman move off slowly and mechanically and saw a silver cord attached to the crown of her head, trailing into the air before it faded. \"Why don\u0027t people remember?\" I asked.\n \"Because the memory is in the spirit mind and the physical brain is unable to tap it,\" Leona answered. \"I\u0027ve been told that there are people who astral journey here and are entirely conscious of it both during and after but I\u0027ve never seen one.\"\n I watched the woman moving away and couldn\u0027t help thinking: If Ann could do that. Even if she didn\u0027t know it was happening, I could see her for a short while, maybe even touch her. The thought filled me with a longing so acute that it was almost physical. Remembering her warmth and softness against me, I could actually feel it in my flesh.\n With a pained sound, I turned back to Leona to find her smiling understandingly. I returned the smile with effort. \"I\u0027m not good company, I know,\" I told her.\n \"Of course you are.\" She took my hand. \"Come on, we\u0027ll take a brief look at the gallery, then find out when she\u0027ll be with you again.\"\n The building ahead was circular, its marblelike exterior carved with beautiful designs of flowers and foliage.\n Its interior was massive, containing what seemed to be an endless, curving gallery, the walls of which were hung with great paintings. Groups of people stood appreciating and examining, many of them teachers with their students.\n I recognized a Rembrandt and commented on what a perfect reproduction it was. Leona smiled. \"The one on earth is the reproduction,\" she told me. \"This is the original.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n The painting in front of me was the one Rembrandt had in mind, she explained; as perfect as his genius could envision it. What he did on earth to reproduce that perfect mental image was subject to the limitations of his brain and body and created with materials subject to decay. This was his unmitigated vision--pure and eternal.\n \"You mean all artists on earth are only reproducing paintings already in existence here?\"\n \"In existence because they created them,\" Leona said. \"That\u0027s what I meant when I said that the question regarding whether a person knows that he or she is receiving creative impressions is rather complicated. Rembrandt\u0027s thoughts first created this painting from the matrix, then he reproduced it in physical terms. If we were experts, we\u0027d be able to see how much more perfect this painting is than the one on earth.\"\n Every work of art here is alive. Colors glow with reality. Each painting seems almost--- not a good description but the closest I can come--three-dimensional, possessing all the qualities of relief. From a short distance, they look like real scenes rather than flat representations.\n \"In many ways, I think that the happiest people here are the artists,\" Leona told me. \"Matter here is so subtle yet so readily manipulated. The artist\u0027s creativity can be fulfilled without limitation.\"\n I tried hard to maintain an interest in what she was showing and telling me--and it was fascinating. Still, in spite of all attempt, thoughts of Ann kept creeping back. So much so that, when Leona said, \"I think we can find out now,\" I uttered an uncontrollable sound of relief. \"Can we go there by thought?\" I asked.\n She smiled and took my hand. This time, I didn\u0027t close my eyes and still couldn\u0027t follow it. We were in the gallery; I blinked; and the man from the Office of Records was in front of us.\n \"Your wife is scheduled to cross over at the age of seventy-two,\" he told me.\n Twenty-four years, was my immediate thought. It was such an appallingly long time.\n \"Remember that time is measured differently in Summerland,\" he reminded me. \"What would seem an eternity on earth can pass very quickly here if you\u0027re active.\"\n I thanked him and Leona and I left the Office of Records.\n I continued walking with her. I made conversation. I smiled and even laughed. But something was wrong. I kept thinking: everything is settled now. In twenty-four years we\u0027ll be together again. I\u0027d involve myself in study and activity, prepare a home for us. Exactly what she\u0027d like. On the ocean. With a boat. Everything was settled.\n Why, then, was there no assurance? No certainty of resolution? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-19.html","bookId":2541,"book":{"id":2541,"title":"What Dreams May Come","description":"Storyline: \n A LOVE THAT TRANSCENDS HEAVEN AND HELL \n What happens to us after we die?
