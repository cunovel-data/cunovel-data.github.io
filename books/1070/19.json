WHATEVER may have been the antiquity of the actual elements that formed the prim?val nebula from which the solar system has been evolved, the nebula itself has certainly not been of infinite duration. The question then arises as to what has been the origin of the nebula as such, or rather by what agency the material from which the nebula was formed underwent so radical a transformation from its previous condition as to be changed into that glowing object which we have considered so frequently in this book. We have to explain how, by the operation of natural causes, a dark body can be transformed into a glowing nebula. Let us first estimate what the quantity of energy in that system is. The sun has been pouring forth heat for inimitable ages, and will doubtless continue to pour 349forth heat for millions of years to come. But the destiny which awaits the sun, though it may be protracted, yet cannot be averted. The sun will go on pouring forth its heat and gradually shrinking. The time will come at last when the radius of the sun will have appreciably decreased, and when once it has assumed a density corresponding to a solid state its history as a radiant globe will be approaching its close. A period of insignificant extent, a century or less, will then suffice for that solid globe to cool down so as to be no longer an efficient source of light and heat. We shall assume that when the sun has ultimately become solid and cold, and when it is no longer the life and light of our system, it will have attained a mean density of 21.5, which we have chosen because that is the density of platinum, the heaviest substance known. In all probability the solar density will never become so great as this, but to include the most extreme case in our argument I am making the assumption in the form stated. We are now to estimate what will have been the total energy that the sun has radiated from the moment when as an indefinitely great nebula it first began to radiate at all, down to that moment in the future when, having shrunk to the density of platinum, and having parted with all its heat, the solar radiation is at an end. In the beginning of the evolutionary history the sun was a nebula, which we have supposed to extend in every direction to an indefinitely great distance. The system has resulted from the contraction of that nebula, and the energy liberated in that contraction has supplied the sun’s radiation. We calculate (see Appendix) the energy that would be given out in 350the contraction of a nebula whose materials were originally at infinity, and which ultimately coalesced to form a cold, solid globe of the density of platinum, and as heavy as the sun. There is no object in attempting to express this quantity of energy in foot-pounds—the figures would convey no distinct impression—we shall employ the coal-unit explained in Chapter VI. We imagine a globe of coal the weight of the sun; then, if that globe of coal were adequately supplied with oxygen, it would, on combustion, give out a certain amount of heat, which is a convenient unit for our measurements. It is demonstrated that the quantity of energy given out by the contraction of the nebula from infinity, to this globe of the density of platinum, would be about equal to the quantity of energy which would be produced by the combustion of 8,300 globes of coal as heavy as the sun, an adequate contribution of oxygen being supposed to be supplied. This expresses the original endowment of energy in the solar system, or rather a major limit to that endowment; it shows that the solar system can never have developed more energy by contraction than that which could be produced by the combustion of 8,300 globes of coal as heavy as the sun. We may mention that of this great endowment of energy an amount which is rather less than half (3,400) has been already expended, so that rather more than half of the sun’s career as a radiant globe may yet have to be run. We can also express the total energy of the solar system in a different manner. We shall consider what must be the velocity of the sun, so that the energy that it will possess, in virtue of that velocity, shall be equal to the energy which could be produced by the 351combustion of 8,300 globes of coal of the same weight. This calculation is very much simplified by making use of a principle which we have already stated and applied in Chapter V. We have shown that if a piece of coal be animated with a velocity of five miles a second, the energy it possesses in virtue of that motion is equal to the energy produced by the coal in the act of combustion. If a body were moving at the rate of, let us say, 100 miles a second—its speed being then twenty times as great as the particular speed just mentioned—its energy, which depends on the square of the velocity, would be 400 times as much as would be produced by the burning of a piece of coal equal to it in weight. We can easily calculate that if the sun were moving at a speed of 460 miles a second, it would possess, in virtue of its motion, as much energy as would be generated by the contraction of the prim?val nebula from infinity down to a globe of the density of platinum. It is thus easy to form a supposition as to how the nebula constituting our solar system may have come into being; most probably it originated in this way. Let us suppose that two masses, either dark or bright, either hot or of the temperature of space, or the temperature of frozen air, were moving with speeds of 460 miles a second. No doubt the velocities we are here postulating are very high velocities, but they are not unprecedentedly high. We know of stars which at this present moment move quite as fast, so that there is nothing unreasonable in our supposition so far as the velocities are concerned. Let us suppose that each of these bodies had a mass which is half that of our present solar system. If these two bodies dashed 352into collision, when moving from opposite directions, the effect of the blow would be to transform the energy into heat. That heat would be so great that it would be sufficient not alone to render these globes red-hot and white-hot, but even to fuse them—nay, further, to drive them into vapour, even to a vapour which might expand to an enormously great distance. In other words, it is quite conceivable that a collision of two such masses as we have here supposed might be adequate to the formation of a nebula such as that one which in the lapse of indefinite ages has shaped itself into the solar system. Before the collision, which resulted in the formation of the nebula, each of these bodies, or rather their centres of gravity, would be moving in what may be regarded for the moment as straight lines, and a plane through those two straight lines will be a plane which for ever afterwards will stand in important relation to the system. It will be, in fact, that principal plane of which we have so often spoken. As those two bodies met they would possess a certain moment of momentum, and this moment of momentum would remain for ever unaltered, no matter what may be the future vicissitudes of the system. For the sake of simplicity in describing what has occurred, we have spoken as if the two bodies were of equal mass, and, moving with equal velocities from opposite points of the heavens, dashed into collision. But what actually happens cannot have been quite so symmetrical. There is one feature in the solar system which absolutely proves that the collision cannot have taken place precisely in the way we have laid down. If it had happened that two equal masses had been 353hurled into collision with equal velocities from precisely opposite directions, then there could have been no resultant moment of momentum. From the principle of the conservation of moment of momentum, we can see that, if absent in the beginning, it could never originate later. As, however, we have a large moment of momentum in the movements of the planets and the sun, it is certain that the collision cannot have taken place in a manner quite so simple. Fig. 53.—Cluster with Stars of 17th Magnitude (n.g.c. 6705; in Antinous). (Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S.) The probabilities of the case show that it is almost infinitely unlikely that two bodies of equal dimensions, and moving with equal velocities in opposite directions, should come squarely into collision. It would be much more likely that the bodies should be not of the same size, not moving with the same velocity, and should collide partially rather than squarely. The collision may have been, in fact, little more than a graze. The 354probabilities of the case are such as to show that what actually occurred was a collision between two unequal masses, which were moving in directions inclined to each other and with different velocities. It is easy to show that, granted sufficiently great velocities, an impact which fell far short of direct collision might still produce enough heat to transform the whole solar system into vapour. The circumstances which would naturally accompany so transcendent an incident will also go far to account for a difficulty which has been often felt with regard to the evolution of the system from a nebula. Were such a collision to take place we should certainly not expect that the resulting nebulous mass, the product of a shock of such stupendous violence, would be a homogeneous or symmetrical object. Portions of the colliding body would become more highly heated than others; portions of the bodies would not be so completely transformed into vapour as would other parts. There would thus be differences in the nebula at the different parts of its mass. This non-homogeneity would be connected with the formation and growth of planets in the different parts of the nebula. There is another circumstance connected with the movement of the sun which should here be mentioned. It is well known that the sun has a velocity which carries it on through space at the rate of half a million miles a day. In this movement the whole solar system, of course, participates. This movement of translation of our system must also be a result of the movements of the two original colliding masses. These two masses imparted to the system, which resulted from their union, both the lineal velocity with which it advances 355through space, and also that moment of momentum which is of such vast importance in the theory. A consideration of the probabilities of the case make it quite certain that the celestial bodies we see are as nothing compared with the dark bodies we do not see. The stars we see are moving, and the natural assumption is that the dark objects with which the heavens teem are also in motion. We shall, under these conditions, not feel any insuperable difficulty in the supposition that collisions between different bodies in the heavens may have taken place from time to time. We remember that these bodies are moving in all directions, and at extremely high velocities. We are quite willing to grant the excessive improbability that any two bodies particularly specified should come into collision. Within view of our telescopes we have, however, a hundred millions of stars, and if we multiply that figure even by millions, it will still, we may well suppose, not be too large to express the number of bodies which, though contained within the region of space ranged over by our telescopes, are still totally invisible. In these circumstances, we may admit that occasional collisions are not impossible. Please note the strength which the argument derives from the enormous increase in our estimate of the number of bodies, when we include the dark objects as well as the stars. If we were asked whether it would ever be possible for two bright stars to come into collision, we might well hesitate about the answer. We know, of course, that the stars have proper motions; we know, too, that the stars, in this respect unlike the planets, have no definite directions of movement under the control of a supreme co-ordinating attraction. Some 356stars move to the right, and some to the left, some one way and some another; but even still, notwithstanding their great number, the extent of space is such that the stars keep widely apart, and thus collisions can hardly be expected to take place, unless perhaps in a cluster such as that shown in Fig. 53. We have no reason to think that a collision between two actual bright stars was the origin of the prim?val nebula of our system. But when we reflect that the stars, properly so called, are but the visible members of an enormously greater host of objects, then the possibilities of occasional collision between a pair of these incomparably more abundant dark bodies seems to merit our close attention. We are not by any means claiming that such collisions occur frequently. But what we do say is, that if, as we believe, these bodies are to be reckoned in many millions of millions, then it does sometimes happen that two of them, moving about in space, will approach together sufficiently to give rise to a collision. It was from some such collision that we believe the nebula took its rise from which the solar system originated. We have the best reason for knowing that celestial collisions do sometimes occur. It will be in the recollection of the readers of this chapter that in February, 1901, the astronomical world was startled by the announcement of the outbreak of a new star in Perseus. A photograph of that part of the heavens had been taken a few days before. There were the ordinary stars, such as existed from time immemorial, and such as have been represented on the numerous maps in which the stars are faithfully set down. But, on February 22nd, Dr. Anderson, already famous by 357similar discoveries, noticed that the constellation of Perseus contained a star which he had not seen before. Instantly the astronomical world was apprised by telegraph that a new star had appeared in Perseus, and forthwith most diligent attention was paid to its observation. Photographs then obtained show the stars that had been seen there before, with the addition of the new star that had suddenly come into view. For a few nights after its discovery the object increased in lustre, until it attained a brightness as great as that of Capella or Vega. But in this state it did not long remain. This brilliant object began to wane. Presently it could not be classed as a star of the first magnitude, nor yet of the second, and then it ran down until a little below the third, and even below the fourth. In the subsequent decline of the star there were several curious oscillations. On one night the star might be seen, the next night it would be hardly discerned, while the night after it had again risen considerably. But, notwithstanding such temporary rallies, the brightness, on the whole, declined, until at last the star dwindled to the dimensions of a small point of light, scarcely distinguishable with the naked eye. The decline was apparently not so rapid as the increase, but nevertheless from the first moment of its appearance to the last was not longer than a few weeks. This new star in Perseus established, in one sense, a record. For the star was brighter than any new star which had been noticed since the days of accurate astronomical observations. Not indeed for three centuries had a star of such lustre sprung into existence. But a temporary star, such as this was, has been by 358no means an infrequent occurrence. Many such have been recorded. Those who have been acquainted with astronomical matters for thirty years will recollect four or five such stars. In each of them the general character was somewhat the same. There was a sudden outbreak, and then a gradual decline. The questions have sometimes arisen as to whether the outbreak of such an object is really the temporary exaltation of a star which was previously visible, or whether it ought not to be regarded as the creation of a totally new star. In some cases it does seem possible that a new star may have been partly, at all events, due to a large increase of brightness of some star which had been known before. In the case of Nova Persei, however, we have the best authority that this is not the case. Professor Pickering, the distinguished astronomer of Harvard College Observatory, happened to photograph the region in which Nova Persei appeared a few days before the outbreak took place. He tells us that there is not the least indication on his photograph of the presence of a star in that region. Fig. 54.—Spectrum of Nova Persei (1901). (Photographed with the 40 in. Yerkes Telescope by Mr. Ferdinand Ellerman.) The spectrum of Nova Persei, in an instrument of sufficient power, appeared a truly magnificent object. Like other stellar spectra, it displayed the long line of light marked with the hues of the rainbow, but it was unlike the spectra of ordinary stars in respect of the enormous enhancements of the brightness at various parts of this spectrum. For instance, at one end of the long coloured band a brilliant ruby line glowed with a lustre that would at once attract attention, and demonstrated that the object under view must be something totally different from ordinary stars. This superb feature is one of the lines of hydrogen. The 359presence of that line showed that m the source from which the light came there must have been a remarkable outbreak of incandescent hydrogen gas. At various points along the spectrum there were other beautiful bright lines which, in each case, must have been due to glowing gas. Here we have the evidence of the spectrum telling us in unmistakable language that there were features in this star wholly unlike the features found in any ordinary star. It is impossible to dissociate these 360facts from the history of the star. Much of what we have said with regard to the spectrum of Nova Persei might be repeated with regard to the spectrum of the other temporary stars which, from time to time, have burst forth. In each case the spectrum characteristic of an ordinary star is present, but superadded to it are bright lines which indicate that some great convulsion has taken place, a convulsion by which vast volumes of gas have been rendered incandescent. In Fig. 54 we show the spectrum of Nova Persei on five dates, from February 27th to March 28th, 1901. These photographs were taken by Mr. Ferdinand Ellerman with the great telescope of the Yerkes Observatory. They show in the clearest manner the bright lines indicating the incandescent gases. We have pointed out the high probability that among the millions and millions of bodies in the universe it may now and then happen that a collision takes place. Have we not also explained how the heat generated in virtue of such a collision might be sufficient, and, indeed, much more than sufficient, to raise the masses of the two colliding bodies to a state of vivid incandescence? A collision affords the simplest explanation of the sudden outbreak of the star, and also accounts for the remarkable spectrum which the star exhibits. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2984/82272.html","bookId":1070,"book":{"id":1070,"title":"The Earth\u0027s Beginning","description":"简介： Since these lectures were delivered in the Royal Institution of Great Britain there has been much advance in our knowledge of astronomy.
