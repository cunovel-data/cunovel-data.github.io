{"id":78357,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I woke in the early hours of the following morning convinced that there was someone in the north bedroom with me. I sat up against the pillows, rubbed my eyes, and saw a dark, shouldery shape standing between me and the window.\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 I asked, thinking that it wouldn\u0027t reply in words; it would, instead, thump on the wall. Once for yes, twice for no ¡ª what\u0027s on your mind, Houdini? But the figure standing by the window made no reply at all. I groped up, found the string hanging from the light over the bed, and yanked it. My mouth was turned down in a grimace, my midsection tensed so tight it felt as if bullets would have bounced off.\n \u0027Oh shit,\u0027 I said. \u0027Fuck me til I cry.\u0027\n Dangling from a hanger I\u0027d hooked over the curtain rod was my old suede jacket. I\u0027d parked it there while unpacking and had then forgotten to store it away in the closet. I tried to laugh and couldn\u0027t. At three in the morning it just didn\u0027t seem that funny. I turned off the light and lay back down with my eyes open, waiting for Bunter\u0027s bell to ring or the childish sobbing to start. I was still listening when I fell asleep.\n Seven hours or so later, as I was getting ready to go out to Jo\u0027s studio and see if the plastic owls were in the storage area, where I hadn\u0027t checked the day before, a late-model Ford rolled down my driveway and stopped nose to nose with my Chevy. I had gotten as far as the short path between the house and the studio, but now I came back. The day was hot and breathless, and I was wearing nothing but a pair of cut-off jeans and plastic flip-flops on my feet.\n Jo always claimed that the Cleveland style of dressing divided itself naturally into two subgenres: Full Cleveland and Cleveland Casual. My visitor that Tuesday morning was wearing Cleveland Casual ¡ª you had your Hawaiian shirt with pineapples and monkeys, your tan slacks from Banana Republic, your white loafers. Socks are optional, but white footgear is a necessary part of the Cleveland look, as is at least one piece of gaudy gold jewelry. This fellow was totally okay in the latter department: he had a Rolex on one wrist and a gold-link chain around his neck. The tail of his shirt was out, and there was a suspicious lump at the back. It was either a gun or a beeper and looked too big to be a beeper. I glanced at the car again. Blackwall tires. And on the dashboard, oh look at this, a covered blue bubble. The better to creep up on you unsuspected, Gramma.\n \u0027Michael Noonan?\u0027 He was handsome in a way that would be attractive to certain women ¡ª the kind who cringe when anybody in their immediate vicinity raises his voice, the kind who rarely call the police when things go wrong at home because, on some miserable secret level, they believe they deserve things to go wrong at home. Wrong things that result in black eyes, dislocated elbows, the occasional cigarette burn on the booby. These are women who more often than not call their husbands or lovers daddy, as in \u0027Can I bring you a beer, daddy?\u0027 or \u0027Did you have a hard day at work, daddy?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I\u0027m Michael Noonan. How can I help you?\u0027\n This version of daddy turned, bent, and grabbed something from the litter of paperwork on the passenger side of the front seat. Beneath the dash, a two-way radio squawked once, briefly, and fell silent. He turned back to me with a long, buff-colored folder in one hand. Held it out. \u0027This is yours.\u0027\n When I didn\u0027t take it, he stepped forward and tried to poke it into one of my palms, which would presumably cause me to close my fingers in a kind of reflex. Instead I raised both hands to shoulder-level, as if he had just told me to put em up, Muggsy.\n He looked at me patiently, his face as Irish as the Arlen brothers\u0027 but without the Arlen look of kindness, openness, and curiosity. What was there in place of those things was a species of sour amusement, as if he\u0027d seen all of the world\u0027s pissier behavior, most of it twice. One of his eyebrows had been split open a long time ago, and his cheeks had that reddish windburned look that indicates either ruddy good health or a deep interest in grain-alcohol products. He looked like he could knock you into the gutter and then sit on you to keep you there. I been good, daddy, get off me, don\u0027t be mean.\n \u0027Don\u0027t make this tough. You\u0027re gonna take service of this and we both know it, so don\u0027t make this tough.\u0027\n \u0027Show me some ID first.\u0027\n He sighed, rolled his eyes, then reached into one of his shirt pockets. He brought out a leather folder and flipped it open. There was a badge and a photo ID. My new friend was George Footman, Deputy Sheriff, Castle County. The photo was flat and shadowless, like something an assault victim would see in a mugbook.\n \u0027Okay?\u0027 he asked. I took the buff-backed document when he held it out again. He stood there, broadcasting that sense of curdled amusement as I scanned it. I had been subpoenaed to appear in the Castle Rock office of Elmer Durgin, Attorney-at-Law, at ten o\u0027clock on the morning of July 10, 1998 ¡ª Friday, in other words. Said Elmer Durgin had been appointed guardian ad litem of Kyra Elizabeth Devore, a minor child. He would take a deposition from me concerning any knowledge I might have of Kyra Elizabeth Devore in regard to her well-being. This deposition would be taken on behalf of Castle County Superior Court and Judge Noble Rancourt. A stenographer would be present. I was assured that this was the court\u0027s depo, and nothing to do with either Plaintiff or Defendant.\n Footman said, \u0027It\u0027s my job to remind you of the penalties should you fail ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Thanks, but let\u0027s just assume you told me all about those, okay? I\u0027ll be there.\u0027 I made shooing gestures at his car. I felt deeply disgusted . . . and I felt interfered with. I had never been served with a process before, and I didn\u0027t care for it.\n He went back to his car, started to swing in, then stopped with one hairy arm hung over the top of the open door. His Rolex gleamed in the hazy sunlight.\n \u0027Let me give you a piece of advice,\u0027 he said, and that was enough to tell me anything else I needed to know about the guy. \u0027Don\u0027t fuck with Mr. Devore.\u0027\n \u0027Or he\u0027ll squash me like a bug,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027Huh?\u0027\n \u0027Your actual lines are, \u0027Let me give you a piece of advice ¡ª don\u0027t fuck with Mr. Devore or he\u0027ll squash you like a bug.\u0027\u0027\n I could see by his expression ¡ª half past perplexed, going on angry ¡ª that he had meant to say something very much like that. Obviously we\u0027d seen the same movies, including all those in which Robert De Niro plays a psycho. Then his face cleared.\n \u0027Oh sure, you\u0027re the writer,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027That\u0027s what they tell me.\u0027\n \u0027You can say stuff like that \u0027cause you\u0027re a writer.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s a free country, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Ain\u0027t you a smartass, now.\u0027\n \u0027How long have you been working for Max Devore, Deputy? And does the County Sheriffs office know you\u0027re moonlighting?\u0027\n \u0027They know. It\u0027s not a problem. You\u0027re the one that might have the problem, Mr. Smartass Writer.\u0027\n I decided it was time to quit this before we descended to the kaka-poopie stage of name-calling.\n \u0027Get out of my driveway, please, Deputy.\u0027\n He looked at me a moment longer, obviously searching for that perfect capper line and not finding it. He needed a Mr. Smartass Writer to help him, that was all. \u0027I\u0027ll be looking for you on Friday,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Does that mean you\u0027re going to buy me lunch? Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m a fairly cheap date.\u0027\n His reddish cheeks darkened a degree further, and I could see what they were going to look like when he was sixty, if he didn\u0027t lay off the firewater in the meantime. He got back into his Ford and reversed up my driveway hard enough to make his tires holler. I stood where I was, watching him go. Once he was headed back out Lane Forty-two to the highway, I went into the house. It occurred to me that Deputy Footman\u0027s extracurricular job must pay well, if he could afford a Rolex. On the other hand, maybe it was a knockoff.\n Settle down, Michael, Jo\u0027s voice advised. The red rag is gone now, no one\u0027s waving anything in front of you, so just settle ¡ª\n I shut her voice out. I didn\u0027t want to settle down; I wanted to settle up. I had been interfered with.\n I walked over to the hall desk where Jo and I had always kept our pending documents (and our desk calendars, now that I thought about it), and tacked the summons to the bulletin board by one corner of its buff-colored jacket. With that much accomplished, I raised my fist in front of my eyes, looked at the wedding ring on it for a moment, then slammed it against the wall beside the bookcase. I did it hard enough to make an entire row of paperbacks jump. I thought about Mattie Devore\u0027s baggy shorts and Kmart smock, then about her father-in-law paying four and a quarter million dollars for Warrington\u0027s. Writing a personal goddamned check. I thought about Bill Dean saying that one way or another, that little girl was going to grow up in California.\n I walked back and forth through the house, still simmering, and finally ended up in front of the fridge. The circle of magnets was the same, but the letters inside had changed. Instead of\n they now read\n help r\n \u0027Helper?\u0027 I said, and as soon as I heard the word out loud, I understood. The letters on the fridge consisted of only a single alphabet (no, not even that, I saw; g and x had been lost someplace), and I\u0027d have to get more. If the front of my Kenmore was going to become a Ouija board, I\u0027d need a good supply of letters. Especially vowels. In the meantime, I moved the h and the e in front of the r. Now the message read\n lp her\n I scattered the circle of fruit and vegetable magnets with my palm, spread the letters, and resumed pacing. I had made a decision not to get between Devore and his daughter-in-law, but I\u0027d wound up between them anyway. A deputy in Cleveland clothing had shown up in my driveway, complicating a life that already had its problems . . . and scaring me a little in the bargain. But at least it was a fear of something I could see and understand. All at once I decided I wanted to do more with the summer than worry about ghosts, crying kids, and what my wife had been up to four or five years ago . . . if, in fact, she had been up to anything. I couldn\u0027t write books, but that didn\u0027t mean I had to pick scabs.\n Help her.\n I decided I would at least try.\n \u0027Harold Oblowski Literary Agency.\u0027\n \u0027Come to Belize with me, Nola,\u0027 I said. \u0027I need you. We\u0027ll make beautiful love at midnight, when the full moon turns the beach to a bone.\u0027\n \u0027Hello, Mr. Noonan,\u0027 she said. No sense of humor had Nola. No sense of romance, either. In some ways that made her perfect for the Oblowski Agency. \u0027Would you like to speak to Harold?\u0027\n \u0027If he\u0027s in.\u0027\n \u0027He is. Please hold.\u0027\n One nice thing about being a best selling author ¡ª even one whose books only appear, as a general rule, on lists that go to fifteen ¡ª is that your agent almost always happens to be in. Another is if he\u0027s vacationing on Nantucket, he\u0027ll be in to you there. A third is that the time you spend on hold is usually quite short.\n \u0027Mike!\u0027 he cried. \u0027How\u0027s the lake? I thought about you all weekend!\u0027\n Yeah, I thought, and pigs will whistle.\n \u0027Things are fine in general but shitty in one particular, Harold. I need to talk to a lawyer. I thought first about calling Ward Hankins for a recommendation, but then I decided I wanted somebody a little more high-powered than Ward was likely to know. Someone with filed teeth and a taste for human flesh would be nice.\u0027\n This time Harold didn\u0027t bother with the long-pause routine. \u0027What\u0027s up, Mike? Are you in trouble?\u0027\n Thump once for yes, twice for no, I thought, and for one wild moment thought of actually doing just that. I remembered finishing Christy Brown\u0027s memoir, Down All the Days, and wondering what it would be like to write an entire book with the pen grasped between the toes of your left foot. Now I wondered what it would be like to go through eternity with no way to communicate but rapping on the cellar wall. And even then only certain people would be able to hear and understand you . . . and only those certain people at certain times.\n Jo, was it you? And if it was, why did you answer both ways?\n \u0027Mike? Are you there?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. This isn\u0027t really my trouble, Harold, so cool your jets. I do have a problem, though. Your main guy is Goldacre, right?\u0027\n \u0027Right. I\u0027ll call him right aw ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027But he deals primarily with contracts law.\u0027 I was thinking out loud now, and when I paused, Harold didn\u0027t fill it. Sometimes he\u0027s an all-right guy. Most times, really. \u0027Call him for me anyway, would you? Tell him I need to talk to an attorney with a good working knowledge of child-custody law. Have him put me in touch with the best one who\u0027s free to take a case immediately. One who can be in court with me Friday, if that\u0027s necessary.\u0027\n \u0027Is it paternity?\u0027 he asked, sounding both respectful and afraid.\n \u0027No, custody.\u0027 I thought about telling him to get the whole story from the Lawyer to Be Named Later, but Harold deserved better . . . and would demand to hear my version sooner or later anyway, no matter what the lawyer told him. I gave him an account of my Fourth of July morning and its aftermath. I stuck with the Devores, mentioning nothing about voices, crying children, or thumps in the dark. Harold only interrupted once, and that was when he realized who the villain of the piece was.\n \u0027You\u0027re asking for trouble,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know that, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m in for a certain measure of it in any case,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027ve decided I want to dish out a little as well, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027You will not have the peace and quiet that a writer needs to do his best work,\u0027 Harold said in an amusingly prim voice. I wondered what the reaction would be if I said that was okay, I hadn\u0027t written anything more riveting than a grocery list since Jo died, and maybe this would stir me up a little. But I didn\u0027t. Never let em see you sweat, the Noonan clan\u0027s motto. Someone should carve DON\u0027T WORRY I\u0027M FINE on the door of the family crypt.\n Then I thought: help r.\n \u0027That young woman needs a friend,\u0027 I said, \u0027and Jo would have wanted me to be one to her. Jo didn\u0027t like it when the little folks got stepped on.\u0027\n \u0027You think?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027ll see who I can find. And Mike . . . do you want me to come up on Friday for this depo?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027 It came out sounding needlessly abrupt and was followed by a silence that seemed not calculated but hurt. \u0027Listen, Harold, my caretaker said the actual custody hearing is scheduled soon. If it happens and you still want to come up, I\u0027ll give you a call. I can always use your moral support ¡ª you know that.\u0027\n \u0027In my case it\u0027s immoral support,\u0027 he replied, but he sounded cheery again.\n We said goodbye. I walked back to the fridge and looked at the magnets. They were still scattered hell to breakfast, and that was sort of a relief. Even the spirits must have to rest sometimes.\n I took the cordless phone, went out onto the deck, and plonked down in the chair where I\u0027d been on the night of the Fourth, when Devore called. Even after my visit from \u0027daddy,\u0027 I could still hardly believe that conversation. Devore had called me a liar; I had told him to stick my telephone number up his ass. We were off to a great start as neighbors.\n I pulled the chair a little closer to the edge of the deck, which dropped a giddy forty feet or so to the slope between Sara\u0027s backside and the lake. I looked for the green woman I\u0027d seen while swimming, telling myself not to be a dope ¡ª things like that you can see only from one angle, stand even ten feet off to one side or the other and there\u0027s nothing to look at. But this was apparently a case of the exception\u0027s proving the rule. I was both amused and a little uneasy to realize that the birch down there by The Street looked like a woman from the land side as well as from the lake. Some of it was due to the pine just behind it ¡ª that bare branch jutting off to the north like a bony pointing arm ¡ª but not all of it. From back here the birch\u0027s white limbs and narrow leaves still made a woman\u0027s shape, and when the wind shook the lower levels of the tree, the green and silver swirled like long skirts.\n I had said no to Harold\u0027s well-meant offer to come up almost before it was fully articulated, and as I looked at the tree-woman, rather ghostly in her own right, I knew why: Harold was loud, Harold was insensitive to nuance, Harold might frighten off whatever was here. I didn\u0027t want that. I was scared, yes ¡ª standing on those dark cellar stairs and listening to the thumps from just below me, I had been fucking terrified ¡ª but I had also felt fully alive for the first time in years. I was touching something in Sara that was entirely beyond my experience, and it fascinated me.\n The cordless phone rang in my lap, making me jump. I grabbed it, expecting Max Devore or perhaps Footman, his overgolded minion. It turned out to be a lawyer named John Storrow, who sounded as if he might have graduated from law school fairly recently ¡ª like last week. Still, he worked for the firm of Avery, McLain, and Bernstein on Park Avenue, and Park Avenue is a pretty good address for a lawyer, even one who still has a few of his milk-teeth. If Henry Goldacre said Storrow was good, he probably was. And his specialty was custody law.\n \u0027Now tell me what\u0027s happening up there,\u0027 he said when the introductions were over and the background had been sketched in.\n I did my best, feeling my spirits rise a little as the tale wound on. There\u0027s something oddly comforting about talking to a legal guy once the billable-hours clock has started running; you have passed the magical point at which a lawyer becomes your lawyer. Your lawyer is warm, your lawyer is sympathetic, your lawyer makes notes on a yellow pad and nods in all the right places. Most of the questions your lawyer asks are questions you can answer. And if you can\u0027t, your lawyer will help you find a way to do so, by God. Your lawyer is always on your side. Your enemies are his enemies. To him you are never shit but always Shinola.\n When I had finished, John Storrow said: \u0027Wow. I\u0027m surprised the papers haven\u0027t gotten hold of this.\u0027\n \u0027That never occurred to me.\u0027 But I could see his point. The Devore family saga wasn\u0027t for the New York Times or Boston Globe, probably not even for the Derry News, but in weekly supermarket tabs like The National Enquirer or Inside View, it would fit like a glove ¡ª instead of the girl, King Kong decides to snatch the girl\u0027s innocent child and carry it with him to the top of the Empire State Building. Oh, eek, unhand that baby, you brute. It wasn\u0027t front-page stuff, no blood or celebrity morgue shots, but as a page nine shouter it would do nicely. In my mind I composed a headline blaring over side-by-side pix of Warrington\u0027s Lodge and Mattie\u0027s rusty doublewide: COMPU-KING LIVES IN SPLENDOR AS HE TRIES TO TAKE YOUNG BEAUTY\u0027S ONLY CHILD. Probably too long, I decided. I wasn\u0027t writing anymore and still I needed an editor. That was pretty sad when you stopped to think about it.\n \u0027Perhaps at some point we\u0027ll see that they do get the story,\u0027 Storrow said in a musing tone. I realized that this was a man I could grow attached to, at least in my present angry mood. He grew brisker. \u0027Who\u0027m I representing here, Mr. Noonan? You or the young lady? I vote for the young lady.\u0027\n \u0027The young lady doesn\u0027t even know I\u0027ve called you. She may think I\u0027ve taken a bit too much on myself. She may, in fact, give me the rough side of her tongue.\u0027\n \u0027Why would she do that?\u0027\n \u0027Because she\u0027s a Yankee ¡ª a Maine Yankee, the worst kind. On a given day, they can make the Irish look logical.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps, but she\u0027s the one with the target pinned to her shirt. I suggest that you call and tell her that.\u0027\n I promised I would. It wasn\u0027t a hard promise to make, either. I\u0027d known I\u0027d have to be in touch with her ever since I had accepted the summons from Deputy Footman. \u0027And who stands for Michael Noonan come Friday morning?\u0027\n Storrow laughed dryly. \u0027I\u0027ll find someone local to do that. He\u0027ll go into this Durgin\u0027s office with you, sit quietly with his briefcase on his lap, and listen. I may be in town by that point ¡ª I won\u0027t know until I talk to Ms. Devore ¡ª but I won\u0027t be in Durgin\u0027s office. When the custody hearing comes around, though, you\u0027ll see my face in the place.\u0027\n \u0027All right, good. Call me with the name of my new lawyer. My other new lawyer.\u0027\n \u0027Uh-huh. In the meantime, talk to the young lady. Get me a job.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll try.\u0027\n \u0027Also try to stay visible if you\u0027re with her,\u0027 he said. \u0027If we give the bad guys room to get nasty, they\u0027ll get nasty.\n There\u0027s nothing like that between you, is there? Nothing nasty? Sorry to have to ask, but I do have to ask.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s been quite some time since I\u0027ve been up to anything nasty with anyone.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m tempted to commiserate, Mr. Noonan, but under the circumstances ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Mike. Make it Mike.\u0027\n \u0027Good. I like that. And I\u0027m John. People are going to talk about your involvement anyway. You know that, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Sure. People know I can afford you. They\u0027ll speculate about how she can afford me. Pretty young widow, middle-aged widower. Sex would seem the most likely.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a realist.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t really think I am, but I know a hawk from a handsaw.\u0027\n \u0027I hope you do, because the ride could get rough. This is an extremely rich man we\u0027re going up against.\u0027 Yet he didn\u0027t sound scared. He sounded almost . . . greedy. He sounded the way part of me had felt when I saw that the magnets on the fridge were back in a circle.\n \u0027I know he is.\u0027\n \u0027In court that won\u0027t matter a whole helluva lot, because there\u0027s a certain amount of money on the other side. Also, the judge is going to be very aware that this one is a powderkeg. That can be useful.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s the best thing we\u0027ve got going for us?\u0027 I asked this thinking of Kyra\u0027s rosy, unmarked face and her complete lack of fear in the presence of her mother. I asked it thinking John would reply that the charges were clearly unfounded. I thought wrong.\n \u0027The best thing? Devore\u0027s age. He\u0027s got to be older than God.\u0027\n \u0027Based on what I\u0027ve heard over the weekend, I think he must be eighty-five. That would make God older.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, but as a potential dad he makes Tony Randall look like a teenager,\u0027 John said, and now he sounded positively gloating. \u0027Think of it, Michael ¡ª the kid graduates from high school the year Gramps turns one hundred. Also there\u0027s a chance the old man\u0027s overreached himself. Do you know what a guardian ad litem is?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Essentially it\u0027s a lawyer the court appoints to protect the interests of the child. A fee for the service comes out of court costs, but it\u0027s a pittance. Most people who agree to serve as guardian ad litem have strictly altruistic motives . . . but not all of them. In any case, the ad litem puts his own spin on the case. Judges don\u0027t have to take the guy\u0027s advice, but they almost always do. It makes a judge look stupid to reject the advice of his own appointee, and the thing a judge hates above all others is looking stupid.\u0027\n \u0027Devore will have his own lawyer?\u0027\n John laughed. \u0027How about half a dozen at the actual custody hearing?\u0027\n \u0027Are you serious?\u0027\n \u0027The guy is eighty-five. That\u0027s too old for Ferraris, too old for bungee jumping in Tibet, and too old for whores unless he\u0027s a mighty man. What does that leave for him to spend his money on?\u0027\n \u0027Lawyers,\u0027 I said bleakly.\n \u0027Yep.\u0027\n \u0027And Mattie Devore? What does she get?\u0027\n \u0027Thanks to you, she gets me,\u0027 John Storrow said. \u0027It\u0027s like a John Grisham novel, isn\u0027t it? Pure gold. Meantime, I\u0027m interested in Durgin, the ad litem. If Devore hasn\u0027t been expecting any real trouble, he may have been unwise enough to put temptation in Durgin\u0027s way. And Durgin may have been stupid enough to succumb. Hey, who knows what we might find?\u0027\n But I was a turn back. \u0027She gets you,\u0027 I said. \u0027Thanks to me. And if I wasn\u0027t here to stick in my oar? What would she get then?\u0027\n \u0027Bubkes. That\u0027s Yiddish. It means ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027I know what it means,\u0027 I said. \u0027That\u0027s incredible.\u0027\n \u0027Nope, just American justice. You know the lady with the scales? The one who stands outside most city courthouses?\u0027\n \u0027Uh-huh.\u0027\n \u0027Slap some handcuffs on that broad\u0027s wrists and some tape over her mouth to go along with the blindfold, rape her and roll her in the mud. You like that image? I don\u0027t, but it\u0027s a fair representation of how the law works in custody cases where the plaintiff is rich and the defendant is poor. And sexual equality has actually made it worse, because while mothers still tend to be poor, they are no longer seen as the automatic choice for custody.\u0027\n \u0027Mattie Devore\u0027s got to have you, doesn\u0027t she?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 John said simply. \u0027Call me tomorrow and tell me that she will.\u0027\n \u0027I hope I can do that.\u0027\n \u0027So do I. And listen ¡ª there\u0027s one more thing.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027You lied to Devore on the telephone.\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit!\u0027\n \u0027Nope, nope, I hate to contradict my sister\u0027s favorite author, but you did and you know it. You told Devore that mother and child were out together, the kid was picking flowers, everything was fine. You put everything in there except Bambi and Thumper.\u0027\n I was sitting up straight in my deck-chair now. I felt sandbagged. I also felt that my own cleverness had been overlooked. \u0027Hey, no, think again. I never came out and said anything. I told him I assumed. I used the word more than once. I remember that very clearly.\u0027\n \u0027Uh-huh, and if he was taping your conversation, you\u0027ll get a chance to actually count how many times you used it.\u0027\n At first I didn\u0027t answer. I was thinking back to the conversation I\u0027d had with him, remembering the underhum on the phone line, the characteristic underhum I remembered from all my previous summers at Sara Laughs. Had that steady low mmmmm been even more noticeable on Saturday night? \u0027I guess maybe there could be a tape,\u0027 I said reluctantly.\n \u0027Uh-huh. And if Devore\u0027s lawyer gets it to the ad litem, how do you think you\u0027ll sound?\u0027\n \u0027Careful,\u0027 I said. \u0027Maybe like a man with something to hide.\u0027\n \u0027Or a man spinning yarns. And you\u0027re good at that, aren\u0027t you? After all, it\u0027s what you do for a living. At the custody hearing, Devore\u0027s lawyer is apt to mention that. If he then produces one of the people who passed you shortly after Mattie arrived on the scene . . . a person who testifies that the young lady seemed upset and flustered . . . how do you think you\u0027ll sound then?\u0027\n \u0027Like a liar,\u0027 I said, and then: \u0027Ah, fuck.\u0027\n \u0027Fear not, Mike. Be of good cheer.\u0027\n \u0027What should I do?\u0027\n \u0027Spike their guns before they can fire them. Tell Durgin exactly what happened. Get it in the depo. Emphasize the fact that the little girl thought she was walking safely. Make sure you get in that \u0027crossmock\u0027 thing. I love that.\u0027\n \u0027Then if they have a tape they\u0027ll play it and I\u0027ll look like a story-changing schmuck.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. You weren\u0027t a sworn witness when you talked to Devore, were you? There you were, sitting out on your deck and minding your own business, watching the fireworks show. Out of the blue this grouchy old asshole calls you. Starts ranting. Didn\u0027t even give him your number, did you?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Your unlisted number.\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027And while he said he was Maxwell Devore, he could have been anyone, right?\u0027\n \u0027Right.\u0027\n \u0027He could have been the Shah of Iran.\u0027\n \u0027No, the Shah\u0027s dead.\u0027\n \u0027The Shah\u0027s out, then. But he could have been a nosy neighbor . . . or a prankster.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And you said what you said with all those possibilities in mind. But now that you\u0027re part of an official court proceeding, you\u0027re telling the whole truth and nothing but.\u0027\n \u0027You bet.\u0027 That good my-lawyer feeling had deserted me for a bit, but it was back full-force now. \u0027You can\u0027t do better than the truth, Mike,\u0027 he said solemnly. \u0027Except maybe in a few cases, and this isn\u0027t one. Are we clear on that?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027All right, we\u0027re done. I want to hear from either you or Mattie Devore around elevenish tomorrow. It ought to be her.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll try.\u0027\n \u0027If she really balks, you know what to do, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I think so. Thanks, John.\u0027\n \u0027One way or another, we\u0027ll talk very soon,\u0027 he said, and hung up.\n I sat where I was for awhile. Once I pushed the button which opened the line on the cordless phone, then pushed it again to close it. I had to talk to Mattie, but I wasn\u0027t quite ready yet. I decided to take a walk instead.\n If she really balks, you know what to do, don\u0027t you?\n Of course.\n Remind her that she couldn\u0027t afford to be proud. That she couldn\u0027t afford to go all Yankee, refusing charity from Michael Noonan, author of Being Two, The Red-Shirt Man, and the soon-to-be-published Helen\u0027s Promise. Remind her that she could have her pride or her daughter, but likely not both.\n Hey, Mattie, pick one.\n I walked almost to the end of the lane, stopping at Tidwell\u0027s Meadow with its pretty view down to the cup of the lake and across to the White Mountains. The water dreamed under a hazy sky, looking gray when you tipped your head one way, blue when you tipped it the other. That sense of mystery was very much with me. That sense of Manderley.\n Over forty black people had settled here at the turn of the century ¡ª lit here for awhile, anyway ¡ª according to Marie Hingerman (also according to A History of Castle County and Castle Rock, a weighty tome published in 1977, the county\u0027s bicentennial year). Pretty special black people, too:\n most of them related, most of them talented, most of them part of a musical group which had first been called The Red-Top Boys and then Sara Tidwell and the Red-Top Boys. They had bought the meadow and a good-sized tract of lakeside land from a man named Douglas Day. The money had been saved up over a period of ten years, according to Sonny Tidwell, who did the dickering (as a Red-Top, Son Tidwell had played what was then known as \u0027chickenscratch guitar\u0027).\n There had been a vast uproar about it in town, and even a meeting to protest \u0027the advent of these darkies, which come in a Horde.\u0027 Things had settled down and turned out okay, as things have a way of doing, more often than not. The shanty town most locals had expected on Day\u0027s Hill (for so Tidwell\u0027s Meadow was called in 1900, when Son Tidwell bought the land on behalf of his extensive clan) had never appeared. Instead, a number of neat white cabins sprang up, surrounding a larger building that might have been intended as a group meeting place, a rehearsal area, or perhaps, at some point, a performance hall.\n Sara and the Red-Top Boys (sometimes there was a Red-Top Girl in there, as well; membership in the band was fluid, changing with every performance) played around western Maine for over a year, maybe closer to two years. In towns all up and down the Western Line ¡ª Farmington, Skowhegan, Bridgton, Gates Falls, Castle Rock, Morton, Fryeburg ¡ª you\u0027ll still come across their old show-posters at barn bazaars and junkatoriums. Sara and the Red-Tops were great favorites on the circuit, and they got along all right at home on the TR, too, which never surprised me. At the end of the day Robert Frost ¡ª that utilitarian and often unpleasant poet ¡ª was right: in the northeastern three we really do believe that good fences make good neighbors. We squawk and then keep a miserly peace, the kind with gimlet eyes and a tucked-down mouth. \u0027They pay their bills,\u0027 we say. \u0027I ain\u0027t never had to shoot one a their dogs,\u0027 we say. \u0027They keep themselves to themselves,\u0027 we say, as if isolation were a virtue. And, of course, the defining virtue: \u0027They don\u0027t take charity.\u0027\n And at some point, Sara Tidwell became Sara Laughs.\n In the end, though, TR-90 mustn\u0027t have been what they wanted, because after playing a county fair or two in the late summer of 1901, the clan moved on. Their neat little cabins provided summer-rental income for the Day family until 1933, when they burned in the summer fires which charred the east and north sides of the lake. End of story.\n Except for her music, that was. Her music had lived.\n I got up from the rock I had been sitting on, stretched my arms and my back, and walked back down the lane, singing one of her songs as I went. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-12.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: \n Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
