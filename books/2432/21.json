{"id":100904,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"I didn\u0027t see them at first, which wasn\u0027t surprising; it seemed that half of Castle Rock was on the town common as that sultry Saturday afternoon edged on toward evening. The air was bright with hazy midsummer light, and in it kids swarmed over the playground equipment, a number of old men in bright red vests ¡ª some sort of club, I assumed ¡ª played chess, and a group of young people lay on the grass listening to a teenager in a headband playing the guitar and singing one I remembered from an old Ian and Sylvia record, a cheery tune that went\\n\\n \u0027Ella Speed was havin her lovin fun,\\n\\n John Martin shot Ella with a Colt forty-one . . . \u0027\\n\\n I saw no joggers, and no dogs chasing Frisbees. It was just too goddam hot.\\n\\n I was turning to look at the bandshell, where an eight-man combo called The Castle Rockers was setting up (I had an idea \u0027In the Mood\u0027 was about as close as they got to rock and roll), when a small person hit me from behind, grabbing me just above the knees and almost dumping me on the grass.\\n\\n \u0027Gotcha!\u0027 the small person cried gleefully.\\n\\n \u0027Kyra Devore!\u0027 Mattie called, sounding both amused and irritated. \u0027You\u0027ll knock him down!\u0027\\n\\n I turned, dropped the grease-spotted McDonald\u0027s bag I had been carrying, and lifted the kid up. It felt natural, and it felt wonderful. You don\u0027t realize the weight of a healthy child until you hold one, nor do you fully comprehend the life that runs through them like a bright wire. I didn\u0027t get choked up (\u0027Don\u0027t go all corny on me, Mike,\u0027 Siddy would sometimes whisper when we were kids at the movies and I got wet-eyed at a sad part), but I thought of Jo, yes. And the child she had been carrying when she fell down in that stupid parking lot, yes to that, too.\\n\\n Ki was squealing and laughing, her arms outspread and her hair hanging down in two amusing clumps accented by Raggedy Ann and Andy barrettes.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t tackle your own quarterback!\u0027 I yelled, grinning, and to my delight she yelled it right back at me: \u0027Don\u0027t taggle yer own quartermack! Don\u0027t taggle yer own quartermack!\u0027\\n\\n I set her on her feet, both of us laughing. Ki took a step backward, tripped herself, and sat down on the grass, laughing harder than ever. I had a mean thought, then, brief but oh so clear: if only the old lizard could see how much he was missed. How sad we were at his passing.\\n\\n Mattie walked over, and tonight she looked as I\u0027d half-imagined her when I first met her ¡ª like one of those lovely children of privilege you see at the country club, either goofing with their friends or sitting seriously at dinner with their parents. She was in a white sleeveless dress and low heels, her hair falling loose around her shoulders, a touch of lipstick on her mouth. Her eyes had a brilliance in them that hadn\u0027t been there before. When she hugged me I could smell her perfume and feel the press of her firm little breasts.\\n\\n I kissed her cheek; she kissed me high up on the jaw, making a smack in my ear that I felt all the way down my back. \u0027Say things are going to be better now,\u0027 she whispered, still holding me.\\n\\n \u0027Lots better now,\u0027 I said, and she hugged me again, tight. Then she stepped away \u0027You better have brought plenty food, big boy, because we plenty hungry womens. Right, Kyra?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I taggled my own quartermack,\u0027 Ki said, then leaned back on her elbows, giggling deliciously at the bright and hazy sky.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 I said, and grabbed her by the middle I toted her that way to a nearby picnic table, Ki kicking her legs and waving her arms and laughing I set her down on the bench; she slid off it and beneath the table, boneless as an eel and still laughing.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Kyra Elizabeth,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027Sit up and show the other side\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good girl, good girl,\u0027 she said, clambering up beside me. \u0027That\u0027s the other side to me, Mike\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 I said. Inside the bag there were Big Macs and fries for Mattie and me. For Ki there was a colorful box upon which Ronald McDonald and his unindicted co-conspirators capered.\\n\\n \u0027Mattie, I got a Happy Meal! Mike got me a Happy Meal! They have toys!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well see what yours is.\u0027\\n\\n Kyra opened the box, poked around, then smiled It lit up her whole face She brought out something that I at first thought was a big dust-ball For one horrible second I was back in my dream, the one of Jo under the bed with the book over her face Give me that, she had snarled It\u0027s my dust-catcher. And something else, too ¡ª some other association, perhaps from some other dream I couldn\u0027t get hold of it.\\n\\n \u0027Mike?\u0027 Mattie asked. Curiosity in her voice, and maybe borderline concern.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a doggy!\u0027 Ki said \u0027I won a doggy in my Happy Meal!\u0027\\n\\n Yes; of course A dog. A little stuffed dog. And it was gray, not black . . . although why I\u0027d care about the color either way I didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a pretty good prize,\u0027 I said, taking it. It was soft, which was good, and it was gray, which was better Being gray made it all right, somehow Crazy but true I handed it back to her and smiled.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s his name?\u0027 Ki asked, jumping the little dog back and forth across her Happy Meal box. \u0027What doggy\u0027s name, Mike?\u0027\\n\\n And, without thinking, I said, \u0027Strickland.\u0027\\n\\n I thought she\u0027d look puzzled, but she didn\u0027t. She looked delighted. \u0027Stricken!\u0027 she said, bouncing the dog back and forth in ever-higher leaps over the box. \u0027Stricken! Stricken! My dog Stricken!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s this guy Strickland?\u0027 Mattie asked, smiling a little. She had begun to unwrap her hamburger.\\n\\n \u0027A character in a book I read once,\u0027 I said, watching Ki play with the little puffball dog. \u0027No one real.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My grampa died,\u0027 she said five minutes later.\\n\\n We were still at the picnic table but the food was mostly gone. Strickland the stuffed puffball had been set to guard the remaining french fries. I had been scanning the ebb and flow of people, wondering who was here from the TR observing our tryst and simply burning to carry the news back home. I saw no one I knew, but that didn\u0027t mean a whole tot, considering how long I\u0027d been away from this part of the world.\\n\\n Mattie put down her burger and looked at Ki with some anxiety, but I thought the kid was okay ¡ª she had been giving news, not expressing grief.\\n\\n \u0027I know he did,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Grampa was awful old.\u0027 Ki pinched a couple of french fries between her pudgy little fingers. They rose to her mouth, then gloop, all gone. \u0027He\u0027s with Lord Jesus now. We had all about Lord Jesus in VBS.\u0027\\n\\n Yes, Ki, I thought, right now Grampy\u0027s probably teaching Lord Jesus how to use Pixel Easel and asking if there might be a whore handy.\\n\\n \u0027Lord Jesus walked on water and also changed the wine into macaroni.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, something like that,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s sad when people die, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would be sad if Mattie died, and it would be sad if you died, but Grampy was old.\u0027 She said it as though I hadn\u0027t quite grasped this concept the first time. \u0027In heaven he\u0027ll get all fixed up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a good way to look at it, hon,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n Mattie did maintenance on Ki\u0027s drooping barrettes, working carefully and with a kind of absent love. I thought she glowed in the summer light, her skin in smooth, tanned contrast to the white dress she had probably bought at one of the discount stores, and I understood that I loved her. Maybe that was all right.\\n\\n \u0027I miss the white nana, though,\u0027 Ki said, and this time she did look sad. She picked up the stuffed dog, tried to feed him a french fry, then put him down again. Her small, pretty face looked pensive now, and I could see a whisper of her grandfather in it. It was far back but it was there, perceptible, another ghost. \u0027Mom says white nana went back to California with Grampy\u0027s early remains.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Earthly remains, Ki-bird,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027That means his body.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will white nana come back and see me, Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We had a game. It was all rhymes.\u0027 She looked more pensive than ever.\\n\\n \u0027Your mom told me about that game,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027She won\u0027t be back,\u0027 Ki said, answering her own question. One very large tear rolled down her right cheek. She picked up \u0027Stricken,\u0027 stood him on his back legs for a second, then put him back on guard-duty. Mattie slipped an arm around her, but Ki didn\u0027t seem to notice. \u0027White nana didn\u0027t really like me. She was just pretending to like me. That was her job.\u0027\\n\\n Mattie and I exchanged a glance.\\n\\n \u0027What makes you say that?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 Ki said. Over by where the kid was playing the guitar, a juggler in whiteface had started up, working with half a dozen colored balls. Kyra brightened a little. \u0027Mommy-bommy, may I go watch that funny white man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you done eating?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m full.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank Mike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t taggle yer own quartermack,\u0027 she said, then laughed kindly to show she was just pulling my leg. \u0027Thanks, Mike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a problem,\u0027 I said, and then, because that sounded a little old-fashioned: \u0027Kickin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can go as far as that tree, but no farther,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027And you know why.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you can see me. I will.\u0027\\n\\n She grabbed Strickland and started to run off, then stopped and looked over her shoulder at me. \u0027I guess it was the fridgeafator people,\u0027 she said, then corrected herself very carefully and seriously. \u0027The ree fridge-a-rator people.\u0027 My heart took a hard double beat in my chest.\\n\\n \u0027It was the refrigerator people what, Ki?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027That said white nana didn\u0027t really like me.\u0027 Then she ran off toward the juggler, oblivious to the heat.\\n\\n Mattie watched her go, then turned back to me. \u0027I haven\u0027t talked to anybody about Ki\u0027s fridgeafator people. Neither has she, until now. Not that there are any real people, but the letters seem to move around by themselves. It\u0027s like a Ouija board.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do they spell things?\u0027\\n\\n For a long time she said nothing. Then she nodded. \u0027Not always, but sometimes.\u0027 Another pause. \u0027Most times, actually. Ki calls it mail from the people in the refrigerator.\u0027 She smiled, but her eyes were a little scared. \u0027Are they special magnetic letters, do you think? Or have we got a poltergeist working the lakefront?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sorry I brought them, if they\u0027re a problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly. You gave them to her, and you\u0027re a tremendously big deal to her right now. She talks about you all the time. She was much more interested in picking out something pretty to wear for you tonight than she was in her grandfather\u0027s death. I was supposed to wear something pretty, too, Kyra insisted. She\u0027s not that way about people, usually ¡ª she takes them when they\u0027re there and leaves them when they\u0027re gone. That\u0027s not such a bad way for a little girl to grow up, I sometimes think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You both dressed pretty,\u0027 I said. \u0027That much I\u0027m sure of.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks.\u0027 She looked fondly at Ki, who stood by the tree watching the juggler. He had put his rubber balls aside and moved on to Indian clubs. Then she looked back at me. \u0027Are we done eating?\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, and Mattie began to pick up the trash and stuff it back into the take-out bag. I helped, and when our fingers touched, she gripped my hand and squeezed. \u0027Thank you,\u0027 she said. \u0027For everything you\u0027ve done. Thank you so damn much.\u0027\\n\\n I squeezed back, then let go.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 she said, \u0027it\u0027s crossed my mind that Kyra\u0027s moving the letters around herself. Mentally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Telekinesis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess that\u0027s the technical term. Only Ki can\u0027t spell much more than \"dog\" and \"cat.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s showing up on the fridge?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Names, mostly. Once it was yours. Once it was your wife\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jo?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The whole thing ¡ª JOANNA. And NANA. Rogette, I presume. JARED shows up sometimes, and BRIDGET. Once there was KITO.\u0027 She spelled it.\\n\\n \u0027Kito,\u0027 I said, and thought: Kyra, Kia, Kito. What is this? \u0027A boy\u0027s name, do you think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know it is. It\u0027s Swahili, and means precious child. I looked it up in my baby-name book.\u0027 She glanced toward her own precious child as we walked across the grass to the nearest trash barrel.\\n\\n \u0027Any others that you can remember?\u0027\\n\\n She thought. \u0027REG has showed up a couple of times. And once there was CARLA. You understand that Ki can\u0027t even read these names as a rule, don\u0027t you? She has to ask me what they say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has it occurred to you that Kyra might be copying them out of a book or a magazine? That she\u0027s learning to write using the magnetic letters on the fridge instead of paper and pencil?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose that\u0027s possible . . . \u0027 She didn\u0027t look as if she believed it, though. Not surprising. I didn\u0027t believe it myself.\\n\\n \u0027I mean, you\u0027ve never actually seen the letters moving around by themselves on the front of the fridge, have you?\u0027 I hoped I sounded as unconcerned asking this question as I wanted to.\\n\\n She laughed a bit nervously. \u0027God, no!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anything else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes the fridgeafator people leave messages like HI and BYE and GOOD GIRL. There was one yesterday that I wrote down to show you. Kyra asked me to. It\u0027s really weird.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d rather show you, but I left it in the glove compartment of the Scout. Remind me when we go.\u0027\\n\\n Yes. I would.\\n\\n \u0027This is some spooky shit, se?or,\u0027 she said. \u0027Like the writing in the flour that time.\u0027\\n\\n I thought about telling her I had my own fridgeafator people, then didn\u0027t. She had enough to worry about without that . . . or so I told myself.\\n\\n We stood side-by-side on the grass, watching Ki watch the juggler. \u0027Did you call John?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027You bet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His reaction?\u0027\\n\\n She turned to me, laughing with her eyes. \u0027He actually sang a verse of \"Ding Dong, the Witch Is Dead.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wrong sex, right sentiment.\u0027\\n\\n She nodded, her eyes going back to Kyra. I thought again how beautiful she looked, her body slim in the white dress, her features clean and perfectly made.\\n\\n \u0027Was he pissed at me inviting myself to lunch?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Nope, he loved the idea of having a party.\u0027\\n\\n A party. He loved the idea. I began to feel rather small.\\n\\n \u0027He even suggested we invite your lawyer from last Friday. Mr. Bissonette? Plus the private detective John hired on Mr. Bissonette\u0027s recommendation. Is that okay with you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fine. How about you, Mattie? Doing okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doing okay,\u0027 she agreed, turning to me. \u0027I did have several more calls than usual today. I\u0027m suddenly quite popular.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-oh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Most were hangups, but one gentleman took time enough to call me a cunt, and there was a lady with a very strong Yankee accent who said, \u0027Theah, you bitch, you\u0027ve killed him. Aaa you satisfied?\u0027 She hung up before I could tell her yes, very satisfied, thanks.\u0027 But Mattie didn\u0027t look satisfied; she looked unhappy and guilty, as if she had literally wished him dead.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s okay. Really. Kyra and I have been alone for a long time, and I\u0027ve been scared for most of it. Now I\u0027ve made a couple of friends. If a few anonymous phone calls are the price I have to pay, I\u0027ll pay it.\u0027\\n\\n She was very close, looking up at me, and I couldn\u0027t stop myself. I put the blame on summer, her perfume, and four years without a woman. In that order, i slipped my arms around her waist, and remember perfectly the texture of her dress beneath my hands; the slight pucker at the back where the zipper hid in its sleeve. I remember the sensation of the cloth moving against the bare skin beneath. Then I was kissing her, very gently but very thoroughly ¡ª anything worth doing is worth doing right ¡ª and she was kissing me back in exactly the same spirit, her mouth curious but not afraid. Her lips were warm and smooth and held some faint sweet taste. Peaches, I think.\\n\\n We stopped at the same time and pulled back a little from each other. Her hands were still on my shoulders. Mine were on the sides of her waist, just above her hips. Her face was composed enough, but her eyes were more brilliant than ever, and there were slants of color in her cheeks, rising along the cheekbones.\\n\\n \u0027Oh boy,\u0027 she said. \u0027I really wanted that. Ever since Ki tackled you and you picked her up I\u0027ve wanted it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027John wouldn\u0027t think much of us kissing in public,\u0027 I said. My voice wasn\u0027t quite even, and my heart was racing. Seven seconds, one kiss, and every system in my body was red-lining. \u0027In fact, John wouldn\u0027t think much of us kissing at all. He fancies you, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know, but I fancy you.\u0027 She turned to check on Ki, who was still standing obediently by the tree, watching the juggler. Who might be watching us? Someone who had come over from the TR on a hot summer evening to get ice cream at Frank\u0027s Tas-T-Freeze and enjoy a little music and society on the common? Someone who traded for fresh vegetables and fresh gossip at the Lakeview General? A regular at the All-Purpose Garage? This was insanity, and it stayed insanity no matter how you cut it. I dropped my hands from her waist.\\n\\n \u0027Mattie, they could put our picture next to \"indiscreet\" in the dictionary.\u0027\\n\\n She took her hands off my shoulders and stepped back a pace, but her brilliant eyes never left mine. \u0027I know that. I\u0027m young but not entirely stupid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n She held up a hand to stop me. \u0027Ki goes to bed around nine ¡ª she can\u0027t seem to sleep until it\u0027s mostly dark. I stay up later. Come and visit me, if you want to. You can park around back.\u0027 She smiled a little. It was a sweet smile; it was also incredibly sexy. \u0027Once the moon\u0027s down, that\u0027s an area of discretion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mattie, you\u0027re young enough to be my daughter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe, but I\u0027m not. And sometimes people can be too discreet for their own good.\u0027\\n\\n My body knew so emphatically what it wanted. If we had been in her trailer at that moment it would have been no contest. It was almost no contest anyway. Then something recurred to me, something I\u0027d thought about Devore\u0027s ancestors and my own: the generations didn\u0027t match up. Wasn\u0027t the same thing true here? And I don\u0027t believe that people automatically have a right to what they want, no matter how badly they want it. Not every thirst should be slaked. Some things are just wrong ¡ª I guess that\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to say. But I wasn\u0027t sure this was one of them, and I wanted her, all right. So much. I kept thinking about how her dress had slid when I put my arms around her waist, the warm feel of her skin just beneath. And no, she wasn\u0027t my daughter.\\n\\n \u0027You said your thanks,\u0027 I told her in a dry voice. \u0027And that\u0027s enough. Really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think this is gratitude?\u0027 She voiced a low, tense laugh. \u0027You\u0027re forty, Mike, not eighty. You\u0027re not Harrison Ford, but you\u0027re a good-looking man. Talented and interesting, too. And I like you such an awful lot. I want you to be with me. Do you want me to say please? Fine. Please be with me.\u0027\\n\\n Yes, this was about more than gratitude ¡ª I suppose I\u0027d known that even when I was using the word. I\u0027d known she was wearing white shorts and a halter top when she called on the phone the day I went back to work. Had she also known what I was wearing? Had she dreamed she was in bed with me, the two of us screwing our brains out while the party lights shone and Sara Tidwell played her version of the white nana rhyming game, all that crazy Manderley-sanderley-canderley stuff?. Had Mattie dreamed of telling me to do what she wanted?\\n\\n And there were the fridgeafator people. They were another kind of sharing, an even spookier kind. I hadn\u0027t quite had nerve enough to tell Mattie about mine, but she might know anyway. Down low in her mind. Down below in her mind, where the blue-collar guys moved around in the zone. Her guys and my guys, all part of the same strange labor union. And maybe it wasn\u0027t an issue of morality per se at all. Some thing about it ¡ª about us ¡ª just felt dangerous.\\n\\n And oh so attractive.\\n\\n \u0027I need time to think,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t about what you think. What do you feel for me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So much it scares me.\u0027\\n\\n Before I could say anything else, my ears caught a familiar series of chord-changes. I turned toward the kid with the guitar. He had been working through a repertoire of early Dylan, but now he swung into something chuggy and up-tempo, something that made you want to grin and pat your hands together.\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to go fishin\\n\\n here in my fishin hole?\\n\\n Said do you want to fish some, honey,\\n\\n here in my fishin hole?\\n\\n You want to fish in my pond, baby,\\n\\n you better have a big long pole.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fishin Blues.\u0027 Written by Sara Tidwell, originally performed by Sara and the Red-Top Boys, covered by everyone from Ma Rainey to the Lovin\u0027 Spoonful. The raunchy ones had been her specialty, double-entendre so thin you could read a newspaper through it . . . although reading hadn\u0027t been Sara\u0027s main interest, judging by her lyrics.\\n\\n Before the kid could go on to the next verse, something about how you got to wiggle when you wobble and get that big one way down deep, The Castle Rockers ran off a brass flourish that said \u0027Shut up, everybody, we\u0027re comin atcha.\u0027 The kid quit playing his guitar; the juggler began catching his Indian clubs and dropping them swiftly onto the grass in a line. The Rockers launched themselves into an extremely evil Sousa march, music to commit serial murders by, and Kyra came running back to us.\\n\\n \u0027The jugster\u0027s done. Will you tell me the story, Mike? Hansel and Panzel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Hansel and Gretel,\u0027 I said, \u0027and I\u0027ll be happy to. But let\u0027s go where it\u0027s a little quieter, okay? The band is giving me a headache.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Music hurt your headie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll go by Mattie\u0027s car, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good thought.\u0027\\n\\n Kyra ran ahead to stake out a bench on the edge of the common. Mattie gave me a long warm look, then her hand. I took it. Our fingers folded together as if they had been doing it for years. I thought, I\u0027d like it to be slow, both of us hardly moving at all. At first, anyway. And would I bring my nicest, longest pole? I think you could count on that. And then, afterward, we\u0027d talk. Maybe until we could see the furniture in the first early light. When you\u0027re in bed with someone you love, particularly for the first time, five o\u0027clock seems almost holy.\\n\\n \u0027You need a vacation from your own thoughts,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027I bet most writers do from time to time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s probably true.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish we were home,\u0027 she said, and I couldn\u0027t tell if her fierceness was real or pretend. \u0027I\u0027d kiss you until this whole conversation became irrelevant. And if there were second thoughts, at least you\u0027d be having them in my bed.\u0027\\n\\n I turned my face into the red light of the westering sun. \u0027Here or there, at this hour Ki would still be up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027True,\u0027 she said, sounding uncharacteristically glum. \u0027True.\u0027\\n\\n Kyra reached a bench near the sign reading TOWN COMMON PARKING and climbed up on it, holding the little stuffed dog from Mickey D\u0027s in one hand. I tried to pull my hand away as we approached her and Mattie held it firm. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Mike. At VBS they hold hands with their friends everywhere they go. It\u0027s big people who make it into a big deal.\u0027\\n\\n She stopped, looked at me.\\n\\n \u0027I want you to know something. Maybe it won\u0027t matter to you, but it does to me. There wasn\u0027t anyone before Lance and no one after. If you come to me, you\u0027ll be my second. I\u0027m not going to talk with you about this again, either. Saying please is all right, but I won\u0027t beg.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a pot with tomato plants in it by the trailer steps. I\u0027ll leave a key under it. Don\u0027t think. Just come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not tonight, Mattie. I can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can,\u0027 she replied.\\n\\n \u0027Hurry up, slowpokes!\u0027 Kyra cried, bouncing on the bench.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s the slow one!\u0027 Mattie called back, and poked me in the ribs. Then, in a much lower voice: \u0027You are, too.\u0027 She unwound her hand from mine and ran toward her daughter, her brown legs scissoring below the hem of the white dress.\\n\\n In my version of \u0027Hansel and Gretel\u0027 the witch was named Depravia. Kyra stared at me with huge eyes when I got to the part where Depravia asks Hansel to poke out his finger so she can see how plump he\u0027s getting.\\n\\n \u0027Is it too scary?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Ki shook her head emphatically. I glanced at Mattie to make sure. She nodded and waved a hand for me to go on, so I finished the story. Depravia went into the oven and Gretel found her secret stash of winning lottery tickets. The kids bought a Jet Ski and lived happily ever after on the eastern side of Dark Score Lake. By then The Castle Rockers were slaughtering Gershwin and sunset was nigh. I carried Kyra to Scoutie and strapped her in. I remembered the first time I\u0027d helped put the kid into her car-seat, and the inadvertent press of Mattie\u0027s breast.\\n\\n \u0027I hope there isn\u0027t a bad dream for you in that story,\u0027 I said. Until I heard it coming out of my own mouth, I hadn\u0027t realized how fundamentally awful that one is.\\n\\n \u0027I won\u0027t have bad dreams,\u0027 Kyra said matter-of-factly. \u0027The fridgeafator people will keep them away.\u0027 Then, carefully, reminding herself: \u0027Ree-fridge-a-rator.\u0027 She turned to Mattie. \u0027Show him the crosspatch, Mommy-bommy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Crossword. But thanks, I would\u0027ve forgotten.\u0027 She thumbed open the glove compartment and took out a folded sheet of paper. \u0027It was on the fridge this morning. I copied it down because Ki said you\u0027d know what it meant. She said you do crossword puzzles. Well, she said crosspatches, but I got the idea.\u0027\\n\\n Had I told Kyra that I did crosswords? Almost certainly not. Did it surprise me that she knew? Not at all. I took the sheet of paper, unfolded it, and looked at what was printed there:\\n\\n ninety2\\n\\n \u0027Is it a crosspatch puzzle, Mike?\u0027 Kyra asked.\\n\\n \u0027I guess so ¡ª a very simple one. But if it means something, I don\u0027t know what it is. May I keep this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Mattie said.\\n\\n I walked her around to the driver\u0027s side of the Scout, reaching for her hand again as we went. \u0027Just give me a little time. I know that\u0027s supposed to be the girl\u0027s line, but ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take the time,\u0027 she said. \u0027Just don\u0027t take too much.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to take any, which was just the problem. The sex would be great, I knew that. But after?\\n\\n There might be an after, though. I knew it and she did, too. With Mattie, \u0027after\u0027 was a real possibility. The idea was a little scary, a little wonderful.\\n\\n I kissed the corner of her mouth. She laughed and grabbed me by the earlobe. \u0027You can do better,\u0027 she said, then looked at Ki, who was sitting in her car-seat and gazing at us interestedly. \u0027But I\u0027ll let you off this time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kiss Ki!\u0027 Kyra called, holding out her arms, so I went around and kissed Ki. Driving home, wearing my dark glasses to cut the glare of the setting sun, it occurred to me that maybe I could be Kyra Devore\u0027s father. That seemed almost as attractive to me as going to bed with her mother, which was a measure of how deep I was in. And going deeper, maybe.\\n\\n Deeper still.\\n\\n Sara Laughs seemed very empty after having Mattie in my arms ¡ª a sleeping head without dreams. I checked the letters on the fridge, saw nothing there but the normal scatter, and got a beer. I went out on the deck to drink it while I watched the last of the sunset. I tried to think about the refrigerator people and crosspatches that had appeared on both refrigerators: \u0027go down nineteen\u0027 on Lane Forty-two and \u0027go down ninety-two\u0027 on Wasp Hill Road. Different vectors from the land to the lake? Different spots on The Street? Shit, who knew?\\n\\n I tried to think about John Storrow and how unhappy he was apt to be if he found out there was ¡ª to quote Sara Laughs, who got to the line long before John Mellencamp ¡ª another mule kicking in Mattie Devore\u0027s stall. But mostly what I thought about was holding her for the first time, kissing her for the first time. No human instinct is more powerful than the sex-drive when it is fully aroused, and its awakening images are emotional tattoos that never leave us. For me, it was feeling the soft bare skin of her waist just beneath her dress. The slippery feel of the fabric . . .\\n\\n I turned abruptly and hurried through the house to the north wing, almost running and shedding clothes as I went. I turned the shower on to full cold and stood under it for five minutes, shivering. When I got out I felt a little more like an actual human being and a little less like a twitching bundle of nerve endings. And as I toweled dry, something else recurred to me. At some point I had thought of Jo\u0027s brother Frank, had thought that if anyone besides myself would be able to feel Jo\u0027s presence in Sara Laughs, it would be him. I hadn\u0027t gotten around to inviting him down yet, and now wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to. I had come to feel oddly possessive, almost jealous, about what was happening here. And yet if Jo had been writing something on the quiet, Frank might know. Of course she hadn\u0027t confided in him about the pregnancy, but ¡ª\\n\\n I looked at my watch. Quarter past nine. In the trailer near the intersection of Wasp Hill Road and Route 68, Kyra was probably already asleep . . . and her mother might already have put her extra key under the pot near the steps. I thought of her in the white dress, the swell of her hips just below my hands and the smell of her perfume, then pushed the images away. I couldn\u0027t spend the whole night taking cold showers. Quarter past nine was still early enough to call Frank Arlen.\\n\\n He picked up on the second ring, sounding both happy to hear from me and as if he\u0027d gotten three or four cans further into the six-pack than I had so far done. We passed the usual pleasantries back and forth ¡ª most of my own almost entirely fictional, I was dismayed to find ¡ª and he mentioned that a famous neighbor of mine had kicked the bucket, according to the news. Had I met him? Yes, I said, remembering how Max Devore had run his wheelchair at me. Yes, I\u0027d met him. Frank wanted to know what he was like. That was hard to say, I told him. Poor old guy was stuck in a wheelchair and suffering from emphysema.\\n\\n \u0027Pretty frail, huh?\u0027 Frank asked sympathetically.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I said. \u0027Listen, Frank, I called about Jo. I was out in her studio looking around, and I found my typewriter. Since then I\u0027ve kind of gotten the idea she was writing something. It might have started as a little piece about our house, then widened. The place is named after Sara Tidwell, you know. The blues singer.\u0027\\n\\n A long pause. Then Frank said, \u0027I know.\u0027 His voice sounded heavy, grave.\\n\\n \u0027What else do you know, Frank?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That she was scared. I think she found out something that scared her. I think that mostly because ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n That was when the light finally broke. I probably should have known from Mattie\u0027s description, would have known if I hadn\u0027t been so upset. \u0027You were down here with her, weren\u0027t you? In July of 1994. You went to the softball game, then you went back up The Street to the house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you know that?\u0027 he almost barked.\\n\\n \u0027Someone saw you. A friend of mine.\u0027 I was trying not to sound mad and not succeeding. I was mad, but it was a relieved anger, the kind you feel when your kid comes dragging into the house with a shamefaced grin just as you\u0027re getting ready to call the cops.\\n\\n \u0027I almost told you a day or two before we buried her. We were in that pub, do you remember?\u0027\\n\\n Jack\u0027s Pub, right after Frank had beaten the funeral director down on the price of Jo\u0027s coffin. Sure I remembered. I even remembered the look in his eyes when I\u0027d told him Jo had been pregnant when she died.\\n\\n He must have felt the silence spinning out, because he came back sounding anxious. \u0027Mike, I hope you didn\u0027t get any ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Wrong ideas? I thought maybe she was having an affair, how\u0027s that for a wrong idea? You can call that ignoble if you want, but I had my reasons. There was a lot she wasn\u0027t telling me. What did she tell you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Next to nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you know she quit all her boards and committees? Quit and never said a word to me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027 I didn\u0027t think he was lying. Why would he, at this late date? \u0027Jesus, Mike, if I\u0027d known that ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened the day you came down here? Tell me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was at the printshop in Sanford. Jo called me from . . . I don\u0027t remember, I think a rest area on the turnpike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Between Derry and the TR?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah. She was on her way to Sara Laughs and wanted me to meet her there. She told me to park in the driveway if I got there first, not to go in the house . . . which I could have; I know where you keep the spare key.\u0027\\n\\n Sure he did, in a Sucrets tin under the deck. I had shown him myself. \u0027Did she say why she didn\u0027t want you to go inside?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027ll sound crazy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No it won\u0027t. Believe me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said the house was dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment the words just hung there. Then I asked, \u0027Did you get here first?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And waited outside?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you see or sense anything dangerous?\u0027\\n\\n There was a long pause. At last he said, \u0027There were lots of people out on the lake ¡ª speedboaters, water-skiers, you know how it is ¡ª but all the engine-noise and the laughter seemed to kind of . . . stop dead when it got near the house. Have you ever noticed that it seems quiet there even when it\u0027s not?\u0027\\n\\n Of course I had; Sara seemed to exist in its own zone of silence. \u0027Did it feel dangerous, though?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, almost reluctantly. \u0027Not to me, anyway. But it didn\u0027t feel exactly empty, either. I felt . . . fuck, I felt watched. I sat on one of those railroad-tie steps and waited for my sis. Finally she came. She parked behind my car and hugged me . . . but she never took her eyes off the house. I asked her what she was up to and she said she couldn\u0027t tell me, and that I couldn\u0027t tell you we\u0027d been there. She said something like, \"If he finds out on his own, then it\u0027s meant to be. I\u0027ll have to tell him sooner or later, anyway. But I can\u0027t now, because I need his whole attention. I can\u0027t get that while he\u0027s working.\"\u0027\\n\\n I felt a flush crawl across my skin. \u0027She said that, huh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah. Then she said she had to go in the house and do something. She wanted me to wait outside. She said if she called, I should come on the run. Otherwise I should just stay where I was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She wanted someone there in case she got in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but it had to be someone who wouldn\u0027t ask a lot of questions she didn\u0027t want to answer. That was me. I guess that was always me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She went inside. I sat on the hood of my car, smoking cigarettes. I was still smoking then. And you know, I did start to feel something then that wasn\u0027t right. As if there might be someone in the house who\u0027d been waiting for her, someone who didn\u0027t like her. Maybe someone who wanted to hurt her. Probably I just picked that up from Jo ¡ª the way her nerves seemed all strung up, the way she kept looking over my shoulder at the house even while she was hugging me ¡ª but it seemed like something else. Like a . . . I don\u0027t know . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like a vibe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 he almost shouted. \u0027A vibration. But not a good vibration, like in the Beach Boys song. A bad vibration.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I sat and waited. I only smoked two cigarettes so I don\u0027t guess it could have been longer than twenty minutes or half an hour, but it seemed longer. I kept noticing how the sounds from the lake seemed to make it most of the way up the hill and then just kind of . . . quit. And how there didn\u0027t seem to be any birds, except far off in the distance.\\n\\n \u0027Once, she came out. I heard the deck door bang, and then her footsteps on the stairs over on that side. I called to her, asked if she was okay, and she said fine. She said for me to stay where I was. She sounded a little short of breath, as if she was carrying something or had been doing some chore.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did she go to her studio or down to the lake?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. She was gone another fifteen minutes or so ¡ª time enough for me to smoke another butt ¡ª and then she came back out the front door. She checked to make sure it was locked, and then she came up to me. She looked a lot better. Relieved. The way people look when they do some dirty job they\u0027ve been putting off, finally get it behind them. She suggested we walk down that path she called The Street to the resort that\u0027s down there ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Warrington\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right, right. She said she\u0027d buy me a beer and a sandwich. Which she did, out at the end of this long floating dock.\u0027\\n\\n The Sunset Bar, where I had first glimpsed Rogette.\\n\\n \u0027Then you went to have a look at the softball game.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was Jo\u0027s idea. She had three beers to my one, and she insisted. Said someone was going to hit a longshot homer into the trees, she just knew it.\u0027\\n\\n Now I had a clear picture of the part Mattie had seen and told me about. Whatever Jo had done, it had left her almost giddy with relief. She had ventured into the house, for one thing. Had dared the spirits in order to do her business and survived. She\u0027d had three beers to celebrate and her discretion had slipped . . . not that she had behaved with any great stealth on her previous trips down to the TR. Frank remembered her saying if I found out on my own then it was meant to be ¡ª que ser¨¢, ser¨¢. It wasn\u0027t the attitude of someone hiding an affair, and I realized now that all her behavior suggested a woman keeping a short-term secret. She would have told me when I finished my stupid book, if she had lived. If.\\n\\n \u0027You watched the game for awhile, then went back to the house along The Street.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Did either of you go in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. By the time we got there, her buzz had worn off and I trusted her to drive. She was laughing while we were at the softball game, but she wasn\u0027t laughing by the time we got back to the house. She looked at it and said, \"I\u0027m done with her. I\u0027ll never go through that door again, Frank.\"\u0027\\n\\n My skin first chilled, then prickled.\\n\\n \u0027I asked her what was wrong, what she\u0027d found out. I knew she was writing something, she\u0027d told me that much ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027She told everyone but me,\u0027 I said . . . but without much bitterness. I knew who the man in the brown sportcoat had been, and any bitterness or anger ¡ª anger at Jo, anger at myself ¡ª paled before the relief of that. I hadn\u0027t realized how much that fellow had been on my mind until now.\\n\\n \u0027She must have had her reasons,\u0027 Frank said. \u0027You know that, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she didn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All I know is that it started ¡ª whatever it was ¡ª with her doing research for an article. It was a lark, Jo playing Nancy Drew. I\u0027m pretty sure that at first not telling you was just to keep it a surprise. She read books but mostly she talked to people ¡ª listened to their stories of the old days and teased them into looking for old letters . . . diaries . . . she was good at that part of it, I think. Damned good. You don\u0027t know any of this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said heavily. Jo hadn\u0027t been having an affair, but she could have had one, if she\u0027d wanted. She could have had an. affair with Tom Selleck and been written up in Inside View and I would have gone on tapping away at the keys of my Powerbook, blissfully unaware.\\n\\n \u0027Whatever she found out,\u0027 Frank said, \u0027I think she just stumbled over it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you never told me. Four years and you never told me any of it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was the last time I was with her,\u0027 Frank said, and now he didn\u0027t sound apologetic or embarrassed at all. \u0027And the last thing she asked of me was that I not tell you we\u0027d been to the lake house. She said she\u0027d tell you everything when she was ready, but then she died. After that I didn\u0027t think it mattered. Mike, she was my sister. She was my sister and I promised.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right. I understand.\u0027 And I did ¡ª just not enough. What had Jo discovered? That Normal Auster had drowned his infant son under a handpump? That back around the turn of the century an animal trap had been left in a place where a young Negro boy would be apt to come along and step into it? That another boy, perhaps the incestuous child of Son and Sara Tidwell, had been drowned by his mother in the lake, she maybe laughing that smoke-broken, lunatic laugh as she held him down? You gotta wiggle when you wobble, honey, and hold that young \u0027un way down deep.\\n\\n \u0027If you need me to apologize, Mike, consider it done.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t. Frank, do you remember anything else she might have said that night? Anything at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said she knew how you found the house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said that when it wanted you, it called you.\u0027\\n\\n At first I couldn\u0027t reply, because Frank Arlen had completely demolished one of the assumptions I\u0027d made about my married life ¡ª one of the biggies, one of those that seem so basic you don\u0027t even think about questioning them. Gravity holds you down. Light allows you to see. The compass needle points north. Stuff like that.\\n\\n This assumption was that Jo was the one who had wanted to buy Sara Laughs back when we saw the first real money from my writing career, because Jo was the \u0027house person\u0027 in our marriage, just as I was the \u0027car person.\u0027 Jo was the one who had picked our apartments when apartments were all we could afford, Jo who hung a picture here and asked me to put up a shelf there. Jo was the one who had fallen in love with the Derry house and had finally worn down my resistance to the idea that it was too big, too busy, and too broken to take on. Jo had been the nest-builder.\\n\\n She said that when it wanted you, it called you.\\n\\n And it was probably true. No, I could do better than that, if I was willing to set aside the lazy thinking and selective remembering. It was certainly true. I was the one who had first broached the idea of a place in western Maine. I was the one who collected stacks of real-estate brochures and hauled them home. I\u0027d started buying regional magazines like Down East and always began at the back, where the real-estate ads were. It was I who had first seen a picture of Sara Laughs in a glossy handout called Maine Retreats, and it was I who had made the call first to the agent named in the ad, and then to Marie Hingerman after badgering Marie\u0027s name out of the Realtor.\\n\\n Johanna had also been charmed by Sara Laughs ¡ª I think anyone would have been charmed by it, seeing it for the first time in autumn sunshine with the trees blazing all around it and drifts of colored leaves blowing up The Street ¡ª but it was I who had actively sought the place out.\\n\\n Except that was more lazy thinking and selective remembering. Wasn\u0027t it? Sara had sought me out.\\n\\n Then how could I not have known it until now? And how was I led here in the first place, full of unknowing happy ignorance?\\n\\n The answer to both questions was the same. It was also the answer to the question of how Jo could have discovered something distressing about the house, the lake, maybe the whole TR, and then gotten away with not telling me. I\u0027d been gone, that\u0027s all. I\u0027d been zoning, tranced out, writing one of my stupid little books. I\u0027d been hypnotized by the fantasies going on in my head, and a hypnotized man is easy to lead.\\n\\n \u0027Mike? Are you still there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m here, Frank. But I\u0027ll be goddamned if I know what could have scared her so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She mentioned one other name I remember: Royce Merrill. She said he was the one who remembered the most, because he was so old. And she said, \"I don\u0027t want Mike to talk to him. I\u0027m afraid that old man might let the cat out of the bag and tell him more than he should know.\" Any idea what she meant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well . . . it\u0027s been suggested that a splinter from the old family tree wound up here, but my mother\u0027s people are from Memphis. The Noonans are from Maine, but not from this part.\u0027 Yet I no longer entirely believed this.\\n\\n \u0027Mike, you sound almost sick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m okay. Better than I was, actually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you understand why I didn\u0027t tell you any of this until now? I mean, if I\u0027d known the ideas you were getting . . . if I\u0027d had any clue . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I understand. The ideas didn\u0027t belong in my head to begin with, but once that shit starts to creep in . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027When I got back to Sanford that night and it was over, I guess I thought it was just more of Jo\u0027s \"Oh fuck, there\u0027s a shadow on the moon, nobody go out until tomorrow.\" She was always the superstitious one, you know ¡ª knocking on wood, tossing a pinch of salt over her shoulder if she spilled some, those four-leaf-clover earrings she used to have . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or the way she wouldn\u0027t wear a pullover if she put it on backward by mistake,\u0027 I said. \u0027She claimed doing that would turn around your whole day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well? Doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Frank asked, and I could hear a little smile in his voice.\\n\\n All at once I remembered Jo completely, right down to the small gold flecks in her left eye, and wanted nobody else. Nobody else would do.\\n\\n \u0027She thought there was something bad about the house,\u0027 Frank said. \u0027That much I do know.\u0027\\n\\n I drew a piece of paper to me and jotted Kia on it. \u0027Yes. And by then she may have suspected she was pregnant. She might have been afraid of . . . influences.\u0027 There were influences here, all right. \u0027You think she got most of this from Royce Merrill?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, that was just a name she mentioned. She probably talked to dozens of people. Do you know a guy named Kloster? Gloster? Something like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Skuster,\u0027 I said. Below Kia my pencil was making a series of fat loops that might have been cursive letter l\u0027s or hair ribbons. \u0027Kenny Auster. Was that it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It sounds right. In any case, you know how she was once she really got going on a thing.\u0027\\n\\n Yes. Like a terrier after rats.\\n\\n \u0027Mike? Should I come up there?\u0027\\n\\n No. Now I was sure. Not Harold Oblowski, not Frank, either. There was a process going on in Sara, something as delicate and as organic as rising bread in a warm room. Frank might interrupt that process . . . or be hurt by it.\\n\\n \u0027No, I just wanted to get it cleared up. Besides, I\u0027m writing. It\u0027s hard for me to have people around when I\u0027m writing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you call if I can help?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You bet,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n I hung up the telephone, thumbed through the book, and found a listing for R. MERRILL on the Deep Bay Road. I called the number, listened to it ring a dozen times, then hung up. No newfangled answering machine for Royce. I wondered idly where he was. Ninety-five seemed a little too old to go dancing at the Country Barn in Harrison, especially on a close night like this one.\\n\\n I looked at the paper with Kia written on it. Below the fat l-shapes I wrote Kyra, and remembered how, the first time I\u0027d heard Ki say her name, I\u0027d thought it was \u0027Kia\u0027 she was saying. Below Kyra I wrote Kito, hesitated, then wrote Carla. I put these names in a box. Beside them I jotted Johanna, Bridget, and Jared. The fridgeafator people. Folks who wanted me to go down nineteen and go down ninety-two.\\n\\n \u0027Go down, Moses, you bound for the Promised Land,\u0027 I told the empty house. I looked around. Just me and Bunter and the waggy clock . . . except it wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n When it wanted you, it called you.\\n\\n I got up to get another beer. The fruits and vegetables were in a circle again. In the middle, the letters now spelled:\\n\\n lye stille\\n\\n As on some old tombstones ¡ª God grant she lye stille. I looked at these letters for a long time. Then I remembered the IBM was still out on the deck. I brought it in, plonked it on the dining-room table, and began to work on my current stupid little book. Fifteen minutes and I was lost, only faintly aware of thunder someplace over the lake, only faintly aware of Bunter\u0027s bell shivering from time to time. When I went back to the fridge an hour or so later for another beer and saw that the words in the circle now said\\n\\n ony lye stille\\n\\n I hardly noticed. At that moment I didn\u0027t care if they lay stille or danced the hucklebuck by the light of the silvery moon. John Shackleford had begun to remember his past, and the child whose only friend he, John, had been. Little neglected Ray Garraty.\\n\\n I wrote until midnight came. By then the thunder had faded away but the heat held on, as oppressive as a blanket. I turned off the IBM and went to bed . . . thinking, so far as I can remember, nothing at all ¡ª not even about Mattie, lying in her own bed not so many miles away. The writing had burned off all thoughts of the real world, at least temporarily. I think that, in the end, that\u0027s what it\u0027s for. Good or bad, it passes the time. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-21.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
