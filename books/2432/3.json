{"id":78348,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I never suffered from writer\u0027s block during the ten years of my marriage, and did not suffer it immediately after Johanna\u0027s death. I was in fact so unfamiliar with the condition that it had pretty well set in before I knew anything out of the ordinary was going on. I think this was because in my heart I believed that such conditions only affected \u0027literary\u0027\u0027 types of the sort who are discussed, deconstructed, and sometimes dismissed in the New York Review of Books.\n My writing career and my marriage covered almost exactly the same span. I finished the first draft of my first novel, Being Two, not long after Jo and I became officially engaged (I popped an opal ring on the third finger of her left hand, a hundred and ten bucks at Day\u0027s Jewellers, and quite a bit more than I could afford at the time . . . but Johanna seemed utterly thrilled with it), and I finished my last novel, All the Way from the Top, about a month after she was declared dead. This was the one about the psychotic killer with the love of high places. It was published in the fall of 1995. I have published other novels since then ¡ª a paradox I can explain ¡ª but I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be a Michael Noonan novel on any list in the foreseeable future. I know what writer\u0027s block is now, all right. I know more about it than I ever wanted to.\n When I hesitantly showed Jo the first draft of Being Two, she read it in one evening, curled up in her favorite chair, wearing nothing but panties and a tee-shirt with the Maine black bear on the front, drinking glass after glass of iced tea. I went out to the garage (we were renting a house in Bangor with another couple on as shaky financial ground as we were. . and no, Jo and I weren\u0027t quite married at that point, although as far as I know, that opal ring never left her finger) and puttered aimlessly, feeling like a guy in a New Yorker cartoon one of those about funny fellows in the delivery waiting room. As I remember, I fucked up a so-simple-a-child-can-do-it birdhouse kit and almost cut off the index finger of my left hand. Every twenty minutes or so I\u0027d go back inside and peek at Jo. If she noticed, she gave no sign. I took that as hopeful.\n I was sitting on the back stoop, looking up at the stars and smoking, when she came out, sat down beside me, and put her hand on the back of my neck.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 I said.\n \u0027It\u0027s good,\u0027 she said. \u0027Now why don\u0027t you come inside and do me?\u0027 And before I could answer, the panties she had been wearing dropped in my lap in a little whisper of nylon.\n Afterward, lying in bed and eating oranges (a vice we later outgrew), I asked her: \u0027Good as in publishable?\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she said, \u0027I don\u0027t know anything about the glamorous world of publishing, but I\u0027ve been reading for pleasure all my life ¡ª Curious George was my first love, if you want to know ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t.\u0027 She leaned over and popped an orange segment into my mouth, her breast warm and provocative against my arm. \u0027 ¡ª and I read this with great pleasure. My prediction is that your career as a reporter for the Derry News is never going to survive its rookie stage. I think I\u0027m going to be a novelist\u0027s wife.\u0027\n Her words thrilled me ¡ª actually brought goosebumps out on my arms. No, she didn\u0027t know anything about the glamorous world of publishing, but if she believed, I believed . . . and belief turned out to be the right course. I got an agent through my old creative-writing teacher (who read my novel and damned it with faint praise, seeing its commercial qualities as a kind of heresy, I think), and the agent sold Being Two to Random House, the first publisher to see it.\n Jo was right about my career as a reporter, as well. I spent four months covering flower shows, drag races, and bean suppers at about a hundred a week before my first check from Random House came in ¡ª $27,000, after the agent\u0027s commission had been deducted. I wasn\u0027t in the newsroom long enough to get even that first minor bump in salary, but they had a going-away party for me just the same. At Jack\u0027s Pub, this was, now that I think of it. There was a banner hung over the tables in the back room which said GOOD LUCK MIKE ¡ª WRITE ON! Later, when we got home, Johanna said that if envy was acid, there would have been nothing left of me but my belt-buckle and three teeth.\n Later, in bed with the lights out ¡ª the last orange eaten and the last cigarette shared ¡ª I said, \u0027No one\u0027s ever going to confuse it with Look Homeward, Angel, are they?\u0027 My book, I meant. She knew it, just as she knew I had been fairly depressed by my old creative-writing teacher\u0027s response to Two.\n \u0027You aren\u0027t going to pull a lot of frustrated-artist crap on me, are you?\u0027 she asked, getting up on one elbow. \u0027If you are, I wish you\u0027d tell me now, so I can pick up one of those do-it-yourself divorce kits first thing in the morning.\u0027\n I was amused, but also a little hurt. \u0027Did you see that first press release from Random House?\u0027 I knew she had. \u0027They\u0027re just about calling me V. C. Andrews with a prick, for God\u0027s sake.\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she said, lightly grabbing the object in question, \u0027you do have a prick. As far as what they\u0027re calling you . . . Mike, when I was in third grade, Patty Banning used to call me a booger-hooker. But I wasn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Perception is everything.\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit.\u0027 She was still holding my dick and now gave it a formidable squeeze that hurt a little and felt absolutely wonderful at the same time. That crazy old trouser mouse never really cared what it got in those days, as long as there was a lot of it. \u0027Happiness is everything. Are you happy when you write, Mike?\u0027\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 It was what she knew, anyway.\n \u0027And does your conscience bother you when you write?\u0027\n \u0027When I write, there\u0027s nothing I\u0027d rather do except this,\u0027 I said, and rolled on top of her.\n \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 she said in that prissy little voice that always cracked me up. \u0027There\u0027s a penis between us.\u0027\n And as we made love, I realized a wonderful thing or two: that she had meant it when she said she really liked my book (hell, I\u0027d known she liked it just from the way she sat in the wing chair reading it, with a lock of hair falling over her brow and her bare legs tucked beneath her), and that I didn\u0027t need to be ashamed of what I had written . . . not in her eyes, at least. And one other wonderful thing: her perception, joined with my own to make the true binocular vision nothing but marriage allows, was the only perception that mattered.\n Thank God she was a Maugham fan.\n I was V. C. Andrews with a prick for ten years . . . fourteen, if you add in the post-Johanna years. The first five were with Random; then my agent got a huge offer from Putnam and I jumped.\n You\u0027ve seen my name on a lot of bestseller lists . . . if, that is, your Sunday paper carries a list that goes up to fifteen instead of just listing the top ten. I was never a Clancy, Ludlum, or Grisham, but I moved a fair number of hardcovers (V. C. Andrews never did, Harold Oblowski, my agent, told me once; the lady was pretty much a paperback phenomenon) and once got as high as number five on the Times list . . . that was with my second book, The Red-Shirt Man. Ironically, one of the books that kept me from going higher was Steel Machine, by Thad Beaumont (writing as George Stark). The Beaumonts had a summer place in Castle Rock back in those days, not even fifty miles south of our place on Dark Score Lake. Thad\u0027s dead now. Suicide. I don\u0027t know if it had anything to do with writer\u0027s block or not.\n I stood just outside the magic circle of the mega-bestsellers, but I never minded that. We owned two homes by the time I was thirty-one: the lovely old Edwardian in Derry and, in western Maine, a lakeside log home almost big enough to be called a lodge ¡ª that was Sara Laughs, so called by the locals for nearly a century. And we owned both places free and clear at a time of life when many couples consider themselves lucky just to have fought their way to mortgage approval on a starter home. We were healthy, faithful, and with our fun-bones still fully attached. I wasn\u0027t Thomas Wolfe (not even Tom Wolfe or Tobias Wolff), but I was being paid to do what I loved, and there\u0027s no gig on earth better than that; it\u0027s like a license to steal.\n I was what midlist fiction used to be in the forties: critically ignored, genre-oriented (in my case the genre was Lovely Young Woman on Her Own Meets Fascinating Stranger), but well compensated and with the kind of shabby acceptance accorded to state-sanctioned whorehouses in Nevada, the feeling seeming to be that some outlet for the baser instincts should be provided and someone had to do That Sort of Thing. I did That Sort of Thing enthusiastically (and sometimes with Jo\u0027s enthusiastic connivance, if I came to a particularly problematic plot crossroads), and at some point around the time of George Bush\u0027s election, our accountant told us we were millionaires.\n We weren\u0027t rich enough to own a jet (Grisham) or a pro football team (Clancy), but by the standards of Derry, Maine, we were quite rolling in it. We made love thousands of times, saw thousands of movies, read thousands of books (Jo storing hers under her side of the bed at the end of the day, more often than not). And perhaps the greatest blessing was that we never knew how short the time was.\n More than once I wondered if breaking the ritual is what led to the writer\u0027s block. In the daytime, I could dismiss this as supernatural twaddle but at night that was harder to do. At night your thoughts have an unpleasant way of slipping their collars and running free. And if you\u0027ve spent most of your adult life making fictions, I\u0027m sure those collars are even looser and the dogs less eager to wear them. Was it Shaw or Oscar Wilde who said a writer was a man who had taught his mind to misbehave?\n And is it really so far-fetched to think that breaking the ritual might have played a part in my sudden and unexpected (unexpected by me, at least) silence? When you make your daily bread in the land of make-believe, the line between what is and what seems to be is much finer. Painters sometimes refuse to paint without wearing a certain hat, and baseball players who are hitting well won\u0027t change their socks.\n The ritual started with the second book, which was the only one I remember being nervous about ¡ª I suppose I\u0027d absorbed a fair amount of that sophomore-jinx stuff; the idea that one hit might only be a fluke. I remember an American Lit lecturer\u0027s once saying that of modern American writers, only Harper Lee had found a foolproof way of avoiding the second-book blues.\n When I reached the end of The Red-Shirt Man, I stopped just short of finishing. The Edwardian on Benton Street in Derry was still two years in the future at that point, but we had purchased Sara Laughs, the place on Dark Score (not anywhere near as furnished as it later became, and Jo\u0027s studio not yet built, but nice), and that\u0027s where we were.\n I pushed back from my typewriter ¡ª I was still clinging to my old IBM Selectric in those days ¡ª and went into the kitchen. It was mid-September, most of the summer people were gone, and the crying of the loons on the lake sounded inexpressibly lovely. The sun was going down, and the lake itself had become a still and heatless plate of fire. This is one of the most vivid memories I have, so clear I sometimes feel I could step right into it and live it all again. What things, if any, would I do differently? I sometimes wonder about that.\n Early that evening I had put a bottle of Taittinger and two flutes in the fridge. Now I took them out, put them on a tin tray that was usually employed to transport pitchers of iced tea or Kool-Aid from the kitchen to the deck, and carried it before me into the living room.\n Johanna was deep in her ratty old easy chair, reading a book (not Maugham that night but William Denbrough, one of her contemporary favorites). \u0027Ooo,\u0027 she said, looking up and marking her place. \u0027Champagne, what\u0027s the occasion?\u0027 As if, you understand, she didn\u0027t know.\n \u0027I\u0027m done,\u0027 I said. \u0027Mon livre est tout fini.\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she said, smiling and taking one of the flutes as I bent down to her with the tray, \u0027then that\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n I realize now that the essence of the ritual ¡ª the part that was alive and powerful, like the one true magic word in a mouthful of gibberish ¡ª was that phrase. We almost always had champagne, and she almost always came into the office with me afterward for the other thing, but not always.\n Once, five years or so before she died, she was in Ireland, vacationing with a girlfriend, when I finished a book. I drank the champagne by myself that time, and entered the last line by myself as well (by then I was using a Macintosh which did a billion different things and which I used for only one) and never lost a minute\u0027s sleep over it. But I called her at the inn where she and her friend Bryn were staying; I told her I had finished, and listened as she said the words I\u0027d called to hear ¡ª words that slipped into an Irish telephone line, travelled to a microwave transmitter, rose like a prayer to some satellite, and then came back down to my ear: \u0027Well, then that\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n This custom began, as I say, after the second book. When we\u0027d each had a glass of champagne and a refill, I took her into the office, where a single sheet of paper still stuck out of my forest-green Selectric. On the lake, one last loon cried down dark, that call that always sounds to me like something rusty turning slowly in the wind. \u0027I thought you said you were done,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Everything but the last line,\u0027 I said. \u0027The book, such as it is, is dedicated to you, and I want you to put down the last bit.\u0027\n She didn\u0027t laugh or protest or get gushy, just looked at me to see if I really meant it. I nodded that I did, and she sat in my chair. She had been swimming earlier, and her hair was pulled back and threaded through a white elastic thing. It was wet, and two shades darker red than usual. I touched it. It was like touching damp silk.\n \u0027Paragraph indent?\u0027 she asked, as seriously as a girl from the steno pool about to take dictation from the big boss.\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said, \u0027this continues.\u0027 And then I spoke the line I\u0027d been holding in my head ever since I got up to pour the champagne.\u0027\"He slipped the chain over her head, and then the two of them walked down the steps to where the car was parked.\u0027\u0027\u0027\n She typed it, then looked around and up at me expectantly. \u0027That\u0027s it,\u0027 I said. \u0027You can write The End, I guess.\u0027\n Jo hit the RETURN button twice, centered the carriage, and typed The End under the last line of prose, the IBM\u0027s Courier type ball (my favorite) spinning out the letters in their obedient dance.\n \u0027What\u0027s the chain he slips over her head?\u0027 she asked me.\n \u0027You\u0027ll have to read the book to find out.\u0027\n With her sitting in my desk chair and me standing beside her, she was in perfect position to put her face where she did. When she spoke, her lips moved against the most sensitive part of me. There were a pair of cotton shorts between us and that was all.\n \u0027Ve haff vays off making you talk,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I\u0027ll just bet you do,\u0027 I said.\n I at least made a stab at the ritual on the day I finished All the Way from the Top. It felt hollow, form from which the magical substance had departed, but I\u0027d expected that. I didn\u0027t do it out of superstition but out of respect and love. A kind of memorial, if you will. Or, if you will, Johanna\u0027s real funeral service, finally taking place a month after she was in the ground.\n It was the last third of September, and still hot ¡ª the hottest late summer I can remember. All during that final sad push on the book, I kept thinking how much I missed her . . . but that never slowed me down. And here\u0027s something else: hot as it was in Derry, so hot I usually worked in nothing but a pair of boxer shorts, I never once thought of going to our place at the lake. It was as if my memory of Sara Laughs had been entirely wiped from my mind. Perhaps that was because by the time I finished Top, that truth was finally sinking in.\n She wasn\u0027t just in Ireland this time. My office at the lake is tiny, but has a view. The office in Derry is long, book-lined, and windowless. On this particular evening, the overhead fans ¡ª there are three of them ¡ª were on and paddling at the soupy air. I came in dressed in shorts, a tee-shirt, and rubber thong sandals, carrying a tin Coke tray with the bottle of champagne and the two chilled glasses on it. At the far end of that railroad-car room, under an eave so steep I\u0027d had to almost crouch so as not to bang my head when I got up (over the years I\u0027d also had to withstand Jo\u0027s protests that I\u0027d picked the absolute worst place in the room for a workstation), the screen of my Macintosh glowed with words.\n I thought I was probably inviting another storm of grief ¡ª -maybe the worst storm ¡ª but I went ahead anyway . . . and our emotions always surprise us, don\u0027t they? There was no weeping and wailing that night; I guess all that was out of my system. Instead there was a deep and wretched sense of loss ¡ª the empty chair where she used to like to sit and read, the empty table where she would always set her glass too close to the edge.\n I poured a glass of champagne, let the foam settle, then picked it up. \u0027I\u0027m done, Jo,\u0027 I said as I sat there beneath the paddling fans. \u0027So that\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n There was no response. In light of all that came later, I think that\u0027s worth repeating ¡ª there was no response. I didn\u0027t sense, as I later did, that I was not alone in a room which appeared empty.\n I drank the champagne, put the glass back on the Coke tray, then filled the other one. I took it over to the Mac and sat down where Johanna would have been sitting, if not for everyone\u0027s favorite loving God. No weeping and wailing, but my eyes prickled with tears. The words on the screen were these:\n today wasn\u0027t so bad, she supposed. She crossed the grass to her car, and laughed when she saw the white square of paper under the windshield. Cam Delancey, who refused to be discouraged, or to take no for an answer, had invited her to another of his Thursday-night wine-tasting parties. She took the paper, started to tear it up, then changed her mind and stuck it in the hip pocket of her jeans, instead.\n \u0027No paragraph indent,\u0027 I said, \u0027this continues.\u0027 Then I keyboarded the line I\u0027d been holding in my head ever since I got up to get the champagne.\n There was a whole world out there; Cam Delancey\u0027s wine-tasting was as good a place to start as any.\n I stopped, looking at the little flashing cursor. The tears were still prickling at the corners of my eyes, but I repeat that there were no cold drafts around my ankles, no spectral fingers at the nape of my neck. I hit RETURN twice. I clicked on CENTER. I typed The End below the last line of prose, and then I toasted the screen with what should have been Jo\u0027s glass of champagne.\n \u0027Here\u0027s to you, babe,\u0027 I said. \u0027I wish you were here. I miss you like hell.\u0027 My voice wavered a little on that last word, but didn\u0027t break. I drank the Taittinger, saved my final line of copy, transferred the whole works to floppy disks, then backed them up. And except for notes, grocery lists, and checks, that was the last writing I did for four years. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-3.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: \n Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
