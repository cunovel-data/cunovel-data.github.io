{"id":78369,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Inspiration isn\u0027t always a matter of ghosts moving magnets around on refrigerator doors, and on Tuesday morning I had a flash that was a beaut. It came while I was shaving and thinking about nothing more than remembering the beer for the party. And like the best inspirations, it came out of nowhere at all.\n I hurried into the living room, not quite running, wiping the shaving cream off my face with a towel as I went. I glanced briefly at the Tough Stuff crossword collection lying on top of my manuscript. That had been where I\u0027d gone first in an effort to decipher \u0027go down nineteen\u0027 and \u0027go down ninety-two.\u0027 Not an unreasonable starting-point, but what did Tough Stuff have to do with TR-90? I had purchased the book at Mr. Paperback in Derry, and of the thirty or so puzzles I\u0027d completed, I\u0027d done all but half a dozen in Derry. TR ghosts could hardly be expected to show an interest in my Derry crossword collection. The telephone book, on the other hand ¡ª\n I snatched it off the dining-room table. Although it covered the whole southern part of Castle County ¡ª Motton, Harlow, and Kashwakamak as well as the TR ¡ª it was pretty thin. The first thing I did was check the white pages to see if there were at least ninety-two. There were. The Y\u0027s and Z\u0027s finished up on page ninety-seven.\n This was the answer. Had to be.\n \u0027I got it, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 I asked Bunter. \u0027This is it.\u0027\n Nothing. Not even a tinkle from the bell.\n \u0027Fuck you ¡ª what does a stuffed moosehead know about a telephone book?\u0027\n Go down nineteen. I turned to page nineteen of the telephone book, where the letter F was prominently showcased. I began to slip my finger down the first column and as it went, my excitement faded. The nineteenth name on page nineteen was Harold Failles. It meant nothing to me. There were also Feltons and Fenners, a Filkersham and several Finneys, half a dozen Flahertys and more Fosses than you could shake a stick at. The last name on page nineteen was Framingham. It also meant nothing to me, but ¡ª\n Framingham, Kenneth P.\n I stared at that for a moment. A realization began to dawn. It had nothing to do with the refrigerator messages.\n You\u0027re not seeing what you think you\u0027re seeing, I thought. This is like when you buy a blue Buick ¡ª\n \u0027You see blue Buicks everywhere,\u0027 I said. \u0027Practically got to kick em out of your way. Yeah, that\u0027s it.\u0027 But my hands were shaking as I turned to page ninety-two.\n Here were the T\u0027s of southern Castle County, along with a few U\u0027s like Alton Ubeck and Catherine Udell just to round things out. I didn\u0027t bother checking the ninety-second entry on the page; the phone book wasn\u0027t the key to the magnetic crosspatches after all. It did, however, suggest something enormous. I closed the book, just held it in my hands for a moment (happy folks with blueberry rakes on the front cover), then opened it at random, this time to the M\u0027s. And once you knew what you were looking for, it jumped right out at you.\n All those K\u0027s.\n Oh, there were Stevens and Johns and Marthas; there was Meserve, G., and Messier, V., and Jayhouse, T. And yet, again and again, I saw the initial K where people had exercised their right not to list their first name in the book. There were at least twenty K-initials on page fifty alone, and another dozen C-initials. As for the actual names themselves . . .\n There were twelve Kenneths on this random page in the M-section, including three Kenneth Moores and two Kenneth Munters. There were four Catherines and two Katherines. There were a Casey, a Kiana, and a Kiefer.\n \u0027Holy Christ, it\u0027s like fallout,\u0027 I whispered.\n I thumbed through the book, not able to believe what I was seeing and seeing it anyway. Kenneths, Katherines, and Keiths were everywhere. I also saw Kimberly, Kim, and Kym. There were Cammie, Kia (yes, and we had thought ourselves so original), Kiah, Kendra, Kaela, Keil, and Kyle. Kirby and Kirk. There was a woman named Kissy Bowden, and a man named Kito Rennie ¡ª Kito, the same name as one of Kyra\u0027s fridgeafator people. And everywhere, outnumbering such usually common initials as S and T and E, were those K\u0027s. My eyes danced with them.\n I turned to look at the clock ¡ª didn\u0027t want to stand John Storrow up at the airport, Christ no ¡ª and there was no clock there. Of course not. Old Krazy Kat had popped his peepers during a psychic event. I gave a loud, braying laugh that scared me a little ¡ª it wasn\u0027t particularly sane.\n \u0027Get hold of yourself, Mike,\u0027 I said. \u0027Take a deep breath, son.\u0027\n I took the breath. Held it. Let it out. Checked the digital readout on the microwave. Quarter past eight. Plenty of time for John. I turned back to the telephone book and began to riffle rapidly through it. I\u0027d had a second inspiration ¡ª not a megawatt blast like the first one, but a lot more accurate, it turned out.\n Western Maine is a relatively isolated area ¡ª it\u0027s a little like the hill country of the border South ¡ª but there has always been at least some inflow of folks from away (\u0027flatlanders\u0027 is the term the locals use when they are feeling contemptuous), and in the last quarter of the century it has become a popular area for active seniors who want to fish and ski their way through retirement. The phone book goes a long way toward separating the newbies from the long-time residents. Babickis, Parettis, O\u0027Quindlans, Donahues, Smolnacks, Dvoraks, Blindermeyers ¡ª all from away. All flatlanders. Jalberts, Meserves, Pillsburys, Spruces, Therriaults, Perraults, Stanchfields, Starbirds, Dubays ¡ª all from Castle County. You see what I\u0027m saying, don\u0027t you? When you see a whole column of Bowies on page twelve, you know that those folks have been around long enough to relax and really spread those Bowie genes.\n There were a few K-initials and K-names among the Parettis and the Smolnacks, but only a few. The heavy concentrations were all attached to families that had been here long enough to absorb the atmosphere. To breathe the fallout. Except it wasn\u0027t radiation, exactly, it ¡ª\n I suddenly imagined a black headstone taller than the tallest tree on the lake, a monolith which cast its shadow over half of Castle County. This picture was so clear and so terrible that I covered my eyes, dropping the phone book on the table. I backed away from it, shuddering. Hiding my eyes actually seemed to enhance the image further: a grave-marker so enormous it blotted out the sun; TR-90 lay at its foot like a funeral bouquet. Sara Tidwell\u0027s son had drowned in Dark Score Lake . . . or been drowned in it. But she had marked his passing. Memorialized it. I wondered if anyone else in town had ever noticed what I just had. I didn\u0027t suppose it was all that likely; when you open a telephone book you\u0027re looking for a specific name in most cases, not reading whole pages line by line. I wondered if Jo had noticed ¡ª if she\u0027d known that almost every longtime family in this part of the world had, in one way or another, named at least one child after Sara Tidwell\u0027s dead son.\n Jo wasn\u0027t stupid. I thought she probably had.\n I returned to the bathroom, relathered, started again from scratch. When I finished, I went back to the phone and picked it up. I poked in three numbers, then stopped, looking out at the lake. Mattie and Ki were up and in the kitchen, both of them wearing aprons, both of them in a fine froth of excitement. There was going to be a party! They would wear pretty new summer clothes, and there would be music from Mattie\u0027s boombox CD player! Ki was helping Mattie make biscuits for strewberry snortcake, and while the biscuits were baking they would make salads. If I called Mattie up and said Pack a couple of bags, you and Ki are going to spend a week at Disney World, Mattie would assume I was joking, then tell me to hurry up and finish getting dressed so I\u0027d be at the airport when John\u0027s plane landed. If I pressed, she\u0027d remind me that Lindy had offered her her old job back, but the offer would close in a hurry if Mattie didn\u0027t show up promptly at two P.M. on Friday. If I continued to press, she would just say no.\n Because I wasn\u0027t the only one in the zone, was I? I wasn\u0027t the only one who was really feeling it.\n I returned the phone to its recharging cradle, then went back into the north bedroom. By the time I\u0027d finished dressing, my fresh shirt was already feeling wilted under the arms; it was as hot that morning as it had been for the last week, maybe even hotter. But I\u0027d be in plenty of time to meet the plane. I had never felt less like partying, but I\u0027d be there. Mikey on the spot, that was me. Mikey on the goddam spot.\n John hadn\u0027t given me his flight number, but at Castle County Airport, such niceties are hardly necessary. This bustling hub of transport consists of three hangars and a terminal which used to be a Flying A gas station ¡ª when the light\u0027s strong on the little building\u0027s rusty north side, you can still see the shape of that winged A. There\u0027s one runway. Security is provided by Lassie, Breck Pellerin\u0027s ancient collie, who spends her days crashed out on the linoleum floor, cocking an ear at the ceiling whenever a plane lands or takes off.\n I popped my head into Pellerin\u0027s office and asked him if the ten from Boston was on time. He said it \u0027twas, although he hoped the paa\u0027ty I was meetin planned to either fly back out before mid-afternoon or stay the night. Bad weather was comin in, good gorry, yes. What Breck Pellerin referred to as \u0027lectrical weather. I knew exactly what he meant, because in my nervous system that electricity already seemed to have arrived.\n I went out to the runway side of the terminal and sat on a bench advertising Cormier\u0027s Market (FLY INTO OUR DELI FOR THE BEST MEATS IN MAINE). The sun was a silver button stuck on the eastern slope of a hot white sky. Headache weather, my mother would have called it, but the weather was due to change. I would hold onto the hope of that change as best I could.\n At ten past ten I heard a wasp-whine from the south. At quarter past, some sort of twin-engine plane dropped out of the murk, flopped onto the runway, and taxied toward the terminal. There were only four passengers, and John Storrow was the first one off. I grinned when I saw him. I had to grin. He was wearing a black tee-shirt with WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS printed across the front and a pair of khaki shorts which displayed a perfect set of city shins: white and bony. He was trying to manage both a Styrofoam cooler and a briefcase. I grabbed the cooler maybe four seconds before he dropped it, and tucked it under my arm.\n \u0027Mike!\u0027 he cried, lifting one hand palm out.\n \u0027John!\u0027 I returned in much the same spirit (evoe is the word that comes immediately to the crossword aficionado\u0027s mind), and slapped him five. His homely-handsome face split in a grin, and I felt a little stab of guilt. Mattie had expressed no preference for John ¡ª quite the opposite, in fact ¡ª and he really hadn\u0027t solved any of her problems; Devore had done that by topping himself before John had so much as a chance to get started on her behalf. Yet still I felt that nasty little poke.\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let\u0027s get out of this heat. You have air conditioning in your car, I presume?\u0027\n \u0027Absolutely.\u0027\n \u0027What about a cassette player? You got one of those? If you do, I\u0027ll play you something that\u0027ll make you chortle.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard that word actually used in conversation, John.\u0027\n The grin shone out again, and I noticed what a lot of freckles he had. Sheriff Andy\u0027s boy Opie grows up to serve at the bar. \u0027I\u0027m a lawyer. I use words in conversation that haven\u0027t even been invented yet. You have a tape-player?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I do.\u0027 I hefted the cooler. \u0027Steaks?\u0027\n \u0027You bet. Peter Luger\u0027s. They\u0027re ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027 ¡ª the best in the world. You told me.\u0027\n As we went into the terminal, someone said, \u0027Michael?\u0027\n It was Romeo Bissonette, the lawyer who had chaperoned me through my deposition. In one hand he had a box wrapped in blue paper and tied with a white ribbon. Beside him, just rising from one of the lumpy chairs, was a tall guy with a fringe of gray hair. He was wearing a brown suit, a blue shirt, and a string tie with a golf-club on the clasp. He looked more like a farmer on auction day than the sort of guy who\u0027d be a scream when you got a drink or two into him, but I had no doubt this was the private detective. He stepped over the comatose collie and shook hands with me. \u0027George Kennedy, Mr. Noonan. I\u0027m pleased to meet you. My wife has read every single book you ever wrote.\u0027\n \u0027Well thank her for me.\u0027\n \u0027I will. I have one in the car ¡ª a hardcover . . . \u0027 He looked shy, as so many people do when they get right to the point of asking. \u0027I wonder if you\u0027d sign it for her at some point.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d be delighted to,\u0027 I said. \u0027Right away\u0027s best, then I won\u0027t forget.\u0027 I turned to Romeo. \u0027Good to see you, Romeo.\u0027\n \u0027Make it Rommie,\u0027 he said. \u0027Good to see you, too.\u0027 He held out the box. \u0027George and I clubbed together on this. We thought you deserved something nice for helping a damsel in distress.\u0027\n Kennedy now did look like a man who might be fun after a few drinks. The kind who might just take a notion to hop onto the nearest table, turn a tablecloth into a kilt, and dance. I looked at John, who gave the kind of shrug that means hey, don\u0027t ask me.\n I pulled off the satin bow, slipped my finger under the Scotch tape holding the paper, then looked up. I caught Rommie Bissonette in the act of elbowing Kennedy. Now they were both grinning.\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing in here that\u0027s going to jump out at me and go booga-booga, is there, guys?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027Absolutely not,\u0027 Rommie said, but his grin widened.\n Well, I can be as good a sport as the next guy. I guess. I unwrapped the package, opened the plain white box inside, revealed a square pad of cotton, lifted it out. I had been smiling all through this, but now I felt the smile curl up and die on my mouth. Something went twisting up my spine as well, and I think I came very close to dropping the box.\n It was the oxygen mask Devore had had on his lap when he met me on The Street, the one he\u0027d snorted from occasionally as he and Rogette paced me, trying to keep me out deep enough to drown. Rommie Bissonette and George Kennedy had brought it to me like the scalp of a dead enemy and I was supposed to think it was funny ¡ª\n \u0027Mike?\u0027 Rommie asked anxiously. \u0027Mike, are you okay? It was just a joke ¡ª \u0027\n I blinked and saw it wasn\u0027t an oxygen mask at all ¡ª how in God\u0027s name could I have been so stupid? For one thing, it was bigger than Devore\u0027s mask; for another, it was made of opaque rather than clear plastic. It was ¡ª\n I gave a tentative chuckle. Rommie Bissonette looked tremendously relieved. So did Kennedy. John only looked puzzled.\n \u0027Funny,\u0027 I said. \u0027Like a rubber crutch.\u0027 I pulled out the little mike from inside the mask and let it dangle. It swung back and forth on its wire, reminding me of the waggy clock\u0027s tail.\n \u0027What the hell is it?\u0027 John asked.\n \u0027Park Avenue lawyer,\u0027 Rommie said to George, broadening his accent so it came out Paa-aak Avenew lawyah. \u0027Ain\u0027t nevah seen one of these, have ya, chummy? Nossir, coss not.\u0027 Then he reverted to normal-speak, which was sort of a relief. I\u0027ve lived in Maine my whole life, and for me the amusement value of burlesque Yankee accents has worn pretty thin. \u0027It\u0027s a Stenomask. The stenog keeping the record at Mike\u0027s depo was wearing one. Mike kept looking at him ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027It freaked me out,\u0027 I said. \u0027Old guy sitting in the corner and mumbling into the Mask of Zorro.\u0027\n \u0027Gerry Bliss freaks a lot of people out,\u0027 Kennedy said. He spoke in a low rumble. \u0027He\u0027s the last one around here who wears em. He\u0027s got ten or eleven left in his mudroom. I know, because I bought that one from him.\u0027\n \u0027I hope he stuck it to you,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027I thought it would make a nice memento,\u0027 Rommie said, \u0027but for a second there I thought I\u0027d given you the box with the severed hand in it ¡ª I hate it when I mix up my gift-boxes like that. What\u0027s the deal?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s been a long hot July,\u0027 I said. \u0027Put it down to that.\u0027 I hung the Stenomask\u0027s strap over one finger, dangling it that way.\n \u0027Mattie said to be there by eleven,\u0027 John told us. \u0027We\u0027re going to drink beer and throw the Frisbee around.\u0027\n \u0027I can do both of those things quite well,\u0027 George Kennedy said.\n Outside in the tiny parking lot George went to a dusty Altima, rummaged in the back, and came out with a battered copy of The Red-Shirt Man. \u0027Frieda made me bring this one. She has the newer ones, but this is her favorite. Sorry about how it looks ¡ª she\u0027s read it about six times.\u0027\n II \u0027It\u0027s my favorite, too,\u0027 I said, which was true. \u0027And I like to see a book with mileage.\u0027 That was also true. I opened the book, looked approvingly at a smear of long-dried chocolate on the flyleaf, and then wrote: For Frieda Kennedy, whose husband was there to lend a hand. Thanks for sharing him, and thanks For reading, Mike Noonan.\n That was a long inscription for me ¡ª usually I just stick to Best wishes or Good luck, but I wanted to make up for the curdled expression they had seen on my face when I opened their innocent little gag present. While I was scribbling, George asked me if I was working on a new novel.\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027Batteries currently on recharge.\u0027 I handed the book back.\n \u0027Frieda won\u0027t like that.\u0027\n \u0027No. But there\u0027s always Red-Shirt.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll follow you,\u0027 Rommie said, and a rumble came from deep in the west. It was no louder than the thunder which had rumbled on and off for the last week, but this wasn\u0027t dry thunder. We all knew it, and we all looked in that direction.\n \u0027Think we\u0027ll get a chance to eat before it storms?\u0027 George asked me.\n \u0027Yeah. Just about barely.\u0027\n I drove to the gate of the parking lot and glanced right to check for traffic. When I did, I saw John looking at me thoughtfully.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Mattie said you were writing, that\u0027s all. Book go tits-up on you or something?\u0027\n My Childhood Friend was just as lively as ever, in fact . . . but it would never be finished. I knew that this morning as well as I knew there was rain on the way. The boys in the basement had for some reason decided to take it back. Asking why might not be such a good idea ¡ª the answers might be unpleasant.\n \u0027Something. I\u0027m not sure just what.\u0027 I pulled out onto the highway, checked behind me, and saw Rommie and George following in George\u0027s little Altima. America has become a country full of big men in little cars. \u0027What do you want me to listen to? If it\u0027s home karaoke, I pass. The last thing on earth I want to hear is you singing \"Bubba Shot the Jukebox Last Night.\"\u0027\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s better than that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Miles better.\u0027\n He opened his briefcase, rooted through it, and came out with a plastic cassette box. The tape inside was marked 7-20-98 ¡ª yesterday. \u0027I love this,\u0027 he said. He leaned forward, turned on the radio, then popped the cassette into the player.\n I was hoping I\u0027d already had my quota of nasty surprises for the morning, but I was wrong.\n \u0027Sorry, I just had to get rid of another call,\u0027 John said from my Chevy\u0027s speakers in his smoothest, most lawyerly voice. I\u0027d have bet a million dollars that his bony shins hadn\u0027t been showing when this tape was made.\n There was a laugh, both smoky and grating. My stomach seized up at the sound of it. I remembered seeing her for the first time standing outside The Sunset Bar, wearing black shorts over a black tank-style swimsuit. Standing there and looking like a refugee from crash-diet hell.\n \u0027You mean you had to turn on your tape-recorder,\u0027 she said, and now I remembered how the water had seemed to change color when she nailed me that really good one in the back of the head. From bright orange to dark scarlet it had gone. And then I\u0027d started drinking the lake. \u0027That\u0027s okay. Tape anything you want.\u0027\n John reached out suddenly and ejected the cassette. \u0027You don\u0027t need to hear this,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s not substantive. I thought you\u0027d get a kick out of her blather, but . . . man, you look terrible. Do you want me to drive? You\u0027re white as a fucking sheet.\u0027\n \u0027I can drive,\u0027 I said. \u0027Go on, play it. Afterward I\u0027ll tell you about a little adventure I had Friday night . . . but you\u0027re going to keep it to yourself. They don\u0027t have to know\u0027 ¡ª I jerked my thumb over my shoulder at the Altima ¡ª \u0027and Mattie doesn\u0027t have to know. Especially Mattie.\u0027\n He reached for the tape, then hesitated. \u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah. It was just hearing her again out of the blue like that. The quality of her voice. Christ, the reproduction is good.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing but the best for Avery, McLain, and Bernstein. We have very strict protocols about what we can tape, by the way. If you were wondering.\u0027\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t. I imagine none of it\u0027s admissible in litigation anyway, is it?\u0027\n \u0027In certain rare cases a judge might let a tape in, but that\u0027s not why we do it. A tape like this saved a man\u0027s life four years ago, right around the time I joined the firm. That guy is now in the Witness Protection Program.\u0027\n \u0027Play it.\u0027\n He leaned forward and pushed the button.\n John: \u0027How is the desert, Ms. Whitmore?\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Hot.\u0027\n John: \u0027Arrangements progressing nicely? I know how difficult times like this can ¡ª \u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027You know very little, counsellor, take it from me. Can we cut the crap?\u0027\n John: \u0027Consider it cut.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Have you conveyed the conditions of Mr. Devore\u0027s will to his daughter-in-law?\u0027\n John: \u0027Yes ma\u0027am.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Her response?\u0027\n John: \u0027I have none to give you now. I may have after Mr. Devore\u0027s will has been probated. But surely you know that such codicils are rarely if ever accepted by the courts.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Well, if that little lady moves out of town, we\u0027ll see, won\u0027t we?\u0027\n John: \u0027I suppose we will.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027When is the victory party?\u0027\n John: \u0027Excuse me?\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Oh please. I have sixty different appointments today, plus a boss to bury tomorrow. You\u0027re going up there to celebrate with her and her daughter, aren\u0027t you? Did you know she\u0027s invited the writer? Her fuck-buddy?\u0027\n John turned to me gleefully. \u0027Do you hear how pissed she sounds? She\u0027s trying to hide it, but she can\u0027t. It\u0027s eating her up inside!\u0027\n I barely heard him. I was in the zone with what she was saying\n (the writer her fuck-buddy)\n and what was under what she was saying. Some quality beneath the words. We just want to see how long you can swim, she had called out to me.\n John: \u0027I hardly think what I or Mattie\u0027s friends do is any of your business, Ms Whitmore. May I respectfully suggest that you party with your friends and let Mattie Devore party with h ¡ª\n Whitmore: \u0027Give him a message.\u0027\n Me. She was talking about me. Then I realized it was even more personal than that ¡ª she was talking to me. Her body might be on the other side of the country, but her voice and spiteful spirit were right here in the car with us.\n And Max Devore\u0027s will. Not the meaningless shit his lawyers had put down on paper but his will. The old bastard was as dead as Damocles, but yes, he was definitely still seeking custody.\n John: \u0027Give who a message, Ms. Whitmore?\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027Tell him he never answered Mr. Devore\u0027s question.\u0027\n John: \u0027What question is that?\u0027\n Does her cunt suck?\n Whitmore: \u0027Ask him. He\u0027ll know.\u0027\n John: \u0027If you mean Mike Noonan, you can ask him yourself. You\u0027ll see him in Castle County Probate Court this fall.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027I hardly think so. Mr. Devore\u0027s will was made and witnessed out here.\u0027\n John: \u0027Nevertheless, it will be probated in Maine, where he died. My heart is set on it. And when you leave Castle County the next time, Rogette, you will do so with your education in matters of the law considerably broadened.\u0027\n For the first time she sounded angry, her voice rising to a reedy caw.\n Whitmore: \u0027If you think ¡ª \u0027\n John: \u0027I don\u0027t think. I know. Goodbye, Ms. Whitmore.\u0027\n Whitmore: \u0027You might do well to stay away from ¡ª \u0027\n There was a click, the hum of an open line, then a robot voice saying \u0027Nine-forty A.M. . . . Eastern Daylight . . . July . . . twentieth.\u0027 John punched EJECT, collected his tape, and stored it back in his briefcase.\n \u0027I hung up on her.\u0027 He sounded like a man telling you about his first skydive. \u0027I actually did. She was mad, wasn\u0027t she? Wouldn\u0027t you say she was seriously pissed?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027 It was what he wanted to hear but not what I really believed. Pissed, yes. Seriously pissed? Maybe not. Because Mattie\u0027s location and state of mind hadn\u0027t been her concern; Rogette had called to talk to me. To tell me she was thinking of me. To bring back memories of how it felt to tread water with the back of your head gushing blood. To freak me out. And she had succeeded.\n \u0027What was the question you didn\u0027t answer?\u0027 John asked me.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what she meant by that,\u0027 I said, \u0027but I can tell you why hearing her turned me a little white in the gills. If you can be discreet, and if you want to hear.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ve got eighteen miles to cover; lay it on me.\u0027\n I told him about Friday night. I didn\u0027t clutter my version with visions or psychic phenomena; there was just Michael Noonan out for a sunset walk along The Street. I\u0027d been standing by a birch tree which hung over the lake, watching the sun drop toward the mountains, when they came up behind me. From the point where Devore charged me with his wheelchair to the point where I finally got back onto solid ground, I stuck pretty much to the truth.\n When I finished, John was at first utterly silent. It was a measure of how thrown for a loop he was; under normal circumstances he was every bit the chatterbox Ki was.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Comments? Questions?\u0027\n \u0027Lift your hair so I can see behind your ear.\u0027\n I did as he asked, revealing a big Band-Aid and a large area of swelling. John leaned forward to study it like a little kid observing his best friend\u0027s battle-scar during recess. \u0027Holy shit,\u0027 he said at last.\n It was my turn to say nothing.\n \u0027Those two old fucks tried to drown you.\u0027\n I said nothing.\n \u0027They tried to drown you for helping Mattie.\u0027\n Now I really said nothing.\n \u0027And you never reported it?\u0027\n \u0027I started to,\u0027 I said, \u0027then realized I\u0027d make myself look like a whiny little asshole. And a liar, most likely.\u0027\n \u0027How much do you think Osgood might know?\u0027\n \u0027About them trying to drown me? Nothing. He\u0027s just a messenger boy.\u0027\n A little more of that unusual quiet from John. After a few seconds of it he reached out and touched the lump on the back of my head.\n \u0027Ow!\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027 A pause. \u0027Jesus. Then he went back to Warrington\u0027s and pulled the pin. Jesus. Michael, I never would have played that tape if I\u0027d known ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s all right. But don\u0027t even think of telling Mattie. I\u0027m wearing my hair over my ear like that for a reason.\u0027\n \u0027Will you ever tell her, do you think?\u0027\n \u0027I might. Some day when he\u0027s been dead long enough so we can laugh about me swimming with my clothes on.\u0027\n \u0027That might be awhile,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Yeah. It might.\u0027\n We drove in silence for a bit. I could sense John groping for a way to bring the day back to jubilation, and loved him for it. He leaned forward, turned on the radio, and found something loud and nasty by Guns \u0027n Roses ¡ª welcome to the jungle, baby, we got fun and games.\n \u0027Party \u0027til we puke,\u0027 he said. \u0027Right?\u0027\n I grinned. It wasn\u0027t easy with the sound of the old woman\u0027s voice still clinging to me like light slime, but I managed. \u0027If you insist,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027I do,\u0027 he said. \u0027Most certainly.\u0027\n \u0027John, you\u0027re a good guy for a lawyer.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re a good one for a writer.\u0027\n This time the grin on my face felt more natural and stayed on longer. We passed the marker reading TR-90, and as we did, the sun burned through the haze and flooded the day with light. It seemed like an omen of better times ahead, until I looked into the west. There, black in the bright, I could see the thunderheads building up over the White Mountains. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-25.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: \n Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
