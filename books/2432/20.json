{"id":78365,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"The telephone was ringing. I climbed toward it from a drowning dream where I couldn\u0027t catch my breath, rising into early sunlight, wincing at the pain in the back of my head as I swung my feet out of bed. The phone would quit before I got to it, they almost always do in such situations, and then I\u0027d lie back down and spend a fruitless ten minutes wondering who it had been before getting up for good.\n Ringgg . . . ringgg . . . ringgg . . .\n Was that ten? A dozen? I\u0027d lost count. Someone was really dedicated. I hoped it wasn\u0027t trouble, but in my experience people don\u0027t try that hard when the news is good. I touched my fingers gingerly to the back of my head. It hurt plenty, but that deep, sick ache seemed to be gone. And there was no blood on my fingers when I looked at them.\n I padded down the hall and picked up the phone. \u0027Hello?\u0027\n \u0027Well, you won\u0027t have to worry about testifyin at the kid\u0027s custody hearin anymore, at least.\u0027\n \u0027Bill?\u0027\n \u0027Ayuh.\u0027\n \u0027How did you know . . . \u0027 I leaned around the corner and peered at the waggy, annoying cat-clock. Twenty minutes past seven and already sweltering. Hotter\u0027n a bugger, as us TR Martians like to say. \u0027How do you know he decided ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know nothing about his business one way or t\u0027other.\u0027 Bill sounded touchy. \u0027He never called to ask my advice, and I never called to give him any.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s going on?\u0027\n \u0027You haven\u0027t had the TV on yet?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t even have the coffee on yet.\u0027\n No apology from Bill; he was a fellow who believed that people who didn\u0027t get up until after six A.M. deserved whatever they got. I was awake now, though. And had a pretty good idea of what was coming.\n \u0027Devore killed himself last night, Mike. Got into a tub of warm water and pulled a plastic bag over his head. Mustn\u0027t have taken long, with his lungs the way they were.\u0027\n No, I thought, probably not long. In spite of the humid summer heat that already lay on the house, I shivered.\n \u0027Who found him? The woman?\u0027\n \u0027Ayuh, sure.\u0027\n \u0027What time?\u0027\n \u0027\u0027\u0027Shortly before midnight,\"\u0027 they said on the Channel 6 news.\u0027\n Right around the time I had awakened on the couch and taken myself stiffly off to bed, in other words.\n \u0027Is she implicated?\u0027\n \u0027Did she play Kevorkian, you mean? The news report I saw didn\u0027t say nothin about that. The gossip-mill down to the Lakeview General will be turnin brisk by now, but I ain\u0027t been down yet for my share of the grain. If she helped him, I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll ever see trouble for it, do you? He was eighty-five and not well.\u0027\n \u0027Do you know if he\u0027ll be buried on the TR?\u0027\n \u0027California. She said there\u0027d be services in Palm Springs on Tuesday.\u0027\n A sense of surpassing oddness swept over me as I realized the source of Mattie\u0027s problems might be lying in a chapel filled with flowers at the same time The Friends of Kyra Devore were digesting their lunches and getting ready to start throwing the Frisbee around. It\u0027s going to be a celebration, I thought wonderingly. I don\u0027t know how they\u0027re going to handle it in The Little Chapel of the Microchips in Palm Springs, but on Wasp Hill Road they\u0027re going to be dancing and throwing their arms in the sky and hollering Yes, lawd.\n I\u0027d never been glad to hear of anyone\u0027s death before in my life, but I was glad to hear of Devore\u0027s. I was sorry to feel that way, but I did. The old bastard had dumped me in the lake . . . but before the night was over, he was the one who had drowned. Inside a plastic bag he had drowned, sitting in a tub of tepid water.\n \u0027Any idea how the TV guys got onto it so fast?\u0027 It wasn\u0027t superfast, not with seven hours between the discovery of the body and the seven o\u0027clock news, but TV news people have a tendency to be lazy.\n \u0027Whitmore called em. Had a press conference right there in Warrington\u0027s parlor at two o\u0027clock this morning. Took questions settin on that big maroon plush sofa, the one Jo always used to say should be in a saloon oil paintin with a naked woman lyin on it. Remember?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\n \u0027I saw a coupla County deputies walkin around in the background, plus a fella I reckonized from Jaquard\u0027s Funeral Home in Motton.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s bizarre,\u0027 I said. \u0027Ayuh, body still upstairs, most likely, while Whitmore was runnin her gums . . . but she claimed she was just followin the boss\u0027s orders. Said he left a tape sayin he\u0027d done it on Friday night so as not to affect the cump\u0027ny stock price and wanted Rogette to call in the press right off and assure folks that the cump\u0027ny was solid, that between his son and the Board of Directors, everythin was going to be just acey-deucey. Then she told about the services in Palm Springs.\u0027\n \u0027He commits suicide, then holds a two A.M. press conference by proxy to soothe the stockholders.\u0027\n \u0027Ayuh. And it sounds just like him.\u0027\n A silence fell between us on the line. I tried to think and couldn\u0027t. All I knew was that I wanted to go upstairs and work, aching head or no aching head. I wanted to rejoin Andy Drake, John Shackleford, and Shackleford\u0027s childhood friend, the awful Ray Garraty. There was madness in my story, but it was a madness I understood.\n \u0027Bill,\u0027 I said at last, \u0027are we still friends?\u0027\n \u0027Christ, yes,\u0027 he said promptly. \u0027But if there\u0027s people around who seem a little stand-offy to you, you\u0027ll know why, won\u0027t you?\u0027\n Sure I\u0027d know. Many would blame the old man\u0027s death on me. It was crazy, given his physical condition, and it would by no means be a majority opinion, but the idea would gain a certain amount of credence, at least in the short run ¡ª I knew that as well as I knew the truth about John Shackleford\u0027s childhood friend.\n Kiddies, once upon a time there was a goose that flew back to the little unincorporated township where it had lived as a downy gosling. It began laying lovely golden eggs, and the townsfolk all gathered around to marvel and receive their share. Now, however, that goose was cooked and someone had to take the heat. I\u0027d get some, but Mattie\u0027s kitchen might get a few degrees toastier than mine; she\u0027d had the temerity to fight for her child instead of silently handing Ki over.\n \u0027Keep your head down the next few weeks,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027That\u0027d be my idea. In fact, if you had business that took you right out of the TR until all this settles down, that might be for the best.\u0027\n \u0027I appreciate the sense of what you\u0027re saying, but I can\u0027t. I\u0027m writing a book. If I pick up my shit and move, it\u0027s apt to die on me. It\u0027s happened before, and I don\u0027t want it to happen this time.\u0027\n \u0027Pretty good yarn, is it?\u0027\n \u0027Not bad, but that\u0027s not the important thing. It\u0027s . . . well, let\u0027s just say this one\u0027s important to me for other reasons.\u0027\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it travel as far as Derry?\u0027\n \u0027Are you trying to get rid of me, William?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m tryin to keep an eye out, that\u0027s all ¡ª caretakin\u0027s my job, y\u0027know. And don\u0027t say you weren\u0027t warned: the hive\u0027s gonna buzz. There\u0027s two stories going around about you, Mike. One is that you\u0027re shacking with Mattie Devore. The other is that you came back to write a hatchet-job on the TR. Pull out all the old skeletons you can find.\u0027\n \u0027Finish what Jo started, in other words. Who\u0027s been spreading that story, Bill?\u0027\n Silence from Bill. We were back on earthquake ground again, and this time that ground felt shakier than ever.\n \u0027The book I\u0027m working on is a novel,\u0027 I said. \u0027Set in Florida.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, ayuh?\u0027 You wouldn\u0027t think three little syllables could have so much relief in them.\n \u0027Think you could kind of pass that around?\u0027\n \u0027I think I could,\u0027 he said. \u0027If you tell Brenda Meserve, it\u0027d get around even faster and go even farther.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, I will. As far as Mattie goes ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Mike, you don\u0027t have to\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not shacking with her. That was never the deal. The deal was like walking down the street, turning the corner, and seeing a big guy beating up a little guy.\u0027 I paused. \u0027She and her lawyer are planning a barbecue at her place Tuesday noon. I\u0027m planning to join them. Are people from town going to think we\u0027re dancing on Devore\u0027s grave?\u0027\n \u0027Some will. Royce Merrill will. Dickie Brooks will. Old ladies in pants, Yvette calls em.\u0027\n \u0027Well fuck them,\u0027 I said. \u0027Every last one.\u0027\n \u0027I understand how you feel, but tell her not to shove it in folks\u0027 faces,\u0027 he almost pleaded. \u0027Do that much, Mike. It wouldn\u0027t kill her to drag her grill around back of her trailer, would it? At least with it there, folks lookin out from the store or the garage wouldn\u0027t see nothing but the smoke.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll pass on the message. And if I make the party, I\u0027ll put the barbecue around back myself.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d do well to stay away from that girl and her child,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027You can tell me it\u0027s none of my business, but I\u0027m talkin to you like a Dutch uncle, tellin you for your own good.\u0027\n I had a flash of my dream then. The slick, exquisite tightness as I slipped inside her. The little breasts with their hard nipples. Her voice in the darkness, telling me to do what I wanted. My body responded almost instantly. \u0027I know you are,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027All right.\u0027 He sounded relieved that I wasn\u0027t going to scold him ¡ª take him to school, he would have said. \u0027I\u0027ll let you go n have your breakfast.\u0027\n \u0027I appreciate you calling.\u0027\n \u0027Almost didn\u0027t. Yvette talked me into it. She said, \"You always liked Mike and Jo Noonan best of all the ones you did for. Don\u0027t you get in bad with him now that he\u0027s back home.\u0027\u0027\n \u0027Tell her I appreciate it,\u0027 I said.\n I hung up the phone and looked at it thoughtfully. We seemed to be on good terms again . . . but I didn\u0027t think we were exactly friends. Certainly not the way we had been. That had changed when I realized Bill was lying to me about some things and holding back about others; it had also changed when I realized what he had almost called Sara and the Red-Tops.\n You can\u0027t condemn a manor what may only be a figment of your own imagination.\n True, and I\u0027d try not to do it . . . but I knew what I knew.\n I went into the living room, snapped on the TV, then snapped it off again. My satellite dish got fifty or sixty different channels, and not a one of them local. There was a portable TV in the kitchen, however, and if I dipped its rabbit-ears toward the lake I\u0027d be able to get WMTW, the ABC affiliate in western Maine.\n I snatched up Rogette\u0027s note, went into the kitchen, and turned on the little Sony tucked under the cabinets with the coffee-maker. Good Morning America was on, but they would be breaking for the local news soon. In the meantime I scanned the note, this time concentrating on the mode of expression rather than the message, which had taken all of my attention the night before.\n Hopes to return to California by private jet very soon, she had written.\n Has business which can be put off no longer, she had written.\n If you promise to let him rest in peace, she had written.\n It was a goddam suicide note.\n \u0027You knew,\u0027 I said, rubbing my thumb over the raised letters of her name. \u0027You knew when you wrote this, and probably when you were chucking rocks at me. But why?\u0027\n Custody has its responsibilities, she had written. Don\u0027t forget he said so.\n But the custody business was over, right? Not even a judge that was bought and paid for could award custody to a dead man.\n GMA finally gave way to the local report, where Max Devore\u0027s suicide was the leader. The TV picture was snowy, but I could see the maroon sofa Bill had mentioned, and Rogette Whitmore sitting on it with her hands folded composedly in her lap. I thought one of the deputies in the background was George Footman, although the snow was too heavy for me to be completely sure.\n Mr. Devore had spoken frequently over the last eight months of ending his life, Whitmore said. He had been very unwell. He had asked her to come out with him the previous evening, and she realized now that he had wanted to look at one final sunset. It had been a glorious one, too, she added. I could have corroborated that; I remembered the sunset very well, having almost drowned by its light.\n Rogette was reading Devore\u0027s statement when my phone rang again. It was Mattie, and she was crying in hard gusts.\n \u0027The news,\u0027 she said, \u0027Mike, did you see . . . do you know . . . \u0027\n At first that was all she could manage that was coherent. I told her I did know, Bill Dean had called me and then I\u0027d caught some of it on the local news. She tried to reply and couldn\u0027t speak. Guilt, relief, horror, even hilarity ¡ª I heard all those things in her crying. I asked where Ki was. I could sympathize with how Mattie felt ¡ª until turning on the news this morning she\u0027d believed old Max Devore was her bitterest enemy ¡ª but I didn\u0027t like the idea of a three-year-old girl watching her mom fall apart.\n \u0027Out back,\u0027 she managed. \u0027She\u0027s had her breakfast. Now she\u0027s having a d-doll p-p-p . . . doll pi-p-pic ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Doll picnic. Yes. Good. Let it go, then. All of it.\n Let it out.\u0027 She cried for two minutes at least, maybe longer. I stood with the telephone pressed to my ear, sweating in the July heat, trying to be patient.\n I\u0027m going to give you one chance to save your soul, Devore had told me, but this morning he was dead and his soul was wherever it was. He was dead, Mattie was free, I was writing. Life should have felt wonderful, but it didn\u0027t.\n At last she began to get her control back. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. I haven\u0027t cried like that ¡ª really, really cried ¡ª since Lance died.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s understandable and you\u0027re allowed.\u0027\n \u0027Come to lunch,\u0027 she said. \u0027Come to lunch please, Mike. Ki\u0027s going to spend the afternoon with a friend she met at Vacation Bible School, and we can talk. I need to talk to someone . . . God, my head is spinning. Please say you\u0027ll come.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d love to, but it\u0027s a bad idea. Especially with Ki gone.\u0027\n I gave her an edited version of my conversation with Bill Dean. She listened carefully. I thought there might be an angry outburst when I finished, but I\u0027d forgotten one simple fact: Mattie Stanchfield Devore had lived around here all her life. She knew how things worked.\n \u0027I understand that things will heal quicker if I keep my eyes down, my mouth shut, and my knees together,\u0027 she said, \u0027and I\u0027ll do my best to go along, but diplomacy only stretches so far. That old man was trying to take my daughter away, don\u0027t they realize that down at the goddam general store?\u0027\n \u0027I realize it.\u0027\n \u0027I know. That\u0027s why I wanted to talk to you.\u0027\n \u0027What if we had an early supper on the Castle Rock common? Same place as Friday? Say five-ish?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d have to bring Ki ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027Bring her. Tell her I know \"Hansel and Gretel\" by heart and am willing to share. Will you call John in Philly? Give him the details?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. I\u0027ll wait another hour or so. God, I\u0027m so happy. I know that\u0027s wrong, but I\u0027m so happy I could burst!\u0027\n \u0027That makes two of us.\u0027 There was a pause on the other end. I heard a long, watery intake of breath. \u0027Mattie? All right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but how do you tell a three-year-old her grandfather died?\u0027\n Tell her the old fuck slipped and fell headfirst into a Glad Bag, I thought, then pressed the back of my hand against my mouth to stifle a spate of lunatic cackles.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, but you\u0027ll have to do it as soon as she comes in.\u0027\n \u0027I will? Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because she\u0027s going to see you. She\u0027s going to see your face.\u0027\n I lasted exactly two hours in the upstairs study, and then the heat drove me out ¡ª the thermometer on the stoop read ninety-five degrees at ten o\u0027clock. I guessed it might be five degrees warmer on the second floor.\n Hoping I wasn\u0027t making a mistake, I unplugged the IBM and carried it downstairs. I was working without a shirt, and as I crossed the living room, the back of the typewriter slipped in the sweat coating my midriff and I almost dropped the outdated sonofabitch on my toes. That made me think of my ankle, the one I\u0027d hurt when I fell into the lake, and I set the typewriter aside to look at it. It was colorful, black and purple and reddish at the edges, but not terribly inflated. I guessed my immersion in the cool water had helped keep the swelling down.\n I put the typewriter on the deck table, rummaged out an extension cord, plugged in beneath Bunter\u0027s watchful eye, and sat down facing the hazy blue-gray surface of the lake. I waited for one of my old anxiety attacks to hit ¡ª the clenched stomach, the throbbing eyes, and, worst of all, that sensation of invisible steel bands clamped around my chest, making it impossible to breathe. Nothing like that happened. The words flowed as easily down here as they had upstairs, and my naked upper body was loving the little breeze that puffed in off the lake every now and again. I forgot about Max Devore, Mattie Devore, Kyra Devore. I forgot about Jo Noonan and Sara Tidwell. I forgot about myself. For two hours I was back in Florida. John Shackleford\u0027s execution was nearing. Andy Drake was racing the clock.\n It was the telephone that brought me back, and for once I didn\u0027t resent interruption. If undisturbed, I might have gone on writing until I simply melted into a sweaty pile of goo on the deck.\n It was my brother. We talked about Mom ¡ª in Siddy\u0027s opinion she was now short an entire roof instead of just a few shingles ¡ª and her sister, Francine, who had broken her hip in June. Sid wanted to know how I was doing, and I told him I was doing all right, I\u0027d had some problems getting going on a new book but now seemed to be back on track (in my family, the only permissible time to discuss trouble is when it\u0027s over). And how was the Sidster? Kickin, he said, which I assumed meant just fine ¡ª Siddy has a twelve-year-old, and consequently his slang is always up-to-date. The new accounting business was starting to take hold, although he\u0027d been scared for awhile (first I knew of it, of course). He could never thank me enough for the bridge loan I\u0027d made him last November. I replied that it was the least I could do, which was the absolute truth, especially when I considered how much more time ¡ª both in person and on the phone ¡ª he spent with our mother than I did.\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ll let you go,\u0027 Siddy told me after a few more pleasantries ¡ª he never says goodbye or so long when he\u0027s on the phone, it\u0027s always well, I\u0027ll let you go, as if he\u0027s been holding you hostage. \u0027You want to keep cool up there, Mike ¡ª Weather Channel says it\u0027s going to be hotter than hell in New England all weekend.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s always the lake if things get too bad. Hey Sid?\u0027\n \u0027Hey what?\u0027 Like I\u0027ll let you go, Hey what went back to childhood. It was sort of comforting; it was also sort of spooky.\n \u0027Our folks all came from Prout\u0027s Neck, right? I mean on Daddy\u0027s side.\u0027 Mom came from another world entirely ¡ª one where the men wear Lacoste polo shirts, the women always wear full slips under their dresses, and everyone knows the second verse of \u0027Dixie\u0027 by heart. She had met my dad in Portland while competing in a college cheerleading event. Materfamilias came from Memphis quality, darling, and didn\u0027t let you forget it.\n \u0027I guess so,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yeah. But don\u0027t go asking me a lot of family-tree questions, Mike ¡ª I\u0027m still not sure what the difference is between a nephew and a cousin, and I told Jo the same thing.\u0027\n \u0027Did you?\u0027 Everything inside me had gone very still . . . but I can\u0027t say I was surprised. Not by then.\n \u0027Uh-huh, you bet.\u0027\n \u0027What did she want to know?\u0027\n \u0027Everything I knew. Which isn\u0027t much. I could have told her all about Ma\u0027s great-great-grandfather, the one who got killed by the Indians, but Jo didn\u0027t seem to care about any of Ma\u0027s folks.\u0027\n \u0027When would this have been?\u0027\n \u0027Does it matter?\u0027\n \u0027It might.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, let\u0027s see. I think it was around the time Patrick had his appendectomy. Yeah, I\u0027m sure it was. February of \u002794. It might have been March, but I\u0027m pretty sure it was February.\u0027\n Six months from the Rite Aid parking lot. Jo moving into the shadow of her own death like a woman stepping beneath the shade of an awning. Not pregnant, though, not yet. Jo making day-trips to the TR. Jo asking questions, some of the sort that made people feel bad, according to Bill Dean . . . but she\u0027d gone on asking just the same. Yeah. Because once she got onto something, Jo was like a terrier with a rag in its jaws. Had she been asking questions of the man in the brown sportcoat? Who was the man in the brown sportcoat?\n \u0027Pat was in the hospital, sure. Dr. Alpert said he was doing fine, but when the phone rang I jumped for it ¡ª I half-expected it to be him, Alpert, saying Pat had had a relapse or something.\u0027\n \u0027Where in God\u0027s name did you get this sense of impending doom, Sid?\u0027\n \u0027I dunno, buddy, but it\u0027s there. Anyway, it\u0027s not Alpert, it\u0027s Johanna. She wants to know if we had any ancestors ¡ª three, maybe even four generations back who lived there where you are, or in one of the surrounding towns. I told her I didn\u0027t know, but you might. Know, I mean. She said she didn\u0027t want to ask you because it was a surprise. Was it a surprise?\u0027\n \u0027A big one,\u0027 I said. \u0027Daddy was a lobsterman ¡ª \u0027\n \u0027Bite your tongue, he was an artist ¡ª \u0027a seacoast primitive.\u0027 Ma still calls him that.\u0027 Siddy wasn\u0027t quite laughing.\n \u0027Shit, he sold lobster-pot coffee-tables and lawn-puffins to the tourists when he got too rheumatic to go out on the bay and haul traps.\u0027\n \u0027I know that, but Ma\u0027s got her marriage edited like a movie for television.\u0027\n How true. Our own version of Blanche Du Bois. \u0027Dad was a lobster-man in Prout\u0027s Neck. He ¡ª \u0027\n Siddy interrupted, singing the first verse of \u0027Papa Was a Rollin\u0027 Stone\u0027 in a horrible off key tenor.\n \u0027Come on, this is serious. He had his first boat from his father, right?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the story,\u0027 Sid agreed. \u0027Jack Noonan\u0027s Lazy Betty, original owner Paul Noonan. Also of Prout\u0027s. Boat took a hell of a pasting in Hurricane Donna, back in 1960. I think it was Donna.\u0027\n Two years after I was born. \u0027And Daddy put it up for sale in \u002763.\u0027\n \u0027Yep. I don\u0027t know whatever became of it, but it was Grampy Paul\u0027s to begin with, all right. Do you remember all the lobster stew we ate when we were kids, Mikey?\u0027\n \u0027Seacoast meatloaf,\u0027 I said, hardly thinking about it. Like most kids raised on the coast of Maine, I can\u0027t imagine ordering lobster in a restaurant ¡ª that\u0027s for flatlanders. I was thinking about Grampy Paul, who had been born in the 1890s. Paul Noonan begat Jack Noonan, Jack Noonan begat Mike and Sid Noonan, and that was really all I knew, except the Noonans had all grown up a long way from where I now stood sweating my brains out.\n They shit in the same pit.\n Devore had gotten it wrong, that was all ¡ª when we Noonans weren\u0027t wearing polo shirts and being Memphis quality, we were Prout\u0027s Neckers. It was unlikely that Devore\u0027s great-grandfather and my own would have had anything to do with each other in any case; the old rip had been twice my age, and that meant the generations didn\u0027t match up.\n But if he had been totally wrong, what had Jo been on about?\n \u0027Mike?\u0027 Sid asked. \u0027Are you there?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\n \u0027Are you okay? You don\u0027t sound so great, I have to tell you.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the heat,\u0027 I said. \u0027Not to mention your sense of impending doom. Thanks for calling, Siddy.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks for being there, brother.\u0027\n \u0027Kickin,\u0027 I said.\n I went out to the kitchen to get a glass of cold water. As I was filling it, I heard the magnets on the fridge begin sliding around. I whirled, spilling some of the water on my bare feet and hardly noticing. I was as excited as a kid who thinks he may glimpse Santa Claus before he shoots back up the chimney.\n I was barely in time to see nine plastic letters drawn into the circle from all points of the compass. CARLADEAN, they spelled . . . but only for a second. Some presence, tremendous but unseen, shot past me. Not a hair on my head stirred, but there was still a strong sense of being buffeted, the way you\u0027re buffeted by the air of a passing express train if you\u0027re standing near the platform yellow-line when the train bolts through. I cried out in surprise and groped my glass of water back onto the counter, spilling it. I no longer felt in need of cold water, because the temperature in the kitchen of Sara Laughs had dropped off the table.\n I blew out my breath and saw vapor, as you do on a cold day in January. One puff, maybe two, and it was gone ¡ª but it had been there, all right, and for perhaps five seconds the film of sweat on my body turned to what felt like a slime of ice.\n CARLADEAN exploded outward in all directions ¡ª it was like watching an atom being smashed in a cartoon. Magnetized letters, fruits, and vegetables flew off the front of the refrigerator and scattered across the kitchen. For a moment the fury which fuelled that scattering was something I could almost taste, like gunpowder.\n And something gave way before it, going with a sighing, rueful whisper I had heard before: \u0027Oh Mike. Oh Mike.\u0027 It was the voice I\u0027d caught on the Memo-Scriber tape, and although I hadn\u0027t been sure then, I was now ¡ª it was Jo\u0027s voice.\n But who was the other one? Why had it scattered the letters?\n Carla Dean. Not Bill\u0027s wife; that was Yvette. His mother? His grandmother?\n I walked slowly through the kitchen, collecting fridge-magnets like prizes in a scavenger hunt and sticking them back on the Kenmore by the handful. Nothing snatched them out of my hands; nothing froze the sweat on the back of my neck; Bunter\u0027s bell didn\u0027t ring. Still, I wasn\u0027t alone, and I knew it.\n CARLADEAN: Jo had wanted me to know.\n Something else hadn\u0027t. Something else had shot past me like the Wabash Cannonball, trying to scatter the letters before I could read them.\n Jo was here; a boy who wept in the night was here, too.\n And what else?\n What else was sharing my house with me? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-20.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: \n Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
