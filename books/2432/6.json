{"id":78351,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Once, when I was sixteen, a plane went supersonic directly over my head.\\n\\n I was walking in the woods when it happened, thinking of some story I was going to write, perhaps, or how great it would be if Doreen Fournier weakened some Friday night and let me take off her panties while we were parked at the end of Cushman Road.\\n\\n In any case I was travelling far roads in my own mind, and when that boom went off, I was caught totally by surprise. I went flat on the leafy ground with my hands over my head and my heart drumming crazily, sure I\u0027d reached the end of my life (and while I was still a virgin). In my forty years, that was the only thing which equalled the final dream of the \u0027Manderley series\u0027 for utter terror.\\n\\n I lay on the ground, waiting for the hammer to fall, and when thirty seconds or so passed and no hammer did fall, I began to realize it had just been some jet-jockey from the Brunswick Naval Air Station, too eager to wait until he was out over the Atlantic before going to Mach 1. But, holy shit, who ever could have guessed that it would be so loud?\\n\\n I got slowly to my feet and as I stood there with my heart finally slowing down, I realized I wasn\u0027t the only thing that had been scared witless by that sudden clear-sky boom. For the first time in my memory, the little patch of woods behind our house in Prout\u0027s Neck was entirely silent. I stood there in a dusty bar of sunlight, crumbled leaves all over my tee-shirt and jeans, holding my breath, listening. I had never heard a silence like it. Even on a cold day in January, the woods would have been full of conversation.\\n\\n At last a finch sang. There were two or three seconds of silence, and then a jay replied. Another two or three seconds went by, and then a crow added his two cents\u0027 worth. A woodpecker began to hammer for grubs. A chipmunk bumbled through some underbrush on my left. A minute after I had stood up, the woods were fully alive with little noises again; it was back to business as usual, and I continued with my own. I never forgot that unexpected boom, though, or the deathly silence which followed it.\\n\\n I thought of that June day often in the wake of the nightmare, and there was nothing so remarkable in that. Things had changed, somehow, or could change . . . but first comes silence while we assure ourselves that we are still unhurt and that the danger ¡ª if there was danger ¡ª is gone.\\n\\n Derry was shut down for most of the following week, anyway. Ice and high winds caused a great deal of damage during the storm, and a sudden twenty-degree plunge in the temperature afterward made the digging out hard and the cleanup slow. Added to that, the atmosphere after a March storm is always dour and pessimistic; we get them up this way every year (and two or three in April for good measure, if we\u0027re not lucky), but we never seem to expect them. Every time we get clouted, we take it personally.\\n\\n On a day toward the end of that week, the weather finally started to break. I took advantage, going out for a cup of coffee and a mid-morning pastry at the little restaurant three doors down from the Rite Aid where Johanna did her last errand. I was sipping and chewing and working the newspaper crossword when someone asked, \u0027Could I share your booth, Mr. Noonan? It\u0027s pretty crowded in here today.\u0027\\n\\n I looked up and saw an old man that I knew but couldn\u0027t quite place.\\n\\n \u0027Ralph Roberts,\u0027 he said. \u0027I volunteer down at the Red Cross. Me and my wife, Lois.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, okay, sure,\u0027 I said. I give blood at the Red Cross every six weeks or so. Ralph Roberts was one of the old parties who passed out juice and cookies afterward, telling you not to get up or make any sudden movements if you felt woozy. \u0027Please, sit down.\u0027 He looked at my paper, folded open to the crossword and lying in a patch of sun, as he slid into the booth. \u0027Don\u0027t you find that doing the crossword in the Derry News is sort of like striking out the pitcher in a baseball game?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n I laughed and nodded. \u0027I do it for the same reason folks climb Mount Everest, Mr. Roberts . . . because it\u0027s there. Only with the News crossword, no one ever falls off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Call me Ralph. Please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay. And I\u0027m Mike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good.\u0027 He grinned, revealing teeth that were crooked and a little yellow, but all his own. \u0027I like getting to the first names. It\u0027s like being able to take off your tie. Was quite a little cap of wind we had, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, \u0027but it\u0027s warming up nicely now.\u0027 The thermometer had made one of its nimble March leaps, climbing from twenty-five degrees the night before to fifty that morning. Better than the rise in air-temperature, the sun was warm again on your face. It was that warmth that had coaxed me out of the house. \u0027Spring\u0027ll get here, I guess. Some years it gets a little lost, but it always seems to find its way back home.\u0027 He sipped his coffee, then set the cup down. \u0027Haven\u0027t seen you at the Red Cross lately.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m recycling,\u0027 I said, but that was a fib; I\u0027d come eligible to give another pint two weeks ago. The reminder card was up on the refrigerator. It had just slipped my mind. \u0027Next week, for sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I only mention it because I know you\u0027re an A, and we can always use that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Save me a couch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Count on it. Everything going all right? I only ask because you look tired. If it\u0027s insomnia, I can sympathize, believe me.\u0027\\n\\n He did have the look of an insomniac, I thought ¡ª too wide around the eyes, somehow. But he was also a man in his mid- to late seventies, and I don\u0027t think anyone gets that far without showing it. Stick around a little while, and life maybe only jabs at your cheeks and eyes. Stick around a long while and you end up looking like Jake La Motta after a hard fifteen. I opened my mouth to say what I always do when someone asks me if I\u0027m all right, then wondered why I always felt I had to pull that tiresome Marlboro Man shit, just who I was trying to fool. What did I think would happen if I told the guy who gave me a chocolate-chip cookie down at the Red Cross after the nurse took the needle out of my arm that I wasn\u0027t feeling a hundred percent? Earthquakes? Fire and flood? Shit. \u0027No,\u0027 I said, \u0027I really haven\u0027t been feeling so great, Ralph.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Flu? It\u0027s been going around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nah. The flu missed me this time, actually. And I\u0027ve been sleeping all right.\u0027 Which was true ¡ª there had been no recurrence of the Sara Laughs dream in either the normal or the high-octane version. \u0027I think I\u0027ve just got the blues.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you ought to take a vacation,\u0027 he said, then sipped his coffee. When he looked up at me again, he frowned and set his cup down. \u0027What? Is something wrong?\u0027\\n\\n No, I thought of saying. You were just the first bird to sing into the silence, Ralph, that\u0027s all.\\n\\n \u0027No, nothing wrong,\u0027 I said, and then, because I sort of wanted to see how the words tasted coming out of my own mouth, I repeated them. \u0027A vacation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh,\u0027 he said, smiling. \u0027People do it all the time.\u0027\\n\\n People do it all the time. He was right about that; even people who couldn\u0027t strictly afford to went on vacation. When they got tired. When they got all balled up in their own shit. When the world was too much with them, getting and spending.\\n\\n I could certainly afford a vacation, and I could certainly take the time off from work ¡ª what work, ha-ha? ¡ª and yet I\u0027d needed the Red Cross cookie-man to point out what should have been self-evident to a college-educated guy like me: that I hadn\u0027t been on an actual vacation since Jo and I had gone to Bermuda, the winter before she died. My particular grindstone was no longer turning, but I had kept my nose to it all the same.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t until that summer, when I read Ralph Roberts\u0027s obituary in the News (he was struck by a car), that I fully realized how much I owed him. That advice was better than any glass of orange juice I ever got after giving blood, let me tell you.\\n\\n When I left the restaurant, I didn\u0027t go home but tramped over half of the damned town, the section of newspaper with the partly completed crossword puzzle in it clamped under one arm. I walked until I was chilled in spite of the warming temperatures. I didn\u0027t think about anything, and yet I thought about everything. It was a special kind of thinking, the sort I\u0027d always done when I was getting close to writing a book, and although I hadn\u0027t thought that way in years, I fell into it easily and naturally, as if I had never been away.\\n\\n It\u0027s like some guys with a big truck have pulled up in your driveway and are moving things into your basement. I can\u0027t explain it any better than that. You can\u0027t see what these things are because they\u0027re all wrapped up in padded quilts, but you don\u0027t need to see them. It\u0027s furniture, everything you need to make your house a home, make it just right, just the way you wanted it.\\n\\n When the guys have hopped back into their truck and driven away, you go down to the basement and walk around (the way I went walking around Derry that late morning, slopping up hill and down dale in my old galoshes), touching a padded curve here, a padded angle there. Is this one a sofa? Is that\u0027 one a dresser? It doesn\u0027t matter. Everything is here, the movers didn\u0027t forget a thing, and although you\u0027ll have to get it all upstairs yourself (straining your poor old back in the process, more often than not), that\u0027s okay. The important thing is that the delivery was complete.\\n\\n This time I thought ¡ª hoped ¡ª the delivery truck had brought the stuff I needed for the back forty: the years I might have to spend in a No Writing Zone. To the cellar door they had come, and they had knocked politely, and when after several months there was still no answer, they had finally fetched a battering ram. HEY BUDDY, HOPE THE NOISE DIDN\u0027T SCARE YOU TOO BAD, SORRY ABOUT THE DOOR!\\n\\n I didn\u0027t care about the door; I cared about the furniture. Any pieces broken or missing? I didn\u0027t think so. I thought all I had to do was get it upstairs, pull off the furniture pads, and put it where it belonged.\\n\\n On my way back home, I passed The Shade, Derry\u0027s charming little revival movie house, which has prospered in spite of (or perhaps because of) the video revolution. This month they were showing classic SF from the fifties, but April was dedicated to Humphrey Bogart, Jo\u0027s all-time favorite. I stood under the marquee for several moments, studying one of the Coming Attractions posters. Then I went home, picked a travel agent pretty much at random from the phone book, and told the guy I wanted to go to Key Largo. Key West, you mean, the guy said. No, I told him, I mean Key Largo, just like in the movie with Bogie and Bacall. Three weeks. Then I rethought that. I was wealthy, I was on my own, and I was retired. What was this \u0027three weeks\u0027 shit? Make it six, I said. Find me a cottage or something. Going to be expensive, he said. I told him I didn\u0027t care. When I came back to Derry, it would be spring. In the meantime, I had some furniture to unwrap.\\n\\n I was enchanted with Key Largo for the first month and bored out of my mind for the last two weeks. I stayed, though, because boredom is good. People with a high tolerance for boredom can get a lot of thinking done. I ate about a billion shrimp, drank about a thousand margaritas, and read twenty-three John D. MacDonald novels by actual count. I burned, peeled, and finally tanned. I bought a long-billed cap with PARROTHEAD printed on it in bright green thread. I walked the same stretch of beach until I knew everybody by first name. And I unwrapped furniture. A lot of it I didn\u0027t like, but there was no doubt that it all fit the house.\\n\\n I thought about Jo and our life together. I thought about saying to her that no one was ever going to confuse Being Two with Look Homeward, Angel. \u0027You aren\u0027t going to pull a lot of frustrated-artist crap on me, are you, Noonan?\u0027 she had replied . . . and during my time on Key Largo, those words kept coming back, always in Jo\u0027s voice: crap, frustrated-artist crap, all that fucking schoolboy frustrated-artist crap.\\n\\n I thought about her long red woods apron, coming to me with a hatful of black trumpet mushrooms, laughing and triumphant: \u0027Nobody on the TR eats better than the Noonans tonight!\u0027 she\u0027d cried. I thought of her painting her toenails, bent over between her own thighs in the way only women doing that particular piece of business can manage. I thought of her throwing a book at me because I laughed at some new haircut. I thought of her trying to learn how to play a breakdown on her banjo and of how she looked braless in a thin sweater. I thought of her crying and laughing and angry. I thought of her telling me it was crap, all that frustrated-artist crap.\\n\\n And I thought about the dreams, especially the culminating dream. I could do that easily, because it never faded as the more ordinary ones do. The final Sara Laughs dream and my very first wet dream (coming upon a girl lying naked in a hammock and eating a plum) are the only two that remain perfectly clear to me, year after year; the rest are either hazy fragments or completely forgotten.\\n\\n There were a great many clear details to the Sara dreams ¡ª the loons, the crickets, the evening star and my wish upon it, just to name a few ¡ª but I thought most of those things were just verisimilitude. Scene-setting, if you will. As such, they could be dismissed from my considerations. That left three major elements, three large pieces of furniture to be unwrapped.\\n\\n As I sat on the beach, watching the sun go down between my sandy toes, I didn\u0027t think you had to be a shrink to see how those three things went together.\\n\\n In the Sara dreams, the major elements were the woods behind me, the house below me, and Michael Noonan himself, frozen in the middle. It\u0027s getting dark and there\u0027s danger in the woods. It will be frightening to go to the house below, perhaps because it\u0027s been empty so long, but I never doubt I must go there; scary or not, it\u0027s the only shelter I have. Except I can\u0027t do it. I can\u0027t move. I\u0027ve got writer\u0027s walk.\\n\\n In the nightmare I am finally able to go toward shelter, only the shelter proves false. Proves more dangerous than I had ever expected in my . . . well, yes, in my wildest dreams. My dead wife rushes out, screaming and still tangled in her shroud, to attack me. Even five weeks later and almost three thousand miles from Derry, remembering that speedy white thing with its baggy arms would make me shiver and look back over my shoulder.\\n\\n But was it Johanna? I didn\u0027t really know, did I? The thing was all wrapped up. The coffin looked like the one in which she had been buried, true, but that might just be misdirection.\\n\\n Writer\u0027s walk, writer\u0027s block.\\n\\n I can\u0027t write, I told the voice in the dream. The voice says I can. The voice says the writer\u0027s block is gone, and I believe it because the writer\u0027s walk is gone, I\u0027m finally headed down the driveway, going to shelter. I\u0027m afraid, though. Even before the shapeless white thing makes its appearance, I\u0027m terrified. I say it\u0027s Mrs. Danvers I\u0027m afraid of, but that\u0027s just my dreaming mind getting Sara Laughs and Manderley all mixed up. I\u0027m afraid of ¡ª\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid of writing,\u0027 I heard myself saying out loud. \u0027I\u0027m afraid to even try.\u0027\\n\\n This was the night before I finally flew back to Maine, and I was half-past sober, going on drunk. By the end of my vacation, I was drinking a lot of evenings. \u0027It\u0027s not the block that scares me, it\u0027s undoing the block. I\u0027m really fucked, boys and girls. I\u0027m fucked big-time.\u0027\\n\\n Fucked or not, I had an idea I\u0027d finally reached the heart of the matter. I was afraid of undoing the block, maybe afraid of picking up the strands of my life and going on without Jo. Yet some deep part of my mind believed I must do it; that\u0027s what the menacing noises behind me in the woods were about. And belief counts for a lot. Too much, maybe, especially if you\u0027re imaginative. When an imaginative person gets into mental trouble, the line between seeming and being has a way of disappearing.\\n\\n Things in the woods, yes, sir. I had one of them right there in my hand as I was thinking these things. I lifted my drink, holding it toward the western sky so that the setting sun seemed to be burning in the glass. I was drinking a lot, and maybe that was okay on Key Largo ¡ª hell, people were supposed to drink a lot on vacation, it was almost the law ¡ª but I\u0027d been drinking too much even before I left. The kind of drinking that could get out of hand in no time at all. The kind that could get a man in trouble.\\n\\n Things in the woods, and the potentially safe place guarded by a scary bugbear that was not my wife, but perhaps my wife\u0027s memory. It made sense, because Sara Laughs had always been Jo\u0027s favorite place on earth. That thought led to another, one that made me swing my legs over the side of the chaise I\u0027d been reclining on and sit up in excitement. Sara Laughs had also been the place where the ritual had begun . . . champagne, last line, and the all-important benediction: Well, then, that\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t it?\\n\\n Did I want things to be all right again? Did I truly want that? A month or a year before I mightn\u0027t have been sure, but now I was. The answer was yes. I wanted to move on ¡ª let go of my dead wife, rehab my heart, move on. But to do that, I\u0027d have to go back.\\n\\n Back to the log house. Back to Sara Laughs. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I said, and my body broke out in gooseflesh. \u0027Yeah, you got it.\u0027\\n\\n So why not? The question made me feel as stupid as Ralph Roberts\u0027s observation that I needed a vacation. If I needed to go back to Sara Laughs now that my vacation was over, indeed why not? It might be a little scary the first night or two, a hangover from my final dream, but just being there might dissolve the dream faster.\\n\\n And (this last thought I allowed in only one humble corner of my conscious mind) something might happen with my writing. It wasn\u0027t likely . . . but it wasn\u0027t impossible, either. Barring a miracle, hadn\u0027t that been my thought on New Year\u0027s Day as I sat on the rim of the tub, holding a damp washcloth to the cut on my forehead? Yes. Barring a miracle. Sometimes blind people fall down, knock their heads, and regain their sight. Sometimes maybe cripples are able to throw their crutches away when they get to the top of the church steps.\\n\\n I had eight or nine months before Harold and Debra started really bugging me for the next novel. I decided to spend the time at Sara Laughs. It would take me a little while to tie things up in Derry, and awhile for Bill Dean to get the house on the lake ready for a year-round resident, but I could be down there by the Fourth of July, easily. I decided that was a good date to shoot for, not just the birthday of our country, but pretty much the end of bug season in western Maine.\\n\\n By the day I packed up my vacation gear (the John D. MacDonald paperbacks I left for the cabin\u0027s next inhabitant), shaved a week\u0027s worth of stubble off a face so tanned it no longer looked like my own to me, and flew back to Maine, I was decided: I\u0027d go back to the place my subconscious mind had identified as shelter against the deepening dark; I\u0027d go back even though my mind had also suggested that doing so would not be without risks. I would not go back expecting Sara to be Lourdes . . . but I would allow myself to hope, and when I saw the evening star peeping out over the lake for the first time, I would allow myself to wish on it.\\n\\n Only one thing didn\u0027t fit into my neat deconstruction of the Sara dreams, and because I couldn\u0027t explain it, I tried to ignore it. I didn\u0027t have much luck, though; part of me was still a writer, I guess, and a writer is a man who has taught his mind to misbehave.\\n\\n It was the cut on the back of my hand. That cut had been in all the dreams, I would swear it had . . . and then it had actually appeared. You didn\u0027t get that sort of shit in the works of Dr. Freud; stuff like that was strictly for the Psychic Friends hotline.\\n\\n It was a coincidence, that\u0027s all, I thought as my plane started its descent. I was in seat A-2 (the nice thing about flying up front is that if the plane goes down, you\u0027re first to the crash site) and looking at pine forests as we slipped along the glidepath toward Bangor International Airport. The snow was gone for another year; I had vacationed it to death. Only coincidence. How many times have you cut your hands? I mean, they\u0027re always out front, aren\u0027t they, waving themselves around? Practically begging for it.\\n\\n All that should have rung true, and yet somehow it didn\u0027t, quite. It should have, but . . . well . . .\\n\\n It was the boys in the basement. They were the ones who didn\u0027t buy it. The boys in the basement didn\u0027t buy it at all. At that point there was a thump as the 737 touched down, and I put the whole line of thought out of my mind.\\n\\n One afternoon shortly after arriving back home, I rummaged the closets until I found the shoeboxes containing Jo\u0027s old photographs. I sorted them, then studied my way through the ones of Dark Score Lake. There were a staggering number of these, but because Johanna was the shutterbug, there weren\u0027t many with her in them. I found one, though, that I remembered taking in 1990 or \u002791.\\n\\n Sometimes even an untalented photographer can take a good picture ¡ª ¡ª if seven hundred monkeys spent seven hundred years bashing away at seven hundred typewriters, and all that ¡ª and this was good. In it Jo was standing on the float with the sun going down red-gold behind her. She was just out of the water, dripping wet, wearing a two-piece swimming suit, gray with red piping. I had caught her laughing and brushing her soaked hair back from her forehead and temples. Her nipples were very prominent against the cups of her halter. She looked like an actress on a movie poster for one of those guilty-pleasure B-pictures about monsters at Party Beach or a serial killer stalking the campus.\\n\\n I was sucker-punched by a sudden powerful lust for her. I wanted her upstairs just as she was in that photograph, with strands of her hair pasted to her cheeks and that wet bathing suit clinging to her. I wanted to suck her nipples through the halter top, taste the cloth and feel their hardness through it. I wanted to suck water out of the cotton like milk, then yank the bottom of her suit off and fuck her until we both exploded.\\n\\n Hands shaking a little, I put the photograph aside, with some others I liked (although there were no others I liked in quite that same way). I had a huge hard-on, one of those ones that feel like stone covered with skin. Get one of those and until it goes away you are good for nothing.\\n\\n The quickest way to solve a problem like that when there\u0027s no woman around willing to help you solve it is to masturbate, but that time the idea never even crossed my mind. Instead I walked restlessly through the upstairs rooms of my house with my fists opening and closing and what looked like a hood ornament stuffed down the front of my jeans.\\n\\n Anger may be a normal stage of the grieving process ¡ª I\u0027ve read that it is ¡ª but I was never angry at Johanna in the wake of her death until the day I found that picture. Then, wow. There I was, walking around with a boner that just wouldn\u0027t quit, furious with her. Stupid bitch, why had she been running on one of the hottest days of the year? Stupid, inconsiderate bitch to leave me alone like this, not even able to work.\\n\\n I sat down on the stairs and wondered what I should do. A drink was what I should do, I decided, and then maybe another drink to scratch the first one\u0027s back. I actually got up before deciding that wasn\u0027t a very good idea at all.\\n\\n I went into my office instead, turned on the computer, and did a crossword puzzle. That night when I went to bed, I thought of looking at the picture of Jo in her bathing suit again. I decided that was almost as bad an idea as a few drinks when I was feeling angry and depressed. But I\u0027ll have the dream tonight, I thought as I turned off the light. I\u0027ll have the dream for sure.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t, though. My dreams of Sara Laughs seemed to be finished.\\n\\n A week\u0027s thought made the idea of at least summering at the lake seem better than ever. So, on a Saturday afternoon in early May when I calculated that any self-respecting Maine caretaker would be home watching the Red Sox, I called Bill Dean and told him I\u0027d be at my lake place from the Fourth of July or so . . . and that if things went as I hoped, I\u0027d be spending the fall and winter there as well.\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s good,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s real good news. A lot of folks down here\u0027ve missed you, Mike. Quite a few that want to condole with you about your wife, don\u0027t you know.\u0027\\n\\n Was there the faintest note of reproach in his voice, or was that just my imagination? Certainly Jo and I had cast a shadow in the area; we had made significant contributions to the little library which served the Motton-Kashwakamak-Castle View area, and Jo had headed the successful fund drive to get an area bookmobile up and running. In addition to that, she had been part of a ladies\u0027 sewing circle (afghans were her specialty), and a member in good standing of the Castle County Crafts Co-op. Visits to the sick . . . helping out with the annual volunteer fire department blood drive . . . womaning a booth during Summerfest in Castle Rock . . . and stuff like that was only where she had started. She didn\u0027t do it in any ostentatious Lady Bountiful way, either, but unobtrusively and humbly, with her head lowered (often to hide a rather sharp smile, I should add ¡ª my Jo had a Biercean sense of humor). Christ, I thought, maybe old Bill had a right to sound reproachful.\\n\\n \u0027People miss her,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh, they do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I still miss her a lot myself. I think that\u0027s why I\u0027ve stayed away from the lake. That\u0027s where a lot of our good times were.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I s\u0027pose so. But it\u0027ll be damned good to see you down this way. I\u0027ll get busy. The place is all right ¡ª you could move into it this afternoon, if you was a mind ¡ª but when a house has stood empty the way Sara has, it gets stale.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll get Brenda Meserve to clean the whole shebang from top to bottom. Same gal you always had, don\u0027t you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Brenda\u0027s a little old for comprehensive spring cleaning, isn\u0027t she?\u0027\\n\\n The lady in question was about sixty-five, stout, kind, and gleefully vulgar. She was especially fond of jokes about the travelling salesman who spent the night like a rabbit, jumping from hole to hole. No Mrs. Danvers she.\\n\\n \u0027Ladies like Brenda Meserve never get too old to oversee the festivities,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027She\u0027ll get two or three girls to do the vacuuming and heavy lifting. Set you back maybe three hundred dollars. Sound all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like a bargain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The well needs to be tested, and the gennie, too, although I\u0027m sure both of em\u0027s okay. I seen a hornet\u0027s nest by Jo\u0027s old studio that I want to smoke before the woods get dry. Oh, and the roof of the old house ¡ª you know, the middle piece ¡ª needs to be reshingled. I shoulda talked to you about that last year, but with you not using the place, I let her slide. You stand good for that, too?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, up to ten grand. Beyond that, call me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If we have to go over ten, I\u0027ll smile and kiss a pig.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Try to have it all done before I get down there, okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Coss. You\u0027ll want your privacy, I know that . . . just so long\u0027s you know you won\u0027t get any right away. We was shocked when she went so young; all of us were. Shocked and sad. She was a dear.\u0027 From a Yankee mouth, that word rhymes with Leah.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Bill.\u0027 I felt tears prickle my eyes. Grief is like a drunken house guest, always coming back for one more goodbye hug. \u0027Thanks for saying.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll get your share of carrot-cakes, chummy.\u0027 He laughed, but a little doubtfully, as if afraid he was committing an impropriety. \u0027I can eat a lot of carrot-cake,\u0027 I said, \u0027and if folks overdo it, well, hasn\u0027t Kenny Auster still got that big Irish wolfhound?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yuh, that thing\u0027d eat cake til he busted!\u0027 Bill cried in high good humor. He cackled until he was coughing. I waited, smiling a little myself. \u0027Blueberry, he calls that dog, damned if I know why. Ain\u0027t he the gormiest thing!\u0027 I assumed he meant the dog and not the dog\u0027s master. Kenny Auster, not much more than five feet tall and neatly made, was the opposite of gormy, that peculiar Maine adjective that means clumsy, awkward, and clay-footed.\\n\\n I suddenly realized that I missed these people ¡ª Bill and Brenda and Buddy Jellison and Kenny Auster and all the others who lived year-round at the lake. I even missed Blueberry, the Irish wolfhound, who trotted everywhere with his head up just as if he had half a brain in it and long strands of saliva depending from his jaws.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve also got to get down there and clean up the winter blowdown,\u0027 Bill said. He sounded embarrassed. \u0027It ain\u0027t bad this year ¡ª that last big storm was all snow over our way, thank God ¡ª but there\u0027s still a fair amount of happy crappy I ain\u0027t got to yet. I shoulda put it behind me long before now. You not using the place ain\u0027t an excuse. I been cashing your checks.\u0027 There was something amusing about listening to the grizzled old fart beating his breast; Jo would have kicked her feet and giggled, I\u0027m quite sure.\\n\\n \u0027If everything\u0027s right and running by July Fourth, Bill, I\u0027ll be happy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll be happy as a clam in a mudflat, then. That\u0027s a promise.\u0027 Bill sounded as happy as a clam in a mudflat himself, and I was glad. \u0027Goingter come down and write a book by the water? Like in the old days? Not that the last couple ain\u0027t been fine, my wife couldn\u0027t put that last one down, but ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said, which was the truth. And then an idea struck me. \u0027Bill, would you do me a favor before you clean up the driveway and turn Brenda Meserve loose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Happy to if I can,\u0027 he said, so I told him what I wanted.\\n\\n Four days later, I got a little package with this laconic return address: DEAN/GEN DELIV/TR-90 (DARK SCORE). I opened it and shook out twenty photographs which had been taken with one of those little cameras you use once and then throw away.\\n\\n Bill had filled out the roll with various views of the house, most conveying that subtle air of neglect a place gets when it\u0027s not used enough . . . even a place that\u0027s caretook (to use Bill\u0027s word) gets that neglected feel after awhile.\\n\\n I barely glanced at these. The first four were the ones I wanted, and I lined them up on the kitchen table, where the strong sunlight would fall directly on them. Bill had taken these from the top of the driveway, pointing the disposable camera down at the sprawl of Sara Laughs. I could see the moss which had grown not only on south wings, as well. I could see the litter of fallen branches and the drifts of pine needles on the driveway. Bill must have been tempted to clear all that away before taking his snaps, but he hadn\u0027t. I\u0027d told him exactly what I wanted ¡ª \u0027warts and all\u0027 was the phrase I had used ¡ª and Bill had given it to me.\\n\\n The bushes on either side of the driveway had thickened a lot since Jo and I had spent any significant amount of time at the lake; they hadn\u0027t exactly run wild, but yes, some of the longer branches did seem to yearn toward each other across the asphalt like separated lovers.\\n\\n Yet what my eye came back to again and again was the stoop at the foot of the driveway. The other resemblances between the photographs and my dreams of Sara Laughs might only be coincidental (or the writer\u0027s often surprisingly practical imagination at work), but I could explain the sunflowers growing out through the boards of the stoop no more than I had been able to explain the cut on the back of my hand.\\n\\n I turned one of the photos over. On the back, in a spidery script, Bill had written: These fellows are way early . . . and trespassing!\\n\\n I flipped back to the picture side. Three sunflowers, growing up through the boards of the stoop. Not two, not four, but three large sunflowers with faces like searchlights.\\n\\n Just like the ones in my dream. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-6.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
