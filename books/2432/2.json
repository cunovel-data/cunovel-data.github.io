{"id":78347,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"On a very hot day in August of 1994, my wife told me she was going down to the Derry Rite Aid to pick up a refill on her sinus medicine prescription ¡ª this is stuff you can buy over the counter these days, I believe. I\u0027d finished my writing for the day and offered to pick it up for her. She said thanks, but she wanted to get a piece of fish at the supermarket next door anyway; two birds with one stone and all of that. She blew a kiss at me off the palm of her hand and went out. The next time I saw her, she was on TV. That\u0027s how you identify the dead here in Derry ¡ª no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the walls and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out of a chilly drawer on casters; you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope. The Rite Aid and the Shopwell are less than a mile from our house, in a little neighborhood strip mall which also supports a video store, a used-book store named Spread It Around (they do a very brisk business in my old paperbacks), a Radio Shack, and a Fast Foto. It\u0027s on Up-Mile Hill, at the intersection of Witcham and Jackson. She parked in front of Blockbuster Video, went into the drugstore, and did business with Mr. Joe Wyzer, who was the druggist in those days; he has since moved on to the Rite Aid in Bangor. At the checkout she picked up one of those little chocolates with marshmallow inside, this one in the shape of a mouse. I found it later, in her purse. I unwrapped it and ate it myself, sitting at the kitchen table with the contents of her red handbag spread out in front of me, and it was like taking Communion. When it was gone except for the taste of chocolate on my tongue and in my throat, I burst into tears. I sat there in the litter of her Kleenex and makeup and keys and half-finished rolls of Certs and cried with my hands over my eyes, the way a kid cries. The sinus inhaler was in a Rite Aid bag. It had cost twelve dollars and eighteen cents. There was something else in the bag, too ¡ª an item which had cost twenty-two-fifty. I looked at this other item for a long time, seeing it but not understanding it. I was surprised, maybe even stunned, but the idea that Johanna Arlen Noonan might have been leading another life, one I knew nothing about, never crossed my mind. Not then. Jo left the register, walked out into the bright, hammering sun again, swapping her regular glasses for her prescription sunglasses as she did, and just as she stepped from beneath the drugstore\u0027s slight overhang (I am imagining a little here, I suppose, crossing over into the country of the novelist a little, but not by much; only by inches, and you can trust me on that), there was that shrewish howl of locked tires on pavement that means there\u0027s going to be either an accident or a very close call. This time it happened ¡ª the sort of accident which happened at that stupid X-shaped intersection at least once a week, it seemed. A 1989 Toyota was pulling out of the shopping-center parking lot and turning left onto Jackson Street. Behind the wheel was Mrs. Esther Easterling of Barrett\u0027s Orchards. She was accompanied by her friend Mrs Irene Deorsey, also of Barrett\u0027s Orchards, who had shopped the video store without finding anything she wanted to rent. Too much violence, Irene said. Both women were cigarette widows. Esther could hardly have missed the orange Public Works dump truck coming down the hill; although she denied this to the police, to the newspaper, and to me when I talked to her some two months later, I think it likely that she just forgot to look. As my own mother (another cigarette widow) used to say, \u0027The two most common ailments of the elderly are arthritis and forgetfulness. They can\u0027t be held responsible for neither.\u0027 Driving the Public Works truck was William Fraker, of Old Cape. Mr. Fraker was thirty-eight years old on the day of my wife\u0027s death, driving with his shirt off and thinking how badly he wanted a cool shower and a cold beer, not necessarily in that order. He and three other men had spent eight hours putting down asphalt patch out on the Harris Avenue Extension near the airport, a hot job on a hot day, and Bill Fraker said yeah, he might have been going a little too fast ¡ª maybe forty in a thirty-mile-an-hour zone. He was eager to get back to the garage, sign off on the truck, and get behind the wheel of his own F-150, which had air conditioning. Also, the dump truck\u0027s brakes, while good enough to pass inspection, were a long way from tip-top condition. Fraker hit them as soon as he saw the Toyota pull out in front of him (he hit his horn, as well), but it was too late. He heard screaming tires ¡ª his own, and Esther\u0027s as she belatedly realized her danger ¡ª and saw her face for just a moment. \u0027That was the worst part, somehow,\u0027 he told me as we sat on his porch, drinking beers ¡ª it was October by then, and although the sun was warm on our faces, we were both wearing sweaters. \u0027You know how high up you sit in one of those dump trucks? \u0027 I nodded. \u0027Well, she was looking up to see me ¡ª craning up, you\u0027d say ¡ª and the sun was full in her face. I could see how old she was. I remember thinking, \u0027Holy shit, she\u0027s gonna break like glass if I can\u0027t stop.\u0027 But old people are tough, more often than not. They can surprise you. I mean, look at how it turned out, both those old biddies still alive, and your wife . . . \u0027 He stopped then, bright red color dashing into his cheeks, making him look like a boy who has been laughed at in the schoolyard by girls who have noticed his fly is unzipped. It was comical, but if I\u0027d smiled, it only would have confused him. \u0027Mr. Noonan, I\u0027m sorry. My mouth just sort of ran away with me.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 I told him. \u0027I\u0027m over the worst of it, anyway.\u0027 That was a lie, but it put us back on track. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he said, \u0027we hit. There was a loud bang, and a crumping sound when the driver\u0027s side of the car caved in. Breaking glass, too. I was thrown against the wheel hard enough so I couldn\u0027t draw a breath without it hurting for a week or more, and I had a big bruise right here.\u0027 He drew an arc on his chest just below the collarbones. \u0027I banged my head on the windshield hard enough to crack the glass, but all I got up there was a little purple knob . . . no bleeding, not even a headache. My wife says I\u0027ve just got a naturally thick skull. I saw the woman driving the Toyota, Mrs. Easterling, thrown across the console between the front bucket seats. Then we were finally stopped, all tangled together in the middle of the street, and I got out to see how bad they were. I tell you, I expected to find them both dead.\u0027 Neither of them was dead, neither of them was even unconscious, although Mrs. Easterling had three broken ribs and a dislocated hip. Mrs. Deorsey, who had been a seat away from the impact, suffered a concussion when she rapped her head on her window. That was all; she was \u0027treated and released at Home Hospital,\u0027 as the Derry News always puts it in such cases. My wife, the former Johanna Arlen of Malden, Massachusetts, saw it all from where she stood outside the drugstore, with her purse slung over her shoulder and her prescription bag in one hand. Like Bill Fraker, she must have thought the occupants of the Toyota were either dead or seriously hurt. The sound of the collision had been a hollow, authoritative bang which rolled through the hot afternoon air like a bowling ball down an alley. The sound of breaking glass edged it like jagged lace. The two vehicles were tangled violently together in the middle of Jackson Street, the dirty orange truck looming over the pale-blue import like a bullying parent over a cowering child. Johanna began to sprint across the parking lot toward the street. Others were doing the same all around her. One of them, Miss Jill Dunbarry, had been window-shopping at Radio Shack when the accident occurred. She said she thought she remembered running past Johanna ¡ª at least she was pretty sure she remembered someone in yellow slacks ¡ª but she couldn\u0027t be sure. By then, Mrs. Easterling was screaming that she was hurt, they were both hurt, wouldn\u0027t somebody help her and her friend Irene. Halfway across the parking lot, near a little cluster of newspaper dispensers, my wife fell down. Her purse-strap stayed over her shoulder, but her prescription bag slipped from her hand, and the sinus inhaler slid halfway out. The other item stayed put. No one noticed her lying there by the newspaper dispensers; everyone was focused on the tangled vehicles, the screaming women, the spreading puddle of water and antifreeze from the Public Works truck\u0027s ruptured radiator. (\u0027That\u0027s gas!\u0027 the clerk from Fast Foto shouted to anyone who would listen. \u0027That\u0027s gas, watch out she don\u0027t blow, fellas!\u0027) I suppose one or two of the would-be rescuers might have jumped right over her, perhaps thinking she had fainted. To assume such a thing on a day when the temperature was pushing ninety-five degrees would not have been unreasonable. Roughly two dozen people from the shopping center clustered around the accident; another four dozen or so came running over from Strawford Park, where a baseball game had been going on. I imagine that all the things you would expect to hear in such situations were said, many of them more than once. Milling around. Someone reaching through the misshapen hole which had been the driver\u0027s-side window to pat Esther\u0027s trembling old hand. People immediately giving way for Joe Wyzer; at such moments anyone in a white coat automatically becomes the belle of the ball. In the distance, the warble of an ambulance siren rising like shaky air over an incinerator. All during this, lying unnoticed in the parking lot, was my wife with her purse still over her shoulder (inside, still wrapped in foil, her uneaten chocolate-marshmallow mouse) and her white prescription bag near one outstretched hand. It was Joe Wyzer, hurrying back to the pharmacy to get a compression bandage for Irene Deorsey\u0027s head, who spotted her. He recognized her even though she was lying face-down. He recognized her by her red hair, white blouse, and yellow slacks. He recognized her because he had waited on her not fifteen minutes before. \u0027Mrs. Noonan?\u0027 he asked, forgetting all about the compression bandage for the dazed but apparently not too badly hurt Irene Deorsey. \u0027Mrs. Noonan, are you all right?\u0027 Knowing already (or so I suspect; perhaps I am wrong) that she was not. He turned her over. It took both hands to do it, and even then he had to work hard, kneeling and pushing and lifting there in the parking lot with the heat baking down from above and then bouncing back up from the asphalt. Dead people put on weight, it seems to me; both in their flesh and in our minds, they put on weight. There were red marks on her face. When I identified her I could see them clearly even on the video monitor. I started to ask the assistant medical examiner what they were, but then I knew. Late August, hot pavement, elementary, my dear Watson. My wife died getting a sunburn. Wyzer got up, saw that the ambulance had arrived, and ran toward it. He pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed one of the attendants as he got out from behind the wheel. \u0027There\u0027s a woman over there,\u0027 Wyzer said, pointing toward the parking lot. \u0027Guy, we\u0027ve got two women right here, and a man as well,\u0027 the attendant said. He tried to pull away, but Wyzer held on. \u0027Never mind them right now,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027re basically okay. The woman over there isn\u0027t.\u0027 The woman over there was dead, and I\u0027m pretty sure Joe Wyzer knew it . . . but he had his priorities straight. Give him that. And he was convincing enough to get both paramedics moving away from the tangle of truck and Toyota, in spite of Esther Easterling\u0027s cries of pain and the rumbles of protest from the Greek chorus. When they got to my wife, one of the paramedics was quick to confirm what Joe Wyzer had already suspected. \u0027Holy shit,\u0027 the other one said. \u0027What happened to her?\u0027 \u0027Heart, most likely,\u0027 the first one said. \u0027She got excited and it just blew out on her.\u0027 But it wasn\u0027t her heart. The autopsy revealed a brain aneurysm which she might have been living with, all unknown, for as long as five years. As she sprinted across the parking lot toward the accident, that weak vessel in her cerebral cortex had blown like a tire, drowning her control-centers in blood and killing her. Death had probably not been instantaneous, the assistant medical examiner told me, but it had still come swiftly enough . . . and she wouldn\u0027t have suffered. Just one big black nova, all sensation and thought gone even before she hit the pavement. \u0027Can I help you in any way, Mr. Noonan?\u0027 the assistant ME asked, turning me gently away from the still face and closed eyes on the video monitor. \u0027Do you have questions? I\u0027ll answer them if I can.\u0027 \u0027Just one,\u0027 I said. I told him what she\u0027d purchased in the drugstore just before she died. Then I asked my question. The days leading up to the funeral and the funeral itself are dreamlike in my memory ¡ª the clearest memory I have is of eating Jo\u0027s chocolate mouse and crying . . . crying mostly, I think, because I knew how soon the taste of it would be gone. I had one other crying fit a few days after we buried her, and I will tell you about that one shortly. I was glad for the arrival of Jo\u0027s family, and particularly for the arrival of her oldest brother, Frank. It was Frank Arlen ¡ª fifty, red-cheeked, portly, and with a head of lush dark hair ¡ª who organized the arrangements . . . who wound up actually dickering with the funeral director. \u0027I can\u0027t believe you did that,\u0027 I said later, as we sat in a booth at Jack\u0027s Pub, drinking beers. \u0027He was trying to stick it to you, Mikey,\u0027 he said. \u0027I hate guys like that.\u0027 He reached into his back pocket, brought out a handkerchief, and wiped absently at his cheeks with it. He hadn\u0027t broken down ¡ª none of the Arlens broke down, at least not when I was with them ¡ª but Frank had leaked steadily all day; he looked like a man suffering from severe conjunctivitis. There had been six Arlen sibs in all, Jo the youngest and the only girl. She had been the pet of her big brothers. I suspect that if I\u0027d had anything to do with her death, the five of them would have torn me apart with their bare hands. As it was, they formed a protective shield around me instead, and that was good. I suppose I might have muddled through without them, but I don\u0027t know how. I was thirty-six, remember. You don\u0027t expect to have to bury your wife when you\u0027re thirty-six and she herself is two years younger. Death was the last thing on our minds. \u0027If a guy gets caught taking your stereo out of your car, they call it theft and put him in jail,\u0027 Frank said. The Arlens had come from Massachusetts, and I could still hear Malden in Frank\u0027s voice ¡ª caught was coowat, car was cah, call was caul. \u0027If the same guy is trying to sell a grieving husband a three-thousand-dollar casket for forty-five hundred dollars, they call it business and ask him to speak at the Rotary Club luncheon. Greedy asshole, I fed him his lunch, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027Yes. You did.\u0027 \u0027You okay, Mikey?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m okay.\u0027 \u0027Sincerely okay?\u0027 \u0027How the fuck should I know?\u0027 I asked him, loud enough to turn some heads in a nearby booth. And then: \u0027She was pregnant.\u0027 His face grew very still. \u0027What?\u0027 I struggled to keep my voice down. \u0027Pregnant. Six or seven weeks, according to the . . . you know, the autopsy. Did you know? Did she tell you?\u0027 \u0027No! Christ, no!\u0027 But there was a funny look on his face, as if she had told him something. \u0027I knew you were trying, of course . . . she said you had a low sperm count and it might take a little while, but the doctor thought you guys\u0027d probably . . . sooner or later you\u0027d probably . . . \u0027 He trailed off, looking down at his hands. \u0027They can tell that, huh? They check for that?\u0027 \u0027They can tell. As for checking, I don\u0027t know if they do it automatically or not. I asked.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027She didn\u0027t just buy sinus medicine before she died. She also bought one of those home pregnancy-testing kits.\u0027 \u0027You had no idea? No clue?\u0027 I shook my head. He reached across the table and squeezed my shoulder. \u0027She wanted to be sure, that\u0027s all. You know that, don\u0027t you?\u0027 A refill on my sinus medicine and a piece of fish, she\u0027d said. Looking like always. A woman off to run a couple of errands. We had been trying to have a kid for eight years, but she had looked just like always. \u0027Sure,\u0027 I said, patting Frank\u0027s hand. \u0027Sure, big guy. I know.\u0027 It was the Arlens ¡ª led by Frank who handled Johanna\u0027s send off. As the writer of the family, I was assigned the obituary. My brother came up from Virginia with my mom and my aunt and was allowed to tend the guest-book at the viewings. My mother ¡ª almost completely ga-ga at the age of sixty-six, although the doctors refused to call it Alzheimer\u0027s ¡ª lived in Memphis with her sister, two years younger and only slightly less wonky. They were in charge of cutting the cake and the pies at the funeral reception. Everything else was arranged by the Arlens, from the viewing hours to the components of the funeral ceremony. Frank and Victor, the second-youngest brother, spoke brief tributes. Jo\u0027s dad offered a prayer for his daughter\u0027s soul. And at the end, Pete Breedlove, the boy who cut our grass in the summer and raked our yard in the fall, brought everyone to tears by singing \u0027Blessed Assurance,\u0027 which Frank said had been Jo\u0027s favorite hymn as a girl. How Frank found Pete and persuaded him to sing at the funeral is something I never found out. We got through it ¡ª the afternoon and evening viewings on Tuesday, the funeral service on Wednesday morning, then the little pray-over at Fairlawn Cemetery. What I remember most was thinking how hot it was, how lost I felt without having Jo to talk to, and that I wished I had bought a new pair of shoes. Jo would have pestered me to death about the ones I was wearing, if she had been there. Later on I talked to my brother, Sid, told him we had to do something about our mother and Aunt Francine before the two of them disappeared completely into the Twilight Zone. They were too young for a nursing home; what did Sid advise? He advised something, but I\u0027ll be damned if I know what it was. I agreed to it, I remember that, but not what it was. Later that day, Siddy, our mom, and our aunt climbed back into Siddy\u0027s rental car for the drive to Boston, where they would spend the night and then grab the Southern Crescent the following day. My brother is happy enough to chaperone the old folks, but he doesn\u0027t fly, even if the tickets are on me. He claims there are no breakdown lanes in the sky if the engine quits. Most of the Arlens left the next day. Once more it was dog-hot, the sun glaring out of a white-haze sky and lying on everything like melted brass. They stood in front of our house ¡ª which had become solely my house\u0027 by then ¡ª with three taxis lined up at the curb behind them, big galoots hugging one another amid the litter of tote-bags and saying their goodbyes in those foggy Massachusetts accents. Frank stayed another day. We picked a big bunch of flowers behind the house ¡ª not those ghastly-smelling hothouse things whose aroma I always associate with death and organ-music but real flowers, the kind Jo liked best ¡ª and stuck them in a couple of coffee cans I found in the back pantry. We went out to Fairlawn and put them on the new grave. Then we just sat there for awhile under the beating sun. \u0027She was always just the sweetest thing in my life,\u0027 Frank said at last in a strange, muffled voice. \u0027We took care of Jo when we were kids. Us guys. No one messed with Jo, I\u0027ll tell you. Anyone tried, we\u0027d feed em their lunch.\u0027 \u0027She told me a lot of stories.\u0027 \u0027Good ones?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, real good.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m going to miss her so much.\u0027 \u0027Me, too,\u0027 I said. \u0027Frank . . . listen . . . I know you were her favorite brother. She never called you, maybe just to say that she missed a period or was feeling whoopsy in the morning? You can tell me. I won\u0027t be pissed.\u0027 \u0027But she didn\u0027t. Honest to God. Was she whoopsy in the morning?\u0027 \u0027Not that I saw.\u0027 And that was just it. I hadn\u0027t seen anything. Of course I\u0027d been writing, and when I write I pretty much trance out. But she knew where I went in those trances. She could have found me and shaken me fully awake. Why hadn\u0027t she? Why would she hide good news? Not wanting to tell me until she was sure was plausible . . . but it somehow wasn\u0027t Jo. \u0027Was it a boy or a girl?\u0027 he asked. \u0027A girl.\u0027 We\u0027d had names picked out and waiting for most of our marriage. A boy would have been Andrew. Our daughter would have been Kia. Kia Jane Noonan. Frank, divorced six years and on his own, had been staying with me. On our way back to the house he said, \u0027I worry about you, Mikey. You haven\u0027t got much family to fall back on at a time like this, and what you do have is far away.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 I said. He nodded. \u0027That\u0027s what we say, anyway, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027We?\u0027 \u0027Guys. I\u0027ll be all right.\u0027 And if we\u0027re not, we try to make sure no one knows it.\u0027 He looked at me, eyes still leaking, handkerchief in one big sunburned hand. \u0027If you\u0027re not all right, Mikey, and you don\u0027t want to call your brother ¡ª I saw the way you looked at him ¡ª let me be your brother. For Jo\u0027s sake if not your own.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 I said, respecting and appreciating the offer, also knowing I would do no such thing. I don\u0027t call people for help. It\u0027s not because of the way I was raised, at least I don\u0027t think so; it\u0027s the way I was made. Johanna once said that if I was drowning at Dark Score Lake, where we have a summer home, I would die silently fifty feet out from the public beach rather than yell for help. It\u0027s not a question of love or affection. I can give those and I can take them. I feel pain like anyone else. I need to touch and be touched. But if someone asks me, \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 I can\u0027t answer no. I can\u0027t say help me. A couple of hours later Frank left for the southern end of the state. When he opened the car door, I was touched to see that the taped book he was listening to was one of mine. He hugged me, then surprised me with a kiss on the mouth, a good hard smack. \u0027If you need to talk, call,\u0027 he said. \u0027And if you need to be with someone, just come.\u0027 I nodded. \u0027And be careful.\u0027 That startled me. The combination of heat and grief had made me feel as if I had been living in a dream for the last few days, but that got through. \u0027Careful of what?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t know, Mikey.\u0027 Then he got into his car ¡ª he was so big and it was so little that he looked as if he were wearing it ¡ª and drove away. The sun was going down by then. Do you know how the sun looks at the end of a hot day in August, all orange and somehow squashed, as if an invisible hand were pushing down on the top of it and at any moment it might just pop like an overfilled mosquito and splatter all over the horizon? It was like that. In the east, where it was already dark, thunder was rumbling. But there was no rain that night, only a dark that came down as thick and stifling as a blanket. All the same, I slipped in front of the word processor and wrote for an hour or so. It went pretty well, as I remember. And you know, even when it doesn\u0027t, it passes the time. My second crying fit came three or four days after the funeral. That sense of being in a dream persisted ¡ª I walked, I talked, I answered the phone, I worked on my book, which had been about eighty percent complete when Jo died ¡ª but all the time there was this clear sense of disconnection, a feeling that everything was going on at a distance from the real me, that I was more or less phoning it in. Denise Breedlove, Pete\u0027s mother, called and asked if I wouldn\u0027t like her to bring a couple of her friends over one day the following week and give the big old Edwardian pile I now lived in alone ¡ª rolling around in it like the last pea in a restaurant-sized can ¡ª a good stem-to-stern cleaning. They would do it, she said, for a hundred dollars split even among the three of them, and mostly because it wasn\u0027t good for me to go on without it. There had to be a scrubbing after a death, she said, even if the death didn\u0027t happen in the house itself. I told her it was a fine idea, but I would pay her and the women she brought a hundred dollars each for six hours\u0027 work. At the end of the six hours, I wanted the job done. And if it wasn\u0027t, I told her, it would be done, anyway. \u0027Mr. Noonan, that\u0027s far too much,\u0027 she said. \u0027Maybe and maybe not, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m paying,\u0027 I said. \u0027Will you do it?\u0027 She said she would, of course she would. Perhaps predictably, I found myself going through the house on the evening before they came, doing a pre-cleaning inspection. I guess I didn\u0027t want the women (two of whom would be complete strangers to me) finding anything that would embarrass them or me: a pair of Johanna\u0027s silk panties stuffed down behind the sofa cushions, perhaps (\u0027We are often overcome on the sofa, Michael,\u0027 she said to me once, \u0027have you noticed?\u0027), or beer cans under the loveseat on the sunporch, maybe even an unflushed toilet. In truth, I can\u0027t tell you any one thing I was looking for; that sense of operating in a dream still held firm control over my mind. The clearest thoughts I had during those days were either about the end of the novel I was writing (the psychotic killer had lured my heroine to a high-rise building and meant to push her off the roof) or about the Norco Home Pregnancy Test Jo had bought on the day she died. Sinus prescription, she had said. Piece of fish for supper, she had said. And her eyes had shown me nothing else I needed to look at twice. Near the end of my \u0027pre-cleaning,\u0027 I looked under our bed and saw an open paperback on Jo\u0027s side. She hadn\u0027t been dead long, but few household lands are so dusty as the Kingdom of Underbed, and the light-gray coating I saw on the book when I brought it out made me think of Johanna\u0027s face and hands in her coffin ¡ª Jo in the Kingdom of Underground. Did it get dusty inside a coffin? Surely not, but ¡ª I pushed the thought away. It pretended to go, but all day long it kept creeping back, like Tolstoy\u0027s white bear. Johanna and I had both been English majors at the University of Maine, and like many others, I reckon, we fell in love to the sound of Shakespeare and the Tilbury Town cynicism of Edwin Arlington Robinson. Yet the writer who had bound us closest together was no college-friendly poet or essayist but W. Somerset Maugham, that elderly globetrotting novelist-playwright with the reptile\u0027s face (always obscured by cigarette smoke in his photographs, it seems) and the romantic\u0027s heart. So it did not surprise me much to find that the book under the bed was The Moon and Sixpence. I had read it myself as a late teenager, not once but twice, identifying passionately with the character of Charles Strickland. (It was writing I wanted to do in the South Seas, of course, not painting.) She had been using a playing card from some defunct deck as her place-marker, and as I opened the book, I thought of something she had said when I was first getting to know her. In Twentieth-Century British Lit, this had been, probably in 1980. Johanna Arlen had been a fiery little sophomore. I was a senior, picking up the Twentieth-Century Brits simply because I had time on my hands that last semester. \u0027A hundred years from now,\u0027 she had said, \u0027the shame of the mid-twentieth-century literary critics will be that they embraced Lawrence and ignored Maugham.\u0027 This was greeted with contemptuously good-natured laughter (they all knew Women in Love was one of the greatest damn books ever written), but I didn\u0027t laugh. I fell in love. The playing card marked pages 102 and 103 ¡ª Dirk Stroeve has just discovered that his wife has left him for Strickland, Maugham\u0027s version of Paul Gauguin. The narrator tries to buck Stroeve up. My dear fellow, don\u0027t be unhappy. She\u0027ll come back . . . \u0027Easy for you to say,\u0027 I murmured to the room which now belonged just to me. I turned the page and read this: Strickland\u0027s injurious calm robbed Stroeve of his self-control Blind rage seized him, and without knowing what he was doing he flung himself on Strickland. Strickland was taken by surprise and he staggered, but he was very strong, even after his illness, and in a moment, he did not exactly know how, Stroeve found himself on the floor. \u0027You funny little man,\u0027 said Strickland. It occurred to me that Jo was never going to turn the page and hear Strickland call the pathetic Stroeve a funny little man. In a moment of brilliant epiphany I have never forgotten ¡ª how could I? it was one of the worst moments of my life ¡ª I understood it wasn\u0027t a mistake that would be rectified, or a dream from which I would awaken. Johanna was dead. My strength was robbed by grief. If the bed hadn\u0027t been there, I would have fallen to the floor. We weep from our eyes, it\u0027s all we can do, but on that evening I felt as if every pore of my body were weeping, every crack and cranny. I sat there on her side of the bed, with her dusty paperback copy of The Moon and Sixpence in my hand, and I wailed. I think it was surprise as much as pain; in spite of the corpse I had seen and identified on a high-resolution video monitor, in spite of the funeral and Pete Breedlove singing \u0027Blessed Assurance\u0027 in his high, sweet tenor voice, in spite of the graveside service with its ashes to ashes and dust to dust, I hadn\u0027t really believed it. The Penguin paperback did for me what the big gray coffin had not: it insisted she was dead. You funny little man, said Strickland. I lay back on our bed, crossed my forearms over my face, and cried myself to sleep that way as children do when they\u0027re unhappy. I had an awful dream. In it I woke up, saw the paperback of The Moon and Sixpence still lying on the coverlet beside me, and decided to put it back under the bed where I had found it. You know how confused dreams are ¡ª logic like Dal¨ª clocks gone so soft they lie over the branches of trees like throw-rugs. I put the playing-card bookmark back between pages 102 and 103 ¡ª a turn of the index finger away from You funny little man, said Strickland now and forever ¡ª and rolled onto my side, hanging my head over the edge of the bed, meaning to put the book back exactly where I had found it. Jo was lying there amid the dust-kitties. A strand of cobweb hung down from the bottom of the box spring and caressed her cheek like a feather. Her red hair looked dull, but her eyes were dark and alert and baleful in her white face. And when she spoke, I knew that death had driven her insane. \u0027Give me that,\u0027 she hissed. \u0027It\u0027s my dust-catcher.\u0027 She snatched it out of my hand before I could offer it to her. For a moment our fingers touched, and hers were as cold as twigs after a frost. She opened the book to her place, the playing card fluttering out, and placed Somerset Maugham over her face ¡ª a shroud of words. As she crossed her hands on her bosom and lay still, I realized she was wearing the blue dress I had buried her in. She had come out of her grave to hide under our bed. I awoke with a muffled cry and a painful jerk that almost tumbled me off the side of the bed. I hadn\u0027t been asleep long ¡ª the tears were still damp on my cheeks, and my eyelids had that funny stretched feel they get after a bout of weeping. The dream had been so vivid that I had to roll on my side, hang my head down, and peer under the bed, sure she would be there with the book over her face, that she would reach out with her cold fingers to touch me. There was nothing there, of course ¡ª dreams are just dreams. Nevertheless, I spent the rest of the night on the couch in my study. It was the right choice, I guess, because there were no more dreams that night. Only the nothingness of good sleep.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-2.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
