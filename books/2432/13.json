{"id":78358,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"During my hike back down the lane to the house, I tried to think about nothing at all. My first editor used to say that eighty-five percent of what goes on in a novelist\u0027s head is none of his business, a sentiment I\u0027ve never believed should be restricted to just writers. So-called higher thought is, by and large, highly overrated. When trouble comes and steps have to be taken, I find it\u0027s generally better to just stand aside and let the boys in the basement do their work. That\u0027s blue-collar labor down there, non-union guys with lots of muscles and tattoos.\\n\\n Instinct is their specialty, and they refer problems upstairs for actual cogitation only as a last resort.\\n\\n When I tried to call Mattie Devore, an extremely peculiar thing happened ¡ª one that had nothing at all ro do with spooks, as far as I could tell. Instead of an open-hum line when I pushed the cordless\u0027s on button, I got silence. Then, just as I was thinking I must have left the phone in the north bedroom off the hook, I realized it wasn\u0027t complete silence. Distant as a radio transmission from deep space, cheerful and quacky as an animated duck, some guy with a fair amount of Brooklyn in his voice was singing: \u0027He followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day. Followed her to school one day, which was against the rule . . . \u0027\\n\\n I opened my mouth to ask who was there, but before I could, a woman\u0027s voice said \u0027Hello?\u0027 She sounded perplexed and doubtful.\\n\\n \u0027Mattie?\u0027 In my confusion it never occurred to me to call her something more formal, like Ms. or Mrs. Devore. Nor did it seem odd that I should know who it was, based on a single word, even though our only previous conversation had been relatively brief. Maybe the guys in the basement recognized the background music and made the connection to Kyra.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Noonan?\u0027 She sounded more bewildered than ever. \u0027The phone never even rang!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I must have picked mine up just as your call was going through,\u0027 I said. \u0027That happens from time to time.\u0027 But how many times, I wondered, did it happen when the person calling you was the one you yourself had been planning to call? Maybe quite often, actually.\\n\\n Telepathy or coincidence? Live or Memorex? Either way, it seemed almost magical. I looked across the long, low living room, into the glassy eyes of Bunter the moose, and thought: Yes, but maybe this is a magic place now.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose,\u0027 she said doubtfully. \u0027I apologize about calling in the first place ¡ª it\u0027s a presumption. Your number\u0027s unlisted, I know.\u0027\\n\\n Oh, don\u0027t worry about that, I thought. Everyone\u0027s got this old number by now. In fact, I\u0027m thinking about putting it in the Yellow Pages.\\n\\n \u0027I got it from your file at the library,\u0027 she went on, sounding embarrassed. \u0027That\u0027s where I work.\u0027 In the background, \u0027Mary Had a Little Lamb\u0027 had given way to \u0027The Farmer in the Dell.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s quite all right,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Especially since you\u0027re the person I was picking up the phone to call.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me? Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ladies first.\u0027\\n\\n She gave a brief, nervous laugh. \u0027I wanted to invite you to dinner. That is, Ki and I want to invite you to dinner. I should have done it before now. You were awfully good to us the other day. Will you come?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said with no hesitation at all. \u0027With thanks. We\u0027ve got some things to talk about, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause. In the background, the mouse was taking the cheese. As a kid I used to think all these things happened in a vast gray factory called The Hi-Ho Dairy-O.\\n\\n Mattie? Still there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s dragged you into it, hasn\u0027t he? That awful old man.\u0027 Now her voice sounded not nervous but somehow dead.\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes and no. You could argue that fate dragged me into it, or coincidence, or God. I wasn\u0027t there that morning because of Max Devore; I was chasing the elusive Villageburger.\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t laugh, but her voice brightened a little, and I was glad. People who talk in that dead, affectless way are, by and large, frightened people. Sometimes people who have been outright terrorized. \u0027I\u0027m still sorry for dragging you into my trouble.\u0027 I had an idea she might start to wonder who was dragging whom after I pitched her on John Storrow, and was glad it was a discussion I wouldn\u0027t have to have with her on the phone.\\n\\n \u0027In any case, I\u0027d love to come to dinner. When?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would this evening be too soon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s wonderful. We have to eat early, though, so my little guy doesn\u0027t fall asleep in her dessert. Is six okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ki will be excited. We don\u0027t have much company.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She hasn\u0027t been wandering again, has she?\u0027\\n\\n I thought she might be offended. Instead, this time she did laugh. \u0027God, no. All the fuss on Saturday scared her. Now she comes in to tell me if she\u0027s switching from the swing in the side yard to the sandbox in back. She\u0027s talked about you a lot, though. She calls you \u0027that tall guy who carrot me.\u0027 I think she\u0027s worried you might be mad at her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell her I\u0027m not,\u0027 I said. \u0027No, check that. I\u0027ll tell her myself. Can I bring anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bottle of wine?\u0027 she asked, a little doubtfully. \u0027Or maybe that\u0027s pretentious ¡ª I was only going to cook hamburgers on the grill and make potato salad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll bring an unpretentious bottle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 she said. \u0027This is sort of exciting. We never have company.\u0027\\n\\n I was horrified to find myself on the verge of saying that I thought it was sort of exciting, too, my first date in four years and all. \u0027Thanks so much for thinking of me.\u0027\\n\\n As I hung up I remembered John Storrow advising me to try and stay visible with her, not to hand over any extra grist for the town gossip mill. If she was barbecuing, we\u0027d probably be out where people could see we had our clothes on . . . for most of the evening, anyway. She-would, however, likely do the polite thing at some point and invite me inside. I would then do the polite thing and go. Admire her velvet Elvis painting on the wall, or her commemorative plates from the Franklin Mint, or whatever she had going in the way of trailer decoration; I\u0027d let Kyra show me her bedroom and exclaim with wonder over her excellent assortment of stuffed animals and her favorite dolly, if that was required. There are all sorts of priorities in life. Some your lawyer can understand, but I suspect there are quite a few he can\u0027t.\\n\\n \u0027Am I handling this right, Bunter?\u0027 I asked the stuffed moose. \u0027Bellow once for yes, twice for no.\u0027\\n\\n I was halfway down the hall leading to the north wing, thinking of nothing but a cool shower, when from behind me, very soft, came a brief ring of the bell around Bunter\u0027s neck. I stopped, head cocked, my shirt held in one hand, waiting for the bell to ring again. It didn\u0027t. After a minute, I went the rest of the way to the bathroom and flipped on the shower.\\n\\n The Lakeview General had a pretty good selection of wines tucked away in one corner ¡ª not much local demand for it, maybe, but the tourists probably bought a fair quantity ¡ª and I selected a bottle of Mondavi red. It was probably a bit more expensive than Mattie had had in mind, but I could peel the price-sticker off and hope she wouldn\u0027t know the difference. There was a line at the checkout, mostly folks with damp tee-shirts pulled on over their bathing suits and sand from the public beach sticking to their legs. While I was waiting my turn, my eye happened on the impulse items which are always stocked near the counter. Among them were several plastic bags labeled MAGNABET, each bag showing a cartoon refrigerator with the message BACK SOON stuck to it. According to the written info, there were two sets of consonants in each Magnabet, PLUS EXTRA VOWELS. I grabbed two sets . . . then added a third, thinking that Mattie Devore\u0027s kid was probably just the right age for such an item.\\n\\n Kyra saw me pulling into the weedy dooryard, jumped off the slumpy little swingset beside the trailer, bolted to her mother, and hid behind her. When I approached the hibachi which had been set up beside the cinderblock front steps, the child who\u0027d spoken to me so fearlessly on Saturday was just a peeking blue eye and a chubby hand grasping a fold of her mother\u0027s sundress below the hip.\\n\\n Two hours brought considerable changes, however. As twilight deepened, Kyra sat on my lap in the trailer\u0027s living room, listening carefully ¡ª if with growing wooziness ¡ª as I read her the ever-enthralling story of Cinderella. The couch we were on was a shade of brown which can by law only be sold in discount stores, and extremely lumpy into the bargain, but I still felt ashamed of my casual preconceptions about what I would find inside this trailer. On the wall above and behind us there was an Edward Hopper print ¡ª that one of a lonely lunch counter late at night ¡ª and across the room, over the small Formica-topped table in the kitchen nook, was one of Vincent van Gogh\u0027s \u0027Sunflowers\u0027. Even more than the Hopper, it looked at home in Mattie Devore\u0027s doublewide. I have no idea why that should have been true, but it was.\\n\\n \u0027Glass slipper will cut her footie,\u0027 Ki said in a muzzy, considering way.\\n\\n \u0027No way,\u0027 I said. \u0027Slipper-glass was specially made in the Kingdom of Grimoire. Smooth and unbreakable, as long as you didn\u0027t sing high C while wearing them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I get a pair?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Ki,\u0027 I said, \u0027no one knows how to make slipper-glass anymore.\\n\\n It\u0027s a lost art, like Toledo steel.\u0027 It was hot in the trailer and she was hot against my shirt, where her upper body lay, but I wouldn\u0027t have changed it. Having a kid on my lap was pretty great. Outside, her mother was singing and gathering up dishes from the card table we\u0027d used for our picnic. Hearing her sing was also pretty great.\\n\\n \u0027Go on, go on,\u0027 Kyra said, pointing to the picture of Cinderella scrubbing the floor. The little girl peeking nervously around her mother\u0027s leg was gone; the angry I\u0027m-going-to-the-damn-beach girl of Saturday morning was gone; here was only a sleepy kid who was pretty and bright and trusting. \u0027Before I can\u0027t hold it anymore.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you need to go pee-pee?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, looking at me with some disdain. \u0027Besides, that\u0027s you-rinating. Peas are what you eat with meatloaf, that\u0027s what Mattie says. And I already went. But if you don\u0027t go fast on the story, I\u0027ll fall to sleep.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t hurry stories with magic in them, Ki.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well go as fast as you can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 I turned the page. Here was Cinderella, trying to be a good sport, waving goodbye to her asshole sisters as they went off to the ball dressed like starlets at a disco.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No sooner had Cinderella said goodbye to Tammy Faye and Vanna ¡ª \u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Those are the sisters\u0027 names?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The ones I made up for them, yes. Is that okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 She settled more comfortably on my lap and dropped her head against my chest again. \u0027\u0027No sooner had Cinderella said goodbye to Tammy Faye and Vanna than a bright light suddenly appeared in the corner of the kitchen. Stepping out of it was a beautiful lady in a silver gown. The jewels in her hair glowed like stars.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fairy godmother,\u0027 Kyra said matter-of-factly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 Mattie came in carrying the remaining half-bottle of Mondavi and the blackened barbecue implements. Her sundress was bright red. On her feet she wore low-topped sneakers so white that they seemed to flash in the gloom. Her hair was tied back and although she still wasn\u0027t the gorgeous country-club babe I had briefly envisioned, she was very pretty. Now she looked at Kyra, looked at me, raised her eyebrows, made a lifting gesture with her arms. I shook my head, sending back a message that neither of us was ready quite yet.\\n\\n I resumed reading while Mattie went to work scrubbing her few cooking tools. She was still humming. By the time she had finished with the spatula, Ki\u0027s body had taken on an additional relaxation which I recognized at once ¡ª she\u0027d conked out, and hard. I closed the Little Golden Treasury of Fairy Tales and put it on the coffee-table beside a couple of other stacked books ¡ª whatever Mattie was reading, I presumed. I looked up, saw her looking back at me from the kitchen, and flicked her the V-for-Victory sign. \u0027Noonan, the winner by a technical knockout in the eighth round,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n Mattie dried her hands on a dishtowel and came over. \u0027Give her to me.\u0027\\n\\n I stood up with Kyra in my arms instead. \u0027I\u0027ll carry. Where?\u0027\\n\\n She pointed. \u0027On the left.\u0027\\n\\n I carried the baby down the hallway, which was narrow enough so I had to be careful not to bump her feet on one side or the top of her head on the other. At the end of the hall was the bathroom, stringently clean. On the right was a closed door which led, I assumed, into the bedroom Mattie had once shared with Lance Devore and where she now slept alone. If there was a boyfriend who overnighted even some of the time, Mattie had done a good job of erasing his presence from the trailer.\\n\\n I slid carefully through the door on the left and looked at the little bed with its ruffled coverlet of cabbage roses, the table with the doll-house on it, the picture of the Emerald City on one wall, the sign (done in shiny stick-on letters) on another one that read CASA KYRA. Devore wanted to take her away from here, a place where nothing was wrong ¡ª where, to the contrary, everything was perfectly right. Casa Kyra was the room of a little girl who was growing up okay.\\n\\n \u0027Put her on the bed and then go pour yourself another glass of wine,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027I\u0027ll zip her into her pj\u0027s and join you. I know we\u0027ve got stuff to talk about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 I put her down, then bent a little farther, meaning to plant a kiss on her nose. I almost thought better of it, then did it anyway. When I left, Mattie was smiling, so I guess it was okay.\\n\\n I poured myself a little more wine, walked back into the scrap of living room with it, and looked at the two books beside Ki\u0027s fairy-tale collection. I\u0027m always curious about what people are reading; the only better insight into them is the contents of their medicine cabinets, and rummaging through your host\u0027s drugs and nostrums is frowned upon by the better class.\\n\\n The books were different enough to qualify as schizoid. One, with a playing-card bookmark about three quarters of the way through, was the paperback edition of Richard North Patterson\u0027s Silent Witness. I applauded her taste; Patterson and DeMille are probably the best of the current popular novelists. The other, a hardcover tome of some weight, was The Collected Short Works of Herman Melville. About as far from Richard North Patterson as you could get. According to the faded purple ink stamped on the thickness of the pages, this volume belonged to Four Lakes Community Library. That was a lovely little stone building about five miles south of Dark Score Lake, where Route 68 passes off the TR and into Motton. Where Mattie worked, presumably. I opened to her bookmark, another playing card, and saw she was reading \u0027Bartleby.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand that,\u0027 she said from behind me, startling me so badly that I almost dropped the books. \u0027I like it ¡ª it\u0027s a good enough story ¡ª but I haven\u0027t the slightest idea what it means. The other one, now, I\u0027ve even figured out who did it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a strange pair to read in tandem,\u0027 I said, putting them back down. \u0027The Patterson I\u0027m reading for pleasure,\u0027 Mattie said. She went into the kitchen, looked briefly (and with some longing, I thought) at the bottle of wine, then opened the fridge and took out a pitcher of Kool-Aid. On the fridge door were words her daughter had already assembled from her Magnabet bag: KI and MATTIE and HOHO (Santa Claus, I presumed). \u0027Well, I\u0027m reading them both for pleasure, I guess, but we\u0027re due to discuss \u0027Bartleby\u0027 in this little group I\u0027m a part of. We meet Thursday nights at the library. I\u0027ve still got about ten pages to go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A readers\u0027 circle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh. Mrs. Briggs leads. She formed it long before I was born. She\u0027s the head librarian at Four Lakes, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do. Lindy Briggs is my caretaker\u0027s sister-in-law.\u0027\\n\\n Mattie smiled. \u0027Small world, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, it\u0027s a big world but a small town.\u0027\\n\\n She started to lean back against the counter with her glass of Kool-Aid, then thought better of it. \u0027Why don\u0027t we go outside and sit? That way anyone passing can see that we\u0027re still dressed and that we don\u0027t have anything on inside-out.\u0027\\n\\n I looked at her, startled She looked back with a kind of cynical good humor. It wasn\u0027t an expression that looked particularly at home on her face.\\n\\n \u0027I may only be twenty-one, but I\u0027m not stupid,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s watching me. I know it, and you probably do, too. On another night I might be tempted to say fuck him if he can\u0027t take a joke, but it\u0027s cooler out there and the smoke from the hibachi will keep the worst of the bugs away. Have I shocked you? If so, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t.\u0027 She had, a little. \u0027No need to apologize.\u0027\\n\\n We carried our drinks down the not-quite-steady cinderblock steps and sat side-by-side in a couple of lawn-chairs. To the left of us the coals in the hibachi glowed soft rose in the growing gloom. Mattie leaned back, placed the cold curve of her glass briefly against her forehead, then drank most of what was left, the ice cubes sliding against her teeth with a click and a rattle. Crickets hummed in the woods behind the trailer and across the road. Farther up Highway 68, I could see the bright white fluorescents over the gas island at the Lakeview General. The seat of my chair was a little baggy, the interwoven straps a little frayed, and the old girl canted pretty severely to the left, but there was still no place I\u0027d rather have been sitting just then. This evening had turned out to be a quiet little miracle. . at least, so far. We still had John Storrow to get to.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m glad you came on a Tuesday,\u0027 she said. \u0027Tuesday nights are hard for me. I\u0027m always thinking of the ballgame down at Warrington\u0027s. The guys\u0027ll be picking up the gear by now ¡ª the bats and bases and catcher\u0027s mask ¡ª -and putting it back in the storage cabinet behind home plate. Drinking their last beers and smoking their last cigarettes. That\u0027s where I met my husband, you know. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve been told all that by now.\u0027\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t see her face clearly, but I could hear the faint tinge of bitterness which had crept into her voice, and guessed she was still wearing the cynical expression. It was too old for her, but I thought she\u0027d come by it honestly enough. Although if she didn\u0027t watch out, it would take root and grow.\\n\\n \u0027I heard a version from Bill, yes ¡ª Lindy\u0027s brother-in-law.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh ayuh ¡ª our story\u0027s on retail. You can get it at the store, or the Village Cafe, or at that old blabbermouth\u0027s garage . . . which my father-in-law rescued from Western Savings, by the way. He stepped in just before the bank could foreclose. Now Dickie Brooks and his cronies think Max Devore is walking talking Jesus. I hope you got a fairer version from Mr. Dean than you\u0027d get at the All-Purpose. You must\u0027ve, or you wouldn\u0027t have risked eating hamburgers with Jezebel.\u0027\\n\\n I wanted to get away from that, if I could ¡ª her anger was understandable but useless. Of course it was easier for me to see that; it wasn\u0027t my kid who had been turned into the handkerchief tied at the center of a tug-of-war rope. \u0027They still play softball at Warrington\u0027s? Even though Devore bought the place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes indeed. He goes down to the field in his motorized wheelchair every Tuesday evening and watches. There are other things he\u0027s done since he came back here that are just attempts to buy the town\u0027s good opinion, but I think he genuinely loves the softball games. The Whit-more woman goes, too. Brings an extra oxygen tank along in a little red wheelbarrow with a whitewall tire on the front. She keeps a fielder\u0027s mitt in there, too, in case any foul pops come up over the backstop to where he sits. He caught one near the start of the season, I heard, and got a standing O from the players and the folks who come to watch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Going to the games puts him in touch with his son, you think?\u0027\\n\\n Mattie smiled grimly. \u0027I don\u0027t think Lance so much as crosses his mind, not when he\u0027s at the ballfield. They play hard at Warrington\u0027s ¡ª slide into home with their feet up, jump into the puckerbrush for the flyballs, curse each other when they do something wrong ¡ª and that\u0027s what old Max Devore enjoys, that\u0027s why he never misses a Tuesday evening game. He likes to watch them slide and get up bleeding.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that how Lance played?\\n\\n She thought about it carefully. \u0027He played hard, but he wasn\u0027t crazed. He was there just for the fun of it. We all were. We women ¡ª shit, really just us girls, Barney Therriault\u0027s wife, Cindy, was only sixteen ¡ª we\u0027d stand behind the backstop on the first-base side, smoking cigarettes or waving punks to keep the bugs away, cheering our guys when they did something good, laughing when they did something stupid. We\u0027d swap sodas or share a can of beer. I\u0027d admire Helen Geary\u0027s twins and she\u0027d kiss Ki under the chin until Ki giggled. Sometimes we\u0027d go down to the Village Cafe afterward and Buddy\u0027d make us pizzas, losers pay. All friends again, you know, a ter the game. We\u0027d sit there laughing and yelling and blowing straw-wrappers around, some of the guys half-loaded but nobody mean. In those days they got all the mean out on the ballfield. And you know what? None of them come to see me. Not Helen Geary, who was my best friend. Not Richie Lattimore, who was Lance\u0027s best friend ¡ª the two of them would talk about rocks and birds and the kinds of trees there were across the lake for hours on end. They came to the uneral, and for a little while after, and then . . . you know what it was like? When I was a kid, our well dried up. For awhile you\u0027d get a trickle when you turned on the tap, but then there was just air. Just air.\u0027 The cynicism was gone and there was only hurt in her voice. \u0027I saw Helen at Christmas, and we promised to get together for the twins\u0027 birthday, but we never did. I think she\u0027s scared to come near me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because of the old man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who else? But that\u0027s okay, life goes on.\u0027 She sat up, drank the rest of her Kool-Aid, and set the glass aside. \u0027What about you, Mike? Did you come back to write a book? Are you going to name the TR?\u0027 This was a local bon mot that I remembered with an almost painful twinge of nostalgia. Locals with great plans were said to be bent on naming the TR.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said, and then astonished myself by saying: \u0027I don\u0027t do that anymore. I think I expected her to leap to her feet, overturning her chair and uttering a sharp cry of horrified denial. All of which says a good deal about me, I suppose, and none of it flattering.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve retired?\u0027 she asked, sounding calm and remarkably unhorrified. \u0027Or is it writer\u0027s block?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s certainly not chosen retirement.\u0027 I realized the conversation had taken a rather amusing turn. I\u0027d come primarily to sell her on John Storrow ¡ª to shove John Storrow down her throat, if that was what it took ¡ª and instead I was for the first time discussing my inability to work. For the first time with anyone.\\n\\n \u0027So it\u0027s a block.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I used to think so, but now I\u0027m not so sure. I think novelists may come equipped with a certain number of stories to tell ¡ª they\u0027re built into the software. And when they\u0027re gone, they\u0027re gone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt that,\u0027 she said. \u0027Maybe you\u0027ll write now that you\u0027re down here. Maybe that\u0027s part of the reason you came back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe you\u0027re right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you scared?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes. Mostly about what I\u0027ll do for the rest of my life. I\u0027m no good at boats in bottles, and my wife was the one with the green thumb.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m scared, too,\u0027 she said. \u0027Scared a lot. All the time now, it seems like.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That he\u0027ll win his custody case? Mattie, that\u0027s what I ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027The custody case is only part of it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m scared just to be here, on the TR. It started early this summer, long after I knew Devore meant to get Ki away from me if he could. And it\u0027s getting worse. In a way it\u0027s like watching thunderheads gather over New Hampshire and then come piling across the lake. I can\u0027t put it any better than that, except . . . \u0027 She shifted, crossing her legs and then bending forward to pull the skirt of her dress against the line of her shin, as if she were cold. \u0027Except that I\u0027ve woken up several times lately, sure that I wasn\u0027t in the bedroom alone. Once when I was sure I wasn\u0027t in the bed alone. Sometimes it\u0027s just a feeling ¡ª like a headache, only in your nerves ¡ª and sometimes I think I can hear whispering, or crying. I made a cake one night ¡ª about two weeks ago, this was ¡ª and forgot to put the flour away. The next morning the cannister was overturned, and the flour was spilled on the counter. Someone had written \u0027hello\u0027 in it. I thought at first it was Ki, but she said she didn\u0027t do it. Besides, it wasn\u0027t her printing, hers is all straggly. I don\u0027t know if she could even write hello. Hi, maybe, but . . . Mike, you don\u0027t think he could be sending someone around to try and freak me out, do you? I mean that\u0027s just stupid, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said. I thought of something thumping the insulation in the dark as I stood on the stairs. I thought of hello printed with magnets on my refrigerator door, and a child sobbing in the dark. My skin felt more than cold; it felt numb. A headache in the nerves, that was good, that was exactly how you felt when something reached around the wall of the real world and touched you on the nape of the neck.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s ghosts,\u0027 she said, and smiled in an uncertain way that was more frightened than amused.\\n\\n I opened my mouth to tell her about what had been happening at Sara Laughs, then closed it again. There was a clear choice to be made here: either we could be sidetracked into a discussion of the paranormal, or we could come back to the visible world. The one where Max Devore was trying to steal himself a kid.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 I said. \u0027The spirits are about to speak.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish I could see your face better. There was something on it just then. What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said. \u0027But right now I think we\u0027d better talk about Kyra. Okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 In the faint glow of the hibachi I could see her settling herself in her chair, as if to take a blow.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been subpoenaed to give a deposition in Castle Rock on Friday. Before Elmer Durgin, who is Kyra\u0027s guardian ad litem ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That pompous little toad isn\u0027t Ki\u0027s anything!\u0027 she burst out. \u0027He\u0027s in my father-in-law\u0027s hip pocket, just like Dickie Osgood, old Max\u0027s pet real-estate guy! Dickie and Elmer Durgin drink together down at The Mellow Tiger, or at least they did until this business really got going. Then someone probably told them it would look bad, and they stopped.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The papers were served by a deputy named George Footman.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just one more of the usual suspects,\u0027 Mattie said in a thin voice. \u0027Dickie Osgood\u0027s a snake, but George Footman\u0027s a junkyard dog. He\u0027s been suspended off the cops twice. Once more and he can work for Max Devore full-time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, he scared me. I tried not to show it, but he did. And people who scare me make me angry. I called my agent in New York and then hired a lawyer. One who makes a specialty of child-custody cases.\u0027\\n\\n I tried to see how she was taking this and couldn\u0027t, although we were sitting fairly close together. But she still had that set look, like a woman who expects to take some hard blows. Or perhaps for Mattie the blows had already started to fall. Slowly, not allowing myself to rush, I went through my conversation with John Storrow. I emphasized what Storrow had said about sexual equality ¡ª that it was apt to be a negative force in her case, making it easier for Judge Rancourt to take Kyra away. I also came down hard on the fact that Devore could have all the lawyers he wanted ¡ª not to mention sympathetic witnesses, with Richard Osgood running around the TR and spreading Devore\u0027s dough ¡ª but that the court wasn\u0027t obligated to treat her to so much as an ice cream cone. I finished by telling her that John wanted to talk to one of us tomorrow at eleven, and that it should be her. Then I waited. The silence spun out, broken only by crickets and the faint revving of some kid\u0027s unmuffled truck. Up Route 68, the white fluorescents went out as the Lakeview Market finished another day of summer trade. I didn\u0027t like Mattie\u0027s quiet; it seemed like the prelude to an explosion. A Yankee explosion. I held my peace and waited for her to ask me what gave me the right to meddle in her business.\\n\\n When she finally spoke, her voice was low and defeated. It hurt to hear her sounding that way, but like the cynical look on her face earlier, it wasn\u0027t surprising. And I hardened myself against it as best I could. Hey, Mattie, tough old world. Pick one.\\n\\n \u0027Why would you do this?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Why would you hire an expensive New York lawyer to take my case? That is what you\u0027re offering, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s got to be, because I sure can\u0027t hire him. I got thirty thousand dollars\u0027 insurance money when Lance died, and was lucky to get that. It was a policy he bought from one of his Warrington\u0027s friends, almost as a joke, but without it I would have lost the trailer last winter. They may love Dickie Brooks at Western Savings, but they don\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass for Mattie Stanchfield Devore. After taxes I make about a hundred a week at the library. So you\u0027re offering to pay. Right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why? You don\u0027t even know us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because . . . \u0027 I trailed off. I seem to remember wanting Jo to step in at that point, asking my mind to supply her voice, which I could then pass on to Mattie in my own. But Jo didn\u0027t come. I was flying solo.\\n\\n \u0027Because now I do nothing that makes a difference,\u0027 I said at last, and once again the words astonished me. \u0027And I do know you. I\u0027ve eaten your food, I\u0027ve read Ki a story and had her fall asleep in my lap . . . and maybe I saved her life the other day when I grabbed her out of the road. We\u0027ll never know for sure, but maybe I did. You know what the Chinese say about something like that?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t expect an answer, the question was more rhetorical than real, but she surprised me. Not for the last time, either. \u0027That if you save someone\u0027s life, you\u0027re responsible for them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. It\u0027s also about what\u0027s fair and what\u0027s right, but I think mostly it\u0027s about wanting to be part of something where I make a difference. I look back on the four years since my wife died, and there\u0027s nothing there. Not even a book where Marjorie the shy typist meets a handsome stranger.\u0027\\n\\n She sat thinking this over, watching as a fully loaded pulptruck snored past on the highway, its headlights glaring and its load of logs swaying from side to side like the hips of an overweight woman. \u0027Don\u0027t you root for us,\u0027 she said at last. She spoke in a low, unexpectedly fierce voice. \u0027Don\u0027t you root for us like he roots for his team-of-the-week down at the softball field. I need help and I know it, but I won\u0027t have that. I can\u0027t have it. We\u0027re not a game, Ki and me. You understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perfectly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what people in town will say, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a lucky girl, don\u0027t you think? First I marry the son of an extremely rich man, and after he dies, I fall under the protective wing of another rich guy. Next I\u0027ll probably move in with Donald Trump.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cut it out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d probably believe it myself, if I were on the other side. But I wonder if anyone notices that lucky Mattie is still living in a Modair trailer and can\u0027t afford health insurance. Or that her kid got most of her vaccinations from the County Nurse. My parents died when I was fifteen. I have a brother and a sister, but they\u0027re both a lot older and both out of state. My parents were drunks ¡ª not physically abusive, but there was plenty of the other kinds. It was like growing up in a . . . a roach motel. My dad was a pulper, my mom was a bourbon beautician whose one ambition was to own a Mary Kay pink Cadillac. He drowned in Kewadin Pond. She drowned in her own vomit about six months later. How do you like it so far?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not very much. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027After Mom\u0027s funeral my brother, Hugh, offered to take me back to Rhode Island, but I could tell his wife wasn\u0027t exactly nuts about having a fifteen-year-old join the family, and I can\u0027t say that I blamed her. Also, I\u0027d just made the jv cheering squad. That seems like supreme diddlyshit now, but it was a very big deal then.\u0027\\n\\n Of course it had been a big deal, especially to the child of alcoholics. The only one still living at home. Being that last child, watching as the disease really digs its claws in, can be one of the world\u0027s loneliest jobs. Last one out of the sacred ginmill please turn off the lights.\\n\\n \u0027I ended up going to live with my aunt Florence, just two miles down the road. It took us about three weeks to discover we didn\u0027t like each other very much, but we made it work for two years. Then, between my junior and senior years, I got a summer job at Warrington\u0027s and met Lance. When he asked me to marry him, Aunt Flo refused to give permission. When I told her I was pregnant, she emancipated me so I didn\u0027t need it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You dropped out of school?\u0027\\n\\n She grimaced, nodded. \u0027I didn\u0027t want to spend six months having people watch me swell up like a balloon. Lance supported me. He said I could take the equivalency test. I did last year. It was easy. And now Ki and I are on our own. Even if my aunt agreed to help me, what could she do? She works in the Castle Rock Gore-Tex factory and makes about sixteen thousand dollars a year.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded again, thinking that my last check for French royalties had been about that. My last quarterly check. Then I remembered something Ki had told me on the day I met her.\\n\\n \u0027When I was carrying Kyra out of the road, she said that if you were mad, she\u0027d go to her white nana. If your folks are dead, who did she ¡ª \u0027 Except I didn\u0027t really have to ask; I only had to make one or two simple connections. \u0027Rogette Whitmore\u0027s the white nana? Devore\u0027s assistant? But that means . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That Ki\u0027s been with them. Yes, you bet. Until late last month, I allowed her to visit her grandpa ¡ª and Rogette by association, of course ¡ª quite often. Once or twice a week, and sometimes for an overnight. She likes her \"Whita poppa\" ¡ª at least she did at first ¡ª and she absolutely adores that creepy woman.\u0027 I thought Mattie shivered in the gloom, although the night was still very warm.\\n\\n \u0027Devore called to say he was coming east for Lance\u0027s funeral and to ask if he could see his granddaughter while he was here. Nice as pie, he was, just as if he\u0027d never tried to buy me off when Lance told him we were going to get married.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh. The first offer was a hundred thousand. That was in August of 1994, after Lance called him to say we were getting married in mid-September. I kept quiet about it. A week later, the offer went up to two hundred thousand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For what, precisely?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To remove my bitch-hooks and relocate with no forwarding address. This time I did tell Lance, and he hit the roof. Called his old man and said we were going to be married whether he liked it or not. Told him that if he ever wanted to see his grandchild, he had better cut the shit and behave.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With another parent, I thought, that was probably the most reasonable response Lance Devore could have made. I respected him for it. The only problem was that he wasn\u0027t dealing with a reasonable man; he was dealing with the fellow who, as a child, had stolen Scooter Larribee\u0027s new sled.\\n\\n \u0027These offers were made by Devore himself, over the telephone. Both when Lance wasn\u0027t around. Then, about ten days before the wedding, I had a visit from Dickie Osgood. I was to make a call to a number in Delaware, and when I did . . . \u0027 Mattie shook her head. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe it. It\u0027s like something out of one of your books.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027May I guess?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you want.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He tried to buy the child. He tried to buy Kyra.\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes widened. A scantling moon had come up and I could see that look of surprise well enough.\\n\\n \u0027How much?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I\u0027m curious. How much for you to give birth, leave Devore\u0027s grandchild with Lance, then scat?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Two million dollars,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Deposited in the bank of my choice, as long as it was west of the Mississippi and I signed an agreement to stay away from her ¡ª and from Lance ¡ª until at least April twentieth, 2016.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The year Ki turns twenty-one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And Osgood doesn\u0027t know any of the details, so Devore\u0027s skirts remain clean here in town.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh. And the two million was only the start. There was to be an additional million on Ki\u0027s fifth, tenth, fifteenth, and twentieth birthdays.\u0027 She shook her head in a disbelieving way. \u0027The linoleum keeps bubbling up in the kitchen, the showerhead keeps falling into the tub, and the whole damn rig cants to the east these days, but I could have been the six-million-dollar woman.\u0027\\n\\n Did you ever consider taking the off, Mattie? I wondered . . . but that was a question I\u0027d never ask, a sign of curiosity so unseemly it deserved no satisfaction.\\n\\n \u0027Did you tell Lance?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I tried not to. He was already furious with his father, and I didn\u0027t want to make it worse. I didn\u0027t want that much hate at the start of our marriage, no matter how good the reasons for hating might be . . . and I didn\u0027t want Lance to . . . later on with me, you know . . . \u0027 She raised her hands, then dropped them back on her thighs. The gesture was both weary and oddly endearing.\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t want Lance turning on you ten years later and saying \u0027\"You came between me and my father, you bitch.\u0027\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something like that. But in the end, I couldn\u0027t keep it to myself. I was just this kid from the sticks, didn\u0027t own a pair of pantyhose until I was eleven, wore my hair in nothing but braids or a ponytail until I was thirteen, thought the whole state of New York was New York City . . . and this guy . . . this phantom father . . . had offered me six million bucks. It terrified me. I had dreams about him coming in the night like a troll and stealing my baby out of her crib. He\u0027d come wriggling through the window like a snake . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dragging his oxygen tank behind him, no doubt.\u0027\\n\\n She smiled. \u0027I didn\u0027t know about the oxygen then. Or Rogette Whit-more, either. All I\u0027m trying to say is that I was only seventeen and not good at keeping secrets.\u0027 I had to restrain my own smile at the way she said this ¡ª as if decades of experience now lay between that naive, frightened child and this mature woman with the mail-order diploma.\\n\\n \u0027Lance was angry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So angry he replied to his father by e-mail instead of calling. He stuttered, you see, and the more upset he was, the worse his stutter became. A phone conversation would have been impossible.\u0027\\n\\n Now, at last, I thought I had a clear picture. Lance Devore had written his father an unthinkable letter ¡ª unthinkable, that was, if you happened to be Max Devore. The letter said that Lance didn\u0027t want to hear from his father again, and Mattie didn\u0027t, either. He wouldn\u0027t be welcome in their home (the Modair trailer wasn\u0027t quite the humble woodcutter\u0027s cottage of a Brothers Grimm tale, but it was close enough for kissing). He wouldn\u0027t be welcome to visit following the birth of their baby, and if he had the gall to send the child a present then or later, it would be returned. Stay out of my life, Dad. This time you\u0027ve gone too far to forgive.\\n\\n There are undoubtedly diplomatic ways of handling an offended child, some wise and some crafty . . . but ask yourself this: would a diplomatic father have gotten himself into such a situation to begin with? Would a man with even minimal insight into human nature have offered his son\u0027s fiancee a bounty (one so enormous it probably had little real sense or meaning to her) to give up her firstborn child? And he\u0027d offered this devil\u0027s bargain to a girl-woman of seventeen, an age when the romantic view of life is at absolute high tide. If nothing else, Devore should have waited awhile before making his final offer. You could argue that he didn\u0027t know if he had awhile, but it wouldn\u0027t be a persuasive argument. I thought Mattie was right ¡ª deep in that wrinkled old prune which served him as a heart, Max Devore thought he was going to live forever.\\n\\n In the end, he hadn\u0027t been able to restrain himself. There was the sled he wanted, the sled he just had to have, on the other side of the window. All he had to do was break the glass and take it. He\u0027d been doing it all his life, and so he had reacted to his son\u0027s e-mail not craftily, as a man of his years and abilities should have done, but furiously, as the child would have done if the glass in the shed window had proved immune to his hammering fists. Lance didn\u0027t want him meddling? Fine! Lance could live with his backwoods Daisy Mae in a tent or a trailer or a goddamned cowbarn. He could give up the cushy surveying job, as well, and find real employment. See how the other half lived!\\n\\n In other words, you can\u0027t quit on me, son. You\u0027re fired.\\n\\n \u0027We didn\u0027t fall into each other\u0027s arms at the funeral,\u0027 Mattie said, \u0027don\u0027t get that idea. But he was decent to me ¡ª which I didn\u0027t expect ¡ª and I tried to be decent to him. He offered me a stipend, which I refused. I was afraid there might be legal ramifications.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it, but I like your caution. What happened when he saw Kyra for the first time, Mattie? Do you remember?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it.\u0027 She reached into the pocket of her dress, found a battered pack of cigarettes, and shook one out. She looked at it with a mixture of greed and disgust. \u0027I quit these because Lance said we couldn\u0027t really afford them, and I knew he was right. But the habit creeps back. I only smoke a pack a week, and I know damned well even that\u0027s too much, but sometimes I need the comfort. Do you want one?\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head. She lit up, and in the momentary flare of the match, her face was way past pretty. What had the old man made of her? I wondered.\\n\\n \u0027He met his granddaughter for the first time beside a hearse,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027We were at Dakin\u0027s Funeral Home in Motton. It was the \"viewing.\" Do you know about that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 I said, thinking of Jo.\\n\\n \u0027The casket was closed but they still call it a viewing. Weird. I came out to have a cigarette. I told Ki to sit on the funeral parlor steps so she wouldn\u0027t get the smoke, and I went a little way down the walk. This big gray limo pulled up. I\u0027d never seen anything like it before, except on TV. I knew who it was right away. I put my cigarettes back in my purse and told Ki to come. She toddled down the walk and took hold of my hand. The limo door opened, and Rogette Whitmore got out. She had an oxygen mask in one hand, but he didn\u0027t need it, at least not then. He got out after her. A tall man ¡ª not as tall as you, Mike, but tall ¡ª wearing a gray suit and black shoes as shiny as mirrors.\u0027\\n\\n She paused, thinking. Her cigarette rose briefly to her mouth, then went back down to the arm of her chair, a red firefly in the weak moonlight.\\n\\n \u0027At first he didn\u0027t say anything. The woman tried to take his arm and help him climb the three or four steps from the road to the walk, but he shook her off. He got to where we were standing under his own power, although I could hear him wheezing way down deep in his chest. It was the sound a machine makes when it needs oil. I don\u0027t know how much he can walk now, but it\u0027s probably not much. Those few steps pretty well did him in, and that was almost a year ago. He looked at me for a second or two, then bent forward with his big, bony old hands on his knees. He looked at Kyra and she looked up at him.\u0027\\n\\n Yes. I could see it . . . except not in color, not in an image like a photograph. I saw it as a woodcut, just one more harsh illustration from Grimm\u0027s Fairy Tales. The little girl looks up wide-eyed at the rich old man ¡ª once a boy who went triumphantly sliding on a stolen sled, now at the other end of his life and just one more bag of bones. \u0027In my imagining, Ki was wearing a hooded jacket and Devore\u0027s grandpa mask was slightly askew, allowing me to see the tufted wolf-pelt beneath. What big eyes you have, Grandpa, what a big nose you have, Grandpa, what big teeth you have, too.\\n\\n \u0027He picked her up. I don\u0027t know how much effort it cost him, but he did. And ¡ª the oddest thing ¡ª Ki let herself be picked up. He was a complete stranger to her, and old people always seem to scare little children, but she let him pick her up. \u0027Do you know who I am?\u0027 he asked her. She shook her head, but the way she was looking at him . . . it was as if she almost knew. Do you think that\u0027s possible?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He said, \"I\u0027m your grandpa.\" And I almost grabbed her back, Mike, because I had this crazy idea . . . I don\u0027t know . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That he was going to eat her up?\u0027\\n\\n Her cigarette paused in front of her mouth. Her eyes were round. \u0027How do you know that? How can you know that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because in my mind\u0027s eye it looks like a fairy tale. Little Red Riding Hood and the Old Gray Wolf. What did he do then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ate her up with his eyes. Since then he\u0027s taught her to play checkers and Candyland and box-dots. She\u0027s only three, but he\u0027s taught her to add and subtract. She has her own room at Warrington\u0027s and her own little computer in it, and God knows what he\u0027s taught her to do with that . . . but that first time he only looked at her. It was the hungriest look I\u0027ve ever seen in my life.\\n\\n \u0027And she looked back. It couldn\u0027t have been more than ten or twenty seconds, but it seemed like forever. Then he tried to hand her back to me. He\u0027d used up all his strength, though, and if I hadn\u0027t been right there to take her, I think he would have dropped her on the cement walk.\\n\\n \u0027He staggered a little, and Rogette Whitmore put an arm around him. That was when he took the oxygen mask from her ¡ª there was a little air-bottle attached to it on an elastic ¡ª and put it over his mouth and nose. A couple of deep breaths and he seemed more or less all right again. He gave it back to Rogette and really seemed to see me for the first time. He said, \"I\u0027ve been a fool, haven\u0027t I?\" I said, \"Yes, sir, I think you have.\" He gave me a look, very black, when I said that. I think if he\u0027d been even five years younger, he might have hit me for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he wasn\u0027t and he didn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. He said, \u0027I want to go inside. Will you help me do that?\u0027 I said I would. We went up the mortuary steps with Rogette on one side of him, me t sort of like a harem girl. It wasn\u0027t a very nice feeling. When we got into the vestibule, he sat down to catch his breath and take a little more oxygen. Rogette turned to Kyra. I think that woman\u0027s got a scary face, it reminds me of some painting or other ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Cry? The one by Munch?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s the one.\u0027 She dropped her cigarette ¡ª she\u0027d smoked it all the way down to the filter ¡ª and stepped on it, grinding it into the bony, rock-riddled ground with one white sneaker. \u0027But Ki wasn\u0027t scared of her a bit. Not then, not later. She bent down to Kyra and said, \u0027What rhymes with lady?\u0027 and Kyra said \u0027Shady!\u0027 right off. Even at two she loved rhymes. Rogette reached into her purse and brought out a Hershey\u0027s Kiss. Ki looked at me to see if she had permission and I said, \u0027All right, but just one, and I don\u0027t want to see any of it on your dress.\u0027 Ki popped it into her mouth and smiled at Rogette as if they\u0027d been friends since forever.\\n\\n \u0027By then Devore had his breath back, but he looked tired ¡ª the most tired man I\u0027ve ever seen. He reminded me of something in the Bible, about how in the days of our old age we say we have no pleasure in them. My heart kind of broke for him. Maybe he saw it, because he reached for my hand. He said, \"Don\u0027t shut me out.\" And at that moment I could see Lance in his face. I started to cry. I said, \"I won\u0027t unless you make me.\"\u0027\\n\\n I could see them there in the funeral home\u0027s foyer, him sitting, her standing, the little girl looking on in wide-eyed puzzlement as she sucked the sweet Hershey\u0027s Kiss. Canned organ music in the background. Poor old Max Devore had been crafty enough on the day of his son\u0027s viewing, I thought. Don\u0027t shut me out, indeed.\\n\\n I tried to buy you off and when that didn\u0027t work I upped the stakes and tried to buy the baby. When that also failed, I told my son that you and he and my grandchild could choke on the dirt of your own decision. In a way, I\u0027m the reason he was where he was when fell and broke his neck, but don\u0027t shut me out, Mattie, I\u0027m just a poor old geezer, so don\u0027t shut me out.\\n\\n \u0027I was stupid, wasn\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You expected him to be better than he was. If that makes you stupid, Mattie, the world could use more of it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did have my doubts,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s why I wouldn\u0027t take any of his money, and by last October he\u0027d quit asking. But I let him see her. I suppose, yeah, part of it was the idea there might be something in it for Ki later on, but I honestly didn\u0027t think about that so much. Mostly it was him being her only blood link to her father. I wanted her to enjoy that the way any kid enjoys having a grandparent. What I didn\u0027t want was for her to be infected by all the crap that went on before Lance died.\\n\\n \u0027At first it seemed to be working. Then, little by little, things changed. I realized that Ki didn\u0027t like her \u0027white poppa\u0027 so much; for one thing. Her feelings about Rogette are the same, but Max Devore\u0027s started to make her nervous in some way I don\u0027t understand and she can\u0027t explain. I asked her once if he\u0027d ever touched her anywhere that made her feel funny. I showed her the places I meant, and she said no. I believe her, but . . . he said something or did something. I\u0027m almost sure of it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could be no more than the sound of his breathing getting worse,\u0027 I said. \u0027That alone might be enough to scare a child. Or maybe he had some kind of spell while she was there. What about you, Mattie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well . . . one day in February Lindy Briggs told me that George Footman had been in to check the fire extinguishers and the smoke detectors in the library. He also asked if Lindy had found any beer cans or liquor bottles in the trash lately. Or cigarette butts that were obviously homemade.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Roaches, in other words.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh. And Dickie Osgood has been visiting my old friends, I hear. Chatting. Panning for gold. Digging the dirt.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is there any to dig?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not much, thank God.\u0027\\n\\n I hoped she was right, and I hoped that if there was stuff she wasn\u0027t telling me, John Storrow would get it out of her.\\n\\n \u0027But through all this you let Ki go on seeing him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What would pulling the plug on the visits have accomplished? And I thought that allowing them to go on would at least keep him from speeding up any plans he might have.\u0027\\n\\n That, I thought, made a lonely kind of sense.\\n\\n \u0027Then, in the spring, I started to get some extremely creepy, scary feelings.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Creepy how? Scary how?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 She took out her cigarettes, looked at them, then stuffed the pack back in her pocket. \u0027It wasn\u0027t just that my father-in-law was looking for dirty laundry in my closets, either. It was Ki. I started to worry about ICI all the time she was with him . . . with them. Rogette would come in the BMW they\u0027d bought or leased, and Ki would be sitting out on the steps waiting for her. With her bag of toys if it was a day-visit, with her little pink Minnie Mouse suitcase if it was an overnight. And she\u0027d always come back with one more thing than she left with. My father-in-law\u0027s a great believer in presents. Before popping her into the car, Rogette would give me that cold little smile of hers and say, \"Seven o\u0027clock then, we\u0027ll give her supper\" or \"Eight o\u0027clock then, and a nice hot breakfast before she leaves.\" I\u0027d say okay, and then Rogette would reach into her bag and hold out a Hershey\u0027s Kiss to Ki just the way you\u0027d hold a biscuit out to a dog to make it shake hands. She\u0027d say a word and Kyra would rhyme it. Rogette would toss her her treat ¡ª woof-woof, good dog, I always used to think ¡ª and off they\u0027d go. Come seven in the evening or eight in the morning, the BMW would pull in right where your car\u0027s parked now. You could set your clock by the woman. But I got worried.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That they might get tired of the legal process and just snatch her?\u0027\\n\\n This seemed to me a reasonable concern ¡ª so reasonable I could hardly believe Mattie had ever let her little girl go to the old man in the first place. In custody cases, as in the rest of life, possession tends to be nine tenths of the law, and if Mattie was telling the truth about her past and present, a custody hearing was apt to turn into a tiresome production even for the rich Mr. Devore. Snatching might, in the end, look like a more efficient solution.\\n\\n \u0027Not exactly,\u0027 she said. \u0027I guess it\u0027s the logical thing, but that wasn\u0027t really it. I just got afraid. There was nothing I could put my finger on. It would get to be quarter past six in the evening and I\u0027d think, \"This time that white-haired bitch isn\u0027t going to bring her back. This time she\u0027s going to . . . \u0027\u0027\u0027\\n\\n I waited. When nothing came I said, \u0027Going to what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I\u0027ve been afraid for Ki since spring. By the time June came around, I couldn\u0027t stand it anymore, and I put a stop to the visits. Kyra\u0027s been off-and-on pissed at me ever since. I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s most of what that Fourth of July escapade was about. She doesn\u0027t talk about her grandfather very much, but she\u0027s always popping out with \"What do you think the white nana\u0027s doing now, Mattie?\" or \"Do you think the white nana would like my new dress?\" Or she\u0027ll run up to me and say \"Sing, ring, king, thing,\" and ask for a treat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What was the reaction from Devore?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Complete fury. He called again and again, first asking what was wrong, then making threats.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Physical threats?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Custody threats. He was going to take her away, when he was finished with me I\u0027d stand before the whole world as an unfit mother, I didn\u0027t have a chance, my only hope was to relent and let me see my granddaughter, goddammit.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded. \u0027\"Please don\u0027t shut me out\" doesn\u0027t sound like the guy who called while I was watching the fireworks, but that does.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve also gotten calls from Dickie Osgood, and a number of other locals,\u0027 she said. \u0027Including Lance\u0027s old friend Richie Lattimore. Richie said I wasn\u0027t being true to Lance\u0027s memory.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about George Footman?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He cruises by once in awhile. Lets me know he\u0027s watching. He hasn\u0027t called or stopped in. You asked about physical threats ¡ª just seeing Footman\u0027s cruiser on my road feels like a physical threat to me. He scares me. But these days it seems as if everything does.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even though Kyra\u0027s visits have stopped.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even though. It feels . . . thundery. Like something\u0027s going to happen. And every day that feeling seems to get stronger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027John Storrow\u0027s number,\u0027 I said. \u0027Do you want it?\u0027\\n\\n She sat quietly, looking into her lap. Then she raised her head and nodded. \u0027Give it to me. And thank you. From the bottom of my heart.\u0027\\n\\n I had the number on a pink memo-slip in my front pocket. She grasped it but did not immediately take it. Our fingers were touching, and she was looking at me with disconcerting steadiness. It was as if she knew more about my motives than I did myself.\\n\\n \u0027What can I do to repay you?\u0027 she asked, and there it was.\\n\\n \u0027Tell Storrow everything you\u0027ve told me.\u0027 I let go of the pink slip and stood up. \u0027That\u0027ll do just fine. And now I have to get along. Will you call and tell me how you made out with him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n We walked to my car. I turned to her when we got there. For a moment I thought she was going to put her arms around me and hug me, a thank-you gesture that might have led anywhere in our current mood ¡ª one so heightened it was almost melodramatic. But it was a melodramatic situation, a fairy-tale where there\u0027s good and bad and a lot of repressed sex running under both.\\n\\n Then headlights appeared over the brow of the hill where the market stood and swept past the All-Purpose Garage. They moved toward us, brightening. Mattie stood back and actually put her hands behind her, like a child who has been scolded. The car passed, leaving us in the dark again . . . but the moment had passed, too. If there had been a moment.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks for dinner,\u0027 I said. \u0027It was wonderful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks for the lawyer, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be wonderful, too,\u0027 she said, and we both laughed. The electricity went out of the air. \u0027He spoke of you once, you know. Devore.\u0027\\n\\n I looked at her in surprise. \u0027I\u0027m amazed he even knew who I was. Before this, I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He knows, all right. He spoke of you with what I think was genuine affection.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re kidding. You must be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not. He said that your great-grandfather and his great-grandfather worked the same camps and were neighbors when they weren\u0027t in the woods ¡ª I think he said not far from where Boyd\u0027s Marina is now. \u0027They shit in the same pit,\u0027 is the way he put it. Charming, huh? He said he guessed that if a couple of loggers from the TR could produce millionaires, the system was working the way it was supposed to. \"Even if it took three generations to do it,\" he said. At the time I took it as a veiled criticism of Lance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s ridiculous, however he meant it,\u0027 I said. \u0027My family is from the coast. Prout\u0027s Neck. Other side of the state. My dad was a fisherman and so was his father before him. My great-grandfather, too. They trapped lobsters and threw nets, they didn\u0027t cut trees.\u0027 All that was true, and yet my mind tried to fix on something. Some memory connected to what she was saying. Perhaps if I slept on it, it would come back to me.\\n\\n \u0027Could he have been talking about someone in your wife\u0027s family?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nope.\\n\\n There are Arlens in Maine ¡ª they\u0027re a big family ¡ª but most are still in Massachusetts. They do all sorts of things now, but if you go back to the eighteen-eighties, the majority would have been quarrymen and stonecutters in the Malden-Lynn area. Devore was pulling your leg, Mattie.\u0027 But even then I suppose I knew he wasn\u0027t. He might have gotten some part of the story wrong ¡ª even the sharpest guys begin to lose the edge of their recollection by the time they turn eighty-five ¡ª but Max Devore wasn\u0027t much of a leg-puller. I had an image of unseen cables stretching beneath the surface of the earth here on the TR ¡ª -stretching in all directions, unseen but very powerful.\\n\\n My hand was resting on top of my car door, and now she touched it briefly. \u0027Can I ask you one other question before you go? It\u0027s stupid, I warn you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go ahead. Stupid questions are a specialty of mine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you have any idea at all what that \"Bartleby\" story is about?\u0027\\n\\n I wanted to laugh, but there was enough moonlight for me to see she was serious, and that I\u0027d hurt her feelings if I did. She was a member of Lindy Briggs\u0027s readers\u0027 circle (where I had once spoken in the late eighties), probably the youngest by at least twenty years, and she was afraid of appearing stupid.\\n\\n \u0027I have to speak first next time,\u0027 she said, \u0027and I\u0027d like to give more than just a summary of the story so they know I\u0027ve read it. I\u0027ve thought about it until my head aches, and I just don\u0027t see. I doubt if it\u0027s one of those stories where everything comes magically clear in the last few pages, either. And I feel like I should see ¡ª that it\u0027s right there in front of me.\u0027\\n\\n That made me think of the cables again ¡ª cables running in every direction, a subcutaneous webwork connecting people and places. You couldn\u0027t see them, but you could feel them. Especially if you tried to get away. Meanwhile Mattie was waiting, looking at me with hope and anxiety.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, listen up, school\u0027s in session,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027I am. Believe me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Most critics think Huckleberry Finn is the first modern American novel, and that\u0027s fair enough, but if \"Bartleby\" were a hundred pages longer, I think I\u0027d put my money there. Do you know what a scrivener was?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A secretary?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s too grand. A copyist. Sort of like Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol. Only Dickens gives Bob a past and a family life. Melville gives Bartleby neither. He\u0027s the first existential character in American fiction, a guy with no ties . . . no ties to, you know . . . \u0027\\n\\n A couple of loggers who could produce millionaires. They shit in the same pit.\\n\\n \u0027Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 I focused my mind as best I could. \u0027Bartleby is tied to life only by work. In that way he\u0027s a twentieth-century American type, not much different from Sloan Wilson\u0027s Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, or ¡ª in the dark version ¡ª Michael Corleone in The Godfather. But then Bartleby begins to question even work, the god of middle-class American males.\u0027\\n\\n She looked excited now, and I thought it was a shame she\u0027d missed her last year of high school. For her and also for her teachers. \u0027That\u0027s why he starts saying \"I prefer not to\"?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Think of Bartleby as a . . . a hot-air balloon. Only one rope still tethers him to the earth, and that rope is his scrivening. We can measure the rot in that last rope by the steadily increasing number of things Bartleby prefers not to do. Finally the rope breaks and Bartleby floats away. It\u0027s a goddam disturbing story, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One night I dreamed about him,\u0027 she said. \u0027I opened the trailer door and there he was, sitting on the steps in his old black suit. Thin. Not much hair. I said, \"Will you move, please? I have to go out and hang the clothes now.\" And he said, \"I prefer not to.\" Yes, I guess you could call it disturbing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then it still works,\u0027 I said, and got into my car. \u0027Call me. Tell me how it goes with John Storrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will. And anything I can do to repay, just ask.\u0027\\n\\n Just ask. How young did you have to be, how beautifully ignorant, to issue that kind of blank check?\\n\\n My window was open. I reached through it and squeezed her hand.\\n\\n She squeezed back, and hard. \u0027You miss your wife a lot, don\u0027t you?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It shows?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes.\u0027 She was no longer squeezing, but she was still holding my hand. \u0027When you were reading to Ki, you looked both happy and sad at the same time. I only saw her once, your wife, but I thought she was very beautiful.\u0027\\n\\n I had been thinking about the touch of our hands, concentrating on that. Now I forgot about it entirely. \u0027When did you see her? And where? Do you remember?\u0027\\n\\n She smiled as if those were very silly questions. \u0027I remember. It was at the ballfield, on the night I met my husband.\u0027\\n\\n Very slowly I withdrew my hand from hers. So far as I knew, neither Jo nor I had been near TR-90 all that summer of \u002794 . . . but what I knew was apparently wrong. Jo had been down on a Tuesday in early July. She had even gone to the softball game.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure it was Jo?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Mattie was looking off toward the road. It wasn\u0027t my wife she was thinking about; I would have bet the house and lot on it ¡ª either house, either lot. It was Lance. Maybe that was good. If she was thinking about him, she probably wouldn\u0027t look too closely at me, and I didn\u0027t think I had much control of my expression just then. She might have seen more on my face than I wanted to show.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was standing with Jenna McCoy and Helen Geary ¡ª this was after Lance helped me with a keg of beer I got stuck in the mud and then asked if I was going for pizza with the rest of them after the game ¡ª and Jenna said, \"Look, it\u0027s Mrs. Noonan,\" and Helen said, \"She\u0027s the writer\u0027s wife, Mattie, isn\u0027t that a cool blouse?\" The blouse was all covered with blue roses.\u0027\\n\\n I remembered it very well. Jo liked it because it was a joke ¡ª there are no blue roses, not in nature and not in cultivation. Once when she was wearing it she had thrown her arms extravagantly around my neck, swooned her hips forward against mine, and cried that she was my blue rose and I must stroke her until she turned pink. Remembering that hurt, and badly.\\n\\n \u0027She was over on the third-base side, behind the chickenwire screen,\u0027 Mattie said, \u0027with some guy who was wearing an old brown jacket with patches on the elbows. They were laughing together over something, and then she turned her head a little and looked right at me.\u0027 She was quiet for a moment, standing there beside my car in her red dress. She raised her hair off the back of her neck, held it, then let it drop again. \u0027Right at me. Really seeing me. And she had a look about her . . . she\u0027d just been laughing but this look was sad, somehow. It was as if she knew me. Then the guy put his arm around her waist and they walked away.\u0027\\n\\n Silence except for the crickets and the far-off drone of a truck. Mattie only stood there for a moment, as if dreaming with her eyes open, and then she felt something and looked back at me.\\n\\n \u0027Is something wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Except who was this guy with his arm around my wife?\u0027\\n\\n She laughed a little uncertainly. \u0027Well I doubt if he was her boyfriend, you know. He was quite a bit older. Fifty, at least.\u0027 So what? I thought. I myself was forty, but that didn\u0027t mean I had missed the way Mattie moved inside her dress, or lifted her hair from the nape of her neck. \u0027I mean . . . you\u0027re kidding, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t really know. There\u0027s a lot of things I don\u0027t know these days, it seems. But the lady\u0027s dead in any case, so how can it matter?\u0027\\n\\n Mattie was looking distressed. \u0027If I put my foot in something, Mike, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who was the man? Do you know?\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head. \u0027I thought he was a summer person ¡ª there was that feeling about him, maybe just because he was wearing a jacket on a hot summer evening ¡ª but if he was, he wasn\u0027t staying at Warrington\u0027s. I knew most of them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they walked off together?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 Sounding reluctant.\\n\\n \u0027Toward the parking lot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 More reluctant still. And this time she was lying. I knew it with a queer certainty that went far beyond intuition; it was almost like mind-reading.\\n\\n I reached through the window and took her hand again. \u0027You said if I could think of anything you could do to repay me, to just ask. I\u0027m asking. Tell me the truth, Mattie.\u0027\\n\\n She bit her lip, looking down at my hand lying over hers. Then she looked up at my face. \u0027He was a burly guy. The old sportcoat made him look a little like a college professor, but he could have been a carpenter for all I know. His hair was black. He had a tan. They had a laugh together, a good one, and then she looked at me and the laugh went out of her face. After that he put an arm around her and they walked away.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Not toward the parking lot, though. Toward The Street.\u0027\\n\\n The Street. From there they could have walked north along the edge of the lake until they came to Sara Laughs. And then? Who knew?\\n\\n \u0027She never told me she came down here that summer,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n Mattie seemed to try several responses and find none of them to her liking. I gave her her hand back. It was time for me to go. In fact I had started to wish I\u0027d left five minutes sooner.\\n\\n \u0027Mike, I\u0027m sure ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027You\u0027re not. Neither am I. But I loved her a lot and I\u0027m going to try and let this go. It probably signifies nothing, and besides ¡ª what else can I do? Thanks for dinner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re welcome.\u0027 Mattie looked so much like crying that I picked her hand up again and kissed the back of it. \u0027I feel like a dope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not a dope,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n I gave her hand another kiss, then drove away. And that was my date, the first one in four years.\\n\\n Driving home I thought of an old saying about how one person can never truly know another. It\u0027s easy to give that idea lip service, but it\u0027s a jolt ¡ª as horrible and unexpected as severe air turbulence on a previously calm airline flight ¡ª to discover it\u0027s a literal fact in one\u0027s own life. I kept remembering our visit to a fertility doc after we\u0027d been trying to make a baby for almost two years with no success. The doctor had told us I had a low sperm count ¡ª not disastrously low, but down enough to account for Jo\u0027s failure to conceive.\\n\\n \u0027If you want a kid, you\u0027ll likely have one without any special help,\u0027 the doc had said. \u0027Both the odds and time are still on your side. It could happen tomorrow or it could happen four years from now. Will you ever fill the house with babies? Probably not. But you might have two, and you\u0027ll almost certainly have one if you keep doing the thing that makes them.\u0027 She had grinned. \u0027Remember, the pleasure is in the journey.\u0027\\n\\n There had been a lot of pleasure, all right, many ringings of Bunter\u0027s bell, but there had been no baby. Then Johanna had died running across a shopping-center parking lot on a hot day, and one of the items in her bag had been a Norco Home Pregnancy Test which she had not told me she had intended to buy. No more than she\u0027d told me she had bought a couple of plastic owls to keep the crows from shitting on the lakeside deck.\\n\\n What else hadn\u0027t she told me?\\n\\n \u0027Stop,\u0027 I muttered. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake stop thinking about it.\u0027\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n When I got back to Sara, the fruit and vegetable magnets on the refrigerator were in a circle again. Three letters had been clustered in the middle:\\n\\n g d\\n\\n I moved the o up to where I thought it belonged, making \u0027god\u0027 or maybe an abridged version of \u0027good.\u0027 Which meant exactly what? \u0027I could speculate about that, but I prefer not to,\u0027 I told the empty house. I looked at Bunter the moose, willing the bell around his moth-eaten neck to ring. When it didn\u0027t, I opened my two new Magnabet packages and stuck the letters on the fridge door, spreading them out. Then I went down to the north wing, undressed, and brushed my teeth.\\n\\n As I bared my fangs for the mirror in a sudsy cartoon scowl, I considered calling Ward Hankins again tomorrow morning. I could tell him that my search for the elusive plastic owls had progressed from November of 1993 to July of 1994. What meetings had Jo put on her calendar for that month? What excuses to be out of Derry? And once I had finished with Ward, I could tackle Jo\u0027s friend Bonnie Amudson, ask her if anything had been going on with Jo in the last summer of her life.\\n\\n Let her rest in peace, why don\u0027t you? It was the UFO voice. What good will it do you to do otherwise? Assume she popped over to the TR after one of her board meetings, maybe just on a whim, met an old friend, took him back to the house for a bite of dinner. Just dinner.\\n\\n And never told me? I asked the UFO voice, spitting out a mouthful of toothpaste and then rinsing. Never said a single word?\\n\\n How do you know she didn\u0027t? the voice returned, and that froze me in the act of putting my toothbrush back in the medicine cabinet. The UFO voice had a point. I had been deep into All the Way from the Top by July of \u002794. Jo could have come in and told me she\u0027d seen Lon Chaney Junior dancing with the queen, doing the Werewolves of London, and I probably would have said \u0027Uh-huh, honey, that\u0027s nice\u0027 as I went on proofing copy.\\n\\n \u0027Bullshit,\u0027 I said to my reflection. \u0027That\u0027s just bullshit.\u0027\\n\\n Except it wasn\u0027t. When I was really driving on a book I more or less fell out of the world; other than a quick scan of the sports pages, I didn\u0027t even read the newspaper. So yes ¡ª it was possible that Jo had told me she\u0027d run over to the TR after a board meeting in Lewiston or Freeport, it was possible that she\u0027d told me she\u0027d run into an old friend ¡ª perhaps another student from the photography seminar she\u0027d attended at Bates in 1991 ¡ª and it was possible she\u0027d told me they\u0027d had dinner together on our deck, eating black trumpet mushrooms she\u0027d picked herself as the sun went down. It was possible she\u0027d told me these things and I hadn\u0027t registered a word of what she was saying.\\n\\n And did I really think I\u0027d get anything I could trust out of Bonnie Amudson? She\u0027d been Jo\u0027s friend, not mine, and Bonnie might feel the statute of limitations hadn\u0027t run out on any secrets my wife had told her.\\n\\n The bottom line was as simple as it was brutal: Jo was four years dead. Best to love her and let all troubling questions lapse. I took a final mouthful of water directly from the tap, swished it around in my mouth, and spat it out.\\n\\n When I returned to the kitchen to set the coffee-maker for seven A.M., I saw a new message in a new circle of magnets. It read\\n\\n blue rose liar ha ha\\n\\n I looked at it for a second or two, wondering what had put it there, and why.\\n\\n Wondering if it was true.\\n\\n I stretched out a hand and scattered all the letters far and wide. Then I went to bed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-13.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
