{"id":78353,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The little girl ¡ª actually she wasn\u0027t much more than a baby-came walking up the middle of Route 68, dressed in a red bathing suit, yellow plastic flip-flops, and a Boston Red Sox baseball cap turned around backward. I had just driven past the Lakeview General Store and Dickie Brooks\u0027s All-Purpose Garage, and the speed limit there drops from fifty-five to thirty-five. Thank God I was obeying it that day, otherwise I might have killed her. It was my first day back. I\u0027d gotten up late and spent most of the morning walking in the woods which run along the lakeshore, seeing what was the same and what had changed. The water looked a little lower and there were fewer boats than I would have expected, especially on summer\u0027s biggest holiday, but otherwise I might never have been away. I even seemed to be slapping at the same bugs. Around eleven my stomach alerted me to the fact that I\u0027d skipped breakfast. I decided a trip to the Village Cafe was in order. The restaurant at Warrington\u0027s was trendier by far, but I\u0027d be stared at there. The Village Cafe would be better ¡ª if it was still doing business. Buddy Jellison was an ill-tempered fuck, but he had always been the best fry-cook in western Maine and what my stomach wanted was a big greasy Villageburger. Now this little girl, walking straight up the white line and looking like a majorette leading an invisible parade. At thirty-five miles per hour I saw her in plenty of time, but this road was busy in the summer, and very few people bothered creeping through the reduced-speed zone. There were only a dozen Castle County police cruisers, after all, and not many of them bothered with the TR unless they were specifically called there. I pulled over to the shoulder, put the Chevy in PARK, and was out before the dust had even begun to settle. The day was muggy and close and still, the clouds seeming low enough to touch. The kid ¡ª a little blondie with a snub nose and scabbed knees ¡ª stood on the white line as if it were a tightrope and watched me approach with no more fear than a fawn. \u0027Hi,\u0027 she said. \u0027I go beach. Mummy \u0027on\u0027t take me and I\u0027m mad as hell.\u0027 She stamped her foot to show she knew as well as anybody what mad as hell was all about. Three or four was my guess. Well-spoken in her fashion and cute as hell, but still no more than three or four. \u0027Well, the beach is a good place to go on the Fourth, all right,\u0027 I said, \u0027but ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Fourth of July and fireworks too,\u0027 she agreed, making \u0027too\u0027 sound exotic and sweet, like a word in Vietnamese. \u0027 ¡ª but if you try to walk there on the highway, you\u0027re more apt to wind up in Castle Rock Hospital.\u0027 I decided I wasn\u0027t going to stand there playing Mister Rogers with her in the middle of Route 68, not with a curve only fifty yards to the south and a car apt to come wheeling around it at sixty miles an hour at any time. I could hear a motor, actually, and it was revving hard. I picked the kid up and carried her over to where my car was idling, and although she seemed perfectly content to be carried and not frightened a bit, I felt like Chester the Molester the second I had my arm locked under her bottom. I was very aware that anyone sitting around in the combined office and waiting room of Brooksie\u0027s Garage could look out and see me. This is one of the strange midlife realities of my generation: we can\u0027t touch a child who isn\u0027t our own without fearing others will see something lecherous in our touching . . . or without thinking, way down deep in the sewers of our psyches, that there probably is something lecherous in it. I got her out of the road, though. I did that much. Let the Marching Mothers of Western Maine come after me and do their worst. \u0027You take me beach?\u0027 the little girl asked. She was bright-eyed, smiling. I figured that she\u0027d probably be pregnant by the time she was twelve, especially given the cool way she was wearing her baseball cap. \u0027Got your suitie?\u0027 \u0027Actually I think I left my suitie at home. Don\u0027t you hate that? Honey, where\u0027s your mom?\u0027 As if in direct answer to my question, the car I\u0027d heard came busting out of a road on the near side of the curve. It was a Jeep Scout with mud splashed high up on both sides. The motor was growling like something up a tree and pissed off about it. A woman\u0027s head was poked out the side window. Little curie\u0027s mom must have been too scared to sit down; she was driving in a mad crouch, and if a car had been coming around that particular curve in Route 68 when she pulled out, my friend in the red bathing suit would likely have become an orphan on the spot. The Scout fishtailed, the head dropped back down inside the cab, and there was a grinding as the driver upshifted, trying to take her old heap from zero to sixty in maybe nine seconds. If pure terror could have done the job, I\u0027m sure she would have succeeded. \u0027That\u0027s Mattie,\u0027 the girl in the bathing suit said. \u0027I\u0027m mad at her. I\u0027m running away to have a Fourth at the beach. If she\u0027s mad I go to my white nana.\u0027 I had no idea what she was talking about, but it did cross my mind that Miss Bosox of 1998 could have her Fourth at the beach; I would settle for a fifth of something whole-grain at home. Meanwhile, I was waving the arm not under the kid\u0027s butt back and forth over my head, and hard enough to blow around wisps of the girl\u0027s fine blonde hair. \u0027Hey!\u0027 I shouted. \u0027Hey, lady! I got her!\u0027 The Scout sped by, still accelerating and still sounding pissed off about it. The exhaust was blowing clouds of blue smoke. There was a further hideous grinding from the Scout\u0027s old transmission. It was like some crazy version of Let\u0027s Make a Deal.\u0027 \u0027Mattie, you\u0027ve succeeded in getting into second gear ¡ª would you like to quit and take the Maytag washer, or do you want to try for third?\u0027 I did the only thing I could think of, which was to step out onto the road, turn toward the Jeep, which was now speeding away from me (the smell of the oil was thick and acrid), and hold the kid up high over my head, hoping Mattie would see us in her rearview mirror. I no longer felt like Chester the Molester; now I felt like a cruel auctioneer in a Disney cartoon, offering the cutest li\u0027l piglet in the litter to the highest bidder. It worked, though. The Scout\u0027s mudcaked taillights came on and there was a demonic howling as the badly used brakes locked. Right in front of Brooksie\u0027s, this was. If there were any old-timers in for a good Fourth of July gossip, they would now have plenty to gossip about. I thought they would especially enjoy the part where Mom screamed at me to unhand her baby. When you return to your summer home after a long absence, it\u0027s always nice to get off on the right foot. The backup lights flared and the Jeep began reversing down the road at a good twenty miles an hour. Now the transmission sounded not pissed off but panicky ¡ª please, it was saying, please stop, you\u0027re killing me. The Scout\u0027s rear end wagged from side to side like the tail of a happy dog. I watched it coming at me, hypnotized ¡ª now in the northbound lane, now across the white line and into the southbound lane, now overcorrecting so that the left-hand tires spumed dust off the shoulder. \u0027Mattie go fast,\u0027 my new girlfriend said in a conversational, isn\u0027t-this-interesting voice. She had one arm slung around my neck; we were chums, by God. But what the kid said woke me up. Mattie go fast, all right, too fast. Mattie would, more likely than not, clean out the rear end of my Chevrolet. And if I just stood here, Baby Snooks and I were apt to end up as toothpaste between the two vehicles. I backed the length of my car, keeping my eyes fixed on the Jeep and yelling, \u0027Slow down, Mattie! Slow down!\u0027 Cutie-pie liked that. \u0027S\u0027yo down!\u0027 she yelled, starting to laugh. \u0027S\u0027yo down, you old Mattie, s\u0027yo down!\u0027 The brakes screamed in fresh agony. The Jeep took one last walloping, unhappy jerk backward as Mattie stopped without benefit of the clutch. That final lunge took the Scout\u0027s rear bumper so close to the rear bumper of my Chevy that you could have bridged the gap with a cigarette. The smell of oil in the air was huge and furry. The kid was waving a hand in front of her face and coughing theatrically. The driver\u0027s door flew open; Mattie Devore flew out like a circus acrobat shot from a cannon, if you can imagine a circus acrobat dressed in old paisley shorts and a cotton smock top. My first thought was that the little girl\u0027s big sister had been babysitting her, that Mattie and Mummy were two different people. I knew that little kids often spend a period of their development calling their parents by their first names, but this pale-cheeked blonde girl looked all of twelve, fourteen at the outside. I decided her mad handling of the Scout hadn\u0027t been terror for her child (or not just terror) but total automotive inexperience. There was something else, too, okay? Another assumption that I made. The muddy four-wheel-drive, the baggy paisley shorts, the smock that all but screamed Kmart, the long yellow hair held back with those little red elastics, and most of all the inattention that allows the three-year-old in your care to go wandering off in the first place . . . all those things said trailer-trash to me. I know how that sounds, but I had some basis for it. Also, I\u0027m Irish, goddammit. My ancestors were trailer-trash when the trailers were still horse-drawn caravans. \u0027Stinky-phew!\u0027 the little girl said, still waving a pudgy hand at the air in front of her face. \u0027Scoutie stink!\u0027 Where Scoutie\u0027s bathing suitie? I thought, and then my new girlfriend was snatched out of my arms. Now that she was closer, my idea that Mattie was the bathing beauty\u0027s sister took a hit. Mattie wouldn\u0027t be middle-aged until well into the next century, but she wasn\u0027t twelve or fourteen, either. I now guessed twenty, maybe a year younger. When she snatched the baby away, I saw the wedding ring on her left hand. I also saw the dark circles under her eyes, gray skin dusting to purple. She was young, but I thought it was a mother\u0027s terror and exhaustion I was looking at. I expected her to swat the tot, because that\u0027s how trailer-trash moms react to being tired and scared. When she did, I would stop her, one way or another distract her into turning her anger on me, if that was what it took. There was nothing very noble in this, I should add; all I really wanted to do was to postpone the fanny-whacking, shoulder-shaking, and in-your-face shouting to a time and place where I wouldn\u0027t have to watch it. It was my first day back in town; I didn\u0027t want to spend any of it watching an inattentive slut abuse her child. Instead of shaking her and shouting \u0027Where did you think you were going, you little bitch?\u0027 Mattie first hugged the child (who hugged back enthusiastically, showing absolutely no sign of fear) and then covered her face with kisses. \u0027Why did you do that?\u0027 she cried. \u0027What was in your head? When I couldn\u0027t find you, I died.\u0027 Mattie burst into tears. The child in the bathing suit looked at her with an expression of surprise so big and complete it would have been comical under other circumstances. Then her own face crumpled up. I stood back, watched them crying and hugging, and felt ashamed of my preconceptions. A car went by and slowed down. An elderly couple ¡ª Ma and Pa Kettle on their way to the store for that holiday box of Grape-Nuts ¡ª gawked out. I gave them an impatient wave with both hands, the kind that says what are you staring at, go on, put an egg in your shoe and beat it. They sped up, but I didn\u0027t see an out-of-state license plate, as I\u0027d hoped I might. This version of Ma and Pa were locals, and the story would be fleeting its rounds soon enough: Mattie the teenage bride and her little bundle of joy (said bundle undoubtedly conceived in the back seat of a car or the bed of a pickup truck some months before the legitimizing ceremony), bawling their eyes out at the side of the road. With a stranger. No, not exactly a stranger. Mike Noonan, the writer fella from upstate. \u0027I wanted to go to the beach and suh-suh-swim!\u0027 the little girl wept, and now it was \u0027swim\u0027 that sounded exotic ¡ª the Vietnamese word for \u0027ecstasy,\u0027 perhaps. \u0027I said I\u0027d take you this afternoon.\u0027 Mattie was still sniffing, but getting herself under control. \u0027Don\u0027t do that again, little guy, please don\u0027t you ever do that again, Mommy was so scared.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 the kid said \u0027I really won\u0027t.\u0027 Still crying, she hugged the older girl tight, laying her head against the side of Mattie\u0027s neck. Her baseball cap fell off. I picked it up, beginning to feel very much like an outsider here. I poked the blue-and-red cap at Mattie\u0027s hand until her fingers closed on it. I decided I also felt pretty good about the way things had turned out, and maybe I had a right to. I\u0027ve presented the incident as if it was amusing, and it was, but it was the sort of amusing you never see until later. When it was happening, it was terrifying. Suppose there had been a truck coming from the other direction? Coming around that curve, and coming too fast? A vehicle did come around it, a pickup of the type no tourist ever drives. Two more locals gawked their way by. \u0027Ma\u0027am?\u0027 I said. \u0027Mattie? I think I\u0027d better get going. Glad your little girl is all right.\u0027 The minute it was out, I felt an almost irresistible urge to laugh. I could picture me drawling this speech to Mattie (a name that belonged in a movie like Unforgiven or True Grit if any name ever did) with my thumbs hooked into the belt of my chaps and my Stetson pushed back to reveal my noble brow. I felt an insane urge to add, \u0027You\u0027re right purty, ma\u0027am, ain\u0027t you the new schoolteacher?\u0027 She turned to me and I saw that she was right purty. Even with circles under her eyes and her blonde hair sticking off in gobs to either side of her head. And I thought she was doing okay for a girl probably not yet old enough to buy a drink in a bar. At least she hadn\u0027t belted the baby. \u0027Thank you so much,\u0027 she said. \u0027Was she right in the road?\u0027 Say she wasn\u0027t, her eyes begged. At least say she was walking along the shoulder. \u0027Well ¡ª \u0027 \u0027I walked on the line,\u0027 the girl said, pointing. \u0027It\u0027s like the cross-mock.\u0027 Her voice took on a faintly righteous tone. \u0027Crossmock is safe.\u0027 Mattie\u0027s cheeks, already white, turned whiter. I didn\u0027t like seeing her that way, and didn\u0027t like to think of her driving home that way, especially with a kid. \u0027Where do you live, Mrs. ¡ª ?\u0027 \u0027Devore,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m Mattie Devore.\u0027 She shifted the child and put out her hand. I shook it. The morning was warm, and it was going to be hot by mid-afternoon ¡ª beach weather for sure ¡ª but the fingers I touched were icy. \u0027We live just there.\u0027 She pointed to the intersection the Scout had shot out of, and I could see ¡ª surprise, surprise ¡ª a doublewide trailer set off in a grove of pines about two hundred feet up the little feeder road. Wasp Hill Road, I recalled. It ran about half a mile from Route 68 to the water ¡ª what was known as the Middle Bay. Ah yes, doc, it\u0027s all coming back to me now. I\u0027m once more riding the Dark Score range. Saving little kids is my specialty. Still, I was relieved to see that she lived close by ¡ª less than a quarter of a mile from the place where our respective vehicles were parked with their tails almost touching ¡ª and when I thought about it, it stood to reason. A child as young as the bathing beauty couldn\u0027t have walked far . . . although this one had already demonstrated a fair degree of determination. I thought Mother\u0027s haggard look was even more suggestive of the daughter\u0027s will. I was glad I was too old to be one of her future boyfriends; she would have them jumping through hoops all through high school and college. Hoops of fire, likely. Well, the high-school part, anyway. Girls from the doublewide side of town did not, as a general rule, go to college unless there was a juco or a voke-tech handy. And she would only have them jumping until the right boy (or more likely the wrong one) came sweeping around the Great Curve of Life and ran her down in the highway, her all the while unaware that the white line and the crossmock were two different things. Then the whole cycle would repeat itself. Christ almighty, Noonan, quit it, I told myself. She\u0027s three years old and you\u0027ve already got her with three kids of her own, two with ringworm and one retarded. \u0027Thank you so much,\u0027 Mattie repeated. \u0027That\u0027s okay,\u0027 I said, and snubbed the little girl\u0027s nose. Although her cheeks were still wet with tears, she grinned at me sunnily enough in response. \u0027This is a very verbal little girl.\u0027 \u0027Very verbal, and very willful.\u0027 Now Mattie did give her child a little shake, but the kid showed no fear, no sign that shaking or hitting was the order of most days. On the contrary, her smile widened. Her mother smiled back. And yes ¡ª once you got past the slopped-together look of her, she was most extraordinarily pretty. Put her in a tennis dress at the Castle Rock Country Club (where she\u0027d likely never go in her life, except maybe as a maid or a waitress), and she would maybe be more than pretty. A young Grace Kelly, perhaps. Then she looked back at me, her eyes very wide and grave. \u0027Mr. Noonan, I\u0027m not a bad mother,\u0027 she said. I felt a start at my name coming from her mouth, but it was only momentary. She was the right age, after all, and my books were probably better for her than spending her afternoons in front of General Hospital and One Life to Live. A little, anyway. \u0027We had an argument about when we were going to the beach. I wanted to hang out the clothes, have lunch, and go this afternoon. Kyra wanted ¡ª \u0027 She broke off. \u0027What? What did I say?\u0027 \u0027Her name is Kia? Did ¡ª \u0027 Before I could say anything else, the most extraordinary thing happened: my mouth was full of water. So full I felt a moment\u0027s panic, like someone who is swimming in the ocean and swallows a wave-wash. Only this wasn\u0027t a salt taste; it was cold and fresh, with a faint metal tang like blood. I turned my head aside and spat. I expected a gush of liquid to pour out of my mouth ¡ª the sort of gush you sometimes get when commencing artificial respiration on a near-drowning victim. What came out instead was what usually comes out when you spit on a hot day: a little white pellet. And that sensation was gone even before the little white pellet struck the dirt of the shoulder. In an instant, as if it had never been there. \u0027That man spirted,\u0027 the girl said matter-of-factly. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I said. I was also bewildered. What in God\u0027s name had that been about? \u0027I guess I had a little delayed reaction.\u0027 Mattie looked concerned, as though I were eighty instead of forty. I thought that maybe to a girl her age, forty is eighty. \u0027Do you want to come up to the house? I\u0027ll give you a glass of water.\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027m fine now.\u0027 \u0027All right. Mr. Noonan . . . all I mean is that nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I was hanging sheets . . . she was inside watching a Mighty Mouse cartoon on the VCR . . . then, when I went in to get more pins . . . \u0027 She looked at the girl, who was no longer smiling. It was starting to get through to her now. Her eyes were big, and ready to fill with tears. \u0027She was gone. I thought for a minute I\u0027d die of fear.\u0027 Now the kid\u0027s mouth began to tremble, and her eyes filled up right on schedule. She began to weep. Mattie stroked her hair, soothing the small head until it lay against the Kmart smock top. \u0027That\u0027s all right, Ki,\u0027 she said. \u0027It turned out okay this time, but you can\u0027t go out in the road. It\u0027s dangerous. Little things get run over in the road, and you\u0027re a little thing. The most precious little thing in the world.\u0027 She cried harder. It was the exhausted sound of a child who needed a nap before any more adventures, to the beach or anywhere else. \u0027Kia bad, Kia bad,\u0027 she sobbed against her mother\u0027s neck. \u0027No, honey, only three,\u0027 Mattie said, and if I had harbored any further thoughts about her being a bad mother, they melted away then. Or perhaps they\u0027d already gone ¡ª after all, the kid was round, comely, well-kept, and unbruised. On one level, those things registered. On another I was trying to cope with the strange thing that had just happened, and the equally strange thing I thought I was hearing ¡ª that the little girl I had carried off the white line had the name we had planned to give our child, if our child turned out to be a girl. \u0027Kia,\u0027 I said. Marvelled, really. As if my touch might break her, I tentatively stroked the back of her head. Her hair was sun-warm and fine. \u0027No,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027That\u0027s the best she can say it now. Kyra, not Kia. It\u0027s from the Greek. It means ladylike.\u0027 She shifted, a little self-conscious. \u0027I picked it out of a baby-name book. While I was pregnant, I kind of went Oprah. Better than going postal, I guess.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a lovely name,\u0027 I said. \u0027And I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a bad mom.\u0027 What went through my mind right then was a story Frank Arlen had told over a meal at Christmas ¡ª it had been about Petie, the youngest brother, and Frank had had the whole table in stitches. Even Petie, who claimed not to remember a bit of the incident, laughed until tears streamed down his cheeks. One Easter, Frank said, when Petie was about five, their folks had gotten them up for an Easter-egg hunt. The two parents had hidden over a hundred colored hard-boiled eggs around the house the evening before, after getting the kids over to their grandparents\u0027. A high old Easter morning was had by all, at least until Johanna looked up from the patio, where she was counting her share of the spoils, and shrieked. There was Petie, crawling gaily around on the second-floor overhang at the back of the house, not six feet from the drop to the concrete patio. Mr. Arlen had rescued Petie while the rest of the family stood below, holding hands, frozen with horror and fascination. Mrs. Arlen had repeated the Hail Mary over and over (\u0027so fast she sounded like one of the Chipmunks on that old \u0027Witch Doctor\u0027 record,\u0027 Frank had said, laughing harder than ever) until her husband had disappeared back into the open bedroom window with Petie in his arms. Then she had swooned to the pavement, breaking her nose. When asked for an explanation, Petie had told them he\u0027d wanted to check the rain-gutter for eggs. I suppose every family has at least one story like that; the survival of the world\u0027s Peties and Kyras is a convincing argument ¡ª in the minds of parents, anyway for the existence of God. \u0027I was so scared,\u0027 Mattie said, now looking fourteen again. Fifteen at most. \u0027But it\u0027s over,\u0027 I said. \u0027And Kyra\u0027s not going to go walking in the road anymore. Are you, Kyra?\u0027 She shook her head against her mother\u0027s shoulder without raising it. I had an idea she\u0027d probably be asleep before Mattie got her back to the good old doublewide. \u0027You don\u0027t know how bizarre this is for me,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027One of my favorite writers comes out of nowhere and saves my kid. I knew you had a place on the TR, that big old log house everyone calls Sara Laughs, but folks say you don\u0027t come here anymore since your wife died.\u0027 \u0027For a long time I didn\u0027t,\u0027 I said. \u0027If Sara was a marriage instead of a house, you\u0027d call this a trial reconciliation.\u0027 She smiled fleetingly, then looked grave again. \u0027I want to ask you for something. A favor.\u0027 \u0027Ask away.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t talk about this. It\u0027s not a good time for Ki and me.\u0027 \u0027Why not?\u0027 She bit her lip and seemed to consider answering the question ¡ª -one I might not have asked, given an extra moment to consider ¡ª and then shook her head. \u0027It\u0027s just not. And I\u0027d be so grateful if you didn\u0027t talk about what just happened in town. More grateful than you\u0027ll ever know.\u0027 \u0027No problem.\u0027 \u0027You mean it?\u0027 \u0027Sure. I\u0027m basically a summer person who hasn\u0027t been around for awhile . . . which means I don\u0027t have many folks to talk to, anyway.\u0027 There was Bill Dean, of course, but I could keep quiet around him. Not that he wouldn\u0027t know. If this little lady thought the locals weren\u0027t going to find out about her daughter\u0027s attempt to get to the beach by shank\u0027s mare, she was fooling herself. \u0027I think we\u0027ve been noticed already, though. Take a look up at Brooksie\u0027s Garage. Peek, don\u0027t stare.\u0027 She did, and sighed. Two old men were standing on the tarmac where there had been gas pumps once upon a time. One was very likely Brooksie himself; I thought I could see the remnants of the flyaway red hair which had always made him look like a downeast version of Bozo the Clown. The other, old enough to make Brooksie look like a wee slip of a lad, was leaning on a gold-headed cane in a way that was queerly vulpine. \u0027I can\u0027t do anything about them,\u0027 she said, sounding depressed. \u0027Nobody can do anything about them. I guess I should count myself lucky it\u0027s a holiday and there\u0027s only two of them.\u0027 \u0027Besides,\u0027 I added, \u0027they probably didn\u0027t see much.\u0027 Which ignored two things: first, that half a dozen cars and pick-em-ups had gone by while we had been standing here, and second, that whatever Brooksie and his elderly friend hadn\u0027t seen, they would be more than happy to make up. On Mattie\u0027s shoulder, Kyra gave a ladylike snore. Mattie glanced at her and gave her a smile full of rue and love. \u0027I\u0027m sorry we had to meet under circumstances that make me look like such a dope, because I really am a big fan. They say at the bookstore in Castle Rock that you\u0027ve got a new one coming out this summer.\u0027 I nodded. \u0027It\u0027s called Helen\u0027s Promise.\u0027 She grinned. \u0027Good title.\u0027 \u0027Thanks. You better get your buddy back home before she breaks your arm.\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 There are people in this world who have a knack for asking embarrassing, awkward questions without meaning to ¡ª it\u0027s like a talent for walking into doors. I am one of that tribe, and as I walked with her toward the passenger side of the Scout, I found a good one. And yet it was hard to blame myself too enthusiastically. I had seen the wedding ring on her hand, after all. \u0027Will you tell your husband?\u0027 Her smile stayed on, but it paled somehow. And tightened. If it were possible to delete a spoken question the way you can delete a line of type when you\u0027re writing a story, I would have done it. \u0027He died last August.\u0027 \u0027Mattie, I\u0027m sorry. Open mouth, insert foot.\u0027 \u0027You couldn\u0027t know. A girl my age isn\u0027t even supposed to be married, is she? And if she is, her husband\u0027s supposed to be in the army, or something.\u0027 There was a pink baby-seat ¡ª also Kmart, I guessed ¡ª on the passenger side of the Scout. Mattie tried to boost Kyra in, but I could see she was struggling. I stepped forward to help her, and for just a moment, as I reached past her to grab a plump leg, the back of my hand brushed her breast. She couldn\u0027t step back unless she wanted to risk Kyra\u0027s slithering out of the seat and onto the floor, but I could feel her recording the touch. My husband\u0027s dead, not a threat, so the big-deal writer thinks it\u0027s okay to cop a little feel on a hot summer morning. And what can I say? Mr. Big Deal came along and hauled my kid out of the road, maybe saved her life. No, Mattie, I may be forty going on a hundred, but I was not copping a feel. Except I couldn\u0027t say that; it would only make things worse. I felt my cheeks flush a little. \u0027How old are you?\u0027 I asked, when we had the baby squared away and were back at a safe distance. She gave me a look. Tired or not, she had it together again. \u0027Old enough to know the situation I\u0027m in.\u0027 She held out her hand. \u0027Thanks again, Mr. Noonan. God sent you along at the right time.\u0027 \u0027Nah, God just told me I needed a hamburger at the Village Cafe,\u0027 I said. \u0027Or maybe it was His opposite number. Please say Buddy\u0027s still doing business at the same old stand.\u0027 She smiled. It warmed her face back up again, and I was happy to see it. \u0027He\u0027ll still be there when Ki\u0027s kids are old enough to try buying beer with fake IDS. Unless someone wanders in off the road and asks for something like shrimp tetrazzini. If that happened he\u0027d probably drop dead of a heart attack.\u0027 \u0027Yeah. Well, when I get copies of the new book, I\u0027ll drop one off.\u0027 The smile continued to hang in there, but now it shaded toward caution. \u0027You don\u0027t need to do that, Mr. Noonan.\u0027 \u0027No, but I will. My agent gets me fifty comps. I find that as I get older, they go further.\u0027 Perhaps she heard more in my voice than I had meant to put there ¡ª people do sometimes, I guess. \u0027All right. I\u0027ll look forward to it.\u0027 I took another look at the baby, sleeping in that queerly casual way they have ¡ª her head tilted over on her shoulder, her lovely little lips pursed and blowing a bubble. Their skin is what kills me ¡ª so fine and perfect there seem to be no pores at all. Her Sox hat was askew. Mattie watched me reach in and readjust it so the visor\u0027s shade fell across her closed eyes. \u0027Kyra,\u0027 I said. Mattie nodded. \u0027Ladylike.\u0027 \u0027Kia is an African name,\u0027 I said. \u0027It means \u0027season\u0027s beginning.\u0027\u0027 I left her then, giving her a little wave as I headed back to the driver\u0027s side of the Chevy. I could feel her curious eyes on me, and I had the oddest feeling that I was going to cry. That feeling stayed with me long after the two of them were out of sight; was still with me when I got to the Village Cafe. I pulled into the dirt parking lot to the left of the off-brand gas pumps and just sat there for a little while, thinking about Jo and about a home pregnancy-testing kit which had cost twenty-two-fifty. A little secret she\u0027d wanted to keep until she was absolutely sure. That must have been it; what else could it have been? \u0027Kia,\u0027 I said. \u0027Season\u0027s beginning.\u0027 But that made me feel like crying again, so I got out of the car and slammed the door hard behind me, as if I could keep the sadness inside that way.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-8.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
