{"id":78360,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The ringing of the phone ¡ª or, more accurately, the way I received the ringing of the phone ¡ª was as familiar as the creaks of my chair or the hum of the old IBM Selectric. It seemed to come from far away at first, then to approach like a whistling train coming down on a crossing. There was no extension in my office or Jo\u0027s; the upstairs phone, an old-fashioned rotary-dial, was on a table in the hall between them ¡ª in what Jo used to call \u0027no-man\u0027s-land.\u0027 The temperature out there must have been at least ninety degrees, but the air still felt cool on my skin after the office. I was so oiled with sweat that I looked like a slightly pot-bellied version of the muscle-boys I sometimes saw when I was working out. \u0027Hello?\u0027 \u0027Mike? Did I wake you? Were you sleeping?\u0027 It was Mattie, but a different one from last night. This one wasn\u0027t afraid or even tentative; this one sounded so happy she was almost bubbling over. It was almost certainly the Mattie who had attracted Lance Devore. \u0027Not sleeping,\u0027 I said. \u0027Writing a little.\u0027 \u0027Get out! I thought you were retired.\u0027 \u0027I thought so, too,\u0027 I said, \u0027but maybe I was a little hasty. What\u0027s going on? You sound over the moon.\u0027 \u0027I just got off the phone with John Storrow ¡ª \u0027 Really? How long had I been on the second floor, anyway? I looked at my wrist and saw nothing but a pale circle. It was half-past freckles and skin o\u0027clock, as we used to say when we were kids; my watch was downstairs in the north bedroom, probably lying in a puddle of water from my overturned night-glass. \u0027 ¡ª his age, and that he can subpoena the other son!\u0027 \u0027Whoa,\u0027 I said. \u0027You lost me. Go back and slow down.\u0027 She did. Telling the hard news didn\u0027t take long (it rarely does): Storrow was coming up tomorrow. He would land at County Airport and stay at the Lookout Rock Hotel in Castle View. The two of them would spend most of Friday discussing the case. \u0027Oh, and he found a lawyer for you,\u0027 she said. \u0027To go with you to your deposition. I think he\u0027s from Lewiston.\u0027 It all sounded good, but what mattered a lot more than the bare facts was that Mattie had recovered her will to fight. Until this morning (if it was still morning; the light coming in the window above the broken air conditioner suggested that if it was, it wouldn\u0027t be much longer) I hadn\u0027t realized how gloomy the young woman in the red sundress and tidy white sneakers had been. How far down the road to believing she would lose her child. \u0027This is great. I\u0027m so glad, Mattie.\u0027 \u0027And you did it. If you were here, I\u0027d give you the biggest kiss you ever had.\u0027 \u0027He told you you could win, didn\u0027t he?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027And you believe him.\u0027 \u0027Yes!\u0027 Then her voice dropped a little. \u0027He wasn\u0027t exactly thrilled when I told him I\u0027d had you over to dinner last night, though.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027I didn\u0027t think he would be.\u0027 \u0027I told him we ate in the yard and he said we only had to be inside together for sixty seconds to start the gossip.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d say he\u0027s got an insultingly low opinion of Yankee lovin,\u0027 I said, \u0027but of course he\u0027s from New York.\u0027 She laughed harder than my little joke warranted, I thought. Out of semi-hysterical relief that she now had a couple of protectors? Because the whole subject of sex was a tender one for her just now? Best not to speculate. \u0027He didn\u0027t paddle me too hard about it, but he made it clear that he would if we did it again. When this is over, though, I\u0027m having you for a real meal. We\u0027ll have everything you like, just the way you like it.\u0027 Everything you like, just the way you like it. And she was, by God and Sonny Jesus, completely unaware that what she was saying might have another meaning ¡ª I would have bet on it. I closed my eyes for a moment, smiling. Why not smile? Everything she was saying sounded absolutely great, especially once you cleared the confines of Michael Noonan\u0027s dirty mind. It sounded like we might have the expected fairy-tale ending, if we could keep our courage and hold our course. And if I could restrain myself from making a pass at a girl young enough to be my daughter . . . outside of my dreams, that was. If I couldn\u0027t, I probably deserved whatever I got. But Kyra wouldn\u0027t. She was the hood ornament in all this, doomed to go wherever the car took her. If I got any of the wrong ideas, I\u0027d do well to remember that. \u0027If the judge sends Devore home empty-handed, I\u0027ll take you out to Renoir Nights in Portland and buy you nine courses of French chow,\u0027 I said. \u0027Storrow, too. I\u0027ll even spring for the legal beagle I\u0027m dating on Friday. So who\u0027s better than me, huh?\u0027 \u0027No one I know,\u0027 she said, sounding serious. \u0027I\u0027ll pay you back for this, Mike. I\u0027m down now, but I won\u0027t always be down. If it takes me the rest of my life, I\u0027ll pay you back.\u0027 \u0027Mattie, you don\u0027t have to ¡ª \u0027 \u0027I do,\u0027 she said with quiet vehemence. \u0027I do. And I have to do something else today, too.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 I loved hearing her sound the way she did this morning ¡ª so happy and free, like a prisoner who has just been pardoned and let out of jail ¡ª but already I was looking longingly at the door to my office. I couldn\u0027t do much more today, I\u0027d end up baked like an apple if I tried, but I wanted another page or two, at least. Do what you want, both women had said in my dreams. Do what you want. \u0027I have to buy Kyra the big teddybear they have at the Castle Rock Wal-Mart,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll tell her it\u0027s for being a good girl because I can\u0027t tell her it\u0027s for walking in the middle of the road when you were coming the other way.\u0027 \u0027Just not a black one,\u0027 I said. The words were out of my mouth before I knew they were even in my head. \u0027Huh?\u0027 Sounding startled and doubtful. \u0027I said bring me back one,\u0027 I said, the words once again out and down the wire before I even knew they were there. \u0027Maybe I will,\u0027 she said, sounding amused. Then her tone grew serious again. \u0027And if I said anything last night that made you unhappy, even for a minute, I\u0027m sorry. I never for the world ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m not unhappy. A little confused, that\u0027s all. In fact I\u0027d pretty much forgotten about Jo\u0027s mystery date.\u0027 A lie, but in what seemed to me to be a good cause. \u0027That\u0027s probably for the best. I won\u0027t keep you ¡ª go on back to work. It\u0027s what you want to do, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 I was startled. \u0027What makes you say that?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, I just . . . \u0027 She stopped. And I suddenly knew two things: What she had been about to say, and that she wouldn\u0027t say it. I dreamed about you last night. I dreamed about us together. were going to make love and one of us said \u0027Do what you want.\u0027 Or maybe, I don\u0027t know, maybe we both said it. Perhaps sometimes ghosts were alive ¡ª minds and desires divorced from their bodies, unlocked impulses floating unseen. Ghosts from the id, spooks from low places. \u0027Mattie? Still there?\u0027 \u0027Sure, you bet. Do you want me to stay in touch? Or will you hear all you need from John Storrow?\u0027 \u0027If you don\u0027t stay in touch, I\u0027ll be pissed at you. Royally.\u0027 She laughed. \u0027I will, then. But not when you\u0027re working. Goodbye, Mike. And thanks again. So much.\u0027 I told her goodbye, then stood there for a moment looking at the old fashioned Bakelite phone handset after she had hung up. She\u0027d call and keep me updated, but not when I was working. How would she know when that was? She just would. As I\u0027d known last night that she was lying when she said Jo and the man with the elbow patches on the sleeves of his sportcoat had walked off toward the parking lot. Mattie had been wearing a pair of white shorts and a halter top when she called me, no dress or skirt required today because it was Wednesday and the library was closed on Wednesday. You don\u0027t know any of that. You\u0027re just making it up. But I wasn\u0027t. If I\u0027d been making it up, I probably would have put her in something a little more suggestive ¡ª a Merry Widow from Victoria\u0027s Secret, perhaps. That thought called up another. Do what you want, they had said. Both of them. Do what you want. And that was a line I knew. While on Key Largo I\u0027d read an Atlantic Monthly essay on pornography by some feminist. I wasn\u0027t sure which one, only that it hadn\u0027t been Naomi Wolf or Camille Paglia. This woman had been of the conservative stripe, and she had used that phrase. Sally Tisdale, maybe? Or was my mind just hearing echo-distortions of Sara Tidwell? Whoever it had been, she\u0027d claimed that \u0027do what I want\u0027 was the basis of erotica which appealed to women and \u0027do what you want\u0027 was the basis of pornography which appealed to men. Women imagine speaking the former line in sexual situations; men imagine having the latter line spoken to them. And, the writer went on, when real-world sex goes bad ¡ª sometimes turning violent, sometimes shaming, sometimes just unsuccessful from the female partner\u0027s point of view ¡ª porn is often the unindicted co-conspirator. The man is apt to round on the woman angrily and cry, \u0027You wanted me to! Quit lying and admit it! You wanted me to!\u0027 The writer claimed it was what every man hoped to hear in the bedroom: Do what you want. Bite me, sodomize me, lick between my toes, drink wine out of my navel, give me a hairbrush and raise your ass for me to paddle, it doesn\u0027t matter. Do what you want. The door is closed and we are here, but really only you are here, I am just a willing extension of your fantasies and only you are here. I have no wants of my own, no needs of my own, no taboos. Do what you want to this shadow, this fantasy, this ghost. I\u0027d thought the essayist at least fifty per cent full of shit; the assumption that a man can find real sexual pleasure only by turning a woman into a kind of jackoff accessory says more about the observer than the participants. This lady had had a lot of jargon and a fair amount of wit, but underneath she was only saying what Somerset Maugham, Jo\u0027s old favorite, had had Sadie Thompson say in \u0027Rain,\u0027 a story written eighty years before: men are pigs, filthy, dirty pigs, all of them. But we are not pigs, as a rule, not beasts, or at least not unless we are pushed to the final extremity. And if we are pushed to it, the issue is rarely sex; it\u0027s usually territory. I\u0027ve heard feminists argue that to men sex and territory are interchangeable, and that is very far from the truth. I padded back to the office, opened the door, and behind me the telephone rang again. And here was another familiar sensation, back for a return visit after four years: that anger at the telephone, the urge to simply rip it out of the wall and fire it across the room. Why did the whole world have to call while I was writing? Why couldn\u0027t they just . . . well. . let me do what I wanted? I gave a doubtful laugh and returned to the phone, seeing the wet handprint on it from my last call. \u0027Hello?\u0027 \u0027I said to stay visible while you were with her.\u0027 \u0027Good morning to you, too, Lawyer Storrow.\u0027 \u0027You must be in another time-zone up there, chum. I\u0027ve got one-fifteen down here in New York.\u0027 \u0027I had dinner with her,\u0027 I said. \u0027Outside. It\u0027s true that I read the little kid a story and helped put her to bed, but ¡ª \u0027 \u0027I imagine half the town thinks you\u0027re bopping each other\u0027s brains out by now, and the other half will think it if I have to show up for her in court.\u0027 But he didn\u0027t sound really angry; I thought he sounded as though he was having a happy-face day. \u0027Can they make you tell who\u0027s paying for your services?\u0027 I asked. \u0027At the custody hearing, I mean?\u0027 \u0027Nope.\u0027 \u0027At my deposition on Friday?\u0027 \u0027Christ, no. Durgin would lose all credibility as guardian ad litem if he went in that direction. Also, they have reasons to steer clear of the sex angle. Their focus is on Mattie as neglectful and perhaps abusive. Proving that Mom isn\u0027t a nun quit working around the time Kramer vs. Kramer came out in the movie theaters. Nor is that the only problem they have with the issue.\u0027 He now sounded positively gleeful. \u0027Tell me.\u0027 \u0027Max Devore is eighty-five and divorced. Twice divorced, in point of fact. Before awarding custody to a single man of his age, secondary custody has to be taken into consideration. It is, in fact, the single most important issue, other than the allegations of abuse and neglect levelled at the mother.\u0027 \u0027What are those allegations? Do you know?\u0027 \u0027No. Mattie doesn\u0027t either, because they\u0027re fabrications. She\u0027s a sweetie, by the way ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Yeah, she is.\u0027 \u0027 ¡ª and I think she\u0027s going to make a great witness. I can\u0027t wait to meet her in person. Meantime, don\u0027t sidetrack me. We\u0027re talking about secondary custody, right?\u0027 \u0027Right.\u0027 \u0027Devore has a daughter who has been declared mentally incompetent and lives in an institution somewhere in California ¡ª Modesto, I think. Not a good bet for custody.\u0027 \u0027It wouldn\u0027t seem so.\u0027 \u0027The son, Roger, is . . . \u0027 I heard a faint fluttering of notebook pages. \u0027 . . . fifty-four. So he\u0027s not exactly a spring chicken, either. Still, there are lots of guys who become daddies at that age nowadays; it\u0027s a brave new world. But Roger is a homosexual.\u0027 I thought of Bill Dean saying, Rump-wrangler. Understand there\u0027s a lot of that going around out them in California. \u0027I thought you said sex doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 \u0027Maybe I should have said hetero sex doesn\u0027t matter. In certain states ¡ª California is one of them homo sex doesn\u0027t matter, either . . . or not as much. But this case isn\u0027t going to be adjudicated in California. It\u0027s going to be adjudicated in Maine, where folks are less enlightened about how well two married men ¡ª married to each other, I mean ¡ª can raise a little girl.\u0027 \u0027Roger Devore is married?\u0027 Okay. I admit it. I now felt a certain horrified glee myself. I was ashamed of it ¡ª Roger Devore was just a guy living his life, and he might not have had much or anything to do with his elderly dad\u0027s current enterprise ¡ª but I felt it just the same. \u0027He and a software designer named Morris Ridding tied the knot in 1996,\u0027 John said. \u0027I found that on the first computer sweep. And if this does wind up in court, I intend to make as much of it as I possibly can. I don\u0027t know how much that will be ¡ª at this point it\u0027s impossible to predict ¡ª but if I get a chance to paint a picture of that bright-eyed, cheerful little girl growing up with two elderly gays who probably spend most of their lives in computer chat-rooms speculating about what Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock might have done after the lights were out in officers\u0027 country . . . well, if I get that chance, I\u0027ll take it.\u0027 \u0027It seems a little mean,\u0027 I said. I heard myself speaking in the tone of a man who wants to be dissuaded, perhaps even laughed at, but that didn\u0027t happen. \u0027Of course it\u0027s mean. It feels like swerving up onto the sidewalk to knock over a couple of innocent bystanders. Roger Devore and Morris Ridding don\u0027t deal drugs, traffic in little boys, or rob old ladies. But this is custody, and custody does an even better job than divorce of turning human beings into insects. This one isn\u0027t as bad as it could be, but it\u0027s bad enough because it\u0027s so naked. Max Devore came up there to his old hometown for one reason and one reason only: to buy a kid. That makes me mad.\u0027 I grinned, imagining a lawyer who looked like Elmer Fudd standing outside of a rabbit-hole marked DEVORE with a shotgun. \u0027My message to Devore is going to be very simple: the price of the kid just went up. Probably to a figure higher than even he can afford.\u0027 \u0027If it goes to court ¡ª you\u0027ve said that a couple of times now. Do you think there\u0027s a chance Devore might just drop it and go away?\u0027 \u0027A pretty good one, yeah. I\u0027d say an excellent one if he wasn\u0027t old and used to getting his own way. There\u0027s also the question of whether or not he\u0027s still sharp enough to know where his best interest lies. I\u0027ll try for a meeting with him and his lawyer while I\u0027m up there, but so far I haven\u0027t managed to get past his secretary.\u0027 \u0027Rogette Whitmore?\u0027 \u0027No, I think she\u0027s a step further up the ladder. I haven\u0027t talked to her yet, either. But I will.\u0027 \u0027Try either Richard Osgood or George Footman,\u0027 I said. \u0027Either of them may be able to put you in touch with Devore or Devore\u0027s chief counsel.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll want to talk to the Whitmore woman in any case. Men like Devore tend to grow more and more dependent on their close advisors as they grow older, and she could be a key to getting him to let this go. She could also be a headache for us. She might urge him to fight, possibly because she really thinks he can win and possibly because she wants to watch the fur fly. Also, she might marry him.\u0027 \u0027Marry him?\u0027 \u0027Why not? He could have her sign a pre-nup ¡ª I could no more\u0027 introduce that in court than his lawyers could go fishing for who hired Mattie\u0027s lawyer ¡ª and it would strengthen his chances.\u0027 \u0027John, I\u0027ve seen the woman. She\u0027s got to be seventy herself.\u0027 \u0027But she\u0027s a potential female player in a custody case involving a little girl, and she\u0027s a layer between old man Devore and the married gay couple. We just need to keep it in mind.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 I looked at the office door again, but not so longingly. There comes a point when you\u0027re done for the day whether you want to be or not, and I thought I had reached that point. Perhaps in the evening . . . \u0027The lawyer I got for you is named Romeo Bissonette.\u0027 He paused. \u0027Can that be a real name?\u0027 \u0027Is he from Lewiston?\u0027 \u0027Yes, how did you know?\u0027 \u0027Because in Maine, especially around Lewiston, that can be a real name. Am I supposed to go see him?\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to go see him. It was fifty miles to Lewiston over two-lane roads which would now be crawling with campers and Winnebagos. What I wanted was to go swimming and then take a long nap. A long dreamless nap. \u0027You don\u0027t need to. Call him and talk to him a little. He\u0027s only a safety net, really ¡ª he\u0027ll object if the questioning leaves the incident on the morning of July Fourth. About that incident you tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Got it?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Talk to him before, then meet him on Friday at . . . wait . . . it\u0027s right here . . . \u0027 The notebook pages fluttered again. \u0027Meet him at the Route 120 Diner at nine-fifteen. Coffee. Talk a little, get to know each other, maybe flip for the check. I\u0027ll be with Mattie, getting as much as I can. We may want to hire a private dick.\u0027 \u0027I love it when you talk dirty.\u0027 \u0027Uh-huh. I\u0027m going to see that bills go to your guy Goldacre. He\u0027ll send them to your agent, and your agent can ¡ª \u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027Instruct Goldacre to send them directly here. Harold\u0027s a Jewish mother. How much is this going to cost me?\u0027 \u0027Seventy-five thousand dollars, minimum,\u0027 he said with no hesitation at all. With no apology in his voice, either. \u0027Don\u0027t tell Mattie.\u0027 \u0027All right. Are you having any fun yet, Mike?\u0027 \u0027You know, I sort of am,\u0027 I said thoughtfully. \u0027For seventy-five grand, you should.\u0027 We said our goodbyes and John hung up. As I put my own phone back into its cradle, it occurred to me that I had lived more in the last five days than I had in the last four years. This time the phone didn\u0027t ring and I made it all the way back into the office, but I knew I was definitely done for the day. I sat down at the IBM, hit the RETURN key a couple of times, and was beginning to write myself a next-note at the bottom of the page I\u0027d been working on when the phone interrupted me. What a sour little doodad the telephone is, and what little good news we get from it! Today had been an exception, though, and I thought I could sign off with a grin. I was working, after all ¡ª working. Part of me still marvelled that I was sitting here at all, breathing easily, my heart beating steadily in my chest, and not even a glimmer of an anxiety attack on my personal event horizon. I wrote: [NEXT: Drake to Raiford. Stops on the way at vegetable stand to talk to the guy who runs it, old source, needs a good \u0026 colorful name. Straw hat. Disneyworld tee-shirt. They talk about Shackleford.] I turned the roller until the IBM spat this page out, stuck it on top of the manuscript, and jotted a final note to myself: \u0027Call Ted Rosencrief about Raiford.\u0027 Rosencrief was a retired Navy man who lived in Derry. I had employed him as a research assistant on several books, using him on one project to find out how paper was made, what the migratory habits of certain common birds were for another, a little bit about the architecture of pyramid burial rooms for a third. And it\u0027s always \u0027a little bit\u0027 I want, never \u0027the whole damn thing.\u0027 As a writer, my motto has always been don\u0027t confuse me with the facts. The Arthur Hailey type of fiction is beyond me ¡ª I can\u0027t read it, let alone write it. I want to know just enough so I can lie colorfully. Rosie knew that, and we had always worked well together. This time I needed to know a little bit about Florida\u0027s Raiford Prison, and what the deathhouse down there is really like. I also needed a little bit on the psychology of serial killers. I thought Rosie would probably be glad to hear from me . . . almost as glad as I was to finally have something to call him about. I picked up the eight double-spaced pages I had written and fanned through them, still amazed at their existence. Had an old IBM typewriter and a Courier type-ball been the secret all along? That was certainly how it seemed. What had come out was also amazing. I\u0027d had ideas during my four-year sabbatical; there had been no writer\u0027s block in that regard. One had been really great, the sort of thing which certainly would have become a novel if I\u0027d still been able to write novels. Half a dozen to a dozen were of the sort I\u0027d classify \u0027pretty good,\u0027 meaning they\u0027d do in a pinch . . . or if they happened to unexpectedly grow tall and mysterious overnight, like Jack\u0027s beanstalk. Sometimes they do. Most were glimmers, little \u0027what-ifs\u0027 that came and went like shooting stars while I was driving or walking or just lying in bed at night and waiting to go to sleep. The Red-Shirt Man was a what-if. One day I saw a man in a bright red shirt washing the show windows of the JC Penney store in Derry ¡ª this was not long before Penney\u0027s moved out to the mall. A young man and woman walked under his ladder . . . very bad luck, according to the old superstition. These two didn\u0027t know where they were walking, though ¡ª they were holding hands, drinking deeply of each other\u0027s eyes, as completely in love as any two twenty-year-olds in the history of the world. The man was tall, and as I watched, the top of his head came within an ace of clipping the window-washer\u0027s feet. If that had happened, the whole works might have gone over. The entire incident was history in five seconds. Writing The Red-Shirt Man took five months. Except in truth, the entire book was done in a what-if second. I imagined a collision instead of a near-miss. Everything else followed from there. The writing was just secretarial. The idea I was currently working on wasn\u0027t one of Mike\u0027s Really Great Ideas (Jo\u0027s voice carefully made the capitals), but it wasn\u0027t a what-if, either. Nor was it much like my old gothic suspense yarns; V. C. Andrews with a prick was nowhere in sight this time. But it felt solid, like the real thing, and this morning it had come out as naturally as a breath. Andy Drake was a private investigator in Key Largo. He was forty years old, divorced, the father of a three-year-old girl. At the open he was in the Key West home of a woman named Regina Whiting. Mrs. Whiting also had a little girl, hers five years old. Mrs. Whiting was married to an extremely rich developer who did not know what Andy Drake knew: that until 1992, Regina Taylor Whiting had been Tiffany Taylor, a high-priced Miami call-girl. That much I had written before the phone started ringing. Here is what I knew beyond that point, the secretarial work I\u0027d do over the next several weeks, assuming that my marvellously recovered ability to work held up: One day when Karen Whiting was three, the phone had rung while she and her mother were sitting in the patio hot tub. Regina thought of asking the yard-guy to answer it, then decided to get it herself-their regular man was out with the flu, and she didn\u0027t feel comfortable about asking a stranger for a favor. Cautioning her daughter to sit still, Regina hopped out to answer the phone. When Karen put up a hand to keep from being splashed as her mother left the tub, she dropped the doll she had been bathing. When she bent to pick it up, her hair became caught in one of the hot tub\u0027s powerful intakes. (It was reading of a fatal accident like this that had originally kicked the story off in my mind two or three years before.) The yard-man, some no-name in a khaki shirt sent over by a day-labor outfit, saw what was happening. He raced across the lawn, dove headfirst into the tub, and yanked the child from the bottom, leaving hair and a good chunk of scalp clogging the jet when he did. He\u0027d give her artificial respiration until she began to breathe again. (This would be a wonderful, suspenseful scene, and I couldn\u0027t wait to write it.) He would refuse all of the hysterical, relieved mother\u0027s offers of recompense, although he\u0027d finally give her an address so that her husband could talk to him. Only both the address and his name, John Sanborn, would turn out to be a fake. Two years later the ex-hooker with the respectable second life sees the man who saved her child on the front page of the Miami paper. His name is given as John Shackleford and he has been arrested for the rape-murder of a nine-year-old girl. And, the article goes on, he is suspected in over forty other murders, many of the victims children. \u0027Have you caught Baseball Cap?\u0027 one of the reporters would yell at the press conference. \u0027Is John Shackleford Baseball Cap?\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 I said, going downstairs, \u0027they sure think he is.\u0027 I could hear too many boats out on the lake this afternoon to make nude bathing an option. I pulled on my suit, slung a towel over my shoulders, and started down the path ¡ª the one which had been lined with glowing paper lanterns in my dream ¡ª to wash off the sweat of my nightmares and my unexpected morning\u0027s labors. There are twenty-three railroad-tie steps between Sara and the lake. I had gone down only four or five before the enormity of what had just happened hit me. My mouth began to tremble. The colors of the trees and the sky mixed together as my eyes teared up. A sound began to come out of me ¡ª a kind of muffled groaning. The strength ran out of my legs and I sat down hard on a railroad tie. For a moment I thought it was over, mostly just a false alarm, and then I began to cry. I stuffed one end of the towel in my mouth during the worst of it, afraid that if the boaters on the lake heard the sounds coming out of me, they\u0027d think someone up here was being murdered. I cried in grief for the empty years I had spent without Jo, without friends, and without my work. I cried in gratitude because those work-less years seemed to be over. It was too early to tell for sure ¡ª one swallow doesn\u0027t make a summer and eight pages of hard copy don\u0027t make a career resuscitation ¡ª but I thought it really might be so. And I cried out of fear, as well, as we do when some awful experience is finally over or when some terrible accident has been narrowly averted. I cried because I suddenly realized that I had been walking a white line ever since Jo died, walking straight down the middle of the road. By some miracle, I had been carried out of harm\u0027s way. I had no idea who had done the carrying, but that was all right ¡ª it was a question that could wait for another day. I cried it all out of me. Then I went on down to the lake and waded in. The cool water felt more than good on my overheated body; it felt like a resurrection.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-15.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
