{"id":78359,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I caught the measles when I was eight, and I was very ill. \u0027I thought you were going to die,\u0027 my father told me once, and he was not a man given to exaggeration. He told me about how he and my mother had dunked me in a tub of cold water one night, both of them at least half-convinced the shock of it would stop my heart, but both of them completely convinced that I\u0027d burn up before their eyes if they didn\u0027t do something. I had begun to speak in a loud, monotonously discursive voice about the bright figures I saw in the room ¡ª angels come to bear me away, my terrified mother was sure ¡ª and the last time my father took my temperature before the cold plunge, he said that the mercury on the old Johnson \u0026 Johnson rectal thermometer had stood at a hundred and six degrees. After that, he said, he didn\u0027t dare take it anymore. I don\u0027t remember any bright figures, but I remember a strange period of time that was like being in a funhouse corridor where several different movies were showing at once. The world grew elastic, bulging in places where it had never bulged before, wavering in places where it had always been solid. People ¡ª most of them seeming impossibly talldarted in and out of my room on scissoring, cartoonish legs. Their words all came out booming, with instant echoes. Someone shook a pair of baby-shoes in my face. I seem to remember my brother, Siddy, sticking his hand into his shirt and making repeated arm-fart noises. Continuity broke down. Everything came in segments, weird wieners on a poison string. In the years between then and the summer I returned to Sara Laughs, I had the usual sicknesses, infections, and insults to the body, but never anything like that feverish interlude when I was eight. I never expected to ¡ª believing, I suppose, that such experiences are unique to children, people with malaria, or maybe those suffering catastrophic mental breakdowns. But on the night of July seventh and the morning of July eighth, I lived through a period of time remarkably like that childhood delirium. Dreaming, waking, moving ¡ª they were all one. I\u0027ll tell you as best I can, but nothing I say can convey the strangeness of that experience. It was as if I had found a secret passage hidden just beyond the wall of the world and went crawling along it. First there was music. Not Dixieland, because there were no horns, but like Dixieland. A primitive, reeling kind of bebop. Three or four acoustic guitars, a harmonica, a stand-up bass (or maybe a pair). Behind all of this was a hard, happy drumming that didn\u0027t sound as if it was coming from a real drum; it sounded as if someone with a lot of percussive talent was whopping on a bunch of boxes. Then a woman\u0027s voice joined in ¡ª a contralto voice, not quite mannish, roughing over the high notes. It was laughing and urgent and ominous all at the same time, and I knew at once that I was hearing Sara Tidwell, who had never cut a record in her life. I was hearing Sara Laughs, and man, she was rocking. \u0027You know we\u0027re going back to MANderley, We\u0027re gonna dance on the SANderley, I\u0027m gonna sing with the BANderley, We gonna ball all we CANderley ¡ª Ball me, baby, yeah!\u0027 The basses ¡ª yes, there were two ¡ª broke out in a barnyard shuffle like the break in Elvis\u0027s version of \u0027Baby Let\u0027s Play House,\u0027 and then there was a guitar solo: Son Tidwell playing that chickenscratch thing. Lights gleamed in the dark, and I thought of a song from the fifties ¡ª Claudine Clark singing \u0027Party Lights.\u0027 And here they were, Japanese lanterns hung from the trees above the path of railroad-tie steps leading from the house to the water. Party lights casting mystic circles of radiance in the dark: red blue and green. Behind me, Sara was singing the bridge to her Manderley song ¡ª mama likes it nasty, mama likes it strong, mama likes to party all night long ¡ª but it was fading. Sara and the Red-Top Boys had set up their bandstand in the driveway by the sound, about where George Footman had parked when he came to serve me with Max Devore\u0027s subpoena. I was descending toward the lake through circles of radiance, past party lights surrounded by soft-winged moths. One had found its way inside a lamp and it cast a monstrous, batlike shadow against the ribbed paper. The flower-boxes Jo had put beside the steps were full of night-blooming roses. In the light of the Japanese lanterns they looked blue. Now the band was only a faint murmur; I could hear Sara shouting out the lyric, laughing her way through it as though it were the funniest thing she\u0027d ever heard, all that Manderley-sanderley-canderley stuff, but I could no longer make out the individual words. Much clearer was the lap of the lake against the rocks at the foot of the steps, the hollow clunk of the cannisters under the swimming float, and the cry of a loon drifting out of the darkness. Someone was standing on The Street to my right, at the edge of the lake. I couldn\u0027t see his face, but I could see the brown sportcoat and the tee-shirt he was wearing beneath it. The lapels cut off some of the letters of the message, so it looked like this: ORMA ER OUN I knew what it said anyway ¡ª in dreams you almost always know, don\u0027t you? NORMAL SPERM COUNT, a Village Cafe yuck-it-up special if ever there was one. I was in the north bedroom dreaming all this, and here I woke up enough to know I was dreaming . . . except it was like waking into another dream, because Bunter\u0027s bell was ringing madly and there was someone standing in the hall. Mr. Normal Sperm Count? No, not him. The shadow-shape falling on the door wasn\u0027t quite human. It was slumped, the arms indistinct. I sat up into the silver shaking of the bell, clutching a loose puddle of sheet against my naked waist, sure it was the shroud-thing out there ¡ª the shroud-thing had come out of its grave to get me. \u0027Please don\u0027t,\u0027 I said in a dry and trembling voice. \u0027Please don\u0027t, please.\u0027 The shadow on the door raised its arms. \u0027It ain\u0027t nuthin but a barn-dance sugar!\u0027 Sara Tidwell\u0027s laughing, furious voice sang. \u0027It ain\u0027t nuthin but a round-and-round!\u0027 I lay back down and pulled the sheet over my face in a childish act of denial . . . and there I stood on our little lick of beach, wearing just my undershorts. My feet were ankle-deep in the water. It was warm the way the lake gets by midsummer. My dim shadow was cast two ways, in one direction by the scantling moon which rode low above the water, in another by the Japanese lantern with the moth caught inside it. The man who\u0027d been standing on the path was gone but he had left a plastic owl to mark his place. It stared at me with frozen, gold-ringed eyes. \u0027Hey Irish!\u0027 I looked out at the swimming float. Jo stood there. She must have just climbed out of the water, because she was still dripping and her hair was plastered against her cheeks. She was wearing the two-piece swimsuit from the photo I\u0027d found, gray with red piping. \u0027It\u0027s been a long time, Irish ¡ª what do you say?\u0027 \u0027Say about what?\u0027 I called back, although I knew. \u0027About this!\u0027 She put her hands over her breasts and squeezed. Water ran out between her fingers and trickled across her knuckles. \u0027Come on, Irish,\u0027 she said from beside and above me, \u0027come on, you bastard, let\u0027s go.\u0027 I felt her strip down the sheet, pulling it easily out of my sleep-numbed fingers. I shut my eyes, but she took my hand and placed it between her legs. As I found that velvety seam and began to stroke it open, she began to rub the back of my neck with her fingers. \u0027You\u0027re not Jo,\u0027 I said. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 But no one was there to answer. I was in the woods. It was dark, and on the lake the loons were crying. I was walking the path to Jo\u0027s studio. It wasn\u0027t a dream; I could feel the cool air against my skin and the occasional bite of a rock into my bare sole or heel. A mosquito buzzed around my ear and I waved it away. I was wearing Jockey shorts, and at every step they pulled against a huge and throbbing erection. \u0027What the hell is this?\u0027 I asked as Jo\u0027s little barnboard studio loomed in the dark. I looked behind me and saw Sara on her hill, not the woman but the house, a long lodge jutting toward the nightbound lake. \u0027What\u0027s happening to me?\u0027 \u0027Everything\u0027s all right, Mike,\u0027 Jo said. She was standing on the float, watching as I swam toward her. She put her hands behind her neck like a calendar model, lifting her breasts more fully into the damp halter. As in the photo, I could see her nipples poking out the cloth. I was swimming in my underpants, and with the same huge erection. \u0027Everything\u0027s all right, Mike,\u0027 Mattie said in the north bedroom, and I opened my eyes. She was sitting beside me on the bed, smooth and naked in the weak glow of the nightlight. Her hair was down, hanging to her shoulders. Her breasts were tiny, the size of teacups, but the nipples were large and distended. Between her legs, where my hand still lingered, was a powderpuff of blonde hair, smooth as down. Her body was wrapped in shadows like moth-wings, like rose-petals. There was something desperately attractive about her as she sat there ¡ª she was like the prize you know you\u0027ll never win at the carny shooting gallery or the county fair ringtoss. The one they keep on the top shelf. She reached under the sheet and folded her fingers over the stretched material of my undershorts. Everything\u0027s all right, it ain\u0027t nuthin but a round-and-round, said the UFO voice as I climbed the steps to my wife\u0027s studio. I stooped, fished for the key from beneath the mat, and took it out. I climbed the ladder to the float, wet and dripping, preceded by my engorged sex ¡ª is there anything, I wonder, so unintentionally comic as a sexually aroused man? Jo stood on the boards in her wet bathing suit. I pulled Mattie into bed with me. I opened the door to Jo\u0027s studio. All of these things happened at the same time, weaving in and out of each other like strands of some exotic rope or belt. The thing with Jo felt the most like a dream, the thing in the studio, me crossing the floor and looking down at my old green IBM, the least. Mattie in the north bedroom was somewhere in between. On the float Jo said, \u0027Do what you want.\u0027 In the north bedroom Mattie said, \u0027Do what you want.\u0027 In the studio, no one had to tell me anything. In there I knew exactly what I wanted. On the float I bent my head and put my mouth on one of Jo\u0027s breasts and sucked the cloth-covered nipple into my mouth. I tasted damp fabric and dank lake. She reached for me where I stuck out and I slapped her hand away. If she touched me I would come at once. I sucked, drinking back trickles of cotton-water, groping with my own hands, first caressing her ass and then yanking down the bottom half of her suit. I got it off her and she dropped to her knees. I did too, finally getting rid of my wet, clinging underpants and tossing them on top of her bikini panty. We faced each other that way, me naked, her almost. \u0027Who was the guy at the game?\u0027 I panted. \u0027Who was he, Jo?\u0027 \u0027No one in particular, Irish. Just another bag of bones.\u0027 She laughed, then leaned back on her haunches and stared at me. Her navel was a tiny black cup. There was something queerly, attractively snakelike in her posture. \u0027Everything down there is death,\u0027 she said, and pressed her cold palms and white, pruney fingers to my cheeks. She turned my head and then bent it so I was looking into the lake. Under the water I saw decomposing bodies slipping by, pulled by some deep current. Their wet eyes stared. Their fish-nibbled noses gaped. Their tongues lolled between white lips like tendrils of waterweed. Some of the dead trailed pallid balloons of jellyfish guts; some were little more than bone. Yet not even the sight of this floating charnel parade could divert me from what I wanted. I shrugged my head free of her hands, pushed her down on the boards, and finally cooled what was so hard and contentious, sinking it deep. Her moon-silvered eyes stared up at me, through me, and I saw that one pupil was larger than the other. That was how her eyes had looked on the TV monitor when I had identified her in the Derry County Morgue. She was dead. My wife was dead and I was fucking her corpse. Nor could even that realization stop me. \u0027Who was he?\u0027 I cried at her, covering her cold flesh as it lay on the wet boards. \u0027Who was he, Jo, for Christ\u0027s sake tell me who he was!\u0027 In the north bedroom I pulled Mattie on top of me, relishing the feel of those small breasts against my chest and the length of her entwining legs. Then I rolled her over on the far side of the bed. I felt her hand reaching for me, and slapped it away ¡ª if she touched me where she meant to touch me, I would come in an instant. \u0027Spread your legs, hurry,\u0027 I said, and she did. I closed my eyes, shutting out all other sensory input in favor of this. I pressed forward, then stopped. I made one little adjustment, pushing at my engorged penis with the side of my hand, then rolled my hips and slipped into her like a finger in a silk-lined glove. She looked up at me, wide-eyed, then put a hand on my cheek and turned my head. \u0027Everything out there is death,\u0027 she said, as if only explaining the obvious. In the window I saw Fifth Avenue between Fiftieth and Sixtieth ¡ª all those trendy shops, Bijan and Bally, Tiffany and Bergdorf\u0027s and Steuben Glass. And here came Harold Oblowski, northbound and swinging his pigskin briefcase (the one Jo and I had given him for Christmas the year before she died). Beside him, carrying a Barnes and Noble bag by the handles, was the bountiful, beauteous Nola, his secretary. Except her bounty was gone. This was a grinning, yellow-jawed skeleton in a Donna Karan suit and alligator pumps; scrawny, beringed bones instead of fingers gripped the bag-handles. Harold\u0027s teeth jutted in his usual agent\u0027s grin, now extended to the point of obscenity. His favorite suit, the doublebreasted charcoal-gray from Paul Stuart, flapped on him like a sail in a fresh breeze. All around them, on both sides of the street, walked the living dead ¡ª mommy mummies leading baby corpses by the hands or wheeling them in expensive prams, zombie doormen, reanimated skateboarders. Here a tall black man with a last few strips of flesh hanging from his face like cured deer-hide walked his skeletal Alsatian. The cab-drivers were rotting to raga music. The faces looking down from the passing buses were skulls, each wearing its own version of Harold\u0027s grin ¡ª Hey, how are ya, how\u0027s the wife, how\u0027s the kids, writing any good books lately? The peanut vendors were putrefying. Yet none of it could quench me. I was on fire. I slipped my hands under her buttocks, lifting her, biting at the sheet (the pattern, I saw with no surprise, was blue roses) until I pulled it free of the mattress to keep from biting her on the neck, the shoulder, the breasts, anywhere my teeth could reach. \u0027Tell me who he was!\u0027 I shouted at her. \u0027You know, I know you do!\u0027 My voice was so muffled by my mouthful of bed-linen that I doubted if anyone but me could have understood it. \u0027Tell me, you bitch!\u0027 On the path between Jo\u0027s studio and the house I stood in the dark with the typewriter in my arms and that dream-spanning erection quivering below its metal bulk ¡ª all that ready and nothing willing. Except maybe for the night breeze. Then I became aware I was no longer alone. The shroud-thing was behind me, called like the moths to the party lights. It laughed-a brazen, smoke-broken laugh that could belong to only one woman. I didn\u0027t see the hand that reached around my hip to grip me ¡ª the typewriter was in the way ¡ª but I didn\u0027t need to see it to know its color was brown. It squeezed, slowly tightening, the fingers wriggling. \u0027What do you want to know, sugar?\u0027 she asked from behind me. Still laughing. Still teasing. \u0027Do you really want to know at all? Do you want to know or do you want to feel?\u0027 \u0027Oh, you\u0027re killing me!\u0027 I cried. The typewriter ¡ª thirty or so pounds of IBM Selectric ¡ª was shaking back and forth in my arms. I could feel my muscles twanging like guitar strings. \u0027Do you want to know who he was, sugar? That nasty man?\u0027 \u0027Just do me, you bitch!\u0027 I screamed. She laughed again ¡ª that harsh laughter that was almost like a cough ¡ª and squeezed me where the squeezing was best. \u0027You hold still, now,\u0027 she said. \u0027You hold still, pretty boy, \u0027less you want me to take fright and yank this thing of yours right out by the . . . \u0027 I lost the rest as the whole world exploded in an orgasm so deep and strong that I thought it would simply tear me apart. I snapped my head back like a man being hung and ejaculated looking up at the stars. I screamed ¡ª I had to ¡ª and on the lake, two loons screamed back. At the same time I was on the float. Jo was gone, but I could faintly hear the sound of the band ¡ª -Sara and Sonny and the Red-Top Boys tearing through \u0027Black Mountain Rag.\u0027 I sat up, dazed and spent, fucked hollow. I couldn\u0027t see the path leading up to the house, but I could discern its switchback course by the Japanese lanterns. My underpants lay beside me in a little wet heap. I picked them up and started to put them on, only because I didn\u0027t want to swim back to shore with them in my hand. I stopped with them stretched between my knees, looking at my fingers. They were slimed with decaying flesh. Puffing out from beneath several of the nails were clumps of torn-out hair. Corpsehair. \u0027Oh Jesus,\u0027 I moaned. The strength went out of me. I flopped into wetness. I was in the north-wing bedroom. What I had landed in was hot, and at first I thought it was come. The dim glow of the nightlight showed darker stuff, however. Mattie was gone and the bed was full of blood. Lying in the middle of that soaking pool was something I at first glance took to be a clump of flesh or a piece of organ. I looked more closely and saw it was a stuffed animal, a black-furred object matted red with blood. I lay on my side looking at it, wanting to bolt out of the bed and flee from the room but unable to do it. My muscles were in a dead swoon. Who had I really been having sex with in this bed? And what had I done to her? In God\u0027s name, what? \u0027I don\u0027t believe these lies,\u0027 I heard myself say, and as though it were an incantation, I was slapped back together. That isn\u0027t exactly what happened, bur it\u0027s the only way of saying that seems to come close to whatever did. There were three of me ¡ª one on the float, one in the north bedroom, one on the path ¡ª and each one felt that hard slap, as if the wind had grown a fist. There was rushing blackness, and in it the steady silver shaking of Bunter\u0027s bell. Then it faded, and I faded with it. For a little while I was nowhere at all. I came back to the casual chatter of birds on summer vacation and to that peculiar red darkness that means the sun is shining through your closed eyelids. My neck was stiff, my head was canted at a weird angle, my legs were folded awkwardly beneath me, and I was hot. I lifted my head with a wince, knowing even as I opened my eyes that I was no longer in bed, no longer on the swimming float, no longer on the path between the house and the studio. It was floorboards under me, hard and uncompromising. The light was dazzling. I squinched my eyes closed again and groaned like a man with a hangover. I eased them back open behind my cupped hands, gave them time to adjust, then cautiously uncovered them, sat all the way up, and looked around. I was in the upstairs hall, lying under the broken air conditioner. Mrs. Meserve\u0027s note still hung from it. Sitting outside my office door was the green IBM with a piece of paper rolled into it. I looked down at my feet and saw that they were dirty. Pine needles were stuck to my soles, and one toe was scratched. I got up, staggered a little (my right leg had gone to sleep), then braced a hand against the wall and stood steady. I looked down at myself. I was wearing the Jockeys I\u0027d gone to bed in, and I didn\u0027t look as if I\u0027d had an accident in them. I pulled out the waistband and peeked inside. My cock looked as it usually did; small and soft, curled up and asleep in its thatch of hair. If Noonan\u0027s Folly had been adventuring in the night, there was no sign of it now. \u0027It sure felt like an adventure,\u0027 I croaked. I armed sweat off my forehead. It was stifling up here. \u0027Not the kind I ever read about in The Hardy Boys, though.\u0027 Then I remembered the blood-soaked sheet in the north bedroom, and the stuffed animal lying on its side in the middle of it. There was no sense of relief attached to the memory, that thank-God-it-was-only-a-dream feeling you get after a particularly nasty nightmare. It felt as real as any of the things I\u0027d experienced in my measles fever-delirium . . . and all those things had been real, just distorted by my overheated brain. I staggered to the stairs and limped down them, holding tight to the bannister in case my tingling leg should buckle. At the foot I looked dazedly around the living room, as if seeing it for the first time, and then limped down the north-wing corridor. The bedroom door was ajar and for a moment I couldn\u0027t bring myself to push it all the way open and go in. I was very badly scared, and my mind kept trying to replay an old episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, the one about the man who strangles his wife during an alcoholic blackout. He spends the whole half hour looking for her, and finally finds her in the pantry, bloated and open-eyed. Kyra Devore was the only kid of stuffed-animal age I\u0027d met recently, but she had been sleeping peacefully under her cabbage-rose coverlet when I left her mother and headed home. It was stupid to think I had driven all the way back to Wasp Hill Road, probably wearing nothing but my Jockeys, that I had ¡ª What? Raped the woman? Brought the child here? In my sleep? I got the typewriter, in my sleep, didn\u0027t I? It\u0027s sitting right upstairs in the goddam hallway. Big difference between going thirty yards through the woods and five miles down the road to ¡ª I wasn\u0027t going to stand out here listening to those quarrelling voices in my head. If I wasn\u0027t crazy ¡ª and I didn\u0027t think I was ¡ª listening to those contentious assholes would probably send me there, and by the express. I reached out and pushed the bedroom door open. For a moment I actually saw a spreading octopus-pattern of blood soaking into the sheet, that\u0027s how real and focused my terror was. Then I closed my eyes tight, opened them, and looked again. The sheets were rumpled, the bottom one mostly pulled free. I could see the quilted satin hide of the mattress. One pillow lay on the far edge of the bed. The other was scrunched down at the foot. The throw rug ¡ª a piece of Jo\u0027s work ¡ª was askew, and my water-glass lay overturned on the nighttable. The bedroom looked as if it might have been the site of a brawl or an orgy, but not a murder. There was no blood and no little stuffed animal with black fur. I dropped to my knees and looked under the bed. Nothing there ¡ª not even dust-kitties, thanks to Brenda Meserve. I looked at the ground-sheet again, first passing a hand over its rumpled topography, then pulling it back down and resecuring the elasticized corners. Great invention, those sheets; if women gave out the Medal of Freedom instead of a bunch of white politicians who never made a bed or washed a load of clothes in their lives, the guy who thought up fitted sheets would undoubtedly have gotten a piece of that tin by now. In a Rose Garden ceremony. With the sheet pulled taut, I looked again. No blood, not a single drop. There was no stiffening patch of semen, either. The former I hadn\u0027t really expected (or so I was already telling myself), but what about the latter? At the very least, I\u0027d had the world\u0027s most creative wet-dream ¡ª a triptych in which I had screwed two women and gotten a handjob from a third, all at the same time. I thought I had that morning-after feeling, too, the one you get when the previous night\u0027s sex has been of the headbusting variety. But if there had been fireworks, where was the burnt gunpowder? \u0027In Jo\u0027s studio, most likely,\u0027 I told the empty, sunny room. \u0027Or on the path between here and there. Just be glad you didn\u0027t leave it in Mattie Devore, bucko. An affair with a post-adolescent widow you don\u0027t need.\u0027 A part of me disagreed; a part of me thought Mattie Devore was exactly what I did need. But I hadn\u0027t had sex with her last night, any more than I had had sex with my dead wife out on the swimming float or gotten a handjob from Sara Tidwell. Now that I saw I hadn\u0027t killed a nice little kid either, my thoughts turned back to the typewriter. Why had I gotten it? Why bother? Oh man. What a silly question. My wife might have been keeping secrets from me, maybe even having an affair; there might be ghosts in the house; there might be a rich old man half a mile south who wanted to put a sharp stick into me and then break it off; there might be a few toys in my own humble attic, for that matter. But as I stood there in a bright shaft of sunlight, looking at my shadow on the far wall, only one thought seemed to matter: I had gone out to my wife\u0027s studio and gotten my old typewriter, and there was only one reason to do something like that. I went into the bathroom, wanting to get rid of the sweat on my body and the dirt on my feet before doing anything else. I reached for the shower-handle, then stopped. The tub was full of water. Either I had for some reason filled it during my sleepwalk . . . or something else had. I reached for the drain-lever, then stopped again, remembering that moment on the shoulder of Route 68 when my mouth had filled up with the taste of cold water. I realized I was waiting for it to happen again. When it didn\u0027t, I opened the bathtub drain to let out the standing water and started the shower. I could have brought the Selectric downstairs, perhaps even lugged it out onto the deck where there was a little breeze coming over the surface of the lake, but I didn\u0027t. I had brought it all the way to the door of my office, and my office was where I\u0027d work . . . if I could work. I\u0027d work in there even if the temperature beneath the roofpeak built to a hundred and twenty degrees . . . which, by three in the afternoon, it just might. The paper rolled into the machine was an old pink-carbon receipt from Click!, the photo shop in Castle Rock where Jo had bought her supplies when we were down here. I\u0027d put it in so that the blank side faced the Courier type-ball. On it I had typed the names of my little harem, as if I had tried in some struggling way to report on my three-faceted dream even while it was going on: Jo Sara Mattie Jo Sara Mattie Mattie Mattie Sara Sara Jo Johanna Sara Jo MattieSaraJo. Below this, in lower case: normal sperm count sperm norm all\u0027s rosy I opened the office door, carried the typewriter in, and put it in its old place beneath the poster of Richard Nixon. I pulled the pink slip out of the roller, balled it up, and tossed it into the wastebasket. Then I picked up the Selectric\u0027s plug and stuck it in the baseboard socket. My heart was beating hard and fast, the way it had when I was thirteen and climbing the ladder to the high board at the Y-pool. I had climbed that ladder three times when I was twelve and then slunk back down it again; once I turned thirteen, there could be no chickening out ¡ª I really had to do it. I thought I\u0027d seen a fan hiding in the far corner of the closet, behind the box marked GADGETS. I started in that direction, then turned around again with a ragged little laugh. I\u0027d had moments of confidence before, hadn\u0027t I? Yes. And then the iron bands had clamped around my chest. It would be stupid to get out the fan and then discover I had no business in this room after all. \u0027Take it easy,\u0027 I said, \u0027take it easy.\u0027 But I couldn\u0027t, no more than that narrow-chested boy in the ridiculous purple bathing suit had been able to take it easy when he walked to the end of the diving board, the pool so green below him, the upraised faces of the boys and girls in it so small, so small. I bent to one of the drawers on the right side of the desk and pulled so hard it came all the way out. I got my bare foot out of its landing zone just in time and barked a gust of loud, humorless laughter. There was half a ream of paper in the drawer. The edges had that faintly crispy look paper gets when it\u0027s been sitting for a long time. I no more than saw it before remembering I had brought my own supply ¡ª stuff a good deal fresher than this. I left it where it was and put the drawer back in its hole. It took several tries to get it on its tracks; my hands were shaking. At last I sat down in my desk chair, hearing the same old creaks as it took my weight and the same old rumble of the casters as I rolled it forward, snugging my legs into the kneehole. Then I sat facing the keyboard, sweating hard, still remembering the high board at the Y, how springy it had been under my bare feet as I walked its length, remembering the echoing quality of the voices below me, remembering the smell of chlorine and the steady low throb of the air-exchangers: fwung-fwung-fwung-fwung, as if the water had its own secret heartbeat. I had stood at the end of the board wondering (and not for the first time!) if you could be paralyzed if you hit the water wrong. Probably not, but you could die of fear. There were documented cases of that in Ripley\u0027s Believe It or Not, which served me as science between the ages of eight and fourteen. Go on! Jo\u0027s voice cried. My version of her voice was usually calm and collected; this time it was shrill. Stop dithering and go on! I reached for the IBM\u0027s rocker-switch, now remembering the day I had dropped my Word Six program into the Powerbook\u0027s trash. Goodbye, old pal, I had thought. \u0027Please let this work,\u0027 I said. \u0027Please.\u0027 I lowered my hand and flicked the switch. The machine came on. The Courier ball did a preliminary twirl, like a ballet dancer standing in the wings, waiting to go on. I picked up a piece of paper, saw my sweaty fingers were leaving marks, and didn\u0027t care. I rolled it into the machine, centered it, then wrote Chapter One and waited for the storm to break.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-14.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
