{"id":78356,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Around nine o\u0027clock, a pickup came down the driveway and parked behind my Chevrolet. The truck was new ¡ª a Dodge Ram so clean and chrome-shiny it looked as if the ten-day plates had just come off that morning ¡ª but it was the same shade of off-white as the last one and the sign on the driver\u0027s door was the one I remembered: WILLIAM \u0027BILL\u0027 DEAN CAMP CHECKING CARETAKING LIGHT CARPENTRY, plus his telephone number. I went out on the back stoop to meet him, coffee cup in my hand.\\n\\n \u0027Mike!\u0027 Bill cried, climbing down from behind the wheel. Yankee men don\u0027t hug ¡ª that\u0027s a truism you can put right up there with tough guys don\u0027t dance and real men don\u0027t eat quiche ¡ª but Bill pumped my hand almost hard enough to slop coffee from a cup that was three-quarters empty, and gave me a hearty clap on the back. His grin revealed a splendidly blatant set of false teeth ¡ª the kind which used to be called Roebuckers, because you got them from the catalogue. It occurred to me in passing that my ancient interlocutor from the Lakeview General Store could have used a pair. It certainly would have improved mealtimes for the nosy old fuck. \u0027Mike, you\u0027re a sight for sore eyes!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good to see you, too,\u0027 I said, grinning. Nor was it a false grin; I felt all right. Things with the power to scare the living shit out of you on a thundery midnight in most cases seem only interesting in the bright light of a summer morning. \u0027You\u0027re looking well, my friend.\u0027\\n\\n It was true. Bill was four years older and a little grayer around the edges, but otherwise the same. Sixty-five? Seventy? It didn\u0027t matter. There was no waxy look of ill health about him, and none of the falling-away in the face, principally around the eyes and in the cheeks, that I associate with encroaching infirmity.\\n\\n \u0027So\u0027re you,\u0027 he said, letting go of my hand. \u0027We was all so sorry about Jo, Mike. Folks in town thought the world of her. It was a shock, with her so young. My wife asked if I\u0027d give you her condolences special. Jo made her an afghan the year she had the pneumonia, and Yvette ain\u0027t never forgot it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 I said, and my voice wasn\u0027t quite my own for a moment or two. It seemed that on the TR my wife was hardly dead at all. \u0027And thank Yvette, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yuh. Everythin okay with the house? Other\u0027n the air conditioner, I mean. Buggardly thing! Them at the Western Auto promised me that part last week, and now they\u0027re saying maybe not until August first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s okay. I\u0027ve got my Powerbook. If I want to use it, the kitchen table will do fine for a desk.\u0027 And I would want to use it ¡ª so many crosswords, so little time.\\n\\n \u0027Got your hot water okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All that\u0027s fine, but there is one problem.\u0027\\n\\n I stopped. How did you tell your caretaker you thought your house was haunted? Probably there was no good way; probably the best thing to do was to go at it head-on. I had questions, but I didn\u0027t want just to nibble around the edges of the subject and be coy. For one thing, Bill would sense it. He might have bought his false teeth out of a catalogue, but he wasn\u0027t stupid.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s on your mind, Mike? Shoot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re going to take this, but ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n He smiled in the way of a man who suddenly understands and held up his hand. \u0027Guess maybe I know already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do?\u0027 I felt an enormous sense of relief and I could hardly wait to find out what he had experienced in Sara, perhaps while checking for dead lightbulbs or making sure the roof was holding the snow all right. \u0027What did you hear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mostly what Royce Merrill and Dickie Brooks have been telling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Beyond that, I don\u0027t know much. Me and mother\u0027s been in Virginia, remember. Only got back last night around eight o\u0027clock. Still, it\u0027s the big topic down to the store.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment I remained so fixed on Sara Laughs that I had no idea what he was talking about. All I could think was that folks were gossiping about the strange noises in my house. Then the name Royce Merrill clicked and everything else clicked with it. Merrill was the elderly possum with the gold-headed cane and the salacious wink. Old Four-Teeth. My caretaker wasn\u0027t talking about ghostly noises; he was talking about Mattie Devore.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get you a cup of coffee,\u0027 I said. \u0027I need you to tell me what I\u0027m stepping in here.\u0027\\n\\n When we were seated on the deck, me with fresh coffee and Bill with a cup of tea (\u0027Coffee burns me at both ends these days,\u0027 he said), I asked him first to tell me the Royce Merrill-Dickie Brooks version of my encounter with Mattie and Kyra.\\n\\n It turned out to be better than I had expected. Both old men had seen me standing at the side of the road with the little girl in my arms, and they had observed my Chevy parked halfway into the ditch with the driver\u0027s-side door open, but apparently neither of them had seen Kyra using the white line of Route 68 as a tightrope. As if to compensate for this, however, Royce claimed that Mattie had given me a big my hero hug and a kiss on the mouth.\\n\\n \u0027Did he get the part about how I grabbed her by the ass and slipped her some tongue?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Bill grinned. \u0027Royce\u0027s imagination ain\u0027t stretched that far since he was fifty or so, and that was forty or more year ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never touched her.\u0027 Well . . . there had been that moment when the back of my hand went sliding along the curve of her breast, but that had been inadvertent, whatever the young lady herself might think about it.\\n\\n \u0027Shite, you don\u0027t need to tell me that,\u0027 he said. \u0027But . . . \u0027\\n\\n He said that but the way my mother always had, letting it trail off on its own, like the tail of some ill-omened kite.\\n\\n \u0027But what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d do well to keep your distance from her,\u0027 he said. \u0027She\u0027s nice enough ¡ª almost a town girl, don\u0027t you know ¡ª but she\u0027s trouble.\u0027 He paused. \u0027No, that ain\u0027t quite fair to her. She\u0027s in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The old man wants custody of the baby, doesn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n Bill set his teacup down on the deck rail and looked at me with his eyebrows raised. Reflections from the lake ran up his cheek in ripples, giving him an exotic look. \u0027How\u0027d you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Guesswork, but of the educated variety. Her father-in-law called me Saturday night during the fireworks. And while he never came right out and stated his purpose, I doubt if Max Devore came all the way back to TR-90 in western Maine to repo his daughter-in-law\u0027s Jeep and trailer. So what\u0027s the story, Bill?\u0027\\n\\n For several moments he only looked at me. It was almost the look of a man who knows you have contracted a serious disease and isn\u0027t sure how much he ought to tell you. Being looked at that way made me profoundly uneasy. It also made me feel that I might be putting Bill Dean on the spot. Devore had roots here, after all. And, as much as Bill might like me, I didn\u0027t. Jo and I were from away. It could have been worse ¡ª it could have been Massachusetts or New York ¡ª but Derry, although in Maine, was still away.\\n\\n \u0027Bill? I could use a little navigational help if you ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to stay out of his way,\u0027 he said. His easy smile was gone. \u0027The man\u0027s mad.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment I thought Bill only meant Devore was pissed off at me, and then I took another look at his face. No, I decided, he didn\u0027t mean pissed off; he had used the word \u0027mad\u0027 in the most literal way.\\n\\n \u0027Mad how?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Mad like Charles Manson? Like Hannibal Lecter? How?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Say like Howard Hughes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ever read any of the stories about him? The lengths he\u0027d go to to get the things he wanted? It didn\u0027t matter if it was a special kind of hot dog they only sold in L.A. or an airplane designer he wanted to steal from Lockheed or Mcdonnell-Douglas, he had to have what he wanted, and he wouldn\u0027t rest until it was under his hand. Devore is the same way. He always was ¡ª even as a boy he was willful, according to the stories you hear in town.\\n\\n \u0027My own dad had one he used to tell. He said little Max Devore broke into Scant Larribee\u0027s tack-shed one winter because he wanted the Flexible Flyer Scant give his boy Scooter for Christmas. Back around 1923, this would have been. Devore cut both his hands on broken glass, Dad said, but he got the sled. They found him near midnight, sliding down Sugar Maple Hill, holding his hands up to his chest when he went down. He\u0027d bled all over his mittens and his snowsuit. There\u0027s other stories you\u0027ll hear about Maxie Devore as a kid ¡ª if you ask you\u0027ll hear fifty different ones ¡ª and some may even be true. That one about the sled is true, though. I\u0027d bet the farm on it. Because my father didn\u0027t lie. It was against his religion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Baptist?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nosir, Yankee.\u0027\\n\\n \u00271923 was many moons ago, Bill. Sometimes people change.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh, but mostly they don\u0027t. I haven\u0027t seen Devore since he come back and moved into Warrington\u0027s, so I can\u0027t say for sure, but I\u0027ve heard things that make me think that if he has changed, it\u0027s for the worse. He didn\u0027t come all the way across the country \u0027cause he wanted a vacation. He wants the kid. To him she\u0027s just another version of Scooter Larribee\u0027s Flexible Flyer. And my strong advice to you is that you don\u0027t want to be the window-glass between him and her.\u0027\\n\\n I sipped my coffee and looked out at the lake. Bill gave me time to think, scraping one of his workboots across a splatter of birdshit on the boards while I did it. Crowshit, I reckoned; only crows crap in such long and exuberant splatters.\\n\\n One thing seemed absolutely sure: Mattie Devore was roughly nine miles up Shit Creek with no paddle. I\u0027m not the cynic I was at twenty ¡ª is anyone? ¡ª but I wasn\u0027t naive enough or idealistic enough to believe the law would protect Ms. Doublewide against Mr. Computer . . . not if Mr. Computer decided to play dirty. As a boy he\u0027d taken the sled he wanted and gone sliding by himself at midnight, bleeding hands not a concern. And as a man? An old man who had been getting every sled he wanted for the last forty years or so?\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the story with Mattie, Bill? Tell me.\u0027\\n\\n It didn\u0027t take him long. Country stories are, by and large, simple stories. Which isn\u0027t to say they\u0027re not often interesting.\\n\\n Mattie Devore had started life as Mattie Stanchfield, not quite from the TR but from just over the line in Motton. Her father had been a logger, her mother a home beautician (which made it, in a ghastly way, the perfect country marriage). There were three kids. When Dave Stanch-field missed a curve over in Lovell and drove a fully loaded pulptruck into Kewadin Pond, his widow \u0027kinda lost heart,\u0027 as they say. She died soon after. There had been no insurance, other than what Stanchfield had been obliged to carry on his Jimmy and his skidder.\\n\\n Talk about your Brothers Grimm, huh? Subtract the Fisher-Price toys behind the house, the two pole hairdryers in the basement beauty salon, the old rustbucket Toyota in the driveway, and you were right there: Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her three children.\\n\\n Mattie is the princess of the piece ¡ª poor but beautiful (that she was beautiful I could personally testify). Now enter the prince. In this case he\u0027s a gangly stuttering redhead named Lance Devore. The child of Max Devore\u0027s sunset years. When Lance met Mattie, he was twenty-one. She had just turned seventeen. The meeting took place at Warrington\u0027s, where Mattie had landed a summer job as a waitress.\\n\\n Lance Devore was staying across the lake on the Upper Bay, but on Tuesday nights there were pickup softball games at Warrington\u0027s, the townies against the summer folks, and he usually canoed across to play. Softball is a great thing for the Lance Devores of the world; when you\u0027re standing at the plate with a bat in your hands, it doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re gangly. And it sure doesn\u0027t matter if you stutter.\\n\\n \u0027He confused em quite considerable over to Warrington\u0027s,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027They didn\u0027t know which team he belonged on ¡ª the Locals or the Aways. Lance didn\u0027t care; either side was fine with him. Some weeks he\u0027d play for one, some weeks t\u0027other. Either one was more than happy to have him, too, as he could hit a ton and field like an angel. They\u0027d put him at first base a lot because he was tall, but he was really wasted there. At second or shortstop . . . my! He\u0027d jump and twirl around like that guy Noriega.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You might mean Nureyev,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n He shrugged. \u0027Point is, he was somethin to see. And folks liked him. He fit in. It\u0027s mostly young folks that play, you know, and to them it\u0027s how you do, not who you are. Besides, a lot of em don\u0027t know Max Devore from a hole in the ground.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Unless they read The Wall Street Journal and the computer magazines,\u0027\u0027 I said. \u0027In those, you run across the name Devore about as often as you run across the name of God in the Bible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No foolin?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I guess that in the computer magazines God is more often spelled Gates, but you know what I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I s\u0027pose. But even so, it\u0027s been sixty-five years since Max Devore spent any real time on the TR. You know what happened when he left, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, why would I?\u0027\\n\\n He looked at me, surprised. Then a kind of veil seemed to fall over his eyes. He blinked and it cleared. \u0027Tell you another time ¡ª it ain\u0027t no secret ¡ª but I need to be over to the Harrimans\u0027 by eleven to check their sump-pump. Don\u0027t want to get sidetracked. Point I was tryin to make is just this: Lance Devore was accepted as a nice young fella who could hit a softball three hundred and fifty feet into the trees if he struck it just right. There was no one old enough to hold his old man against him ¡ª not at Warrington\u0027s on Tuesday nights, there wasn\u0027t ¡ª and no one held it against him that his family had dough, either. Hell, there are lots of wealthy people here in the summer. You know that. None worth as much as Max Devore, but being rich is only a matter of degree.\u0027\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t true, and I had just enough money to know it. Wealth is like the Richter scale-once you pass a certain point, the jumps from one level to the next aren\u0027t double or triple but some amazing and ruinous multiple you don\u0027t even want to think about. Fitzgerald had it straight, although I guess he didn\u0027t believe his own insight: the very rich are different from you and me. I thought of telling Bill that, and decided to keep my mouth shut. He had a sump-pump to fix.\\n\\n Kyra\u0027s parents met over a keg of beer stuck in a mudhole. Mattie was running the usual Tuesday-night keg out to the softball field from the main building on a handcart. She\u0027d gotten it most of the way from the restaurant wing with no trouble, but there had been heavy rain earlier in the week, and the cart finally bogged down in a soft spot. Lance\u0027s team was up, and Lance was sitting at the end of the bench, waiting his turn to hit. He saw the girl in the white shorts and blue Warrington\u0027s polo shirt struggling with the bogged handcart, and got up to help her. Three weeks later they were inseparable and Mattie was pregnant; ten weeks later they were married; thirty-seven months later, Lance Devore was in a coffin, done with softball and cold beer on a summer evening, done with what he called \u0027woodsing,\u0027 done with fatherhood, done with love for the beautiful princess. Just another early finish, hold the happily-ever-after.\\n\\n Bill Dean didn\u0027t describe their meeting in any detail; he only said, \u0027They met at the field ¡ª she was runnin out the beer and he helped her out of a boghole when she got her handcart stuck.\u0027\\n\\n Mattie never said much about that part of it, so I don\u0027t know much. Except I do . . . and although some of the details might be wrong, I\u0027d bet you a dollar to a hundred 1 got most of them right. That was my summer for knowing things I had no business knowing.\\n\\n It\u0027s hot, for one thing ¡ª \u002794 is the hottest summer of the decade and July is the hottest month of the summer. President Clinton is being upstaged by Newt and the Republicans. Folks are saying old Slick Willie may not even run for a second term. Boris Yeltsin is reputed to be either dying of heart disease or in a dry-out clinic. The Red Sox are looking better than they have any right to. In Derry, Johanna Arlen Noonan is maybe starting to feel a little whoopsy in the morning. If so, she does not speak of it to her husband.\\n\\n I see Mattie in her blue polo shirt with her name sewn in white script above her left breast. Her white shorts make a pleasing contrast to her tanned legs. I also see her wearing a blue gimme cap with the red W for Warrington\u0027s above the long bill. Her pretty dark-blonde hair is pulled through the hole at the back of the cap and falls to the collar of her shirt. I see her trying to yank the handcart out of the mud without upsetting the keg of beer. Her head is down; the shadow thrown by the bill of the cap obscures all of her face but her mouth and small set chin.\\n\\n \u0027Luh-let m-me h-h-help,\u0027 Lance says, and she looks up. The shadow cast by the cap\u0027s bill falls away, he sees her big blue eyes ¡ª the ones she\u0027ll pass on to their daughter. One look into those eyes and the war is over without a single shot fired; he belongs to her as surely as any young man ever belonged to any young woman.\\n\\n The rest, as they say around here, was just courtin.\\n\\n The old man had three children, but Lance was the only one he seemed to care about. (\u0027Daughter\u0027s crazier\u0027n a shithouse mouse,\u0027 Bill said matter-of-factly. \u0027In some laughin academy in California. Think I heard she caught her a cancer, too.\u0027) The fact that Lance had no interest in computers and software actually seemed to please his father. He had another son who was capable of running the business. In another way, however, Lance Devore\u0027s older half-brother wasn\u0027t capable at all: there would be no grandchildren from that one.\\n\\n \u0027Rump-wrangler,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027Understand there\u0027s a lot of that going around out there in California.\u0027\\n\\n There was a fair amount of it going around on the TR, too, I imagined, but thought it not my place to offer sexual instruction to my caretaker.\\n\\n Lance Devore had been attending Reed College in Oregon, majoring in forestry ¡ª the kind of guy who falls in love with green flannel pants, red suspenders, and the sight of condors at dawn. A Brothers Grimm woodcutter, in fact, once you got past the academic jargon. In the summer between his junior and senior years, his father had summoned him to the family compound in Palm Springs, and had presented him with a boxy lawyer\u0027s suitcase crammed with maps, aerial photos, and legal papers. These had little order that Lance could see, but I doubt that he cared. Imagine a comic-book collector given a crate crammed with rare old copies of Donald Duck. Imagine a movie collector given the rough cut of a never-released film starring Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe. Then imagine this avid young forester realizing that his father owned not just acres or square miles in the vast unincorporated forests of western Maine, but entire realms.\\n\\n Although Max Devore had left the TR in 1933, he\u0027d kept a lively interest in the area where he\u0027d grown up, subscribing to area newspapers and getting magazines such as Down East and the Maine Times. In the early eighties, he had begun to buy long columns of land just east of the Maine-New Hampshire border. God knew there had been plenty for sale; the paper companies which owned most of it had fallen into a recessionary pit, and many had become convinced that their New England holdings and operations would be the best place to begin retrenching. So this land, stolen from the Indians and clear-cut ruthlessly in the twenties and fifties, came into Max Devore\u0027s hands. He might have bought it just because it was there, a good bargain he could afford to take advantage of. He might have bought it as a way of demonstrating to himself that he had really survived his childhood; had, in point of fact, triumphed over it.\\n\\n Or he might have bought it as a toy for his beloved younger son. In the years when Devore was making his major land purchases in western Maine, Lance would have been just a kid . . . but old enough for a perceptive father to see where his interests were tending.\\n\\n Devore asked Lance to spend the summer of 1994 surveying purchases which were, for the most part, already ten years old. He wanted the boy to put the paperwork in order, but he wanted more than that ¡ª he wanted Lance to make sense of it. It wasn\u0027t a land-use recommendation he was looking for, exactly, although I guess he would have listened if Lance had wanted to make one; he simply wanted a sense of what he had purchased. Would Lance take a summer in western Maine trying to find out what his sense of it was? At a salary of two or three thousand dollars a month?\\n\\n I imagine Lance\u0027s reply was a more polite version of Buddy Jellison\u0027s \u0027Does a crow shit in the pine tops?\u0027\\n\\n The kid arrived in June of 1994 and set up shop in a tent on the far side of Dark Score Lake. He was due back at Reed in late August. Instead, though, he decided to take a year\u0027s leave of absence. His father wasn\u0027t pleased. His father smelled what he called \u0027girl trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but it\u0027s a damned long sniff from California to Maine,\u0027 Bill Dean said, leaning against the driver\u0027s door of his truck with his sunburned arms folded. \u0027He had someone a lot closer than Palm Springs doin his sniffin for him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Bout talk. People do it for free, and most are willing to do even more if they\u0027re paid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027People like Royce Merrill?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Royce might be one,\u0027 he agreed, \u0027but he wouldn\u0027t be the only one. Times around here don\u0027t go between bad and good; if you\u0027re a local, they mostly go between bad and worse. So when a guy like Max Devore sends a guy out with a supply of fifty- and hundred-dollar bills . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was it someone local? A lawyer?\u0027\\n\\n Not a lawyer; a real-estate broker named Richard Osgood (\u0027a greasy kind of fella\u0027 was Bill Dean\u0027s judgment of him) who denned and did business in Motton. Eventually Osgood had hired a lawyer from Castle Rock. The greasy fella\u0027s initial job, when the summer of \u002794 ended and Lance Devore remained on the TR, was to find out what the hell was going on and put a stop to it.\\n\\n \u0027And then?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Bill glanced at his watch, glanced at the sky, then centered his gaze on me. He gave a funny little shrug, as if to say, \u0027We\u0027re both men of the world, in a quiet and settled sort of way ¡ª you don\u0027t need to ask a silly question like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then Lance Devore and Mattie Stanchfield got married in the Grace Baptist Church right up there on Highway 68. There were tales made the rounds about what Osgood might\u0027ve done to keep it from comin off ¡ª I heard he even tried to bribe Reverend Gooch into refusin to hitch em, but I think that\u0027s stupid, they just would have gone someplace else. \u0027Sides, I don\u0027t see much sense in repeating what I don\u0027t know for sure.\u0027\\n\\n Bill unfolded an arm and began to tick items off on the leathery fingers of his right hand.\\n\\n \u0027They got married in the middle of September, 1994, I know that.\u0027 Out popped the thumb. \u0027People looked around with some curiosity to see if the groom\u0027s father would put in an appearance, but he never did.\u0027 Out popped the forefinger. Added to the thumb, it made a pistol. \u0027Mattie had a baby in April of \u002795, making the kiddie a dight premature . . . but not enough to matter. I seen it in the store with my own eyes when it wasn\u0027t a week old, and it was just the right size.\u0027 Out with the second finger. \u0027I don\u0027t know that Lance Devore\u0027s old man absolutely refused to help em financially, but I do know they were living in that trailer down below Dickie\u0027s Garage, and that makes me think they were havin a pretty hard skate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Devore put on the choke-chain,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s what a guy used to getting his own way would do . . . but if he loved the boy the way you seem to think, he might have come around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe, maybe not.\u0027 He glanced at his watch again. \u0027Let me finish up quick and get out of your sunshine . . . but you ought to hear one more little story, because it really shows how the land lies.\\n\\n \u0027In July of last year, less\u0027n a month before he died, Lance Devore shows up at the post-office counter in the Lakeview General. He\u0027s got a manila envelope he wants to send, but first he needs to show Carla DeCinces what\u0027s inside. She said he was all fluffed out, like daddies sometimes get over their kids when they\u0027re small.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, amused at the idea of skinny, stuttery Lance Devore all fluffed out. But I could see it in my mind\u0027s eye, and the image was also sort of sweet.\\n\\n \u0027It was a studio pitcher they\u0027d gotten taken over in the Rock. Showed the kid . . . what\u0027s her name? Kayla?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kyra.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh, they call em anything these days, don\u0027t they? It showed Kyra sittin in a big leather chair, with a pair of joke spectacles on her little snub of a nose, lookin at one of the aerial photos of the woods over across the lake in TR-100 or TR-110 ¡ª part of what the old man had picked up, anyway. Carla said the baby had a surprised look on her face, as if she hadn\u0027t suspected there could be so much woods in the whole world. Said it was awful cunnin, she did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cunnin as a cat a-runnin,\u0027 I murmured.\\n\\n \u0027And the envelope ¡ª Registered, Express Mail was addressed to Maxwell Devore, in Palm Springs, California.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Leading you to deduce that the old man either thawed enough to ask for a picture of his only grandchild, or that Lance Devore thought a picture might thaw him.\u0027\\n\\n Bill nodded, looking as pleased as a parent whose child has managed a difficult sum. \u0027Don\u0027t know if it did,\u0027 he said. \u0027Wasn\u0027t enough time to tell, one way or the other. Lance had bought one of those little satellite dishes, like what you\u0027ve got here. There was a bad storm the day he put it up ¡ª hail, high wind, blowdowns along the lakeshore, lots of lightnin. That was along toward evening. Lance put his dish up in the afternoon, all done and safe, except around the time the storm commenced he remembered he\u0027d left his socket wrench on the trailer roof. He went up to get it so it wouldn\u0027t get all wet n rusty ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was struck by lightning? Jesus, Bill!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lightnin struck, all right, but it hit across the way. You go past the place where Wasp Hill Road runs into 68 and you\u0027ll see the stump of the tree that stroke knocked over. Lance was comin down the ladder with his socket wrench when it hit. If you\u0027ve never had a lightnin bolt tear right over your head, you don\u0027t know how scary it is ¡ª it\u0027s like havin a drunk driver veer across into your lane, headed right for you, and then swing back onto his own side just in time. Close lightnin makes your hair stand up ¡ª makes your damned prick stand up. It\u0027s apt to play the radio on your steel fillins, it makes your ears hum, and it makes the air taste roasted. Lance fell off the ladder. If he had time to think anything before he hit the ground, I bet he thought he was electrocuted. Poor boy. He loved the TR, but it wasn\u0027t lucky for him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Broke his neck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh. With all the thunder, Mattie never heard him fall or yell or anything. She looked out a minute or two later when it started to hail and he still wasn\u0027t in. And there he was, layin on the ground and lookin up into the friggin hail with his eyes open.\u0027\\n\\n Bill looked at his watch one final time, then swung open the door to his truck. \u0027The old man wouldn\u0027t come for their weddin, but he came for his son\u0027s funeral and he\u0027s been here ever since. He didn\u0027t want nawthin to do with the young woman ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he wants the kid,\u0027 I said. It was no more than what I already knew, but I felt a sinking in the pit of my stomach just the same. Don\u0027t talk about this, Mattie had asked me on the morning of the Fourth. It\u0027s not a good time for Ki and me. \u0027How far along in the process has he gotten?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027On the third turn and headin into the home stretch, I sh\u0027d say. There\u0027ll be a hearin in Castle County Superior Court, maybe later this month, maybe next. The judge could rule then to hand the girl over, or put it off until fall. I don\u0027t think it matters which, because the one thing that\u0027s never going to happen on God\u0027s green earth is a rulin in favor of the mother. One way or another, that little girl is going to grow up in California.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n Put that way, it gave me a very nasty little chill.\\n\\n Bill slid behind the wheel of his truck. \u0027Stay out of it, Mike,\u0027 he said. \u0027Stay away from Mattie Devore and her daughter. And if you get called to court on account of seem the two of em on Saturday, smile a lot and say as little as you can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Max Devore\u0027s charging that she\u0027s unfit to raise the child.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bill, I saw the child, and she\u0027s fine.\u0027\\n\\n He grinned again, but this time there was no amusement in it. \u0027\u0027Magine she is. But that\u0027s not the point. Stay clear of their business, old boy. It\u0027s my job to tell you that; with Jo gone, I guess I\u0027m the only caretaker you got.\u0027 He slammed the door of his Ram, started the engine, reached for the gearshift, then dropped his hand again as something else occurred to him. \u0027If you get a chance, you ought to look for the owls.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What owls?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a couple of plastic owls around here someplace. They might be in y\u0027basement or out in Jo\u0027s studio. They come in by mail-order the fall before she passed on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The fall of 1993?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That can\u0027t be right.\u0027 We hadn\u0027t used Sara in the fall of 1993.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Tis, though. I was down here puttin on the storm doors when Jo showed up. We had us a natter, and then the UPS truck come. I lugged the box into the entry and had a coffee ¡ª I was still drinkin it then ¡ª while she took the owls out of the carton and showed em off to me. Gorry, but they looked real! She left not ten minutes after. It was like she\u0027d come down to do that errand special, although why anyone\u0027d drive all the way from Derry to take delivery of a couple of plastic owls I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When in the fall was it, Bill? Do you remember?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Second week of November,\u0027 he said promptly. \u0027Me n the wife went up to Lewiston later that afternoon, to \u0027Vette\u0027s sister\u0027s. It was her birthday. On our way back we stopped at the Castle Rock Agway so \u0027Vette could get her Thanksgiving turkey.\u0027 He looked at me curiously. \u0027You really didn\u0027t know about them owls?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a touch peculiar, wouldn\u0027t you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe she told me and I forgot,\u0027 I said. \u0027I guess it doesn\u0027t matter much now in any case.\u0027 Yet it seemed to matter. It was a small thing, but it seemed to matter. \u0027Why would Jo want a couple of plastic owls to begin with?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To keep the crows from shittin up the woodwork, like they\u0027re doing out on your deck. Crows see those plastic owls, they veer off.\u0027\\n\\n I burst out laughing in spite of my puzzlement . . . or perhaps because of it. \u0027Yeah? That really works?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh, long\u0027s you move em every now and then so the crows don\u0027t get suspicious. Crows are just about the smartest birds going, you know. You look for those owls, save yourself a lot of mess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will,\u0027 I said. Plastic owls to scare the crows away ¡ª it was exactly the sort of knowledge Jo would come by (she was like a crow herself in that way, picking up glittery pieces of information that happened to catch her interest) and act upon without bothering to tell me. All at once I was lonely for her again ¡ª missing her like hell.\\n\\n \u0027Good. Some day when I\u0027ve got more time, we\u0027ll walk the place all the way around. Woods too, if you want. I think you\u0027ll be satisfied.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure I will. Where\u0027s Devore staying?\u0027\\n\\n The bushy eyebrows went up. \u0027Warrington\u0027s. Him and you\u0027s practically neighbors. I thought you must know.\u0027\\n\\n I remembered the woman I\u0027d seen ¡ª black bathing-suit and black shorts somehow combining to give her an exotic cocktail-party look ¡ª and nodded. \u0027I met his wife.\u0027\\n\\n Bill laughed heartily enough at that to feel in need of his handkerchief. He fished it off the dashboard (a blue paisley thing the size of a football pennant) and wiped his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s so funny?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Skinny woman? White hair? Face sort of like a kid\u0027s Halloween mask?\u0027\\n\\n It was my turn to laugh. \u0027That\u0027s her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She ain\u0027t his wife, she\u0027s his whatdoyoucallit, personal assistant. Rogette Whitmore is her name.\u0027 He pronounced it ro-GET, with a hard G. \u0027Devore\u0027s wives\u0027re all dead. The last one twenty years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What kind of name is Rogette? French?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027California,\u0027 he said, and shrugged as if that one word explained everything. \u0027There\u0027s people in town scared of her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh.\u0027 Bill hesitated, then added with one of those smiles we put on when we want others to know that we know we\u0027re saying something silly: \u0027Brenda Meserve says she\u0027s a witch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And the two of them have been staying at Warrington\u0027s almost a year?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh. The Whitmore woman comes n goes, but mostly she\u0027s been here. Thinkin in town is that they\u0027ll stay until the custody case is finished off, then all go back to California on Devore\u0027s private jet. Leave Osgood to sell Warrington\u0027s, and ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sell it? What do you mean, sell it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you must know,\u0027 Bill said, dropping his gearshift into drive. \u0027When old Hugh Emerson told Devore they closed the lodge after Thanksgiving, Devore told him he had no intention of moving. Said he was comfortable right where he was and meant to stay put.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He bought the place.\u0027 I had been by turns surprised, amused, and angered over the last twenty minutes, but never exactly dumbfounded. Now I was. \u0027He bought Warrington\u0027s Lodge so he wouldn\u0027t have to move to Lookout Rock Hotel over in Castle View, or rent a house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ayuh, so he did. Nine buildins, includin the main lodge and The Sunset Bar; twelve acres of woods, a six-hole golf course, and five hundred feet of shorefront on The Street. Plus a two-lane bowlin alley and a softball field. Four and a quarter million. His friend Osgood did the deal and Devore paid with a personal check. I wonder how he found room for all those zeros. See you, Mike.\u0027\\n\\n With that he backed up the driveway, leaving me to stand on the stoop, looking after him with my mouth open.\\n\\n Plastic owls.\\n\\n Bill had told me roughly two dozen interesting things in between peeks at his watch, but the one which stayed on top of the pile was the fact (and I did accept it as a fact; he had been too positive for me not to) that Jo had come down here to take delivery on a couple of plastic goddam owls.\\n\\n Had she told me?\\n\\n She might have. I didn\u0027t remember her doing so, and it seemed to me that I would have, but Jo used to claim that when I got in the zone it was no good to tell me anything; stuff went in one ear and out the other. Sometimes she\u0027d pin little notes ¡ª errands to run, calls to make ¡ª to my shirt, as if I were a first-grader. But wouldn\u0027t I recall if she\u0027d said \u0027I\u0027m going down to Sara, hon, UPS is delivering something I want to receive personally, interested in keeping a lady company?\u0027 Hell wouldn\u0027t I have gone? I always liked an excuse to go to the TR. Except I\u0027d been working on that screenplay . . . and maybe pushing it a little . . . notes pinned to the sleeve of my shirt . . . If you go out when you\u0027re finished, we need milk and orange juice . . .\\n\\n I inspected what little was left of Jo\u0027s vegetable garden with the July sun beating down on my neck and thought about owls, the plastic god-dam owls. Suppose Jo had told me she was coming down here to Sara Laughs? Suppose I had declined almost without hearing the offer because I was in the writing zone? Even if you granted those things, there was another question: why had she felt the need to come down here personally when she could have just called someone and asked them to meet the delivery truck? Kenny Auster would have been happy to do it, ditto Mrs. M. And Bill Dean, our caretaker, had actually been here. This led to other questions ¡ª one was why she hadn\u0027t just had UPS deliver the damned things to Derry ¡ª and finally I decided I couldn\u0027t live without actually seeing a bona fide plastic owl for myself. Maybe, I thought, going back to the house, I\u0027d put one on the roof of my Chew when it was parked in the driveway. Forestall future bombing runs.\\n\\n I paused in the entry, struck by a sudden idea, and called Ward Hankins, the guy in Waterville who handles my taxes and my few non-writing-related business affairs.\\n\\n \u0027Mike,\u0027 he said heartily. \u0027How\u0027s the lake?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The lake\u0027s cool and the weather\u0027s hot, just the way we like it,\u0027 I said. \u0027Ward, you keep all the records we send you for five years, don\u0027t you? Just in case IRS decides to give us some grief?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Five is accepted practice,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I hold your stuff for seven ¡ª in the eyes of the tax boys, you\u0027re a mighty fat pigeon.\u0027\\n\\n Better a fat pigeon than a plastic owl, I thought but didn\u0027t say. What I said was \u0027That includes desk calendars, right? Mine and. Jo\u0027s, up until she died?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You bet. Since neither of you kept diaries, it was the best way to cross-reference receipts and claimed expenses with ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could you find Jo\u0027s desk calendar for 1993 and see what she had going in the second week of November?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Td be happy to. What in particular are you looking for?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment I saw myself sitting at my kitchen table in Derry on my first night as a widower, holding up a box with the words Norco Home Pregnancy Test printed on the side. Exactly what was I looking for at this late date? Considering that I had loved the lady and she was almost four years in her grave, what was I looking for? Besides trouble, that was?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m looking for two plastic owls,\u0027 I said. Ward probably thought I was talking to him, but I\u0027m not sure I was. \u0027I know that sounds weird, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. Can you call me back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Within the hour.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good man,\u0027 I said, and hung up.\\n\\n Now for the actual owls themselves. Where was the most likely spot to store two such interesting artifacts?\\n\\n My eyes went to the cellar door. Elementary, my dear Watson.\\n\\n The cellar stairs were dark and mildly dank. As I stood on the landing groping for the lightswitch, the door banged shut behind me with such force that I cried out in surprise. There was no breeze, no draft, the day was perfectly still, but the door banged shut just the same. Or was sucked shut.\\n\\n I stood in the dark at the top of the stairs, feeling for the lightswitch, smelling that oozy smell that even good concrete foundations get after awhile if there is no proper airing-out. It was cold, much colder than it had been on the other side of the door. I wasn\u0027t alone and I knew it. I was afraid, I\u0027d be a liar to say I wasn\u0027t . . . but I was also fascinated. Something was with me. Something was in here with me.\\n\\n I dropped my hand away from the wall where the switch was and just stood with my arms at my sides. Some time passed. I don\u0027t know how much. My heart was beating furiously in my chest; I could feel it in my temples. It was cold. \u0027Hello?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Nothing in response. I could hear the faint, irregular drip of water as condensation fell from one of the pipes down below, I could hear my own breathing, and faintly ¡ª far away, in another world where the sun was out ¡ª I could hear the triumphant caw of a crow. Perhaps it had just dropped a load on the hood of my car. I really need an owl, I thought. In fact, I don\u0027t know how I ever got along without one.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 I asked again. \u0027Can you talk?\u0027\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n I wet my lips. I should have felt silly, perhaps, standing there in the dark and calling to the ghosts. But I didn\u0027t. Not a bit. The damp had been replaced by a coldness I could feel, and I had company. Oh, yes. \u0027Can you tap, then? If you can shut the door, you must be able to tap.\u0027\\n\\n I stood there and listened to the soft, isolated drips from the pipes. There was nothing else. I was reaching out for the lightswitch again when there was a soft thud from not far below me. The cellar of Sara Laughs is high, and the upper three feet of the concrete ¡ª the part which lies against the ground\u0027s frost-belt ¡ª had been insulated with big silver-backed panels of Insu-Gard. The sound that I heard was, I am quite sure, a fist striking against one of these.\\n\\n Just a fist hitting a square of insulation, but every gut and muscle of my body seemed to come unwound. My hair stood up. My eyesockets seemed to be expanding and my eyeballs contracting, as if my head were trying to turn into a skull. Every inch of my skin broke out in gooseflesh. Something was in here with me. Very likely something dead. I could no longer have turned on the light if I\u0027d wanted to. I no longer had the strength to raise my arm.\\n\\n I tried to talk, and at last, in a husky whisper I hardly recognized, I said: \u0027Are you really there?\u0027\\n\\n Thud.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 I could still do no better than that husky whisper, the voice of a man giving last instructions to his family as he lies on his deathbed. This time there was nothing from below.\\n\\n I tried to think, and what came to my struggling mind was Tony Curtis as Harry Houdini in some old movie. According to the film, Houdini had been the Diogenes of the Ouija board circuit, a guy who spent his spare time just looking for an honest medium. He\u0027d attended one s¨¦ance where the dead communicated by ¡ª\\n\\n \u0027Tap once for yes, twice for no,\u0027 I said. \u0027Can you do that?\u0027\\n\\n Thud.\\n\\n It was on the stairs below me . . . but not too far below. Five steps down, six or seven at most. Not quite close enough to touch if I should reach out and wave my hand in the black basement air . . . a thing I could imagine, but not actually imagine doing.\\n\\n \u0027Are you . . . \u0027 My voice trailed off. There was simply no strength in my diaphragm. Chilly air lay on my chest like a flatiron. I gathered all my will and tried again. \u0027Are you Jo?\u0027\\n\\n Thud. That soft fist on the insulation. A pause, and then: Thud-thud.\\n\\n Yes and no.\\n\\n Then, with no idea why I was asking such an inane question: \u0027Are the owls down here?\u0027\\n\\n Thud-thud.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know where they are?\u0027\\n\\n Thud.\\n\\n \u0027Should I look for them?\u0027\\n\\n Thud! Very hard.\\n\\n Why did she want them? I could ask, but the thing on the stairs had no way to an\\n\\n Hot fingers touched my eyes and I almost screamed before realizing it was sweat. I raised my hands in the dark and wiped the heels of them up my face to the hairline. They skidded as if on oil. Cold or not, I was all but bathing in my own sweat.\\n\\n \u0027Are you Lance Devore?\u0027\\n\\n Thud-thud, at once.\\n\\n \u0027Is it safe for me at Sara? Am I safe?\u0027\\n\\n Thud. A pause. And I knew it was a pause, that the thing on the stairs wasn\u0027t finished. Then: Thud-thud. Yes, I was safe. No, I wasn\u0027t safe.\\n\\n I had regained marginal control of my arm. I reached out, felt along the wall, and found the lightswitch. I settled my fingers on it. Now the sweat on my face felt as if it were turning to ice.\\n\\n \u0027Are you the person who cries in the night?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Thud-thud from below me, and between the two thuds, I flicked the switch. The cellar globes came on. So did a brilliant hanging bulb at least a hundred and twenty-five watts ¡ª over the landing. There was no time for anyone to hide, let alone get away, and no one there to try, either. Also, Mrs. Meserve ¡ª admirable in so many ways ¡ª had neglected to sweep the cellar stairs. When I went down to where I estimated the thudding sounds had been coming from, I left tracks in the light dust. But mine were the only ones.\\n\\n I blew out breath in front of me and could see it. So it had been cold, still was cold . . . but it was warming up fast. I blew out another breath and could see just a hint of fog. A third exhale and there was nothing.\\n\\n I ran my palm over one of the insulated squares. Smooth. I pushed a finger at it, and although I didn\u0027t push with any real force, my finger left a dimple in the silvery surface. Easy as pie. If someone had been thumping a fist down here, this stuff should be pitted, the thin silver skin perhaps even broken to reveal the pink fill underneath. But all the squares were smooth.\\n\\n \u0027Are you still there?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n No response, and yet I had a sense that my visitor was still there. Somewhere.\\n\\n \u0027I hope I didn\u0027t offend you by turning on the light,\u0027 I said, and now I did feel slightly odd, standing on my cellar stairs and talking out loud, sermonizing to the spiders. \u0027I wanted to see you if I could.\u0027 I had no idea if that was true or not.\\n\\n Suddenly ¡ª so suddenly I almost lost my balance and tumbled down the stairs ¡ª I whirled around, convinced the shroud-creature was behind me, that it had been the thing knocking, it, no polite M. R. James ghost but a horror from around the rim of the universe.\\n\\n There was nothing.\\n\\n I turned around again, took two or three deep, steadying breaths, and then went the rest of the way down the cellar stairs. Beneath them was a perfectly serviceable canoe, complete with paddle. In the corner was the gas stove we\u0027d replaced after buying the place; also the claw-foot tub Jo had wanted (over my objections) to turn into a planter. I found a trunk filled with vaguely recalled table-linen, a box of mildewy cassette tapes (groups like the Delfonics, Funkadelic, and. 38 Special), several cartons of old dishes. There was a life down here, but ultimately not a very interesting one. Unlike the life I\u0027d sensed in Jo\u0027s studio, this one hadn\u0027t been cut short but evolved out of, shed like old skin, and that was all right. Was, in fact, the natural order of things.\\n\\n There was a photo album on a shelf of knickknacks and I took it down, both curious and wary. No bombshells this time, however; nearly all the pix were landscape shots of Sara Laughs as it had been when we bought it. I found a picture of Jo in bellbottoms, though (her hair parted in the middle and white lipstick on her mouth), and one of Michael Noonan wearing a flowered shirt and muttonchop sideburns that made me cringe (the bachelor Mike in the photo was a Barry White kind of guy I didn\u0027t want to recognize and yet did).\\n\\n I found Jo\u0027s old broken treadmill, a rake I\u0027d want if I was still around here come fall, a snowblower I\u0027d want even more if I was around come winter, and several cans of paint. What I didn\u0027t find was any plastic owls. My insulation-thumping friend had been right.\\n\\n Upstairs the telephone started ringing.\\n\\n I hurried to answer it, going out through the cellar door and then reaching back in to flick off the lightswitch. This amused me and at the same time seemed like perfectly normal behavior . . . just as being careful not to step on sidewalk cracks had seemed like perfectly normal behavior to me when I was a kid. And even if it wasn\u0027t normal, what did it matter? I\u0027d only been back at Sara for three days, but already I\u0027d postulated Noonan\u0027s First Law of Eccentricity: when you\u0027re on your own, strange behavior really doesn\u0027t seem strange at all.\\n\\n I snagged the cordless. \u0027Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Mike. It\u0027s Ward.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was quick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The file-room\u0027s just a short walk down the hall,\u0027 he said. \u0027Easy as pie. There\u0027s only one thing on Jo\u0027s calendar for the second week of November in 1993. It says \u0027S-Ks of Maine, Freep, 11 A.M.\u0027 That\u0027s on Tuesday the sixteenth. Does it help?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027Thank you, Ward. It helps a lot.\u0027\\n\\n I broke the connection and put the phone back in its cradle. Yes, it helped. S-Ks of Maine was Soup Kitchens of Maine. Jo had been on their board of directors from 1992 until her death. Freep was Freeport. It must have been a board meeting. They had probably discussed plans for feeding the homeless on Thanksgiving . . . and then Jo had driven the seventy or so miles to the TR in order to take delivery of two plastic owls. It didn\u0027t answer all the questions, but aren\u0027t there always questions in the wake of a loved one\u0027s death? And no statute of limitations on when they come up.\\n\\n The UFO voice spoke up then. While you\u0027re right here by the phone, it said, why not call Bonnie Amudson? Say hi, see how she\u0027s doing?\\n\\n Jo had been on four different boards during the nineties, all of them doing charitable work. Her friend Bonnie had persuaded her onto the Soup Kitchens board when a seat fell vacant. They had gone to a lot of the meetings together. Not the one in November of 1993, presumably, and Bonnie could hardly be expected to remember that one particular meeting almost five years later . . . but if she\u0027d saved her old minutes-of-the-meeting sheets . . .\\n\\n Exactly what the fuck was I thinking of? Calling Bonnie, making nice, then asking her to check her December 1993 minutes? Was I going to ask her if the attendance report had my wife absent from the November meeting? Was I going to ask if maybe Jo had seemed different that last year of her life? And when Bonnie asked me why I wanted to know, what would I say?\\n\\n Give me that, Jo had snarled in my dream of her. In the dream she hadn\u0027t looked like Jo at all, she\u0027d looked like some other woman, maybe like the one in the Book of Proverbs, the strange woman whose lips were as honey but whose heart was full of gall and wormwood. A strange woman with fingers as cold as twigs after a frost. Give me that, it\u0027s my dust-catcher.\\n\\n I went to the cellar door and touched the knob. I turned it . . . then let it go. I didn\u0027t want to look down there into the dark, didn\u0027t want to risk the chance that something might start thumping again. It was better to leave that door shut. What I wanted was something cold to drink. I went into the kitchen, reached for the fridge door, then stopped. The magnets were back in a circle again, but this time four letters and one number had been pulled into the center and lined up there. They spelled a single lower-case word:\\n\\n There was something here. Even back in broad daylight I had no doubt of that. I\u0027d asked if it was safe for me to be here and had received a mixed message . . . but that didn\u0027t matter. If I left Sara now, there was nowhere to go. I had a key to the house in Derry, but matters had to be resolved here. I knew that, too.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 I said, and opened the fridge to get a soda. \u0027Whoever or whatever you are, hello.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-11.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
