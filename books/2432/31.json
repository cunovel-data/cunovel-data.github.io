{"id":78375,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"It snowed for Christmas ¡ª a polite six inches of powder that made the carollers working the streets of Sanford look like they belonged in It\u0027s a Wonderful Life. By the time I came back from checking Kyra for the third time, it was quarter past one on the morning of the twenty-sixth, and the snow had stopped. A late moon, plump but pale, was peeking through the unravelling fluff of clouds.\\n\\n I was Christmasing with Frank again, and we were the last two up. The kids, Ki included, were dead to the world, sleeping off the annual bacchanal of food and presents. Frank was on his third Scotch ¡ª it had been a three-Scotch story if there ever was one, I guess ¡ª but I\u0027d barely drunk the top off my first one. I think I might have gotten into the bottle quite heavily if not for Ki. On the days when I have her I usually don\u0027t drink so much as a glass of beer. And to have her three days in a row . . . but shit, kemo sabe, if you can\u0027t spend Christmas with your kid, what the hell is Christmas for?\\n\\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 Frank asked when I sat down again and took another little token sip from my glass.\\n\\n I grinned at that. Not is she all right but are you all right. Well, nobody ever said Frank was stupid.\\n\\n \u0027You should\u0027ve seen me when the Department of Human Services let me have her for a weekend in October. I must have checked on her a dozen times before I went to bed . . . and then I kept checking. Getting up and peeking in on her, listening to her breathe. I didn\u0027t sleep a wink Friday night, caught maybe three hours on Saturday. So this is a big improvement. But if you ever blab any of what I\u0027ve told you, Frank ¡ª -if they ever hear about me filling up that bathtub before the storm knocked the gennie out ¡ª I can kiss my chances of adopting her goodbye. I\u0027ll probably have to fill out a form in triplicate before they even let me attend her high-school graduation.\u0027\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t meant to tell Frank the bathtub part, but once I started talking, almost everything spilled out. I suppose it had to spill to someone if I was ever to get on with my life. I\u0027d assumed that John Storrow would be the one on the other side of the confessional when the time came, but John didn\u0027t want to talk about any of those events except as they bore on our ongoing legal business, which nowadays is all about Kyra Elizabeth Devore.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll keep my mouth shut, don\u0027t worry. How goes the adoption battle?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Slow. I\u0027ve come to loathe the State of Maine court system, and DHS as well. You take the people who work in those bureaucracies one by one and they\u0027re mostly fine, but when you put them together . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bad, huh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I sometimes feel like a character in Bleak House. That\u0027s the one where Dickens says that in court nobody wins but the lawyers. John tells me to be patient and count my blessings, that we\u0027re making amazing progress considering that I\u0027m that most untrustworthy of creatures, an unmarried white male of middle age, but Ki\u0027s been in two foster-home situations since Mattie died, and ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t she have kin in one of those neighboring towns?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mattie\u0027s aunt. She didn\u0027t want anything to do with Ki when Mattie was alive and has even less interest now. Especially since ¡ª \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 ¡ª since Ki\u0027s not going to be rich.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Whitmore woman was lying about Devore\u0027s will.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely. He left everything to a foundation that\u0027s supposed to foster global computer literacy. With due respect to the numbercrunchers of the world, I can\u0027t imagine a colder charity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How is John?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pretty well mended, but he\u0027s never going to get the use of his right arm back entirely. He damned near died of blood-loss.\u0027\\n\\n Frank had led me away from the entwined subjects of Ki and custody quite well for a man deep into his third Scotch, and I was willing enough to go. I could hardly bear to think of her long days and longer nights in those homes where the Department of Human Services stores away children like knickknacks nobody wants. Ki didn\u0027t live in those places but only existed in them, pale and listless, like a well-fed rabbit kept in a cage. Each time she saw my car turning in or pulling up she came alive, waving her arms and dancing like Snoopy on his doghouse. Our weekend in October had been wonderful (despite my obsessive need to check her every half hour or so after she was asleep), and the Christmas holiday had been even better. Her emphatic desire to be with me was helping in court more than anything else . . . yet the wheels still turned slowly.\\n\\n Maybe in the spring, Mike, John told me. He was a new John these days, pale and serious. The slightly arrogant eager beaver who had wanted nothing more than to go head to head with Mr. Maxwell \u0027Big Bucks\u0027 Devore was no longer in evidence. John had learned something about mortality on the twenty-first of July, and something about the world\u0027s idiot cruelty, as well. The man who had taught himself to shake with his left hand instead of his right was no longer interested in partying \u0027til he puked. He was seeing a girl in Philly, the daughter of one of his mother\u0027s friends. I had no idea if it was serious or not, Ki\u0027s \u0027Unca John\u0027 is closemouthed about that part of his life, but when a young man is of his own accord seeing the daughter of one of his mother\u0027s friends, it usually is.\\n\\n Maybe in the spring: it was his mantra that late fall and early winter. What am I doing wrong? I asked him once ¡ª this was just after Thanksgiving and another setback.\\n\\n Nothing, he replied. Single-parent adoptions are always slow, and when the putative adopter is a man, it\u0027s worse. At that point in the conversation John made an ugly little gesture, poking the index finger of his left hand in and out of his loosely cupped right fist.\\n\\n That\u0027s blatant sex discrimination, John.\\n\\n Yeah, but usually it\u0027s justified. Blame it on every twisted asshole who ever decided he had a right to take off some little kid\u0027s pants, if you want,\u0027 blame it on the bureaucracy, if you want,\u0027 hell, blame it on cosmic rays if you want. It\u0027s a slow process, but you\u0027re going to win in the end. You\u0027ve got a clean record, you\u0027ve got Kyra saying \u0027I want to be with Mike\u0027 to every judge and DHS worker she sees, you\u0027ve got enough money to keep after them no matter how much they squirm and no matter how many forms they throw at you . . . and most of all, buddy, you\u0027ve got me.\\n\\n I had something else, too ¡ª what Ki had whispered in my ear as I paused to catch my breath on the steps. I\u0027d never told John about that, and it was one of the few things I didn\u0027t tell Frank, either.\\n\\n Mattie says I\u0027m your little guy now, she had whispered. Mattie says you\u0027ll take care of me.\\n\\n I was trying to ¡ª as much as the fucking slowpokes at Human Services would let me ¡ª but the waiting was hard.\\n\\n Frank picked up the Scotch and tilted it in my direction. I shook my head. Ki had her heart set on snowman-making, and I wanted to be able to face the glare of early sun on fresh snow without a headache.\\n\\n \u0027Frank, how much of this do you actually believe?\u0027\\n\\n He poured for himself, then just sat for a time, looking down at the table and thinking. When he raised his head again there was a smile on his face. It was so much like Jo\u0027s that it broke my heart. And when he spoke, he juiced his ordinarily faint Boston brogue.\\n\\n \u0027Sure and I\u0027m a half-drunk Irishman who just finished listenin to the granddaddy of all ghost stories on Christmas night,\u0027 he said. \u0027I believe all of it, you silly git.\u0027\\n\\n I laughed and so did he. We did it mostly through the nose, as men are apt to do when up late, maybe in their cups a little, and don\u0027t want to wake the house.\\n\\n \u0027Come on ¡ª how much really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All of it,\u0027 he repeated, dropping the brogue. \u0027Because Jo believed it. And because of her.\u0027 He nodded his head in the direction of the stairs so I\u0027d know which her he meant. \u0027She\u0027s like no other little girl I\u0027ve ever seen. She\u0027s sweet enough, but there\u0027s something in her eyes. At first I thought it was losing her mother the way she did, but that\u0027s not it. There\u0027s more, isn\u0027t there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s in you, too. It\u0027s touched you both.\u0027\\n\\n I thought of the baying thing which Jo had managed to hold back while I poured the lye into that rotted roll of canvas. An Outsider, she had called it. I hadn\u0027t gotten a clear look at it, and probably that was good. Probably that was very good.\\n\\n \u0027Mike?\u0027 Frank looked concerned. \u0027You\u0027re shivering.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 I said. \u0027Really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s it like in the house now?\u0027 he asked. I was still living in Sara Laughs. I procrastinated until early November, then put the Derry house up for sale.\\n\\n \u0027Quiet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Totally quiet?\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, but that wasn\u0027t completely true. On a couple of occasions I had awakened with a sensation Mattie had once mentioned ¡ª that there was someone in bed with me. But not a dangerous presence. On a couple of occasions I have smelled (or thought I have) Red perfume. And sometimes, even when the air is perfectly still, Bunter\u0027s bell will shiver out a few notes. It\u0027s as if something lonely wants to say hello.\\n\\n Frank glanced at the clock, then back at me, almost apologetically. \u0027I\u0027ve got a few more questions ¡ª okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you can\u0027t stay up until the wee hours on Boxing Day morning,\u0027 I said, \u0027I guess you never can. Fire away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did you tell the police?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t have to tell them much of anything. Footman talked enough to suit them ¡ª too much to suit Norris Ridgewick. Footman said that he and Osgood ¡ª it was Osgood driving the car, Devore\u0027s pet broker ¡ª did the drive-by because Devore had made threats about what would happen to them if they didn\u0027t. The State cops also found a copy of a wire-transfer among Devore\u0027s effects at Warrington\u0027s. Two million dollars to an account in the Grand Caymans. The name scribbled on the copy is Randolph Footman. Randolph is George\u0027s middle name. Mr. Footman is now residing in Shawshank State Prison.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about Rogette?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, Whitmore was her mother\u0027s maiden name, but I think it\u0027s safe to say that Rogette\u0027s heart belonged to Daddy. She had leukemia, was diagnosed in 1996. In people her age ¡ª she was only fifty-seven when she died, by the way ¡ª it\u0027s fatal in two cases out of every three, but she was doing the chemo. Hence the wig.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why did she try to kill Kyra? I don\u0027t understand that. If you broke Sara Tidwell\u0027s hold on this earthly plane of ours when you dissolved her bones, the curse should have . . . why are you looking at me that way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d understand if you\u0027d ever met Devore,\u0027 I said. \u0027This is the man who lit the whole fucking TR on fire as a way of saying goodbye when he headed west to sunny California. I thought of him the second I pulled the wig off, thought they\u0027d swapped identities somehow. Then I thought Oh no, it\u0027s her all right, it\u0027s Rogette, she\u0027s just lost her hair somehow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you were right. The chemo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was also wrong. I know more about ghosts than I did, Frank. Maybe the most important thing is that what you see first, what you think first . . . that\u0027s what\u0027s usually true. It was him that day. Devore. He came back at the end. I\u0027m sure of it. At the end it wasn\u0027t about Sara, not for him. At the end it wasn\u0027t even about Kyra. At the end it was about Scooter Larribee\u0027s sled.\u0027\\n\\n Silence between us. For a few moments it was so deep that I could actually hear the house breathing. You can hear that, you know. If you really listen. That\u0027s something else I know now.\\n\\n \u0027Christ,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027I don\u0027t think Devore came east from California to kill her,\u0027 I said. \u0027That wasn\u0027t the original plan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what was? Get to know his granddaughter? Mend his fences?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God, no. You still don\u0027t understand what he was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A human monster. He came back to buy her, but Mattie wouldn\u0027t sell. Then, when Sara got hold of him, he began to plan Ki\u0027s death. I suspect that Sara never found a more willing tool.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How many did she kill in all?\u0027 Frank asked.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know for sure. I don\u0027t think I want to. Based on Jo\u0027s notes and clippings, I\u0027d say that there were perhaps four other . . . directed murders, shall we call them? . . . in the years between 1901 and 1998. All children, all K-names, all closely related to the men who killed her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My God.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think God had much to do with it . . . but she made them pay, all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re sorry for her, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I would have torn her apart before I let her put so much as a finger on Ki, but of course I am. She was raped and murdered. Her child was drowned while she herself lay dying. My God, aren\u0027t you sorry for her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I am. Mike, do you know who the other boy was? The crying boy? Was he the one who died of blood-poisoning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Most of Jo\u0027s notes concerned that part of it ¡ª it\u0027s where she got started. Royce Merrill knew the story well. The crying boy was Reg Tidwell, Junior. You have to understand that by September of 1901, when the Red-Tops played their last show in Castle County, almost everyone on the TR knew that Sara and her boy had been murdered, and almost everyone had a good idea of who\u0027d done it.\\n\\n \u0027Reg Tidwell spent a lot of that August hounding the County Sheriff, Nehemiah Bannerman. At first it was to find them alive ¡ª Tidwell wanted a search mounted ¡ª and then it was to find their bodies, and then it was to find their killers . . . because once he accepted that they were dead, he never doubted that they\u0027d been murdered.\\n\\n \u0027Bannerman was sympathetic at first. Everyone seemed sympathetic at first. The Red-Top crowd had been treated wonderfully during their time on the TR ¡ª that was what infuriated Jared the most ¡ª and I think you can forgive Son Tidwell for making a crucial mistake.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What mistake was that?\u0027\\n\\n Why, he got the idea that Mars was heaven, I thought. The TR must have seemed like heaven to them, right up until Sara and Kito went for a stroll, the boy carrying his berry-bucket, and never came back. It must have seemed that they\u0027d finally found a place where they could be black people and still be allowed to breathe.\\n\\n \u0027Thinking they\u0027d be treated like regular folks when things went wrong, just because they\u0027d been treated that way when things were right. Instead, the TR clubbed together against them. No one who had an idea of what Jared and his prot¨¦g¨¦s had done condoned it, exactly, but when the chips were down . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You protect your own, you wash your dirty laundry with the door closed,\u0027 Frank murmured, and finished his drink.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah. By the time the Red-Tops played the Castle County Fair, their little community down by the lake had begun to break up ¡ª this is all according to Jo\u0027s notes, you understand; there\u0027s not a whisper of it in any of the town histories.\\n\\n \u0027By Labor Day the active harassment had started ¡ª so Royce told Jo. It got a little uglier every day ¡ª a little scarier ¡ª but Son Tidwell flat didn\u0027t want to go, not until he found out what had happened to his sister and nephew. He apparently kept the blood family there in the meadow even after the others had taken off for friendlier locations.\\n\\n \u0027Then someone laid the trap. There was a clearing in the woods about a mile east of what\u0027s now called Tidwell\u0027s Meadow; it had a big birch cross in the middle of it. Jo had a picture of it in her studio. That was where the black community had their services after the doors of the local churches were closed to them. The boy ¡ª Junior ¡ª used to go up there a lot to pray or just to sit and meditate. There were plenty of folks in the township who knew his routine. Someone put a leghold trap on the little path through the woods that the boy used. Covered it with leaves and needles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jesus,\u0027 Frank said. He sounded ill.\\n\\n \u0027Probably it wasn\u0027t Jared Devore or his logger-boys who set it, either ¡ª they didn\u0027t want any more to do with Sara and Son\u0027s people after the murders, they kept right clear of them. It might not even have been a friend of those boys. By then they didn\u0027t have that many friends. But that didn\u0027t change the fact that those folks down by the lake were getting out of their place, scratching at things better left alone, refusing to take no for an answer. So someone set the trap. I don\u0027t think there was any intent to actually kill the boy, but to maim him? Maybe see him with his foot off, condemned to a lifetime crutch? I think they may have gotten that far in their imagining.\\n\\n \u0027In any case it worked. The boy stepped in the trap . . . and for quite awhile they didn\u0027t find him. The pain must have been excruciating. Then the blood-poisoning. He died. Son gave up. He had other kids to think about, not to mention the people who\u0027d stuck with him. They packed up their clothes and their guitars and left. Jo traced some of them to North Carolina, where many of the descendants still live. And during the fires of 1933, the ones young Max Devore set, the cabins burned flat\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand why the bodies of Sara and her son weren\u0027t found,\u0027 Frank said. \u0027I understand that what you smelled ¡ª the putrescence ¡ª wasn\u0027t there in any physical sense. But surely at the time . . . if this path you call The Street was so popular . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Devore and the others didn\u0027t bury them where I found them, not to begin with. They would have started by dragging the bodies deeper into the woods ¡ª maybe up to where the north wing of Sara Laughs stands now. They covered them with brush and came back that night. Must have been that night; to leave them any longer would have drawn every carnivore in the woods. They took them someplace else and buried them in that roll of canvas. Jo didn\u0027t know where, but my guess is Bowie Ridge, where they\u0027d spent most of the summer cutting. Hell, Bowie Ridge is still pretty isolated. They put the bodies somewhere; we might as well say there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then how . . . why . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Draper Finney wasn\u0027t the only one haunted by what they did, Frank ¡ª they all were. Literally haunted. With the possible exception of Jared Devore, I suppose. He lived another ten years and apparently never missed a meal. But the boys had bad dreams, they drank too much, they fought too much, they argued . . . bristled if anyone so much as mentioned the Red-Tops . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Might as well have gone around wearing signs reading KICK US, WE\u0027RE GUILTY,\u0027 Frank commented.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. It probably didn\u0027t help that most of the TR was giving them the silent treatment. Then Finney died in the quarry ¡ª committed suicide in the quarry, I think ¡ª and Jared\u0027s logger-boys got an idea. Came down with it like a cold. Only it was more like a compulsion. Their idea was that if they dug up the bodies and reburied them where it happened, things\u0027d go back to normal for them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did Jared go along with the idea?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027According to Jo\u0027s notes, by then they never went near him. They reburied the bag of bones ¡ª without Jared Devore\u0027s help ¡ª where I eventually dug it up. In the late fall or early winter of 1902, I think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She wanted to be back, didn\u0027t she? Sara. Back where she could really work on them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And on the whole township. Yes. Jo thought so, too. Enough so she didn\u0027t want to go back to Sara Laughs once she found some of this stuff out. Especially when she guessed she was pregnant. When we started trying to have a baby and I suggested the name Kia, how that must have scared her! And I never saw.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sara thought she could use you to kill Kyra if Devore played out before he could get the job done ¡ª he was old and in bad health, after all. Jo gambled that you\u0027d save her instead. That\u0027s what you think, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And she was right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t have done it alone. From the night I dreamed about Sara singing, Jo was with me every step of the way. Sara couldn\u0027t make her quit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, she wasn\u0027t a quitter,\u0027 Frank agreed, and wiped at one eye. \u0027What do you know about your twice-great-aunt? The one that married Auster?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bridget Noonan Auster,\u0027 I said. \u0027Bridey, to her friends. I asked my mother and she swears up and down she knows nothing, that Jo never asked her about Bridey, but I think she might be lying. The young woman was definitely the black sheep of the family ¡ª I can tell just by the sound of Mom\u0027s voice when the name comes up. I have no idea how she met Benton Auster. Let\u0027s say he was down in the Prout\u0027s Neck part of the world visiting friends and started flirting with her at a clambake. That\u0027s as likely as anything else. This was in 1884. She was eighteen, he was twenty-three. They got married, one of those hurry-up jobs. Harry, the one who actually drowned Kito Tidwell, came along six months later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So he was barely seventeen when it happened,\u0027 Frank said. \u0027Great God.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And by then his mother had gotten religion. His terror over what she\u0027d think if she ever found out was part of the reason he did what he did. Any other questions, Frank? Because I\u0027m really starting to fade.\u0027\\n\\n For several moments he said nothing ¡ª I had begun to think he was done when he said, \u0027Two others. Do you mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess it\u0027s too late to back out now. What are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Shape you spoke of. The Outsider. That troubles me.\u0027\\n\\n I said nothing. It troubled me, too.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think there\u0027s a chance it might come back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It always does,\u0027 I said. \u0027At the risk of sounding pompous, the Outsider eventually comes back for all of us, doesn\u0027t it? Because we\u0027re all bags of bones. And the Outsider . . . Frank, the Outsider wants what\u0027s in the bag.\u0027\\n\\n He mulled this over, then swallowed the rest of his Scotch at a gulp.\\n\\n \u0027You had one other question?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Have you started writing again?\u0027\\n\\n I went upstairs a few minutes later, checked Ki, brushed my teeth, checked Ki again, then climbed into bed. From where I lay I was able to look out the window at the pale moon shining on the snow.\\n\\n Have you started writing again?\\n\\n No. Other than a rather lengthy essay on how I spent my summer vacation which I may show to Kyra in some later year, there\u0027s been nothing. I know that Harold is nervous, and sooner or later I suppose I\u0027ll have to call him and tell him what he already guesses: the machine which ran so sweet for so long has stopped. It isn\u0027t broken ¡ª this memoir came out with nary a gasp or missed heartbeat ¡ª but the machine has stopped, just the same. There\u0027s gas in the tank, the sparkplugs spark and the battery bats, but the wordygurdy stands there quiet in the middle of my head. I\u0027ve put a tarp over it. It\u0027s served me well, you see, and I don\u0027t like to think of it getting dusty.\\n\\n Some of it has to do with the way Mattie died. It occurred to me at some point this fall that I had written similar deaths in at least two of my books, and popular fiction is heaped with other examples of the same thing. Have you set up a moral dilemma you don\u0027t know how to solve? Is the protagonist sexually attracted to a woman who is much too young for him, shall we say? Need a quick fix? Easiest thing in the world. \u0027When the story starts going sour, bring on the man with the gun.\u0027 Raymond Chandler said that, or something like it ¡ª close enough for government work, kemo sabe.\\n\\n Murder is the worst kind of pornography, murder is let me do what I want taken to its final extreme. I believe that even make-believe murders should be taken seriously; maybe that\u0027s another idea I got last summer. Perhaps I got it while Mattie was struggling in my arms, gushing blood from her smashed head and dying blind, still crying out for her daughter as she left this earth. To think I might have written such a hellishly convenient death in a book, ever, sickens me.\\n\\n Or maybe I just wish there\u0027d been a little more time.\\n\\n I remember telling Ki it\u0027s best not to leave love letters around; what I thought but didn\u0027t say was that they can come back to haunt you. I am haunted anyway . . . but I will not willingly haunt myself, and when I closed my book of dreams I did so of my own free will. I think I could have poured lye over those dreams as well, but from that I stayed my hand.\\n\\n I\u0027ve seen things I never expected to see and felt things I never expected to feel ¡ª not the least of them what I felt and still feel for the child sleeping down the hall from me. She\u0027s my little guy now, I\u0027m her big guy, and that\u0027s the important thing. Nothing else seems to matter half so much.\\n\\n Thomas Hardy, who supposedly said that the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones, stopped writing novels himself after finishing Jude the Obscure and while he was at the height of his narrative genius. He went on writing poetry for another twenty years, and when someone asked him why he\u0027d quit fiction he said he couldn\u0027t understand why he had trucked with it so long in the first place. In retrospect it seemed silly to him, he said. Pointless. I know exactly what he meant. In the time between now and whenever the Outsider remembers me and decides to come back, there must be other things to do, things that mean more than those shadows. I think I could go back to clanking chains behind the Ghost House wall, but I have no interest in doing so. I\u0027ve lost my taste for spooks. I like to imagine Mattie would think of Bartleby in Melville\u0027s story.\\n\\n I\u0027ve put down my scrivener\u0027s pen. These days I prefer not to. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-31.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
