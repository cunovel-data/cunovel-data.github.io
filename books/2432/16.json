{"id":78361,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"State your name for the record.\u0027 \u0027Michael Noonan.\u0027 \u0027Your address?\u0027 \u0027Derry is my permanent address, 14 Benton Street, but I also maintain a home in TR-90, on Dark Score Lake. The mailing address is Box 832. The actual house is on Lane Forty-two, off Route 68.\u0027 Elmer Durgin, Kyra Devore\u0027s guardian ad litem, waved a pudgy hand in front of his face, either to shoo away some troublesome insect or to tell me that was enough. I agreed that it was. I felt rather like the little girl in Our Town, who gave her address as Grover\u0027s Corner, New Hampshire, America, the Northern Hemisphere, the World, the Solar System, the Milky Way Galaxy, the Mind of God. Mostly I was nervous. I\u0027d reached the age of forty still a virgin in the area of court proceedings, and although we were in the conference room of Durgin, Peters, and Jarrette on Bridge Street in Castle Rock, this was still a court proceeding. There was one mentionably odd detail to these festivities. The stenographer wasn\u0027t using one of those keyboards-on-a-post that look like adding machines, but a Stenomask, a gadget which fit over the lower half of his face. I had seen them before, but only in old black-and-white crime movies, the ones where Dan Duryea or John Payne is always driving around in a Buick with portholes on the sides, looking grim and smoking a Camel. Glancing over into the corner and seeing a guy who looked like the world\u0027s oldest fighter-pilot was weird enough, but hearing everything you said immediately repeated in a muffled monotone was even weirder. \u0027Thank you, Mr. Noonan. My wife has read all your books and says you are her favorite author. I just wanted to get that on the record.\u0027 Durgin chuckled fatly. Why not? He was a fat guy. Most fat people I like ¡ª they have expansive natures to go with their expansive waistlines. But there is a subgroup which I think of as the Evil Little Fat Folks. You don\u0027t want to fuck with the ELFFS if you can help it; they will burn your house and rape your dog if you give them half an excuse and a quarter of an opportunity. Few of them stand over five-foot-two (Durgin\u0027s height, I estimated), and many are under five feet. They smile a lot, but their eyes don\u0027t smile. The Evil Little Fat Folks hate the whole world. Mostly they hate folks who can look down the length of their bodies and still see their own feet. This included me, although just barely. \u0027Please thank your wife for me, Mr. Durgin. I\u0027m sure she could recommend one for you to start on.\u0027 Durgin chuckled. On his right, Durgin\u0027s assistant ¡ª a pretty young woman who looked approximately seventeen minutes out of law school ¡ª chuckled. On my left, Romeo Bissonette chuckled. In the corner, the world\u0027s oldest F- 111 pilot only went on muttering into his Stenomask. \u0027I\u0027ll wait for the big-screen version,\u0027 he said. His eyes gave an ugly little gleam, as if he knew a feature film had never been made from one of my books ¡ª only a made-for-TV movie of Being Two that pulled ratings roughly equal to the National Sofa Refinishing Championships. I hoped that we\u0027d completed this chubby little fuck\u0027s idea of the pleasantries. \u0027I am Kyra Devore\u0027s guardian ad litem,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you know what that means, Mr. Noonan?\u0027 \u0027I believe I do.\u0027 \u0027It means,\u0027 Durgin rolled on, \u0027that I\u0027ve been appointed by Judge Rancourt to decide ¡ª if I can ¡ª where Kyra Devore\u0027s best interests lie, should a custody judgment become necessary. Judge Rancourt would not, in such an event, be required to base his decision on my conclusions, but in many cases that is what happens.\u0027 He looked at me with his hands folded on a blank legal pad. The pretty assistant, on the other hand, was scribbling madly. Perhaps she didn\u0027t trust the fighter-pilot. Durgin looked as if he expected a round of applause. \u0027Was that a question, Mr. Durgin?\u0027 I asked and Romeo Bissonette delivered a light, practiced chip to my ankle. I didn\u0027t need to look at him to know it wasn\u0027t an accident. Durgin pursed lips so smooth and damp that he looked as if he were wearing a clear gloss on them. On his shining pate, roughly two dozen strands of hair were combed in smooth little arcs. He gave me a patient, measuring look. Behind it was all the intransigent ugliness of an Evil Little Fat Folk. The pleasantries were over, all right. I was sure of it. \u0027No, Mr. Noonan, that was not a question. I simply thought you might like to know why we\u0027ve had to ask you to come away from your lovely lake on such a pleasant morning. Perhaps I was wrong. Now, if ¡ª \u0027 There was a peremptory knock on the door, followed by your friend and his, George Footman. Today Cleveland Casual had been replaced by a khaki Deputy Sheriff\u0027s uniform, complete with Sam Browne belt and sidearm. He helped himself to a good look at the assistant\u0027s bustline, displayed in a blue silk blouse, then handed her a folder and a cassette tape recorder. He gave me one brief gander before leaving. I remember you, buddy, that glance said. The smartass writer, the cheap date. Romeo Bissonette tipped his head toward me. He used the side of his hand to bridge the gap between his mouth and my ear. \u0027Devore\u0027s tape,\u0027 he said. I nodded to show I understood, then turned to Durgin again. \u0027Mr. Noonan, you\u0027ve met Kyra Devore and her mother, Mary Devore, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 How did you get Mattie out of Mary, I wondered . . . and then knew, just as I had known about the white shorts and halter top. Mattie was how Ki had first tried to say Mary. \u0027Mr. Noonan, are we keeping you up?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no need to be sarcastic, is there?\u0027 Bissonette asked. His tone was mild, but Elmer Durgin gave him a look which suggested that, should the ELFFS succeed in their goal of world domination, Bissonette would be aboard the first gulag-bound boxcar. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said before Durgin could reply. \u0027I just got derailed there for a second or two.\u0027 \u0027New story idea?\u0027 Durgin asked, smiling his glossy smile. He looked like a swamp-toad in a sportcoat. He turned to the old jet pilot, told him to strike that last, then repeated his question about Kyra and Mattie. Yes, I said, I had met them. \u0027Once or more than once?\u0027 \u0027More than once.\u0027 \u0027How many times have you met them?\u0027 \u0027Twice.\u0027 \u0027Have you also spoken to Mary Devore on the phone?\u0027 Already these questions were moving in a direction that made me uncomfortable. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027How many times?\u0027 \u0027Three times.\u0027 The third had come the day before, when she had asked if I would join her and John Storrow for a picnic lunch on the town common after my deposition. Lunch right there in the middle of town before God and everybody . . . although, with a New York lawyer to play chaperone, what harm in that? \u0027Have you spoken to Kyra Devore on the telephone?\u0027 What an odd question! Not one anybody had prepared me for, either. I supposed that was at least partly why he had asked it. \u0027Mr. Noonan?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I\u0027ve spoken to her once.\u0027 \u0027Can you tell us the nature of that conversation?\u0027 \u0027Well . . . \u0027 I looked doubtfully at Bissonette, but there was no help there. He obviously didn\u0027t know, either. \u0027Mattie ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 Durgin leaned forward as much as he could. His eyes were intent in their pink pockets of flesh. \u0027Mattie?\u0027 \u0027Mattie Devore. Mary Devore.\u0027 \u0027You call her Mattie?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, and had a wild impulse to add: In bed! In bed I call her that! \u0027Oh Mattie, don\u0027t stop, don\u0027t stop,\u0027 I cry!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s the name she gave me when she introduced herself. I met her ¡ª \u0027 \u0027We may get to that, but right now I\u0027m interested in your telephone conversation with Kyra Devore. When was that?\u0027 \u0027It was yesterday.\u0027 \u0027July ninth, 1998.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Who placed that call?\u0027 \u0027Ma . . . Mary Devore.\u0027 Now he\u0027ll ask why she called, I thought, and I\u0027ll say she wanted to have yet another sex marathon, foreplay to consist of feeding each other chocolate-dipped strawberries while we look at pictures of naked malformed dwarves. \u0027How did Kyra Devore happen to speak to you?\u0027 \u0027She asked if she could. I heard her saying to her mother that she had to tell me something.\u0027 \u0027What was it she had to tell you?\u0027 \u0027That she had her first bubble bath.\u0027 \u0027Did she also say she coughed?\u0027 I was quiet, looking at him. In that moment I understood why people hate lawyers, especially when they\u0027ve been dusted over by one who\u0027s good at the job. \u0027Mr. Noonan, would you like me to repeat the question?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I said, wondering where he\u0027d gotten his information. Had these bastards tapped Mattie\u0027s phone? My phone? Both? Perhaps for the first time I understood on a gut level what it must be like to have half a billion dollars. With that much dough you could tap a lot of telephones. \u0027She said her mother pushed bubbles in her face and she coughed. But she was ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Thank you, Mr. Noonan, now let\u0027s turn to ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Let him finish,\u0027 Bissonette said. I had an idea he had already taken a bigger part in the proceedings than he had expected to, but he didn\u0027t seem to mind. He was a sleepy-looking man with a bloodhound\u0027s mournful, trustworthy face. \u0027This isn\u0027t a courtroom, and you\u0027re not cross-examining him.\u0027 \u0027I have the little girl\u0027s welfare to think of,\u0027 Durgin said. He sounded both pompous and humble at the same time, a combination that went together like chocolate sauce on creamed corn. \u0027It\u0027s a responsibility I take very seriously. If I seemed to be badgering you, Mr. Noonan, I apologize.\u0027 I didn\u0027t bother accepting his apology ¡ª that would have made us both phonies. \u0027All I was going to say is that Ki was laughing when she said it. She said she and her mother had a bubble-fight. When her mother came back on, she was laughing, too.\u0027 Durgin had opened the folder Footman had brought him and was paging rapidly through it while I spoke, as if he weren\u0027t hearing a word. \u0027Her mother . . . Mattie, as you call her.\u0027 \u0027Yes. Mattie as I call her. How do you know about our private telephone conversation in the first place?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s none of your business, Mr. Noonan.\u0027 He selected a single sheet of paper, then closed the folder. He held the paper up briefly, like a doctor studying an X-ray, and I could see it was covered with single-spaced typing. \u0027Let\u0027s turn to your initial meeting with Mary and Kyra Devore. That was on the Fourth of July, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Durgin was nodding. \u0027The morning of the Fourth. And you met Kyra Devore first.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027You met her first because her mother wasn\u0027t with her at that time, was she?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a badly phrased question, Mr. Durgin, but I guess the answer is yes.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m flattered to have my grammar corrected by a man who\u0027s been on the bestseller lists,\u0027 Durgin said, smiling. The smile suggested that he\u0027d like to see me sitting next to Romeo Bissonette in that first gulag-bound boxcar. \u0027Tell us about your meeting, first with Kyra Devore and then with Mary Devore. Or Mattie, if you like that better.\u0027 I told the story. When I was finished, Durgin centered the tape player in front of him. The nails of his pudgy fingers looked as glossy as his lips. \u0027Mr. Noonan, you could have run Kyra over, isn\u0027t that true?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely not. I was going thirty-five ¡ª that\u0027s the speed limit there by the store. I saw her in plenty of time to stop.\u0027 \u0027Suppose you had been coming the other way, though ¡ª heading north instead of south. Would you still have seen her in plenty of time?\u0027 That was a fairer question than some of his others, actually. Someone coming the other way would have had a far shorter time to react. Still . . . \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. Durgin went up with the eyebrows. \u0027You\u0027re sure of that?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mr. Durgin. I might have had to come down a little harder on the brakes, but ¡ª \u0027 \u0027At thirty-five.\u0027 \u0027Yes, at thirty-five. I told you, that\u0027s the speed limit ¡ª \u0027 \u0027 ¡ª -on that particular stretch of Route 68. Yes, you told me that. You did. Is it your experience that most people obey the speed limit on that part of the road?\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t spent much time on the TR since 1993, so I can\u0027t ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Come on, Mr. Noonan ¡ª this isn\u0027t a scene from one of your books. Just answer my questions, or we\u0027ll be here all morning.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m doing my best, Mr. Durgin.\u0027 He sighed, put-upon. \u0027You\u0027ve owned your place on Dark Score Lake since the eighties, haven\u0027t you? And the speed limit around the Lakeview General Store, the post office, and Dick Brooks\u0027s All-Purpose Garage ¡ª what\u0027s called The North Village ¡ª hasn\u0027t changed since then, has it?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I admitted. \u0027Returning to my original question, then ¡ª in your observation, do most people on that stretch of road obey the thirty-five-mile-an-hour limit?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t say if it\u0027s most, because I\u0027ve never done a traffic survey, but I guess a lot don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Would you like to hear Castle County Sheriffs Deputy Footman testify on where the greatest number of speeding tickets are given out in TR-90, Mr. Noonan?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I said, quite honestly. \u0027Did other vehicles pass you while you were speaking first with Kyra Devore and then with Mary Devore?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027How many?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know exactly. A couple.\u0027 \u0027Could it have been three?\u0027 \u0027I guess.\u0027 \u0027Five?\u0027 \u0027No, probably not so many.\u0027 \u0027But you don\u0027t know, exactly, do you?\u0027 \u0027Because Kyra Devore was upset.\u0027 \u0027Actually she had it together pretty well for a ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Did she cry in your presence?\u0027 \u0027Well . . . yes.\u0027 \u0027Did her mother make her cry?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s unfair.\u0027 \u0027As unfair as allowing a three-year-old to go strolling down the middle of a busy highway on a holiday morning, in your opinion, or perhaps not quite as unfair as that?\u0027 \u0027Jeepers, lay off,\u0027 Mr. Bissonette said mildly. There was distress on his bloodhound\u0027s face. \u0027I withdraw the question,\u0027 Durgin said. \u0027Which one?\u0027 I asked. He looked at me tiredly, as if to say he had to put up with assholes like me all the time and he was used to how we behaved. \u0027How many cars went by from the time you picked the child up and carried her to safety to the time when you and the Devores parted company?\u0027 I hated that \u0027carried her to safety\u0027 bit, but even as I formulated my answer, the old guy was muttering the question into his Stenomask. And it was in fact what I had done. There was no getting around it. \u0027I told you, I don\u0027t know for sure.\u0027 \u0027Well, give me a guesstimate.\u0027 Guesstimate. One of my all-time least favorite words. A Paul Harvey word. \u0027There might have been three.\u0027 \u0027Including Mary Devore herself?. Driving a ¡ª \u0027 He consulted the paper he\u0027d taken from the folder. \u0027 ¡ª a 1982 Jeep Scout?\u0027 I thought of Ki saying Mattie go fast and understood where Durgin was heading now. And there was nothing I could do about it. \u0027Yes, it was her and it was a Scout. I don\u0027t know what year.\u0027 \u0027Was she driving below the posted speed limit, at the posted speed limit, or above the posted speed limit when she passed the place where you were standing with Kyra in your arms?\u0027 She\u0027d been doing at least fifty, but I told Durgin I couldn\u0027t say for sure. He urged me to try ¡ª I know you are unfamiliar with the hangman\u0027s knot, Mr. Noonan, but I\u0027m sure you can make one if you really work at it ¡ª and I declined as politely as I could. He picked up the paper again. \u0027Mr. Noonan, would it surprise you to know that two witnesses ¡ª Richard Brooks, Junior, the owner of Dick\u0027s All-Purpose Garage, and Royce Merrill, a retired carpenter ¡ª claim that Mrs. Devore was doing well over thirty-five when she passed your location?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said. \u0027I was concerned with the little girl.\u0027 \u0027Would it surprise you to know that Royce Merrill estimated her speed at sixty miles an hour?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous. When she hit the brakes she would have skidded sideways and landed upside down in the ditch.\u0027 \u0027The skid-marks measured by Deputy Footman indicate a speed of at least fifty miles an hour,\u0027 Durgin said. It wasn\u0027t a question, but he looked at me almost roguishly, as if inviting me to struggle a little more and sink a little deeper into this nasty pit. I said nothing. Durgin folded his pudgy little hands and leaned over them toward me. The roguish look was gone. \u0027Mr. Noonan, if you hadn\u0027t carried Kyra Devore to the side of the road ¡ª if you hadn\u0027t rescued her ¡ª mightn\u0027t her own mother have run her over?\u0027 Here was the really loaded question, and how should I answer it? Bissonette was certainly not flashing any helpful signals; he seemed to be trying to make meaningful eye-contact with the pretty assistant. I thought of the book Mattie was reading in tandem with \u0027Bartleby\u0027 ¡ª Silent Witness, by Richard North Patterson. Unlike the Grisham brand, Patterson\u0027s lawyers almost always seemed to know what they were doing. Objection, Your honor, calls for speculation on the part of the witness. I shrugged. \u0027Sorry, counsellor, can\u0027t say ¡ª left my crystal ball home.\u0027 Again I saw the ugly flash in Durgin\u0027s eyes. \u0027Mr. Noonan, I can assure you that if you don\u0027t answer that question here, you are apt to be called back from Malibu or Fire Island or wherever it is you\u0027re going to write your next opus to answer it later on.\u0027 I shrugged. \u0027I\u0027ve already told you I was concerned with the child. I can\u0027t tell you how fast the mother was going, or how good Royce Merrill\u0027s vision is, or if Deputy Footman even measured the right set of skid-marks. There\u0027s a whole bunch of rubber on that part of the road, I can tell you. Suppose she was going fifty? Even fifty-five, let\u0027s say that. She\u0027s twenty-one years old, Durgin. At the age of twenty-one, a person\u0027s driving skills are at their peak. She probably would have swerved around the child, and easily.\u0027 \u0027I think that\u0027s quite enough.\u0027 \u0027Why? Because you\u0027re not getting what you wanted?\u0027 Bissonette\u0027s shoe clipped my ankle again, but I ignored it. \u0027If you\u0027re on Kyra\u0027s side, why do you sound as though you\u0027re on her grandfather\u0027s?\u0027 A baleful little smile touched Durgin\u0027s lips. The kind that says Okay, smart guy, you want to play? He pulled the tape-recorder a little closer to him. \u0027Since you have mentioned Kyra\u0027s grandfather, Mr. Maxwell Devore of Palm Springs, let\u0027s talk about him a little, shall we?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s your show.\u0027 \u0027Have you ever spoken with Maxwell Devore?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027In person or on the phone?\u0027 \u0027Phone.\u0027 I thought about adding that he had somehow gotten hold of my unlisted number, then remembered that Mattie had, too, and decided to keep my mouth shut on that subject. \u0027When was this?\u0027 \u0027Last Saturday night. The night of the Fourth. He called while I was watching the fireworks.\u0027 \u0027And was the subject of your conversation that morning\u0027s little adventure?\u0027 As he asked, Durgin reached into his pocket and brought out a cassette tape. There was an ostentatious quality to this gesture; in that moment he looked like a parlor magician showing you both sides of a silk handkerchief. And he was bluffing. I couldn\u0027t be sure of that . . . and yet I was. Devore had taped our conversation, all right ¡ª that underhum really had been too loud, and on some level I\u0027d been aware of that fact even while I was talking to him ¡ª and I thought it really was on the cassette Durgin was now slotting into the cassette player . . . but it was a bluff. \u0027I don\u0027t recall,\u0027 I said. Durgin\u0027s hand froze in the act of snapping the cassette\u0027s transparent loading panel shut. He looked at me with frank disbelief . . . and something else. I thought the something else was surprised anger. \u0027You don\u0027t recall? Come now, Mr. Noonan. Surely writers train themselves to recall conversations, and this one was only a week ago. Tell me what you talked about.\u0027 \u0027I really can\u0027t say,\u0027 I told him in a stolid, colorless voice. For a moment Durgin looked almost panicky. Then his features smoothed. One polished fingernail slipped back and forth over keys marked REW, FF, PLAY, and REC. \u0027How did Mr. Devore begin the conversation?\u0027 he asked. \u0027He said hello,\u0027 I said mildly, and there was a short muffled sound from behind the Stenomask. It could have been the old guy clearing his throat; it could have been a suppressed laugh. Spots of color were blooming in Durgin\u0027s cheeks. \u0027After hello? What then?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t recall.\u0027 \u0027Did he ask you about that morning?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t recall.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t you tell him that Mary Devore and her daughter were together, Mr. Noonan? That they were together picking flowers? Isn\u0027t that what you told this worried grandfather when he inquired about the incident which was the talk of the township that Fourth of July?\u0027 \u0027Oh boy,\u0027 Bissonette said. He raised one hand over the table, then touched the palm with the fingers of the other, making a ref\u0027s T. \u0027Time out.\u0027 Durgin looked at him. The flush in his cheeks was more pronounced now, and his lips had pulled back enough to show the tips of small, neatly capped teeth. \u0027What do you want?\u0027 he almost snarled, as if Bissonette had just dropped by to tell him about the Mormon Way or perhaps the Rosicrucians. \u0027I want you to stop leading this guy, and I want that whole thing about picking flowers stricken from the record,\u0027 Bissonette said. \u0027Why?\u0027 Durgin snapped. \u0027Because you\u0027re trying to get stuff on the record that this witness won\u0027t say. If you want to break here for awhile so we can make a conference call to Judge Rancourt, get his opinion ¡ª \u0027 \u0027I withdraw the question,\u0027 Durgin said. He looked at me with a kind of helpless, surly rage. \u0027Mr. Noonan, do you want to help me do my job?\u0027 \u0027I want to help Kyra Devore if I can,\u0027 I said. \u0027Very well.\u0027 He nodded as if no distinction had been made. \u0027Then please tell me what you and Maxwell Devore talked about.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t recall.\u0027 I caught his eyes and held them. \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 I said, \u0027you can refresh my recollection.\u0027 There was a moment of silence, like that which sometimes strikes a high-stakes poker game just after the last of the bets have been made and just before the players show their hands. Even the old fighter-pilot was quiet, his eyes unblinking above the mask. Then Durgin pushed the cassette player aside with the heel of his hand (the set of his mouth said he felt about it just then as I often felt about the telephone) and went back to the morning of July Fourth. He never asked about my dinner with Mattie and Ki on Tuesday night, and never returned to my telephone conversation with Devore ¡ª the one where I had said all those awkward and easily disprovable things. I went on answering questions until eleven-thirty, but the interview really ended when Durgin pushed the tape-player away with the heel of his hand. I knew it, and I\u0027m pretty sure he did, too. \u0027Mike! Mike, over here!\u0027 Mattie was waving from one of the tables in the picnic area behind the town common\u0027s bandstand. She looked vibrant and happy. I waved back and made my way in that direction, weaving between little kids playing tag, skirting a couple of teenagers making out on the grass, and ducking a Frisbee which a leaping German shepherd caught smartly. There was a tall, skinny redhead with her, but I barely got a chance to notice him. Mattie met me while I was still on the gravel path, put her arms around me, hugged me ¡ª it was no prudey little ass-poking-out hug, either ¡ª and then kissed me on the mouth hard enough to push my lips against my teeth. There was a hearty smack when she disengaged. She pulled back and looked at me with undisguised delight. \u0027Was it the biggest kiss you\u0027ve ever had?\u0027 \u0027The biggest in at least four years,\u0027 I said. \u0027Will you settle for that?\u0027 And if she didn\u0027t step away from me in the next few seconds, she was going to have physical proof of how much I had enjoyed it. \u0027I guess I\u0027ll have to.\u0027 She turned to the redheaded guy with a funny kind of defiance. \u0027Was that all right?\u0027 \u0027Probably not,\u0027 he said, \u0027but at least you\u0027re not currently in view of those old boys at the All-Purpose Garage. Mike, I\u0027m John Storrow. Nice to meet you in person.\u0027 I liked him at once, maybe because I\u0027d come upon him dressed in his three-piece New York suit and primly setting out paper plates on a picnic table while his curly red hair blew around his head like kelp. His skin was fair and freckled, the kind which would never tan, only burn and then peel in great eczema-like patches. When we shook, his hand seemed to be all knuckles. He had to be at least thirty, but he looked Mattie\u0027s age, and I guessed it would be another five years before he was able to get a drink without showing his driver\u0027s license. \u0027Sit down,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve got a five-course lunch, courtesy of Castle Rock Variety ¡ª grinders, which are for some strange reason called \u0027Italian sandwiches\u0027 up here . . . mozzarella sticks . . . garlic fries . . . Twinkies.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s only four,\u0027 I said. \u0027I forgot the soft-drink course,\u0027 he said, and pulled three long-neck bottles of S\u0027OK birch beer out of a brown bag. \u0027Let\u0027s eat. Mattie runs the library from two to eight on Fridays and Saturdays, and this would be a bad time for her to be missing work.\u0027 \u0027How did the readers\u0027 circle go last night?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Lindy Briggs didn\u0027t eat you alive, I see.\u0027 She laughed, clasped her hands, and shook them over her head. \u0027I was a hit! An absolute smashola! I didn\u0027t dare tell them I got all my best insights from you ¡ª \u0027 \u0027Thank God for small favors,\u0027 Storrow said. He was freeing his own sandwich from its string and butcher-paper wrapping, doing it carefully and a little dubiously, using just the tips of his fingers. \u0027 ¡ª so I said I looked in a couple of books and found some leads there. It was sort of wonderful. I felt like a college kid.\u0027 \u0027Good.\u0027 \u0027Bissonette?\u0027 John Storrow asked. \u0027Where\u0027s he? I never met a guy named Romeo before.\u0027 \u0027Said he had to go right back to Lewiston. Sorry.\u0027 \u0027Actually it\u0027s best we stay small, at least to begin with.\u0027 He bit into his sandwich ¡ª they come tucked into long sub rolls ¡ª and looked at me, surprised. \u0027This isn\u0027t bad.\u0027 \u0027Eat more than three and you\u0027re hooked for life,\u0027 Mattie said, and chomped heartily into her own. \u0027Tell us about the depo,\u0027 John said, and while they ate, I talked. When I finished, I picked up my own sandwich and played a little catch-up. I\u0027d forgotten how good an Italian can be ¡ª sweet, sour, and oily all at the same time. Of course nothing that tastes that good can be healthy; that\u0027s a given. I suppose one could formulate a similar postulate about full-body hugs from young girls in legal trouble. \u0027Very interesting,\u0027 John said. \u0027Very interesting indeed.\u0027 He took a mozzarella stick from its grease-stained bag, broke it open, and looked with a kind of fascinated horror at the clotted white gunk inside. \u0027People up here eat this?\u0027 he asked. \u0027People in New York eat fish-bladders,\u0027 I said. \u0027Raw.\u0027 \u0027Touch¨¦\u0027 He dipped a piece into the plastic container of spaghetti sauce (in this context it is called \u0027cheese-dip\u0027 in western Maine), then ate it. \u0027Well?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Not bad. They ought to be a lot hotter, though.\u0027 Yes, he was right about that. Eating cold mozzarella sticks is a little like eating cold snot, an observation I thought I would keep to myself on this beautiful midsummer Friday. \u0027If Durgin had the tape, why wouldn\u0027t he play it?\u0027 Mattie asked. \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 John stretched his arms out, cracked his knuckles, and looked at her benignly. \u0027We\u0027ll probably never know for sure,\u0027 he said. He thought Devore was going to drop the suit ¡ª it was in every line of his body-language and every inflection of his voice. That was hopeful, but it would be good if Mattie didn\u0027t allow herself to become too hopeful. John Storrow wasn\u0027t as young as he looked, and probably not as guileless, either (or so I fervently hoped), but he was young. And neither he nor Mattie knew the story of Scooter Larribee\u0027s sled. Or had seen Bill Dean\u0027s face when he told it. \u0027Want to hear some possibilities?\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 I said. John put down his sandwich, wiped his fingers, and then began to tick off points. \u0027First, he made the call. Taped conversations have a highly dubious value under those circumstances. Second, he didn\u0027t exactly come off like Captain Kangaroo, did he?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Third, your fabrication impugns you, Mike, but not really very much, and it doesn\u0027t impugn Mattie at all. And by the way, that thing about Mattie pushing bubbles in Kyra\u0027s face, I love that. If that\u0027s the best they can do, they better give it up right now. Last ¡ª and this is where the truth probably lies ¡ª I think Devore\u0027s got Nixon\u0027s Disease.\u0027 \u0027Nixon\u0027s Disease?\u0027 Mattie asked. \u0027The tape Durgin had isn\u0027t the only tape. Can\u0027t be. And your father-in-law is afraid that if he introduces one tape made by whatever system he\u0027s got in Warrington\u0027s, we might subpoena all of them. And I\u0027d damn well try.\u0027 She looked bewildered. \u0027What could be on them? And if it\u0027s bad, why not just destroy them?\u0027 \u0027Maybe he can\u0027t,\u0027 I said. \u0027Maybe he needs them for other reasons.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t really matter,\u0027 John said. \u0027Durgin was bluffing, and that\u0027s what matters.\u0027 He hit the heel of his hand lightly against the picnic table. \u0027I think he\u0027s going to drop it. I really do.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s too early to start thinking like that,\u0027 I said at once, but I could tell by Mattie\u0027s face ¡ª shining more brightly than ever ¡ª that the damage was done. \u0027Fill him in on what else you\u0027ve been doing,\u0027 Mattie told John. \u0027Then I\u0027ve got to get to the library.\u0027 \u0027Where do you send Kyra on your workdays?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Mrs. Cullum\u0027s. She lives two miles up the Wasp Hill Road. Also in July there\u0027s VBS from ten until three. That\u0027s Vacation Bible School. Ki loves it, especially the singing and the flannel-board stories about Noah and Moses. The bus drops her off at Arlene\u0027s, and I pick her up around quarter of nine.\u0027 She smiled a little wistfully. \u0027By then she\u0027s usually fast asleep on the couch.\u0027 John held forth for the next ten minutes or so. He hadn\u0027t been on the case long, but had already started a lot of balls rolling. A fellow in California was gathering facts about Roger Devore and Morris Ridding (\u0027gathering facts\u0027 sounded so much better than \u0027snooping\u0027). John was particularly interested in learning about the quality of Roger Devore\u0027s relations with his father, and if Roger was on record concerning his little niece from Maine. John had also mapped out a campaign to learn as much as possible about Max Devore\u0027s movements and activities since he\u0027d come back to TR-90. To that end he had the name of a private investigator, one recommended by Romeo Bissonette, my rent-a-lawyer. As he spoke, paging rapidly through a little notebook he drew from the inside pocket of his suitcoat, I remembered what he\u0027d said about Lady Justice during our telephone conversation: Slap some handcuffs on that broad\u0027s wrists and some tape over her mouth to go along with the blindfold, rape her and roll her in the mud. That was maybe a bit too strong for what we were doing, but I thought at the very least we were shoving her around a little. I imagined poor Roger Devore up on the stand, having flown three thousand miles in order to be questioned about his sexual preferences. I had to keep reminding myself that his father had put him in that position, not Mattie or me or John Storrow. \u0027Have you gotten any closer to a meeting with Devore and his chief legal advisor?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Don\u0027t know for sure. The line is in the water, the offer is on the table, the puck\u0027s on the ice, pick your favorite metaphor, mix em and match em if you desire.\u0027 \u0027Got your irons in the fire,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027Your checkers on the board,\u0027 I added. We looked at each other and laughed. John regarded us sadly, then sighed, picked up his sandwich, and began to eat again. \u0027You really have to meet him with his lawyer more or less dancing attendance?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Would you like to win this thing, then discover Devore can do it all again based on unethical behavior by Mary Devore\u0027s legal resource?\u0027 John returned. \u0027Don\u0027t even joke about it!\u0027 Mattie cried. \u0027I wasn\u0027t joking,\u0027 John said. \u0027It has to be with his lawyer, yes. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to happen, not on this trip. I haven\u0027t even got a look at the old cockuh, and I have to tell you my curiosity is killing me.\u0027 \u0027If that\u0027s all it takes to make you happy, show up behind the backstop at the softball field next Tuesday evening,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027He\u0027ll be there in his fancy wheelchair, laughing and clapping and sucking his damned old oxygen every fifteen minutes or so.\u0027 \u0027Not a bad idea,\u0027 John said. \u0027I have to go back to New York for the weekend ¡ª I\u0027m leaving apr¨¨s Osgood ¡ª but maybe I\u0027ll show up on Tuesday. I might even bring my glove.\u0027 He began clearing up our litter, and once again I thought he looked both prissy and endearing at the same time, like Stan Laurel wearing an apron. Mattie eased him aside and took over. \u0027No one ate any Twinkles,\u0027 she said, a little sadly. \u0027Take them home to your daughter,\u0027 John said. \u0027No way. I don\u0027t let her eat stuff like this. What kind of mother do you think I am?\u0027 She saw our expressions, replayed what she\u0027d just said, then burst out laughing. We joined her. Mattie\u0027s old Scout was parked in one of the slant spaces behind the war memorial, which in Castle Rock is a World War I soldier with a generous helping of birdshit on his pie-dish helmet. A brand-new Taurus with a Hertz decal above the inspection sticker was parked next to it. John tossed his briefcase ¡ª reassuringly thin and not very ostentatious ¡ª into the back seat. \u0027If I can make it back on Tuesday, I\u0027ll call you,\u0027 he told Mattie. \u0027If I\u0027m able to get an appointment with your father-in-law through this man Osgood, I will also call you.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll buy the Italian sandwiches,\u0027 Mattie said. He smiled, then grasped her arm in one hand and mine in the other. He looked like a newly ordained minister getting ready to marry his first couple. \u0027You two talk on the telephone if you need to,\u0027 he said, \u0027always remembering that one or both lines may be tapped. Meet in the market if you happen to. Mike, you might feel a need to drop by the local library and check out a book.\u0027 \u0027Not until you renew your card, though,\u0027 Mattie said, giving me a demure glance. \u0027But no more visits to Mattie\u0027s trailer. Is that understood?\u0027 I said yes; she said yes; John Storrow looked unconvinced. It made me wonder if he was seeing something in our faces or bodies that shouldn\u0027t be there. \u0027They are committed to a line of attack which probably isn\u0027t going to work,\u0027 he said. \u0027We can\u0027t risk giving them the chance to change course. That means innuendos about the two of you; it also means innuendos about Mike and Kyra.\u0027 Mattie\u0027s shocked expression made her look twelve again. \u0027Mike and Kyra! What are you talking about?\u0027 \u0027Allegations of child molestation thrown up by people so desperate they\u0027ll try anything.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 she said. \u0027And if my father-in-law wanted to sling that kind of mud ¡ª \u0027 John nodded. \u0027Yes, we\u0027d be obligated to sling it right back. Newspaper coverage from coast to coast would follow, maybe even Court TV, God bless and save us. We want none of that if we can avoid it. It\u0027s not good for the grownups, and it\u0027s not good for the child. Now or later.\u0027 He bent and kissed Mattie\u0027s cheek. \u0027I\u0027m sorry about all this,\u0027 he said, and he did sound genuinely sorry. \u0027Custody\u0027s just this way.\u0027 \u0027I think you warned me. It\u0027s just that . . . the idea someone might make a thing like that up just because there was no other way for them to win . . . \u0027 \u0027Let me warn you again,\u0027 he said. His face came as close to grim as its young and good-natured features would probably allow. \u0027What we have is a very rich man with a very shaky case. The combination could be like working with old dynamite.\u0027 I turned to Mattie. \u0027Are you still worried about Ki? Still feel she\u0027s in danger?\u0027 I saw her think about hedging her response ¡ª out of plain old Yankee reserve, quite likely ¡ª and then deciding not to. Deciding, perhaps, that hedging was a luxury she couldn\u0027t afford. \u0027Yes. But it\u0027s just a feeling, you know.\u0027 John was frowning. I supposed the idea that Devore might resort to extralegal means of obtaining what he wanted had occurred to him, as well. \u0027Keep your eye on her as much as you can,\u0027 he said. \u0027I respect intuition. Is yours based on anything concrete?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Mattie answered, and her quick glance in my direction asked me to keep my mouth shut. \u0027Not really.\u0027 She opened the Scout\u0027s door and tossed in the little brown bag with the Twinkies in it ¡ª she had decided to keep them after all. Then she turned to John and me with an expression that was close to anger. \u0027I\u0027m not sure how to follow that advice, anyway. I work five days a week, and in August, when we do the microfiche update, it\u0027ll be six. Right now Ki gets her lunch at Vacation Bible School and her dinner from Arlene Cullum. I see her in the mornings. The rest of the time . . . \u0027 I knew what she was going to say before she said it; the expression was an old one. \u0027 . . . she\u0027s on the TR.\u0027 \u0027I could help you find an au pair,\u0027 I said, thinking it would be a hell of a lot cheaper than John Storrow. \u0027No,\u0027 they said in such perfect unison that they glanced at each other and laughed. But even while she was laughing, Mattie looked tense and unhappy. \u0027We\u0027re not going to leave a paper trail for Durgin or Devore\u0027s custody team to exploit,\u0027 John said. \u0027Who pays me is one thing. Who pays Mattie\u0027s child-care help is another.\u0027 \u0027Besides, I\u0027ve taken enough from you,\u0027 Mattie said. \u0027More than I can sleep easy on. I\u0027m not going to get in any deeper just because I\u0027ve been having megrims.\u0027 She climbed into the Scout and closed the door. I rested my hands on her open window. Now we were on the same level, and the eye-contact was so strong it was disconcerting. \u0027Mattie, I don\u0027t have anything else to spend it on. Really.\u0027 \u0027When it comes to John\u0027s fee, I accept that. Because John\u0027s fee is about Ki.\u0027 She put her hand over mine and squeezed briefly. \u0027This other is about me. All right?\u0027 \u0027Yeah. But you need to tell your babysitter and the people who run this Bible thing that you\u0027ve got a custody case on your hands, a potentially bitter one, and Kyra\u0027s not to go anywhere with anyone, even someone they know, without your say-so.\u0027 She smiled. \u0027It\u0027s already been done. On John\u0027s advice. Stay in touch, Mike.\u0027 She lifted my hand, gave it a hearty smack, and drove away. \u0027What do you think?\u0027 I asked John as we watched the Scout blow oil on its way to the new Prouty Bridge, which spans Castle Street and spills outbound traffic onto Highway 68. \u0027I think it\u0027s grand she has a well-heeled benefactor and a smart lawyer,\u0027 John said. He paused, then added: \u0027But I\u0027ll tell you some-thing ¡ª she somehow doesn\u0027t feel lucky to me at all. There\u0027s a feeling I get . . . I don\u0027t know . . . \u0027 \u0027That there\u0027s a cloud around her you can\u0027t quite see.\u0027 \u0027Maybe. Maybe that\u0027s it.\u0027 He raked his hands through the restless mass of his red hair. \u0027I just know it\u0027s something sad.\u0027 I knew exactly what he meant . . . except for me there was more. I wanted to be in bed with her, sad or not, right or not. I wanted to feel her hands on me, tugging and pressing, patting and stroking. I wanted to be able to smell her skin and taste her hair. I wanted to have her lips against my ear, her breath tickling the fine hairs within its cup as she told me to do what I wanted, whatever I wanted. I got back to Sara Laughs shortly before two o\u0027clock and let myself in, thinking about nothing but my study and the IBM with the Courier ball. I was writing again ¡ª writing. I could still hardly believe it. I\u0027d work (not that it felt much like work after a four-year layoff) until maybe six o\u0027clock, swim, then go down to the Village Cafe for one of Buddy\u0027s cholesterol-rich specialties. The moment I stepped through the door, Bunter\u0027s bell began to ring stridently. I stopped in the foyer, my hand frozen on the knob. The house was hot and bright, not a shadow anywhere, but the gooseflesh forming on my arms felt like midnight. \u0027Who\u0027s here?\u0027 I called. The bell stopped ringing. There was a moment of silence, and then a woman shrieked. It came from everywhere, pouring out of the sunny, mote-laden air like sweat out of hot skin. It was a scream of outrage, anger, grief . . . but mostly, I think, of horror. And I screamed in response. I couldn\u0027t help it. I had been frightened standing in the dark cellar stairwell, listening to the unseen fist thump on the insulation, but this was far worse. It never stopped, that scream. It faded, as the child\u0027s sobs had faded; faded as if the person screaming was being carried rapidly down a long corridor and away from me. At last it was gone. I leaned against the bookcase, my palm pressed against my tee-shirt, my heart galloping beneath it. I was gasping for breath, and my muscles had that queer exploded feel they get after you\u0027ve had a bad scare. A minute passed. My heartbeat gradually slowed, and my breathing slowed with it. I straightened up, took a tottery step, and when my legs held me, took two more. I stood in the kitchen doorway, looking across to the living room. Above the fireplace, Bunter the moose looked glassily back at me. The bell around his neck hung still and chimeless. A hot sunpoint glowed on its side. The only sound was that stupid Felix the Cat clock in the kitchen. The thought nagging at me, even then, was that the screaming woman had been Jo, that Sara Laughs was being haunted by my wife, and that she was in pain. Dead or not, she was in pain. \u0027Jo?\u0027 I asked quietly. \u0027Jo, are you ¡ª \u0027 The sobbing began again ¡ª the sound of a terrified child. At the same moment my mouth and nose once more filled with the iron taste of the lake. I put one hand to my throat, gagging and frightened, then leaned over the sink and spat. It was as it had been before ¡ª instead of voiding a gush of water, nothing came out but a little spit. The waterlogged feeling was gone as if it had never been there. I stayed where I was, grasping the counter and bent over the sink, probably looking like a drunk who has finished the party by upchucking most of the night\u0027s bottled cheer. I felt like that, too ¡ª stunned and bleary, too overloaded to really understand what was going on. At last I straightened up again, took the towel folded over the dishwasher\u0027s handle, and wiped my face with it. There was tea in the fridge, and I wanted a tall, ice-choked glass of it in the worst way. I reached for the doorhandle and froze. The fruit and vegetable magnets were drawn into a circle again. In the center was this: help im drown That\u0027s it, I thought. I\u0027m getting out of here. Right now. Today. Yet an hour later I was up in my stifling study with a glass of tea on the desk beside me (the cubes in it long since melted), dressed only in my bathing trunks and lost in the world I was making ¡ª the one where a private detective named Andy Drake was trying to prove that John Shackleford was not the serial killer nicknamed Baseball Cap. This is how we go on: one day at a time, one meal at a time, one pain at a time, one breath at a time. Dentists go on one root-canal at a time; boat-builders go on one hull at a time. If you write books, you go on one page at a time. We turn from all we know and all we fear. We study catalogues, watch football games, choose Sprint over AT\u0026T. We count the birds in the sky and will not turn from the window when we hear the footsteps behind us as something comes up the hall; we say yes, I agree that clouds often look like other things ¡ª fish and unicorns and men on horseback ¡ª but they are really only clouds. Even when the lightning flashes inside them we say they are only clouds and turn our attention to the next meal, the next pain, the next breath, the next page. This is how we go on.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bag-of-bones/page-16.html","bookId":2432,"book":{"id":2432,"title":"Bag of Bones","description":"Storyline: Four years after the sudden death of his wife, forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan is unable to write and plagued by vivid nightmares set at the Maine summerhouse he calls Sara Laughs.
