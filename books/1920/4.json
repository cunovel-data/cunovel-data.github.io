He could live with just this - her hot and luscious body in his bed, taking everything he could give her with unrestrained abandon. It was too easy to picture her in his penthouse in Manhattan, spread out on his gray silk sheets, sobbing his name as he fucked her with the nightscape of the city displayed thru the floor-to-ceiling windows behind the bed. \"Umm... Miguel.\" Her hands slid over his damp back, her lips pressed against the sensitive spot just in front of his ear. \"I did miss you.\" He caught one of her hands, then the other, dragging them over her head. With his knee, he nudged her leg over, widening the cradle of her thighs. He lifted his head and looked down at her, his aspirations for the result of this visit altering by the moment. His tongue traced the curve of his lower lip, his gaze sweeping over her face, taking in the dazed pleasure in her eyes and the cat-like smile of contentment. He rolled his hips just to feel how soaked she was. She inhaled sharply. \"You\u0027re still hard.\" \"Are you surprised, mi querida? I\u0027ve missed you, too.\" He felt the sole of her shoe rub up and down his calf. A gruff sound of pleasure escaped him. Looking up at him with the blue eyes that haunted him, she gave him a taunting smile and wriggled suggestively. \"Take me, then, mi tesoro. I\u0027m yours.\" No, you\u0027re not, he thought as he withdrew slowly, only to thrust home hard and fast. Not yet. But you will be. Chapter 3 Watching Faith shift gears in her classic Corvette was so arousing, Miguel\u0027s dick stirred with appreciation even though he was presently wrung dry. That was why they\u0027d left the bungalow, why they were driving to a sports bar with a late-night kitchen. She made him feel like a teenager again, hopeful and vigorous. He\u0027d had her in bed twice, then again in the shower. When she sat on the couch in a plush terrycloth robe with her hair hanging in wet tangles around her shoulders, he\u0027d wanted her again. The domesticity that he avoided with other women had been an aphrodisiac with Faith. He\u0027d sat on the couch beside her and pulled her over him, his head falling back into the cushions as she slid her slick, hot cunt onto him. They\u0027d gone easy on each other the last time, neither of them in a rush. He could tell she was getting sore and guessed she\u0027d been without a steady partner in a while. Yet she\u0027d come willingly to him when he asked. The pleasure he could give her was a vulnerability he was prepared to exploit. He would do or say whatever was necessary to get her to come home with him. The world was at his fingertips. He could meet whatever demands she might make of him. \"You\u0027re thinking hard,\" she said, pulling deftly into the parking lot and claiming at space. \"But at least you\u0027re not scowling anymore.\" \"I\u0027m too relaxed to scowl.\" \"Well, then, the food and a beer might put you to sleep.\" He climbed out of the passenger seat and looked over the roof to where she stood on the driver\u0027s side. \"Don\u0027t count on it.\" \"Promises, promises,\" she teased. He met her around the front, raking her with a head-to-toe glance. She\u0027d lost her makeup and hairstyle in the shower, but he didn\u0027t see her as any less stunning now. The dress was amazing for its simplicity, allowing the woman inside it to take center stage - a woman who was presently commando in public, which drove him insane every time he thought about it. For the last dozen years he\u0027d hungered for this, spending time with her, being teased by her, feeling wanted for something other than his money and power. His mother had warned him that Faith was a gold digger, and while it took one to know one, he\u0027d never believed it. In fact, he\u0027d come to wonder if his father\u0027s money had actually been a sticking point between him and Faith. While she\u0027d never said so aloud, Faith had grown noticeably uncomfortable whenever he talked about the things he wanted to buy her and the places he wanted to take her. As they entered the sports bar with his hand at her lower back, he felt the same pride at being seen with her that he\u0027d felt as a kid. She was beautiful, with a body built for sin, but she was also down to earth and self-effacing. She had a wicked sense of humor and a keen sense of fair play. He found it sexy as hell that she could diagnose and repair any car trouble, had minor plumbing skills, and could put together any home electronics system, regardless of how many cords and connections were required. His best friend in high school had said she would be the perfect girl if only she liked sports. Miguel knew she was perfect even without that interest. They slid into a booth, and ordered some beer and hot wings to start. After the waiter moved away, Miguel leaned back and opened conversation. \"It looked like business is doing well at the shop.\" \"It is. Although the town has grown, it still has that small town mentality. Even after they built the auto mall and the dealerships moved in, most of the residents trust us more. And they send a lot of referrals our way.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised. You\u0027re the best mechanic there is.\" Her eyes sparkled in that way that made him feel like a king. He wanted to give her everything, spoil her to excess, just so he could see her look at him like that every day. \"Thank you.\" \"Are Russell and Jason still there?\" \"Of course. They love it, too. It\u0027s in our blood.\" She thanked the barback who brought their drinks and the young man\u0027s appreciation of her beauty was evident in his returning grin. His expression sobered, however, when he looked at Miguel. Faith laughed. Even over the blaring music he heard it and the sound tightened his chest. \"I see you\u0027re still possessive.\" \"Only with you.\" Her smile faded slowly. \"Don\u0027t waste the energy on me.\" One brow arched. \"Why not?\" \"Because when I\u0027m with you, you\u0027re the only man I see.\" Her words were accompanied by a Mona Lisa smile that left him wondering if there was any truth at all to her words, or if she was teasing him. \"Then maybe I should stick around.\" She took a long pull on her beer, choosing to drink from the bottle rather than use the frosted glass next to it. He found that erotic. Of course, everything about her was erotic to his mind. \"You\u0027d go stir crazy around here,\" she said. \"Probably,\" he agreed, knowing he was addicted to the adrenaline rush inherent in his line of work. The closest he came to relaxing while conscious was when he was with Faith. \"Are either of your brothers married?\" \"Jason came close once, but the gal joined the Coast Guard and he wasn\u0027t willing to leave Rio Penasquitos. Russell has never come close. I\u0027m beginning to doubt he ever will. He\u0027s got commitment avoidance syndrome.\" Miguel picked at the label on his bottle. \"He just hasn\u0027t found the right woman yet.\" \"That\u0027s what my mother says.\" \"I\u0027ve been told I have commitment issues.\" He held her gaze. \"But I was prepared to marry you. Was desperate to, actually. So everyone would know you belonged to me.\" She paled. He pushed forward. As always, he was playing to win. \"You didn\u0027t ask me why I\u0027m here. Aren\u0027t you curious?\" The hot wings arrived at the table. The large round plate was set between them, but neither of them moved to eat. \"Yes,\" Faith said, so quietly that he read her answer on her lips rather than heard it. \"I\u0027m curious.\" \"I recently broke up with someone I\u0027d been seeing for several months. She was pressing for... more. And I couldn\u0027t give it to her. Our last night together wasn\u0027t pretty. She was upset and said some things that weren\u0027t pleasant. But the only thing that stuck with me was her assertion that she was perfect for me. That we were compatible in every way and I was just too fucked up to see it.\" \"Ouch.\" But her eyes were hard, her mouth pursed with jealousy. She may tease him about his possessiveness, but she was equally so. Always had been. It had taken her months to believe he was really interested in her and several more months beyond that to convince her that while he wanted into her pants in the worst way, that wasn\u0027t why he was dating her. Once she\u0027d come to believe that the rich boy with the good looks, Aston Martin, and deftness with a football was really interested in a poor girl who worked a dirty job and was never part of the \"in\" crowd, she\u0027d become a tigress. He was her man and anyone who forgot that was swiftly reminded. He couldn\u0027t wait to see her at a company party, her lithe legs in heels and a champagne flute in her hand. She\u0027d have her arm around his and a look in her eyes that said, Yes, he\u0027s my arm candy. Only I get to taste. \"She was right,\" he said with a dismissive shrug. \"There wasn\u0027t anything wrong with her - aside from the fact she wasn\u0027t you.\" Faith\u0027s eyes were so dilated; the blue of her irises was a mere sliver around the black center. \"Miguel, I...\" Her voice trailed off, as if she didn\u0027t know what to say. \"I came back to prove to myself that being with you couldn\u0027t possibly be the way I remembered.\" Lifting his beer bottle, he dipped the neck toward her in a toast. \"And I was right. It\u0027s better.\" He cursed his inability to read her thoughts. She looked shaken, but not overly pleased about his confession. He reminded himself that she\u0027d dumped him - callously. Maybe being with him long term was something she still didn\u0027t want. Maybe he was just a hot fuck. \"It was always good between us,\" she said finally, pulling herself together and arranging wings on a plate before handing it to him. \"So what happened?\" he asked, detesting the gruffness of his voice that gave too much away. It was time to be honest, but ripping himself open wasn\u0027t how he wanted to manage this. Wiping her hands with a napkin, she looked at him, her features soft and her eyes impossibly sad. \"You were going to Princeton; I wasn\u0027t. I knew a clean break was the only way you would go without me holding you back.\" Miguel froze from the inside out. His hand tightened with white-knuckled force on the bottle. With his gut churning with anger and confusion, he seized the one thing out of the mess of his emotions that mattered to him. \"Did you love me?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-revved-up-dangerous-1/page-4.html","bookId":1920,"book":{"id":1920,"title":"All Revved Up (Dangerous #1)","description":"Storyline: All Revved Up (Dangerous #1) On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, Miguel Santos leaves his high-powered life behind for a visit to the small town he grew up in… and the high school sweetheart whose wild passion he\u0027s never stopped craving.
