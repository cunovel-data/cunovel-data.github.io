How do you want it?\" She was about to reply when two long fingers pushed into her. She bit her lip to hold off an orgasm, fighting not to embarrass herself by showing just how long it had been since a man had touched her sexually. \"So tight, mi hermosa.\" He began to thrust. Easy and slow. Piercing her defenses with consummate skill. \"Should I drill you with my fingers \u0027til you come, then have you return the favor with your mouth? Save the fucking for after dinner?\" \"If we don\u0027t sweeten your temper, mi tesoro,\" she purred back, struggling to hide her roiling emotions, \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be going anywhere with you.\" \"We\u0027ll order in, then.\" His dark gaze was hard. \"You\u0027ll need the energy.\" Faith gripped his muscular ass and climaxed against her will, pleasure rushing through her with a violence that stole her strength. If not for his grip, she would have sunk to the floor in a quivering mess. \"Such a greedy little cunt,\" he muttered hoarsely. \"I\u0027ve never forgotten how it feels around my cock.\" Her body was flushed and misted with perspiration, her pussy still trembling around his embedded fingers. She wondered if she\u0027d survive the night. Miguel knew how to bare her soul in a way no one else could. She let him in so deeply, it sometimes felt as if she couldn\u0027t breathe without his touch, but he was so closed off with hurt and anger she knew she\u0027d never reach him. Not like this. \"Kiss me,\" she ordered, her fingers digging into the rock-hard flesh of his perfect ass. He turned his head so swiftly, he startled her. But when he sealed his mouth over hers, there was no urgency. His tongue licked across the seam of her parted lips, then dipped inside, teasing. His teeth nibbled at the strawberry gloss she knew he loved, his low moan vibrating against her breasts. He ate at her mouth as if he had all the time in the world, as if she was the sweetest delicacy and he couldn\u0027t get enough. Her toes curled. \"Hold on,\" he whispered against her lips, confusing her. Then he ripped her panties off her body, rocking her on her stilettos. The sharp bite of pain as the elastic dug into her hips before breaking only fueled her fierce determination to reach the tender, loving man she once knew. She lifted one leg and anchored it on his hip, but even with three-inch heels, she was too short to take his cock. Miguel gripped the backs of her thighs and hefted her up. Her arms encircled his shoulders, their gazes meeting. His features were stark, his mouth a hard line. His penis throbbed against her, the thick length pressed between the parted folds of her sex. She pushed her fingers into his dark hair, the thick locks feeling like damp silk against her skin. The words she wanted to say burned her throat and tongue, explanations and declarations that would only cause more pain because the end would only be the same. Instead she said the only part of the truth that might help to heal... \"I\u0027m sorry, mi tesoro.\" His eyes glistened for a moment and his throat worked on a hard swallow. \"So am I.\" Setting his jaw, he turned from the entrance, carrying her past the couch and through the open louvered double-doors to the bedroom. Faith didn\u0027t look away as they approached the bed, expecting the room had changed as much as they both had and wanting to remember it as it had been. One of his hands slid up her spine to cradle the back of her head. He lowered her to the mattress as if she was cherished and breakable. Her back settled onto the cool comforter and she released him with reluctance, wishing only to hold him close, to soothe him, to say with her touch and body what she knew better than to say with words. He arranged her for his pleasure, with her hips at the edge of the bed. He stood between her spread legs, a sexual fantasy come to life, exuding dominance and forceful masculinity from every pore. He tossed her skirt out of the way and took his cock in hand. Fisting it once. Twice. Color flagging his cheekbones, a wince betraying how hard he was. She opened wider for him, her thighs falling open, followed shortly by the untying of her dress and the parting of the halves. Arching her back, Faith raised her lace covered breasts to him, remembering how he\u0027d worshipped them in their youth. They were not what they\u0027d been then; her body hadn\u0027t weathered the years as well as his. But it didn\u0027t seem to matter now. A decade slipped away as if it had never come between them at all. Here she was, only hours after his return, offering herself to him with no restraint. Desperate to regain the closeness they\u0027d shared. \"Me vuelves loca,\" he groaned, angling his penis to stroke the thick crown through the lips of her pussy, up and down, nudging her swollen clit with every pass. Faith writhed with need, her chest tight with a yearning she was certain would destroy her when he left again. \"You\u0027re driving me crazy. Don\u0027t tease me, Miguel.\" There was no time for teasing. The hours between now and his departure were too precious to waste. Her stomach knotted at the thought, the urgency of time running away from her filled her with aching fear. How had she lived without this... without him for so long? He watched her face as he rubbed his satiny cockhead against her. \"But you\u0027re so beautiful like this. I\u0027ve dreamt of you just this way.\" \"Stop dreaming,\" she said between clenched teeth. \"Start fucking.\" There was the slightest tease of a smile, which damn near stopped her heart, then he notched the tip of his magnificent cock in the entrance to her body. \"Say it again. Tell me to fuck you.\" Deliberately inciting him, she squeezed her breast is one hand and reached between her legs with the other. She scissored her fingers and gripped his shaft between her knuckles, licking her lips in blatant provocation. \"Hazme el amor.\" Make love to me. He caught his lower lip between even white teeth, his features so austerely sexual she creamed in expectation, bathing him in a fresh rush of moisture. He slid in a fraction deeper and electricity raced across her skin. It had been so long... She\u0027d missed him so much... He filled her with a practiced roll of his hips, stretching her delectably. The familiar feeling of utter surrender swept over her, arching her neck and closing her eyes. \"Miguel.\" \"Christ,\" he hissed, shuddering as he touched the end of her, the lips of her sex hugging the wide root of his cock. \"You\u0027re burning up and so fucking tight. Squeezing me like a fist.\" Her hand moved to his bare hip, her heavy eyelids lifting so she could watch him move. Sex was an art for Miguel. Even as a teenager, hot with hormones and inexhaustible energy, he\u0027d had finesse. Orgasm was a bonus for him; the buildup to getting there was what he really savored. His haste to get inside her, his crudity, told her how hurt he was and how closely he nursed that pain. How determined he was to depersonalize an act that was profoundly intimate for them. She couldn\u0027t blame him for that, not when she was responsible. She\u0027d made a clean break between them with the best of intentions, but regardless, she\u0027d broken both their hearts and while he\u0027d left her with something precious, she\u0027d sent him off with only feelings of betrayal. With his gaze riveted to the place where their bodies joined, Miguel pulled his heavy cock from her in a slow, wet glide. He splayed his hands on her inner thighs, his skin so dark against hers, his grip gentle but unyielding. He held her open as he surged forward, pushing pleasure through her aching body. In a deliciously erotic display of rippling abdominal muscles and powerfully veined biceps, he fucked her with perfect rhythm. He worked her pussy into a blissful relaxed state so that she took him more easily, so that each push and withdrawal became more fluid. Faith moaned, insensate with lust and longing. Her nails, short as they were, left crescents in his skin. \"You\u0027re so big... God, it\u0027s so good...\" \"Oh yeah,\" he purred, watching her with slumberous eyes. \"So damn good.\" He pumped deep and rotated his hips against her, stirring her into a frenzy with his rock-hard length. Her pussy rippled with delight and he growled, grabbing her hips and lifting them into his thrusts. His measured tempo increased, his hips churning and swiveling, his rigid penis shafting her tender pussy with relentless drives. She caught the comforter in her fists, arching into his delicious pounding. Sobbing with pleasure, she spasmed around him, so close to coming again she could taste it. \"Ah, Faith,\" he grated, holding still at the deepest point and grinding her onto him, working her hips in tight circles against his pelvis. He was shoved so deep, he was touching her cervix. His chest and abdomen sheened with sweat. \"You\u0027re making me come.\" Miguel cursed with the first wrenching spurt. Clenching his jaw, he threw his head back and climaxed violently. His fingers dug with bruising force into her hips, cramming her tight against him. She felt every jerk of his cock, every scorching pulse of semen. The ferocity of his pleasure and the primal way he ensured she took every drop pushed her over the edge with him. A mist of sweat bloomed on her skin, the orgasm searing across her nerve endings and blackening her vision. Held rigid in the grip of mind-blowing pleasure, Faith cried out his name in a hoarse broken voice, her pussy milking him in tiny convulsions until he fell across her in a gasping blanket of hot beloved male. Rubbing his sweat-slick forehead against the comforter, Miguel thrust his fingers into Faith\u0027s long hair and groaned as her plush, wet pussy clenched in aftershocks around his spurting cock. The ecstasy sizzling down his spine kept him coming, his balls aching as he emptied them deep inside her. \"Oh god,\" she breathed against his ear. \"I can\u0027t bear it.\" His teeth ground together until his jaw cramped. Without volition, his hips rocked into her, his body mindlessly seeking a way to crawl inside her. To possess her. The sex wasn\u0027t at all the way he remembered it. He used to be able to get out of bed afterward and walk to the bathroom to dispose of the condom... Ay Dios mio... Nuzzling his temple against hers, Miguel waited for the panic to strike and felt only a vicious primitive satisfaction. His cock was bathed in his cum and Faith\u0027s. For the first time in his life he was balls-deep and bareback in a woman, and it was the one woman in the world he could ever imagine having children with. The girl who\u0027d stolen his heart and never given it back. She took family seriously. If he knocked her up, she\u0027d find a way to make it work between them. He could have her and the life he wanted. Ruthless, yes, but then he always was when he wanted something.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-revved-up-dangerous-1/page-3.html","bookId":1920,"book":{"id":1920,"title":"All Revved Up (Dangerous #1)","description":"Storyline: All Revved Up (Dangerous #1) On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, Miguel Santos leaves his high-powered life behind for a visit to the small town he grew up in… and the high school sweetheart whose wild passion he\u0027s never stopped craving.
