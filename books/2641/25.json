{"id":103316,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"The complaint was the answer. To have heard myself making it was to be answered. Lightly men talk of saying what they mean. Often when he was teaching me to write in Greek the Fox would say, \"Child, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that\u0027s the whole art and joy of words.\" A glib saying. When the time comes to you at which you will be forced at last to utter the speech which has lain at the center of your soul for years, which you have, all that time, idiot-like, been saying over and over, you\u0027ll not talk about joy of words. I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?\n \"Best leave the girl to me,\" said a well-known voice. \"I\u0027ll lesson her.\" It was the spectre which had been my father.\n Then a new voice spoke from beneath me. It was the Fox\u0027s. I thought he too was going to give some terrible evidence against me. But he said, \"Oh, Minos, or Rhadamanthus, or Persephone, or by whatever name you are called, I am to blame for most of this, and I should bear the punishment. I taught her, as men teach a parrot, to say, \u0027Lies of poets,\u0027 and\n \u0027Ungit\u0027s a false image.\u0027 I made her think that ended the question. I never said, Too true an image of the demon within. And then the other face of Ungit (she has a thousand) . . .\n something live anyway. And the real gods more alive. Neither they nor Ungit mere thoughts or words. I never told her why the old Priest got something from the dark House that I never got from my trim sentences. She never asked me (I was content she shouldn\u0027t ask) why the people got something from the shapeless stone which no one ever got from that painted doll of Arnom\u0027s. Of course, I didn\u0027t know; but I never told her I didn\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know now. Only that the way to the true gods is more like the house of Ungit . . . oh, it\u0027s unlike too, more unlike than we yet dream, but that\u0027s the easy knowledge, the first lesson; only a fool would stay there, posturing and repeating it. The Priest knew at least that there must be sacrifices. They will have sacrifice - will have man. Yes, and the very heart, center, ground, roots of a man; dark and strong and costly as blood. Send me away, Minos, even to Tartarus, if Tartarus can cure glibness. I made her think that a prattle of maxims would do, all thin and clear as water. For of course water\u0027s good; and it didn\u0027t cost much, not where I grew up. So I fed her on words.\"\n I wanted to cry out that it was false, that he had fed me not on words but on love, that he had given, if not to the gods, yet to me, all that was costliest. But I had not time. The trial, it seemed, was over.\n \"Peace,\" said the judge. \"The woman is a plaintiff, not a prisoner. It is the gods who have been accused. They have answered her. If they in turn accuse her, a greater judge and a more excellent court must try the case. Let her go.\"\n Which way should I turn, set up on that pillar of rock? I looked on every side. Then, to end it, I flung myself down into the black sea of spectres. But before I reached the floor of the cavern one rushed forward and caught me in strong arms. It was the Fox.\n \"Grandfather!\" I cried. \"But you\u0027re real and warm. Homer said one could not embrace the dead . . . they were only shadows.\"\n \"My child, my beloved,\" said the Fox, kissing my eyes and head in the old way. \"One thing that I told you was true. The poets are often wrong. But for all the rest - ah, you\u0027ll forgive me?\"\n \"I to forgive you, Grandfather? No, no, I must speak. I knew at the time that all those good reasons you gave for staying in Glome after you were a freeman were only disguises for your love. I knew you stayed only in pity and love for me. I knew you were breaking your heart for the Greeklands. I ought to have sent you away. I lapped up all you gave me like a thirsty animal. Oh, Grandfather, Ansit\u0027s right. I\u0027ve battened on the lives of men. It\u0027s true. Isn\u0027t it true?\"\n \"Why, child, it is. I could almost be glad; it gives me something to forgive. But I\u0027m not your judge. We must go to your true judges now. I am to bring you there.\"\n \"My judges?\"\n \"Why, yes, child. The gods have been accused by you. Now\u0027s their turn.\"\n \"I cannot hope for mercy.\"\n \"Infinite hopes - and fears - may both be yours. Be sure that, whatever else you get, you will not get justice.\"\n \"Are the gods not just?\"\n \"Oh no, child. What would become of us if they were? But come and see.\"\n He was leading me somewhere and the light was strengthening as we went. It was a greenish, summery light. In the end it was sunshine falling through vine leaves. We were in a cool chamber, walls on three sides of us, but on the fourth side only pillars and arches with a vine growing over them on the outside. Beyond and between the light pillars and the soft leaves I saw level grass and shining water.\n \"We must wait here till you are sent for,\" said the Fox. \"But there is plenty here that\u0027s worth studying.\"\n I now saw that the walls of the place were all painted with stories. We have little skill with painting in Glome, so that it\u0027s small praise to say they seemed wonderful to me. But I think all mortals would have wondered at these.\n \"They begin here,\" said the Fox, taking me by the hand and leading me to part of the wall.\n For an instant I was afraid that he was leading me to a mirror as my father had twice done.\n But before we came near enough to the picture to understand it, the mere beauty of the coloured wall put that out of my head.\n Now we were before it and I could see the story it told. I saw a woman coming to the river bank. I mean that by her painted posture I could see it was a picture of one walking. That at first. But no sooner had I understood this than it became alive, and the ripples of the water were moving and the reeds stirred with the water and the grass stirred with the breeze, and the woman moved on and came to the river\u0027s edge. There she stood and stooped down and seemed to be doing something - I could not at first tell what - with her feet. She was tying her ankles together with her girdle. I looked closer at her. She was not I. She was Psyche.\n I am too old, and I have no time, to begin to write all over again of her beauty. But nothing less would serve, and no words I have would serve even then, to tell you how beautiful she\n was. It was as though I had never seen her before. Or had I forgotten . . . no, I could never have forgotten her beauty, by day or by night, for one heart-beat. But all this was a flash of thought, swallowed up at once in my horror of the thing she had come to that river to do.\n \"Do not do it. Do not do it,\" I cried out, madly, as if she could hear me. Nevertheless she stopped, and untied her ankles and went away. The Fox led me to the next picture. And it too came alive, and there in some dark place, cavern or dungeon, when I looked hard into the murk I could see that what was moving in it was Psyche - Psyche in rags and iron fetters - sorting out the seeds into their proper heaps. But the strangest thing was that I saw in her face no such anguish as I looked for. She was grave, her brow knitted as I have seen it knitted over a hard lesson when she was a child (and that look became her well; what look did not?). Yet I thought there was no despair in it. Then of course I saw why. Ants were helping her. The floor was black with them.\n \"Grandfather,\" said I, \"did - \"\n \"Hush,\" said the Fox, laying his thick old finger (the very feel of that finger again, after so many years!) on my lips. He led me to the next.\n Here we were back in the pasture of the gods. I saw Psyche creeping, cautious as a cat, along the hedgerow; then standing, her finger at her lip, wondering how she could ever get one curl of their golden wool. Yet now again, only more than last time, I marvelled at her face.\n For though she looked puzzled, it was only as if she were puzzled at some game; as she and I had both been puzzled over the game Poobi used to play with her beads. It was even as if she laughed inwardly a little at her own bewilderment. (And that too I\u0027d seen in her before, when she blundered over her tasks as a child; she was never out of patience with herself, no more than with her teacher.) But she did not puzzle long. For the rams scented some intruder and turned their tails to Psyche and all lifted their terrible heads, and then lowered them again for battle, and all charged away together to the other end of the meadow, drawing nearer to each other as they came nearer to their enemy, so that an unbroken wave or wall of gold overwhelmed her. Then Psyche laughed and clapped her hands and gathered her bright harvest off the hedge at ease.\n In the next picture I saw both Psyche and myself, but I was only a shadow. We toiled together over those burning sands, she with her empty bowl, I with the book full of my poison. She did not see me. And though her face was pale with the heat and her lips cracked with thirst, she was no more pitiable than when I have seen her, often, pale with heat and thirsty, come back with the Fox and me from a summer day\u0027s ramble on the old hills. She was merry and in good heart. I believe, from the way her lips moved, she was singing. When she came to the foot of the precipices I vanished away. But the eagle came to her, and took her bowl, and brought it back to her brim-full of the water of death.\n We had now travelled round two of the three walls and the third remained.\n \"Child,\" said the Fox, \"have you understood?\"\n \"But are these pictures true?\"\n \"All here\u0027s true.\"\n \"But how could she - did she really - do such things and go to such places - and not . . . ?\n Grandfather, she was all but unscathed. She was almost happy.\"\n \"Another bore nearly all the anguish.\"\n \"I? Is it possible?\"\n \"That was one of the true things I used to say to you. Don\u0027t you remember? We\u0027re all limbs and parts of one Whole. Hence, of each other. Men, and gods, flow in and out and mingle.\"\n \"Oh, I give thanks. I bless the gods. Then it was really I - \"\n \"Who bore the anguish. But she achieved the tasks. Would you rather have had justice?\"\n \"Would you mock me, Grandfather? Justice? Oh, I\u0027ve been a queen and I know the people\u0027s cry for justice must be heard. But not my cry. A Batta\u0027s muttering, a Redival\u0027s whining: \u0027Why can\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027Why should she?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not fair.\u0027 And over and over. Faugh!\"\n \"That\u0027s well, daughter. But now, be strong and look upon the third wall.\"\n We looked and saw Psyche walking alone in a wide way under the earth - a gentle slope, but downwards, always downwards.\n \"This is the last of the tasks that Ungit has set her. She must - \"\n \"Then there is a real Ungit?\"\n \"All, even Psyche, are born into the house of Ungit. And all must get free from her. Or say that Ungit in each must bear Ungit\u0027s son and die in childbed - or change. And now Psyche must go down into the dead-lands to get beauty in a casket from the Queen of the Deadlands, from death herself; and bring it back to give it to Ungit so that Ungit will become beautiful. But this is the law for her journey. If, for any fear or favour or love or pity, she speaks to anyone on the way, then she will never come back to the sunlit lands again.\n She must keep straight on, in silence, till she stands before the throne of the Queen of Shadows. All\u0027s at stake. Now watch.\"\n He needed not to tell me that. We both watched. Psyche went on and on, deeper into the earth, colder, deeper, darker. But at last there came a chilly light on one side of her way, and there (I think) the great tunnel or gallery in which she journeyed opened out. For there, in that cold light, stood a great crowd of rabble. Their speech and clothes showed me at once that they were people of Glome. I saw the faces of some I knew.\n \"Istra! Princess! Ungit!\" they called out, stretching their hands towards her. \"Stay with us.\n Be our goddess. Rule us. Speak oracles to us. Receive our sacrifices. Be our goddess.\"\n Psyche walked on and never looked at them.\n \"Whoever the enemy is,\" said I, \"he\u0027s not very clever if he thinks she would falter for that.\"\n \"Wait,\" said the Fox.\n Psyche, her eyes fixed straight ahead, went further on and further down, and again, on the left side of her road, there came a light. One figure rose up in it. I was startled at this one, and looked to my side. The Fox was with me still; but he who rose up in the cold light to meet Psyche by the wayside was also the Fox - but older, greyer, paler than the Fox who was with me.\n \"O Psyche, Psyche,\" said the Fox in the picture (say, in that other world; it was no painted thing), \"what folly is this? What are you doing, wandering through a tunnel beneath the earth? What? You think it is the way to the Deadlands? You think the gods have sent you there? All lies of priests and poets, child. It is only a cave or a disused mine. There are no deadlands such as you dream of, and no such gods. Has all my teaching taught you no more than this? The god within you is the god you should obey: reason, calmness, self-discipline.\n Fie, child, do you want to be a barbarian all your days? I would have given you a clear, Greek, full-grown soul. But there\u0027s still time. Come to me and I\u0027ll lead you out of all this darkness; back to the grass plot behind the pear trees, where all was clear, hard, limited, and simple.\"\n But Psyche walked on and never looked at him. And presently she came to a third place where there was a little light on the left of the dark road. Amid that light something like a woman rose up; its face was unknown to me. When I looked at it I felt a pity that nearly killed my heart. It was not weeping, but you could see from its eyes that it had already wept them dry. Despair, humiliation, entreaty, endless reproach - all these were in it. And now I trembled for Psyche. I knew the thing was there only to entrap her and turn her from her path. But did she know it? And if she did, could she, so loving and so full of pity, pass it by?\n It was too hard a test. Her eyes looked straight forward; but of course she had seen it out of the corner of her eye. A quiver ran through her. Her lip twitched, threatened with sobbing.\n She set her teeth in the lip to keep it straight. \"O great gods, defend her,\" I said to myself.\n \"Hurry, hurry her past.\"\n The woman held out her hands to Psyche, and I saw that her left arm dripped with blood.\n Then came her voice, and what a voice it was! So deep, yet so womanlike, so full of passion, it would have moved you even if it spoke happy or careless things. But now (who could resist it?) it would have broken a heart of iron.\n \"Oh Psyche,\" it wailed. \"Oh my own child, my only love. Come back. Come back. Back to the old world where we were happy together. Come back to Maia.\"\n Psyche bit her lip till the blood came and wept bitterly. I thought she felt more grief than that wailing Orual. But that Orual had only to suffer; Psyche had to keep on her way as well.\n She kept on, went on out of sight, journeying always further into death. That was the last of the pictures.\n The Fox and I were alone again.\n \"Did we really do these things to her?\" I asked.\n \"Yes. All here\u0027s true.\"\n \"And we said we loved her.\"\n \"And we did. She had no more dangerous enemies than us. And in that far distant day when the gods become wholly beautiful, or we at last are shown how beautiful they always were, this will happen more and more. For mortals, as you said, will become more and more jealous. And mother and wife and child and friend will all be in league to keep a soul from being united with the Divine Nature.\"\n \"And Psyche, in that old terrible time when I thought her cruel . . . she suffered more than I, perhaps?\"\n \"She bore much for you then. You have borne something for her since.\"\n \"And will the gods one day grow thus beautiful, Grandfather?\"\n \"They say . . . but even I, who am dead, do not yet understand more than a few broken words of their language. Only this I know. This age of ours will one day be the distant past.\n And the Divine Nature can change the past. Nothing is yet in its true form.\"\n But as he said this many voices from without, sweet and to be feared, took up the cry, \"She comes. Our lady returns to her house; the goddess Psyche, back from the lands of the dead, bringing the casket of beauty from the Queen of Shadows.\"\n \"Come,\" said the Fox. I think I had no will in me at all. He took my hand and led me out between the pillars (the vine leaves brushed my hair) into the warm sunlight. We stood in a fair, grassy court, with blue, fresh sky above us; mountain sky. In the center of the court was a bath of clear water in which many could have swum and sported together. Then there was a moving and rustling of invisible people, and more voices (now somewhat hushed). Next moment I was flat on my face; for Psyche had come and I was kissing her feet.\n \"Oh Psyche, oh goddess,\" I said. \"Never again will I call you mine; but all there is of me shall be yours. Alas, you know now what it\u0027s worth. I never wished you well, never had one selfless thought of you. I was a craven\"\n She bent over me to lift me up. Then, when I would not rise, she said, \"But Maia, dear Maia, you must stand up. I have not given you the casket. You know I went a long journey to fetch the beauty that will make Ungit beautiful.\"\n I stood up then; all wet with a kind of tears that do not flow in this country. She stood before me, holding out something for me to take. Now I knew that she was a goddess indeed. Her hands burned me (a painless burning) when they met mine. The air that came from her clothes and limbs and hair was wild and sweet; youth seemed to come into my breast as I breathed it. And yet (this is hard to say) with all this, even because of all this, she was the old Psyche still; a thousand times more her very self than she had been before the Offering. For all that had then but flashed out in a glance or a gesture, all that one meant most when one spoke her name, was now wholly present, not to be gathered up from hints nor in shreds, not some of it in one moment and some in another. Goddess? I had never seen a real woman before.\n \"Did I not tell you, Maia,\" she said, \"that a day was coming when you and I would meet in my house and no cloud between us?\"\n Joy silenced me. And I thought I had now come to the highest, and to the utmost fullness of being which the human soul can contain. But now, what was this? You have seen the torches grow pale when men open the shutters and broad summer morning shines in on the feasting hall? So now. Suddenly, from a strange look in Psyche\u0027s face (I could see she knew something she had not spoken of), or from a glorious and awful deepening of the blue sky above us, or from a deep breath like a sigh uttered all round us by invisible lips, or from a deep, doubtful, quaking and surmise in my own heart, I knew that all this had been only a preparation. Some far greater matter was upon us. The voices spoke again; but not loud this time. They were awed and trembled. \"He is coming,\" they said. \"The god is coming into his house. The god comes to judge Orual.\"\n If Psyche had not held me by the hand I should have sunk down. She had brought me now\n to the very edge of the pool. The air was growing brighter and brighter about us; as if something had set it on fire. Each breath I drew let into me new terror, joy, overpowering sweetness. I was pierced through and through with the arrows of it. I was being unmade. I was no one. But that\u0027s little to say; rather, Psyche herself was, in a manner, no one. I loved her as I would once have thought it impossible to love, would have died any death for her.\n And yet, it was not, not now, she that really counted. Or if she counted (and oh, gloriously she did) it was for another\u0027s sake. The earth and stars and sun, all that was or will be, existed for his sake. And he was coming. The most dreadful, the most beautiful, the only dread and beauty there is, was coming. The pillars on the far side of the pool flushed with his approach. I cast down my eyes.\n Two figures, reflections, their feet to Psyche\u0027s feet and mine, stood head downward in the water. But whose were they? Two Psyches, the one clothed, the other naked? Yes, both Psyches, both beautiful (if that mattered now) beyond all imagining, yet not exactly the same.\n \"You also are Psyche,\" came a great voice. I looked up then, and it\u0027s strange that I dared. But I saw no god, no pillared court. I was in the palace gardens, my foolish book in my hand.\n The vision to the eye had, I think, faded one moment before the oracle to the ear. For the words were still sounding.\n That was four days ago. They found me lying on the grass, and I had no speech for many hours. The old body will not stand many more such seeings; perhaps (but who can tell?) the soul will not need them. I have got the truth out of Arnom; he thinks I am very near my death now. It\u0027s strange he should weep, and my women too. What have I ever done to please them? I ought to have had Daaran here and learned to love him and taught him, if I could, to love them.\n I ended my first book with the words no answer. I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words. Long did I hate you, long did I fear you. I might -\n (I, Arnom, priest of Aphrodite, saved this roll and put it in the temple. From the markingsafter the word might, we think the Queen\u0027s head must have fallen forward on them as shedied and we cannot read them. This book was all written by Queen Orual of Glome, whowas the most wise, just, valiant, fortunate and merciful of all the princes known in ourparts of the world. If any stranger who intends the journey to Greece finds this book lethim take it to Greece with him, for that is what she seems mostly to have desired. ThePriest who comes after me has it in charge to give up the book to any stranger who willtake an oath to bring it into Greece?) \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-25.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: \n This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
