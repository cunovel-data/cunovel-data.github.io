{"id":103301,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I was soon able to go about the house and in the gardens again. I did it in some stealth, for the Fox told the King I was still sick. Otherwise he would have had me off to the Pillar Room to work for him. He often asked, \"Where\u0027s that girl got to? Does she mean to slug abed for the rest of her life? I\u0027ll not feed drones in my hive forever.\" The loss of Psyche had not at all softened him to Redival and me. Rather the opposite. \"To hear him talk,\" said the Fox,\n \"you\u0027d think no father ever loved a child better than he Psyche.\" The gods had taken his darling and left him the dross: the young whore (that was Redival) and the hobgoblin (which was I). But I could guess it all without the Fox\u0027s reports to help me.\n For my own part, I was busily thinking out how I could make my journey to the Tree on the Mountain and gather whatever might remain of Psyche. I had talked lightly enough of doing this and was determined that I would do it, but the difficulties were very great. I had never been taught to ride any beast, so I must go on foot. I knew it would take a man who knew the way about six hours to go from the palace to the Tree. I, a woman, and one who had to find her way, must allow myself eight at the least. And two more for the work I went to do, and, say, six for the journey home. There were sixteen hours in all. It could not be done in one stitch. I must reckon to lie out a night on the Mountain, and must take food (water I should find) and warm clothing. It could not be done till I recovered my full strength.\n And in truth (as I now see) I had the wish to put off my journey as long as I could. Not for any peril or labour it might cost; but because I could see nothing in the whole world for me to do once it was accomplished. As long as this act lay before me, there was, as it were, some barrier between me and the dead desert which the rest of my life must be. Once I had gathered Psyche\u0027s bones, then, it seemed, all that concerned her would be over and done with. Already, even with the great act still ahead, there was flowing in upon me, from the barren years beyond it, a dejection such as I had never conceived. It was not at all like the agonies I had endured before and have endured since. I did not weep nor wring my hands. I was like water put into a bottle and left in a cellar: utterly motionless, never to be drunk, poured out, spilled or shaken. The days were endless. The very shadows seemed nailed to the ground as if the sun no longer moved.\n One day when this deadness was at its worst I came into the house by the little door that leads into a narrow passage between the guards\u0027 quarters and the dairy. I sat down on the threshold, less weary of body (for the gods, not out of mercy, have made me strong) than unable to find a reason for going a step further in any direction or for doing anything at all.\n A fat fly was crawling up the doorpost. I remember thinking that its sluggish crawling, seemingly without aim, was like my life, or even the life of the whole world.\n \"Lady,\" said a voice behind me. I looked up; it was Bardia.\n \"Lady,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll make free with you. I\u0027ve known sorrow too. I have been as you are now; I have sat and felt the hours drawn out to the length of years. What cured me was the wars. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any other cure.\"\n \"But I can\u0027t go to the wars, Bardia,\" said I.\n \"You can, almost,\" he said. \"When you fought me outside the other Princess\u0027s door (peace be on her, the Blessed!) I told you you had a good eye and a good reach. You thought I was saying it to cheer you. Well, so perhaps I was. But it was true too. There\u0027s no one in the quarters, and there are blunt swords. Come in and let me give you a lesson.\"\n \"No,\" said I dully. \"I don\u0027t want to. What would be the use?\"\n \"Use? Try it and see. No one can be sad while they\u0027re using wrist and hand and eye and every muscle of their body. That\u0027s truth, Lady, whether you believe it or not. As well, it would be a hundred shames not to train anyone who has such a gift for the sport as you look like having.\"\n \"No,\" said I. \"Leave me alone. Unless we can use sharps and you would kill me.\"\n \"That\u0027s women\u0027s talk, by your favour. You\u0027d never say that again once you\u0027d seen it done.\n Come. I\u0027ll not leave off till you do.\"\n A big, kindly man, some years older than herself, can usually persuade even a sad and sullen girl. In the end I rose and went in with him.\n \"That shield is too heavy,\" he said. \"Here\u0027s the one for you. Slip it on, thus. And understand from the outset; your shield is a weapon, not a wall. You\u0027re fighting with it every bit as much as your sword. Watch me, now. You see the way I twist my shield - make it flicker like a butterfly. There\u0027d be arrows and spears and sword points flying off it in every direction if we were in a hot engagement. Now: here\u0027s your sword. No, not like that. You want to grip it firm, but light. It\u0027s not a wild animal that\u0027s trying to run away from you. That\u0027s better. Now, your left foot forward. And don\u0027t look at my face, look at my sword. It isn\u0027t my face is going to fight you. And now, I\u0027ll show you a few guards.\"\n He kept me at it for a full half-hour. It was the hardest work I\u0027d ever done, and, while it lasted, one could think of nothing else. I said not long before that work and weakness are comforters. But sweat is the kindest creature of the three - far better than philosophy, as a cure for ill thoughts.\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" said Bardia. \"You shape very well. I\u0027m sure now I can make a swordsman of you. You\u0027ll come again tomorrow? But your dress hampers you. It would be better if you could wear something that came only to your knee.\"\n I was in such a heat that I went across the passage into the dairy and drank a bowl of milk.\n It was the first food or drink that I had really relished ever since the bad times began. While I was in there, one of the other soldiers (I suppose he had had a sight of what we were doing) came into the passage and said something to Bardia. Bardia replied, I couldn\u0027t hear what. Then he spoke louder: \"Why, yes, it\u0027s a pity about her face. But she\u0027s a brave girl and honest. If a man was blind and she weren\u0027t the King\u0027s daughter, she\u0027d make him a good wife.\" And that is the nearest thing to a love-speech that was ever made me.\n I had my lesson with Bardia every day after that. And I knew soon that he had been a good doctor to me. My grief remained, but the numbness was gone and time moved at its right pace again.\n Soon I told Bardia how I wished to go to the Grey Mountain, and why.\n \"That\u0027s very well thought of, Lady,\" he said. \"I\u0027m ashamed I have not done it myself. We all owe the Blessed Princess that much at the least. But there\u0027s no need for you to go. I\u0027ll go for you.\"\n I said I would go.\n \"Then you must go with me,\" he said. \"You\u0027d never find the place by yourself. And you might meet a bear or wolves or a mountainy man, an outlaw, that\u0027d be worse. Can you ride a horse, Lady?\"\n \"No, I\u0027ve never been taught.\"\n He wrinkled up his brow, thinking. \"One horse will do,\" he said, \"I in the saddle and you behind me. And it won\u0027t take six hours getting up; there\u0027s a shorter way. But the work we have to do might take long enough. We\u0027ll need to sleep a night on the mountain.\"\n \"Will the King let you be absent so long, Bardia?\"\n He chuckled. \"Oh, I\u0027ll spin the King a story easily enough. He isn\u0027t with us as he is with you, Lady. For all his hard words he\u0027s no bad master to soldiers, shepherds, huntsmen, and the like. He understands them and they him. You see him at his worst with women and priests and politic men. The truth is, he\u0027s half afraid of them.\" This was very strange to me.\n Six days after that, I and Bardia set out at the milking-time of the morning, the day being so cloudy that it was almost as dark as full night. No one in the palace knew of our going except the Fox and my own women. I had on a plain black cloak with a hood, and a veil over my face. Under the mantle I wore the short smock that I used for my fencing bouts, with a man\u0027s belt and a sword, this time a sharp one, at my side. \"Most likely we\u0027ll meet nothing worse than a wild cat or a fox,\" Bardia had said. \"But no one, man or maid, ought to go weaponless up the hills.\" I sat with both my legs on one side of the horse, and a hand on Bardia\u0027s girdle. With the other, I held on my knees an urn.\n It was all silent in the city, but for the clatter of our own beast\u0027s hoofs, though here and there you would see a light in a window. A sharp rain came on us from behind our backs as we went down from the city to the ford of the Shennit, but it ceased as we were crossing the water, and the clouds began to break. There was still no sign of dawn ahead, for it was in that direction the foul weather was packing off.\n We passed the house of Ungit on our right. Its fashion is thus: great, ancient stones, twice the height of a man and four times the thickness of a man, set upright in an egg-shaped ring. These are very ancient, and no one knows who set them up or brought them into that place, or how. In between the stones it is filled up with brick to make the wall complete. The roof is thatched with rushes and not level but somewhat domed, so that the whole thing is a roundish hump, most like a huge slug lying on the field. This is a holy shape, and the priests say it resembles, or (in a mystery) that it really is, the egg from which the whole world was hatched or the womb in which the whole world once lay. Every spring the Priest is shut into it and fights, or makes believe to fight, his way out through the western door; and this means that the new year is born. There was smoke going up from it as we passed, for the fire before Ungit is always alight.\n I found my mood changed as soon as we had left Ungit behind, partly because we were now going into country I had never known, and partly because I felt as if the air were sweeter as we got away from all that holiness. The Mountain, now bigger ahead of us, still shut out the brightening of the day; but when I looked back and saw, beyond the city, those hills where Psyche and I and the Fox used to wander, I perceived that it was already morning there.\n And further off still, the clouds in the western sky were beginning to turn pale rose.\n We were going up and down little hills, but always more up than down, on a good enough road, with grasslands on each side of us. There were dark woods on our left, and presently\n the road bent towards them. But here Bardia left the road and took to the grass.\n \"That\u0027s the Holy Road,\" he said, pointing to the woods. \"That\u0027s the way they took the Blessed (peace be on her). Our way will be steeper and shorter.\"\n We now went for a long time over grass, gently but steadily upward, making for a ridge so high and so near that the true Mountain was quite out of sight. When we topped it, and stood for a while to let the horse breathe, everything was changed. And my struggle began.\n We had come into the sunlight now, too bright to look into, and warm (I threw back my cloak). Heavy dew made the grass jewel-bright. The Mountain, far greater yet also far further off than I expected, seen with the sun hanging a hand-breadth above its topmost crags, did not look like a solid thing. Between us and it was a vast tumble of valley and hill, woods and cliffs, and more little lakes than I could count. To left and right, and behind us, the whole coloured world with all its hills was heaped up and up to the sky, with, far away, a gleam of what we call the sea (though it is not to be compared with the Great Sea of the Greeks). There was a lark singing; but for that, huge and ancient stillness.\n And my struggle was this. You may well believe that I had set out sad enough; I came on a sad errand. Now, flung at me like frolic or insolence, there came as if it were a voice - no words - but if you made it into words it would be, \"Why should your heart not dance?\" It\u0027s the measure of my folly that my heart almost answered, \"Why not?\" I had to tell myself over like a lesson the infinite reasons it had not to dance. My heart to dance? Mine whose love was taken from me, I, the ugly princess who must never look for other love, the drudge of the King, the jailer of hateful Redival, perhaps to be murdered or turned out as a beggar when my father died - for who knew what Glome would do then? And yet, it was a lesson I could hardly keep in my mind. The sight of the huge world put mad ideas into me, as if I could wander away, wander forever, see strange and beautiful things, one after the other to the world\u0027s end. The freshness and wetness all about me (I had seen nothing but drought and withered things for many months before my sickness) made me feel that I had misjudged the world; it seemed kind, and laughing, as if its heart also danced. Even my ugliness I could not quite believe in. Who can feel ugly when the heart meets delight? It is as if, somewhere inside, within the hideous face and bony limbs, one is soft, fresh, lissom and desirable.\n We had stood on the ridge only for a short time. But for hours later while we went up and down winding among great hills, often dismounting and leading the horse, sometimes on dangerous edges, the struggle went on.\n Was I not right to struggle against this fool-happy mood? Mere seemliness, if nothing else, called for it. I would not go laughing to Psyche\u0027s burial. If I did, how should I ever again believe that I had loved her? Reason called for it. I knew the world too well to believe this sudden smiling. What woman can have patience with the man who can be yet again deceived by his doxy\u0027s fawning after he has thrice proved her false? I should be just like such a man if a mere burst of fair weather, and fresh grass after a long drought, and health after sickness, could make me friends again with this god-haunted, plague-breeding, decaying, tyrannous world. I had seen. I was not a fool. I did not know then, however, as I do now, the strongest reason for distrust. The gods never send us this invitation to delight so readily or so strongly as when they are preparing some new agony. We are their bubbles; they blow us big before they prick us.\n But I held my own without that knowledge. I ruled myself. Did they think I was nothing but a pipe to be played on as their moment\u0027s fancy chose?\n The struggle ended when we topped the last rise before the real Mountain. We were so high now that, though the sun was very strong, the wind blew bitterly cold. At our feet, between us and the Mountain, lay a cursed black valley: dark moss, dark peat-bogs, shingle, great boulders, and screes of stone sprawling down into it from the Mountain - as if the Mountain had sores and these were the stony issue from them. The great mass of it rose up (we tilted our heads back to look at it) into huge knobbles of stone against the sky, like an old giant\u0027s back teeth. The face it showed us was really no steeper than a roof, except for certain frightful cliffs on our left, but it looked as if it went up like a wall. It, too, was now black. Here the gods ceased trying to make me glad. There was nothing here that even the merriest heart could dance for.\n Bardia pointed ahead to our right. There the Mountain fell away in a smooth sweep to a saddle somewhat lower than the ground we stood on, but still with nothing behind it but the sky. Against the sky, on the saddle, stood a single leafless tree.\n We went down into the black valley on our own feet, leading the horse, for the going was bad and stones slipped away from under us until, at the lowest place, we joined the sacred road (it came into the valley through the northern end, away to our left). We were so near now that we did not mount again. A few loops of the road led us up to the saddle and, once more, into the biting wind.\n I was afraid, now that we were almost at the Tree. I can hardly say of what, but I know that to find the bones, or even the body, would have set my fear at rest. I believe I had a senseless child\u0027s fear that she might be neither living nor dead.\n And now we were there. The iron girdle, and the chain that went from it about the gaunt trunk (there was no bark on the Tree) hung there and made a dull noise from time to time as they moved with the wind. There were no bones, nor rags of clothing, nor marks of blood, nor anything else.\n \"How do you read these signs, Bardia?\" said I.\n \"The god\u0027s taken her,\" said he, rather pale and speaking low (he was a god-fearing man).\n \"No natural beast would have licked his plate so clean. There\u0027d be bones. A beast - any but the holy Shadowbrute itself - couldn\u0027t have got the whole body out of the irons. And it would have left the jewels. A man, now - but a man couldn\u0027t have freed her, unless he had tools with him.\"\n I had not thought of our journey\u0027s being so vain, nothing to do, nothing to gather. The emptiness of my life was to begin at once.\n \"We can search about a bit,\" I said, foolishly, for I had no hope of finding anything.\n \"Yes, yes, Lady. We can search about,\" said Bardia. I knew it was only his kindness that spoke.\n And so we did, working round in circles, he one way and I the other, with our eyes on the ground; very cold, one\u0027s cloak flapping till leg and cheek smarted with the blows of it.\n Bardia was ahead of me now, eastward and further across the saddle, when he called out. I had to thrust back the hair that was whipping about my face before I could see him. I rushed to him; half flying, for the west-wind made a sail of my cloak. He showed me what he had found - a ruby.\n \"I never saw her wear such a stone,\" said I.\n \"She did though, Lady. On her last journey. They had put their own holy gear on her. The straps of the sandals were red with rubies.\"\n \"Oh, Bardia! Then somebody - something - carried her thus far.\"\n \"Or maybe carried only the sandals. A jackdaw\u0027d do it.\"\n \"We must go on; further on this line.\"\n \"Carefully, Lady. If we must, I\u0027ll do it. You\u0027d best stay behind.\"\n \"Why, what\u0027s to fear? And anyway, I\u0027ll not stay behind.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know that anyone\u0027s been over the saddle. At the Offering, even the priests come no further than the Tree. We are very near the bad part of the Mountain - I mean the holy part. Beyond the Tree, it\u0027s all gods\u0027 country, they say.\"\n \"Then it is you must stay behind, Bardia. They can\u0027t do worse to me than they\u0027ve done already.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go where you go, Lady. But let\u0027s talk less of them, or not at all. And first, I must go back and get the horse.\"\n He went back (and for a moment out of sight - I stood alone on the edge of the perilous land) to where he had tied the horse to a little stunted bush. Then he rejoined me, leading it, very grave, and we went forward.\n \"Carefully,\" he said again. \"We may find we\u0027re on the top of a cliff any moment.\" And indeed it looked, for the next few paces, as if we were walking straight into the empty sky. Then suddenly we found we were on the brow of a steep slope; and at the same moment the sun\n - which had been overcast ever since we went down into the black valley - leaped out.\n It was like looking down into a new world. At our feet, cradled amid a vast confusion of mountains, lay a small valley bright as a gem, but opening southward on our right. Through that opening there was a glimpse of warm, blue lands, hills and forests, far below us. The valley itself was like a cleft in the Mountain\u0027s southern chin. High though it was, the year seemed to have been kinder in it than down in Glome. I never saw greener turf. There was gorse in bloom, and wild vines, and many groves of flourishing trees, and great plenty of bright water - pools, streams, and little cataracts. And when, after casting about a little to find where the slope would be easiest for the horse, we began descending, the air came up to us warmer and sweeter every minute. We were out of the wind now and could hear ourselves speak; soon we could hear the very chattering of the streams and the sound of bees.\n \"This may well be the secret valley of the god,\" said Bardia, his voice hushed.\n \"It\u0027s secret enough,\" said I.\n Now we were at the bottom, and so warm that I had half a mind to dip my hands and face in the swift, amber water of the stream which still divided us from the main of the valley. I had already lifted my hand to put aside my veil when I heard two voices cry out - one, Bardia\u0027s.\n I looked. A quivering shock of feeling that has no name (but is nearest terror) stabbed through me from head to foot. There, not six feet away, on the far side of the river, stood Psyche. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-9.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: \n This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
