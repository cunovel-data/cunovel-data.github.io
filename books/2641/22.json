{"id":103313,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Not many days have passed since I wrote those words no answer, but I must unroll my book again. It would be better to rewrite it from the beginning, but I think there\u0027s no time for that. Weakness comes on me fast, and Arnom shakes his head and tells me I must rest.\\n\\n They think I don\u0027t know they have sent a message to Daaran.\\n\\n Since I cannot mend the book, I must add to it. To leave it as it was would be to die perjured; I know so much more than I did about the woman who wrote it. What began the change was the very writing itself. Let no one lightly set about such a work. Memory, once waked, will play the tyrant. I found I must set down, (for I was speaking as before judges and must not lie) passions and thoughts of my own which I had clean forgotten. The past which I wrote down was not the past that I thought I had (all these years) been remembering. I did not, even when I had finished the book, see clearly many things that I see now. The change which the writing wrought in me (and of which I did not write) was only a beginning - only to prepare me for the gods\u0027 surgery. They used my own pen to probe my wound.\\n\\n Very early in the writing there came also a stroke from without. While I related my first years, when I wrote how Redival and I built mud houses in the garden, a thousand other things came back into my mind, all about those days when there was no Psyche and no Fox\\n\\n - only I and Redival. Catching tadpoles in the brook, hiding from Batta in the hay, waiting at the door of the hall when our father gave a feast and wheedling titbits out of the slaves as they went in and out. And I thought, how terribly she changed. This, all within my own mind. But then the stroke from without. On top of many other hindrances came word of an embassy from the Great King who lives to the South and East.\\n\\n \"Another plague,\" said I. And when the strangers came (and there must be hours of talk, and a feast for them afterwards) I liked them none the better for finding that their chief man was a eunuch. Eunuchs are very great men at that court. This one was the fattest man I ever saw, so fat his eyes could hardly see over his cheeks, all shining and reeking with oil, and tricked out with as much doll-finery as one of Ungit\u0027s girls. But as he talked and talked I began to think there was a faint likeness in him to someone I had seen long ago. And, as we do, I chased it and gave it up, and chased it and gave it up again, till suddenly, when I least thought of it, the truth started into my mind and I shouted out, \"Tarin!\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes, Queen, oh yes,\" said he, spiteful-pleased (I thought) and leering. \"Oh yes, I was him you called Tarin. Your father did not love me, Queen, did he? But . . . te-hee, te-hee . . .\\n\\n he made my fortune. Oh yes, he set me on the right road. With two cuts of a razor. But for him I should not have been the great man I am now.\"\\n\\n I wished him joy of his advancement.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Queen, thank you. It is very good. And to think . . . te-hee . . . that but for your father\u0027s temper I might have gone on carrying a shield in the guard of a little barbarous king whose whole kingdom could be put into one corner of my master\u0027s hunting park and never be noticed! You will not be angry, no?\"\\n\\n I said I had always heard that the Great King had an admirable park.\\n\\n \"And your sister, Queen?\" said the eunuch. \"Ah, she was a pretty little girl . . . though, te-hee, te-hee, I\u0027ve had finer women through my hands since . . . is she still alive?\"\\n\\n \"She is the Queen of Phars,\" said I.\\n\\n \"Ah, so. Phars. I remember. One forgets the names of all these little countries. Yes . . . a pretty little girl. I took pity on her. She was lonely.\"\\n\\n \"Lonely?\" said I.\\n\\n \"Oh yes, yes, very lonely. After the other princess, the baby, came. She used to say, \u0027First of all Orual loved me much; then the Fox came and she loved me little; then the baby came and she loved me not at all.\u0027 So she was lonely. I was sorry for her . . . te-hee-hee . . . oh, I was a fine young fellow then. Half the girls in Glome were in love with me.\" I led him back to our affairs of state.\\n\\n This was only the first stroke, a light one; the first snowflake of the winter that I was entering, regarded only because it tells us what\u0027s to come. I was by no means sure that Tarin spoke truly. I am sure still that Redival was false and a fool. And for her folly the gods themselves cannot blame me; she had that from her father. But one thing was certain: I had never thought at all how it might be with her when I turned first to the Fox and then to Psyche. For it had been somehow settled in my mind from the very beginning that I was the pitiable and ill-used one. She had her gold curls, hadn\u0027t she?\\n\\n So back to my writing. And the continual labour of mind to which it put me began to overflow into my sleep. It was a labour of sifting and sorting, separating motive from motive and both from pretext; and this same sorting went on every night in my dreams, but in a changed fashion. I thought I had before me a huge, hopeless pile of seeds, wheat, barley, poppy, rye, millet, what not? and I must sort them out and make separate piles, each all of one kind. Why I must do it, I did not know; but infinite punishment would fall upon me if I rested a moment from my labour or if, when all was done, a single seed were in the wrong pile. In waking life a man would know the task impossible. The torment of the dream was that, there, it could conceivably be done. There was one chance in ten thousand of finishing the labour in time, and one in a hundred thousand of making no mistake. It was all but certain I should fail, and be punished - but not certain. And so to it: searching, peering, picking up each seed between finger and thumb. Yet not always finger and thumb. For in some dreams, more madly still, I became a little ant, and the seeds were as big as millstones; and labouring with all my might, till my six legs cracked, I carried them to their places - holding them in front of me as ants do, loads bigger than myself.\\n\\n One thing that shows how wholly the gods kept me to my two labours, the day\u0027s and the night\u0027s, is that all this time I hardly gave Bardia a thought, save to grumble at his absence because it meant that I was more hindered in my writing. While the rage of it lasted nothing seemed to matter a straw except finishing my book. Of Bardia I only said (once and again),\\n\\n \"Does he mean to slug abed for the rest of his life?\" or, \"It\u0027s that wife of his.\"\\n\\n Then there came a day when that last line of the book (they have no answer) was still wet, and I found myself listening to Arnom and understanding, as if for the first time, what his looks and voice meant. \"Do you mean,\" I cried, \"that the Lord Bardia is in danger?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s very weak, Queen,\" said the priest. \"I wish the Fox were with us. We are bunglers, we of Glome. It seems to me that Bardia has no strength or spirit to fight the sickness.\"\\n\\n \"Good gods,\" said I, \"why did you not make me understand this before? Ho! Slave! My horse. I will go and see him.\"\\n\\n Arnom was an old and trusted counsellor now. He laid his hand on my arm. \"Queen,\" he said gently and very gravely, \"it would make him the less likely to recover if you now went to him.\"\\n\\n \"Do I carry such an infection about me?\" said I. \"Is there death in my aspect, even through a veil?\"\\n\\n \"Bardia is your most loyal and most loving subject,\" said Arnom. \"To see you would call up all his powers - perhaps crack them. He\u0027d rouse himself to his duty and courtesy. A hundred affairs of state on which he meant to speak to you would crowd into his mind. He\u0027d rack his brains to remember things he has forgotten for these last nine days. It might kill him. Leave him to drowse and dream. It\u0027s his best chance now.\"\\n\\n It was as bitter a truth as I\u0027d ever tasted, but I drank it. Would I not have crouched silent in my own dungeons as long as Arnom bade me if it would add one featherweight to Bardia\u0027s chance of life? Three days I bore it (I, the old fool, with hanging dugs and shrivelled flanks).\\n\\n On the fourth I said, \"I can bear it no longer.\" On the fifth Arnom came to me, himself weeping, and I knew his tidings without words. And this is a strange folly, that what seemed to me worst of all was that Bardia had died without ever hearing what it would have shamed him to hear. It seemed to me that all would be bearable if, once only, I could have gone to him and whispered in his ear, \"Bardia, I loved you.\"\\n\\n When they laid him on the pyre I could only stand by to honour him. Because I was neither his wife nor kin, I might not wail nor beat the breast for him. Ah, if I could have beaten the breast, I would have put on steel gloves or hedgehog skins to do it.\\n\\n I waited three days, as the custom is, and then went to comfort (so they call it) his widow. It was not only duty and usage that drove me. Because he had loved her she was, in a way, surely enough the enemy; yet who else in the whole world could now talk to me?\\n\\n They brought me into the upper room in her house where she sat at her spinning - very pale, but very calm. Calmer than I. Once I had been surprised that she was so much less beautiful than report had made her. Now, in her later years, she had won a new kind of beauty; it was a proud, still sort of face.\\n\\n \"Lady - Ansit,\" I said, taking both her hands (she had not time to get them away from me),\\n\\n \"what shall I say to you? How can I speak of him and not say that your loss is indeed without measure? And that\u0027s no comfort. Unless you can think even now that it is better to have had and lost such a husband than to enjoy any man else in the world forever.\"\\n\\n \"The Queen does me great honour,\" said Ansit, pulling her hands out of mine so as to stand with them crossed on her breast, her eyes cast down, in the court fashion.\\n\\n \"Oh, dear Lady, un-queen me a little, I beseech you. Is it as if you and I had never met till yesterday? After yours (never think I\u0027d compare them) my loss is greatest. I pray you, your seat again. And your distaff. We shall talk better to that movement. And you will let me sit here beside you?\"\\n\\n She sat down and resumed her spinning; her face at rest and her lips a little pursed, very housewifely. She would give me no help.\\n\\n \"It was very unlooked for,\" said I. \"Did you at first see any danger in this sickness?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Did you so? To me Arnom said it ought to have been a light matter.\"\\n\\n \"He said that to me, Queen. He said it would be a light matter for a man who had all his strength to fight it.\"\\n\\n \"Strength? But the Lord Bardia was a strong man.\"\\n\\n \"Yes - as a tree that is eaten away within.\"\\n\\n \"Eaten away? And with what? I never knew this.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose not, Queen. He was tired. He had worked himself out - or been worked. Ten years ago he should have given over and lived as old men do. He was not made of iron or brass, but flesh.\"\\n\\n \"He never looked nor spoke like an old man.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you never saw him, Queen, at the times when a man shows his weariness. You never saw his haggard face in early morning. Nor heard his groan when you (because you had sworn to do it) must shake him and force him to rise. You never saw him come home late from the palace, hungry, yet too tired to eat. How should you, Queen? I was only his wife. He was too well-mannered, you know, to nod and yawn in a Queen\u0027s house.\"\\n\\n \"You mean that his work - ?\"\\n\\n \"Five wars, thirty-one battles, nineteen embassies, taking thought for this and thought for that, speaking a word in one ear, and another, and another, soothing this man and scaring that and flattering a third, devising, consulting, remembering, guessing, forecasting . . . and the Pillar Room and the Pillar Room. The mines are not the only place where a man can be worked to death.\"\\n\\n This was worse than the worst I had looked for. A flash of anger passed through me, then a horror of misgiving; could it (but that was fantastical) be true? But the misery of that mere suspicion made my own voice almost humble.\\n\\n \"You speak in your sorrow, Lady. But (forgive me) this is mere fantasy. I never spared myself more than him. Do you tell me a strong man\u0027d break under the burden a woman\u0027s bearing still?\"\\n\\n \"Who that knows men would doubt it? They\u0027re harder, but we\u0027re tougher. They do not live longer than we. They do not weather a sickness better. Men are brittle. And you, Queen, were the younger.\"\\n\\n My heart shrivelled up cold and abject within me. \"If this is true,\" said I, \"I\u0027ve been deceived. If he had dropped but a word of it, I\u0027d have taken every burden from him, sent him home forever, loaded with every honour I could give.\"\\n\\n \"You know him little, Queen, if you think he\u0027d ever have spoken that word. Oh, you have been a fortunate queen; no prince ever had more loving servants.\"\\n\\n \"I know I have had loving servants. Do you grudge me that? Even now, in your grief, will your heart serve you to grudge me that? Do you mock me because that is the only sort of love I ever had or could have? No husband; no child. And you - you who have had all - \"\\n\\n \"All you left me, Queen.\"\\n\\n \"Left you, fool? What mad thought is in your mind?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I know well enough that you were not lovers. You left me that. The divine blood will not mix with subjects\u0027, they say. You left me my share. When you had used him, you would let him steal home to me; until you needed him again. After weeks and months at the wars - you and he night and day together, sharing the councils, the dangers, the victories, the soldiers\u0027 bread, the very jokes - he could come back to me, each time a little thinner and greyer and with a few more scars, and fall asleep before his supper was down, and cry out in his dream, \u0027Quick, on the right there. The Queen\u0027s in danger.\u0027 And next morning - the Queen\u0027s a wonderful early riser in Glome - the Pillar Room again. I\u0027ll not deny it; I had what you left of him.\"\\n\\n Her look and voice now were such as no woman could mistake.\\n\\n \"What?\" I cried. \"Is it possible you\u0027re jealous?\"\\n\\n She said nothing.\\n\\n I sprang to my feet and pulled aside my veil. \"Look, look, you fool!\" I cried. \"Are you jealous of this?\"\\n\\n She started back from me, gazing, so that for a moment I wondered if my face were a terror to her. But it was not fear that moved her. For the first time that prim mouth of hers twitched. The tears began to gather in her eyes. \"Oh,\" she gasped, \"Oh. I never knew you also . . . ?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You loved him. You\u0027ve suffered, too. We both . . .\\n\\n She was weeping; and I. Next moment we were in each other\u0027s arms. It was the strangest thing that our hatred should die out at the very moment she first knew her husband was the man I loved. It would have been far otherwise if he were still alive; but on that desolate island (our blank, un-Bardia\u0027d life) we were the only two castaways. We spoke a language, so to call it, which no one else in the huge heedless world could understand. Yet it was a language only of sobs. We could not even begin to speak of him in words; that would have unsheathed both daggers at once.\\n\\n The softness did not last. I have seen something like this happen in a battle. A man was coming at me, I at him, to kill. Then came a sudden great gust of wind that wrapped our cloaks over our swords and almost over our eyes, so that we could do nothing to one another but must fight the wind itself. And that ridiculous contention, so foreign to the business we were on, set us both laughing, face to face - friends for a moment - and then at once enemies again and forever. So here.\\n\\n Presently (I have no memory how it came about) we were apart again; I now resuming my veil, her face hard and cold.\\n\\n \"Well!\" I was saying. \"You have made me little better than the Lord Bardia\u0027s murderer. It was your aim to torture me. And you chose your torture well. Be content; you are avenged.\\n\\n But tell me this. Did you speak only to wound, or did you believe what you said?\"\\n\\n \"Believe? I do not believe, I know, that your queen-ship drank up his blood year by year and ate out his life.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you not tell me? A word from you would have sufficed. Or are you like the gods who will speak only when it is too late?\"\\n\\n \"Tell you?\" she said, looking at me with a sort of proud wonder. \"Tell you? And so take away from him his work, which was his life (for what\u0027s any woman to a man and a soldier in the end?) and all his glory and his great deeds? Make a child and a dotard of him? Keep him to myself at that cost? Make him so mine that he was no longer his?\"\\n\\n \"And yet - he would have been yours.\"\\n\\n \"But I would be his. I was his wife, not his doxy. He was my husband, not my house-dog. He was to live the life he thought best and fittest for a great man - not that which would most pleasure me. You have taken Ilerdia now too. He will turn his back on his mother\u0027s house more and more; he will seek strange lands, and be occupied with matters I don\u0027t understand, and go where I can\u0027t follow, and be daily less mine - more his own and the world\u0027s. Do you think I\u0027d lift up my little finger if lifting it would stop it?\"\\n\\n \"And you could - and you can - bear that?\"\\n\\n \"You ask that? Oh, Queen Orual, I begin to think you know nothing of love. Or no; I\u0027ll not say that. Yours is Queen\u0027s love, not commoners\u0027. Perhaps you who spring from the gods love like the gods. Like the Shadowbrute. They say the loving and the devouring are all one, don\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"Woman,\" said I, \"I saved his life. Thankless fool! You\u0027d have been widowed many a year sooner if I\u0027d not been there one day on the field of Ingarn - and got that wound which still aches at every change of weather. Where are your scars?\"\\n\\n \"Where a woman\u0027s are when she has borne eight children. Yes. Saved his life. Why, you had use for it. Thrift, Queen Orual. Too good a sword to throw away. Faugh! You\u0027re full fed.\\n\\n Gorged with other men\u0027s lives, women\u0027s too: Bardia\u0027s, mine, the Fox\u0027s, your sister\u0027s - both your sisters\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s enough,\" I cried. The air in her room was shot with crimson. It came horribly in my mind that if I ordered her to torture and death no one could save her. Arnom would murmur. Ilerdia would turn rebel. But she\u0027d be twisting (cockchafer-like) on a sharp stake before anyone could help her.\\n\\n Something (if it was the gods, I bless their name) made me unable to do this. I got somehow to the door. Then I turned and said to her,\\n\\n \"If you had spoken thus to my father, he\u0027d have had your tongue cut out.\"\\n\\n \"What? Afraid of it?\" said she.\\n\\n As I rode homeward I said to myself, \"She shall have her Ilerdia back. He can go and live on\\n\\n his lands. Turn oaf. Grow fat and mumble between his belches about the price of bullocks. I would have made him a great man. Now he shall be nothing. He may thank his mother.\\n\\n She\u0027ll not have need to say again that I devour her men-folk.\"\\n\\n But I did none of these things to Ilerdia.\\n\\n And now those divine Surgeons had me tied down and were at work. My anger protected me only for a short time; anger wearies itself out and truth comes in. For it was all true - truer than Ansit could know. I had rejoiced when there was a press of work, had heaped up needless work to keep him late at the palace, plied him with questions for the mere pleasure of hearing his voice. Anything to put off the moment when he would go and leave me to my emptiness. And I had hated him for going. Punished him too. Men have a hundred ways of mocking a man who\u0027s thought to love his wife too well, and Bardia was defenceless; everyone knew he\u0027d married an undowered girl, and Ansit boasted that she\u0027d no need (like most) to seek out the ugliest girls in the slave-market for her household. I never mocked him myself; but I had endless sleights and contrivances (behind my veil) for pushing the talk in such directions as, I knew, would make others mock him. I hated them for doing it, but I had a bittersweet pleasure at his clouded face. Did I hate him, then? Indeed, I believe so. A love like that can grow to be nine-tenths hatred and still call itself love. One thing\u0027s certain; in my mad midnight fantasies (Ansit dead, or, better still, proved whore, witch, or traitress) when he was at last to be seeking my love, I always had him begin by imploring my forgiveness. Sometimes he had hard work to get it. I would bring him within an ace of killing himself first.\\n\\n But the result, when all those bitter hours were over, was a strange one. The craving for Bardia was ended. No one will believe this who has not lived long and looked hard, so that he knows how suddenly a passion which has for years been wrapped round the whole heart will dry up and wither. Perhaps in the soul, as in the soil, those growths that show the brightest colours and put forth the most overpowering smell have not always the deepest root. Or perhaps it\u0027s age that does it. But most of all, I think, it was this. My love for Bardia (not Bardia himself) had become to me a sickening thing. I had been dragged up and out onto such heights and precipices of truth, that I came into an air where it could not live. It stank; a gnawing greed for one to whom I could give nothing, of whom I craved all. Heaven knows how we had tormented him, Ansit and I. For it needs no Oedipus to guess that, many and many a night, her jealousy of me had welcomed him home, late from the palace, to a bitter hearth.\\n\\n But when the craving went, nearly all that I called myself went with it. It was as if my whole soul had been one tooth and now that tooth was drawn. I was a gap. And now I thought I had come to the very bottom and that the gods could tell me no worse. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-22.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
