{"id":103304,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Bardia, a grey shape in the twilight, came towards me. \"You have left the Blessed?\" he said. \"Yes,\" said I. I could not talk to him about it, I thought. \"Then we must speak of how to spend our night. We\u0027d never find a way for the horse up to the saddle now, and if we did, we\u0027d have to go down again beyond the Tree into the other valley. We couldn\u0027t sleep on the saddle itself - too much wind. It\u0027ll be cold enough here, where we\u0027re sheltered, in an hour or so. I fear we must lie here. Not where a man\u0027d choose; too near the gods.\" \"What does it matter?\" said I. \"It will do as well as anywhere else.\" \"Then come with me, Lady. I\u0027ve gathered a few sticks.\" I followed him; and in that silence (there was nothing now but the chattering of the stream, and it seemed louder than ever) we could hear, long before we came to the horse, the sound of the grass torn up by his teeth. A man and a soldier is a wonderful creature. Bardia had chosen a place where the bank was steepest, and two rocks close together made the next best thing to a cave. The sticks were all laid and the fire alight, though still sputtering from the late rain. And he brought out of the saddle-bags things better than bread and onions; even a flask of wine. I was still a girl (which in many matters is the same thing as a fool) and it seemed to me shameful that, in all my sorrow and care, I was so eager for the food when it came. I never tasted better. And that meal in the firelight (which had made all the rest of the world a mere darkness as soon as it blazed up) seemed to me very sweet and homelike; mortal food and warmth for mortal limbs and bellies, no need (for a space) to think of gods and riddles and wonders. When we had ended Bardia said, somewhat shamefacedly, \"Lady, you\u0027re not used to lying in the open and you might be cruelly chilled before day. So I\u0027ll make so free - for I\u0027m no more to you, Lady, than one of your father\u0027s big dogs - as to say we\u0027d best lie close, back to back, the way men do in the wars. And both cloaks over us.\" I said yes to that, and indeed no woman in the world has so little reason as I to be chary in such matters. Yet it surprised me that he should have said it; for I did not yet know that, if you are ugly enough, all men (unless they hate you deeply) soon give up thinking of you as a woman at all. Bardia rested as soldiers do; dead asleep in two breaths but ready (I have seen him tested since) to be wide awake in one if need were. I think I never slept at all. First there was the hardness and slope of the ground, and after that the cold. And besides these, fast and whirling thoughts, wakeful as a madman\u0027s: about Psyche and my hard riddle, and also of another thing. At last the cold grew so bitter that I slipped from under the cloak (its outer side was wet with dew by now) and began walking to and fro. And now, let that wise Greek whom I look to as my reader and the judge of my cause, mark well what followed. It was already twilight and there was much mist in the valley. The pools of the river as I went down to it to drink (for I was thirsty as well as cold) seemed to be dark holes in the greyness. And I got my drink, ice-cold, and I thought it steadied my mind. But would a river flowing in the gods\u0027 secret valley do that, or the clean contrary? This is another of the things to be guessed. For when I lifted my head and looked once more into the mist across the water, I saw that which brought my heart into my throat. There stood the palace, grey - as all things were grey in that hour and place - but solid and motionless, wall within wall, pillar and arch and architrave, acres of it, a labyrinthine beauty. As she had said, it was like no house ever seen in our land or age. Pinnacles and buttresses leaped up - no memories of mine, you would think, could help me to imagine them - unbelievably tall and slender, pointed and prickly as if stone were shooting out into branch and flower. No light showed from any window. It was a house asleep. And somewhere within it, asleep also, someone or something - how holy, or horrible, or beautiful or strange? - with Psyche in its arms. And I, what had I done and said? what would it do to me for my blasphemies and unbelievings? I never doubted that I must now cross the river, or try to cross it, even if it should drown me. I must lie on the steps at the great gate of that house and make my petition. I must ask forgiveness of Psyche as well as of the god. I had dared to scold her (dared, what was worse, to try to comfort her as a child) but all the time she was far above me; herself now hardly mortal. . . . if what I saw was real. I was in great fear. Perhaps it was not real. I looked and looked to see if it would not fade or change. Then as I rose (for all this time I was still kneeling where I had drunk), almost before I stood on my feet, the whole thing was vanished. There was a tiny space of time in which I thought I could see how some swirlings of the mist had looked, for the moment, like towers and walls. But very soon, no likeness at all. I was staring simply into fog, and my eyes smarting with it. And now, you who read, give judgement. That moment when I either saw or thought I saw the House - does it tell against the gods or against me? Would they (if they answered) make it a part of their defence? say it was a sign, a hint, beckoning me to answer the riddle one way rather than the other? I\u0027ll not grant them that. What is the use of a sign which is itself only another riddle? It might - I\u0027ll allow so much - it might have been a true seeing; the cloud over my mortal eyes may have been lifted for a moment. It might not; what would be easier than for one distraught and not, maybe, so fully waking as she seemed, gazing at a mist, in a half-light, to fancy what had filled her thoughts for so many hours? What easier, even, than for the gods themselves to send the whole ferly for a mockery? Either way, there\u0027s divine mockery in it. They set the riddle and then allow a seeming that can\u0027t be tested and can only quicken and thicken the tormenting whirlpool of your guess-work. If they had an honest intention to guide us, why is their guidance not plain? Psyche could speak plain when she was three; do you tell me the gods have not yet come so far? When I came back to Bardia he was just awake. I did not tell him what I had seen; until I wrote it in this book, I have never told it to anyone. Our journey down was comfortless, for there was no sun and the wind was always in our faces, with scudding showers at times. I, sitting behind Bardia, got less of it than he. We halted somewhere about noon, under the lee of a small wood, to eat what was left of our food. Of course my riddle had been working in my mind all morning, and it was there, out of the wind for a little and somewhat warmer (was Psyche warm? and worse weather soon to come) that I made up my mind to tell him the whole story; always excepting that moment when I looked into the mist. I knew he was an honest man, and secret, and (in his own way) wise. He listened to it all very diligently but said nothing when I had ended. I had to draw his answer out of him. \"How do you read it all, Bardia?\" \"Lady,\" says he, \"it\u0027s not my way to say more than I can help of gods and divine matters. I\u0027m not impious. I wouldn\u0027t eat with my left hand, or lie with my wife when the moon\u0027s full, or slit open a pigeon to clean it with an iron knife, or do anything else that\u0027s unchancy and profane, even if the King himself were to bid me. And as for sacrifices, I\u0027ve always done all that can be expected of a man on my pay. But for anything more - I think the less Bardia meddles with the gods, the less they\u0027ll meddle with Bardia.\" But I was determined to have his counsel. \"Bardia,\" I said, \"do you think my sister is mad?\". \"Look, Lady,\" he answered, \"there at your very first word you say what\u0027s better unsaid. Mad? The Blessed - mad? Moreover, we\u0027ve seen her and anyone could tell she was in her right mind.\" \"Then you think there really was a palace in the valley though I couldn\u0027t see it?\" \"I don\u0027t well know what\u0027s really, when it comes to houses of gods.\" \"And what of this lover who comes to her in the dark?\" \"I say nothing about him.\" \"Oh, Bardia - and among the spears men say you\u0027re the bravest! Are you afraid even to whisper your thought to me? I am in desperate need of counsel.\" \"Counsel about what, Lady? What is there to do?\" \"How do you read this riddle? Does anyone really come to her?\" \"She says so, Lady. Who am I to give the Blessed One the lie?\" \"Who is he?\" \"She knows that best.\" \"She knows nothing. She confesses she has never seen him. Bardia, what kind of a lover must this be who forbids his bride to see his face?\" Bardia was silent. He had a pebble between his thumb and forefinger and was drawing little scratches in the earth. \"Well?\" said I. \"There doesn\u0027t seem to be much of a riddle about it,\" he said at last. \"Then what\u0027s your answer?\" \"I should say - speaking as mortal man, and likely enough the gods know better - I should say it was one whose face and form would give her little pleasure if she saw them.\" \"Some frightful thing?\" \"They called her the Bride of the Brute, Lady. But it\u0027s time we were riding again. We\u0027re not much better than half way home.\" He got up as he spoke. His thought was not new to me; it was only the most horrible of the guesses which had been jostling and wrangling in my head. But the shock of hearing it from his lips lay in this, that I knew he had no doubt of it. I had come to know Bardia very well by now, and I could clearly see that all my difficulty in drawing out his answer came from his fear to say the thing and not from any uncertainty. As he had said, my riddle was no riddle to him. And it was as though all the people of Glome had spoken to me through him. As he thought, so, doubtless, every prudent, god-fearing man of our nation and our time would think too. My other guesses would not even come into their minds; here was the plain answer, clear as noon-day. Why seek further? The god and the Shadowbrute were all one. She had been given to it. We had got our rain and water and (as seemed likely) peace with Phars. The gods, for their share, had her away into their secret places where something, so foul it would not show itself, some holy and sickening thing, ghostly or demonlike or bestial - or all three (there\u0027s no telling, with gods) - enjoyed her at its will. I was so dashed that, as we continued our journey, nothing in me even fought against this answer of Bardia\u0027s. I felt as, I suppose, a tortured prisoner feels when they dash water in his face to rouse him from his faint, and the truth, worse than all his fantasies, becomes clear and hard and unmistakable again around him. It now seemed to me that all my other guesses had been only self-pleasing dreams spun out of my wishes, but now I was awake. There never had been any riddle; the worst was the truth, and truth as plain as the nose on a man\u0027s face. Only terror would have blinded me to it so long. My hand stole to the sword-hilt under my cloak. Before my sickness, I had sworn that, if there were no other way, I would have killed Psyche rather than leave her to the heat or hunger of a monster. Now again I made a deep resolve. I was half frightened when I perceived what I was resolving. \"So it might come even to that,\" my heart said; even to killing her (Bardia had already taught me the straight thrust, and where to strike). Then my tenderness came over me again, and I cried, never more bitterly, till I could not tell whether it was tears or rain that had most drenched my veil. (It was settling down to steadier rain as the day went on.) And in that tenderness I even asked myself why I should save her from the Brute, or warn her against the Brute, or meddle with the matter at all. \"She is happy,\" said my heart. \"Whether it\u0027s madness or a god or a monster, or whatever it is, she is happy. You have seen that for yourself. She is ten times happier, there in the Mountain, than you could ever make her. Leave her alone. Don\u0027t spoil it. Don\u0027t mar what you\u0027ve learnt you can\u0027t make.\" We were down in the foothills now, almost (if one could have seen through the rain) in sight of the house of Ungit. My heart did not conquer me. I perceived now that there is a love deeper than theirs who seek only the happiness of their beloved. Would a father see his daughter happy as a whore? Would a woman see her lover happy as a coward? My hand went back to the sword. \"She shall not,\" I thought. Come what might, she should not. However things might go, whatever the price, by her death or mine or a thousand deaths, by fronting the gods \"beard to beard\" as the soldiers say, Psyche should not - least of all, contentedly - make sport for a demon. \"We are king\u0027s daughters still,\" I said. I had hardly said it when I had good cause to remember, in a different fashion, that I was a king\u0027s daughter, and what king\u0027s. For now we were fording the Shennit again and Bardia (whose mind was ever on next things) was saying that when we had passed the city, and before we had reached the palace, I had best slip off the horse and go up that little lane - where Redival first saw Psyche being worshipped - and so through the gardens and into the women\u0027s quarters by the back way. For it was easy to guess how my father would take it if he found that I (supposed too sick to work with him in the Pillar Room) had journeyed to the Holy Tree.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-12.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
