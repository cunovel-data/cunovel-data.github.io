{"id":103312,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"The thing for whose sake I tell this journey happened at the very end of it, and even when I had thought it was finished. We had gone first into Phars, where they harvest later than we, so that it was like having that piece of the year twice over; we found what we had just left at home - the sound of the whetting, the singing of the reapers, the flats of stubble widening and the squares of standing corn diminishing, the piled wagons in the lanes, all the sweat and sunburn and merriment. We had lain ten nights or more in Trunia\u0027s palace, where I was astonished to see how Redival had grown fat and lost her beauty. She talked, as of old, everlastingly, but all about her children, and asked after no one in Glome except Batta.\\n\\n Trunia never listened to a word she said, but he and I had much talk together. I had already settled with my council that his second son, Daaran, was to be King of Glome after my day.\\n\\n This Daaran was (for the son of so silly a mother) a right-minded boy. I could have loved him if I had let myself and if Redival had been out of the way. But I would never give my heart again to any young creature.\\n\\n Out of Phars we had turned westward into Essur by deep passes through the mountains.\\n\\n This was a country of forests greater than I had yet seen and rushing rivers, with great plenty of birds, deer, and other game. The people I had with me were all young and took great pleasure in their travels, and the journey itself had by now linked us all together - all burned brown, and with a world of hopes, cares, jests, and knowledge, all sprung up since we left home, and shared among us. At first they had been in awe of me and had ridden in silence; now we were good friends. My own heart lifted. The eagles wheeled above us and the waterfalls roared.\\n\\n From the mountains we came down into Essur and lay three nights in the King\u0027s house. He was, I think, not a bad sort of man, but too slavish-courteous to me; for Glome and Phars in alliance had made Essur change her tune. His queen was manifestly terrified by my veil and by the stories she had heard of me. And from that house I had meant to turn homewards, but we were told of a natural hot spring fifteen miles further to the west. I knew Ilerdia longed to see it, and I thought (between sadness and smiling) how the Fox would have scolded me if I had been so near any curious work of nature and not examined it. So I said we would go the day\u0027s journey further and turn then.\\n\\n It was the calmest day - pure autumn - very hot, yet the sunlight on the stubble looked aged and gentle, not fierce like the summer heats. You would think the year was resting, its work done. And I whispered to myself that I too would begin to rest. When I was back at Glome I would no longer pile task on task. I would let Bardia rest too (I had often thought he had begun to look tired) and we would let younger heads be busy, while we sat in the sun and talked of our old battles. What more was there for me to do? Why should I not be at peace? I thought this was the wisdom of old age beginning.\\n\\n The hot spring (like all such rarities) was only food for stupid wonder. When we had seen it we went further down the warm, green valley in which it rose and found a good camping place between a stream and a wood. While my people were busied with the tents and the horses, I went a little way into the wood and sat there in the coolness. Before long I heard the ringing of a temple bell (all temples, nearly, have bells in Essur) from somewhere behind me. Thinking it would be pleasant to walk a little after so many hours on horseback, I rose and went slowly through the trees to find the temple, very idly, not caring whether I found it or not. But in a few minutes I came out into a mossy place free of trees, and there it was; no bigger than a peasant\u0027s hut but built of pure white stone, with fluted pillars in the Greek style. Behind it I could see a small thatched house where, no doubt, the priest lived.\\n\\n The place itself was quiet enough, but inside the temple there was a far deeper silence and it was very cool. It was clean and empty and there were none of the common temple smells about it, so that I thought it must belong to one of those small peaceful gods who are content with flowers and fruit for sacrifice. Then I saw it must be a goddess, for there was on the altar the image of a woman about two feet high carved in wood, not badly done and all the fairer (to my mind) because there was no painting or gilding but only the natural pale colour of the wood. The thing that marred it was a band or scarf of some black stuff tied round the head of the image so as to hide its face - much like my own veil, but that mine was white.\\n\\n I thought how much better all this was than the house of Ungit, and how unlike. Then I heard a step behind me and, turning, saw that a man in a black robe had come in. He was an old man with quiet eyes, perhaps a little simple.\\n\\n \"Does the Stranger want to make an offering to the goddess?\" he asked.\\n\\n I slipped a couple of coins into his hand and asked what goddess she was.\\n\\n \"Istra,\" he said.\\n\\n The name is not so uncommon in Glome and the neighbouring lands that I had much cause to be startled; but I said I had never heard of a goddess called that\\n\\n \"Oh, that is because she is a very young goddess. She has only just begun to be a goddess.\\n\\n For you must know that, like many other gods, she began by being a mortal.\"\\n\\n \"And how was she godded?\"\\n\\n \"She is so lately godded that she is still a rather poor goddess, Stranger. Yet for one little silver piece I will tell you the sacred story. Thank you, kind Stranger, thank you. Istra will be your friend for this. Now I will tell you the sacred story. Once upon a time in a certain land there lived a king and a queen who had three daughters, and the youngest was the most beautiful princess in the whole world. . . .\"\\n\\n And so he went on, as such priests do, all in a singsong voice, and using words which he clearly knew by heart. And to me it was as if the old man\u0027s voice, and the temple, and I myself and my journey, were all things in such a story; for he was telling the very history of our Istra, of Psyche herself - how Talapal (that\u0027s the Essurian Ungit) was jealous of her beauty and made her to be offered to a brute on a mountain, and how Talapal\u0027s son Ialim, the most beautiful of the gods, loved her and took her away to his secret palace. He even knew that Ialim had there visited her only in darkness and had forbidden her to see his face.\\n\\n But he had a childish reason for that: \"You see, Stranger, he had to be very secret because of his mother Talapal. She would have been very angry with him if she had known he had married the woman she most hated in the world.\"\\n\\n I thought to myself, \"It\u0027s well for me I didn\u0027t hear this story fifteen years ago; yes, or even ten. It would have reawakened all my sleeping miseries. Now, it moves, me hardly at all.\"\\n\\n Then, suddenly struck afresh with the queerness of the thing, I asked him, \"Where did you, learn all this?\"\\n\\n He stared at me as if he didn\u0027t well understand such a question. \"It\u0027s the sacred story,\" he said. I saw that he was rather silly than cunning and that it would be useless to question him. As soon as I was silent he went on.\\n\\n But now all the dreamlike feeling in me suddenly vanished. I was wide awake and I felt the blood rush into my face. He was telling it wrong - hideously and stupidly wrong. First of all, he made it that both Psyche\u0027s sisters had visited her in the secret palace of the god (to think of Redival going there!). \"And so,\" he said, \"when her two sisters had seen the beautiful palace and been feasted and given gifts, they - \"\\n\\n \"They saw the palace?\"\\n\\n \"Stranger, you are hindering the sacred story. Of course they saw the palace. They weren\u0027t blind. And then - \"\\n\\n It was as if the gods themselves had first laughed, and then spat, in my face. So this was the shape the story had taken. You may say, the shape the gods had given it. For it must be they who had put it into the old fool\u0027s mind or into the mind of some other dreamer from whom he\u0027d learned it. How could any mortal have known of that palace at all? That much of the truth they had dropped into someone\u0027s mind, in a dream, or an oracle, or however they do such things. That much; and wiped clean out the very meaning, the pith, the central knot, of the whole tale. Do I not do well to write a book against them, telling what they have kept hidden? Never, sitting on my judgement seat, had I caught a false witness in a more cunning half-truth. For if the true story had been like their story, no riddle would have been set me; there would have been no guessing and no guessing wrong. More than that, it\u0027s a story belonging to a different world, a world in which the gods show themselves clearly and don\u0027t torment men with glimpses, nor unveil to one what they hide from another, nor ask you to believe what contradicts your eyes and ears and nose and tongue and fingers. In such a world (is there such? it\u0027s not ours, for certain) I would have walked aright. The gods themselves would have been able to find no fault in me. And now to tell my story as if I had had the very sight they had denied me . . . is it not as if you told a cripple\u0027s story and never said he was lame, or told how a man betrayed a secret but never said it was after twenty hours of torture? And I saw all in a moment how the false story would grow and spread and be told all over the earth; and I wondered how many of the other sacred stories are just such twisted falsities as this.\\n\\n \"And so,\" the priest was saying, \"when these two wicked sisters had made their plan to ruin Istra, they brought her the lamp and - \"\\n\\n \"But why did she - they - want to separate her from the god, if they had seen the palace?\"\\n\\n \"They wanted to destroy her because they had seen her palace.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, because they were jealous. Her husband and her house were so much finer than theirs.\"\\n\\n That moment I resolved to write this book. For years now my old quarrel with the gods had slept. I had come into Bardia\u0027s way of thinking; I no longer meddled with them. Often, though I had seen a god myself, I was near to believing that there are no such things. The memory of his voice and face was kept in one of those rooms of my soul that I didn\u0027t lightly unlock. Now, instantly, I knew I was facing them - I with no strength and they with all; I visible to them, they invisible to me; I easily wounded (already so wounded that all my life had been but a hiding and staunching of the wound), they invulnerable; I one, they many.\\n\\n In all these years they had only let me run away from them as far as the cat lets the mouse run. Now, snatch! and the claw on me again. Well, I could speak. I could set down the truth.\\n\\n What had never perhaps been done in the world before should be done now. The case against them should be written.\\n\\n Jealousy! I jealous of Psyche? I sickened not only at the vileness of the lie but at its flatness.\\n\\n It seemed as if the gods had minds just like the lowest of the people. What came easiest to them, what seemed the likeliest and simplest reason to put in a story, was the dull, narrow passion of the beggars\u0027 streets, the temple-brothels, the slave, the child, the dog. Could they not lie, if lie they must, better than that?\\n\\n \". . . and wanders over the earth, weeping, weeping, always weeping.\" How long had the old man been going on? That one word rang in my ears as if he had repeated it a thousand times. I set my teeth and my soul stood on guard. A moment more and I should have begun to hear the sound myself again. She would have been weeping in that little wood outside the temple door.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" I shouted. \"Do you think I don\u0027t know a girl cries when her heart breaks?\\n\\n Go on, go on.\"\\n\\n \"Wanders, weeping, weeping, always weeping,\" he said. \"And falls under the power of Talapal, who hates her. And of course Ialim can\u0027t protect her because Talapal is his mother and he\u0027s afraid of her. So Talapal torments Istra and sets her to all manner of hard labours, things that seem impossible. But when Istra has done them all, then at last Talapal releases her, and she is reunited to Ialim and becomes a goddess. Then we take off her black veil, and I change my black robe for a white one, and we offer - \"\\n\\n \"You mean she will some day be reunited to the god; and you will take off her veil then?\\n\\n When is this to happen?\"\\n\\n \"We take off the veil and I change my robe in the spring.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think I care what you do? Has the thing itself happened yet or not? Is Istra now wandering over the earth or has she already become a goddess?\"\\n\\n \"But, Stranger, the sacred story is about the sacred things - the things we do in the temple.\\n\\n In spring, and all summer, she is a goddess. Then when harvest comes we bring a lamp into the temple in the night and the god flies away. Then we veil her. And all winter she is wandering and suffering; weeping, always weeping. . . .\"\\n\\n He knew nothing. The story and the worship were all one in his mind. He could not understand what I was asking.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard your story told otherwise, old man,\" said I. \"I think the Sister - or the Sisters - might have more to say for themselves than you know.\"\\n\\n \"You may be sure that they would have plenty to say for themselves,\" he replied. \"The jealous always have. Why, my own wife now - \"\\n\\n I saluted him and went out of that cold place into the warmth of the wood. I could see through the trees the red light of the fire my people had already kindled. The sun had set.\\n\\n I hid all the things I was feeling - and indeed I did not know what they were, except that all the peace of that autumnal journey was shattered - so as not to spoil the pleasure of my people. Next day I understood more clearly. I could never be at peace again till I had written\\n\\n my charge against the gods. It burned me from within. It quickened; I was with book, as a woman is with child.\\n\\n And so it comes about that I can tell nothing of our journey back to Glome. There were seven or eight days of it, and we passed many notable places in Essur; and in Glome, after we had crossed the border, we saw everywhere such good peace and plenty and such duty and, I think, love towards myself as ought to have gladdened me. But my eyes and ears were shut up. All day, and often all night too, I was recalling every passage of the true story, dragging up terrors, humiliations, struggles, and anguish that I had not thought of for years, letting Orual wake and speak, digging her almost out of a grave, out of the walled well. The more I remembered, the more still I could remember - often weeping beneath my veil as if I had never been Queen, yet never in so much sorrow that my burning indignation did not rise above it. I was in haste too. I must write it all quickly before the gods found some way to silence me. Whenever, towards evening, Ilerdia pointed and said, \"There, Queen, would be a good place for the tents,\" I said (before I had thought what I would say), \"No, no. We can make three more miles tonight; or five.\" Every morning I woke earlier. At first I endured the waiting, fretting myself in the cold mist, listening to the deep-breathed sleep of those young sleepers. But soon my patience would serve me no longer. I took to waking them. I woke them earlier each morning. In the end we were travelling like those who fly from a victorious enemy. I became silent, and this struck the others silent too. I could see they were bewildered and all the comfort of their travels was gone. I suppose they whispered together about the Queen\u0027s moods.\\n\\n When I reached home, even then I could not set about it as suddenly as I had hoped. All manner of petty work had piled up. And now, when I most needed help, word was sent me that Bardia was a little sick and kept his bed. I asked Arnom about Bardia\u0027s sickness, and Arnom said, \"It\u0027s neither poison nor fever, Queen - a small matter for a strong man. But he\u0027d best not rise. He\u0027s aging, you know.\" It would have given me a thrust of fear but that I already knew (and had seen growing signs of it lately) how that wife of his cockered and cosseted him, like a hen with one chicken - not, I\u0027d swear, through any true fears, but to keep him at home and away from the palace.\\n\\n Yet at last after infinite hindrances, I made my book and here it stands. Now, you who read, judge between the gods and me. They gave me nothing in the world to love but Psyche and then took her from me. But that was not enough. They then brought me to her at such a place and time that it hung on my word whether she should continue in bliss or be cast out into misery. They would not tell me whether she was the bride of a god, or mad, or a brute\u0027s or villain\u0027s spoil. They would give no clear sign, though I begged for it. I had to guess. And because I guessed wrong they punished me - what\u0027s worse, punished me through her. And even that was not enough; they have now sent out a lying story in which I was given no riddle to guess, but knew and saw that she was the god\u0027s bride, and of my own will destroyed her, and that for jealousy. As if I were another Redival. I say the gods deal very unrightly with us. For they will neither (which would be best of all) go away and leave us to live our own short days to ourselves, nor will they show themselves openly and tell us what they would have us do. For that too would be endurable. But to hint and hover, to draw near us in dreams and oracles, or in a waking vision that vanishes as soon as seen, to be dead silent when we question them and then glide back and whisper (words we cannot understand) in our ears when we most wish to be free of them, and to show to one what they hide from another; what is all this but cat-and-mouse play, blindman\u0027s buff, and mere jugglery? Why must holy places be dark places?\\n\\n I say, therefore, that there is no creature (toad, scorpion, or serpent) so noxious to man as the gods. Let them answer my charge if they can. It may well be that, instead of answering, they\u0027ll strike me mad or leprous or turn me into beast, bird, or tree. But will not all the world then know (and the gods will know it knows) that this is because they have no answer? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-21.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
