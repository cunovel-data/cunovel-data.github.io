{"id":103314,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"A few days after I had been with Ansit came the rite of the Year\u0027s birth. This is when the Priest is shut up in the house of Ungit from sunset, and on the following noon fights his way out and is said to be born. But of course, like all these sacred matters, it is and it is not (so that it was easy for the Fox to show its manifold contradictions). For the fight is with wooden swords, and instead of blood wine is poured over the combatants, and though they say he is shut into the house, it\u0027s only the great door to the city and the west that is shut, and the two smaller doors at the other end are open and common worshippers go in and out at will.\\n\\n When there is a King in Glome he has to go in with the Priest at sunset and remain in the house till the Birth. But it is unlawful for a virgin to be present at the things which are done in the house that night; so I go in, by the north door, only an hour before the Birth. (The others who have to be there are one of the nobles, and one of the elders, and one of the people, chosen in a sacred manner which I am not allowed to write.) That year it was a fresh morning, very sweet, with a light wind from the south; and because of that freshness out of doors, I felt it more than ever a horrible thing to go into the dark holiness of Ungit\u0027s house. I have (I think) said before that Arnom had made it a little lighter and cleaner. But it was still an imprisoning, smothering sort of place; and especially on the morning of the Birth, when there had been censing and slaughtering, and pouring of wine and pouring of blood, and dancing and feasting and towsing of girls, and burning of fat, all night long. There was as much taint of sweat and foul air as (in a mortal\u0027s house) would have set the laziest slut to opening windows, scouring and sweeping.\\n\\n I came and sat on the flat stone which is my place, opposite the sacred stone which is Ungit herself; the new, woman-shaped image a little on my left. Arnom\u0027s seat was on my right. He was in his mask, of course, nodding with weariness. They were beating the drums, but not loud, and otherwise there was silence.\\n\\n I saw the terrible girls sitting in rows down both sides of the house, each cross-legged at the door of her cell. Thus they sat year after year (and usually barren after a few seasons) till they turned into the toothless crones who were hobbling about the floor, tending fires and sweeping - sometimes, after a swift glance round, stooping as suddenly as a bird to pick up a coin or a half-gnawed bone and hide it in their gowns. And I thought how the seed of men that might have gone to make hardy boys and fruitful girls was drained into that house, and nothing given back; and how the silver that men had earned hard and needed was also drained in there, and nothing given back; and how the girls themselves were devoured and were given nothing back.\\n\\n Then I looked at Ungit herself. She had not, like most sacred stones, fallen from the sky.\\n\\n The story was that at the very beginning she had pushed her way up out of the earth - a foretaste of, or an ambassador from, whatever things may live and work down there one below the other all the way down under the dark and weight and heat. I have said she had no face; but that meant she had a thousand faces. For she was very uneven, lumpy and furrowed, so that, as when we gaze into a fire, you could always see some face or other. She was now more rugged than ever because of all the blood they had poured over her in the night. In the little clots and chains of it I made out a face; a fancy at one moment, but then, once you had seen it, not to be evaded. A face such as you might see in a loaf, swollen, brooding, infinitely female. It was a little like Batta as I remembered her in certain of her moods. Batta, when we were very small, had her loving moods, even to me. I have run out into the garden to get free - and to get, as it were, freshened and cleansed - from her huge,\\n\\n hot, strong yet flabby-soft embraces, the smothering, engulfing tenacity of her. \"Yes,\" I thought, \"Ungit is very like Batta today.\"\\n\\n \"Arnom,\" said I, whispering, \"who is Ungit?\"\\n\\n \"I think, Queen,\" said he (his voice strange out of the mask), \"she signifies the earth, which is the womb and mother of all living things.\" This was the new way of talking about the gods which Arnom, and others, had learned from the Fox.\\n\\n \"If she is the mother of all things,\" said I, \"in what way more is she the mother of the god of the Mountain?\"\\n\\n \"He is the air and the sky, for we see the clouds coming up from the earth in mists and exhalations.\"\\n\\n \"Then why do the stories sometimes say he\u0027s her husband, too?\"\\n\\n \"That means that the sky by its showers makes the earth fruitful.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s all they mean, why do they wrap it up in so strange a fashion?\"\\n\\n \"Doubtless,\" said Arnom (and I could tell that he was yawning inside the mask, being worn out with his vigil), \"doubtless to hide it from the vulgar.\"\\n\\n I would torment him no more, but I said to myself, \"It\u0027s very strange that our fathers should first think it worth telling us that rain falls out of the sky, and then, for fear such a notable secret should get out (why not hold their tongues?) wrap it up in a filthy tale so that no one could understand the telling.\"\\n\\n The drums went on. My back began to ache. Presently the little door on my right opened and a woman, a peasant, came in. You could see she had not come for the Birth feast, but on some more pressing matter of her own. She had done nothing (as even the poorest contrive for that feast) to make herself gay, and the tears were wet on her cheeks. She looked as if she had cried all night, and in her hands she held a live pigeon. One of the lesser priests came forward at once, took the tiny offering from her, slit it open with his stone knife, splashed the little shower of blood over Ungit (where it became like dribble from the mouth of the face I saw in her) and gave the body to one of the temple slaves. The peasant woman sank down on her face at Ungit\u0027s feet. She lay there a very long time, so shaking that anyone could tell how bitterly she wept. But the weeping ceased. She rose up on her knees and put back her hair from her face and took a long breath. Then she rose to go, and as she turned I could look straight into her eyes. She was grave enough; and yet (I was very close to her and could not doubt it) it was as if a sponge had been passed over her. The trouble was soothed.\\n\\n She was calm, patient, able for whatever she had to do.\\n\\n \"Has Ungit comforted you, child?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Oh yes, Queen,\" said the woman, her face almost brightening, \"Oh yes. Ungit has given me great comfort. There\u0027s no goddess like Ungit.\"\\n\\n \"Do you always pray to that Ungit,\" said I (nodding toward the shapeless stone), \"and not to that?\" Here I nodded towards our new image, standing tall and straight in her robes and (whatever the Fox might say of it) the loveliest thing our land has ever seen.\\n\\n \"Oh, always this, Queen,\" said she. \"That other, the Greek Ungit, she wouldn\u0027t understand my speech. She\u0027s only for nobles and learned men. There\u0027s no comfort in her.\"\\n\\n Soon after that it was noon and the sham fight at the western door had to be done and we all came out into the daylight, after Arnom. I had seen often enough before what met us there: the great mob, shouting, \"He is born! He is born!\" and whirling their rattles, and throwing wheat-seed into the air, all sweaty and struggling and climbing on one another\u0027s backs to get a sight of Arnom and the rest of us. Today it struck me in a new way. It was the joy of the people that amazed me. There they stood where they had waited for hours, so pressed together they could hardly breathe, each doubtless with a dozen cares and sorrows upon him (who has not?), yet every man and woman and the very children looking as if all the world was well because a man dressed up as a bird had walked out of a door after striking a few blows with a wooden sword. Even those who were knocked down in the press to see us made light of it and indeed laughed louder than the others. I saw two farmers whom I well knew for bitterest enemies (they\u0027d wasted more of my time when I sat in judgement than half the remainder of my people put together) clap hands and cry, \"He\u0027s born!\" brothers for the moment.\\n\\n I went home and into my own chamber to rest, for now that I am old that sitting on the flat stone wearies me cruelly. I sank into deep thought.\\n\\n \"Get up, girl,\" said a voice. I opened my eyes. My father stood beside me. And instantly all the long years of my queenship shrank up small like a dream. How could I have believed in them? How could I ever have thought I should escape from the King? I got up from my bed obediently and stood before him. When I made to put on my veil, he said, \"None of that folly, do you hear?\" and I laid it obediently aside.\\n\\n \"Come with me to the Pillar Room,\" he said.\\n\\n I followed him down the stair (the whole palace was empty) and we went into the Pillar Room. He looked all round him, and I became very afraid because I felt sure he was looking for that mirror of his. But I had given it to Redival when she became Queen of Phars; and what would he do to me when he learned that I had stolen his favourite treasure? But he went to one corner of the room and found there (which were strange things to find in such a place) two pickaxes and a crowbar. \"To your work, goblin,\" he said, and made me take one of the picks. He began to break up the paved floor in the center of the room, and I helped him. It was very hard labour because of the pain in my back. When we had lifted four or five of the big stone flags we found a dark hole, like a wide well, beneath them.\\n\\n \"Throw yourself down,\" said the King, seizing me by the hand. And however I struggled, I could not free myself, and we both jumped together. When we had fallen a long way we alighted on our feet, nothing hurt by our fall. It was warmer down here and the air was hard to breathe, but it was not so dark that I could not see the place we were in. It was another Pillar Room, exactly like the one we had left, except that it was smaller and all made (floor, walls, and pillars) of raw earth. And here also my father looked about him, and once again I was afraid he would ask what I had done with his mirror. But instead, he went into a corner of the earthen room and there found two spades and put one into my hand and said, \"Now, work. Do you mean to slug abed all your life?\" So then we had to dig a hole in the center of the room. And this time the labour was worse than before, for what we dug was all tough, clinging clay, so that you had rather to cut it out in squares with the spade than to dig it.\\n\\n And the place was stifling. But at last we had done so much that another black hole opened beneath us. This time I knew what he meant to do to me, so I tried to keep my hand from his. But he caught it and said,\\n\\n \"Do you begin to set your wits against mine? Throw yourself down.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no, no, no; no further down; mercy!\" said I.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no Fox to help you here,\" said my father. \"We\u0027re far below any dens that foxes can dig. There\u0027s hundreds of tons of earth between you and the deepest of them.\" Then we leaped down into the hole, and fell further than before, but again alighted unhurt. It was far darker here, yet I could see that we were in yet another Pillar Room; but this was of living rock, and water trickled down the walls of it. Though it was so like the two shallower rooms, this was far the smallest. And as I looked I could see that it was getting smaller still. The roof was closing in on us. I tried to cry out to him, \"If you\u0027re not quick, we shall be buried,\"\\n\\n but I was smothering and no voice came from me. Then I thought, \"He doesn\u0027t care. It\u0027s nothing for him to be buried, for he\u0027s dead already.\"\\n\\n \"Who is Ungit?\" said he, still holding my hand.\\n\\n Then he led me across the floor; and, a long way off before we came to it, I saw that mirror on the wall, just where it always had been. At the sight of it my terror increased, and I fought with all my strength not to go on. But his hand had grown very big now and it was as soft and clinging as Batta\u0027s arms, or as the tough clay we had been digging, or as the dough of a huge loaf. I was not so much dragged as sucked along till we stood right in front of the mirror. And in it I saw him, looking as he had looked that other day when he led me to the mirror long ago.\\n\\n But my face was the face of Ungit as I had seen it that day in her house.\\n\\n \"Who is Ungit?\" asked the King.\\n\\n \"I am Ungit.\" My voice came wailing out of me and I found that I was in the cool daylight and in my own chamber. So it had been what we call a dream. But I must give warning that from this time onward they so drenched me with seeings that I cannot well discern dream from waking nor tell which is the truer. This vision, anyway, allowed no denial. Without question it was true. It was I who was Ungit. That ruinous face was mine. I was that Batta-thing, that all-devouring womblike, yet barren, thing. Glome was a web - I the swollen spider, squat at its center, gorged with men\u0027s stolen lives.\\n\\n \"I will not be Ungit,\" said I. I got up, shivering as with fever, from my bed and bolted the door. I took down my old sword, the very same that Bardia had taught me to use, and drew it. It looked such a happy thing (and it was indeed a most true, perfect, fortunate blade) that tears came into my eyes. \"Sword,\" said I, \"you have had a happy life. You killed Argan. You saved Bardia. Now, for your masterpiece.\"\\n\\n It was all foolishness, though. The sword was too heavy for me now. My grip - think of a veined, claw-like hand, skinny knuckles - was childish. I would never be able to strike home; and I had seen enough of wars to know what a feeble thrust would do. This way of ceasing to be Ungit was now too hard for me. I sat down - the cold, small, helpless thing I was - on the edge of my bed and thought again.\\n\\n There must, whether the gods see it or not, be something great in the mortal soul. For suffering, it seems, is infinite, and our capacity without limit.\\n\\n Of the things that followed I cannot at all say whether they were what men call real or what men call dream. And for all I can tell, the only difference is that what many see we call a real\\n\\n thing, and what only one sees we call a dream. But things that many see may have no taste or moment in them at all, and things that are shown only to one may be spears and water-spouts of truth from the very depth of truth.\\n\\n The day passed somehow. All days pass, and that\u0027s great comfort; unless there should be some terrible region in the deadlands where the day never passes. But when the house slept I wrapped myself in a dark cloak and took a stick to lean on; for I think the bodily weakness, which I die of now, must have begun about that time. Then a new thought came to me. My veil was no longer a means to be unknown. It revealed me; all men knew the veiled Queen.\\n\\n My disguise now would be to go bareface; there was hardly anyone who had seen me unveiled. So, for the first time in many years, I went out bareface; showed that face which many had said, more truly than they could know, was too dreadful to be seen. It would have shamed me no more to go buff-naked. For I thought I would look as like Ungit to them as I had seen myself to be in that mirror beneath the earth. As like Ungit? I was Ungit; I in her and she in me. Perhaps if any saw me, they would worship me. I had become what the people, and the old Priest, called holy.\\n\\n I went out, as often before, by the little eastern doorway that opens on the herb-garden. And thence, with endless weariness, through the sleeping city. I thought they would not sleep so sound if they knew what dark thing hobbled past their windows. Once I heard a child cry; perhaps it had dreamed of me. \"If the Shadowbrute begins coming down into the City, the people will be greatly afraid,\" said the old Priest. If I were Ungit, I might be the Shadowbrute also. For the gods work in and out of one another as of us.\\n\\n So at last, fainting with weariness, out beyond the city and down to the river; I myself had made it deep. The old Shennit, as she was before my works, would not, save in spate, have drowned even a crone.\\n\\n I had to go a little way along the river to a place where I knew that the bank was high, so that I could fling myself down; for I doubted my courage to wade in and feel death first up to my knee, and then to my belly, and then to my neck, and still to go on. When I came to the high bank I took my girdle and tied my ankles together with it lest even in my old age I might save my life, or lengthen my death, by swimming. Then I straightened myself, panting from the labour, and stood footfast like a prisoner.\\n\\n I hopped - what blending of misery and buffoonery it would have looked if I could have seen it! - hopped with my strapped feet a little nearer to the edge.\\n\\n A voice came from beyond the river: \"Do not do it.\"\\n\\n Instantly - I had been freezing cold till now - a wave of fire passed over me, even down to my numb feet. It was the voice of a god. Who should know better than I? A god\u0027s voice had once shattered my whole life. They are not to be mistaken. It may well be that by trickery of priests men have sometimes taken a mortal\u0027s voice for a god\u0027s. But it will not work the other way. No one who hears a god\u0027s voice takes it for a mortal\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Lord, who are you?\" said I.\\n\\n \"Do not do it,\" said the god. \"You cannot escape Ungit by going to the deadlands, for she is there also. Die before you die. There is no chance after.\"\\n\\n \"Lord, I am Ungit.\"\\n\\n But there was no answer. And that is another thing about the voices of the gods; when once they have ceased, though it is only a heart-beat ago and the bright hard syllables, the heavy bars or mighty obelisks of sound, are still master in your ears, it is as if they had ceased a thousand years before, and to expect further utterance is like asking for an apple from a tree that fruited the day the world was made.\\n\\n The voice of the god had not changed in all those years, but I had. There was no rebel in me now. I must not drown and doubtless should not be able to.\\n\\n I crawled home, troubling the quiet city once more with my dark witch-shape and my tapping stick. And when I laid my head on my pillow it seemed but a moment before my women came to wake me, whether because the whole journey had been a dream or because my weariness (which would be no wonder) had thrown me into a very fast sleep. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-23.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
