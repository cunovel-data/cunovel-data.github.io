{"id":103310,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"On a great day the thing that makes it great may fill the least part of it - as a meal takes little time to eat, but the killing, baking and dressing, and the swilling and scraping after it, take long enough. My fight with the Prince took about the sixth part of an hour; yet the business about it more than twelve.\\n\\n First of all, now that the Fox was a freeman and the Queen\u0027s Lantern (so we call it, though my father had let the office sleep) I would have him at the fight and splendidly dressed. But you never had more trouble with a peevish girl going to her first feast. He said all barbarians\u0027 clothes were barbarous and the finer the worse. He would go in his old motheaten gown. And when we had brought him into some kind of order, then Bardia wanted me to fight without my veil. He thought it would blind me and did not see how it could well be worn either over or under my helmet. But I refused altogether to fight bareface. In the end I had Poobi to stitch me up a hood or mask of fine stuff, but such as could not be seen through; it had two eye-holes and covered the whole helmet. All this was needless, for I had fought Bardia himself in my old veil a dozen times; but the mask made me look very dreadful, as a ghost might look. \"If he\u0027s the coward they\u0027d make him,\" said Bardia, \"that\u0027ll cool his stomach.\" And then we had to start very early, it seemed, for the crowd in the streets would make us ride slowly. So we had Trunia down and were all presently on horseback. There was some talk of dressing him fine too, but he refused this.\\n\\n \"Whether your champion kills or is killed,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll fare no better in purple than in my old battle order. But where is your champion, Queen?\"\\n\\n \"You shall see when we come to the field, Prince,\" said I.\\n\\n Trunia had started when he first saw me shrouded like a ghost; neither throat nor helmet to be seen, but two eye-holes in a white hummock; scarecrow or leper. I thought his starting boded well how it would taste to Argan.\\n\\n Several lords and elders waited for us at the gate to bring us through the city. It\u0027s easy to guess what I was thinking. So Psyche had gone out that day to heal the people; and so she had gone out that other day to be offered to the Brute. Perhaps, thought I, this is what the god meant when he said You also shall be Psyche. I also might be an offering. That was a good, firm thought to lay hold of. But the thing was so near now that I could think very little of my own death or life. With all those eyes upon me, my only care was to make a brave show both now and in the fight. I\u0027d have given ten talents to any prophet who would have foretold me that I\u0027d fight well for five minutes and then be killed.\\n\\n The lords who rode nearest me were very grave. I supposed (and indeed one or two confessed as much to me afterwards when I came to know them) they thought Argan would soon have me disarmed, but that my mad challenge was as good a way as any of getting him and Trunia both out of our country. But if the lords were glum, the common people in the streets were huzzaing and throwing caps in the air. It would have puffed me up if I had not looked in their faces. There I could read their mind easily enough. Neither I nor Glome was in their thoughts. Any fight was a free show for them; and a fight of a woman with a man better still because an oddity - as those who can\u0027t tell one tune from another will crowd to hear the harp if a man plays it with his toes.\\n\\n When at last we got down to the open field by the river there had to be more delays. Arnom was there in his bird mask and there was a bull to be sacrificed; so well the gods have wound themselves into our affairs that nothing can be done but they have their bit. And\\n\\n opposite us, on the far side of the field, were the horsemen of Phars, and Argan sitting on his horse in the midst of them. It was the strangest thing in the world to look upon him, a man like any other man, and think that one of us presently would kill the other. Kill; it seemed like a word I\u0027d never spoken before. He was a man with straw-coloured hair and beard, thin, yet somehow bloated, with pouting lips; a very unpleasing person. Then he and I dismounted and came close and each had to taste a tiny morsel of the bull\u0027s flesh, and take oaths on behalf of our peoples that all the agreements would be kept.\\n\\n And now, I thought, surely now they\u0027ll let us begin. (There was a pale white sun in a grey sky that day, and a biting wind; \"Do they want us to freeze before we fight?\" I thought.) But now the people had to be pressed back with the butt-ends of spears, and the field cleared, and Bardia must go across and whisper something to Argan\u0027s chief man, and both of them must go and whisper to Arnom, and Argan\u0027s trumpeter and mine must be placed side by side.\\n\\n \"Now, Queen,\" said Bardia suddenly, when I had half despaired of ever getting to the end of the preparations, \"the gods guard you.\"\\n\\n The Fox was standing with his face set like iron; he would have wept if he had tried to speak. I saw a great shock of surprise come over Trunia (and I never blamed him for turning pale) when I flung off my cloak, drew my sword, and stepped out onto the open grass.\\n\\n The men from Phars roared with laughter. Our mob cheered. Argan was within ten paces of me, then five; then we were at it.\\n\\n I know he began despising me; there was a lazy insolence in his first passes. But I took the skin off his knuckles with one lucky stroke (and maybe numbed his hand a little) and that brought him to his senses. Though my eye never left his sword, yet I somehow saw his face as well. \"Cross-patch,\" thought I. He had a puckered brow and a sort of blackguardly fretfulness about his lip, which perhaps already masked some fear. For my part, I felt no fear because, now that we were really at it, I did not believe in the combat at all. It was so like all my sham fights with Bardia: the same strokes, feints, deadlocks. Even the blood on his knuckles made no difference; a blunt sword or the flat of a sword could have done as much.\\n\\n You, the Greek for whom I write, may never have fought; or if you did, you fought, most likely, as a hoplite. Unless I were with you and had a sword, or at least a stick, in my hand I could not make you understand the course of it. I soon felt sure he could not kill me. But I was less sure I could kill him. I was very afraid lest the thing should last too long and his greater strength would grind me down. What I shall remember forever is the change that presently came over his face. It was to me an utter astonishment. I did not understand it. I should now. I have since seen the faces of other men as they began to believe, \"This is death.\" You will know it if you have seen it; life more alive than ever, a raging, tortured intensity of life. Then he made his first bad mistake, and I missed my chance. It seemed a long time (it was a few minutes really) before he made it again. That time I was ready for it.\\n\\n I gave the straight thrust and then, all in one motion, wheeled my sword round and cut him deeply in the inner leg where no surgery will stop the bleeding. I jumped back of course, lest his fall should bear me down with him; so my first man-killing bespattered me less than my first pig-killing.\\n\\n People ran to him, but there was no possibility of saving his life. The shouting of the mob dinned in my ears, sounding strange as all things sound when you\u0027re in your helmet. I was scarcely out of breath even; most of my bouts with Bardia had been far longer. Yet I felt of a sudden very weak and my legs were shaking; and I felt myself changed too, as if something\\n\\n had been taken away from me. I have often wondered if women feel like that when they lose their virginity.\\n\\n Bardia (the Fox close behind him) came running up to me, with tears in his eyes and joy all over his face. \"Blessed! Blessed!\" he cried. \"Queen! Warrior! My best scholar! Gods, how prettily you did it! A stroke to remember all one\u0027s days.\" And he raised my left hand to his lips. I wept hard and kept my head well down so that he should not see the tears dropping from under the mask. But long before I had my voice back they were all about me (Trunia still on horseback because he could not walk) with praises and thanks, till I was almost pestered with it, though a little sweet-sharp prickle of pride thrust up inside me. There was no peace. I must speak to the people, and to the men of Phars. I must, it seemed, do a score of things. And I thought, \"Oh for that bowl of milk, drunk alone in the cool dairy, the first day I ever used a sword!\"\\n\\n As soon as I had any voice I called for my horse, mounted, brought it alongside Trunia\u0027s, and held out my hand to him. Thus we rode forward a few paces and faced the horsemen of Phars.\\n\\n \"Strangers,\" said I, \"you have seen Prince Argan killed in clean combat. Is there any more debate concerning the succession of Phars?\"\\n\\n About half a dozen of them, who had no doubt been Argan\u0027s chief partisans, made no other answer than to wheel about and gallop off. The rest all raised their helmets on their spears and shouted for Trunia and peace. Then I let go his hand, and he rode forward and in among them and was soon talking with their captains.\\n\\n \"Now, Queen,\" said Bardia in my ear, \"it\u0027s an absolute necessity that you should bid some of our notables and some of those from Phars (the Prince will tell us which) to a feast in the palace. And Arnom too.\"\\n\\n \"A feast, Bardia? Of bean-bread? You know we\u0027ve bare larders in Glome.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s the pig, Queen. And Ungit must let us have a share of the bull; I\u0027ll speak to Arnom of it. You must let the King\u0027s cellar blood to some purpose tonight, and then the bread will be less noticed.\" Thus my fancy of a snug supper with Bardia and the Fox was dashed, and my sword not yet wiped from the blood of my first battle before I found myself all woman again and caught up in housewife\u0027s cares. If only I could have ridden away from them all and got to the butler before they reached the palace and learned what wine we really had!\\n\\n My father (and doubtless Batta) had had enough to swim in during his last few days.\\n\\n In the end there were five and twenty of us (counting myself) who rode back from that field to the palace. The Prince was at my side, saying all manner of fine things about me (as indeed he had some reason) and always begging me to let him see my face. It was only a kind of courteous banter and would have been nothing to any other woman. To me it was so new and (I must confess this also) so sweet that I could not choose but keep the sport up a little. I had been happy, far happier than I could hope to be again, with Psyche and the Fox, long ago before our troubles. Now, for the first time in all my life (and the last) I was gay. A new world, very bright, seemed to be opening all round me.\\n\\n It was of course the gods\u0027 old trick; blow the bubble up big before you prick it.\\n\\n They pricked it a moment after I had crossed the threshold of my house. A little girl whom I\u0027d never seen before, a slave, came out from some corner where she\u0027d been lurking and\\n\\n whispered in Bardia\u0027s ear. He had been very merry up till now; the sunlight went out of his face. Then he came up to me and said half shamefacedly, \"Queen, the day\u0027s work is over.\\n\\n You\u0027ll not need me now. I\u0027d take it very kindly if you\u0027ll let me go home. My wife\u0027s taken with her pains. We had thought it could not be so soon. I\u0027d be glad to be with her tonight.\"\\n\\n I understood in that moment all my father\u0027s rages. I put terrible constraint on myself and said, \"Why, Bardia, it is very fit you should. Commend me to your wife. And offer this ring to Ungit for her safe delivery.\" The ring which I took off my finger was the choicest I had.\\n\\n His thanks were hearty yet he had hardly time to utter them before he was speeding away. I suppose he never dreamed what he had done to me with those words The day\u0027s work isover. Yes, that was it - the day\u0027s work. I was his work; he earned his bread by being my soldier. When his tale of work for the day was done, he went home like other hired men and took up his true life.\\n\\n That night\u0027s banquet was the first I had ever been at and the last I ever sat through (we do not lie at table like Greeks but sit on chairs or benches). After this, though I gave many feasts, I never did more than to come in three times and pledge the most notable guests and speak to all and then out again, always with two of my women attending me. This has saved me much weariness, besides putting about a great notion either of my pride or my modesty which has been useful enough. That night I sat nearly to the end, the only woman in the whole mob of them. Three parts of me was a shamed and frightened Orual who looked forward to a scolding from the Fox for being there at all, and was bitterly lonely; the fourth part was Queen, proud (though dazed too) amid the heat and clamour, sometimes dreaming she could laugh loud and drink deep like a man and a warrior, next moment, more madly, answering to Trunia\u0027s daffing, as if her veil hid the face of a pretty woman.\\n\\n When I got away and up into the cold and stillness of the gallery my head reeled and ached.\\n\\n And \"Faugh!\" I thought. \"What vile things men are!\" They were all drunk by now (except the Fox, who had gone early), but their drinking had sickened me less than their eating. I had never seen men at their pleasures before: the gobbling, snatching, belching, hiccuping, the greasiness of it all, the bones thrown on the floor, the dogs quarrelling under our feet.\\n\\n Were all men such? Would Bardia - ? then back came my loneliness. My double loneliness, for Bardia, for Psyche. Not separable. The picture, the impossible fool\u0027s dream, was that all should have been different from the very beginning and he would have been my husband and Psyche our daughter. Then I would have been in labour . . . with Psyche . . . and to me he would have been coming home. But now I discovered the wonderful power of wine. I understand why men become drunkards. For the way it worked on me was - not at all that it blotted out these sorrows - but that it made them seem glorious and noble, like sad music, and I somehow great and reverend for feeling them. I was a great, sad queen in a song. I did not check the big tears that rose in my eyes. I enjoyed them. To say all, I was drunk; I played the fool.\\n\\n And so to my fool\u0027s bed. What was that? No, no, not a girl crying in the garden. No one, cold, hungry, and banished, was shivering there, longing and not daring to come in. It was the chains swinging at the well. It would be folly to get up and go out and call again: Psyche, Psyche, my only love. I am a great queen. I have killed a man. I am drunk like a man. All warriors drink deep after the battle. Bardia\u0027s lips on my hand were like the touch of lightning. All great princes have mistresses or lovers. There\u0027s the crying again. No, it\u0027s only the buckets at the well. \"Shut the window, Poobi. To your bed, child. Do you love me, Poobi?\\n\\n Kiss me good night. Good night.\" The King\u0027s dead. He\u0027ll never pull my hair again. A straight thrust and then a cut in the leg. That would have killed him. I am the Queen; I\u0027ll kill Orual too. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold/page-19.html","bookId":2641,"book":{"id":2641,"title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","description":"Storyline: This tale of two princesses - one beautiful and one unattractive - and of the struggle between sacred and profane love is Lewis’s reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche and one of his most enduring works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/till-we-have-faces-a-myth-retold.jpg","author":"C.
