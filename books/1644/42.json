It’s how she knows whether or not I’ve agreed to the terms for our next trade. If I stop here until the next train comes in—a few more seconds now—it means that I accept. Over the past few months, the Archivists have come to know me as someone who doesn’t trade often, but who does have items of value. I turn from the lake and see the city, its white buildings and masses of dark-clothed people moving through. It reminds me of going into the Carving, and again I remember that time long ago in the Borough when I saw the diagram of my body, those rivers of blood and those strong white bones. Just before the next train slides in, I start down the steps. The price is too low. I don’t accept. Yet. I didn’t know I had this inside of me. I didn’t know all that was inside of him, either. I thought I did, but people run deep and complicated like rivers, hold their shape and are carved upon like stone. He sent me a message. Such a thing is difficult to do, but he is in the Rising, and he has managed the impossible before. The message tells me where I can meet him. After I’ve finished work, I will go to see him. Tonight. I will see him tonight. A pattern of frost blooms along the cement wall at the bottom of the stairs. It looks, I imagine, as if someone painted stars or flowers at exactly the right time; a momentary capture of beauty that will too soon vanish.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crossed-matched-2/page-42.html","bookId":1644,"book":{"id":1644,"title":"Crossed (Matched #2)","description":"Storyline: Crossed (Matched #2) The Society chooses everything.
