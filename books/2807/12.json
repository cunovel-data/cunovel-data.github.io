{"id":90894,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"You need a sidekick,\" Marc announced. He\u0027d just finished his second plateful of steak and eggs. I was sticking with tea and honey.\n \"I\u0027ve already got one,\" I said gloomily. \"My friend Jessica.\"\n \"I mean a badass, not someone from the secretarial pool.\"\n I stuck a finger in his face. \"First of all, do not mock secretaries, nor their pools-I was a secretary until last week.\"\n \"Then you died?\"\n \"No, I was laid off. Then I died. In fact, I should take a drive by the place...it\u0027s probably gone up in flames by now.\" I chortled evilly. \"When they laid off the admin staff, they lost the capability to call their clients, make their computers work, make the sorter on the copy machine work, place orders for office supplies, update the database, figure out the postage machine...oh, the humanity.\" I grinned at the mental image, then got back to business. \"Second, Jessica is at least twice as smart as anyone sitting at this table. Third-cripes, how much are you going to eat?\" During my scolding he\u0027d flagged the waitress.\n \"I\u0027ve been a little too depressed to eat lately,\" he said defensively. \"Besides, you\u0027re just jealous.\"\n \"You\u0027re right about that. My mom fixed my favorite meal the other night and I threw it up all over her bathroom.\"\n \"But you can drink...?\" He nodded toward my tea.\n \"Apparently. Doesn\u0027t do a thing for me...sure doesn\u0027t make me less thirsty. But it\u0027s familiar, you know?\"\n \"Sure. That\u0027s why I stay in the ER. It\u0027s depressing as hell and you get no closure, but at least I know where everything is.\"\n \"That\u0027s ridiculous. If you\u0027re so unhappy in that job, leave. Go work in a nice family clinic somewhere.\"\n He shrugged, looking down on his plate. \"Yeah, well...\"\n \"I mean, it must be hard. Working in a children\u0027s hospital.\"\n \"It\u0027s unbelievably awful,\" he said gloomily. \"You would not believe the evil shit people do to children.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to hear it,\" I said hurriedly.\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it, but it\u0027s all I do. Actually, I want to talk to you about it. You\u0027ve got to-to feed, right? Well, I could get you a list of abusive parents, the ones who like to use their babies as ash trays, the ones who decide to press a hot iron to the kid\u0027s back because she slammed the door a little too hard. And you could-fix things.\"\n \"A blood sucking vigilante?\" I was horrified. And intrigued. No, I was horrified. \"Did you not hear me? About how until last week I was a secretary?\"\n \"Not anymore,\" Marc said smugly. Now that he\u0027d thought he\u0027d found a purpose, his entire demeanor-even his smell!-was different. Gone was the slump-shouldered sad-eyed boy. In his place was the Cisco Kid. \"You told me you thought you\u0027d fight crime to atone for your feeding habits, right? Well, where better to start?\"\n I just shook my head and stirred my tea.\n \"Well, what\u0027s your alternative? You don\u0027t seem the type to skulk in the shadows and lure the unwary into your fiendish embrace.\"\n The mental image made me laugh.\n \"And another thing-vampires don\u0027t giggle.\"\n \"This one does. And before I forget...\" My hand shot out. I pulled him toward me and looked deeply into his eyes. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re feeling better, but if you should relapse, you won\u0027t. Kill. Yourself.\"\n He stared back. His pupils were dots; the lights in this all-night cafe were ferocious. \"I\u0027ll do...Whatever. The hell. I want. But thanks. Anyway.\"\n I stared harder. Come on, vampire mojo. Do your thing. \"Don\u0027t. Kill. Yourself.\"\n \"Why. Are you. Talking. Like this?\"\n I dropped his hands in disgust. \"Dammit! I\u0027ve been able to make men do my bidding since I woke up dead. What\u0027s so special about you?\"\n \"Thanks for sounding so disgusted. And I have no idea. I-uh-\" His jaw sagged and I could practically hear his I.Q. dropping. He stared dreamily over my shoulder. I looked-and nearly shrieked. The psychopath from the cemetery was standing in the doorway of the cafe, looking straight at me. Ack! His hair was a mess, I was happy to see. I couldn\u0027t see his back, but he smelled like burned cotton. Good!\n \"Oh my God,\" Marc rhapsodized. \"Who is that?\"\n \"An asshole,\" I mumbled, turning back to him and picking up my tea.\n \"He\u0027s coming over here!\" Marc squealed. \"Oh my God oh my God ohmyGod!\"\n \"Will you get a hold of yourself?\" I hissed. \"You sound like a girl with a crush. Ah-ha!\" Realization hit, a little slowly as usual. \"You\u0027re gay!\" I realized I\u0027d shouted and everyone in the cafe was staring at us.\n \"Duh.\"\n \"What, \u0027duh\u0027? How was I supposed to know? I just assumed you were straight.\"\n \"Because you are.\" He was still staring over my shoulder, trying to fix his hair which was so incredibly short it could never be mussed. \"I always assume everyone is gay.\"\n \"Well, statistically that\u0027s pretty dumb.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have to take criticism from an undead breeder...hellooooo,\" he cooed. I felt a weight drop on my shoulder: Jerkoff\u0027s hand. I shrugged it off.\n \"Good evening,\" Jerkoff said.\n \"Fuck off,\" I said warmly.\n He slid into the booth beside Marc. I heard a muffled gasp and thought Marc was going to swoon. \"I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve been formally introduced.\"\n \"I was just about to take care of that when you stuck your finger in my mouth.\" I thought about throwing my tea in his face, but the jerk would probably use Marc as a living shield.\n \"Ah. Yes. Well, my name is Sinclair. And you are...?\"\n \"Really pissed at you.\"\n \"Is that a family name?\"\n Marc burst out laughing. Sinclair favored him with a warm smile. \"Is this a friend of yours?\"\n \"None of your fucking business.\"\n \"She talked me out of jumping to a grisly death,\" Marc informed my archenemy. \"Then we came here to plot about all the abusive parents we\u0027re going to put an end to.\"\n \"We did not.\"\n \"Did too!\"\n Sinclair\u0027s nostrils flared, he leaned in close for a good look at Marc\u0027s neck (a bruise was rapidly forming, but there were no signs of teeth marks), then he looked at me. \"You have fed on this man?\"\n I blushed. Or at least, I felt like I blushed-who knew if I still could? \"Again: none of your fucking business.\"\n He drummed his fingers on the table. I tried not to stare. They were sooo long and slim, and I had a vague idea of the power in them. \"Interesting. And here you both are now. Hmm.\"\n \"Want to join us?\" Marc piped up. I groaned, but they both ignored me. \"Have a cup of coffee or something?\"\n \"I don\u0027t drink...coffee.\"\n \"Oh, very funny,\" I snapped. \"What are you doing here, Sink Lair? If it\u0027s about the bill for your coat, too damned bad-you brought that on yourself.\"\n \"Indeed.\" His gaze was cool. \"A matter I will bring up with you shortly, but as to your question, I am here for your benefit, my dear.\"\n \"Don\u0027t call me that.\"\n \"You can call me that,\" Marc chirped helpfully.\n \"Nostro wants you dead for your actions tonight. The vampire who brings him your head will be richly rewarded.\"\n \"Who the hell is Noseo?\"\n \"Nostro. He\u0027s-I suppose you would call him a tribal chief. Sometimes-often-vampires band together and the strongest is in charge.\"\n \"Why in the hell do they do that?\" I griped. \"Why don\u0027t they just go about their own business like they did before they died?\"\n \"Because they are not allowed to. The vampires are forced to take sides.\"\n \"Nobody\u0027s forced me.\"\n \"We will attend to that later-\"\n \"What?\"\n \"-but to answer your question, the undead band together for protection. For a sense of security.\"\n \"So this guy Notso is torqued off because I didn\u0027t play the game?\"\n \"That, and because of the peals of hysterical laughter which burst from your chest.\"\n Marc had been following the conversation quite closely, and now he stared at me. \"The head vamp wanted you do to something, and you laughed at him?\"\n \"For quite some time,\" Sink Lair added helpfully.\n \"Betsy, jeez! Didn\u0027t he try to smack you or something?\"\n \"He visited upon her the worst punishment a vampire can endure...and she laughed at that, as well.\" Then, \"Betsy?\"\n \"Yeah, Betsy, wanna make something of it?\"\n \"Indeed, no.\" Was the asshole actually hiding a smirk? I looked, and he stared back, expressionless. Must have been my imagination.\n \"So you\u0027re here to try to bring Notso my head?\"\n \"Nostro. And no, I am not. You\u0027re far too pretty to behead.\"\n \"Barf. Is Nostro short for Nostrodamus? Is the tubby twit that unimaginative?\"\n Sink Lair looked pained. \"Yes, and yes.\"\n \"Ugh.\"\n \"I quite agree.\"\n \"So why are you here, Sink Lair?\"\n \"It\u0027s SIN-clair, and I should think that would be obvious, even to you. You are newly undead and clearly a menace to yourself. You don\u0027t know any of the rules, and there is now a bounty on your head not seventy-two hours after you first rose...a neat trick, by the way. I will take you under my protection.\"\n \"And in return...?\" I didn\u0027t mean to sound like there was a bug in my mouth, but I couldn\u0027t help it. I didn\u0027t trust Sink Lair as far as I could throw him. Hmm...better come up with a new cliche.\n \"In return, we will discover why you are so different from the rest of us. You should have been in agony when they flung holy water on you. Instead it gave you the hiccups. Once I deduce--\"\n \"No thanks.\"\n \"Really. I insist.\"\n \"I don\u0027t give a shit! You\u0027re not my father-although you\u0027re probably old enough to be, creep, and-\"\n \"How old are you?\" Marc asked breathlessly.\n Sinclair spared him a glance. \"I was born the year World War II was declared.\"\n I gasped in horror. To think I was attracted to this fossil! Well, it wasn\u0027t entirely my fault...Sinclair looked like he was in his early thirties. There wasn\u0027t as much as a speck of gray in his inky black hair, no wrinkles bracketing his fathomless dark eyes. \"Ewwwww! So you\u0027re, like, ninety years old? Yuck! Do you have a truss under that suit?\"\n \"You are the most ignorant, prideful, vainglorious-\"\n \"It\u0027s more like he\u0027s in his early sixties,\" Marc interrupted hurriedly. \"And both of you, mellow out. I don\u0027t want to be in the middle of a vampire fist fight.\"\n \"Indeed. Go to sleep.\"\n \"But I\u0027m zzzzzzzzzzzz...\"\n I shoved my hand out, so instead of Marc\u0027s head connecting briskly with the table, he snored into my palm instead. I slowly pulled away and gave Sinclair a good glare. \"What\u0027d you do that for?\" And how did you do that? I\u0027d have to try that on the Stepmonster sometime.\n He looked back, cool as a baby lying on a pile of ice cubes. \"It was inappropriate for him to hear so much about us. Which is another matter I mean to take up with you. Is it true that you have told your family you are still alive?\"\n \"I\u0027m not still alive, it\u0027s none of your business, how\u0027d you find out?\"\n \"You must not do such things. You endanger the very ones you would seek to protect.\"\n \"Has anyone ever told you, you don\u0027t use contractions? Everything is \u0027you are\u0027 and \u0027I am\u0027 and \u0027you would\u0027.\"\n \"Has anyone ever told you that you lack focus?\"\n \"Sure,\" I said. I drained my tea and set it down, hard. Marc snored on, oblivious. \"Now listen up. I don\u0027t appreciate being grabbed, I sure as shit didn\u0027t care for your digits in my mouth-\"\n \"I\u0027m tempted to put something else in your mouth this minute,\" he said silkily.\n \"Shut up! And I don\u0027t like you following me and I don\u0027t like you putting my friends to sleep.\"\n \"He is not your friend. You only met this evening.\"\n \"He\u0027s a friend I haven\u0027t known very long, all right? Now buzz off. I can take care of myself, I don\u0027t need you, I don\u0027t want you-\"\n \"All lies.\"\n \"-and I don\u0027t want your stupid vampire tribes, either. Just because I\u0027m dead doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t have a life.\" Sinclair blinked at that one, and I hurried on before he could interrupt again. \"Yeah, I told my family I wasn\u0027t dead...why the hell not? They\u0027re not going to stake me in the middle of the night-well, my real parents won\u0027t. I\u0027m coping as well as I can, thanks for nothing, and I don\u0027t plan on hooking up with any of you undead losers.\"\n \"Finished?\"\n \"Uh...\" Let\u0027s see...can take care of myself...it\u0027s my business who I tell...undead losers... \"Yeah.\"\n \"We will speak again. There will come a time, Miss Rogue, when you will badly need my help. I hold no grudges, and will gladly give it.\" He grinned at me. It was terrifying...all white teeth and glowing eyes. \"Provided you let me put something in your mouth again. Good night.\"\n Poof! Vanished. Or he moved so quickly I couldn\u0027t track him. Either way, he was gone, I was shaking with rage and-oh, no!--lust, and Marc was drooling on the Formica. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-12.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor.
