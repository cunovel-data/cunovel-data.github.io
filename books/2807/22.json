For all intents and purposes, we\u0027re stuck for the next thousand years.\n A week ago my biggest problem was finding a new job. Now I had to worry about running a kingdom of vampires, keeping my hands off Sinclair (because, oh God, I still want him, would do just about anything to feel his hands and-other things-again), giving Tina the cold shoulder until I decided to forgive her, keeping Jessica and Marc from starting their new crime fighting business (HELP, Inc.), and help thousands of vampires acclimate to being in charge of their own destiny.\n Not to mention finding permanent suck buddies and a paying job-I was undead and unemployed, and couldn\u0027t live off Jessica\u0027s charity forever.\n Worse, my mom was completely taken with Sinclair. He really swept her off her feet when he came to take her out of harm\u0027s way. She thinks the fact that Sinclair is the king is just dandy. \"You know, Betsy, just because you\u0027re a vampire doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t settle down with someone. Just because you\u0027re undead doesn\u0027t mean you have to be unwed.\"\n Yeah, sure. I planned to stay unwed, for a thousand years to be exact. Having that sneaky Sinclair as a consort was bad enough (and what exactly was a consort, anyway?); I wasn\u0027t about to become the little woman.\n Now if I could just get him to quit dropping off pairs of designer shoes. In his last card he said he would drop off a pair a day until I forgave him. I\u0027m up to fourteen pairs of Pradas, eight pairs of Manolos, and six Ferragamos.\n Maybe I\u0027ll forgive him...eventually.\n I\u0027m still waiting for this season\u0027s red Beverly Feldman pumps. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-22.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident. But what really bites (besides waking up in the morgue dressed in a pink suit and cheap shoes courtesy of her stepmother) is that she can\u0027t seem to stay dead. Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She\u0027s not taking too well to a liquid diet. \n Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn\u0027t the only temptation for Betsy. It\u0027s just a lot safer than the scrumptious Sinclair - a seductive bloodsucker whose sexy gaze seems as dangerous as a stake through the heart...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/undead-and-unwed-undead-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:01:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:19 PM"}}
