{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident. But what really bites (besides waking up in the morgue dressed in a pink suit and cheap shoes courtesy of her stepmother) is that she can\u0027t seem to stay dead. Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She\u0027s not taking too well to a liquid diet. \n Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn\u0027t the only temptation for Betsy. It\u0027s just a lot safer than the scrumptious Sinclair - a seductive bloodsucker whose sexy gaze seems as dangerous as a stake through the heart...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/undead-and-unwed-undead-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":22,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
