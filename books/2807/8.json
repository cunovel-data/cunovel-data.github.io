{"id":90890,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"I pulled into my driveway at 4:30 in the morning. There was a strange car parked on my street, a white Taurus. As I walked past I peeked inside and saw the bubble light. Cop. And when I entered my house I could smell Detective Nick Berry\u0027s clean, distinctive scent. Which, by the way, I\u0027d never been able to do before. Whenever I saw him at the station, all I could smell were stale croissants (the doughnut thing is a myth) and old coffee.\\n\\n He hurried out of my kitchen and stopped dead when he saw me. His jaw sagged and he made a motion toward the gun in his shoulder holster.\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s nice,\" I snapped. \"Don\u0027t you dare pull a gun on me in my own house. And where\u0027s your warrant?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t need one, seeing as how you\u0027re dead.\"\\n\\n \"Boy, Jessica just couldn\u0027t wait to tell you, could she?\" I\u0027d strangle her the next time I saw her. I said my undeath wasn\u0027t a secret, but I didn\u0027t mean she should run to the cops first thing. Her matchmaking was going to be the end of me. Well, probably not. \"That jerk...friends are such a mixed blessing.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t believe her-figured it was a rotten joke--but promised her I\u0027d check it out. Did you know it\u0027s against the law to fake your own death? The D.A.\u0027s gonna be pissed.\"\\n\\n \"Believe it or not, Nick, that is the least of my problems right now.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d been staring at me while we talked, and as I kicked off my tennis shoes he crossed the room. To my complete astonishment, he pulled me into his arms like a hero in a romance novel.\\n\\n \"God,\" he said, staring into my eyes. We were exactly the same height, so it was a little unnerving. His eyes were light brown, with green flecks. His pupils were huge. \"You\u0027re so beautiful.\"\\n\\n I was still frozen with amazement. Nick had touched me a few times-mostly to shake my hand, and once our fingers brushed when he handed me a Milky Way-but he\u0027d always been cool, pleasant, and nice. Nice Guy nice. I had sensed zero interest, which is why I\u0027d never pursued him-and why Jessica\u0027s hints and intimations were so annoying. But now-\\n\\n \"God,\" he said again, and kissed me. Except it was more like he was trying to swallow me. His tongue shoved into my mouth and suddenly I was breathing his breath. This was startling, but not unpleasant. Then: \"Ow!\" He jerked back and touched his lower lip, where a tiny drop of blood welled. \"You bit me.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry-you thtartled me. I mean, you took me by thurprise. Oh, thit.\" I could not look away from that tiny little crimson drop. It gleamed. It beckoned. It begged to be tasted. \"Nick, you thould go. Right now.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re so beautiful,\" he whispered, and kissed me again, more gently. I tasted his blood, and that was that. Had I thought I was thirsty before? The strongest, most compelling craving I had ever known completely took me over. I kissed him back, sucked on his lower lip, and then we were tearing at each other\u0027s clothes like a couple of horny teenagers. I heard the \u0027clunk\u0027 of his holster hitting the floor, heard the jingle of the coins in his pockets as his slacks hit the floor in a polyester puddle, heard the riiiiiiiiiiiip that meant I\u0027d need to buy a new t-shirt. I had no idea what had happened to my leggings. He could have eaten them for all I would have noticed.\\n\\n I tore my mouth from his, jerked his face to the side, and bit him on the side of the neck. I wasn\u0027t remotely horrified. There was no reticence at all, no maidenly shrinking at the thought of drinking his blood like it was a Cosmopolitan. I couldn\u0027t wait. I wouldn\u0027t wait.\\n\\n I\u0027d been prepared to really bite down, but my fangs slid through his skin like a laser scalpel, and then his blood was flooding my mouth. My knees buckled as my body truly came alive for the first time since that Aztek knocked me into a tree. Everything was suddenly loud and bright and vivid; Nick\u0027s heartbeat thundered in my ears. I could smell his sweat. I could smell his lust-like crisp shavings of cedar.\\n\\n I felt myself get slammed up against the wall and thought, oh, oh, Nick doesn\u0027t think much of this...poor bastard. However, my thoughts were wrong, because he grabbed me around the thighs, and then I felt him shove himself inside me, all at once, all the way.\\n\\n Now, I can count the number of sexual partners I\u0027ve had on one hand. On three fingers, in fact. Madame Slut I am not. And with every one, as with most women, it took time and manipulation to make me come. That whole three strokes and it\u0027s time to ride the orgasm train thing is a pure myth, and I feel sorry for women who believe it and then think there\u0027s something wrong with them when they need more than a slap and tickle to get off.\\n\\n That said, when Nick slammed into me, when he took his cock in hand and shoved me apart and entered me with a brutal thrust while his blood was in my mouth, I was instantly jolted into orgasm. It was a shallow one, the kind you get when you\u0027re diddling with yourself and squeeze your knees together at just the right moment, but a come is a come (I should stitch that on a sampler sometime). Drinking blood had made everything more there, all sensations were more intense and opened a vein of sensuality I never dreamed existed.\\n\\n He thrust, he shoved, his broad swimmer\u0027s chest was pressed up against mine hard enough to flatten my breasts. He was sweating and panting and groaning, and I realized I didn\u0027t need to drink anymore, my thirst was gone and I felt better than I ever had. I felt like jumping over the house. Maybe I even could.\\n\\n I stopped drinking and pulled back, licking the bite mark to get the last few drops. Nick throbbed between my legs and then he was collapsing out of me, clutching me with both hands as he fought to keep his feet. I could feel his come running down my thighs; it burned, probably because I was so cold. And I was shocked-I could have run (and won) a marathon, and poor Nick looked half dead.\\n\\n \"Oh, Jesus-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t,\" he whispered against my neck.\\n\\n \"Nick, I\u0027m so sorry, I-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t stop,\" he managed. \"Do more. Bite me. Again.\"\\n\\n The full impact of his request hit me, and in my horror I nearly dropped him. I suddenly remembered the church janitor...\\n\\n ...and the minister...\\n\\n ...and how odd they\u0027d seemed, odd but, as I was having such a strange night myself I\u0027d shrugged off their reactions. Now here was Nick, a perfectly pleasant man who had showed no interest in me except as a witness, Nick with his pants around his ankles and his dick in his hand and blood on his throat, Nick who wanted me to bite him again. Again!\\n\\n Not only could I live through car crashes and electrocution, not only could I toss grown men like they were magazines, but I could make men want me. They looked at me and wanted me, didn\u0027t care if I drained them dry as long as they could fuck me while I did it.\\n\\n I got ready to yowl with horror and frustration, when I got a grip...\\n\\n ...and instead picked Nick up and carried him to my room like he was a blonde, male Scarlett and I was an undead Rhett.\\n\\n \"So it\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n \"What is, Nick?\"\\n\\n \"Vampires.\"\\n\\n \"...yes. It\u0027s true. I\u0027m really, really sorry.\"\\n\\n He propped himself up on an elbow and looked down at me. We\u0027d been lying in bed, side by side, for about ten minutes. I was both relieved and frightened when he started talking. \"Don\u0027t be sorry. That was the best of my life. Did you-\" He paused. \"Did you get enough to...eat?\"\\n\\n I winced. \"Yes. I\u0027m fine. Thank you.\" And now, the incredible awkwardness between two acquaintances who decided to have sex and now have to chat. This was new to me. I\u0027d never fucked anyone I wasn\u0027t in love with before. And fucking was about all it was, too. \"Uh...are you okay?\"\\n\\n He touched his neck. I was amazed to see the bite mark was almost entirely healed. \"It hardly even hurts.\"\\n\\n \"Like a dog, I apparently have an enzyme in my saliva that speeds up healing.\"\\n\\n He burst out laughing. Oh, thank goodness. Then he was rolling over on top of me and nibbling my throat. \"Time for another drink?\" he asked, and the naked eagerness in his voice made my heart lurch.\\n\\n \"No.\" I pushed him, but he immediately settled back on top of me. \"Absolutely not.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind-\"\\n\\n \"Dammit! You do, I bet, way down deep inside you, you probably mind plenty. Nick, I bit you! I drank your blood and I didn\u0027t even ask.\"\\n\\n \"And I took you,\" he said quietly, \"and didn\u0027t even ask.\"\\n\\n I snorted. \"Trust me, you didn\u0027t do a thing I didn\u0027t allow. You couldn\u0027t have hurt me and you sure as shit can\u0027t force me.\"\\n\\n He was still lying on top of me and I could feel his groin pressing against mine; he was throbbing and hard as a pipe. Amazing! The guy had to be in his forties. \"Come on,\" he said coaxingly. \"Let me in...and I\u0027ll let you in.\"\\n\\n \"No no no. Never again, Detective Barry, absolutely not. It\u0027d be like rape. It is rape.\"\\n\\n He laughed at me, but stopped when I asked, \"How\u0027d you feel about me before I died?\"\\n\\n \"Uh...I thought you were great. Really cute, too.\"\\n\\n \"Ever want to slam me up against a wall and screw the bejeezus out of me while I drank your blood?\"\\n\\n \"Uh...\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. You never. But you\u0027re ready to go right now, and you don\u0027t even mind if I drink your blood while we screw. Hello? This is not normal behavior. It\u0027s not me you want. It\u0027s-it\u0027s whatever makes me a vampire. A supernatural gift or whatever-but it\u0027s not me. It\u0027s my undead pheromones. And that\u0027s why we\u0027re done.\"\\n\\n He protested, but I turned a deaf ear, helped him find his gun, dressed him, and had to bodily push him out my front door. Even so, he hammered on it for five minutes, begging to be let back in.\\n\\n I fled to my bedroom and put a pillow over my head, but I could still hear him.\\n\\n In the movies, vampires are always these all-powerful jerks who use people like Kleenex. Now I could see why. A clean-cut Boy Next Door nice guy who lets you drink his blood while he fucks you raw, then begs for more of the same, will let you do anything.\\n\\n Anything at all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-8.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \\n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor.
