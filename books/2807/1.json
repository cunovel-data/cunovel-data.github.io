{"id":90883,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The day I died started out bad and got worse in a hurry. I hit my snooze alarm a few too many times and was late for work. And didn\u0027t have time for breakfast. Okay, that\u0027s a lie, I gobbled a pair of chocolate Pop Tarts while waiting for the bus. My mom would have approved (who do you think got me hooked on the darned things?), but a nutritionist would have smacked me upside the head with her calorie counter. At a nine a.m. meeting I found out the recession (the one the President has been denying for two years) had hit me right between the eyes: I had been laid off. Not unexpected, but it hurt, just the same. They had to slash costs, and god forbid any of senior management be shown the door. Nope; the clerks and secretaries had been deemed expendable. I cleaned out my desk, avoided the way my co-workers were avoiding looking at me (the ones left, that is), and scuttled home. As I walked through my front door I saw my answering machine light winking at me like a small black dragon. The message was from my stepmonster: \"Your father and I won\u0027t be able to make it to your party tonight...I just realized we have an earlier commitment. Sorry.\" Sure you are, jerk. \"Have fun without us.\" No problem. \"Maybe you\u0027ll meet someone tonight.\" Translation: Maybe some poor slob will marry you and take you off my hands. My stepmonster had, from day one, related to me in only one way: as a rival for her new husband\u0027s affections. I went into the kitchen to feed my cat, and that\u0027s when I noticed she\u0027d run away again. Always looking for adventure, my Giselle (although it\u0027s more like I\u0027m her Betsy). I looked at the clock. My, my. Not even noon. Happy birthday to me. As it turned out, we had a freak April snowstorm, and my party was postponed. Just as well...I didn\u0027t feel like going out, putting on a happy face, and drinking one too many daiquiris. The Mall of America is a terrific place, but I\u0027ve got to be in the mood for crowds, overpriced retail merchandise, and six dollar drinks. Tonight I wasn\u0027t. Nick called around eight p.m., and that was my day\u0027s sole bright spot. Nick Berry was a detective who worked out of St. Paul. I\u0027d been attacked a couple of months before, and... Okay, well, \"attacked\" is putting it mildly. I don\u0027t like to talk about it-to think about it-but what happened was, a bunch of creeps jumped me as I was leaving Kahn\u0027s Mongolian Barbecue (all you can eat for $11.95, including salad, dessert, and free refills). I have no idea what they wanted-they didn\u0027t take my purse or try to rape me. Basically, they clawed and bit at me like a bunch of rabid squirrels while I fended them off with the toes of my Manolo Blahniks and screamed for help as loud as I could...so loud I couldn\u0027t speak above a whisper for three days. Help didn\u0027t come, but the bad guys ran away. Skittered away, actually. While I leaned against my car, concentrating on not passing out, I glanced back and it looked like a few of them were on all fours. Nick was assigned to the case, and he interviewed me in the hospital while they were disinfecting the bite marks. All fifteen of them. The intern who took care of me smelled like cilantro and kept humming the theme from Harry Potter. That was last fall. Since then, more and more people-they didn\u0027t discriminate between women and men-were being attacked. The last two had turned up dead. So, yeah, I was freaked out by what happened, and I\u0027d sworn off Kahn\u0027s until the bad guys were caught, but mostly I was grateful it hadn\u0027t been worse. Anyway, Nick called and we chatted and, long story short, I promised to come in to look through the Big Book O\u0027 Bad Guys one more time. And I would. For myself, to feel like I was being pro-active, but mostly to see Nick, who was exactly my height (six feet), dark blonde, swimmer\u0027s build, and looked like an escapee from a Mr. Hardbody calendar. I\u0027ve broken the law, Officer, take me in. Making Officer Nick my eye candy would be the closest I\u0027ve gotten to getting laid in...what year was it? Not that I\u0027m a prude. I\u0027m just picky. I treat myself to the nicest, most expensive shoes I can get my hands on, which isn\u0027t easy on a secretary\u0027s budget. I save up for months to buy the dumb things. And those only have to go on my feet. Yep, that\u0027s me in a nutshell: Elizabeth Taylor (don\u0027t start!), single, dead-end job (well, not anymore), lives with her cat. And I\u0027m so dull, the fucking cat runs away about three times a month just to get a little excitement. And speaking of the cat...I had just heard her telltale Riaaaooowwwww! from the street. Super! Giselle hated the snow. She had probably been looking for a little spring lovin\u0027 and gotten caught in the storm. Now she was outside waiting for rescue. And when I did rescue her, she\u0027d be horribly affronted and wouldn\u0027t make eye contact for the rest of the week. I slipped into my boots and headed into the yard. It was still snowing, but I could see Giselle crouched in the middle of the street like a small blob of shadow. One with amber-colored eyes. I wasted ten seconds calling her-why do I call cats?-then clomped through my yard into the street. Normally this wouldn\u0027t be a problem, as I live at the end of the block and it\u0027s a quiet street. However, in the snow on icy roads, the driver didn\u0027t see me in time. When he did, he did the absolutely worst thing: slammed on his brakes. That pretty much sealed my doom. Dying doesn\u0027t hurt. I know that sounds like a crock, some touchy-feely nonsense meant to make people feel better about biting the big one. But the fact is, your body is so traumatized by what\u0027s happening, it shuts down your nerve endings. Not only did dying not hurt, I didn\u0027t even feel the cold. And it was only ten degrees that night. I handled it badly, I admit. When I saw he was going to plow into me, I froze like a deer in the headlights. A big, dumb, blonde deer who had just paid for touch-up highlights. I couldn\u0027t move, not even to save my life. Giselle certainly could; the ungrateful little wretch scampered right the hell out of there. Me, I went flying. The car hit me at forty miles an hour, which was survivable, and knocked me into a tree, which was not. I heard things break. I heard my own skull shatter-it sounded like someone was chewing ice in my ear. I felt myself bleed. I felt my bladder let go involuntarily for the first time in twenty-six years. In the dark, my blood on the snow looked black. The last thing I saw was Giselle sitting on my porch, waiting for me to let her in. The last thing I heard was the driver, screaming for help.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-1.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident. But what really bites (besides waking up in the morgue dressed in a pink suit and cheap shoes courtesy of her stepmother) is that she can\u0027t seem to stay dead. Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She\u0027s not taking too well to a liquid diet. Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn\u0027t the only temptation for Betsy. It\u0027s just a lot safer than the scrumptious Sinclair - a seductive bloodsucker whose sexy gaze seems as dangerous as a stake through the heart...","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/undead-and-unwed-undead-1.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:01:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:19 PM"}}
