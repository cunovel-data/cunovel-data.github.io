{"id":90895,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"A few days passed without incident, which was apparently too much for my old pain in the ass, Jessica, and my new pain, Marc. The excitement of my return from the dead had died down, no vampire baddies had come knocking, my relationship with my stepmother and father remained the same (she ignored me, he sent checks), and that was just too darned staid for my pals. I introduced them and, after they bristled at each other for an hour, they decided to share me. I stayed the hell out of it. As long as they weren\u0027t fighting, I didn\u0027t care what the arrangements were. Jessica is strong-willed, duh, but she\u0027s also weirdly protective of me. She\u0027s always threatened when I make a new friend. I\u0027ve tried to explain that, no, I did not love all my friends equally, she was my absolute favorite and would be forever, amen, but it usually fell on deaf ears. And it was strictly a one-way street, at my insistence: Jessica had loads of society friends who wouldn\u0027t know me if I slapped them in the face. Marc, on the other hand, for all his renewed sense of purpose (and proposed conspiracy to assault child abusers), was still fragile and I wanted nothing said or done to him that might send him back up on the roof. He was staying with me while he looked for a new place, an arrangement that suited us nicely: I wanted a roomie who could move around during the day, and he needed a bed. Before I\u0027d died I never would have done such a thing. Not because I didn\u0027t care, but because I wouldn\u0027t dare. You just couldn\u0027t know about people, what was really in their hearts and what hid behind a smile. But along with an endless thirst for blood, I now had a pretty good radar. I just knew Marc was an all right guy. And frankly, I had never cared for living alone-which is why I had rescued Giselle from the animal shelter. I\u0027d watch too many scary movies and stay awake all night in terror, flinching at every creak. The thing that terrified me the most were zombie movies. After watching Resident Evil I had nightmares for a week. It was ironic, because now I was one of the unkillable monsters. Still didn\u0027t like living by myself, though. The three of us were adjusting, but there was a kind of balancing act for me to maintain between Jess and Marc. And so, because I wanted to keep the two neurotics happy, midnight found me in a private exam room at Minneapolis General, instead of checking out the Midnight Madness Shoe Sale at Neiman Marcus. \"Only for you,\" I had said to Jessica. \"And I guess you,\" I\u0027d added to Marc. There was one thing they both agreed upon: I was not your garden-variety vampire, and the more we knew about my abilities, the better. Marc wanted to get a \"baseline,\" whatever the hell that was, and Jessica was just plain curious, so Marc got us a room at the hospital and the exam began. \"I\u0027m not taking off any of my clothes,\" I warned him. Marc rolled his eyes. \"Aw, gee, I guess no big thrill for me tonight.\" \"For any of us,\" Jessica said dryly. \"The girl\u0027s the color of a toad\u0027s belly and she needs her roots done.\" \"I do not!\" I said, shocked. \"I had those done two weeks before I died. My roots are fine.\" \"I wonder what would happen if you cut your hair?\" Marc asked thoughtfully, slipping a thermometer under my tongue. \"Would it stay short forever? Would it grow back? Could it grow back? Would it magically reappear the next night?\" He was staring so thoughtfully at my hair I leaned as far away from him as far as I could. \"So this Sinclair...he wants to take you under his wing?\" Jessica asked. She was rocketing around the exam room on the doctor\u0027s stool. She\u0027d zoom up to a wall, kick off, and careen to the other side. Marc was obviously used to odd antics during an exam, but it was making me claustrophobic as hell. She had officially given up mourning colors for me, and tonight she was sporting green leggings, a buttercup yellow t-shirt, and a salmon-colored raincoat. \"Teach you the vamp ropes?\" \"God, he is so hot,\" Marc muttered. By contrast, he was a moving pile of rags in torn jeans and a faded t-shirt with the logo \"Come Along Quietly\"-an alarming choice for a physician. He peered at the thermometer, cleared it, then promptly stuck it in my mouth again. \"By the way, I tested all the equipment on myself before you guys got here, so we know it works...now what were we talking about? Oh, yeah-Sinclair. You should see this guy, Jessica. He looks like the Prince of Darkness and he moves like a matador. I was sweating just looking at him.\" \"Yum,\" Jessica said, impressed. \"Don\u0027t forget, he\u0027s a hundred years old,\" I sneered. \"More like sixty-three, so he\u0027s got a lifetime of wisdom and street smarts, not to mention years of experience fucking every which way a guy can think up, to go with a nice, hard, powerful, eternally young body. Jesus, I\u0027m gonna have to quit talking about this before I need to sit down.\" \"Please,\" I said thinly. I hadn\u0027t thought about the experience factor minus the ick factor of a wrinkled, decrepit body. Which was probably hiding under those superbly tailored suits! \"Besides, it doesn\u0027t matter a purple crap what Sinclair wants. I\u0027m not playing vamp politics. I\u0027m minding my own business, and he sure as shit better mind his.\" \"Or you\u0027ll throw him through a concrete cross again,\" Jessica added. \"I wish I could have seen it!\" \"No you don\u0027t. The whole thing was alternatively stupid and frightening. If that\u0027s what I can expect from being in a vamp tribe, count me out.\" Twenty minutes later, Marc was finished. He was looking at me a little strangely, which I pretended not to notice. He had watched me climb a building with little surprise, handled being my dinner well enough, and insinuated himself into my home with no fuss, but the scientist in him was finally facing black-and-white facts, and that was a little daunting. \"Well.\" He cleared his throat. \"Your blood pressure is ten over five, your Babinski reflex is nonexistent, your temperature is eighty-which is why your handshake is so darned clammy--respirations are four, and your pulse is six. All incompatible with life. Which means you have to watch your ass, Bets-if you\u0027re found during the day and somebody freaks and calls an ambulance, a doctor is going to pronounce you at the scene, and then it\u0027s hello, morgue.\" Jessica was staring. \"You only take a breath four times a minute?\" \"I guess,\" I said defensively. \"I don\u0027t think about it. I mean, c\u0027mon...do you think about your breathing, unless you\u0027ve got a cold or something?\" \"And she\u0027s not clammy,\" Jess said loyally. \"Touching her is-is like lying in a cool shade.\" \"Clammy,\" I said glumly. \"Nice save on the shade thing, though.\" \"But. Although your vitals are incompatible with life, you\u0027re super strong, inhumanly agile, and on a liquid diet. There\u0027s very little activity at a cellular level-so you\u0027ve stopped aging. Not to mention excreting. You haven\u0027t taken a piss since you died-which makes no sense, because you drink liquids all day long-you don\u0027t sweat, and you don\u0027t cry. Jessica said you can\u0027t drink canned blood. So there must be something about fresh-living-blood that keeps you going. Is it the electrolytes? The pure energy found in living cells...? I wonder if you harness the--\" \"You can\u0027t use science to explain everything,\" Jessica broke in. \"There\u0027s probably some mystical shit going on, too.\" I laughed. \"Mystical shit? Is that a technical term?\" We were shrugging into our coats, shutting off the lights, and heading out a side door as quietly as possible. Marc wasn\u0027t scheduled to work tonight, and he didn\u0027t feel up to answering awkward questions about the talking dead girl on the exam table. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never believed in this stuff. Not ever...shit, I don\u0027t even read science fiction. But some of the stuff I\u0027ve seen at the hospital...as a species, we\u0027re incredibly adaptable. We can survive a lot of stuff that would kill just about anything else. Maybe you\u0027re a mutation. Maybe a vampire is just another word for--\" \"Mutant freak. Very comforting.\" \"Man oh man, the paper I could write about this,\" Marc said. \"I\u0027d be famous...right before they checked me into the psych ward for a pleasant year of pureed apricots and finger painting.\" That gave all of us the giggles. The door slammed behind us and we started walking through the alley toward the street, when all hell broke loose. I sensed the problem before Jessica and Marc did-those two didn\u0027t have a clue until the bitch was on us-but I wasn\u0027t fast enough. There was a blur and then a small, dark-haired woman with the bluest eyes I\u0027d ever seen had Marc. She\u0027d locked a forearm across his neck and was bending him back so his throat was at the level of her mouth. Jessica was facedown in the snow-while grabbing Marc, Shorty had shoved her into the wall, knocking her out. \"The infamous Betsy,\" Shorty purred. She was small, probably about five feet tall. Maybe ninety pounds. And clearly as strong as an ox on steroids. Her face was unremarkable, even plain-average nose, bare bump of a chin, narrow forehead-but her eyes were astonishing and lovely. Large and the color of a spring sky, they were fringed with dark, sooty lashes. Her canines were growing while I watched. \"At last we meet.\" Annoyingly, she did not lisp. \"Friend of yours?\" Marc managed. Half of his air was being cut off and he was bent so far back he was staring at the stars. He had to be scared shitless, but his tone was just right: casual, unconcerned. I was very, very proud of him. Frankly, I hadn\u0027t known he was brave until just now. \"Maybe an old school-glkk!-chum?\" \"I\u0027ve never seen her before. Listen, Tootsie Roll, you want to let go of my friend before I jam a cross up your ass.\" She laughed and tightened her grip. Marc gasped, but didn\u0027t say anything. She licked the side of his throat and he shuddered while at the same time leaning into her. \"Oh-ho, this one\u0027s had a taste, yes? No wonder you\u0027re keeping him close.\" \"He\u0027s my lunch. Go grab your own.\" I took a casual step forward, and she bit him. Savagely-there was none of my tentativeness or care. She ripped off an inch-wide swath of skin, spit it out, then gulped back the blood like a dog sucked down water on a hot day. Marc screamed. I did a little screaming of my own. \"Stop it!\" I was reeling from the suddenness of the confrontation. A minute earlier we were just stepping outside, for God\u0027s sake. Even the cemetery meeting hadn\u0027t been this alarming. \"What do you want?\" She stopped drinking. \"You, of course. Your presence is requested by my master.\" \"Nosehair?\" Her nostrils flared. Blood gleamed on her chin. I actually wanted to lick it off, how\u0027s that for sick and disgusting? I could feel my teeth growing, seeming to fill my mouth. I was so embarrassed I couldn\u0027t look at Marc. \"Is that supposed to be a joke?\" \"No! I\u0027m jutht really bad at nameth.\" \"What\u0027s wrong with your voice?\" \"Never mind. You were thaying about your mathter...?\" \"Nostro desires your company. He told me to use any means to persuade you. Now, I will...\" \"Okay.\" She faltered a bit. \"What?\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll go with you. We can go right now.\" \"Oh.\" She considered for a long moment. Obviously she\u0027d expected more resistance. She released Marc, who just about broke something scrambling away from her. He went immediately to Jessica, knelt, and fumbled at her neck for a pulse. \"Very well. Come with me now.\" \"Marc.\" My fangs were retracting...thank God. \"You find a pulse?\" He looked up at me, shivering from the adrenaline rush. \"Yes, I think she\u0027s all right-just knocked out.\" Congratulations, Short Stuff, maybe you\u0027ll live through the next hour. \"Okay. Take her to the ER. Get her looked at, and have somebody take a look at your neck. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"It\u0027s not your fault. I\u0027ll make up something good. I\u0027ll tell the attending we were mugged, or something.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I started walking out of the alley. Shorty watched, a look of amused scorn on her nasty little face. \"I\u0027ll be back later.\" \"Not necessarily,\" Short Stuff tittered. \"Shut the fuck up, you cunt.\" I\u0027d never used the C word before tonight, but she seemed an ideal representation of it. And the shocked look on her face-as if I\u0027d slapped her, which I sort of had, only with a word instead of my hand-was almost worth how awful I felt about what she had done to my friends. And oh, sweetie, you want to watch out if I catch you with your guard down... But she was a spear-carrier, a soldier. Nostro had sent her to me, had told her to do whatever she could to gain my attendance. His was the hash I had to settle first.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-13.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident.

Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn\u0027t the only temptation for Betsy.
