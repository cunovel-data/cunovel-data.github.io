{"id":90897,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The someone was a girl. Well, she could have been a hundred years old for all I knew, but she looked as if she\u0027d be carded for buying cigarettes. Although it was quite dark in the pit, my undead eyeballs were working just great, and I could make out her delicate, pale features: sharp chin, high cheekbones, and big dark eyes. Pansy eyes, I think they\u0027re called, large and pretty and fringed with beautifully sooty lashes. We stood in the pit together and stared at each other. She looked so young, so fresh; if she\u0027d whipped out a pair of pom-poms and started cheering I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised.\\n\\n Instead, she dropped to her knees and bowed so low her forehead was scraping the pit\u0027s bottom. \"Majesty, I beg your forgiveness...I couldn\u0027t help you upstairs, there were too many of them.\"\\n\\n \"Get up, don\u0027t call me that, and don\u0027t sweat it. Jeez, will you get up? This floor is disgusting.\" I shifted tentatively; yup. My shoes were definitely sticking. It was like being in a movie theater after a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. \"Seriously: get up.\" I bent, seized her arm, pulled her upright.\\n\\n \"Majesty-\"\\n\\n \"Betsy.\"\\n\\n \"Queen Betsy-\"\\n\\n \"Bet. See.\"\\n\\n She looked away from me, then shyly glanced back. \"I can\u0027t. Could you call Elizabeth the Second \u0027Betsy\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Well, no,\" I admitted, \"although someone probably should. And I\u0027m not the queen.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" she said mysteriously.\\n\\n I let that pass. \"Where are we? I mean, why am I down here? Is this like the dungeon?\"\\n\\n \"If only, Majesty. The Master keeps his Fiends down here. Even now he is rushing to pull the lever. The cage doors will go up, and the Fiends will be upon us.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s a helluva note.\" I was a little nervous, but not out-and-out terrified. Not yet. I found the cheerleader extremely interesting. Why did she jump in with me? And why did she have the idea in her head that I was a queen? I wasn\u0027t even a Leo. \"The walls are pretty steep in here...I\u0027m betting this is so we don\u0027t have time to climb out. Any suggestions?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" The cheerleader was digging in her jeans pocket and came up with a small, thickly padded envelope, the kind you mail discs in. She practically threw it at me, so anxious was she to get rid of it. \"For you. Only you can wield this.\"\\n\\n \"Uh...thanks. Gee, I don\u0027t have anything for you.\" I opened the envelope and peeped inside. And smiled. I upended the envelope and felt the cool gold chain slide into my hand. It was a beautiful gold cross on a chain so fine even I, with my super orbs, had trouble seeing it. I put it on, feeling the teensy clasp with my fingers and getting it hooked around my neck after a few seconds of fumbling. \"Thanks a lot. I left mine at home.\"\\n\\n \"This is why you\u0027re the queen. Or you will be. You were foretold, you know.\"\\n\\n \"No I don\u0027t know...and who are you, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Tina.\"\\n\\n \"Thank goodness!\" I said so loudly she stepped back. \"No silly-ass overdone names for you, m\u0027girl.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s short for Christina Caresse Chavelle.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you did the best you could.\"\\n\\n I heard a creaking noise just then, a really obnoxious one; it was like hinges clotted with dirt were turning in torturous slowness. The sound made me want to clap both hands over my ears. I didn\u0027t, though. No need to start losing coolness points with Tina who had, after all, jumped into a pitch-dark pit with me and brought me a present. \"What the heck is that?\"\\n\\n \"The gate is going up. The Fiends are out.\" Tina said this in a perfectly placid tone, but she was nibbling at her lower lip. \"Don\u0027t be afraid.\"\\n\\n \"Are you talking to me, or yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Both,\" she admitted. She glanced up at me-boy, she was tiny. Barely up to my shoulder, and just as cute as a bug. \"They will come at you but over my body, Majesty.\"\\n\\n I tried not to laugh. \"Thank you, Tina, but that\u0027s not very Queen-ey, is it? Cowering behind someone smaller?\"\\n\\n There was a rushing noise, like wind through capes, and I saw their eyes in the dark, little sullen coals. I counted ten coals. Clearly the pit had an entrance, other than the top. But the other end was blocked, or the Fiends would be gamboling out in the moonlight like big evil puppies. If we dealt with them (big freaking if), we\u0027d have time to climb out, but what then?\\n\\n Tina stepped in front of me just as the first fiend reached us. For once I was sorry I could see so well in the dark. They were vaguely human-like the devil is vaguely human. Although they had two legs, they scrabbled about on all fours. Their hair was, to a man (or a woman...their sex was indistinguishable), long and lank and kept flopping into their eyes. Their mouths were all fangs: toothy and sharp and terrifying to contemplate. Their cheeks were so hollow they\u0027d be the envy of any supermodel. They were wearing rags, unbelievably filthy and pitiful rags, and tho\u0027 they were there to put the hurt on me, I felt a stab of sympathy all the same. These things were Nostro\u0027s pets, and he wasn\u0027t taking good care of them.\\n\\n \"Back off, boys,\" I said, my voice booming around the small walls. \"You don\u0027t want to mess with an out-of-work secretary. We\u0027re real testy.\"\\n\\n The Fiends cringed away from me, but I doubt it was because of my threat. And I suddenly realized I could see a lot better than a few seconds ago.\\n\\n The cross. The cross around my neck was glowing.\\n\\n Not much. Not blazing with a pure white light like they do in the movies. The glow was feeble and yellowish and the cross wasn\u0027t burning me, wasn\u0027t even warm, but the Fiends couldn\u0027t bear it. Neither could Tina; she\u0027d thrown her arms over her face.\\n\\n \"Wait a minute!\" The hair...the scrabbling motions...the way they were more animal than human...I knew these things. \"You attacked me! You guys attacked me outside Kahn\u0027s last fall!\" I wanted to fall down. I wanted to kick them in their evil ribs. It was a shocking idea, unbelievable, but I suddenly knew how I\u0027d come to be a vampire. These...things...had infected me. Then along came the Aztek a few months later, and whatever the Fiends had put into my bloodstream from the scratches and nips had become active.\\n\\n Was that why most anti-vamp things didn\u0027t work on me? Because I didn\u0027t die by a vampire\u0027s hand, I\u0027d only been infected by one? Or five?\\n\\n I shook myself like a dog to get my head clear-I\u0027d been standing there like a dummy, my mouth sprung ajar, but this wasn\u0027t the time. The Fiends were still cringing away from me, from the cross. I knew now why Nostro had thrown me down here-these ornery little fellas would have torn a regular newborn vamp to pieces. There but for the bravery of Tina would I be kibble for the Fiends.\\n\\n \"Get out of here,\" I said softly, and took a step forward. They scuttled back, then turned and fled.\\n\\n \"Come on, shortcake,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s get out of this fucking hole. And I\u0027ve got a few choice words for your boss.\"\\n\\n \"Nostro isn\u0027t my boss,\" Tina said. I tucked the cross into my shirt and she slowly lowered her arms. \"You are.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk about it later. Come on.\"\\n\\n It was short work for us to climb out of the pit. The walls were made of brick, and there were plenty of vampire-friendly crevices. Nobody was standing guard-Nostro was pretty confident we\u0027d been chomped, then. Tina knew the back way out, and I followed her. I had a rather large problem with her next suggestion, though.\\n\\n \"No fucking way!\"\\n\\n \"Please, Majesty-\"\\n\\n \"Betsy, dammit!\"\\n\\n \"-it\u0027s for your safety. Sinclair must know what Nostro tried to do. And what he could not do. This is the chance to band together and defeat him once and for all. If you join Sinclair, Nostro will be destroyed.\"\\n\\n \"I hate that creep.\"\\n\\n \"Which one?\"\\n\\n \"Both, frankly, but especially that snooty jerkoff, Sink Lair.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" I had the sense Tina was choosing her words carefully. \"If you help us defeat Nostro, you will be the reigning queen. You could order the jerkoff to leave town.\"\\n\\n \"Now that\u0027s a little more like it. Although I have no queen qualifications.\"\\n\\n \"Untrue,\" she said quietly. \"I saw. You were foretold.\"\\n\\n We were driving steadily south. Some fool had left his keys in a handy unlocked Lexus, so we climbed in and off we went. I didn\u0027t feel terribly bad-served him right for living in a vampire neighborhood, anyway. Probably was a vampire. Besides, I\u0027d leave the car in a safe place, and have Marc or Jessica call the owner. After what I\u0027d been through this week, it was tough to break a sweat over a little grand theft auto.\\n\\n \"Foretold,\" I said, clutching the armrest as Tina took the turn nearly on two wheels. \"You said that before.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a book. We-vampires-call it the Tabla Morto. The book of the dead. A thousand years ago, vampires knew you were coming. \u0027A Queen shall ryse, who has powyer beyond that of the vampyre. The thyrst shall not consume her, and the cross never will harm her, and the beasts will befryend her, and she will rule the dead.\u0027\" Tina nodded in satisfaction.\\n\\n \"My!\" I coughed. That bit about the beasts...it explained the dogs. During the short walk to the car, every dog in the neighborhood had broken free and come to see me. Tina was wide-eyed while I swore and scolded and tried to gently boot them away. When we drove off they were barking enthusiastically at our taillights. Real subtle getaway. \"What a lovely story.\"\\n\\n Tina didn\u0027t crack a smile. \"That\u0027s you, Majesty. You\u0027re the first vampire in a thousand years who could hold a cross without screaming or throwing up or being burned. Nostro threw holy water in your face and you laughed. You laughed.\" She said this in a tone of complete admiration. \"The dogs do your will-\"\\n\\n \"The hell they do. They never leave when I tell them to. Just lick my ankles and slobber on my shoes. My shoes!\"\\n\\n She quirked a little curl of a smile at me. \"They don\u0027t leave because they know you\u0027re not truly angry with them. They just want to be near you. Best get used to it.\"\\n\\n \"Super.\" And here I figured I\u0027d had a lot to think about in the pit! Tonight was blowing all my circuits. \"If that\u0027s true, if I\u0027m the foretold SuperVamp, how come you\u0027re the only one who knows it? Why were you the only one who came in the pit with me? And thank you a thousand times, by the way. That was really brave. I didn\u0027t know what I was getting into, but you did, and you came down anyway.\" I touched her shoulder. \"Thanks a lot. If you need a favor, sunshine, you come and see me first.\"\\n\\n She gave me the biggest smile I\u0027d ever seen. \"Oh, Majesty, it was nothing! It was the very least I could do for you! If I could have gone in the pit alone, I would have.\" The smile disappeared as quickly as it had shown up. \"As to your question, the reason I was the only one to come with you is because Nostro\u0027s followers are a pack of fucking cowards.\"\\n\\n \"Tina!\" Not that I\u0027d never heard the F word before, but it sounded especially bad coming out of that cute mouth, that sweet face. Plus, the way she switched from formal English to 21st century jargon was jarring, to put it mildly.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t fight,\" she said stubbornly. \"They do only what he says. Even if it means hurting innocents. Also, you\u0027re more myth than reality. Like the second coming of You-Know-Who.\"\\n\\n \"Christ?\"\\n\\n She flinched, but nodded. \"Yes. Him. Everyone knows about it, but how many people really truly believe it? Or would recognize That Person if He were to return? They talk about miracles, about walking on water, but if I ever saw someone doing it, I\u0027d be so afraid. So would a lot of people, I think. Well, that\u0027s like you, Majesty. Every vampire knows about you...but hardly anyone believes.\"\\n\\n \"What about Sinclair?\"\\n\\n \"He was the first to suspect who you could be. One of his men called you, asked you to come to the bookstore...remember, the night you were kidnapped?\"\\n\\n \"Which night?\" I grumbled. \"Getting hard to keep track.\" But I remembered. So Sinclair\u0027s henchman had called me, not Nostro\u0027s. But there was obviously a spy in camp, because Nostro\u0027s men got to me first. Sinclair must have busted a gut to get to the mausoleum before I did. I remembered noticing his shoes, trying to get a closer look at them. He\u0027d been leaving tracks, as though he\u0027d arrived only seconds before I did. \"So you work for Sinclair?\"\\n\\n \"He saved me from Nostro,\" she said simply. \"If not for him, I\u0027d be one of those spiritless creatures.\"\\n\\n \"I gotta tell you, Tina, it creeps me out that you work for ole Jerkoff. What, you\u0027re like his runner or something?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m his servant, yes.\"\\n\\n \"So he\u0027s like Nostro.\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m with him because I choose to be with him. If I wanted to leave tomorrow and live in France and never do another thing for him, he wouldn\u0027t demur. I made him, you see.\"\\n\\n The car seemed to shrink, suddenly. I stared at her, and she stared through the windshield. \"You made Sinclair a vampire?\" I practically squeaked it.\\n\\n \"Yes. I was desperate. Nostro hardly ever lets us feed, it\u0027s his way of controlling us, making sure no one gets stronger than him.\"\\n\\n \"Jerkoff,\" I commented.\\n\\n \"Indeed. I found Sinclair in a cemetery at night. His parents had died that week. Been murdered. He was alone in the world. He saw me...I was too hungry for stealth and he saw me.\"\\n\\n Tina\u0027s voice was getting softer; she could hardly get the words out. It was as if she was desperately ashamed of her actions that night, so long ago. \"He opened his arms. He invited me to him. He knew I was one of the monsters and he didn\u0027t care. And I-I took him. I killed him.\"\\n\\n \"Well...uh...that\u0027s what you guys do, right?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"That\u0027s another thing forbidden...we\u0027re only allowed to make more vampires if we have Nostro\u0027s permission, but I was starving and I didn\u0027t care. I was waiting for Sinclair when he rose.\"\\n\\n I digested that one for a while. \"Wow.\" I didn\u0027t like the story for a number of reasons, and big number one was because it made me feel sorry for Sinclair. I could picture the scene-him in a black suit, pale with grief, alone, not caring about anything anymore. And Tina coming up to him, stick-thin and ghastly white and shaking with hunger. And how he took her in at a glance and opened his arms to her, welcomed her. \"Wow. That\u0027s...that\u0027s really something. And he got you away from Nostro.\"\\n\\n \"Sinclair was strong the moment he awoke. Some-a few--are like that, you know. His will...it\u0027s incredible. Nostro didn\u0027t want to mess with him, nobody did. So he let Sinclair go, and Sinclair took me with him. And that\u0027s how it\u0027s been, for years and years.\"\\n\\n \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n \"I was born,\" she said, taking a sharp left and driving down a dirt road-when had we left the city?-\"the month and year the Civil War began.\" \"Wuh...hmm. Okay, my mom\u0027s really into the Civil War and I\u0027ll have about a thousand questions for you later, but meanwhile-how old is Nosehair?\"\\n\\n She giggled at that, but abruptly snapped off the sound, as if it was dangerous to laugh at him, even miles away from his lakeside lair. \"No one knows. From his strength, I would guess at least four hundred years. Maybe more.\"\\n\\n \"His strength?\"\\n\\n \"I told you Sinclair was born strong, but for most vampires, strength is acquired. The longer you feed, the more you learn, the stronger you become. An eighty year-old man has more life experience than you, yes? They\u0027ve-uh-been around the block? Now: picture the old man in a young body that never gets tired, with limitless strength and speed.\"\\n\\n \"Gotcha.\" Unlike most of what had happened to me lately, this made perfect sense.\\n\\n \"So a three hundred year old vampire is much, much stronger than the vampire who died yesterday. I suspect Sinclair was an extraordinary man when he was alive, because he was strong so quickly after death.\"\\n\\n \"Oooooooh, Tina! Sounds like you\u0027ve got the hots for the boss.\"\\n\\n She smiled at me. \"No, Majesty. I admire him a great deal, but as for the rest...I gave that up a hundred years ago.\"\\n\\n \"That may be the most depressing thing I\u0027ve heard this week, cutie. Uh...sorry.\" The woman was old enough to be my great-great-great-great grandma, even if she looked like she just made the pep squad. Time to 86 the condescending nicknames.\\n\\n \"Majesty, you may call me Mistress Putz if you prefer. It\u0027s a pure pleasure to just be in your company.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough of that.\" If I\u0027d been able to blush, I would have. \"And I still haven\u0027t agreed to go to Sinclair\u0027s house.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re here,\" she said apologetically, as the gates swung open. We scooted through, fast enough to press me back into my seat, but when I heard the gates crash closed I knew why.\\n\\n \"Damn! The guy doesn\u0027t leave the front door open very long, does he?\" \"He\u0027s a careful man,\" was all she said.\\n\\n I mumbled something in reply, and I\u0027m pretty sure Tina caught the word \u0027jackass\u0027, but she was too polite to comment.\\n\\n We pulled right up to the front of the house-it was a gorgeous red Victorian, but after Nostro\u0027s palace and, of course, growing up with a zillionaire pal, I was getting pretty bored with grand beautiful manors. Why didn\u0027t anybody live in tract housing?\\n\\n Tina shut off the car, scooted around the front, then held my door open for me before I\u0027d even realized we\u0027d stopped. \"Quit that,\" I said, stepping out.\\n\\n \"Like the dogs,\" she said with a smile, \"I know you don\u0027t entirely mean it. Shall I carry you up the steps, Majesty?\"\\n\\n \"Only if you want to feel my foot up your ass,\" I warned, and she grinned. I was glad to see it. Tina was a little intimidating. And old! Sure, Nostro was old, too, ditto Sinclair, but the difference was, I kind of liked Tina. It was too bad...she wouldn\u0027t think I was so swell if she knew I lisped when I was hungry. The door opened as she approached, and we were ushered inside by a man who was maybe an inch taller than Tina. He had a small, sleek head and a pencil-thin mustache. His eyes were small and set close together, and his features were almost delicate...he looked like a clever whippet. He was wearing a billowy white shirt, black tailored pants, and small leather boots. Super dapper. \"Hi,\" I said to the top of his head, because when he saw me he went into a deep bow. \"I\u0027m Betsy.\"\\n\\n That straightened him up in a hurry. \"Betsy?\"\\n\\n \"Donald...\" Tina warned.\\n\\n \"You mean the future queen of the undead-my future queen--is named Betsy?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, it\u0027s a family name,\" I said defensively. \"And I\u0027m not going to be the queen of anything; I\u0027ve got enough problems of my own without taking responsibility for a bunch of two-legged parasites. And will somebody get these dogs away from me?\" To add to Sinclair\u0027s odious qualities, he apparently kept a hundred dogs. On closer inspection, it was more like six, all big fat black labs. All slobbery. Thank God I was wearing last year\u0027s shoes!\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a shock, that\u0027s all,\" Donald said, looking me up and down. \"You\u0027re-different from what I expected.\" Then, \"Did you just call me a two-legged parasite?\"\\n\\n \"Donald, help me with the dogs,\" Tina ordered. She looked stern, but as soon as she hustled the dogs into the other room I heard her laughing. At me, Donald, or the big stupid dogs, I had no idea. Probably all three.\\n\\n I looked around the entryway. It was a room unto itself, with soaring ceilings and a glorious staircase that looked like it had been lifted from one of the houses in Gone with the Wind. God, I loved that book. How could I not? The heroine was a trendy, vain jerk. I read GWTW about ten times the year I stumbled across it in high school, and twice a year since then. Sinclair\u0027s staircase looked like the one in Twelve Oaks.\\n\\n Tina came hurrying out, dog-less. \"If you\u0027ll stay here, Maj-Miss Taylor-I\u0027ll let Sinclair know you\u0027re here. Donald will get you anything you need.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I surely will.\" Donald had finally remembered his manners. \"Tea? Coffee? Wine?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d love a glass of plum wine,\" I admitted.\\n\\n He blinked, then smiled. \"Of course. The boss likes that stuff, too. Not me, though. It\u0027s like drinking sugar syrup out of a wine glass.\"\\n\\n I followed him to the wet bar in the corner. \"That\u0027s why I like it. Most wines taste like sour grape juice to me. Plum\u0027s the only stuff that\u0027s sweet enough.\" I glanced up at the ceiling and saw the mirror over the wet bar. \"Jeez, that mirror\u0027s bigger than my whole bedroom.\"\\n\\n Donald followed my gaze and lowered his voice. \"I\u0027ll tell you, Miss Betsy, I was shocked when I rose and found out I still cast a reflection. It took me days to get over it. I felt like all those movies had betrayed me.\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t we cast reflections?\" He cracked a brand-new bottle for me, poured, and handed me the glass. I sniffed-yum! It smelled like sugar and dark purple plums bursting with ripeness.\\n\\n \"Well. Because of not having a soul.\"\\n\\n \"We have souls. Sure we do. Otherwise we\u0027d do bad things all the time. You know, like politicians.\"\\n\\n He dropped the trendy butler attitude and stared at me with what looked a lot like hope. It made him seem much younger. \"Do you really think so?\"\\n\\n \"I know so.\" I said this with complete conviction, and added, \"Besides, a minister told me. Also, that whole \u0027vampires don\u0027t cast reflections because they have no soul\u0027 makes no sense. I mean, look up.\" He obeyed. \"D\u0027you see the bar? How about the bottles? And the floor? And the chair in the corner? Under the movie theory, we shouldn\u0027t be able to see those in the mirror.\"\\n\\n \"...true. But that doesn\u0027t exactly make your case about vampires keeping their souls.\"\\n\\n \"You make my case. And so do I. I mean, you probably hated blue jeans before you died, right?\"\\n\\n He actually shuddered.\\n\\n \"Right, easy, don\u0027t yark all over the bar. Well, you\u0027re not sporting any now, right? You don\u0027t have a pile of Levi\u0027s squirreled away in the back of your closet, do you? The stuff that made you you...it\u0027s all still there. You\u0027re just on a liquid diet now.\" I took a gulp of my wine. \"Like me!\"\\n\\n \"You know, there\u0027s something there,\" he said thoughtfully, but he wasn\u0027t looking up at the mirror, he was looking at me. He topped off my glass. \"Some sort of odd charisma. Even when you\u0027re being a pill, I like listening to you.\" \"Uh...thank you?\"\\n\\n \"Frankly, Sinclair and Tina are about the only vampires I can stand.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t been one very long. Maybe that\u0027s what it is.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not,\" he said seriously, \"because young vampires are the worst. All they can think about is how hungry they are. You can\u0027t have a civilized conversation with them for at least five years.\"\\n\\n \"Bummer!\" How had I managed to escape that fate? Oh, yeah...I was the superqueen. \"Listen, what\u0027s taking Tina so long? Where\u0027s Sinclair?\"\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s feeding with his ladyfriends.\" He said it just like that, all one word. \"I\u0027ll see if I can give Tina a hand.\" He put the bottle away, then hurried up the stairs. \"Excuse me, I\u0027ll be right back,\" he said over his shoulder, then got to the top and disappeared around a corner.\\n\\n I let a minute go by, then said, \"Well, screw this.\" I drained my glass, put it down...and then I heard the scream.\\n\\n I bolted up the stairs after Donald. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-15.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \\n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor.
