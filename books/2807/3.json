{"id":90885,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I am nothing if not persistent. Flinging myself into the Mississippi didn\u0027t work: I no longer needed to breathe. I floundered around on the muddy river bottom for half an hour before giving up and slogging my way back to shore. Neither did grounding myself while I held onto a live power line (though it did awful things to my hair). I drank a bottle of bleach, and the only consequence was a startling case of dry mouth. I shoplifted a butcher knife from the nearby Wal-Mart-the place to shop if you\u0027re dead, it\u0027s three a.m., and you don\u0027t have any credit cards-and stabbed myself in the heart: nothing.\\n\\n I was walking dispiritedly down Lake Street, trying to figure out how to decapitate myself, when I heard low voices and what sounded like muffled crying. I almost moved on-didn\u0027t I have problems of my own?-when good sense returned and I walked through the alley and around the corner. I saw three men hulking around a woman. She was holding hands with a big-eyed girl. The girl looked about six or so. Fear made the woman look about fifty. Her purse was lying on the ground between them. Nobody moved to get it, and I had a quick, clear thought: she tossed it at them, and tried to run, and they cornered her. They don\u0027t want her purse. They want-\\n\\n \"Please,\" she said, almost whispered, and I thought the acoustics must be very good, for me to have heard them from almost a block away. \"Don\u0027t do anything to me in front of my daughter. I\u0027ll go with you-I\u0027ll do whatever you want, just please, please-\"\\n\\n \"Mommy, don\u0027t leave me here by myself!\" The girl\u0027s eyes were light brown, almost whiskey-colored, and when they filled with tears I felt something lurch inside my dead heart. \"Just-you go away, bad men! Leave my mommy alone!\"\\n\\n \"Shhh, Justine, shhh...\" The woman was trying to pry her daughter\u0027s fingers free and made a ghastly attempt at a laugh. \"She\u0027s tired-it\u0027s late-I\u0027ll go with you-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t want you,\" one of the men said, his eyes on the girl. Justine burst into fresh tears, but not before kicking the ground, raining pebbles and grit on the man\u0027s feet.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you back to my car-the engine\u0027s dead but I could-with all of you, just don\u0027t-don\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"Hey, assholes!\" I said cheerfully. The five of them jumped, which surprised me...I wasn\u0027t the world\u0027s quietest walker. I couldn\u0027t believe I was doing this. I wasn\u0027t exactly the confrontational type. On the other hand, what did I possibly have to lose? \"Er...you three assholes. Not the lady and the kid. Fellas, could you come over here and kill me, please?\"\\n\\n Hugely relieved, Justine smiled at me, revealing the gap where she\u0027d lost one of her baby teeth. Then the men moved forward, and Justine grabbed her mom\u0027s hand and started dragging her toward the relative safety of Lake Street.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll-\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Mommy!\"\\n\\n \"-get help!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare,\" I snapped. \"If you mess up my murder, I\u0027ll be furious.\" One of the men had grabbed my arm, was dragging me back toward Justine and her mom. \"Just a minute, pal, I\u0027ve got to-\" He poked me, hard, and without thought I shoved.\\n\\n The rest of it happened awfully fast. Jerkoff #1 hadn\u0027t poked me, he\u0027d stabbed me-for all the good it did. And when I shoved, his feet left the ground and he sailed back as if hurricane-force winds had blown him. When he finally touched ground he rolled for a good ten feet before he regained his feet and ran like he\u0027d had one too many chimichangas and needed a bathroom.\\n\\n While I was staring and making my usual vocalization when I didn\u0027t understand (\"Wha...?\"), the other two moved in. I reached up and grabbed them by the backs of their necks, then banged their heads together. There was a sickening crunch, and I heard-yech!-their skulls cave in. It was the sound I\u0027d heard at my cousin\u0027s wedding when her groom stomped on the glass. The bad guys dropped to the ground, deader than disco. Their faces were frozen in eternal expressions of pissed-off.\\n\\n I nearly threw up into their staring faces. \"Oh, shit!\"\\n\\n \"Thank you thank you thank you!\" Justine\u0027s mom was in my arms, reeking of fear and Dune perfume. She was clutching me with not-inconsiderable strength and babbling into my hair. I wriggled, trying to extricate myself without hurting her. \"Ohmygod I thought they were going to rape me kill me hurt Justine kill Justine thank you thank you thank you!\"\\n\\n \"Err...that\u0027s fine, Miss-uh, miss. Leggo now, there\u0027s a nice hysteric.\"\\n\\n She let go of me, still babbling, staggered a few feet away, knelt, and started picking up the items that had fallen from her purse. I instantly wanted to grab her back. Something about her-the blood, the-she had scraped herself, or one of the men had cut her, and she was bleeding, the blood was flowing beneath her shirt, on the inside of her upper arm, and it trickled steadily and suddenly I was so thirsty I couldn\u0027t breathe.\\n\\n Justine was staring up at me. Her tears had dried, making her cheeks shine in the moonlight. She looked very, very thoughtful. And about five years older than she\u0027d looked five minutes ago. She pointed. \"Doesn\u0027t that hurt like crazy?\"\\n\\n I looked down, then jerked the knife out of my side. Very little blood. \"No. Thanks. Uh...don\u0027t be scared. Anymore, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027d you ask them to kill you?\"\\n\\n Normally I wouldn\u0027t share unpleasant confidences with a strange child, but what could I say? It had been one of those nights. Plus, she had pointed out the knife sticking out of my ribs; I felt obliged to give her an honest answer. \"I\u0027m a zombie,\" I explained, except I was having trouble talking, all of a sudden. \"I\u0027m trying to thtay dead.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a zombie.\" She pointed at my mouth. \"You\u0027re a vampire. A good one, so that\u0027s all right,\" she added.\\n\\n My hand came up so quickly I actually bit myself. I felt the sharp tips of new fangs, fangs that had come out when I\u0027d smelled her mother\u0027s blood, fangs that seemed to be taking up half my mouth.\\n\\n \"A vampire? How ith that pothible? I died in a car ackthident, for God\u0027th thake! Aw, thon of a bith!\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to suck our blood?\" Justine asked curiously.\\n\\n \"Blood maketh me throw up. Even the thight of it-ugh.\"\\n\\n \"Not anymore, I bet,\" she said. This was the most level-headed first-grader I\u0027d ever met. I was tempted to make her my evil sidekick. \"It\u0027s okay. You can if you want to. You saved us. My mom,\" she said, her tone dropping; it was low, confidential, \"was really scared.\"\\n\\n I clapped both hands over my mouth and started backing away. \"Run,\" I said, but I didn\u0027t have to bother; Justine\u0027s mama had finished gathering up her things, taken one look at my new dentition, picked up her daughter, and run in the opposite direction.\\n\\n \"There\u0027th a gath thtathion at the end of this block!\" I yelled after her. \"You can call triple A!\" I stuck my fingers in my mouth. My lisp was going away, and so were my fangs. \"And what were you thinking, having your daughter out at four o\u0027clock in the morning?\" I shouted after her, freshly annoyed. \"Dope!\"\\n\\n People think because Minneapolis was in the Midwest, rapes and murders and burglaries didn\u0027t happen there. They do, just not as often as, say, in Washington D.C. I\u0027d bet a thousand bucks the car that had broken down on them was a rental.\\n\\n Well, the mystery was solved. I was a vampire. How, I had no idea. Car accident victims did not rise from the dead. So I\u0027d always thought, anyway.\\n\\n Unless...could it have something to do with my attack a few months ago? The attackers had been savage, snarling, barely human. Until tonight, it had been the most surreal thing to happen to me, and that included the tax audit and my folks\u0027 divorce. Could the attackers have infected me?\\n\\n And why was I still me? Now that I was a ravenous member of the undead, I should be sucking little girls dry and then lunching on their mamas. The men in the alley had been asshole predators, but I was still horrified when I accidentally killed two of them. I\u0027d let Justine and her mom go-had ordered them to go. I was thirstier than I\u0027d ever been in my-uh-life, but it wasn\u0027t ruling me. I wasn\u0027t an animal. I was still me, Betsy, desperately in love with fine footwear and ready to give my eyeteeth (or my new fangs) for Russell Crowe\u0027s autograph.\\n\\n Russell Crowe...now there was someone who\u0027d make a delightful snack. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-3.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \\n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident. But what really bites (besides waking up in the morgue dressed in a pink suit and cheap shoes courtesy of her stepmother) is that she can\u0027t seem to stay dead. Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She\u0027s not taking too well to a liquid diet. \\n Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no? But a collection of Ferragamos isn\u0027t the only temptation for Betsy.
