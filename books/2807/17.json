{"id":90899,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I got home and saw my door had a giant crack running through the middle, like someone had been kicking it for an hour or more. I stopped dead on my front stoop. I\u0027ll admit it-I wasn\u0027t much interested in finding out who had broken in. Nope, forget it, I\u0027d had enough. Whoever it was, they were welcome to my cotton sheets, dirty dishes, and awful light orange living room rug.\\n\\n I was turning away, possibly to go find my mom and cry on her shoulder for three or four hours, when...\\n\\n \"Bets! Is that you?\" Jessica\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Get in here quick!\" Marc\u0027s.\\n\\n What fresh hell is this? I pushed the door open and walked inside. At least Jess was okay-sounded okay. Shanara couldn\u0027t have hurt her too badly. Jeez, had she bushwhacked us in that alley only three hours ago? It felt like three years.\\n\\n My friends were kneeling beside a big pile of rags in the middle of my bedroom floor. Marc had a neat white bandage on his neck and was still wearing the bracelet they\u0027d given him at the hospital. Jessica looked perfectly fine. \"Are you guys okay?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Are you, girlfriend? You look a little white around the gills. More so than usual,\" Jessica chortled. Then she sobered up and pointed to the rag pile. \"You got problems, Betsy. I mean, besides the ones we\u0027ve already been dealing with.\"\\n\\n Marc gently prodded the pile...and it was Nick! He looked unbelievably bad-like he hadn\u0027t eaten in three days, slept in five, bathed in ten. His hair was a mess of greasy tangles. His eyes rolled toward mine. They were so deeply bloodshot they were more red than white. \"More,\" he husked. \"Moremoremore.\"\\n\\n \"No, oh no!\" I rushed to him. \"Jesus, Nick, what did I do? What did I do?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly the opposite,\" Sinclair said thoughfully, \"of what I do.\"\\n\\n I whirled. Sinclair, Tina, and Donald were standing just inside my bedroom. I\u0027d never heard them come in. Never sensed their presence. Neither had Jessica and Marc, because they both let out little screams. Nick was oblivious. He\u0027d started rocking back and forth on the floor in an effort to soothe himself, and never looked away from my face.\\n\\n \"You gotta be Sink Lair,\" Jessica said.\\n\\n \"Hi, Mr. Sinclair!\" Marc trilled. He even waved. \"You guys drop by for a snack?\"\\n\\n \"You three get out of here!\" I hissed. \"I\u0027ve got enough problems right now, thanks.\"\\n\\n Sinclair pointed to Nick. \"That one is of your own making, I think...I can smell you on him. Under about six layers of dirt, that is.\" He said it so carelessly I wanted to kill him. My hand went to the cross Tina had given me. Would he sound so cool and unconnected if I jammed this little baby in his eye?\\n\\n But Sinclair was already striding toward us. \"Tina,\" he said quietly, kneeling beside Nick, \"help me.\" His actions were such a diametric opposite of his words that I was left confused (surprise!). The guy obviously hid a lot behind that smarmy cool fa\u0026ccedil;ade...trouble was, did I care?\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" I cried. \"Is he becoming a vampire?\"\\n\\n \"No. He craves you. He\u0027s an addict, now. You can\u0027t just have them and release them, Elizabeth. You fled my home after you saw a-certain aspect of the vampire lifestyle. But I would never do to mine what was done to yours.\"\\n\\n That stung. A lot. \"He\u0027s not mine. I barely even know him.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" Donald cleared his throat. He was crouching over us, resting his hands on his thighs. He looked like an undead umpire. \"That\u0027s worse, you know.\"\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t know!\"\\n\\n \"I warned you,\" Sinclair said. He was shrugging out of his topcoat and putting it over Nick\u0027s shivering form. \"You don\u0027t know the rules. Most vampires would learn or die. But you were born strong, and you have few of our weaknesses. So while you\u0027re learning, the innocent are being hurt. Is my offer of help still so completely unacceptable?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay...tell me what to do. How to help Nick. And I\u0027ll-I\u0027ll take your Vamp 101 class, Sinclair. But only after Nick is better.\"\\n\\n \"Your word on it, Elizabeth.\"\\n\\n \"She already told you she\u0027d let you help,\" Jessica said, and her voice was like ice. She might think Sinclair was yummier than a triple fudge sundae, but nobody was going to question her best friend in her own home. \"If that\u0027s not enough, Sink Lair, don\u0027t let the door hit you in your big white ass on the way out.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t pronounce my name like that,\" he sighed. He lifted Nick easily into his arms. Then, \"Big white ass?\"\\n\\n \"Just bring him to the bathroom,\" Tina said. \"Donald and I can take care of him.\"\\n\\n \"But-\" I closed my mouth with a snap. Nick was almost as tall as Sinclair, which made him two heads taller than Tina and Donald. Never mind. They could probably muscle a Volkswagen into my bathroom if they had to.\\n\\n Sinclair carried Nick to my bathroom and laid him on the floor. Donald stripped him while Tina started the shower. Meanwhile, Sinclair put a hand on each of my shoulders, turned me around, and marched me out. Of my own bathroom!\\n\\n \"Hands to yourself, buster,\" I warned.\\n\\n \"You-uh-want something to drink?\" Jessica was standing in the doorway. She blushed, which isn\u0027t easy to tell with her. \"I mean, like tea or something, Mr. Sinclair?\"\\n\\n \"Please call me Eric. Any friend of Elizabeth\u0027s, and all that.\"\\n\\n \"He likes plum wine, get him a glass of that,\" I said irritably.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get it!\" Marc said. He\u0027d gone to throw Nick\u0027s rags into my washing machine, but leapt for the doorway the instant Jessica did. They became jammed at the shoulder, Three Stooges style.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ll get it!\"\\n\\n They struggled and then both popped free of the doorframe. I heard pounding footsteps as they raced each other to the kitchen, and put a hand over my eyes. Friends...the ultimate mixed blessing.\\n\\n \"A pity you are not as fond of me as your companions are,\" Sinclair teased.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t know what a creep you are,\" I said sourly. I was annoyed to see Giselle purring in his arms as he absently tickled her under the chin. Fickle feline tramp! I snatched her away and tossed her in the direction of her cat door. With a snooty backward glance, she went. \"If they had the slightest clue how wretched and nasty and despicable you are...\"\\n\\n \"Now, Elizabeth, how can you say that? You know I tried to help you at the mausoleum, and I sent Tina to help you at Nostro\u0027s home tonight. If she hadn\u0027t given you my gift the Fiends would have torn you to pieces.\"\\n\\n \"Your gift?\"\\n\\n \"The cross belonged to my sister.\"\\n\\n My fingers went to the cross instantly, fumbling to take it off, but he stopped me with a shake of his head. \"Keep it. I can\u0027t wear it, and it might help you again.\"\\n\\n Shocked, I said, \"It was your sister\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"And now it\u0027s yours.\"\\n\\n \"Well...thank you. But-and it\u0027s not that I\u0027m not grateful-\"\\n\\n \"Not that, never that,\" he said mockingly.\\n\\n \"-but if you\u0027re so concerned, why didn\u0027t you come yourself tonight?\"\\n\\n \"I did come,\" he said innocently. \"More than once, in fact. I thought you were watching.\"\\n\\n I felt my face get red-a good trick, since I was dead. \"Very funny! You know what I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Alas, too well. Unfortunately, one of the conditions of Tina\u0027s release from Nostro was that I never set foot in his territory. I can send envoys, but I myself must stay clear. The mausoleum where you first met Nostro is neutral.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" Dammit! Hearing more details about how he got Tina away from Noseo made me start to hate him not so much. Which was not a good way to feel about a character as slippery as this guy. My hand went instinctively to the cross again. \"Well, I\u0027d thank you-\"\\n\\n \"My heart! Can it stand the strain?\"\\n\\n \"--except I know you\u0027ve got some sneaky motive for helping me out.\"\\n\\n \"My anti-Nostro, pro-Elizabeth stance has been clear for a few days, there\u0027s nothing sneaky about it. I was sorry to hear I\u0027d missed you earlier this evening.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s not talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"An American prude born in the late twentieth century? I hadn\u0027t thought such creatures existed.\"\\n\\n \"Just because I don\u0027t think you should be gaily boinking with multiple partners-at the same time!-doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m a prude.\"\\n\\n He gestured toward the bathroom, where poor Nick was being ministered to by Tina and Donald. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re in any position to question my judgment. My ladyfriends know what they\u0027re getting into.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re still a pig,\" I said bitterly. \"I saw you. It didn\u0027t matter what three women were there-you didn\u0027t care. They were for you to use. That\u0027s not how you treat a friend.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" His brows arched in though. \"Perhaps I simply haven\u0027t met the right woman.\"\\n\\n \"Or perhaps you\u0027re a pig!\" I threw my hands in the air. \"Did you really need three of them? I mean, come on. Realistically. Three?\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" He smiled slowly, and I felt my stomach tighten. \"Does anyone ever really need a banana split, when a single scoop sundae would do?\"\\n\\n \"These. Are. Human. Beings.\" I was pushing the words out past gritted teeth; I was so pissed my eyes were crossed. \"Not. Ice cream. Sundaes. Pig.\"\\n\\n \"Then I have the bargain of the century for you, Elizabeth. I will give up their friendship at once, and all others. Tonight. If you take their place in my bed.\"\\n\\n My mouth fell open and I gaped at him like a landed trout. A zillion emotions-outrage, curiosity, fear, lust, shock-screamed through my head in half a second, and before I knew I was going to do it, my hand leaped to his face and slapped him hard enough to drive him a step back.\\n\\n He felt his jaw and looked at me. His black eyes glittered and I swallowed the phrase...\\n\\n I take it back!\\n\\n ...that wanted to come out.\\n\\n \"Nice,\" was all he said. \"I didn\u0027t see that one coming. Although I should have.\"\\n\\n I tried to say something appropriate haughty and scathing, but couldn\u0027t think of a thing.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" he said, soooooo polite, and took the glass Jessica was offering him. Marc was right behind her with a tray of cocktail accessories: marachino cherries, lemon slices, olives. They hadn\u0027t seen the slap. Heck, I had barely seen it-it was like my hand had moved quicker than thought.\\n\\n \"All that stuff for wine?\" I sighed, rolling my eyes and rubbing my palm-smacking Sinclair had been like smacking a chunk of granite. \"Get real, you guys.\"\\n\\n For spite (must have been!) Sinclair carefully selected a lemon slice and dropped it into his wine.\\n\\n Jessica peeked into the bathroom, then hurried back to report. \"They got that boy stripped mother naked and they\u0027re scrubbing him with your brand-new loofah.\"\\n\\n I winced. Thirty-seven ninety-nine at The Body Shop, kaput. \"Fair enough. It\u0027s my fault he\u0027s in this mess. What happens after he\u0027s clean, Sinclair?\"\\n\\n \"Eric.\"\\n\\n \"Errrrrrric...\" Jessica and Marc repeated in dreamy chorus.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you two have anything else to do?\" I practically screamed.\\n\\n \"This is the most interesting week of my entire life,\" Marc pointed out. \"Vampires! Queenmaking! Alliances! Gorgeous good guys. Sneaky bad guys. Fighting the good fight! Why in the world would we go find something else to do? What am I going to do? Fight red tape at the hospital, beg HMOs to do the right thing while a kid dies? What\u0027s Jess going to do-count her money?\"\\n\\n \"Besides, we\u0027re your sidekicks. Part of the team. Anything that involves Liz here involves all of us,\" Jessica added.\\n\\n \"I shall endeavor to keep that in mind. To answer your question, Liz-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare.\"\\n\\n \"Then no more Sink Lair, yes?\"\\n\\n Dammit! \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Very good. As I was saying, once Detective Berry has been purified, Tina or Donald will relieve his immediate need by feeding on him. Then we will make him forget he ever knew you as a vampire. He\u0027ll wake up in his own bed, with a week\u0027s worth of stubble, feeling like he\u0027s been quite ill. So he would have been-only he\u0027ll think it was the flu.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t want this to happen to anyone again,\" I said. \"I mean, your plan sounds like a good one, and God knows you\u0027ve had a lot of years to perfect it, but I\u0027m looking to treat the disease, not the symptoms.\"\\n\\n Sinclair had winced at \u0027God\u0027, but answered smoothly enough. \"Then pick one-or two-or three lovers who don\u0027t mind sharing blood along with their bodies, and use them as often as you must. Or they wish.\"\\n\\n \"Do not even think of glancing in my direction,\" Jessica ordered.\\n\\n \"Seriously,\" Marc added. \"Unless you\u0027ve managed to grow a penis in the last couple days.\"\\n\\n Sinclair ignored them. \"You will find it\u0027s quite a satisfactory arrangement.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s one of the big differences between thee and me, Sinclair, because I disagree!\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a poet,\" Marc informed us, \"and she didn\u0027t know it.\"\\n\\n I glared at them, but they smiled back and didn\u0027t budge. I turned back to Sinclair. \"It\u0027s like-it\u0027s like making a human being your-your pet or something.\" I\u0027d never forget the coolly amused look on his face while he took one of his ladyfriends, then the other, then the other. They could have been anyone-he absolutely didn\u0027t care who was in his bed. I\u0027d never do that to a person, make them feel like they\u0027re interchangeable parts of someone\u0027s machine. Never.\\n\\n \"Did you not eat meat before your accident?\" he asked. \"You were strong and to keep yourself strong, you used the weak. That\u0027s what predators do. That\u0027s what vampires do. Otherwise you\u0027re like those fools in P.E.T.A. who think we should all nibble grass and drink nectar.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Lord, here we go,\" Jessica muttered. \"Save yourself, Eric.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a member of P.E.T.A.,\" I said. \"I ate meat, sure, but I don\u0027t think we should pour shaving cream down a rabbit\u0027s throat, or rub eye makeup onto a dog\u0027s eyeball so American women can have lush lush lashes. It\u0027s one thing if you need the protein, but it\u0027s another if you want to hang a big dead stuffed head on your wall, or design a deodorant that makes your armpit smell like a flower patch.\"\\n\\n \"A vampiric P.E.T.A. member.\" Sinclair couldn\u0027t quite keep the smile off his face. \"That\u0027s something new.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re one of them?\" Marc said, horrified. \"Oh, cripes! I had no idea. Jesus, I feel dirty! Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\\n\\n I blinked. \"My being a vampire doesn\u0027t bother you, but giving money to P.E.T.A. does?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, it was one thing when you were a soulless underling of Satan, I could work with that, but belonging to P.E.T.A...ugh! I\u0027ve got my pride, dude.\"\\n\\n Jessica got the giggles, then started to laugh. Before long she was having one of her gut-busters and hanging onto the wall to keep from falling over.\\n\\n Sinclair grinned, watching me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better go check on the others,\" I said at last. I passed them on my way to the bathroom and ignored the evil eye sign Marc forked at me.\\n\\n Marc was still freaking out. \"P.E.T.A.! Man, I\u0027m gonna have to sit down and think this one over. Didn\u0027t mind being the sidekick of a bride of Satan, but a tree-hugger...\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you should sit down,\" Sinclair suggested solicitously.\\n\\n I passed Donald on my way in. \"We\u0027ll need some clothes for your Nick,\" he said over his shoulder. \"Something he can wear home, that he can\u0027t trace back to you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got some old sweatsuits I never wear anymore-bottom drawer on the left. They don\u0027t have my name on them or anything. They\u0027ll be a little small, but they\u0027ll get the job done.\" Then I was stepping into the bathroom. Nick was looking a little livelier, and well he should, since his head was pillowed on Tina\u0027s breasts and she was slowly, luxuriously working soapy lather over the muscles in his back. He was, as a matter of fact, extremely happy to see her. This was a great relief to me. When I saw the wreck that was the former Detective Nick Berry on my bedroom floor, I was afraid he\u0027d never be happy to see anyone again.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s it going in here?\" I asked. Squeaked, actually-I was a little nervous to be talking to Tina. I could still feel that kiss.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be all right. Do you think you could assist me? I would ask Sinclair or Donald, but-\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my mess. Yeah, I\u0027ll help.\" I slipped out of my clothes, then slid the shower door aside and stepped in. \"What-uh-what do we do now?\"\\n\\n \"Now I fall upon you with ravenous hunger and hump your brains out.\"\\n\\n I burst out laughing. I was scooched as far away from her as I could get, and that was a fact. I also felt a little weird about being naked in front of a lesbian. I probably had been before, at one time or another-public showers, that sort of thing-but you don\u0027t know for sure, right? You just assume everyone else is straight, and if someone\u0027s staring at your tits you figure she\u0027s working up the nerve to ask who did your boob job. \"Very funny. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the one who\u0027s sorry. I abused your trust and put everything in jeopardy.\" Her voice was so bitter it shocked me. \"All because I couldn\u0027t keep myself to myself.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, whoa, calm down, sunshine. It was just a kiss, it\u0027s not like you knifed my puppy. Besides, I owed you a favor, right? From the pit?\"\\n\\n She shifted Nick as easily as a grown man shifted a kitten. \"So,\" she said, straight-faced, \"I risked my life and faced the prospect of a horrible death to save you, and in return you allowed me to kiss you, and now we\u0027re even.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" I smirked.\\n\\n She rolled her eyes. \"The devil helps us if you really are the queen.\" But she said it with a smile, and I knew she was teasing to make me feel better. She\u0027d probably prefer to kiss my feet some more, but was well aware of my anti-tootsie smacking policy. \"Very well, then. To business. If you\u0027ll drink from his throat, I\u0027ll take him inside me. He\u0027ll have relief and then we\u0027ll be able to plant the suggestions we need to.\"\\n\\n \"Take him-oh. Oh! But you don\u0027t-you don\u0027t like-I mean-oh, fuck.\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"All those things are true, but exceptions must be made.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but...like I said, it\u0027s my mess.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but you don\u0027t want to do it. You never meant to in the first place, and don\u0027t want to now, particularly with several people waiting right outside the door, and that\u0027s fine.\" Seeing the look on my face, she softened her tone. \"It\u0027s all right, Betsy. I truly don\u0027t mind. It\u0027s nothing to me, and everything to him. Besides...aren\u0027t you thirsty?\"\\n\\n I was. I hadn\u0027t fed yet tonight. Or last night, for that matter. But... \"Why does it have to be both? Why do we have to drink and fuck?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t,\" she said, \"but they do. If we take from them, they need us in the way that they\u0027ve never needed anyone before. I guess it\u0027s like-like masturbating but not letting yourself reach orgasm. What\u0027s the point? It\u0027s frustrating and leaves everyone unhappy. We could take and not give ourselves to them in return, but it\u0027s a rotten thing to do.\"\\n\\n \"This is very weird and disturbing, and time\u0027s a\u0027wasting and my water heater is only so big, so we\u0027d better get cracking, and I am thirsty, but if you do this for me I owe you another favor. All right?\"\\n\\n She looked at me, and her little pink tongue came out and tapped one of her canines thoughtfully. \"A kissing favor,\" she said finally.\\n\\n \"Awww, Tina, I told you,\" I whined, \"I don\u0027t play that way.\" So why does the idea thrill you right down to your undead toes, you liar?\\n\\n \"Not in life, certainly. But vampires have to adjust to many things...and quite a few of us find that after death we are-ah-flexible.\"\\n\\n It was all very strange.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said with a convincing display of reluctance. \"A kissing favor. But later.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t want to do it today,\" she assured me. \"I\u0027d want to wait until we had...leisure.\"\\n\\n \"You know, those pauses you and Sinclair do before you finish a sentence are really terrifying.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you think we do it? And who do you think taught him?\" she asked merrily. She rinsed the last of the soap from Nick\u0027s body, then beckoned me closer. I came out of my corner, ran my hands up his back, then put my hands on his shoulders, leaned in, and bit him. Hot salty life trickled into my mouth and Nick straightened up in a hurry, completely losing the apathy that had cloaked him all night. He tried to turn to face me, but I wouldn\u0027t let him.\\n\\n \"Here, to me,\" Tina said in her sweet, almost musical voice. Nick lunged forward, picked her up, and drove into her. Her back slammed against the tile and her legs were forced up and around his waist. Tina let out a squeak of pain, and Nick started thrusting against her so hard I lost my grip.\\n\\n \"Oh my God, is he hurting you?\" I was horrified. I was ready to pull him off her and put him through the shower door, and never mind that he was the victim.\\n\\n \"...nothing. It\u0027s nothing.\"\\n\\n It occurred to me that a woman who didn\u0027t choose to couple with men was taking a pounding on my behalf, and didn\u0027t even have the pleasure of the drink to ease things. Because she wanted me to drink. Which I had, like the selfish cow I was.\\n\\n It\u0027s just...I hadn\u0027t thought he\u0027d be so rough! So-so brutal and mindless. Of course, he\u0027d been like that with me, but I\u0027d given it right back to him and besides, I liked men. But Tina-\\n\\n Nick seized her by the thighs and wrenched her further apart; she cried out before she could lock it back.\\n\\n \"Screw this,\" I said.\\n\\n I started to pull him off her, but stopped at her sharp, \"Do not! Else it\u0027s for nothing!\"\\n\\n So I held her hand instead. She squeezed back, tightening painfully as Nick speeded up toward his climax. Then he was done and collapsing to his knees, already half unconscious, and I caught Tina as she fell forward. \"That\u0027s it, sweetheart,\" I told her, brushing damp tendrils of hair out of her eyes. \"That\u0027s the last bang you take on my behalf.\"\\n\\n \"Done, and done,\" she said, and we staggered out of the shower together. I remembered to turn off the water before Nick drowned. But I still felt like putting him through the wall-how\u0027s that for irrational? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-17.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) \\n It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor.
