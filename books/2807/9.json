{"id":90891,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"Die, bloodsucking hellspawn!\" My eyes flashed open and I saw the stake descending. Whoever was holding it was probably moving pretty fast, but to me it seemed like slow motion. I grabbed the wrist holding the stake and tugged. The woman flew over my head and sailed across the room. She could have been hurt, but she landed on the futon mattress which she must have dragged in while I was sleeping the sleep of the sated animal. \"Dammit, Jessica!\" I cried when I saw her. She crouched on the mattress, almost giggling. \"And now,\" she boomed, her voice artificially deep, \"the bloodsucking fiend rises from her grave to mete out harsh punishment to the mere mortal who dared try to end her unnatural life!\" \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" Jessica bounced up from the mattress, grinning. \"That\u0027s the only thing you\u0027ve got to worry about now, kiddo. Where there be vampires, there be vampire hunters. They don\u0027t know you\u0027re one of the good guys. I figured we could do some drills.\" For the first time, I noticed she was wearing jeans, a heavy sweatshirt, kneepads, elbow pads, and a biker\u0027s helmet. She looked like a black armadillo. \"You know, get your anti-stake reflexes really humming.\" \"Coffee,\" I groaned, staggering toward the bathroom. I was perfectly awake-and I certainly didn\u0027t need to pee-but I was determined to maintain some sort of routine. \"And get lost!\" \"No way. Now that you\u0027re back from the dead, I\u0027m doing everything I can to keep you from biting the big one again. For example, Liz, are you prepared to deal with THIS?\" She yowled that last as she leaped toward my back, swinging that damned stake. I had plenty of time to sidestep her, and she hit the wall like a bug and bounced off, landing on her padded knees in front of my dresser. \"Ooooh, nice!\" she said approvingly. \"You didn\u0027t even turn around. We\u0027ll add super hearing to the list.\" \"Please go away,\" I begged. \"I plan to stay inside and wallow in guilt all day. Night, I mean.\" \"Why?\" \"Why?\" I couldn\u0027t tell her about Nick. I was too embarrassed. Plus, she\u0027d whip out the Sex Calendar and update it on the spot. As a goad to improving the frequency of my naked indoor games, she had started to keep track. The pitiful number I racked up in 2001 was especially humiliating. \"Because I\u0027m now an unnatural creature, that\u0027s why. Buzz off.\" \"No way! We\u0027re going to fight crime tonight.\" \"We are, huh?\" Actually, that was not such a bad idea. I could do with a little atonement after last night. \"Yup. Also, you\u0027re kind of clammy. I tried to take your pulse when I got here, and your wrist is chilly. I know! Let\u0027s take your temperature.\" I shuddered at the thought. Was I room temperature? Cold-blooded like a snake? Ugh. \"Let\u0027s not.\" I found out Miss Stabs-A-Lot had been busy while I was resting (it was too deep, dreamless and, let\u0027s face it, deathlike, to call it sleeping). She\u0027d set up my computer to download all the pertinent news stories of the day, so when I ... ...got up I\u0027d see what had been happening in the world during the day. She\u0027d also bought my house. \"My house,\" I said slowly. \"Hey, it was going on the market at the end of the month. You\u0027re dead, remember? You don\u0027t live here anymore, and since you still had eleven years to go on your mortgage, the bank was kind of interested in getting it back.\" She handed me a thick sheaf of papers. \"It\u0027s all taken care of.\" I stared blankly at the paperwork. \"Jess...I don\u0027t know what to say. This was so thoughtful...and smart. I hadn\u0027t even started thinking about stuff like my house and car-\" \"Which I also bought,\" she added helpfully. \"So quickly? I haven\u0027t even been dead a week. How could you do all this stuff in a day?\" \"It helps to be ridiculously wealthy,\" she said modestly. \"Also, I started the stuff the day you died. It-it gave me something to do. Besides, I didn\u0027t want Mrs. Taylor doing something rotten with your things. Figured I\u0027d legally own it all, have plenty of time to sort through everything, then put it back on the market once everything was-you know-settled.\" I shook my head. \"No wonder you kicked my ass on the SATs. Okay, well, I suppose I can make my house and car payments to you instead of the bank-\" \"Uh-oh, no way.\" \"Jessica-\" \"Forget it.\" \"-you can\u0027t just spend all that money-\" \"You\u0027re dead, I can\u0027t heeeeeeeeear youuuuuuu...\" \"-and not get anything ba-\" \"La la la la la la la la la!\" Her hands were clapped over her ears and her eyes were squeezed shut. I kicked her ankle, very very gently. \"Fine, fine, fine!\" She opened her eyes and smiled at me, then bent and rubbed her ankle. \"Good. And ouch! Besides, it\u0027s not a gift. You\u0027re not going to have much income coming in for a while, but you\u0027ll be ambushing bad guys at night-\" \"I haven\u0027t decided what I\u0027m going to be doing at night.\" \"--so it evens out,\" she finished with trademark stubbornness. \"You shouldn\u0027t have to worry about house payments on top of everything else.\" \"Well...thanks. I really don\u0027t know what to say. You\u0027re too good.\" I knew I should have fought her more for form\u0027s sake, but the fact was, Jessica could have paid off the homes of everyone we went to high school with, and still have about a billion dollars left over. It was stupid to protest when she had the bucks and the inclination. But I\u0027d find a non-monetary way to make it up to her. I shoved the thought away, horrified, and told myself it wouldn\u0027t work: Jessica was a woman, and had no interest in seeing what color underpants I had on. \"No!\" \"What? Cracking up already? Heck, it\u0027s only 7:30. Way too early for hysterics.\" My phone started ringing. \"I\u0027ll get it, dead girl...we better figure out the phones, too.\" A minute later, I was dressed and Jessica trotted back into my bedroom. \"Your mom says howdy and to be careful fighting crime. Man, she\u0027s cool! If I came back from the dead, my mom\u0027d still be in a rubber room. How\u0027d it go last night?\" \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\" \"Huh? To your mom? I should hope not.\" \"Oh. Right. Uh-she was incredibly cool about it. Very \u0027oh, you\u0027re a vampire, that\u0027s nice, dear, watch out for holy water\u0027...like that. She was really really happy to see me, and beyond that, didn\u0027t give a fig for the details.\" \"That\u0027s how I feel, too. Plus, I can\u0027t help it, I think it\u0027s so neat.\" \"Please. You sound like a cheerleader.\" \"Well, I was one. Also, breakfast is served.\" She held out a glass. One whiff and I knew it wasn\u0027t brimming with V-8. There was a green leaf stuck artfully to the side of the glass, which had been chilled, and its rim had been dipped in coarse salt. \"It\u0027s O negative...the universal drink.\" \"You have garnished my glass of blood,\" I observed, \"with basil and margarita salt.\" \"Sure. This is no drive-thru McDonald\u0027s blood. This is Aquavit blood. Manny\u0027s Steak House blood!\" \"Seriously. Where\u0027d you get it?\" \"I\u0027ll never tell. But we should set up a mini-bank or something for you here, so you don\u0027t have to prowl alleys looking for a fix. I\u0027ve got a guy working on that right now. He thinks I\u0027m an eccentric heiress who\u0027s setting up her own blood storage in case of a national shortage.\" She tittered. \"He\u0027s right, of course. Cheers!\" I took the glass with all the enthusiasm I\u0027d have shown if she was offering me a glass of pureed rattlesnake. The smell was making my head swim, and not in a good way. While Jess looked on, big-eyed, I took a tentative sip. It was like drinking a dead battery, fallen leaves, a candle that had burned down to nothing. That\u0027s what it tasted like: nothing. And that\u0027s what it was doing for me, too. I was just as thirsty as I was when I woke up ten minutes ago. I handed the glass back, shaking my head. \"Nope. It\u0027s got to be live.\" Her face fell. \"Nuts. So much for that plan. You really can\u0027t-uh-get nutrients out of it, or whatever? Metabolize it?\" \"It\u0027s like gulping down a vitamin and saying that\u0027s supper. You\u0027d starve to death pretty quick. But thanks for going to all the trouble,\" I added, because she looked so crestfallen. I had to admit I was pretty disappointed myself. Now I\u0027d have to hunt. I thought of Nick. Give him a call, why don\u0027t you? He\u0027ll be here in a heartbeat. Then I made the thought go away, fast. The phone rang again, but I put up a hand to stop Jess from bounding back into the other room. \"I\u0027ll get it. It\u0027s probably my dad, anyway. He\u0027s had a day to get over the shock.\" I walked into my living room, and saw that Jessica had thoughtfully unpacked the boxes and put my things back. She was an exhausting pal, and I was damned lucky to have her on my side. I would do well to keep that in mind. \"Hello?\" \"Is this Elizabeth Taylor?\" \"Yes. And don\u0027t joke about my name; I\u0027ve heard them all.\" \"Elizabeth Taylor of one-two-one-five Ramsey Street?\" I yawned, and covertly felt my teeth. Nope; fangless. \"Yes, and I\u0027m perfectly satisfied with my long distance service. Thanks anyway.\" \"Why,\" the voice-male, sounded like he was in his early 20\u0027s-demanded, \"are you answering the phone?\" \"Because it rang, dope. Now, I\u0027m really very busy, so if-\" \"But you\u0027re dead!\" I paused. How best to handle this? Who was this guy? Visa? The utilities company? \"Don\u0027t believe everything you read,\" I said finally. \"Also, the checks are in the mail, but since I just got laid off I\u0027d like to make payment arrangements-\" \"You\u0027re a vampire and you\u0027re in your own house answering your phone?!? Get out of there!\" I nearly dropped the phone. \"A) How did you know that, and b) fat chance! Plus, the mortgage is paid off. I\u0027m not going anywhere. Nighty-night.\" I hung up, but almost immediately the phone rang again. If a phone could ring angrily, mine was. Or maybe I was just picking up the emotions of the person on the other end. Either way, the phone practically jumped into my hand. \"Hello?\" \"Why are you answering your phone?\" \"Because it keeps ringing!\" Why why why didn\u0027t I get caller I.D. when I had the chance? \"Now stop bugging me.\" \"Wait! Don\u0027t hang up!\" Like I would. Could this be another vampire? Even if he wasn\u0027t, he knew I was. Maybe he could tell me what\u0027s been going on, give me some pointers. Anything was better than spending the next ten years finding things out the hard way. \"Well,\" I said coyly, \"I\u0027m very busy.\" \"Look: come to the downtown Barnes and Noble...you know where that is?\" \"Sure.\" Hard not to; it took up an entire city block. \"After you feed, meet me in the cookbook section...\" \"That\u0027s mean!\" I protested. \"Okay, fine, the humor section.\" \"That\u0027s not much better,\" I grumbled. \"And I don\u0027t have to feed. I\u0027ll just go right now.\" A long pause, so long I thought he\u0027d hung up, when he practically whispered, \"You don\u0027t need to feed? Have you had time this evening?\" \"It\u0027s no big deal. I can go a few days. What do you look like? How about a codeword? Or a super duper secret undead handshake we can use?\" \"Don\u0027t bother,\" he said, and he sounded incredibly rattled. \"I know what you look like, Taylor. See you in an hour.\" Click. \"Ooooh, now that sounds ominous.\" I hung up. Convincing Jessica I needed to meet a mysterious someone who knew I was dead-alone-wasn\u0027t going to be easy. Best to get it over with.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-9.html","bookId":2807,"book":{"id":2807,"title":"Undead and Unwed (Undead #1)","description":"Storyline: Undead and Unwed (Undead #1) It\u0027a been a helluva week for Betsy Taylor. First, she loses her job. Then, to top things off, she\u0027s killed in a car accident.

Every night she rises with a horrible craving for blood. She\u0027s not taking too well to a liquid diet. Worst of all, her new friends have the ridiculous idea that Betsy is the prophesied vampire queen, and they want her help in overthrowing the most obnoxious, power-hungry vampire in five centuries - a badly dressed Bela Lugosi wannabe, natch. Frankly, Betsy couldn\u0027t care less about vamp politics, but they have a powerful weapon of persuasion: designer shoes. How can any self-respecting girl say no?
