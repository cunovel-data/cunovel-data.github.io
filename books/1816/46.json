A guy’s gotta hope.” He shrugged. “They’re probably going to lock you in solitary somewhere until the release just to keep a lid on it.”\n “Makes you wonder why LanCorp would take it to an outside agency, doesn’t it?”\n He frowned. “Yeah. I guess. Hadn’t thought about it.”\n Neither had I. But Gideon had.\n I looked back down at my mug, stirring absently. “There’s a new GenTen coming out soon.”\n “I heard. That’s a no-brainer, though. Everyone’s going to buy it.”\n Flexing my fingers, I studied my wedding ring and thought about the vows I’d made when I accepted it.\n “You got plans for lunch?” he asked.\n I picked up my mug and faced him. “Yes, I’m going out with Mark and his partner.”\n “Oh, right.” He moved toward the coffeemaker when I got out of the way. “Maybe we could grab drinks after work sometime this week. Drag our significant others with us. If Gideon’s up for it. I know he’s a busy guy.”\n I opened my mouth. Closed it again. Will had given me the perfect opening to excuse Gideon. I could take it, but I wanted to share the social parts of my life with my husband. I wanted him with me. If I started excluding him from my life, wasn’t that the beginning of the end?\n “Sounds like fun,” I lied, imagining a tension-fraught evening. “I’ll talk to him about it. See what we can work out.”\n Will nodded. “Cool. Lemme know.”\n —\n “I’VE got a problem.”\n “Oh?” I looked across the table at Mark. The Cuban restaurant Steven had chosen was both large and popular. Sunlight streamed in through a massive skylight, while colorful murals decorated the space with parrots and palm fronds. Festive music made me feel like I’d gone on vacation to somewhere exotic, while the rich smell of spices made my tummy perk up for the first time in days.\n I rubbed my hands together. “Let’s fix it.”\n Steven nodded. “Eva’s right. Lay it on us.”\n Mark pushed the menu aside and set his elbows on the table. “So Mr. Waters told me this morning to start working on the LanCorp brief.”\n “Yay!” I applauded.\n “Not so fast. In light of that, I had to give him my notice. I’d been hoping to wait until Friday, but they need someone who can stick with the client all the way through, not just the first month.”\n “You’ve got a point,” I conceded, my smile fading. “What a bummer, though.”\n “It sucked, but . . .” He shrugged. “It is what it is. Then he called in the other partners. They told me that the LanCorp brass was insistent that I head the campaign when they first approached the agency, enough so that the partners are worried they’ll lose the account if I’m not managing it.”\n Steven grinned and slapped him on the shoulder. “That’s what we like to hear!”\n Mark gave a sheepish smile. “Yeah, it was a boost, for sure. So anyway, they offered me a promotion and a raise if I’ll stay.”\n “Whoa.” I sat back. “That’s a serious boost.”\n “They can’t offer what Cross did. Not even half, but let’s be honest, he’s overpaying me.”\n “Says you,” Steven scoffed. “You’re worth every penny.”\n I nodded, even though I had only a vague idea of what Gideon had put on the table. “I agree with that.”\n “But I feel like I owe Waters Field and Leaman some loyalty.” Mark rubbed at his jaw. “They’ve been good to me and they want to keep me, even knowing I can be poached by someone else.”\n “You’ve given them good work for years,” Steven countered. “They got a lot out of you. You don’t owe them any favors.”\n “I know that. And I was fine with leaving an empty office behind, because they could fill that quick enough. But I’m having a hard time with possibly costing them the LanCorp campaign when I go.”\n “But that decision isn’t yours to make,” I pointed out. “If LanCorp doesn’t retain the agency, that’s up to them.”\n “I’ve tried spinning it that way, too. But it’s still not something I want to see happen.”\n The server came by to take our order. I looked at Steven. “Can you do the honors?”\n “Sure.” He looked at Mark, who gave a quick nod to signal the same request. Steven ordered for all of us.\n I waited until we were alone again to speak, unsure of how to say what needed to be said. In the end, I went with blunt. “I can’t work on the PhazeOne campaign.”\n Mark and Steven stared at me.\n “Look, the Landons and the Crosses go way back,” I explained, “and there’s bad blood between them. Gideon’s got some concerns, and I see his point. It’s strong enough for me to be cautious.”\n Mark frowned. “Landon knows who you are. He doesn’t have a problem with it.”\n “I know. But the PhazeOne system is a pretty big deal. There’s risk involved with having access to it, and I don’t need to contribute to that in any way.” It was hard admitting that Gideon was right, because I knew I was right, too. Which left us at an impasse I didn’t know how to get around.\n Steven leaned closer and studied me. “You’re serious.”\n “Afraid so. Not that your decision is in any way affected by me, Mark, but I thought I should put that out there.”\n “I’m not sure I understand,” Mark said.\n “She’s telling you that if you stay with your job, you’ll be losing both the money and your assistant,” Steven clarified. “Or you can move to Cross Industries as you’ve already agreed to do, get the money, and keep Eva.”\n “Well . . .” God. This was harder than I’d thought it would be. I had heard it but now I was living it: Any woman who loses or gives up a job she loves because of a man will resent it . . . What had ever made me think I would be somehow exempt? “I can’t say yet that I’ll be making the move with you.”\n Mark fell back against the burgundy vinyl booth. “This just keeps getting worse.”\n “I’m not saying definitively that I won’t.” I tried to shrug it off as no big deal. “I’m just not sure that Gideon and I should be working together. I mean I’m not sure he should be my boss . . . or whatever. You know what I mean.”\n “I hate to say it,” Steven said, “but she’s got a point.”\n “This is not helping my problem,” Mark muttered.\n “I’m sorry.” I couldn’t tell them how sorry I really was. I didn’t even feel like I could offer advice. How could I be nonbiased about Mark’s options?\n “On the bright side,” I offered instead, “you’re definitely a hot commodity.”\n Steven elbowed Mark with a grin. “I knew that already.”\n —\n “SO”—Cary slung his arm around me when I curled into his side—“here we are again.”\n Another night at my mom’s. She’d finally gotten suspicious, considering it was our fourth night in a row at her place. I confessed to arguing with Gideon, but not why. I didn’t think she would understand. I’m sure she would think it was perfectly normal for a man in Gideon’s position to handle all the pesky little details. And as for me possibly losing my job? Why would I want to work when I had no financial reason to?\n She didn’t understand. Some daughters wanted to grow up to be just like their mothers; I wanted the opposite. And my need to be the anti-Monica was the main reason I struggled so much with what Gideon had done. Any advice from her would only make things worse. I almost resented her as much as I did him.\n “We’ll go home tomorrow,” I said.\n After all, I’d be seeing Gideon at Dr. Petersen’s office at the very least. I was desperately curious about how that would go. I couldn’t help but hope that Gideon had turned a major corner with therapy. If so, maybe there were other corners we could turn. Together.\n I crossed my fingers.\n And really, I had to give Gideon credit for doing his best to give me the space I’d asked for. He could’ve caught me in an elevator or the lobby of the Crossfire. He could have told Raúl to drive me to him instead of wherever I directed. Gideon was trying.\n “Have you heard from Trey?” I asked.\n It was kind of miraculous how often Cary and I ended up in the same place at the same time. Or maybe it was a shared curse.\n “He sent me a text saying he was thinking about me but wasn’t ready to talk yet.”\n “Well, that’s something.”\n His hand ran up and down my back. “Is it?”\n “Yes,” I said. “I’m in the same place with Gideon. I think about him all the time, but I don’t have anything to say to him right now.”\n “So what’s next? Where do you go from here? When do you decide you’ve got something more to say?”\n I thought about that a minute, absently watching Harrison Ford hunt for answers in The Fugitive, which we had on mute. “When something changes, I guess.”\n “When he changes, you mean. What if he doesn’t?”\n I didn’t have that answer yet, and when I tried to think about it, I went a little crazy.\n So I asked Cary a question instead. “I know you want to put the baby first and that’s the right thing to do. But Tatiana’s not happy. And you’re not, either. Trey’s definitely not. This isn’t working out for any of you. Have you thought about being with Trey and the two of you helping Tatiana with the baby?”\n He snorted. “She’s not gonna go for that. If she’s miserable, everyone else has to be, too.”\n “I don’t think that should be her choice to make. She’s as responsible for getting pregnant as you are. You don’t have to do some sort of penance, Cary.” I put my hand over the arm he had lying in his lap, my thumb brushing carefully over the fresh scars on his inner forearm. “Be happy with Trey. Make him happy. And if Tatiana can’t be happy with having two hot guys looking after her, then she’s . . . not doing something right.”\n Cary laughed softly and pressed his lips to the crown of my head. “Solve your own problem that easily.”\n “I wish I could.” I wished for that more than anything. But I knew it wouldn’t be easy.\n And I feared it might be impossible.\n —\n THE vibration of my smartphone woke me.\n When I realized what the buzzing was, I began searching blindly for my phone, my hands sliding around the bed until I found it. By then, I’d missed the call.\n Squinting at the glaringly bright screen, I saw it was just past three A.M. and Gideon had called. My heart skipped as worry chased away sleep. Once again I’d gone to bed cradling my phone, unable to stop reading the many texts he had sent me.\n I called him back.\n “Angel,” he answered on the first ring, his voice hoarse.\n “Is everything okay?”\n “Yes. No.” He blew out his breath. “I had a nightmare.”\n “Oh.” I blinked up at the canopy that I couldn’t see in the dark. My mother was a fan of blackout drapes, saying they were necessary in a city that was never truly dark. “I’m sorry.”\n It was a lame reply, but what else could I say? It would be pointless to ask if he wanted to talk about it. He never did.\n “I’m having them a lot lately,” he said wearily. “Every time I fall asleep.”\n My heart hurt a little more. It seemed impossible that it could take so much pain, but there was always more. I’d learned that long ago.\n “You’re stressed, Gideon. I’m not sleeping well, either.” And then, because it had to be said, “I miss you.”\n “Eva . . .”\n “Sorry.” I scrubbed at my eyes. “Maybe I shouldn’t say that.”\n Maybe it was a mixed signal that would only make things worse for him. I felt guilty for staying away, even though I knew I had good reason to.\n “No, I need to hear it. I’m scared, Eva. I’ve never felt fear like this. I’m afraid you won’t come back . . . that you won’t give me another chance.”\n “Gideon—”\n “I dreamed about my father at first. We were walking on the beach and he was holding my hand. I’ve been dreaming about the beach a lot lately.”\n I swallowed hard, my chest aching. “Maybe that means something.”\n “Maybe. I was little in the dream. I had to look up a long way to see my dad’s face. He was smiling, but then I always remember him smiling. Even though I heard him fighting with my mom a lot toward the end, I can’t remember any other expression on his face but a smile.”\n “I’m sure you made him happy. And proud. He probably always smiled when he looked at you.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captivated-by-you-crossfire-4/page-46.html","bookId":1816,"book":{"id":1816,"title":"Captivated by You (Crossfire #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Captivated By You: by Sylvia Day (Book 4) | Summary \u0026 Analysis \n This is a Summary \u0026 Analysis.
