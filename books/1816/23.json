We settled onto the bench seat with a foot of distance between us, both of us looking anywhere but at each other as the privacy partition slowly rose and the limo began to move. The moment the divider locked into place, I fell back against the seat and yanked my skirt up, brazenly tearing off my own clothes in my eagerness to be fucked. As Gideon dropped to his knees on the floorboard, his hands went to his waistband, opening his slacks. I shimmied out of my underwear, kicking them off along with my sandals. “Angel.” His growl had me moaning with anticipation. “I’m wet. I’m wet,” I chanted, not wanting him to play with me or wait. Still, he tested me, cupping my sex in his hand. His fingers parted me, stroking over my clit, pushing inside me. “Jesus, Eva. You’re soaked.” “Let me ride you,” I begged, pushing away from the seat back. I wanted to set the pace, the depth, the rhythm . . . Gideon pushed his pants and boxer briefs down to his knees, then sat on the bench, yanking his shirttails out of the way. His cock rose up thick and long between his thighs, as savagely beautiful as the rest of him. I slid down to kneel between his legs, stroking his penis with my hands. He was hot and silky soft. My mouth was on him before I formulated the thought. His breath hissed out between his teeth, one hand grasping my ponytail as his head fell back. His eyes squeezed shut. “Yes.” I swirled my tongue around the broad head, tasting him, feeling the thick veins throbbing against my palms. Tightening my lips, I pulled off, then sucked him back in. He groaned and arched upward, pushing into my mouth. “Take it deep.” I squirmed as I obeyed him, ragingly turned on by his pleasure. Gideon’s eyes opened, his chin lowering so he could take in the sight of me. “Come here.” The low command sent a shiver of desire through me. I crawled up his magnificent body, straddling his hips and draping my arms over his shoulders. “You are so fucking hot.” “Me? You’re burning up, angel.” I moved my hips to position him. “Wait ’til you feel me from the inside.” He reached around me and gripped his cock, holding himself steady as I began to sink down. My legs shook as the thick crest of his penis pushed inside me, stretching me. “Gideon.” The feeling of being taken, possessed, was one I never got over. Gripping my hips, he supported me. I took him deeper, my eyes on his as they grew heavy. A rumbling sound filled the space between us and I grew slicker, hotter. It didn’t matter how many times I had him, I always wanted more. More of the way he responded to me, as if nothing had ever felt the same, as if I gave him something he could get nowhere else. I clung to the back of the seat and rolled my hips, taking a little more. I could feel him pressing against the deepest part of me, but I couldn’t fit all of him. I wanted to. I wanted everything he had. “Our first time,” he said hoarsely, watching me. “You rode me right here, drove me out of my mind. You blew the top of my fucking head off.” “It was so good,” I breathed, dangerously close to coming. He was so thick, so hard. “Ah, God. It’s better now.” His fingers dug into my hips. “I want you more now.” Gasping, I pressed my temple to his. “Help me.” “Hold on.” Yanking my hips down, he thrust upward, shoving into me. “Take it, Eva. Take it all.” I cried out and ground into him, moving on instinct, taking the last of him. “Yes . . . yes . . .” I gasped, slamming my hips into his, pumping my sex up and down the rigid length of his erection. Gideon’s face was harsh with lust, brutally etched with his need. “I’m going to come so hard for you,” he promised darkly. “You’ll feel me in you all night.” The sound of his voice . . . the way he’d looked onstage . . . I’d never been so excited. He wasn’t the only one who’d be coming hard. His head fell back against the seat, his chest heaving, harsh sounds of pleasure scraping from his throat. His hands released me, clenching into fists against the seat. He let me fuck him the way I needed to, let me use him. Arching back, I climaxed with a cry, my entire body shaking, my sex grasping, rippling along his cock. My rhythm faltered, my vision blackened. An endless moan poured out of me, the relief dizzying. The world shifted and I was on my back, Gideon rising over me, his arm hooking beneath my left leg to lift it to his shoulder. He dug his feet into the floorboard, thrusting again and again, sinking deep. So deep. I writhed, the feel of him so good it hurt. He kept me pinned, opened and defenseless, using me as I’d used him, his control shattered by the need to orgasm. The power of his body as he pounded into me, the force with which he drove his cock into my tender sex, had me quivering on the verge again. “I love you,” I moaned, my hands stroking down his flexing thighs. He growled my name and started coming, his teeth clenching, his hips pressed tight to my own, screwing deep. It set me off, the feel of him coming inside me. “So good,” he groaned, rocking into the spasms of my sex. We strained together, grasping at each other. He buried his face in my throat. “Love you.” Tears stung my eyes. He said the words so rarely. “Tell me again,” I begged, holding on to him. His mouth found mine. “I love you . . .” — “MORE,” I demanded, licking my lips. Gideon glanced over his shoulder at me. Bacon sizzled in the pan in front of him and my mouth watered for another slice. “And here I’d thought two packs of bacon would last us all weekend.” “Grease is a must after a night of drinking,” I told him, wiping some off my plate with my fingertip and lifting it to my mouth. “When you’re not hung over, that is.” “Which I am,” Cary muttered, walking into the kitchen in just his jeans, which he hadn’t bothered buttoning all the way. “Got any beer?” Gideon pointed at the fridge with his tongs. “Bottom drawer.” I shook my head at my best friend. “Hair of the dog this morning?” “Hell, yeah. My head feels like it’s splitting in two.” Cary pulled a beer out and joined me at the island. He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle back, gulping down half the contents at once. “How’d you sleep?” I asked, mentally crossing my fingers. He’d stayed the night in the attached single-bedroom apartment, and I hoped he loved it. It had all the beautiful prewar details of Gideon’s penthouse and was furnished similarly. I knew Cary’s style was more contemporary, but he couldn’t fault the view of Central Park. All the rest could be changed, if he just said the word. He lowered the bottle from his mouth. “Like the dead.” “Do you like the apartment?” “Of course. Who wouldn’t?” “Do you want to live there?” I persisted. Cary gave me a lopsided smile. “Yeah, baby girl. It’s a dream. Thank you for the pity fuck, Gideon.” My husband turned away from the stove with a plate of bacon in his hand. “There is neither pity nor fucking included in the offer,” he said dryly. “Otherwise, you’re welcome.” I clapped my hands. “Yay! I’m stoked.” Gideon snagged a piece of bacon and stuck it in his mouth. Leaning forward, I parted my lips. He bent toward me, letting me bite off the end. “Come on,” Cary groaned. “I’m fighting nausea as it is.” I shoved him gently. “Shut up.” He grinned and finished his beer. “Gotta give you guys a hard time. Who else is going to stop you two from singing ‘I Got You, Babe’ in a few years?” Thinking of Will and Natalie made me smile. I’d discovered even more to like about Will and found that I got along well with his girl, too. “Aren’t they adorable? They’ve been together since high school.” “Exactly my point,” he drawled. “Spend enough years with someone and either you start bickering or you fall down the lovey-dovey hole, never to be seen again.” “Mark and Steven have been together for years, too,” I argued. “They don’t fight or moon at each other.” He shot me a look. “They’re gay, Eva. No estrogen in the mix to cause drama.” “Oh my God. You sexist pig! You did not just say that.” Cary glanced at Gideon. “You know I’m right.” “And with that,” Gideon declared, grabbing three strips of bacon, “I’m out.” “Hey!” I complained after him, as he exited to the living room. My best friend laughed. “Don’t worry. He hitched himself to your brand of female.” I glared at him as I munched another piece of bacon. “I’m giving you a pass, because I owe you for last night.” “It was fun. Megumi’s good people.” His humor fled, his face darkening. “I’m sorry she’s going through what she is.” “Yeah, me, too.” “You make any decisions about how you’re going to help others like her?” I set my elbows on the island. “I’m going to talk to Gideon about working with his Crossroads Foundation.” “Hell. Why didn’t you think of that before?” “Because . . . I’m stubborn, I guess.” I glanced over my shoulder at the living room, then lowered my voice. “One of the things Gideon likes about me is that I don’t always do everything he wants just because he wants it. He’s not like Stanton.” “And you don’t want to be like your mom. Does this mean you’re keeping your maiden name?” “No way. It means a lot to Gideon for me to become Eva Cross. Besides, it sounds kick-ass.” “It does.” He tapped the end of my nose with his finger. “I’m here for you when you need me.” Sliding off the stool, I hugged him. “Same goes.” “I’m taking you up on that, obviously.” His chest heaved with a deep sigh. “Big changes happening, baby girl. You ever get scared?” I looked up at him, feeling the affinity that had gotten us both through some hard times. “More than I let myself think about.” “I have to run to the office,” Gideon interjected, stepping back into the kitchen wearing a Yankees ball cap. He’d kept the same gray T-shirt on but had swapped out his pajama bottoms for sweats. A ring of keys twirled around his finger. “I won’t be long.” “Is everything all right?” I asked, backing away from Cary. My husband was wearing his game face, the one that told me his mind was already on whatever he was going to deal with. “Everything’s fine.” He came to me and gave me a quick kiss. “I’ll be back in a couple of hours. Ireland won’t be here ’til six.” He left. I stared after him. What was important enough to drag him away from me on a weekend? Gideon was possessive about a lot of things when it came to me, but our time together topped the list. And the key-twirling thing was kind of weird. Gideon wasn’t a man given to wasted movement. The only times I’d seen him fidget were when he was completely relaxed or the opposite—ready to throw down. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something from me. As usual. “I’m gonna take a shower,” Cary said, grabbing a bottled water out of the fridge. “You want to watch a movie when I get out?” “Sure,” I said absently. “Sounds like a plan.” I waited until he’d gone back into the attached apartment, then went to find my phone. 11 “WHERE’S EVA?” I rounded the front of the Benz and stepped onto the curb in front of Brett Kline. My fingers twitched, the habit of extending my hand in greeting ruthlessly suppressed. The singer’s hands had touched my wife intimately in the past . . . and recently. I didn’t want to shake them. I wanted to break them. “At our home,” I answered, gesturing at the entrance to the Crossfire Building. “Let’s go up to my office.” Kline smiled coldly. “You can’t keep me from her.” “You did that all by yourself.” I noted the worn Pete’s T-shirt he was wearing with black jeans and leather boots. Without a doubt, his choice of attire wasn’t a coincidence. He wanted to remind Eva of their history together. Maybe even remind me, too. Had Yimara given him the idea? I wouldn’t be surprised. It was the wrong move for both men to have made. He walked through the revolving doors ahead of me. Security took his information and printed out a temporary ID, then we headed through the turnstiles to the elevators.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captivated-by-you-crossfire-4/page-23.html","bookId":1816,"book":{"id":1816,"title":"Captivated by You (Crossfire #4)","description":"Storyline: Captivated By You: by Sylvia Day (Book 4) | Summary \u0026 Analysis This is a Summary \u0026 Analysis.

However, because of his horrible nightmares and awful flashbacks to childhood abuse, it is hard for him to enjoy any of it.
