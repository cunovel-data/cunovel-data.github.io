{"id":85520,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"I switched tactics. “LanCorp asked for Mark directly, didn’t they?”\\n\\n She was silent a minute. “That’s what this is about? The PhazeOne system? Are you fucking serious?”\\n\\n I’d wondered what product Ryan Landon would use as an excuse to approach Eva. I was surprised he’d gone with a product so vital to his bottom line, then chastised myself for not expecting it. “You didn’t answer my question, Eva.”\\n\\n “What the hell does it matter?” she snapped. “Yeah, they asked for Mark. So what? You don’t want your competitors using him? Are you trying to say this was a business decision?”\\n\\n “No, this was personal.” I set my utensils down. “Eric Landon, Ryan Landon’s father, invested heavily with my dad and lost everything. Ryan Landon has been gunning for me ever since.”\\n\\n A frown marred the space between her brows. “So you didn’t want us working on any campaigns for him? Is that what you’re saying?”\\n\\n “I’m saying that Ryan Landon asked for Mark as a way to get to you.”\\n\\n “What? Why?” Irritation mixed with anger on her face. “He’s married, for chrissakes. He brought his wife to lunch with us the other day. You’ve got no reason to be jealous.”\\n\\n “He wouldn’t be interested in you that way,” I agreed. “It’s more of a triumph to have you working for him. He wants the satisfaction of knowing he can give an order and you’ll have to jump to get it done.”\\n\\n “That’s ridiculous.”\\n\\n “You don’t know the whole of it, Eva. How many years he’s spent trying to undercut me in every way possible. Every business decision he makes is driven by the need to rewrite the connection between the Landon and Cross names. Every success he’s had has been accompanied by a mention of his father’s failure to see my dad as a fraud and what that cost the Landons.”\\n\\n “Of course I don’t know,” she said coldly. “Because you didn’t see fit to tell me.”\\n\\n “I’m telling you now.”\\n\\n “When it doesn’t matter anymore!” She slid off the bar stool and stalked out of the kitchen.\\n\\n I went after her, as I always did. “Eva.”\\n\\n I caught her by the elbow, but she yanked free, spinning to face me.\\n\\n “Don’t touch me!”\\n\\n “Don’t walk away from me,” I growled. “If we’re going to fight, let’s get it over with.”\\n\\n “That’s what you were counting on, right? You figured you’d do whatever you wanted, then sweet-talk or fuck your way through it later. But you can’t fix this, Gideon. You can’t say a few words or screw me brainless and get away with it this time.”\\n\\n “Fix what? I saw someone maneuvering to take advantage of you and I took care of it.”\\n\\n “Is that how you see it?” Her hands went to her hips. “I don’t see it that way at all. Landon is taking the risk. What if Mark and I do a crappy job? He’s got a lot riding on PhazeOne.”\\n\\n “Exactly. He has in-house advertising, marketing, and promotion, just like I do. Why take something he’s sunk a fortune into—even by my standards—and set himself up for leaks or a massive fail?”\\n\\n She threw her hands up with a snort.\\n\\n “Right,” I bit out. “You can’t answer that because there is no good answer. It’s an unnecessary gamble. The only people handling the launch of the next-generation GenTen are people whose souls I own.”\\n\\n “What are you saying?”\\n\\n “That Landon’s waited a long time for his pound of Cross flesh. Maybe he doesn’t care that you married into the name. I don’t know what he has in mind. At the very least, he’s forcing us into a place where we’re unable to share information with each other.”\\n\\n Her brow arched. “How is that any different from how our relationship usually works?”\\n\\n “Don’t.” I clenched my hands at my sides, frustrated by her stubbornness. “Don’t make this about us when it’s about him. I’ll be damned if Landon drags you through hell because of me.”\\n\\n “I’m not saying you’re wrong! If you’d told me about this, I would’ve made the right decision on my own. Instead, you forced me out of a job I love!”\\n\\n “Back up. What decision would that have been?”\\n\\n “I don’t know.” She gave me a cold, hard smile that chilled my blood. “And now we’ll never find out.”\\n\\n She turned her back to me again.\\n\\n “Stop.”\\n\\n “No,” she tossed over her shoulder. “I’m getting dressed. Then I’m leaving.”\\n\\n “Like hell.” I followed her into the bedroom.\\n\\n “I can’t be around you right now, Gideon. I don’t even want to look at you.”\\n\\n My mind raced, searching for something to say that would calm her down. “Mark hasn’t taken the job.”\\n\\n She shook her head and yanked open a drawer to pull out a pair of shorts. “He will. I’m sure you made him an offer he can’t refuse.”\\n\\n “I’ll withdraw it.” God. I was backpedaling and it rankled, but she was so angry I couldn’t reach her. She was as distant as I’d ever seen her. Remote and untouchable. After the wildly erotic night we’d had, when we had been as close as ever, her attitude was unbearable.\\n\\n “Don’t bother, Gideon. The damage is done. But you’ll get a solid employee who’ll bring a lot to your team.” She tugged the shorts on and went into the closet.\\n\\n I was right behind her, blocking the doorway while she shoved her feet into flip-flops. “Listen to me, damn it. They’re coming after you. Everyone. They want to get at me through you. I’m doing the best I can, Eva. I’m trying to protect us the only way I know how.”\\n\\n She paused, facing me. “That’s a problem. Because this way doesn’t work for me. It will never work for me.”\\n\\n “Goddamn it, I’m trying! ”\\n\\n “All you had to do was talk to me, Gideon. I was halfway there on my own. Working with you on Crossroads was just the first step. I was going to make the decision to work with you, and you took that away from me. You took it away from both of us. And we’ll never get it back.”\\n\\n The icy finality in her tone made me crazed. I could deal when discussions went sideways. I could spin and switch strategy on the fly. What I couldn’t handle was when my grip on Eva slipped. When we’d said our vows, I had made the irrevocable decision to let everything go—my ambition, my pride, my heart—to hang on to her. If I couldn’t do that, I had nothing.\\n\\n “Don’t throw that at me now, angel,” I warned. “Every time I’ve brought up working together you shut me down.”\\n\\n “So you just bulldoze right through me?”\\n\\n “I was willing to give you time! I had a plan. I was going to seduce you with the possibilities, let you decide that the best way to develop your potential was alongside me.”\\n\\n “You should’ve stuck with the plan. Get out of my way.”\\n\\n I held my ground. “How could I stick with any plan the last few weeks? While you’re feeling righteous, think about what I’ve dealt with. Brett, the damned tape of you with him, Chris, my brother, therapy, Ireland, my mother, Anne, Corinne, fucking Landon—”\\n\\n Eva crossed her arms. “Gotta handle it all yourself, don’t you? Am I really your wife, Gideon? I’m not even your friend. I bet Angus and Raúl know more about your life than I do. Arash, too. I’m just the pretty cunt you fuck.”\\n\\n “Shut up.”\\n\\n “You need to get out of my way before this gets any uglier.”\\n\\n “I can’t let you leave. You know I can’t. Not like this.”\\n\\n Her jaw tightened. “You’re asking me to give you something I don’t have right now. I’m hollowed out, Gideon.”\\n\\n “Angel . . .” I reached for her, my chest so tight I found it hard to breathe. The devastation on her face was killing me. I’d destroy anyone who put that look on her face, but this time, I had done it. “What does it matter if you would’ve made the same decision anyway?”\\n\\n “You need to stop talking,” she said hoarsely. “Because every word coming out of your mouth makes me think we’re so far apart on this that we’ve got no business being married.”\\n\\n If she’d stabbed me in the chest, it couldn’t have hurt worse. The air in the closet became hot and stale, drying my throat and making my eyes burn. The floor seemed to tilt beneath my feet, the foundation of my life shifting as Eva slipped further and further away.\\n\\n “Tell me what to do,” I whispered.\\n\\n Her eyes glistened. “Let me go for now. Give me some space to think. A few days—”\\n\\n “No. No!” Panic swelled until I was forced to grip the door frame to stay upright.\\n\\n “Maybe a few weeks. I need to find a new job, after all.”\\n\\n “I can’t,” I gasped, panting for air. A black ring encroached on my vision, until Eva was the lone pinpoint of light. “For God’s sake, something else, Eva!”\\n\\n “I have to figure out what to do now.” She rubbed at her forehead with rough fingers. “And I can’t think when you’re looking at me like that. I can’t think . . .”\\n\\n She moved to pass me and I grabbed her by the arms, kissing her, groaning when I felt her soften for an instant. I tasted her, tasted her tears. Or maybe they were mine.\\n\\n Her hands went to my hair, fisting it, pulling it hard. She turned her head, breaking the seal of my mouth.\\n\\n “Crossfire,” she sobbed, the word cracking like a gunshot.\\n\\n I released her abruptly, stumbling back, even as my mind screamed at me to hang on.\\n\\n I let her go, and she left me.\\n\\n —\\n\\n THE sea breeze blows through my hair and I close my eyes, absorbing the feel as it buffets me. The rhythmic push and pull of the waves against the beach and the raucous cries of seagulls anchor me in the moment, in this place.\\n\\n It’s home in a way I haven’t known for a long time, although I’ve spent less than a handful of days here. It is a place I’ve shared only with Eva, so all of my memories of here are as drenched with her as the sand is with rays of the sun. Like the sand, I’ve been crushed down into fine, tiny bits by the forces around me. And like the sun, Eva has brought joy and warmth to my existence.\\n\\n She joins me on the deck, standing behind me at the railing. I feel her hand on my shoulder, then the press of her cheek against my bare back.\\n\\n “Angel,” I murmur, and place my hand over hers.\\n\\n This is what we needed, to come back to this place. It’s our retreat when the world closes in on us, trying to separate us. We heal each other here.\\n\\n Relief washes through me. She’s back. We’re together. She understands now why I did what I did. She was so angry, so hurt. For a moment, I had felt crippling fear that I’d destroyed the most precious part of my life.\\n\\n “Gideon,” she breathes, in that husky siren’s voice. One arm slides around my waist to hold me from behind.\\n\\n I tilt my head back and let the power of her love pour through me. Her fingers glide over my hip, and then she’s holding my cock in her hand. Stroking it from root to tip. I harden and thicken, ready for her. I live to serve her, to please her. How could she have doubted it?\\n\\n A moan rumbles up from the very depths of my soul, the desire I always feel for her climbing through me. Pre-cum leaks from the swollen head of my dick, my balls growing heavy and full.\\n\\n Her hand on my shoulder glides down my back, pressing lightly, urging me to bend forward.\\n\\n I obey because I want her to see how she owns me. I want her to understand that I would do anything, give anything, to make her safe and happy.\\n\\n Her hand traces my spine, kneading lightly. I grip the wooden handrail that circles the deck and spread my legs at her urging.\\n\\n Now, both of her hands are between my thighs, her breath hot and panting against my back. She’s pumping my cock with a firm, practiced grip. Harder than I’m used to from her. Demanding. Her other hand is massaging my sac, driving the urgency into me.\\n\\n Her grip slickens as the pre-cum streams steadily from the slit at the tip of my dick. The salty air washes over me, cooling the sweat misting my skin.\\n\\n “Eva . . .” I gasp her name, so hard for her, so desperately in love.\\n\\n Her fingers, now creamy and always cleverly agile, slide back and tease the dark rosette of my anus. It feels good, even though I don’t want it to. The stroking of my penis is making it hard to breathe, to think, to fight . . .\\n\\n “That’s it,” she coaxes.\\n\\n I try to arch away, but she’s got me trapped with my dick in her hand.\\n\\n “Don’t,” I tell her, squirming.\\n\\n “You like it,” she purrs, working my cock, her touch something I crave and can’t resist. “Show me how much you want me.”\\n\\n She pushes two slick fingers inside my ass. I cry out, writhing away, but she’s rubbing and thrusting into me, hitting the spot that makes me want to come more than anything. The pleasure grows despite the tears burning my eyes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captivated-by-you-crossfire-4/page-43.html","bookId":1816,"book":{"id":1816,"title":"Captivated by You (Crossfire #4)","description":"Storyline: Captivated By You: by Sylvia Day (Book 4) | Summary \u0026 Analysis \\n This is a Summary \u0026 Analysis.
