Or Jennifer Lopez?” I paused on the threshold of the living room, taking in the picture Ireland and Eva made over the rim of my glass. An ache bloomed in my chest. I wanted to freeze the moment, protect it, keep it safe forever. Ireland looked up and spotted me, then rolled her eyes. “What did I tell you?” she said. “Goofy.” — SITTING back in my chair, I sipped coffee and studied the spreadsheet on my monitor. I rolled my shoulders back, trying to loosen the kink in my neck. “Dude. What the hell? It’s three in the morning.” I looked up to find Ireland standing in the doorway to my home office. “Your point?” “Why are you working so late?” “Why are you Skyping so late?” I countered, having heard her laughter and occasionally raised voice over the last hour or so since I’d left Eva sleeping. “Whatev,” she muttered, coming in and dropping into one of the chairs in front of my desk. She slouched, her shoulders even with the chair back and her legs sprawled out in front of her. “Can’t sleep?” “No.” She didn’t know how literally true that was. With Ireland sleeping in Eva’s bed and Eva sleeping in mine, I couldn’t risk going to sleep myself. There was only so much I could expect Eva to take, only so many times I could frighten her before it destroyed the love she felt for me. “Christopher texted me a bit ago,” she said. “Guess Dad’s staying at a hotel.” My brows rose. She nodded, her face forlorn. “It’s bad, Gideon. They haven’t spent a night apart ever. At least that I can remember.” I didn’t know what to say. Our mother had been calling me all day, leaving messages on my voice mail and ringing the penthouse so often I’d been forced to disconnect the main receiver so that none of the phones would ring. I hated that my mother was struggling, but I had to protect my time with Ireland and Eva. It felt heartless to focus on myself, but I’d already lost my family twice before—once when my father died and again after Hugh. I couldn’t afford to lose any more. I didn’t think I could survive it a third time, not with Eva in my life. “I just wish I knew what caused the fight,” she said. “I mean as long as they didn’t cheat on each other, they should be able to get through it, right?” Exhaling roughly, I straightened. “I’m not the person to ask about relationships. I have no idea how they work. I’m just stumbling my way through, praying not to fuck things up, and grateful that Eva is so forgiving.” “You really love her.” I followed her gaze to the collage of photos on the wall. It hurt sometimes, looking at those pictures of my wife. I wanted to recapture and relive every moment. I wanted to hoard every second I’d ever had with her. I hated that time slipped away so quickly and I couldn’t bank it for the uncertain future. “Yes,” I murmured. I’d forgive Eva anything. There was nothing she could do or say that would break us apart, because I couldn’t live without her. “I’m happy for you, Gideon.” Ireland smiled when I looked at her. “Thank you.” The worry in her eyes lingered and sparked restlessness. I wanted to fix the problems troubling her, but I didn’t know how. “Could you talk to Mom?” she suggested. “Not now, of course. But tomorrow? Maybe you can find out what’s going on?” I hesitated a moment, knowing a conversation with our mother was certain to be unproductive. “I’ll try.” Ireland studied her nails. “You don’t like Mom very much, do you?” Weighing my answer carefully, I said, “We have a fundamental difference of opinion.” “Yeah. I get it. It’s like she’s got this weird form of OCD that applies to her family. Everyone has to be a particular way or at least pretend to be. She’s so worried about what people think. I saw an old movie the other day that reminded me of her. Ordinary People. Ever seen it?” “No, can’t say I have.” “You should watch it. It has Kiefer Sutherland’s dad in it and some other people. It’s sad, but it’s a good story.” “I’ll look it up.” Feeling the need to explain our mother, I tried my best. “What she dealt with after my father died . . . It was brutal. She’s insulated herself since then, I think.” “My friend’s mother says Mom used to be different before. You know, when she was married to your dad.” I set my cooled coffee aside. “I do remember her differently.” “Better?” “That’s subjective. She was more . . . spontaneous. Carefree.” Ireland rubbed at her mouth with her fingertips. “Do you think it broke her? Losing your dad?” My chest tightened. “It changed her,” I said quietly. “I’m not sure how much.” “Ugh.” She sat up, visibly shaking off her melancholy. “You going to be awake awhile?” “Probably all night.” “Wanna watch that movie with me?” The suggestion surprised me. And pleased me. “Depends. You can’t tell me what happens. No spoilers.” She shot me a look. “I already told you it’s sad. If you want happily ever after, she’s sleeping down the hall.” That made me smile. Standing, I rounded my desk. “You find the movie, I’ll grab the soda.” “A beer would be good.” “Not on my watch.” She pushed to her feet with a grin. “Okay, fine. Wine, then.” “Ask me again in a few years.” “You’ll have kids by then. It won’t be as fun.” I paused, hit by anxiety sharp enough to mist my skin with sweat. The thought of having a baby with Eva both thrilled and terrified me. It wasn’t safe for my wife to live with me. How could it ever be safe for a child? Ireland laughed. “Holy fuck, you should see your face! A classic case of playboy panic. Didn’t they tell you? First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage.” “If you don’t shut up, I’m sending you to bed.” She laughed harder and linked her arm with mine. “You’re a riot. Seriously. I’m just messing with you. Don’t flip out on me. I’ve got enough family members doing that.” I willed my heart to stop pounding so damn hard. “Maybe you should have a drink,” she suggested. “I think I will,” I muttered. “I’m going to give major props to Eva for getting a ring out of you. Did you have a panic attack when you proposed, too?” “Stop talking, Ireland.” Leaning her head against my shoulder, she giggled and led me out of my office. — THE sun had been up for over two hours by the time I returned to bed. I stripped silently, my gaze roaming over the delectable bump under the covers that was my wife. Eva was curled in a ball, mostly hidden except for the bright strands of hair splayed over the pillow. My mind filled in the blanks, knowing she was naked between the sheets. Mine. All mine. It killed me to sleep away from her. I knew it hurt her, too. Lifting the edge of the blankets, I slid in beside her. She gave a soft little moan and rolled toward me, her lush warm body wriggling into place against me. I was instantly hard. Desire simmered in my blood; awareness tingled along my skin. It was combustible sexual chemistry but also something more. Something deeper. A strange, wonderful, frightening recognition. She filled an emptiness in me I hadn’t known was there. Eva buried her face in my throat and hummed softly, her legs tangling with mine, her hands gliding over my back. “Hard and yummy all over,” she purred. “All over,” I agreed, cupping her ass and pulling her tighter against my hard-on. Her shoulders shook with a silent laugh. “We have to be quiet.” “I’ll cover your mouth.” “Me?” She nipped at my throat. “You’re the noisy one.” She wasn’t wrong. As rough and impatient as I could get when aroused, I’d never been loud . . . until her. It was a struggle to be discreet when situations called for it. She felt too good, made me feel too much. “So we’ll take it slow,” I murmured, my hands roaming greedily over her silky skin. “Ireland will be sleeping for hours; there’s no rush.” “Hours, huh?” Laughing, she pulled back and rolled away from me, reaching for the nightstand drawer. “Overachiever.” Tension stretched across my shoulders as she dug out the breath mints she kept handy. I was reminded of similar situations, when women had reached into the nightstand drawer for condoms. Eva and I had used condoms only twice. Before her, I’d never fucked a woman without one. Avoiding pregnancy was something I’d religiously adhered to. Yet since those first two times with Eva, we’d gone bare, relying on her birth control to prevent conception. It was a risk. I knew that. And considering how often I had her—at least two, sometimes three or four times a day—the risk was not inconsiderable. I thought of it sometimes. I questioned my control, my selfishness in putting my own pleasure above the consequences. But the reason for my recklessness wasn’t as simple as pleasure. If it were, I could deal. Be responsible. No, it was much more complicated. The need to come inside her was primitive. It was a conquest and surrender in one. I had wanted to fuck her raw before I’d even had her the first time, before I knew definitively how explosive it would be between us. I’d gone so far as to warn her prior to our first date that I needed it, needed her to give me that, something I’d never wanted with anyone else. “Don’t move,” I said roughly, sliding over her while she was still stretched out on her stomach. My hand pushed between her hip and the bed, reaching between her legs to cup her cunt in my palm. She was moist and warm. My stroking fingers made her slick and hot. She muffled a moan. “I want you just like this,” I told her, brushing my lips across her cheek. Reaching for my pillow with my free hand, I yanked it over and then shoved it under her, lifting her hips to an angle that would let me sink balls-deep. “Gideon . . .” The way she said my name was a plea, as if I wouldn’t get down on my knees and beg for the privilege of having her. I shifted, urging her legs apart and pinning her wrists beside her head. Holding her down, I thrust into her. She was ready for me, plush and tight and wet. My teeth gritted together to restrain the growl that surged from my throat, a tremor racking my body from head to toe. My chest heaved against her back, my violent exhalations ruffling her hair lying across the pillow. Just like that, just by taking me, she had me right on the edge. “God.” My hips churned without volition, screwing my cock into her, pushing me deeper until I was in her to the hilt. I could feel her all around me, from root to tip, clenching in ripples that milked me like a greedy little mouth. “Angel—” The pressure at the base of my dick was insistent, but I was capable of staving it off. It wasn’t a question of control, but of will. I wanted to come inside her. Wanted it enough to consider the risk—as terrifying as it was—acceptable. Closing my eyes, I dropped my forehead to her cheek. I inhaled the scent of her and let go, coming hard, my ass flexing as I filled her up in thick, hot spurts. Eva whimpered, writhing under me. Her cunt tightened, then trembled around my cock. She climaxed with a soft, sweet moan. I growled her name, searingly aroused by her orgasm. She came because I did, because my pleasure turned her on as much as my touch. I would reward her for that, show her the depth of my gratitude. She would get hers, over and over again, as many times as she could take it. “Eva.” I rubbed my damp cheek against hers. “Crossfire.” Her fingers tightened their grip on mine. Her head turned, her lips seeking. “Ace,” she breathed into the kiss. “I love you, too.” — IT was shortly after five in the evening when I drove the Bentley through the gates of the Vidal estate in Dutchess County and into the circular drive out front. “Aw, you drove too fast,” Ireland complained from the backseat. “We’re here already.” I put the SUV in park and left it idling. One look at the house, and a knot tightened in my gut. Eva reached over, taking my hand and giving it a squeeze. I focused on her steely gray eyes instead of the Tudor-style mansion at her back. She didn’t say a word, but she didn’t have to. I felt her love and support and saw the glimmer of anger in her eyes. Just knowing she understood gave me strength. She knew every dark and dirty secret I had, and yet she believed and loved me anyway.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captivated-by-you-crossfire-4/page-25.html","bookId":1816,"book":{"id":1816,"title":"Captivated by You (Crossfire #4)","description":"Storyline: Captivated By You: by Sylvia Day (Book 4) | Summary \u0026 Analysis This is a Summary \u0026 Analysis.
