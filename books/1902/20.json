It appealed to his protective side. Of course, a smart Master knew that a fully Dominant nature had to be reined in, the same way a submissive couldn’t allow her own cravings to overwhelm her self-determination. Right now, he had to hold on to that balance for both of them. When she got her feet back under her, she could help him keep his urges in check, with that smart mouth he knew she had.\\n\\n The thought warmed him, made him smile. Tenderness swamped him as he saw she’d fallen asleep. He held her cradled between his knees, moving slow and steady through the waters she’d feared earlier. One step at a time, one fear at a time.\\n\\n Despite her murmured protest that she could walk, when he tied them off at the dock, he carried her up the boardwalk, into the house and to their bedroom, laying her on the covers. “I’ll go run you a bath while you wake up a bit, sweetheart.”\\n\\n “My own personal servant,” she said groggily, but there was an impudent quirk to her lips. “Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?”\\n\\n “When a Master demands it, a slave serves, and serves him well. But a Master takes good care of his slave. That’s the way it works.”\\n\\n Her lips pressed together. While her green gaze was sadly vacant, a yearning expression filled it abruptly. “We want you, Master,” she said in a throaty voice. “Please. Soft and quiet, here on the bed. Let me know you’re here, a part of me.” That expression reflected a desperate desire to believe in what he was offering, spoken and unspoken. It was also a painful reminder that, as much as he wanted to do so, he couldn’t heal everything within her in a couple days. Even the goals he’d set, to pull her back from the desolate edge of darkness and help her find the courage to stay with him, might be more than could be accomplished in the time he had.\\n\\n No. If that was all the time he had, he would make it work.\\n\\n He could tease her, play with her, drive her to screaming climax, but in the face of that appeal for lovemaking, he was the one at her mercy. Unfastening her jeans, he took them off her legs, along with socks and shoes. He kept the tee on, liking the way her nipples pushed against the fabric, the points sharp in their arousal. If she curled her arms around him, would he lose all control? Bury himself in her, surround her and never let her be a foot away from him?\\n\\n “I’m not sure this is the right time for this,” he said quietly.\\n\\n “No one’s touched me for so long, Peter. Not like this. Like I’m real and . . .”\\n\\n “Not broken?”\\n\\n Reaching up, she touched his face. “Yeah. But I am broken, aren’t I?” She was killing him. He circled her wrist, held it and turned his mouth into her palm, nuzzling. “You’re wounded, sweetheart. That’s all. You’ll heal, if you give yourself a chance.”\\n\\n Her fingers curled into his shirt, nails biting in. “I need you so badly right now. All the way into my heart.”\\n\\n “I want to give you that. But . . . I don’t want to piss you off, sweetheart, but I really don’t think you’re ready. I also think it’ll be better for you tonight, if we hold off, build it up in you.” In the face of her whispered plea, the emotions she was tearing loose in his chest, he couldn’t hold on to the stern Master he knew he should be. Blowing out a breath, he drew her hand down so she could feel she wasn’t alone in her desire. “Hell, this is a bitch for me, too.”\\n\\n Dana swallowed at the size of him. “Do you have to be so damned honorable?”\\n\\n “Believe me, honorable is not the deal here.” He molded her fingers over him, held her grip there tight. “I don’t want to win the battle, Dana. I want to take the field, win the war. When I make love to you in this bed, it’s going to be because you’ve accepted you’re with the man and the Master you want for the rest of your life.”\\n\\n “Peter, there’s no way. . . . We barely know each other.”\\n\\n “That ground’s already been covered, sweetheart. Come on. Let’s get that bug spray off of you and start getting you pampered and prepped for later tonight.”\\n\\n “You promised . . . that you’d give me something to make me not afraid.”\\n\\n “I will. After a bath. Now, stop being all puppyish or I’ll give you a spanking for turning your Master into a big softy.”\\n\\n He wondered if she realized how close he was to his own edge, particularly as he watched her struggle to rein it back in. Then her chin lifted. “I bet you cry at Hallmark movies.”\\n\\n “To even suggest I watch Hallmark movies is pushing past the line, little girl.” Lifting her and taking a quick nip at her quivering mouth, he took her to the tub. As he ran the water, he removed her T-shirt, grazing his knuckles over the taut peaks.\\n\\n “You do like tits, don’t you?” she gasped.\\n\\n “More than God and country,” he said gravely. “And yours are gorgeous.” He guided her in, helped her sit and adjusted the temperature. “Open your legs.” Surprise crossed her face, but she complied. Removing the small waterproof dual-headed vibrator from a drawer, he caressed her inner thighs with it, letting her get a sense of what he was doing before easing it into her pussy and her anus. She had gorgeous legs, and though they were out of shape now, the skin was still silky, giving. He couldn’t help thinking of how they’d feel wrapped around his back. He teased dark curls before he positioned the device and she bit her lip, her nipples hardening further.\\n\\n It had no more than an inch of penetration, slim straps anchoring it in place and allowing him to position the clit teaser. She did that little breath-caught-in-the-throat thing while he made the adjustment, but when he turned it on a low level, her response was gratifying. She arched up, water sloshing against the sides, her nipples jutting further, challenging him to prove the truth of his convictions. Sliding his hand beneath her back, he brought his mouth to the closest one, taking it in like a small, swollen grape, suckling it so that she pushed her feet against the end of the tub, moving rhythmically against the vibrator. He laid his hands on her hips, stilling her.\\n\\n “Enough of that. You stay still, move only as I need you to move. Your pretty pussy is going to weep and ache for my cock and the release I’ll grant it later tonight. This is all about preparing you to serve me tonight, any way I demand. I know you haven’t forgotten how to serve a Master.”\\n\\n Her pulse elevated in her throat, her fingers curling under the water against her trembling thighs. God, she was going to kill him. She responded to his every order. Whether with sass and fire or soft entreaties, or tentative trust, she responded. And whether or not she realized it, by responding as a submissive, she was responding as the unwounded spirit he knew still lay within her.\\n\\n It was a cynical world, one that had long ago abandoned love-at-first-sight to the very young and foolish. But his gut didn’t lie to him, and her response to him told him he was right. It connected to things down deep in both their souls; he was sure of it. If she’d come back whole, he would have pursued her surrender as fiercely as he was doing now.\\n\\n Could he convince her of that, in less than forty-eight hours?\\n\\n By the time he let Dana out of the tub, she was very clean and completely mindless.\\n\\n Since she had to clutch his shirt for balance as he walked her backward into the bedroom, she eagerly traced the way his waist muscles shifted with the movement, his abdomen tensing with self-restraint. When he left her standing in the middle of the room, he squeezed her hands, held on to them to the full reach of their arms before regretfully letting her go. It might be how aroused she was, but as she listened to him rustle in the closet, Dana actually felt as if he might be seeing a beautiful submissive standing in the center of his bedroom, her ass cocked in a provocative manner, the slim line of spine and nape so tempting, particularly with his collar still on her throat. He hadn’t yet taken it off, and she didn’t want him to do so.\\n\\n She still wore his toy, though he’d added a harness to hold it in place. The dual vibrator changed speeds and sensations frequently, keeping her at a high peak. If his intent was to prepare her for tonight, she was ready. Hell, at this point, she might do a whole football team, if it meant Peter’s cock would slide into her at the end, bringing her home inside herself.\\n\\n The unexpected thought brought a lurch of emotion.\\n\\n “Come stand over here, by the bed.” When he got her there, he sat down on it, trapping her between his knees, settling his hands on her hips. That mere touch made her moan, thrust toward him shamelessly. He kneaded her buttocks, soothing and stirring at once.\\n\\n “That’s it, baby. You’re so hot for me now, aren’t you?” Spreading his fingers, he tapped on the anal plug, making her grab hold of him for balance. “Tonight there are a couple things I want you to do for me. One, accept that you’re beautiful. No hunching over, hiding yourself. Second, remember that you can trust me completely. I promise I’ll keep you safe. There will be nothing for you to fear. All right?” Though she jerked her head in a nod, she couldn’t help the frisson of worry that shivered across her skin. His hands tightened on her. “I know it’s going to be difficult. Which is why I think an additional training aid is necessary to focus your mind where it should be focused.”\\n\\n His hands left her as he picked something up. “We talked about this, that first night. I’m going to wrap you in a physical reminder of your Master’s protection, my demand for your obedience to my will.”\\n\\n The stiff satin caressed her flesh, laces feathering across her skin.\\n\\n A corset.\\n\\n . . . keeping her straight and proud, knowing she’s got nothing to worry about. Because she’s mine.\\n\\n “You liked that idea, wanted it bad. I could tell, enough that I wished I’d had one around that night. I even started a letter that would give you a play-by-play of how I’d lace you into one, but two paragraphs in, I was so hard I knew I couldn’t finish it without embarrassing myself. This one isn’t as custom fitted as I like, but we’ll get you one that is soon. Lift your arms over your head.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-bound-knights-of-the-board-room-3/page-20.html","bookId":1902,"book":{"id":1902,"title":"Honor Bound (Knights of the Board Room #3)","description":"Storyline: Honor Bound (Knights of the Board Room #3) \\n Peter Winston is a successful business man and a captain in the National Guard.
