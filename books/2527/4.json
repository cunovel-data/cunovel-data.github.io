She held onto the sink breathing slowly, watching the steel grates lift by timer just as dawn broke. She kept her eyes on the new rose-orange-hued horizon, and didn\u0027t turn when she felt a massive male presence at her back cast a shadow in the doorway.\\n\\n Then she closed her eyes and waited. A pair of male feet would hit the hallway soon. She could feel the weight of the heavy heart coming toward her. The air got denser, literally thickened around her before she heard the first footfall. There was only one guardian in the house that she knew held such private pain. He had a black box around his emotions that was so hidden even she couldn\u0027t reach into it.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Rider,\" she murmured over a sip of mint tea without opening her eyes.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he grumbled and plopped down in a chair.\\n\\n \"You want some coffee?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t wait for the response as she heard the flask hit the table. Marlene simply went to the counter, and brought back a steaming mug as she came back to sit with Rider. She appraised the cloudy colors around him, noting that his aura had a roiling anger tingeing it. His normal turquoise and light earth tones were dark, smoldering, swirling furiously, and growing, unlike Mike\u0027s tight gray line. All of the guardians had gray in their auras now.\\n\\n Rider\u0027s white T-shirt was so crummy and so raggedy that it might as well have been the same color as his beat-up, cut-off shorts - gray. Marlene let out a long, weary sigh.\\n\\n He gave her a sheepish glance and unscrewed his flask. \"Tryin\u0027 ta bite the snake that bit me,\" he said, pouring a healthy jigger into his mug, nearly overflowing it. He leaned over and slurped down the coffee and Jack Daniel\u0027s concoction without lifting the mug.\\n\\n \"Oh, shit, Mar,\" Rider said, taking another sip, making a noise like he was clearing his sinuses while he shut his eyes tightly, then he abandoned the mug and went straight for the flask. He turned it up to his mouth and winced when he pulled it away, swallowing hard. \"Getting too old for this.\"\\n\\n \"I know, baby.\" Marlene covered his hand, then patted it before drawing it back to reach for her teacup.\\n\\n \"My boy, Jose, is all messed up. Got a newbie, Dan, that\u0027s totally battle-freaked - I mean, the kid\u0027s real first time out was in Hell... c\u0027mon, Mar. Kid\u0027s got nightmares like he\u0027s been to \u0027Nam. The prep time to get these kids ready is spinning by us fast like an out-of-control top. Now, Damali? Our Neteru gets her heart ripped out in Hell? It ain\u0027t fair, Marlene, I\u0027m telling you.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But she\u0027ll have to work through the anger and the grief on her own - just like everything else. We can\u0027t help her with that, all we can do is support and guide her, now that she\u0027s grown. Good people die every day. That\u0027s why we do what we do, to trim those numbers back.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not going to get over this, Marlene.\" He looked at Marlene hard. \"This ain\u0027t like when we lost the others.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all you can say, \u0027I know\u0027?\" Rider stood up and walked over to the sink to lean on it. \"Big Mike\u0027s hearing is off, and the poor bastard doesn\u0027t even want to eat. He ain\u0027t about chasing tail with me... I couldn\u0027t even tempt him with a little day trip to New Orleans.\" Rider sighed hard and rubbed the gray-and-blond stubble on his jaw. \"I tried to get Jose to ride with me, like old times, go watch a few ladies dance the poles...\" He shook his head. \"Young buck wouldn\u0027t even take the bait. Sits by Damali like a hurt puppy until she gets up and leaves, then waits till she gets back. It ain\u0027t healthy. Dan\u0027s scared to even leave the compound. That boy is young, he needs to get out before he snaps.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"And Damali ain\u0027t far behind him. She comes in here every morning smelling like sulfur and demon innards - not like she\u0027s been out having fun.\" Rider pointed to his nose and glared at Marlene. \"I may be old, and my nose may be off, but if she\u0027d found a diversion, I\u0027da smelled him on her. This shit ain\u0027t healthy. But she\u0027s probably afraid to risk being with an innocent, if there\u0027s still master vamps out there hunting her down. The child might as well be living in a convent, Marlene! And, who knows, after losing Rivera, she just might do that.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Will you stop with the \u0027I know,\u0027 Madame seer? What\u0027re we gonna do?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Rider took another chug from his flask. \"Marlene, you are making me nuts this morning. I swear I don\u0027t know how Shabazz deals with it.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" she said, chuckling. \"Give everybody some time. We lost a guardian down there,\" she said, her voice growing quiet. \"That\u0027s a hard loss. But she\u0027ll come around.\"\\n\\n \"No, Mar,\" Rider said, wiping his mouth with his forearm. \"We lost our Neteru\u0027s soul mate. That\u0027s not a loss, that\u0027s a cosmic catastrophe.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" she said very calmly, but very carefully. \"How\u0027s your nose? You said it was off.\"\\n\\n \"Fucked up.\"\\n\\n Marlene nodded. \"And Mike\u0027s hearing?\"\\n\\n \"Jacked.\" Rider pushed off the sink. \"Jose\u0027s nose is, too. Dan can\u0027t shoot the broadside off a barn - his tactical senses are fried. JL, and I could always count on JL, but our little brother got caught counting cards and almost got iced at the casinos in Vegas... if JL can\u0027t do mental sleight of hand, then...\"\\n\\n \"I know. Shabazz ain\u0027t exactly right, either - \"\\n\\n \"But I bet his ass sleeps at night!\"\\n\\n Rider walked a hot path between the sink and the door, took a hard swallow of liquor, and glared at Marlene. She just stared at him, keeping her voice a murmur as she spoke to him, trying to heal him while not addressing what he\u0027d said about Shabazz. It was the truth, and it suddenly disturbed her. She and Shabazz had been the first ones to shake off the grief, and she\u0027d chalked it up to the fact that they were the elder guardians in the group.\\n\\n But as she studied Rider\u0027s very personal reaction to Damali\u0027s inner pain, she wondered why. Something didn\u0027t jive. Rider had been in battles before; they\u0027d lost crew before. All of them loved Damali like a daughter or a sister, except Jose, who perhaps felt something more. And they\u0027d all seen Damali bounce back, too. But that Rider\u0027s head was so twisted about the incident, horrible though it was, gave her pause.\\n\\n \"Rider,\" she said, her voice as gentle as she could make it, \"my third eye is nearly blind. All I get is impressions, no sharp images. We\u0027ve all got a lot on our minds. As long as the masthead of the ship is broken, we have no way to raise sails. We\u0027re dead in the water until her aura lifts, the gray goes out of it. We\u0027re all connected, Rider, that\u0027s why I keep saying, \u0027I know.\u0027\"\\n\\n Marlene sighed when he didn\u0027t respond but took another drink from his flask, glowering at her. \"If you take the fellas to a hangout, go find some entertainment, bring back lighter energy... who knows? You have to shake the horrible images you saw down in the pit, maybe it will help her?\" She had to give him something constructive to do. Rider had no patience, never did.\\n\\n Rider looked out the window. \"It wasn\u0027t the horrible images that we saw that are messing us up, Mar. It\u0027s the beautiful ones that are a bitch.\"\\n\\n She studied his back. \"Talk to me.\" A shiver ran down her spine.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the seer of this group, and if you didn\u0027t see it, then your senses must really be off big-time... I guess I can\u0027t be mad at you for being so blind. Third eye or not, you have no frame of reference and like all of us, you\u0027re human.\" His tone became gentler, resigned, as though beaten down by sudden fatigue. \"My bad, Mar. I\u0027m just rambling. We all take everybody\u0027s skills for granted, and we\u0027ve just gotten used to you being the all-seeing Marlene with the answers. I\u0027m sorry. That\u0027s not fair. I\u0027m going to bed.\"\\n\\n She stood and came to him, resting her hand on his shoulder so he wouldn\u0027t leave. \"Rider?\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t understand - you have Shabazz.\" He looked at her; his voice was gravelly but held no judgment or sarcasm in it. \"You and Shabazz are the only guardians on the team that have paired up. We saw it in Hell.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" Her hand left his shoulder and her arms went around her waist. He was scaring her. \"We fought just as hard as anyone down there. You think because he and I are paired that we would have let any of you get harmed without a fight, would have saved ourselves and let you fellas die?\" She was incredulous.\\n\\n Tears filled her eyes. Rider\u0027s accusation had hurt her to the bone. She flinched away from him when he reached to cup her cheek.\\n\\n \"No, Mar. You read me wrong.\"\\n\\n She began to slowly relax, watching his pained expression and the quick moisture that had formed in his eyes. The way he looked at her made her nervous to hear the raw truth for the first time since the team had come together. That terrible seesaw of emotion was further eclipsing her ability to read him. She practically held her breath as she waited for him to explain.\\n\\n \"There comes a point in every man\u0027s life, Mar, where he wakes up and doesn\u0027t want a gorgeous thing that dances the pole beside him. It ain\u0027t enough. Feeds the body, but doesn\u0027t feed the soul.\" His eyes held hers and he kept his voice gentle as he pushed a stray lock over her shoulder and sighed. \"Comes a point where you just don\u0027t want an easily interchangeable somebody, you want a woman who you\u0027ll call by name... who you\u0027ll, as a man, walk through the fire for... will lay down your life for, if you have to.\"\\n\\n He shook his head and walked away from her, raking his fingers through his tousled hair. \"Mike saw it, and the big guy is done with New Orleans\u0027s finest. Jose saw it, and... he\u0027s messed up. He came close to having that with Dee Dee, even though I suspect she was never the real McCoy - but at least the boy had hope. Dan saw it, and knows that at his age, living like this, he can\u0027t bring anybody home and set up housekeeping. JL saw it, and wigged.\" He eyed Marlene carefully, but there was no malice in his expression. \"JL headed right for the casinos. And, if I were a bettin\u0027 man, I\u0027d say he took a month\u0027s salary to the blackjack table to double-down on a way out.\"\\n\\n \"What...\" Marlene\u0027s voice caught in her throat on a horrified whisper.\\n\\n \"Yep. Was probably trying to figure out how to win enough to finance then set up a small safe house with every piece of electronic-surveillance and high-tech weapons-launching gizmos available, so if he did find somebody - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, no...\" Marlene closed her eyes. \"I thought he was just letting off steam, like you guys always do after a battle.\"\\n\\n Rider shook his head. \"Why you think JL got in trouble, couldn\u0027t concentrate, when of all the guardians, save you and Shabazz, JL has laser focus? That\u0027s why he\u0027s our equipment man, our weapons\u0027 room expert. Have you seen him tinkering with his gadgets and computers lately?\" He paused and waited for Marlene\u0027s nonverbal response. \"My point, exactly. He just takes his post, stares at the monitors, looking right through them, and then goes to bed at daybreak.\" Rider took a slow swallow of Jack Daniels and then let his breath out hard. \"The only brother that\u0027s straight in here is Shabazz.\"\\n\\n Marlene felt for the side of the sink and found it so she could lean against it to keep herself from falling down. It was all so clear, and she\u0027d been so blind. It wasn\u0027t just Damali who was grieving, or the team just grieving for her...\\n\\n Rider nodded, his lopsided smile holding hollow triumph. \"You following me? These guys are all reevaluating their entire lives. It wasn\u0027t the demons they saw and killed. It wasn\u0027t Damali\u0027s battery going down from grief. They are grieving their choice to become guardians, because after the adrenaline subsided, and they had time to think, their reality is fucking them up. Won\u0027t be no wife and kids. Won\u0027t be no regular life. Nobody special, and unless she comes packing with ammo, she\u0027s shark bait - and they know it. They also know, for the first time, having visited Hell, just how helpless they are to protect a regular woman, especially after coming so close to losing a Neteru on their watch. The whole thing spooked \u0027em, and fucked them around good.\"\\n\\n He looked away from Marlene, studying the sun. \"I\u0027ve accepted my fate... did when Tara turned. I don\u0027t even take myself there anymore - which is why I watch the ladies dance the poles, indulge myself stupid, and numb any useless thought when I start going down memory lane.\"\\n\\n \"Rider, you\u0027ve gotta stop drinking... and if the guys are looking for real life-mates, they won\u0027t find them in the clubs or hoochie bars, brother.\" She wasn\u0027t scolding him. Her voice was filled with so much hurt for him and the others that it was hard to speak.\\n\\n He chuckled and kept his gaze on the horizon. \"Solves a short-term male problem. But the fact that that\u0027s getting old... hey. The long-term solution is very complicated. My boys and I are caught between a rock and a hard place,\" he said, his chuckle hollow and waning. \"Literally. And this shit is gonna go on for the next twenty-five years. Might as well tell these boys to join up with Father Pat\u0027s Covenant. They\u0027ve accepted their fate, too, for different reasons. But, hey, a monk is a monk.\"\\n\\n She was going to walk toward him, but thought better of it. He needed space. So, instead, she spoke softly, trying to dispense hope and healing with her words. \"Somebody will come along for each guardian... I mean...\" Her own lack of confidence in what she was saying just made the sentence trail off. What could she say?\\n\\n \"You got a vision, a bead on this, Mar? A gut hunch? Or are you just trying to make this old warrior feel better?\"\\n\\n It took her too long to answer him. They both knew she wouldn\u0027t lie straight to his face. All she could do was shake her head. \"My visions have been off... I haven\u0027t specifically seen... but that doesn\u0027t mean - in the future, it may not have materialized yet, but - \"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t your fault. Even you can\u0027t conjure up what\u0027s not out there.\" He took another swig and winced. \"I already found my somebody once and lost her to a vampire turn. That was it for me. Had a name I used to call, don\u0027t want the heartbreak of losing another one. I know what the girl is going through, Mar. But Damali never even got to...\"\\n\\n Rider took another fast sip, but his hand was shaking as he brought the flask away from his mouth.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m done. But a lotta guys in here aren\u0027t. They still want that. And, Mar, you\u0027ve got a whole team of young bucks about to be all screwed up like Damali is now. Me and Mike, we\u0027re older, and can hang. We\u0027ve crossed the line and ain\u0027t sitting up at night thinking about a future wife and kids and shit.\"\\n\\n \"Oh... Rider... but, you said in Hell... in the battle... why would being there - \"\\n\\n He chuckled sadly. \"In all the places in the universe, where you\u0027d least expect to see it - I\u0027da lost that bet, if you\u0027da told me. It\u0027s a man thing, and Marlene, you definitely wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"Try me,\" she whispered, her voice tense with worry. \"Because, Rider, I really need to know how to heal this team, if possible.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t fix this, Marlene. That\u0027s what we all know, and what\u0027s fucking up every man in here.\" He began slowly pacing, raking his fingers through his hair, looking at the floor, his voice so thick with emotion that she almost couldn\u0027t hear him.\\n\\n \"All right. Here we are, Mar, strapped to the nines, standing in the middle of a battle. Shells flying, fucking demons everywhere, green gook exploding, all-out mortal combat... a damned master vampire in our midst, serious battle hazard close by, adrenaline kickin\u0027 like a mo\u0027fo, everybody in there ready to go down, knowing any of us could at any time... the priest\u0027s squad is getting slaughtered, we had to do some of our own to keep them from turning, got a Neteru going through changes... dragging bloody wounded that\u0027s drawing Hell sharks, almost out of ammo. Rivera had a firestorm coming his way, was hungry, exhausted, and should have used all twelve of us that were left standing to feed.\" Rider looked up at her. \"We were in Hell, Marlene. Right? We weren\u0027t in Kansas, Dorothy.\"\\n\\n She could only nod and stare back at him.\\n\\n \"If he\u0027d snapped our necks, tranced her out, and fed well, he would have had enough energy to transport her out of there and start a damned empire.\" Rider paused, letting the silence in the kitchen envelop them. \"But he didn\u0027t, did he?\"\\n\\n Rider pulled a hair out of his head fast with two fingers and thrust it toward Marlene. \"The line of choice made within seconds was as thin as this,\" he said, gesturing with his hand, \"and could have gotten snatched in the wrong direction as fast as I just pulled this hair out of my head, Mar. And the one who had the fragile balance of choice was a damned guardian that had turned. A male vampire. Not just our Neteru. If the dude had decided differently...\"\\n\\n Rider sucked in a shaky breath. \"I done seen a lot of battle, Mar, but even for me, that was deep. In seconds he could have done us and saved himself, and took a bride.\"\\n\\n \"Oh... Shit...\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Rider nicked away the hair and crossed his arms over his chest, biceps bulging as his body tensed. He looked down at the flask he was clasping with disdain.\\n\\n \"Rivera begged her to leave him, made us pull her out while she was ovulating, turned around and watched our backs - not just hers, but the whole family, just because we mattered to her. Fought on low fuel, and got fucked by whatever was coming through the tunnels. Just for her. Even if he wanted her away from the battle zone, he could have snatched one of us to feed on just to even his odds and perhaps save his own ass - but he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Rider held Marlene\u0027s gaze captive, his expression grave. \"We all saw love transcend Hell, Marlene. Saw the most advanced predator in the demon food chain give up a prize that he\u0027d battled another master for, and won... just so the girl could live a normal life topside. That shit right there would give any man pause... will make you reevaluate your entire existence. And, if you\u0027re a believer, it\u0027ll make you have a loooong conversation with the man upstairs about all the shit you\u0027ve done wrong.\"\\n\\n He nodded and took another swig from his flask when Marlene closed her eyes.\\n\\n \"Will make you argue with Him about justice, too,\" Rider said, renewed rage at the unfairness of it all keeping his voice a low rumble. \"Rivera was one of ours, wasn\u0027t supposed to turn - definitely wasn\u0027t supposed to go out like that. And we had to leave him, just because of what he was. But judging by the way the man fought... yeah, he was one of ours. By rights, who knows, maybe we shoulda stayed? That\u0027s part of what\u0027s tumbling around in that girl\u0027s brain, just like it\u0027s tumbling around in all of ours, causing survivor\u0027s guilt, too.\" Rider saluted Marlene with his flask. \"Respect. He went out with honor. Just like a guardian. This is man-type shit, Marlene. Don\u0027t try to figure it out or heal it. This conversation stays A and B.\"\\n\\n He glanced at her again as he moved to the kitchen door. \"Shabazz got a second chance to get out of prison and find somebody, I got a second chance not to die... Mike got a second chance not to die�we all did, so did you. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but Rider, the kids have time.\"\\n\\n \"The young bucks on the team never even got a shot off,\" he said, pure frustration in his voice that turned into bitter defeat. \"Where\u0027s Rivera\u0027s get-out-of-jail-free redemption pass, huh? Where\u0027s Damali\u0027s? Where the fuck is Jose\u0027s? Dan and JL ain\u0027t even smelled love, let alone felt it - and in here, under these circumstances, they probably won\u0027t. Our entire younger level will not replace itself, won\u0027t heal. This shit is not right, Mar, and that\u0027s why the team\u0027s not right. The trinity of energy is the masthead that broke, Mar, when this crap broke our girl\u0027s back and we had to watch it. We won the battle down there, but the dark side is winning the war - our spirits ain\u0027t right. Everybody is losing faith. Hope... shit, that\u0027s history. Love,\" he said, shaking his head, \"is really fucked up for almost everybody around here. Not even a possibility. If we saw those two connect, woulda gave the rest of us hope, renewed faith, and maybe a little encouragement to keep looking for the one.\"\\n\\n \"Rider,\" she said, her voice as gentle as she could make it, \"in time... with patience...\"\\n\\n \"Whatever. All I know is, I\u0027ma kill Rivera for dying on my watch in front of my team. Every man, not just guardians, I mean regular average Joes, are searching for his own Neteru, Mar, even though we\u0027re human.\" He looked at her, his eyes hard. \"Every man is looking for the one that will make him walk through fire.\"\\n\\n Marlene closed her eyes and continued to lean against the sink. What was there to tell the man? Shabazz wouldn\u0027t even talk about it. Now she understood why. Double survivor\u0027s guilt... he\u0027d made it out alive, and still had a life mate. As a blessed man, he was grieving his heart out for his brothers, knowing they didn\u0027t have what he did, but he couldn\u0027t fix it. Shabazz always had profound philosophy, wisdom to impart. But, this time, there were no words he could offer. They\u0027d isolated him from their grief, he couldn\u0027t share their pain over a beer - it would be like a wealthy man telling a homeless person he understood his pain, not credible... salt in the wound.\\n\\n Her soul was so heavy that she couldn\u0027t even cry. It took another male to explain what even a mother-seer couldn\u0027t see. And damn it, it all made so much sense now why her lover wouldn\u0027t come to bed with her at night, or touch her in the compound with the other guardians still home. It was beyond worry for Damali. It was beyond post-battle trauma or introspection. The family was disintegrating around them.\\n\\n Her voice was just a slow whisper as she formed words to respond to Rider\u0027s truth. Didn\u0027t matter that it was. Rider was already gone. So she spoke to the empty kitchen.\\n\\n \"Oh, God, it isn\u0027t fair. I know.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunted-vampire-huntress-legend-3/page-4.html","bookId":2527,"book":{"id":2527,"title":"The Hunted (Vampire Huntress Legend #3)","description":"Storyline: The Hunted (Vampire Huntress Legend #3) \\n Each millennium brings a new Neteru, a vampire huntress whose mission is to vanquish evil from the world.
