{"id":109499,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Chapter Fifteen \"A couple of issues,\" Carlos said slowly, putting his hands behind his back. Spending a whole twenty-four hours underground waiting on resources was nearly more than his nerves could stand. Each time he had to come before the table put his survival on the line. But he needed the resources badly enough to withstand the drama. Still, he hated having to rely on others to bestow anything on him. Following protocol, Carlos waited until receiving the chairman\u0027s nod, and he ignored the scowl coming from the counselor at the table. \"There are four clerics, that no doubt, you have seen me interact with?\" The chairman smiled and made a tent with his fingers in front of his mouth, only nodding. \"Infidel!\" The chairman held his hand up to the counselor. \"Speak.\" \"These men are how I have an exact location of the huntress. Between my comprise of them,\" Carlos said quickly, \"and of her guardians, I can get to her at will.\" A half smile appeared on Carlos\u0027s face. \"One of them, I believe, is a lower gen. An eighth or ninth in my line. How can I use him?\" The chairman sighed. \"Insignificant. By that generational level, his effectiveness is so diluted and his status within our ranks is so negligible... they\u0027re not even what I\u0027d consider true vampires. They\u0027re a subclass of a subclass, an actual embarrassment to all we hold dear. After the fourth generation, they can\u0027t even produce fangs - totally useless vermin.\" \"But he\u0027s a tracker, and a cleric, and can cross prayer lines. Our Neteru trusts him because he wears a collar. So do the others.\" Carlos waited, his gaze locking with the chairman\u0027s. The chairman lowered his hands, his smile broadening. His countenance relaxed. \"Yes. As always, done with flair, Rivera. But your point?\" \"I need them to be off limits... if they get rushed, or bitten - \" \"No one will flush your hunt and terminate your compromised informants while you are abroad, Mr. Rivera... will they, Mr. Counselor?\" The chairman shot a warning glance toward the counselor and then looked at Carlos. \"I do understand your concern about things going awry in your absence... another reason I insisted on this meeting before you left - so that we are all clear.\" He cast his narrowed gaze around the five points of the pentagram-shaped table, and waited for nods of agreement before speaking. \"If you find your travels expand, simply call an exterminator, look into its eyes, and a safe location will be shown to you.\" Imperceptibly, Carlos let out his breath. That\u0027s all he\u0027d need was to come back to the cabin and find four corpses. Not to mention, the last thing he\u0027d need would be to have Damali\u0027s crew wiped out over there. That would freak her out and send her into a spiral of pain that she\u0027d never recover from. \"This is your mission, Mr. Rivera. We are all clear... albeit your methods are unorthodox, they have been effective thus far.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to be sure they don\u0027t take a body while we\u0027re in Brazil. Can\u0027t have it. Over there, I call the shots, or send me alone. This part is nonnegotiable.\" \"Are you mad, Rivera!\" The counselor was on his feet, and two of the exterminator bodyguards snarled their discontent at Carlos\u0027s statement. \"These are highly skilled, trained assassins that eat well. We\u0027ve removed them from our borders, at your request, for this ill-fated mission to collect a girl that will probably get on a flight after shopping! This is valuable vampire power gone to waste, and now you don\u0027t want to feed them in one of the adrenaline capitals on the planet? Mr. Chairman,\" he urged, opening his arms so wide that his black robes swept the table, \"we cannot continue to suffer these offenses, these indignities. These methods are of a rank amateur who hasn\u0027t - \" \"You draw a hotel or stadium police sweep, and get foreigners detained at the airports, you make my job harder,\" Carlos argued coolly. \"Obviously, it\u0027s been a while since you\u0027ve been topside. This is my era, the twenty-first century - it ain\u0027t the horse and buggy days.\" \"I am from the Roman era, when evil was at its apex on the planet - as was shrewd, duplicitous politics and aggression. The days of chariots; not horse and buggies. So don\u0027t you dare presume - \" \"You make her afraid, or worse, flush her to go hunting, you\u0027ll take my cargo deeper into the badlands of the Amazon jungle looking for the source of what ate a few concertgoers. Hurt her team, and she\u0027ll never leave Brazil until she finds out what killed some of her guys. That\u0027s Neteru nature... if you ever had one, you\u0027d know, motherfucker.\" Carlos studied his nails as he spoke, and then glanced at his watch. The counselor didn\u0027t have an immediate comeback and was silent. The chairman seemed amused. The others at the table appeared anxious for a heart-ripping to take place - and from the looks of their expressions, it was a fifty-fifty split who they were betting on. Whatever. He was wasting time. The concert was probably almost over, and he needed to get to Damali while he was still sure of exactly where she\u0027d be. All he needed was to have to search through the clubs and hangouts all over Rio to find her; some poor innocent might become his dinner. \"There\u0027s plenty of drug dealers in the jungle hiding cocaine and heroin plantations that the authorities won\u0027t miss, or don\u0027t care about, and that the Neteru won\u0027t be upset about if you guys get hungryï¿½just make it look clean, like a dispute went down, not a feeding. The boys,\" he added, motioning toward the exterminators, \"will get one helluva adrenaline rush along with a nice hit of coke or reefer. That\u0027s a fair compromise. But tourists and locals, if you\u0027re going with me, are off limits. Besides, I hear water buffaloes pack a wallop - if you stampede them first.\" The robed entities nodded, as did the chairman. The counselor sat slowly, seething, but with no option. The logic of Carlos\u0027s argument was rock solid. Yeah, he was definitely getting stronger. \"You are of great value to us, Carlos. Might I suggest that you take a couple of my favorite resources as added insurance... something made for special occasions by our Dark Lord on level seven?\" Before Carlos could answer, the chairman dispatched a ceiling transport bat, and Carlos waited for his unspecified resources, trying to stay cool. A loud commotion beyond the council walls made everyone train their attention towards the sound. Bats screeched in terror, and incessant growls and barks careened through the cavernous space. The front doors flew open, and four super-strength international couriers paired off to restrain the two beasts they held by chains. Beasts, each with six yellow glowing eyes that ringed the circumference of their huge skulls, stood three feet high at the shoulder, their muscular black chests rippling as they scrabbled against the slippery marble floor to get to Carlos, leaving deep gashes in it as they clawed their way forward. Their jaws were so packed with fangs that they couldn\u0027t fully close their mouths, and foamed, slick saliva dripped from them, leaving acid burns in the floor. They flapped their leathery wings, half flying, as they pulled the couriers along the floor, slashing at them with their spaded, double-blade tails. Almost speechless, Carlos knew he had to rescind the request, \"Naw, gentleman. The pit bulls are over the top.\" \"You don\u0027t approve?\" The chairman asked with a smile, then sighed. \"Next time.\" Carlos wasn\u0027t sure how to respond. While the offer was generous, this wasn\u0027t about a few easily willed creatures that could give him a heads-up with a bark... like a coupla security dogs... dayum. \"Yeah, next time. Thanks, though.\" \"As I said, Mr. Rivera, it\u0027s your mission.\" \"We all clear?\" Carlos waited for heads to nod again. \"Make it happen, and bring our cargo back safely,\" the chairman said with a sly smile. But before Carlos could reply, a thunderous rumble made all beings in the room look up at the swirling black messenger cloud that was ever-present in the high, open ceilings of the chamber. Intermittent sound waves sent the swirling mass into a noisy, chaotic screech as domestic couriers in bat form were thrown from the smoky whirlpool, and then reentered it, trying to keep their flight patterns. Red glowing eyes blinked in a frenzy of confusion, as wave after wave of sound shocks disturbed their habitat. \"Oh, shit...\" Carlos laughed. \"We\u0027ve been breached at the chamber level!\" The chairman stood instantly with the council members. The messengers took battle stances. The hounds raced back into the chamber, flanking the chairman and barking up toward the sound. Carlos shook his head. \"Listen to it. Damn... Can\u0027t you hear it?\" The other beings shot their gazes to Carlos, but were still on red alert. Carlos closed his eyes. She\u0027s all that... Girlfriend is breaching the breach. \"Explain!\" The chairman was in no mood for Carlos\u0027s amusement, and snatched the front of Carlos\u0027s suit. But confusion loosened his grip as the hounds began to howl. \"All of you, open up on my channel,\" he murmured. \"Your cargo just kicked things up a level.\" The Vampire Council came from behind their table, and the armed exterminators formed a ring around them. Carlos extended his hand, placing one on the chairman\u0027s shoulder, another on the lead messenger\u0027s. He could barely hold his head up as Shabazz\u0027s bass line rocked him. He could hear Rider\u0027s guitar screaming. A crowd of a hundred thousand was nearly prostrate. He could dig it. The stage was black. Birdcalls and special effects of jaguars roaring had been layered in. Heavy percussion with the bass was breaking the barrier, scattering bats in Hell, a hundred thousand people all jamming, all grooving to the same erotic beat. Drums sounded like thunder. The Vampire Council closed their eyes; the old boys, finally relaxing the hysteria, were catching on. A sliver of red light hit the stage. Carlos felt the chairman\u0027s knees almost give way as the old dude steadied himself against another council member. Then Damali stepped into that crimson splinter, dusted in gold and red glitter. A sheer sheath of blood red netting was all the dress was made of... a serpent covering her breasts and her Venus in a barely concealed wrap of embroidery. She wore a high priestess headdress that had coils in it, seeming almost serpentine as the gold and red in it interleaved into an endless spiral. When she hit the first chord of the song, her voice almost as low as the bass, bats screamed and he shuddered, sending a collective shudder through the assembled group. Moisture came to his eyes. He inhaled deeply. The others did, too, and glanced at each other, stricken by the power of the sensation. Yeah, he remembered. It had only been a few nights. \"Goddamn . . .\" The chairman nodded. The hounds walked in an agitated circle. Even the counselor shook his head, but the look he issued Carlos cut like a blade inside Carlos\u0027s mind. Unable to dislodge himself from the vision, Carlos listened to the sultry sounds she made. Damali\u0027s echoes of lovemaking, a preamble to her lyrics, decimated him. He opened his eyes and his gaze caught the counselor\u0027s expression of pure hatred. It was an eerie concoction, Damali\u0027s voice juxtaposed with Vlak\u0027s venom. Interesting that his hatred competed so virulently with the pull of the Neteru\u0027s voice. He didn\u0027t know such a thing was possible. Carlos glanced around at the other men. Each of them, even the chairman, had been thoroughly seduced by her sultry tone. Their eyes were closed, heads slightly leaned back, as though offering their throats for a sure siphon... their fangs had lowered, and they seemed to be breathing through their barely parted lips. His line of vision went back to the counselor, who fought against the erotic rush Damali produced, his jaw set hard, and his fangs dropped to battle length, not passion length. Something was wrong. \"Don\u0027t you hear me calling...\" she crooned like he\u0027d never heard her voice before. \"Don\u0027t you feel me wanting... don\u0027t you know... don\u0027t you know... ooohhhh, yeaaaah, baby... \u0027cause you know when you do what you do... In the dark... where you do what you do what you do to me, baby... Yeeesss... I\u0027m calling you, Carlos...\" she murmured, talking to the cheering crowd, and then resumed her saxophone wail, sliding up and down the octaves with her voice as though it were her hand tracing his spine. \"In the dark... blood running through my deep river baby... Sisssss... Ohhhhh. In the dark, you feel what you feel when you feel it, baby... Night\u0027s not the same without you in me, baby...\" Then she stepped forward, causing Brazilian police to redouble their efforts, dropped her voice, stretched out her arm, beckoned with one finger, while sliding her other hand in an aching motion down her side. She whispered, the crowd roared, Carlos swallowed hard. Now she was talking co-modena, cash shit. Was challenging him. Whispering into the mic all sexy, walking to the front of the stage. Carlos shook his head, noting that his council\u0027s eyes were slits. \"You know you want this... so stop playing with it... before it burns you, baby. I can\u0027t take it... I\u0027m burning up. Need the night to cool it off.\" She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, leaned her head back and belted out another line full throat. \"In the dark - \" \"I\u0027m out!\" Carlos broke from the group. \"I told you this package was da bomb. Worth any bullshit I gotta go through to protect it. Any questions?\" He walked, no longer concerned about the dogs, as the old vampires just looked stunned. An international exterminator stepped forward. It nodded at its squad, which nodded in return. \"We follow your orders... Damn... You did that?\" The exterminator fell back into formation, simply shaking its head. Carlos gave a brief nod of recognition to the international team. He liked them already. Could hang like his old squad, and were so different from the domestic couriers that got on his nerves. Yeah. Recognize. The chairman, slightly out of breath, held himself up using the table, glancing at the screeching, disoriented mass of domestic couriers and then the full council. \"Give this man whatever it takes to contain this cargo! Whatever is required!\" He was breathing hard as he tried to make his way back to his throne. \"She was doing \u0027the righteous light acts\u0027 before Rivera infected her, now look at her in just ten nights.\" Quiet fell over the group as another disruption sent the bats screeching again. The chairman had tears of appreciation in his eyes. His voice was a mere whisper as he stared at Carlos in awe. \"In just ten nights, Rivera...\" The six-vampire squad simply appeared in the center of the concert throng that was mesmerized by the performance. There was no need to even be smooth. The few people standing nearby started, but obviously assumed that Carlos and his bodyguards had advanced from behind them in the crush of the crowd. He glanced at his messengers who were immediately hit with the adrenaline rush. \"You\u0027re showing fangs, and it ain\u0027t cool. Chill, blend in, and remember what I said. Not here. We all need to fan out. Give me some space. Vamanos!\" Damali\u0027s voice was ripping him apart, but he scanned the terrain as his messengers dissolved into nothingness. The adrenaline level of the audience, the sweat, the blood, was making him shaky. It was clear that if Damali performed like this during a ripening, he\u0027d have to kill five guards and take out council. Shit. Get-high was everywhere, too. Nearly buzzed, Carlos tried to keep his focus on his only target. Damali. He\u0027d purposely surfaced deep enough in the crowd that she wouldn\u0027t be able to see him because of the angle of the lights. He was pretty sure that she wouldn\u0027t be able to sense him, either, if he could just be cool. Chill. Father Patrick was right. He was getting stronger. The old man was also right about another thing, too. The pull to power like this was hard to ignore. Almost as hard to ignore as Damali up there. The only thing he could hope was that she\u0027d be so engrossed in the performance that she\u0027d be too distracted to pick him up. The scents and vibrations were so intense all around him that, even as a master vampire, with superior tracking capability, he was having a hard time. She would, too. Then, she lifted her head and looked in his direction, again moving to the front of the stage. He let his breath out when she then walked to the other side of it. Yeah, for a moment she\u0027d detected something, but had done a smooth, theatrical recovery. But girlfriend was wearing that red dress and her voice was like a magnet. However, he was not about to get any closer. Wasn\u0027t advisable. Over here, the Covenant\u0027s prayer line wasn\u0027t a ground wire to keep him anchored. Over here, Damali\u0027s compound fortress wasn\u0027t a prayer beacon reminder. Over here, there was no distance between him and the call that was kicking his ass. He was going to have to eat soon. Ever since he\u0027d embarrassed himself and had flipped out on her in the woods, he was not going near her. Not like that. Definitely not in front of his squad. He had to conquer that shit, first. The smell of perspiration-soaked concertgoers perfumed the air and was almost asking too much of his restraint. With that strong vibe coming from the crowd, plus watching Damali holler up onstage, anything could jump off. He just hoped his exterminators could be cool. He sensed for them. They were. Odd. It was as though their transmissions were blocked. Council? Something wasn\u0027t right. He then looked back at the stage. Damn, one woman creating all this havoc. That\u0027s right, he had to remember that he was angry with her, too. She\u0027d had some other man all up in her face. Not that he could necessarily blame the brother. However, it was a matter of principle. Carlos glanced around the audience which was in a state of near hysteria. On the other hand, what was he going to do, off fifty thousand, who all had the same thing running through their minds even while their women and other females swayed to the music beside them? Crazy. He just would not look at the stage, is all. He could hang. But the whiff of Neteru she was sending his way was murder. Yet, it didn\u0027t make sense. Damali wasn\u0027t ripening, wasn\u0027t due for seven more years. He fought it at first, but then gave in to a deep inhale. The sensation of her scent filled his nostrils, coating his tongue, his throat, and slid down his insides like some sweet, forbidden fruit. He ran his hand over his jaw and ran his tongue over his teeth, holding himself in check. Damali never smelled that thick, that dark, that positively... A female hand traced up his back and touched his shoulder. Startled, he turned abruptly and looked into a pair of dark brown eyes that nickered green. The beauty standing before him was almost his height, and her well-toned arm had the muscular structure of a female bodybuilder. Her skin was flawless, like highly polished mahogany, and her hair was in a hundred jet-black braids that hung down her back. La vampira, if he\u0027d ever seen one. She smiled a half smile of recognition, showing a little fang. Carlos\u0027s eyes traveled down her stacked body. All she had on was a crocheted black bra, her coffee-bean-brown, hard nipples peeking at him through sections of it. A sheer black sarong, and what appeared to be a thong under that, covered her from the waist down. He could feel her entering his thoughts, dredging current vocabulary from it. Okay, cool, she was a foreign vamp chick. If she needed vocab to communicate with him, with a body like hers, no problem - even though he didn\u0027t generally deal with other females, being hooked up with Damali and all. Then again, there was something a little primal about her, if not were-demon. It was in the green flicker in her eyes and in the shape of her jaw, which was slightly wider at the chin where lower incisors would be. Always a dead giveaway. But her top incisors were awesome. Vamp all the way. He studied her ears, which came to a very subtle point and laid back against her skull. If he didn\u0027t know better... But he wasn\u0027t registering anything demon, and his squad hadn\u0027t bristled. Nah, she wasn\u0027t a were. What she was, was fine as shit. If she had a thing for the were-shapes, that was cool. The old vamps had to stop being so prejudiced. Needed to embrace a few personal choice differences. Not all were-demon forms were disgusting, especially packaged in a vamp body like that. Conflicted, he hesitated. What was he saying? Was he on crack, or some shit? Vampires didn\u0027t deal with demons, were-demons, or any other variety. Yet she smelled so fucking good - no demon tracer at all. She smiled and he struggled to remember that... he already had a woman... the one onstage that had called him up from Hell. So who was this one who was all up in his grille? Despite his resolve to distance himself from possible trouble, he took his time to enjoy the stranger\u0027s ample, firm, melon shaped breasts, and the way her tight waist sported a gold hoop in her sunken navel. Right under it was a silky trail of fiat, wispy black hair that dipped under her low-slung sarong. His mouth went dry. The knot in the side of the skirt\u0027s fabric exposed a well-curved, well-toned hip. She opened her thigh a bit, and he noted that her equally toned perfect legs were longer than his. Dayumm, she was fine. He studied her face, admiring how her feline, almond-shaped eyes blazed over high, chiseled cheekbones, and her jaw was squared to a strong chin. She arched an eyebrow, and an electric current passed through him, just imagining the bite she could probably deliver. \"Is it later, yet?\" she asked in a seductive tone that he could hear despite the ear-splitting decibels of the music. He\u0027d watched her lush mouth work with the words, and saw the glistening gold ball that pierced her tongue. Damn, it was her - the voice that had been in his head, cracking his skull for over a month. Her hand went to his chest. He now had his back completely to the stage. Her palm burned him, sending a scorching heat down his abdomen toward his groin. Face to face, this was definitely some strong vibe. Wasn\u0027t shit here to block it. Calling upon his last reserves of discipline, he grabbed her wrist. \"Do I know you?\" He\u0027d meant the question to come out with more threat in it, but damn, just look at her. \"Do you have to know me?\" Okay. A player. He could dig it, but now was not the time, if ever. \"Need to know a little somethin\u0027, somethin\u0027. I don\u0027t just roll like that.\" \"Oh...\" she clucked her tongue, coming in closer, and making the ball on it bounce. \"I thought your kind was notorious for being down for whatever. Certainly not monogamous.\" The statement backed him up. His mind had to adjust. He could hear Damali behind him, crooning her song... but he was single, after all. And she had had some guy up in her face. He had never been monogamous in his life, or accused of such slander. This fine woman had just challenged him and called him a punk - knowing he was a master vamp. Was she mad? She laughed. \"My bad,\" she whispered, her other hand dipping low, stroking the part of him that was rock hard. \"What are you?\" he asked, allowing her to touch him for a moment. Then he collected himself enough to halt her stroking. He used his energy to push a small opening in the heaving crowd so he could claim some space and get his head together. She stepped in closer, and the scent of her was disorienting. Carlos shook his head to clear it. He glanced briefly over his shoulder at the stage. He was smelling Neteru everywhere, and it was making him high. In fact, he was tripping so badly at the moment that he swore he\u0027d caught a whiff of fully ripened Neteru again. \"I\u0027m something you\u0027ve needed for a long time,\" she murmured. \"And much better than what\u0027s up there begging for you with no pride... us older women don\u0027t go there.\" She backed up, cocked her head and smiled wider. \"Have fun with the little girl for now, but let me know in a couple of nights - or I\u0027ll find you again. Don\u0027t make me have to look for you. That won\u0027t be pleasant.\" \"Hold up,\" Carlos said, starting to get pissed off. Nobody told him some shit like that and then walked, fine or not. Plus, he didn\u0027t like the disrespect toward Damali. She needed to check herself. \"If I\u0027m interested, I\u0027ll let you know.\" \"Whatever,\" she said coolly. \"But when you\u0027re done with the young girl, come find a real woman.\" She sauntered back over to him. \"The double plunge I\u0027ve got will knock your head back.\" Her voice dropped an octave and her scent thickened around him. \"Remember, baby, she can\u0027t even bear fangs.\" She licked his throat before he could stop her, and was gone. Stunned, he stood there for a moment just looking at where she\u0027d been. This was no ordinary vamp, or average lower-level vapor move. This was some smooth, almost master vampire level shit... But she smelled like Neteru? Ripe Neteru - that had drugged him out of his mind for a few seconds... Enough to make him turn his attention away from Damali? Oh, hell no. This was real crazy. Female master vamp? At council-level strength... was there such a thing? No. Wasn\u0027t a female vamp at that rank, yet - no record of anything like that in the territories, especially not in his. Nuit would have never made one, and he damned sure wouldn\u0027t have with Damali near. Council wouldn\u0027t make one either, knowing a female Neteru was on the planet. Why, so a master female vamp could off their daywalker vessel? Would never happen. Carlos glanced at the stage. It had to be a second-level vamp. But how in the hell did she get that strong? Now the shit was really bothering him, because the truth was, she could have telepathically given him a run for his money. Might have taken him, simply because he\u0027d underestimated her as a basic territory female. He stood there for a moment, becoming outraged. Then he was through - totally outdone. He could not believe that arrogant, fine-assed vamp! Part of him was enraged because the lick had indeed knocked his head back, and left him wobbling, in public, in the middle of a concert stadium. The other half of him was angry with himself for not just brushing her off from the get-go... but there was something so slayer about her that it messed him up. But that was impossible. And it pissed him off to no end that she\u0027d made him crave what could never happen... a double plunge with Damali. Carlos tried to shake the image that had replayed itself in his brain too many times. He closed his eyes to try to ward off the sensation, but that only made matters worse. He could almost feel it rock him where he stood. A hot body beneath him, torched with near-climax fever, Neteru in his nose, a beautiful pair of glistening fangs plunging his throat at the same time his scored hers... right at the moment of truth... a high-velocity rush of blood exchange sending recycled pleasure through both of them at once; two parallel, excruciating pleasure lines burning up atmosphere, dissolving matter till those sensations crossed and atomically fused in one central explosion - the vanishing point. He opened his eyes, mad at himself, mad at the world, angry that he even thought about it, much less fantasized about it. Impossible. He could only take Damali there after she turned... What? Uh, uh. Now he was really mad, because he was definitely tripping. She could never turn, and not just because she was council\u0027s vessel. It wasn\u0027t even about that - not with her. And, fuck it, he had more willpower than that. So what if a vamp female could go there; he was committed. That\u0027s right. He was committed, he reminded himself repeatedly as he regulated his breathing. So what that he\u0027d seen that shit when he sat in a throne seat. Yeah, the thrones had good video, all the knowledge of the line. But he could hang. Just keep that as an intellectual experience. He didn\u0027t have to go there and step out on D. He could wait seventy or eighty years till his baby passed away to try it. A shudder rippled through him as the image faded away. Shit, what was he going to do? Live almost a century as a master being a virgin to that experience? Yeah, he could hang, he told himself again firmly. Besides, he\u0027d die in seven if he went with the priests\u0027 deal. Carlos tried to make himself laugh it off. Death in seven would be a release from this temptation bullshit, not just his soul\u0027s salvation. Maybe in seven, just before Damali ripened, he\u0027d go get a good run out, and give the clerics his head on a silver platter. That way, she wouldn\u0027t know, he could get his soul back, and could take his little transgression to the grave. They said if a man repented, all would be forgiven, right? He looked toward the direction where the female vamp had vanished. He didn\u0027t even catch her name. If he found the fine female, and was really sorry after... He laughed. Oh, shit. He didn\u0027t want to think about any of it. But it was really getting on his nerves to have to deal with it. Damn choices! He didn\u0027t need variables like that in his life. His annoyance turned itself to Damali. This was all her fault. If she had chilled, let him stay in LA, had kept her ass in the States, hadn\u0027t started a buncha shit with some guy over here. If she hadn\u0027t done this freaking concert! What\u0027s more, if she hadn\u0027t called him like that. By what right did she have to put their personal business in the streets, huh? He could feel himself getting whipped into a total tirade as she went down on her knees on the stage and the audience hit a new level of frenzy. Carlos closed his eyes. She was too passionate. She was working on the wrong side of his brain. She was messing with his control factor. The crowd was too hyped. He had ripe Neteru in his system, musta been a contact high from the stage. He could feel his gums ripping he wanted her so much. Unable to stop himself, he turned and looked at her. He shoved his hands in his pockets to keep from seeing them tremble. Man... when he got backstage, he was gonna tell her ass off! Champagne bottles spilled their foam essence across the floor as Rider sloshed it, taking a laughing swig from one in each hand. The sound of all the corks going off was like the pop-pop of gunfire. Big Mike and Shabazz leveraged their weight against the door, closing off a hundred flashbulbs. The media had been shut out. Damali and Marlene slapped high fives, and Dan poured overflowing paper cups of semi-warm champagne for the group. Jose was rubbing JL\u0027s head and laughing, while JL play-boxed him within the stadium locker room. \"Did we take Brazil, people, or what?\" Rider opened his arms wide and jumped up on a locker bench. \"We rocked da house, man!\" Big Mike yelled, snatching a bottle from Rider. \"Y\u0027all worked it,\" Damali said laughing. \"No, li\u0027l sis, you wurked it. Daaaaayum,\" Shabazz said, getting a swig of Big Mike\u0027s bottle. \"No lie, D,\" Jose said, pounding Shabazz\u0027s fist. \"Baby girl owned the stadium!\" \"Right,\" Dan was yelling from his position by the lockers. \"I can\u0027t wait to see the ink on this tomorrow. The media hype is gonna be crazy.\" \"Mad-crazy,\" Marlene agreed. Damali watched them all, and laughed, but felt like a spectator as well. From a remote part of her mind, pure defeat claimed her. Marlene picked up on the vibe, but kept her smile bright, easing toward Damali. \"We were ridiculous, gang,\" Damali repeated, trying to convince herself. But as the words came out of her mouth, the group went still. Swirling energy made papers fly, cups turn over, instruments fall, and a couple of bulbs in the makeup mirror blow. It was like a giant storm had been unleashed in the locker-dressing room, and it took a few seconds for her team to mentally switch gears and try to scramble to assemble weapons. Black smoke rose from the floor, and in the center of it Carlos appeared. He didn\u0027t even take a breath as he began to pace. \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s fucking ridiculous, Damali, is to ever see my woman perform some, some - I don\u0027t know what you call it, but it reached Hell and back!\" The entire team stared at him, mouths agape. \"Yo, Carlos, uh - \" \"Shut up, Rider! This is between me and her!\" Damali\u0027s hand found her hip. She looked him up and down. Had the nerve to be coming in here all fly, wearing a damned black linen Versace suit, serving a damned cranberry collarless raw silk shirt like he was out where he shouldn\u0027t have been... oh, she\u0027d kick his ass... \"Where have you been? Let\u0027s start there.\" Carlos slapped the center of his chest, bearing full fangs, and walking in a wider circle. \"Where have I been? Where have I been!\" \"Is there an echo in the room? I said - \" \"Where have you been? Huh? A couple of weeks, and I\u0027m in my lair tasting the sweat of some other man after you\u0027ve been off doing the Lambada! Are you insane? While I\u0027m on parole, and shit - trying to stay away from a body count over here!\" A locker took the brunt of the blow, caving in as Carlos punched it while stalking past it. Black smoke still hung in the air, and Damali\u0027s eyes widened. Oh, shit. Not good. But she wasn\u0027t hearing no yang. \"Where were you, then, so that I didn\u0027t have to call you like that?\" He walked away from her. The team started backing up, mumbling and looking for a quick exit. This was between her and Carlos. Marlene crossed her arms and folded them over her chest with a smirk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he could be angry if he wanted to, but she wanted a response. Mar had told her to send a shock wave subterranean, and it got his attention. Good. \"I was worried sick about you, and you just vanished into the night. What was I supposed to do? Just sit back and - \" \"You were supposed to respect what I told you, woman.\" \"What?\" Both hands found her hips. \"I don\u0027t know who you think you\u0027re talking to but - \" \"I missed you so much that it didn\u0027t make sense. I had to go find my old lair in Beverly Hills to chill out, or the old guys in the cabin would have been toast! Shit, Damali, your ass is so stubborn!\" He paced away from her and the team\u0027s heads pivoted from Damali back to Carlos as though watching a tennis match. Marlene didn\u0027t help matters by grunting and nodding in agreement with her. Oh, so her mom was on her side, too. Women! Damali let her breath out hard. \"All right, Carlos. My bad.\" \"Damn straight, your bad. Do you know I had to bring international messengers with me - five, burly, WWF-looking, second-generation, exterminator vamps from outlying neutral territories to make it through the tunnels?\" Damali covered her mouth. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said pointing toward the door. \"Five sonsabitches I have to keep on a short leash while I\u0027m over here, lest we have a topside international incident! And I\u0027m not all that stable myself... all \u0027cause I missed you so bad.\" He stood there in front of her, taking in deep gulps of air, too ashamed by the admission, especially in front of the other men. He gave Rider a glare that warned him about the peril of his throat if a sarcastic comment came up from it. Big Mike was cool enough to look away, and Shabazz could dig it. The man started packing gear like nothing had happened. Jose started picking up cups from the floor with Dan, and JL just sat there in shock. Whatever. \"I\u0027m going to go eat, and then I\u0027m gonna crash, and then I\u0027m going back to LA. I just came to be sure you were all right. Apparently you are, so I\u0027m out.\" He turned to leave, but could feel Damali walk up behind him. Her hand touched his shoulder, and the tremor it sent through him was just as she\u0027d said, ridiculous. But he felt her stiffen, and it made him look at her. \"Where have you been?\" she asked, backing away from him. The team went still. Shabazz discreetly found his gun and nodded at Big Mike. Carlos began backing up. All rage wilted. \"Baby, I was, right here, at the concert. You felt me, right?\" His hands were out in front of him, but he glanced at the guys who were shaking their heads. All the brothers knew this stance. Marlene had folded her arms over her chest. \"You were at this concert, saw me on my knees in front of a crowd of a hundred thousand, and you ignored me?\" Damali\u0027s comment had begun at a low, threatening timbre, issued from behind her teeth and rose to a full holler as she finished the sentence. \"No, no, I wasn\u0027t ignoring you,\" Carlos said fast. \"I was trying to chill. I was trying to - \" \"Push up on a demon! You\u0027re trailing sulfur! And it\u0027s female!\" Damali\u0027s eyes narrowed as she turned on her heel and started grabbing up costumes, flinging her headpiece and then kicking a chair out of her way. \"She wasn\u0027t a demon, D. You know I don\u0027t roll like that. She was a second-generation vamp... just part of the territory females. Baby, for real - \" \"Aw, man...\" Big Mike murmured. \"Brother...\" \"Least you could have taken a shower first,\" Rider mumbled. \"Young, dumb, and fulla - \" \"It wasn\u0027t all that,\" Carlos argued, his glance going between the guardians and Damali. This was bullshit. He had to talk to her and her big brothers? He tried to get near her now that they\u0027d lowered weapons, but she shrugged his hand off of her shoulder and spun on him. \"Don\u0027t you touch me! Don\u0027t even think about it. How could you?\" She turned away and held her arms around herself. \"All I did was go out dancing, but you - \" \"I didn\u0027t. I swear, girl,\" he said in a gentle voice. You thought about it real hard though, Damali thought, her anger building. \"Wait!\" Marlene walked forward, between Damali and Carlos, and the team gathered around. \"Carlos,\" Marlene said in a steady voice. \"What did this she-demon look like, and where was she when you saw her?\" He shrugged, and didn\u0027t feel like talking about this in front of the team. \"I keep telling y\u0027all, she was a vamp - and it wasn\u0027t what you think.\" He didn\u0027t have to answer to anybody there, not even Damali. Besides, they had it all twisted. She wasn\u0027t a demon. He started walking away. He and the exterminators could just go eat, and then jet back to the States before daybreak. \"Carlos,\" Marlene repeated in a firm voice. \"Neteru is the only thing that would have gotten you so buzzed and Damali isn\u0027t in cycle. We need a description, so we can deal with it.\" He looked at Marlene as Damali went to stand by her side. \"Men are so stupid,\" Damali whispered and shook her head. She turned away. \"What did she look like?\" Carlos kept his eyes on Marlene, intermittently glancing over to Damali\u0027s back. How did one describe this other woman in front of his own woman and her family, to the degree that he needed to? What, he was supposed to just tell all in front of guardian brothers and a seer who wasn\u0027t having it? The point was moot, anyway. This was just a very fine vamp that had gotten him in a very sticky situation. But the situation called for diplomacy, because he certainly didn\u0027t want Damali to bug any more than she was already. She was hurt, and all he wanted to do was privately apologize. Hurting her had never been his intention. But, they had a point. Girlfriend had showed up at the concert. And he wondered how she\u0027d gotten past the lights and prayers. If this devious, jealous female vamp was stalking Damali and the team, they had a right to know. \"She\u0027s tall,\" Carlos said slowly. \"Near my height.\" Damali didn\u0027t turn around and he was glad she didn\u0027t, or she would have seen the guys issue appreciative glances toward each other. He could feel Damali attempting to pry his mind open, but on this one, it was black box, need-to-know basis only. He wasn\u0027t budging. \"Dark brown, green eyes - flicker yellow... yeah, they glow,\" he said, answering the unspoken group question. \"Built,\" he added casually. \"You know... uh, athletic. Long, black hair in braids down her back, high cheekbones. Aw\u0027ight-looking woman,\" he added to minimize the sting. Big Mike silently made brick-house proportions discreetly for Carlos who just nodded. Big Mike nodded. A silent understanding passed between them. Carlos closed his eyes. He and Mike shared the same taste in women. But this was humiliating. \"What else?\" Mar said with a tone of disgust. \"Uh, she was wearing black. One of those bra things, and a sheer skirt - thong under it. Pierced navel, gold hoop.\" Damali turned around. \"You got close enough to see her navel, did you?\" Carlos swallowed as she slowly walked up to him. \"So where did you meet her, huh? I think it\u0027s really interesting how you couldn\u0027t even give me the courtesy of a call back but then show up in a big puff of smoke, outraged that I\u0027ve been dancing with another man. Well, you need to check that and tell us what we need to know about this female.\" He stared at her, seeing that heat in her eyes, and felt joy bloom inside him. The fact that she was so outraged, cared so much that he might have potentially been with somebody else, had actually claimed him as her one and only, did something to him. It was like he was watching her mouth move, but that\u0027s all he could focus on. The shape of it, the blaze in her eyes. The way her head went from side to side as her finger wagged with her complaint, one hand on her hip in the to-die-for dress. He smiled. Damali\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"This shit ain\u0027t funny, Carlos! Answer the question!\" \"Which one?\" He was not being smart. For the life of him he couldn\u0027t remember what they were arguing about. He had a villa in the hills, fully stocked bar, Jacuzzi, all baby had to do was chill... \"Which one?\" He was just coming out of the trance when lightning struck his face and dazed him. She was standing there, breathing hard, about to cry. The team held their breaths. She\u0027d slapped the taste out of his mouth. He didn\u0027t know what possessed him, but his hands went to the sides of her face, and he pulled her in close. His head tilted, and he kissed her as hard as he needed to. Right there, no pretense. No shame. Just like she\u0027d crooned for him in front of an audience. Whatever. They were wasting time. He let her go and she covered her heart with her hand for a moment. \"I wasn\u0027t with her like that. Can\u0027t you tell? She was tracking down sloppy seconds from the jones I had for you. She rolled up on me, not the other way around. She made an offer; I refused. Period. Drop it. Now you wanna get out of here, or what?\" \"Carlos, listen,\" Marlene said fast. \"Both of you listen - just for once. There\u0027s another entity out there that\u0027s possibly stronger than either one of you right now, and she\u0027s twisted. From what I can gather, she was at this concert site.\" \"Marlene, you\u0027re bugging. That female is fronting like she\u0027s a master vamp wannabe - and ain\u0027t hardly stronger than me. Damali can take her, too - \" \"Not if she\u0027s been able to co-opt and reproduce the one thing that you have practically no immunity to. The scent.\" Carlos glanced away from Marlene\u0027s probing eyes. \"They only make one real Neteru every millennium, remember? Damali\u0027s it,\" Carlos said in a low timbre, staring at Damali who looked at him like he was dinner. \"I can handle that situation. That\u0027s why I came up here with a squad. If Damali wants to go with me, I\u0027ll have her at the hotel before sunrise. Y\u0027all just watch your backs. Second-level females are generally spiteful and have a bad temper when they don\u0027t get their way - girlfriend didn\u0027t get nothing, so she might have a case of the ass... real attitude.\" The look Damali issued him was so intense, so desire-filled, yet so torn, that it made him go still. He could feel it through his skin the way she wanted to be with him. Something had definitely kicked up a notch. He wasn\u0027t sure if it was the song, seeing Damali openly, without shame, give him her all, or what, but Marlene\u0027s worries about some lower-level female that was supposed to have cornered some Neteru scent was bouncing off his eardrums and falling on the floor right about through here. \"Am I hearing you right, Rivera?\" Rider asked slowly, quietly, no play in his tone. \"You\u0027ve got a team of five vampires on steroids, just up from Hell, supposedly going to watch our backs?\" Rider walked toward him, suddenly grabbed his arm, and looked him in the eyes. \"Are you fucking nuts?\" Carlos just looked at Rider\u0027s hand until he removed it. \"They\u0027re my squad. They follow my orders. I told \u0027em no eating in town, and not to touch a hair on your heads. Even the priests are under the safety mark. My order.\" \"You hear yourself, man?\" Shabazz stepped in near Rider. \"You\u0027re high. You ain\u0027t making sense. Never in history has a guardian or a Covenant team gotten a mark of safety from the vampire nations.\" \"Never in history has a Neteru placed a call down to Hell, made the courier bats lose orbit in the Vampire Council\u0027s supreme chamber, or sent bass-line at a concert down to disturb our transport systems.\" His gaze was on Damali as he spoke to Shabazz, and he loved the fact that she\u0027d smiled. \"You walk a bad bass, brother. They heard it... just like they heard my baby wailing up here... messed the old boys up - slayed \u0027em. Just like she\u0027s killing me, right now. I\u0027ll bring her home before tomorrow morning. My word.\" \"Isn\u0027t there a soul in here concerned about the fact that we\u0027re dealing with an entity that is mirroring the most potent aspect of the Neteru defense system?\" Marlene threw up her hands and began walking around the room. \"Is it me, people?\" \"She can\u0027t front Neteru,\" Carlos argued, still focused on Damali. \"If female vamps could do that, they\u0027d all conjure it. Besides, even if I wasn\u0027t hooked up with D, I wouldn\u0027t roll with girlfriend. She\u0027s got a freaky side, likes to live on the edge of danger - saw her hanging down in the badlands on level five in Hell... probably transformed into something and cast the illusion that she was in heat to keep \u0027em from killing her... mighta even done the unthinkable and got with a couple were-wolves or were-jags, who knows? The chick is nuts. That\u0027s where the sulfur probably came from. But if council catches her ass doing black-blood exchanges, shit. That ain\u0027t my problem. Her choice. If she did, though, and she\u0027s in my zones, I\u0027ll have to dust her myself.\" He glanced at the men on the team. \"Some shit is just unnatural, and at council level, a black-blood exchange with were-demons is a capital offense. Feel me?\" \"You met her down there?\" Damali was twirling the end of a lock around her finger, and looking at the floor when she spoke. \"Yeah. Wasn\u0027t no thing,\" Carlos said, moving closer to her. Damali\u0027s quiet tone and the sad look in her eyes had stopped the other guardians from asking more, and he was glad it did. He didn\u0027t want to talk to them; he wanted to talk to her. Privately. They needed to nip this argument in the bud, and squash it. But he knew he had to tell her something that would make her willing to go with him, and definitely needed to tell her people something so they wouldn\u0027t talk her out of it. Complex. \"Baby, I was checking out the levels,\" he said calmly, trying to sound rational as he explained. \"I was doing some undercover work, trying to see if there was any link between the deaths in the news, and anything down sub, but she pushed up on me on level five. I declined. Came here to be sure my baby was safe. She must have tracked me here and tried me in the crowd; I blew her off. End of story. That\u0027s it. My boys can handle a vamp female, if she\u0027s that stupid to go after a guardian team... and after I brushed her off, I don\u0027t think she is. Only Neteru I got in my nose is you, baby.\" \"Oh, Lord have mercy,\" Marlene sighed, plopping down on a bench in defeat. \"Gentlemen, get your weapons. Hopefully that\u0027s all it is... Carlos would know. He\u0027s the only one that can truly detect actual Neteru presence - and if the man swears that this is just a general female vamp, we have to go with it. For now.\" Marlene looked at him hard. \"But if you are wrong, and you put Damali in harm\u0027s way, a possible were-jaguar demon is the last thing you\u0027ll have to worry about. In fact, the Vampire Council will have to send up a rescue-and-recovery team to find the body parts I will separate from you, understood, Carlos?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. And if she\u0027s not still angry at me,\" Carlos said with a sheepish grin, \"I\u0027ll have Damali back at the hotel before it gets light.\" He looked at Damali who had a wide grin on her face. \"You mad at me?\" She shook her head no. \"You miss me?\" She nodded. \"You heard me all the way down there?\" He nodded. \"You miss me?\" He smiled. Before she could say another word, he sent a burst of energy from within him. The air in the room swept lightweight objects into a tornado swirl, Damali was in his arms, and they were gone. She landed on her feet still pressed against Carlos\u0027s chest. She stared at him, backed away a bit, and gaped at the environment. \"You\u0027re stronger. I can feel a different kind of energy running through you. It\u0027s darker, Carlos... and I\u0027m worried.\" He nodded. \"There\u0027s a lot of stuff I can do now, baby, that\u0027s gonna rock your world. You have no idea. I\u0027m just coming into my own.\" She glanced around the outrageously decadent villa he\u0027d brought her to. The tone of his voice made her wary. Things were fine before. She wasn\u0027t sure she liked this new aspect of him. \"How far away from the stadium are we?\" This move, while romantic, was seriously disconcerting. He was definitely stronger, she kept repeating in her mind like a mantra. There was no safe house with prayer lines nearby. Her Isis blade was at the stadium. Things were going down in a foreign land, and she was separated from her team, her family. This man seemed a little close to the edge. He looked at her differently than he had before, way carnal. Way more passion in the vibration. Dark passion. \"About eight miles away,\" he murmured, \"in the hillside of Jardim Botanico. Driving, it\u0027s farther, because of the roads... but we\u0027re not that far from the hotel the way I can get you there.\" He stalked toward her, watched her back up, looking hunted. He loved it. She was playing with his mind. She had no idea. If she had been ripening on him, she would have gotten pregnant tonight. Period. There was no decision. \"Uh, wow. Eight miles, huh? You couldn\u0027t project four between the safe house cabin and the compound not so long ago. Then, you were able to manifest objects like a car, and transform rooms. Seems like each night, you get more and more power, especially after you go subterranean.\" She was talking fast and walking around the room, glancing at furnishings, but not losing sight of his proximity to her. \"This is so cool, beautiful breeze, the bed, the moon, candles, tile floors. This stuff looks permanent, not like the illusions you cast in the cleric\u0027s place. Grates must come down at dawn, huh, to cover the deck and windows? Like the fireplace,\" she said dodging to a fireplace poker. \"Maybe we could start it?\" He snapped. The fireplace lit. He didn\u0027t say a word. She didn\u0027t put down the poker. \"Tell me about this chick.\" He shook his head no. \"I don\u0027t want to even think about that right now.\" His eyes flickered then went solid red, and she walked further out of his reach, holding the poker as she passed gorgeous marble furnishing with slate tables, wrought-iron chairs with sumptuous velvet seats, and hopped over the inland stream that ended in the far corner of the room into a waterfall and sunken Jacuzzi. She was not so much interested in this potential female vamp threat, as she was monitoring the change going on with him. Carlos seemed darker, less himself, and definitely more dangerous. There were even more black spots in his mind that were sealed, old places she\u0027d never been locked out of before. What was that about? And while she could actually feel his hands on her, sending excruciating pleasure through her, a part of her was on guard, yet she didn\u0027t know why. Plus he\u0027d lied to her by omission and had tried to block her second sight to what was going on here. Maybe it was the way his eyes hunted her? He\u0027d looked at her like that before in the woods that night. Yet, this was different. It made her uncomfortable. There was something about it that made her know he might just go all the way on her and flip this time. \"Are you hungry?\" he murmured, his eyes half closed, his nostrils flaring ever so slightly as she walked around the edges of the room. \"You need dinner... something to drink?\" She was gonna need all her strength tonight. No doubt. And if she lived till morning from what he was going to lay on her, then she\u0027d definitely needed to eat... especially when he woke up - hungry. She stalled. \"Yeah. I\u0027m starved.\" He didn\u0027t immediately answer her. \"Yeah. So am I.\" His voice was even. His tone lethal. His shaft was so hard it was sending spasms through his groin that she could feel across the room. \"Then maybe you should make a run, you know. I mean, before, we had the monks, the refrigerators, everything was - \" \"Cool.\" \"Yeah. Everything was real cool.\" He nodded. He tried to collect himself. This was Damali. He had to remember that. He loved her. \"Before I go make a run, what do you feel like eating?\" She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. They use a lot of red meat here - \" She stopped midsentence. \"It\u0027s hard to get vegetarian stuff here, is what I\u0027m saying.\" \"I know.\" He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply. \"Tell me the dish, and I\u0027ll make it so.\" Why was she baiting him? \"Better yet,\" she said fast, monitoring his intensity, \"you go eat, and after you\u0027re cool, I might have made up my mind.\" \"Good idea.\" His statement was issued from his throat, and in a blink he was air and gone. Damali\u0027s shoulders dropped two inches. Her hands were shaking. What was that shit? He\u0027d looked at her like he\u0027d turn her into a vamp - just outright flat-line her. She walked back and forth within the cliff lair. No way down, no way out, no roads for miles, only option was to try to climb a cliff at night in a red concert dress and heels? It was like an eagle\u0027s nest! This was insane. She should have never called him to Brazil. She shouldn\u0027t have called him here like that. There was too much stimulation. He was high... Oh Lord. She neared the edge of the bed. How long could they keep this mess going on, anyway? Vampires were renowned for their constant need for sex - seduction was their middle name. Plus, if he was getting stronger, pretty soon, docile deer in the States, or picking off a cow from a rancher from time to time was not going to work. The monks\u0027 blood wasn\u0027t working, obviously. Boss hadn\u0027t even come with a supply, and was freelancing, in Rio? Seven years of this? What was she talking about, seven years? There was no guarantee that she\u0027d make it, he\u0027d make it, or what would happen after that. Homeboy might turn to dust, for all she knew. Not even the old Templar knew. This crap had never been done before. The entire inside of her skull was splitting. She finally sat down on the edge of the huge futon bed that had an indoor, pristine stream running around it. She gazed at it with both awe and profound grief. It was decadently set so that one could easily roll right off of the mattress into the turquoise pool that was as wide as the bed. If they wanted to, they could make love all the way toward the waterfall in the room, slip over that and land in a hot tub. She had to hand it to the vamps; when it came to pleasure, they went all out. Marlene had tried to warn her before she and Carlos ever took that first plunge. Their eyes glowed red because it was the primal center of the chakra system covering the reproductive organs... just like the gold tone ruled the stomach and gall center. Red for passion and anger, deep gold for hunger and indignation. Lighter gold as you moved up the torso. Green ruled the heart - either love or the green-eyed monsters, which were jealous-hearted creatures. The demon realms didn\u0027t produce eye colors that went above the middle chakra, the heart chakra, where the spiritual side of the soul took over. Mar said it, said it, said it. She wished she had Madame Isis, and could see the jewels in the handle of her blade. Oh, man, Carlos hadn\u0027t nickered gold tonight. Brother went pure red. She peered down at her dress - and she\u0027d called him from the Vampire Council table, to Rio, of all freaking places in the world, in a red dress? Damali just shook her head. Got him to the point were he went there to get an escort? Didn\u0027t trust himself around the Covenant that saved him. Had studied Shabazz and Big Mike for a minute in the locker room, already having tasted their blood? Was she crazy? These creatures were truly organized, too. International transport? Borrowed lairs like freakin\u0027 timeshares? Armed couriers? Probably stocked fridge - but Carlos didn\u0027t want what was in it. Needed a hit of adrenaline. What was he going to do, stampede a herd of buffalo out there or something? Crazy. Suddenly she wanted to cry.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunted-vampire-huntress-legend-3/page-16.html","bookId":2527,"book":{"id":2527,"title":"The Hunted (Vampire Huntress Legend #3)","description":"Storyline: The Hunted (Vampire Huntress Legend #3) Each millennium brings a new Neteru, a vampire huntress whose mission is to vanquish evil from the world.
