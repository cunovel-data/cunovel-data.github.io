This millennium\u0027s savior has come in the form of Damali Richards, a hip-hop diva with the heart of a warrior and an attitude to match.

Several gruesome deaths, starting with an American research team, have come to Damali\u0027s attention in Brazil. The nature of the deaths leads Damali to believe that the killer is anything but human... \n Unknown to Damali, the life of Master Vampire Carlos Rivera was saved by a most unlikely group: a band of monks also dedicated to fighting the Dark Realm. In exchange, they want Carlos to help stop the inhuman murders plaguing Brazil-and they will use Damali as bait if they have to. Reunited, Damali and Carlos give in to the erotic passion they have fought for so long. Together, they are a powerful force. But Damali has made a terrifying enemy who won\u0027t rest until the beautiful Neteru is dead...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-hunted-vampire-huntress-legend-3.jpg","author":"L.A.
