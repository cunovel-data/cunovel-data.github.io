{"id":93409,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Chiavari was waiting for Ramsey on the front porch. \"Come in,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t take this anymore,\" Ramsey said. \"I want you to end it, now.\" \"We\u0027ve already had this discussion,\" Chiavari said curtly. \"Look at me!\" Ramsey removed his hat and glasses, rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. \"Damn it, look!\" \"What the hell happened to you?\" \"What do you think?\" \"Spend a little too much time in the sun, did you?\" Ramsey swore. \"I tried to kill myself. I want out of this life. I will not live like this! I have become what I hated, what I hunted. It has to stop. Now!\" \"Six months, Ramsey. That\u0027s all. To a man with eternity before him, six months should not be too difficult.\" \"You don\u0027t understand! You wanted to be a vampire. I don\u0027t! I hate what they are. I hate what I have become.\" He ran a hand through his hair, wincing as his fingers encountered burnt flesh. \"I found a woman. I kept her a prisoner in my house. Do you understand? I tied her up and I fed off of her like a damned leech. What kind of depraved monster does that?\" \"Come in and sit down, Ramsey,\" Chiavari said quietly. \"You are in pain. You are not thinking clearly.\" \"I don\u0027t want to...\" \"Come in the house. We can\u0027t talk out here.\" With a sigh of resignation, Ramsey followed Chiavari inside. Chiavari gestured at the sofa. \"Sit down.\" \"I don\u0027t need a lecture.\" \"I know what you need better than you do.\" Chiavari sat down beside Ramsey and extended his arm. \"Old blood is the best blood. Go on, take what you need.\" Ramsey met Chiavari\u0027s gaze and shook his head. \"No.\" \"Do it.\" Ramsey glanced around. \"Where\u0027s Marisa?\" \"She went to the theater with an old friend from work. You need not worry, she won\u0027t be home for hours. Drink, Ramsey.\" His voice was low, soothing, almost hypnotic. \"Drink.\" He wanted to refuse. There was a great intimacy in the sharing of blood between vampires. He did not want to accept Chiavari\u0027s blood again, did not want to be further in the man\u0027s debt, but his need was too great, the pain and the hunger beyond bearing, the promise of relief too tempting. With a low growl, he took hold of Chiavari\u0027s arm and sank his fangs into his wrist. And drank. And drank. Power flowed into him, sweeping through his body and limbs like a great healing flood, washing the pain away in a scarlet tide. He saw flashes of Chiavari\u0027s life... his childhood in Italy... his wife, Antoinette... his son and his daughter, who had been slain by Alexi Kristov. And, like a rapidly fast-forwarded videotape, glimpses and images of Chiavari\u0027s prey down through the centuries. And over all, the scent and the taste of the blood, reminding Ramsey of the night when Chiavari had needed blood to survive. Their roles had been reversed then. It had been Chiavari drinking voraciously. \"Enough!\" Chiavari\u0027s voice penetrated the red haze that surrounded him. \"Ramsey, enough.\" Sated with the vampire\u0027s ancient blood, the roaring hunger within him stilled and slept, the pain receded, a dim shadow of what it had been. Ramsey glanced at Chiavari and looked away. They had ever been enemies, yet this alliance, the blood bond they shared, was a bond as intimate as that of mortal lovers. A bond first formed as an uneasy alliance to hunt Kristov. Kristov, who had wooed Chiavari\u0027s wife behind his back; Kristov, who had slain Chiavari\u0027s children and changed Antoinette into a mindless creature caught between life and death, with no will of her own. In a brutal act of kindness, Ramsey had taken Antoinette\u0027s head and heart and put her tortured soul to rest, a deed that haunted him still. He looked at Chiavari again. \"Do you think she suffered?\" Chiavari did not have to ask who he was talking about. \"I don\u0027t know. I pray not. I owe you an eternal debt for...\" His voice broke. \"For releasing her. If, in six months, you still wish to be destroyed... I will repay that debt.\" Touched by the soul-deep pain in the vampire\u0027s voice, Ramsey laid a comforting hand on Chiavari\u0027s shoulder. Chiavari\u0027s surprise showed in his eyes. Realizing what he had done, Ramsey jerked his hand away. Chiavari smiled faintly before he raised his arm to his mouth and ran his tongue over the twin holes in his wrist. \"Can you think more clearly now?\" \"If you mean, have I changed my mind, the answer is no. But as you said, six months is only a moment in the life of a vampire.\" Ramsey stood abruptly. \"I\u0027ll be back in six months to collect on that debt.\" \"I will be here.\" Ramsey nodded curtly. \"I would rather you didn\u0027t tell Marisa about this.\" \"Are you still in love with her?\" Ramsey met Chiavari\u0027s unblinking gaze. \"I will always be in love with her. Good night.\u0027\u0027 He took a deep breath. \"And thank you.\" Leaving Chiavari\u0027s house, Ramsey stalked the dark streets of the city. He fancied he could feel the other vampire\u0027s blood flowing through his veins, mingling with his own. He could certainly feel the results. Strength flowed through him; the pain of his scorched flesh lessened with each passing moment. Had he not hated what he had become, he would have rejoiced in his power. The blood of three ancients flowed in his veins. But for that, the sunlight would have killed him instantly. Pity he had not thought of that sooner. He would not try such foolishness again. Somehow, he would endure the next six months, and then he would go back to Chiavari and demand that the vampire destroy him, as promised. And until then, what? He stopped and sniffed the air. Kelly had passed this way recently. He would know her scent, her heartbeat, anywhere. Following the Siren call of her blood, he crossed the street, his yearning for her carrying him swiftly across town. He paid no heed to his surroundings; the fact that he was now in a part of town considered dangerous by ordinary men did not register on him at all. Her scent drew him relentlessly until he found himself standing outside a seedy boardinghouse. He sensed the street punk before he saw him - smelled the metal of the knife in his hand, the drugs that clung to his clothing and clouded his mind. He turned to face him, his teeth drawn back in a feral snarl. The boy was no more than fourteen or fifteen. His eyes widened when he saw Ramsey\u0027s expression; his face paled when he realized he was no longer the hunter but the prey. He took a step backward, the knife falling from his hand, clattering on the sidewalk. \"No.\" The word whispered past his lips as the vampire\u0027s hand closed around his throat. Ramsey gazed into the boy\u0027s eyes. Sheer horror stared back at him. The stench of the boy\u0027s terror filled Ramsey\u0027s nostrils, stirred his hunger. A low growl rose in his throat; his fangs lengthened. \"No.\" A sob, a barely audible plea for mercy. With a cry of self-disgust, Ramsey thrust the boy away. The boy stumbled back, turned, and fled. Ramsey stared after him, appalled by what he had almost done, by the blood lust that had engulfed him. He had just fed. How could he hunger again so soon? Six months. How could he go on like this for six months? The breeze shifted, carrying the scent of earth and trees, the strong aroma of fried food, the stink of unwashed bodies. The breeze shifted again, teasing his nostrils with the scent of jasmine. The sound of applause drew his attention. \"Bravo!\" Turning, he saw Khira crossing the street toward him. She was beautiful, he thought, the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She wore a black cloak over a wine red gown. \"Is this how you pass your time?\" she asked with a throaty chuckle. \"Frightening little boys?\" \"I guess you would have killed him.\" She shrugged, a graceful movement of her slim shoulders. \"Perhaps. Certainly even you can see he would have been no great loss. When he gets over his fright, he will be on the hunt again. We vampyres can perform a useful service to society, you see, by preying on the predators.\" As was her habit, she linked her arm with his. \"Come, walk with me.\" Ramsey glanced over his shoulder. Kelly would have to wait. \"Slumming, are you?\" he asked. \"I was going to ask you the same question.\" She shuddered with mock horror. \"What brings you to this dreadful part of town?\" \"I was going to visit a... a friend.\" She looked at him, her blue eyes filled with laughter. \"You cannot lie to me, Edward.\" \"All right, I came to see a woman.\" \"The woman whose life you saved and nearly took. I see.\" She stopped walking. \"Do you wish to go back?\" He shook his head. Khira patted his arm and started walking again. \"So, man ami , how do you like being immortal?\" \"I hate it.\" She looked truly surprised. \"But why?\" She flung out her arms and twirled in a circle, her long gown swirling like flames around her ankles. \"It is so lovely to be immortal on a night such as this! Look around you, Edward. The world is yours for the taking.\" \"You mean the night is mine for the stalking.\" \"That, too,\" she replied, as if it were the most wonderful thing in the world. \"To be immortal is to be free!\" \"Is it? Do you never miss the light of day, the taste of food and drink, the love of a man? A home, children?\" He hesitated. \"The warmth of the sun on your skin?\" He had reveled in its touch for a moment, until pleasure turned to excruciating pain. She frowned at him. \"You wasted no time on those things when you were mortal. Why do you yearn for them now?\" The truth of her words slammed into him. He had never fully appreciated the world around him. He had eaten when he was hungry, slept when he could find the time. He had never noticed the beauty in a sunrise or a sunset. The rising sun meant only that the undead would go to ground; the sunset meant they would be abroad, hunting the night. He had lived out of his car, slept in motels, his only friends other hunters. As for women, he had loved only two. Ironic, he thought now, that the first had been killed by a vampire, and the second had married one. He hadn\u0027t had a home since he was sixteen, had never wanted a home or a wife or children, knowing they would only tie him down or become pawns in a dangerous game. His whole life, his whole reason for living, had been to destroy vampires. His thoughts turned back in time to his first successful hunt... \"Take him.\" Grandfather Ramsey handed Edward a sharpened stake made of ash, and a mallet made of oak. \"One quick blow.\" Edward took the stake from the old man\u0027s hand and placed it over the vampire\u0027s heart, lifted the mallet, and drove the stake into the sleeping vampire\u0027s chest. For all their powers and physical strength, vampires were remarkably fragile while resting. The stake pierced the vampire\u0027s flesh. Blood had gushed from the wound, spraying Edward\u0027s face and hands and arms... \"Edward? Edward, such a gruesome thing to be remembering, and on a night such as this!\" Her voice was lightly chiding, but with an edge of malice. He shook the grotesque image from his mind. \"Perhaps, like most people, I had to lose what was truly important before I realized what I had lost.\" \"Forget all that for now. Come, let us hunt the night.\" It was in his mind to refuse. Hunting with Khira was always dangerous, he mused ruefully, and then he grinned. Perhaps, while prowling the night with her, he would find an end to the horror that his life had become. She looked at him and smiled. \"There is always risk, of course, mi amour . But that only makes it all the more delicious, does it not? Are you ready?\" He nodded, wishing she would stay out of his mind. \"Let us go, then.\" Tightening her grasp on his arm, she whisked them across town. Somewhat stunned by the suddenness of it, Ramsey glanced at his surroundings. They were in a house. A mansion, he amended, with shimmering crystal chandeliers and polished marble floors. The room, as large as a football field, was filled with men and women clad in evening attire. An orchestra was playing Rachmaninoff. He leaned toward Khira. \"What are we doing here?\" \"Visiting an old friend,\" she replied. \"Here\u0027s our host now.\" Ramsey turned to see a tall, slender man striding toward them. He had short brown hair, brilliant blue eyes, and appeared, outwardly, to be in his mid-thirties. He was a vampire - of that Edward had no doubt. \"Good evening, Khira,\" the man said. He bent over her hand in a gallant old-world gesture. \"How good of you to come.\" \"It\u0027s good to see you, too, Kyle.\" Kyle\u0027s gaze moved over Ramsey, coldly assessing. \"And who is this?\" \"This is Edward Ramsey. Edward, this is Kyle LaSalle.\" Shock, disbelief, rage. They all flitted through the vampire\u0027s eyes. \"Ramsey! You brought a vampire hunter into my home!\" \"Calm down, Kyle. He is one of us now.\" Ramsey knew a moment of surprise when he realized the other vampire had not detected what he was. He felt LaSalle\u0027s power push against him. For all his years, Kyle LaSalle was weak, his power easy to brush aside. Ramsey effortlessly resisted the other vampire\u0027s attempt to probe his mind. He compared LaSalle\u0027s power to Chiavari\u0027s as he sidestepped LaSalle\u0027s puny efforts to slip past his defenses. Comparing LaSalle to Chiavari was like comparing a snowball to a blizzard. Keeping his face impassive, he unleashed his own power. LaSalle took a step backward. He stared at Ramsey, his eyes narrowed. \"Who are you?\" Khira placed her hand on Edward\u0027s arm. \"He is mine,\" she said, and Ramsey heard the fine edge of steel beneath the soft velvet of her voice. \"My blood runs in his veins, as does the blood of Grigori.\" A hiss whispered through LaSalle\u0027s clenched teeth. \"Why have you brought him here?\" \"If we are not welcome, you have only to say so.\" \"Of course you are welcome.\" LaSalle bowed stiffly from the waist. \"Please, make my home yours.\" \"That is my intention,\" Khira replied. LaSalle smiled, but it was cold, forced. \"As you wish. If you will excuse me, I must see to my other guests.\" Khira lifted a graceful hand, dismissing him. \"I guess I must be a little confused,\" Ramsey remarked. \"What just happened here?\" \"Kyle will be moving out, and I will be moving in.\" \"Here?\" Ramsey exclaimed. \"You\u0027re moving in here?\" \"Yes. It\u0027s a nice place, don\u0027t you think?\" \"He\u0027s leaving, just like that?\" \"Of course.\" Ramsey shook his head. \"I still don\u0027t understand.\" \"It is quite simple, really. I have decided to stay in the city for a while.\" \"Getting a straight answer out of you is like pulling teeth,\" Ramsey muttered. \"Such an amusing choice of words.\" She smiled sweetly. \"But my answer is simplicity itself. I am staying. He is leaving.\" \"What if he had refused to go?\" \"He could challenge me, of course, but he would lose, and he knows it. He has never been strong. He is not even strong enough to challenge you, mi amour .\" Ramsey grunted softly. \"Did you visit Dracul, too?\" Her blue eyes turned to ice. \"Yes, I did.\" Ramsey remembered the article in the paper, the speculation that the rock star had met with foul play. \"Did he just pack up and leave town?\" \"In a manner of speaking, yes.\" \"He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\" She plucked two glasses of dark red wine from the tray of a passing waiter. \"Here, have a drink. Kyle\u0027s wine cellar is quite famous.\" Ramsey accepted the delicate crystal goblet she offered him. She smiled at him, the expression reminding him of a well-fed cat. \"Shall we drink to my new home?\" \"Why not?\" Holding the goblet by the slender stem, he lifted it to the light. It was a lovely shade of crimson. Like fresh blood. He sloshed it around gently, watched the scarlet drops slide slowly down the glass. The translucent liquid clung to the crystal. Again, the resemblance to blood was remarkable. Ramsey inhaled deeply. The bouquet was like the essence of summer captured, fermented, and freed again. Like lost innocence, when a warm summer evening was meant for romance, not hunting. He took a sip, the taste and the aroma mingling on the back of his tongue. Heightened by his vampire senses, he savored every drop, relishing the warm mellow glow that spread through him. It was a shame that food was now denied to him, he mused. If wine tasted this good, what would a nice, juicy steak taste like? \"Come,\" Khira said, \"I should like to take a look at my new home.\" \"Are you going to drive all the vampires out of the city?\" he asked as he followed her down a wide corridor lined with plush maroon carpeting. The walls were a stark white, lined with framed book covers and literary awards. Khira opened a door at the end of the hallway. \"This is a lovely room, is it not?\" She stepped back so he could look inside. It was a bedroom. The walls and carpet were white. The drapes and bedspread were black. There was an easy chair upholstered in red, a small black lacquer table. A single abstract painting done in red, black, and white adorned the wall above the bed. \"Lovely,\" he agreed. He followed her into the room, felt a sense of unease when she shut and locked the door behind him. \"What about Chiavari?\" \"What about him?\" She glided across the floor and sat down on the edge of the bed. The hem of her scarlet gown pooled around her feet, like blood. \"Damn it, answer me!\" \"We are hunters, predators.\" Her voice, though soft, hit him with the force of a slap. \"LaSalle and the others may have reached some sort of understanding, some sort of truce, but it means nothing to me. They will leave at my invitation or suffer the consequences.\" He started to speak, but she cut him off with a wave of her hand. \"I do not answer to you or to anyone. You are a mere infant, Edward. I could crush you with a thought.\" He didn\u0027t argue. He could feel her power flowing through the room, crawling over his skin, invading his mind. And then it was gone. \"All right. You\u0027ve proved your point.\" She smiled complacently. \"As for Grigori, he may stay so long as it pleases me.\" \"And me?\" She raked her nails lightly over his cheek. A caress? Or a warning? And then she patted the bed beside her. \"You, too, may stay, so long as you please me.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-sundown-vampire-trilogy-2/page-11.html","bookId":2297,"book":{"id":2297,"title":"After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2) He Has Become What He Once Destroyed.
