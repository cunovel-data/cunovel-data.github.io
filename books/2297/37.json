Turning over, he drew her into his arms, feeling totally at peace for the first time since the night he had awakened to find himself a newly made vampire. A week had passed since the slaughter at Chiavari\u0027s house. Kelly had quickly recovered from the horrible wounds Khira had inflicted on her. True to his word, Duncan had disposed of the bodies, then declared he was taking a much-needed vacation. Ramsey blew out a sigh. It was still hard to believe that Khira was no longer a threat - that a being so vital, so powerful, one who had lived for hundreds of years, had been brought down by a mere mortal. And a woman, at that. But Marisa was mortal no longer. He had known the moment Chiavari brought her across, though he couldn\u0027t say exactly how he knew. The words \"a disturbance in the Force\" had him grinning into the darkness, but that was what it had been like. He had felt the change in her, the shift of preternatural power. The night after Khira\u0027s death, Chiavari and Marisa had left the city. \"On an extended holiday,\" Chiavari had said. Ramsey couldn\u0027t help wondering if he would ever see them again, bemused by the thought that he would miss them. Both of them. Kelly stirred in his arms. \"You\u0027re very quiet,\" she remarked, dropping a kiss on his forearm. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"Something that\u0027s been in the back of my mind for a couple of weeks.\" \"Oh?\" She turned over onto her side to face him. \"What?\" \"We need to be prepared in case some other vampire decides to go on a rampage. For all her wicked ways, Khira never left any trace of her kills. Another vampire might not be so neat. If the word gets out that vampires really exist...\" She nodded. There would be panic in the streets, hysteria. In days gone by, the very word \"vampire\" had been enough to start a panic. And while she didn\u0027t think that would happen in this day and age, her mother had always told her, \"Better safe than sorry.\" \"So,\" he went on, \"I thought maybe I\u0027d set up a school to train vampire hunters. There aren\u0027t many of us left, you know.\" \"Us?\" Kelly asked, looking amused. Ramsey grinned. \"Once a hunter, always a hunter.\" \"Well, it sounds dangerous to me,\" Kelly said. \"What if they decide to hunt us?\" He gave her a wounded look. \"They won\u0027t know about us. We\u0027ll put Duncan in charge.\" \"What makes you think he\u0027d be interested?\" Ramsey brushed a kiss across her cheek. \"We won\u0027t know until we ask.\" \"What makes you think you can trust him?\" \"I\u0027ve taken his blood,\" Ramsey said, his expression sober. \"It will be impossible for him to betray me without my knowledge.\" He kissed the tip of her nose, his hand sliding up and down her rib cage. \"What would you think about buying the LaSalle mansion?\" \"Why?\" \"Knowing Khira, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s as impregnable as a vampire could make it.\" She smiled up at him. \"Suits me. I always wanted a mansion of my own.\" He kissed her again, slowly, seductively, amazed anew that she loved him, that she needed him. Wanted him. Her eyes glowed with the heat of her desire, and he swept her into his arms, silently thanking Grigori for the Dark Gift that had given him forever in the arms of the woman he loved.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-sundown-vampire-trilogy-2/page-37.html","bookId":2297,"book":{"id":2297,"title":"After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2) He Has Become What He Once Destroyed.
