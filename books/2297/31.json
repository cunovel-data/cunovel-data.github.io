What\u0027s not right?\"\n \"What Khira\u0027s doing to Grigori and Marisa. What gives her the right to do such a thing?\"\n \"She thinks she has the power to do it.\"\n \"Well, we ought to stop her. You heard Grigori. What if she decides she wants you next? I mean, Grigori and Marisa are married...\"\n \"We are going to stop her. Don\u0027t worry about that.\" He frowned at her. \"Your concern - is it really for Chiavari and Marisa? Or about you and me?\"\n She scooted toward him, her teeth grazing his shoulder. \"Both.\"\n He put his arm around her and drew her up close to his side. Her sweet, feminine curves fit against the lines of his body as though she had been designed for him. \"Are you trying to tell me something?\"\n She made a low growling sound and punched him on the arm. \"I\u0027m trying to get you to ask me something.\"\n Ramsey lifted one brow. \"Is that right?\"\n \"You said we\u0027d be together forever.\"\n He nodded.\n \"Well, I know times have changed, and people live together all the time without getting married, but I...\"\n \"Hush, Kelly.\"\n She stilled and looked away, but not before he saw the hurt in her eyes.\n Ramsey took her chin in his hand and gently forced her to look at him. \"Will you marry me, Kelly?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"No! Why not?\"\n \"Because you don\u0027t really want to.\"\n \"Kelly girl, when I ask a woman to spend forever with me, I mean it.\"\n \"You do?\"\n \"I said it, didn\u0027t I? I cannot imagine what I ever did without you in my life. I love you, Kelly girl.\"\n \"Oh, and I love you!\" she said, and launched herself on top of him, smothering him with kisses, caressing and nibbling until he was on fire for her.\n Fire. Desire and hunger burned within him. He felt her teeth at his throat, felt a sensual rush as her fangs pricked his flesh. His hands moved over her, lightly stroking, until his need was too great. Rolling over, he tucked her beneath him. She shivered with pleasure as his tongue laved her neck, moaned softly as she yielded to the vampire kiss, bucked beneath him as his body melded with hers. He saw her through a pulsing red haze, his every sense attuned to the woman in his arms, the touch of her, the taste of her, the scent of her - ah, the warm sweet scent of her blood; the musky scent of her heated flesh; the pleasurable pain of her nails raking his back, her teeth nipping his shoulder...\n \"Forever,\" he said, and carried them both over the edge.\n Kelly let out a slow, deep sigh. She had never known love like this in her whole life. Never. Rolling onto her side, she caressed Edward\u0027s cheek. \"Eddie? We have to do something to help Marisa.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Think of something. You used to be a vampire hunter. How would you have hunted Khira back then?\"\n \"In the daytime, when she was weak.\" He grunted softly. \"Hell, we don\u0027t even know if she is weak in the daytime. No one knows exactly how powerful she is.\"\n \"But there\u0027s three of us,\" Kelly argued. \"Four, if you count Lisa. And only one of Khira. You told Grigori...\"\n Yes, that combined we might do it. In the back of his mind, he heard Grigori\u0027s voice: \"There is powerful blood in your veins, Ramsey. Mine. Alexi\u0027s. And Khira\u0027s. She will find it difficult to destroy you if you keep your wits about you.\"\n There had been no mistaking the surprise and, yes, unease Khira had felt when he resisted her.\n Together, he and Grigori had destroyed Kristov.\n Khira had killed Noah Fox and Prince Dracul and Madame Rosa, and who knew how many other vampires, let alone innocent humans. She was like a plague, a one-woman virus, spreading through the city, preying on the weak.\n \"One way or another,\" Ramsey said, \"we will find a way.\"\n \"So, do you have any ideas?\" she asked, her eyes glowing with excitement.\n \"Not a one,\" he admitted, nuzzling her neck. \"But we will think of something. But first, what do you say we get married?\"\n The wedding was surprisingly easy to plan. They didn\u0027t need a church, Ramsey had no family, and Kelly\u0027s mother was in England. Ramsey found a minister who would perform the ceremony outside, in a local park, the following Saturday night.\n Kelly wrote out an invitation to Marisa, and then one for Grigori. \"It\u0027s not right that Grigori can\u0027t come with Marisa,\" she said.\n \"Chiavari is holding up his part of the bargain by keeping Khira occupied,\" Ramsey said. \"First things first.\"\n \"Is there anyone you want to invite?\"\n Ramsey thought briefly of Duncan, then shook his head. Inviting a vampire hunter to a vampire wedding was just asking for trouble.\n \"You know, it\u0027s a good thing the all-night market on the corner sells stamps,\" she said with a grin, \"or I\u0027d have to ask Marisa to go to the post office for me.\"\n Ramsey shook his head. \"It seems silly to send out two invitations when a couple of phone calls would do just as well. Besides, Khira probably won\u0027t let Grigori come anyway.\"\n \"Well, she\u0027d better!\" Rising, she put the invitations in her handbag, stepped into her sandals. \"Come on, let\u0027s go get some stamps. Oh! What about a license? The offices close before dark.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it\"\n \"How?\"\n He winked at her. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n \"All right.\" She slipped her arm through his. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n They wandered through the market, reminiscing about the taste of food. Kelly stopped in the candy aisle.\n \"Look at all that chocolate,\" she said with a sigh. \"It\u0027s the only thing I really miss. Well, that and ice cream. And hot fudge.\"\n Ramsey laughed. \"A real chocoholic, weren\u0027t you?\"\n She stuck her tongue out at him. \"Me and a million other women. Besides, don\u0027t you know? Dark chocolate is good for you.\"\n \"Sure, it is.\"\n \"It is! I heard a doctor say it was good for the enamel on your teeth, and good for your heart, too.\"\n He laughed out loud this time. \"Your teeth are fine, honey, trust me.\"\n She laughed, too, causing an elderly couple to stop and stare at them.\n Grinning, Kelly took Edward\u0027s hand. \"Come on, let\u0027s go get those stamps.\"\n They were heading for the check-out stand when Ramsey came to an abrupt halt.\n \"What is it?\"\n \"Duncan.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"There.\" He nodded at a tall man who was reaching for a bag of potato chips.\n \"Maybe he won\u0027t see us.\"\n Ramsey tugged on Kelly\u0027s hand, urging her backward, but it was too late.\n \"Hey, Ramsey!\" Duncan called.\n \"Hi, Tom.\"\n Duncan pushed his cart toward them. He gestured at the groceries inside. \"Heck of a way for a single man to spend a Saturday night, ain\u0027t it?\"\n Ramsey laughed. \"You need to get yourself a wife.\"\n Duncan nodded, his gaze moving over Kelly.\n \"You two haven\u0027t met, have you?\" Ramsey said. \"Tom, this is my fiancee, Kelly Anderson. Kelly, this is Tom Duncan.\"\n Duncan held out his hand. \"Nice to meet you, Kelly.\"\n \"Nice to meet you, too,\" she said, smiling. \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you.\"\n \"Good things, I hope. I\u0027m about done here,\" Duncan said. \"Maybe I could meet the two of you for a cup of coffee somewhere when you get done with your shopping.\"\n \"We just came in for some stamps,\" Ramsey said. \"We thought maybe we\u0027d catch a late movie.\"\n Duncan grunted softly. \"Which one?\"\n \"Whatever is playing when we get there.\"\n \"Mind if I join you?\"\n Ramsey glanced at Kelly. \"No, we don\u0027t mind, do we?\"\n \"No.\" She forced a smile.\n \"Good. You going to the theater just down the street?\"\n Ramsey nodded.\n \"Just let me pay for this stuff,\" Duncan said.\n They followed him to the check stand, bought a book of stamps, waited while Duncan put his groceries in the trunk of his car. Ramsey didn\u0027t miss the fact that Duncan had all the tools of the trade in place: a long, sharp knife, a strong silver chain, a hammer and a mallet, a shovel, a small case that he knew held a silver cross and several vials of holy water.\n \"Good thing I didn\u0027t buy any perishables,\" Duncan said, closing the trunk. \"Shall we go?\"\n As luck would have it, they got there just as a new movie started. Duncan bought three tickets, insisted it was his treat for horning in, and they entered the theater.\n \"Eddie, what are we going to do?\" Kelly whispered.\n \"Watch the movie,\" he said, squeezing her hand. \"And stop worrying.\"\n It was good advice, he mused, wishing he could take it himself. He was all too conscious of the man sitting next to him, of the great gulf between them. For the next two hours, he debated the wisdom of telling Duncan the truth and enlisting his help in defeating Khira.\n He grinned into the darkness. Unbelievable, that he would be looking for a way to rescue Chiavari when a few months ago he had been determined to kill him. Times changed, he mused ruefully, and so did people. Boy, how they changed!\n Duncan nudged him with his elbow. \"I\u0027m going out for popcorn. You want some?\"\n \"No, thanks.\"\n \"What about Kelly? She want anything?\"\n \"No. We had a big dinner before we left.\"\n With a nod, Duncan headed for the snack bar.\n \"Do you think he suspects?\" Kelly whispered.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Would he really kill you if he knew? I mean, he\u0027d be the perfect one to dispose of Khira, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"It crossed my mind, but he would be just as likely to take out every vampire in the city.\"\n Kelly shivered. \"I wouldn\u0027t like that.\"\n They fell silent as Duncan returned carrying a bag of popcorn and a large soft drink.\n \"Sure you don\u0027t want any?\" he asked, taking his seat.\n \"No, thanks.\"\n Lost in thought, Ramsey paid little attention to the rest of the movie.\n Later, walking out of the theater, Duncan asked Ramsey what he was doing the following Saturday night.\n Ramsey looked at Kelly and smiled. \"I have a heavy date, why?\"\n \"Still hoping we can get together.\" Duncan looked at Kelly. \"And go hunting.\"\n \"I told you, I will not hunt Chiavari.\"\n \"There are other vamps in the city. One old, one young.\"\n \"Khira,\" Ramsey said, his voice almost a whisper.\n Duncan nodded. \"I know you said you needed some time off, but I don\u0027t think I want to try and take her alone. And who knows how long she\u0027ll stick around? We need to take her out now, you know?\"\n \"I can\u0027t argue with that.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ve got my equipment in the car. When do we start?\"\n Ramsey swore under his breath. How long could he keep sidestepping Duncan\u0027s invitation?\n Kelly slipped her arm around Ramsey\u0027s waist. \"You\u0027ll have to wait a little while,\" she said, smiling sweetly. \"We\u0027re getting married on Saturday.\"\n Duncan\u0027s eyes widened. \"Married!\"\n Ramsey nodded.\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned! I don\u0027t know what to say... congratulations, I guess. Married! Hunters never get married.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m thinking of looking for a new line of work,\" Ramsey said. \"Kelly worries about me.\"\n She gave him a squeeze. \"It\u0027s time he put away the old wooden stake and found something a little less dangerous to do.\"\n Duncan glanced from Ramsey to Kelly and back again, then let out a deep breath. \"Well, I\u0027m happy for you both,\" he said, \"but I hate to lose Ramsey. He\u0027s the best hunter we\u0027ve ever had.\"\n \"Thanks, Tom.\"\n \"So, do I get an invite to the wedding?\"\n Ramsey knew a moment of panic. He was scrambling for an excuse when Kelly said, \"We\u0027re eloping, just the two of us. It\u0027s always been a dream of mine, and Eddie was kind enough to let me have my way.\"\n Duncan winked at Ramsey. \"Always good to let the little woman have her way before the wedding.\"\n Ramsey smiled. \"That\u0027s what I thought.\"\n \"Well, let me know when you get back in town, and we\u0027ll go out and celebrate.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do that.\"\n With a last, speculative look at the two of them, Duncan turned and walked down the street toward his car.\n Ramsey kissed Kelly on the cheek. \"That was quick thinking.\"\n \"He suspects something, doesn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m afraid so.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-sundown-vampire-trilogy-2/page-31.html","bookId":2297,"book":{"id":2297,"title":"After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n After Sundown (Vampire Trilogy #2) \n He Has Become What He Once Destroyed. \n Edward Ramsey has spent his life hunting vampires.
