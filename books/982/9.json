{"id":16249,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. Missions on the Congo River.","content":"Now as to the Congo River, and the two Protestant missions established there. When the missions had been established on the great lakes, Mr. Arthington, of Leeds, wrote to110 the Committee of the Baptist Missionary Society, offering them ￡1,000 if they would undertake mission-work in the Congo country, and in districts east of Angola, where there had been Roman Catholic missions in time long past. The Society accepted the offer, and sent instructions to two missionaries at the Cameroons to prepare for a preliminary journey in the region to be occupied. Scarcely had these steps been taken, when the news reached this country of Mr. Stanley’s arrival at the mouth of the Congo, having traced the course of the river from Nyangwe, and thus discovered a water highway into Central Africa. At once the field of the new mission became enlarged almost indefinitely. In January and April, 1878, journeys of exploration were made by Messrs. Grenfell and Comber, and the latter returned to this country to confer with the Committee and to seek for help in this enterprise. While these preliminary investigations were being made, a party arrived on the river to found the Livingstone (Congo) Inland Mission (undenominational). In June, 1879, Mr. Comber returned with three helpers, of whom the writer was one. We made our first station at San Salvador, the old capital of the Congo country, about seventy miles south111 of the highest navigable point of the Lower Congo. The natives of the upper river bring their ivory and produce in canoes to Stanley Pool, and there all has to change hands, as the river is not further navigable. The natives of the cataract region buy at the Pool, and convey to the white men on the coast. One of the great trade routes passes close to San Salvador, and we hoped that these traders might carry our stores and help us to Stanley Pool. They, however, steadily and persistently refused to allow us to go to the Pool, in spite of all we told them of our errand. ‘No,’ they said; ‘you white men stay on the coast, we will bring the produce to you there; but if you go to the Pool you will know our markets and buy where we do; our trade will be lost; then how shall we obtain our guns and powder, beads and brass, crockery-ware, and knives, cloth, and all the fine things we get now? No, we will never let you pass our towns; and if you persist you will be killed.’ They could not conceive of people who were not traders. We built a stone house, and were getting on nicely in our work at San Salvador, but beyond the king’s territory we were blocked by the native traders. Thirteen attempts were made, first on one road and then on another, until Mr. Comber112 was attacked, and shot. He was able to escape, and the slug was extracted. Then followed long palavering, and at last the road was declared open. Meanwhile, we learned that Mr. Stanley had returned to the Congo, and was engaged in making a road from Vivi, on the north bank of the Congo, from the point where the river ceased to be navigable. He was said to be acting for the King of the Belgians, and to have instructions to open up communications between the coast and Stanley Pool. This was good news indeed. Next we learned that a M. de Brazza, who had for a long time been exploring inland from the Ogowe River, near the Equator, had come down on to the Upper Congo, thence to Stanley Pool, and by the north bank to the coast. As the south bank road was declared open, it was determined that Messrs. Comber and Hartland should once more try it, while Mr. Crudgington and I should attempt the north bank. The south bank party met with a repulse in a few days; on the north bank we were more fortunate. We found that Mr. Stanley’s steamer road extended as far as Isangila, a distance of about fifty miles from Vivi. There we found his advanced party; beyond was unknown land. De Brazza must have kept far from the river, for we were113 soon among people who had never seen a white man, while there was so little intercommunication between the people that no one knew of Mr. Stanley’s approach a day’s march beyond his camp. We were therefore able to take the people by surprise; and when we reached the districts of the ivory traders, they were bewildered at our sudden, unexpected advent, not having any idea of white men trying to reach the upper river; they had not recovered from their astonishment before we had passed on. So, sleeping in quiet places, and travelling rapidly in this way, we were able to reach the Pool, and visited Ntamu, where now Leopoldville and our Arthington Station are established. Having accomplished all that we desired, and ascertained the correct geographical position of Stanley Pool, we returned. It was a risky, adventurous, anxious journey, but we accomplished it in safety, and were thus the first who had made the journey from the coast to Stanley Pool. We found that our brethren of the Livingstone Mission had established their advanced post at Mbemba, on the banks of the Congo, about eighty miles from Vivi. Mr. Crudgington came to this country, to consult with the Committee of the Society, and to114 get a steel sectional boat, according to Mr. Stanley’s advice. He hoped to be able to navigate a reach of about ninety miles of the cataract region, from Isangila to Manyanga, a distance of only eighty-five miles from Stanley Pool; he advised us to do the same. Mr. Crudgington brought out the boat, the Plymouth, which we transported to Isangila, and then were able to establish ourselves beside the International Association at Manyanga. After a few months Mr. Stanley kindly offered us a fine site at Stanley Pool, which we gladly accepted and occupied in the autumn of 1882, calling it Arthington Station. Some months after, the Livingstone Mission arrived, and obtained a site from the International Association. Thus far, the two missions are arranged alternately along the line. Each manages its own transport service, which is a severe task on those who have to attend to it—so severe, indeed, that we cannot arrange ourselves so that each might help the other, although we should like to do so; but, as it is, we can find sufficient carriers, and maintain the transport in an effective manner. When the natives saw that we were transporting by water, and thus avoiding their opposition, they opened the roads, and were117 willing to carry. We therefore gladly relinquished the cataract water, and now all is conveyed from Underhill, our first station on the south bank, nearly opposite Vivi, to Stanley Pool, a distance of about 225 miles. SECTION OF THE MISSION BOAT PLYMOUTH. Everything is carried on men’s heads from station to station. The Baptist Mission has four stations between the coast and Stanley Pool inclusive. The fifth station, San Salvador, is off the line. The Livingstone Mission has six stations up to the Pool. A Portuguese Roman Catholic mission soon followed us to San Salvador, but they have not been able to do much to trouble us. As soon as the transport service was working properly, Mr. Grenfell, of the Baptist Mission, came to this country to superintend the construction of a steamer for the Upper Congo. The whole expense was generously met by Mr. Arthington. The Peace was built by Messrs. Thornycroft and Co., of Chiswick; she ran her trial trip on the Thames. The vessel is built of galvanised steel, is seventy feet in length, and propelled by twin screws. After her trial trip she was taken to pieces, and sent out to the Congo in that state. Arrived at Underhill, she was transported over the 225 miles to the Pool, on men’s heads, and everything reached there safely; of the thousand118 and one parts that go to make up a steamer, nothing was missing. Two engineers were sent out to reconstruct her, but they died of fever before they arrived at the Pool. When the news reached this country, another engineer was sent out. He, too, died on the road up. Mr. Grenfell had then to build the steamer himself, and, having great engineering ability, he was able to instruct his native assistants in the art of riveting. Having placed a part in position, they drove the rivets, and did their work so carefully and skilfully that, when the time came to launch the Peace, she was found to be a perfect success—no leaks—as nicely riveted as if European workmen had put her together. The Livingstone Mission has also a stern wheel steamer, the Henry Reed, built by Messrs. Forrest. She, too, was transported in the same manner, was reconstructed after the Peace was launched, on the same stocks, by Mr. Billington, of that Mission. PUTTING SECTIONS TOGETHER. Mr. Stanley has also three steamers on the Upper Congo, and a fourth had by the last mail nearly reached the Pool. The International Association had by this time acquired sovereign rights over large districts in the cataract region of the Congo, and in the valley of the Niadi Kwilu. It121 had also established itself at the Equator, beyond which Mr. Stanley had continued the work, over the whole length of the navigable river, to the Stanley Falls, 1060 miles, exploring several affluents, upon which he found two new lakes. Treaties were made with chiefs over the whole length, stations and military posts were placed among friendly people, and a station was established at the Stanley Falls. While this was going on, various circumstances were bringing Africa very prominently before the eye of Europe. Germany was annexing freely along the coast. Complications arose in consequence of this. There were difficulties in reference to Angra Pequena, the south-east coast, the Niger; troubles between the French Government and the International Association. Portugal proposed to annex the mouth of the Congo. An annexation fever was in the air. To prevent the breaking out of serious trouble, a Conference of the Great Powers of Europe was called. It was now time for the International Association to explain its position, and to seek a recognition of its acquired rights. When the news of Mr. Stanley’s great journey ‘across the Dark Continent’ reached Europe,122 King Leopold of the Belgians conceived the idea of opening up the vast newly-discovered regions to the benefits of civilisation and commerce. It was felt that such a work could not be accomplished unless the whole region could become a Free State. It was rightly feared that, as soon as the importance of the Basin became known, France or Portugal might annex the mouth of the river, and thus destroy all hope of future development. In their colonies near the mouth of the Congo, both France and Portugal so hampered trade with heavy dues and restrictions that comparatively little could be done. Then, again, there could be no future for the Free State without a railway to convey the produce from Stanley Pool to the coast. With such a means of transport, the whole country, with its vast resources, would be placed within easy reach of Europe. Were a simple company to attempt this, it would soon be ruined by the greed or false economy of France or Portugal. Quietly, but energetically, therefore, the Association acquired sovereign rights, until France and Portugal threatened to annex. When the Conference commenced to sit, these two Powers each made large demands. European jealousies, however, prevailed to thwart this greed. The other Powers saw no123 advantage in allowing either France or Portugal to annex, and keep for herself, this newly-found continent; so, first, they agreed that the whole region of the Congo Basin should be thrown open to the commerce of all nations. Since Europe had thus declared herself, the district was scarcely worth so much in the eyes of France. Accordingly, she consented to recognise the sovereignty of the Association, on condition that large tracts on the right bank of the Congo were ceded to France. It was an unsatisfactory bargain, but it was either that or nothing for the Free State. Accordingly, the French boundary is extended from the Gaboon down to 5° S. latitude, thence, following the line of the Chiloango River to its northernmost source, whence the line strikes the Congo a little above Manyanga; the river becomes the boundary until near the Equator, then the eastern watershed of the Likona is the limit. Portugal was very obstinate, and an identic note from England, Germany, and France was necessary to bring her to terms. It was finally arranged that the Portuguese boundary should be extended to the south bank of the Congo as far as Wanga Wanga, a distance of ninety-five miles; then to follow a line, due east, on the latitude of Noki, as far as the124 Kwangu River, including also a small piece of coast-line near the French frontier. The others Powers readily recognised the Free State, which had thus a coast-line of 23? miles. The Conference had meanwhile decided that the whole of the Congo Basin should be thrown open to free trade without any restriction, and added to the region a coast-line from Setta Cama to Ambriz. Avoiding the watersheds of the Nile and the Zambesi, it is extended to the Indian Ocean. The north bank of the Zambesi to five miles above the confluence of the Shire is included, also the basin of the Shire, and the Lake Nyassa. Thus both the Scotch Missions and the African Lakes Company are safe. Beside the most rigid injunctions enforcing free trade, absolute religious liberty and freedom of worship are guaranteed; special favour and protection is provided for all missionaries and religious and scientific enterprises. The slave trade also is not to be tolerated in any part. King Leopold of Belgium will assume the sovereignty of the Free State. We cannot fail to see the hand of God in this result. Those who have been watching the development of affairs can but wonder at the marvellous Providence which has guided all. Now with such125 a sovereign, and such a Charter of Freedom, we can but look forward with the fullest hope to the future of the Free State of the Congo (l’Etat Indépendant du Congo). The Livingstone Mission has, since the 1st of January, 1886, been transferred to the American Baptist Missionary union. The best understanding exists between the two societies on the field; there is room for all the energy and force that each can bring. Although on the line of transport we are compelled to keep near to each other, on the great upper river we must keep far distant, if we would wisely and thoroughly occupy this vast field. As to its openness and readiness for missionary effort, let the last news received speak. Mr. Grenfell had recently returned from a voyage in the Peace (B.M.S.) over the whole length of the river to Stanley Falls, exploring several affluents, a journey of over 4000 miles, one third of the voyage being in waters never before visited by any European. One of the affluents, the Mobangi, he traced for 400 miles as far as 4.30° N. lat., and when he turned back it was still a great river, and navigable probably for a long distance. It is believed to be identical with Schweinfurth’s Welle, and if so, we have a highway to the Southern Soudan. The Baptist Missionary Society intend, as soon126 as possible, to place ten stations, say 100 miles apart, along the 1060 miles of clear waterway to Stanley Falls, each in the best strategic positions, which shall be centres for further operations on the great affluents and surrounding districts. Mr. Arthington presented the Mission last year with a further donation of ￡2000, on condition that as soon as practicable its operations should be extended as far as the Lake Muta Nzige (about 250 miles), where we hope, before many years have elapsed, to join hands with our brethren of the Church Missionary Society, working westward from Rubaga in Uganda (distant about 200 miles), and our brethren of the London Missionary Society, working northwards from Lake Tanganika (about 100 miles). \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3072/84883.html","bookId":982,"book":{"id":982,"title":"Life on the Congo","description":"简介： Although only four years have elapsed since my colleague penned the accompanying chapters, yet events have followed each other so fast that another short chapter seems to be needed to bring them up to date.
