{"id":62779,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The drugstore had a lunch counter. I sat on a stool and ate a grilled cheese sandwich and a too-sweet piece of cherry pie and drank two cups of black coffee. The coffee wasn\u0027t bad, but it couldn\u0027t compare with the stuff Jan had brewed in her Chemex filter pot.\n I thought about her. Then I went to the phone again and almost dialed her number, but tried Havermeyer again instead. This time he answered.\n I said, \"Burton Havermeyer? My name\u0027s Matthew Scudder. I wondered if I could come around and see you this afternoon.\"\n \"What about?\"\n \"It\u0027s a police matter. Some questions I\u0027d like to ask you. I won\u0027t take up much of your time.\"\n \"You\u0027re a police officer?\"\n Hell. \"I used to be one.\"\n \"So did I. Could you tell me what you want with me, Mr.-?\"\n \"Scudder,\" I supplied. \"It\u0027s ancient history, actually. I\u0027m a detective now and I\u0027m working on a case you were involved with when you were with the Six-One.\"\n \"That was years ago.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"Can\u0027t we do this over the phone? I can\u0027t imagine what information I could possibly have that would be useful to you. I was a beat patrolman, I didn\u0027t work on cases. I-\"\n \"I\u0027d like to drop by if it\u0027s all right.\"\n \"Well, I-\"\n \"I won\u0027t take up much of your time.\"\n There was a pause. \"It\u0027s my day off,\" he said, in what was not quite a whine. \"I just figured to sit around, have a couple of beers, watch a ball game.\"\n \"We can talk during the commercials.\"\n He laughed. \"Okay, you win. You know the address? The name\u0027s on the bell. When should I expect you?\"\n \"An hour, hour and a half.\"\n \"Good enough.\"\n THE Upper West Side is another neighborhood on the upswing, but the local renaissance hasn\u0027t crossed Ninety-sixth Street yet. Havermeyer lived on 103rd between Columbus and Amsterdam in one of the rundown brownstones that lined both sides of the street. The neighborhood was mostly Spanish. There were a lot of people sitting on the stoops, listening to enormous portable radios and drinking Miller High Life out of brown paper bags. Every third woman was pregnant.\n I found the right building and rang the right bell and climbed four flights of stairs. He was waiting for me in the doorway of one of the back apartments. He said, \"Scudder?\" and I nodded. \"Burt Havermeyer,\" he said. \"Come on in.\"\n I followed him into a fair-sized studio with a Pullman kitchen. The overhead light fixture was a bare bulb in one of those Japanese paper shades. The walls were due for paint. I took a seat on the couch and accepted the can of beer he handed me. He popped one for himself, then moved to turn off the television set, a black and white portable perched on top of an orange crate that held paperback books on its lower two shelves.\n He pulled up a chair for himself, crossed his legs. He looked to be in his early thirties, five-eight or -nine, pale complected, with narrow shoulders and a beer gut. He wore brown gabardine slacks and a brown and beige patterned sportshirt. He had deep-set brown eyes, heavy jowls and slicked-down dark brown hair, and he hadn\u0027t shaved that morning. Neither, come to think of it, had I.\n \"About nine years ago,\" I said. \"A woman named Susan Potowski.\"\n \"I knew it.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"I hung up and I thought, why\u0027s anybody want to talk with me about some case nine or ten years old? Then I figured it had to be the icepick thing. I read the papers. They got the guy, right? They made a lap and he fell in it.\"\n \"That\u0027s about it.\" I explained how Louis Pinell had denied a role in the death of Barbara Ettinger and how the facts appeared to bear him out.\n \"I don\u0027t get it,\" he said. \"That still leaves something like eight killings, doesn\u0027t it? Isn\u0027t that enough to put him away?\"\n \"It\u0027s not enough for the Ettinger woman\u0027s father. He wants to know who killed his daughter.\"\n \"And that\u0027s your job.\" He whistled softly. \"Lucky you.\"\n \"That\u0027s about it.\" I drank a little beer from the can. \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any connection between the Potowski killing and the one I\u0027m investigating, but they\u0027re both in Brooklyn and maybe Pinell didn\u0027t do either of them. You were the first police officer on the scene. You remember that day pretty well?\"\n \"Jesus,\" he said. \"I ought to.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"I left the force because of it. But I suppose they told you that out in Sheepshead Bay.\"\n \"All they said was unspecified personal reasons.\"\n \"That right?\" He held his beer can in both hands and sat with his head bowed, looking down at it. \"I remember how her kids screamed,\" he said. \"I remember knowing I was going to walk in on something really bad, and then the next memory I have is I\u0027m in her kitchen looking down at the body. One of the kids is hanging onto my pants leg the way kids do, you know how they do, and I\u0027m looking down at her and I close my eyes and open \u0027em again and the picture doesn\u0027t change. She was in a whatchacallit, a housecoat. It had like Japanese writing on it and a picture of a bird, Japanese-style art. A kimono? I guess you call it a kimono. I remember the color. Orange, with black trim.\n He looked up at me, then dropped his eyes again. \"The housecoat was open. The kimono. Partially open. There were these dots all over her body, like punctuation marks. Where he got her with the icepick. Mostly the torso. She had very nice breasts. That\u0027s a terrible thing to remember but how do you quit remembering? Standing there noticing all the wounds in her breasts, and she\u0027s dead, and still noticing that she\u0027s got a first-rate pair of tits. And hating yourself for thinking it.\"\n \"It happens.\"\n \"I know, I know, but it sticks in your mind like a bone caught in your throat. And the kids wailing, and noises outside. At first I don\u0027t hear any of the noise because the sight of her just blocks everything else. Like it deafens you, knocks out the other senses. Do you know what I mean?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Then the sound comes up, and the kid\u0027s still hanging on my pants leg, and if he lives to be a hundred that\u0027s how he\u0027s gonna remember his mother. Myself, I never saw her before in my life, and I couldn\u0027t get that picture out of my head. It repeated on me night and day. When I slept it got in my nightmares and during the day it would come into my mind at odd moments. I didn\u0027t want to go in anyplace. I didn\u0027t want to risk coming up on another dead body. And it dawned on me finally that I didn\u0027t want to stay in a line of work where when people get killed it\u0027s up to you to deal with it. \u0027Unspecified personal reasons.\u0027 Well, I just specified. I gave it a little time and it didn\u0027t wear off and I quit.\"\n \"What do you do now?\"\n \"Security guard.\" He named a midtown store. \"I tried a couple of other things but I\u0027ve had this job for seven years now. I wear a uniform and I even have a gun on my hip. Job I had before this, you wore a gun but it wasn\u0027t loaded. That drove me nuts. I said I\u0027d carry a gun or not carry a gun, it didn\u0027t matter to me, but don\u0027t give me an unloaded gun because then the bad guys think you\u0027re armed but you can\u0027t defend yourself. Now I got a loaded gun and it hasn\u0027t been out of the holster in seven years and that\u0027s the way I like it. I\u0027m a deterrent to robbery and shoplifting. Not as much of a deterrent to shoplifting as we\u0027d like. Boosters can be pretty slick.\"\n \"I can imagine.\"\n \"It\u0027s dull work. I like that. I like knowing I don\u0027t have to walk into somebody\u0027s kitchen and there\u0027s death on the floor. I joke with other people on the job, I hook a shoplifter now and then, and the whole thing\u0027s nice and steady. I got a simple life, you know what I mean? I like it that way.\"\n \"A question about the murder scene.\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"The woman\u0027s eyes.\"\n \"Oh, Christ,\" he said. \"You had to remind me.\"\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"Her eyes were open. He stabbed all the victims in the eyes. I didn\u0027t know that. It was kept out of the papers, the way they\u0027ll hold something back, you know? But when the detectives got there they saw it right away and that cinched it, you know, that it wasn\u0027t our case and we could buck it on up to some other precinct. I forget which one.\"\n \"Midtown South.\"\n \"If you say so.\" He closed his eyes for a moment. \"Did I say her eyes were open? Staring up at the ceiling. But they were like ovals of blood.\"\n \"Both eyes?\"\n \"Pardon?\"\n \"Were both of her eyes the same?\"\n He nodded. \"Why?\"\n \"Barbara Ettinger was only stabbed in one eye.\"\n \"It make a difference?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"If somebody was going to copy the killer, they\u0027d copy him completely, wouldn\u0027t they?\"\n \"You\u0027d think so.\"\n \"Unless it was him and he was rushed for a change. Who knows with a crazy person, anyway? Maybe this time God told him only stab one eye. Who knows?\"\n He went for another beer and offered me one but I passed. I didn\u0027t want to hang around long enough to drink it. I had really only had one question to ask him and his answer had done nothing but confirm the medical report. I suppose I could have asked it over the phone, but then I wouldn\u0027t have had the same chance to probe his memory and get a real sense of what he\u0027d found in that kitchen. No question now that he\u0027d gone back in time and seen Susan Potowski\u0027s body all over again. He wasn\u0027t guessing that she\u0027d been stabbed in both eyes. He had closed his own eyes and seen the wounds.\n He said, \"Sometimes I wonder. Well, when I read about them arresting this Pinell, and now with you coming over here. Suppose I wasn\u0027t the one walked in on the Potowski woman? Or suppose it happened three years later when I had that much more experience? I can see how my whole life might have been different.\"\n \"You might have stayed on the force.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible, right? I don\u0027t know if I really liked being a cop or if I was any good at it. I liked the classes at the Academy. I liked wearing the uniform. I liked walking the beat and saying hello to people and having them say hello back. Actual police work, I don\u0027t know how much I liked it. Maybe if I was really cut out for it I wouldn\u0027t have been thrown for a loop by what I saw in that kitchen. Or I would have toughed it out and gotten over it eventually. You were a cop yourself and you quit, right?\"\n \"For unspecified personal reasons.\"\n \"Yeah, I guess there\u0027s a lot of that going around.\"\n \"There was a death involved,\" I said. \"A child. What happened, I lost my taste for the work.\"\n \"Exactly what happened with me, Matt. I lost my taste for it. You know what I think? If it wasn\u0027t that one particular thing it would have been something else.\"\n Could I say the same thing? It was not a thought that had occurred to me previously. If Estrellita Rivera had been home in bed where she belonged, would I still be living in Syosset and carrying a badge? Or would some other incident have given me an inevitable nudge in a direction I had to walk?\"\n I said, \"You and your wife separated.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Same time you put in your papers?\"\n \"Not too long after that.\"\n \"You move here right away?\"\n \"I was in an S.R.O. hotel a couple blocks down on Broadway. I stayed there for maybe ten weeks until I found this place. Been here ever since.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-14.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: \n A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
