{"id":62786,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"For me?\" He nodded. \"Young, not bad-looking. Nice clothes, nice hair. Gave me a couple of bucks to point you out when you came in. I don\u0027t even know if you\u0027re comin\u0027 back, so I figured I\u0027d take a chance, look here and there and see if I could find you. I got Eddie coverin\u0027 the desk for me. You comin\u0027 back to the hotel?\" \"I hadn\u0027t planned to.\" \"What you could do, see, you could look her over and gimme a sign to point you out or not point you out. I\u0027d just as soon earn the couple of bucks, but I\u0027m not gonna go and retire on it, you know what I mean? If you want to duck this dame-\" \"You can point me out,\" I said. \"Whoever she is.\" He went back to the desk. I finished my coffee and the paper and took my time returning to the hotel. When I walked in Vinnie nodded significantly toward the wing chair over by the cigarette machine, but he needn\u0027t have bothered. I\u0027d have spotted her without help. She looked utterly out of place, a well-groomed, well-coiffed, color-coordinated suburban princess who\u0027d found her way to the wrong part of Fifty-seventh Street. A few blocks east she might have been having an adventure, making the rounds of the art galleries, looking for a print that would go well with the mushroom-toned drapes in the family room. I let Vinnie earn his money, strolled past her, stood waiting for the elevator. Its doors were just opening when she spoke my name. I said, \"Hello, Mrs. Ettinger.\" \"How-\" \"Saw your picture on your husband\u0027s desk. And I probably would have recognized your voice, although I\u0027ve only heard it over the phone.\" The blonde hair was a little longer than in the picture in Douglas Ettinger\u0027s photo cube, and the voice in person was less nasal, but there was no mistaking her. \"I heard your voice a couple of times. Once when I called you, once when you called me, and again when I called you back.\" \"I thought that was you,\" she said. \"It frightened me when the phone rang and you didn\u0027t say anything.\" \"I just wanted to make sure I\u0027d recognized the voice.\" \"I called you since then. I called twice yesterday.\" \"I didn\u0027t get any messages.\" \"I didn\u0027t leave any. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d have said if I reached you. Is there someplace more private where we can talk?\" I took her out for coffee, not to the Red Flame but to another similar place down the block. On the way out Vinnie tipped me a wink and a sly smile. I wonder how much money she\u0027d given him. Less, I\u0027m sure, than she was prepared to give me. We were no sooner settled with our coffee than she put her purse on the table and gave it a significant tap. \"I have an envelope in here,\" she announced. \"There\u0027s five thousand dollars in it.\" \"That\u0027s a lot of cash to be carrying in this town.\" \"Maybe you\u0027d like to carry it for me.\" She studied my face, and when I failed to react she leaned forward, dropping her voice conspiratorially. \"The money\u0027s for you, Mr. Scudder. Just do what Mr. London already asked you to do. Drop the case.\" \"What are you afraid of, Mrs. Ettinger?\" \"I just don\u0027t want you poking around in our lives.\" \"What is it you think I might find there?\" Her hand clutched her purse, seeking security in the presumptive power of five thousand dollars. Her nail polish was the color of iron rust. Gently I said, \"Do you think your husband killed his first wife?\" \"No!\" \"Then what have you got to be afraid of?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"When did you meet your husband, Mrs. Ettinger?\" She met my eyes, didn\u0027t answer. \"Before his wife was killed?\" Her fingers kneaded her handbag. \"He went to college on Long Island. You\u0027re younger than he is, but you could have known him then.\" \"That was before he even knew her,\" she said. \"Long before they were married. Then we happened to run into each other again after her death.\" \"And you were afraid I\u0027d find that out?\" \"I-\" \"You were seeing him before she died, weren\u0027t you?\" \"You can\u0027t prove that.\" \"Why would I have to prove it? Why would I even want to prove it?\" She opened the purse. Her fingers clumsy with the clasp but she got the bag open and took out a manila bank envelope. \"Five thousand dollars,\" she said. \"Put it away.\" \"Isn\u0027t it enough? It\u0027s a lot of money. Isn\u0027t five thousand dollars a lot of money for doing nothing?\" \"It\u0027s too much. You didn\u0027t kill her, did you, Mrs. Ettinger?\" \"Me?\" She had trouble getting a grip on the question. \"Me? Of course not.\" \"But you were glad when she died.\" \"That\u0027s horrible,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t say that.\" \"You were having an affair with him. You wanted to marry him, and then she was killed. How could you help being glad?\" Her eyes were pitched over my shoulder, gazing off into the distance. Her voice was as remote as her gaze. She said, \"I didn\u0027t know she was pregnant. He saidâ€¦ he said he hadn\u0027t known that either. He told me they weren\u0027t sleeping together. Having sex, I mean. Of course they slept together, they shared a bed, but he said they weren\u0027t having sex. I believed him.\" The waitress was approaching to refill our coffee cups. I held up a hand to ward off the interruption. Karen Ettinger said, \"He said she was carrying another man\u0027s child. Because it couldn\u0027t have been his baby.\" \"Is that what you told Charles London?\" \"I never spoke to Mr. London.\" \"Your husband did, though, didn\u0027t he? Is that what he told him? Is that what London was afraid would come out if I stayed on the case?\" Her voice was detached, remote. \"He said she was pregnant by another man. A black man. He said the baby would have been black.\" \"That\u0027s what he told London.\" \"Yes.\" \"Had he ever told you that?\" \"No. I think it was just something he made up to influence Mr. London.\" She looked at me, and her eyes showed me a little of the person hidden beneath the careful suburban exterior. \"Just like the rest of it was something he made up for my sake. It was probably his baby.\" \"You don\u0027t think she was having an affair?\" \"Maybe. Maybe she was. But she must have been sleeping with him, too. Or else she would have been careful not to get pregnant. Women aren\u0027t stupid.\" She blinked her eyes several times. \"Except about some things. Men always tell their girlfriends that they\u0027ve stopped sleeping with their wives. And it\u0027s always a lie.\" \"Do you think that-\" She rolled right over my question. \"He\u0027s probably telling her that he\u0027s not sleeping with me anymore,\" she said, her tone very matter-of-fact. \"And it\u0027s a lie.\" \"Telling whom?\" \"Whoever he\u0027s having an affair with.\" \"Your husband is currently having an affair with someone?\" \"Yes,\" she said, and frowned. \"I didn\u0027t know that until just now. I knew it, but I didn\u0027t know that I knew it. I wish you had never taken this case. I wish Mr. London had never heard of you in the first place.\" \"Mrs. Ettinger-\" She was standing now, her purse gripped in both hands, her face showing her pain. \"I had a good marriage,\" she insisted. \"And what have I got now? Will you tell me that? What have I got now?\" Chapter 15 I don\u0027t suppose she wanted an answer. I certainly didn\u0027t have one for her, and she didn\u0027t hang around to find out what else I might have to say. She walked stiffly out of the coffee shop. I stayed long enough to finish my own coffee, then left a tip and paid the check. Not only hadn\u0027t I taken her five thousand dollars, but I\u0027d wound up buying her coffee. It was a nice day out and I thought I\u0027d kill a little time by walking part of the way to my appointment with Lynn London. As it turned out I walked all the way downtown and east, stopping once to sit on a park bench and another time for coffee and a roll. When I crossed Fourteenth Street I ducked into Dan Lynch\u0027s and had the first drink of the day. I\u0027d thought earlier that I might switch to Scotch, which had once again spared me a hangover, but I\u0027d ordered a shot of bourbon with a short beer for a chaser before I remembered my decision. I drank it down and enjoyed the warmth of it. The saloon had a rich beery smell and I enjoyed that, too, and would have liked to linger a while. But I\u0027d already stood up the schoolteacher once. I found the school, walked in. No one questioned my entering it or stopped me in the corridors. I located Room 41 and stood in the doorway for a moment, studying the woman seated at the blond oak desk. She was reading a book and unaware of my presence. I knocked on the open door and she looked up at me. \"I\u0027m Matthew Scudder,\" I said. \"And I\u0027m Lynn London. Come in. Close the door.\" She stood up and we shook hands. There was no place for me to sit, just child-sized desks. The children\u0027s artwork and test papers, some marked with gold or silver stars, were tacked on bulletin boards. There was a problem in long division worked out in yellow chalk on the blackboard. I found myself checking the arithmetic. \"You wanted a picture,\" Lynn London was saying. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not much on family memorabilia. This was the best I could do. This was Barbara in college.\" I studied the photo, glanced from it to the woman standing beside me. She caught the eye movement. \"If you\u0027re looking for a resemblance,\" she said, \"don\u0027t waste your time. She looked like our mother.\" Lynn favored her father. She had the same chilly blue eyes. Like him she wore glasses, but hers had heavy rims and rectangular lenses. Her brown hair was pulled back and coiled in a tight bun on the back of her head. There was a severity in her face, a sharpness to her features, and although I knew she was only thirty-three she looked several years older. There were lines at the corners of her eyes, deeper ones at the corners of her mouth. I couldn\u0027t get much from Barbara\u0027s picture. I\u0027d seen police photos of her after death, high-contrast black and whites shot in the kitchen on Wyckoff Street, but I wanted something that would give me a sense of the person and Lynn\u0027s photograph didn\u0027t supply that, either. I may have been looking for more than a photograph could furnish. She said, \"My father\u0027s afraid you\u0027ll drag Barbara\u0027s name through the mud. Will you?\" \"I hadn\u0027t planned on it.\" \"Douglas Ettinger told him something and he\u0027s afraid you\u0027ll tell it to the world. I wish I knew what it was.\" \"He told your father that your sister was carrying a black man\u0027s child.\" \"Holy Jesus. Is that true?\" \"What do you think?\" \"I think Doug\u0027s a worm. I\u0027ve always thought that. Now I know why my father hates you.\" \"Hates me?\" \"Uh-huh. I wondered why. In fact I wanted to meet you mostly to find out what kind of man would inspire such a strong reaction in my father. You see, if it weren\u0027t for you he wouldn\u0027t have been given that piece of information about his sainted daughter. If he hadn\u0027t hired you, and if you hadn\u0027t talked to Doug-you did talk to Doug, I assume?\" \"I met him. At the store in Hicksville.\" \"If you hadn\u0027t, he wouldn\u0027t have told my father something my father emphatically did not want to be told. I think he\u0027d prefer to believe that both of his daughters are virgins. Well, he may not care so much about me. I had the temerity to get divorced so that makes me beyond redemption. He\u0027d be sick if I got into an interracial romance, because after all there\u0027s a limit, but I don\u0027t think he cares if I have affairs. I\u0027m already damaged goods.\" Her voice was flat, less bitter than the words she was speaking. \"But Barbara was a saint. If I got killed he wouldn\u0027t hire you in the first place, but if he did he wouldn\u0027t care what you found. With Barbara it\u0027s a different story altogether.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-21.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
