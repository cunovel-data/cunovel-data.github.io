Right.\"\n \"Any kids?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Makes it easier.\"\n \"I guess so.\"\n \"My wife and sons are out on Long Island. I\u0027m in a hotel on Fifty-seventh Street.\"\n He nodded, understanding. People move and their lives change. He\u0027d wound up guarding cashmere sweaters. I\u0027d wound up doing whatever it is I do. Looking in a coal mine for a black cat, according to Antonelli. Looking for a cat that wasn\u0027t even there.\n Chapter 10\n When I got back to my hotel there was a message from Lynn London. I called her from the pay phone in the lobby and explained who I was and what I wanted.\n She said, \"My father hired you? It\u0027s funny he didn\u0027t say anything to me. I thought they had the man who killed my sister. Why would he suddenly-well, let\u0027s let it ride for now. I don\u0027t know what help I could be.\"\n I said I\u0027d like to meet with her to talk about her sister.\n \"Not tonight,\" she said briskly. \"I just got back from the mountains a couple of hours ago. I\u0027m exhausted and I\u0027ve got to do my lesson plans for the week.\"\n \"Tomorrow?\"\n \"I teach during the day. I\u0027ve got a dinner date and I\u0027m going to a concert after that. Tuesday\u0027s my group therapy night. Maybe Wednesday? That\u0027s not terribly good for me either. Hell.\"\n \"Maybe we could-\"\n \"Maybe we could handle it over the phone? I don\u0027t really know very much, Mr. Scudder, and God knows I\u0027m beat at the moment, but perhaps I could deal with, say, ten minutes\u0027 worth of questions right now, because otherwise I honestly don\u0027t know when we could get together. I don\u0027t really know very much, it was a great many years ago and-\"\n \"When do you finish your classes tomorrow afternoon?\"\n \"Tomorrow afternoon? We dismiss the children at three fifteen, but-\"\n \"I\u0027ll meet you at your apartment at four.\"\n \"I told you. I have a dinner date tomorrow.\"\n \"And a concert after it. I\u0027ll meet you at four. I won\u0027t take that much of your time.\"\n She wasn\u0027t thrilled, but that\u0027s how we left it. I spent another dime and called Jan Keane. I recapped the day and she told me she was in awe of my industriousness. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Sometimes I think I\u0027m just putting in time. I could have accomplished the same thing today with a couple of phone calls.\"\n \"We could have handled our business over the phone last night,\" she said. \"As far as that goes.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad we didn\u0027t.\"\n \"So am I,\" she said. \"I think. On the other hand, I was planning on working today and I couldn\u0027t even look at clay. I\u0027m just hoping this hangover wears off by bedtime.\"\n \"I had a clear head this morning.\"\n \"Mine\u0027s just beginning to clear now. Maybe my mistake was staying in the house. The sun might have burned off some of the fog. Now I\u0027m just sitting around until it\u0027s a reasonable hour to go to sleep.\"\n There might have been an unspoken invitation in that last sentence. I probably could have invited myself over. But I was already home, and a short and quiet evening had its appeal. I told her I\u0027d wanted to say how I\u0027d enjoyed her company and that I\u0027d call her.\n \"I\u0027m glad you called,\" she said. \"You\u0027re a sweet man, Matthew.\" A pause, and then she said, \"I\u0027ve been thinking about it. He probably did it.\"\n \"He?\"\n \"Doug Ettinger. He probably killed her.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why. People always have motives to kill their spouses, don\u0027t they? There was never a day when I didn\u0027t have a reason to kill Eddie.\"\n \"I meant why do you think he did it.\"\n \"Oh. What I was thinking, I was thinking how devious you would have to be to kill someone and imitate another murder. And I realized what a devious man he was, what a sneak. He could plan something like that.\"\n \"That\u0027s interesting.\"\n \"Listen, I don\u0027t have any special knowledge. But it\u0027s what I was thinking earlier. And now he\u0027s doing what? Selling sporting goods? Is that what you said?\"\n I sat in my room and read for a while, then had dinner around the corner at Armstrong\u0027s. I stayed there for a couple of hours but didn\u0027t have very much to drink. The crowd was a light one, as it usually is on a Sunday. I talked to a few people but mostly sat alone and let the events of the past two days thread their way in and out of my consciousness.\n I made it an early night, walked down to Eighth Avenue for the early edition of Monday\u0027s News. Went back to my room, read the paper, took a shower. Looked at myself in the mirror. Thought about shaving, decided to wait until morning.\n Had a nightcap, a short one. Went to bed.\n I was deep in a dream when the phone rang. I was running in the dream, chasing someone or being chased, and I sat up in bed with my heart pounding.\n The phone was ringing. I reached out, answered it.\n A woman said, \"Why don\u0027t you let the dead bury the dead?\"\n \"Who is this?\"\n \"Leave the dead alone. Let the dead stay buried.\"\n \"Who is this?\"\n A click. I turned on a light and looked at my watch. It was around one thirty. I\u0027d been sleeping an hour, if that.\n Who had called me? It was a voice I\u0027d heard before but I couldn\u0027t place it. Lynn London? I didn\u0027t think so.\n I got out of bed, flipped pages in my notebook, picked up the phone again. When the hotel operator came on I read off a number to him. He put the call through and I listened as it rang twice.\n A woman answered it. Same woman who\u0027d just told me to leave the dead alone. I\u0027d heard her voice once before that, and remembered it now.\n I had nothing to say to her that wouldn\u0027t wait a day or two. Without saying anything, I replaced the receiver and went back to bed.\n Chapter 11\n After breakfast the next day I called Charles London\u0027s office. He hadn\u0027t come in yet. I gave my name and said I\u0027d call later.\n I spent another dime calling Frank Fitzroy at the Eighteenth Precinct. \"Scudder,\" I said. \"Where are they holding Pinell?\"\n \"They had him downtown. Then I think they shunted him out to Rikers Island. Why?\"\n \"I\u0027d like to see him. What are my chances?\"\n \"Not good.\"\n \"You could go out there,\" I suggested. \"I could just be a fellow officer along for the ride.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Matt.\"\n \"You\u0027d get something for your time.\"\n \"That\u0027s not it. Believe me. Thing is, this fucker fell in our laps and I\u0027d hate to see him walk on a technicality. We ring in an unauthorized visitor and his lawyer gets wind of it and gets a wild hair up his ass and it could screw up the whole case. You follow me?\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t seem very likely.\"\n \"Maybe not, but it\u0027s a chance I\u0027m in no rush to take. What do you want from him, anyway?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Maybe I could ask him a question or two for you. Assuming I could get to see him, which I\u0027m not sure I could. His lawyer may have cut off the flow. But if you\u0027ve got a specific question-\"\n I was in the phone booth in my hotel lobby and someone was knocking on the door. I told Frank to hang on for a second and opened the door a crack. It was Vinnie, the desk man, to tell me I had a call. I asked who it was and he said it was a woman and she hadn\u0027t given her name. I wondered if it was the same one who\u0027d called last night.\n I told him to switch it to the house phone and I\u0027d take it in a minute. I uncovered the mouthpiece of the phone I was holding and told Frank I couldn\u0027t think of anything in particular that I wanted to ask Louis Pinell, but that I\u0027d keep his offer in mind. He asked if I was getting anyplace with my investigation.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"It\u0027s hard to tell. I\u0027m putting in the hours.\"\n \"Giving what\u0027s-his-name his money\u0027s worth. London.\"\n \"I suppose so. I have a feeling most of it is wasted motion.\"\n \"It\u0027s always that way, isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s days when I figure I must waste ninety percent of my time. But you have to do that to come up with the ten percent that\u0027s not a waste.\"\n \"That\u0027s a point.\"\n \"Even if you could see Pinell, that\u0027d be part of the wasted ninety percent. Don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Probably.\"\n I finished up with him, went over to the desk and picked up the house phone. It was Anita.\n She said, \"Matt? I just wanted to tell you that the check came.\"\n \"That\u0027s good. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s not more.\"\n \"It came at a good time.\"\n I sent money for her and the boys when I had it to send. She never called just to say it had arrived.\n I asked how the boys were.\n \"They\u0027re fine,\" she said. \"Of course they\u0027re in school now.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"I guess it\u0027s been a while since you\u0027ve seen them.\"\n I felt a little red pinprick of anger. Had she called just to tell me that? Just to push a little guilt button? \"I\u0027m on a case,\" I said. \"Soon as it\u0027s finished, whenever that is, maybe they can come in and we\u0027ll catch a game at the Garden. Or a boxing match.\"\n \"They\u0027d like that.\"\n \"So would I.\" I thought of Jan, relieved that her kids were on the other side of the country, relieved she didn\u0027t have to visit them anymore, and guilty over her relief. \"I\u0027d like that very much,\" I said.\n \"Matt, the reason I called-\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"Oh, God,\" she said. She sounded sad and tired. \"It\u0027s Bandy,\" she said.\n \"Bandy?\"\n \"The dog. You remember Bandy.\"\n \"Of course. What about him?\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s sad,\" she said. \"The vet said he ought to be put to sleep. He said there\u0027s really nothing to be done for him at this point.\"\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"Well, I suppose if that\u0027s what has to be done-\"\n \"I already had him put to sleep. On Friday.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"I guess I thought you would want to know.\"\n \"Poor Bandy,\" I said. \"He must have been twelve years old.\"\n \"He was fourteen.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize he was that old. That\u0027s a long life for a dog.\"\n \"It\u0027s supposed to be the equivalent of ninety-eight for a human being.\"\n \"What was the matter with him?\"\n \"The vet said he just wore out. His kidneys were in bad shape. And he was almost blind. You knew that, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"For the past year or two his eyesight was failing. It was so sad, Matt. The boys sort of lost interest in him. I think that was the saddest part. They loved him when they were younger but they grew up and he got old and they lost interest.\" She started to cry. I stood there and held the phone to my ear and didn\u0027t say anything.\n She said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Matt.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be silly.\"\n \"I called you because I wanted to tell somebody and who else could I tell? Do you remember when we got him?\"\n \"I remember.\"\n \"I wanted to call him Bandit because of his facial markings, his mask. You said something about give-a-dog-a-bad-name, but we were already calling him Bandy. So we decided it was short for Bandersnatch.\"\n \"From Alice in Wonderland.\"\n \"The vet said he didn\u0027t feel anything. He just went to sleep. He took care of disposing of the body for me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-15.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: \n A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
