He could always break me up.\"\n She talked for a few more minutes. The conversation just wore out, like the dog. She thanked me again for the check and I said again that I wished it could have been more. I told her to tell the boys I\u0027d be seeing them as soon as I was finished with my current case. She said she\u0027d be sure to tell them. I hung up the phone and went outside.\n The sun was screened by clouds and there was a chill wind blowing. Two doors down from the hotel is a bar called McGovern\u0027s. They open early.\n I went in. The place was empty except for two old men, one behind the bar, one in front of it. The bartender\u0027s hand trembled slightly as he poured me a double shot of Early Times and backed it up with a glass of water.\n I hoisted the glass, wondered at the wisdom of paying an early visit to London\u0027s office with bourbon on my breath, then decided it was a pardonable eccentricity in an unofficial private detective. I thought about poor old Bandy, but of course I wasn\u0027t really thinking about the dog. For me, and probably for Anita, he was one of the few threads that had still linked us. Rather like the marriage, he\u0027d taken his sweet time dying.\n I drank the drink and got out of there.\n LONDON\u0027S office was on the sixteenth floor of a twenty-eight-story building on Pine Street. I shared the elevator with two men in forest-green work clothing. One carried a clipboard, the other a tool kit. Neither spoke, nor did I.\n I felt like a rat in a maze by the time I found London\u0027s office. His name was the first of four lettered on the frosted glass door. Inside, a receptionist with a slight British accent invited me to have a seat, then spoke quietly into a telephone. I looked at a copy of Sports Illustrated until a door opened and Charles London beckoned me into his private office.\n It was a fair-sized room, comfortable without being luxurious. There was a view of the harbor from his window, only partially blocked by surrounding buildings. We stood on either side of his desk, and I sensed something in the air between us. For a moment I regretted that bourbon at McGovern\u0027s, then realized it had nothing to do with the screen that seemed to separate us.\n \"I wish you\u0027d called,\" he said. \"You\u0027d have been able to save a trip down here.\"\n \"I called and they told me you hadn\u0027t come in yet.\"\n \"I got a message that you would call later.\"\n \"I thought I\u0027d save a call.\"\n He nodded. His outfit looked the same as he\u0027d worn to Armstrong\u0027s, except that the tie was different. I\u0027m sure the suit and shirt were different, too. He probably had six identical suits, and two drawers of white shirts.\n He said, \"I\u0027m going to have to ask you to drop the case, Mr. Scudder.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"You seem unsurprised.\"\n \"I picked up the vibration walking in here. Why?\"\n \"My reasons aren\u0027t important.\"\n \"They are to me.\"\n He shrugged. \"I made a mistake,\" he said. \"I sent you on a fool\u0027s errand. It was a waste of money.\"\n \"You already wasted the money. You might as well let me give you something for it. I can\u0027t give it back because I already spent it.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t expecting a refund.\"\n \"And I didn\u0027t come here to ask for any additional money. So what are you saving by telling me to drop the case?\"\n The pale blue eyes blinked twice behind the rimless glasses. He asked me if I wouldn\u0027t sit down. I said I was comfortable standing. He remained standing himself.\n He said, \"I behaved foolishly. Seeking vengeance, retribution. Troubling the waters. Either that man killed her or some other maniac did and there\u0027s probably no way we\u0027ll ever know for sure. I was wrong to set you to work raking up the past and disturbing the present.\"\n \"Is that what I\u0027ve been doing?\"\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"Raking up the past and disturbing the present? Maybe that\u0027s a good definition of my role. When did you decide to call me off?\"\n \"That\u0027s not important.\"\n \"Ettinger got to you, didn\u0027t he? It must have been yesterday. Saturday\u0027s a busy day at the store, they sell a lot of tennis rackets. He probably called you last night, didn\u0027t he?\" When he hesitated I said, \"Go ahead. Tell me it\u0027s not important.\"\n \"It\u0027s not. More to the point, it\u0027s not your business, Mr. Scudder.\"\n \"I got a wake-up call around one thirty last night from the second Mrs. Ettinger. Did she give you a call about the same time?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"She\u0027s got a distinctive voice. I heard it the day before when I called Ettinger at home and she told me he was at the Hicksville store. She called last night to tell me to let the dead stay buried. That seems to be what you want, too.\"\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I want.\"\n I picked a paperweight from the top of his desk. An inch-long brass label identified it as a piece of petrified wood from the Arizona desert.\n \"I can understand what Karen Ettinger\u0027s afraid of. Her husband might turn out to be the killer, and that would really turn her world upside down. You\u0027d think a woman in her position would want to know one way or the other. How comfortable could she be from here on in, living with a man she half-suspects of killing his first wife? But people are funny that way. They can push things out of their minds. Whatever happened was years ago and in Brooklyn. And the wench is dead, right? People move and their lives change, so there\u0027s nothing for her to worry about, is there?\"\n He didn\u0027t say anything. His paperweight had a piece of black felt on its bottom to keep it from scratching his desk. I replaced it, felt-side down.\n I said, \"You wouldn\u0027t be worried about Ettinger\u0027s world, or his wife\u0027s world. What\u0027s it to you if they get hassled a little? Unless Ettinger had a way to put pressure on you, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be all that easy to push around.\"\n \"Mr. Scudder-\"\n \"It\u0027s something else, but what? Not money, not a physical threat. Oh, hell, I know what it is.\"\n He avoided my eyes.\n \"Her reputation. You\u0027re afraid of what I\u0027ll find in the grave with her. Ettinger must have told you she was having an affair. He told me she wasn\u0027t, but I don\u0027t think he\u0027s that deeply committed to the truth. As a matter of fact, it does look as though she was seeing a man. Maybe more than one man. That may go against the grain of your sense of propriety, but it doesn\u0027t weigh too much against the fact that she was murdered. She may have been killed by a lover. She may have been killed by her husband. There are all sorts of possibilities but you don\u0027t want to look at any of them because in the course of it the world might find out that your daughter wasn\u0027t a virgin.\"\n For a moment I thought he was going to lose his temper. Then something went out of his eyes. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to ask you to leave now,\" he said. \"I have some calls to make and I have an appointment scheduled in fifteen minutes.\"\n \"I guess Mondays are busy in insurance. Like Saturdays in sporting goods.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry that you\u0027re embittered. Perhaps later you\u0027ll appreciate my position, but-\"\n \"Oh, I appreciate your position,\" I said. \"Your daughter was killed for no reason by a madman and you adjusted to that reality. Then you had a new reality to adjust to, and that turned out to mean coming to grips with the possibility that someone had a reason to kill her, and that it might be a good reason.\" I shook my head, impatient with myself for talking too much. \"I came here to pick up a picture of your daughter,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t suppose you happened to bring it.\"\n \"Why would you want it?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you the other day?\"\n \"But you\u0027re off the case now,\" he said. He might have been explaining something to a slow child. \"I don\u0027t expect a refund, but I want you to discontinue your investigation.\"\n \"You want to fire me.\"\n \"If you\u0027d prefer to put it that way.\"\n \"But you never hired me in the first place. So how can you fire me?\"\n \"Mr. Scudder-\"\n \"When you open up a can of worms you can\u0027t just decide to stuff the worms back in the can. There are a lot of things set in motion and I want to see where they lead. I\u0027m not going to stop now.\"\n He had an odd look on his face, as though he was a little bit afraid of me. Maybe I\u0027d raised my voice, or looked somehow menacing.\n \"Relax,\" I told him. \"I won\u0027t be disturbing the dead. The dead are beyond disturbance. You had a right to ask me to drop the case and I\u0027ve got the right to tell you to go to hell. I\u0027m a private citizen pursuing an unofficial investigation. I could do it more efficiently if I had your help, but I can get along without it.\"\n \"I wish you\u0027d let it go.\"\n \"And I wish you\u0027d back me up. And wishes aren\u0027t horses, not for either of us. I\u0027m sorry this isn\u0027t turning out the way you wanted it to. I tried to tell you that might be the case. I guess you didn\u0027t want to listen.\"\n ON the way down, the elevator stopped at almost every floor. I went out to the street. It was still overcast, and colder than I remembered it. I walked a block and a half until I found a bar. I had a quick double bourbon and left. A few blocks further along I stopped at another bar and had another drink.\n I found a subway, headed for the uptown platform, then changed my mind and waited for a train bound for Brooklyn. I got out at Jay Street and walked up one street and down another and wound up in Boerum Hill. I stopped at a Pentecostal church on Schermerhorn. The bulletin board was full of notices in Spanish. I sat there for a few minutes, hoping things would sort themselves out in my mind, but it didn\u0027t work. I found my thoughts bouncing back and forth among dead things-a dead dog, a dead marriage, a dead woman in her kitchen, a dead trail.\n A balding man wearing a sleeveless sweater over a maroon shirt asked me something in Spanish. I suppose he wanted to know if he could help me. I got up and left.\n I walked around some more. A curious thing, I thought, was that I felt somehow more committed to the pursuit of Barbara Ettinger\u0027s killer than I had before her father fired me. It was still as hopeless a quest as it had ever been, doubly hopeless now that I wouldn\u0027t even have the cooperation of my client. And yet I seemed to believe what I had said to him about forces having been set in motion. The dead were indeed beyond disturbance, but I had set about disturbing the living and sensed that it would lead somewhere.\n I thought of poor old Bandersnatch, always game to chase a stick or go for a walk. He\u0027d bring one of his toys to you to signal his eagerness to play. If you just stood there he\u0027d drop it at your feet, but if you tried to take it away from him he\u0027d set his jaw and hang on grimly.\n Maybe I\u0027d learned it from him.\n I went to the building on Wyckoff Street. I rang Donald Gilman and Rolfe Waggoner\u0027s bell. They weren\u0027t in. Neither was Judy Fairborn. I walked on past the building where Jan had lived with-what was his name? Edward. Eddie.\n I stopped at a bar and had a drink. Just a straight shot of bourbon, not a double. Just a little something, maintenance drinking against the chill in the air.\n I decided I was going to see Louis Pinell. For one thing, I\u0027d ask him if he used a different icepick each time he killed. The autopsies hadn\u0027t indicated anything one way or the other. Perhaps forensic medicine isn\u0027t that highly developed yet. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-16.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: \n A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
