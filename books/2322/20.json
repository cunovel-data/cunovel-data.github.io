Pinell\u0027s the kind of person you don\u0027t notice. You see guys like him delivering lunches, taking tickets in a movie theater. Slight build, furtive manner, and a face that just won\u0027t stay in your memory.\" \" \u0027The Banality of Evil.\u0027 \" \"What\u0027s that?\" She repeated the phrase. \"It\u0027s the title of an essay about Adolf Eichmann.\" \"I don\u0027t know that Pinell\u0027s evil. He\u0027s crazy. Maybe evil\u0027s a form of insanity. Anyway, you don\u0027t need a psychiatrist\u0027s report to know he\u0027s crazy. It\u0027s right there in his eyes. Speaking of eyes, that\u0027s another thing I wanted to ask him.\" \"What?\" \"If he stabbed them all in both eyes. He said he did. He did that right away, before he went to work turning their bodies into pincushions.\" She shuddered. \"Why?\" \"That was the other thing I wanted to ask him. Why the eyes? It turned out he had a perfectly logical reason. He did it to avoid detection.\" \"I don\u0027t follow you.\" \"He thought a dead person\u0027s eyes would retain the last image they perceived before death. If that were the case you could obtain a picture of the murderer by scanning the victim\u0027s retina. He was just guarding against this possibility by destroying their eyes.\" \"Jesus.\" \"The funny thing is that he\u0027s not the first person to have that theory. During the last century some criminologists believed the same thing Pinell hit on. They just figured it was a matter of time before the necessary technology existed for recovering the image from the retina. And who knows that it won\u0027t be possible someday? A doctor could give you all sorts of reasons why it\u0027ll never be physiologically possible, but look at all the things that would have seemed at least as farfetched a hundred years ago. Or even twenty years ago.\" \"So Pinell\u0027s just a little ahead of his time, is that it?\" She got up, carried my empty glass to the bar. She filled it and poured a glass of vodka for herself. \"I do believe that calls for a drink. \u0027Here\u0027s looking at you, kid.\u0027 That\u0027s as close as I can come to an imitation of Humphrey Bogart. I do better with clay.\" She sat down and said, \"I wasn\u0027t going to drink anything today. Well, what the hell.\" \"I want to go fairly light myself.\" She nodded, her eyes aimed at the glass in her hand. \"I was glad when you called, Matthew. I didn\u0027t think you were going to.\" \"I tried to get you last night. I kept getting a busy signal.\" \"I had the phone off the hook.\" \"I know.\" \"You had them check it? I just wanted to keep the world away last night. When I\u0027m in here with the door locked and the phone off the hook and the shades down, that\u0027s when I\u0027m really safe. Do you know what I mean?\" \"I think so.\" \"See, I didn\u0027t wake up with a clear head Sunday morning. I got drunk Sunday night. And then I got drunk again last night.\" \"Oh.\" \"And then I got up this morning and took a pill to stop the shakes and decided I\u0027d stay away from it for a day or two. Just to get off the roller-coaster, you know?\" \"Sure.\" \"And here I am with a glass in my hand. Isn\u0027t that a surprise?\" \"You should have said something, Jan. I wouldn\u0027t have brought the vodka.\" \"It\u0027s no big deal.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have brought the Scotch, either. I had too much to drink last night myself. We could be together tonight without drinking.\" \"You really think so?\" \"Of course.\" Her large gray eyes looked quite bottomless. She stared sadly at me for a long moment, then brightened. \"Well, it\u0027s too late to test that hypothesis right now, isn\u0027t it? Why don\u0027t we just make the best of what we have?\" We didn\u0027t do all that much drinking. She had enough vodka to catch up with me and then we both coasted. She played some records and we sat together on the couch and listened to them, not talking much. We started making love on the couch and then went into the bedroom to finish the job. We were good together, better than we\u0027d been Saturday night. Novelty is a spice, but when the chemistry is good between lovers, familiarity enhances their lovemaking. I got out of myself some, and felt a little of what she felt. Afterward we went back to the couch and I started talking about the murder of Barbara Ettinger. \"She\u0027s buried so goddamn deep,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not just the amount of time that\u0027s gone by. Nine years is a long time, but there are people who died nine years ago and you could walk through their lives and find everything pretty much as they left it. The same people in the houses next door and everybody leading the same kind of life. \"With Barbara, everybody\u0027s gone through a seachange. You closed the day-care center and left your husband and moved here. Your husband took the kids and beat it to California. I was one of the first cops on the scene, and God knows my life turned upside down since then. There were three cops who investigated the case in Sheepshead Bay, or started to. Two of them are dead and one left the force and his wife and lives in a furnished room and stands guard in a department store.\" \"And Doug Ettinger\u0027s remarried and selling sporting goods.\" I nodded. \"And Lynn London\u0027s been married and divorced, and half the neighbors on Wyckoff Street have moved somewhere or other. It\u0027s as though every wind on earth\u0027s been busy blowing sand on top of her grave. I know Americans lead mobile lives. I read somewhere that every year twenty percent of the country changes its place of residence. Even so, it\u0027s as though every wind on earth\u0027s been busy blowing sand on top of her grave. It\u0027s like digging for Troy.\" \" \u0027Deep with the first dead.\u0027 \" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"I don\u0027t know if I remember it right. Just a second.\" She crossed the room, searched the bookshelves, removed a slim volume and paged through it. \"It\u0027s Dylan Thomas,\" she said, \"and it\u0027s in here somewhere. Where the hell is it? I\u0027m sure it\u0027s in here. Here it is.\" She read: \"Deep with the first dead lies London\u0027s daughter, Robed in the long friends, The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother, Secret by the unmourning water Of the riding Thames. After the first death, there is no other.\" \"London\u0027s daughter,\" I said. \"As in the city of London. But that must be what made me think of it. Deep with the first dead lies Charles London\u0027s daughter.\" \"Read it again.\" She did. \"Except there\u0027s a door there somewhere if I could just find the handle to it. It wasn\u0027t some nut that killed her. It was someone with a reason, someone she knew. Someone who purposely made it look like Pinell\u0027s handiwork. And the killer\u0027s still around. He didn\u0027t die or drop out of sight. He\u0027s still around. I don\u0027t have any grounds to believe that but it\u0027s a feeling I can\u0027t shake.\" \"You think it\u0027s Doug?\" \"If I don\u0027t, I\u0027m the only one who doesn\u0027t. Even his wife thinks he did it. She may not know that\u0027s what she thinks, but why else is she scared of what I\u0027ll find?\" \"But you think it\u0027s somebody else?\" \"I think an awful lot of lives changed radically after her death. Maybe her dying had something to do with those changes. With some of them, anyway.\" \"Doug\u0027s obviously. Whether he killed her or not.\" \"Maybe it affected other lives, too.\" \"Like a stone in a pond? The ripple effect?\" \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know just what happened or how. I told you, it\u0027s a matter of a hunch, a feeling. Nothing concrete that I can point at.\" \"Your cop instincts, is that it?\" I laughed. She asked what was funny. I said, \"It\u0027s not so funny. I\u0027ve had all day to wonder about the validity of my cop instincts.\" \"How do you mean?\" And so I wound up telling her more than I\u0027d planned. About everything from Anita\u0027s phone call to a kid with a gravity knife. Two nights ago I\u0027d found out what a good listener she was, and she was no worse at it this time around. When I was done she said, \"I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re down on yourself. You could have been killed.\" \"If it was really a mugging attempt.\" \"What were you supposed to do, wait until he stuck a knife into you? And why was he carrying a knife in the first place? I don\u0027t know what a gravity knife is, but it doesn\u0027t sound like something you carry around in case you need to cut a piece of string.\" \"He could have been carrying it for protection.\" \"And the roll of money? It sounds to me as though he\u0027s one of those closet cases who pick up gay men and rob them, and sometimes beat them up or kill them while they\u0027re at it to prove how straight they are. And you\u0027re worrying because you gave a kid like that a bloody lip?\" I shook my head. \"I\u0027m worrying because my judgment wasn\u0027t sound.\" \"Because you were drunk.\" \"And didn\u0027t even know it.\" \"Was your judgment off the night you shot the two holdup men? The night that Puerto Rican girl got killed?\" \"You\u0027re a pretty sharp lady, aren\u0027t you?\" \"A fucking genius.\" \"That\u0027s the question, I guess. And the answer is no, it wasn\u0027t. I hadn\u0027t had much to drink and I wasn\u0027t feeling it. But-\" \"But you got echoes just the same.\" \"Right.\" \"And didn\u0027t want to look straight at them, any more than Karen Ettinger wants to look straight at the fact that she thinks her husband might have murdered his first wife.\" \"A very sharp lady.\" \"They don\u0027t come any sharper. Feel better now?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Talking helps. But you kept it so far inside you didn\u0027t even know it was there.\" She yawned. \"Being a sharp lady is tiring work.\" \"I can believe it.\" \"Want to go to bed?\" \"Sure.\" BUT I didn\u0027t stay the night. I thought I might, but I was still awake when her breathing changed to indicate that she was sleeping. I lay first on one side and then on the other, and it was clear I wasn\u0027t ready to sleep. I got out of bed and padded quietly into the other room. I dressed, then stood at the window and looked out at Lispenard Street. There was plenty of Scotch left but I didn\u0027t want to drink any of it. I let myself out. A block away on Canal Street I managed to flag a cab. I got uptown in time to catch the last half-hour or so at Armstrong\u0027s, but I said the hell with it and went straight to my room. I got to sleep eventually. Chapter 14 I had a night of dreams and shallow sleep. The dog, Bandy, turned up in one of the dreams. He wasn\u0027t really dead. His death had been faked as part of some elaborate scam. He told me all this, told me too that he\u0027d always been able to talk but had been afraid to disclose this talent. \"If I\u0027d only known,\" I marveled, \"what conversations we could have had!\" I awoke refreshed and clearheaded and fiercely hungry. I had bacon and eggs and home fries at the Red Flame and read the News. They\u0027d caught the First Avenue Slasher, or at the least had arrested someone they said was the Slasher. A photograph of the suspect bore a startling resemblance to the police artist\u0027s sketch that had run earlier. That doesn\u0027t happen too often. I was on my second cup of coffee when Vinnie slid into the booth across from me. \"Woman in the lobby,\" he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-20.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
