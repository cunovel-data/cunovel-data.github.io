I returned it to my pocket. \"That\u0027s a lousy picture of you,\" she said. \"But I guess it\u0027s you, all right. I don\u0027t think she\u0027d let a stranger into her apartment. She\u0027d let a lover in, though. Or a husband.\" \"You think her husband killed her?\" \"Married people always kill one another. Sometimes it takes them fifty years.\" \"Any idea who her lover may have been?\" \"It may not have been just one person. I\u0027m just guessing, but she could have had an itch to experiment. And she was pregnant so it was safe.\" She laughed. I asked her what was so funny. \"I was trying to think where she would have met someone. A neighbor, maybe, or the male half of some couple she and her husband saw socially. It\u0027s not as though she could have met men on the job. We had plenty of males there, but unfortunately none of them were over eight years old.\" \"Not very promising.\" \"Except that\u0027s not altogether true. Sometimes fathers would bring the kids in, or pick them up after work. There are situations more conducive to flirtation, but I had daddies come on to me while they collected their children, and it probably happened to Barbara. She was very attractive, you know. And she didn\u0027t wrap herself up in an old Mother Hubbard when she came to work at the Happy Hours. She had a good figure and she dressed to show it off.\" The conversation went on a little longer before I got a handle on the question. Then I said, \"Did you and Barbara ever become lovers?\" I was watching her eyes when I asked the question, and they widened in response. \"Jesus Christ,\" she said. I waited her out. \"I\u0027m just wondering where the question came from,\" she said. \"Did somebody say we were lovers? Or am I an obvious dyke or something?\" \"I was told you left your husband for another woman.\" \"Well, that\u0027s close. I left my husband for thirty or forty reasons, I suppose. And the first relationship I had after I left him was with a woman. Who told you? Not Doug Ettinger. He\u0027d moved out of the neighborhood before that particular shit hit the fan. Unless he happened to talk to somebody. Maybe he and Eddie got together and cried on each other\u0027s shoulder about how women are no good, they either get stabbed or they run off with each other. Was it Doug?\" \"No. It was a woman who lived in your building on Wyckoff Street.\" \"Someone in the building. Oh, it must have been Maisie! Except that\u0027s not her name. Give me a minute. Mitzi! It was Mitzi Pomerance, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"I didn\u0027t get her first name. I just spoke with her on the telephone.\" \"Little Mitzi Pomerance. Are they still married? Of course, they\u0027d have to be. Unless he left, but nothing would propel her away from hearth and home. She\u0027d insist her marriage was heaven even if it meant systematically denying every negative emotion that ever threatened to come to the surface. The worst thing about going back to visit the kids was the look on that twit\u0027s face when we passed on the stairs.\" She sighed and shook her head at the memory. \"I never had anything going with Barbara. Strangely enough, I never had anything going with anybody, male or female, before I split with Eddie. And the woman I got together with afterward was the first woman I ever slept with in my life.\" \"But you were attracted to Barbara Ettinger.\" \"Was I? I recognized that she was attractive. That\u0027s not the same thing. Was I specifically attracted to her?\" She weighed the notion. \"Maybe,\" she conceded. \"Not on any conscious level, I don\u0027t think. And when I did begin to consider the possibility that I might find it, oh, interesting to go to bed with a woman, I don\u0027t think I had any particular woman in mind. As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t even think I entertained the fantasy while Barbara was alive.\" \"I have to ask these personal questions.\" \"You don\u0027t have to apologize. Jesus, Mitzi Pomerance. I\u0027ll bet she\u0027s fat, I\u0027ll bet she\u0027s a plump little piglet by now. But you only spoke to her over the phone.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Is she still living in the same place? She must be. You wouldn\u0027t get them out of there with a crowbar.\" \"Somebody did. A buyer converted the house to one-family.\" \"They must have been sick. Did they stay in the neighborhood?\" \"More or less. They moved to Carroll Street.\" \"Well, I hope they\u0027re happy. Mitzi and Gordon.\" She leaned forward, searched my face with her gray eyes. \"You drink,\" she said. \"Right?\" \"Pardon?\" \"You\u0027re a drunk, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I suppose you could call me a drinking man.\" The words sounded stiff, even to me. They hung in the air for a moment and then her laughter cut in, full-bodied and rich. \" \u0027I suppose you could call me a drinking man.\u0027 Jesus, that\u0027s wonderful. Well, I suppose you could call me a drinking woman, Mr. Scudder. People have called me a good deal worse, and it\u0027s been a long day and a dry one. How about a little something to cut the dust?\" \"That\u0027s not a bad idea.\" \"What\u0027ll it be?\" \"Do you have bourbon?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" The bar was behind a pair of sliding doors in one of the bookcases. \"Scotch or vodka,\" she announced. \"Scotch.\" \"Rocks? Water? What?\" \"Just straight.\" \"The way God made it, huh?\" She brought back a pair of rocks glasses filled about halfway, one with Scotch, the other with vodka. She gave me mine, looked into her own. She had the air of someone trying to select a toast, but evidently she couldn\u0027t think of one. \"Oh, what the hell,\" she said, and took a drink. \"WHO do you think killed her?\" \"Too early to tell. It could have been somebody I haven\u0027t heard of yet. Or it could have been Pinell. I\u0027d like ten minutes with him.\" \"You think you could refresh his memory?\" I shook my head. \"I think I might get some sense of him. So much detection is intuitive. You gather details and soak up impressions, and then the answer pops into your mind out of nowhere. It\u0027s not like Sherlock Holmes, at least it never was for me.\" \"You make it sound almost as though there\u0027s a psychic element to the process.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t read palms or see the future. But maybe there is.\" I sipped Scotch. It had that medicinal taste that Scotch has but I didn\u0027t mind it as much as I usually do. It was one of the heavier Scotches, dark and peaty. Teacher\u0027s, I think it was. \"I want to get out to Sheepshead Bay next,\" I said. \"Now?\" \"Tomorrow. That\u0027s where the fourth Icepick killing took place, and that was the one that\u0027s supposed to have spooked Barbara Ettinger.\" \"You think the same person-\" \"Louis Pinell admits to the Sheepshead Bay murder. Of course that doesn\u0027t prove anything, either. I\u0027m not sure why I want to go out there. I guess I want to talk to somebody who was on the scene, someone who saw the body. There were some physical details about the killings that were held back from the press coverage, and they were duplicated in Barbara\u0027s murder. Imperfectly duplicated, and I want to know if there was any parallel in the other Brooklyn homicide.\" \"And if there was, what would it prove? That there was a second killer, a maniac who confined himself to Brooklyn?\" \"And who conveniently stopped at two killings. It\u0027s possible. It wouldn\u0027t even rule out someone with a motive for killing Barbara. Say her husband decided to kill her, but he realized the Icepick Prowler hadn\u0027t been to Brooklyn yet, so he killed some stranger in Sheepshead Bay first to establish a pattern.\" \"Do people do things like that?\" \"There\u0027s nothing you can imagine that somebody hasn\u0027t done at one time or another. Maybe somebody had a motive for killing the woman in Sheepshead Bay. Then he was worried that the murder would stand out as the only one of its kind in Brooklyn, so he went after Barbara. Or maybe that was just his excuse. Maybe he killed a second time because he\u0027d found out that he enjoyed it.\" \"God.\" She drank vodka. \"What was the physical detail?\" \"You don\u0027t want to know about it.\" \"You protecting the little woman from the awful truth?\" \"The victims were stabbed through the eyes. An icepick, right through the eyeballs.\" \"Jesus. And theâ€¦ what did you call it? Imperfect duplication?\" \"Barbara Ettinger just got it in one eye.\" \"Like a wink.\" She sat for a long moment, then looked down at her glass and noticed that it was empty. She went to the bar and came back with both bottles. After she\u0027d filled our glasses she left the bottles on the slate-topped table. \"I wonder why he would do a thing like that,\" she said. \"That\u0027s another reason I\u0027d like to see Pinell,\" I said. \"To ask him.\" THE conversation turned this way and that. At one point she asked whether she should call me Matt or Matthew. I told her it didn\u0027t matter to me. She said it mattered to her that I call her not Janice but Jan. \"Unless you\u0027re uncomfortable calling murder suspects by their first names.\" When I was a cop I learned always to call suspects by their first names. It gave you a certain amount of psychological leverage. I told her she wasn\u0027t a suspect. \"I was at the Happy Hours all that afternoon,\" she said. \"Of course it would be hard to prove after all these years. At the time it would have been easy. Alibis must be harder to come by for people who live alone.\" \"You live alone here?\" \"Unless you count the cats. They\u0027re hiding somewhere. They steer clear of strangers. Showing them your ID wouldn\u0027t impress them much.\" \"Real hard-liners.\" \"Uh-huh. I\u0027ve always lived alone. Since I left Eddie, that is. I\u0027ve been in relationships but I always lived alone.\" \"Unless we count the cats.\" \"Unless we count the cats. I never thought at the time that I\u0027d be living by myself for the next eight years. I thought a relationship with a woman might be different in some fundamental way. See, back then was consciousness-raising time. I decided the problem was men.\" \"And it wasn\u0027t?\" \"Well, it may have been one of the problems. Women turned out to be another problem. For a while I decided I was one of those fortunate people who are capable of relationships with both sexes.\" \"Just for a while?\" \"Uh-huh. Because what I discovered next was that I may be capable of relationships with men and women, but what I mostly am is not very good at relationships.\" \"Well, I can relate to that.\" \"I figured you probably could. You live alone, don\u0027t you, Matthew?\" \"For a while now.\" \"Your sons are with your wife? I\u0027m not psychic. There\u0027s a picture of them in your wallet.\" \"Oh, that. It\u0027s an old picture.\" \"They\u0027re handsome boys.\" \"They\u0027re good kids, too.\" I added a little Scotch to my glass. \"They live out in Syosset. They\u0027ll take the train in now and then and we catch a ball game together, or maybe a fight at the Garden.\" \"They must enjoy that.\" \"I know I enjoy it.\" \"You must have moved out a while ago.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-11.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
