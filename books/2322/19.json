Again between ourselves, I think lawyers with that attitude ought to be in jail alongside their clients. But in the meantime here I am, playing God. What do you want to ask Lou?\"\\n\\n \"There was another Brooklyn killing. I might ask him a few questions about that.\"\\n\\n \"Sheepshead Bay. He copped to that one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I don\u0027t know what else I\u0027ll ask him. I\u0027m probably wasting my time. And yours.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n Thirty or forty minutes later we were driving back to the mainland and I was apologizing again for wasting his time.\\n\\n \"You did me a favor,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going to have to make another dentist\u0027s appointment. You ever have periodontal surgery?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a wise man. This guy\u0027s my wife\u0027s cousin and he\u0027s pretty good, but what they do is they carve your gums. They do a section of your mouth at a time. Last time I went I wound up taking codeine every four hours for a week. I walked around in this perpetual fog. I suppose it\u0027s worth it in the long run, but don\u0027t feel you took me away from something enjoyable.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so.\"\\n\\n I told him he could drop me anywhere but he insisted on giving me a lift to the subway stop at Northern Boulevard. On the way we talked a little about Pinell. \"You can see why they picked him up on the street,\" he said. \"That craziness is right there in his eyes. One look and you see it.\"\\n\\n \"There are a lot of street crazies.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s dangerous-crazy and it shows. And yet I\u0027m never nervous in his presence. Well, I\u0027m not a woman and he hasn\u0027t got an icepick. That might have something to do with it.\"\\n\\n At the subway entrance I got out of the car and hesitated for a moment, and he leaned toward me, one arm over the back of the seat. We both seemed reluctant to take leave of each other. I liked him and sensed that he held me in similar regard.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not licensed,\" he said. \"Isn\u0027t that what you said?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you get a license?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want one.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe I could throw some work your way all the same, if the right sort of thing came along.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you want to?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I liked your manner with Lou. And I get the feeling with you that you think the truth is important.\" He chuckled. \"Besides, I owe you. You spared me a half-hour in the dentist\u0027s chair.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if I ever need a lawyer-\"\\n\\n \"Right. You know who to call.\"\\n\\n I just missed a Manhattan-bound train. While I waited for the next one on the elevated platform I managed to find a phone in working order and tried Lynn London\u0027s number. I\u0027d checked the hotel desk before I called Hiller, and there\u0027d been a message from her the night before, probably wondering why I hadn\u0027t shown up. I wondered if she\u0027d been the one who called during my shower. Whoever it was hadn\u0027t elected to leave a message. The desk man said the caller had been a woman, but I\u0027d learned not to count too heavily on his powers of recollection.\\n\\n Lynn\u0027s number didn\u0027t answer. No surprise. She was probably still in school, or on her way home. Had she mentioned any afternoon plans? I couldn\u0027t remember.\\n\\n I retrieved my dime, started to put it and my notebook away. Was there anyone else I should call? I flipped pages in my notebook, struck by how many names and numbers and addresses I\u0027d written down, considering how little I\u0027d managed to accomplish.\\n\\n Karen Ettinger? I could ask her what she was afraid of. Hiller had just told me he sensed that I thought the truth was important. Evidently she thought it was worth hiding.\\n\\n It\u0027d be a toll call, though. And I didn\u0027t have much change.\\n\\n Charles London? Frank Fitzroy? An ex-cop on the Upper West Side? His ex-wife on the Lower East Side?\\n\\n Mitzi Pomerance? Jan Keane?\\n\\n Probably still had the phone off the hook.\\n\\n I put the notebook away, and the dime. I could have used a drink. I\u0027d had nothing since that one eye-opener at McGovern\u0027s. I\u0027d eaten a late breakfast since then, had drunk several cups of coffee, but that was it.\\n\\n I looked over the low wall at the rear of the platform. My eye fastened on red neon in a tavern window. I\u0027d just missed a train. I could have a quick one and be back in plenty of time for the next one.\\n\\n I sat down on a bench and waited for my train.\\n\\n I changed trains twice and wound up at Columbus Circle. The sky was darkening by the time I hit the street, turning that particular cobalt blue that it gets over New York. There were no messages waiting for me at my hotel. I called Lynn London from the lobby.\\n\\n This time I reached her. \"The elusive Mr. Scudder,\" she said. \"You stood me up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I waited for you yesterday afternoon. Not for long, because I didn\u0027t have too much time available. I suppose something came up, but you didn\u0027t call, either.\"\\n\\n I remembered how I had considered keeping the appointment and how I\u0027d decided against it. Alcohol had made the decision for me. I\u0027d been in a warm bar and it was cold outside.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d just spoken to your father,\" I said. \"He asked me to drop the case. I figured he\u0027d have been in touch with you to tell you not to cooperate with me.\"\\n\\n \"So you just decided to write off the Londons, is that it?\" There was a trace of amusement in her voice. \"I was here waiting, as I said. Then I went out and kept my date for the evening, and when I got home my father called. To tell me he\u0027d ordered you off the case but that you intended to persist with it all the same.\"\\n\\n So I could have seen her. Alcohol had made the decision, and had made it badly.\\n\\n \"He told me not to offer you any encouragement. He said he\u0027d made a mistake raking up the past to begin with.\"\\n\\n \"But you called me. Or was that before you spoke to him?\"\\n\\n \"Once before and once after. The first call was because I was angry with you for standing me up. The second call was because I was angry with my father.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I don\u0027t like being told what to do. I\u0027m funny that way. He says you wanted a picture of Barbara. I gather he refused to give it to you. Do you still want one?\"\\n\\n Did I? I couldn\u0027t recall now what I\u0027d planned to do with it. Maybe I\u0027d make the rounds of hardware stores, showing it to everyone who sold icepicks.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"I still want one.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I can supply that much. I don\u0027t know what else I can give you. But one thing I can\u0027t give you at the moment is time. I was on my way out the door when the phone rang. I\u0027ve got my coat on. I\u0027m meeting a friend for dinner, and then I\u0027m going to be busy this evening.\"\\n\\n \"With group therapy.\"\\n\\n \"How did you know that? Did I mention it the last time we talked? You have a good memory.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Just let me think. Tomorrow night\u0027s also impossible. I\u0027d say come over tonight after therapy but by then I generally feel as though I\u0027ve been through the wringer. After school tomorrow there\u0027s a faculty meeting, and by the time that\u0027s over- Look, could you come to the school?\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a free period from one to two. Do you know where I teach?\"\\n\\n \"A private school in the Village, but I don\u0027t know which one.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the Devonhurst School. Sounds very preppy, doesn\u0027t it? Actually it\u0027s anything but. And it\u0027s in the East Village. Second Avenue between Tenth and Eleventh. The east side of the street closer to Eleventh than Tenth.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll find it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be in Room Forty-one. And Mr. Scudder? I wouldn\u0027t want to be stood up a second time.\"\\n\\n I went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s. I had a hamburger and a small salad, then some bourbon in coffee. They switch bartenders at eight, and when Billie came in a half-hour before his shift started I went over to him.\\n\\n \"I guess I was pretty bad last night,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh, you were okay,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It was a long day and night.\"\\n\\n \"You were talking a little loud,\" he said. \"Aside from that you were your usual self. And you knew to leave here and make it an early night.\"\\n\\n Except I hadn\u0027t made it an early night.\\n\\n I went back to my table and had another bourbon and coffee. By the time I was finished with it, the last of my hangover was gone. I\u0027d shaken off the headache fairly early on, but the feeling of being a step or two off the pace had persisted throughout the day.\\n\\n Great system: The poison and the antidote come in the same bottle.\\n\\n I went to the phone, dropped a dime. I almost dialed Anita\u0027s number and sat there wondering why. I didn\u0027t want to talk about a dead dog, and that was as close as we\u0027d come to a meaningful conversation in years.\\n\\n I dialed Jan\u0027s number. My notebook was in my pocket but I didn\u0027t have to get it out. The number was just right there at hand.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Matthew,\" I said. \"I wondered if you felt like company.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"Unless you\u0027re busy.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. As a matter of fact, I\u0027m a little under the weather. I was just settling in for a quiet evening in front of the television set.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you\u0027d rather be alone-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" There was a pause. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to make it a late evening.\"\\n\\n \"Neither would I.\"\\n\\n \"You remember how to get here?\"\\n\\n \"I remember.\"\\n\\n On the way there I felt like a kid on a date. I rang her bell according to the code and stood at the curb. She tossed me the key. I went inside and rode up in the big elevator.\\n\\n She was wearing a skirt and sweater and had doeskin slippers on her feet. We stood looking at each other for a moment and then I handed her the paper bag I was carrying. She took out the two bottles, one of Teacher\u0027s Scotch, the other of the brand of Russian vodka she favored.\\n\\n \"The perfect hostess gift,\" she said. \"I thought you were a bourbon drinker.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s a funny thing. I had a clear head the other morning, and it occurred to me that Scotch might be less likely to give me a hangover.\"\\n\\n She put the bottles down. \"I wasn\u0027t going to drink tonight,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027ll keep. Vodka doesn\u0027t go bad.\"\\n\\n \"Not if you don\u0027t drink it. Let me fix you something. Straight, right?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n It was stilted at first. We\u0027d been close to one another, we\u0027d spent a night in bed together, but we were nevertheless stiff and awkward with each other. I started talking about the case, partly because I wanted to talk to someone about it, partly because it was what we had in common. I told her how my client had tried to take me off the case and how I was staying with it anyway. She didn\u0027t seem to find this unusual.\\n\\n Then I talked about Pinell.\\n\\n \"He definitely didn\u0027t kill Barbara Ettinger,\" I said, \"and he definitely did commit the icepick murder in Sheepshead Bay. I didn\u0027t really have much doubt about either of those points but I wanted to have my own impressions to work with. And I just plain wanted to see him. I wanted some sense of the man.\"\\n\\n \"What was he like?\"\\n\\n \"Ordinary. They\u0027re always ordinary, aren\u0027t they? Except I don\u0027t know that that\u0027s the right word for it. The thing about Pinell is that he looked insignificant.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-19.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \\n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
