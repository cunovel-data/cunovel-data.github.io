{"id":62768,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I was done with the file when Frank Fitzroy got back. He said, \"Well? Get anything?\"\\n\\n \"Not a whole lot. I made a few notes. Mostly names and addresses.\"\\n\\n \"They may not match up after nine years. People move. Their whole fucking lives change.\"\\n\\n God knows mine did. Nine years ago I was a detective on the NYPD. I lived on Long Island in a house with a lawn and a backyard and a barbecue grill and a wife and two sons. I had moved, all right, though it was sometimes difficult to determine the direction. Surely my life had changed.\\n\\n I tapped the file folder. \"Pinell,\" I said. \"How sure is it he didn\u0027t kill Barbara Ettinger?\"\\n\\n \"Gilt-edged, Matt. Bottled in bond. He was in Bellevue at the time.\"\\n\\n \"People have been known to slip in and out.\"\\n\\n \"Granted, but he was in a straitjacket. That hampers your movement a little. Besides, there\u0027s things that set the Ettinger killing apart from the others. You only notice them if you look for them, but they\u0027re there.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Number of wounds. Ettinger had the lowest number of wounds of all eight victims. The difference isn\u0027t major but maybe it\u0027s enough to be significant. Plus all the other victims had wounds in the thighs. Ettinger had nothing in the thighs or legs, no punctures. Thing is, there was a certain amount of variation among the other victims. He didn\u0027t stamp out these murders with a cookie cutter. So the discrepancies with Ettinger didn\u0027t stand out at the time. The fewer wounds and the no wounds in the thighs, you can look at it that he was rushed, he heard somebody or thought he heard somebody and he didn\u0027t have time to give her the full treatment.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"The thing that made it so obvious that it was the Icepick guy who cooled her, well, you know what that was.\"\\n\\n \"The eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" He nodded approval. \"All of the victims were stabbed through the eyes. One shot through each eyeball. That never made the papers. We held it back the way you always try and hold one or two things back to keep the psychos from fooling you with false confessions. You wouldn\u0027t believe how many clowns already turned themselves in for the slashings down the street.\"\\n\\n \"I can imagine.\"\\n\\n \"And you have to check \u0027em all out, and then you have to write up each interrogation, and that\u0027s the real pain in the ass. Anyway, getting back to Ettinger. The Icepick guy always went for the eyes. We kept the wraps on that detail, and Ettinger got it in the eye, so what are you going to figure? Who\u0027s gonna give a shit if she got it in the thighs or not when you\u0027ve got an eyeball puncture to run with?\"\\n\\n \"But it was only one eye.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Okay, that\u0027s a discrepancy, but it lines up with the fewer punctures and the no wounds in the thighs. He\u0027s in a hurry. No time to do it right. Wouldn\u0027t you figure it that way?\"\\n\\n \"Anybody would.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. You want some more coffee?\"\\n\\n \"No thanks.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027ll pass myself. I\u0027ve had too much already today.\"\\n\\n \"How do you figure it now, Frank?\"\\n\\n \"Ettinger? What do I figure happened?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n He scratched his head. Vertical frown lines creased his forehead on either side of his nose. \"I don\u0027t think it was anything complicated,\" he said. \"I think somebody read the papers and watched television and got turned on by the stories about the Icepick guy. You get these imitators every now and then. They\u0027re psychos without the imagination to think up their own numbers so they hitch a ride on somebody else\u0027s craziness. Some loony watched the six o\u0027clock news and went out and bought an icepick.\"\\n\\n \"And happened to get her in the eye by chance?\"\\n\\n \"Possible. Could be. Or it could be it just struck him as a good idea, same as it did Pinell. Or something leaked.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I was thinking.\"\\n\\n \"Far as I can remember, there was nothing in the papers or on the news. Nothing about the eye wounds, I mean. But maybe there was and then we squelched it but not before this psycho read it or heard it and it made an impression. Or maybe it never got into the media but the word was around. You got a few hundred cops who know something, plus everybody who\u0027s around for the postmortems, plus everybody who sees the records, all the clerks and all, and each of them tells three people and those people all talk, and how long does it take before a lot of people know about it?\"\\n\\n \"I see what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"If anything, the business with the eyes makes it look like it was just a psycho. A guy who tried it once for a thrill and then let it go.\"\\n\\n \"How do you figure that, Frank?\"\\n\\n He leaned back, interlaced his fingers behind his head. \"Well, say it\u0027s the husband,\" he said. \"Say he wants to kill her because she\u0027s fucking the mailman, and he wants to make it look like the Icepick Prowler so he won\u0027t carry the can for it himself. If he knows about the eyes, he\u0027s gonna do both of them, right? He\u0027s not taking any chances. A nut, he\u0027s something else again. He does one eye because it\u0027s something to do, and then maybe he\u0027s bored with it so he doesn\u0027t do the other one. Who knows what goes through their fucking heads?\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s a psycho, then there\u0027s no way to tag him.\"\\n\\n \"Of course there isn\u0027t. Nine years later and you\u0027re looking for a killer without a motive? That\u0027s a needle in a haystack when the needle\u0027s not even there. But that\u0027s all right. You take this and play with it, and after you\u0027ve run the string you just tell London it must have been a psycho. Believe me, he\u0027ll be happy to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because that\u0027s what he thought nine years ago, and he got used to the idea. He accepted it. Now he\u0027s afraid it\u0027s somebody he knows and that\u0027s driving him crazy, so you\u0027ll investigate it all for him and tell him everything\u0027s okay, the sun still comes up in the east every morning and his daughter was still killed by a fucking Act of God. He can relax again and go back to his life. He\u0027ll get his money\u0027s worth.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re probably right.\"\\n\\n \"Course I\u0027m right. You could even save yourself running around and just sit on your ass for a week and then tell him what you\u0027ll wind up telling him anyway. But I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ll do that, will you?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ll give it my best shot.\"\\n\\n \"I figured you\u0027d at least go through the motions. What it is, you\u0027re still a cop, aren\u0027t you, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so. In a way. Whatever that means.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have anything steady, huh? You just catch a piece of work like this when it comes along?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"You ever think about coming back?\"\\n\\n \"To the department? Not very often. And never very seriously.\"\\n\\n He hesitated. There were questions he wanted to ask, things he wanted to say to me, but he decided to leave them unsaid. I was grateful for that. He got to his feet and so did I. I thanked him for the time and the information and he said an old friend was an old friend and it was a pleasure to be able to help a pal out. Neither of us mentioned the hundred dollars that had changed hands. Why should we? He\u0027d been glad to get it and I was glad to give it. A favor\u0027s no good unless you pay for it. One way or the other, you always do.\\n\\n Chapter 3\\n\\n It had rained a little while I was with Fitzroy. It wasn\u0027t raining when I got back outside, but it didn\u0027t feel as though it was through for the day. I had a drink around the corner on Third Avenue and watched part of the newscast. They showed the police artist\u0027s sketch of the Slasher, the same drawing that was on the front page of the Post. It showed a round-faced black man with a trimmed beard and a cap on his head. Mad zeal glinted in his large almond-shaped eyes.\\n\\n \"Imagine that comin\u0027 up the street at you,\" the bartender said. \"I\u0027ll tell you, there\u0027s a lot of guys gettin\u0027 pistol permits on the strength of this one. I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 about fillin\u0027 out an application myself.\"\\n\\n I remember the day I stopped carrying a gun. It was the same day I turned in my shield. I\u0027d had a stretch of feeling terribly vulnerable without that iron on my hip, and now I could hardly recall how it had felt to walk around armed in the first place.\\n\\n I finished my drink and left. Would the bartender get a gun? Probably not. More people talked about it than did it. But whenever there\u0027s the right kind of nut making headlines, a Slasher or an Icepick Prowler, a certain number of people get pistol permits and a certain number of others buy illegal guns. Then some of them get drunk and shoot their wives. None of them ever seems to wind up nailing the Slasher.\\n\\n I walked uptown, stopped at an Italian place along the way for dinner, then spent a couple of hours at the main library on Forty-second Street, dividing my time between old newspapers on microfilm and new and old Polk city directories. I made some notes, but not many. I was mostly trying to let myself sink into the case, to take a few steps backward in time.\\n\\n By the time I got out of there it was raining. I took a cab to Armstrong\u0027s, got a stool at the bar and settled in. There were people to talk to and bourbon to drink, with enough coffee to keep fatigue at bay. I didn\u0027t hit it very hard, just coasted along, getting by, getting through. You\u0027d be surprised what a person can get through.\\n\\n THE next day was Friday. I read a paper with breakfast. There\u0027d been no slashings the previous night, but neither had there been any progress in the case. In Ecuador, a few hundred people had died in an earthquake. There seemed to be more of those lately, or I was more aware of them.\\n\\n I went to my bank, put Charles London\u0027s check in my savings account, drew out some cash and a money order for five hundred dollars. They gave me an envelope to go with the money order and I addressed it to Ms. Anita Scudder in Syosset. I stood at the counter for a few minutes with the bank\u0027s pen in my hand, trying to think of a note to include, and wound up sending the money order all by itself. After I\u0027d mailed it I thought about calling to tell her it was in the mail, but that seemed like even more of a chore than thinking of something to put in a note.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t a bad day. Clouds obscured the sun, but there were patches of blue overhead and the air had a tang to it. I stopped at Armstrong\u0027s to cover my marker and left without having anything. It was a little early for the day\u0027s first drink. I left, walked east a long block to Columbus Circle, and caught a train.\\n\\n I rode the D to Smith and Bergen and came out into sunshine. For a while I walked around, trying to get my bearings. The Seventy-eighth Precinct, where I\u0027d served a brief hitch, was only six or seven blocks to the east, but that had been a long time ago and I\u0027d spent little time in Brooklyn since. Nothing looked even faintly familiar. I was in a part of the borough that hadn\u0027t had a name until fairly recently. Now a part of it was called Cobble Hill and another chunk was called Boerum Hill and both of them were participating wholeheartedly in the brownstone renaissance. Neighborhoods don\u0027t seem to stand still in New York. They either improve or deteriorate. Most of the city seemed to be crumbling. The whole South Bronx was block after block of burned-out buildings, and in Brooklyn the same process was eroding Bushwick and Brownsville.\\n\\n These blocks were going in the other direction. I walked up one street and down another and found myself becoming aware of changes. There were trees on every block, most of them planted within the past few years. While some of the brownstones and brickfronts were in disrepair, more sported freshly painted trim. The shops reflected the changes that had been going on. A health food store on Smith Street, a boutique at the corner of Warren and Bond, little up-scale restaurants tucked in all over the place. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-3.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \\n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
