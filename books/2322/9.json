{"id":62774,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Mrs. Pomerance answered the phone. I gave my name and said I was trying to reach the Corwins. She knew at once who I was talking about but had no idea how I could reach them.\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t keep in touch. He was a nice fellow, Eddie, and he used to bring the children over for dinner after she moved out, but then when he moved we lost contact. It\u0027s been so many years. I\u0027m sure we had his address at one point but I can\u0027t even remember the city he moved to. It was in California, I think Southern California.\"\\n\\n \"But she moved out first?\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t know that? She left him, left him flat with the two kids. She closed the whatchamacallit, the day-care center, and the next thing you know he\u0027s got to find a day-care center for his own children. I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t imagine a mother walking out on her own children.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know where she might have gone?\"\\n\\n \"Greenwich Village, I suppose. To pursue her art. Among other things.\"\\n\\n \"Her art?\"\\n\\n \"She fancied herself a sculptor. I never saw her work so for all I know she may have had some talent. I\u0027d be surprised if she did, though. There was a woman who had everything. A nice apartment, a husband who was an awfully sweet guy, two beautiful children, and she even had a business that wasn\u0027t doing too badly. And she walked away from it, turned her back and walked away.\"\\n\\n I tried a long shot. \"Did you happen to know a friend of hers named Barbara Ettinger?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know her that well. What was that name? Ettinger? Why is that name familiar to me?\"\\n\\n \"A Barbara Ettinger was murdered down the block from where you lived.\"\\n\\n \"Just before we moved in. Of course. I remember now. I never knew her, naturally, because as I said it was just before we moved in. She was a friend of the Corwins?\"\\n\\n \"She worked for Mrs. Corwin.\"\\n\\n \"Were they that way?\"\\n\\n \"What way?\"\\n\\n \"There was a lot of talk about the murder. It made me nervous about moving in. My husband and I told each other we didn\u0027t have to worry about lightning striking twice in the same place, but privately I was still worried. Then those killings just stopped, didn\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. You never knew the Ettingers?\"\\n\\n \"No, I told you.\"\\n\\n An artist in Greenwich Village. A sculptor. Of the J. Corwins I\u0027d been unable to reach, had any lived in the Village? I didn\u0027t think so.\\n\\n I said, \"Would you happen to remember Mrs. Corwin\u0027s maiden name?\"\\n\\n \"Remember it? I don\u0027t think I ever knew it in the first place. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking she might have resumed it if she\u0027s pursuing an artistic career.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure she did. Artistic career or not, she\u0027d want her own name back. But I couldn\u0027t tell you what it was.\"\\n\\n \"Of course she could have remarried by now-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t count on it.\"\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think she remarried,\" Mrs. Pomerance said. There was a sharpness to her tone and I wondered at it. I asked her what made her say that.\\n\\n \"Put it this way,\" she said. \"Sculpture or no sculpture, she\u0027d probably live in Greenwich Village.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t?\" She clicked her tongue, impatient with my obtuseness. \"She left her husband-and two children-but not to run off with another man. She left him for another woman.\"\\n\\n JANICE Corwin\u0027s maiden name was Keane. It took a subway ride to Chambers Street and a couple of hours in various offices of the Department of Records and Information Services to supply this kernel of information. Most of the time was spent getting clearance. I kept needing the permission of someone who didn\u0027t come in on Saturdays.\\n\\n I tried marriage licenses first, and when that failed to pan out I had a shot at birth certificates. Mrs. Pomerance had been a little hazy on the names and ages of the Corwin children, but she was pretty sure the youngest\u0027s name was Kelly and that she\u0027d been five or six when her mother left. She\u0027d been seven, it turned out; she\u0027d be around fifteen now. Her father was Edward Francis Corwin, her mother the former Janice Elizabeth Keane.\\n\\n I wrote the name in my notebook with a sense of triumph. Not that there was much likelihood that it would slip my mind, but as a symbol of accomplishment. I couldn\u0027t prove that I was an inch closer to Barbara Ettinger\u0027s killer than I\u0027d been when Charles London sat down across from me at Armstrong\u0027s, but I\u0027d done some detecting and it felt good. It was plodding work, generally pointless work, but it let me use muscles I didn\u0027t get to use all that often and they tingled from the exertion.\\n\\n A couple of blocks from there I found a Blarney Stone with a steam table. I had a hot pastrami sandwich and drank a beer or two with it. There was a big color set mounted over the bar. It was tuned to one of those sports anthology shows they have on Saturday afternoons. A couple of guys were doing something with logs in a fast-moving stream. Riding them, I think. Nobody in the place was paying much attention to their efforts. By the time I was done with my sandwich the log-riders were through and a stock-car race had replaced them. Nobody paid any attention to the stock cars, either.\\n\\n I called Lynn London again. This time when her machine picked up I waited for the beep and left my name and number. Then I checked the phone book.\\n\\n No Janice Keanes in Manhattan. Half a dozen Keanes with the initial J. Plenty of other variations of the name-Keene, Keen, Kean. I thought of that old radio show, Mr. Keene, Tracer of Lost Persons. I couldn\u0027t remember how he spelled it.\\n\\n I tried all the J. Keanes. I got two that failed to answer, one persistent busy signal, and three people who denied knowing a Janice Keane. The busy signal lived on East Seventy-third Street and I decided that was no address for a lesbian sculptor from Boerum Hill. I dialed Directory Assistance, all set to go through my routine again for the other four boroughs, but something stopped me.\\n\\n She was in Manhattan. Damn it, I knew she was in Manhattan.\\n\\n I asked for a Janice Keane in Manhattan, spelled the last name, waited a minute, and was told the only listing in Manhattan under that name and with that spelling was unpublished. I hung up, called back again to get a different operator, and went through the little ritual that a cop uses to obtain an unlisted number. I identified myself as Detective Francis Fitzroy, of the Eighteenth Precinct. I called it the One-Eight Precinct because, although cops don\u0027t invariably talk that way, civilians invariably think they do.\\n\\n I got the address while I was at it. She was on Lispenard Street, and that was a perfectly logical place for a sculptor to be living, and not too long a walk from where I was.\\n\\n I had another dime in my hand. I put it back in my pocket and went back to the bar. The stock cars had given way to the feature of the program, a couple of black junior-middleweights topping a fight card in some unlikely place. Phoenix, I think it was. I don\u0027t know what a junior-middleweight is. They\u0027ve added all these intermediate weight classes so that they can have more championship fights. Some of the patrons who\u0027d passed up the log-rollers and the stock cars were watching these two boys hit each other, which was something they weren\u0027t doing very often. I sat through a few rounds and drank some coffee with bourbon in it.\\n\\n Because I thought it would help if I had some idea how I was going to approach this woman. I\u0027d been tracking her spoor through books and files and phone wires, as if she held the secret to the Ettinger murder, and for all I knew Barbara Ettinger was nothing to her beyond a faceless lump who put the alphabet blocks away when the kids were done playing with them.\\n\\n Or she was Barbara\u0027s best friend. Or her lover-I remembered Mrs. Pomerance\u0027s questions: \"She was a friend of the Corwins? Were they that way?\"\\n\\n Maybe she had killed Barbara. Could they have both left the day-care center early? Was that even possible, let alone likely?\\n\\n I was spinning my wheels and I knew it but I let them spin for a while anyway. On the television screen, the kid with the white stripe on his trunks was finally beginning to use his jab to set up right hands to the body. It didn\u0027t look as though he was going to take his man out in the handful of rounds remaining, not like that, but he seemed a safe shot for the decision. He was wearing his opponent down, grinding away at him. Jabbing with the left, hooking the right hand to the rib section. The other boy couldn\u0027t seem to find a defense that worked.\\n\\n I knew how both of them felt.\\n\\n I thought about Douglas Ettinger. I decided he didn\u0027t kill his wife, and I tried to figure out how I knew that, and I decided I knew it the same way I\u0027d known Janice Keane was in Manhattan. Chalk it up to divine inspiration.\\n\\n Ettinger was right, I decided. Louis Pinell killed Barbara Ettinger, just as he\u0027d killed the other seven women. Barbara had thought some nut was stalking her and she was right.\\n\\n Then why\u0027d she let the nut into her apartment?\\n\\n In the tenth round, the kid who\u0027d been getting his ribs barbecued summoned up some reserve of strength and put a couple of combinations together. He had the kid with the stripe on his trunks reeling, but the flurry wasn\u0027t enough to end it and the kid with the stripe hung on and got the decision. The crowd booed. I don\u0027t know what fight they thought they were watching. The crowd in Phoenix, that is. My companions in the Blarney Stone weren\u0027t that involved emotionally.\\n\\n The hell with it. I went and made my phone call.\\n\\n IT rang four or five times before she answered it. I said, \"Janice Keane, please,\" and she said she was Janice Keane.\\n\\n I said, \"My name\u0027s Matthew Scudder, Ms. Keane. I\u0027d like to ask you some questions.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"About a woman named Barbara Ettinger.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus.\" A pause. \"What about her?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m investigating her death. I\u0027d like to come over and talk with you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re investigating her death? That was ages ago. It must have been ten years.\"\\n\\n \"Nine years.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was the Mounties who never gave up. I never heard that about New York\u0027s Finest. You\u0027re a policeman?\"\\n\\n I was about to say yes, but heard myself say, \"I used to be.\"\\n\\n \"What are you now?\"\\n\\n \"A private citizen. I\u0027m working for Charles London. Mrs. Ettinger\u0027s father.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, her maiden name was London.\" She had a good telephone voice, low-pitched and throaty. \"I can\u0027t make out why you\u0027re starting an investigation now. And what could I possibly contribute to it?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I could explain that in person,\" I said. \"I\u0027m just a few minutes away from you now. Would it be all right if I come over?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus. What\u0027s today, Saturday? And what time is it? I\u0027ve been working and I tend to lose track of the time. I\u0027ve got six o\u0027clock. Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better fix something to eat. And I have to clean up. Give me an hour, okay?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be there at seven.\"\\n\\n \"You know the address?\" I read it off as I\u0027d received it from Information. \"That\u0027s it. That\u0027s between Church and Broadway, and you ring the bell and then stand at the curb so I can see you and I\u0027ll throw the key down. Ring two long and three short, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Two long and three short.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll know it\u0027s you. Not that you\u0027re anything to me but a voice on the phone. How\u0027d you get this number? It\u0027s supposed to be unlisted.\"\\n\\n \"I used to be a cop.\"\\n\\n \"Right, so you said. So much for unlisted numbers, huh? Tell me your name again.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-9.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \\n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
