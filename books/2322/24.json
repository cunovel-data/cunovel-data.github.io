{"id":62789,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"I asked him about the day of the murder. \"My shift ended around noon that day. I went over to Clinton Street and sat in a coffee shop at the counter where I could keep an eye on the place. When she left early I followed her. I was across the street watching her building when a man went into it. I knew him, I\u0027d seen him with her before.\" \"Was he black?\" \"Black? No. Why?\" \"No reason.\" \"I don\u0027t remember what he looked like. He was with her for a half-hour or so. Then he left. I waited a little while longer, and something told me, I don\u0027t know, I just knew this was the right time. I went up and knocked on her door.\" \"And she let you in?\" \"I showed her my shield. And I reminded her that she knew me from the day-care center, that I was Danny\u0027s father. She let me in.\" \"And?\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" \"Are you sure of that?\" I guess he thought it over. Then he said, \"We were in the kitchen. She was making me a cup of coffee, she had her back to me, and I put one hand over her mouth and jabbed the icepick into her chest. I wanted to get her heart right away, I didn\u0027t want her to suffer. I kept stabbing her in the heart and she collapsed in my arms and I let her fall to the floor.\" He raised his liquid brown eyes to mine. \"I think she was dead right then,\" he said. \"I think she died right away.\" \"And you went on stabbing her.\" \"When I thought about it before I did it, I always went crazy and stabbed over and over like a maniac. I had that picture in my mind. But I couldn\u0027t do it that way. I had to make myself stab her and I was sick, I thought I was going to throw up, and I had to keep on sticking that icepick into her body and-\" He broke off, gasping for breath. His face was drawn and his pale complexion was ghostly. \"It\u0027s all right,\" I said. \"Oh, God.\" \"Take it easy, Burt.\" \"God, God.\" \"You only stabbed one of her eyes.\" \"It was so hard,\" he said. \"Her eyes were wide open. I knew she was dead, I knew she couldn\u0027t see anything, but those eyes were just staring at me. I had the hardest time making myself stab her in the eye. I did it once and then I just couldn\u0027t do it again. I tried but I just couldn\u0027t do it again.\" \"And then?\" \"I left. No one saw me leave. I just left the building and walked away. I put the icepick down a sewer. I thought, I did it, I killed her and I got away with it, but I didn\u0027t feel as though I got away with anything. I felt sick to my stomach. I thought about what I had done and I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d really done it. When the story was on television and in the papers I couldn\u0027t believe it. I thought that someone else must have done it.\" \"And you didn\u0027t kill your wife.\" He shook his head. \"I knew I could never do something like that again. You know something? I\u0027ve thought about all of it, over and over, and I think I was out of my mind. In fact I\u0027m sure of it. Something about seeing Mrs. Potowski, those pools of blood in her eyes, those stab wounds all over her body, it did something to me. It made me crazy, and I went on being crazy until Barbara Ettinger was dead. Then I was all right again, but she was dead. \"All of a sudden certain things were clear. I couldn\u0027t stay married anymore, and for the first time I realized I didn\u0027t have to. I could leave my wife and Danny. I had thought that would be a horrible thing to do, but here I\u0027d been planning on killing her, and now I\u0027d actually killed somebody and I knew how much more horrible that was than anything else I could possibly do to her, like leaving.\" I led him through it again, went over a few points. He finished his beer but didn\u0027t get another. I wanted a drink, but I didn\u0027t want beer and I didn\u0027t want to drink with him. I didn\u0027t hate him. I don\u0027t know exactly what I felt for him. But I didn\u0027t want to drink with him. HE broke a silence to say, \"Nobody can prove any of this. It doesn\u0027t matter what I told you. There are no witnesses and there\u0027s no evidence.\" \"People could have seen you in the neighborhood.\" \"And still remember nine years later? And remember what day it was?\" He was right, of course. I couldn\u0027t imagine a District Attorney who\u0027d even try for an indictment. There was nothing to make a case out of. I said, \"Why don\u0027t you put a coat on, Burt.\" \"What for?\" \"We\u0027ll go down to the Eighteenth Precinct and talk to a cop named Fitzroy. You can tell him what you told me.\" \"That\u0027d be pretty stupid, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"Why?\" \"All I have to do is keep on the way I\u0027ve been. All I have to do is keep my mouth shut. Nobody can prove anything. They couldn\u0027t even try to prove anything.\" \"That\u0027s probably true.\" \"And you want me to confess.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" His expression was childlike. \"Why?\" To tie off the ends, I thought. To make it neat. To show Frank Fitzroy that he was right when he said I just might solve the case. What I said was, \"You\u0027ll feel better.\" \"That\u0027s a laugh.\" \"How do you feel now, Burt?\" \"How do I feel?\" He considered the question. Then, as if surprised by his answer, \"I feel okay.\" \"Better than when I got here?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Better than you\u0027ve felt since Sunday?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"You never told anybody, did you?\" \"Of course not.\" \"Not a single person in nine years. You probably didn\u0027t think about it much, but there were times when you couldn\u0027t help thinking about it, and you never told anybody.\" \"So?\" \"That\u0027s a long time to carry it.\" \"God.\" \"I don\u0027t know what they\u0027ll do with you, Burt. You may not do any time. Once I talked a murderer into killing himself, and he did it, and I wouldn\u0027t do that again. And another time I talked a murderer into confessing because I convinced him he would probably kill himself if he didn\u0027t confess first. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d do that I think you\u0027ve lived with this for nine years and maybe you could go on living with it. But do you really want to? Wouldn\u0027t you rather let go of it?\" \"God,\" he said. He put his head in his hands. \"I\u0027m all mixed up,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be all right.\" \"They\u0027ll put my picture in the papers. It\u0027ll be on the news. What\u0027s that going to make it like for Danny?\" \"You\u0027ve got to worry about yourself first.\" \"I\u0027ll lose my job,\" he said. \"What\u0027ll happen to me?\" I didn\u0027t answer that one. I didn\u0027t have an answer. \"Okay,\" he said suddenly. \"Ready to go?\" \"I guess.\" On the way downtown he said, \"I think I knew Sunday. I knew you\u0027d keep poking at it until you found out I did it. I had an urge to tell you right then.\" \"I got lucky. A couple of coincidences put me on St. Marks Place and I thought of you and had nothing better to do than see the house where you used to live. But the numbers stopped at One-three-two.\" \"If it wasn\u0027t that coincidence there would have been another one. It was all set from the minute you walked into my apartment. Maybe earlier than that. Maybe it was a sure thing from the minute I killed her. Some people get away with murder but I guess I\u0027m not one of them.\" \"Nobody gets away with it. Some people just don\u0027t get caught.\" \"Isn\u0027t that the same thing?\" \"You didn\u0027t get caught for nine years, Burt. What were you getting away with?\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"I get it.\" AND just before we got to the One-Eight I said, \"There\u0027s something I don\u0027t understand. Why did you think it would be easier to kill your wife than to leave her? You said several times that it would be such a terrible thing to leave a woman like her, that it would be a contemptible act, but men and women leave each other all the time. You couldn\u0027t have been worried about what your parents would think because you didn\u0027t have any family left. What made it such a big deal?\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t know.\" \"Don\u0027t know what?\" \"You haven\u0027t met her. You didn\u0027t go out there this afternoon, did you?\" \"No.\" (\"I never see him… I never see my former husband… I don\u0027t see my husband and I don\u0027t see the check. Do you see? Do you?\") \"The Potowski woman, with her eyes staring up through the blood. When I saw her like that it just hit me so hard I couldn\u0027t deal with it. But you wouldn\u0027t understand that because you don\u0027t know about her.\" (\"Perhaps he has a phone and perhaps it\u0027s in the book. You could look it up. I know you\u0027ll excuse me if I don\u0027t offer to look it up for you.\") The answer was floating out there. I could very nearly reach out and touch it. But my mind wouldn\u0027t fasten onto it. He said, \"My wife is blind.\" Chapter 17 It turned out to be a long night, although the trip to Twentieth Street was the least of it. I shared a cab down with Burton Havermeyer. We must have talked about something en route but I can\u0027t remember what. I paid for the cab, took Havermeyer to the squad room and introduced him to Frank Fitzroy, and that was pretty much the extent of my contribution. I, after all, was not the arresting officer. I had no official connection with the case and had performed no official function. I didn\u0027t have to be around while a stenographer took down Havermeyer\u0027s statement, nor was I called upon to make a statement of my own. Fitzroy slipped away long enough to walk me down to the corner and buy me a drink at P. J. Reynolds. I didn\u0027t much want to accept his invitation. I wanted a drink, but I wasn\u0027t much more inclined to drink with him than with Havermeyer. I felt closed off from everyone, locked up tight within myself where dead women and blind women couldn\u0027t get at me. The drinks came and we drank them, and he said, \"Nice piece of work, Matt.\" \"I got lucky.\" \"You don\u0027t get that kind of luck. You make it. Something got you onto Havermeyer in the first place.\" \"More luck. The other two cops from the Six-One were dead. He was odd man in.\" \"You could have talked to him on the phone. Something made you go see him.\" \"Lack of anything better to do.\" \"And then you asked him enough questions so that he told a couple lies that could catch him up further down the line.\" \"And I was in the right place at the right time, and the right shop sign caught my eye when the right pair of cops walked in front of me.\" \"Oh, shit,\" he said, and signaled the bartender. \"Put yourself down if you want.\" \"I just don\u0027t think I did anything to earn a field promotion to Chief of Detectives. That\u0027s all.\" The bartender came around. Fitzroy pointed to our glasses and the bartender filled them up again. I let him pay for this round, as he had paid for the first one. He said, \"You won\u0027t get any official recognition out of this, Matt. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027d prefer it that way.\" \"What we\u0027ll tell the press is the reopening of the case with the arrest of Pinell made him conscience-stricken, and he turned himself in. He talked it over with you, another ex-cop like himself, and decided to confess. How does that sound?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-24.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
