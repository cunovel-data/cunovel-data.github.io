What I was saying, you won\u0027t get anything official out of it, but people around the department are gonna know better. You follow me?\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So you couldn\u0027t ask for a better passport back onto the force is what it sounds like to me. I was talking to Eddie Koehler over at the Sixth. You wouldn\u0027t have any trouble getting \u0027em to take you on again.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not what I want.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he said you\u0027d say. But are you sure it isn\u0027t? All right, you\u0027re a loner, you got a hard-on for the world, you hit this stuff-\" he touched his glass \"-a little harder than you maybe should. But you\u0027re a cop, Matt, and you didn\u0027t stop being one when you gave the badge back.\"\\n\\n I thought for a moment, not to consider his proposal but to weigh the words of my reply. I said, \"You\u0027re right, in a way. But in another way you\u0027re wrong, and I stopped being a cop before I handed in my shield.\"\\n\\n \"All because of that kid that died.\"\\n\\n \"Not just that.\" I shrugged. \"People move and their lives change.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, and then he didn\u0027t say anything for a few minutes, and then we found something less unsettling to talk about. We discussed the impossibility of keeping three-card monte dealers off the street, given that the fine for the offense is seventy-five dollars and the profit somewhere between five hundred and a thousand dollars a day. \"And there\u0027s this one judge,\" he said, \"who told a whole string of them he\u0027d let \u0027em off without a fine if they\u0027d promise not to do it again. \u0027Oh, Ah promises, yo\u0027 honah.\u0027 To save seventy-five dollars, those assholes\u0027d promise to grow hair on their tongues.\"\\n\\n We had a third round of drinks, and I let him pay for that round, too, and then he went back to the station house and I caught a cab home. I checked the desk for messages, and when there weren\u0027t any I went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s, and that\u0027s where it got to be a long night.\\n\\n But it wasn\u0027t a bad one. I drank my bourbon in coffee, sipping it, making it last, and my mood didn\u0027t turn black or ugly. I talked to people intermittently but spent a lot of time replaying the day, listening to Havermeyer\u0027s explanation. Somewhere in the course of things I gave Jan a call to tell her how things had turned out. Her line was busy. Either she was talking to someone or she had the phone off the hook, and this time I didn\u0027t get the operator to find out which.\\n\\n I had just the right amount to drink, for a change. Not so much that I blacked out and lost my memory. But enough to bring sleep without dreams.\\n\\n BY the time I got down to Pine Street the next day, Charles London knew what to expect. The morning papers had the story. The line they carried was pretty much what I\u0027d expected from what Fitzroy had said. I was mentioned by name as the fellow ex-cop who\u0027d heard Havermeyer\u0027s confession and escorted him in so he could give himself up for the murder of Barbara Ettinger.\\n\\n Even so, he didn\u0027t look thrilled to see me.\\n\\n \"I owe you an apology,\" he said. \"I managed to become convinced that your investigations would only have a damaging effect upon a variety of people. I thought-\"\\n\\n \"I know what you thought.\"\\n\\n \"It turned out that I was wrong. I\u0027m still concerned about what might come out in a trial, but it doesn\u0027t look as though there will be a trial.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to worry about what comes out anyway,\" I said. \"Your daughter wasn\u0027t carrying a black baby.\" He looked as though he\u0027d been slapped. \"She was carrying her husband\u0027s baby. She may very well have been having an affair, probably in retaliation for her husband\u0027s behavior, but there\u0027s no evidence that it had an interracial element. That was an invention of your former son-in-law\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" He took his little walk to the window and made sure that the harbor was still out there. He turned to me and said, \"At least this has turned out well, Mr. Scudder.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"Barbara\u0027s killer has been brought to justice. I no longer have to worry who might have killed her, or why. Yes, I think we can say it\u0027s turned out well.\"\\n\\n He could say it if he wanted. I wasn\u0027t sure that justice was what Burton Havermeyer had been brought to, or where his life would go from here. I wasn\u0027t sure where justice figured in the ordeal that was just beginning for Havermeyer\u0027s son and his blind ex-wife. And if London didn\u0027t have to worry that Douglas Ettinger had killed his daughter, what he\u0027d learned about Ettinger\u0027s character couldn\u0027t have been monumentally reassuring.\\n\\n I thought, too, of the fault lines I\u0027d already detected in Ettinger\u0027s second marriage. I wondered how long the blonde with the sunny suburban face would hold her space in his desk-top photo cube. If they split, would he be able to go on working for his second father-in-law?\\n\\n Finally, I thought how people could adjust to one reality after another if they put their minds to it. London had begun by believing that his daughter had been killed for no reason at all, and he\u0027d adjusted to that. Then he came to believe that she had indeed been killed for a reason, and by someone who knew her well. And he\u0027d set about adjusting to that. Now he knew that she\u0027d been killed by a near-stranger for a reason that had nothing much to do with her. Her death had come in a dress rehearsal for murder, and in dying she\u0027d preserved the life of the intended victim. You could see all that as part of some great design or you could see it as further proof that the world was mad, but either way it was a new reality to which he would surely adjust.\\n\\n Before I left he gave me a check for a thousand dollars. A bonus, he said, and he assured me he wanted me to have it. I gave him no argument. When money comes with no strings on it, take it and put it in your pocket. I was still enough of a cop at heart to remember that much.\\n\\n I tried Jan around lunchtime and there was no answer. I tried her again later in the afternoon and the line was busy three times running. It was around six when I finally reached her.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hard to get hold of,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I was out some. And then I was on the phone.\"\\n\\n \"I was out some myself.\" I told her a lot of what had happened since I\u0027d left her loft the previous afternoon, armed with the knowledge that Havermeyer\u0027s boy Danny had attended the Happy Hours Child Care Center. I told her why Barbara Ettinger had been killed, and I told her that Havermeyer\u0027s wife was blind.\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" she said.\\n\\n We talked a little more, and I asked her what she was doing about dinner. \"My client gave me a thousand dollars that I didn\u0027t do a thing to earn,\" I said, \"and I feel a need to spend some of it frivolously before I piss the rest of it away on necessities.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid tonight\u0027s out,\" she said. \"I was just making myself a salad.\"\\n\\n \"Well, do you want to hit a couple of high spots after you finish your salad? Any place but Blanche\u0027s Tavern is fine with me.\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Then she said, \"The thing is, Matthew, I have something on tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s not another date. I\u0027m going to a meeting.\"\\n\\n \"A meeting?\"\\n\\n \"An A.A. meeting.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an alcoholic, Matthew. I\u0027ve got to face the fact and I\u0027ve got to deal with it.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have the impression that you drank that much.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not how much you drink. It\u0027s what it does to you. I have blackouts. I have personality changes. I tell myself I\u0027m not going to drink and I do. I tell myself I\u0027m going to have one drink and the next morning the bottle\u0027s empty. I\u0027m an alcoholic.\"\\n\\n \"You were in A.A. before.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it didn\u0027t work for you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it was working fine. Until I drank. This time I want to give it a chance.\"\\n\\n I thought for a minute. \"Well, I think that\u0027s great,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You do?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do,\" I said, and meant it. \"I think it\u0027s terrific. I know it works for a lot of people and there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t make it work. You\u0027re going to a meeting tonight?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I was at one this afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"I thought they only had them at night.\"\\n\\n \"They have them all the time, and all over the city.\"\\n\\n \"How often do you have to go?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do anything. They recommend ninety meetings in the first ninety days, but you can go to more. I have plenty of time. I can go to a lot of them.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great.\"\\n\\n \"After the meeting this afternoon I was on the phone with somebody I knew when I was in the program last time. And I\u0027m going to a meeting tonight, and that\u0027ll get me through today, and I\u0027ll have one day of sobriety.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s how it\u0027s done, you see. You take it one day at a time.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great.\" I wiped my forehead. It gets warm in a phone booth with the door closed. \"When do those meetings end? Ten or ten thirty, something like that?\"\\n\\n \"Ten o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"Well, suppose-\"\\n\\n \"But people generally go out for coffee afterward.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Well, suppose I came by around eleven? Or later, if you figure you\u0027ll want to spend more than an hour over coffee.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a very good idea, Matthew.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"I want to give this a fair shot. I don\u0027t want to start sabotaging myself before I even get started.\"\\n\\n I said, \"Jan? I wasn\u0027t planning to come over and drink with you.\"\\n\\n \"I know that.\"\\n\\n \"Or in front of you, as far as that goes. I won\u0027t drink when I\u0027m with you. That\u0027s no problem.\"\\n\\n \"Because you can stop anytime you want to.\"\\n\\n \"I can certainly not drink when we\u0027re together.\"\\n\\n Another pause, and when she spoke I could hear the strain in her voice. \"God,\" she said. \"Matthew, darling, it\u0027s not quite that simple.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"One of the things they tell us is that we\u0027re powerless over people, places and things.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what that means.\"\\n\\n \"It means to avoid those elements that can increase our desire to drink.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m one of those elements?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\\n\\n I cracked the phone booth door, let a little air in. I said, \"Well, what does that mean, exactly? That we never see each other again?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God.\"\\n\\n \"Just tell me the rules so I\u0027ll understand.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, God. I can\u0027t think in terms of never again. I can\u0027t even think in terms of never having a drink again. I\u0027m supposed to take it a day at a time, so let\u0027s do this in terms of today.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to see me today.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I want to see you today! Oh, Jesus. Look, if you want to come over around eleven-\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I said no. You were right the first time and I shouldn\u0027t be doing a number on you. I\u0027m like my client, that\u0027s all. I\u0027ve just got to adjust to a new reality. I think you\u0027re doing the right thing.\"\\n\\n \"Do you really?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. And if I\u0027m somebody you ought to stay away from, I think that\u0027s what you\u0027d better do for the time being. And if we\u0027re supposed to get together later on, well, it\u0027ll happen.\"\\n\\n A pause. Then, \"Thank you, Matthew.\"\\n\\n For what? I got out of the booth and went back upstairs to my room. I put on a clean shirt and tie and treated myself to a good steak dinner at the Slate. It\u0027s a hangout for cops from John Jay College and Midtown South, but I was lucky enough not to see anyone that I knew. I had a big meal all by myself, with a martini in front and a brandy afterward. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-25.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \\n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
