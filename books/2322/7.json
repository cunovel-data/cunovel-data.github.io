{"id":62772,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"According to the story\u0027s last paragraph, five other persons had been killed in or around the victims\u0027 building in the year since their murder. There\u0027d been no indication whether those five murders were solved, or whether the kid in custody was suspected of them.\\n\\n I let my mind slip off on tangents. Now and again I\u0027d put the book aside and find myself thinking about Barbara Ettinger. Donald Gilman had started to say that her father probably suspected someone, then caught himself and left the name unsaid.\\n\\n The husband, probably. The spouse is always the first suspect. If Barbara hadn\u0027t apparently been one of a series of victims, Douglas Ettinger would have been grilled six ways and backwards. As it was, he\u0027d been interrogated automatically by detectives from Midtown North. They could hardly have done otherwise. He was not only the husband. He was also the person who had discovered the body, coming upon her corpse in the kitchen upon returning from work.\\n\\n I\u0027d read a report of the interrogation. The man who conducted it had already taken it for granted that the killing was the work of the Icepick Prowler, so his questions had concentrated on Barbara\u0027s schedule, on her possible propensity for opening the door for strangers, on whether she might have mentioned anyone following her or behaving suspiciously. Had she been bothered recently by obscene telephone calls? People hanging up without speaking? Suspicious wrong numbers?\\n\\n The questioning had essentially assumed the subject\u0027s innocence, and the assumption had certainly been logical enough at the time. Evidently there had been nothing in Douglas Ettinger\u0027s manner to arouse suspicion.\\n\\n I tried, not for the first time, to summon up a memory of Ettinger. It seemed to me that I must have met him. We were on the scene before Midtown North came to take the case away from us, and he\u0027d have had to be somewhere around while I was standing in that kitchen eyeing the body sprawled on the linoleum. I might have tried to offer a word of comfort, might have formed some impression, but I couldn\u0027t remember him at all.\\n\\n Perhaps he\u0027d been in the bedroom when I was there, talking with another detective or with one of the patrolmen who\u0027d been first on the scene. Maybe I\u0027d never laid eyes on him, or maybe we\u0027d spoken and I\u0027d forgotten him altogether. I had by that time spent quite a few years seeing any number of recently bereaved. They couldn\u0027t all stand out in sharp relief in the cluttered warehouse of memory.\\n\\n Well, I\u0027d see him soon enough. My client hadn\u0027t said whom he suspected, and I hadn\u0027t asked, but it stood to reason that Barbara\u0027s husband headed the list. London wouldn\u0027t be all that upset by the possibility that she\u0027d died at the hands of someone he didn\u0027t even know, some friend or lover who meant nothing to him. But for her to have been killed by her own husband, a man London knew, a man who had been present years later at London\u0027s wife\u0027s funeral-\\n\\n There\u0027s a phone in my room but the calls go through the switchboard, and it\u0027s a nuisance placing them that way even when I don\u0027t care if the operator listens in. I went down to the lobby and dialed my client\u0027s number in Hastings. He answered on the third ring.\\n\\n \"Scudder,\" I said. \"I could use a picture of your daughter. Anything as long as it\u0027s a good likeness.\"\\n\\n \"I took albums full of pictures. But most of them were of Barbara as a child. You would want a late photograph, I suppose?\"\\n\\n \"As late as possible. How about a wedding picture?\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" he said. \"Of course. There\u0027s a very good picture of the two of them, it\u0027s in a silver frame on a table in the living room. I suppose I could have it copied. Do you want me to do that?\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s not too much trouble.\"\\n\\n He asked if he should mail it and I suggested he bring it to his office Monday. I said I\u0027d call and arrange to pick it up. He asked if I\u0027d had a chance to begin the investigation yet and I told him I\u0027d spent the day in Brooklyn. I tried him on a couple of names-Donald Gilman, Janice Corwin. Neither meant anything to him. He asked, tentatively, if I had any leads.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pretty cold trail,\" I said.\\n\\n I rang off without asking him who he suspected. I felt restless and went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s. On the way I wished I\u0027d taken the time to go back to my room for my coat. It was colder, and the wind had an edge to it.\\n\\n I sat at the bar with a couple of nurses from Roosevelt. One of them, Terry, was just finishing up her third week in Pediatrics. \"I thought I\u0027d like the duty,\" she said, \"but I can\u0027t stand it. Little kids, it\u0027s so much worse when you lose one. Some of them are so brave it breaks your heart. I can\u0027t handle it, I really can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Estrellita Rivera\u0027s image flashed in my mind and was gone. I didn\u0027t try to hold onto it. The other nurse, glass in hand, was saying that all in all she thought she preferred Sambucca to Amaretto. Or maybe it was the other way around.\\n\\n I made it an early night.\\n\\n Chapter 6\\n\\n Even if I couldn\u0027t recall meeting Douglas Ettinger, I had a picture of him in my mind. Tall and raw-boned, dark hair, pallid skin, knobby wrists, Lincolnesque features. A prominent Adam\u0027s apple.\\n\\n I woke up Saturday morning with his image firmly in mind, as if it had been imprinted there during an unremembered dream. After a quick breakfast I went down to Penn Station and caught a Long Island Railroad local to Hicksville. A phone call to his house in Mineola had established that Ettinger was working at the Hicksville store, and it turned out to be a $2.25 cab ride from the station.\\n\\n In an aisle lined with squash and racquet-ball equipment I asked a clerk if Mr. Ettinger was in. \"I\u0027m Doug Ettinger,\" he said. \"What can I do for you?\"\\n\\n He was about five-eight, a chunky one-seventy. Tightly curled light brown hair with red highlights. The plump cheeks and alert brown eyes of a squirrel. Large white teeth, with the upper incisors slightly bucked, consistent with the squirrel image. He didn\u0027t look remotely familiar, nor did he bear any resemblance whatsoever to the rail-splitter caricature I\u0027d dreamed up to play his part.\\n\\n \"My name\u0027s Scudder,\" I said. \"I\u0027d like to talk to you privately, if you don\u0027t mind. It\u0027s about your wife.\"\\n\\n His open face turned guarded. \"Karen?\" he said. \"What about her?\"\\n\\n Christ. \"Your first wife.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Barbara,\" he said. \"You had me going for a second there. The serious tone and all, and wanting to talk to me about my wife. I don\u0027t know what I thought. You\u0027re from the NYPD? Right this way, we can talk in the office.\"\\n\\n His was the smaller of the two desks in the office. Invoices and correspondence were arranged in neat piles on it. A Lucite photo cube held pictures of a woman and several young children. He saw me looking at it and said, \"That\u0027s Karen there. And the kids.\"\\n\\n I picked up the cube, looked at a young woman with short blonde hair and a sunny smile. She was posed next to a car, with an expanse of lawn behind her. The whole effect was very suburban.\\n\\n I replaced the photo cube and took the chair Ettinger indicated. He sat behind the desk, lit a cigarette with a disposable butane lighter. He knew the Icepick Prowler had been apprehended, knew too that the suspect denied any involvement in his first wife\u0027s murder. He assumed Pinell was lying, either out of memory failure or for some insane reason. When I explained that Pinell\u0027s alibi had been confirmed, he seemed unimpressed.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been years,\" he said. \"People can get mixed up on dates and you never know how accurate records are. He probably did it. I wouldn\u0027t take his word that he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"The alibi looks sound.\"\\n\\n Ettinger shrugged. \"You\u0027d be a better judge of that than I would. Still, I\u0027m surprised that you guys are reopening the case. What can you expect to accomplish after all this time?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not with the police, Mr. Ettinger.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you said-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t bother to correct your impression. I used to be in the department. I\u0027m private now.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re working for somebody?\"\\n\\n \"For your former father-in-law.\"\\n\\n \"Charlie London hired you?\" He frowned, taking it all in. \"Well, I guess it\u0027s his privilege. It\u0027s not going to bring Barbie back but I guess it\u0027s his right to feel like he\u0027s doing something. I remember he was talking about posting a reward after she was murdered. I don\u0027t know if he ever got around to it or not.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe he did.\"\\n\\n \"So now he wants to spend a few dollars finding the real killer. Well, why not? He doesn\u0027t have much going for him since Helen died. His wife, Barbara\u0027s mother.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027ll do him good to have something he can take an interest in. Not that work doesn\u0027t keep him busy, but, well-\" He flicked ashes from his cigarette. \"I don\u0027t know what help I can give you, Mr. Scudder, but ask all the questions you want.\"\\n\\n I asked about Barbara\u0027s social contacts, her relationships with people in the building. I asked about her job at the day-care center. He remembered Janice Corwin but couldn\u0027t supply her husband\u0027s name. \"The job wasn\u0027t that important,\" he said. \"Basically it was something to get her out of the house, give her a focus for her energy. Oh, the money helped. I was dragging a briefcase around for the Welfare Department, which wasn\u0027t exactly the road to riches. But Barbie\u0027s job was temporary. She was going to give it up and stay home with the baby.\"\\n\\n The door opened. A teenage clerk started to enter the office, then stopped and stood there looking awkward. \"I\u0027ll be a few minutes, Sandy,\" Ettinger told him. \"I\u0027m busy right now.\"\\n\\n The boy withdrew, shutting the door. \"Saturday\u0027s always busy for us,\" Ettinger said. \"I don\u0027t want to rush you, but I\u0027m needed out there.\"\\n\\n I asked him some more questions. His memory wasn\u0027t very good, and I could understand why. He\u0027d had one life torn up and had had to create a new one, and it was easier to do so if he dwelled on the first life as little as possible. There were no children from that first union to tie him into relations with in-laws. He could leave his marriage to Barbara in Brooklyn, along with his caseworker\u0027s files and all the trappings of that life. He lived in the suburbs now and drove a car and mowed a lawn and lived with his kids and his blonde wife. Why sit around remembering a tenement apartment in Boerum Hill?\\n\\n \"Funny,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t begin to think of anyone we knew who might be capable of… doing what was done to Barbie. But one other thing I could never believe was that she\u0027d let a stranger into the apartment.\"\\n\\n \"She was careful about that sort of thing?\"\\n\\n \"She was always on guard. Wyckoff Street wasn\u0027t the kind of neighborhood she grew up in, although she found it comfortable enough. Of course we weren\u0027t going to stay there forever.\" His glance flicked to the photo cube, as if he was seeing Barbara standing next to a car and in front of a lawn. \"But she got spooked by the other icepick killings.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"Not at first. When he killed the woman in Sheepshead Bay, though, that\u0027s when it got to her. Because it was the first time he\u0027d struck in Brooklyn, you see. It freaked her a little.\"\\n\\n \"Because of the location? Sheepshead Bay\u0027s a long ways from Boerum Hill.\"\\n\\n \"But it was Brooklyn. And there was something else, I think, because I remember she identified pretty strongly with the woman who got killed. I must have known why but I can\u0027t remember. Anyway, she got nervous. She told me she had the feeling she was being watched.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-7.html","bookId":2322,"book":{"id":2322,"title":"A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4)","description":"Storyline: A Stab in the Dark (Matthew Scudder #4) \\n Louis Pinell, the recently apprehended \"Icepick Prowler,\" freely admits to having slain seven young women nine years ago -- but be swears it was a copycat who killed Barbara Ettinger Matthew Scudder believes him.
