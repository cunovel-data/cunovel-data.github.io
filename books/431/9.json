{"id":20244,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. THE UNWELCOME GUEST.","content":"The stranger was in rather an awkward predicament. However, he betrayed neither embarrassment nor alarm. Blowing out the candle, he advanced to the table and set it down. This movement brought him nearer Paul Nichols, who, with the timidity natural to an old man, anticipated an immediate attack. \"Don\u0027t kill me! Spare my life!\" he exclaimed, hastily stepping back. \"I see you don\u0027t know me, Uncle Paul?\" said the intruder, familiarly. \"Who are you that call me Uncle Paul?\" asked the old man, somewhat reassured. \"Benjamin Haley, your sister\u0027s son. Do you know me now?\" \"You Ben Haley!\" exclaimed the old man, betraying surprise. \"Why, you are old enough to be his father.\" \"Remember, Uncle Paul, I am eighteen years older than when you saw me last. Time brings changes, you know. When I saw you last, you were a man in the prime of life, now you are a feeble old man.\" \"Are you really Ben Haley?\" asked the old man, doubtfully. \"To be sure I am. I suppose I look to you more like a bearded savage. Well, I\u0027m not responsible for my looks. Not finding you at home, I took the liberty of coming in on the score of relationship.\" \"What, were you doing with that candle?\" asked Paul, suspiciously. \"I went down cellar with it.\" \"Down cellar!\" repeated his uncle, with a look of alarm which didn\u0027t escape his nephew. \"What for?\" \"In search of something to eat. All I could find in the closet was a dry loaf, which doesn\u0027t look very appetizing.\" \"There\u0027s nothing down cellar. Don\u0027t go there again,\" said the old man, still uneasy. His nephew looked at him shrewdly. \"Ha, Uncle Paul! I\u0027ve guessed your secret so quick,\" he said to himself. \"Some of your money is hidden away in the cellar, I\u0027m thinking.\" \"Where do you keep your provisions, then?\" he said aloud. \"The loaf is all I have.\" \"Come, Uncle Paul, you don\u0027t mean that. That\u0027s a scurvy welcome to give a nephew you haven\u0027t seen for eighteen years. I\u0027m going to stay to dinner with you, and you must give me something better than that. Haven\u0027t you got any meat in the house?\" \"No.\" Just then Ben Haley, looking from the window, saw some chickens in the yard. His eye lighted up at the discovery. \"Ah, there is a nice fat chicken,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll have a chicken dinner. Shall it be roast or boiled?\" \"No, no,\" said the old farmer, hastily. \"I can\u0027t spare them. They\u0027ll bring a good price in the market by and by.\" \"Can\u0027t help it, Uncle Paul. Charity begins at home. Excuse me a minute, I\u0027ll be back directly.\" He strode to the door and out into the yard. Then, after a little maneuvering, he caught a chicken, and going to the block, seized the ax, and soon decapitated it. \"What have you done?\" said Paul, ruefully, for the old man had followed his nephew, and was looking on in a very uncomfortable frame of mind. \"Taken the first step toward a good dinner,\" said the other, coolly. \"I am not sure but we shall want two.\" \"No, no!\" said Paul, hastily. \"I haven\u0027t got much appetite.\" \"Then perhaps we can make it do. I\u0027ll just get it ready, and cook it myself. I\u0027ve knocked about in all sorts of places, and it won\u0027t be the first time I\u0027ve served as cook. I\u0027ve traveled some since I saw you last.\" \"Have you?\" said the old man, who seemed more interested in the untimely death of the pullet than in his nephew\u0027s adventures. \"Yes, I\u0027ve been everywhere. I spent a year in Australia at the gold diggings.\" \"Did you find any?\" asked his uncle, for the first time betraying interest. \"Some, but I didn\u0027t bring away any.\" Ben Haley meanwhile was rapidly stripping the chicken of its feathers. When he finished, he said, \"Now tell me where you keep your vegetables, Uncle Paul?\" \"They\u0027re in the corn barn. You can\u0027t get in. It\u0027s locked.\" \"Where\u0027s the key?\" \"Lost.\" \"I\u0027ll get in, never fear,\" said the intruder, and he led the way to the corn barn, his uncle unwillingly following and protesting that it would be quite impossible to enter. Reaching the building, he stepped back and was about to kick open the door, when old Paul hurriedly interposed, saying, \"No, no, I\u0027ve found the key.\" His nephew took it from his hand, and unlocking the door, brought out a liberal supply of potatoes, beets and squashes. \"We\u0027ll have a good dinner, after all,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t half know how to live, Uncle Paul. You need me here. You\u0027ve got plenty around you, but you don\u0027t know how to use it.\" The free and easy manner in which his nephew conducted himself was peculiarly annoying and exasperating to the old man, but as often as he was impelled to speak, the sight of his nephew\u0027s resolute face and vigorous frame, which he found it difficult to connect with his recollections of young Ben, terrified him into silence, and he contented himself with following his nephew around uneasily with looks of suspicion. When the dinner was prepared both sat down to partake of it, but Ben quietly, and, as a matter of course, assumed the place of host and carved the fowl. Notwithstanding the shock which his economical notions had received, the farmer ate with appetite the best meal of which he had partaken for a long time. Ben had not vaunted too highly his skill as a cook. Wherever he had acquired it, he evidently understood the preparation of such a dinner as now lay before them. \"Now, Uncle Paul, if we only had a mug of cider to wash down the dinner. Haven\u0027t you got some somewhere?\" \"Not a drop.\" \"Don\u0027t you think I might find some stored away in the cellar, for instance?\" asked Ben, fixing his glance upon his uncle\u0027s face. \"No, no; didn\u0027t I tell you I hadn\u0027t got any?\" returned Paul Nichols, with petulance and alarm. \"I mean to see what else you have in the cellar,\" said Ben, to himself, \"before I leave this place. There\u0027s a reason for that pale face of yours.\" But he only said aloud, \"Well, if you haven\u0027t got any we must do without it. There\u0027s a little more of the chicken left. As you don\u0027t want it I\u0027ll appropriate it. Nothing like clearing up things. Come, this is rather better than dry bread, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It\u0027s very expensive,\" said the miser, ruefully. \"Well, you can afford it, Uncle Paul—there\u0027s a comfort in that. I suppose you are pretty rich, eh?\" \"Rich!\" repeated Paul, in dismay. \"What put such a thing into your head?\" \"Not your style of living, you may be sure of that.\" \"I am poor, Benjamin. You mustn\u0027t think otherwise. I live as well as I can afford.\" \"Then what have you been doing with your savings all these years?\" \"My savings! It has taken all I had to live. There isn\u0027t any money to be made in farming. It\u0027s hard work and poor pay.\" \"You used to support your family comfortably when you had one.\" \"Don\u0027t—don\u0027t speak of them. I can\u0027t bear it,\" said Paul, his countenance changing. \"When I had them I was happy.\" \"And now you\u0027re not. Well, I don\u0027t wonder at it. It must be dismal enough living alone. You need somebody with you. I am your nephew and nearest relation. I feel that it is my duty to stay with you.\" The expression of dismay which overspread the old man\u0027s face at this declaration was ludicrous. \"You stay with me?\" he repeated, in a tone of alarm. \"Yes, for a time at least. We\u0027ll be company for each other, won\u0027t we, Uncle Paul?\" \"No, no; there\u0027s no room.\" \"No room? You don\u0027t mean to say that you need the whole house?\" \"I mean I cannot afford to have you here. Besides I\u0027m used to being alone. I prefer it.\" \"That\u0027s complimentary, at any rate. You prefer to be alone rather than to have me with you?\" \"Don\u0027t be offended, Benjamin. I\u0027ve been alone so many years. Besides you\u0027d feel dull here. You wouldn\u0027t like it.\" \"I\u0027ll try it and see. What room are you going to give me?\" \"You\u0027d better go away.\" \"Well, uncle, we\u0027ll talk about that to-morrow. You\u0027re very considerate in fearing it will be dull for me, but I\u0027ve roamed about the world so much that I shall be glad of a little dullness. So it\u0027s all settled. And now, Uncle Paul, if you don\u0027t object I\u0027ll take out my pipe and have a smoke. I always smoke after dinner.\" He lit his pipe, and throwing himself back in a chair, began to puff away leisurely, his uncle surveying him with fear and embarrassment. Why should his graceless nephew turn up, after so many years, in the form of this big, broad-shouldered, heavy-bearded stranger, only to annoy him, and thrust his unwelcome company upon him? \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2958/81357.html","bookId":431,"book":{"id":431,"title":"Brave and Bold","description":"简介： The main schoolroom in the Millville Academy was brilliantly lighted, and the various desks were occupied by boys and girls of different ages from ten to eighteen, all busily writing under the general direction of Professor George W.
