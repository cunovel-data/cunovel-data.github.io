{"id":39092,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. A STRANGE STORY","content":"Sophy neither screamed nor fainted at this extraordinary announcement; indeed, it appeared to her so very ridiculous that she felt more inclined to laugh. However, she controlled her feelings, and spoke very quietly--so quietly that the visitor was somewhat disconcerted. \n \n \"Why do you make this strange assertion?\" she asked, looking again at his card. \n \n \"Because it is true.\" \n \n \"What proof can you give me of its truth?\" \n \n \"Three proofs, Sophy, if I may call----\" \n \n \"You may not!\" interrupted the girl, flushing. \"I am Miss Marlow.\" \n \n \"For the present,\" assented the man, with an ironical smile. \"Soon you will be Miss Lestrange. Three proofs, then, I have. Firstly, I can tell you the story of how I lost you; secondly, there is the resemblance between us; and, thirdly, I have the certificate of your birth. Oh, it is easily proved, I can assure you.\" \n \n She shivered. He spoke very positively. What if his claim could be substantiated? She looked at him; she glanced into a near mirror, and she saw with dismay that there was a strong resemblance. Like herself, Lestrange, as he called himself, was slight in build, small in stature. He also had dark hair and brilliant eyes; the contour of his face, the chiseling of his features, resembled her own. Finally, he had that Spanish look which she knew she herself possessed. So far as outward appearances went, she might well have been the daughter of this rakish-looking stranger. He smiled. From her furtive glance into the mirror he guessed her thoughts. \n \n \"You see the glass proclaims the truth,\" said he. \"Think of your supposed father, Richard Marlow--tall, fair, blue-eyed, Saxon in looks! Like myself, you have the Spanish look and possess all the grace and color of Andalusia. I always thought you would grow up beautiful. Your dear mother was the loveliest woman in Jamaica.\" \n \n She did not answer, but the color ebbed from her cheeks, the courage from her heart. It was true enough that she in no way resembled Mr. Marlow. This man might be her father, after all. Yet he repelled her; the glance of his glittering eyes gave her a feeling of repulsion. He was a bad man, of that she felt certain. But her father? She fought against her doubts, and with a courage born of despair she prepared to defend herself until help arrived. Her thoughts flew to Alan; he was the champion she desired. \n \n \"I expect my guardian, Mr. Thorold, in a quarter of an hour,\" she said in a hard voice. \"You will be good enough to relate your story to him. I prefer to hear it when he is present.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t believe me?\" \n \n \"No, I do not. Mr. Marlow treated me as his daughter, and I feel myself to be his daughter. Do you expect me to believe you, to rush into your arms without proof?\" \n \n \"I have shown you one proof.\" \n \n \"A chance resemblance counts for nothing. What about the certificate?\" \n \n He produced a pocketbook, and took out a piece of paper. \n \n \"This is a copy of the entry in the register of the Church of St. Thomas at Kingston, You will find it all correct, Marie.\" \n \n \"Marie! What do you mean?\" \n \n \"That paper will inform you,\" said Lestrange coolly. \n \n Sophy read the certificate. Truly, it seemed regular enough. It stated that on the 24th of June, 18--, was born at Kingston, in the island of Jamaica, Marie Annette Celestine Lestrange. The names of the parents were Achille Lestrange and Zelia, his wife. Sophy could not suppress a start. The 24th of June was her birthday; the date of the year was also correct. She was twenty-one years of age now. She turned to him. \n \n \"You are Achille Lestrange?\" \n \n \"Your father--yes.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t admit that, monsieur.\" \n \n \"Why do you call me \u0027monsieur\u0027?\" \n \n \"You are French, are you not?\" \n \n \"French by descent, if you will, but I am a British subject. Also, I am a Roman Catholic. You are of the same faith?\" \n \n \"Yes, I am of the true Faith.\" \n \n \"I am glad of that,\" said Lestrange indolently; he was as indolent as graceful, and reminded Sophy of a full-fed tiger. \"I am pleased to hear that Marlow allowed you to retain your faith since he took from you your father and your name.\" \n \n \"Do you know that my father is dead?\" \n \n \"Pardon me, he is alive, and sitting before you.\" \n \n Sophy ignored his remark. \n \n \"Do you know that Mr. Marlow is dead?\" she asked again. \n \n \"Ah! now you speak as you should. Yes, I heard something about his death. The fact is, I have only just landed from a Royal Mail steamer at Southampton--two days ago, in fact--so I know very little. But I have heard of the disappearance of his body. It is town talk in London. One cannot open a newspaper without coming across theories of how it happened.\" \n \n \"And the murder of Dr. Warrender? Do you know of that also?\" \n \n \"Of course. The two things go together, as I understand. Marlow\u0027s body is lost; Warrender was stabbed. How unfortunate that two people I knew should be out of the way when I come to claim you!\" \n \n \"Did you know Dr. Warrender?\" asked Sophy quickly. \n \n \"As I know myself,\" was the answer. \"Twenty years ago, when you were a child, a mere infant, he practised in the town of Falmouth, Jamaica. He left after certain events which happened there, and, I believe, practised again in New Orleans. He married there, too, it was said.\" \n \n \"Yes; his wife lives at Heathton.\" \n \n \"Ah! I shall be glad to see her. Has the man who murdered her husband been discovered?\" \n \n \"No; he cannot be found.\" \n \n \"Nor ever will be, I suspect,\" said Captain Lestrange coolly. \"From what I read, the whole criminal business was conducted in the most skilful manner. I wonder why they stole poor Dick\u0027s body.\" \n \n \"Poor Dick!\" retorted the girl indignantly. \"Are you speaking of my father?\" \n \n \"Of the man who passed as your father--yes, Marie, I am.\" \n \n \"Pray don\u0027t call me Marie! I am Sophia Marlow.\" \n \n \"As you please. Temper again! Oh, how you remind me of Zelia!\" \n \n She was confounded at the cool assurance of the man. Nothing seemed to ruffle his temper or banish his eternal smile. He was more hateful to her than ever. Never would she acknowledge herself his daughter, even should he prove his claim! She was of age, and her own mistress. The will of Richard Marlow left the money, not to \"my daughter,\" but to \"Sophia Marlow,\" so there was no possibility of the money being taken from her. Then she thought of Alan. He would stand between her and this man. And even as this thought came into her mind, the door opened, and Thorold came forward eagerly to meet her; but, on perceiving the stranger, he stopped short. Lestrange rose and bowed in a foreign fashion. \n \n \"Oh, Alan!\" cried Sophy, \"I am so glad you have come! I was waiting for you.\" \n \n \"And I also,\" remarked Lestrange. \n \n \"Who is this gentleman, Sophy?\" demanded Alan. \n \n \"He calls himself Captain Lestrange. Here is his card.\" \n \n \"Captain in the army of the Peruvian Republic,\" said the man, \"and this young lady\u0027s father!\" \n \n \"Confound you!--what--what----!\" \n \n \"Oh yes, Alan. He says he is my father--that my true father stole me from him. Here is the certificate of my birth, he says.\" \n \n \"And here\"--Lestrange pointed to Sophy--\"here is my second self. Can you deny the resemblance? By the way, who are you?\" \n \n The inquiry was made with graceful insolence, and was meant to provoke the young man into losing his temper. But in this it failed. \n \n \"I am Alan Thorold,\" he said quietly, \"the Squire of Heathton, and I am engaged to marry Miss Marlow----\" \n \n \"Pardon--Mademoiselle Lestrange,\" interpolated the Captain, and resumed his seat. \"I claim this young lady as my daughter.\" \n \n \"Good,\" said Thorold coldly. \"Your proofs?\" \n \n \"The resemblance between us, the certificate of her birth, and the story of how I lost my dear Marie twenty years ago.\" \n \n \"The resemblance I admit, but that goes for nothing. As to the certificate, it is that of Marie Lestrange, and not of Sophy Marlow.\" \n \n \"Is not the birthday of Miss Marlow, as you will call her, on the 24th of June----\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Sophy, before Alan could stop her. \"The day and the year are both correct. I am twenty-one, and I was born on the 24th of June, 18--.\" \n \n \"Very good; and at Kingston?\" \n \n \"At Kingston,\" admitted the girl; \"but, for all that, I am not your daughter.\" \n \n \"I agree with Miss Marlow,\" said Mr. Thorold. \"Let us hear your story. That it will convince me I do not promise.\" \n \n \"Ah!\" cried the foreigner, with an ironical smile. \"None so blind as those who won\u0027t see. What a pity that Marlow and Warrender are both dead!\" \n \n \"Oh, you know that?\" \n \n \"As I had the honor of telling Miss Marlow\"--Lestrange put so sneering an accent on the name that Alan felt inclined to kick him--\"I know that. I landed in England from Jamaica only two days ago. But, as you know, every one is talking of the mystery, and by this time I know the case as well as you do.\" \n \n Alan winced, and Sophy glanced at him apprehensively. Would her champion fail her? Would this man prove his claim? She was in deadly terror lest he should. But Alan had no intention of yielding. \n \n \"Go on,\" he said again. \"Miss Marlow and I will hear your story.\" \n \n \"Very good. I am glad to see that you have the British instinct of fair play. I will be as brief as possible, and you can ask me any questions you wish. My name is Achille Lestrange, the man who is mentioned in that certificate. I am--or, rather, I was--a Captain in the Peruvian Army. I retired after the war between that country and Chili. However, I have ample means to live on, and I retain my military rank, out of sheer vanity, if you will.\" \n \n \"All this,\" said Alan, \"is beside the point.\" \n \n \"It is necessary to explain my position. More than twenty years ago I was married at Kingston to Zelia Durand. We had one child--a little girl--the same who now sits beside you.\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t hear of it!\" cried Sophy angrily. \n \n \"We shall see,\" he went on cheerfully. \"You may change your mind when I have got to the end of my story. I regret to say that Mrs. Lestrange--I do not call her Madame,\" explained the Captain, \"because I am truly English in speech and manner--well, Mrs. Lestrange had a bad temper. We did not get on well together. And, besides, I was jealous\"--his eyes flashed fire--\"yes, I was jealous of Herbert Beauchamp.\" \n \n \"Herbert Beauchamp!\" Alan thought of Marlow\u0027s will and of the legacy. How did this man come to know the name? \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1919/55170.html","bookId":908,"book":{"id":908,"title":"The Millionaire Mystery","description":"简介： Steering his course by a tapering spire notched in the eye of the sunset, a tramp slouched along the Heathton Road.
