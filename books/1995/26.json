We can’t just go in there,” I replied, unable to keep from laughing at him. “Sweet Blaire, if I don’t get inside you real damn fast more than just your daddy is gonna know we’re having sex. That little kitchen table is looking real nice about right now.” I shivered with anticipation as he pulled me down into the lower room. “Just a bed,” he said as he looked at the small room. “Hell, yeah.” I crawled up on the unmade bed and he followed me before turning to close the sliding pocket door and locking it. His dirty talk and my horny state had me so worked up that it wasn’t going to take much to send me off. I was trembling with the need for him to touch me. “Take it off,” he said, looking pointedly down at my sundress. I reached for the hem and pulled it over my head before tossing it to the side of the mattress. I hadn’t bothered with a bra but I was wearing panties. His eyes flared with heat as he gazed at my breasts. I loved knowing that the sight of my swollen stomach didn’t make him want me any less. If anything he was even more attracted to me. He pulled his shirt off then crawled over to kneel in front of me. His large hands cupped my breasts and he teased my nipples causing me to moan and press myself further into his hands. He let his hands move south until he was covering my stomach with both of his hands and gently caressing me. “Mine,” he said simply with wonder and awe in his voice. Then his hand slipped down between my legs and into the panties I was still wearing. He found out just exactly how turned on I was. “Mmmm, my sweet Blaire needs me. I like that. I fucking love it,” he groaned and laid me back on the mattress before pulling my panties off. He ran his thumb over the pad of my feet then wrapped a hand around each of my ankles and pulled them over his shoulders. “Rush.” I tried to stop him before he started just because I wanted him inside me. But his tongue flicked out over my folds and licked all the way up to my clit causing all reasonable thought to fly away. I grabbed handfuls of the sheets and bucked against his face as I cried out his name. I no longer cared who heard me. The smooth metal in his mouth teased my clit relentlessly as he ran it back and forth over my swollen sex. “So damn sweet,” he murmured against me and I fell apart. My body convulsed and I was sure I screamed his name loud enough for our neighbors to hear. When I managed to get my eyes open again he was naked and moving up between my legs. I lifted to meet his thrust and loved watching his face contort with pleasure as he whispered my name this time. Rush reached down and pulled my hips up to meet his thrusts as he slid in and out of me in a steady rhythm. I felt the pleasure building and I became more frantic to feel it again. I began lifting my hips higher as I grabbed his arms to pull myself up faster. Rush stopped and eased me back, slowing the pace as he moved over me. His mouth covered mine and he began kissing me as if he had all the time in the world when in reality I was a few thrusts away from another orgasm. His tongue ran across mine, tangling with it and then licking at my lips before pressing chaste kisses on the corners of my mouth and then sucking on my top lip. “Don’t leave me again. I can’t lose you,” he pleaded. His hips moved and pressed into me deep one more time as he let out a groan. I went flying apart, clinging to him and promising him anything he wanted. His cry of release sent me off again. When I finally managed to breathe Rush was cuddling me into his arms and tucking his head into the crook of my neck. His warm breath tickled and soothed me at the same time. “Love you. So fucking much,” he said in a husky whisper. “I love you too. So fucking much,” I replied with a happy smile. He chuckled but didn’t look at me. He kept his face buried against me. “I’m gonna need you again. I’m sorry,” he said. Confused, I frowned and pulled back so I could see his face. “Why are you sorry?” “Because I may be insatiable tonight. It’s been a long twenty- four hours.” “You mean you want more, now?” I asked Rush slipped his hands between my legs. “Yeah, baby, I do.” Rush was asleep when I heard my dad enter the boat. I was thankful he’d missed out on all the action. Rush had finally fallen asleep from exhaustion. I was completely satisfied though. I’d fought off sleep because I wanted to wait for my dad to come back home. I reached for my sundress and eased out of Rush’s arms then slipped it over my head. I needed to go tell him about Rush being here. I hadn’t told him much of anything so he needed some explanation. Unlocking the door, I glanced back at Rush who was still sleeping peacefully. Easing off the bed and out of the room I tiptoed up the stairs. Dad was sitting at the kitchen table fixing himself a glass of milk. He glanced over at me and smiled. “Didn’t mean to wake you,” he said. “You didn’t. I was awake,” I replied. I nodded toward the front of the boat, outside where our voice wouldn’t carry downstairs as loudly. “Can we talk?” Dad looked toward the stairs and frowned then nodded and stood up to walk back outside of the cabin. I closed the cabin door to muffle anything we said before turning to look at my dad. “Rush is here,” I explained. “He’s sleeping.” Understanding dawned on my dad’s face and he nodded. “Good. Glad the boy was smart enough to come get you.” He liked Rush. He’d thrown me in front of Rush to begin with. I was glad he approved. That made things so much easier. I wanted to keep a relationship with my dad and Rush hadn’t been a fan of him for a long time. “I left because of his family. Nan mostly. She’s... too much sometimes.” “She’s a nightmare. She isn’t my daughter; you can be blunt. I spent enough time with her to know she’s in need of some serious attention from a father.” I nodded and sat down on the bench seat along the side of the boat then tucked my legs underneath me. “I don’t want to hate her because Rush loves her. It’s hard though. She’s determined to take him away from me. Sometimes I think she just might win.” Dad sat down on a faded rainbow colored lawn chair. “Boy loves you more. He will always love you more. Anyone can see that, baby girl. You just have to learn not to let Nan intimidate you.” “I’m trying. But then when she needs him he is there. Most of the time at the expense of my needs. She always wins. I know that sounds silly and I’m being selfish but I need him to pick me. I need him to pick me and our baby over everyone else. I don’t... I don’t know if he’ll ever do that.” Saying the words aloud caused my throat to constrict. Admitting your worst fear was hard. But I needed someone to listen to me. “You deserve to be number one. You’ve been through too much shit, thanks to me, and it’s time a man made you feel like you’re the most important person in his world. It isn’t selfish. It’s normal. That sister of his uses the fact she was deprived of a father as her excuse to be a raging spoiled bitch. You were handed an even shittier deal. You lost your sister, your father, and your mother. You’ve had more pain than that girl could ever understand yet you still love. You still forgive and you’re strong. You’ll be an incredible mother and wife.” Dad let out a heavy sigh. “All Rush’s life he’s thought of Nan as his child. He’s raised her. She’s an adult now and it’s time he let go. He’s figuring out how to do that and I think he’ll find it. He loves you. I know he does. Any fool can see it all over his face.” I hoped he was right. “I love him enough that I’m afraid even if he always chooses her I will always forgive him.” Dad nodded and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees. “I reckon if that happens then I’ll have to fly back to Rosemary to beat the shit outta the boy. You just call me. I’ll always come get you.” I smiled at the sincere look on his face as he threatened to beat up Rush for me. This was the man I’d grown up loving. This was the man who’d threatened Cain with his hunting rifle on our first date. I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his neck. “I love you,” I whispered. “Love you too, Blaire bear.” A loud cough startled me and I glanced back to see the guy from earlier, once again standing in his boat watching us. He was beginning to give me the creeps. At least this time he was wearing a shirt, even if it was unbuttoned and hanging open. “Evening, Captain,” Dad called out and the guy raised his beer in a greeting. “Evening,” he replied. But he didn’t leave. He just stood there. “This is Blaire. My daughter,” Dad said. “We met earlier today,” he told Abe and winked at me again. I immediately felt uncomfortable. Rush wouldn’t like him winking at me. Maybe we shouldn’t stay a few days. I was pregnant. Couldn’t he see that? Why would he be flirting with a pregnant woman? “Ah, well then, good. Glad y’all met,” Dad sounded nervous. Something was off. Was this guy dangerous? The door to the cabin opened and a sleep ruffled Rush walked outside. This time he was shirtless and his jeans were unbuttoned. I doubted he’d even put on his underwear. He looked like he’d just woken up and realized I was missing and jerked on his jeans to come and find me. His eyes shifted from me to Captain and back. The angry snarl on his face surprised me. He hadn’t seen the man wink at me, had he? “Hello, Abe,” he said in a sleepy voice as he walked over and pulled me against him. Yes, he was definitely asserting his ownership. Why would he feel threatened? Did the man not understand that I was completely obsessed with him? “Rush. Even though I was real happy to see Blaire I’m glad you were smart enough to come get her,” Abe replied. The warning in his tone was unmistakable. He was letting Rush know he didn’t like me feeling second. Rush nodded and pressed his lips to my head. “It won’t happen again,” he told my father. Dad nodded. “Good. Next time I won’t be so understanding,” he told him. “Newlyweds?” Captain asked, still standing there watching us. Rush tensed and I eased closer to him to calm him down. He wanted to be a newlywed. Having another guy question our relationship bothered him. “They’re engaged,” Dad explained. Captain pointed the beer toward me as if he was pointing at my stomach. “Got things a little backwards, don’t you?” The accusation in his voice caused Rush to move before I could stop him. Immediately, he was around me and moving across the boat. I reached out and grabbed Rush’s arm just as his foot hit the step leading out. “Alright, hold it,” Dad said in a loud commanding voice I wasn’t used to hearing him use. “I was gonna wait and explain this to Blaire without a damn audience but it looks like I need to do it now. Since you’ve done gone and pissed Rush off.” He was shooting Captain an annoyed look. What was he talking about? What kind of explanation? Rush stopped moving and glared back at my father. “No one talks to Blaire like that. I don’t give a fuck who he is.” “Wasn’t talking to Blaire. I was talking to you,” Captain drawled in a bored tone and took another swig of his beer. I wrapped both hands around Rush’s arm and held on tight. “That’s enough, boy,” Dad snapped at Captain. I would like to argue that he wasn’t a boy but a man who could very likely hurt my dad without breaking a sweat. I preferred that he stayed friendly with his neighbors. Captain held up both his hands and shrugged. “Fine,” he replied. I was shocked that he backed down so easily. Dad sighed and looked back at me. “You might want to sit back down,” he said. I wasn’t sure I wanted to hear this. Why would I need to sit down? Rush took my seat then pulled me into his lap and wrapped his arms around my waist. Dad looked over at Captain and frowned. He didn’t want to tell me whatever it was that he was about to tell me. That made me nervous. “When I was sixteen I knocked up my high school girlfriend,” he started and I grabbed Rush’s arms and held on tight. “Becca Lynn wasn’t ready to be a momma and I sure as hell wasn’t ready to be a daddy. We agreed to put the baby up for adoption. Becca Lynn’s parents handled the finding of suitable parents for the baby and then she had it and that was it. We didn’t stay together. We’d broken up due to the reality of her pregnancy and what had happened. After graduation she went on to college on the west coast and I went to Georgia. Never saw her again,” my dad said and sighed and studied me a moment before going any further. Rush’s arms had tightened around me and I was holding onto him. I wasn’t sure yet where exactly this was going but I had an idea. “After you and Valerie were born I realized how precious you were. I loved you both so damn much that I broke down one night and told your mother about the baby I’d had with Becca Lynn and given up eight years before. For the first time I was broken up about losing a kid I had thought I didn’t want. Your mother made it her goal to find my child. She looked for years. Everything always led to another dead end. I eventually gave up. She never did.” Dad let out a sad laugh. “Then last year I was contacted by the investigator your mother had hired and he had a lead. I hadn’t been expecting it. I didn’t know what to do with that information. That kid was an adult now. I was sure it was pointless. Then I got another call. My son wanted to meet me.” I turned in Rush’s arms to look at Captain. He was leaning against his boat looking out over the water but he was listening. His body was tense. He was waiting. Was he... did I have a brother? “Everything happened with you and I came clean. I needed to start over. Try to live the rest of my life the right way because all I’d done was fuck it up so far. The only good thing I’d ever done was loving your mother and being blessed with you and Valerie. So, I called my son and came down south to meet him,” he paused and nodded to Captain. “River Joshua Kipling also known as Captain, is your brother.” “Fuck,” Rush whispered and I felt like saying it too. Would my dad’s secrets never end? “Captain was your mother’s last gift to me. If she hadn’t been so determined to find him then I never would have gotten to know him.” My dad wasn’t as alone as I’d thought. I wasn’t angry or hurt. I was... happy. I was relieved. He had a lot in life to atone for. I knew he was atoning for not being the man he should’ve been, by having a relationship with his son. My baby kicked against his father’s hands and I couldn’t imagine handing over this baby. Never to know it or hold it. That had to be like losing a part of yourself. My dad hadn’t been a whole man since he was sixteen. Since he’d given a part of himself away. My heart broke for him and I eased out of Rush’s arms and walked over to my father. I wrapped both arms around his waist and held him. I didn’t have the words just yet to tell him that I was happy for him. I wasn’t sure if those words were even accurate. I was more than happy. I was thankful. It was time for him to heal. This was a part of that. “You okay with this, Blaire bear?” he asked, squeezing me in a hug. “I’m glad you found him,” I replied honestly. For right now that was the only thing I could say. “Thank you.” The emotion in his voice was thick. “Real glad I don’t have to beat your ass for looking at my woman,” I heard Rush say and I smiled against my dad’s chest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-26.html","bookId":1995,"book":{"id":1995,"title":"Forever Too Far (Too Far #3)","description":"Storyline: Forever Too Far (Too Far, #3; Rosemary Beach, #3) Rush promised her forever... but promises can be broken.
