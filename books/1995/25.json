Then I was convincing her to go home with me and marry me immediately. I didn’t want to wait anymore. I shouldn’t have waited this long.\n My plane had landed thirty minutes ahead of schedule. We’d taken off earlier than planned. I didn’t want to wait around until the time I’d told her to be here and I didn’t want her coming to the airport alone. I grabbed a cab and told them to take me to the marina. I’d find Abe’s boat myself. Key West wasn’t a big place. I’d find her before she had time to leave.\n Stepping onto the pier that went between the rows of docked boats I looked for any sign of Blaire or Abe. I’d called her but it had gone straight to voicemail. There were sailboats, fishing boats, and even houseboats docked in this place. Several of them had people living aboard. I was getting close to the end when I saw a guy standing near the back of his boat. He had his arms crossed over his bare chest as he stared over at the boat next to him. I started to ask him if he knew where Abe Wynn’s boat was when I followed his gaze.\n Long blonde hair hung down her back and blew carelessly in the wind. The familiar sundress she was wearing was a favorite of hers lately because it was one of the few things that still fit her. The small stomach that had developed over the past weeks was taking up more room and the length on it was shorter than I preferred. Taking in the sight of her I felt whole again... until I realized that she was what the shirtless guy was staring at. She didn’t realize it because her back was turned and she was looking out at the clear blue water as the setting sun set off an array of colors. But I saw it.\n My inner caveman wanted to go jerk him off his boat and throw his ass in the water. I couldn’t do that though. As pissed off as it made me to know he was looking at what was mine, I understood why. She was breathtaking. I wanted to stop and stare at her too.\n I took the other caveman route and headed straight for her father’s boat and jumped in then pulled her into my arms before she could spin around to see who it was.\n “Rush,” she said in a contented sigh and the caveman felt like pounding on his chest. She knew it was me. I loved that. I buried my nose in the crook of her neck and inhaled deeply. She smelled so damn good. Today her sweet smell was mixed with the sea. I wanted to strip her naked and find out if she smelled like the sea everywhere else too.\n I placed both my hands over her stomach just to remind myself that our baby was still okay. He was healthy and Blaire was fine. Every time I thought about her bleeding and cramping my heart felt as if it had stopped. I’d basically abandoned her the last few days trying to get Nan under control so I could leave. My last words to Blaire had been harsh and that was all I could think about when I’d found her gone. Had my words made her cramp? I didn’t deserve her but I wasn’t going to let her go. “I’m sorry. God, Blaire, I am so damn sorry. I love you. This will never happen again,” I promised even though the words sounded familiar to my ears. I winced, realizing I’d said this before. I should have never gone to LA. “I love you,” she replied simply.\n “I love you too,” I replied holding her as we stood there watching the sunset over the water.\n When the dusk was finally settling down around us I bent my head down to her ear. “Is there a hotel we could sleep in tonight? I’m gonna need you and it won’t be quiet.”\n Blaire turned around in my arms and slipped her arms around my waist. Her green eyes were twinkling with amusement. “I can be quiet,” she replied.\n I reached up and tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, then traced her jawline before feeling her soft plump bottom lip. “I can’t. “\n A pleased smile pulled up each corner of her mouth and she stood on her tiptoes to press a kiss to my mouth. “You can whisper your naughty words in my ear,” she replied.\n I pulled her bottom lip into my mouth and sucked on it before slipping my tongue inside her mouth to taste her. She clung to my arms, and moaned softly, and swayed into me. Fuck, no way was I gonna be quiet tonight. “Unless you want your daddy hearing me groan from the sweet taste of your pussy and cry out your name when I come inside you then we need a fucking hotel.”\n Blaire pressed her body closer to mine and another moan escaped her. “God, Rush. I swear, if you keep talking like that I’m gonna have an orgasm right here.”\n I cupped her ass and pulled her up against me before covering her mouth with mine again. If she was that swollen and turned on that words could get her off then I was going to fucking make that happen.\n A loud cough caused Blaire to freeze in my arms, then she slowly eased back from me and peeked over my shoulder. Her cheeks turned bright pink and she ducked her head into my chest. The fact she was burying herself against me was the only thing that kept me from losing it. I didn’t like the idea that him seeing us together embarrassed her.\n I glanced back over my shoulder to see the guy who’d been watching her when I walked up. Having Blaire in my arms again had made me forget all about everything around us. Not that it would have mattered. I wanted him to know she was mine. I wanted everyone to know.\n “Thought y’all might wanna get a room,” the guy said with a smirk and lit a cigarette.\n “We’re just fine. Maybe you need to find another direction to look in,” I replied. I made sure the warning was in my voice.\n The guy chuckled and blew a puff of smoke. “Watching the sun set is my thing. Shame if a guy can’t watch something that beautiful from his own boat.”\n The flicker in his eyes as he glanced down at Blaire in my arms made my blood boil. Blaire must have felt me tense up because she instantly flattened herself against me and pressed a kiss to my chest. “Let’s go inside. I want some alone time with you,” she said, just loud enough for me to hear.\n I looked back down at her and relaxed. She was mine. I needed to calm the fuck down. “Lead the way.”\n Blaire grabbed both my arms and pulled me into the small kitchen. I could see the door that led down into the boat and the idea of getting tucked away down there with Blaire was pretty damn appealing. “How much longer until your dad gets home?” I asked walking her back toward the stairs.\n “Not sure,” she replied with a giggle.\n “Does that bedroom have a door with a lock?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-25.html","bookId":1995,"book":{"id":1995,"title":"Forever Too Far (Too Far #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Forever Too Far (Too Far, #3; Rosemary Beach, #3) \n Rush promised her forever... but promises can be broken. \n Torn between his love for his family and his love for Blaire, Rush has to find a way to save one without losing the other.
