Nan started threatening to off herself and I panicked. I was in big brother mode.” He was always in big brother mode with Nan. Coming here I knew I was in for a lot of Nan but it was harder than I’d imagined. Especially after the way she’d treated me last night. I didn’t believe for a minute that she’d kill herself. “She’s manipulating you. I hate to see her do that.” Rush stood up and ran his hand through his hair and walked over to the window. He didn’t agree with me. I could tell by the stiff way he was holding his shoulders. He looked defensive. “She’s upset and hurt. I know she’s been a bitch to you in the past but right now I need you. For me, could you not say hurtful things to her? I’m really worried about her mental stability at the moment.” Hurtful things? I hadn’t said anything to Nan. Did he think I was going to? “I was the one who said we should come. I understand she needs your help. Why would you think that I would say hurtful things to her?” I asked, standing up. Rush let his head fall back and he closed his eyes tightly like he really didn’t want to be having this conversation. Something was wrong. “I know what you said to her last night at the table. She told me. And yeah, you have every right to say those things to her but right now I just need you not to. The sooner I can fix this the sooner we head back to Rosemary and leave this nightmare.” “What did I say to her last night at the table? I’m not following you,” I replied feeling a sick knot in my stomach. Was Nan lying about me? She was the one who had said hurtful things at the table. Not me. “She feels like you made fun of her. Just ... it’s probably best if you just don’t talk to her.” I sat back down on the bed and let last night’s conversations run through my head. How did she feel like I’d made fun of her? She’d attacked me. A soft knock on the door interrupted what I was about to say and Rush let out a frustrated growl before stalking over to open it. “Sorry. I don’t want to disturb y’all but Nan is demanding to know what room is Daddy’s. She doesn’t need to wake him up. That would be bad,” Harlow’s soft-spoken voice sounded anxious. “Shit,” Rush muttered. He glanced back at me. “I’m sorry. I’ll be back in a few minutes. Just go back to bed and get some rest. I won’t let anyone else disturb you.” Once the door was closed I let the tears fall. When I’d told him to come deal with Nan I’d thought this would be easier. I had hoped after her accident and her comment about being a part of the baby’s life that she’d be more manageable. I was wrong. Coming here had been a bad idea. My stomach cramped and I froze. I sat still and waited on the baby to kick and reassure me everything was okay. Nothing happened. I put both my hands on my stomach and the cramp came again. Wincing I tried to calm my heart as it started to race. Something was wrong. A wave of nausea hit me and I laid back and closed my eyes. Maybe I’d gotten up too quick this morning. I needed to start being more careful. All the high-strung tension in this house was getting to me. I closed my eyes and took slow deep breaths. No more cramps came and I felt a soft kick against my hand. With that little bit of reassurance I drifted off to sleep. When I opened my eyes the sun had moved and was shinning brightly through the windows. It had to be after lunch. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was one. I must have been more tired than I thought. I rolled over to get up and a tray of food was sitting on a small table beside the bed. I wrapped the sheet around me and went over to it. I smiled as I picked up the small note with Rush’s familiar scrawl on it. I’m sorry about this morning. You were exhausted and I unloaded on you. None of this is your fault. I just want to get it all over with and get you back home. Eat something. I’m going to go see if I can talk to Kiro. I love you more than life, Rush. I picked up the silver cover that had been protecting my plate to find fresh strawberries and cream, salmon, and a slice of toast. My stomach still wasn’t feeling that great so I decided to stay away from the salmon but I took a strawberry and dipped it into the cream before taking a bite. The sweet taste hit my tongue and I felt better. Sitting on the edge of the bed, I finished all the strawberries and toast before getting up and going to get a shower.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-18.html","bookId":1995,"book":{"id":1995,"title":"Forever Too Far (Too Far #3)","description":"Storyline: Forever Too Far (Too Far, #3; Rosemary Beach, #3) Rush promised her forever... but promises can be broken.
