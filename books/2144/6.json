The catacombs were filled with vampires--lurking, thirsting, hungering, stalking--hidden behind archways and in full view. Suddenly I was surrounded by a gang of vampire clubsters. The dance floor was converted into a medieval baptism of sorts. A covered coffin was lying in the center of the dirt dance floor enclosed by six-foot-high candelabras. At the helm, two hooded members were holding court in ornate hand-carved thrones fit for vampire kings. Clubsters began chanting, New blood, new blood.\\n\\n What`s going on? I asked. I finally found Onyx and Scarlet in the crowd of chanting vampires.\\n\\n We`re initiating a new member, Onyx revealed excitedly.\\n\\n My stomach caved in. I wasn`t ready to bear witness to someone going under the fang.\\n\\n Who? I asked.\\n\\n Scarlet laughed. It`s you! The crowd turned to me and all of a sudden clubsters were lifting me up and passing me over them like I was Queen of the Mosh Pit.\\n\\n The clubsters continued to chant, New blood, new blood.\\n\\n I did my best to fight off the sea of black and bloodred-fingernailed hands, but two fists and two combat-booted feet didn`t stand a chance against the force of a crowd of hungry vampires.\\n\\n I`m not ready! I cried. I`m waiting for Alexander!\\n\\n Before I knew it, they lowered me onto the coffin and held my arms at bay, red-eyed vampires chanting, New blood, new blood around me.\\n\\n Get off! I cried, but the clubsters held my arms and legs tightly. I noticed two familiar faces in the crowd around me--Primus and Poison.\\n\\n Primus! Poison! I called to them. Tell them I`m not ready to join!\\n\\n We told you the Coffin Club had changed, Primus said.\\n\\n You should have stayed with us, but instead you got curious and opened the Dungeon door, Poison said. Now we are members, too! She flashed her fangs at me.\\n\\n A pair of cloaked members arose from their thrones and approached me. The smaller one held a goblet with one hand and with his other dipped his fingers into the cup. Then, like dripping wax, he drizzled the warm liquid on my neck, making soft strokes, marking me with a bloody X.\\n\\n No, I cried. Get off of me!\\n\\n The vampire took off his hood. All I saw was white hair and two red eyes. It was Jagger.\\n\\n I turned away. There in the crowd staring straight back at me was Alexander. I sensed his disappointment in finding me here in the Coffin Club. I reached out, but he backed away and disappeared into the crowd.\\n\\n The other hooded member approached me. A gold-fanged female unveiled his hood and jagged purple hair flopped out.\\n\\n Phoenix grinned a menacing grin, his fangs as sharp as knives. He leaned into me and plunged his teeth into my neck.\\n\\n No! I tried to cry, but I was voiceless.\\n\\n I awoke with a gasp, in a pool of perspiration, my hands around my neck.\\n\\n Multicolored Grateful Dead bear figures danced on the fireplace mantel. An African drum lay next to an antique rocker. Light from the window shone through as the sun began rising over the trees. I was out of breath, but I sighed with relief. I was locked away safe in my aunt`s apartment, lying on the futon in her living room, underneath the sun`s blanket of protection. I yanked the comforter over my head and tried desperately to fall asleep and dream of the only vampire I trusted, Alexander Sterling.\\n\\n That afternoon I was hanging out in a pair of sweats at Aunt Libby`s breakfast table and nursing a cup of coffee when I heard the jostling of keys outside my aunt`s door.\\n\\n Aunt Libby entered with her Happy Homes blazer and a few bags of groceries.\\n\\n I`d ask you what you want to do today, she said as I helped her bring them to the kitchen, but the day is almost over. So how about tonight?\\n\\n Well...\\n\\n I`m sure you`re still tired from yesterday, so if you want to stay in...\\n\\n When Alexander and I were in the manor house having dinner the night before, he`d promised me that he`d take me to the Coffin Club tonight. I didn`t want to ditch Aunt Libby, and though I was still freaked out about my nightmare of the vampire-filled Dungeon, I was still dying to see Alexander and fulfill my dream of dancing together at the Coffin Club.\\n\\n However, my aunt was holding out for my response, and I already have plans was not what she was waiting to hear. Here I was, staying at her house, eating her food, and I`d become so selfish that I was making plans without her.\\n\\n Whatever you want to do, I finally said. The night is yours.\\n\\n But instead of answering, Aunt Libby continued to unload the groceries.\\n\\n We can see a movie, I suggested. Go to a jazz club. Visit some boutiques.\\n\\n Still, my aunt wasn`t as excited as I`d thought she`d be at my ideas.\\n\\n Or if you have something else...\\n\\n I do have something else, she said anxiously.\\n\\n Then we can do that.\\n\\n It`s a date.\\n\\n A date? With Devon?\\n\\n She nodded. I`m a terrible aunt, she said. Devon called me at lunch today. He asked me out for tonight and before I knew it I had said yes.\\n\\n That`s okay.\\n\\n No, it was the wrong thing to do. I`ll call and cancel, she said, reaching for her cordless phone on the kitchen counter.\\n\\n Don`t even think about it, I said, seizing it first.\\n\\n Then you`ll have to come.\\n\\n Are you kidding? On your first date? Even I know that would be a disaster.\\n\\n Please, I can`t leave you behind again. A sixteen-year-old doesn`t want to hang out at her aunt`s apartment alone. I know that`s why you snuck out last night and showed up at my class--because you were bored.\\n\\n A sixteen-year-old also doesn`t want to go on a date with her aunt and her new beau, either, I thought but couldn`t say. I won`t be bored tonight. I promise. I have summer reading I can get a head start on.\\n\\n She raised her eyebrow. You are getting to be more like your father than I thought you were.\\n\\n Or at least Billy Boy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-coffin-club-vampire-kisses-5/page-6.html","bookId":2144,"book":{"id":2144,"title":"The Coffin Club (Vampire Kisses #5)","description":"Storyline: The Coffin Club (Vampire Kisses #5) \\n When Raven returns to Hipsterville\u0027s cryptic goth haunt, the Coffin Club, she discovers a secret door to another disco-\"The Dungeon\"-that is inhabited by vampires only.
