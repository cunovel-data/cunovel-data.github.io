I`d come here to Hipsterville for one reason only--to reunite with my boyfriend. However, once I`d gotten my wish, I`d defied his one request--I had returned to the Coffin Club without him.\\n\\n Not only did I discover an intoxicating and dangerous underground world of vampires in the Dungeon, I had been one bite away from belonging to the Underworld for eternity--all without my beloved Alexander.\\n\\n After falling in love with Alexander, it wasn`t just that I wanted to become a vampire--I wanted to become one together.\\n\\n Yet I immersed myself in a world that my own boyfriend himself felt like an outsider in. Was that what Alexander wanted for me? Or for himself?\\n\\n I coasted downhill and replayed the last week in my head. I thought I was being investigative and mature when perhaps I was only being reckless.\\n\\n And if Alexander ever found out about my Dungeon adventures, I wanted him to hear it from my own lips. I wanted him to know that if and when I became immortal, he`d be the one on the other side of my neck.\\n\\n I felt as if I`d betrayed Alexander. I was ashamed and disappointed in myself. I had to confess to Alexander all that I`d done. I had to let him know I`d been so close to joining his world but that without him it meant nothing.\\n\\n Alexander was right to buy me a ticket out of town. He always knew what was best for me, and I`d taken the wrong path. Instead of taking a turn to head to Aunt Libby`s, I veered left toward Lennox Hill. It began to rain.\\n\\n I sped through the growing puddles and steered through the long street to the cul-de-sac that the manor house sat on.\\n\\n I pedaled up the driveway and leaned the Schwinn against a small gate. I ran along the uneven rock path and banged against the front door.\\n\\n No one answered. I stood back. I didn`t see anyone lurking in the main room or attic room windows. Lightning flashed as I ran alongside the house and around to the back door. I pounded my fists on the door, droplets of rainwater bouncing off.\\n\\n I climbed on top of a discarded box and peeked in the kitchen window. There were no signs of dishes, plates, flowers, or anything resembling the living. The already empty-looking manor now appeared totally vacant. Frustrated, I ran through the unkempt gardens infested with overgrown weeds. I tried to peer into Alexander`s attic window, but from my vantage point I couldn`t get a clear view.\\n\\n One thing had changed. There was no curtain in the window.\\n\\n My heart sank. I kicked the corner of the wooden bench.\\n\\n I had one last shot. I hurried to the garage. The lock had been removed and the door was slightly ajar. When I opened the garage door I was shocked--the Mercedes was gone.\\n\\n That meant one thing--Alexander and Jameson had already left the manor house.\\n\\n I wouldn`t be able to fall into Alexander`s arms and tell him about my terrifying night or explain that I didn`t want to become a member of the real Coffin Club without him.\\n\\n For now, my confession would have to wait.\\n\\n I unhinged the Dungeon skeleton key from my key ring and symbolically placed it on the floor of the garage.\\n\\n A streak of lightning lit the sky and I saw something in the garage sparkle. I inched forward to examine it more closely as the thunder crashed around me. I caught a glimpse of something behind a hanging sheet hidden in the shadows. Perhaps it was a coffin or mirrors from the manor house. Protruding from the sheet and catching the moonlight was a shiny silver exhaust pipe.\\n\\n I inched closer. I pulled back the sheet to reveal whatever was being hidden. I stepped back in disbelief. Chrome frame. Handlebars. It was a motorcycle.\\n\\n What on earth was it doing here? Maybe Alexander had bought a Night Rod after admiring the bike outside the club.\\n\\n But I felt heat emanating from the motorcycle as if it had just been ridden.\\n\\n I took a long breath and discovered something sweet permeating the air. It was the smell of Obsession.\\n\\n I sensed a familiar presence standing behind me. I glimpsed down at the floor behind me. A shiny motorcycle boot was blocking me.\\n\\n I spun around and gasped.\\n\\n Alexander was looking at me, his soft chocolate eyes staring soulfully into mine. He was wearing a leather motorcycle jacket and pants and holding a purple wig and sunglasses in one hand.\\n\\n I stood frozen.\\n\\n My eyes welled up.\\n\\n It was you all along. I wiped a tear away from my cheek. It was you who saved the Coffin Club--and me.\\n\\n Alexander pulled off his motorcycle gloves and extended his hand, his spider ring almost glowing.\\n\\n He pulled me into him and wrapped his arms around my waist.\\n\\n This is why you had to stay in Hipsterville so long? I asked. Not for the art festival but for the Dungeon?\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n But why the disguise? I asked.\\n\\n Jagger and I finally had come to a truce. Not only was it important to me--but to my family. If he noticed I was in the Dungeon, he would have known that once I`d heard his real intention for the club, I`d try to thwart his plan. I know it sounds strange, but I found it comforting knowing that Jagger and I were no longer nemeses. If I`d shown my face, I`d risk restoring another feud. But someone needed to stop him. And since I couldn`t, I had to find someone who could.\\n\\n I gazed up at Alexander, realizing for the first time why I`d been so drawn to Phoenix.\\n\\n It`s time to return home, together, he replied, and kissed me with the intensity of two very mysterious vampires. Then he licked his lips and flashed his fangs and grinned. For eternity. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-coffin-club-vampire-kisses-5/page-14.html","bookId":2144,"book":{"id":2144,"title":"The Coffin Club (Vampire Kisses #5)","description":"Storyline: The Coffin Club (Vampire Kisses #5) \\n When Raven returns to Hipsterville\u0027s cryptic goth haunt, the Coffin Club, she discovers a secret door to another disco-\"The Dungeon\"-that is inhabited by vampires only.
