{"id":109560,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Harry didn\u0027t have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard. Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge...why hadn\u0027t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry\u0027s parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them? Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they\u0027d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn\u0027t want Fred and George asking him whether he\u0027d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until ... He stopped on a picture of his parents\u0027 wedding day. There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there...that must be him. Their best man...Harry had never given him a thought before. If he hadn\u0027t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn\u0027t sunken and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him unrecognizable? But the Dementors don\u0027t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn\u0027t have to hear my Mum screaming if they get too close -- Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view. The dormitory door opened. \"Harry?\" said Ron\u0027s voice uncertainly. But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes wide open. A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black\u0027s voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter. \"It has happened, My Lord...the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper\" and then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the Dementors drew near.... \"Harry, you -- you look terrible.\" Harry hadn\u0027t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spread her homework over three tables. \"Where is everyone?\" said Harry. \"Gone! It\u0027s the first day of the holidays, remember?\" said Ron, watching Harry closely. \"It\u0027s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute.\" Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug. \"You really don\u0027t look well, you know,\" Hermione said, peering anxiously into his face. \"I\u0027m fine,\" said Harry. \"Harry, listen,\" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, \"you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn\u0027t go doing anything stupid.\" \"Like what?\" said Harry. \"Like trying to go after Black,\" said Ron sharply. Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep. He didn\u0027t say anything. \"You won\u0027t, will you, Harry?\" said Hermione. \"Because Black\u0027s not worth dying for,\" said Ron. Harry looked at them. They didn\u0027t seem to understand at all. \"D\u0027you know what I see and hear every time a Dementor gets too near me?\" Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. \"I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you\u0027d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn\u0027t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --\" \"There\u0027s nothing you can do!\" said Hermione, looking stricken. \"The Dementors will catch Black and he\u0027ll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve him right!\" \"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn\u0027t affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It\u0027s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.\" \"So what are you saying?\" said Ron, looking very tense. \"You want to -- to kill Black or something?\" \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" said Hermione in a panicky voice. \"Harry doesn\u0027t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?\" Again, Harry didn\u0027t answer. He didn\u0027t know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand. \"Malfoy knows,\" he said abruptly. \"Remember what he said to me in Potions? \u0027If it was me, I\u0027d hunt him down myself...I\u0027d want revenge.\u0027\" \"You\u0027re going to take Malfoy\u0027s advice instead of ours?\" said Ron furiously. \"Listen...you know what Pettigrew\u0027s mother got back after Black had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew\u0027s finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find. Black\u0027s a madman, Harry, and he\u0027s dangerous --\" \"Malfoy\u0027s dad must have told him,\" said Harry, ignoring Ron. \"He was right in Voldemort\u0027s inner circle --\" \"Say You-Know-Who, will you?\" interjected Ron angrily. \"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --\" \"-- and Malfoy\u0027d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy\u0027s just hoping you\u0027ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch.\" \"Harry, please,\" said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, \"Please be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don\u0027t put yourself in danger, it\u0027s what Black wants...Oh, Harry, you\u0027d be playing right into Black\u0027s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn\u0027t want you to get hurt, would they? They\u0027d never want you to go looking for Black!\" \"I\u0027ll never know what they\u0027d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I\u0027ve never spoken to them,\" said Harry shortly. There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws. Ron\u0027s pocket quivered. \"Look,\" said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject, \"it\u0027s the holidays! It\u0027s nearly Christmas! Let\u0027s -- let\u0027s go down and see Hagrid. We haven\u0027t visited him for ages!\" \"No!\" said Hermione quickly. \"Harry isn\u0027t supposed to leave the castle, Ron --\" \"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" said Harry, sitting up, \"and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!\" Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn\u0027t what Ron had had in mind. \"Or we could have a game of chess,\" he said hastily, \"or Gobstones. Percy left a set --\" \"No, let\u0027s visit Hagrid,\" said Harry firmly. So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole (\"Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!\"), down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors. They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid\u0027s cabin looked like an iced cake. Ron knocked, but there was no answer. \"He\u0027s not out, is he?\" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak. Ron had his ear to the door. \"There\u0027s a weird noise,\" he said. \"Listen -- is that Fang?\" Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans. \"Think we\u0027d better go and get someone?\" said Ron nervously. \"Hagrid!\" called Harry, thumping the door. \"Hagrid, are you in there?\" There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his leather vest. \"You\u0027ve heard?\" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry\u0027s neck. Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid\u0027s weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard. \"Hagrid, what is it?\" said Hermione, aghast. Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table. \"What\u0027s this, Hagrid?\" Hagrid\u0027s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mr. Hagrid, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a Hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident. \"Well, that\u0027s okay then, Hagrid!\" said Ron, clapping Hagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on. However, we must register our concern about the Hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April 20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your Hippogriff at the Committee\u0027s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the Hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship ... There followed a list of the school governors. \"Oh,\" said Ron. \"But you said Buckbeak isn\u0027t a bad Hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he\u0027ll get off.\" \"Yeh don\u0027 know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o\u0027 Dangerous Creatures!\" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. \"They\u0027ve got it in fer interestin\u0027 creatures!\" A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid\u0027s cabin made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the Hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor. \"I couldn\u0027 leave him tied up out there in the snow!\" choked Hagrid. \"All on his own! At Christmas.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called \u0027interesting creatures\u0027 and other people called \u0027terrifying monsters.\u0027 On the other hand, there didn\u0027t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid\u0027s usual standards, he was positively cute. \"You\u0027ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,\" said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid\u0027s massive forearm. \"I\u0027m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.\" \"Won\u0027 make no diff\u0027rence!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Them Disposal devils, they\u0027re all in Lucius Malfoy\u0027s pocket! Scared o\u0027 him! Ad if I lose the case, Buckbeak --\" Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his arms. \"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"He\u0027s done more\u0027n enough fer me already,\" groaned Hagrid. \"Got enough on his plate what with keepin\u0027 them Dementors outta the castle, an\u0027 Sirius Black lurkin\u0027 around.\" Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn\u0027t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so miserable and scared. \"Listen, Hagrid,\" he said, \"you can\u0027t give up. Hermione\u0027s right, You just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --\" \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve read about a case of Hippogriff-baiting,\" said Hermione thoughtfully, \"where the Hippogriff got off. I\u0027ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.\" Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to help them. \"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?\" said Ron. Harry stared at him. \"It\u0027s what my mum does whenever someone\u0027s upset,\" Ron muttered, shrugging. At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said, \"Yer right. I can\u0027 afford to go ter pieces. Gotta pull meself together...\" Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on Hagrid\u0027s knee. \"I\u0027ve not bin meself lately,\" said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other. \"Worried abou\u0027 Buckbeak, an\u0027 no one likin\u0027 me classes --\" \"We do like them!\" lied Hermione at once. \"Yeah, they\u0027re great!\" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table. \"Er -- how are the flobberworms?\" \"Dead,\" said Hagrid gloomily. \"Too much lettuce.\" \"Oh no!\" said Ron, his lip twitching. \"An\u0027 them Dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an\u0027 all,\" said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. \"Gotta walk past \u0027em ev\u0027ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. \u0027S like bein\u0027 back in Azkaban --\" He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, \"Is it awful in there, Hagrid?\" \"Yeh\u0027ve no idea,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Never bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin\u0027 mad. Kep\u0027 goin\u0027 over horrible stuff in me mind...the day I got expelled from Hogwarts...day me dad died...day I had ter let Norbert go ...\" His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards. \"Yeh can\u0027 really remember who yeh are after a while. An\u0027 yeh can\u0027 really see the point o\u0027 livin\u0027 at all. I used ter hope I\u0027d jus\u0027 die in me sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein\u0027 born again, ev\u0027rythin\u0027 came floodin\u0027 back, it was the bes\u0027 feelin\u0027 in the world. Mind, the Dementors weren\u0027t keen on lettin\u0027 me go.\" \"But you were innocent!\" said Hermione. Hagrid snorted. \"Think that matters to them? They don\u0027 care. Long as they\u0027ve got a couple o\u0027 hundred humans stuck there with \u0027em, so they can leech all the happiness out of \u0027em, they don\u0027 give a damn who\u0027s guilty an\u0027 who\u0027s not.\" Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said quietly, \"Thought o\u0027 jus\u0027 letting Buckbeak go ...tryin\u0027 ter make him fly away...but how d\u0027yeh explain ter a Hippogriff it\u0027s gotta go inter hidin\u0027? An\u0027 -- an\u0027 I\u0027m scared o\u0027 breakin\u0027 the law...\" He looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again. \"I don\u0027 ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.\" ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* The trip to Hagrid\u0027s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn\u0027t brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts, speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant. \"Here\u0027s something...there was a case in 1722...but the Hippogriff was convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that\u0027s disgusting --\" \"This might help, look -- a Manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they let the Manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it...\" Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron\u0027s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air. On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him. \"Oy! Presents!\" Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents. \"Another sweater from Mum...maroon again...see if you\u0027ve got one.\" Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath. \"What\u0027s that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand. \"Dunno...\" Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" he said hoarsely. It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail. \"Who sent it to you?\" said Ron in a hushed voice. \"Look and see if there\u0027s a card,\" said Harry. Ron ripped apart the Firebolt\u0027s wrappings. \"Nothing! Blimey, who\u0027d spend that much on you?\" \"Well,\" said Harry, feeling stunned, \"I\u0027m betting it wasn\u0027t the Dursleys.\" \"I bet it was Dumbledore,\" said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \"He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously...\" \"That was my dad\u0027s, though,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He wouldn\u0027t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can\u0027t go giving students stuff like this --\" \"That\u0027s why he wouldn\u0027t say it was from him!\" said Ron. \"In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry --\" Ron gave a great whoop of laughter -- \"Malfoy! Wait \u0027til he sees you on this! He\u0027ll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\" \"I can\u0027t believe this,\" Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry\u0027s bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. \"Who--?\" \"I know,\" said Ron, controlling himself, \"I know who it could\u0027ve been -- Lupin!\" \"What?\" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself \"Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he\u0027d be able to buy himself some new robes.\" \"Yeah, but he likes you,\" said Ron. \"And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might\u0027ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you --\" \"What d\u0027you mean, he was away?\" said Harry. \"He was ill when I was playing in that match.\" \"Well, he wasn\u0027t in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\" Harry frowned at Ron. \"I can\u0027t see Lupin affording something like this.\" \"What\u0027re you two laughing about?\" Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck. \"Don\u0027t bring him in here!\" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione wasn\u0027t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus\u0027s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt. \"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\" \"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn\u0027t a card or anything with it.\" To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" said Ron. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it\u0027s a bit odd, isn\u0027t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn\u0027t it?\" Ron sighed exasperatedly. \"It\u0027s the best broom there is, Hermione,\" he said. \"So it must\u0027ve been really expensive...\" \"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins\u0027 brooms put together,\" said Ron happily. \"Well...who\u0027d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they\u0027d sent it?\" said Hermione. \"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\" \"I don\u0027t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione shrilly. Harry and Ron looked at her. \"What d\u0027you think Harry\u0027s going to do with it -- sweep the floor?\" said Ron. But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus\u0027s bed, right at Ron\u0027s chest. \"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!\" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks\u0027s claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry\u0027s bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain. Crookshanks\u0027s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny, whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon\u0027s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor. \"I forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. \"I never wear those socks if I can help it...\" The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it. \"You\u0027d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry\u0027s bed nursing his toe. \"Can\u0027t you shut that thing up?\" he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks\u0027s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron. Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron\u0027s stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron\u0027s hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron\u0027s pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too. \"He\u0027s not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said. \"It\u0027s stress!\" said Ron. \"He\u0027d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!\" But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn\u0027t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron\u0027s frequent complaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died. Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks\u0027s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn\u0027t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat. At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year. \"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. \"As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables...Sit down, sit down!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table. \"Crackers!\" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large, pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture. Harry, remembering the Boggart, caught Ron\u0027s eye and they both grinned; Snape\u0027s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard\u0027s hat at once. \"Dig in!\" he advised the table, beaming around. As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly. \"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!\" said Dumbledore, standing up. \"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,\" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, \"and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness...\" \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Let me draw you up a chair --\" And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream. \"I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!\" \"We\u0027ll risk it, Sibyll,\" said Professor McGonagall impatiently. \"Do sit down, the turkey\u0027s getting stone cold.\" Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. \"Tripe, Sibyll?\" Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, \"But where is dear Professor Lupin?\" \"I\u0027m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. \"Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.\" \"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised. Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look. \"Certainly I knew, Minerva,\" she said quietly. \"But one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\" \"That explains a great deal,\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. Professor Trelawney\u0027s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty. \"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --\" \"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly. \"I doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney\u0027s conversation, \"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you\u0027ve made the potion for him again?\" \"Yes, Headmaster,\" said Snape. \"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"Then he should be up and about in no time...Derek, have you had any of the chipolatas? They\u0027re excellent.\" The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands. Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later. Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats, Harry and Ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly. \"My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?\" \"Dunno,\" said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry. \"I doubt it will make much difference,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, \"unless a mad axe-man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the Entrance Hall.\" Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly affronted. \"Coming?\" Harry said to Hermione. \"No,\" Hermione muttered. \"I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall.\" \"Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,\" yawned Ron as they make their way into the Entrance Hall, which was completely devoid of mad axe-men. When they reached the portrait hole they found Sir Cadogan enjoying a Christmas part with a couple of monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor toasted them with a flagon of mead. \"Merry -- hic -- Christmas! Password?\" \"Scurvy cur,\" said Ron. \"And the same to you, sir! roared Sir Cadogan, as the painting swung forward to admit them. Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected his Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do with the Firebolt; however, there where no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle, until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Though Professor McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor House, Harry had only seen her in the common room once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it. \"So that\u0027s it, is it?\" said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. \"Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.\" Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside-down. \"May I?\" said Professor McGonagall, but she didn\u0027t wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. \"Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?\" \"No,\" said Harry blankly. \"I see...\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Well, I\u0027m afraid I will have to take this, Potter.\" \"W -- what?\" said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \"Why?\" \"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of course, I\u0027m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down --\" \"Strip it down?\" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. \"It shouldn\u0027t take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\" \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with it!\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \"Honestly, Professor --\" \"You can\u0027t know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \"not until you\u0027ve flown it, at any rate, and I\u0027m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.\" Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. \"What did you go running to McGonagall for?\" Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly. \"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-11.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
