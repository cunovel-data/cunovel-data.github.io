{"id":109566,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Harry\u0027s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.\\n\\n \"Hagrid,\" Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t,\" said Ron, who was paper-white. \"He\u0027ll be in worse trouble if they know we\u0027ve been to see him....\"\\n\\n Hermione\u0027s breathing was shallow and uneven.\\n\\n \"How -- could -- they?\" she choked. \"How could they?\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.\\n\\n They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.\\n\\n By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell around them.\\n\\n \"Scabbers, keep still,\" Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, You stupid rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!\"\\n\\n \"Ron, be quiet!\" Hermione whispered urgently. \"Fudge\u0027ll be out here in a minute --\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t -- stay -- put --\"\\n\\n Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might, trying to break free of Ron\u0027s grip.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\"\\n\\n But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks. Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers\u0027s squeaks, Harry couldn\u0027t tell.\\n\\n \"Crookshanks!\" Hermione moaned. \"No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!\"\\n\\n But the cat was getting nearer --\\n\\n \"Scabbers -- NO!\"\\n\\n Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron\u0027s clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.\\n\\n \"Ron!\" Hermione moaned.\\n\\n She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.\\n\\n \"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\\n\\n There was a loud thud.\\n\\n \"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\\n\\n Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.\\n\\n \"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --\" Hermione panted. \"Dumbledore -- the Minister -- they\u0027ll be coming back out in a minute --\"\\n\\n But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws.... Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.\\n\\n Harry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth -\\n\\n But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.\\n\\n Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog\u0027s jaws fastened instead around Ron\u0027s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute\u0027s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --\\n\\n Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.\\n\\n Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes\\n\\n \"Lumos!\" he whispered.\\n\\n The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.\\n\\n And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight --\\n\\n \"Ron!\" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again.\\n\\n All they could see now was one of Ron\u0027s legs, which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground -- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron\u0027s leg had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.\\n\\n \"Harry -- we\u0027ve got to go for help --\" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.\\n\\n \"No! That thing\u0027s big enough to eat him; we haven\u0027t got time --\"\\n\\n \"Harry -- we\u0027re never going to get through without help --\"\\n\\n Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.\\n\\n \"If that dog can get in, we can,\" Harry panted, darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn\u0027t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the tree\u0027s blows.\\n\\n \"Oh, help, help,\" Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, \"Please...\"\\n\\n Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\\n\\n Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\\n\\n \"Crookshanks!\" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\u0027s arm painfully hard. \"How did he know --?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s friends with that dog,\" said Harry grimly. \"I\u0027ve seen them together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --\"\\n\\n They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry\u0027s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Ron?\" she whispered in a terrified voice.\\n\\n \"This way,\" said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.\\n\\n \"Where does this tunnel come out?\" Hermione asked breathlessly from behind him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know...It\u0027s marked on the Marauder\u0027s Map but Fred and George said no one\u0027s ever gotten into it...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...\"\\n\\n They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them, Crookshanks\u0027s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes... All Harry could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him...He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a crouch....\\n\\n And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Ahead Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.\\n\\n He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond.\\n\\n It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all boarded up.\\n\\n Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.\\n\\n Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\u0027s arm again. Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows.\\n\\n \"Harry,\" she whispered, \"I think we\u0027re in the Shrieking Shack.\"\\n\\n Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.\\n\\n \"Ghosts didn\u0027t do that,\" he said slowly.\\n\\n At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione\u0027s grip on Harry\u0027s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.\\n\\n Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs.\\n\\n They reached the dark landing.\\n\\n \"Nox,\" they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod.\\n\\n Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.\\n\\n On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.\\n\\n Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.\\n\\n \"Ron -- are you okay?\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the dog?\"\\n\\n \"Not a dog,\" Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. \"Harry, it\u0027s a trap --\"\\n\\n \"What --\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the dog...he\u0027s an Animagus.\"\\n\\n Ron was staring over Harry\u0027s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.\\n\\n A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn\u0027t been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black.\\n\\n \"Expelliarmus!\" he croaked, pointing Ron\u0027s wand at them.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d come and help your friend,\" he said hoarsely.\\n\\n His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it. \"Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you not to run for a teacher. I\u0027m grateful...it will make everything much easier....\"\\n\\n The taunt about his father rang in Harry\u0027s ears as though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry\u0027s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack...to kill. Without knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back... \"No, Harry!\" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.\\n\\n \"If you want to kill Harry, you\u0027ll have to kill us too!\" he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\\n\\n Something flickered in Black\u0027s shadowed eyes.\\n\\n \"Lie down,\" he said quietly to Ron. \"You will damage that leg even more.\"\\n\\n \"Did you hear me?\" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. \"You\u0027ll have to kill all three of us!\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027ll be only one murder here tonight,\" said Black, and his grin widened.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and Hermione. \"Didn\u0027t care last time, did you? Didn\u0027t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew...What\u0027s the matter, gone soft in Azkaban?\"\\n\\n \"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\\n\\n \"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione\u0027s and Ron\u0027s restraint and lunged forward --\\n\\n He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and that he didn\u0027t care how much he got hurt in return --\\n\\n Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black didn\u0027t raise the wands in time -- one of Harry\u0027s hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry\u0027s other hand collided with the side of Black\u0027s head and they fell, backward, into the wall --\\n\\n Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as the wands in Black\u0027s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry\u0027s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of Black it could find.\\n\\n But Black\u0027s free hand had found Harry\u0027s throat\\n\\n \"No,\" he hissed, \"I\u0027ve waited too long --\"\\n\\n The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.\\n\\n Then he saw Hermione\u0027s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black\u0027s wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter --\\n\\n He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward it but\\n\\n \"Argh!\"\\n\\n Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry\u0027s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry\u0027s wand --\\n\\n \"NO YOU DON\u0027T!\" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned --\\n\\n \"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n They didn\u0027t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\u0027s wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\\n\\n Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\\n\\n Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\u0027s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\u0027s left eye and his nose was bleeding.\\n\\n \"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.\\n\\n Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole story.\"\\n\\n \"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You sold them to Voldemort. That\u0027s all I need to know.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. \"You\u0027ll regret it if you don\u0027t...You don\u0027t understand....\"\\n\\n \"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice shook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum...trying to stop Voldemort killing me...and you did that...you did it....\"\\n\\n Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\u0027s chest and settled himself there, right over Black\u0027s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the cat.\\n\\n \"Get off,\" he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.\\n\\n But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black\u0027s robes and wouldn\u0027t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.\\n\\n Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with Black...If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn\u0027t Harry\u0027s business... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry\u0027s parents....\\n\\n Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance....\\n\\n The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron\u0027s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.\\n\\n And then came a new sound --\\n\\n Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was moving downstairs.\\n\\n \"WE\u0027RE UP HERE!\" Hermione screamed suddenly. \"WE\u0027RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS BLACK -- QUICK!\"\\n\\n Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head -- but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn\u0027t done it.\\n\\n The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry\u0027s feet.\\n\\n \"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across his chest.\\n\\n Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn\u0027t done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the Dementors.\\n\\n Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\\n\\n \"Where is he, Sirius?\"\\n\\n Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn\u0027t understand what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.\\n\\n Black\u0027s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn\u0027t move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.\\n\\n \"But then...\" Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \"...why hasn\u0027t he shown himself before now? Unless\" -- Lupin\u0027s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, \"-- unless he was the one...unless you switched... without telling me?\"\\n\\n Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin\u0027s face, Black nodded.\\n\\n \"Professor,\" Harry interrupted loudly, \"what\u0027s going on --?\"\\n\\n But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black. The Professor walked to Black\u0027s side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother.\\n\\n Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\\n\\n \"I DON\u0027T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\\n\\n Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \"You -- you --\"\\n\\n \"Hermione --\"\\n\\n \"¨C you and him!\"\\n\\n \"Hermione, calm down --\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I\u0027ve been covering up for you --\"\\n\\n \"Hermione, listen to me, please\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain --\"\\n\\n Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.\\n\\n \"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, \"and all the time you\u0027ve been his friend!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven\u0027t been Sirius\u0027s friend, but I am now -- Let me explain....\"\\n\\n \"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don\u0027t trust him, he\u0027s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he\u0027s a werewolf!\"\\n\\n There was a ringing silence. Everyone\u0027s eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\\n\\n \"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out of three, I\u0027m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don\u0027t want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his face. \"But I won\u0027t deny that I am a werewolf.\"\\n\\n Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away from me, werewolf!\"\\n\\n Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\\n\\n \"Ages,\" Hermione whispered. \"Since I did Professor Snape\u0027s essay...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be delighted,\" said Lupin coolly. \"He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the Boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\"\\n\\n \"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\\n\\n Lupin forced a laugh.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the cleverest witch of your age I\u0027ve ever met, Hermione.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I\u0027d been a bit cleverer, I\u0027d have told everyone what you are!\"\\n\\n \"But they already know,\" said Lupin. \"At least, the staff do.\"\\n\\n \"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf,\" Ron gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\\n\\n \"Some of the staff thought so,\" said Lupin. \"He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I\u0027m trustworthy --\"\\n\\n \"AND HE WAS WRONG!\" Harry yelled. \"YOU\u0027VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\" He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg.\\n\\n \"I have not been helping Sirius,\" said Lupin. \"If you\u0027ll give me a chance, I\u0027ll explain. Look --\"\\n\\n He separated Harry\u0027s, Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.\\n\\n \"There,\" said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt \"You\u0027re armed, we\u0027re not. Now will you listen?\"\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t know what to think. Was it a trick?\\n\\n \"If you haven\u0027t been helping him,\" he said, with a furious glance at Black, \"how did you know he was here?\"\\n\\n \"The map,\" said Lupin. \"The Marauder\u0027s Map. I was in my office examining it --\"\\n\\n \"You know how to work it?\" Harry said suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Of course I know how to work it,\" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \"I helped write it. I\u0027m Moony -- that was my friends\u0027 nickname for me at school.\"\\n\\n \"You wrote --?\"\\n\\n \"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his Hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.\\n\\n \"You might have been wearing your father\u0027s old cloak, Harry--\"\\n\\n \"How d\u0027you know about the cloak?\"\\n\\n \"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...\" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \"The point is, even if you\u0027re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder\u0027s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid\u0027s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody else.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" said Harry. \"No, we weren\u0027t!\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes,\u0027 said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry\u0027s interruption. \"I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?\"\\n\\n \"No one was with us!\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius Black...I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow --\"\\n\\n \"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\\n\\n \"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\\n\\n He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\\n\\n \"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\" he said evenly.\\n\\n \"What?\" said Ron. \"What\u0027s Scabbers got to do with it?\"\\n\\n \"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\\n\\n Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black\u0027s leg and made a soft hissing noise.\\n\\n Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\\n\\n \"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What\u0027s my rat got to do with anything?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\\n\\n \"What d\u0027you mean -- of course he\u0027s a rat --\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He\u0027s a wizard.\"\\n\\n \"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-17.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) \\n For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. \\n As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
