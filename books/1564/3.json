{"id":109553,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart.\n But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren\u0027t swooping down on him where he sat.\n Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.\n What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.\n He didn\u0027t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He\u0027d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless...\n He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn\u0027t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and...begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn\u0027t sit on this wall forever, or he\u0027d find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick.\n Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak -- but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more.\n A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.\n He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he\u0027d know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else.\n \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.\n Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter.\n There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light...\n With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.\n For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.\n \"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve--\"\n The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples.\n \"What were you doin\u0027 down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional manner.\n \"Fell over,\" said Harry.\n \"\u0027Choo fall over for?\" sniggered Stan.\n \"I didn\u0027t do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus\u0027s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty.\n \"\u0027Choo lookin\u0027 at?\" said Stan.\n \"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \"Like a dog...but massive...\"\n He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan\u0027s eyes move to the scar on Harry\u0027s forehead.\n \"Woss that on your \u0027ead?\" said Stan abruptly.\n \"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn\u0027t want to make it too easy for them.\n \"Woss your name?\" Stan persisted.\n \"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \"So -- so this bus,\" he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, \"did you say it goes anywhere?\"\n \"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, \u0027long it\u0027s on land. Can\u0027t do nuffink underwater.\n \"Ere,\" he said, looking suspicious again, \"you did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand \u0027and, dincha?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to London?\"\n \"Eleven Sickles,\" said Stan, \"but for firteen you get \u0027ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an \u0027ot-water bottle an\u0027 a toofbrush in the color of your choice.\"\n Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan\u0027s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig\u0027s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.\n There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I\u0027m pickling some slugs\" and rolled over in his sleep.\n \"You \u0027ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry\u0027s trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville Longbottom, Ern.\"\n Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\n \"Take \u0027er away, Ern,\" said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie\u0027s.\n There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was watching Harry\u0027s stunned face with great enjoyment.\n \"This is where we was before you flagged us down,\" he said. \"Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\"\n \"Ar,\" said Ernie.\n \"How come the Muggles don\u0027t hear the bus?\" said Harry.\n \"Them!\" said Stan contemptuously. \"Don\u0027 listen properly, do they? Don\u0027 look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don\u0027.\"\n \"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\" said Ern. \"We\u0027ll be in Abergavenny in a minute.\"\n Stan passed Harry\u0027s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn\u0027t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn\u0027t hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed.\n Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.\n \"\u0027Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way.\n Harry wouldn\u0027t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn\u0027t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet.\n Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar.\n \"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on the Muggle news!\"\n Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\n \"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"\u0027Course \u0027e was on the Muggle news, Neville. Where you been?\"\n He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\u0027s face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.\n \"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\"\n Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\n BLACK STILL AT LARGE\n Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.\n \"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm.\"\n Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.\n \"Well, really, I had to, don\u0027t you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He\u0027s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister\u0027s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black\u0027s true identity to anyone. And let\u0027s face it -- who\u0027d believe him if he did?\"\n While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.\n Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.\n \"Scary-lookin\u0027 fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.\n \"He murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \"with one curse?\"\n \"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an\u0027 all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\"\n \"Ar,\" said Ern darkly.\n Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry.\n \"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-\u0027Oo,\" he said.\n \"What, Voldemort?\" said Harry, without thinking.\n Even Stan\u0027s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.\n \"You outta your tree?\" yelped Stan. \"\u0027Choo say \u0027is name for?\"\n \"Sorry,\" said Harry hastily. \"Sorry, I -- I forgot --\"\n \"Forgot!\" said Stan weakly. \"Blimey, my \u0027eart\u0027s goin\u0027 that fast...\"\n \"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?\" Harry prompted apologetically.\n \"Yeah,\" said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \"Yeah, that\u0027s right. Very close to You-Know-\u0027Oo, they say...anyway, when little \u0027Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-\u0027Oo\" -- Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again -- \"all You-Know-\u0027Oo\u0027s supporters was tracked down, wasn\u0027t they, Ern? Most of \u0027em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-\u0027Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I \u0027eard he thought \u0027e\u0027d be second-in-command once You-Know-\u0027Oo \u0027ad taken over.\n \"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an\u0027 Black took out \u0027is wand and \u0027e blasted \u0027alf the street apart, an\u0027 a wizard got it, an\u0027 so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. \u0027Orrible, eh? An\u0027 you know what Black did then?\" Stan continued in a dramatic whisper.\n \"What?\" said Harry.\n \"Laughed,\" said Stan. \"Jus\u0027 stood there an\u0027 laughed. An\u0027 when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, \u0027e went wiv em quiet as anyfink, still laughing \u0027is \u0027ead off. \u0027Cos \u0027e\u0027s mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad?\"\n \"If he weren\u0027t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,\" said Ern in his slow voice. \"I\u0027d blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you...after what he did...\"\n \"They \u0027ad a job coverin\u0027 it up, din\u0027 they, Ern?\" Stan said. \"\u0027Ole street blown up an\u0027 all them Muggles dead. What was it they said \u0027ad \u0027appened, Ern?\"\n \"Gas explosion,\" grunted Ernie.\n \"An\u0027 now \u0027e\u0027s out,\" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black\u0027s gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, \u0027as there, Ern? Beats me \u0027ow \u0027e did it. Frightenin\u0027, eh? Mind, I don\u0027t fancy \u0027is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\"\n Ernie suddenly shivered. \"Talk about summat else, Stan, there\u0027s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.\"\n Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\u0027t help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\u0027 time.\n \"\u0027Ear about that \u0027Arry Potter? Blew up \u0027is aunt! We \u0027ad \u0027im \u0027ere on the Knight Bus, di\u0027n\u0027t we, Ern? \u0027E was tryin\u0027 to run for it...\"\n He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn\u0027t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he\u0027d ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn\u0027t soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid\u0027s face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\n The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry\u0027s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\n Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\n \"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, \"whereabouts in London?\"\n \"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry.\n \"Righto,\" said Stan. \"\u0027Old tight, then.\"\n BANG.\n They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\u0027s way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off -- where, he didn\u0027t know.\n Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\n \"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\n He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig\u0027s cage onto the pavement.\n \"Well,\" said Harry. \"\u0027Bye then!\"\n But Stan wasn\u0027t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.\n \"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice.\n Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come \u0027ere! Come \u0027ere!\"\n Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.\n Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\n \"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\n Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\n \"Neville?\" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\"\n \"I knew it!\" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess \u0027oo Neville is, Ern! \u0027E\u0027s \u0027Arry Potter! I can see \u0027is scar!\"\n \"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I\u0027m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...\"\n Fudge increased the pressure on Harry\u0027s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.\n \"You\u0027ve got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\"\n \"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn\u0027t let go of Harry.\n There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry\u0027s trunk and Hedwig\u0027s cage and looking around excitedly.\n \"\u0027Ow come you di\u0027n\u0027t tell us \u0027oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie\u0027s owlish face peered interestedly over Stan\u0027s shoulder.\n \"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\n \"\u0027Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\n \"\u0027Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\n Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\u0027s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\n \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\n Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\n \"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\n Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father\u0027s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn\u0027t to know that.\n Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him.\n \"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you\u0027ve had us all in a right flap, I don\u0027t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle\u0027s house like that! I\u0027d started to think...but you\u0027re safe, and that\u0027s what matters.\"\n Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\n \"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then...You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that\u0027s that, and no harm done.\"\n Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn\u0027t believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn\u0027t think of anything to say, and closed it again.\n \"Ah, you\u0027re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said Fudge. \"Well, I won\u0027t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\n Harry unstuck his throat.\n \"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don\u0027t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\n \"Now, now, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll feel differently once you\u0027ve calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I\u0027m sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\"\n It didn\u0027t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.\n \"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you\u0027re going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and...\"\n \"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\n Fudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\n \"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\n \"Oh, my dear boy, we\u0027re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!\" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \"It was an accident! We don\u0027t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!\"\n But this didn\u0027t tally at all with Harry\u0027s past dealings with the Ministry of Magic.\n \"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle\u0027s house!\" he told Fudge, frowning. \"The Ministry of Magic said I\u0027d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!\"\n Unless Harry\u0027s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward.\n \"Circumstances change, Harry...We have to take into account...in the present climate...Surely you don\u0027t want to be expelled?\"\n \"Of course I don\u0027t,\" said Harry.\n \"Well then, what\u0027s all the fuss about?\" laughed Fudge. \"Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom\u0027s got a room for you.\"\n Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he\u0027d done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn\u0027t usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?\n Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.\n \"Room eleven\u0027s free, Harry,\" said Fudge. \"I think you\u0027ll be very comfortable. just one thing, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand...I don\u0027t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley. And you\u0027re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you\u0027ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\"\n \"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\n \"Don\u0027t want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh. \"No, no...best we know where you are...I mean...\"\n Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be off, plenty to do, you know...\"\n \"Have you had any luck with Black yet?\" Harry asked.\n Fudge\u0027s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.\n \"What\u0027s that? Oh, you\u0027ve heard - well, no, not yet, but it\u0027s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed...and they are angrier than I\u0027ve ever seen them.\"\n Fudge shuddered slightly.\n \"So, I\u0027ll say good-bye.\"\n He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.\n \"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?\"\n \"Certainly,\" said Fudge with a smile.\n \"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn\u0027t sign the permission form. D\u0027you think you could --?\"\n Fudge was looking uncomfortable.\n \"Ah,\" he said. \"No, no, I\u0027m very sorry, Harry, but as I\u0027m not your parent or guardian --\"\n \"But you\u0027re the Minister of Magic,\" said Harry eagerly. \"If you gave me permission...\"\n \"No, I\u0027m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\" said Fudge flatly.\n \"Perhaps you\u0027ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think it\u0027s best if you don\u0027t...yes...well, I\u0027ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.\"\n And with a last smile and shake of Harry\u0027s hand, Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.\n \"If you\u0027ll follow me, Mr. Potter,\" he said, \"I\u0027ve already taken your things up...\"\n Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.\n Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe --\n \"Hedwig!\" Harry gasped.\n The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry\u0027s arm.\n \"Very smart owl you\u0027ve got there,\" chuckled Tom. \"Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there\u0027s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don\u0027t hesitate to ask.\"\n He gave another bow and left.\n Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry could hardly believe that he\u0027d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago, that he wasn\u0027t expelled, and that he was now facing two completely Dursley-free weeks.\n \"It\u0027s been a very weird night, Hedwig,\" he yawned.\n And without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-3.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) \n For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. \n As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected?
