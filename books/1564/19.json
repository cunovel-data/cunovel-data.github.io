Harry felt as though he\u0027d received a huge electric shock.\n \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin\u0027s chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\"\n Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You\u0027re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I\u0027ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did...lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\n \"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\n \"I\u0027ve told the headmaster again and again that you\u0027re helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\u0027s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\"\n \"Severus, you\u0027re making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven\u0027t heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\"\n \"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this...He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin...a tame werewolf --\"\n \"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\n BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape\u0027s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin\u0027s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\u0027s eyes.\n \"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\"\n Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.\n Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it wouldn\u0027t hurt to hear what they\u0027ve got to say, w-would it?\"\n \"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\"\n \"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\n \"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON\u0027T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON\u0027T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black\u0027s face. Hermione fell silent.\n \"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you....\"\n \"The joke\u0027s on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I\u0027ll come quietly....\"\n \"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don\u0027t think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the Dementors once we get out of the Willow. They\u0027ll be very pleased to see you, Black...pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay...I --\"\n What little color there was in Black\u0027s face left it.\n \"You -you\u0027ve got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\"\n But there was a mad glint in Snape\u0027s eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.\n \"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I\u0027ll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the Dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\n Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door.\n \"Get out of the way, Potter, you\u0027re in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn\u0027t been here to save your skin --\"\n \"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I\u0027ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the Dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn\u0027t he just finish me off then?\"\n \"Don\u0027t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf\u0027s mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\n \"YOU\u0027RE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON\u0027T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n \"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he\u0027d killed you! You\u0027d have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\n Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n \"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn\u0027t the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.\n Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape\u0027s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\n \"You should have left him to me....\"\n Harry avoided Black\u0027s eyes. He wasn\u0027t sure, even now, that he\u0027d done the right thing.\n \"We attacked a teacher...We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we\u0027re going to be in so much trouble --\"\n Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.\n \"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027m still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\n \"Then it\u0027s time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please. Now.\"\n Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\n \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how\u0027s he supposed to know which one he is after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\n \"You know, Sirius, that\u0027s a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\n Black put one of his claw-like hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.\n It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron\u0027s shoulder, was Scabbers.\n \"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\n \"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy\u0027s shoulder...I knew him at once...how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts...to where Harry was...\"\n \"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \"His front paw...\"\n \"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly.\n \"He\u0027s got a toe missing,\" said Black.\n \"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple...so brilliant...he cut it off himself?\"\n \"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I\u0027d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats....\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.\"\n \"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He\u0027s been in my family for ages, right --\"\n \"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn\u0027t you ever wonder why he was living so long?\"\n \"We -- we\u0027ve been taking good care of him!\" said Ron.\n \"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I\u0027d guess he\u0027s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again....\"\n \"He\u0027s been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.\n But that wasn\u0027t right, Harry thought suddenly...Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron\u0027s return from Egypt...since the time when Black had escaped....\n \"This cat isn\u0027t mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks\u0027s fluffy head. \"He\u0027s the most intelligent of his kind I\u0027ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me...Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he\u0027s been helping me...\"\n \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione.\n \"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn\u0027t...so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me...As I understand it, he took them from a boy\u0027s bedside table...\"\n Harry\u0027s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd...and yet...\n \"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.\" croaked Black. \"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets...I supposed he bit himself...Well, faking his own death had worked once.\"\n These words jolted Harry to his senses.\n \"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\"\n \"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry--\"\n \"And now you\u0027ve come to finish him off!\"\n \"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.\n \"Then I should\u0027ve let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted.\n \"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don\u0027t you see? All this time we\u0027ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around, don\u0027t you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\"\n \"THAT\u0027S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\"\n He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright.\n \"Harry...I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me...I\u0027m to blame, I know it...The night they died, I\u0027d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, he\u0027d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn\u0027t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your parents\u0027 house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies...I realized what Peter must\u0027ve done...what I\u0027d done....\"\n His voice broke. He turned away.\n \"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before. \"There\u0027s one certain way to prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\"\n \"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked Lupin tensely.\n \"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it won\u0027t hurt him.\"\n Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin.\n Black had already retrieved Snape\u0027s wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face.\n \"Together?\" he said quietly.\n \"I think so\", said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other. \"On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!\"\n A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then --\n It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up.\n He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers\u0027s fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.\n \"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\"\n \"S--Sirius...R--Remus...\" Even Pettigrew\u0027s voice was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends...my old friends...\"\n Black\u0027s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.\n \"We\u0027ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed --\"\n \"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, \"you don\u0027t believe him, do you...? He tried to kill me, Remus....\"\n \"So we\u0027ve heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I\u0027d like to clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if you\u0027ll be so --\"\n \"He\u0027s come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he\u0027s going to kill me too...You\u0027ve got to help me, Remus....\"\n Black\u0027s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.\n \"No one\u0027s going to try and kill you until we\u0027ve sorted a few things out,\" said Lupin.\n \"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. \"I knew he\u0027d come after me! I knew he\u0027d be back for me! I\u0027ve been waiting for this for twelve years!\"\n \"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his brow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\"\n \"He\u0027s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew shouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\"\n Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room.\n \"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said.\n Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.\n \"What, scared to hear your old master\u0027s name?\" said Black. \"I don\u0027t blame you, Peter. His lot aren\u0027t very happy with you, are they?\"\n \"Don\u0027t know what you mean, Sirius --\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.\n \"You haven\u0027t been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You\u0027ve been hiding from Voldemort\u0027s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter...They all think you\u0027re dead, or you\u0027d have to answer to them...I\u0027ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters\u0027 on your information...and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort\u0027s supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they\u0027ve seen the error of their ways. If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --\"\n \"Don\u0027t know...what you\u0027re talking about...\" said Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. \"You don\u0027t believe this -- this madness, Remus --\"\n \"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly.\n \"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort\u0027s supporters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban -- the spy, Sirius Black!\"\n Black\u0027s face contorted.\n \"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been. \"I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I\u0027ll never understand why I didn\u0027t see you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who\u0027d look after you, didn\u0027t you? It used to be us...me and Remus...and James...\"\n Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.\n \"Me, a spy...must be out of your mind...never...don\u0027t know how you can say such a --\"\n \"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\" Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. \"I thought it was the perfect plan...a bluff...Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they\u0027d use a weak, talentless thing like you...It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\"\n Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like \"far-fetched\" and \"lunacy,\" but he couldn\u0027t help paying more attention to the ashen color of Pettigrew\u0027s face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door.\n \"Professor Lupin?\" said Hermione timidly. \"Can -- can I say something?\"\n \"Certainly, Hermione,\" said Lupin courteously.\n \"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he\u0027s been sleeping in Harry\u0027s dormitory for three years. If he\u0027s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\"\n \"There!\" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand. \"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry\u0027s head! Why should I?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you why,\" said Black. \"Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort\u0027s been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he\u0027s half dead. You weren\u0027t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore\u0027s nose, for a wreck of a wizard who\u0027d lost all of his power, were you? You\u0027d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him, wouldn\u0027t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren\u0027t you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him....\"\n Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.\n \"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?\" said Hermione.\n Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her.\n \"If you don\u0027t mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if you didn\u0027t use Dark Magic?\"\n \"Thank you!\" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \"Exactly! Precisely what I --\"\n But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering his answer.\n \"I don\u0027t know how I did it,\" he said slowly. \"I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\u0027t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn\u0027t suck it out of me...but it kept me sane and knowing who I am...helped me keep my powers...so when it all became...too much...I could transform in my cell...become a dog. Dementors can\u0027t see, you know...\" He swallowed. \"They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions...They could tell that my feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog...but they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there, so it didn\u0027t trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand....\"\n \"But then I saw Peter in that picture...I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry...perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again...\"\n Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized.\n \"...ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies...and to deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who\u0027d dare say he\u0027d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He\u0027d be welcomed back with honors....\"\n \"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive...\"\n Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. \u0027The guards say he\u0027s been talking in his sleep... always the same words... \u0027He\u0027s at Hogwarts.\u0027\u0027\n \"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the Dementors couldn\u0027t destroy it...It wasn\u0027t a happy feeling...it was an obsession...but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog...It\u0027s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused...I was thin, very thin...thin enough to slip through the bars...I swam as a dog back to the mainland ...I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I\u0027ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry....\"\n He looked at Harry, who did not look away.\n \"Believe me,\" croaked Black. \"Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\"\n And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he nodded.\n \"No!\"\n Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry\u0027s nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in front of him as though praying.\n \"Sirius -- it\u0027s me...it\u0027s Peter...your friend...you wouldn\u0027t --\"\n Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.\n \"There\u0027s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\" said Black.\n \"Remus!\" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. \"You don\u0027t believe this -- wouldn\u0027t Sirius have told you they\u0027d changed the plan?\"\n \"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\" said Lupin. \"I assume that\u0027s why you didn\u0027t tell me, Sirius?\" he said casually over Pettigrew\u0027s head.\n \"Forgive me, Remus,\" said Black.\n \"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\" said Lupin, who was now rolling up his sleeves. \"And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?\"\n \"Of course,\" said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \"Shall we kill him together?\"\n \"Yes, I think so,\" said Lupin grimly.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t...you won\u0027t...\" gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled around to Ron.\n \"Ron...haven\u0027t I been a good friend...a good pet? You won\u0027t let them kill me, Ron, will you...you\u0027re on my side, aren\u0027t you?\"\n But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.\n \"I let you sleep in my bed!\" he said.\n \"Kind boy...kind master...\" Pettigrew crawled toward Ron \"You won\u0027t let them do it...I was your rat...I was a good pet....\"\n \"If you made a better rat than a human, it\u0027s not much to boast about, Peter,\" said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew\u0027s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione\u0027s robes.\n \"Sweet girl...clever girl...you -- you won\u0027t let them...Help me....\"\n Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew\u0027s clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified.\n Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly toward Harry.\n \"Harry...Harry...you look just like your father...just like him...\"\n \"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\" roared Black. \"HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\"\n \"Harry,\" whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched. \"Harry, James wouldn\u0027t have wanted me killed...James would have understood, Harry...he would have shown me mercy...\"\n Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew\u0027s shoulders, and threw him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring up at them.\n \"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\" said Black, who was shaking too. \"Do you deny it?\"\n Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.\n \"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord...you have no idea...he has weapons you can\u0027t imagine ...I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen...He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --\"\n \"DON\u0027T LIE!\" bellowed Black. \"YOU\u0027D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\"\n \"He -- he was taking over everywhere!\" gasped Pettigrew. \"Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him?\"\n \"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?\" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. \"Only innocent lives, Peter!\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand!\" whined Pettigrew. \"He would have killed me, Sirius!\"\n \"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\" roared Black. \"DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\"\n Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.\n \"You should have realized,\" said Lupin quietly, \"if Voldemort didn\u0027t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\"\n Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.\n \"NO!\" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew, facing the wands. \"You can\u0027t kill him,\" he said breathlessly. \"You can\u0027t.\"\n Black and Lupin both looked staggered.\n \"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\" Black snarled. \"This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family.\"\n \"I know,\" Harry panted. \"We\u0027ll take him up to the castle. We\u0027ll hand him over to the Dementors...He can go to Azkaban...but don\u0027t kill him.\"\n \"Harry!\" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry\u0027s knees. \"You -- thank you -- it\u0027s more than I deserve -- thank you --\"\n \"Get off me,\" Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew\u0027s hands off him in disgust. \"I\u0027m not doing this for you. I\u0027m doing it because -- I don\u0027t reckon my dad would\u0027ve wanted them to become killers -- just for you.\"\n No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.\n \"You\u0027re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\" said Black. \"But think... think what he did....\"\n \"He can go to Azkaban,\" Harry repeated. \"If anyone deserves that place, he does....\"\n Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.\n \"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"Stand aside, Harry.\"\n Harry hesitated.\n \"I\u0027m going to tie him up,\" said Lupin. \"That\u0027s all, I swear.\"\n Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin\u0027s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.\n \"But if you transform, Peter,\" growled Black, his own wand pointing at Pettigrew too, \"we will kill you. You agree, Harry?\"\n Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.\n \"Right,\" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \"Ron, I can\u0027t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it\u0027s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\"\n He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron\u0027s leg with his wand, and muttered, \"Ferula.\" Bandages spun up Ron\u0027s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn\u0027t wince.\n \"That\u0027s better,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"\n \"What about Professor Snape?\" said Hermione in a small voice, looking down at Snape\u0027s prone figure.\n \"There\u0027s nothing seriously wrong with him,\" said Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse. \"You were just a little -- overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we don\u0027t revive him until we\u0027re safety back in the castle. We can take him like this....\"\n He muttered, \"Mobilicorpus.\" As though invisible strings were tied to Snape\u0027s wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.\n \"And two of us should be chained to this,\" said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. \"Just to make sure.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do it,\" said Lupin.\n \"And me,\" said Ron savagely, limping forward.\n Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Lupin\u0027s right, right arm to Ron\u0027s left. Ron\u0027s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers\u0027s true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-19.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) \n For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. \n As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
