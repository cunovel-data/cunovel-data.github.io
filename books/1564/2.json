{"id":109552,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually.\\n\\n Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict.\\n\\n \"...the public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.\"\\n\\n \"No need to tell us he\u0027s no good,\" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \"Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout! Look at his hair!\"\\n\\n He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\\n\\n The reporter had reappeared.\\n\\n \"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --\"\\n\\n \"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn\u0027t tell us where that maniac\u0027s escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\\n\\n Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.\\n\\n \"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \"that hanging\u0027s the only way to deal with these people?\"\\n\\n \"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door\u0027s runner-beans.\\n\\n Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I\u0027d better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge\u0027s train gets in at ten.\"\\n\\n Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\\n\\n \"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh-she\u0027s not coming here, is she?\"\\n\\n Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon\u0027s sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry\u0027s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia\u0027s sister), he had been forced to call her \u0027Aunt\u0027 all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn\u0027t often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn\u0027t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry\u0027s mind.\\n\\n At Dudley\u0027s fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \"Marge\u0027ll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, \"and while we\u0027re on the subject,\" he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry, \"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\\n\\n Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley\u0027s favorite form of entertainment.\\n\\n \"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you\u0027ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you\u0027re talking to Marge.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she\u0027s talking to me.\"\\n\\n \"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry\u0027s reply, \"as Marge doesn\u0027t know anything about your abnormality, I don\u0027t want any -- any funny stuff while she\u0027s here. You behave yourself, got me?\"\\n\\n \"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\\n\\n \"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \"we\u0027ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus\u0027s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Harry yelled.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there\u0027ll be trouble,\" spat Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon\u0027s old socks.\\n\\n \"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I\u0027ll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\\n\\n \"Duddy\u0027s got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley\u0027s thick blond hair. \"Mummy\u0027s bought him a lovely new bow-tie.\"\\n\\n Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.\\n\\n \"See you in a bit, then,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\\n\\n Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\\n\\n Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\\n\\n \"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.\"\\n\\n Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.\\n\\n \"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\\n\\n \"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it\u0027ll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits....\"\\n\\n \"St. Brutus\u0027s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon\u0027s large, purple face. \"It\u0027s a lot to remember. I\u0027ll have to make it sound convincing, won\u0027t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won\u0027t you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.\\n\\n \"Knocking the stuffing out of me won\u0027t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\" he said grimly.\\n\\n Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\\n\\n \"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear Ill remember where I\u0027m supposed to go to school, and Ill act like a Mug -- like I\u0027m normal and everything.\"\\n\\n Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\\n\\n \"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge\u0027s visit. If, at the end of it, you\u0027ve toed the line and kept to the story, Ill sign your ruddy form.\"\\n\\n He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, heed better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig\u0027s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\\n\\n \"Hedwig,\" he said gloomily, \"you\u0027re going to have to clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron\u0027ll look after you. Ill write him a note, explaining. And don\u0027t look at me like that\" -- Hedwig\u0027s large amber eyes were reproachful -- \"it\u0027s not my fault. It\u0027s the only way I\u0027ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\"\\n\\n Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.\\n\\n But Harry didn\u0027t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest.\\n\\n \"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.\\n\\n Harry couldn\u0027t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she would be.\\n\\n All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon\u0027s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.\\n\\n \"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\\n\\n A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.\\n\\n On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s my Dudders?\" roared Aunt Marge. \"Where\u0027s my neffy poo?\"\\n\\n Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase into Harry\u0027s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.\\n\\n Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge\u0027s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.\\n\\n \"Petunia!\" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a hat-stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunias bony cheekbone.\\n\\n Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\\n\\n \"Tea, Marge?\" he said. \"And what will Ripper take?\"\\n\\n \"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But Harry wasn\u0027t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.\\n\\n By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s looking after the other dogs, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"He\u0027s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn\u0027t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he\u0027s away from me.\"\\n\\n Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt Marge\u0027s attention to Harry for the first time.\\n\\n \"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you say \"yes\" in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt Marge growled. \"It\u0027s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn\u0027t have done it myself. You\u0027d have gone straight to an orphanage if you\u0027d been dumped on my doorstep.\"\\n\\n Harry was bursting to say that he\u0027d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you smirk at me!\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven\u0027t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners into you.\" She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said, \"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\"\\n\\n \"St. Brutus\u0027s,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It\u0027s a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" said Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus\u0027s, boy?\" she barked across the table.\\n\\n \"Er --\"\\n\\n Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge\u0027s back.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly, he added, \"All the time.\"\\n\\n \"Excellent,\" said Aunt Marge. \"I won\u0027t have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what\u0027s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah,\" said Harry, \"loads of times.\"\\n\\n Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t like your tone, boy,\" she said. \"If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren\u0027t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I\u0027d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy\u0027s case.\"\\n\\n Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the subject abruptly.\\n\\n \"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?\"\\n\\n ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*\\n\\n As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn\u0027t got a present too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person.\\n\\n \"You mustn\u0027t blame yourself for the way the boy\u0027s turned out, Vernon,\" she said over lunch on the third day. \"If there\u0027s something rotten on the inside, there\u0027s nothing anyone can do about it.\"\\n\\n Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don\u0027t say anything. Don\u0027t rise --\\n\\n Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s one of the basic rules of breeding,\" she said. \"You see it all the time with dogs. If there\u0027s something wrong with the bitch, there\u0027ll be something wrong with the pup --\"\\n\\n At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\\n\\n \"Marge!\" squealed Aunt Petunia. \"Marge, are you all right?\"\\n\\n \"Not to worry,\" grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin. \"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster\u0027s the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip....\"\\n\\n But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he\u0027d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could.\\n\\n Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply. It had been a long time since he\u0027d lost control and made something explode. He couldn\u0027t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn\u0027t the only thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he\u0027d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.\\n\\n Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school. His record wasn\u0027t exactly clean either. Only last summer he\u0027d gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.\\n\\n He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way.\\n\\n ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*\\n\\n Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal.\\n\\n At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge\u0027s stay arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry\u0027s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them a with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.\\n\\n \"Can I tempt you, Marge?\"\\n\\n Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very red.\\n\\n \"Just a small one, then,\" she chuckled. \"A bit more than that...and a bit more...that\u0027s the ticket.\"\\n\\n Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon\u0027s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.\\n\\n \"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It\u0027s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...\" She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You\u0027ll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I\u0027ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon...\"\\n\\n \"Now, this one here --\"\\n\\n She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.\\n\\n \"This one\u0027s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.\"\\n\\n Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.\\n\\n \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I\u0027m saying nothing against your family, Petunia\" -- she patted Aunt Petunia\u0027s bony hand with her shovel-like one \"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here\u0027s the result right in front of us.\"\\n\\n Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn\u0027t remember what came next. Aunt Marge\u0027s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon\u0027s drills.\\n\\n \"This Potter,\" said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\"\\n\\n Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.\\n\\n \"He -- didn\u0027t work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\"\\n\\n \"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who --\"\\n\\n \"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.\\n\\n \"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge\u0027s glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on --\"\\n\\n \"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry\u0027s. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) --\"\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his feet.\\n\\n \"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little --\"\\n\\n But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn\u0027t stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami...\\n\\n \"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge\u0027s whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly.\\n\\n \"NOOOOOOO!\"\\n\\n Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge\u0027s feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon\u0027s leg.\\n\\n Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig\u0027s empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.\\n\\n \"COME BACK IN HERE!\" he bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\"\\n\\n But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n \"She deserved it,\" Harry said, breathing very fast. \"She deserved what she got. You keep away from me.\"\\n\\n He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going,\" Harry said. \"I\u0027ve had enough.\"\\n\\n And in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig\u0027s cage under his arm. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-2.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) \\n For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. \\n As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
