{"id":109557,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people\u0027s favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. \"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old house elf.\" But no one else cared that Professor Lupin\u0027s robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After Boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin-like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to Kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds. Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the Boggart assuming Snape\u0027s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his grandmother\u0027s clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn\u0027t seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin\u0027s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever. Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor Trelawney\u0027s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney\u0027s enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn\u0027t like Professor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney\u0027s tower room at lunch times, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others didn\u0027t. They had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed. Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence. \"Why would anyone bother looking after them?\" said Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms\u0027 throats. At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season. There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the game and earned the Seeker\u0027s team an extra one hundred and fifty points. Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field. \"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,\" he told them, striding up and down in front of them. \"I\u0027ll be leaving at the end of this year. I\u0027ll never get another shot at it.\" \"Gryffindor hasn\u0027t won for seven years now. Okay, so we\u0027ve had the worst luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournament getting called off last year.\" Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat. \"But we also know we\u0027ve got the best -- ruddy -- team -- in -- the -- school,\" he said, punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. \"We\u0027ve got three superb Chasers.\" Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell. \"We\u0027ve got two unbeatable Beaters.\" \"Stop it, Oliver, you\u0027re embarrassing us,\" said Fred and George Weasley together, pretending to blush. \"And we\u0027ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!\" Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. \"And me,\" he added as an afterthought. \"We think you\u0027re very good too, Oliver,\" said George. \"Spanking good Keeper,\" said Fred. \"The point is,\" Wood went on, resuming his pacing, \"the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I\u0027ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven\u0027t got it, and this year\u0027s the last chance we\u0027ll get to finally see our name on the thing...\" Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic. \"Oliver, this year\u0027s our year,\" said Fred. \"We\u0027ll do it, Oliver!\" said Angelina. \"Definitely,\" said Harry. Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry\u0027s wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup. Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing excitedly. \"What\u0027s happened?\", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy. \"First Hogsmeade weekend,\" said Ron, pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board. \"End of October. Halloween.\" \"Excellent,\" said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait hole. \"I need to visit Zonko\u0027s. I\u0027m nearly out of Stink Pellets.\" Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his mind. \"Harry, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be able to go next time,\" she said. \"They\u0027re bound to catch Black soon. He\u0027s been sighted once already.\" \"Black\u0027s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron. \"Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages --\" \"Ron!\" said Hermione. \"Harry\u0027s supposed to stay in school --\" \"He can\u0027t be the only third year left behind,\" said Ron. \"Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry --\" \"Yeah, I think I will,\" said Harry, making up his mind. Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth. \"Does he have to eat that in front of us?\" said Ron, scowling. \"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\" said Hermione. Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed insolently on Ron. \"Just keep him over there, that\u0027s all,\" said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart. \"I\u0027ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.\" Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work. \"You can copy mine, if you like,\" said Ron, labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry. Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn\u0027t say anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced. \"OY!\" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. \"GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!\" Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing. \"Ron, don\u0027t hurt him!\" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top -- \"CATCH THAT CAT!\" Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers. George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs, and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw. Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail. \"Look at him!\" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front of her. \"He\u0027s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!\" \"Crookshanks doesn\u0027t understand it\u0027s wrong!\" said Hermione, her voice shaking. \"All cats chase rats, Ron!\" \"There\u0027s something funny about that animal!\" said Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. \"It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!\" \"Oh, what rubbish,\" said Hermione impatiently. \"Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d\u0027you think --\" \"That cat\u0027s got it in for Scabbers!\" said Ron, ignoring the people around him, who were starting to giggle. \"And Scabbers was here first, and he\u0027s ill!\" Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys\u0027 dormitories. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working together on the same Puffapod. \"How\u0027s Scabbers?\" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail. \"He\u0027s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,\" said Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor. \"Careful, Weasley, careful!\" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes. They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at the front of the line. Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were looking very serious. \"What\u0027s the matter, Lavender?\" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the group. \"She got a letter from home this morning,\" Parvati whispered. \"It\u0027s her rabbit, Binky. He\u0027s been killed by a fox.\" \"Oh,\" said Hermione, \"I\u0027m sorry, Lavender.\" \"I should have known!\" said Lavender tragically. \"You know what day it is?\" \"Er --\" \"The sixteenth of October! \u0027That thing you\u0027re dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of October!\u0027 Remember? She was right, she was right!\" The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, \"You -- you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?\" \"Well, not necessarily by a fox,\" said Lavender, looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, \"but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn\u0027t I?\" \"Oh,\" said Hermione. She paused again. Then -- \"Was Binky an old rabbit?\" \"N -- no!\" sobbed Lavender. \"H -- he was only a baby!\" Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender\u0027s shoulders. \"But then, why would you dread him dying?\" said Hermione. Parvati glared at her. \"Well, look at it logically,\" said Hermione, turning to the rest of the group. \"I mean, Binky didn\u0027t even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today --\" Lavender wailed loudly. \"¨C and she can\u0027t have been dreading it, because it\u0027s come as a real shock --\" \"Don\u0027t mind Hermione, Lavender,\" said Ron loudly, \"she doesn\u0027t think other people\u0027s pets matter very much.\" Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn\u0027t talk to each other for the whole class. Harry still hadn\u0027t decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first. \"One moment, please!\" she called as the class made to leave. \"As you\u0027re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don\u0027t forget!\" Neville put up his hand. \"Please, Professor, I -- I think I\u0027ve lost --\" \"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that\u0027s all, you may leave.\" \"Ask her now,\" Ron hissed at Harry. \"Oh. but --\" Hermione began. \"Go for it, Harry,\" said Ron stubbornly. Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall\u0027s desk. \"Yes, Potter?\" Harry took a deep breath. \"Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form,\" he said. Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn\u0027t say anything. \"So -- er -- d\u0027you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I -- if I go to Hogsmeade?\" Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk. \"I\u0027m afraid not, Potter,\" she said. \"You heard what I said. No form, no visiting the village. That\u0027s the rule.\" \"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they\u0027re Muggles, they don\u0027t really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\" Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. \"If you said I could go --\" \"But I don\u0027t say so,\" said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer. \"The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission.\" She turned to look at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? \"I\u0027m sorry, Potter, but that\u0027s my final word. You had better hurry, or you\u0027ll be late for your next lesson.\" ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an \u0027all-for-the-best\u0027 expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade. \"There\u0027s always the feast,\" said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up. \"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry gloomily, \"great.\" The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon\u0027s signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he hadn\u0027t had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the Dementors being able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort. \"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it\u0027s not all it\u0027s cracked up to be,\" he said seriously. \"All right, the sweetshop\u0027s rather good, and Zonko\u0027s Joke Shop\u0027s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack\u0027s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you\u0027re not missing anything.\" ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act normally. \"We\u0027ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,\" said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him. \"Yeah, loads,\" said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry\u0027s difficulties. \"Don\u0027t worry about me,\" said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand voice, \"I\u0027ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.\" He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn\u0027t be going. \"Staying here, Potter?\" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. \"Scared of passing the Dementors?\" Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower. \"Password?\" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze. \"Fortuna Major,\" said Harry listlessly. The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room. It was full of chattering first-and second-years, and a few older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off. \"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!\" It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him. \"Aren\u0027t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey --\" Colin looked eagerly around at his friends -- \"you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!\" \"Er -- no, thanks, Colin,\" said Harry, who wasn\u0027t in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. \"I -- I\u0027ve got to go to the library, got to get some work done.\" After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again. \"What was the point of waking me up?\" the Fat Lady called grumpily after him as he walked away. Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn\u0027t feel like working. He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors. \"What are you doing?\" Filch snarled suspiciously. \"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully. \"Nothing!\" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \"A likely story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren\u0027t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends?\" Harry shrugged. \"Well, get back to your common room where you belong!\" snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight. But Harry didn\u0027t go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, \"Harry?\" Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door. \"What are you doing?\" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" \"Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. \"Ah,\" said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \"Why don\u0027t you come in? I\u0027ve just taken delivery of a Grindylow for our next lesson.\" \"A what?\" said Harry. He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. \"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the Grindylow thoughtfully. \"We shouldn\u0027t have much difficulty with him, not after the Kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.\" The Grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner. \"Cup of tea?\" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \"I was just thinking of making one.\" \"All right,\" said Harry awkwardly. Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout. \"Sit down,\" said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \"I\u0027ve only got teabags, I\u0027m afraid -- but I daresay you\u0027ve had enough of tea leaves?\" Harry looked at him. Lupin\u0027s eyes were twinkling. \"How did you know about that?\" Harry asked. \"Professor McGonagall told me,\" said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. \"You\u0027re not worried, are you?\" \"No,\" said Harry. He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he\u0027d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn\u0027t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn\u0027t cope with a Boggart. Something of Harry\u0027s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said, \"Anything worrying you, Harry?\" \"No,\" Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the Grindylow brandishing a fist at him. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin\u0027s desk. \"You know that day we fought the Boggart?\" \"Yes,\" said Lupin slowly. \"Why didn\u0027t you let me fight it?\" said Harry abruptly. Lupin raised his eyebrows. \"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\" he said, sounding surprised. Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he\u0027d done any such thing, was taken aback. \"Why?\" he said again. \"Well,\" said Lupin, frowning slightly, \"I assumed that if the Boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\" Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he\u0027d expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort\u0027s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore. \"Clearly, I was wrong,\" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \"But I didn\u0027t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.\" \"I didn\u0027t think of Voldemort,\" said Harry honestly. \"I -- I remembered those Dementors.\" \"I see,\" said Lupin thoughtfully. \"Well, well...I\u0027m impressed.\" He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry\u0027s face. \"That suggests that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry.\" Harry didn\u0027t know what to say to that, so he drank some more tea. \"So you\u0027ve been thinking that I didn\u0027t believe you capable of fighting the Boggart?\" said Lupin shrewdly. \"Well...yeah,\" said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. \"Professor Lupin, you know the Dementors --\" He was interrupted by a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Lupin. The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing. \"Ah, Severus,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?\" Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin. \"I was just showing Harry my Grindylow,\" said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank. \"Fascinating,\" said Snape, without looking at it. \"You should drink that directly, Lupin.\" \"Yes, Yes, I will,\" said Lupin. \"I made an entire cauldronful,\" Snape continued. \"If you need more.\" \"I should probably have some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\" \"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn\u0027t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. \"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\" he said. \"I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.\" He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \"Pity sugar makes it useless,\" he added, taking a sip and shuddering. \"Why --?\" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question. \"I\u0027ve been feeling a bit off-color,\" he said. \"This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren\u0027t many wizards who are up to making it.\" Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands. \"Professor Snape\u0027s very interested in the Dark Arts,\" he blurted out. \"Really?\" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion. \"Some people reckon --\" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, \"some people reckon he\u0027d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job.\" Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. \"Disgusting,\" he said. \"Well, Harry, I\u0027d better get back to work. See you at the feast later.\" \"Right,\" said Harry, putting down his empty teacup. The empty goblet was still smoking. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡* \"There you go,\" said Ron. \"We got as much as we could carry.\" A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry\u0027s lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they\u0027d had the time of their lives. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps. \"What\u0027s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?\" By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko\u0027s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides. \"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!\" \"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there\u0027s a bit, look --\" \"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks --\" \"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --\" \"What did you do?\" said Hermione, looking anxious. \"Did you get any work done?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in...\" He told them all about the goblet. Ron\u0027s mouth fell open. \"Lupin drank it?\" he gasped. \"Is he mad?\" Hermione checked her watch. \"We\u0027d better go down, you know, the feast\u0027ll be starting in five minutes They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape. \"But if he -- you know --\" Hermione dropped her voice, glancing nervously around, \"if he was trying to -- to poison Lupin -- he wouldn\u0027t have done it in front of Harry.\" \"Yeah, maybe,\" said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes. The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape\u0027s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural? The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading. It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry\u0027s good mood couldn\u0027t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, \"The Dementors send their love, Potter!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students. \"Why isn\u0027t anyone going in?\" said Ron curiously. Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed. \"Let me through, please,\" came Percy\u0027s voice, and he came bustling importantly through the crowd. \"What\u0027s the holdup here? You can\u0027t all have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I\u0027m Head Boy --\" And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, \"Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\" People\u0027s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe. \"What\u0027s going on?\" said Ginny, who had just arrived. A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was. \"Oh, my --\" Hermione grabbed Harry\u0027s arm. The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely. Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying toward him. \"We need to find her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.\" \"You\u0027ll be lucky!\" said a cackling voice. It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry. \"What do you mean, Peeves?\" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves\u0027s grin faded a little. He didn\u0027t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle. \"Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn\u0027t want to be seen. She\u0027s a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,\" he said happily. \"Poor thing.\" he added unconvincingly. \"Did she say who did it?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Oh yes, Professorhead,\" said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. \"He got very angry when she wouldn\u0027t let him in, you see.\" Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from between his own legs. \"Nasty temper he\u0027s got, that Sirius Black.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-8.html","bookId":1564,"book":{"id":1564,"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3) For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who\u0027s forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling\u0027s Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard \"accidentally\" causes the Dursleys\u0027 dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn\u0027t punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he\u0027s after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry\u0027s very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3.jpg","author":"J.K.
