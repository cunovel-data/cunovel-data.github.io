{"id":105023,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Do you plan to kill me?\" Asher closed the iron grille behind him, turned the heavy key, and followed Simon back into the de-serted vestibule, where Ysidro was fastidiously poking among the pa-pers of the desk. The vampire paused to regard him with dispassionate eyes, and, as so often with Ysidro, Asher found it impossible to divine whether he was contemplating the mortal state or simply wondering whether he felt peckish. In any case he did not answer.\\n\\n Instead he asked, \"What do you think of our Franciscan brother?\"\\n\\n \"Other than that he\u0027s mad, you mean?\" Asher removed a couple of wax tablets from his pocket, of the sort that he had habitually carried in his Foreign Office days, and methodically took impressions of all the keys on the ring. \"I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s our culprit.\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s here instead of in London? Never think it. He is silent as the fall of dust, James; he could have followed us back to Paris, and I would never have been the wiser; could have overheard any of our conversations and preceded us...\"\\n\\n \"In Latin?\"\\n\\n \"In English, if he was friend to Rhys and to Tulloch the Scot. Most of us learn one another\u0027s languages, even as we keep abreast of the changes in the tongues of the lands where we dwell-conspicuousness is our death. The fact that he lives hidden in the catacombs does not mean he has not walked the streets of men unseen. He understands at least some of the changes that have taken place since the Fall of the Kings... And he claims, incidentally, to have seen Tulloch the Scot\u0027s flesh shriv-eled from his bones by the light of the noonday sun...\"\\n\\n \"Meaning he was up and around by day?\" Asher used his fingernail to pry the last key gingerly from the wax, thinking to himself that, if that were the case, the Minorite\u0027s assumption that Ysidro intended to murder him might be far from a random guess. \"But you say yourself that the Scot was seen years later...\"\\n\\n \"I say that there are those who swear they saw him-as unreliable a contention as our religious friend\u0027s, if, like Anthony, Tulloch\u0027s abilities to pass unseen grew with time. There has been no reliable report of his presence since the days of the Terror-indeed, none for half a century before, but that means nothing.\"\\n\\n Asher wiped the last telltale fragments of wax from the wards and replaced the key on its hook beside the grilled door. \"And the others he named?\"\\n\\n \"Two at least I know to be dead-three, if La Flamande is the same woman I knew during the wars over Picardy. I\u0027ve never heard of Croualt...\" He waited until Asher had opened the outer door, then turned down the lantern wick until its flame snuffed into darkness. Asher reflected with an inner grin that Ysidro\u0027s candle snuffing trick didn\u0027t seem to work too well with three-quarters of an inch of woven wick and a reservoir full of kerosene.\\n\\n \"So we have three-perhaps four, if you want to count Grippen and figure out some way he could have jiggered the daylight problem.\" He stepped through the outer door into the dark Rue Dareau.\\n\\n \"None of those he named has been seen or heard of for centuries.\" \"That doesn\u0027t mean they haven\u0027t been hiding somewhere, as Brother Anthony has been hiding,\" Asher replied quietly. \"If one of them sur-vived, he-or she-would be a day stalker, like Brother Anthony, toughened, as you said, against garlic and silver and other countermeasures.\"\\n\\n \"It also does not mean that Brother Anthony is not himself the killer.\"\\n\\n \"Do you believe he is?\"\\n\\n Ysidro\u0027s smile flickered briefly into existence. \"No. But there are few other candidates for the role.\" Their footsteps echoed hollowly against the dingy walls of dark brick as they made their way north, through the crisscrossings of the empty back streets that led toward the wider boule-vards. There was no way of telling how late it was, but leaden darkness now possessed even the most late-carousing of bistros, and the prosti-tutes seemed to have sought their beds for good, \" \u0027I have killed over and over,\u0027 he said, and also, \u0027I have tried to do good.\u0027 The killing of other vampires could be interpreted as a major effort in that direction. Is it not what you yourself plan to do, if you get the chance?\"\\n\\n Asher glanced sharply across at him, but met only matter-of-fact inquiry in those cool, strange eyes. Instead of replying, he said, \"If he wanted to slay his own kind, there are plenty to begin on here, without going to London for the purpose. And if the killer is his contemporary, with the same alterations of powers, Brother Anthony may be our only hope of tracking him.\"\\n\\n \"If he will.\" They crossed a street. Asher had a momentary sense of movement in the noisome blackness of an alley to their right and the mutter of voices as the local toughs wisely decided not to molest this particular pair of passers-by. \"And if, given that you can coax him from the earth to which he has gone, he consents to assist us and not ally himself with the killer.\"\\n\\n Asher shivered, remembering how the little monk had seemed to melt from the darkness, the cold tickle of those frail fingers on his hand, and their unbreakable strength. He knew what his own reaction would be to a mortal man who allied himself with vampires. Perhaps it was best after all to let sleeping dogs lie.\\n\\n They passed through a darkened square whose fountain sounded un-earthly loud in the stillness, turned into the Boulevard St. Michel. Even that great artery was virtually empty. The chestnut trees that lined it rustled overhead like a dim woods, their leaves lying in soggy drifts along the walls of the great hospitals which clustered in that neighbor-hood. The electric street lamps threw too-bright halos, making the gloom seem all the more dense. Now and then, a passing fiacre broke the eerie silence with the sharp tap of hooves, but that was all. The night was still and cold; Asher pulled his scarf more closely around his throat and huddled deep into the folds of his ulster.\\n\\n Presently he asked, \"If there is a strange vampire operating in Lon-don-be it Tulloch the Scot, even Rhys himself, or some other-might we not trace it through unexplained kills? Would a vampire that ancient have to kill as often?\"\\n\\n \"Any city on earth,\" Don Simon replied austerely, \"gives forth such spate of unexplained kills of its own, through disease, cold, filth, and uncaring, that it were difficult to trace a single vampire\u0027s poor efforts, As for needing blood less frequently-or needing, rather, the life, the death cry of the mind to feed the powers of the mind on which our very survival depends-that I do not know,\"\\n\\n He paused for a moment on the pavement, A whisper of straying wind moved in his dark cloak and lifted the pale hair from his collar, For a moment, it seemed as if he himself would drift onto it like a vast gray leaf. Then he walked on.\\n\\n \"It is not merely that we are dependent on the nourishment of the blood, James, and the psychic feed of the passing of the soul. Many of us are addicted to them. Some suffer this to greater or lesser degree, and some, in fact, take great pleasure in the addiction. Lotta used to prolong her fasts from the ultimate kill as much as possible, to sweeten them when they came, but it is a dangerous practice. In some, the craving rises almost to madness. It can make us hasty or careless, and in all things concerning us, carelessness is death.\"\\n\\n They were nearing the miniature maze of streets near the river where the Hotel Chambord stood; the cold smell of the Seine hung in the air, and already, down the cobbled side streets, the milk sellers were about. Asher studied sidelong the delicate profile, the white, hooked nose and loose thickness of colorless hair.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t relaxed in three hundred and fifty years,\" he said softly, \"have you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Do you relax when you sleep?\"\\n\\n The vampire did not look at him. \"I do not know. We all learn too late that sleep is not the same as it was.\"\\n\\n \"Do you dream?\"\\n\\n Ysidro paused, and again Asher had the impression he was on the point of being lifted and whirled away by the faint stirring of the wind. A faint flex line of a bitter smile touched the white silk of the skin, then smoothed away. \"Yes,\" Simon said expressionlessly. \"I dream. But they are not like human dreams.\"\\n\\n Asher wondered whether, when Simon sought whatever lair he had made for himself in Paris, he would dream of Brother Anthony, sorting bones in the dark.\\n\\n Then suddenly he was alone. Somewhere in the back of his mind he had the sensation of having once dreamed, himself, about a slim, cloaked form walking away toward the whitish mists of the Seine, but that was all.\\n\\n SAVAGE MURDERS IN LONDON THE RIPPER STALKS AGAIN?\\n\\n A series of shocking crimes rocked London last night when nine people-six women and three men-were brutally murdered in the Whitechapel and Limehouse districts of London between the hours of midnight and four in the morning. The first of the bodies, that of variety actress Sally Shore, was found by dustmen in the alley behind the Limehouse Road. She had been much bruised and cut about, so savagely that, when found, her body was almost com-pletely drained of blood. The eight other victims, found in various places in the neighborhood, were in a similar condition. Police remarked upon the fact that in no instance were screams or cries for help heard and upon the fact that, though the bodies were nearly drained of blood, very little was found at the scenes, leading them to believe that the murders took place elsewhere and the bodies were transported to the places where they were found...\\n\\n Asher set down the newspaper beside his midday breakfast of crois-sant and coffee, feeling cold to his bones. Nine!\\n\\n What had Simon said? After a long fast, the time always comes when the craving sets in and will not be denied-Nine.\\n\\n He felt sick.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t the London vampires. That much he knew. They had to live in London-Grippen, the Farrens, Chloe. But a strange vampire, hiding from them in London, might indeed be traceable through his kills, by those who knew what to look for. He had lain hidden as long as he could, fasting and silently murdering.\\n\\n He glanced at the date. It was this morning\u0027s paper. Last night, when he and Simon had been stalking Anthony in the darkness of the cata-combs, the murderer had struck again. This time it was not vampires who were his victims, but humans.\\n\\n Admittedly, he thought, glancing down the article, not particularly important humans-the women were all listed as \"variety actresses,\" seamstresses, or simply, \"young women.\" Given the area in which they were found and given the hour they were killed, there was no real doubt as to their true professions. But it made their murders no less atrocious; and it made the lives of everyone else in London no more secure.\\n\\n They had not cried out. Horribly, the thin, dreamy face of the woman on the train returned to him, the way her hand had fumbled willingly at her collar buttons, the glazed somnambulance of her eyes. He remem-bered Lydia\u0027s red hair, gleaming in the dim radiance of the gas lamps, and his palms grew cold.\\n\\n No! he told himself firmly. She knows the danger-she\u0027s sensible enough to stay indoors, close to\\n\\n people, at night...\\n\\n That knowledge did not help.\\n\\n He raised his head, staring sightlessly at the traffic jostling past the cafe where he sat. The thin mist of early dawn had burned away into a crisp, brittle sunlight, like crystal on the sepia buildings across the street and the India-ink traceries of the bare trees. The boulevardiers were out for a stroll, reveling in the last fine weather of autumn-leisured gentlemen in well-tailored blazers, men of letters, self-proclaimed wits andartistes. Open-topped carriages rolled past on their way to the Bois de Boulogne, affording glimpses of the elegant matrons of the Pa ri sgratin or of expensively dressed sin-the \"eight-spring luxury models\" of the demimonde.\\n\\n Asher saw none of it. He wondered where Simon might be found. Elysee de Montadour\u0027s hotel was, he was virtually certain, somewhere in the Marais; he supposed that given a day in which to search through the building records, he could locate the place. But there was no guar-antee that Ysidro was sleeping there-somehow he doubted that slim, enigmatic hidalgo would put himself anywhere near the power of Elysee and her cicisbeos-and his visit to Ernchester House had taught him the folly of entering vampire nests alone. And in any case, what he wanted now most to know was something which could only be ascer-tained while the sun was in the sky.\\n\\n He felt absently in his pocket for the wax tablets and wondered what time the guards at the catacombs had their dinner.\\n\\n One of the advantages of working for the Foreign Office, Asher had found, had been a nodding acquaintance with the fringes of the under-world in a dozen cities across Europe. His Oxford colleagues would have been considerably startled had they realized how easily their unas-suming Lecturer in Philology could have obtained any number of strange services, from burglary to murder to \"nameless vices\"-most of which had perfectly good names, in Latin, at least. In spite of the fact that England and France were the closest of allies, he had in the past had cause to need keys cut in a hurry in Paris with no questions asked and, on this occasion, he knew precisely where to go.\\n\\n As it was neither the first nor the third Saturday of the month, he had little fear of meeting parties of tourists at the catacombs or the large numbers of guards that the Office of Directory and Treasury considered necessary to herd them through. The catacombs would be staffed by one or at most two old pensioners of the State, and, though the dinner hour was long over by the time Asher reached Montrouge, with the aid of luck and human nature, they might be together gossiping instead of keeping watch at both entrances.\\n\\n And why should they watch? The doors were locked, and who in their right mind would wish to break into the Empire of the Dead?\\n\\n Luck and human nature seemed to be in full operation that afternoon when Asher reached the inconspicuous back door of the catacombs through which they had entered last night. It was locked. Although a sign instructed him to apply for information in the Place Denfert-Ro-chereau several streets away, still he thumped for several seconds on the door.\\n\\n Only silence greeted him, which was as he had hoped. The keys Jacques la Puce had made for him that afternoon worked perfectly- even on this quiet street, picking the lock would have been noticed by someone. He slipped inside, appropriated another tin lantern, and made his way down the stair, locking the grille again behind him. It was just past three in the afternoon; these days darkness was complete by about six. If nothing else, he thought, he might ascertain whether vampires past a certain age were free of the leaden trance of the daylight hours. Beyond that...\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know. As a mortal it was laughable to think he could locate Brother Anthony in the haunted maze. But it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that his presence there, alone and unprotected, might pique the ancient friar\u0027s curiosity and draw him out of hiding, as it had done last night.\\n\\n After a long inner debate he had left his silver chains back at his hotel, since in all probability they would afford him no protection should Brother Anthony turn against him, and might very well be con-strued as a gesture of bad faith. In last night\u0027s case it had been merely manners-like carrying a gun to a wedding reception, Ysidro had said; Asher hadn\u0027t mentioned that he\u0027d done that upon occasion. But he was uncertain how much Brother Anthony would sense, and it was vital that he speak to the old man this afternoon.\\n\\n Six hundred years, he thought, as the first of Ysidro\u0027s chalked arrows came into the wavery circle of the lantern\u0027s light. The last of the Capets had been on the throne when Anthony had first refused to die-when he had made the decision to accept immortality upon any terms. Asher wondered whether the monk had been hiding all that time, or whether he had been driven gradually to it and to madness, living among the corpses in the crypts of the Holy Innocents.\\n\\n His breath puffed in faint smoke in the glow of the lamp; it was cold in the endless galleries. The only sounds were the soft scrunching of wet pebbles underfoot and the occasional creak of the lantern\u0027s handle. It had been unnerving to come here last night, with Ysidro as protection, even though at that time they had expected to encounter no one. It was terrifying now, absolutely alone with the darkness under the earth wait-ing just beyond the glow of the lamp. Oddly enough, Asher\u0027s fears turned less upon the vampire he sought and more upon the occasional, illogical fits of dread that the roof should cave in and bury him alive in the darkness.\\n\\n He saw the dark gates with a kind of relief-for he had feared, too, lest he miss one of Ysidro\u0027s chalked arrows. The ranked walls of brown bones and staring skulls seemed less dreadful to him than those silent aisles of empty rock.\\n\\n It took him longer than he had counted upon to find Brother Antho-ny\u0027s private haunts in the ossuary. He missed his way twice and wan-dered-he did not know how long-among the brown walls of bones, searching for the branching tunnel, the tiny altar. At last he thought to trace Ysidro\u0027s slender bootprints in the watery mud among the pebbles of the floor, and after that found the arrow fairly easily. It came to him then that the psychic miasma that the vampires were capable of throw-ing around themselves had extended itself to Anthony\u0027s entire territory. Simply, it was easy to miss the place, easy to be thinking of something else. No wonder none of the guards came near here. They were proba-bly not even aware of avoiding the place at all. They merely did. It explained certain things about Ernchester House as well.\\n\\n He passed the chaos of the fallen bones, then the neat rows of pel-vises, the decaying skulls assembled against the eventuality of final Judgment. With a kind of medieval morbidity, the ossuary had been established, like the ancient enamel houses, to turn the mind to man\u0027s mortality; in spite of himself, Asher found his reflections drawn to the men he had killed, and, disturbingly, the men who would undoubtedly die in any future war because of all those charts and plans and informa-tion he had smuggled out of Austria, China, and Germany, tacked away in his socks or his notes on consonantal shift.\\n\\n From what he knew of some of them, he had the uncomfortable sensation that in terms of ultimate responsibility, his personal death toll might well end up rivaling poor Anthony\u0027s, who only killed to prolong his guilt-riddled Unlife.\\n\\n Before the steps of the altar, scattered with drifts of bone fragments, Asher stopped, listening to the terrible silence all around him. Banked along the walls, decaying skulls watched nun with mournful eyes.\\n\\n His whisper ran like water along the bones, vanishing into the stony darkness. \"Frater Antonius .,.\"\\n\\n The sibilance of it hissed back at him,\\n\\n \"In nomine Patris, Antonius...\"\\n\\n Perhaps he did not sleep near this place at all. Asher sat gingerly down on the bare stone of the step, setting the lantern beside him. He took out his watch and was both surprised and vexed at how much time it had taken him to reach this place-it would be difficult to tell, now, whether a sufficiently ancient vampire would be awake in the daylight hours. But it could not be helped. He pulled his coat more closely around him, rested his chin on his drawn-up knees, and settled down to wait.\\n\\n The lantern\u0027s metal hissed softly in the absolute stillness. He listened intently, hearing nothing but now and then the far-off slither of a rat picking its way across the bones. The cold seemed to deepen and inten-sify with his inactivity-he rubbed his hands over the lantern\u0027s heat, wishing he had thought to bring gloves. Once the red eyes of a rat glinted at him from the darkness beyond that tiny pool of light, then vanished. Ysidro had said vampires could summon certain beasts, as they could humans-how long, he wondered, had Brother Anthony depended upon that ability for his dinner?\\n\\n That led to the unnerving reflection that he might be doing so now. Howdid the vampire glamour work, once the vampire\u0027s eyes had met those of his chosen victim? Was that why it had seemed to him such a good idea to come here, alone and in daylight? I could have summoned her from anywhere on the train... Ysidro had said, unwinding the purple scarf from the poor woman\u0027s throat, drawing the pins gently from her h air .Do you believe I can do this to whomever I will?\\n\\n True, he felt no sleepiness, none of the dreamy unreality of that epi-sode on the train, but that might only mean that after centuries of practice, Brother Anthony was very, very good.\\n\\n The craving becomes unbearable.,.\\n\\n He remembered the newspaper headline and shivered.\\n\\n Still Brother Anthony did not appear.\\n\\n The kerosene in the lantern\u0027s reservoir was now almost gone. He realized he\u0027d have to leave if he were to find his way back out of the dark; the thought that the light might fail him while he was yet in the tunnels was terrifying and made him curse himself for not searching the vestibule for the stubs of the tourists\u0027 candles while he was about it. He straightened his back and looked around him in the darkness. \"An-thony?\" he whispered in Latin. I\u0027m here to talk to you. I know you\u0027re there.\"\\n\\n There was no response. Only the skulls, staring at him with blank eyeholes, a hundred generations of Parisians, their bones neatly sorted and awaiting the final collation of Judgment Day.\\n\\n Feeling a little silly, Asher spoke again to the empty dark. At least, if what Ysidro and Bully Joe Davies had said was true, Anthony could hear him from a great distance away. \"My name is James Asher; I am working with Don Simon Ysidro to find a renegade vampire in London. We think he can hunt by day as well as by night. He is a killer, brutal and indiscriminate, of men and vampires, bound not even by the laws that your kind make among themselves. Will you help us?\" There was no movement in the darkness, only stillness, like the slow fall of dust.\\n\\n \"Anthony, we need your help, humans and vampires alike. He has to be one of your contemporaries, or older yet. Only you can track him, can find him for us. Will you help us?\"\\n\\n A rhyme singsonged its way around in his head, turning back on itself like a child\u0027s chant:\\n\\n But the silence was unbroken,\\n\\n And the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken\\n\\n Was the whispered word, \"Lenore.\" This I whispered, and an echo\\n\\n Murmured back the word, \"Lenore.\" Merely this and nothing more,\\n\\n Poe, he thought, and totally appropriate for this waiting hush, this darkness that was not quite empty, and not quite dead.\\n\\n Merely this and nothing more... merely this and nothing more.\\n\\n On impulse, he took the newspaper from his pocket and laid it on the steps of lie altar, folded open to the article about the murders. He lifted the almost-empty lantern, and the moving light twisted over the dead faces like a sudden shriek of mocking laughter, the laughter of those who have learned the secret of what lies on the other side of the invisi-ble wall of death.\\n\\n \"I must go,\" he said to the darkness. I\u0027ll be back tomorrow night, and the night after that, until you speak to me. Please help us, Anthony. Nine humans and four vampires have died already, and now we know there will be more. We need your help.\"\\n\\n Like a curtain swinging to, the darkness closed behind him as he passed along the corridors; and whether any watched him out, he did not know. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/those-who-hunt-the-night-james-asher-1/page-13.html","bookId":2489,"book":{"id":2489,"title":"Those Who Hunt the Night (James Asher #1)","description":"Storyline: Those Who Hunt the Night (James Asher #1) \\n The vampires had been living in London since the time of Elizabeth I, but now they were being ruthlessly murdered by someone who ripped their coffins open for the light of day to burn them to ashes.
