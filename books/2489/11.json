{"id":105021,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"It is not the city that it was.\" If there were nuances to that soft, light voice of bitterness, anger, or regret, it would have taken a vampire\u0027s hyperacute perceptions to read them-Asher himself heard none. Around him the closed cab jos-tled and swayed. When his elbow, raised where his hand, linked through the hanging strap, came in contact with the window, he felt through his coat sleeve the chill of the glass. The noises of the street came to him dimly: the clatter of wheels, on pavement of wood and asphalt, rebounding from the high brown walls of theimmeubles , the occasional hoots of motorcars; the pungent cursing of the sidewalk ven-dors; and the gay, drifting frenzy of violin and accordion that spoke of some caf cone\u0027 in progress. Blindfolded, he could see nothing, but the sounds of Paris were dis-tinctive and as bright a kaleidoscope as its sights. No one, he thought, who had ever been here ever questioned how it was in this place that Impressionism came to be, Ysidro\u0027s voice went on, \"I have no sense of being at home here-this sterile, inorganic town where everything is thrice washed before and after anyone touches it. It is the same everywhere, of course, but in Paris it seems particularly ironic. They seem to have taken this man Pasteur very seriously.\" The noises changed; the crowd of vehicles around them seemed more dense, but the echoes of buildings were gone. Asher smelled the sewery stink of the river. A bridge, then-and judging by the length and the din of a small square and buildings halfway along, it could only be the Pont Neuf, a name which, like that of New College, Oxford, had not been accurate for a number of centuries. In a short time, they turned right, and continued in that direction. Asher calculated they were headed for the old Marais district, the one-time aristocratic neighborhoods that had not been badly damaged by either the Prussians, the Communards, or Baron Haussmann, but said nothing. If Ysidro chose to believe that blindfolding him would keep him in absolute ignorance of the whereabouts of the Paris vampires, he-and they-were welcome to do so. He was uncomfortably aware that the Paris vampires had not even the threat of the day killer to reconcile them to the presence of a human in their midst. \"My most vivid memories of Paris are of its mud, of course,\" the vampire went on quietly. \"Everyone\u0027s were, who knew it then. It was astounding stuff,/ a boue de Paris- black and vile, like a species of oil. You could never eradicate either its stain or its smell. It clung to every-thing, and you could nose Paris six miles away in open country. In the days when every gentleman wore white silk stockings, it was pure hell.\" The faintest hint of self-mockery crept into his voice, and Asher pic-tured that still and haughty face framed in the white of a court wig. \"The beggars all smelled of it, too,\" Ysidro added. \"Hunting in the poor quarters was always a nightmare. Now...\" He paused, and there was a curious flex in that supple voice, \"It would take me a long time to relearn Paris. Everything has changed. It is strange territory to me now. I do not know its boltholes or hiding places; I no longer even speak the language properly. Every time I say c z instead of ce, je ne Vaime point instead of/ e ne V\u0027aimepas, every time I say je fhquel que chose instead ofjel\u0027aifait, I mark myself as a stranger.\" \"You only mark yourself as a foreigner who has learned French from a very old book,\" Asher replied easily, \"Have you ever talked to a Brahman in London for the first time? Or heard an American south-erner speak of \u0027redding up a room\u0027?\" The cab stopped; under the silk scarf bound over his eyes, Asher could detect very little light and knew that the street itself was quite dark, particularly for a city as brightly illuminated as Paris. The place was quiet, too, save for the far-off noises of traffic in some nearby square-the Place de la Bastille at a guess- but the smell was the smell of poverty, of too many families sharing too few privies, of cheap cooking, and of dirt. The Marais, Asher knew, had declined drastically from the days when Louis XV had courted Jeanne Poisson through its candlelit salons. There was a slight jogging as the vampire got out of the cab and the muted exchange of voices and, presumably, francs. Then a light, firm hand touched his arm, guiding him, and he heard the cab rattle away down the cobbles. \"Do you speak Spanish any more at all?\" There was level pavement, then a step down, and a sense of close walls and cold shade-the doorway vestibule whose gates would open into the central court of one of the big oldhotels particuliers. Beside him, very quiet, came Ysidro\u0027s voice: \"I doubt I could even make my-self understood in Madrid.\" \"Have you never gone back there, then?\" In the ensuing moment of silence, Asher could almost see Ysidro\u0027s eyes resting on him with their calm, noncommittal gaze while the vam-pire sifted through all possible responses for the one which would give the least. \"What would be the point?\" he asked at last. \"My people are, and have been since the Reconquista, suspicious and intolerant.\" Asher realized with a small start that by my people he meant Spaniards, not vampires. \"With the Inquisition probing every cellar for heretics and Jews, what chance would a vampire stand? It is possible in most cir-cumstances to avoid the touch of silver, but such avoidance is, in civi-lized countries, not marked. Were it noticed in Spain in those days, it would have been fatal.\" Asher heard then a faint scratching, like the furtive scuffle of a mouse behind a wainscot, as the vampire scraped at the panels of the door with his nail, a sound which only other vampires would hear. But other vampires, of course, would have detected their voices in the street. He heard nothing within, but sensed feet floating weightlessly down the stair; his heart, it seemed, was thumping uncomfortably fast. \"Do they know about me?\" he asked. They had taken the night mail by way of Calais. The porters had grumbled at the size and awkwardness of the huge leather-and-iron trunk that was ticketed as part of Asher\u0027s luggage, but had been sur-prised at its comparative lightness. \"Wot you got in there, mate, bleedin\u0027 feathers?\" \"I trust that all travel arrangements will go as we have made them,\" Ysidro had commented, leaning on the Lord Warden\u0027s aft rail and watching the few twinkling lights on the Admiralty Pier fade into the thin soup of iron-colored mist. \"But it never pays to take chances.\" He glanced beside him at Asher, whose mind had already recorded the slight flush of color in the white cheeks, the warmth in those cool fingers. Standing beside him, gloved hands on the rail and collar turned up against the raw cold of the night, Asher had been conscious of a vague disgust and alarm, not at the vampire, but at himself, for noting these signs as a mere deductive detail and not the certain evidence of some poor wretch\u0027s murder in a London slum. He had felt angry at himself and frustrated, as he had often been in his latter dealings with the Foreign Office, burdened with a sense of performing what was only marginally the lesser of two colossal wrongs. The vampire\u0027s gaze had turned, as if he could still descry the dark shape of Dover\u0027s cliffs, invisible now in the west. \"At the risk of sound-ing crude,\" he had gone on carefully, \"I would like to point out to you that at present I am the only one protecting you from Grippen and his cadre. Were you to destroy me, you might perhaps ensure your lady\u0027s safety for a season, for I am the only one who knows the terms of our agreement...\" Asher had started, relief loosening a knot of apprehension in his chest that had been with him, it seemed, so long that he had almost forgotten its origin. With the possibility of a daylight-hunting vampire looming uneasily in his mind, he had not dared another meeting with Lydia, but it had been one of the hardest things he had ever done simply to take his leave of her by anonymous telegram. Ysidro, he presumed, would be able to protect him in Paris-if protecting him was in fact his intention-but he turned cold with dread at the thought of Lydia staying in London alone. Only the knowledge that she was enormously sensible and would wait, as ordered, to hear from him before undertaking anything re-motely dangerous-the knowledge that she understood the situation- made it bearable and, then, bearable only in relative terms. He felt a surge of gratitude toward the vampire of which he was almost ashamed-gratitude and surprise that Ysidro would have told him this. \"But you would never be able to go near her again,\" the vampire went on. \"The others would track you and destroy you, as one who knows too much. In so doing, they would undoubtedly find her as well.\" Asher glanced sourly at his companion. \"And how do I know that won\u0027t be the case in any event, when this affair is over?\" The vampire\u0027s gaze had been unfathomable in the dim glow of the steamer\u0027s deck lights, but Asher thought he heard a trace of unhuman amusement in his voice. \"From that, too, I shall protect you. Do you not trust me, as I perforce trust you?\" As usual, he could not tell whether Ysidro was being ironic or not. Long before the train had reached the Gare du Nord, Ysidro had left their compartment; Asher had not seen him anywhere in the station during the nuisance of customs in the Salle des Bagages, nor in the square or the streets outside. He was becoming used to this. The sky was already paling; he\u0027d wired ahead to the Chambord, a small hotel in the Rue de la Harpe where he often stayed when in Paris in his Oxford persona, and they had rooms waiting for him. Entering the tiny lobby, with its fusty smells of cooking and its moldering Empire furnishings, it had troubled him that in all the years that he had known Paris, the city had been the abode of vampires. That was true of London as well, and he wondered if he would ever be able to return to the way in which he had once looked on the world. Of course, early on in his career, he had lost the innocence of looking on the world as the bright surface of a beautiful pond. His tamperings with the Foreign Office, with the shadow life of information, and the murky dramas into which the cursed Department had pitchforked him had taken care of that. But beneath his continual awareness of secrets, boltholes, and dangers, there was a new awareness, as if he had sud-denly become cognizant, not only of the fish that swam beneath the surface of the pond, but of things utterly unimaginable that moved through the black mud at its bottom. He had slept until late in the day in his small room up under the high bulge of the roof slates, then bathed and dressed in a thoughtful frame of mind. He had written to Lydia, assuring her of his safe arrival, and mailed the letter enclosed in another to one of his students who had agreed to forward anything for Miss Merridew. It would reach her a day late, but better that, he reasoned, than risk the vampires tracing her. After a light dinner in a cafe, he sought out the Place des In-nocents, the square near the vast central markets of the city, where once the Church of the Holy Innocents and its notorious cemetery had stood. There was nothing there now-a tree-lined place with a Renaissance fountain, hemmed in by the gray bulk of theHolies on one side and high, brown-frontedimmeubles on three others. The vampire of the Holy Innocents had slept in the crypt, Ysidro had said-like Rhys the Minstrel, haunting the crypts of the old Church of St. Giles near the river until the town grew large enough around him so that its inhabit-ants became strangers to one another and did not notice one more white-faced stranger walking the night in their midst. Standing now at Ysidro\u0027s side, straining his ears to catch even the whisper of descending feet crossing the cobbled court beyond the door, he wondered if that crypt was still there, buried beneath the soil like the subcellar of Calvaire\u0027s house in Lambeth, forgotten to all save those who were interested in places proof against the light of day. The vampires might know. That and other things. He had turned from the Place des Innocents, followed the Rue St. Denis toward the gray sheet of the river, shining between the dove-colored buildings of its banks. To them, this startlingly clean city, with its immaculate streets, its chestnut trees rusty with autumn, was only a topcoat of varnish on a dark swamp of memories, another city entirely. He had stood for some time on the bank above the quays of the Seine, staring at the gray tangle of bridges upstream and down, the gothic forest of pinnacles that clustered on the lie de la Cite and the square, dreaming towers of Notre Dame. And just beneath them, on the em-bankment, he had gazed consideringly at the massive iron grillworks that barred passers-by from the subterranean mazes of the Paris sewers. \"The sewers?\" Elysee de Montadour wrinkled her long nose in a delib-erate gesture of distaste, her diamonds winking in the blaze of the gas-light. \"What vampire in his right mind would haunt them? Hm?\" She shivered affectedly. All her gestures, Asher observed, were theatrical, a conscious imitation of human mannerism rather than a reminiscence of its actual spontaneity, as if she had studied something not native to her. He found himself preferring Don Simon\u0027s uncanny stillness-the Span-ish vampire stood, gray-gloved hands resting like hunting cats on the curving Empire back of the lady\u0027s divan, seeming by comparison more than ever immobile-petrified long ago, as Lydia had said, in ectoplasmic ivory. \"Do you ever hunt in them?\" Though none of the other vampires in the long, gold-papered salon came near them, he was conscious of the light run of their voices behind him, as they played cards with spectral speed and deftness or chatted with the half-murmuring whisper of the wind. Seated in a spindly Louis XVI chair opposite Elysee, he knew they were watching him and listening as only vampires could listen, like so many suave and mocking sharks lying just beneath the surface of water, whose shore he could never hope to reach in time. In one corner of the salon, a tall girl whose dark shoulders rose like bronze above a gown of oyster-colored satin played the piano-Tchaikovsky, but with a queer, dark curl to it, a sensuousness and syncopation, like music trick-ling from behind a mirror that looked into Hell. \"Fah, and subject myself to the rheumatism?\" Elysee laughed, a cold and tinkling sound without mirth, and made a great play with her swan\u0027s-down fan. \"And for what,enfint?\" One of the graceful young men who made up her coterie of fledglings lounged over to the end of her divan. This one was brown-haired, his blue eyes bright against rounded and beautiful features; Asher wondered if Elysee had made them all vampires for their looks. Like all of the half dozen or so of Elysee\u0027s cadre, he was dressed in the height of fashion, his jet black evening clothes meticu-lously tailored, contrasting sharply with the white of his shirt and of the flesh above. \"A sewer sweeper, whom one must kill without conversa-tion and hide, like a dog burying carrion? Where is the fun in that?\" His fangs gleamed as he grinned down at Asher. Elysee shrugged alabaster shoulders above a dark green gown. \"In any case, their superintendents count the sweepers very carefully when they go down, and when they come up. And they arecanaille, as Serge says, and no fun in the hunt.\" She smiled briefly, dreamy delight in her green eyes with their terrible vampire glitter, like a greedy girl savoring the taste of forbidden liqueur. \"Alors, there are eight hundred miles of sewers down there. He would wither up like a prune, this Great, Terri-ble, Ancient Vampire of Paris whom no one has ever seen...\" \"What about the catacombs?\" Simon asked softly, disregarding the mockery in her voice. A curious silence lifted into the room like an indrawn breath. The piano stilled. \"We all been there, sure.\" The dark girl rose from the instrument\u0027s bench, moved across the room with a deliberate, lounging slowness that somehow partook of the same eerie weightlessness that comprised the other vampires\u0027 speed. Instinctively Asher forced himself to concentrate on watching her, sensing that if he did not, she would be all but invisible in the movement of his eye. They had been speaking French- Ysidro\u0027s, as he had said, not only old-fashioned but with an occasional queer childish singsong quality to its pronunciation-but this girl spoke En-glish, with a liquid American drawl. In spite of the almost unbearable lentitudinousness of her movements, she was behind him before he was ready for it, her tiny hand molding its way idly across his shoulders, as if memorizing the contours of them through the cloth of his coat. \"They keep count there, too, of workers and visitors. You hid there, didn\u0027t you, Elysee, during the siege?\" There was just a touch of malice in her voice, like the artfully acci-dental stab of a pin, and Elysee\u0027s green eyes flickered at the reminder of what must have been an undignified flight from the rioting Com-munards. \"And who would not have?\" she demanded after a moment. \"I took refuge there during the Terror as well, with Henriette du Caens. They weren\u0027t ossuaries then, you know-just old quarries in the feet of Montrouge, stretching away into darkness.i?/ e \" stir, Henriette used to say she thought there might be-something else-there. But I never saw nor heard anything.\" There was a touch of defiance in her voice. \"But you were a fledgling then,\" Simon replied in his soft voice, \"were you not?\" \"Fledgling or not, I was not blind.\" She tapped half-irritably, half-playfully at his knuckles with her fan-when the ivory sticks came down Simon\u0027s gloved fingers were no longer beneath them, though Asher did not see the hand move. She turned back to Asher, a hand-some woman if not pretty, with the face and body of a woman in her prime and eyes that had long since ceased to be human. She shrugged. \"Eh Men, that was long ago. And toward the end Henriette feared everything. Francois and 1 had to hunt for her, among the mobs that roamed the city by night; we brought them to her there. Aye, and risked our lives, when wearing the wrong color of kerchief could set them all baying \u0027Jla lanterne\u0027 like the pack of scurvy hounds they were! Fran-gois de Montadour was the original owner of thishostel, you under-stand.\" Her wave, wrist properly leading, was airy and formal, like a painting by David; the white plumes nodded in her hair. There were a dozen huge candelabra burning as well as the gas jets along walls and ceiling-the light caught in the glittering festoons of crystal lusters, in the long mirrors that ranged one wall, and in the black glass of the twelve-foot windows along the other, all thrown back in an unholy halo around her. \"He, Henriette, and I were the only ones to escape the Terror, and even Frangois did not, in the end, escape. After it was over...\" She shrugged again, a gesture designed to show off the whiteness of her shoulders. Behind him, Asher could feel the dark American girl move closer to his chair, her body touching his back, her hands resting on his shoulders, the cold of them seeming to radiate against his flesh. \"Henriette never recovered, though she lived near a life span after that.Eh Men, she was after all a lady of Versailles. She used to say, nights when we had brought her some drunkard whose blood filled her with wine in turn, that no one who had not experienced the sweetness of those days could ever understand just what it was which had been lost. Perhaps she could not get used to the fact that it was gone.\" \"She was an old lady,\" the dark girl\u0027s voice said, syrupy and languor-ous from behind Asher\u0027s head. \"She didn\u0027t need no drunkard\u0027s blood to loosen her tongue about the old days, about the kings and about Ver-sailles.\" Her nails idled at the ends of his hair, as if she toyed with a pet dog. \"Just an old lady whinin\u0027 for yesterday.\" \"When one day you return to Charleston, Hyacinthe,\" Ysidro said quietly in the English in which Hyacinthe spoke, \"and see where the American army shelled the streets where you grew up, when you find that men themselves have changed there, I hope you will remember.\" \"Men never change.\" She shifted her body again, her hip touching Asher\u0027s shoulder, a disturbing shiver passing into his body as if commu-nicated by electricity. \"They only die... and there are always more men.\" \"Even so.\" Asher found himself sitting very still, aware that Simon, behind Elysee\u0027s divan, was poised on the verge of lightning speed; aware, too, of the touch of a quarter-inch of Hyacinthe\u0027s fingertip against the skin of his throat. At Ysidro\u0027s request, he had left his silver chains behind at the hotel. They would never have let him in, the vampire had said, if they\u0027d suspected, and such a show of bad faith would have damaged Ysidro\u0027s own somewhat questionable standing among them. Though Asher could not see it, he was aware of the quadroon girl\u0027s glance, teasing and defiant, daring Simon to stop her if she decided to kill this human protege of his, challenging him to try his speed against hers. Ysidro went on softly, his eyes never leaving hers, \"As for Henriette, she was a lady of Versailles, speaking even the language of \u0027this coun-try,\u0027 as they used to call it: that enchanted Cythera that floated like an almond blossom balanced on a zephyr\u0027s breath above a cesspit. I under-stand her comparing the world after Napoleon marched through it to what it was before and finding it wanting. I think she simply grew tired of watching for danger, tired of struggling-tired of life. I saw her the last time I visited Paris, before the Prussians came, and I was not surprised to hear that she did not survive the siege. Did she ever speak, Elysee, of the Vampire of the Innocents?\" \"No.\" Elysee fanned herself, a nervous gesture, since Asher had ob-served that the other vampires seemed to feel neither heat nor cold. The others were slowly gathering around his chair in a semicircle behind Hyacinthe, facing Elysee on the divan and Simon at her back. \"Yes. Only that there was one.\" She made a scornful gesture which did not quite disguise her discomfort at the topic. \"The Innocents was a foul place, the ground mucky with the bodies rotting a few niches beneath the feet, skulls and bones lying everywhere on the ground. It stank, too. In the booksellers\u0027 and lingerie vendors\u0027 stands that were built in the arches, you could look up and see through the chinks in the rafters the bones stacked in the lofts above. The Great Flesh-Eater of Paris, we called it. Francois and the others-Henriette, Jean de Valois, old Louis-Charles d\u0027Auvergne-sometimes talked about the stories of a vampire who lived there, a vampire no one ever saw. After I became vampire I went there to look for him, but the place.,. I didn\u0027t like it.\" An old fear flickered briefly in those hard emerald eyes. \"Nobody blames you for that, honey, I\u0027m sure,\" Hyacinthe purred with malicious sympathy. \"I\u0027m thinking if he ever bided there at all, he\u0027s got to have been crazy as a loon.\" \"Did Calvaire ever go there?\" Asher inquired, turning his head to look up into her face, and she smiled down at him, beautiful as a long-contemplated sin. \"It was all gone \u0027fore Calvaire was even bit, honey.\" \"Did he go to the catacombs, then? Did he ever speak of this-this spectral vampire?\" \"Calvaire,\" sniffed one of the other vampires, a dark-haired boy whom Asher had guessed had barely begun to grow a beard when Elysee had claimed him. \"The Great Vampire of Paris. He might just.\" Asher glanced over at him curiously in the shimmering refulgence of light. \"Why?\" Behind him, Hyacinthe replied with silky scorn, \"Because it was the kind of thing the Great Vampire of Paris would do.\" \"He was very taken with being-one of us,\" explained Elysee slowly. The brown-haired young man, Serge, seated himself gracefully on the divan at Elysee\u0027s feet. \"We all have a little fun, when we can,\" he explained with a grin that would have been disarming, but for the fangs. \"Calvaire was just a little grandiose about it.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" Hyacinthe\u0027s fingers touched his hair. \"You wouldn\u0027t, under the cir-cumstances.\" \"Calvaire was a braggart, a boaster,\" Elysee said, closing her swan\u0027s-down fan, stroking the soft white fluff between fingers as hard and as pale as the ivory of the sticks. \"Like some others.\" Her glance touched Hyacinthe for a malignant instant. \"To sit with your victim in an opera box, a cafe, or a carriage-to feel the blood with your lips through the skin, spinning it out as long as you can, waiting... then to go drink elsewhere, only to quench the thirst, and go back the next night to him again, to that personal, innocent death...\" She smiled dreamily once more, and Asher was conscious of a slight movement among the vam-pires behind him and of the swift flick of Ysidro\u0027s eyes. \"But Valentin carried it a step further, a dangerous step. Perhaps it was partly that he wanted power, that he wanted fledglings of his own, though he dared not make them here in Paris, where I rule, where I dominated him through that which he gave me in passing from life to... everlife. But I think he did it for the-the \u0027kick,\u0027 as you say in English-alone. He would sometimes let his victim know, especially the victims who foundit piquant to know how near they flirted with death. \"He would lead them into it, seduce them... he had a fine grace and would play death like an instrument, drinking it, in all its perverse sweetness.Bien stir, he could not be permitted to continue.,.\" \"It is a dangerous thing,\" the boy vampire to Asher\u0027s right said, \"to let anyone know just who we are and what we are, no matter what the reason.\" \"He was furious when I forbade it him,\" Elysee remembered. \"Furi-ous when I forbade him to make fledglings of his own, his own coterie... for that was the reason he gave. But I think that it was just that he enjoyed it.\" \"But then,\" Hyacinthe murmured, \"the ones he told always expected to win.\" Something in her voice made Asher look up; her hand caught him very lightly under the jaw, forcing his head back so that his eyes met hers. Under her fingers, he could feel the movement of his own pulse; she was looking down into his eyes and smiling. For a moment it did not seem to him that he breathed, sensing Simon\u0027s readiness to spring and knowing there was no way-even if Elysee\u0027s fledglings did not try to stop him-that he could cross the distance in the time it would take Hyacinthe to strike. Elysee\u0027s voice was soft, as if she feared to tip some fragile balance. \"Let him alone.\" He saw Hyacinthe\u0027s mocking smile widen and felt the slight tensing of her fingertips against his throat. Quite deliberately, he put up his hand and grasped the cold wrist. For an instant it was like pulling at the limb of a tree; then it yielded, mockingly fluid in his, and she stepped back as he stood up. But she still smiled into his eyes, lazily amused, as if he\u0027d failed some test of nerve, and there was in the honey-dark eyes the savoring of what it was like to seduce a victim who knew what was happening. His eyes held hers; then, just as deliberately, he dismissed her and turned back to Elysee. \"So you don\u0027t believe Calvaire sought out this-this most ancient vampire in Paris.\" The fan snapped open again, indignant. Elysee\u0027s eyes were on Hy-acinthe, not on him. \"I am the most ancient vampire in Paris,Monsieur le Professeur,\" she said decidedly. \"There is no other, nor has there been for many years. Anden tout cas, you-and others-\" Her glance shot spitefully from Hyacinthe to Ysidro, who had somehow come around the divan to her side and within easy grasping range of Asher. \"-would do well to remember that the single law among vampires, the single law that all must obey, is that no vampire will kill another vam-pire. And no vampire.. \" Her eyes narrowed, moved to Asher, and then back to the slender, delicate Spaniard standing at her side. \"... will do that which endangers other vampires by giving away their haunts, their habits, or the very fact of their existence, to human-kind.\" Ysidro inclined his head, his pale hair falling forward over the gray velvet of his collar, like cobweb in the bonfire of gaslight and crystal. \"Fear nothing, mistress. I do not forget.\" His gloved hand closed like a manacle around Asher\u0027s wrist, and he led him from the salon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/those-who-hunt-the-night-james-asher-1/page-11.html","bookId":2489,"book":{"id":2489,"title":"Those Who Hunt the Night (James Asher #1)","description":"Storyline: Those Who Hunt the Night (James Asher #1) The vampires had been living in London since the time of Elizabeth I, but now they were being ruthlessly murdered by someone who ripped their coffins open for the light of day to burn them to ashes.
