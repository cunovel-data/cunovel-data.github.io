{"id":31629,"no":3,"title":"Chapter II Retrospect","content":"The Franks, inhabiting both sides of the Rhine, held a leading position among the German tribes about the middle of the fifth century, three hundred years before the time of Charlemagne. They invaded Gaul from the north and subdued that part of it occupied by the Alemanni[6] and Burgundians,[7] and securely established themselves in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country, southern Gaul being occupied by the West Goths.[8] 21 About this period Clovis[9] made his appearance among the Franks. He was brave to the extreme of hardihood and at the same time thoroughly unprincipled. He ruled over one family[10] of Franks, relatives of his being chiefs of the others. The family ancestor of the Franks was Merov?us, from whom the Merovingians derived their name. Notwithstanding their relationship, the Frank chiefs were in continual strife with each other, but Clovis at last secured a kind of sovereignty over all the families and forced his relations to furnish him with warriors. As soon as this was accomplished, he set about making his power absolute and suppressing their mutual quarrels, as he was determined they should assist him in further invasions of Gaul. The only remnant of Roman power left in Gaul (that part of it lying between the Seine and the Loire) still maintained its political independence. It was against this region, which was under the rule of the Roman patrician Syagrius, that Clovis next directed his operations. He provoked him to war, defeated him, and forced the West Goth King, Alaric the Second (who was ultimately slain in battle by Clovis), with whom Syagrius sought shelter, to give him up. He then strangled him in prison. 22 Clovis next made war against the Burgundians, who, as has been said, occupied the southeastern part of Gaul and were ruled at that time by two brothers, Gundobald and Godegisel. Both fell victims to his cruelty. One of the dead brothers left a daughter Clotilde, for whose hand Clovis appealed to her uncle, the Burgundian chief. The uncle did not dare refuse Clovis’s request, and Clotilde, the Christian, became his wife. She immediately set about the task of converting him, but did not succeed at that time. His purpose was to secure her inheritance, not her religious faith. Before concluding final arrangements with the Burgundians another problem presented itself for settlement. The Alemanni were threatening Siegbert, one of his relations. This gave him a sufficient pretext for drawing his sword against them. A decisive battle was fought at Toul.[11] It was a bloody encounter, and victory at first appeared to favor the Alemanni. Thereupon, thinking of Clotilde’s appeals to him, he invoked the Christians’ God before his whole army and promised to become a Christian if he won the victory. Thereupon he massed his forces and hurled them upon the enemy with such fierceness that the onset was irresistible. The Alemanni were decimated, and Clovis occupied the entire region between the Neckar and Lahn and forced it to supply warriors to make good his losses. In the same year he and three thousand of his followers were baptized at Rheims. 23 The German chiefs who had embraced Christianity at an earlier period had given their adhesion to the Arian confession, but Clovis gave his to the Catholic. There was great rejoicing in Rome, and the Pope conferred upon him the title of “All Christian King,” which title also descended to his Frankish successors. Later the clergy spread the report abroad that a miracle took place at the time of Clovis’s baptism. It was said that there was no consecrated oil at hand. As the bishop stood helpless at the altar a white dove suddenly flew down with a flask of oil in its beak, a sign that his name had been inscribed in heaven and that his conversion had given delight to God and the angels. To satisfy the sceptical, the wonderful flask was preserved in the Cathedral of Rheims, and the precious contents were not diminished, though it was used whenever the rite was repeated. In fact the flask was used at every coronation down to the close of the last century. The story of its origin spread and is believed by some even to this day. Neither baptism, nor anointing, nor papal titles, however, could change the deceitful, truculent, bloodthirsty nature of Clovis. He next turned against his wife’s Burgundian relatives, who were subjugated and compelled to pay tribute to him. 24 Clovis was now master of Gaul even to the southern part of it, which had belonged to the West Goths who a century earlier, under the leadership of Ataulf, had taken possession of the country north and south of the Pyrenees (southern Gaul and northern Spain). As there was no political pretext for making war upon the West Goths he found a religious one. The “All Christian” King Clovis assembled the bishops and secular leaders and thus addressed them: “Shall the West Goth heretics occupy that beautiful country and persecute our Catholic brethren? Arise in the name of our faith and conquer them!” Clovis had now openly declared his adherence to the Catholic faith, and there was fresh rejoicing in Rome when it was known that he had undertaken a crusade against the West Goths. He was victorious in a battle with Alaric the Second, whom he slew with his own hand, but was prevented by Theodoric the Great,[12] father-in-law of Alaric, from subjugating the entire West-Gothic kingdom. He had to be content with the sovereignty of the region between the Loire and the Garonne (Provence) as part of the Frankish Empire. 25 Clovis’s career was continually marked by injustice, cruelty, and bloodshed. One outrage rapidly followed another. He next sought to add the possessions of his Frankish relatives to his kingdom. Siegbert, with whom he had fought against the Alemanni, was a cripple because of a wound received in the battle of Toul. Clovis sent word to his son that his father had lived too long, and that if he were out of the way they might be friends. The dissolute son had his father murdered, and sent this message to Clovis: “My father is no longer living. Send messengers to me, and they shall take whatever you need from my treasures.” Clovis sent his messengers, but upon another errand. The young prince led them to the treasure chamber and they assassinated him there. 26 Clovis next assumed the role of avenger of Frankish chiefs killed by Siegbert. He summoned the heads of the Frankish families and brought such inducements to bear that they voluntarily acknowledged his authority and accepted his sovereignty. He secretly inspired an uprising against one relative, who had proved too obstinate; and when he was brought before him by his own people in chains, Clovis exclaimed: “What! are you not ashamed to appear before me in chains and to disgrace our princely race?” With these words he cut off his head with a battle-axe. He also killed his victim’s brother because he dared to protest. Sooner or later all his relatives who wavered in allegiance suffered from his wrath. Then he began to grow anxious lest some one of the family might have been spared. He hypocritically lamented that he had not a relative he could trust. He instituted a search, but all inquiries were useless. He was in undisputed possession of a kingdom which extended from the mouth of the Rhine to Switzerland on the south, to the Atlantic ocean on the west, and almost to the Pyrenees on the southwest. He thought himself secure against all enemies, but in his forty-fourth year death overtook him. Four sons inherited his kingdom, but there was no peace among them or any of their descendants during the next two centuries. Treachery, assassination, and poison were the agencies employed by the male members of the princely house to gain their end. Petty jealousy, envy, and revenge drove their wives to crimes of the worst description. Simplicity of customs disappeared from court life. Roman civilization accomplished its fatal work. The once princely Merovingian race was degenerated by physical and spiritual weakness. CHARLEMAGNE CHARLES MARTEL PEPIN THE SHORT CLOVIS 27 The result of all this was a change in governmental relations. Before the close of the sixth century the weak Merovingians relinquished the responsibilities of rule to the mayor of the palace.[13] Among those who filled the position, Pepin of Landen, the founder of the Pepin family afterwards known as Carolingians or Carlovingians, was conspicuous. That the Frankish kingdom, which included also Burgundy and Thuringia, escaped dissolution was entirely due to this powerful Pepin family. Subsequently Pepin of Heristal, a member of the same family, rose to the honor of leadership. After many distinguished achievements, his son Charles, who was called Charles Martel, or “the Hammer,” because of his victory over the Moors in 732, succeeded him. The Frankish kingdom, as well as the German Christian world, was saved by him from a great disaster at the hands of the Moors, who twenty-one years later (711) overthrew the power of the West Goths in Spain and established themselves there. 28 Another Pepin, called “the Short,” by reason of his low stature, succeeded Charles Martel. The enemies of the country—the Saxons particularly—felt the weight of his power. An enmity of long standing existed between the Saxons and the Franks, and they had often met in fierce encounters. It is hard to say which side was to blame, but it is certain that the Saxons, especially after the Franks had been Christianized, often invaded the country of the latter, and that the war which Pepin waged against them was to that extent a just one. He at last subdued them and forced them to pay tribute. It was in Pepin’s time also that the form of government was restored to the old royal system; and while he accomplished this he also insisted that the influence of the clergy should not be impaired. First of all he sought to secure the favor of the bishops of the country, and succeeded so well that two of them agreed to settle matters with the Pope. Everything seemed to favor his plans. The Pope was hard pressed by the brave Lombardian King Haistulf and in sore need of help. After consultation with the bishops Pepin compelled Haistulf to give up his possessions to the Pope, and the Pope recognized the Franks as defenders of the Church.[14] 29 Pepin the Short, like his predecessors, Charles Martel, Pepin of Heristal, and Pepin of Landen, achieved great results for the Frankish kingdom. For some years he carried on war with Aquitania and eventually added that country to his dominions. When the Saxons hesitated about paying the tribute which his father had exacted from them, he drew his sword and compelled them to keep their agreement. When he realized that his death was fast approaching, he divided his kingdom between his sons, Charles[15] and Carloman. Charles, the elder, inherited Aquitania, Austrasia,[16] Thuringia, Bavaria, Mainz, and Worms; Carloman inherited Burgundy, Alsace, Provence, and Alemannia. Neustria[17] was divided equally between them. Pepin died in 768.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3289/89930.html","bookId":488,"book":{"id":488,"title":"Charlemagne","description":"简介： It was at Ingelheim[1] on the Rhine that Charlemagne usually established his court during the middle period of his reign.
