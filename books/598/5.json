And he said, \"Richard, I do not give, but lend you my horse: be sure you be honest, and bring my horse back to me at your return this way to Oxford. And I do now give you ten groats, to bear your charges to Exeter: and here is ten groats more, which I charge you to deliver to your Mother and tell her I send her a Bishop\u0027s benediction with it, and beg the continuance of her prayers for me. And if you bring my horse back to me, I will give you ten groats more, to carry you on foot to the College, and so God bless you, good Richard.\" Izaak Walton.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3256/89225.html","bookId":598,"book":{"id":598,"title":"The Footpath Way","description":"简介： So long as man does not bother about what he is or whence he came or whither he is going, the whole thing seems as simple as the verb to be; and you may say that the moment he does begin thinking about what he is (which is more than thinking that he...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3256","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
