{"id":36462,"no":16,"title":"XVI HORIZONS OF AGONY","content":"A voice behind Bond said quietly, \"Dinner is served.\" Bond swung round. It was the bodyguard. Beside him was another man who might have been his twin. They stood there, two stocky barrels of muscle, their hands buried in the sleeves of their kimonos, and looked over Bond\u0027s head at Doctor No. \\n\\n \"Ah, nine o\u0027clock already.\" Doctor No rose slowly to his feet. \"Come alone. We can continue our conversation in more intimate surroundings. It is kind of you both to have listened to me with such exemplary patience. I hope the modesty of my cuisine and my cellar will not prove a further imposition.\" \\n\\n Double doors stood open in the wall behind the two white-jacketed men. Bond and the girl followed Doctor No through into a small octagonal mahogany panelled room lit by a central chandelier in silver with storm glasses round the candles. Beneath it was a round mahogany table laid for three. Silver and glass twinkled warmly. The plain dark blue carpet was luxuriously deep. Doctor No took the centre high-backed chair and bowed the girl into the chair on his right. They sat down and unfolded napkins of white silk. \\n\\n The hollow ceremony and the charming room maddened Bond. He longed to break it up with his own hands-to wind his silk napkin round Doctor No\u0027s throat and squeeze until the contact lenses popped out of the black, damnable eyes. \\n\\n The two guards wore white cotton gloves. They served the food with a suave efficiency that was prompted by an occasional word in Chinese from Doctor No. \\n\\n At first, Doctor No seemed preoccupied. He slowly ate through three bowls of different soup, feeding himself with a spoon with a short handle that fitted neatly between the pincers. Bond concentrated on hiding his fears from the girl. He sat relaxed and ate and drank with a forced good appetite. He talked cheerfully to the girl about Jamaica-about the birds and the animals and the flowers which were an easy topic for her. Occasionally his feet felt for hers under the table. She became almost gay. Bond thought they were putting on sab excellent imitation of an engaged couple being given dinner by a detested uncle. \\n\\n Bond had no idea if his thin bluff had worked. He didn\u0027t give much for their chances. Doctor No, and Doctor No\u0027s story, exuded impregnability. The incredible biography rang true. Not a word of it was impossible. Perhaps there were other people in\" the world with their private kingdoms-away from the beaten track, where there were no witnesses, where they could do what they liked. And what did Doctor No plan to do next, after he had squashed the flies that had come to annoy him? And if-when-he killed Bond and the girl, would London pick up the threads that Bond had picked up? Probably they would. There would be Pleydell-Smith. The evidence of the poisoned fruit. But where would Bond\u0027s replacement get with Doctor No? Not far. Doctor No would shrug his shoulders over the disappearance of Bond and Quarrel, Never heard of them. And there would be no link with the girl. In Morgan\u0027s Harbour they would think she had been drowned on one of her expeditions. It was hard to see what could interfere with Doctor No-with the second chapter of his life, whatever it was. \\n\\n Underneath his chatter with the girl, Bond prepared for the worst. There were plenty of weapons beside his plate. When the cutlets came, perfectly cooked, Bond fiddled indecisively with the knives and chose the bread knife to eat them with. While he ate and talked, he edged the big steel meat knife towards him. An expansive gesture of his right hand knocked over his glass of champagne and in the split second of the crash his left hand flicked the knife into the deep sleeve of his kimono. In the midst of Bond\u0027s apologies and the confusion as he and the bodyguard mopped up the spilled champagne, Bond raised his left arm and felt the knife slip back to below his armpit and then fall inside the kimono against his ribs. When he had finished his cutlets he tightened the silk belt round his waist, shifting the knife across his stomach. The knife nestled comfortingly against his skin and gradually the steel grew warm. \\n\\n Coffee came and the meal was ended. The two guards came and stood close behind Bond\u0027s chair and the girl\u0027s. They stood with their arms crossed on their chests, impassive, motionless, like executioners. \\n\\n Doctor No put his cup softly down on his saucer. He laid his two steel claws down on the table in front of him. He sat a fraction more upright. He turned his body an inch in Bond\u0027s direction. Now there was no preoccupation in his face. The eyes were hard and direct. The thin mouth creased and opened. \"You have enjoyed your dinner, Mister Bond?\" \\n\\n Bond took a cigarette from the silver box in front of him and lit it. He played with the silver table-lighter. He smelled bad news coming. He must somehow pocket the lighter. Fire might perhaps be another weapon. He said easily, \"Yes. It was excellent.\" He looked across at the girl. He leant forward in his chair and rested his forearms on the table. He crossed them, enveloping the lighter. He smiled at her. \"I hope I ordered what you like.\" \\n\\n \"Oh yes, it was lovely.\" For her the party was still going on. \\n\\n Bond smoked busily, agitating his hands and forearms to create an atmosphere of movement. He turned to Doctor No. He stubbed out his cigarette and sat back in his chair. He\" folded his arms across his chest. The lighter was in his left armpit. He smiled cheerfully. \"And what happens now, Doctor No?\" \\n\\n \"We can proceed to our after-dinner entertainment, Mister Bond.\" The thin smile creased and vanished. \"I have examined your proposition from every angle. I do not accept it.\" \\n\\n Bond shrugged his shoulders. \"You are unwise.\" \\n\\n \"No, Mister Bond. I suspect that your proposition is a gold brick. People in your trade do not behave as you suggest. They make routine reports to their headquarters. They keep their chief aware of the progress of their investigations. I know these things. Secret agents do not behave as you suggest you have done. You have been reading too many novels of suspense. Your little speech reeked of grease-paint and cardboard. No, Mister Bond, I do not accept your story. If it is true, I am prepared to face the consequences. I have too much at stake to be turned from my path. So the police come, the soldiers come. Where are a man and a girl? What man and what girl? I know nothing. Please go away. You are disturbing my guanera. Where is your evidence? Your search warrant? The English law is strict, gentlemen. Go home and leave me in peace with my. beloved cormorants. You see, Mister Bond? And let us even say that the worst comes to the worst. That one of my agents talks, which is highly improbable (Bond remembered the fortitude of Miss Chung). What have I to lose? Two more deaths on the charge sheet. But, Mister Bond, a man can only be hanged once.\" The tall pear-shaped head shook gently from side to side. \"Have you anything else to say? Any questions to ask? You both have a busy night ahead of you. Your time is getting short. And I must get my sleep. The monthly ship is putting in tomorrow and I have the loading to supervise. I shall have to spend the whole day down on the quay. Well, Mister Bond?\" \\n\\n Bond looked across at the girl. She had gone deathly pale. She was gazing at him, waiting for the miracle he would work. He looked down at his hands. He examined his nails carefully. He said, playing for time, \"And then what? After your busy day with the bird dung, what comes next on your programme? What is the next chapter you think you\u0027re going to write?\" \\n\\n Bond didn\u0027t look up. The deep quiet authoritative voice came to him as if it was coming down from the night sky. \\n\\n \"Ah, yes. You must have been wondering, Mister Bond. You have the habit of inquiry. It persists even to the last, even into the shadows. I admire such qualities in a man with only a few hours to live. So I will tell you. I will turn over the next page. It will console you. There is more to this place than bird dung. Your instincts did not betray you.\" Doctor No paused for emphasis. \"This island, Mister Bond, is about to be developed into the most valuable technical intelligence centre in the world.\" \\n\\n \"Really?\" Bond kept his eyes bent on his hands. \\n\\n \"Doubtless you know that Turks Island, about three hundred miles from here through the Windward Passage, is the most important centre for testing the guided missiles of the United States?\" \\n\\n \"It is an important centre, yes.\" \\n\\n \"Perhaps you have read of the rockets that have been going astray recently? The multi-stage SNARK, for instance, that ended its flight in the forests of Brazil instead of the depths of the South Atlantic?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"You recall that it refused to obey the telemetred instructions to change its- course, even to destroy itself. It developed a will of its own?\" \\n\\n \"I remember.\" \\n\\n \"There have been other failures, decisive failures, from the long list of prototypes-the ZUNI, MATADOR, PETREL, REGULUS, BOMARC-so many names, so many changes, I can\u0027t even remember them all. Well, Mister Bond,\" Doctor No could not keep a note of pride out of his voice, \"it may interest you to know that the vast majority of those failures have been caused from Crab Key.\" \\n\\n \"Is that so?\" \\n\\n \"You do not believe me? No matter. Others do. Others who have seen the complete abandonment of one series, the MASTODON, because of its recurring navigational errors, its failure to obey the radio directions from Turks Island. Those others are the Russians. The Russians are my partners in this venture. They trained six of my men, Mister Bond. Two of those men are on watch at this moment, watching the radio frequencies, the beams on which these weapons travel. There is a million dollars\u0027 worth of equipment up above us in the rock galleries, Mister Bond, sending fingers up into the Heavyside Layer, waiting for the signals, jamming them, countering beams with other beams. And from time to time a rocket soars up on its way a hundred, five hundred miles into the Atlantic. And we track it, as accurately as they are tracking it in the Operations Room on Turks Island. Then, suddenly, our pulses go out to the rocket, its brain is confused, it goes mad, it plunges into the sea, it destroys itself, it roars off at a tangent. Another test has failed. The operators are blamed, the designers, the manufacturers. There is panic in the Pentagon. Something else must be tried, different frequencies, different metals, a different radio brain. Of course,\" Doctor No was fair, \"we too have our difficulties. We track many practice shoots without being able to get through to the brain of the new rocket. But then we communicate urgently with Moscow. Yes, they have even given us a cipher machine with our own frequencies and routines. And the Russians get thinking. They make suggestions. We try them out. And then, one day, Mister Bond, it is like catching the attention of a man in a crowd. Up in the stratosphere the rocket acknowledges our signal. We are recognized and we can speak to it and change its mind,\" Doctor No paused. \"Do you not find that interesting, Mister Bond, this little sideline to my business in guano? It is, I assure you, most profitable. It might be still more so. Perhaps Communist China will pay more. Who knows? I already have my feelers out.\" \\n\\n Bond lifted his eyes. He looked thoughtfully at Doctor No. So he had been right. There \u0027had been more, much more, in all this than met the eye. This was a big game, a game that explained everything, a game that was certainly, in the international espionage market, well worth the candle. Well, well! Now the pieces in the puzzle fell firmly into place. For this it was certainly worth scaring away a few birds and wiping out a few people. Privacy? Of course Doctor No would have to kill him and the girl. Power? This was it. Doctor No had really got himself into business. \\n\\n Bond looked into the two black holes with a new respect. He said, \"You\u0027ll have to kill a lot more people to keep this thing in your hands, Doctor No. It\u0027s worth a lot of money. You\u0027ve got a good property here-a better one than I thought. People are going to want to cut themselves a piece of this cake. I wonder who will get to you first and kill you. Those men up there,\" he gestured towards the ceiling, \"who were trained in Moscow? They\u0027re the technicians. I wonder what Moscow is .telling them to do? You wouldn\u0027t know that, would you?\" \\n\\n Doctor No said, \"You persist in underestimating me, Mister Bond. You are an obstinate man, and stupider than I had expected. I am aware of these possibilities. I have taken one of these men and made him into a private monitor. He has duplicates of the ciphers and of the cipher machine. He lives in another part of the mountain. The others think that he died. He watches on all the routine times. He gives me a second copy of all the traffic that passes. So far, the signals from Moscow have been innocent of any sign of conspiracy. I am thinking of these things constantly, Mister Bond. I take precautions and I shall take further precautions. As I said, you underestimate me.\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t underestimate you, Doctor No. You\u0027re a very careful man, but you\u0027ve got too many files open on you. In my line of business, the same thing applies to me. I know the feeling. But you\u0027ve got some really bad ones. The Chinese one, for instance. I wouldn\u0027t like to have that one. The FBI should be the least painful-robbery and false identity. But do you know the Russians as well as I do? You\u0027re a \u0027best friend\u0027 at the moment. But the\u0027 Russians don\u0027t have partners. They\u0027ll want to take you over-buy you out with a bullet. Then there\u0027s the file you\u0027ve started with my Service. You really want me to make that one fatter? I shouldn\u0027t do it if I were you, Doctor No. They\u0027re a tenacious lot of people in my Service. If anything happens to me and the girl, you\u0027ll find Crab Key\u0027s a very small and naked little island.\" \\n\\n \"You cannot play for high stakes without taking risks, Mister Bond. I accept the dangers and, so far as I can, I have equipped myself against them. You see, Mister Bond,\" the deep voice held a hint of greed, \"I am on the edge of still greater things. The Chapter Two to which I referred holds the promise of prizes which no one but a fool would throw away because he was afraid. I have told you that I can bend the beams on which these rockets fly, Mister Bond. I can make them change course and ignore their radio control. What would you say, Mister Bond, if I could go further? If I could bring them down into the sea near this island and salvage the secrets of their construction. At present American destroyers, far out in the South Atlantic, salvage these missiles when they come to the end of their fuel and parachute down into the sea. Sometimes the parachutes fail to open. Sometimes the self-destruction devices fail to operate. No one on Turks Island would be surprised if every now and then the prototype of a new series broke off its flight and came down near Crab Key. To begin with, at least, it would be put down to mechanical failure. Later, perhaps, they would discover that other radio signals besides theirs were guiding their rockets. A jamming war would start. They would try and locate the origin of the false signals. Directly I found they were looking for me, I would have one last fling. Their rockets would go mad. They would land on Havana, on Kingston. They would turn round and home on Miami. Even without warheads, Mister Bond, five tons of metal arriving at a thousand miles an hour can cause plenty of damage in a crowded town. And then what? There would be panic, a public outcry. The experiments would have to cease. The Turks Island base would have to close down. And how much would Russia pay for that to happen, Mister Bond? And how much for each of the prototypes I captured for them? Shall we say ten million dollars for the whole operation? \\n\\n Twenty million? It would be a priceless victory in the armaments race. I could name my figure. Don\u0027t you agree, Mister Bond? And don\u0027t you agree that these considerations make your arguments and threats seem rather puny?\" \\n\\n Bond said nothing. There was nothing to say. Suddenly he was back in the quiet room high up above Regent\u0027s Park. He could hear the rain slashing softly against the window and M\u0027s voice, impatient, sarcastic, saying, \"Oh, some damned business about birds… holiday in the sun\u0027ll do you good… routine inquiry.\" And he, Bond, had taken a canoe and a fisherman and a picnic lunch and had gone off-how many days, how many weeks ago?-\u0027to have a look\u0027. Well, he had had his look into Pandora\u0027s Box. He had found out the answers, been told the secrets-and now? Now he was going to be politely shown the way to his grave, taking the secrets with him and the waif he had picked up and dragged along with him on his lunatic adventure. The bitterness inside Bond came up into his mouth so that for a moment he thought he was going to retch. He reached for his champagne and emptied the glass. He said harshly, \"All right, Doctor No. Now let\u0027s get on with the cabaret. What\u0027s the programme-knife, bullet, poison, rope? But make it quick, I\u0027ve seen enough of you.\" \\n\\n Doctor No\u0027s lips compressed into a thin purple line. The eyes were hard as onyx under the billiard-ball forehead and skull. The polite mask had gone. The Grand Inquisitor sat in the high-backed chair. The hour had struck for the peine forte et dure. \\n\\n Doctor No spoke a word and the two guards took a step forward and held the two victims above the elbows, forcing their arms back against the sides of their chairs. There was no resistance. Bond concentrated on holding the lighter in his armpit. The white-gloved hands on his biceps felt like steel bands. He smiled across at the girl. \"I\u0027m sorry about this, Honey. I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re not going to be able to play together after all.\" \\n\\n The girl\u0027s eyes in the pale face were blue-black with fear. Her lips trembled. She said, \"Will it hurt?\" \\n\\n \"Silence!\" Doctor No\u0027s voice was the crack of a whip. \"Enough of this foolery. Of course it will hurt. I am interested in pain. I am also interested in rinding out how much the human body can endure. From time to time I make experiments on those of my people who have to be punished. And on trespassers like yourselves. You have both put me to a great deal of trouble, In exchange I intend to put you to a great deal of pain. I shall record the length of your endurance. The facts will be noted. One day my findings will be given to the world. Your deaths will have served the purposes of science. I never waste human material. The German experiments on live humans during the war were of great benefit to science. It is a year since I put a girl to death in the fashion I have chosen for you, woman. She was a Negress. She lasted three hours. She died of terror. I have wanted a white girl for comparison. -I was not surprised when your arrival was reported. I get what I want.\" Doctor No sat back in his chair. His eyes were now fixed on the girl, watching her reactions. She stared back at him, half hypnotized, like a bush mouse in front of a rattlesnake. \\n\\n Bond set his teeth. \\n\\n \"You are a Jamaican, so you will know what I am talking about. This island is called Crab Key. It is called by that name because it is infested with crabs, land crabs-what they call ia Jamaica \u0027black crabs\u0027. You know them. They weigh about a pound each and they are as big as saucers. At this time of year they come up in thousands from their holes near the shore and climb up towards the mountain. There, in the coral uplands, they go to ground again in holes in the rock and spawn their broods. They march up in armies of hundreds at a time. They march through everything and over everything. In Jamaica they go through houses that are in their path. They are like the lemmings of Norway. It is a compulsive migra-. tion.\" Doctor No paused. He said softly, \"But there is a difference. The crabs devour what they find in their path. And at present, woman, they are \u0027running\u0027. They are coming up the mountainside in their tens of thousands, great red and orange and black waves of them, scuttling and hurrying and scraping against the rock above us at this moment. And tonight, in the middle of their path, they are going to find the naked body of a woman pegged out-a banquet spread for, them-and they will feel the warm body with their feeding pincers, and one will make the first incision with his fighting claws and then… and then…\" \\n\\n There was a moan from the girl. Her head fell forward slackly on to her chest. She had fainted. Bond\u0027s body heaved in his chair. A string of obscenities hissed out between his clenched teeth. The huge hands of the guard were like fire round his arms. He couldn\u0027t even move the chair-legs on the floor. After a moment he desisted. He waited for his voice to steady, then he said, with all the venom he could put into the words, \"You bastard. You\u0027ll fry in hell for this.\" \\n\\n Doctor No smiled thinly. \"Mister Bond, I do not admit the existence of hell. Console yourself. Perhaps they will start at the throat or the heart. The movement of the pulse will attract them. Then it will not be long.\" He spoke a sentence in Chinese. The guard behind the girl\u0027s chair leant forward and plucked her bodily out of the chair as if she had been a child and slung the inert body over his shoulder. Between the dangling arms the hair fell down in a golden shower. The guard went to the door and opened it and went out, closing it noiselessly behind him. \\n\\n For a moment there was silence in the room. Bond thought only of the knife against his skin and of the lighter under his armpit. How much damage could he do with the two pieces of metal? Could he somehow get within range of Doctor No? \\n\\n Doctor No said quietly, \"You said that power was an illusion, Mister Bond. Do you change your mind? My power to select this particular death for the girl is surely not an illusion. However, let us proceed to the method of your departure. That also has its novel aspects. You see, Mister Bond, I am interested in the anatomy of courage-in the power of the human body to endure. But how to measure human endurance? How to plot a graph of the will to survive, the tolerance of pain, the conquest of fear? I have given much thought to the problem, and I believe I have solved it. It is, of course, only a rough and ready method, and I shall learn by experience as more and more subjects are put to the test. I have prepared you for the experiment as best I could. I gave you a sedative so that your body should be rested and I have fed you well so that you may be at full strength. Future-what shall I call them-patients, will have the same advantages. All will start equal in that respect. After that it will be a question of the individual\u0027s courage and powers of endurance.\" Doctor No paused, watching Bond\u0027s face. \"You see, Mister Bond, I have just finished constructing an obstacle race, an assault course against death. I will say no more about it because the element of surprise is one of the constituents of fear. It is the unknown dangers that are the worst, that bear most heavily on the reserves of courage. And I flatter myself that the gauntlet you will run contains a rich assortment of the unexpected. It will be particularly interesting, Mister Bond, that a man of your physical qualities is to be my first competitor. It will be most interesting to observe how far you get down the course I have devised. You should put up a worthy target figure for future runners. I have high expectations of you. You should go far, but when, as is inevitable, you have finally failed at an obstacle, your body will be recovered and I shall most meticulously examine the physical state of your remains. The data will be recorded. You will be the first dot on a graph. Something of an honour, is it not, Mister Bond?\" \\n\\n Bond said nothing. What the hell did all this mean? What could this test consist of? Would it be possible to survive it? Could he conceivably escape from it and get to the girl before it was too late, even if it was only to kill her and save her from her torture? Silently Bond gathered his reserves of courage, steeling his mind against the fear of the unknown that already had him by the throat, focusing his whole will on survival. Somehow, above all else, he must cling to his weapons. \\n\\n Doctor No rose and stepped away from his chair. He walked slowly to the door and turned. The menacing black holes looked back at Bond from just below the lintel of the door. The head was inclined a fraction. The purple lips creased back. \"Run a good race for me, Mister Bond. My thoughts, as they say, will be with you.\" \\n\\n Doctor No turned away and the door closed softly behind the long thin gunmetal back. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555/46122.html","bookId":1282,"book":{"id":1282,"title":"007之诺博士 Dr. No","description":"简介： 《007之诺博士》是由特伦斯杨执导，肖恩康纳利、乌苏拉安德丝主演的动作片。该片是007系列的开山之作，故事讲述詹姆斯邦德奉命前往加勒比海调查情报员的死因，并在当地渔民库洛及CIA情报员莱特的协助下破坏神秘岛实验室的故事。影片于1962年10月5日上映。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/11/10-37-34-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
