{"id":36448,"no":2,"title":"II CHOICE OF WEAPONS","content":"Three weeks later, in London, March came in like a rattlesnake. \n From first light on March ist, hail and icy sleet, with a Force 8 gale behind them, lashed at the city and went on lashing as the people streamed miserably to work, their legs whipped by the wet hems of their macintoshes and their faces blotching with the cold. \n It was a filthy day and everybody said so-even M, who rarely admitted the existence of weather even in its extreme forms. When the old black Silver Wraith Rolls with the nondescript number-plate stopped outside the tall building in Regent\u0027s Park and he climbed stiffly out on to the pavement, hail hit him in the face like a whiff of small-shot. Instead of hurrying inside the building, he walked deliberately round the car to the window beside the chauffeur. \n \"Won\u0027t be needing the car again today, Smith. Take it away and go home. I\u0027ll use the tube this evening. No weather for driving a car. Worse than one of those PQ convoys.\" \n Ex-Leading Stoker Smith grinned gratefully. \"Aye-aye, sir. And thanks.\" He watched the elderly erect figure walk round the bonnet of the Rolls and across the pavement and into the building. Just like the old boy. He\u0027d always see the men right first. Smith clicked the gear lever into first and moved off, peering forward through the streaming windscreen. They didn\u0027t come like that any more. \n M went up in the lift to the eighth floor and along the thick-carpeted corridor to his office. He shut the door behind him, took off his overcoat and scarf and hung them behind the door. He took out a large blue silk bandanna handkerchief and brusquely wiped it over his face. It was odd, but he wouldn\u0027t have done this in front of the porters or the liftman. He went over to his desk and sat down and bent towards the intercom. He pressed a switch. \"I\u0027m in, Miss Moneypenny. The signals, please, and anything else you\u0027ve got. Then get me Sir James Molony. He\u0027ll be doing his rounds at St Mary\u0027s about now. Tell the Chief of Staff I\u0027ll see 007 in half an hour. And let me have the Strangways file.\" M waited for the metallic \"Yes, sir\" and released the switch. \n He sat back and reached for his pipe and began filling it thoughtfully. He didn\u0027t look up when his secretary came in with the stack of papers and he even ignored the half dozen pink Most Immediates on top of the signal file. If they had been vital he would have been called during the night. \n A yellow light winked on the intercom. M picked up the black telephone from the row of four. \"That you, Sir James? Have you got five minutes?\" \n \"Six, for you.\" At the other end of the line the famous neurologist chuckled. \"Want me to certify one of Her Majesty\u0027s Ministers?\" \n \"Not today.\" M frowned irritably. The old Navy had respected governments. \"It\u0027s about that man of mine you\u0027ve been handling. We won\u0027t bother about the name. This is an open line. I gather you let him out yesterday. Is he fit for duty?\" \n There was a pause on the other end. Now the voice was professional, judicious. \"Physically he\u0027s as fit as a fiddle. Leg\u0027s healed up. Shouldn\u0027t be any after-effects. Yes, he\u0027s all right.\" There was another pause. \"Just one thing, M. There\u0027s a lot of tension there, you know. You work these men of yours pretty hard. Can you give him something easy to start with? From what you\u0027ve told me he\u0027s been having a tough time for some years now.\" \n M said gruffly, \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s paid for. It\u0027ll soon show if he\u0027s not up to the work. Won\u0027t be the first one that\u0027s cracked. From what you say, he sounds in perfectly good shape. It isn\u0027t as if he\u0027d really been damaged like some of the patients I\u0027ve sent you-men who\u0027ve been properly put through the mangle.\" \n \"Of course, if you put it like that. But pain\u0027s an odd thing. We know very little about it. You can\u0027t measure it-the difference in suffering between a woman having a baby and a man having a renal colic. And, thank God, the body seems to forget fairly quickly. But this man of yours has been in real pain, M. Don\u0027t think that just because nothing\u0027s been broken…\" \n \"Quite, quite.\" Bond had made a mistake and he had suffered for it. In any case M didn\u0027t like being lectured, even by one of the most famous doctors in the world, on how he should handle his agents. There had been a note of criticism in Sir James Molony\u0027s voice. M said abruptly, \"Ever hear of a man called Steincrohn-Dr Peter Steincrohn?\" \n \"No, who\u0027s he?\" \n \"American doctor. Written a book my Washington people sent over for our library. This man talks about how much punishment the human body can put up with. Gives a list of the bits of the body an average man can do without. Matter of fact, J copied it out for future reference. Care to hear the list?\" M dug into his coat pocket and put some letters and scraps of paper on the desk in front of him. With his left hand he selected a piece of paper and unfolded it. He wasn\u0027t put out by the silence on the other end of the line, \"Hullo, Sir James! Well, here they are: \u0027Gall bladder, spleen, tonsils, appendix, one of his two kidneys, one of his two lungs, two of his four or five quarts of blood, two-fifths of his liver, most of his stomach, four of his twenty-three feet of intestines and half,of his brain.\u0027 \" M paused. When the silence continued at the other end, he said, \"Any comments, Sir James?\" \n There was a reluctant grunt at the other end of the telephone. \"I wonder he didn\u0027t add an arm and a leg, or all of them. I don\u0027t see quite what you\u0027re trying to prove.\" \n M gave a curt laugh. \"I\u0027m not trying to prove anything, Sir James. It just struck me as an interesting list. All I\u0027m trying to say is that my man seems to have got off pretty lightly compared with that sort of punishment. But,\" M relented, \"don\u0027t let\u0027s argue about it.\" He said in a milder voice, \"As a matter of fact I did have it in mind to let him have a bit of a breather. Something\u0027s come up in Jamaica.\" M glanced at the streaming windows. \"It\u0027ll be more of a rest cure than anything. Two of my people, a man and a girl, have gone off together. Or that\u0027s what it looks like. Our friend can have a spell at being an inquiry agent-in the sunshine too. How\u0027s that?\" \n \"Just the ticket. I wouldn\u0027t mind the job myself on a day like this.\" But Sir James Molony was determined to get his message through. He persisted mildly. \"Don\u0027t think I wanted to interfere, M, but there are limits to a man\u0027s courage. I know you have to treat these men as if they were expendable, but presumably you don\u0027t want them to crack at the wrong moment. This one I\u0027ve had here is tough. I\u0027d say you\u0027ll get plenty more work out of him. But you know what Moran has to say about courage in that book of his.\" \n \"Don\u0027t recall.\" \n \"He says that courage is a capital sum reduced by expenditure. I agree with him. All I\u0027m trying to say is that this particular man seems to have been spending pretty hard since before the war. I wouldn\u0027t say he\u0027s overdrawn-not yet, but there are limits.\" \n \"Just so.\" M decided that was quite enough of that. Nowadays, softness was everywhere. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m sending him abroad. Holiday in Jamaica. Don\u0027t worry, Sir James. I\u0027ll take care of him. By the way, did you ever discover what the stuff was that Russian woman put into him?\" \n \"Got the answer yesterday.\" Sir James Molony also was glad the subject had been changed. The old man was as raw as the weather. Was there any chance that he had got his message across into what he described to himself as M\u0027s thick skull? \"Taken us three months. It was a bright chap at the School of Tropical Medicine who came up with it. The drug was fugu poison. The Japanese use it for committing suicide. It comes from the sex organs of the Japanese globe-fish. Trust the Russians to use something no one\u0027s ever heard of. They might just as well have used curare. It has much the same effect-paralysis of the central nervous system. Fugu\u0027s scientific name is Tetrodotoxin. It\u0027s terrible stuff and very quick. One shot of it like your man got and in a matter of seconds the motor and respiratory muscles are paralysed. At first the chap sees double and then he can\u0027t keep his eyes open. Next he can\u0027t swallow. His head falls and he can\u0027t raise it. Dies of respiratory paralysis.\" \n \"Lucky he got away with it.\" \n \"Miracle. Thanks entirely to that Frenchman who was with him. Got your man on the floor and gave him artificial respiration as if he was drowning. Somehow kept his lungs going until the doctor came. Luckily the doctor had worked in South America. Diagnosed curare and treated him accordingly. But it was a chance in a million. By the same token, what happened to the Russian woman?\" \n M said shortly, \"Oh, she died. Well, many thanks, Sir James. And don\u0027t worry about your patient. I\u0027ll see he has an easy time of it. Goodbye.\" \n M hung up. His face was cold and blank. He pulled over the signal file and went quickly through it. On some of the signals he scribbled a comment. Occasionally he made a brief telephone call to one of the Sections. When he had finished he tossed the pile into his Out basket and reached for his pipe and the tobacco jar made out of the base of a fourteen-pounder shell. Nothing remained in front of him except a buff folder marked with the Top Secret red star. Across the centre of the folder was written in block capitals: CARIBBEAN STATION, and underneath, in italics, Strangways and Trueblood. \n A light winked on the intercom. M pressed down the switch. \"Yes?\" \n \"007\u0027s here, sir.\" \n \"Send him in. And tell the Armourer to come up in five minutes.\" \n M sat back. He put his pipe in his mouth and set a match to it. Through the smoke he watched the door to his secretary\u0027s office. His eyes were very bright and watchful. \n James Bond came through the door and shut it behind him. \n He walked over to the chair across the desk from M and sat down. \n \"\u0027Morning, 007.\" \n \"Good morning, sir.\" \n There was silence in the room except for the rasping of M\u0027s pipe. It seemed to be taking a lot of matches to get it going. In the background the fingernails of the sleet slashed against the two broad windows. \n It was all just as Bond had remembered it through the months of being shunted from hospital to hospital, the weeks of dreary convalescence, the hard work of getting his body back into shape. To him this represented stepping back into life. Sitting here in this room opposite M was the symbol of normality he had longed for. He looked across through the smoke clouds into the shrewd grey eyes. They were watching him. What was coming? A post-mortem on the shambles which had been his last case? A curt relegation to one of the home sections for a spell of desk work? Or some splendid new assignment M had been keeping on ice while waiting for Bond to get back to duty? \n M threw the box of matches down on the red leather desk. He leant back and clasped his hands behind his head. \n \"How do you feel? Glad to be back?\" \n \"Very glad, sir. And I feel fine.\" \n \"Any final thoughts about your last case? Haven\u0027t bothered you with it till you got well. You heard I ordered an inquiry. I believe the Chief of Staff took some evidence from you. Anything to add?\" \n M\u0027s voice was businesslike, cold. Bond didn\u0027t like it. Something unpleasant was coming. He said, \"No, sir. It was a mess. I blame myself for letting that woman get me. Shouldn\u0027t have happened.\" \n M took his hands from behind his neck and slowly leant forward and placed them flat on the desk in front of him. His eyes were hard. \"Just so.\" The voice was velvet, dangerous. \"Your gun got stuck, if I recall. This Beretta of yours with the silencer. Something wrong there, 007. Can\u0027t afford that sort of mistake if you\u0027re to carry an oo number. Would you prefer to drop it and go back to normal duties?\" \n Bond stiffened. His eyes looked resentfully into M\u0027s. The licence to kill for the Secret Service, the double-o prefix, was a great honour. It had been earned hardly. It brought Bond the only assignments he enjoyed, the dangerous ones. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t, sir.\" \n \"Then we\u0027ll have to change your equipment. That was one of the findings of the Court of Inquiry. I agree with it. D\u0027you understand?\" \n Bond said obstinately, \"I\u0027m used to that gun, sir. I like working with it. What happened could have happened to anyone. With any kind of gun.\" \n \"I don\u0027t agree. Nor did the Court of Inquiry. So that\u0027s final. The only question is what you\u0027re to use instead.\" M bent forward to the intercom. \"Is the Armourer there? Send him in.\" \n M sat back. \"You may not know it, 007, but Major Booth-royd\u0027s the greatest small-arms expert in the world. He wouldn\u0027t be here if he wasn\u0027t. We\u0027ll hear what he has to say.\" \n The door opened. A short slim man with sandy hair came in and walked over to the desk and stood beside Bond\u0027s chair. Bond looked up into his face. He hadn\u0027t often seen the man before, but he remembered the very wide apart clear grey eyes that never seemed to flicker. With a non-committal glance down at Bond, the man stood relaxed, looking across at M. He said \"Good morning, sir,\" in a flat, unemotional voice. \n \"Morning, Armourer. Now I want to ask you some questions.\" M\u0027s voice was casual. \"First of all, what do you think of the Beretta, the -25?\" \n \"Ladies\u0027 gun, sir.\" \n M raised ironic eyebrows at Bond. Bond smiled thinly. \n \"Really! And why do you say that?\" \n \"No stopping power, sir. But it\u0027s easy to operate. A bit fancy looking too, if you know what I mean, sir. Appeals to the ladies.\" \n \"How would it be with a silencer?\" \n \"Still less stopping power, sir. And I don\u0027t like silencers. They\u0027re heavy and get stuck in your clothing when you\u0027re in a hurry. I wouldn\u0027t recommend anyone to try a combination like that, sir. Not if they were meaning business.\" \n M said pleasantly to Bond, \"Any comment, 007?\" \n Bond shrugged his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t agree. I\u0027ve used the .25 Beretta for fifteen years. Never had a stoppage and I haven\u0027t missed with it yet. Not a bad record for a gun. It just happens that I\u0027m used to it and I can point it straight. I\u0027ve used bigger guns when I\u0027ve had to-the .45 Colt with the long barrel, for instance. But for close-up work and concealment I like the Beretta.\" Bond paused. He felt he should give way somewhere. \"I\u0027d\u0027 agree about the silencer, sir. They\u0027re a nuisance. But sometimes you have to use them.\" \n \"We\u0027ve seen what happens when you do,\" said M drily. \"And as for changing your gun, it\u0027s only a question of practice. You\u0027ll soon get the feel of a new one.\" M allowed a trace of sympathy to enter his voice. \"Sorry, 007. But I\u0027ve decided. Just stand up a moment. I want the Armourer to get a look at your build.\" \n Bond stood up and faced the other man. There was no warmth in the two pairs of eyes. Bond\u0027s showed irritation. Major Boothroyd\u0027s were indifferent, clinical. He walked round Bond. He said \"Excuse me\" and felt Bond\u0027s biceps and forearms. He came back in front of him and said, \"Might I see your gun?\" \n Bond\u0027s hand went slowly into his coat. He handed over the taped Beretta with the sawn barrel. Boothroyd examined the gun and weighed it in his hand. He put it down on the desk. \"And your holster?\" \n Bond took off his coat and slipped off the chamois leather holster and harness. He put his coat on again. \n With a glance at the lips of the holster, perhaps to see if they showed traces of snagging. Boothroyd tossed the holster down beside the gun with a motion that sneered. He looked across at M. \"I think we can do better than this, sir.\" It was the sort of voice Bond\u0027s first expensive tailor had used. \n Bond sat down. He just stopped himself gazing rudely at the ceiling. Instead he looked impassively across at M. \n \"Well, Armourer, what do you recommend?\" \n Major Boothroyd put on the expert\u0027s voice. \"As a matter of fact, sir,\" he said modestly, \"I\u0027ve just been testing most of the small automatics. Five thousand rounds each at twenty-five yards. Of all of them, I\u0027d choose the Walther PPK 7.65 mm. It only came fourth after the Japanese M-14, the Russian Tokarev and the Sauer M-38. But I like its light trigger pull and the extension spur of the magazine gives a grip that should suit 007. It\u0027s a real stopping gun. Of course it\u0027s about a .32 calibre as compared with the Beretta\u0027s .25, but I wouldn\u0027t recommend anything lighter. And you can get ammunition for the Walther anywhere in the world. That gives it an edge on the Japanese and the Russian guns.\" M turned to Bond. \"Any comments?\" \n \"It\u0027s a good gun, sir,\" Bond admitted. \"Bit more bulky than the Beretta. How does the Armourer suggest I carry it?\" \n \"Berns Martin Triple-draw holster,\" said Major Boothroyd succinctly. \"Best worn inside the trouser band to the left. But it\u0027s all right below the shoulder. Stiff saddle leather. Holds the gun in with a spring. Should make for a quicker draw than that,\" he gestured towards the desk. \"Three-fifths of a second to hit a man at twenty feet would be about right.\" \n \"That\u0027s settled then.\" M\u0027s voice was final. \"And what about something bigger?\" \n \"There\u0027s only one gun for that, sir,\" said Major Boothroyd stolidly. \"Smith \u0026 Wesson Centennial Airweight. Revolver. ?38 calibre. Hammerless, so it won\u0027t catch in clothing. Overall length of six and a half inches and it only weighs thirteen ounces. To keep down the weight, the cylinder holds only five cartridges. But by the time they\u0027re gone,\" Major Boothroyd allowed himself a wintry smile, \"somebody\u0027s been killed. Fires the -38 S \u0026 W Special. Very accurate cartridge indeed. With standard loading it has a .muzzle velocity of eight hundred and sixty feet per second and muzzle energy of two hundred and sixty foot-pounds. There are various barrel lengths, three and a half inch, five inch…\" \n \"All right, all right.\" M\u0027s voice was testy. \"Take it as read. If you say it\u0027s the best I\u0027ll believe you. So it\u0027s the Walther and the Smith \u0026 -Wesson. Send up one of each to 007. With the harness. And arrange for him to fire them in. Starting today. He\u0027s got to be expert in a week. All right? Then thank you very much, Armourer. I won\u0027t detain you.\" \n \"Thank you, sir,\" said Major Boothroyd. He turned and marched stiffly out of the room. \n There was a moment\u0027s silence. The sleet tore at the windows. M swivelled his chair and watched the streaming panes. Bond took the opportunity to glance at his watch. Ten o\u0027clock. His eyes slid to the gun and holster on the desk. He thought of his fifteen years\u0027 marriage to the ugly bit of metal. He remembered the times its single word had saved his life-and the times when its threat alone had been enough. He thought of the days when he had literally dressed to kill-when he had dismantled the gun and oiled it and packed the bullets carefully into the springloaded magazine and tried the action once or twice, pumping the cartridges out on to the bedspread in some hotel bedroom somewhere round the world. Then the last wipe of a dry rag and the gun into the little holster and a pause in front of the mirror to see that nothing showed. And then out of the door and on his way to the rendezvous that was to end with either darkness or light. How many times had it saved his life? How many death sentences had it signed? Bond felt unreasonably sad. How could one have such ties with an inanimate object, an ugly one at that, and, he had to admit it, with a weapon that was not in the same class as the ones chosen by the Armourer? But he had the ties and M was going to cut them. \n M swivelled back to face him. \"Sorry, James,\" he said, and there was no sympathy in his voice. \"I know how you like that bit of iron. But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s got to go. Never give a weapon a second chance-any more than a man. I can\u0027t afford to gamble with the double-o section. They\u0027ve got to be properly equipped. You understand that? A gun\u0027s more important than a hand or a foot in your job.\" \n Bond smiled thinly. \"I know, sir. I shan\u0027t argue. I\u0027m just sorry to see it go.\" \n \"All right then. We\u0027ll say no more about it. Now I\u0027ve got some more news for you. There\u0027s a job come up. In Jamaica. Personnel problem. Or that\u0027s what it looks like. Routine investigation and report. The sunshine\u0027ll do you good and you can practise your new guns on the turtles or whatever they have down there. You can do with a bit of holiday. Like to take it on?\" \n Bond thought: He\u0027s got it in for me over the last job. Feels I let him down. Won\u0027t trust me with anything tough. Wants to see. Oh well! He said: \"Sounds rather like the soft life, sir. I\u0027ve had almost too much of that lately. But if it\u0027s got to be done… If you say so, sir…\" \n \"Yes,\" said M. \"I say so.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555/46108.html","bookId":1282,"book":{"id":1282,"title":"007之诺博士 Dr. No","description":"简介： 《007之诺博士》是由特伦斯杨执导，肖恩康纳利、乌苏拉安德丝主演的动作片。该片是007系列的开山之作，故事讲述詹姆斯邦德奉命前往加勒比海调查情报员的死因，并在当地渔民库洛及CIA情报员莱特的协助下破坏神秘岛实验室的故事。影片于1962年10月5日上映。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/11/10-37-34-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
