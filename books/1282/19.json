{"id":36465,"no":19,"title":"XIX A SHOWER OF DEATH","content":"Bond took one long comprehensive look and pulled back. He leant against the cool face of rock and waited for his breathing to get back to normal. He lifted his knife close up to his eyes and carefully examined the blade. Satisfied, he slipped it behind him and down the waistband of his trousers up against his spine. There it would be handy but protected from bitting against anything. He wondered about the lighter. He took it out of his hip pocket. As a hunk of metal it might be useful, but it wouldn\u0027t light any more and it might scrape against the rock. He put it down on the ground away from his feet. \n Then Bond sat down and meticulously went over the photograph that was in his brain. \n Round the corner, not more than ten yards away, was the crane. There was no back to the cabin. Inside it a man sat at the controls. It was the Chinese Negro boss, the driver of the marsh buggy. In front of him the jetty ran twenty yards out into the sea and ended in a T. An aged tanker of around ten thousand tons deadweight was secured alongside the top of the T. It stood well out of the water, its deck perhaps twelve feet above the quay. The tanker was called Blanche, and the Ant of Antwerp showed at her stern. There was no sign of life On board except one figure lolling at the wheel in the enclosed bridge. The rest of the crew would be below, battened away from the guano dust. From just to the right of the crane, an overhead conveyor-belt in a corrugated-iron housing ran out from the cliff-face. It was carried on high stanchions above the jetty and stopped just short of the hold of the tanker. Its mouth ended in a huge canvas sock, perhaps six feet in diameter,. The purpose of the crane was to lift the wireframed mouth of the sock so that it hung directly over the hold of the tanker and to move it to right or left to give even distribution. From out of the mouth of the sock, in a solid downward jet, the scrambled-egg-coloured guano dust was pouring into the hold of the tanker at a rate of tons a minute. \n Below, on the jetty, to the left and to leeward of the drifting smoke of the guano dust, stood the tall, watchful figure of Doctor No. \n That was all. The morning breeze feathered the deep-water anchorage, still half in shadow beneath the towering cliffs, the\u0027 conveyor-belt thudded quietly on its rollers, the crane\u0027s engine chuffed rhythmically. There was no other sound, no other movement, no other life apart from the watch at the ship\u0027s wheel, the trusty working at the crane, and Doctor No, seeing that all went well. On the other side of the mountain men would be working, feeding the guano to the conveyor-belt that rumbled away through the bowels of the rock, but on this side no one was allowed and no one was necessary. Apart from aiming the canvas mouth of the conveyor, there was nothing else for anyone to do. \n Bond sat and thought, measuring distances, guessing at angles, remembering exactly where the crane driver\u0027s hands and feet were on the levers and the pedals. Slowly, a thin, hard smile broke across the haggard, sunburned face. Yes! It was on! It could be done. But softly, gently, slowly! The prize was almost intolerably sweet. \n Bond examined the soles of his feet and his hands. They; would serve. They would have to serve. He reached back ana felt the handle of the knife. Shifted it an inch. He stood up and took several slow deep breaths, ran his hands through his salt-and sweat-matted hair, rubbed them harshly up and down his face and then down the tattered sides of his black jeans. He gave a final flex to his fingers. He was ready. \n Bond stepped up to the rock and inched an eye round. Nothing had changed. His guess at the distances had been right. The crane driver was watchful, absorbed. The neck above the open khaki shirt was naked, offered, waiting. Twenty yards away, Doctor No, also with his back to Bond, stood sentry over the thick rich cataract of whity-yellow dust. On the bridge, the watch was lighting a cigarette. \n Bond looked along the ten yards of path that led past the back of the crane. He picked out the places he would put each foot. Then he came out from behind the rock and ran. \n Bond ran to the right of the crane, to a point he had chosen where the lateral side of the cabin would hide him from the driver and the jetty. He got there and stopped, crouching, listening. The engine hurried on, the conveyor-belt rumbled steadily out of the mountain above and behind him. There was no change. \n The two iron footholds at the back of the cabin, inches away from Bond\u0027s face, looked solid. Anyway the noise of the engine would drown small sounds. But he would have to be quick to yank the man\u0027s body out of the seat and get his own hands and feet on the controls. The single stroke of the knife would have to be mortal. Bond felt along his own collarbone, felt the soft triangle of skin beneath which the jugular pumped, remembered the angle of approach behind the man\u0027s back, reminded himself to force the blade and hold it in. \n For a final second he listened, then he reached behind his back for the knife and went up the iron steps and into the cabin with the stealth and speed of a panther. \n At the last moment there was need to hurry. Bond stood behind the man\u0027s back, smelling him. He had time to raise his knife hand almost to the roof of the cabin, time to summon every ounce of strength, before he swept the blade down and into the square inch of smooth, brownish-yellow skin. \n The man\u0027s hands and legs splayed away from the controls. \u0027His face strained back towards Bond. It seemed to Bond that there was a flash of recognition in the bulging eyes before the whites rolled upwards. Then a strangled noise came from the open mouth and the big body rolled sideways off its iron seat and crashed to the floor. \n Bond\u0027s eyes didn\u0027t even follow it ajs far as the ground. He was akeady in the seat and reaching for the pedals and levers. Everything was out of control. The engine was running in neutral, the wire hawser was tearing off the drum, the tip of the crane was bending slowly forwards like a giraffe\u0027s neck, the canvas mouth of the conveyor-belt had wilted and was now pouring its column of dust between the jetty and the ship. Doctor No was staring upwards. His mouth was open. Perhaps he was shouting something. \n Coolly, Bond reined the machine in, slowly easing the levers and pedals back to the angles at which the driver had been holding them. The engine accelerated, the gears bit and began to work again. The hawser slowed on the spinning drum and reversed, bringing the canvas mouth up and over the ship. The tip of the crane lifted and stopped. The scene was as before. Now! \n Bond reached forward for the iron wheel which the driver had been handling when Bond had caught his first glimpse of him. Which way to turn it? Bond tried to the left. The tip of the crane veered slightly to the right. So be it. Bond spun the wheel to the right. Yes, by God, it was answering, moving across the sky, carrying the mouth of the conveyor with it. \n Bond\u0027s eyes flashed to the jetty. Doctor No had moved. He had moved a few paces to a stanchion that Bond had missed. He had a telephone in his hand. He was getting through to the other side of the mountain. Bond could see his hand frantically. jiggling the receiver arm, trying to attract attention. \n Bond whirled the director wheel. Christ, wouldn\u0027t it turn any faster? In seconds Doctor No would get through and it would be too late. Slowly the tip of the crane arced across the sky. Now the mouth of the conveyor was spewing the dust column down over the side of the ship. Now the yellow mound was marching silently across the jetty. Five yards, four, three, two! Don\u0027t look round, you bastard! Arrh, got you! Stop the wheel! Now, you take it, Doctor No! \n At the first brush of the stinking dust column, Doctor No had turned. Bond saw the long arms fling wide as if to embrace the thudding mass. One knee rose to run. The mouth opened and a thin scream came up to Bond above the noise of the engine. Then there was a brief glimpse of a kind of dancing snowman. And then only a mound of yellow bird dung that grew higher and higher. \n \"God!\" Bond\u0027s voice gave back an iron echo from the walls of the cabin. He thought of the screaming lungs stuffing with the filthy dust, the body bending and then falling under the weight, the last impotent kick of the heels, the last flash of thought-rage, horror, defeat?-and then the silence of the stinking tomb. \n Now the yellow mountain was twenty feet high. The stuff was spilling off the sides of the jetty into the sea. Bond glanced \n . at the ship. As he did so, there came three blasts on its siren. \n The noise crashed round the cliffs. There came a fourth blast which didn\u0027t stop. Bond could see the watch holding on to the lanyard as he craned out of the bridge window, looking down. Bond took his hands off the controls and let them rip. It was time to go. \n He slipped off the iron seat and bent over the dead body. He took the revolver out of the holster and looked at it. He smiled grimly-Smith \u0026 Wesson .38, the regular model. He slipped it down inside his waistband. It was fine to feel the heavy cold metal against his skin. He went to the door of the cabin and dropped down to the ground. \n An iron ladder ran up the cliif behind the crane to where the conveyor-housing jutted out. There was a small door in the corrugated iron wall of the housing. Bond scrambled up the ladder. The door opened easily, letting out a puff of guano dost, and he clambered through. \n Inside, the clanking of the conveyor-belt over its rollers was deafening, but there were dim inspection lights in the stone ceiling of the tunnel and a narrow catwalk that stretched away into the mountain alongside the hurrying river of dust. Bond moved quickly along it, breathing shallowly against the fishy ammoniac smell. At all costs he must get to the end before the significance of the ship\u0027s siren and of the unanswered telephone overcame the fear of the guards. \n Bond half ran and half stumbled through the echoing stinking tunnel. How far would it be? Two hundred yards? And then what? Nothing for it but to break out of the tunnel mouth and start shooting-cause a panic and hope for the best. He would get hold of one of the men and wring out of him where the girl was. Then what? When he got to the place on the mountainside, what would he find? What would be left of her? \n Bond ran on faster, his head down, watching the narrow breadth of planking, wondering what would happen if he missed his footing and slipped into the rushing river of guano dust. Would he be able to get off the belt again or would he be whirled away and down until he was finally spewed out on to the burial mound of Doctor No? \n When Bond\u0027s head hit into the soft stomach and he felt the hands at his throat, it was too late to think of his revolver. His only reaction was to throw himself down and forward at the legs. The legs gave against his shoulder and there was a shrill scream as the body crashed down on his back. \n Bond had started the heave that would hurl his attacker sideways and on to the conveyor-belt when the quality of the scream and something light and soft about the impact of the body froze his muscles. \n It couldn\u0027t be! \n As if in answer, sharp teeth bit deeply into the calf of his right leg and an elbow jabbed viciously, knowledgeably, backwards into his groin. \n Bond yelled with the pain. He tried to squirm sideways to protect himself, but even as he shouted \"Honey!\" the elbow thudded into him again. \n The breath whistled through Bond\u0027s teeth with the agony. There was only one way to stop her without throwing her on to the conveyor-belt. He took a firm grip of one ankle and heaved himself to his knees. He stood upright, holding her slung over his shoulder by one leg. The other foot banged against his head, but half-heartedly, as if she too realized that something was wrong. \n \"Stop it, Honey! It\u0027s me!\" \n Through the din of the conveyor-belt, Bond\u0027s shout got through to her. He heard her cry \"James!\" from somewhere near the floor. He felt her hands clutch at his legs. \"James, James!\" \n Bond slowly let her down. He turned and knelt and reached for her. He put his arms round her and held her tightly to him. \"Oh Honey, Honey. Are you all right?\" Desperately, unbelieving, he strained her to him. \n \"Yes, James! Oh, yes!\" He felt her hands at his back and his hair. \"Oh, James, my darling!\" she fell against him, sobbing. \n \"It\u0027s all right, Honey.\" Bond smoo\u0027thed her hair. \"And Doctor No\u0027s dead. But now we\u0027ve got to run for it. We\u0027ve got to get out of here. Come on! How can we get out of the tunnel? How did you get here? We\u0027ve got to hurry!\" \n As if in comment, the conveyor-belt stopped with a jerk. \n Bond pulled the girl to her feet. She was wearing a dirty suit of workmen\u0027s blue dungarees. The sleeves and legs were; rolled up. The suit was far too big for her. She looked like a girl in a man\u0027s pyjamas. She was powdered white with the guano dust except where the tears had marked her cheeks. She said breathlessly, \"Just up there! There\u0027s a side tunnel that leads to the machine shops and the garage. Will they come after us?\" \n There was no time to talk. Bond said urgently, \"Follow me!\" and started running. Behind him her feet padded softly in the hollow silence. They came to the fork where the side tunnel led off into the rock. Which way would the men come? Down the side tunnel or along the catwalk in the main tunnel? The sound of voices booming far up the side tunnel answered him. Bond drew the girl a few feet up the main tunnel. He brought her close to him and whispered, \"I\u0027m sorry. Honey. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to kill them.\" \n \"Of course.\" The answering whisper was matter of fact. She pressed his hand and stood back to give him room. She put her hands up to her ears. \n Bond eased the gun out of his waistband. Softly he broke the cylinder sideways and verified with his thumb that all six chambers were loaded. Bond knew he wasn\u0027t going to like this, killing again in cold blood, but these men would be the Chinese Negro gangsters, the strong-arm guards who did the dirty work. They would certainly be murderers many times over. Perhaps they were the ones who had killed Strangways and the girl. But there was no point in trying to ease his conscience. It was kill or be killed. He must just do it efficiently. \n The voices were coming closer. There were three men. They were talking loudly, nervously. Perhaps it was many years since they had even thought of going through the tunnel. Bond wondered if they would look round as they came out into the main tunnel. Or would he have to shoot them in the back? \n Now they were very close. He could hear their shoes scuffing the ground. \n \"That makes ten bucks you owe me, Sam.\" \n \"Not after tonight it won\u0027t be. Roll them bones, boy. Roll them bones.\" \n \"No dice for me tonight, feller. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to cut maself a slice of de white girl.\" \n \"Haw, haw, haw.\" \n The first man came out, then the second, then the third. They were carrying their revolvers loosely in their right hands. \n Bond said sharply, \"No, you won\u0027t.\" \n The three men whirled round. White teeth glinted in open mouths. Bond shot the rear man in the head and the second man in the stomach. The front man\u0027s gun was up. A bullet whistled past Bond and away up the main tunnel. Bond\u0027s gun crashed. The man clutched at his neck and spun slowly round and fell across the conveyor-belt. The echoes thundered slowly up and down the tunnel. A puff of fine dust rose in the air and settled. Two of the bodies lay still. The man with the stomach shot writhed and jerked. \n Bond tucked his hot gun into the waistband of his trousers. He said roughly to the girl, \"Come on.\" He reached for her hand and pulled her after him into the mouth of the side tunnel. He said, \"Sorry about that, Honey,\" and started running, pulling her after him by the hand. She said, \"Don\u0027t be stupid.\" Then there was no sound but the thud of their naked feet on the stone floor. \n The air was clean in the side tunnel and it was easier going but, after the tension of the shooting, pain began to crowd in again and take possession of Bond\u0027s body. He ran automatically. He hardly thought of the girl. His whole mind was focused on taking the pain and on the problems that waited at the end of the tunnel. \n He couldn\u0027t tell if the shots had been heard and he had no idea what opposition was left. His only plan was to shoot anyone who got in his way and somehow get to the garage and the marsh buggy. That was their only hope of getting away from the mountain and down to the coast. \n The dim yellow bulbs in the ceiling flickered by overhead. Still the tunnel stretched on. Behind him, Honey stumbled. Bond stopped, cursing himself for not having thought of her. She reached for him and for a moment she leaned against him panting. \"I\u0027m sorry, James. It\u0027s just that…\" \n Bond held her to him. He said anxiously, \"Are you hurt, Honey?\" \n \"No, I\u0027m all right. It\u0027s just that I\u0027m so terribly tired. And my feet got rather cut on the mountain. I fell a lot in the dark. If we could walk a bit. We\u0027re nearly there. And there\u0027s a door into the garage before we get to the machine shop. Couldn\u0027t we go in there?\" \n Bond hugged her to him. He said, \"That\u0027s just what I\u0027m looking for, Honey. That\u0027s our only hope of getting away. If you can stick it till we get there, we\u0027ve got a real chance.\" \n Bond put his arm round her waist and took her weight. He didn\u0027t trust himself to look at her feet. He knew they must be bad. It was no good being sorry for each other. There wasn\u0027t time for it if they we\u0027re to stay alive. \n They started moving again, Bond\u0027s face grim with the extra effort, the girl\u0027s feet leaving bloody footsteps on the ground, and almost immediately she whispered urgently and there was a wooden door in the wall of the tunnel and it was ajar and no sound came from the other side. \n Bond took out his gun and gently eased the door open. The long garage was empty. Under the neon lights the black and gold painted dragon on wheels looked like a float waiting for the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. It was pointing towards the sliding doors and the hatch of the armoured cabin stood open. Bond prayed that the tank was full and that the mechanic had carried out his orders to get the damage fixed. \n Suddenly, from somewhere outside, there was the sound of voices. They came nearer, several of them, jabbering urgently. \n Bond took the girl by the hand and ran forward. There was only one place to fide-in the marsh buggy. The girl scrambled in. Bond followed, softly pulling the door shut behind him. They crouched, waiting. Bond thought: only three rounds left in the gun. Too late he remembered the rack of weapons on the wall of the garage. Now the voices were outside. There came the clang of the door being slid back on its runners and a confusion of talk. \n \"How d\u0027ya know they were shootin\u0027?\" \n \"Couldn\u0027t been nuthen else. I should know.\" \n \"Better take rifles. Here, Joe! Take that one, Lemmy! An\u0027 some pineapples. Box under da table.\" \n There was the metallic noise of bolts being slid home and safety catches clicked. \n \"Some feller must a gone nuts. Couldn\u0027t ha\u0027 been da Limey. You ever seen da big pus-feller in da creek? Cheessus! An\u0027 da rest of da tricks da Doc fixed up in da tube? An\u0027 dat white gal. She cain\u0027t have been in much shape dis niornin\u0027. Any of you men bin to have a look?\" \n \"Nossir.\" \n \"No.\" \n \"No.\" \n \"Haw, haw. I\u0027se sho surprised at you fellers. Dat\u0027s a fine piece of ass out dere on de crab walk.\" \n More rattling and shuffling of feet, then, \"Okay let\u0027s go! Two abreast till we gets to da main tunnel. Shoot at da legs. Whoever\u0027s makin\u0027 trouble, da Doc\u0027ll sure want him to play wit.\" \n \"Tee-hee.\" \n Feet echoed hollowly on the concrete. Bond held his breath as they filed by. Would they notice the shut door of the buggy? But they went on down the garage and into the tunnel and the noise of them slowly faded away. \n Bond touched the girl\u0027s arm and put his finger to his lips. Softly he eased open the door and listened again. Nothing. He dropped to the ground and walked round the buggy and . went to the half-open entrance. Cautiously he edged his head round. There was no one in sight. There was a smell of frying food in the air that brought the saliva to Bond\u0027s mouth. Dishes and pans clattered in the nearest building, about twenty yards away, and from one of the further Quonsets came the sound of a guitar and a man\u0027s voice singing a calypso. Dogs started to bark half-heartedly and then were silent. The Dobermann Pinschers. \n Bond turned and ran back to the end of the garage. No sound came from the tunnel. Softly Bond closed the tunnel door and locked and bolted it. He went to the arms-rack on the wall and chose another Smith \u0026 Wesson and a Remington carbine. He verified that they were loaded and went to the door of the marsh buggy and handed them in to the girl. Now the entrance door. Bond put his shoulder to it and softly eased it wide open. The corrugated iron rumbled hollowly. Bond ran back and scrambled through the open hatch and into the driver\u0027s seat. \"Shut it, Honey,\" he whispered urgently and bent and turned the ignition key. \n The needle on the gauge swung to Full. Pray God the damned thing would start up quickly. Some diesels were slow. Bond stamped his foot down on the starter. \n The grinding rattle was deafening. It must be audible all over the compound! Bond stopped and tried again. The engine fluttered and died. And again, and this time the blessed thing fired and the strong iron pulse hammered as Bond revved it up. Now, gently into gear. Which one? Try this. Yes, it bit. Brake off, you bloody fool! Christ, it had nearly stalled. But now they were out and on the track and Bond rammed his foot down to the floor. \n \"Anyone after us?\" Bond had to shout above the noise of the diesel. \n \"No. Wait! Yes, there\u0027s a man come out of the huts! And another! They\u0027re waving and shouting at us. Now some more are corning out. One of them\u0027s run off to the right. Another\u0027s gone back into the hut. He\u0027s come out with a rifle. He\u0027s lying down. He\u0027s firing!\" \n \"Close the slot! Lie down on the floor!\" Bond glanced at the speedometer. Twenty. And they were on a slope. There was nothing more to get out of the machine. Bond concentrated on keeping the huge bucking wheels on the track. The cabin bounced and swayed on the springs. It was a job to keep his hands and feet on the controls. An iron fist clanged against the cabin. And another. What was the range? Four hundred? Good shooting! But that would be the lot. He shouted, \"Take a look, Honey! Open the slot an inch.\" \n \"The man\u0027s got up. He\u0027s stopped firing. They\u0027re all looking after us-a whole crowd of them. Wait, there\u0027s something else. The dogs are coming! There\u0027s no one with them. They\u0027re just tearing down the track after us. Will they catch us?\" \n \"Doesn\u0027t matter if they do. Come and sit by me, Honey. Hold tight. Mind your head against the roof.\" Bond eased up the throttle. She was beside him. He grinned sideways at her. \"Hell, Honey. We\u0027ve made it. When we get down to the lake I\u0027ll stop and shoot up the dogs. If I know those brutes I\u0027ve only got to kill one and the whole pack\u0027ll stop to eat him.\" \n Bond felt her hand at his neck. She kept it there as they swayed and thundered down the track. At the lake, Bond went on fifty yards into the water and turned the machine round and put it in neutral. Through the oblong slot he could see the pack streaming round the last bend. He reached down for the rifle and pushed it through the aperture. Now the dogs were in the water and swimming. Bond kept his finger on the trigger and sprayed bullets into the middle of them. One floundered, kicking. Then another and another. He could hear their snarling screams above the clatter of the engine. There was blood in the water, A fight had started. He saw one dog leap on one of the wounded ones and sink its teeth into the back of its neck. Now they all seemed to have gone berserk. They were milling around in the frothing bloody water. Bond emptied his magazine among them and dropped the gun on the floor. He said, \"That\u0027s that, Honey,\" and put the machine into gear and swung it round and began rolling at an easy speed across the shallow lake towards the distant gap in the mangroves that was the mouth of the river. \n For five minutes they moved along in silence. Then Bond put a hand on the girl\u0027s knee and said, \"We should be all right now, Honey. When they find the boss is dead there\u0027ll be panic. I guess some of the brighter ones will try and get away to Cuba in the plane or the launch. They\u0027ll worry about their skins, not about us. All the same, we\u0027ll not take the canoe out until it\u0027s dark. I guess it\u0027s about ten by now. We should be at the coast in an hour. Then we\u0027ll rest up and try and get in shape for the trip. Weather looks all right and there\u0027ll be a bit more moon tonight. Think you can make it?\" \n Her hand squeezed his neck. \"Of course I can, James. But what about you? Your poor body! It\u0027s nothing but burns and bruises. And what are those red marks across your stomach?\" \n \"Tell you later. I\u0027ll be okay. But you tell me what happened to you last night. How in hell did you manage to get away from the crabs? What went wrong with that bastard\u0027s plan? All night long I could only think of you out there being slowly eaten to death. God, what a thing to have dreamed up! What happened?\" \n The girl was actually laughing. Bond looked sideways. The golden hair was tousled and the blue eyes were heavy with lack of sleep, but otherwise she might just be coming home from a midnight barbecue. \n \"That man thought he knew everything. Silly old fool.\" She might have been talking about a stupid schoolteacher. \"He\u0027s much more impressed by the black crabs than I am. To begin with, I don\u0027t mind any animal touching me, and anyway those crabs wouldn\u0027t think of even nipping someone if they stay quite still and haven\u0027t got an open sore or anything. The whole point is that they don\u0027t really like meat. They live mostly on plants and things. If he was right and he did kill a black girl that way, either she had an open wound or she must have died of fright. He must have wanted to see if I\u0027d stand it. Filthy old man. I only fainted down there at dinner because I knew he\u0027d have something much worse for you.\" \n \"Well, I\u0027m damned. I wish to heaven I\u0027d known that. I thought of you being picked to pieces.\" \n The girl snorted. \"Of course it wasn\u0027t very nice having my clothes taken off and being tied down to pegs in the ground. But those black men didn\u0027t dare touch me. They just made jokes and then went away. It wasn\u0027t very comfortable out there on the rock, but I was thinking of you and how I could get at Doctor No and kill him. Then I heard the crabs beginning to run-that\u0027s what we call it in Jamaica-and soon they came scurrying and rattling along-hundreds of them. I just lay still and thought of you. They walked round me and over me. I might have been a rock for all they cared. They tickled a bit. One annoyed me by trying to pull out a bit of my hair. But they don\u0027t smell or anything, and I just waited for the early morning when they crawl into holes and go to sleep. I got quite fond of them. They were company. Then they got fewer and fewer and finally stopped coming and I could move. I pulled at all the pegs in turn and then concentrated on my right-hand one. In the end I got it out of the crack in the rock and the rest was easy. I got back to the buildings and began scouting about. I got into the machine shop near the garage and found this filthy old suit. Then the conveyor thing started up not far away and I thought about it and I guessed it must be taking the guano through the mountain. I knew you must be dead by then,\" the quiet voice was matter of fact, \"so I thought I\u0027d get to the conveyor somehow and get through the mountain and kill Doctor No. I took a screwdriver to do it with.\" She giggled. \"When we ran into each other, I\u0027d have stuck it into you only it was in my pocket and I couldn\u0027t get to it. I found the door in the back of the machine shop and walked through and into the main tunnel. That\u0027s all.\" She caressed the back of his neck. \"I ran along watching my step and the next thing I knew was your head hitting me in the stomach.\" She giggled again. \"Darling, I hope I didn\u0027t hurt you too much when we were fighting. My Nanny told me always to hit men there.\" \n Bond laughed. \"She did, did she?\" He reached out and caught her by the hair and pulled her face to him. Her mouth felt its way round his cheek and locked itself against his. \n The machine gave a sideways lurch. The kiss ended.
