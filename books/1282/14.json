{"id":36460,"no":14,"title":"XIV COME INTO MY PARLOUR","content":"The electric clock in the cool dark room in the heart of the mountain showed four-thirty. Outside the mountain, Crab Key had sweltered and stunk its way through another day. At the eastern end of the island, the mass of birds, Louisiana herons, pelicans, avocets, sandpipers, egrets, flamingoes and the few roseate spoonbills, went on with building, their nests or fished in the shallow waters of the lake. Most of the birds had been disturbed so often that year that they had given up any idea of building. In the past few months they had been raided at regular intervals by the monster that came at night and burned down their roosting places and the beginnings of their nests. This year many would not breed. There would be vague movements to migrate and many would die of the nervous hysteria that seizes bird colonies when they no longer have peace and privacy. At the other end of the island, on the guanera that gave the mountain its snow-covered look, the vast swarm of cormorants had passed their usual day of gorging themselves with fish and paying back the ounce of precious manure to their owner and protector. Nothing had interfered with their nesting season. Now they were noisily fiddling with the untidy piles of sticks that would be their nests-each pile at exactly sixty centimetres from the next, for the guanay is a quarrelsome bird and this sixty-centimetre ring represents their sparring space. Soon the females would be laying the three eggs from which their master\u0027s flock would be increased by an average of two young cormorants. Below the peak, where the diggings began, the hundred or so Negro men and women who were the labour force were coming to the end of the day\u0027s shift. Another fifty cubic yards of guano had been dug out of the mountainside and another twenty yards of terrace had been added to the working level. Below, the mountainside looked like terraced vineyards in Upper Italy, except that here there were no vines, only deep barren shelves cut in the mountainside. And here, instead of the stink of marsh gas on the rest of the island, there was a strong ammoniac smell, and the ugly hot wind that kept the diggings dry blew the freshly turned whitish-brown dust into the eyes and ears and noses of the diggers. But the workers were used to the smell and the dust, and it was easy, healthy work. They had no complaints. The last iron truck of the day started off on the Decauville Track that snaked down the mountainside to the crusher and separator. A whistle blew and the workers shouldered their clumsy picks and moved lazily down towards the high-wired group of Quonset huts that was their compound. Tomorrow, on the other side of the mountain, the monthly ship would be coming in to the deep-water quay they had helped to build ten years before, but which, since then, they had never seen. That would mean fresh stores and fresh goods and cheap jewellery at the canteen. It would be a holiday. There would be rum and dancing and a few fights. Life was good. Life was good, too, for the senior outside staff-all Chinese Negroes like the men who had hunted Bond and Quarrel and the girl. They also stopped work in the garage and the machine shops and at the guard posts and filtered off to the \u0027officers\u0027\u0027 quarters. Apart from watch and loading duties, tomorrow would also be a holiday for most of them. They too would have their drinking and dancing, and there would be-a new monthly batch of girls from \u0027inside\u0027. Some \u0027marriages\u0027 from the last lot would continue for further months or weeks according to the taste of the \u0027husband\u0027, but for the others there would be a fresh choice. There would be some of the older girls who had had their babies in the creche and were coming back for a fresh spell of duty \u0027outside\u0027, and there would be a sprinkling of young ones who had come of age and would be \u0027coming out\u0027 for the first time. There would be fights over these and blood would be shed, but in the end the officers\u0027 quarters would settle down for another month of communal life, each officer with his woman to look after his needs. Deep down in the cool heart of the mountain, far below this well-disciplined surface life, Bond awoke in his comfortable bed. Apart from a slight nembutal headache he felt fit and rested. Lights were on in the girl\u0027s room and he could hear her moving about. He swung his feet to the ground and, avoiding the fragments of glass from the broken lamp, walked softly over to the clothes cupboard and put on the first kimono that came to his hand. He went to the door. The girl had a pile of kimonos out on the bed and was trying them on in front of the wall mirror. She had on a very smart one in sky-blue silk. It looked wonderful against the gold of her skin. Bond said, \"That\u0027s the one.\" She whirled round, her hand at her mouth. She took it down. \"Oh, it\u0027s you!\" She smiled at him. \"I thought you\u0027d never wake up. I\u0027ve been to look at you several times. I\u0027d made up my mind to wake you at five. It\u0027s half-past four and I\u0027m hungry. Can you get us something to eat?\" \"Why not,\" Bond walked across to her bed. As he passed her he put his arm round her waist and took her with him. He examined the bells. He pressed the one marked \u0027Room Service\u0027. He said, \"What about the others? Let\u0027s have the full treatment\" She giggled. \"But what\u0027s a manicurist?\" \"Someone who does your nails. We must look our best for Doctor No.\" At the back of Bond\u0027s mind was the urgent necessity to get his hands on some kind of weapon-a pair of scissors would be better than nothing. Anything would do. He pressed two more bells. He let her go and looked round the room. Someone had come while they were asleep and taken away the breakfast things. There was a drink tray on a sideboard against the wall. Bond went over and examined it. It had everything. Propped among the bottles were two menus, huge double-folio pages covered with print. They might have been from the Savoy Grill, or the \u002721\u0027, or the Tour d\u0027Argent. Bond ran his eye down one of them. It began with Caviar double de Beluga and ended with Sorbet d la Champagne. In between was every dish whose constituents would not be ruined by a deep freeze. Bond tossed it down. One certainly couldn\u0027t grumble about the quality of the cheese in the trap! There was a knock on the door and the exquisite May came in. She was followed by two other twittering Chinese girls. Bond brushed aside their amiabilities, ordered tea and buttered toast for Honeychile and told them to look after her hair and nails,. Then he went into the bathroom and had a couple of Aspirins and a cold shower. He put on his kimono again, reflected that he looked idiotic in it, and went back into the room. A beaming May asked if he would be good enough to select what he and Mrs. Bryce could care to have for dinner. Without enthusiasm, Bond ordered caviar, grilled lamb cutlets and salad, and angels on horseback for himself. When Honeychile refused to make any suggestions, he chose melon, roast chicken a PAnglaise and vanilla icecream with hot chocolate sauce for her. May dimpled her enthusiasm and approval. \"The Doctor asks if seven forty-five for eight would be convenient.\" Bond said curtly that it would. \"Thank you so much, Mr Bryce. I will call for you at seven forty-four.\" Bond walked over to where Honeychile was being ministered to at the dressing table. He watched the busy delicate fingers at work on her hair\u0027and her nails. She smiled at him excitedly in the mirror. He said gruffly, \"Don\u0027t let them make too much of a monkey out of you,\" and went to the drink tray. He poured himself out a stiff Bourbon and soda and took it into his own room. So much for his idea of getting hold of a weapon. The scissors and \u0027files and probes were attached to the mani-curist\u0027s waist by a chain. So were the scissors of the hairdresser. Bond sat down on his rumpled bed and lost himself in drink and gloomy reflections. The women went. The girl looked in at him. When he didn\u0027t lift his head she went back into her room and left him alone. In due course Bond came into her room to get himself another drink. He said perfunctorily, \"Honey, you look wonderful.\" He glanced at the clock on the wall and went back and drank his drink and put on another of the idiotic kimonos, a plain black one. In due course there came the soft knock on the door and the two of them went silently out of the room and along the empty, gracious corridor. May stopped at the lift. Its doors were held open by another eager Chinese gui. They walked in and the doors shut. Bond noticed that the lift was made by Waygood Otis. Everything in the prison was de luxe. He gave an inward shudder of distaste. He noticed the reaction. He turned to the girl. \"I\u0027m sorry, Honey. Got a bit of a headache.\" He didn\u0027t want to tell her that all this luxury play-acting was getting him down, that he hadn\u0027t the smallest idea what it was all about, that he knew it was bad news, and that he hadn\u0027t an inkling of a plan of how to get them out of whatever situation they were in. That was the worst of it. There was nothing that depressed Bond\u0027s spirit so much as the knowledge that he hadn\u0027t one line of either attack or defence. The girl moved closer to him. She said, \"I\u0027m sorry, James. I hope it will go away. You\u0027re not angry with me about anything?\" Bond dredged up a smile. He said, \"No, darling. I m only angry with myself.\" He lowered his voice: \"Now, about this evening. Just leave the talking to me. Be natural and don\u0027t be worried by Doctor No. He may be a bit mad.\" She nodded solemnly. \"I\u0027ll do my best.\" The lift sighed to a stop. Bond had no idea how far down they had gone-a hundred feet, two hundred? The automatic doors hissed back and Bond and the girl stepped out into a large room. It was empty. It was a high-ceilinged room about sixty feet long, lined on three sides with books to the ceiling. At first glance, the fourth wall seemed to be made of solid blue-black glass. The room appeared to be a combined study and library. There was a big paper-strewn desk in one corner and a central table with periodicals and newspapers. Comfortable club chairs, upholstered in red leather, were dotted about. The carpet was dark green, and the lighting, from standard lamps, was subdued. The only odd feature was that the drink tray and sideboard were up against the middle of the long glass wall, and chairs and occasional tables with ashtrays were arranged in a semi-circle round it so that the room was centred in front of the empty wall. Bond\u0027s eye caught a swirl of movement in the dark glass. He walked across the room. A silvery spray of small fish with a bigger fish in pursuit fled across the dark blue. They disappeared, so to speak, off the edge of the screen. What was this? An aquarium? Bond looked upwards. A yard below the ceiling, small waves were lapping at the glass. Above the waves was a strip of greyer blue-black, dotted with sparks of light. The outlines of Orion were the clue. This was not an aquarium. This was the sea itself and the night sky. The whole of one side of the room was made of armoured glass. They were under the sea, looking straight into its heart, twenty feet down. Bond and the girl stood transfixed. As they watched, there was the glimpse of two great goggling orbs. A golden sheen of head and deep flank showed for an instant and was gone. A big grouper? A silver swarm of anchovies stopped and hovered and sped away. The twenty-foot tendrils of a Portuguese man-o\u0027-war drifted slowly across the window, glinting violet as they caught the light. Up above there was the dark mass of its underbelly and the outline of its inflated bladder, steering with the breeze. Bond walked along the wall, fascinated by the idea of living with this slow, endlessly changing moving picture. A frig tulip . shell was progressing slowly up the window from the floor level, a frisk of demoiselles and angel fish and a ruby-red moonlight snapper were nudging and rubbing themselves against a corner of the glass and a sea centipede quested along, nibbling at the minute algae that must grow every day on the outside of the window. A long dark shadow paused in the centre of the window and then moved slowly away. If only one could see more! Obediently, two great shafts of light, from off the \u0027screen\u0027, lanced out into the water. For an instant they searched independently. Then they converged on the departing shadow and the dull grey torpedo of a twelve-foot shark showed up in all its detail. Bond could even see the piglike pink eyes roll inquisitively in the light and the slow pulse of the slanting gill-rakers. For an instant the shark turned straight into the converged beam and the white half-moon mouth showed below the reptile\u0027s flat head. It stood poised for a second and then, with an elegant, disdainful swirl, the great swept-back tail came round and with a lightning quiver the shark had gone. The searchlights went out. Bond turned slowly. He expected to see Doctor No, but still the room was empty. It looked static and lifeless compared with the pulsing mysteries outside the window. Bond looked back. What must this be like in the colours of day, when one could see everything perhaps for twenty yards or more? What must it be like in a storm when the waves crashed noiselessly against the glass, delving almost to the floor and then sweeping up and out of sight. What must it be like in the evening when the last golden shafts of the sun shone into the upper half of the room and the waters below were full of dancing motes and tiny water insects? What an amazing man this must be who had thought of this fantastically beautiful conception, and what an extraordinary engineering feat to have carried it out! How had he done it? There could only be one way. He must have built the glass wall deep inside the cliff and then delicately removed layer after layer of the outside rock until the divers could prise off the last skin of coral. But how thick was the glass? Who had rolled it for him? How had he got it to the island? How many divers had he used? How much, God in heaven, could it have cost? \"One million dollars.\" \"It was a cavernous, echoing voice, with a trace of American accent. Bond turned slowly, almost reluctantly, away from the window. Doctor No had come through a door behind his desk. He stood looking at them benignly, with a thin smile on his lips. \"I expect you were wondering about the cost. My guests usually think about the material side after about fifteen minutes. Were you?\" \"I was.\" Still smiling (Bond was to get used to that thin smile), Doctor No came slowly out from behind the desk and moved towards them. He seemed to glide rather than take steps. His knees did not dent the matt, gunmetal sheen of his kimono and no shoes showed below the sweeping hem. Bond\u0027s first impression was of thinness and erectness and height. Doctor No was at least six inches taller than Bond, but the straight immovable poise of his body made him seem still taller. The head also was elongated and tapered from a round, completely bald skull down to a sharp chin so that the impression was of a reversed raindrop-or rather oildrop, for the skin was of a deep almost translucent yellow. It was impossible to tell Doctor No\u0027s age: as far as Bond could see, there were no lines on the face. It was odd to see a forehead as smooth as the top of the polished skull. Even the cavernous indrawn cheeks below the prominent cheekbones looked as smooth as fine ivory. There was something Dali-esque about the eyebrows, which were fine and black, and sharply upswept as if they had been painted on as makeup for a conjurer. Below them, slanting jet black eyes stared out of the skull. They were without eyelashes. They looked like the mouths of two small revolvers, direct and unblinking and totally devoid of expression. The thin fine nose ended very close above a wide compressed wound of a mouth which, despite its almost permanent sketch of a smile, showed only cruelty and authority. The chin was indrawn towards the neck. Later Bond was to notice that it rarely moved more than slightly away from centre, giving the impression that the head and the vertebra were in one piece. The bizarre, gliding figure looked like a giant venomous-worm wrapped in grey tin-foil, and Bond would not have been surprised to see the rest of it trailing slimily along the carpet behind. Doctor No came within three steps of them and stopped. The wound in the tall face opened. \"Forgive me for not shaking hands with you,\" the deep voice was flat and even. \"I am unable to.\" Slowly the sleeves parted and opened. \"I have no hands.\" The two pairs of steel pincers came out on their gleam-ing stalks and were held up for inspection like the hands of a praying mantis. Then the two sleeves joined again. Bond felt the girl at his side give a start. The black apertures turned towards her. They slid down to her nose. The voice said flatly, \"It is a misfortune.\" The eyes came back to Bond. \"You were admiring my aquarium.\" It was a statement, not a question. \"Man enjoys the beasts and the birds. I decided to enjoy also the fish. I find them far more varied and interesting. I am sure you both share my enthusiasm.\" Bond said, \"I congratulate you. I shall never forget this room.\" \"No.\" Again a statement, perhaps with a sardonic inflection, of fact. \"But we have much to talk about. And so little time. Please sit down. You will have a drink? Cigarettes are beside your chairs.\" Doctor No moved to a high leather chair and folded himself down on to the seat. Bond took the chair opposite. The girl sat between them and slightly back. Bond felt a movement behind him. He looked over his shoulder. A short man, a Chinese Negro, with the build of a wrestler, stood at the drink tray. He was dressed in black trousers and a smart white jacket. Black almond eyes in a wide moon face met his and slid incuriously away. Doctor No said, \"This is my bodyguard. He is expert in many things. There is no mystery about his sudden appearance. I always carry what is known as a walkie-talkie here,\" he inclined his chin towards the bosom of his kimono. \"Thus I can summon him when he is needed. What will the girl have?\" Not \u0027Your Wife\u0027. Bond turned to Honeychile. Her eyes were wide and staring. She said quietly, \"A Coca-Cola, please.\" Bond felt a moment of relief. At least she was not being got down by the performance. Bond said, \"And I would like a medium Vodka dry Martini-with a slice of lemon peel. Shaken-and not stirred, please. I would prefer Russian or Polish vodka.\" Doctor No gave his thin smile an extra crease. \"I see you are also a man who knows what he wants. On this occasion your desires will be satisfied. Do yoju not find that it is generally so? When one wants a thing one gets it? That is my experience.\" \"The small things.\" \"If you fail at the large things it means you have not large ambitions. Concentration, focus-that is all. The aptitudes come, the tools forge themselves. \u0027Give me a fulcrum and I will move the world\u0027-but only if the desire to move the world is there.\" The thin lips bent minutely downwards in deprecation. \"But this is chatter. We are making conversation. Instead, let us talk. Both of us, I am sure, prefer talk to conversation. Is the Martini to your liking? You have cigarettes-enough and the right sort to cosset your cancer? So be it. Sam-sam, put the shaker beside the man and another bottle of Coca-Cola beside the girl. It should now be eight-ten. We will have dinner at nine o\u0027clock precisely.\" Doctor No sat slightly more upright in his chair. He inclined himself forward, staring at Bond. There was a moment\u0027s silence in the room. Then Doctor No said, \"And now Mister James Bond of the Secret Service, let us tell each other our secrets. First, to show you that I hide nothing, I will tell you mine. Then you will tell me yours.\" Doctor No\u0027s eyes blazed darkly. \"But let us tell each other the truth.\" He drew one steel claw out of the wide sleeve and held it upwards. He paused, \"I shall do so. But you must do the same. If you do not, these,\" he pointed the claw at his eyes, \"will know that you are lying.\" Doctor No brought the steel claw delicately in front of each eye and tapped the centre of each eyeball. Each eyeball in turn emitted a dull ting. \"These,\" said Doctor No, \"see everything.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555/46120.html","bookId":1282,"book":{"id":1282,"title":"007之诺博士 Dr. No","description":"简介： 《007之诺博士》是由特伦斯杨执导，肖恩康纳利、乌苏拉安德丝主演的动作片。该片是007系列的开山之作，故事讲述詹姆斯邦德奉命前往加勒比海调查情报员的死因，并在当地渔民库洛及CIA情报员莱特的协助下破坏神秘岛实验室的故事。影片于1962年10月5日上映。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/11/10-37-34-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
