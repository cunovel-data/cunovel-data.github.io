{"id":36450,"no":4,"title":"IV RECEPTION COMMITTEE","content":"The sixty-eight tons deadweight of the Super-Constella-tion hurtled high above the green and brown chequerboard of Cuba and, with only another hundred miles to go, started its slow declining flight towards Jamaica. \\n\\n Bond watched the big green turtle-backed island grow on the horizon and the water below him turn from the dark blue of the Cuba Deep to the azure and milk of the inshore shoals. Then they were over the North Shore, over its rash of millionaire hotels, and crossing the high mountains of the interior. The scattered dice of small-holdings showed on the slopes and in clearings in the jungle, and the setting sun flashed gold on the bright worms of tumbling rivers and streams. \u0027Xaymaca* the Arawak Indians had called it-\u0027The Land of Hills and Rivers\u0027. Bond\u0027s heart lifted with the beauty of one of the most fertile islands in the world. \\n\\n The other side of the mountains was in deep violet shadow. Lights were already twinkling in the foothills and spangling the streets of Kingston, but, beyond, the far arm of the harbour and the airport were still touched with the sun against which the Port Royal lighthouse blinked ineffectually. Now the Constellation was getting its nose down into a wide sweep beyond the harbour. There was a slight thump as the tricycle landing gear extended under the aircraft and locked into position, and a shrill hydraulic whine as the brake flaps slid out of the trailing edge of the wings. Slowly the great aircraft turned in again towards the land and for a moment the setting sun poured gold into the cabin. Then, the plane had dipped below the level of the Blue Mountains and was skimming down towards the single north-south runway. There was a glimpse of a road and telephone wires. Then the concrete, scarred with black skid-marks, was under the belly of the plane and there was the soft double thump of a perfect landing and the roar of reversing props as they taxied in towards the low white airport buildings. \\n\\n The sticky fingers of the tropics brushed Bond\u0027s face as he left the aircraft and walked over to Health and Immigration. \\n\\n He knew that by the time he had got through Customs he would be sweating. He didn\u0027t mind. After the rasping cold of London, the stuffy, velvet heat was easily bearable. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s passport described him as \u0027Import and Export Merchant\u0027. \\n\\n \"What company, sir?\" \\n\\n \"Universal Export.\" \\n\\n \"Are you here on business or pleasure, sir?\" \\n\\n \"Pleasure.\" \\n\\n \"I hope you enjoy your stay, sir.\" The Negro immigration officer handed Bond his passport with indifference. \\n\\n \"Thank you.\" \\n\\n Bond walked out into the Customs hall. At once he saw the tall brown-skinned man against the barrier. He was wearing the same old faded blue shirt and probably the same khaki twill trousers he had been wearing when Bond first met him five years before. \\n\\n \"Quarrel!\" \\n\\n From behind the barrier the Cayman Islander gave a broad grin. He lifted his right forearm across his eyes in the old salute of the West Indians. \"How you, cap\u0027n?\" he called delightedly. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" said Bond. \"Just wait till I get my bag through. Got the car?\" \\n\\n \"Sure, cap\u0027n.\" \\n\\n The Customs officer who, like most men from the waterfront, knew Quarrel, chalked Bond\u0027s bag without opening it and Bond picked it up and went out through the barrier. Quarrel took it from him and held out his right hand. Bond took the warm dry calloused paw and looked into the dark grey eyes that showed descent from a Cromwellian soldier or a pirate of Morgan\u0027s time. \"You haven\u0027t changed, Quarrel,\" he said affectionately. \"How\u0027s the turtle fishing?\" \\n\\n \"Not so bad, cap\u0027n, an\u0027 not so good. Much de same as always.\" He looked critically at Bond. \"Yo been sick, or somepun?\" \\n\\n Bond was surprised. \"As a matter of fact I have. But I\u0027ve been fit for weeks. What made you say that?\" \\n\\n Quarrel was embarrassed. \"Sorry, cap\u0027n,\" he said, thinking he might have offended Bond. \"Dere some pain lines in yo face since de las\u0027 time.\" \\n\\n \"Oh well,\" said Bond. \"It was nothing much. But I could do with a spell of your training. I\u0027m not as fit as I ought to be.\" \\n\\n \"Shooting, cap\u0027n.\" \\n\\n They were moving towards the exit when there came the sharp crack and flash of a Press camera. A pretty Chinese girl in Jamaican dress was lowering her Speed Graphic. She came up to them. She said with synthetic charm, \"Thank you, gentlemen. I am from the Daily Gleaner.\" She glanced down at a list in her hand. \"Mister Bond, isn\u0027t it? And how long will you be with us, Mister Bond?\" \\n\\n Bond was offhand. This was a bad start. \"In transit,\" he said shortly. \"I think you\u0027ll find there were more interesting people on the plane.\" \\n\\n \"Oh no, I\u0027m sure not, Mister Bond. You look very important. And what hotel will you be staying at?\" \\n\\n Damn, thought Bond. He said \"Myrtle Bank\" and moved on. \\n\\n \"Thank you, Mister Bond,\" said the tinkling voice. \"I hope you\u0027ll enjoy…\" \\n\\n They were outside. As they walked towards the parking place Bond said, \"Ever seen that girl at the airport before?\" \\n\\n Quarrel reflected. \"Reck\u0027n not, cap\u0027n. But de Gleaner have plenty camera gals.\" \\n\\n Bond was vaguely worried. There was no earthly reason why his picture should be wanted by the Press. It was five years since his last adventures on the island, and anyway his name had been kept out of the papers. \\n\\n They got to the car. It was a black Sunbeam Alpine. Bond looked sharply at it and then at the number plate. Strangways\u0027s car. What the hell? \"Where did you get this, Quarrel?\" \\n\\n \"ADC tell me fe to take him, cap\u0027n. Him say hit de only spare car dey have. Why, cap\u0027n? Him no good?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s all right, Quarrel,\" said Bond resignedly. \"Come on, let\u0027s get going.\" \\n\\n Bond got into the passenger seat. It was entirely his fault. He might have guessed at the chance of getting this car. But it would certainly put the finger on him and on what he was doing in Jamaica if anyone happened to be interested. \\n\\n They moved off down the long cactus-fringed road towards the distant lights of Kingston. Normally, Bond would have sat and enjoyed the beauty of it all-the steady zing of the crickets, the rush of warm, scented air, the ceiling of stars, the necklace of yellow lights shimmering across the harbour-but now he was cursing his carelessness and knowing what he shouldn\u0027t have done. \\n\\n What he had done was to send one signal through the Colonial Office to the Governor. In it he had first asked that the ADC should get Quarrel over from the Cayman Islands for an indefinite period on a salary of ten pounds a week. Quarrel had been with Bond on his last adventure in Jamaica. He was an invaluable handyman with all the fine seaman\u0027s qualities of the Cayman Islander, and he was a passport into the lower strata of coloured life which would otherwise be closed to Bond. Everybody loved him and he was a splendid companion. Bond knew that Quarrel was vital if he was to get anywhere on the Strangways case-whether it was a case or just a scandal. Then Bond had asked for a single room and shower at the Blue Hills Hotel, for the loan of a car and for Quarrel to meet him with the car at the airport. Most of this had been wrong. In particular Bond should have taken a taxi to his hotel and made contact with Quarrel later. Then he would have seen the car and had a chance to change it. \\n\\n As it was, reflected Bond, he might just as well have advertised his visit and its purpose in the Gleaner. He sighed. It was the mistakes one made at the beginning of a case that were the worst. They were the irretrievable ones, the ones that got you off on the wrong foot, that gave the enemy the first-game. But was there an enemy? Wasn\u0027t he being over-cautious? On an impulse Bond turned in his seat. A hundred yards behind were two dim sidelights. Most Jamaicans drive with their headlights full on. Bond turned back. He said, \"Quarrel. At the end of the Palisadoes, where the left fork goes to Kingston and right to Morant, I want you to turn quickly down the \u0027 Morant road and stop at once and turn your lights off. Right? And now go like hell.\" \\n\\n \"Okay, cap\u0027n.\" Quarrel\u0027s voice sounded pleased. He put his foot down to the floorboards. The little car gave a deep growl and tore off down the white road. \\n\\n Now they were at the end of the straight. The car skidded round the curve where the corner of the harbour bit into the land. Another five hundred yards and they would be at the intersection. Bond looked back. There was no sign of the other car. Here was the signpost. Quarrel did a racing change and hurled the car round on a tight lock. He pulled in to the side and dowsed his lights. Bond turned and waited. At once he heard the roar of a big car at speed. Lights blazed on, looking for them. Then the car was past and tearing on towards Kingston. Bond had time to notice that it was a big American type taxicab and that there was no one in it but the driver. Then it was gone. \\n\\n The dust settled slowly. They sat for ten minutes saying nothing. Then Bond told Quarrel to turn the car and take the Kingston road. He said, \"I think that car was interested in us, Quarrel. You don\u0027t drive an empty taxi back from the airport. It\u0027s an expensive run. Keep a watch out. He may find we\u0027ve fooled him and be waiting for us.\" \\n\\n \"Sho ting, cap\u0027n,\" said Quarrel happily. This was just the sort of life he had hoped for when he got Bond\u0027s message. \\n\\n They came into the stream of Kingston traffic-buses, cars, horse-drawn carts, pannier-laden donkeys down from the hills, and the hand-drawn barrows selling violent coloured drinks. In the crush it was impossible to say if they were being followed. They turned off to the right and up towards the hills. There were many cars behind them. Any one of them could have been the American taxi. They drove for a quarter of an hour up to Halfway Tree and then on to the Junction Road, the main road across the island. Soon there was a neon sign of a green palm tree and underneath \u0027Blue Hills. THE hotel\u0027. They drove in and up the drive lined with neatly rounded bushes of bougainvillaea. \\n\\n A hundred yards higher up the road the black taxi waved the following drivers on and pulled in to the left. It made a U-turn in a break in the traffic and swept back down the hill towards Kingston. \\n\\n The Blue Hills was a comfortable old-fashioned hotel with modern trimmings. Bond was welcomed with deference because his reservation had been made by King\u0027s House. He was shown to a fine corner room with a balcony looking out over the distant sweep of Kingston harbour. Thankfully he\" took off his London clothes, now moist with perspiration, and went into the glass-fronted shower and turned the cold water full on and stood under it for five minutes during which he washed his hair to remove the last dirt of big-city life. Then he pulled on a pair of Sea Island cotton shorts and, with sensual pleasure at the warm soft air on his nakedness, unpacked his things and rang for the waiter. \\n\\n Bond ordered a double gin and tonic and one whole green lime. When the drink came he cut the lime in half, dropped the two squeezed halves into the long glass, almost filled the glass with ice cubes and then poured in the tonic. He took the drink out on to the balcony, and sat and looked out across the spectacular view. He thought how wonderful it was to be away from headquarters, and from London, and from hospitals, and to be here, at this moment, doing what he was doing and knowing, as all his senses told him, that he was on a good tough case again. \\n\\n He sat for a while, luxuriously, letting the gin relax him. He ordered another and drank it down. It was seven-fifteen. He had arranged for Quarrel to pick him up at seven-thirty. They were going to have dinner together. Bond had asked Quarrel to suggest a place. After a moment of embarrassment, Quarrel had said that whenever he wanted to enjoy himself in Kingston he went to a waterfront nightspot called the Joy Boat. \"Hit no great shakes, cap\u0027n,\" he had said apologetically, \"but da food an\u0027 drinks an\" music is good and I got a good fren\u0027 dere. Him owns de joint. Dey calls him \u0027Pus-Feller\u0027 seein\u0027 how him once fought wit\u0027 a big hoctopus.\" \\n\\n Bond smiled to himself at the way Quarrel, like most West Indians, added an \u0027h\u0027 where it wasn\u0027t needed and took it off when it was. He went into his room and dressed in his old dark blue tropical worsted suit, a sleeveless white cotton shirt and a black knitted tie, looked in the glass to see that the Walther didn\u0027t show under his armpit and went down and out to where the car was waiting. \\n\\n They swooped down quietly through the soft singing dusk into Kingston and turned to the left along the harbour side. They passed one or two smart restaurants and night clubs from which came the throb and twang of calypso music. There was a stretch of private houses that dwindled into a poor-class shopping centre and then into shacks. Then, where the road curved away from the sea, there was a blaze of golden neon in the shape of a Spanish galleon above green lettering that said \u0027The Joy Boat\u0027. They pulled into a parking place and Bond followed Quarrel through the gate into a small garden of palm trees growing out of lawn. At the end was the beach and the sea. Tables were dotted about under the palms, and in the centre was a small deserted cement dance floor to one side of which a calypso trio in sequined scarlet shirts was softly improvising on \u0027Take her to Jamaica where the rum comes from\u0027. \\n\\n Only half the tables were filled, mostly by coloured people. There was a sprinkling of British and American sailors with their girls. An immensely fat Negro in a smart white dinner jacket left one of the tables and came to meet them. \\n\\n \"Hi, Mister Q. Long time no see. Nice table for two?\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Pus-Feller. Closer to da kitchen dan da music.\" \\n\\n The big man chuckled. He led them down towards the sea and placed them at a quiet table under a palm tree that grew out of the base of the restaurant building. \"Drinks gemmun?\" \\n\\n Bond ordered his gin and tonic with a lime, and Quarrel a Red Stripe beer. They scanned the menu and both decided on broiled lobster followed by a rare steak with native vegetables. \\n\\n The drinks came. The glasses were dripping with con- * densation. The small fact reminded Bond of other times in hot climates. A few yards away the sea lisped on the flat sand. The three-piece began playing \u0027Kitch\u0027. Above them the palm fronds clashed softly in the night breeze. A gecko chuckled somewhere in the garden. Bond thought of the London he had left the day before. He said, \"I like this place, Quarrel.\" \\n\\n Quarrel was pleased. \"Him a good fren of mine, da Pus-Feller. Him knows mostly what goes hon hin Kingston case you got hany questions, cap\u0027n. Him come from da Caymans. Him an\u0027 me once share a boat. Then him go hoff one day catching boobies\u0027 heggs hat Crab Key. Went swimmin\u0027 to a rock for more heggs an\u0027 dis big hoctopus get him. Dey mos\u0027ly small fellers roun\u0027 here but dey come bigger at da Crab seein\u0027 how its alongside de Cuba Deep, da deepest waters roun\u0027 dese parts. Pus-Feller have himself a bad time wit dis hanimal. Bust one lung cuttin\" hisself free. Dat scare him an\u0027 him sell me his half of da boat an\u0027 come to Kingston. Dat were \u0027fore da war. . Now him rich mail whiles I go hon fishin\u0027.\" Quarrel chuckled at the quirk of fate. \\n\\n \"Crab Key,\" said Bond. \"What sort of a place is that?\" \\n\\n Quarrel looked at him sharply. \"Dat a bad luck place now, cap\u0027n,\" he said shortly. \"Chinee gemmun buy hit durin\u0027 da war and bring in men and dig bird-dirt. Don\u0027 let nobody land dere and don\u0027 let no one get hoff. We gives it a wide bert\u0027.\" \\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\" \\n\\n \"Him have plenty watchmen. An\u0027 guns-machine guns. An\u0027 a radar. An\u0027 a spottin\u0027 plane. Frens o\u0027 mine have landed dere and him never been seen again. Dat Chinee keep him island plenty private. Tell da trut\u0027, cap\u0027n,\" Quarrel was apologetic, \"dat Crab Key scare me plenty.\" \\n\\n Bond said thoughtfully, \"Well, well.\" \\n\\n The food came. They ordered another round of drinks and ate. While they ate, Bond gave Quarrel an outline of the Strangways case. Quarrel listened carefully, occasionally asking questions. He was particularly interested in the birds on Crab Key, and what the watchmen had said, and how the plane was supposed to have crashed. Finally he pushed his plate away. He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. He took out a cigarette and lit it. He leant forward. \"Cap\u0027n,\" he said softly, \"I no mind if hit was birds or butterflies or bees. If dey was on Crab Key and da Commander was stickin\u0027 his nose into da business, yo kin bet yo bottom dollar him been mashed. Him and him girl. Da Chinee mash dem for sho.\" \\n\\n Bond looked carefully into the urgent grey eyes. \"What makes you so certain?\" \\n\\n Quarrel spread his hands. To him the answerwas simple. \"Dat Chinee love him privacy. Him want be left alone. I know him kill ma frens order keep folk away from da Crab. Him a mos\u0027 powerful man. Him kill hanyone what hinterfere with him.\" \\n\\n \"Why?\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027 rightly know, cap\u0027n,\" said Quarrel indifferently.\"People dem want different tings in dis world. An\u0027 what dem want sufficient dem gits.\" \\n\\n A glint of light caught the corner of Bond\u0027s eye. He turned quickly. The Chinese girl from the airport was standing in the nearby shadows. Now she was dressed in a tight-fitting sheath of black satin slashed up one side almost to her hip. \\n\\n She had a Leica with a flash attachment in one hand. The other was in a leather case at her side. The hand came out holding a flashbulb. The girl slipped the base into her mouth to wet it and improve the contact and made to screw it into the reflector. \\n\\n \"Get that girl,\" said Bond quickly. \\n\\n In two strides Quarrel was up with her. He held out his hand. \"Evenin\", missy,\" he said softly. \\n\\n The girl smiled. She let the Leica hang on the thin strap round her neck. She took Quarrel\u0027s hand. Quarrel swung her round like a ballet dancer. Now he had her hand behind her back and she was in the crook of his arm. \\n\\n She looked up at him angrily. \"Don\u0027t. You\u0027re hurting.\" \\n\\n Quarrel smiled down into the flashing dark eyes in the pale, almond-shaped face. \"Cap\u0027n like you take a drink wit\" we,\" he said soothingly. He came back to the table, moving the girl along with him. He hooked a chair out with his foot and sat her down beside him, keeping the grip on her wrist behind her back. They sat bolt upright, like quarrelling lovers. \\n\\n Bond looked into the pretty, angry little face. \"Good evening. What are you doing here? Why do you want another picture of me?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing the nightspots,\" the Cupid\u0027s bow of a mouth parted persuasively. \"The first picture of you didn\u0027t come out. Tell this man to leave me alone.\" \\n\\n \"So you work for the Gleaner? What\u0027s your name?\" \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t tell you.\" \\n\\n Bond cocked an eyebrow at Quarrel. \\n\\n Quarrel\u0027s eyes narrowed. His hand behind the girl\u0027s back turned slowly. The girl struggled like an eel, her teeth clenched on her lower lip. Quarrel went on twisting. Suddenly she said \"Ow!\" sharply and gasped, \"I\u0027ll tell I\" Quarrel eased his grip. The girl looked furiously at Bond: \"Annabel Chung.\" \\n\\n Bond said to Quarrel, \"Call the Pus-Feller.\" \\n\\n Quarrel picked up a fork with his free hand and clanged it against a glass. The big Negro hurried up. \\n\\n Bond looked up at him. \"Ever seen this girl before?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, boss. She come here sometimes. She bein\u0027 a nuisance? Want for me to send her away?\" \\n\\n \"No. We like her,\" said Bond amiably, \"but she wants to take a studio portrait .of me and I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s worth the money. Would you call up the Gleaner and ask if they\u0027ve got a photographer called Annabel Chung? If she really is one of their people she ought to be good enough.\" \\n\\n \"Sure, boss.\" The man hurried away. \\n\\n Bond smiled at the girl. \"Why didn\u0027t you ask that man to rescue you?\" \\n\\n The girl glowered at him. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to have to exert pressure,\" said Bond, \"but my export manager in London said that Kingston was full of shady characters. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not one of them, but I really can\u0027t understand why you\u0027re so anxious to get my picture. Tell me why.\" \\n\\n \"What I told you,\" said the girl sulkily. \"It\u0027s my job.\" \\n\\n Bond tried other questions. She didn\u0027t answer them. The Pus-Feller came up. \"That\u0027s right, boss. Annabel Chung. One of their freelance girls. They say she takes fine pictures. You\u0027ll be okay with her.\" He looked bland. Studio portrait! Studio bed, more like. \\n\\n \"Thanks,\" said Bond. The Negro went away. Bond turned back to the girl. \"Freelance,\" he said softly. \"That still doesn\u0027t explain who wanted my picture.\" His face went cold. \"Now give!\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said the girl sullenly. \\n\\n \"All right, Quarrel. Go ahead.\" Bond sat back. His instincts told him that this was the sixty-four thousand dollar question. If he could get the answer out of the girl he might be saved weeks of legwork. \\n\\n Quarrel\u0027s right shoulder started to dip downwards. The girl squirmed towards him to ease the pressure, but he held her body away with his free hand. The girl\u0027s face strained towards Quarrel\u0027s. Suddenly she spat full in his eyes. Quarrel grinned and increased the twist. The girl\u0027s feet kicked wildly under the table. She hissed out words in Chinese. Sweat beaded on her forehead. \\n\\n \"Tell,\" said Bond softly. \"Tell and it will stop and we\u0027ll be friends and have a drink.\" He was getting worried. The girl\u0027s arm must be on the verge of breaking. \\n\\n \"------you.\" Suddenly the girl\u0027s left hand flew up and into \\n\\n Quarrel\u0027s face. Bond was too slow to stop her. Something glinted and there was a sharp explosion. Bond snatched at her arm and dragged it back. Blood was streaming down Quarrel\u0027s cheek. Glass and metal tinkled on to the table. She had smashed the flashbulb on Quarrel\u0027s face. If she had been able to reach an eye it would have been blinded. \\n\\n Quarrel\u0027s free hand went up and felt his cheek. He put it in front of his eyes and looked at the blood. \"Aha!\" There was nothing but admiration and a feline pleasure in his voice. He said equably to Bond, \"We get nuthen out. of dis gal, cap\u0027n. She plenty tough. You want fe me to break she\u0027s arm?\" \\n\\n \"Good God, no.\" Bond let go the arm he was holding. \"Let her go.\" He felt angry with himself for having hurt the girl and still failed. But he had learned something. Whoever was behind her held his people by a steel chain. \\n\\n Quarrel brought the girl\u0027s right arm from behind her back. He still held on to the wrist. Now he opened the girl\u0027s hand. \\n\\n He looked into her eyes. His own were cruel. \"You mark me, Missy. Now I mark you.\" He brought up his other hand and took the Mount of Venus, the soft lozenge of flesh in the palm below her thumb, between his thumb and forefinger. He began to squeeze it. Bond could see his knuckles go white with the pressure. The girl gave a yelp. She hammered at Quarrel\u0027s hand and then at his face. Quarrel grinned and squeezed harder. Suddenly he let go. The girl shot to her feet and backed away from the table, her bruised hand at her mouth. She took her hand down and hissed furiously. \"He\u0027ll get you, you bastards!\" Then, her Leica dangling, she ran off through the trees. \\n\\n Quarrel laughed shortly. He took a napkin and wiped it down his cheek and threw it on the ground and took up another. He said to Bond, \"She\u0027s Love Moun\u0027 be sore long after ma face done get healed. Dat a fine piece of a woman, de Love Moun\u0027. When him fat like wit\u0027 dat girl you kin tell her\u0027ll be good in bed. You know dat, cap\u0027n?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Bond. \"That\u0027s new to me.\" \\n\\n \"Sho ting. Dat piece of da han\u0027 most hindicative. Don\u0027 you worry \u0027bout she,\" he added, noticing the dubious expression on Bond\u0027s face. \"Hers got nuttin but a big bruise on she\u0027s Love Moun\u0027. But boy, was dat a fat Love Moun\u0027! I come back after dat girl sometime, see if ma teory is da troof.\" \\n\\n Appropriately the band started playing \u0027Don\u0027 touch me tomato\u0027. Bond said \"Quarrel, it\u0027s time you married and settled down. And you leave that girl alone or you\u0027ll get a knife between your ribs. Now come on. We\u0027ll get the check and go. It\u0027s three o\u0027clock in the morning in London where I was yesterday. I need a night\u0027s sleep. You\u0027ve got to start getting me into training. I think I\u0027m going to need it. And it\u0027s about time you put some plaster on that cheek of yours. She\u0027s written her name and address on it.\" \\n\\n Quarrel grunted reminiscently. He said with quiet pleasure, \"Dat were some tough baby.\" He picked up a fork and clanged it against his glass. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555/46110.html","bookId":1282,"book":{"id":1282,"title":"007之诺博士 Dr. No","description":"简介： 《007之诺博士》是由特伦斯杨执导，肖恩康纳利、乌苏拉安德丝主演的动作片。该片是007系列的开山之作，故事讲述詹姆斯邦德奉命前往加勒比海调查情报员的死因，并在当地渔民库洛及CIA情报员莱特的协助下破坏神秘岛实验室的故事。影片于1962年10月5日上映。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/11/10-37-34-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
