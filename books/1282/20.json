{"id":36466,"no":20,"title":"XX SLAVE-TIME","content":"\"You\u0027re quite sure of all this?\" \\n\\n The Acting Governor\u0027s eyes were hunted, resentful. How could these things have been going on under his nose, in one of Jamaica\u0027s dependencies? What would the Colonial Office have to say about it? He already saw the long, pale blue envelope marked \u0027Personal. For Addressee Only\u0027, and the foolscap page with those very wide margins: \u0027The Secretary\" of State for the Colonies has instructed me to express to you his surprise…\u0027. \\n\\n \"Yes, sir. Quite sure.\" Bond had no sympathy for the man. He hadn\u0027t liked the reception he had had on his last visit to King\u0027s House, nor the mean comments on Strangways and the girl. He liked the memory of them even less now that he knew his friend and the girl were at the bottom of the Mona Reservoir. \\n\\n \"Er-well we mustn\u0027t let any of this get out to the Press. You understand that? I\u0027ll send my report in to the Secretary of State by the next bag. I\u0027m sure I can rely on your…\" \\n\\n \"Excuse me, sir.\" The Brigadier in command of the Caribbean Defence Force was a modern young soldier of thirty-five. His military record was good enough for him to be unimpressed by relics from the Edwardian era of Colonial Governors, whom he collectively referred to as \u0027feather-hatted fuddy-duddies\u0027. \"I think we can assume that Commander Bond is unlikely to communicate with anyone except his Department. And if I may say so, sir, I submit that we should take steps to clear up Crab Key without waiting for approval from London. I can provide a platoon ready to embark by this evening. HMS Narvik came in yesterday. If the programme of receptions and cocktail parties for her could possibly be deferred for forty-eight hours or so…\" The Brigadier let his sarcasm hang in the air. \\n\\n \"I agree with the Brigadier, sir.\" The voice of the Police Superintendent was edgy. Quick action might save him from a reprimand, but it would have to be quick. \"And in any case I shall have to proceed immediately against the various Jamaicans who appear to be implicated. I\u0027ll have to get the divers working at Mona. If this case is to be cleaned up we can\u0027t afford to wait for London. As Mister-er-Commander Bond says, most of these Negro gangsters will probably be in Cuba by now. Have to get in touch with my opposite number in Havana and catch up with them before they take to the hills or go underground. I think we ought to move at once, sir.\" \\n\\n There was silence in the cool shadowy room where the meeting was being held. Qn the ceiling above the massive mahogany conference table there was an unexpected dapple of sunlight. Bond guessed that it shone up through the slats of the jalousies from a fountain or a lily pond in the garden outside the tall windows. Far away there was the sound of tennis balls being knocked about. Distantly a young girl\u0027s voice called, \"Smooth. Your serve, Gladys.\" The Governor\u0027s children? Secretaries? From one end of the room King George VI, from the other end the Queen, looked down the table with grace and good humour. \\n\\n \"What do you think, Colonial Secretary?\" The Governor\u0027s voice was hustled. \\n\\n Bond listened to the first few words. He gathered that Pleydell-Smith agreed with the other two. He stopped listening. His mind drifted into a world of tennis courts and lily ponds and kings and queens, of London, of people being photographed with pigeons on their heads in Trafalgar Square, of the forsythia that would soon be blazing on the bypass roundabouts, of May, the treasured housekeeper in his flat off the King\u0027s Road, getting up to brew herself a cup of tea (here it was eleven o\u0027clock. It would be four o\u0027clock in London), of the first tube trains beginning to run, shaking the ground beneath his cool, dark bedroom. Of the douce weather of England: the soft airs, the \u0027heat waves, the cold spells-\u0027The only country where you can take a walk every day of the year\u0027-Chesterfield\u0027s Letters? And then Bond thought of .Crab Key, of the hot ugly wind beginning to blow, of the stink of the marsh gas from the mangrove swamps, the jagged grey, dead coral in whose holes the black crabs were now squatting, the black and red eyes moving swiftly on their stalks as a shadow-a cloud, a bird-broke their small horizons. Down in the bird colony the brown and white and pink birds would be stalking in the shallows, or fighting or nesting, while up on the guanera the cormorants would be streaming back from their breakfast to deposit their milligramme of rent to the landlord who would no longer be collecting. And where would the landlord be? The men from the SS Blanche would have dug him out. The body would have been examined for signs of life and then put somewhere. Would they have washed the yellow dust off him and dressed him in his kimono while the Captain radioed Antwerp for instructions? And where had Doctor No\u0027s soul gone to? Had it been a bad soul or just a mad one? Bond thought of the burned twist down in the swamp that had been Quarrel. He remembered the soft ways of the big body, the innocence in the grey, horizon-seeking eyes, the simple lusts and desires, the reverence for superstitions and instincts, the childish faults, the loyalty and even love that Quarrel had given him-the warmth, there was only one word for it, of the man. Surely he hadn\u0027t, gone to the same place as Doctor No. Whatever happened to dead people, there was surely one place for the warm and another for the cold. And which, when the time came, would he, Bond, go to? \\n\\n The Colonial Secretary was mentioning Bond\u0027s name. Bond pulled himself together. \\n\\n \"… survived is quite extraordinary. I do think, sir, that we should show our gratitude to Commander Bond and to his Service by accepting his recommendations. It does seem, sir, that he has done at least three-quarters of the job. Surely the least we can do is look after the other quarter.\" \\n\\n The Governor grunted. He squinted down the table at Bond. The chap didn\u0027t seem to be paying much attention. But one couldn\u0027t be sure with these Secret Service fellows. Dangerous chaps to have around, sniffing and snooping. And their damned Chief carried a lot of guns in Whitehall. Didn\u0027t do to get on the wrong side of him. Of course there was something to be said for sending the Narvik. News would leak, of course. All the Press of the world would be coming down on his head. But then suddenly the Governor saw the headlines: \u0027GOVERNOR TAKES SWIFT ACTION… ISLAND\u0027S STRONG MAN INTERVENES… THE NAVY\u0027S THERE!\u0027 Perhaps after all it would be better to do it that way. Even go down and see the troops off himself. Yes, that was it, by jove. Cargill, of the Gleaner, was coming to lunch. He\u0027d drop a hint or two to the chap and make sure the story got proper coverage. Yes, that was it. That was the way to play the hand. \\n\\n The Governor raised his hands and let them fall flat on the table in a gesture of submission. He embraced the conference with a wry smile of surrender. \\n\\n \"So I am overruled, gentlemen. Well, then,\" the voice was avuncular, telling the children that just this once… \"I accept your verdict. Colonial Secretary, will you please call upon the commanding officer of HMS Narvik and explain the position. In strict confidence, of course. Brigadier, I leave the military arrangements in your hands. Superintendent, you will know what to do.\" The Governor rose. He inclined his head regally in the direction of Bond. \"And it only remains to express my appreciation to Commander-er-Bond, for his part in this affair. I shall not fail to mention your assistance, Commander, to the Secretary of State.\" \\n\\n Outside the sun blazed down on the gravel sweep. The interior of the Hillman Minx was a Turkish bath. Bond\u0027s bruised hands cringed as they took the wheel. \\n\\n Pleydell-Smith leant through the window. He said, \"Ever heard the Jamaican expression \u0027rarse\u0027?\" \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \"\u0027Rarse, man\u0027 is a vulgar expression meaning-er-\u0027stuff it up\u0027. If I may say so, it would have been appropriate for you to have used the expression just now. However,\" Pleydell-Smith gave a wave of his hand which apologized for his Chief and dismissed him, \"is there anything else I can do for you? You really think you ought to go back to Beau Desert? They were quite definite at the hospital that they want to have you for a week.\" \\n\\n \"Thanks,\" said Bond shortly, \"but I\u0027ve got to get back. See the girl\u0027s all right. Would you tell the hospital I\u0027ll be back tomorrow? You got off that signal to my Chief?\" \\n\\n \"Urgent rates.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" Bond pressed the self-starter, \"I guess that\u0027s the lot. You\u0027ll see the Jamaica Institute people about the girl, won\u0027t you? She really knows the hell of a lot about the natural history side of the island. Not from books either. If they\u0027ve got the right sort of job… Like to see her settled. I\u0027ll take her up to New York myself and see her through the operation. She\u0027d be ready to start in a couple of weeks after that. Incidentally,\" Bond looked embarrassed, \"she\u0027s really the hell of a fine girl. When she comes back… if you and your wife… You know. Just so there\u0027s someone to keep an eye on her.\" \\n\\n Pleydell-Smith smiled. He thought he had the picture. He said, \"Don\u0027t worry about that. I\u0027ll see to it. Betty\u0027s rather a hand at that sort of thing. She\u0027ll like taking the girl under her wing. Nothing else? See you later in the week, anyway. That hospital\u0027s the hell of a place in this heat. You might care to spend a night or two with us before you go ho-I mean to New York. Glad to have you-er-both.\" \\n\\n \"Thanks. And thanks for everything else.\" Bond put the car into gear and went off down the avenue of flaming tropical shrubbery. He went fast, scattering the gravel on the bends. He wanted to get the hell away from King\u0027s House, and the tennis, and the kings and queens. He even wanted to get the hell away from the .kindly Pleydell-Smith. Bond liked the man, but all he wanted now was to get back across the Junction Road to Beau Desert and away from the smooth world. He swung out past the sentry at the gates and on to the main road. He put his foot down. \\n\\n The night voyage under the stars had been without incident. No one had come after them. The girl had done most of the sailing. Bond had not argued with her. He had lain in the bottom of the boat, totally collapsed, like a dead man. He had woken once or twice and listened to the slap of the sea against the hull and watched her quiet profile under the stars. Then the cradle of the soft swell had sent him back to sleep and to the nightmares that reached out after him from Crab Key. He didn\u0027t mind them. He didn\u0027t think he would ever mind a nightmare now. After what had happened the night before, it would have to be strong stuff that would ever frighten him again. \\n\\n The crunch of a nigger-head against the hull had woken him. They were coming through the reef into Morgan\u0027s Harbour. The first quarter moon was up, and inside the reef the sea was a silver mirror. The girl had brought the canoe through under sail. They slid across the bay to the little fringe of sand and the bows under Bond\u0027s head sighed softly into it. She had had to help him out of the boat and across the velvet lawn and into the house. He had clung to her and cursed her softly as she had cut his clothes off him and taken him into the shower. She had said nothing when she had seen his battered body under the lights. She had turned the water full on and taken soap and washed him down as if he had been a horse. Then she led him out from under the water and dabbed him softly dry with towels that were soon streaked with blood. He had seen her reach for the bottle of Milton. He had groaned and taken hold of the washbasin and waited for it. Before she had begun to put it on him, she had come round and kissed him on the lips. She had said softly, \"Hold tight, my darling. And cry. It\u0027s going to hurt,\" and as she splashed the murderous stuff over his body the tears of pain had run out of his eyes and down his cheeks without shame. \\n\\n Then there had been a wonderful breakfast as the dawn flared up across the bay, and then the ghastly drive over to Kingston to the white table of the surgery in the emergency ward. Pleydell-Smith had been summoned. No questions had been asked. Merthiolate had been put on the wounds and tannic ointment on the burns. The efficient Negro doctor had written busily in the duty report. What? Probably just \u0027Multiple burns and contusions\u0027. Then, with promises to come into the private ward on the next day, Bond had gone off with Pleydell-Smith to King\u0027s House and to the first of the meetings that had ended with the full-dress conference. Bond had enciphered a short signal to M via the Colonial Office which he had coolly concluded with: \u0027REGRET MUST AGAIN REQUEST SICK LEAVE STOP \\n\\n SURGEONS REPORT FOLLOWS STOP KINDLY INFORM ARMOURER SMITH AND WESSON INEFFECTIVE AGAINST FLAME-THROWER ENDIT.\u0027 \\n\\n Now, as Bond swung the little car down the endless S-bends towards the North Shore, he regretted the gibe. M wouldn\u0027t like it. It was cheap. It wasted cipher groups. Oh well! Bond swerved to avoid a thundering red bus with \u0027Brownskin Gal\u0027 on the destination plate. He had just wanted M to know that it hadn\u0027t quite been a holiday in the sun. He would apologize when he sent in his written report. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s bedroom was cool and dark. There was a plate of sandwiches and a Thermos full of coffee beside the turned-down bed. On the pillow was a sheet of paper with big childish writing. It said, \"You are staying with me tonight. I can\u0027t leave my animals. They were fussing. And I can\u0027t leave you. And you owe me slave-time. I will come at seven. Your H,\" \\n\\n In the dusk she came across the lawn to where Bond was sitting finishing his third glass of Bourbon-on-the-rocks. She was wearing a black and white striped cotton skirt and a tight sugar-pink blouse. The golden hair smelled of cheap shampoo. She looked incredibly fresh and beautiful. She reached out her hand and Bond took it and followed her up the drive and along a narrow well-trodden path through the sugar cane. It wound along for quite a way through the tall whispering sweet-scented jungle. Then there was a patch of tidy lawn up against thick broken stone walls and steps that led down to a heavy door whose edges glinted with light. \\n\\n She looked up at him from the door. \"Don\u0027t be frightened. The cane\u0027s high and they\u0027re most of them out.\" \\n\\n Bond didn\u0027t know what he had expected. He had vaguely thought of a flat earthen floor and rather damp walls. There would be a few sticks of furniture, a broken bedstead covered with rags, and a strong zoo smell. He had been prepared to be careful about hurting her feelings. \\n\\n Instead it was rather like being inside a very large tidy cigar-box. The floor and ceiling were of highly polished cedar that gave out a cigar-box smell and the walls were panelled with wide split bamboo. The light came from a dozen candles in a fine silver chandelier that hung from the centre of the ceiling. High up in the walls there were three square windows through which Bond could see the dark blue sky and the stars. There were several pieces of good nineteenth-century furniture. Under the chandelier a table was laid for two with expensive-looking old-fashioned silver and glass. \\n\\n Bond said, \"Honey, what a lovely room. From what you said I thought you lived in a sort of zoo.\" \\n\\n She laughed delightedly. \"I got out the old silver and things. It\u0027s all I\u0027ve got. I had to spend the day polishing it. I\u0027ve never had it out before. It does look rather nice, doesn\u0027t it? You see, generally there are a lot of little cages up against the wall. I like having them with me. It\u0027s company. But now that you\u0027re here…\" She paused. \"My bedroom\u0027s in there,\" she gestured at the other door. \"It\u0027s very small, but there\u0027s room for both of us. Now come on. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s cold dinner-just lobsters and fruit.\" \\n\\n Bond walked over to her. He took her in his arms and kissed her hard on the lips. He held her and looked down into the shining blue eyes. \"Honey, you\u0027re a wonderful girl. You\u0027re one of the most wonderful girls I\u0027ve ever known. I hope the world\u0027s not going to change you too much. D\u0027you really want to have that operation? I love your face-just as it is. It\u0027s part of you. Part of all this.\" \\n\\n She frowned and freed herself. \"You\u0027re not to be serious tonight. Don\u0027t talk about these things. I don\u0027t want to talk about them. This is my night with you. Please talk about love. I don\u0027t want to hear about anything else. Promise? Now come on. You sit there.\" \\n\\n Bond sat down. He smiled up at her. He said, \"I promise.\" \\n\\n She said, \"Here\u0027s the mayonnaise. It\u0027s not out of a bottle. I made it myself. And take some bread and butter.\" She sat down opposite him and began to eat, watching him. When she saw that he seemed satisfied she said, \"Now you can start telling me about love. Everything about it. Everything you know.\" \\n\\n Bond looked across into the flushed, golden face. The eyes were bright and soft in the candlelight, but with the same imperious glint they had held when he had first seen her on the beach and she had thought he had come to steal her shells. The full red lips were open with excitement and impatience. With him she had no inhibitions. They were two loving animals. It was natural. She had no shame. She could ask him anything and would expect him to answer. It was as if they were already in bed together, lovers. Through the tight cotton bodice the points of her breasts showed, hard and roused. \\n\\n Bond said, \"Are you a virgin?\" \\n\\n \"Not quite. I told you. That man.\" \\n\\n \"Well…\" Bond found he couldn\u0027t eat any more. His mouth waa dry at the thought of her. He said, \"Honey, I can either eat or talk love to you. I can\u0027t do both.\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027re going over to Kingston tomorrow. You\u0027ll get plenty to eat there. Talk love.\" \\n\\n Bond\u0027s eyes Were fierce blue slits. He got up and went down on one knee beside her. He picked up her hand and looked into it. At the base of the thumb the Mount of Venus swelled luxuriously. Bond bent his head down into the warm soft hand and bit softly into the swelling. He felt her other hand in his hair. He bit harder. The hand he was holding curled round his mouth. She was panting. He bit still harder. She gave a little scream and wrenched his head away by the hair. \\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Her eyes were wide and dark. She had gone pale. She dropped her eyes and looked at his mouth. Slowly she pulled his head towards her. \\n\\n Bond put out a hand to her left breast and held it hard. He lifted her captive, wounded hand and put it round his neck. Their mouths met and clung, exploring. \\n\\n Above them the candles began to dance. A big hawkmoth had come in through one of the windows. It whirred round the chandelier. The girl\u0027s closed eyes opened, looked at the moth. Her mouth drew away. She smoothed the handful of his hair back and got up, and without saying anything took down the candles one by one and blew them out. The moth whirred away through one of the windows. \\n\\n The girl stood away from the table. She undid her blouse and threw it on the floor. Then her skirt. Under the glint of moonlight she was a pale figure with a central shadow. She came to Bond and took him by the hand and lifted him up. She undid his shirt and slowly, carefully took it off. Her body, close to him, smelled of new-mown hay and sweet pepper. She led him away from the table and through a door. The filtering moonlight shone down on a single bed. On the bed was a sleeping-bag, its mouth laid open. \\n\\n The girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleeping-bag. She looked up at him. She said, practically, \"I bought this today. It\u0027s a double one. It cost a lot of money. Take those off and come in. You promised. You owe me slave-time.\" \\n\\n \"But…\" \\n\\n \"Do as you\u0027re told.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555/46126.html","bookId":1282,"book":{"id":1282,"title":"007之诺博士 Dr. No","description":"简介： 《007之诺博士》是由特伦斯杨执导，肖恩康纳利、乌苏拉安德丝主演的动作片。该片是007系列的开山之作，故事讲述詹姆斯邦德奉命前往加勒比海调查情报员的死因，并在当地渔民库洛及CIA情报员莱特的协助下破坏神秘岛实验室的故事。影片于1962年10月5日上映。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/11/10-37-34-80-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1555","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
