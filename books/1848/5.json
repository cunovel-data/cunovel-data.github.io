He sent word to me in Cornwall.\" His gaze drifted over Jenny\u0027s face, registering the startling changes that had altered her face from its thin, freckled, girlish plainness into a face of almost exotic beauty. \"Ye\u0027ve your mother\u0027s look about ye now, lass, and it\u0027s whetted the appetites of an old man. I\u0027d no\u0027 ask this of you if there was any other way.\" Gruffly, he reminded her, \"You used to plead wi\u0027 me to name you laird. Ye said there was naught you wouldna\u0027 do fer yer clan…\"\\n\\n Jenny\u0027s stomach twisted into sick knots at the thought of committing her body, her entire life, into the hands of a man she instinctively recoiled from, but she lifted her head and bravely met her father\u0027s gaze. \"Aye, father,\" she said quietly. \"Shall I come with you now?\"\\n\\n The look of pride and relief on his face almost made the sacrifice worthwhile. He shook his head. \" \u0027Tis best you stay here with Brenna. We\u0027ve no horses to spare and we\u0027re anxious to reach Merrick and begin preparations for battle. I\u0027ll send word to the MacPherson that the marriage is agreed upon, and then send someone here to fetch you to him.\"\\n\\n When he turned to remount his horse, Jenny gave into the temptation she\u0027d been fighting all along: Instead of standing aside, she moved into the rows of mounted clansmen who had once been her friends and playmates. Hoping that some of them had perhaps heard her agree to marry the MacPherson and that this might neutralize their contempt of her, she paused beside the horse of a ruddy, red-headed man. \"Good day to you, Renald Garvin,\" she said, smiling hesitantly into his hooded gaze. \"How fares your lady wife?\"\\n\\n His jaw hardened, his cold eyes flickering over her. \"Well enough, I imagine,\" he snapped.\\n\\n Jenny swallowed at the unmistakable rejection from the man who had once taught her to fish and laughed with her when she fell into the stream.\\n\\n She turned around and looked beseechingly at the man in the column beside Renald. \"And you, Michael MacCleod? Has your leg been causing you any pain?\"\\n\\n Cold blue eyes met hers, then looked straight ahead.\\n\\n She went to the rider behind him whose face was filled with hatred and she held out her hand beseechingly, her voice choked with pleading. \"Garrick Carmichael, it has been four years since your Becky drowned. I swear to you now, as I swore to you then, I did not shove her into the river. We were not quarreling—\u0027twas a lie invented by Alexander to—\"\\n\\n His face as hard as granite, Garrick Carmichael spurred his horse forward, and without ever looking at her, the men began passing her by.\\n\\n Only old Josh, the clan\u0027s armorer, pulled his ancient horse to a halt, letting the others go on ahead. Leaning down, he laid his callused palm atop her bare head. \"I know you speak truly, lassie,\" he said, and his unceasing loyalty brought the sting of tears to her eyes as she gazed up into his soft brown ones. \"Ye have a temper, there\u0027s no denyin\u0027 it, but even when ye were but a wee thing, ye kept it bridled. Garrick Carmichael and the others might o\u0027 been fooled by Alexander\u0027s angelic looks, but not ol\u0027 Josh. You\u0027ll no\u0027 see me grievin\u0027 o\u0027er the loss o\u0027 him! The clan\u0027ll be better by far wit\u0027 young William leadin\u0027 it. Carmichael and the others—\" he added reassuringly, \"they\u0027ll come about in their thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 you, once they ken yer marrying the MacPherson for their sake as well as your sire\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Where are my stepbrothers?\" Jenny asked hoarsely, changing the subject lest she burst into tears.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re comin\u0027 home by a different route. We couldn\u0027t be sure the Wolf wouldn\u0027t try to attack us while we marched, so we split up after leavin\u0027 Cornwall.\" With another pat on her head, he spurred his horse forward.\\n\\n As if in a daze, Jenny stood stock-still in the middle of the road, watching her clan ride off and disappear around the bend.\\n\\n \"It grows dark,\" Brenna said beside her, her gentle voice filled with sympathy. \"We should go back to the abbey now.\"\\n\\n The abbey. Three short hours ago, Jenny had walked away from the abbey feeling cheery and alive. Now she felt—dead. \"Go ahead without me. I—I can\u0027t go back there. Not yet. I think I\u0027ll walk up the hill and sit for a while.\"\\n\\n \"The abbess will be annoyed if we aren\u0027t back before dusk, and it\u0027s near that now,\" Brenna said apprehensively. It had always been thus between the two girls, with Jenny breaking a rule and Brenna terrified of bending one. Brenna was gentle, biddable, and beautiful, with blond hair, hazel eyes, and a sweet disposition that made her, in Jenny\u0027s eyes, the embodiment of womanhood at its best. She was also as meek and timid as Jenny was impulsive and courageous. Without Jenny, she\u0027d not have had a single adventure—nor ever gotten a scolding. Without Brenna to worry about and protect, Jenny would have had many more adventures—and many more scoldings. As a result, the two girls were entirely devoted to each other, and tried to protect one another as much as possible from the inevitable results of each other\u0027s shortcomings.\\n\\n Brenna hesitated and then volunteered with only a tiny tremor in her voice, \"I\u0027ll stay with you. If you remain alone, you\u0027ll forget about time and likely be pounced upon by a—a bear in the darkness.\"\\n\\n At the moment, the prospect of being killed by a bear seemed rather inviting to Jenny, whose entire life stretched before her, shrouded in gloom and foreboding. Despite the fact that she truly wanted, needed, to stay outdoors and try to reassemble her thoughts, Jenny shook her head, knowing that if they stayed, Brenna would be drowning in fear at the thought of facing the abbess. \"No, we\u0027ll go back.\"\\n\\n Ignoring Jenny\u0027s words, Brenna clasped Jenny\u0027s hand and turned to the left, toward the slope of the hill that overlooked the abbey, and for the first time it was Brenna who led and Jenny who followed.\\n\\n In the woods beside the road, two shadows moved stealthily, staying parallel with the girls\u0027 path up the hill.\\n\\n By the time they were partway up the steep incline, Jenny had already grown impatient with her own self-pity, and she made a Herculean effort to shore up her flagging spirits. \"When you think on it,\" she offered slowly, directing a glance at Brenna, \" \u0027tis actually a grand and noble thing I\u0027ve been given the opportunity to do—marrying the MacPherson for the sake of my people.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-5.html","bookId":1848,"book":{"id":1848,"title":"A Kingdom of Dreams (Westmoreland Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: #1 bestselling author Judith McNaught dazzles with this beloved romantic classic, “one of the best ever” (Rendezvous), in which two defiant hearts clash over a furious battle of wills in a glorious age of chivalry. \\n Abducted from her convent school, headstrong Scottish beauty Jennifer Merrick does not easily surrender to Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore.
