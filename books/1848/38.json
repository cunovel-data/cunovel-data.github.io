Perhaps—\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know!\" Jenny cried, almost pulling him up the steep steps. \"All I know is the liquid has to be heated until steam comes from it, then Brenna breathes it, and it eases her.\"\\n\\n Royce pushed open the door to Brenna\u0027s bedchamber, and Jenny raced to her bedside, her eyes frantically searching her sister\u0027s ashen face.\\n\\n \"Jenny?\" Brenna whispered, clutching Jenny\u0027s hand, then she stopped, her body racked with violent spasms of coughing that lifted her spine clear off the bed. \"I-I\u0027m sick again,\" she gasped weakly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Jenny soothed, bending low and brushing the tangled blond curls from Brenna\u0027s forehead. \"Don\u0027t worry—\"\\n\\n Brenna\u0027s anguished eyes shifted to the threatening figure of the earl looming in the doorway. \"We have to go home,\" she told him, \"I need the\"—another siege of shrill, hacking coughing gripped her—\"need the potion!\"\\n\\n Her heart hammering in mounting fear, Jenny looked over her shoulder at Royce. \"Let her go home, please!\"\\n\\n \"Nay, I think—\"\\n\\n Beside herself with fear, Jenny let go of Brenna\u0027s hand and hurried to the doorway motioning to Royce to follow her out of the chamber. Closing the door behind her, so her words wouldn\u0027t further distress Brenna, she faced her captor, her expression desperate. \"Brenna can die from this without my aunt\u0027s aromatic. Her heart stopped beating the last time!\"\\n\\n Royce did not entirely believe the blond girl was actually in danger of death, but it was obvious Jennifer did believe it, and equally obvious that Brenna was not feigning that cough.\\n\\n Jenny saw indecision flicker across his hard features and, thinking he was about to refuse, she tried to soften him by deliberately abasing herself. \"You said I am too proud and I—I am,\" she said, laying her hand on his chest in supplication. \"If you will let Brenna go, I\u0027ll do any humble task you give me. I\u0027ll scrub the floors. I\u0027ll wait upon you—I\u0027ll cook your food in the kitchen. I swear I\u0027ll repay you in a hundred ways.\"\\n\\n Royce glanced down at the small, delicate hand laid upon his chest; heat was seeping through his tunic, desire already tightening his loins—and that with only her hand upon his chest. He didn\u0027t understand why she had such a volatile effect on him, but he understood that he wanted her—he wanted her willing and warm in his arms. And to accomplish that, he was prepared to do the first truly irrational thing in his life: he was prepared to let his most valuable hostage go—for despite Jennifer\u0027s belief that Lord Merrick was a loving—if stern—father, some of what she\u0027d said made Royce doubt that the man had any deep feelings for his \"troublesome\" daughter.\\n\\n Jenny\u0027s huge, fear-widened eyes were riveted to his face. \"Please,\" she whispered, mistaking his silence for refusal. \"I\u0027ll do anything. I\u0027ll kneel to you. Please, you have only to tell me what you want.\"\\n\\n He finally spoke and Jenny tensed with hope, too overwrought to notice the odd, meaningful note in his voice as he said, \"Anything?\"\\n\\n She nodded vigorously. \"Anything—I\u0027ll have this castle set to rights and ready to receive a king within a few weeks, I\u0027ll say prayers for you each—\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Tis not prayers I want,\" he interrupted.\\n\\n Desperate to reach an agreement before he changed his mind, she said, \"Then, tell me what it is you do want.\"\\n\\n Implacably he stated, \"You.\"\\n\\n Jennifer\u0027s hand fell away from his tunic as he continued without emotion, \"I do not want you on your knees, I want you in my bed. Willingly.\"\\n\\n Her relief that he was willing to let Brenna leave was temporarily overwhelmed by blazing animosity at what he was demanding in return.\\n\\n He was sacrificing nothing by releasing Brenna, for he would still have Jenny as hostage, yet he was requiring that she sacrifice everything. In willingly surrendering her honor to him, she would become a harlot; a disgrace to herself, her family, and all she held dear. True, she had offered herself to him once before—or nearly so—but what she had asked in return would have saved hundreds—mayhaps thousands—of lives. Lives of people she loved.\\n\\n Moreover, when she\u0027d made that offer, she\u0027d been half-dazed from his passionate kisses and caresses. Now, however, she saw with cold clarity what the results of this bargain would be.\\n\\n Behind her, Brenna\u0027s coughing rose to a terrible crescendo and Jenny shuddered with alarm; alarm for herself and her sister.\\n\\n \"Do we have a bargain?\" he asked calmly.\\n\\n Jenny lifted her small chin, looking like a proud young queen who\u0027d just been stabbed by someone she trusted. \"I was mistaken in you, my lord,\" she said bitterly. \"I credited you with honor when you said me nay two days ago—for you could have promised me what I asked, taken what I offered, and then attacked Merrick anyway. Now I see \u0027twasn\u0027t honor, but arrogance. A barbarian has no honor.\"\\n\\n Even when she knew she was vanquished, she was splendid, Royce thought, suppressing an admiring smile as he looked into her stormy blue eyes. \"Is the bargain I offer you so loathsome?\" he asked quietly, putting his hands on her stiff arms. \"In truth, I have no need to bargain with you at all, Jennifer, and you know it. I could have taken you by force any time these past days.\"\\n\\n Jennifer knew that and, although her resentment remained, she had to fight against falling under the spell of his deep voice as he continued, \"I want you, and if that makes me a barbarian in your eyes, then so be it, but it doesn\u0027t have to be that way. If you let me, I\u0027ll make it good between us. There\u0027ll be no shame nor pain for you in my bed—except pain I must cause you the first time. After that, there will be only pleasure.\"\\n\\n Coming from another knight, that speech might have been enough to sway the most sophisticated courtesan. Coming from England\u0027s most feared warrior to an unworldly, convent-bred Scottish girl, the effect was devastating. Jennifer felt blood rushing to her cheeks and a weak, trembling feeling from the pit of her stomach to her knees, as she was suddenly assaulted by memories of his heated kisses and caresses.\\n\\n \"Do we have a bargain?\" Royce asked, his long fingers sliding up and down her arms in an unconscious caress. It occurred to him he\u0027d just delivered the tenderest speech he\u0027d ever spoken to a woman. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-38.html","bookId":1848,"book":{"id":1848,"title":"A Kingdom of Dreams (Westmoreland Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: #1 bestselling author Judith McNaught dazzles with this beloved romantic classic, “one of the best ever” (Rendezvous), in which two defiant hearts clash over a furious battle of wills in a glorious age of chivalry. \\n Abducted from her convent school, headstrong Scottish beauty Jennifer Merrick does not easily surrender to Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore.
