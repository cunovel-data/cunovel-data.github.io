Royce reluctantly left his son and went over to the window, then he crossed to her bed. \"They\u0027re still praying,\" he said, looking slightly confused. \"I sent your aunt down there to tell them all is well. She must have been waylaid.\" Ruefully he added, \"Considering the way I ran from the chapel when she came to get me a few minutes ago, they aren\u0027t likely to believe her in any case.\" Smiling, Jenny raised her arms to him, and Royce understood. \"I don\u0027t want you getting cold,\" he warned, but he was already leaning down, lifting her from the bed, fur coverlet and all. A moment later, he carried her out onto the parapet. In the bailey below, the smithy pointed to the parapet and called out. The prayerful and the tearful slowly stood up, their smiling faces turned up to Jenny, and suddenly the air was split with deafening cheers. Lifting her hand in a reassuring wave, Jennifer Merrick Westmoreland looked down upon her people, and none of them found her wanting. They cheered louder as her husband lifted her higher and closer to him, and it was obvious to anyone watching that the duchess of Claymore was greatly loved by all whom she loved. Jenny was crying as she smiled back at them. After all, it\u0027s not every day a woman is given a kingdom of dreams.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-112.html","bookId":1848,"book":{"id":1848,"title":"A Kingdom of Dreams (Westmoreland Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: #1 bestselling author Judith McNaught dazzles with this beloved romantic classic, “one of the best ever” (Rendezvous), in which two defiant hearts clash over a furious battle of wills in a glorious age of chivalry.
