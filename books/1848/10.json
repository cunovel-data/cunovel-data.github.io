She also, he noticed with a start, had the softest, most inviting mouth he\u0027d ever seen and, very possibly, the bluest eyes.\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t spoken to you, or paid the slightest heed to you in years, and yet you still risk your very life to protect him from me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n There were several, truthful and safer, answers Jenny could have given, but anger and pain were numbing her brain. \"Because,\" she said flatly, \"I despise you, and I despise everything you represent.\"\\n\\n Royce stared at her, caught somewhere between fury, amazement, and admiration for her defiant courage. Short of murdering her, which would not give him the answers he sought, he was at a loss as to how to deal with her, and although strangling her held a certain appeal at the moment, it was out of the question. In any case, with Merrick\u0027s daughters his captives, it was possible Merrick might surrender without putting up a struggle. \"Get out,\" he said shortly.\\n\\n Needing no further urging to leave his hated presence, Jenny turned to flee from the tent, but the flap was down and she stopped.\\n\\n \"I said, get out!\" Royce warned ominously, and she swung around.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing I\u0027d like better, however, I can\u0027t very well walk through canvas.\"\\n\\n Wordlessly, he reached out and lifted the flap, then to her surprise he bent low in an insulting mockery of a bow. \"Your servant ma\u0027am. If there\u0027s anything at all I can do to help make your stay with us more pleasant, I hope you won\u0027t hesitate to call it to my attention.\"\\n\\n \"Untie my wrists then,\" Jenny demanded to his utter disbelief.\\n\\n \"No,\" Royce snapped. The flap dropped down, smacking her in the backside, and Jenny bolted forward in angry surprise, then let out a stifled scream when an unseen hand shot out and caught her arm, but it was merely one of the dozen guards who were posted just outside the Wolf\u0027s tent.\\n\\n By the time Jenny returned to their tent, Brenna was ashen with fright at being left alone. \"I\u0027m perfectly all right, I promise,\" Jenny reassured her as she awkwardly lowered herself to the ground.\\n\\n Chapter Four\\n\\n Fires burned at periodic intervals in the valley where the Wolfs men were still encamped that night. Standing in the open doorway of the tent, her wrists bound behind her, Jenny thoughtfully studied the activity going on all about them. \"If we\u0027re going to escape, Brenna—\" she began.\\n\\n \"Escape?\" her sister repeated, gaping. \"How in the name of the Blessed Mother can we possibly do that, Jenny?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not certain, but however we do it, we shall have to do it very soon. I heard some of the men talking outside, and they think we\u0027ll be used to force Father to surrender.\"\\n\\n \"Will he do that?\"\\n\\n Jenny bit her lip. \"I don\u0027t know. There was a time—before Alexander came to Merrick—when my kinsmen would have laid down their weapons rather than see me harmed. Now I don\u0027t matter to them.\"\\n\\n Brenna heard the catch in her sister\u0027s voice, and though she longed to comfort Jenny, she knew Alexander had so alienated clan Merrick from their young mistress that they didn\u0027t care about her any more.\\n\\n \"They do love you, however, so it\u0027s hard to know what they\u0027ll decide or how much influence Father will have on them. However, if we can escape soon, we could reach Merrick before any decision is made, which is what we must do.\"\\n\\n Of all the obstacles in their way, the one that worried Jenny most was the actual trip back to Merrick, which she estimated to be a two-day journey on horseback from here. Every hour they would be required to spend on the road was risky; bandits roamed everywhere, and two women alone were considered fair game even by honest men. The roads simply were not safe. Neither were the inns. The only safe lodgings were to be found at abbeys and priories, which was where all honest, respectable travelers chose to stay.\\n\\n \"The problem is, we don\u0027t stand a chance of escaping with our hands bound,\" Jenny continued aloud, as she gazed out at the busy camp. \"Which means we either have to convince them to untie our wrists, or else manage to escape into the woods during mealtime when we\u0027re not bound. But if we do that, our absence will be discovered as soon as they come to collect our trays before we\u0027re very far away. Still, if that\u0027s the only chance that presents itself during the next day or two, we shall very likely have to take it,\" she announced cheerfully.\\n\\n \"Once we slip into the woods, what will we do?\" Brenna asked, bravely quelling her inner terror at the thought of being alone in the woods at night.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not certain—hide somewhere, I suppose, until they give up looking for us. Or else we might be able to fool them into thinking we went east instead of north. If we could steal two of their horses, that would increase our chances of outrunning them, even if it made it more difficult to hide. The trick is to find some way to do both. We need to be able to hide and outrun them.\"\\n\\n \"How can we do that?\" Brenna asked, her forehead knotted deeply in futile thought.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but we have to try something.\" Lost in contemplation, she stared unseeing past the tall, bearded man who had stopped talking to one of his knights and was studying her intently.\\n\\n The fires had dwindled and their guard had collected their trays and retied their wrists, but still neither girl had come up with an acceptable scheme, even though they\u0027d discussed several outlandish ones. \"We can\u0027t just remain here like willing pawns to be used to his advantage,\" Jenny burst out when they were lying side by side that night. \"We must escape.\"\\n\\n \"Jenny, has it occurred to you what he might do to us when—if,\" she amended quickly, \"he catches us?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027d kill us,\" Jenny reassured her after a moment\u0027s contemplation. \"We wouldn\u0027t be any use to him as hostages if we were dead. Father would insist on seeing us before agreeing to surrender, and the earl will have to produce us—alive and breathing —or else Father will tear him to shreds,\" Jenny said, deciding it was better, less frightening, to think of him as the earl of Claymore, rather than the Wolf.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Brenna agreed and promptly fell asleep.\\n\\n But it was several hours before Jenny could relax enough to do the same, for despite her outward show of bravery and confidence, she was more frightened than she\u0027d ever been in her life. She was frightened for Brenna, for herself, and for her clan, and she hadn\u0027t the vaguest notion how to escape. She only knew they had to try. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-10.html","bookId":1848,"book":{"id":1848,"title":"A Kingdom of Dreams (Westmoreland Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: #1 bestselling author Judith McNaught dazzles with this beloved romantic classic, “one of the best ever” (Rendezvous), in which two defiant hearts clash over a furious battle of wills in a glorious age of chivalry. \\n Abducted from her convent school, headstrong Scottish beauty Jennifer Merrick does not easily surrender to Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore.
