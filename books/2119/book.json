{"id":2119,"title":"Armor","description":"Storyline: \n Armor is, I believe, my favorite science fiction novel ever. It follows to basic plotlines -- one is the story of a desperate soldier fighting an impossible war, the other from the point of view of an ex-pirate escaped from prison who joined up with the wrong crew. The two plots do intertwine, but the plots aren\u0027t the appeal of this novel.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/armor.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":33,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
