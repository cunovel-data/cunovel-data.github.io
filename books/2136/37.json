I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the desperate look in Tara\u0027s eyes, even as she was compelled to say the words that came out of her mouth at the end, even as she was compelled to get up and leave.\n I shuddered as my cell phone rang.\n Secure line. Detective Sherbet, no doubt. I picked up immediately.\n \"Sam, it\u0027s Sherbet.\"\n \"I would never have guessed.\"\n \"No jokes, Sam.

I\u0027m here at Kingsley\u0027s home, if you want to call it that - \"\n \"What happened, Detective?\"\n \"A neighbor reported the break-in.\n Nothing was stolen, as far as we know.\"\n He paused. \"But they really weren\u0027t looking to steal anything, were they, Sam?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said.\n \"What were they looking for, Samantha?

Frankie or whatever his name is, claimed to have seen someone lurking outside Kingsley\u0027s house this morning - \"\n \"Shit.\"\n \"Sam, what the devil is going on?\"\n I gave him a glimpse of my thoughts, even long distance, and I sensed him shaking his head. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" he said.\n \"No.\"\n \"That\u0027s some weird shit.\"\n \"Detective, I think it\u0027s important that you take my kids somewhere else.\"\n \"Where?\"\n I thought hard about that. \"Somewhere I don\u0027t know. Somewhere safe.\"\n \"Somewhere you don\u0027t know? What the devil are you...\" And then Sherbet, the only other human being besides Allison who was privy to my thoughts, finally caught on. \"I understand. I mean, I really don\u0027t understand. In fact, I\u0027m fairly certain I\u0027m going batshit crazy. But, yeah, I think I understand.\"\n \"You do?\" I said urgently.\n \"Yeah, you don\u0027t want me to tell you where I\u0027m taking the kids because...\" he paused, no doubt searching for words.\n \"Yes,\" I said, finishing for him, \"because the thing inside me is listening.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-37.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Moon Island \n (Vampire for Hire #7) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
