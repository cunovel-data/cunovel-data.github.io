But it didn\u0027t, try as it might. Instead it tugged and pulled at me like an angry thing, as I remained seated and focused.\n My eyes were closed tight; my hands rested on my knees.\n The wind thundered over my exposed ears. Yes, my hood was down. I didn\u0027t want any barrier between me and God. I breathed in and out, slowly. Now, the wind blew even harder, rocking me further and, in the far distance, I heard the pounding of the surf against the rock cliffs.\n I continued breathing, slowly, deliberately, deeply.\n It took a minute or two of focused concentration, but soon enough, I felt a sensation of rising up, as if I\u0027d entered a tube of some sort. A glass tube, because in my mind\u0027s eye I could see myself rising up. But, interestingly, not so much rising above the earth. No. Instead, I sensed myself rising up through what appeared to be levels.\n Dimensions.\n How I knew this, I didn\u0027t know. But the word felt right. Yes, I was rising up through the dimensions, even as the rain hit me full in the face. The sensation of being wet and cold seemed to be happening to someone else. Certainly not me...after all, I was rising, rising.\n Rising...\n The dimensions swept past me. On many of them I sensed entities, or beings, watching me, observing me while I came and went. Spiritual beings, I knew, highly evolved beings that existed in realms that we, as humans, could not comprehend...and yet, I sped past even them.\n Higher and higher.\n Until...\n I was back. Not above the Earth, or even above the Universe. I was outside of the Universe. Outside of space and time. I was observing creation as God would have. As God did so now.\n Welcome back, Samantha Moon, came a thought deep inside my head. No, not exactly in my head. All around me, vibrating through me.\n I sensed that I existed in the space between space, and it was a concept that was difficult for me to understand.\n You are doing fine, Samantha Moon.\n Thank you. You are doing fine, too, from what I can gather.\n There was a gentle laugh inside me.\n Kind of you to say, Sam. Do you mind if I call you Sam?\n You\u0027re God, you can call me anything you want.\n More gentle laughter. God, I was discovering, had a nice sense of humor. I understand that you think that, Sam. But I am, more accurately, the Source.\n Source?\n The Source of life in this universe.\n I see, I thought. I think. That\u0027s still pretty much God to me.\n I will not argue the point, Sam.\n Either way, it\u0027s a pleasure to have your company.\n I sensed the vastness, the emptiness, the peace.\n Do you ever feel lonely out here? I asked.\n Your question implies that I might find myself alone.\n Well, yes, I guess. Are there many others like you? Other Sources?\n There are a handful of us, yes.\n How many?\n Twelve, to be exact.\n And from where do the twelve originate?\n Exactly that, Sam. From the Origin.\n And what, exactly, is the Origin? My Creator.\n I see, I thought. And you are my Creator?\n You are my creation, yes.\n And what do the other twelve Sources do?\n They watch over their own multiverses, of course.\n Of course. And why did the Origin create twelve of you?\n To learn more about itself.\n And why did you create me?\n So that I can learn more about myself.\n And thus, what? Report back to the Origin? I asked.\n You are correct, Sam.\n I thought about this as the rain and wind pummeled my physical body a universe away, as I gazed out over the slowly-moving cosmos that rotated around a galactic center of some sort.\n That\u0027s pretty heavy, I thought.\n It\u0027s as heavy or light as you want it to be. But, yes, I understand that these are new concepts for you in the physical world.\n Is there evil? I asked suddenly.\n There is the potential for others to show you the opposite of light, yes.\n I had a sudden insight, sudden clarity. I wondered if this insight came from the Source.\n The darkness is necessary to appreciate the light, I said.\n Well said, Sam.\n Can darkness ever destroy light?\n There was a slight pause before the voice vibrated through my being again: Remember this always, Sam: A small match can illuminate the darkest room.\n I got the meaning and felt myself nod way, way back there on that rock dome, high above Skull Island.\n So, I should never fear darkness, I thought.\n Live in light, Samantha, but acknowledge the darkness.\n For without darkness, there cannot be light.\n Very good, Sam.\n Is there a Devil? I asked suddenly.\n There was a long pause. You are asking if there is an entity that delights in causing mischief, who tortures souls for all eternity, who causes the good to falter, and the bad to be worse?\n Well, yes.\n No, Sam. No such entity exists.\n I nodded. Perhaps here in space, or perhaps back on the dome, I said, I have a question about a group of beings I have come across, one such being is, in fact, residing within me, and undoubtedly hearing this very conversation.\n Maybe she needs to hear this conversation, Samantha. Maybe you are her answer, too.\n I don\u0027t understand.\n Maybe you are her way back to the life.\n I never thought of that. I paused, formulating my thoughts. I feel she is evil.\n She - and others like her - have certainly made choices that might appear evil.\n But they are not evil? I asked.\n They operate out of fear, Sam. Fear of moving on, fear of giving up power, fear of retribution. They are, quite simply, misinformed.\n Misinformed about what?\n That life is eternal, that I am eternal.\n That they are eternal. That power is temporary, that love is everlasting.\n Lightning flashed in the heavens above...until I realized that it had flashed directly above my body. I was about to ask another question, until I felt myself slipping back...or down through the dimensions. As I slipped down, down, God\u0027s words sang through me and around me.\n Love is everlasting.\n I opened my eyes and looked out over stormy seas and wondered again if I\u0027d completely lost my mind. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-34.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Moon Island \n (Vampire for Hire #7) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
