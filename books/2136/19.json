I might have gained a lot of gifts since becoming the thing that I am, but one of them, apparently, was not the ability to see into fog.\\n\\n I was sitting at the edge of a small cliff. Waves crashed thirty feet or so below. Some of the spray reached me, sprinkling my skin and lips. I didn\u0027t lick my lips. Even salt spray would upset my stomach.\\n\\n The path from the house was a well- maintained one, as I suspected this cliff side retreat was a favorite hangout for the family. During the daytime, I was sure one could see for miles and miles. Now, not so much, even to my eyes.\\n\\n To say that the conversation with Edwin had shaken me was an understatement.\\n\\n His sister?\\n\\n Obviously, not a Thurman sister, for I hadn\u0027t been talking to the real Edwin Thurman. No, I had been talking to something ancient and evil. Another dark master who sought entry back into our world.\\n\\n And not just any dark master, I suspected.\\n\\n No, he didn\u0027t have to hide in the shadows of the living, like that which had entered Kingsley and me...and now Fang.\\n\\n No, whoever he was, he had taken over the real Edwin Thurman - completely and totally.\\n\\n Who he was, I didn\u0027t know. But he was powerful.\\n\\n Perhaps even the most powerful of all.\\n\\n And his sister was in me.\\n\\n Jesus.\\n\\n I suddenly wished I wasn\u0027t sitting on the cliff\u0027s edge, in the cold and rain and wind, but sleeping with my kids, one on either side of me, their warm bodies giving me warmth in return. I could almost smell Tammy\u0027s hair. I could almost even smell Anthony\u0027s stinky feet.\\n\\n As the wind and rain picked up, drenching me to the bone, I did the only thing this middle-aged divorcee mother of two could do: I took off my clothes.\\n\\n And stepped to the edge of the cliff.\\n\\n I summoned the single flame in my thoughts.\\n\\n Held it.\\n\\n Saw the image of the beast.\\n\\n The beast I would become.\\n\\n And then I leaped out as far and wide as I could, arching up and over the pounding surf.\\n\\n The transformation was instant, taking hold of me before I plunged into the rocks below.\\n\\n I was soon flying. High above the island. High above the fog. High above, even, the snoring Allison.\\n\\n It was up here where I found my sanctuary, my peace, my escape. I was all too aware that it was the thing that lived within me that gave me this very ability.\\n\\n The thing I could never escape.\\n\\n We\u0027ll see, I thought, and began flapping my wings.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-19.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island \\n (Vampire for Hire #7) \\n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
