She\u0027d brought a bottle of wine with her, of which we were all partaking. Some of us more vigorously than others.\\n\\n \"I think they bought it,\" said Allison, pouring herself yet another glass of wine.\\n\\n \"Tell me more about Edwin,\" I said to Tara.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s Junior\u0027s only son.\"\\n\\n \"Your cousin,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Right.\" Outside, rain slapped against the bungalow\u0027s windows. Tree branches groaned overhead, as the bungalows were closer to the surrounding forest. \"He was never much interested in the family\u0027s business.\"\\n\\n \"But I bet he\u0027s interested in the family money,\" said Allison, laughing. \"Oops, sorry. Was that inappropriate?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Tara. \"Of course not. You guys are here to find answers to my grandfather\u0027s death. I\u0027m not sure, at this point, if anything could be inappropriate, or if I would even care. And to answer your question...I\u0027m not so sure about his desire for money.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"He lives fairly simply. In fact, he often lives here.\"\\n\\n \"Living here isn\u0027t living simply,\" said Allison.\\n\\n \"True, but even while he\u0027s here, he lives simply. In fact, he prefers sleeping in the basement. On a cot, of all things.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s here a lot?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Often. In fact, he\u0027s rarely not here.\"\\n\\n \"What does he do here?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, as far as anyone knows.\"\\n\\n \"How did he take your grandfather\u0027s death?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the strange part,\" said Tara, looking up from her glass. \"He didn\u0027t seem to take it hard at all.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I mean just that. He didn\u0027t appear overly distraught.\"\\n\\n \"No tears?\" asked Allison, piping in.\\n\\n \"None that I saw.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a room in the basement?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of course, but it\u0027s so cold down there. Drafty. Miserable.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe he just wants to stay out of the way,\" said Allison. \"You know, since he\u0027s here all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" said Tara.\\n\\n Or maybe the cold doesn\u0027t bother him, I thought, sending it over to Allison.\\n\\n A vampire? she thought back.\\n\\n Yes. I thought. I think. I can see his aura, so that\u0027s a problem.\\n\\n Problem, why?\\n\\n I can\u0027t see vampires\u0027 auras.\\n\\n Gotcha. So, is that why you had me shield my thoughts back at dinner? I nodded and turned my attention back to Tara. \"Were you here on the night of your grandfather\u0027s death?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"We all were.\"\\n\\n Tara next asked Allison for some more wine, who was only too willing to comply, and shortly, my friend and witness were both gone for the night.\\n\\n I sighed, and made notes in my case file, all while the girls giggled and talked and got drunker and drunker. I made a mental note to fire Allison.\\n\\n Rhetorically, of course. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-16.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island \\n (Vampire for Hire #7) \\n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
