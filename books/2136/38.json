I began pacing in the bungalow. Who had come to my house? Who was outside of Kingsley\u0027s house? Why did they want my kids?\n \"I think we know who,\" said Allison, somehow following my frantic thoughts.\n \"I\u0027m certain the Thurman clan reaches far and wide.\"\n I sat on the arm of the leather sofa, ran both hands through my hair. My too-thick hair. Never was my hair this thick when I was mortal.\n \"He controls them all,\" continued Allison, \"anyone with a drop of Thurman blood.\"\n \"Jesus,\" I said. \"So how do we stop him?\"\n \"That,\" said Allison, \"is why you make the big bucks.\"\n \"Great,\" I said, and thought again about the image I\u0027d received from Tara: that of her and Edwin digging on the north side of the island.\n \"A good place to start,\" said Allison, following along. \"Except if she doesn\u0027t even know what they\u0027re digging for, what makes you think we would know?\"\n \"That,\" I said, \"is why they invented the Internet.\"\n \"I thought they invented the Internet for porn?\"\n \"That, too,\" I said. \"Grab your laptop, and let\u0027s see what we can find.\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" said my new friend, and did just that.\n * * *\n It didn\u0027t take us long to find something.\n \"A shipwreck,\" said Allison, pointing to screen. \"Over a hundred years ago, right off the north side of Skull Island.\n Okay, we are definitely venturing into Scooby-Doo territory here.\"\n \"Except Scooby-Doo and the gang didn\u0027t deal with a body-jumping demon who\u0027s after me and my kids. Read the article.\"\n She did.\n In 1896, a shipping vessel hit rough waters just north of Skull Island. Most of the crew of fifteen survived, except for the captain who went down, proverbially, with the ship. The remaining fourteen crew members, via life rafts, eventually washed up onto Skull Island, where they were soon rescued.\n \"Weird and cool all rolled into one,\"\n said Allison. \"But I don\u0027t see how that helps us.\"\n I didn\u0027t see it either. \"What\u0027s the name of the historian quoted in the article?\"\n \"Abraham Gunthrie, college professor from Western Washington University in a city called Bellingham.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Bellingham?\"\n She brought up the city and college on Google Maps. Bellingham was north of here, about an hour away as the eagle flies. Or, in my case, as the giant vampire bat flies. I bumped Allison rudely out of her seat and, while she protested and rubbed her bruised hip, I brought up one of my proprietary websites and entered in my username and password. A few clicks later and I had the information I needed.\n The professor\u0027s home address.\n \"That\u0027s kinda scary how fast you can do that.\"\n \"I use my powers for good,\" I said.\n \"Mostly.\"\n \"You do realize that the storm is even worse. No one is leaving or coming to the island.\"\n \"Not everyone,\" I said. I logged off the site, got up and began packing myself a weatherproof bag. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-38.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Moon Island \n (Vampire for Hire #7) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
