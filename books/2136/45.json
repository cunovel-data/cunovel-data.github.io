Once inside, as our breaths echoed - well, Kingsley\u0027s and Allison\u0027s breaths echoed - I pulled down my hood and asked Allison if she was doing okay.\n \"Just cold,\" she said. She smiled at me faintly, her mind still closed off.\n To me, she looked...distracted. And was blinking far too much. Perhaps she\u0027d caught a cold.\n Perhaps.\n It was then that my inner alarm began sounding...as always a steady buzz just inside my ear. I looked again at Allison and she again smiled sweetly at me.\n \"Well, now what?\" asked Kingsley, hands on his hips and dripping everywhere. His big cartoon feet were buried in the soft sand inside the tunnel.\n \"Here,\" said Allison, pointing. She\u0027d brought her cell phone and was now using its flashlight app.\n I didn\u0027t need a smart phone flashlight app to see in the dark, and neither did Kingsley, but we were polite enough. She aimed the light toward the back of the deep cave, and revealed something that none of us were too surprised to see: digging tools. Shovels and picks and strainers. It looked like a looter\u0027s hangout.\n Rocks were piled up back there, too, many of which had been moved. Yes, someone was looking for something here, and, by all appearances, had been doing so for quite some time.\n Kingsley inspected the area with Allison. I didn\u0027t. Instead, I closed my eyes and did my best to block out their voices, which seemed to echo everywhere at once. I kept my eyes closed and turned in a small circle. I lowered my hands and opened my palms. I breathed deeply, slowly, focusing.\n Focusing...\n Focusing on the medallion, as if it existed, as if it really could be here in the tunnel.\n I didn\u0027t know how to find something that was hidden. After all, I\u0027d only stumbled upon the second medallion in old Charlie\u0027s mobile home quite by accident. Back then, I had closed my eyes, like I was doing now, and the medallion just appeared to me, without effort - I gasped.\n There it was.\n Burning in my mind\u0027s eye.\n Clearly.\n And it wasn\u0027t that far away.\n Except, of course, it most certainly wasn\u0027t in the tunnel.\n I opened my eyes and headed out of the cave...and toward the crashing surf. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-45.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Moon Island \n (Vampire for Hire #7) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
