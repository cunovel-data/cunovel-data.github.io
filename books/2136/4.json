I\u0027m kinda psychic, you know. Not the full- blown type, but I think spending time with all of you vampires has sort of rubbed off on me.\"\n I had met Allison on my last case, the girlfriend of another boxer. A murdered boxer. Allison and I had shared a...moment. A highly unusually moment.\n Two moments, in fact, I thought.\n She and I had connected, or bonded instantly. She had quickly seen through my fa\u0026ccedil;ade, having dated a vampire herself.\n And the next thing I knew, she was allowing me to drink from a wound in her hand. A wound that had quickly healed once I was done drinking.\n My life is so weird.\n We\u0027d talked often since, although we had yet to meet again. She had quickly become like an old girlfriend to me. A sister.\n A blood sister.\n \"Yes, I\u0027m going on a trip,\" I said, now reaching for some jeans in my closet, cradling the phone against my shoulder and ear.\n \"See? I knew you were going on a trip.\n I\u0027m coming with you.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re not.\"\n \"Yes, I am, Sam. You need me.\"\n \"Need you how?\"\n \"This is a business trip, no?\"\n \"Yes, but - \"\n \"I sense very strongly that you are going to need my help, if you know what I mean.\"\n Actually, I did know what she meant. I stopped reaching for my jeans as I stood there in front of my open closet. A closet, I might add, that was quickly filling up with clothes. Now that I could actually go into the light of day, I needed a whole new wardrobe, right? Like that tank top I had just dropped in the suitcase. Many cute tank tops, in fact. And shorts. And sandals.\n Allison was, of course, referring to fresh human blood - fresh, as in, straight from the source. A living, human source.\n Such blood energized me unlike anything I\u0027d ever had before. Yes, I\u0027d had human blood - but never hemoglobin straight from a willing source.\n And Allison had been very, very willing. Apparently, she loved the experience.\n I said, \"I don\u0027t think my client will allow you to come.\"\n \"Say I\u0027m your assistant.\"\n \"I doubt she\u0027ll - \"\n \"She will, Sam. Trust me. And trust me when I say you will need me. I\u0027m here now at the airport.\"\n I think my mouth dropped. Correction, I know my mouth dropped open. \"What airport?\"\n \"LAX. The 4:40 flight. Lucky for me they had one seat left.\"\n \"Let me guess...\" I said.\n \"Row 17, Seat C.\"\n I glanced down at my ticket next to my suitcase. Row 17, Seat B.\"\n \"You\u0027re freaking me out,\" I said.\n \"I get that a lot,\" she said. \"Now, chop-chop.\"\n And with that, she hung up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-4.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Moon Island \n (Vampire for Hire #7) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
