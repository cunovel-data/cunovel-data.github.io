Tammy snorted. \"Don\u0027t lie to us, Mom. I read Auntie Louie\u0027s mind. She\u0027s totally freaked out right now.\" I rubbed my forehead and shook my head. It was, after all, impossible to keep anything away from my kids these days. The truth was, I didn\u0027t know what, exactly, I was keeping away from them. Only that I needed them somewhere safe. And fast. I told Tammy to give the phone to her brother and she did. I told Anthony, who was now almost as tall as his sister - his recent growth spurt was alarming, to say the least - that it was his job to protect her. \"I\u0027m on it, Mommy,\" he said. \"If I have to.\" \"You have to.\" \"She\u0027s kind of a butthead, though.\" \"Butthead or not, she\u0027s still your sister.\" \"My ugly sister, you mean.\" \"I love you guys,\" I said, suddenly choked up. God, I even missed their bickering. \"We know, Mommy. You say it all the time. Sheesh.\" \"Because it\u0027s true,\" I said, drying my eyes. \"But it\u0027s embarrrrrassing.\" \"Maybe so, but you need to hear it.\" He sighed loudly. \"Fine.\" \"Well?\" I asked. \"Well what?\" \"You know what I need,\" I said. He sighed again, and, ever so softly, whispered, \"I guess I love you, too, Mommy.\" I would have laughed if the tears didn\u0027t come to my eyes again. He added, \"Don\u0027t let the bad guys get you, Mommy.\" \"I won\u0027t, baby.\" \"Bye, Mommy.\" And he hung up...and I wiped the tears from my cheeks, and took a deep breath and set my jaw. I had been clenching my hands so tight that my sharp nails had punctured my palms. I opened my hands and watched the small wounds heal before my eyes. Whoever this motherfucker was, Devil or no Devil, he was not going to hurt my kids, and he sure as hell wasn\u0027t going to keep me from seeing them, again. Whoever the hell he was.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-31.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7) Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
