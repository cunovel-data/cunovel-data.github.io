The bottom corner of the phone\u0027s screen was already cracked from my last conversation with Danny.\\n\\n \"Remember,\" she said. \"He\u0027s a total pig.\"\\n\\n \"And that,\" I said, getting up, \"is why I keep you around.\"\\n\\n \"You keep me around?\" said Allison, grabbing her plate of unfinished eggs and hurrying after me. \"Maybe it\u0027s the other way around. Maybe I keep you around.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said, and picked up my pace.\\n\\n \"Hey, where are we going?\"\\n\\n I opened the French door that led from the balcony into the magnificent kitchen. I looked back at her. \"We\u0027re looking for a killer, remember?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I think we found him.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe not.\"\\n\\n \"So, where are we going?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got some investigator stuff to do.\"\\n\\n \"And what am I supposed to do?\"\\n\\n I motioned to the others who were still sitting outside on the deck, enjoying what was, I suspected, rare sunshine. Indeed, storm clouds were already gathering on the far horizon. And if I wasn\u0027t mistaken, they looked even nastier than the ones from yesterday.\\n\\n \"Do what you do best,\" I said. \"Talk.\"\\n\\n \"Gee, thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Mingle. Get me the lowdown. Let me know who sets off your own inner alarm system.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth to say something else, but I shooed her back outside. She pouted a moment or two, then stuck out her tongue and headed back out onto the deck.\\n\\n I paused in the kitchen, closed my eyes, and mentally searched the home again. I saw everyone, even Edwin asleep on his cot in the basement. One person was still noticeably absent: Tara. Perhaps she was out of my range.\\n\\n So, I zeroed in on the one person I was looking for, and headed off.\\n\\n Deeper into the massive home.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-22.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island \\n (Vampire for Hire #7) \\n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
