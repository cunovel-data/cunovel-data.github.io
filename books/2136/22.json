The bottom corner of the phone\u0027s screen was already cracked from my last conversation with Danny. \"Remember,\" she said. \"He\u0027s a total pig.\" \"And that,\" I said, getting up, \"is why I keep you around.\" \"You keep me around?\" said Allison, grabbing her plate of unfinished eggs and hurrying after me. \"Maybe it\u0027s the other way around. Maybe I keep you around.\" \"Sure,\" I said, and picked up my pace. \"Hey, where are we going?\" I opened the French door that led from the balcony into the magnificent kitchen. I looked back at her. \"We\u0027re looking for a killer, remember?\" \"Well, I think we found him.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe not.\" \"So, where are we going?\" \"I\u0027ve got some investigator stuff to do.\" \"And what am I supposed to do?\" I motioned to the others who were still sitting outside on the deck, enjoying what was, I suspected, rare sunshine. Indeed, storm clouds were already gathering on the far horizon. And if I wasn\u0027t mistaken, they looked even nastier than the ones from yesterday. \"Do what you do best,\" I said. \"Talk.\" \"Gee, thanks.\" \"Mingle. Get me the lowdown. Let me know who sets off your own inner alarm system.\" She opened her mouth to say something else, but I shooed her back outside. She pouted a moment or two, then stuck out her tongue and headed back out onto the deck. I paused in the kitchen, closed my eyes, and mentally searched the home again. I saw everyone, even Edwin asleep on his cot in the basement. One person was still noticeably absent: Tara. Perhaps she was out of my range. So, I zeroed in on the one person I was looking for, and headed off. Deeper into the massive home.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-22.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7) Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
