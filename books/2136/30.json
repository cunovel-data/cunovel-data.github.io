The bedroom was small, with a single window to my right that looked out towards the woods beyond. The curtains were open and I watched the rain slanting sideways. They looked like blow-darts from an army of elves. Or, much more likely, I was losing my friggin\u0027 mind. Did he say the Devil? As in Satan? I got up and paced and thought about what I had to do, thought even longer about what I should say to my sister, and then made the call. She picked up on the third ring. \"How\u0027s the trip, Sam - \" \"Something\u0027s wrong.\" \"What? Is everything okay?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Sam, what\u0027s going on?\" \"That\u0027s the problem, Mary Lou, I don\u0027t know, but I think the kids might be in danger. And you, for that matter.\" \"You\u0027re joking.\" \"No joke, Mary Lou.\" \"You\u0027re being serious?\" \"Sweetie, I am. More than I ever have before.

I just spoke to Kingsley and he echoed the same feeling.\" \"Someone might hurt Tammy and Anthony?\" The gut-wrenching feeling gripped me again, tearing at me from the inside. I didn\u0027t know if this was a psychic hit or a mother\u0027s intuition. \"I think so, yes.\" \"Jesus, Sam. Should I call the police?\" I thought about that, too, then told her to give Detective Sherbet a call at the Fullerton Police Department. To let him know my concerns and where she would be with the kids. She digested that last part. \"You want us to stay at Kingsley\u0027s house?\" \"Yes.\" \"With his butler?\" \"He\u0027s more than a butler.\" \"Sam, I\u0027m scared.\" \"So am I.\" \"What will you do?\" I took in a lot of air and said, \"I have no clue.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-30.html","bookId":2136,"book":{"id":2136,"title":"Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7)","description":"Storyline: Moon Island (Vampire for Hire #7) Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
