{"id":41805,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. UNCLE JACOB RECEIVES HIS WALKING PAPERS.","content":"Squire Marlowe returned to the breakfast room, wearing rather an embarrassed expression. Percy had followed his mother, and the old man found himself for a short time alone. There was a twinkle of amusement in his eyes, which vanished on the reappearance of his nephew. \"I am sorry to have left you alone, Uncle Jacob,\" said the squire, civilly. \"Oh, don\u0027t treat me with any ceremony, Albert. Being as we are such near relations, we ought to be free and easy like.\"32 \"I am glad to hear you say so, for I shall be obliged to treat you unceremoniously.\" \"Eh?\" said Uncle Jacob, inquiringly. \"I regret to say that my wife, who is of a very delicate organization, is taken suddenly ill, and I am afraid I shall have to ask you to cut your visit short, and come again some other time.\" \"I\u0027m surprised to hear that, Albert. I thought Mrs. Marlowe looked in excellent health.\" \"You can\u0027t always tell by outward appearances. She is subject to severe headaches, and in that condition can\u0027t bear the least noise or excitement. That is why I can\u0027t invite you to stay any longer.\" \"I understand,\" said Uncle Jacob, with—it might have been—a little significance in his tone. \"I have no doubt,\" went on the squire, \"that Mrs. Barton will be glad to have you pay her a short visit. I will get Percy to drive you down there.\" \"Thank you,\" answered the old man, dryly, \"but it\u0027s only a little way, and I don\u0027t mind walking.\" \"Just as you prefer,\" said the squire, relieved by Uncle Jacob\u0027s declination of his of33fer, for he knew that Percy would not enjoy the trip. \"I\u0027ll get ready to go at once, Albert. Oh, about my plan of opening a cigar store in Lakeville?\" \"I cannot advise you to do it,\" rejoined the squire, hastily. \"You wouldn\u0027t make enough to pay your rent, or not much more.\" \"Don\u0027t the men in your factory smoke? There\u0027s a good many of them. If I could get their trade——\" \"They smoke pipes for the most part,\" said the squire, hurriedly. \"They\u0027d find cigars too expensive.\" \"I meant to combine candy with cigars. That would be a help.\" \"They keep candy at the grocery store, Uncle Jacob.\" \"I see there isn\u0027t much show for me. Now if I only understood your business, you could give me something to do in the factory, Albert.\" \"But you don\u0027t, and, in fact, Uncle Jacob, it\u0027s too hard work for a man of your age.\" \"Then what would you advise me to do, Albert?\" asked the old man, earnestly. Squire Marlowe assumed a thoughtful look. In fact, he was puzzled to decide how best to get rid of the troublesome old man. To have34 him remain in Lakeville was not to be thought of. He would gladly have got rid of Mrs. Barton and her son, whose relationship to his family was unfortunately known, but there seemed to be no way clear to that without the expenditure of money. To have Uncle Jacob for a neighbor, in addition, would be a source of mortification, not only to himself, but even more to his wife and Percy, whose aristocratic ideas he well knew. \"I think you told me you had five hundred dollars,\" he said, after a pause. \"About that.\" \"Then I really think it would be the best thing you could do to go back to California, where you are known, and where you can doubtless obtain some humble employment which will supply your moderate wants. It won\u0027t cost you much for dress——\" \"No, Albert; this coat and vest will do me for best five years longer.\" \"Just so! That is fortunate. So you see you\u0027ve only got your board to pay.\" \"I might get sick,\" suggested Uncle Jacob, doubtfully. \"You look pretty healthy. Besides, you\u0027ll have part of your five hundred dollars left, you know.\" \"That\u0027s so! What a good calculator you35 are, Albert! Besides, if things came to the worst, there\u0027s that five hundred dollars I lent your father twenty-seven years ago. No doubt you\u0027d pay me back, and——\" \"I don\u0027t know what you refer to,\" said Squire Marlowe, coldly. \"Surely you haven\u0027t forgot the time when your father was so driven for money, when you were a lad of fifteen, and I let him have all I had except about fifty dollars that I kept for a rainy day.\" \"This is news to me, Uncle Jacob,\" said the squire, with a chilling frown. \"You must excuse me for saying that I think you labor under a delusion.\" Uncle Jacob surveyed his neighbor intently, with a gaze which disconcerted him in spite of his assurance. \"Fortunately, I am able to prove what I say,\" he rejoined, after a slight pause. He drew from his pocket a wallet which bore the signs of long wear, and, opening it, deliberately drew out a folded sheet of note paper, grown yellow with age and brittle with much handling. Then, adjusting his spectacles, he added: \"Here\u0027s something I\u0027d like to read to you, Albert. It\u0027s written by your father:36 My Dear Jacob: I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for lending me the five hundred dollars I so urgently need. I know it is very nearly, if not quite, all you possess in the world, and that you can ill spare it. It will save me from failure, and sometime I hope to repay it to you. If I cannot, I will ask my son Albert to do so when he is able. I don\u0027t want you to lose by your kindness to me. Your affectionate brother, Charles Marlowe. \"You can see the signature, Albert. You know your father\u0027s handwriting, don\u0027t you?\" Squire Marlowe reluctantly took the paper and glanced at it. \"It may be my father\u0027s writing,\" he said. \"May be!\" repeated the old man, indignantly. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"I dare say it is. In fact, I remember his mentioning the matter to me before he died.\" \"What did he say?\" \"That it was quite a favor to him, the loan, but that he repaid it within three years from the time he received it.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Uncle Jacob, pushing his spectacles up, in his amazement. \"Your father said that?\"37 \"Yes, he did,\" answered Albert Marlowe, with unabashed effrontery. \"That he paid back the five hundred dollars I lent him?\" \"That\u0027s what I said,\" repeated the squire, impatiently. \"Then it\u0027s a lie—not of my brother\u0027s, but of—somebody\u0027s. That money remains unpaid to this day.\" Squire Marlowe shrugged his shoulders. \"No doubt you think so,\" he said, \"but you are growing old, and old people are forgetful. That is the most charitable view to take of your statement.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have believed this, Albert,\" said the old man, sorrowfully. \"And you a rich man, too! I don\u0027t mind the money. I can get along without it. But to be told that I am claiming what has already been repaid!\" \"I don\u0027t lay it up against you,\" went on the squire, smoothly. \"I\u0027ve no doubt you have forgotten the payment of the debt, and——\" \"I don\u0027t forget so easily, though I am sixty-five. Don\u0027t fear that I shall ask for it again—indeed, I haven\u0027t asked for it at all—but I shall not forget how you have treated my claim. Of course it amounts to nothing in law—it\u0027s outlawed long ago—but I only wish38 my poor brother were alive to disprove your words.\" Even Albert Marlowe was shamed by the old man\u0027s sorrowful dignity. \"We can\u0027t agree about that, Uncle Jacob,\" he said; \"but if ever you get very hard up, let me know, and I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t help you—in a small way.\" \"You are very kind,\" answered the old man, \"but I don\u0027t think that time will come. As you say, my wants are few, and I am still able to work. I\u0027ll go up to my room and get my valise, and then I\u0027ll go over to Mary Barton\u0027s.\" \"Thank Heaven! I\u0027ve got rid of him,\" mused the squire, as from the doorway he saw Uncle Jacob walking slowly down the street. \"I was afraid he\u0027d mention that money he lent father. With twenty-seven years\u0027 interest it would amount to a good deal of money—more than I could well spare. I don\u0027t think I shall hear from it again.\" \"Has he gone, Albert?\" asked Mrs. Marlowe, returning to the breakfast-room. \"Yes; I told him you were indisposed, and couldn\u0027t stand excitement.\" \"No matter what you told him, as long as we are rid of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81629.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
