{"id":41803,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. A VISIT TO THE FACTORY.","content":"During dinner the old man chatted away in the frankest manner, but not a word did he let drop as to his worldly circumstances. He appeared to enjoy his dinner, and showed himself entirely at his ease.17 \"I\u0027m glad to see you so well fixed, Albert,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve got a fine home.\" \"It will do very well,\" returned the squire, modestly. \"I suppose he never was in such a good house before,\" thought Mrs. Marlowe. \"By the way, just before I fell in with you here,\" went on Jacob, \"I ran across Mary\u0027s boy.\" \"Herbert Barton?\" suggested the squire, with a slight frown. \"Yes; he said that was his name.\" \"They live in the village,\" said his nephew, shortly. \"They\u0027re poor, ain\u0027t they?\" \"Yes; Barton was not a forehanded man. He didn\u0027t know how to accumulate money.\" \"I suppose he left very little to his widow.\" \"Very little. However, I have given the boy a place in my factory, and I believe his mother earns a trifle by covering base-balls. They don\u0027t want for anything—that is, anything in reason. \"Bert Barton seems a likely boy.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s as good as the average of boys in his position.\" \"I suppose he and Percy are quite intimate, being cousins.\" \"Indeed we are not!\" returned Percy, toss18ing his head. \"His position is very different from mine.\" Uncle Jacob surveyed Percy in innocent wonder. \"Still, he\u0027s kin to you,\" he observed. \"That doesn\u0027t always count,\" said Percy. \"He has his friends, and I have mine. I don\u0027t believe in mixing classes.\" \"I expect things have changed since I was a boy,\" said Uncle Jacob, mildly. \"Then, all the boys were friendly and sociable, no matter whether they were rich or poor.\" \"I agree with Percy,\" broke in Mrs. Marlowe, stiffly. \"His position in life will be very different from that of the boy you refer to. Any early intimacy, even if we encouraged it, could not well be kept up in after-life.\" \"Perhaps you are right,\" said the old man. \"I\u0027ve been away so long at the mines that I haven\u0027t kept up with the age or the fashions.\" Percy smiled, as his glance rested on his uncle\u0027s creased suit, and he felt quite ready to agree with what he said. \"I was thinkin\u0027 how pleasant it would be if you would invite Mary and her boy to tea—we are all related, you know. We could talk over old times and scenes, and have a real social time.\"19 Mrs. Marlowe seemed horror-struck at the suggestion. \"I don\u0027t think it would be convenient,\" she said, coldly. \"It would be better for you to see Mrs. Barton at her own house,\" put in the squire, hastily. \"Well, perhaps it would.\" \"By the way, Uncle Jacob, I hope your experiences of California are pleasant,\" insinuated Squire Marlowe. \"They\u0027re mixed, Albert. I\u0027ve had my ups and downs.\" \"I have heard of large fortunes being made there,\" pursued the squire. \"I suppose there\u0027s some truth in what we hear?\" \"To be sure! Why, ten years from the time I went to the mines I had a hundred thousand dollars deposited to my credit in a Sacramento bank.\" Squire Marlowe\u0027s eyes sparkled with pleasure. It was just what he had been hoping to find out. So Uncle Jacob was rich, after all! The squire\u0027s manner became even more gracious, and he pressed upon his relative another plate of ice cream. \"No, thank you, Albert,\" said the old man. \"I\u0027m used to plain livin\u0027. It isn\u0027t often I sit down to a meal like this. Do you know, there\u0027s20 nothing suits me better than a dinner of corned beef and cabbage.\" \"How vulgar the old man is!\" thought Mrs. Marlowe. \"He may have money, but his tastes are very common.\" \"We never have corned beef and cabbage here,\" she said, with a slight shudder. \"Very likely Bert Barton\u0027s mother has it very often,\" suggested Percy. \"My dear,\" said the squire, urbanely, \"if Uncle Jacob really enjoys those dishes so much, you might provide them for his special use.\" \"I will think of it,\" replied Mrs. Marlowe, shortly. Now that Uncle Jacob had hinted at the possession of wealth, Squire Marlowe beheld him as one transfigured. He was no longer a common, shabby old man, but a worthy old gentleman of eccentric ideas in the matter of wardrobe and manners. \"I wonder if Uncle Jacob wouldn\u0027t advance me twenty-five thousand dollars,\" was the thought that was passing through his mind as he gazed genially at his countrified guest. \"It would help me amazingly in my business, and enable me to do double as much. I will mention it to him in good time.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to come upon the old21 man for a handsome birthday present,\" thought Percy. \"Fifty dollars wouldn\u0027t be much for him to give. I shan\u0027t get more than a fiver from the governor.\" \"Uncle Jacob,\" said the squire, as they rose from the table, \"suppose you walk over to the factory with me; I should like you to see it.\" \"Nothing would please me better,\" said Jacob Marlowe, briskly. \"Will you come along, Percy?\" asked his father. \"No, papa,\" answered Percy, with a grimace. \"You know I don\u0027t like the smell of leather.\" \"I ought not to dislike it,\" said the squire, with a smile, \"for it gives me a very handsome income.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s different with you,\" returned Percy. \"Just give me the profits of the factory and I\u0027ll go there every day.\" \"He\u0027s a sharp one!\" said the squire, with a smile. \"I am afraid he is too sharp to suit me,\" thought Uncle Jacob. \"It seems to me the boy\u0027s mind runs upon money, and his own interests.\" The shoe factory was a large building of two stories, and within it was a hive of industry. As the squire led the way he explained the22 various workings to the old man, who was really curious and interested. It was on a larger scale than was common at the time he left for California, and the use of machinery had to a greater extent supplemented and superseded the work of the hands. Finally they came to a room where several boys were pegging shoes, for this work was still done in the old-fashioned way. Uncle Jacob\u0027s eyes lighted up when in one of them he recognized Bert Barton. He hurried forward, and put his hand on Bert\u0027s shoulder. \"So this is your business,\" he said. \"Yes,\" answered Bert, with a smile. \"Do you find it hard work?\" \"Oh, no! That is, I am used to it. It used to tire me at first.\" \"Did you tell your mother I was in town?\" \"Yes,\" answered Bert, \"and she says she hopes you will call.\" \"To be sure I will. I may call this evening.\" \"He\u0027s a likely boy, Albert,\" said Uncle Jacob, rejoining the squire, who stood aloof with a look of annoyance on his face. \"He works very well, I believe,\" was the cold reply. \"Shall we move on?\" \"Albert doesn\u0027t seem to feel much interest in his poor relations,\" thought Uncle Jacob. \"Well, it\u0027s human nature, I suppose.\" \"You seem to be doing a large business, Albert,\" he said aloud. \"Yes; but with a little more capital I could very much increase it,\" rejoined the squire. \"With twenty-five thousand dollars now, I would enlarge the factory to double its present size, and do twice the business I am now doing.\" \"I am afraid you want to get rich too fast, Albert.\" \"It would gratify my spirit of enterprise, Uncle Jacob. I feel that I have the ability to make a big business success.\" \"Very likely, Albert. I\u0027ve seen enough to convince me of that.\" \"He\u0027ll lend me the money if I work things right,\" Squire Marlowe said to himself. \"He\u0027ll be like wax in my hands.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81627.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
