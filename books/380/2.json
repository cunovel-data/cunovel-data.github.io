{"id":41802,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. UNCLE JACOB\u0027S RECEPTION.","content":"Percy found his father at home, and quickly acquainted him with the arrival in town of Uncle Jacob. His news was received with interest by Squire Marlowe. \"Why didn\u0027t you invite him to ride home with you?\" asked the squire. \"I did; but he preferred to walk.\" \"What does he look like?\" \"Like an old tramp,\" answered Percy. Squire Marlowe was taken aback; for, without having received any definite intelligence from the long absent relative, he had somehow persuaded himself that Uncle Jacob had accumulated a fortune at the mines. \"Then he is shabbily dressed?\" said the squire, inquiringly. \"I should say so. I say, father, I thought he was rich. You always said so.\" \"And I still think so.\" \"Then why don\u0027t he dress better?\" \"He is rather eccentric, Percy; and these California miners don\u0027t care much for dress as a rule. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if he were worth half a million. You\u0027d better treat him with11 attention, for we are his natural heirs, and there\u0027s no telling what may happen.\" \"Enough said, father. I don\u0027t care how he dresses if he\u0027s got the cash.\" \"I must go and speak to your mother, or she will treat him coldly. You know how particular she is.\" Squire Marlowe managed to drop a hint to his wife, who was as worldly wise as himself, and saw the advantage of being attentive to a wealthy relative. By this time Uncle Jacob had reached the door. Squire Marlowe himself answered the bell, as a mark of special attention, and gazed with curiosity at the old man. Jacob Marlowe, though coarsely clad, was scrupulously neat and clean, and there was a pleasant smile on his bronzed face as he recognized his nephew. \"I believe you are Uncle Jacob,\" said the squire, affably. \"Yes, Albert, and I\u0027m mighty glad to see a relation. It\u0027s twenty-five years since I have seen one that was kin to me.\" \"Welcome to Lakeville, Uncle Jacob. I am glad to see you. Percy told me he met you on the road: Why didn\u0027t you ride up with him?\" \"It wasn\u0027t worth gettin\u0027 in to ride a quarter12 of a mile. I am used to exercise in California.\" \"To be sure. Come into the house, and lay your valise down anywhere. Here is my wife, Mrs. Marlowe. Julia, this is Uncle Jacob, of whom you have heard me speak so often.\" \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Marlowe,\" said the lady, formally, just touching the old man\u0027s hand. \"Where are you going to put Uncle Jacob, Julia?\" asked the squire. \"You may take him to the blue room,\" said Mrs. Marlowe, in a tone of hesitation. This blue room was the handsomest chamber in the house, and was assigned to those whom it was considered politic to honor. \"Come right upstairs, Uncle Jacob. I\u0027ll show you your room myself,\" said Albert Marlowe. \"I ain\u0027t used to such luxury, Albert,\" said the old man, as he gazed around the comfortably appointed apartment. \"You ought to see my cabin at Murphy\u0027s diggings. I reckon your servant would turn up her nose at it.\" \"I know you don\u0027t care much for style in California, uncle.\" \"No, we don\u0027t, though we\u0027ve got as handsome houses in \u0027Frisco as anywhere else.13 Why, Albert, this room is fine enough for a prince.\" \"Then you can think yourself a prince,\" said the squire, genially. \"Now, if you want to wash your face and hands, and arrange your toilet, you will have abundant time before dinner. Come down when you have finished.\" Albert Marlowe returned to his wife. \"Mr. Marlowe,\" said she, \"are you very sure that old man is rich?\" \"I have no doubt of it, Julia.\" \"But what an old fright he is! Why, he looks dreadfully common, and his clothes are wretchedly shabby.\" \"True, Julia; but you must remember miners are not very particular about their dress.\" \"I should think not, if he is a fair specimen. It makes me shudder to think of his occupying the blue-room. The hall bedroom on the third floor would have been good enough for him.\" \"Remember, my dear, he is in all probability very wealthy, and we are his heirs. I am not so well off as people imagine, and it will be a great thing for us to have a fortune of a quarter or half a million drop in by and by.\" \"There\u0027s something in that, to be sure,\" the14 lady admitted. \"But can\u0027t you induce him to wear better clothes?\" \"I will suggest it very soon. We mustn\u0027t be too precipitate, for fear he should take offense. You know these rich uncles expect to be treated with a good deal of consideration.\" \"Do you think he will expect to live with us? I shall really give up if I have got to have such a looking old tramp as a permanent member of the family.\" \"But, Julia, if he is really very rich, it is important for us to keep him strictly in view. You know there will be plenty of designing persons, who will be laying snares to entrap him, and get possession of his money.\" \"How old is he? Is he likely to live long?\" \"I think he must be about sixty-five.\" \"And he looks alarmingly healthy,\" said Mrs. Marlowe, with a sigh. \"His father died at sixty-seven.\" Mrs. Marlowe brightened up. \"That is encouraging,\" she said, hopefully. \"I don\u0027t think he looks so very healthy,\" added the squire. \"He has a good color.\" \"His father was the picture of health till within a few weeks of his death.\" \"What did he die of?\" \"Apoplexy.\"15 \"To be sure. The old man looks as if he might go off that way.\" \"In that case we should only need to be troubled with him a couple of years, and for that we should be richly repaid.\" \"They will seem like two eternities,\" groaned the lady, \"and the chief burden will come on me.\" \"You shall be repaid, my dear! Only treat him well!\" \"Will you give me half what money he leaves to us?\" \"Say one-third, Julia. That will repay you richly for all your trouble.\" \"Very well! Let it be a third. But, Mr. Marlowe, don\u0027t let there be any mistake! I depend upon you to find out as soon as possible how much money the old man has.\" \"Trust to me, Julia. I am just as anxious to know as you are.\" In twenty minutes Uncle Jacob came down stairs. He had done what he could to improve his appearance, or \"slick himself up,\" as he expressed it, and wore a blue coat and vest, each provided with brass buttons. But from close packing in his valise both were creased up in such a manner that Squire Marlowe and his wife shuddered, and Percy\u0027s face wore an amused and supercilious smile. \"I declare I feel better to be dressed up,\" said the old man. \"How long do you think I\u0027ve had this coat and vest, Albert?\" \"I really couldn\u0027t guess.\" \"I had it made for me ten years ago in Sacramento. It looks pretty well, but then I\u0027ve only worn it for best.\" Percy had to stuff his handkerchief in his mouth to repress a laugh. Uncle Jacob regarded him with a benevolent smile, and seemed himself to be amused about something. \"Now, Uncle Jacob, we\u0027ll sit down to dinner. You must be hungry.\" \"Well, I have got a fairish appetite. What a nice eatin\u0027 room you\u0027ve got, Albert. I ain\u0027t used to such style.\" \"I presume not,\" said Mrs. Marlowe, dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81626.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
