{"id":41824,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. THE OFFICE OF THE MAGNET MINE.","content":"Bert took the morning train to New York, and arrived about half-past seven o\u0027clock. He met with no adventures on the way, and as soon as he reached the Grand Central Depot took a Fourth Avenue car down, as instructed by Uncle Jacob. In a large building of many stories on Nassau Street, on the sixth floor, was an office on the door of which Bert read MAGNET MINING CO. This, as he understood, was the office where Jacob Marlowe was employed. Bert was considering whether he ought to knock or not, when a brisk-looking gentleman stepped up, and, opening the door, entered. Bert followed him in. \"Whom did you wish to see?\" asked the brisk-looking man. \"Mr. Jacob Marlowe. Is this the office where he is employed?\" \"Yes,\" answered the man, with a smile. Bert hardly needed this assurance, however, as he had already discovered Uncle Jacob sitting in an inner room, at a desk, conversing on business, apparently, with an elderly man of dignified appearance.170 \"He will soon be at leisure,\" said the one who had just entered, and seated himself at another desk in the outer room. \"That must be Uncle Jacob\u0027s employer,\" thought Bert. \"What news do you hear of the mine?\" he heard the elderly man ask. \"Excellent,\" answered Uncle Jacob. \"It has gone up five points within two weeks. The output is steadily increasing.\" \"Do you know anything of it from your own knowledge?\" \"Certainly; I ought to, for I was myself its discoverer.\" This rather surprised Bert. \"It was a rich find,\" continued Uncle Jacob, \"and I have no hesitation in putting it on the New York market.\" \"There are so many wild-cat mines, you know, that a man needs to be very cautious.\" \"Quite true. In such mines it is only the men who capitalize them who make money. I would not lend myself to any such scheme of deception. I have a reputation to sustain, and I value that more than money. Our mine has found favor with some of the most conservative investors in the city.\" Here Uncle Jacob mentioned several names, so prominent that171 they were familiar to Bert, country boy though he was. \"You may put me down for five hundred shares,\" said the elderly man, apparently convinced. \"I will send you round a check to-morrow. To whom shall I make it payable?\" \"To me.\" \"Very well.\" The old gentleman rose, drew on his gloves, and went out, Uncle Jacob accompanying him to the door. This brought him face to face with Bert. \"So you have come, Bert,\" he said with a pleasant smile. \"How did you leave your mother?\" \"Very well, uncle.\" \"At what time did you breakfast?\" \"At half-past six.\" \"Then you must be hungry. It is rather early for my lunch, but I will go out with you now. Mr. Bascom, I shall be back within an hour. If any one calls to see me, try to keep him.\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Bascom deferentially. \"He can\u0027t be Uncle Jacob\u0027s employer,\" thought Bert. \"He is too respectful. I had no idea uncle was such a man of business. He doesn\u0027t appear to be afraid of anybody.\" They descended in the elevator, rather to172 Bert\u0027s surprise, who had climbed up by the staircase. Crossing the street they entered a dairy restaurant, which in spite of the name supplied the usual variety of dishes. They found a table at which no others were seated, and Uncle Jacob ordered a substantial meal of roast beef and vegetables. \"Did you find me easily, Bert?\" he inquired. \"Oh, yes, uncle. I had to inquire the way once only. Do you like your place?\" \"Very well, indeed, Bert.\" \"Is it a good man you work for?\" Uncle Jacob smiled. \"I have no fault to find with him,\" he answered. \"I thought perhaps that man with black hair and whiskers might be the boss.\" \"No, he is a clerk.\" \"Like you?\" \"Yes,\" answered Jacob, with another smile. \"Does the boss often come in?\" \"He doesn\u0027t interfere much. You see he has a good deal of confidence in Mr. Bascom and myself.\" \"So I thought.\" \"What made you think so?\" \"You seem to talk and act as if you were independent.\"173 \"It\u0027s a way I have, Bert. As I understand the business thoroughly, more than anybody else, there is no reason why I shouldn\u0027t, is there?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"That is why I enjoy my position so well.\" \"Do you get paid your wages every Saturday night?\" \"Oftener, if I please,\" answered Jacob Marlowe, seeming amused. \"If I happen to get short in the middle of the week, I can draw in advance.\" \"You seem to have a very good position, Uncle Jacob. It is a great deal better than opening a cigar store in Lakeville.\" \"Yes, I think so myself—Albert Marlowe was right in advising me against it. Have you seen him lately?\" \"I see him about every day, but not to speak to.\" \"It was mean in him to discharge you from the factory.\" \"So I thought, Uncle Jacob.\" \"I wrote asking him to take you back.\" \"What did he say?\" asked Bert, with interest. \"He in effect told me to mind my own business. I hope you and your mother have not suffered for want of money?\"174 \"No, thanks to you, Uncle Jacob. Mother thought you ought not to have sent so much.\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall miss it, Bert,\" said Uncle Jacob. \"I am glad that it helped you.\" \"The twenty-dollar bill got me into trouble.\" \"How was that?\" Bert told the story of his arrest on the charge of robbing Mr. Jones, and gave an account of his trial. \"And you were tried before Albert Marlowe?\" \"Yes.\" \"I suppose Percy rejoiced in your humiliation?\" \"No, he didn\u0027t. He behaved like a brick. He walked to the court-room with me, and told me he was sure I was not guilty.\" \"I am certainly surprised, but I am pleased also. That is a point in Percy\u0027s favor, an unexpected one. He shan\u0027t lose by it.\" \"I am afraid I shouldn\u0027t have got off if it hadn\u0027t been for a young lawyer from New York, named Conway, who volunteered to defend me.\" \"Go on. Give me an account of it. Can you give me the address of Mr. Conway?\" \"Yes, uncle. I have it here.\"175 \"I may be able to throw a little business in his way. One good turn deserves another.\" \"I wish you would, Uncle Jacob. Mr. Conway refused to accept a fee, knowing that I could not afford to pay him.\" Uncle Jacob asked other questions as the dinner proceeded. Finally Bert brought out his most important piece of news. \"I have just found out that my father is still alive,\" he said. \"Yes, I knew that,\" returned Uncle Jacob calmly. \"You knew it?\" \"Yes, he has been to see me.\" \"He has! When?\" \"Last week.\" \"You don\u0027t think him guilty of the charge which was brought against him?\" \"No; I think him a badly-used man.\" \"I wish I could be the means of proving his innocence.\" \"I mean that you shall be.\" Bert surveyed his uncle in surprise. \"In fact, it is for that reason I have sent for you. Your father has put his case into my hands, and I propose to see him righted. This evening, when I am free from business cares, I will speak further with you on this subject.\" Uncle Jacob called for his check, paid it, and they returned to the office. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81648.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
