{"id":41819,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. BERT\u0027S EXPERIENCE AS A FARMER\u0027S BOY.","content":"Bert followed the farmer into the kitchen, in the center of which a table was set. A bony and angular woman was just placing on it a large pitcher of water. \"Mis\u0027 Wilson,\" said the farmer, \"this is Bert Barton, who is helping me about the farm work.\" Bert was no stranger to Mrs. Wilson, whose pew in church was near the one he occupied. \"How\u0027s your ma?\" she inquired jerkily. \"Pretty well, thank you, Mrs. Wilson.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. She looks like a friend of mine, Mrs. Dusenberry, who died of heart disease.\" \"I don\u0027t think her heart is affected,\" said Bert, not without anxiety. \"Maybe not, but you can\u0027t tell. Folks lives along for years with their hearts out of kilter, who never find it out till some day they drop dead.\" Mrs. Wilson decidedly was not a cheerful132 converser. She prided herself on detecting signs of unsuspected diseases. \"Mebbe you\u0027ve got heart disease yourself, Sophia,\" remarked the farmer jocosely. \"Just as likely as not,\" answered Mrs. Wilson calmly. \"I\u0027m sure my liver\u0027s affected, for I feel it squirm sometimes.\" \"Mebbe I\u0027d better look out for a second Mis\u0027 Wilson,\" suggested the farmer smiling. \"You ain\u0027t over healthy yourself, Silas,\" responded his better half, surveying her husband in a business-like manner. \"It looks to me as if your kidneys was out of order, and you\u0027re the very image of Jed Pettibone, who died of apoplexy. He lived next door to my mother. One day he was alive and well, and to-morrow he was as the grass of the field.\" The farmer\u0027s face wore a very uncomfortable look, and he was evidently by no means pleased with his wife\u0027s prognostications. \"Nonsense!\" he said testily. \"I\u0027m as well as any man of my age in Lakeville.\" \"\u0027Boast not thyself of to-morrow\u0027!\" quoted Mrs. Wilson solemnly. \"Come, Bert, let us set down to dinner,\" said Silas hastily. \"What have you got for us, Sophia?\" \"I\u0027ve warmed over them beans we had yesterday,\" answered his helpmeet, \"and there\u0027s133 two sausages besides. I don\u0027t want any. You\u0027d ought to make a dinner off of that.\" \"Why, to be sure! Beans and sausages is hearty, and will stand by us in the field. The laborer is worthy of his meat.\" \"Where\u0027s the meat,\" thought Bert. Silas Wilson put a moderate portion of beans on a large plate, flanking it with a thin, consumptive-looking sausage. \"Help yourself to potatoes,\" he said, as he handed the plate to Bert. Bert availed himself of the invitation, and helped himself to a potato in that condition known as soggy. He tried to eat it, but, though fond of potatoes, he left it almost entire on his plate. This, however, was not all. There was a plate of rye-bread on the table, from which Bert helped himself to a slice. It was apparently two or three days old, and needed something to make it palatable. \"Please give me some butter,\" asked Bert, not having observed that this was a prohibited article on the Wilsons\u0027 dinner table. \"There ain\u0027t none,\" answered Mrs. Wilson promptly. \"I beg pardon. I hadn\u0027t noticed,\" said Bert, blushing. \"We never have butter at dinner,\" explained Silas Wilson. \"It\u0027s apt to lead to134 humors, particularly in boys, isn\u0027t it, Mis\u0027 Wilson?\" \"So I\u0027ve always heard, Silas. Besides, as we have it at breakfast and supper, that\u0027s enough. It goes fast enough, even then. Why, we used most a pound last week.\" \"And butter twenty-seven cents a pound!\" chimed in the farmer. \"Why, it\u0027s extravagant!\" \"Do you know, Silas, how much butter is used in Squire Marlowe\u0027s family?\" \"No,\" answered the farmer, with interest. \"Hannah—Mrs. Marlowe\u0027s girl—told me they used six pounds and a half last week, and there\u0027s only four of them, including the girl. What do you think of that?\" \"What do I think? I think it\u0027s sinful—positively sinful! Six pounds and a half at twenty-seven cents——\" \"They pay thirty-two, and get the best in the market,\" amended his wife. \"Worse and worse! That comes to what—Bert?\" \"Two dollars and eight cents,\" answered Bert promptly. \"Sho! Did you ever?\" \"Well, I s\u0027pose the squire can stand it. No doubt they live on the fat of the land. I just wish they\u0027d invite me to tea, so I could judge135 for myself. I could tell within five cents how much the supper cost.\" It must be confessed that Bert did not enjoy his dinner. The sausage was far from rich or juicy, and the beans were almost cold. The potatoes and bread have already been referred to. However, there was to be a second course, and to that Bert looked forward anxiously, for he had by no means satisfied his appetite. It was a plain rice pudding, and partially satisfactory, for it takes very little skill to boil rice, and there is little variety in the quality. By way of sauce Mrs. Wilson provided cheap grade of molasses. Still Bert enjoyed it better than any other article on the table. \"There\u0027s nothing like a good dinner to strengthen us for the labors of the field,\" said Silas Wilson complacently, as he rose from the table. \"Come, Bert, now let us get to work to make up for lost time.\" \"So Mr. Wilson considers the time spent in eating as lost time,\" thought Bert. \"I\u0027d rather have one of mother\u0027s dinners than half a dozen like this. Ugh! how nasty those potatoes were.\" Bert returned to the field, and resumed his work. He found it hard to keep up with Silas Wilson, whose energies seemed to be quickened by his midday meal.136 About four o\u0027clock a man came along who wanted to see Silas on business, and he went back to the house, leaving Bert to continue his work alone. \"This is about the longest day I ever passed,\" thought Bert, pausing to wipe his moistened forehead. \"I am afraid I shall never want to be a farmer. I mustn\u0027t forget, though, that I am to receive sixteen cents and a little over per day, besides board—and such board! Yet this is the way Silas Wilson has lived all his life, and he must be sixty-five at least. How much more enjoyment Uncle Jacob has out of life, though he is a poor man compared to the farmer.\" At this moment he heard wheels passing on the road hard by, and looking up he recognized Percy Marlowe, neat and trim in his attire, driving a light buggy. \"Hallo!\" called out Percy, checking his horse. \"Hallo, Percy!\" \"Are you working for Silas Wilson?\" \"Yes, for a few days.\" \"I guess you\u0027ll make a fortune in that time?\" said Percy laughing. \"It seems like it,\" responded Bert. \"How much does he pay you?\" \"Fifty cents for three days and board.\"137 Percy laughed. \"I should want fifty cents an hour, and then I wouldn\u0027t do it.\" \"I\u0027d work all the year round at that price,\" said Bert. \"I never expect to work—with my hands,\" went on Percy. \"Have you decided what to do?\" asked Bert curiously. \"My father wants me to be a manufacturer, but I think I shall be a lawyer.\" \"I am afraid I shan\u0027t have much choice. I must take what I can get.\" \"You might stay with Mr. Wilson and be a farmer.\" \"I don\u0027t think that will suit me at any rate, unless I can work for a different man.\" \"Perhaps father can take you back into the shop when you are older.\" \"I wish he would take me back now. I like it a great deal better than working out in the field here.\" \"You mustn\u0027t get too high notions into your head, Bert. You know you are a working boy and mustn\u0027t expect to have things all your own way.\" \"I am not likely to forget that I am a working boy, especially with kind friends to remind me of it. But we live in the best country in the world, and there is many a working boy who grows up to be a distinguished man.\" Percy laughed ironically. \"I wouldn\u0027t get such silly ideas into your head,\" he said. \"Why are they silly?\" \"You talk as if you expected to be a distinguished man. Ha, ha!\" \"I hope to be a successful man,\" answered Bert stoutly. Percy laughed again and drove on. Five minutes later Bert saw the farmer running from the house in a state of great apparent excitement. \"Have you seen anything of my wallet?\" he gasped, as he came within hearing distance.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81643.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
