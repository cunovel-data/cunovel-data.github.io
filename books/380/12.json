{"id":41812,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. MR. JONES IS EXCITED.","content":"The astonishment and wrath of Mr. Jones were almost ludicrous as he stared at the lawyer, who, cool and composed, reiterated his threat. \"I never heard of such a thing!\" he gasped. \"You take my own money from me?\"85 \"It remains to be proved whether it is your own money. The boy says it is his.\" \"The boy lies.\" \"Really, Mr. Jones, I cannot allow you to make such charges against my client, unless you are ready to substantiate them by proof.\" \"It stands to reason,\" began Mr. Jones, but the young lawyer interrupted him. \"Nothing stands to reason that you can\u0027t prove,\" he said. \"We will give you an opportunity to prove your ownership of the bill to-morrow in court. Now hand the bill to officer Drake.\" Very much against his will, Mr. Jones felt compelled to do this. \"Isn\u0027t the boy going to be arrested?\" he demanded, with an ugly look at Bert. \"It is unnecessary. You can bring a formal charge against him before Squire Marlowe to-morrow.\" \"The boy may escape during the night. I won\u0027t trust him.\" There was a murmur of disapproval among those present. All liked Bert, and Mr. Jones, from his quick temper and ugly disposition, was by no means a favorite. The store-keeper saw that it would not be good policy to insist upon Bert\u0027s arrest, and he said, sullenly, \"I86 will hold you responsible for his presence at the trial.\" Mr. Conway smiled. \"If he is not present, I will myself see that you do not suffer in consequence. Besides, flight would be tantamount to confession, and the case would go against him by default.\" \"And should I in that case get the twenty-dollar bill?\" \"I will take it upon me to offer no opposition,\" said the lawyer. \"Now, can I go?\" asked Bert. \"Yes; I will accompany you home for consultation.\" Bert took the can of kerosene and was about to leave the store, when the store-keeper said harshly: \"Put down that kerosene! you haven\u0027t paid for it!\" Bert flushed and looked embarrassed. It was true that he had not paid for it, nor did he have the money to pay, outside of the twenty-dollar bill which had been taken from him. \"I have no money,\" he said. \"I will leave it till to-morrow.\" \"How much is it, Mr. Jones?\" asked Conway. \"Twenty-five cents.\"87 \"I will advance the money. Bert, take your can.\" \"You are very kind, Mr. Conway,\" said the boy gratefully. \"We will settle hereafter. Now let us be going.\" In explanation of the price mentioned, I may say that kerosene is now much cheaper than at the date of my story. \"Now, Bert,\" said Mr. Conway, \"as your legal adviser I shall have to ask you to tell me just where you obtained the bill you offered in payment to Mr. Jones for the kerosene. I have no doubt of your innocence, but we must make it plain to all who may attend the trial.\" \"I should like to have you come home with me, Mr. Conway. Mother will confirm what I say.\" \"I shall be glad to do so. Will your mother be alarmed?\" \"Yes, I think she will; but you can make things clear to her.\" Mrs. Barton was indeed startled when she learned that Bert had been charged with theft, but after a free talk with Mr. Conway she felt much relieved. \"Your defence is perfect, I think,\" said the young lawyer. \"Of course Mr. Jones or his lawyer may claim that you wrote the letter yourself.\" \"Will it be necessary to send to Uncle Jacob and get him to testify?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. I think your defence will be complete without it. There is another point of considerable importance which I shall look up to-night. If things turn out as I suspect they will, we shall not need to disturb your Uncle Jacob.\" At nine o\u0027clock Mr. Conway took his leave and returned to the hotel. He had a short conference with the landlord, which was evidently satisfactory. \"I think we shall prove too many for Mr. Jones,\" he murmured softly, as he went up to bed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81636.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
