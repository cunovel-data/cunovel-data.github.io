{"id":41836,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. RALPH HARDING IS FOUND.","content":"Bert was still partly under the influence of chloroform; but the sight of Ralph Harding, whom he recognized from the photograph which had been given him, roused him from his stupefaction. Harding repeated his question. \"Who are you?\" he asked, \"and how do you know me?\" \"I am Bert Barton.\" \"What? not the son of John Barton?\" exclaimed Harding, drawing back with a troubled look. \"Yes,\" answered Bert, gravely; \"I am the259 son of John Barton, and I have been in search of you for several weeks.\" \"You have been in search of me? Why did you want to see me?\" \"I want you to clear my father of the false charge which was brought against him ten years ago,\" answered Bert, firmly. \"I don\u0027t understand what you mean,\" stammered Harding, who had sunk back into a chair and was eyeing Bert with a troubled look. \"Oh, yes, you do, Mr. Harding. It was you who gave the information that one of the stolen bonds was in my father\u0027s overcoat pocket.\" \"It was true,\" said Harding doggedly. \"Where were the rest?\" asked Bert, pointedly. \"How should I know? Your father had them secreted somewhere, I suppose.\" \"You know better than that. My father was innocent. He knew nothing of the bonds. An enemy plotted to get him into trouble.\" \"Do you charge me with being that enemy?\" demanded Harding.260 \"You had something to do with it, but you were the instrument of another.\" \"How do you know that?\" admitted Harding, incautiously. \"Shall I tell you the name of that other?\" \"Yes.\" \"It is Albert Marlowe.\" Ralph Harding started in surprise. \"Does he admit it?\" he asked, after a pause. \"No; he does not know that it is suspected. I want you to back me up in the demand that he clear my father from suspicion.\" \"He will never do it. How could he, without criminating himself?\" \"Whatever be the result, my father\u0027s character must be cleared.\" \"Tell me, is your father still living?\" asked Ralph Harding, earnestly. \"Yes, he is.\" \"Have you seen him?\" \"Yes. Poor father, he has suffered much. He has been separated from my mother and myself these many years, and has not dared to show himself at his old home, or among261 his old friends, because he was liable to be arrested on the old charge.\" Ralph was looking down upon the floor, and his features were working convulsively. Bert guessed what was passing through his mind, and paused to give him time. He looked up after a while, and asked: \"What would you have me do?\" \"Testify to what you know. It will clear my father, and he can come home once more.\" \"But it will condemn Albert Marlowe.\" \"Why not let it? He is the guilty man. Have you so much reason to like Albert Marlowe that you will not do this act of justice?\" \"No!\" Ralph Harding burst out, and his face wore an expression of resentment. \"He has used me like a dog. It was through me that he became a rich man, and in return he has treated me with contempt and indifference. If I dared——\" \"You would expose him?\" \"Yes, I would. It is of no use to deny what you have said. Your father is an innocent man. The bonds were stolen by Albert Marlowe.\"262 Bert looked triumphant. He had wrung the truth from the accomplice of Squire Marlowe. \"How did you find me?\" asked Harding, abruptly. \"How did you know I was in Chicago?\" \"I was told so by your sister.\" \"Have you been in Peoria, then?\" asked Harding, in great surprise. \"Yes; I was there last week.\" \"But how did you find out that I had a sister?\" \"At Harrisburg. You left a letter from your sister at your boarding-house there, which gave me the clew I wanted.\" \"And how did you trace me to Harrisburg?\" Bert explained. \"And you defrayed your own expenses? I thought you and your mother were left in poverty.\" \"So we were; but an uncle of my mother\u0027s recently returned from California, and it is he who has supplied me with the funds needed for my journey.\"263 \"Then he is wealthy?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. He is employed in New York on a small salary, but he is liberal with the little he has. He has set his heart on clearing my father\u0027s reputation. It is he who sent me on my present mission.\" \"Does your father think that Albert Marlowe is the real thief?\" \"He does. In fact, he is firmly convinced of it. Now, Mr. Harding, I have told you why I wanted to find you. You have as much as told me I am right in my suspicion. You are partly responsible for my poor father\u0027s undeserved sufferings. But for you he would never have been charged with the crime. Is it not so?\" \"I admit it,\" Ralph Harding answered, slowly. \"Will you tell me who put the bond into my father\u0027s pocket?\" \"I did.\" \"And who prompted you to do it?\" \"It was the man you suspected—Albert Marlowe.\"264 \"It was the proceeds of his theft that enabled him to start in business, was it not?\" \"You are right.\" \"I have one more question to ask. Will you accompany me to New York and testify to this, if needful?\" \"But what will happen to me?\" asked Harding, troubled. \"My uncle bade me promise you that we will do our utmost to prevent your coming to harm. As to Albert Marlowe, we shall demand a confession from him, or we shall have him arrested, and the whole matter investigated.\" Ralph Harding paused for a brief space, and then said: \"What are your plans if I agree to help you?\" \"To start for New York to-night,\" answered Bert, promptly. \"In New York I will take you to Uncle Jacob\u0027s office, and we will decide what to do next.\" Harding hesitated a moment, then said: \"I believe you will keep your promise, and I will put myself in your hands. I always liked your father better than Albert Marlowe, who265 is a very selfish man, and he has not kept his promise to me. I have reproached myself more than once for consenting to help Marlowe in his plot. It has never been out of my mind. I have been restless, unable to settle down anywhere, and have suffered punishment myself, though not as severe as has fallen upon your father. When I have made reparation, as I now have a chance to do, I shall be more contented in mind.\" \"Can you be ready to take the evening train with me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where are you living?\" \"In this house.\" \"Then we can remain together. I have not thanked you yet for coming to my help, and saving my money.\" \"I am glad to have helped the son. It will help offset the injury I have done the father.\" Bert, accompanied by Ralph Harding, took the evening train for New York. Their arrival was timely, for reasons which will be shown in a later chapter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81660.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
