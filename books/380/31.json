{"id":41831,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. SQUIRE MARLOWE IS SURPRISED.","content":"It may be well to return to Lakeville, as something has occurred there which deserves to be recorded. It is needless to say that Mrs. Barton missed Bert, whose bright and cheerful presence had filled the little house with comfort and glad221dened his mother\u0027s heart. Still she knew that he was well, and heard from him every week, though Bert only detailed his experiences in general terms, not caring to raise expectations which perhaps might prove illusive. Bert\u0027s absence from Lakeville excited some surprise and speculation. Squire Marlowe, to whom it had been mentioned by Percy, stopped Mrs. Barton in the street one day, and said: \"Percy tells me that your son is away.\" \"Yes.\" \"Where is he?\" \"He went to New York.\" \"Is he at work there?\" \"No, he is travelling.\" \"Travelling? What do you mean?\" \"Uncle Jacob has sent him off on some mission. He is at Harrisburg, I believe.\" \"That is very strange!\" remarked the squire, arching his eyebrows. \"What possible mission can Jacob have for the boy?\" \"He doesn\u0027t write particulars; but his expenses are paid.\" \"I don\u0027t see how Jacob Marlowe, with his paltry twelve dollars a week, can make such arrangements.\" \"Nor I; but probably Uncle Jacob has interested his employer in Bert.\"222 \"It may be so, but I think it very unwise to send off a boy by himself. What judgment has he, or what can he do?\" \"I don\u0027t very well know. He seems to enjoy the trip.\" \"Of course; but it will spoil him for solid work. He had better have stayed at home.\" \"What encouragement was there for him to stay in Lakeville? If you had not discharged him, he would be here now. If you will take him back into the factory, I will write him to that effect, and perhaps it will induce him to return.\" \"Ahem! I will think of it. Does he send you any money?\" \"Not yet.\" \"Then how do you live?\" \"Without calling upon you, Albert,\" said Mrs. Barton, with a little tinge of bitterness. \"I hardly think you feel enough interest in me to care how I live.\" Albert Marlowe was somewhat embarrassed, and regretted that he had asked the question. Mrs. Barton might take it into her head that he was willing to contribute to her support, and this was far from being the case. \"Women look at things from a peculiar point of view,\" he said. \"Of course I wish you well, and for that reason regret that you223 are so injudicious in your management of Bert.\" \"I have no fear but that Bert will turn out well,\" rejoined Mrs. Barton proudly. \"Ahem! I hope so, though that twenty-dollar affair led me to fear that he had inherited loose ideas about honesty.\" \"What do you mean?\" demanded Mrs. Barton, her cheeks aflame with indignation. \"I shouldn\u0027t think you would need to ask. Of course we both know why Mr. Barton is an exile, unable to return home.\" \"Yes, Albert Marlowe, we do know! He is an innocent man, suffering for the crime of another.\" \"That is what he says, is it?\" sneered the squire. \"That might be expected.\" \"Because it is true; but, Albert Marlowe, I have good hopes that his innocence may be vindicated, and the real criminal brought to light.\" Her intense gaze made the squire uncomfortable. \"Did she mean anything?\" he asked himself. \"It is natural for you to take the most favorable view of the matter,\" he said; \"but your hope is hardly likely to be realized. Good-morning.\" Mrs. Barton looked after him, and her spirit224 rose in revolt against the inequalities of fortune. Here was the real criminal, as she fully believed—rich, prosperous, enjoying a high social position, while her poor husband, the scapegoat for another\u0027s offense, was an exile from home. The next day Squire Marlowe went to New York on business. He occasionally visited Wall Street, and now and then made an investment. He looked the embodiment of dignity and respectability, with his ample figure, fine broadcloth suit, and gold-rimmed eyeglasses, and might readily have been taken for a prosperous and wealthy city banker. About one o\u0027clock he entered an expensive restaurant, a stone\u0027s throw from Broadway, and taking up the bill of fare made a selection of dishes for his dinner. As he did so, he said to himself, with a comfortable smile: \"When I was a common workman in a shoe shop, how little did I think that I should ever be able to sit down in a restaurant like this, and pay a dollar and a half for my dinner. Why, I didn\u0027t earn much more than that by a day\u0027s labor. Here I am surrounded by brokers, bankers, and wealthy merchants, and quite as good as they.\" The thought led Squire Marlowe to look around him. What he saw almost paralyzed225 him with surprise. There—at a neighboring table—sat Uncle Jacob, enjoying a luxurious dinner, the cost of which the squire, with the bill of fare before him, estimated must come to a high figure. \"Can that be Uncle Jacob?\" Albert Marlowe asked himself in amazement. \"How on earth can a clerk on twelve dollars a week salary afford to dine at a restaurant like this?\" As he had not yet given his order, he moved over to the table occupied by Uncle Jacob, and took a seat opposite him. \"Albert Marlowe!\" exclaimed the old man, recognizing him with surprise. \"Yes, Uncle Jacob, it is I. But what on earth brings you here?\" \"I should think it was pretty evident,\" said Jacob Marlowe with a smile, \"I came in for my dinner.\" \"Yes, but do you usually come here?\" \"Not always—perhaps half the time. I make my heartiest meal of the day at this time—unlike most New Yorkers—and like it to be a good one.\" \"Of course, but—how can you afford to eat here? Didn\u0027t you say that your salary was twelve dollars a week?\" \"I think I said so.\"226 \"You are spending at that rate for your dinners alone. I don\u0027t understand how you can do it.\" \"I am an old man, Albert. I can\u0027t live many years, and I think it sensible to get as much comfort out of life as possible for my few remaining years.\" \"Still——\" \"I had a little money, you know, five hundred dollars, and I have managed to turn it to good account, so that I don\u0027t feel quite so cramped as when I was at Lakeville.\" \"The old man\u0027s been speculating!\" thought Albert Marlowe, \"and he has had a stroke of luck; but he\u0027s a fool to think he can live like a banker on the strength of that. Very likely his next venture will sweep away his small amount of capital. Well, if he comes to grief, he needn\u0027t apply to me. Henceforth I wash my hands of him and his affairs altogether.\" \"Of course it\u0027s your own lookout,\" he said, \"but to me you seem recklessly extravagant.\" \"Because I come in here? Well, perhaps so. When I find I can\u0027t afford it, I\u0027ll go to a cheaper place. Have you seen Mary Barton lately?\" \"Yes; she is well. By the way, what have you done with her boy?\"227 \"He is traveling.\" \"So I heard. It seems to me a very foolish proceeding. Who is paying his expenses?\" \"Himself.\" \"Is he working, then?\" asked the squire in surprise. \"Yes; he is a member of the \u0027Streets of Gotham\u0027 company, and is earning his living as an actor.\" \"What does he know about acting?\" asked the squire in amazement. \"It appears that he is giving satisfaction. He sent me a paper containing a highly commendatory notice of his first appearance.\" \"It won\u0027t last,\" said Albert Marlowe, his wish being father to the thought. When he returned to Lakeville that evening, he carried with him two pieces of news—first, that Uncle Jacob was living in luxury, and secondly, that Bert Barton was on the stage. \"If he can act, I can,\" said Percy jealously. \"They must have been hard up for an actor when they took Bert Barton. A boy brought up in a country town. Never been to a theatre in his life before. Pooh! I dare say he appeared for one night only. The idea of Mary Barton\u0027s son acting before a regular audience, a boy who has hoed corn for farmer Wilson!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81655.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
