{"id":41825,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. AN ADVERTISEMENT AND WHAT CAME OF IT.","content":"Uncle Jacob left the office at five o\u0027clock, and Bert, who had been exploring the lower part of New York, went uptown with him on the Sixth Avenue road. They got out at Twenty-third Street, and Jacob Marlowe led the way to a large, roomy house near Seventh Avenue. He took out a night-key, and opening the outer door proceeded to a large, handsomely furnished apartment on the second floor, with a bedroom attached. \"This is where I live, Bert,\" he remarked, as he took off his hat and hung it up in a closet. Bert looked around him. To him the room looked quite luxurious, being furnished in a style which would compare favorably even with Squire Marlowe\u0027s, the best house in Lakeville. Bert knew nothing of room rents in New York; but, inexperienced as he was, he was surprised that his uncle, on a salary of twelve dollars a week, should be able to live so well. He would have been even more amazed had he177 known that the weekly rent of the room he was in was twelve dollars. \"You\u0027ve got a splendid room, Uncle Jacob,\" he said. \"I shouldn\u0027t think you could afford to live in such style.\" \"Some of my friends think I am extravagant,\" observed Jacob Marlowe with a smile. \"Perhaps they are right.\" \"I am afraid you can\u0027t save anything,\" went on Bert gravely. \"What if you should get sick?\" \"I see, Bert, you are more prudent than I am. However I have invested some of my money in the Magnet Mine, and it is likely to double. So I feel justified in making myself comfortable.\" \"I am glad to hear that, Uncle Jacob. You deserve to succeed, you are so kind to others.\" \"I am glad you think so, Bert. I want to do some good while I live. It gives a man something to live for.\" After supper, which was taken at a restaurant near by, Uncle Jacob said: \"Now let us come to business. I promised your father that I would do what I could to prove him innocent of the charge made against him ten years since.\" \"Where is my father? Is he in the city?\"178 \"No; it is not safe for him to stay here, as he is subject to arrest, and might be recognized. He has gone back to Canada. Do you know the particulars of his story?\" \"Yes; mother told me all about it last night.\" \"You know, then, that a young man named Ralph Harding informed against him, and that it was his testimony that led to your father\u0027s arrest.\" \"Yes.\" \"Your father is under the impression that this Harding was in league with Albert Marlowe, and was employed by him to throw suspicion upon your father. The weak point of the prosecution was that your father could only be connected with the five-hundred dollar bond found in his overcoat pocket, while a large balance was wholly unaccounted for. That made it seem like a cunning conspiracy, as undoubtedly it was.\" \"Were the other bonds never traced?\" \"I understand not. No list of the numbers had been kept, and, not being registered, they could easily be sold. Your father thinks that upon these the present prosperity of Albert Marlowe was built up.\" \"How are we to prove that?\" \"It will be difficult. One thing is abso179lutely essential. We must find this Ralph Harding, and persuade him, if we can, to exonerate your father and place the guilt where it properly belongs.\" \"Does father know where to find Harding?\" \"No; if he did, the greatest difficulty in our way would be removed.\" \"Then I don\u0027t see that we can do anything,\" said Bert, disappointed. \"The task is difficult, but not impossible. All we know is, that only two months after the robbery Harding disappeared. It was reported that he went to the West, but this was by no means certain. From that day to this, nothing is positively known as to his whereabouts.\" \"Then I don\u0027t see what can be done,\" repeated Bert. \"There is one thing to guide us,\" continued Uncle Jacob; \"the man\u0027s occupation. There is a fair probability that he is working in some shoe town, that is, if he is still alive.\" \"There are a good many shoe towns,\" objected Bert. \"True; the clew is only a faint one, yet sometimes a faint clew leads to important discoveries.\"180 \"Have you taken any steps yet, Uncle Jacob?\" \"Yes; your father remembered that Harding was a Pennsylvanian by birth, and this made it possible, at least, that he had gone back to his native State. Accordingly, last week, I inserted an advertisement in two daily papers printed in Philadelphia, calling for information touching the man of whom we are in search. I will show you a copy of it.\" Uncle Jacob took from his wallet a newspaper clipping and showed it to Bert. It ran thus: Wanted.—Information as to the present residence of Ralph Harding, who in the year 1873 was employed in the shoe manufactory of Weeks Brothers, in Lynn, Mass. He will hear something to his advantage. \"Have you had any answer to this advertisement?\" asked Bert. \"Not till this morning, when I received a letter from Harrisburg, written in a feminine hand. Here it is.\" He placed in Bert\u0027s hands the following letter: Dear Sir: I have read in the Philadelphia Ledger your advertisement for a man named Ralph Harding. A man by that name181 boarded with me two months ago. He was working in a shoe shop in this city, so he may be the one you are after. You say you know of something to his advantage. If there is any money coming to him I want you to see that I am paid a just debt. Mr. Harding was owing me eight weeks\u0027 board when he left the house, at four dollars a week, and dirt cheap that is; for, if I do say it myself, there are not many boarding-houses in Harrisburg where so good a table is kept for four dollars as I give. I inclose my bill, and will be very glad if you will send me the money by return of mail, taking it out of any money that is to come to Mr. Harding. I work hard for my money, and I can\u0027t afford to lose thirty-two dollars, and it isn\u0027t right that I should. Hoping to hear from you very soon, I remain, Yours respectfully, Amelia Stubbs. P. S. You can send me a check, as I can get it cashed by my grocer. \"Mrs. Stubbs means business,\" remarked Bert with a smile. \"Have you sent her the money?\" \"Not yet. I don\u0027t hold myself liable for Ralph Harding\u0027s debts, even if this is the man182 I am after. However, I am willing to pay Mrs. Stubbs for information, if she can furnish any that will help us.\" \"Have you written to her?\" \"I am going to send a letter to her by you.\" \"Am I to go to Harrisburg?\" exclaimed Bert, pleasantly surprised. \"Yes; I shall send you there to-morrow.\" \"I should like to go. What am I to do when I get there?\" \"First of all you must call on Mrs. Stubbs. It may be well for you to engage board at her house for a week, paying in advance, as that will put you in her good graces. You will, of course, learn all you can from her, but it will be necessary also to seek information outside. I shall have to leave a good deal to your discretion.\" \"I hope your confidence in me won\u0027t prove to be misplaced, Uncle Jacob.\" \"I know you will do your best, Bert, but it is quite possible you may fail. As the poet says: \u0027\u0027Tis not in mortals to command success.\u0027 I am sure you will deserve it.\" \"Isn\u0027t it going to cost considerable to make this journey, Uncle Jacob?\" \"I think we can find money enough for it.\" \"I am afraid your money will soon melt away, uncle. Think how much you have spent for us already.\" \"You remember what I told you as to my lucky investment in the Magnet Mine. At any rate it will be worth something to vindicate your father, who, for ten long and tedious years, has been compelled to pass his life in exile under the ban of a crime which he never committed.\" \"Yes, Uncle Jacob, but it ought not to come out of you.\" \"Make yourself easy, Bert. The money we spend for worthy purposes is well invested, and we are often repaid tenfold. And now, as you are unacquainted with New York, I will take you out for a walk and show you how it looks by gaslight.\" Nothing could have pleased Bert better than this proposal. They returned at nine o\u0027clock, and both he and Uncle Jacob retired at an early hour.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81649.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
