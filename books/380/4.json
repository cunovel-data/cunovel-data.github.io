UNCLE JACOB\u0027S STARTLING REVELATION.","content":"\"Uncle Jacob was at the factory this afternoon,\" said Bert to his mother, when he went home. \"He says he may call here this evening.\"24 \"I hope he will. He was my poor mother\u0027s favorite brother—always kind and good-hearted. How is he looking, Bert?\" \"He seems in good health for an old man. His face is browned up, as if he had been out in the open air a good deal.\" \"I hope he has. It is twenty-five years since he went to California. Does he look as if he had prospered?\" \"I am afraid he is poor, mother, for although his clothing is neat and clean, it is plain and the cloth is faded?\" \"I am sorry to hear that, but I will welcome him none the less warmly. It will indeed seem like old times to have Uncle Jacob in my house.\" Meanwhile Bert had been bringing in wood and doing chores for his mother. \"Did Uncle Jacob tell you how long he intended to stay in Lakeville?\" \"No, mother; I only had a short time to talk with him when Percy rode by, and then he started to call on the squire. Do you know, mother, I am rather surprised that he should have been so well received, poor as he looks.\" \"I think better of Albert for it. It shows that he is not so worldly as I feared. Certainly Uncle Jacob ought to be well received25 by Albert Marlowe, for when Albert\u0027s father was in trouble Jacob lent him five hundred dollars—all in money he had—and I feel sure the money has not been repaid to him to this day.\" \"I don\u0027t think Percy will be very cordial. You know what high notions he has.\" \"He gets them principally from his mother, who is extremely aristocratic in her ideas.\" \"Was she of a high family?\" Mrs. Barton smiled. \"Her father was a fisherman,\" she replied, \"and when a girl she used to run barefoot on the sand. Later on she sewed straw for a living. She is no worse for that, certainly, but it doesn\u0027t give her any claims to aristocracy.\" \"Do you think Percy knows about his mother\u0027s early life?\" \"I presume she has kept it secret from him.\" \"I shall think of it when Percy gets into one of his patronizing moods.\" \"Remember, Bert, that neither he nor his mother is any the worse for her humble birth.\" \"I understand that, I hope, mother, just as I don\u0027t feel ashamed of our being poor.\" \"As long as we can make an honorable living, we have no right to complain.\"26 \"That reminds me, mother, that I heard bad news at the shop to-day.\" \"What is that?\" \"That the shop is likely to be shut down all next month.\" \"Why is that?\" asked Mrs. Barton, an anxious look coming over her face. \"I believe the market is over-supplied with shoes, and it is thought best to suspend temporarily. It\u0027ll be rather hard on me.\" \"Yes, it will,\" said his mother, gravely. \"I earn so little at sewing balls.\" \"Don\u0027t you think I could get a job at that, mother?\" \"No, you could not do the work satisfactorily. Besides there are hands enough for all that is required. Well, we must hope for the best.\" \"I think I can manage to earn something, mother,\" said Bert, hopefully. \"I\u0027ll try hard, anyway.\" \"We won\u0027t worry till the time comes, Bert.\" An hour later there was a knock at the door. Mrs. Barton answered it in person. \"Why, Uncle Jacob, is it really you?\" she exclaimed, joyfully. \"I\u0027m delighted to see you, Mary,\" said the old man, his face lighting up. \"I\u0027ve been waiting twenty-five years for this meeting.\"27 \"Come right in, Uncle Jacob. I can hardly believe it is really you. Now tell me why you have not written these many years.\" \"I\u0027ve no good excuse, Mary, but perhaps I shall think of one bimeby. Now tell me how you are getting along?\" \"I am not rich, as you can see, Uncle Jacob; but as long as Bert and I have our health, and work to do, I shall be contented.\" \"Do you know, Mary,\" said Jacob Marlowe, looking about the plain little sitting-room, \"I like your house better than Albert\u0027s?\" \"I don\u0027t think you will find many to agree with you.\" \"Perhaps not, but this seems like home, and that doesn\u0027t.\" \"Albert\u0027s house is finely furnished.\" \"True, and he lives in fine style; but I don\u0027t think I should ever be contented to live with him.\" \"Has he invited you?\" \"Yes,\" answered Jacob; \"but,\" he added, with a smile, \"I don\u0027t think the invitation will hold good after to-morrow.\" \"Why not?\" \"The fact is, Albert and the whole family think I am rich.\"28 \"I shouldn\u0027t think they would judge that from your appearance.\" \"Oh, they think I am eccentric and plain in my tastes, and that I\u0027ve got my pile safe somewhere.\" \"I wish you had, Uncle Jacob.\" \"Happiness doesn\u0027t depend on money, Mary, as you realize in your own case. I am an old man, to be sure, but I am well and strong, and able to work for a living.\" \"But at your age, Uncle Jacob, it would be comfortable to feel that you could rest.\" \"Come, Mary, don\u0027t make me out a patriarch. I\u0027m only sixty-five, and I can tackle a pretty good day\u0027s work yet.\" \"You might be sick, Uncle Jacob.\" \"Don\u0027t let us imagine unpleasant things, Mary. I don\u0027t mean to be sick.\" \"And at any rate you can come and stay with us. You will always find a home here, though an humble one.\" \"Do you really mean that, Mary?\" said Uncle Jacob, earnestly. \"Would you really be willing to take in the old man, and provide for his comforts?\" \"Of course I would, Uncle Jacob,\" answered Mrs. Barton, heartily. \"I hope you didn\u0027t think so poorly of me as to doubt it.\" \"No, I was sure you hadn\u0027t changed so29 much since you were a girl. Well, Mary, I may some time remind you of your promise.\" \"You won\u0027t need to remind me, Uncle Jacob. I was afraid Albert would take you wholly away from us.\" \"So he might if I were as rich as he thinks I am; but now let us talk about other things. Remember, I haven\u0027t heard any family news for many years, and I have a great many questions to ask.\" The rest of the evening was spent in such conversation as Uncle Jacob suggested, and when he had occasion to look at his watch, he started in surprise. \"Bless my soul!\" he exclaimed. \"It is nearly ten o\u0027clock. I ought to be getting back to Albert\u0027s.\" \"Then Bert shall accompany you as far as the house. It will be lonely to go alone.\" Uncle Jacob reached Squire Marlowe\u0027s house as the church clock struck ten, and he bade Bert good-night. Shortly after his return, Uncle Jacob was shown to his room, and being fatigued he soon fell asleep, not waking till seven in the morning. After breakfast, Squire Marlowe said graciously: \"Have you any plans, Uncle Jacob, in which I can assist you? If you30 would like to consult me about any investments, I can perhaps be of service to you.\" \"Now for it!\" thought the old man. \"I was thinkin\u0027, Albert,\" he said, \"of askin\u0027 your advice. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 on in years, and can\u0027t work as well as I could once. Do you think it would pay me to open here in Lakeville a cigar and candy store, and——\" \"What!\" exclaimed Squire Marlowe, with an expression of horror and disgust on his face. \"You see I\u0027ve got about five hundred dollars, which I think would be enough to stock it comfortably and——\" \"But I thought you were a rich man,\" gasped Squire Marlowe. \"Didn\u0027t you tell me you had a hundred thousand dollars in a Sacramento bank?\" \"Yes, many years ago; but I bought mining stocks, and after a while they went down to nothing, and——\" \"Then you are a pauper!\" said the squire, harshly. \"No. I have five hundred dollars, and I hope with that to get started, so as to earn an honest living.\" Words cannot describe the scorn and disgust that appeared on the faces of Percy and his mother at the old man\u0027s confession of poverty. \"Albert,\" said the wife, \"may I speak with you outside a moment?\" \"Certainly, my dear.\" \"Get rid of the old man as soon as you can!\" she said, imperiously. \"He doesn\u0027t eat another meal in my house!\" \"Be easy, my dear,\" said the squire. \"I\u0027ll manage it.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2966/81628.html","bookId":380,"book":{"id":380,"title":"Five Hundred Dollars or, Jacob Marlowe\u0027s Secret","description":"简介： Slowly through the village street walked an elderly man, with bronzed features and thin gray hair, supporting his somewhat uncertain steps by a stout cane.
