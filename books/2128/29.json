With Guenhwyvar\u0027s guidance, they came into the tunnels far beneath Mithril Hall, and Entreri knew the way well enough from there to guide them back to the tunnels connecting to the lower mines. The assas sin and the ranger parted company on the same ledge where they had once battled, under the same starry sky they had seen the night of their duel.\\n\\n Entreri walked off along the ledge, pausing a short distance away to turn and regard his hated rival.\\n\\n \"Long, too, is my own memory, \" he remarked, referring to Jar laxle\u0027s parting words. \"And are my methods less devious than those of the drow?\"\\n\\n Drizzt did not bother to respond.\\n\\n \"Suren I\u0027m cursing me own words, \" Catti-brie whispered to Drizzt. \"I\u0027d be liking nothing better than to put an arrow through that one\u0027s back!\"\\n\\n Drizzt hooked his arm over the young woman\u0027s shoulder and led her back into the tunnels. He would not disagree that Catti brie\u0027s shot, if taken, would have made the world a better place, but he was not afraid of Artemis Entreri anymore.\\n\\n Entreri had a lot on his mind, Drizzt knew. The assassin hadn\u0027t liked what he had seen in Menzoberranzan, such a clear mirror to his own dark soul, and he would be long in recovering from his emotional trials, long in turning his thoughts back to a drow ranger so very far away\\n\\n Less than an hour later, the two friends came upon the site of Wulfgar\u0027s death. They paused and stood before it for a long while, silently, arm in arm.\\n\\n By the time they turned to leave, a score of armed and armored dwarves had appeared, blocking every exit with engines of war.\\n\\n \"Surrender or be squished!\" came the cry, followed by howls of surprise when the two intruders were recognized. In rushed the dwarven soldiers, surrounding, mobbing the pair.\\n\\n \"Take them to the watch commander!\" came a call, and Drizzt and Catti-brie were shuffled off at breakneck speed, along the wind ing ways and through the formal entrance to the tunnels of Mithril Hall. A short distance from there, they found the aforementioned commander, and the two friends were as startled to see him in that position as Regis was to see them.\\n\\n \"The commander?\" was Catti-brie\u0027s first words as she looked again at her little friend. Regis bounded over and leaped into her arms, at the same time throwing an arm about Drizzt\u0027s neck.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back!\" he cried repeatedly, his cherubic features beam ing brightly\\n\\n \"Commander?\" Catti-brie asked again, no less incredulously\\n\\n Regis gave a little shrug. \"Somebody had to do it, \" he explained.\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s been doing it fine by me own eyes, \" said one dwarf. The other bearded folk in the room promptly agreed, putting a blush on the halfling\u0027s deceivingly dimpled face.\\n\\n Regis gave a little shrug, then kissed Catti-brie so hard that he bruised her cheek.\\n\\n Bruenor sat as if turned to stone, and the other dwarves in his\u0027 audience hall, after giving their hearty welcomes to Catti-brie, wisely departed.\\n\\n \"I bringed him back, \" the young woman began matter of factly when she and her father were alone, trying to sound as if nothing spectacular had occurred. \"And suren yer eyes should feast on the sights of Menzoberranzan!\"\\n\\n Bruenor winced; tears welled in his blue gray eye. \"Damned fool girl, \" he uttered loudly, stealing Catti-brie\u0027s cavalier attitude. She had known Bruenor since her earliest recollections, but she wasn\u0027t sure if the dwarf was about to hug her or throttle her.\\n\\n \"Damned fool yerself, \" she responded with characteristic stub bornness.\\n\\n Bruenor leaped forward and lifted his hand. He had never before hit his adopted daughter, but only managed to stop himself at the last moment now.\\n\\n \"Damned fool yerself!\" Catti-brie said again, as if daring Brue nor to strike her. \"Sitting here wallowing in something that ye can not change, when them things that are needing changing go merrily along their way!\"\\n\\n Bruenor turned away.\\n\\n \"Do ye think I\u0027m missing Wulfgar any less than yerself?\" Catti brie went on, grabbing his shoulder (though she could not begin to turn the solid dwarf). \"Do ye think Drizzt\u0027s missing him less?\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s a fool, too!\" Bruenor roared, spinning about to eye her squarely. For just a fleeting instant, Catti-brie saw that old spark, that old fire, burning in the dwarf\u0027s moist eye.\\n\\n \"And he\u0027d be the first to agree with ye, \" Catti-brie replied, and a smile widened on her fair face. \"And so are we all at times. But it\u0027s a friend\u0027s duty to help when we\u0027re being fools.\"\\n\\n Bruenor gave in, offered the hug that his dear daughter desperately needed. \"And Drizzt could never be asking for a better friend than Catti-brie, \" he admitted, burying his words in the young woman\u0027s neck, wet with an old dwarf\u0027s tears.\\n\\n Outside Mithril Hall, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden sat upon a stone, heed less of the stinging wind heralding the onslaught of winter, basking in the dawn he thought he would never see. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-29.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night \\n Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
