Then it fell, like a great spear, whistling along its thousand foot descent. Helpless and horrified, those dark elves levitating nearby watched it fly past. Inside the domed chapel, the ceremony continued undisturbed. A female soldier, an elite guard of House Baenre but certainly no noble, rushed up to the central dais, screaming wildly At first, Matron Baenre and the others thought her caught up in the out rageous frenzy, an all too common sight in the out of control drow rituals. Gradually they came to understand that this soldier was screaming cries of warning. Seven matron mothers turned suddenly suspicious gazes on Matron Baenre, and even her own daughters did not know what she was about. Then the stalactite hit. Drizzt caught Catti-brie in midair, then he, too, was flying. He rolled over as the two touched down, burying the young woman under him protectively They were both screaming, but neither heard anything beyond the thunderous roar of the widening fireball. Drizzt\u0027s back warmed, and his cloak ignited in several places as the very edge of the firestorm rolled over him. Then it was done as quickly as it had begun. Drizzt rolled off Catti-brie, scrambled to get out of his burning cloak, and rushed to get to his still down companion, fearing that she had been knocked unconscious, or worse, in the explosion. Catti-brie opened a blue eye and flashed a wistful, mischievous smile. \"I\u0027m betting that the way is clear behind us, \" she smirked and Drizzt nearly laughed aloud. He scooped her up in his arms and hugged her tightly, feeling in that instant as though they might actu ally be free once more. He thought of the times to come in Mithril Hall, times that would be spent beside Bruenor and Regis and Guenhwyvar, and, of course, Catti-brie. Drizzt could not believe all that he had almost thrown away He let Catti-brie go for a moment and rushed back around the bend, just to confirm that all those drow pursuing them were gone. \"Hello, \" Catti-brie whispered under her breath, looking down to a magnificent sword lying next to the fallen weapon master. Catti-brie gingerly picked the weapon up, confused as to why an evil drow noble would wield a sword whose hilt was sculpted in the shape of a unicorn, the symbol of the goodly goddess Mielikki. \"What have you found?\" Drizzt asked, returning calmly \"I think that this one\u0027d suit yerself, \" Catti-brie remarked, hold ing up the weapon to display the unusual pommel. Drizzt stared at the sword curiously He had not noticed that hilt in his fight with Dantrag, though he certainly remembered that blade as the one that had so easily cut through the stone wall. \"You keep it, \" he offered with a shrug. \"I favor the scimitar, and if that is truly a weapon of Mielikki, then she would be pleased to have it on the hip of Catti-brie.\" Catti-brie saluted Drizzt, smiled widely, and slipped the sword into her belt. She turned about, hearing Entreri\u0027s return, as Drizzt bent over Dantrag\u0027s body and quietly slipped the bracers off the dead drow\u0027s wrists. \"We cannot delay!\" the obviously flustered assassin snapped. \"All of Menzoberranzan knows of us now, and a thousand miles will not be enough ground between me and that wretched city\" For perhaps the first time, Drizzt found that he completely agreed with the assassin. Belted as it was on the hip of the human woman was not exactly what the sentient Khazid\u0027hea had in mind. The sword had heard much talk of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and, upon Dantrag\u0027s defeat, had altered the appearance of its magical pommel so that it might rest in the grasp of the legendary warrior. Drizzt hadn\u0027t taken the bait, but the sword that had rightfully earned the name Cutter could wait. The going was smooth, with no pursuit evident for the rest of that day and long into the night. Finally the group had no choice but to stop and rest, but it was a fitful and nervous time indeed. So it went for three days of running, putting the miles behind them. Drizzt kept the lead, and kept the companions far from Bling denstone, fearful of involving the svirfnebli in any of this incredible and dangerous web. He could not understand why lizard riding drow patrols had not overtaken them, could hardly believe that scores of dark elves were not crouched in corridors behind them, or on their flanks, waiting to spring an ambush. Thus, Drizzt was not surprised to see a familiar, outrageous dark elf standing in the middle of the corridor, wide brimmed hat in hand, waiting to greet him and his fleeing companions. Catti-brie, still seething, still on her warrior\u0027s edge, brought Taulmaril up immediately \"Ye\u0027re not for running free this time, \" she muttered under her breath, remembering how the crafty Jarlaxle had eluded them after the fight in Mithril Hall. Entreri grabbed the arrow before Catti-brie had bent the bow, and the young woman, seeing that Drizzt was making no move to go for his weapons, did not continue. \"Please, dear and beautiful woman, \" the mercenary said to her. \"I have only come out to say farewell.\" His words grated on Catti-brie\u0027s nerves, but at the same time, she could not deny that Jarlaxle had treated her with dignity, had not abused her when she had been his helpless prisoner. \"From my perspective, that would seem a strange thing, \" Drizzt remarked, taking care to keep his voice calm. He felt in the pouch for the onyx figurine, but took little comfort in its presence, knowing that if he found the need to summon Guenhwyvar, they would all likely die. Both Drizzt and Entreri, understanding the methods of Bregan D\u0027aerthe and the precautions of its elusive leader, knew that they were surrounded by skilled warriors in overwhelming numbers. \"Perhaps I was not so opposed to your escape, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, as you seem to think, \" Jarlaxle replied, and there was no doubt in anyone\u0027s mind that he had aimed that remark directly at Artemis Entreri. Entreri did not seem surprised by the claim. Everything had fallen neatly into place for the assassin, Catti-brie\u0027s circlet and the locket that helped to locate Drizzt; the spider mask; Jarlaxle\u0027s refer ences to the yulnerability of House Baenre during the high ritual; even the panther figurine, waiting for him to take it, on Jarlaxle\u0027s desk. He did not know how purposeful and involved Jarlaxle had been in arranging things, but he certainly understood that the mer cenary had anticipated what might come to pass. \"You betrayed your own people, \" the assassin said. \"My own people?\" Jarlaxle balked. \"Define that term, people.\" Jarlaxle paused a few moments, then laughed, hearing no answer to his request. \"I did not cooperate with the plans of one matron mother, \" he corrected. \"The first matron mother, \" Entreri put in. \"For now, \" the mercenary added with a wistful smile. \"Not all the drow of Menzoberranzan were so pleased by the alliance Baenre had formed, not even all of Matron Baenre\u0027s own family\" \"Triel, \" Entreri said, more to Drizzt than to the mercenary \"Among others, \" said Jarlaxle. \"What\u0027re the two talking about?\" Catti-brie whispered to Drizzt, who only shrugged, not understanding the larger picture. \"We are discussing the fate of Mithril Hall, \" Jarlaxle explained to her. \"I commend your aim, dear and beautiful lady\" He swept into a graceful bow that, for some reason, made Catti-brie more than a little uncomfortable. Jarlaxle looked to Drizzt. \"I would pay dearly for a glimpse of the expressions worn by those matron mothers inside the Baenre chapel when your lovely companion\u0027s stalactite spear plunged through the roof!\" Both Drizzt and Entreri turned to stare at Catti-brie, who just shrugged and smiled innocently \"You didn\u0027t kill many drow, \" Jarlaxle quickly added. \"Only a handful in the chapel, and no more than two dozen throughout your entire escape. House Baenre will recover, though it may take a while to figure out how to extract your handiwork from their no longer perfectly domed ceiling! House Baenre will recover.\" \"But the alliance, \" Drizzt remarked, beginning to understand why no drow other than Bregan D\u0027aerthe had come into the tunnels in pursuit. \"Yes, the alliance, \" Jarlaxle replied, offering no explanation. \"In truth, the alliance to go after Mithril Hall was dead the minute that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was taken captive. \"But the questions!\" Jarlaxle continued. \"So many to be answered. That is why I have come out, of course.\" The three companions looked to each other, not understanding what the mercenary might be hinting at. \"You have something that I must return, \" Jarlaxle explained, looking directly at Entreri. He held out his empty hand. \"You will turn it over.\" \"And if we don\u0027t?\" Catti-brie demanded fiercely Jarlaxle laughed. The assassin immediately produced the spider mask. Of course Jarlaxle would need to put it back in Sorcere, else he would be implicated in the escape. Jarlaxle\u0027s eyes gleamed when he saw the item, the one piece left to put into his completed puzzle. He suspected that Triel Baenre had watched Entreri and Catti-brie\u0027s every step when they had gone into Sorcere to pilfer the thing. Jarlaxle\u0027s actions in guiding the assassin to the mask, though, in precipitating the escape of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, were perfectly in line with the eldest Baenre daughter\u0027s desires. He took faith that she would not betray him to her mother. If he could just get that mask back into Sorcere, no difficult feat, before Gromph Baenre realized that it was missing. Entreri looked to Drizzt, who had no answers, then tossed the mask to Jarlaxle. Almost as an afterthought, the mercenary reached up and took a ruby pendant off his neck. \"It is not so effective against drow nobles, \" he explained dryly, and threw it unexpectedly to Drizzt. Drizzt\u0027s hand snapped out, too soon, and the pendant, Regis\u0027s pendant, slapped against the ranger\u0027s forearm. Quick as could be, Drizzt snapped his hand back in, catching the thing before it had fallen half an inch. \"Dantrag\u0027s bracers, \" Jarlaxle said with a laugh as he noticed the ranger\u0027s covered wrist. \"I had suspected as much of them. Fear not, for you will get used to them, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, and then how much more formidable you will be!\" Drizzt said nothing, but didn\u0027t doubt the mercenary\u0027s words. Entreri, not yet free of his rivalry with Drizzt, eyed the ranger dangerously, not the least bit pleased. \"And so you have defeated Matron Baenre\u0027s plans, \" Jarlaxle went on grandly, sweeping into another bow. \"And you, assassin, have earned your freedom. But look ever over your shoulders, dar ing friends, for the memories of dark elves are long and the methods of dark elves are devious.\" There came an explosion, a blast of orange smoke, and when it cleared, Jarlaxle was gone. \"And good riddance to ye, \" Catti-brie muttered. \"As I will say to you when we part company on the surface, \" Entreri promised grimly \"Only because Catti-brie gave you her word, \" Drizzt replied, his tone equally grave. He and Entreri locked uncompromising stares, looks of pure hatred, and Catti-brie, standing between them, felt uncomfortable indeed. With the immediate threat of Menzoberranzan apparently behind them, it seemed as though the old enemies had become ene mies again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-28.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
