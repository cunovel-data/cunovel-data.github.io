{"id":94179,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Catti-brie and Entreri spent a long moment staring at each other, alone for the first time since her capture, in the small room at Bregan D\u0027aerthe\u0027s secret complex. By the expression on Entreri\u0027s face, Catti-brie knew that he was up to something.\n He held his hand up before him and shifted his fingers, and the Cat\u0027s Eye agate dropped to the end of its silver chain.\n Catti-brie stared at it curiously, unsure of the assassin\u0027s motives. He had stolen it from Jarlaxle\u0027s pocket, of course, but why would he risk a theft from so dangerous a dark elf?\n \"Ye\u0027re as much a prisoner as I am, \" Catti-brie finally reasoned. \"He\u0027s got ye caught here to do his bidding.\"\n \"I do not like that word, \" Entreri replied, \"prisoner. It implies a helpless state, and I assure you, I am never helpless.\"\n He was nine parts bravado, one part hope, Catti-brie knew, but she kept the thought to herself.\n \"And what are ye to do when Jarlaxle finds it missing?\" she asked.\n \"I shall be dancing on the surface by that time, \" the assassin replied coolly.\n Catti-brie studied him. There it was, spoken plainly and clearly, beyond intrigue. But why the circlet? she continued to wonder, and then she grew suddenly afraid. Entreri may have decided that its starlight was preferable to, or complementary to, his infravision. But he would not have told her that he meant to go if he meant to leave her behind, alive.\n \"Ye do not need the thing, \" Catti-brie reasoned, trying to keep her voice steady. \"Ye\u0027ve been given the infravision and can see yer way well enough.\"\n \"But you need it, \" Entreri said, tossing the circlet to the young woman. Catti-brie caught it and held it in her hands, trying to weigh the consequences of putting it on.\n \"I cannot lead ye to the surface, \" she said, thinking that the assassin had miscalculated. \"I found me way down only because I had the panther and the locket showing me the way to follow Drizzt.\"\n The assassin didn\u0027t blink.\n \"I said I cannot lead ye out o\u0027 here, \" Catti-brie reiterated.\n \"Drizzt can, \" Entreri said. \"I offer you a deal, one that you are in no position to refuse. I will get both you and Drizzt out of Menzo berranzan, and you two will escort me back to the surface. Once there, we go our separate ways, and may they stay separate through all eternity.\"\n Catti-brie took a long moment to digest the startling proposl tion. \"Ye\u0027re thinking that I\u0027m to trust ye?\" she asked, but Entreri didn\u0027t answer, didn\u0027t have to answer. Catti-brie sat imprisoned in a room surrounded by fierce drow enemies, and Drizzt\u0027s predicament was likely even worse. Whatever the evil Entreri might offer her, it could be no worse than the alternatives.\n \"What about Guenhwyvar?\" Catti-brie asked. \"And me bow?\"\n \"I\u0027ve the bow and quiver, \" Entreri answered. \"Jarlaxle has the panther.\"\n \"I\u0027ll not leave without Guenhwyvar, \" Catti-brie said.\n Entreri looked at her incredulously, as if he thought she were bluffing.\n Catti-brie threw the circlet to his feet. She hopped up on the edge of a small table and crossed her arms defiantly over her chest.\n Entreri looked down to the item, then to Catti-brie. \"I could make you leave, \" he promised.\n \"If ye think ye could, then ye\u0027re thinking wrong, \" Catti-brie answered. \"I\u0027m guessing that ye\u0027ll need me help and cooperation to get through this place, and I\u0027m not to give it to ye, not for meself and not for Drizzt, without the cat.\n \"And know ye that Drizzt will agree with me choice, \" Catti-brie went on, hammering home the point. \"Guenhwyvar \u0027s a friend to us both, and we\u0027re not for leaving friends behind!\"\n Entreri hooked his toe under a loop in the circlet and casually flipped it across the room to Catti-brie, who caught it once more and, this time, put it on her head. Without another word, the assas sin motioned for the woman to sit tight, and he abruptly left the room.\n The single guard outside Jarlaxle\u0027s private room showed little interest in the approaching human; Entreri practically had to prod the drow to get his attention. Then the assassin pointed to the strange, flowing door and asked, \"Jarlaxle?\"\n The soldier shook his head.\n Entreri pointed again to the watery door, his eyes suddenly popping wide with surprise. When the soldier leaned over to see what was wrong, the assassin grabbed him across the shoulders and heaved him through the portal, both of them slipping through, into the watery corridor. Entreri tugged and twisted in a slow motion wrestling match with the surprised drow. He was bigger than this one, and equally agile, and gradually made progress in moving the guard along.\n They plunged out the other side, falling into Jarlaxle\u0027s room. The drow went for his sword, but Entreri\u0027s left hook staggered him. A quick combination of punches followed, and when the drow went down to one knee, the assassin\u0027s foot slammed hard against his cheek.\n Entreri half dragged, half carried the drow to the side of the room, where he slammed him against the wall. He slugged him sev eral times to make sure that he would offer no further resistance. Soon he had the dark elf helpless, down on his knees, barely con scious, with his hands tied behind his back and his mouth tightly gagged. He pinned the drow against the wall and felt about for a releasing mechanism. The door to a secret cubby slid open, and Entreri forced the drow inside.\n Entreri considered whether or not to kill this one. On the one hand, if he killed the drow, there would be no witnesses and Jarlaxle would have to spend some time figuring out who had committed the crime. Something held Entreri\u0027s dagger hand in check, though, some instinct that told him to proceed with this operation cleanly, with no losses to Bregan D\u0027aerthe.\n It was all too easy, Entreri realized when he found not only the figurine of Guenhwyvar, but Catti-brie\u0027s magical mask as well, waiting for him, yes, waiting for him!, on Jarlaxle\u0027s desk. Entreri picked them up gingerly, looking for some devious traps nearby and checking to make sure that these were the genuine items.\n Something strange was going on.\n Entreri considered the not so subtle hints that Jarlaxle had been dropping, the fact that the mercenary had taken him to Sorcere and conveniently showed him the way to the spider mask. He reached into a pocket and took out the magical locket of Alustriel, the hom ing beacon to Drizzt Do\u0027Urden that Jarlaxle had casually tossed to him. Jarlaxle had even managed to slip in the proper time for the attempt, the early hours of the high ritual being celebrated at House Baenre this very night.\n What was it all about? Entreri wondered. Jarlaxle had some pri vate agenda, one that apparently went against House Baenre\u0027s designs on Mithril Hall. Standing there in the mercenary\u0027s office, it seemed obvious to Entreri that Jarlaxle had set him up as a pawn.\n Entreri clutched the locket tightly, then thrust it back into his pocket. Very well, he decided. He would be an effective pawn indeed.\n Twenty minutes later, Entreri, using the magical mask to appear as a drow soldier, and Catti-brie moved quietly and swiftly along the winding ways of Menzoberranzan, cutting a northeastern path along the stalagmite mounds, toward the higher level of Tier Breche and the drow Academy.\n He saw again the tiered steps of the great dwarven Undercity, the heart of Mithril Hall. He imagined the entryway from the west ern gate, through Keeper\u0027s Dale, and pictured again the great chasm known as Garumn\u0027s Gorge.\n Drizzt fought hard to warp those images, to distort the truth about Mithril Hall, but the details were so clear to him! It was as if he were there again, walking freely beside Bruenor and the others. In the throes of the mind flayer\u0027s hypnosis, Drizzt found himself overwhelmed. He had no more barriers to stack against the mental intrusion of Matron Baenre\u0027s pet, no more willpower against the mental giant.\n As the images came to Drizzt, he felt them stripped away, men tally scraped from his brain, like so much food for the wretched illithid. Each intrusion burned painfully, shot electrical shocks along the synaptical connections of the drow ranger\u0027s mind.\n Finally Drizzt felt the creature\u0027s insidious tentacles loosening their grip on the skin of his forehead, and he slumped, his mind a jumble of confusing images and his head throbbing with agony.\n \"We have gained some information this day, \" he heard the distant, watery voice say\n Gained some information...\n The words rang over and over ominously in Drizzt\u0027s mind. The illithid and Matron Baenre were still talking, but he was not listen ing, concentrating on those three words, remembering the implica tions of those three terrible words.\n Drizzt\u0027s lavender orbs slipped open, but he kept his head bowed, covertly peeking at Methil. The creature had its back to him, was only a couple of feet away\n The illithid now knew part of the layout of Mithril Hall, and its continuous intrusions into Drizzt\u0027s mind would soon show it the entire complex.\n Drizzt could not let that happen; slowly the drow\u0027s hands clenched more tightly on the chains.\n Drizzt\u0027s bare foot came up, his heel slamming the wretched creature\u0027s spongy head. Before Methil could move away, the ranger wrapped his legs about Methil\u0027s neck in a choke hold and began thrashing back and forth, trying to snap the thing\u0027s neck.\n Drizzt felt the tentacles probing for his skin, felt them boring into his legs, but he fought away his revulsion and thrashed wildly He saw wicked Vendes coming around the side and knew what would come, but he concentrated on his task. For the sake of his friends, Methil had to be killed!\n The illithid threw its weight straight back, trying to confuse Drizzt and break the hold, but the skilled drow ranger turned with the move and Methil fell to the ground, half slumped against the wall and half held aloft by Drizzt\u0027s strong hold. Drizzt heaved him up and slammed him back, releasing the ineffective choke. Illithids were not physically imposing creatures, and Methil raised his three fingered hands pitifully, trying to fend the sudden barrage of stomping feet.\n Something hard slammed Drizzt at the base of his ribs, stealing his breath. He stubbornly continued to stomp, but was slammed again, then a third time and a fourth.\n Hanging limply from the chains, the ranger tried to curl up to protect the area as Vendes hammered away Drizzt thought that he was surely dead when he looked into the furious eyes of wicked Duk Tak, which were filled with a mixture of venom and hatred and ecstacy, as she was allowed to vent that perpetual fury\n She stopped, sooner than Drizzt dared to hope, and calmly walked away, leaving Drizzt hanging from the shackles, trying to curl but unable to find the strength.\n Methil had joined Matron Baenre, who sat comfortably on her driftdisk, and was looking back at Drizzt with his pupilless, milky white eyes.\n Drizzt knew that the next time the illithid encroached on his mind, Methil would go out of his way to make the pain even more intense.\n \"No potion for him, \" Matron Baenre instructed Dantrag, standing impassively by the door. Dantrag followed his mother\u0027s gaze to sev eral flasks along the wall to Drizzt\u0027s left and nodded.\n \"Dobluth, \" she said to Drizzt, using the derisive drow word for outcast. \"The high ritual will be better served with our knowledge that you are here in agony.\" She nodded to Vendes, who wheeled about, hurling a small dart as she turned.\n It caught Drizzt in the stomach, and he felt a small but stinging pinch. Then his entire belly felt as if it had ignited into roaring fires. He gagged, tried to scream, then sheer agony gave him the strength to curl up. The change in posture didn\u0027t help. The magical little dart continued to pump its droplets of poison into him, continued to burn at his insides.\n Through tear filled eyes, Drizzt saw the driftdisk slide from his cell, Vendes and Methil obediently following Matron Baenre. Dantrag, expressionless, remained leaning against the doorjamb for some time, then walked over near Drizzt.\n Drizzt forced himself to stop screaming, and merely groaned and grunted through gritted teeth with the weapon master standing so close to him.\n \"You are a fool, \" Dantrag said. \"If your attempts force my mother to kill you before I get the chance, I promise you that I will personally torture and slaughter every living creature that calls itself a friend of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden!\"\n Again with speed that defied Drizzt\u0027s vision, Dantrag smacked Drizzt across the face. The ranger hung limp for just a second, then was forced to curl up again as the fiery explosions of the poisoned dart erupted across his stomach.\n Out of sight, around the corner at the base of the wide stairs lead ing to TIer Breche, Artemis Entreri tried hard to recall an image of Gromph Baenre, the archmage of the city. He had seen Gromph only a few times, mostly while spying for Jarlaxle. (Jarlaxle had thought that the archmage was shortening the nights in Menzoberranzan by lighting the lingering heat fires in the time clock of Narbondel a few instants too soon, and was interested in what the dangerous wizard might be up to, and so he had sent Entreri to spy on the drow.)\n Entreri\u0027s cloak changed to the flowing robes of the wizard; his hair became thicker and longer, a great white mane, and subtle, barely visible wrinkles appeared about his eyes.\n \"I cannot believe ye\u0027re trying this, \" Catti-brie said to him when he moved out of the shadows.\n \"The spider mask is in Gromph\u0027s desk, \" the assassin answered coldly, not thrilled with the prospects either. \"There is no other way into House Baenre.\"\n \"And if this Gromph is sitting at his desk?\"\n \"Then you and I will be scattered all over the cavern, \" Entreri answered gruffly, and he swept by the young woman, grabbed her hand, and pulled her up the wide stairway\n Entreri was counting as much on luck as on skill. He knew that Sorcere, the school of wizards, was full of reclusive masters who generally stayed out of each other\u0027s way, and he could only hope that Gromph, though only a male, had been invited to House Baenre\u0027s high ritual. The walls of the secretive place were protected against scrying and against teleportation, and if his disguise worked against whatever magical barriers might be in place, he should be able to get in and out of Gromph\u0027s room without too much interfer ence. The city\u0027s archmage was known as a surly one, with a violent temper; no one got in Gromph\u0027s way\n At the top of the stairway, on the level of Tier Breche, the com panions saw the three structures of the drow Academy. To their right was the plain, pyramidal structure of Melee Magthere, the school of fighters. Directly ahead loomed the most impressive struc ture, the great spider shaped building of Arach Tinilith, the school of Lloth. Entreri was glad that he did not have to try to enter either of those buildings. Melee Magthere was a place of swarming guardsmen and tight control, and Arach Tinilith was protected by the high priestesses of Lloth, working in concert for the good of their Spider Queen. Only the gracefully spired structure to the left, Sorcere, was secretive enough to penetrate.\n Catti-brie pulled her arm away and nearly bolted in sheer terror. She had no disguise and felt totally vulnerable up here. The young woman found her courage, though, and did not resist when Entreri roughly grabbed her arm once more and tugged her along at a great pace.\n They walked into Sorcere\u0027s open front doorway, where two guards promptly blocked their way One started to ask Entreri a question, but the assassin slapped him across the face and pushed past, hoping that Gromph\u0027s cruel reputation would get them through.\n The bluff worked, and the guards went back to their posts, not even daring to mutter to themselves until the archmage was far away\n Entreri remembered the twisting ways perfectly and soon came to the plain wall flanking Gromph\u0027s private chambers. He took a deep breath and looked to his companion, silently reiterating his feelings that if Gromph was behind this door, they were both surely dead.\n \"Kolsen\u0027shea orbb, \" the assassin whispered. To Entreri\u0027s relief, the wall began to stretch and twist, becoming a spiderweb. The strands rotated, leaving the hole and revealing the soft blue glow, and Entreri quickly (before he lost his nerve) rushed through and pulled Catti-brie in behind him.\n Gromph was not inside.\n Entreri made for the dwarf bone desk, rubbing his hands together and blowing in them before reaching for the appropriate drawer. Catti-brie, meanwhile, intrigued by the obviously magical paraphernalia, walked about, eyeing parchments (from a distance), even going over to one ceramic bottle and daring to pop off its cork.\n Entreri\u0027s heart leaped into his throat when he heard the arch mage\u0027s voice, but he relaxed when he realized that it came from the bottle.\n Catti-brie looked at the bottle and the cork curiously, then popped the cork back on, eliminating the voice. \"What was that?\" she asked, not understanding a word of the Drow language.\n \"I know not, \" Entreri replied harshly \"Do not touch anything!\"\n Catti-brie shrugged as the assassin went back to his work on the desk, trying to make sure that he uttered the password for the drawer perfectly He recalled his conversation with Jarlaxle, when the mercenary had given him the word. Had Jarlaxle been honest, or was this whole thing part of some elaborate game? Had Jarlaxle baited him to this place, so that he might speak some false word, open the drawer, and destroy himself and half of Sorcere? It occurred to Entreri that Jarlaxle might have put a phony replica of the spider mask in the drawer, then tricked Entreri into coming here and setting off Gromph\u0027s powerful wards, thus destroying the evi dence.\n Entreri shook the disturbing thoughts away He had committed himself to this course, had convinced himself that his attempt to free Drizzt was somehow part of the framework of Jarlaxle\u0027s grand plans, whatever they might be, and he could not surrender to his fears now. He uttered the phrase and pulled open the drawer.\n The spider mask was waiting for him.\n Entreri scooped it up and turned to Catti-brie, who had filled the top of a small hourglass with fine white sand and was watching it slip away with the moments. Entreri leaped from the dwarf bone desk and scrambled across the room, tipping the item to the side.\n Catti-brie eyed him curiously\n \"I was keeping the time, \" she said calmly\n \"This is no timepiece!\" the assassin roughly explained. He tipped the hourglass upside down and carefully removed the sand, replacing it in its packet and gently resealing it. \"It is an explosive, and when the sand runs out, all the area bursts into flame. You must not touch anything!\" he scolded harshly. \"Gromph will not even know that we have been here if all is in proper order.\" Entreri looked around at the jumbled room as he spoke. \"Or, at least, in proper disorder. He was not here when Jarlaxle returned the spider mask.\"\n Catti-brie nodded and appeared genuinely ashamed, but it was only a facade. The young woman had suspected the general, if not the exact, nature of the hourglass all along, and would not have let the sand rim out. She had only started it running to get some confir mation from the worldly Entreri.\n The two quickly departed the wizard\u0027s room and Sorcere. Catti brie did not let on that she had several more of those dangerous hourglasses, and their corresponding packets of detonating sand, tucked into a belt pouch. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-22.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night \n Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
