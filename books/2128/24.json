{"id":94181,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"She reached for an arrow, then shifted her bow out in front of her in defense as a glob of greenish goo erupted from the wand and flew at her.\n Catti-brie\u0027s bow was suddenly tight against her chest, and she was flying, to smack hard against the wall. One arm was pinned tightly against her chest, the other tightly to her hip, and she could not move her legs. She could not even fall from the wall!\n She tried to call out, but her jaw would not work, and one eye would not open. She could see, barely, with the other eye, and she somehow managed to continue to draw breath.\n Entreri spun about, sword and dagger coming to the ready. He dove to the side, to the middle of the room, in front of Catti-brie, when he saw the three drow females enter, two of them aiming loaded hand crossbows his way.\n The agile assassin rolled back to his feet and started forward, rising up as if he would leap into his attackers. Then he dove low, sword leading.\n The skilled drow females held their shots through the assassin\u0027s feint, then brought their hands in line. The first dart hit Entreri\u0027s shoulder and jolted him more than he would have expected. Sud denly, his momentum was stolen and he was standing straighter. Black arcs of electricity, writhing like sparking tentacles, shot out from the dart, burning him, jolting him back a few steps.\n The second dart got him in the belly and, though the initial hit did not pain the assassin too greatly, a huge electrical blast followed, hurling him backward to the floor. His sword went flying, narrowly missing the trapped Catti-brie.\n Entreri came to a stop at the young woman\u0027s feet. He still clutched his jeweled dagger, and thought immediately that he might have to throw the thing. But he could only watch in astonish ment as the fingers of that hand twitched involuntarily, his grasp on the dagger weakening. He willed his arm to heave the blade, but his muscles would not respond, and the dagger soon toppled out of his trembling hand.\n He lay on the stone at Catti-brie\u0027s feet, confused and scared. For the first time in his life, those finely honed warrior muscles would not answer his call.\n It was the third female, in the middle of the trio, that held Drizzt\u0027s attention: Vendes Baenre, Duk Tak, his merciless torturer for all these long days. Drizzt stood very still, holding the coat of chain mail in front of him, not even daring to blink. The females flanking the cruel Baenre daughter put away their hand crossbows and drew two shining swords each.\n Drizzt expected to be blown away, or held by some magical intrusion, as Vendes quickly chanted under her breath.\n \"Valiant friends, \" the wicked noble remarked sarcastically, using perfect surface Common.\n Drizzt understood the nature of her spell then, a dweomer that allowed her to communicate with Entreri and Catti-brie.\n Entreri\u0027s mouth moved weirdly, and the expression on his face revealed what he was trying to say more than any decipherable words. \"High ritual?\"\n \"Indeed, \" Vendes replied. \"My mother and sisters, and many visiting matron mothers, are gathered in the chapel. I was excused from the initial ceremonies and was instructed to bring Drizzt Do\u0027Urden in to them later.\" She eyed Drizzt and seemed perfectly content. \"I see that your friends have saved me the trouble of for cing the healing potions down your throat.\n \"Did you really expect to so easily walk into House Baenre, steal our most valuable prisoner, and walk out?\" Vendes asked Entreri. \"You were seen before you ever crossed the web fence, and there will be inquiries as to how you got your unclean hands on my brother\u0027s mask! Gromph, or perhaps that dangerous Jarlaxle, will have many questions to answer.\n \"I am surprised at you, too, assassin, \" she went on. \"Your repu tation precedes you, I would have expected a better performance. Did you not understand the significance of mere males guarding our prized catch?\"\n She looked to Drizzt and shook her head. \"Those pretend guards I put in place were expendable, of course, \" she said. Drizzt made no move, showed no reply in his features. He felt the strength returning to him as the healing potions did their work, but that strength would make little difference, he realized, facing the likes of Vendes and two supremely armed and trained females. The ranger looked to his coat of armor disdainfully, it would do him little good held in his hands.\n Entreri\u0027s mind was working more clearly now, but his body was not. The electrical impulses continued, defeating any coordinated attempt at movement. He did manage to drop one hand into his pouch, though, in response to something Vendes had said, some hint at fleeting hope.\n \"We suspected that the human woman was alive, \" Vendes explained, \"in the clutches of Jarlaxle, most likely, and we hardly hoped that she would be so easily delivered to us.\n Entreri had to wonder if Jarlaxle had double crossed him. Had the mercenary concocted this elaborate plan for no better reason than to deliver Catti-brie to House Baenre? It made no sense to Entreri, but little about Jarlaxle\u0027s actions these last hours made sense to him.\n The mention of Catti-brie brought a measure of fire to Drizzt\u0027s eyes. He couldn\u0027t believe that the young woman was here, in Men zoberranzan, that she had risked so much to come after him. Where was Guenhwyvar? he wondered. And had Bruenor or Regis come along beside Catti-brie?\n He winced as he eyed the young woman, wrapped in greenish goo. How vulnerable she seemed, how utterly helpless.\n The fires burned brighter in Drizzt\u0027s lavender eyes when he returned his gaze to Vendes. Gone was his fear of his torturer; gone was his resignation about how things had to end.\n In one swift motion, Drizzt dropped the suit of armor and snapped out his scimitars.\n On a nod from Vendes, the two females were on Drizzt, one cir cling to each side. One tapped her sword against Twinkle\u0027s curving blade, indicating that Drizzt should drop the weapon. He looked down to Twinkle, and all logic told him to comply.\n He spun the scimitar in a wild arc instead, swishing the female\u0027s sword aside. His second blade came up suddenly, defeating a thrust from the other side before it ever began.\n \"0 fool!\" Vendes cried at him in obvious glee. \"I do so wish to see you fight, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, since Dantrag is so intent on slaughtering you!\"\n The way she said it made Drizzt wonder who Vendes would want to win that potential fight. He had no time to ponder the con tinuing intrigue of the chaotic world, though, not with two drow females pressing him so.\n Vendes reverted to the Drow language then, commanding her soldiers to beat Drizzt fiercely, but not to kill him.\n Drizzt turned a sudden spin, like a screw, his blades weaving a dangerous pattern on all sides. He came out of it suddenly, viciously, snapping a thrust at the female on his left. He scored a minor hit, doing no real damage against the fabulous drow armor, armor that Drizzt was not wearing.\n That point was driven home by the tip of a sword that then nicked Drizzt from the right. He grimaced and pivoted back, his backhanded cut taking the sword away before it could do any real damage.\n Entreri prayed that Vendes was as intent on the fight as her sol diers, for every movement he made seemed so very clumsy and obvious. Somehow, he managed to get the spider mask out of his pouch and over his trembling hand, and then he reached up and grabbed Catti-brie\u0027s belt.\n His trembling fingers could not support the hold, though, and he fell back to the floor.\n Vendes glanced casually his way, snickered, apparently not noticing the mask, and turned back to the fight.\n Entreri sat half propped by the wall, trying to find some inner control to ward off the nasty drow enchantment, but all his efforts proved useless; his muscles continued their involuntary twitching.\n Swords cut in at Drizzt from every angle. One drew a line on his cheek, stinging him painfully. The skilled females, working per fectly in concert, kept him pinned near the corner, gave him no room to maneuver. Still, Drizzt\u0027s parrying work was excellent, and Vendes applauded his outstanding, if futile, efforts.\n Drizzt knew that he was in serious trouble. Unarmored and still weak (though the magical potions continued to flow through his veins), he had few tricks that could get him past so powerful a tan dem.\n A sword cut low; Drizzt hopped the blade. Another chopped down, from the other side, but Drizzt, crouching as he leaped, got Twinkle up to deflect it. His other scimitar snapped back and forth in front of him, defeating the two middle height attacks, one from each female, and completing the four parry.\n But Drizzt could not counter with any offensive routines as the relentless barrage continued, forcing him back on his heels, forcing him to react in awkward angles.\n He hopped and ducked, spun his blades this way and that, and somehow managed to keep those stinging swords from cutting any deep holes in his vulnerable body, though the minor hits were beginning to add up.\n The ranger glanced forlornly at Catti-brie, terrified at the prospects of what she would soon face.\n Entreri continued to wage his futile war, then finally slumped low, defeated, thinking that he could not possibly fight his way past the powerful enchantment.\n But the assassin had not survived the streets of dangerous Calimport, had not risen to a position of leadership in the evil underworld of the southern city, by accepting defeat. He changed his thinking, decided that he had to work within the parameters offered to him.\n Entreri\u0027s arm shot up above him. His fingers did not grasp, he did not try to grasp, but rather, he slapped his arm hard against the binding goo.\n That was all the grip he would need.\n With tremendous effort, Entreri coiled his stuck arm and pulled himself halfway up beside the trapped woman.\n Catti-brie was watching him, helpless and hopeless, having no idea what he meant to do. She even winced and tried to duck (though of course her head would not move an inch) as the assas sin\u0027s free arm swung about, as though she feared that he meant to strike her.\n It was not the jeweled dagger perched in that free hand, though, but the spider mask, and Catti-brie began to understand as it came over the very top of her head. It wouldn\u0027t slip down very far at first, blocked by the binding goo, but that greenish sludge instantly began to give way to the item\u0027s mighty magic.\n Catti-brie was fully blinded as a wave of goo, then the bottom lip of the spider mask, covered her one free eye.\n A moment later, her other eye blinked open.\n Sparks flew as the battle intensified, the females pressing more fiercely against the stubborn defenses of the renegade male.\n \"Be done with it!\" impatient Vendes growled. \"Take him down, that we might drag him to the chapel, that he might bear witness as we sacrifice the foolish woman to Lloth!\"\n Of all the things that Vendes could have said, of all the threats that she could have then laid upon Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, none would have been so foolish. The notion of Catti-brie, dear and innocent Catti-brie, being given to the horrid, wretched Spider Queen was too much for Drizzt\u0027s sensibilities to bear.\n No longer was he Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, for his rational identity was replaced by the welling urges of the primal hunter, the savage.\n The female on his left came with another measured counter, but the one on his right struck more daringly, one of her swords thrust ing far beyond the tip of Drizzt\u0027s blocking scimitar.\n It was a cunning move, but in the heightened sensibilities of the hunter, that thrusting sword seemed to move almost in slow motion. Drizzt let the tip get within a few inches of his vulnerable abdomen before the blade in his left hand slashed across, deflecting the sword out wide, crossing under his upraised arm as his other scimitar worked against the female\u0027s second sword.\n His scimitars then crossed in a powerful diagonal parry, alter nating their targets, his left arm shooting across and up, his right across and down.\n He dove to his knees, straight ahead, using his closest enemy\u0027s body to prevent the other female from hitting him. In came his right hand, deftly turning the blade so that it slashed against the outside of his opponent\u0027s knee, buckling the leg. Drizzt punched out with his left, connecting on the female\u0027s belly and throwing her back over that collapsing leg.\n Still on his knees, the ranger spun desperately, hacking across with his left as the other female rushed in on him.\n She was too high. The scimitar took one sword out wide, but the other sword poked lower.\n The hunter\u0027s second scimitar intercepted it and turned it aside, though it slashed Drizzt\u0027s skin and nicked a rib.\n Back and forth went the parries and thrusts, the hunter feeling no pain from this newest and most serious wound. It seemed impossible to Vendes, but Drizzt managed to get a foot under him and was soon standing even with her skilled soldier.\n The other female writhed on the ground, clutching her blasted leg and tucking her arm tightly over her slashed belly.\n \"Enough!\" Vendes cried, holding her wand Drizzt\u0027s way. She had enjoyed the spectacular battle, but had no intention of losing any females.\n \"Guenhwyvar!\" came a shrill cry.\n Vendes looked to the side, to the human woman, wearing the spider mask!, crouching low, away from the binding goo. Catti-brie charged out from the wall, dropping the magical figurine and scooping up a certain dagger as she went.\n Instinctively, Vendes loosed another gob of goo, but it seemed to pass right through the charging woman to splat harmlessly against the wall.\n Somewhat disoriented and certainly off balance, Catti-brie simply dove forward, dagger out. She managed to nick Vendes\u0027 hand, but the parrying wand rushed across and turned the deadly blade before it could dig in.\n Catti-brie crashed heavily into the drow\u0027s thighs, and both females went sprawling, the woman trying to hold on, and Vendes kicking and scrambling fiercely to get away.\n Drizzt\u0027s scimitars banged against the remaining female\u0027s swords so rapidly that it sounded like one long, scraping ring. She kept up with his fury for a few moments, to her credit, but gradually her parries came later and later against the barrage of thrusts and cuts.\n A sword snapped up to her right, defeating Twinkle. Her sec ond sword turned up and out to take the second thrusting scimitar to the side.\n But the second scimitar was not really thrusting, and it was the female\u0027s sword that went out. She recognized the feint and halted her own weapon\u0027s progress, bringing it right back in.\n She was too late. Drizzt\u0027s scimitar plunged through the fine mesh armor. He was open to any counter, but the female had no strength, no life, left as the wicked scimitar jabbed at her heart. She shuddered as Drizzt withdrew the blade.\n A flurry of punches battered Catti-brie\u0027s head as she hugged tightly to the vicious drow\u0027s legs. The spider mask had turned about, and Catti-brie could not see, but she realized that if Vendes had a weapon handy, she would be in trouble.\n Blindly, Catti-brie reached up with one hand, trying to grab at a drow wrist. Vendes was too quick for the move, though, and not only got her arm out of the way, but wriggled one leg free as well. She coiled and kicked, and Catti-brie nearly swooned.\n Vendes pushed powerfully against her, slipping free, then Catti brie was scrambling, trying to catch up to the suddenly receding legs. The young woman hesitated for just an instant, to pull the troublesome mask from her face, then cried out in denial as she saw Vendes\u0027s feet slipping too far from her grasp. The Baenre daughter quickly regained her footing and ran from the room.\n Catti-brie could easily fathom the consequences of letting this one get away. Stubbornly, she put her arms under her and started to rise, but was pushed back to the floor by a gentle hand as someone came over her. She saw the bare feet of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden hit the stone floor in front of her, in full pursuit.\n Drizzt twisted weirdly as he came into the corridor. He threw himself backward and to the floor so fiercely that Catti-brie feared he had been clotheslined. She understood the move as Drizzt\u0027s own doing, though, as a gob of greenish goo flew harmlessly above him.\n A twisting roll realigned Drizzt and put his feet back under him, and he shot off like a springing cat.\n And a springing cat, Guenhwyvar, followed, leaping over Catti brie and into the corridor, turning so perfect an angle, the instant the paws touched the stone, that Catti-brie had to blink to make sure she was not seeing things.\n \"Na u!\" came the doomed drow\u0027s cry of protest from out in the corridor. The warrior whom Vendes had tortured, had beaten with out mercy, was upon her, his eyes raging with fires of vengeance.\n Guenhwyvar came right behind, desperate to help Drizzt, but in the instant it took the cat to reach the fighting, a scimitar had already plunged deep into Vendes\u0027s stomach.\n A groan from the side refocused Catti-brie\u0027s attention. She spot ted the wounded female crawling for her dropped weapons.\n Catti-brie scrambled immediately, staying on the floor, and wrapped her legs about the drow\u0027s neck, squeezing with all her strength. Both ebon skinned hands came up to tear at her, to punch at her. But then the female calmed, and Catti-brie thought she had surrendered, until she noticed the drow\u0027s lips moving.\n She was casting a spell!\n Purely on instinct, Catti-brie poked her finger repeatedly into the drow\u0027s eyes. The chant became cries of pain and protest, and they became no more than a wheeze as Catti-brie clamped her legs down tighter.\n Catti-brie hated this with all her generous heart. The killing revolted her, especially a fight such as this, where she would have to watch for agonizing seconds, minutes perhaps, while she suffocated her opponent.\n She spied Entreri\u0027s dagger not far away and grabbed it. Tears of rage and innocence lost filled her blue eyes as she brought the deadly blade to bear.\n Guenhwyvar skidded to a stop, and Drizzt roughly retracted the embedded blade and took a step back.\n \"Nau?\" stunned Vendes repeated, the drow word for \"no.~~ Vicious Duk Tak seemed little to Drizzt then, almost pitiful. She was doubled over in pain, trembling violently.\n She fell over at Drizzt\u0027s feet. Her mouth moved, forming the denying word one last time, but no sound came from her breathless lips and the red glow left her eyes forever. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-24.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night \n Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
