{"id":94180,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl, the plateau occupied by some of the proud est noble houses, was strangely quiet. Entreri, appear ing as a common drow soldier again, and Catti-brie made their silent and inconspicuous way along the great mushroom grove, toward the twenty foot high spiderweb fence surrounding the Baenre compound.\\n\\n Panic welled in both the companions and neither said a thing, forced themselves to concentrate on the stakes in this game: ulti mate victory or ultimate loss.\\n\\n Crouched in the shadows behind a stalagmite, the two watched as a grand procession, led by several priestesses sitting atop blue glowing driftdisks, made its way through the open compound and toward the great doors of the huge central chapel. Entreri recog nized Matron Baenre and knew that some of the others near her were probably her daughters. He watched the many disks curiously, coming to understand that matron mothers of other houses were in the procession.\\n\\n It was a high ritual, as Jarlaxle had said, and Entreri snickered at how completely the sly mercenary had arranged all of this.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Catti-brie asked, not understanding the private joke.\\n\\n Entreri shook his head and scowled, indicating that the trouble some young woman should shut her mouth. Catti-brie bit her bot tom lip and did not spew the many venomous replies she had in mind. She needed Entreri now, and he needed her; their personal hatred would have to wait.\\n\\n And wait is exactly what Catti-brie and Entreri did. They squat ted behind the mound for many minutes as the long procession gradually disappeared into the domed chapel. Entreri figured that many more than a thousand drow, maybe even two thousand, had gone into the structure, and few soldiers, or lizard riders, could now be seen from his position.\\n\\n Another benefit of their timing soon showed itself as songs to Lloth filtered out of the chapel\u0027s doors, filling the air about the com pound.\\n\\n \"The cat?\" Entreri whispered to Catti-brie.\\n\\n Catti-brie felt the statuette in her pouch and considered the question, then looked doubtfully at the Baenre web fence. \"When we get over, \" she explained, though she had no idea of how Entreri meant to pass that seemingly impenetrable barrier. The strands of the fence were as thick as Catti-brie\u0027s forearm.\\n\\n Entreri nodded his agreement and took out the black velvet spi der mask and slipped it over his head. Catti-brie couldn\u0027t contain a shudder as she regarded the assassin, his head now resembling some grotesque caricature of a huge spider.\\n\\n \"I will warn you only once, \" the assassin whispered. \"You are a merciful one, foolishly so, but there is no place for mercy in the realm of the drow. Do not think to wound or knock unconscious any opponents we cross. Go for the kill.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie didn\u0027t bother to reply, and if Entreri could see into the fires raging inside the young woman, he would not have bothered to utter the remark.\\n\\n He motioned for her to follow, then picked his careful way from shadow to shadow to the base of the fence.\\n\\n Entreri touched the strands tentatively, making certain that his fingers would not stick, then he took a firm hold and bade Catti-brie to climb on his back.\\n\\n \"Take care that you do not touch the fence!\" he warned. \"Else I will have to remove whatever limb you have stuck.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie gingerly took hold of the evil man, wrapping her arms about his chest, one over one shoulder, the other under Entreri\u0027s arm. She clasped her hands tightly and squeezed with all her strength.\\n\\n Entreri was not a big man, not forty pounds heavier than Catti brie herself, but he was strong, his muscles honed for fighting, and he easily began his ascent, keeping his body as far from the danger ous fence as possible so that the young woman\u0027s hands did not get entangled. The trickiest part came at the top of the barrier, particu larly when Entreri spotted a couple of lizard riding soldiers approaching.\\n\\n \"Do not even breathe, \" he warned Catti-brie, and he inched along the top rim of the fence to take as much cover as possible in the shadows of an anchoring stalagmite post.\\n\\n If there had been no lights in the Baenre compound, the two surely would been caught, their warm forms showing distinctively against the cooler stone of the mound. But lights were on, including many burning torches, and the Baenre soldiers were not using their infravision as they walked their posts. They passed by the fence no more than a dozen feet from the two intruders, but so adept at hid ing in the shadows was Artemis Entreri that they never noticed the strange jut in the previously smooth stalagmite.\\n\\n When they were gone, Entreri pulled himself to a standing posi tion atop the fence and twisted to the side, so that Catti-brie could brace herself against the mound. He had only intended to take a short rest, but the young woman, desperate to be on with things, unexpectedly shifted off his back, onto the mound, and half slid, half climbed down its back side, coming to a roll in the Baenre com pound.\\n\\n Entreri hustled down the fence to join her, snapped off the mask, and glared at her, thinking her actions rash and stupid.\\n\\n Catti-brie did not retreat from that look, just eyed the hated assassin dangerously and mouthed, \"Where?\"\\n\\n Entreri slipped a hand into one pocket and felt for the magical locket, then turned about, facing different directions until the item seemed most warm. He had guessed Drizzt\u0027s location before the locket had even confirmed it: the great mound, the best guarded position in the entire compound.\\n\\n They could only hope that most of Baenre\u0027s elite soldiers were attending the high ritual.\\n\\n Crossing the compound to the elaborate structure was not diffi cult, for few guards were apparent, the shadows were many, and the singing emanating from the chapel amply covered any noise. No house would expect an attack, or dare to invoke the Spider Queen\u0027s anger by launching an attack, during a high ritual, and since the only possible threat to House Baenre was from another drow house, security in the compound was not at its highest point.\\n\\n \"In there, \" Entreri whispered as he and Catti-brie came flat against the walls flanking the doorway to the huge, hollowed sta lagmite. Gently, Entreri touched the stone door to try to discern any traps (though he figured that any traps would be magical in nature and he would find them when they blew up in his face). To his sur prise, the portal suddenly rose, disappearing into a crack in the top of the jamb and revealing a narrow, dimly lit corridor.\\n\\n He and Catti-brie exchanged doubtful looks, and after a long, silent pause, both stepped in together, and both nearly fell over with relief when they realized that they were still alive in the corri dor.\\n\\n Their relief was not long lived, however, for it was stolen by a guttural call, a question, perhaps. Before the pair could decipher any of the words, the form of a huge, muscular humanoid, easily seven feet tall and as wide as the five foot corridor, stepped into the other end, almost completely stealing the diminutive light. The crea ture\u0027s sheer bulk, and its distinctive, bull like head, revealed its identity\\n\\n Catti-brie nearly jumped out of her boots when the door slid closed behind her.\\n\\n The minotaur grunted the question again, in the Drow tongue.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s asking for a password, \" Entreri whispered to Catti-brie. \"I think.\"\\n\\n \"So give it to him.\"\\n\\n Easier said than done, Entreri knew well, for Jarlaxle had never mentioned any password to the inner Baenre structures. Entreri would have to take issue with the mercenary over that small slip, he decided, if he ever got the chance.\\n\\n The monstrous minotaur advanced a threatening step, waving a spiked adamantite rod out in front of it.\\n\\n \"As if minotaurs aren\u0027t formidable enough without giving them drow made weapons, \" Entreri whispered to Catti-brie.\\n\\n Another step put the minotaur barely ten feet from the compan ions.\\n\\n \"Uss tan be~bo1... uss tan belbau ulu. . . dos, \" Entreri stuttered, and he jingled a pouch on his belt. \"Dosst?\"\\n\\n The minotaur stopped its advance and screwed up its bullish features.\\n\\n \"What did you say?\" Catti-brie whispered.\\n\\n \"I have no idea, \" Entreri admitted, though he thought he had mentioned something about a gift.\\n\\n A low snarl emitted from the increasingly impatient minotaur guard\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n \"Dosst?\" Catti-brie asked boldly, holding out her bow in one hand and trying to appear cheerful. She smiled widely and bobbed her head stupidly, as though offering the bow, all the while slipping her other hand inside the folds of her traveling cloak, feeling for an arrow in the quiver at her hip.\\n\\n \"Dosst?\" she asked again, and the minotaur poked itself in the chest with a huge, stubby finger.\\n\\n \"Yeah, yerself!\" Catti-brie growled, and out snapped the arrow, fitted to the string and fired before the stupid minotaur even got its back down. The arrow slammed into the monster\u0027s chest and sent it staggering backward.\\n\\n \"Use yer finger to fill the hole!\" Catti-brie roared, fitting another arrow. \"And how many fingers ye got?\"\\n\\n She glanced quickly to Entreri, who was staring at her dumb foundedly Catti-brie laughed at him and put another arrow into the monster\u0027s chest, driving it back several more steps, where it toppled into the wider room beyond the corridor. When it fell, more than half a dozen other minotaurs were ready to take its place.\\n\\n \"You are crazy!\" Entreri shouted at the woman.\\n\\n Not bothering to answer, Catti-brie slammed an arrow into the closest minotaur\u0027s belly. It doubled over in pain and was plowed under by its charging comrades.\\n\\n Entreri drew out his blades and met the charge, realizing that he had to keep the giants away from Catti-brie so that she might utilize her bow. He met the first minotaur two steps in from the end of the corridor, throwing his sword up to deflect a blow from the crea ture\u0027s spiked rod (and the assassin\u0027s whole side tingled with numb ness from the sheer weight of the blow).\\n\\n Much quicker than the lumbering giant, Entreri countered with three rapid dagger strikes to the monster\u0027s midsection. Down swooped the spiked rod, and, though his sword intercepted the blow, Entreri had to spin a complete circuit to absorb the shock and get out of harm\u0027s way\\n\\n He came around with his sword leading, its green glowing point cutting a neat line under the minotaur\u0027s jaw, slicing through bone and the creature\u0027s cowlike tongue.\\n\\n Blood spewed from the beast\u0027s mouth, but it swung again, for cing Entreri back.\\n\\n A, silver streak stole the sight from both combatants as Catti brie\u0027s arrow flew over the engaged minotaur \u0027s shoulder to drive into the thick skull of the next creature in line.\\n\\n Entreri could only hope that the minotaur was similarly blinded as he made his desperate rush, jabbing viciously with his dagger, cutting his sword in a brutal downward slash. He scored lightning fast hit after hit on the stunned and wounded beast, and his sight returned as the minotaur slumped down in front of him.\\n\\n Entreri didn\u0027t hesitate. He sprang right atop the thing\u0027s back, then leaped farther along to the back of the next dead beast, using its bulk to bring him up even with the next monster in line. His sword beat the minotaur to the attack, scoring a solid hit on the crea ture\u0027s shoulder. Entreri thought this one an easy kill as its weapon arm inevitably slumped useless at its side, but he had never fought the likes of a bull headed minotaur before, and his surprise was complete when the creature snapped a head butt that caught him in the chest.\\n\\n The minotaur jerked to the side and began a charge across the room, still carrying the assassin between its horns.\\n\\n \"Oh, damn, \" Catti-brie muttered as she saw the line between her and the remaining monsters suddenly open. She dropped to one knee and began frantically tearing out her arrows and launching them down the corridor.\\n\\n The blinding barrage dropped one, then two minotaurs, but the third in line grabbed the falling second and hoisted it up as a shield. Catti-brie managed to skip an arrow off that one\u0027s thick head, but it did no real damage and the minotaur rapidly closed.\\n\\n The young woman fired off one more shot, as much to blind the monsters as in any hope of stopping the charge, then she dove to the floor and boldly scrambled ahead, sliding aside the tram pling legs.\\n\\n The minotaur crashed hard into the outer door. Holding its dead comrade in front of it, it could not tell that Catti-brie had slipped away, and it heaved the huge corpse back from the wall and slammed it in again repeatedly\\n\\n Still on the floor, Catti-brie had to pick her way past three sets of treelike legs. All three minotaurs were roaring, offering some cover, for they thought that the one in front was squashing the puny woman.\\n\\n She almost made it.\\n\\n The last minotaur in line felt a brush against its leg and looked down, then bellowed and grabbed its spiked rod in both hands.\\n\\n Catti-brie rolled to her back, her bow coming out in front. Some how she got off a shot, knocking the creature back for just an instant. The woman instinctively threw her feet straight up and over her, launching herself into a backward roll.\\n\\n The blinded minotaur\u0027s rod took a fair sized chunk out of the stone floor an inch below Catti-brie\u0027s angled back.\\n\\n Catti-brie came right to her feet, facing the beast. She whipped her bow across in front of her and spun away, stumbling out of the corridor.\\n\\n The breath was taken from his body with the impact. The mino taur wrapped its good arm about Entreri\u0027s waist, holding him steady, and hopped back, obviously meaning to slam the assassin into the wall once more. Just a few feet away, another minotaur cheered its winning comrade on.\\n\\n Entreri\u0027s dagger arm pumped wildly, futilely trying to penetrate the beast\u0027s thick skull.\\n\\n The assassin felt as though his backbone had shattered when they hit the wall a second time. He forced himself to see through the pain and the fear, forced himself to take a quick survey of his situa tion. A cool head was the fighter\u0027s best advantage, Entreri knew, and his tactics quickly changed. Instead of just smashing the dagger down against solid bone, he placed its tip on the flesh between the creature\u0027s bull horns, then ran it down the side of the minotaur\u0027s face, applying equal pressure to slide it and push it in.\\n\\n They hit the wall again.\\n\\n Entreri held his hand steady, confident that the dagger would do its work. At first, the blade slipped evenly, not able to penetrate, but then it found a fleshy spot and Entreri immediately changed its angle and plunged it home.\\n\\n Into the minotaur\u0027s eye.\\n\\n The assassin felt the hungry dagger grab at the creature\u0027s life force, felt it pulse, sending waves of strength up his arm.\\n\\n The minotaur shuddered for a long while, holding steady against the wall. Its watching comrade continued to cheer, thinking that it was making mush of the human.\\n\\n Then it fell dead, and Entreri, light footed, hit the ground run ning, coming up into the other\u0027s chest before it could react. He launched a one two three combination, sword dagger sword, in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n The surprised minotaur fell back, but Entreri paced it, keeping his dagger firmly embedded, drawing out, feeding on this one\u0027s energy as well. The dying creature tried a lame swing with its club, but Entreri\u0027s sword easily parried.\\n\\n And his dagger feasted.\\n\\n She came into the small room running, spun a half circle as she fell to one knee. There was no need to aim, Catti-brie knew, for the bulk of the pursuing minotaurs fully filled the corridor.\\n\\n The closest one was not at full speed, fortunately, having an arrow driven halfway through its inner thigh. The wounded mino taur was a stubborn one, though, taking brutal hit after hit and still coming on.\\n\\n Behind the beast, the next minotaur screamed frantically for the third, the one pressing a corpse against the wall, to go the other way But minotaurs were never known for intelligence, and the last in line insisted that it had the human pinned and squashed.\\n\\n The last arrow was point blank, its tip, as it left Taulmaril, only half a foot from the charging creature\u0027s nose. It split the nostrils and the skull, nearly halving the stubborn minotaur\u0027s head. The creature was dead instantly, but its momentum carried it on, bowling over Catti-brie.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t badly injured, but there was no way that she could extract her body and bow in time to stop the second charging mino taur, just coming out of the corridor.\\n\\n A sliding figure cut across the monster\u0027s path, slashing and jab bing, and when the blur had passed, the minotaur stood in a crouch and grabbed at its torn knees. It lumbered to the side in pursuit of this newest foe, but Entreri spun up to his feet and easily danced away\\n\\n He ran to the center of the room, behind a black marble pillar, and the minotaur followed, leaning forward. Entreri went around, and the minotaur, thinking quickly (for a minotaur), allowed itself to fall into a staggered run, hooked one arm about the pillar, and used its momentum to whip around.\\n\\n Entreri had thought quicker. As soon as he knew that he was out of the minotaur\u0027s line of sight, he stopped his rush about the pil lar and took a couple of steps back. The spinning minotaur rolled right in between the assassin and the pillar, affording Entreri a dozen clean jabs at its side and back.\\n\\n Artemis Entreri never needed that many\\n\\n The minotaur hoisted its dead companion and jumped back three steps, then roared ahead, slamming the thing against the outer stone door.\\n\\n An enchanted arrow sizzled into its back.\\n\\n \"Huh?\" it asked and tried to turn.\\n\\n A second arrow blew into its side, collapsing a lung.\\n\\n \"Huh?\" it asked breathlessly, stupidly, finally turning enough to see Catti-brie, standing at the end of the corridor, grim faced and with that wicked bow out in front of her.\\n\\n The third arrow blew into the side of the minotaur\u0027s face. The beast took a step forward, but the fourth arrow slammed it in the chest, knocking it back against its dead comrade.\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n It got hit five more times, and didn\u0027t feel any of them, before Entreri could get to Catti-brie and tell her that the fight was over.\\n\\n \"We are fortunate that there were no drow about, \" the assassin explained, looking nervously to the twelve doors and alcoves lining this circular room. He felt for the locket in his pouch, then turned to the floor to ceiling central pillar.\\n\\n Without a word of explanation, the assassin ran to the pillar. Sensitive fingers rubbed against its smooth surface.\\n\\n \"What do ye know?\" Catti-brie asked when Entreri\u0027s hands stopped moving and he turned and smiled her way She asked again and, in response, the assassin pushed on the stone, and a portion of the marble slid away, revealing that this pillar was hollow. Entreri went in, pulling Catti-brie along with him, and the door closed of its own accord behind them.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Catti-brie demanded, thinking that they had just gone into a closet. She looked to the hole in the ceiling to her left, and the one in the floor to her right.\\n\\n Entreri didn\u0027t answer. Following the locket\u0027s pull, he inched over to the hole in the floor, then crouched to one knee and peered down it.\\n\\n Catti-brie slid down beside him, looking to him curiously when she saw no ladder. Then she looked around the unremarkable marble room, searching for some place to set a rope.\\n\\n \"Perhaps there is a foothold, \" Entreri remarked, and he slid over the edge, easing himself down the shaft. His expression became incredulous as he felt the weight lifted from his body, felt himself floating in midair.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Catti-brie asked impatiently, seeing the amazed look.\\n\\n Entreri lifted his hands from the floor, held them wide, and smiled smugly as he gently descended. Catti-brie was into the hole right behind him, floating freely, gently descending through the darkness. Catti-brie noticed Entreri below her, replacing the magical mask of disguise now, and concentrating.\\n\\n \"You are my prisoner, \" the assassin said coldly, and for an instant, Catti-brie did not understand, thought that Entreri had double crossed her. As she came down to the floor beside him, the assassin motioned for Taulmaril, and she recognized his intentions.\\n\\n \"The bow, \" Entreri said impatiently\\n\\n Catti-brie stubbornly shook her head, and the assassin knew her better than to argue the point. He moved to the closest wall and began feeling about, and soon had the door to this level open. Two drow males were waiting for them, hand crossbows up and ready, and Catti-brie wondered if she had been wise in holding fast to her bow.\\n\\n How quickly those crossbows (and two drow jaws) dropped when the guards saw Triel Baenre standing before them!\\n\\n Entreri roughly grabbed Catti-brie and pulled her forward.\\n\\n \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden!\" he cried in Triel\u0027s voice.\\n\\n The guards wanted no argument with the eldest Baenre daugh ter. Their orders said nothing about escorting Triel, or anyone other than Matron Baenre, to the valuable Drizzt, but their orders had mentioned nothing about any human female prisoners. One scram bled ahead, while the other rushed to grab Catti-brie.\\n\\n The young woman slumped, dropping her bow, and forcing one of the dark elves and Entreri to support her, one under each arm. The other drow quickly retrieved Taulmaril, and Catti-brie couldn\u0027t help a slight wince in seeing the magnificent weapon in the hands of an evil creature.\\n\\n They walked along a dark corridor, past several iron bound doors. The drow in front stopped before one of these and took out a tiny rod. He rubbed it down a metal plate beside the door handle, then tapped the plate twice. The door popped open.\\n\\n The leading drow started to turn, smiling as though he was grateful to please Triel. Entreri\u0027s hand slapped across his mouth, jerking his head back and to the side, and the assassin\u0027s dagger hand followed swiftly, the blade plunging through the stunned drow\u0027s throat.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s assault was not as skilled, but even more brutal. She pivoted on one foot, her other leg flying high to slam the drow in the belly as they crashed against the wall. Catti-brie hopped back half a step and snapped her head forward, her forehead splattering the drow\u0027s delicate nose.\\n\\n A flurry of punches followed, another knee to the belly, and Catti-brie wrestled her opponent into the room. She came up behind the drow, lifting him from the floor, with her arms wrapped under the drow\u0027s armpits and her fingers clenched tightly behind his neck.\\n\\n The drow thrashed wildly but could not break the hold. Entreri was in by then, and had dropped the corpse to the side.\\n\\n \"No mercy!\" Catti-brie growled through clenched teeth.\\n\\n Entreri calmly walked over. The drow kicked out, banging his foot off Entreri\u0027s blocking forearm.\\n\\n \"Triel!\" the confused soldier cried.\\n\\n Entreri stepped back, smiled, and took off the mask, and as an expression of horror widened over the helpless drow\u0027s face, Entreri whipped a dagger into his heart.\\n\\n Catti-brie felt the dark elf jerk, then go limp. A sick feeling washed over her, but it did not take hold as she glanced to the side and saw Drizzt, beaten and chained. He hung from the wall, groan ing and trying futilely to curl up into a ball. Catti-brie dropped the dead drow to the floor and ran to her dear friend, immediately noticing the small but obviously wicked dart protruding from his stomach.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to take it!\" she said to Drizzt, hoping that he would agree. He was beyond reason, though; she didn\u0027t think he even real ized that she was in the room.\\n\\n Entreri came up beside her. He gave only a slight glance at the dart, more concerned with the bindings holding Drizzt.\\n\\n With a quick puff of steadying breath, Catti-brie took hold of the nasty dart and tugged it free.\\n\\n Drizzt curled and gave a sharp cry of pain, then fell limp, unconscious.\\n\\n \"There are no locks to pick!\" Entreri snarled, seeing that the shackles were solid rings.\\n\\n \"Move away, \" came Catti-brie\u0027s instructions as she ran out from the wall. When Entreri turned to regard her, he saw the woman lift ing her deadly bow and promptly skittered to the side.\\n\\n Two shots took out the chains, and Drizzt fell, to be caught by Entreri. The wounded ranger somehow managed to open one swollen eye. He could hardly comprehend what was happening, didn\u0027t know if these were friends or foes.\\n\\n \"The flasks, \" he begged.\\n\\n Catti-brie looked about and spotted the rows of bottles resting against the wall. She rushed over, found a full one, and brought it to Drizzt.\\n\\n \"He should not be alive, \" Entreri reasoned when she came up with the foul smelling liquid. \"His scars are too many Something has sustained him.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie looked doubtfully at the flask.\\n\\n The assassin followed her gaze and nodded. \"Do it!\" he com manded, knowing that they would never get Drizzt out of the Baenre compound in this condition.\\n\\n Catti-brie shoved the flask against Drizzt\u0027s lips and forced his head back, compelled him to take a huge swallow. He sputtered and spat, and for a moment, the young woman feared that she had poi soned or drowned her dearest friend.\\n\\n \"How are you here?\" Drizzt asked, both eyes suddenly wide, as the strength began to flow through his body Still, the drow could not support himself and his breath was dangerously shallow.\\n\\n Catti-brie ran over to the wall and came back with several more flasks, sniffing them first to make sure that they smelled the same, then pouring them down Drizzt\u0027s throat. In just a few minutes, the ranger was standing solidly, looking more than a little amazed to see his dearest friend and his worst enemy standing before him side by side.\\n\\n \"Your equipment, \" Entreri remarked, roughly turning Drizzt about to see the pile.\\n\\n Drizzt looked more to Entreri than to the pile, wondering what macabre game the evil assassin was playing. When Entreri noticed the expression, the two enemies locked unblinking stares.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve not the time!\" Catti-brie called harshly\\n\\n \"I thought you dead, \" Drizzt said.\\n\\n \"You thought wrong, \" Entreri answered evenly Never blinking, he stepped past Drizzt and lifted the suit of chain, holding it out for the following drow.\\n\\n \"Watch the corridor, \" Entreri said to Catti-brie. The young woman turned that way just as the iron bound door swung in.\\n\\n Turned that way to look down the length of Vendes Baenre\u0027s wand.\\n\\n Part 5 EYE OF A WARRIOR Courage.\\n\\n In any language, the word has a special ring to it, as much, I suspect, from the reverent way in which it is spoken as from the actual sounds of the letters. Courage. The word evokes images of great deeds and great character: the grim set of the faces of men defending their town\u0027s walls from raiding goblins; the resilience of a mother caring for young children when all the world has seemingly turned hostile. In many of the larger cities of the Realms, young waifs stalk the streets, without parents, without homes. Theirs is a unique courage, a braving of hardships both physical and emotional.\\n\\n I suspect that Artemis Ent reri fought such a battle in the mud filled lanes of Calim port. On one level, he certainly won, certainly overcame any physical obstacles and rose to a rank of incredible power and respect.\\n\\n On another level, Artemis Entreri surely lost. What might he have been, I often wonder, ~f his heart had not been so tainted? But I do not mis take my curiosity for pity. Entreri\u0027s odds were no greater than my own. He could have won out over his struggles, in body and in heart.\\n\\n I thought myself courageous, altruistic, when I left Mithril Hall deter mined to end the threat to my friends. I thought I was offering the supreme sacr~fice for the good of those dear to me.\\n\\n When Catti-brie entered my cell in House Baenre, when, through half closed eyes, I glimpsed her fair and deceivingly delicate features, I learned the truth. I did not understand my own motivations when I walked from Mithril Hall. I was too full of unknown grief to recognize my own resigna tion. I was not courageous when I walked into the Underdark, because, in the deepest corner of my heart, I felt as if I had nothing to lose. I had not allowed myself to grieve for Wulfgar, and that emptiness stole my will and my trust that things could be put aright.\\n\\n Courageous people do not surrender hope.\\n\\n Similarly, Artemis Entreri was not courageous when he came with Catti-brie to rescue me. His actions were wrought of sheer desperation, for if he remained in Menzoberranzan, he was surely doomed. Entreri\u0027s goals, as always, were purely selfish. By his rescue attempt he made a conscious choice that coming after me was his best chance for survival. The rescue was an act of calculation, not of courage.\\n\\n By the time Catti-brie had run out of Mithril Hall in pursuit of her foolish drow friend, she had honestly overcome her grief for Wulfgar. The grieving process had come full circle for Catti-brie, and her actions were motivated only by loyalty. She had everything to lose, yet had gone alone into the savage Underdark for the sake of a friend.\\n\\n I came to understand this when first I looked into her eyes in the dungeons of House Baenre. I came to understand fully the meaning of the word courage.\\n\\n And I came, for the first time since Wulfgar fell, to know inspiration. I had fought as the hunter, savagely, mercilessly, but it wasn\u0027t until I looked again upon my loyal friend that I regained the eyes of the warrior. Gone was my resignation and acceptance of fate; gone was my belief that all would be right ~f House Baenre got its sacrifice, gave my heart to Lloth.\\n\\n In that dungeon, the healing potions returned strength to my battered limbs; the sight of grim, determined Catti-brie returned strength to my heart. I vowed then that I would resist, that I would fight the overwhelm ing events, and would fight to win.\\n\\n When I saw Catti-brie, I remembered all that I had to lose. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-23.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night \\n Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
