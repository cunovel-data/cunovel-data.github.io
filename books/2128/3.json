{"id":94160,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Bleary eyed after yet another long, restless night, Catti-brie pulled on a robe and crossed her small room, hoping to find comfort in the daylight. Her thick auburn hair had been flattened on one side of her head, forcing an angled cowlick on the other side, but she didn\u0027t care. Busy rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she nearly stumbled over the threshold and paused there, struck suddenly by something she did not understand.\\n\\n She ran her fingers over the wood of the door and stood con fused, nearly overwhelmed by the same feeling she had felt the night before, that something was out of place, that something was wrong. She had intended to go straight to breakfast, but felt com pelled to get Drizzt instead.\\n\\n The young woman shuffled swiftly down the corridor to Drizzt\u0027s room and knocked on the door. After a few moments, she called, \"Drizzt?\" When the drow didn\u0027t answer, she gingerly turned the handle and pushed the door open. Catti-brie noticed immedi ately that Drizzt\u0027s scimitars and traveling cloak were gone, but before she could begin to think about that, her eyes focused on the bed. It was made, covers tucked neatly, though that was not unusual for the dark elf.\\n\\n Catti-brie slipped over to the bed and inspected the folds. They were neat, but not tight, and she understood that this bed had been made a long while ago, that this bed had not been slept in the previ ous night.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s all this?\" the young woman asked. She took a quick look around the small room, then made her way back out into the hall. Drizzt had gone out from Mithril Hall without warning before, and often he left at night. He usually journeyed to Silverymoon, the fabulous city a week\u0027s march to the east.\\n\\n Why, this time, did Catti-brie feel that something was amiss? Why did this not so unusual scene strike Catti-brie as very out of place? The young woman tried to shrug it away, to overrule her heartfelt fears. She was just worried, she told herself. She had lost Wulfgar and now felt overprotective of her other friends.\\n\\n Catti-brie walked as she thought it over, and soon paused at another door. She tapped lightly, then, with no response forthcom ing (though she was certain that this one was not yet up and about), she banged harder. A groan came from within the room.\\n\\n Catti-brie pushed the door open and crossed the room, sliding to kneel beside the tiny bed and roughly pulling the bedcovers down from sleeping Regis, tickling his armpits as he began to squirm.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" the plump halfling, recovered from his trials at the hands of the assassin Artemis Entreri, cried out. He came awake immediately and grabbed at the covers desperately.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Drizzt?\" Catti-brie asked, tugging the covers away more forcefully.\\n\\n \"How would I know?\" Regis protested. \"I have not been out of my room yet this morning!\"\\n\\n \"Get up.\" Catti-brie was surprised by the sharpness of her own voice, by the intensity of her command. The uncomfortable feelings tugged at her again, more forcefully. She looked around the room, trying to discern what had triggered her sudden anxiety.\\n\\n She saw the panther figurine.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s unblinking stare locked on the object, Drizzt\u0027s dear est possession. What was it doing in Regis\u0027s room? she wondered. Why had Drizzt left without it? Now the young woman\u0027s logic began to fall into agreement with her emotions. She skipped across the bed, buried Regis in a jumble of covers (which he promptly pulled tight around his shoulders), and retrieved the panther. She then hopped back and tugged again at the stubborn halfling\u0027s blan ket shell.\\n\\n \"No!\" Regis argued, yanking back. He dove facedown to his mattress, pulling the ends of the pillow up around his dimpled face.\\n\\n Catti-brie grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, yanked him from the bed, and dragged him across the room to seat him in one of the two wooden chairs resting at opposite sides of a small table. Pil low still in hand, still tight against his face, Regis plopped his head straight down on the table.\\n\\n Catti-brie took a firm and silent hold on the end of the pillow, quietly stood, then yanked it suddenly, tearing it from the surprised halfling\u0027s grasp so that his head knocked hard against the bare wood.\\n\\n Groaning and grumbling, Regis sat straight in the chair and ran stubby fingers through his fluffy and curly brown locks, their bounce undiminished by a long night\u0027s sleep.\\n\\n \"What?\" he demanded.\\n\\n Catti-brie slammed the panther figurine atop the table, leaving it before the seated halfling. \"Where is Drizzt?\" she asked again, evenly.\\n\\n \"Probably in the Undercity, \" Regis grumbled, running his tongue all about his cottony feeling teeth. \"Why don\u0027t you go ask Bruenor?\"\\n\\n The mention of the dwarvish king set Catti-brie back on her heels. Go ask Bruenor? she silently scoffed. Bruenor would hardly speak to anyone, and was so immersed in despair that he probably wouldn\u0027t know it if his entire clan up and left in the middle of the night!\\n\\n \"So Drizzt left Guenhwyvar, \" Regis remarked, thinking to downplay the whole thing. His words fell awkwardly on the per ceptive woman\u0027s ears, though, and Catti-brie\u0027s deep blue eyes nar rowed as she studied the halfling more closely.\\n\\n \"What?\" Regis asked innocently again, feeling the heat of that unrelenting scrutiny.\\n\\n \"Where is Drizzt?\" Catti-brie asked, her tone dangerously calm. \"And why do ye have the cat?\"\\n\\n Regis shook his head and wailed helplessly, dramatically drop ping his forehead again against the table.\\n\\n Catti-brie saw the act for what it was. She knew Regis too well to be taken in by his wily charms. She grabbed a handful of curly brown hair and tugged his head upright, then grabbed the front of his nightshirt with her other hand. Her roughness startled the half ling; she could see that clearly by his expression, but she did not relent. Regis flew from his seat. Catti-brie carried him three quick steps, then slammed his back against the wall.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s scowling visage softened for just a moment, and her free hand fumbled with the halfling\u0027s nightshirt long enough that she could determine that Regis was not wearing his magical ruby pendant, an item she knew he never removed. Another curious, and certainly out of place, fact that assailed her sensibilities, fed her growing belief that something indeed was terribly wrong.\\n\\n \"Suren there\u0027s something going on here that\u0027s not what it\u0027s sup posed to be, \" Catti-brie said, her scowl returning tenfold.\\n\\n \"Catti-brie!\" Regis replied, looking down to his furry topped feet, dangling twenty inches from the floor.\\n\\n \"And ye know something about it, \" Catti-brie went on.\\n\\n \"Catti-brie!\" Regis wailed again, trying to bring the fiery young woman to her senses.\\n\\n Catti-brie took up the halfling\u0027s nightshirt in both her hands, pulled him away from the wall, and slammed him back again, hard. \"I\u0027ve lost Wulfgar, \" she said grimly, pointedly reminding Regis that he might not be dealing with someone rational.\\n\\n Regis didn\u0027t know what to think. Bruenor Battlehammer\u0027s daughter had always been the levelheaded one of the troupe, the calm influence that kept the others in line. Even cool Drizzt had often used Catti-brie as a guidepost to his conscience. But now...\\n\\n Regis saw the promise of pain set within the depths of Catti brie\u0027s deep blue, angry eyes.\\n\\n She pulled him from the wall once more and slammed him back. \"Ye\u0027re going to tell me what ye know, \" she said evenly.\\n\\n The back of Regis\u0027s head throbbed from the banging. He was scared, very scared, as much for Catti-brie as for himself. Had her grief brought her to this point of desperation? And why was he sud denly caught in the middle of all this? All that Regis wanfed out of life was a warm bed and a warmer meal.\\n\\n \"We should go and sit down with Brue, \" he began, but he was summarily interrupted as Catti-brie slapped him across the face.\\n\\n He brought his hand up to the stinging cheek, felt the angry welt rising there. He never blinked, eyeing the young woman with disbelief.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s violent reaction had apparently surprised her as much as Regis. The halfling saw tears welling in her gentle eyes. She trembled, and Regis honestly didn\u0027t know what she might do.\\n\\n The halfling considered his situation for a long moment, coming to wonder what difference a few days or weeks could make. \"Drizzt went home, \" the halfling said softly, always willing to do as the situ ation demanded. Worrying about consequences could come later.\\n\\n Catti-brie relaxed somewhat. \"This is his home, \" she reasoned. \"Suren ye don\u0027t mean Icewind Dale.\"\\n\\n \"Menzoberranzan, \" Regis corrected.\\n\\n If Catti-brie had taken a crossbow quarrel in her back, it would not have hit her harder than that single word. She let Regis down to the floor and tumbled backward, falling into a sitting position on the edge of the halfling\u0027s bed.\\n\\n \"He really left Guenhwyvar for you, \" Regis explained. \"He cares for both you and the cat so very much.\"\\n\\n His soothing words did not shake the horrified expression from Catti-brie\u0027s face. Regis wished he had his ruby pendant, so that he might use its undeniable charms to calm the young woman.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t tell Bruenor, \" Regis added. \"Besides, Drizzt might not even go that far.\" The halfling thought an embellishment of the truth might go a long way. \"He said he was off to see Alustriel, to try to decide where his course should lead.\" It wasn\u0027t exactly true, Drizzt had only mentioned that he might stop by Silverymoon to see if he might confirm his fears, but Regis decided that Catti-brie needed to be given some hope.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t tell Bruenor, \" the halfling said again, more forcefully. Catti-brie looked up at him; her expression was truly one of the most pitiful sights Regis had ever seen.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be back, \" Regis said to her, rushing over to sit beside her. \"You know Drizzt. He\u0027ll be back.\"\\n\\n It was too much for Catti-brie to digest. She gently pulled Regis\u0027s hand off her arm and rose. She looked to the panther fig urine once more, sitting upon the small table, but she had not the strength to retrieve it.\\n\\n Catti-brie padded silently out of the room, back to her own chambers, where she fell listlessly upon her bed.\\n\\n Drizzt spent midday sleeping in the cool shadows of a cave, many miles from Mithril Hall\u0027s eastern door. The early summer air was warm, the breeze off the cold glaciers of the mountains carrying little weight against the powerful rays of the sun in a cloudless sum mer sky.\\n\\n The drow did not sleep long or well. His rest was filled with thoughts of Wulfgar, of all his friends, and of distant images, memo ries of that awful place, Menzoberranzan.\\n\\n Awful and beautiful, like the dark elves who had sculpted it.\\n\\n Drizzt moved to his shallow cave\u0027s entrance to take his meal. He basked in the warmth of the bright afternoon, in the sounds of the many animals. How different was this from his Underdark home! How wonderful!\\n\\n Drizzt threw his dried biscuit into the dirt and punched the floor beside him.\\n\\n How wonderful indeed was this false hope that had been dan gled before his desperate eyes. All that he had wanted in life was to escape the ways of his kin, to live in peace. Then he had come to the surface, and soon after, had decided that this place, this place of buzzing bees and chirping birds, of warm sunlight and alluring moonlight, should be his home, not the eternal darkness of those tunnels far below.\\n\\n Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had chosen the surface, but what did that choice mean? It meant that he would come to know new, dear friends, and by his mere presence, trap them into his dark legacy. It meant that Wulfgar would die by the summons of Drizzt\u0027s own sis ter, and that all of Mithril Hall might soon be in peril.\\n\\n It meant that his choice was a false one, that he could not stay.\\n\\n The disciplined drow calmed quickly and took out some more food, forcing it past the angry lump in his throat. He considered his course as he ate. The road before him would lead out of the moun tains and past a village called Pengallen. Drizzt had been there recently, and he did not wish to return.\\n\\n He would not follow the road at all, he decided at length. What purpose would going to Silverymoon serve? Drizzt doubted that Lady Alustriel would be there, with the trading season open in full. Even if she was, what could she tell him that he did not already know?\\n\\n No, Drizzt had already determined his ultimate course and he did not need Alustriel to confirm it. He gathered his belongings and sighed as he considered again how empty the road seemed without his dear panther companion. He walked out into the bright day, straight toward the east, off the southeastern road.\\n\\n Her stomach did not complain that breakfast, and lunch, had passed and still she lay motionless on her bed, caught in a web of despair. She had lost Wulfgar, barely days before their planned wed ding, and now Drizzt, whom she loved as much as she had the bar barian, was gone as well. It seemed as though her entire world had crumbled around her. A foundation that had been built of stone shifted like sand on the blowing wind.\\n\\n Catti-brie had been a fighter all of her young life. She didn\u0027t remember her mother, and barely recalled her father, who had been killed in a goblin raid in Ten Towns when she was very young. Bruenor Battlehammer had taken her in and raised her as his own daughter, and Catti-brie had found a fine life among the dwarves of Bruenor\u0027s clan. Except for Bruenor, though, the dwarves had been friends, not family. Catti-brie had forged a new family one at a time, first Bruenor, then Drizzt, then Regis, and, finally, Wulfgar.\\n\\n Now Wulfgar was dead and Drizzt gone, back to his wicked homeland with, by Catti-brie\u0027s estimation, little chance of returning.\\n\\n Catti-brie felt so very helpless about it all! She had watched Wulfgar die, watched him chop a ceiling down onto his own head so that she might escape the clutches of the monstrous yochlol. She had tried to help, but had failed and, in the end, all that remained was a pile of rubble and Aegis fang.\\n\\n In the weeks since, Catti-brie had teetered on the edge of con trol, trying futilely to deny the paralyzing grief. She had cried often, but always had managed to check it after the first few sobs with a deep breath and sheer willpower. The only one she could talk to had been Drizzt.\\n\\n Now Drizzt was gone, and now, too, Catti-brie did cry, a flood of tears, sobs wracking her deceptively delicate frame. She wanted Wulfgar back! She protested to whatever gods might be listening that he was too young to be taken from her, with too many great deeds ahead of him.\\n\\n Her sobs became intense growls, fierce denial. Pillows flew across the room, and Catti-brie grabbed the blankets into a pile and heaved them as well. Then she overturned her bed just for the plea sure of hearing its wooden frame crack against the hard floor.\\n\\n \"No!\" The word came from deep inside, from the young fighter\u0027s belly. The loss of Wulfgar wasn\u0027t fair, but there was nothing Catti-brie could do about that.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s leaving wasn\u0027t fair, not in Catti-brie\u0027s wounded mind, but there was nothing...\\n\\n The thought hung in Catti-brie\u0027s mind. Still trembling, but now under control, she stood beside the overturned bed. She understood why the drow had left secretly, why Drizzt had, as was typical, taken the whole burden on himself.\\n\\n \"No, \" the young woman said again. She stripped off her night clothes, grabbed a blanket to towel the sweat from her, then donned breeches and chemise. Catti-brie did not hesitate to consider her actions, fearful that if she thought about things rationally, she might change her mind. She quickly slipped on a chain link coat of supple and thin mithril armor, so finely crafted by the dwarves that it was barely detectable after she had donned her sleeveless tunic.\\n\\n Still moving frantically, Catti-brie pulled on her boots, grabbed her cloak and leather gloves, and rushed across the room to her closet. There she found her sword belt, quiver, and Taulmaril the Heartseeker, her enchanted bow. She ran, didn\u0027t walk, from her room to the halfling\u0027s and banged on the door only once before bursting in.\\n\\n Regis was in bed again, big surprise, his belly full from a breakfast that had continued uninterrupted right into lunch. He was awake, though, and none too happy to see Catti-brie charging at him once more.\\n\\n She pulled him up to a sitting position, and he regarded her curiously. Lines from tears streaked her cheeks, and her splendid blue eyes were edged by angry red veins. Regis had lived most of his life as a thief, had survived by understanding people, and it wasn\u0027t hard for him to figure out the reasons behind the young woman\u0027s sudden fire.\\n\\n \"Where did ye put the panther?\" Catti-brie demanded.\\n\\n Regis stared at her for a long moment. Catti-brie gave him a rough shake.\\n\\n \"Tell me quick, \" she demanded. \"I\u0027ve lost too much time already.\" \\n\\n \"For what?\" Regis asked, though he knew the answer.\\n\\n \"Just give me the cat, \" Catti-brie said. Regis unconsciously glanced toward his bureau, and Catti-brie rushed to it, then tore it open and laid waste to the drawers, one by one.\\n\\n \"Drizzt won\u0027t like this, \" Regis said calmly.\\n\\n \"To the Nine Hells with him, then!\" Catti-brie shot back. She found the figurine and held it before her eyes, marveling at its beau tiful form.\\n\\n \"You think Guenhwyvar will lead you to him, \" Regis stated more than asked.\\n\\n Catti-brie dropped the figurine into a belt pouch and did not bother to reply.\\n\\n \"Suppose you do catch up with him, \" Regis went on as the young woman headed for the door. \"How much will you aid Drizzt in a city of drow? A human woman might stand out a bit down there, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n The halfling\u0027s sarcasm stopped Catti-brie, made her consider for the first time what she meant to do. How true was Regis\u0027s reason ing! How could she get into Menzoberranzan? And even if she did, how could she even see the floor ahead of her?\\n\\n \"No!\" Catti-brie shouted at length, her logic blown away by that welling, helpless feeling. \"I\u0027m going to him anyway. I\u0027ll not stand by and wait to learn that another of me friends has been killed!\"\\n\\n \"Trust him, \" Regis pleaded, and, for the first time, the halfling began to think that maybe he would not be able to stop the impetu ous Catti-brie.\\n\\n Catti-brie shook her head and started for the door again.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" Regis called, begged, and the young woman pivoted about to regard him. Regis hung in a precarious position. It seemed to him that he should run out shouting for Bruenor, or for General Dagna, or for any of the dwarves, enlisting allies to hold back Catti brie, physically if need be. She was crazy; her decision to run off after Drizzt made no sense at all.\\n\\n But Regis understood her desire, and he sympathized with her with all his heart.\\n\\n \"If it was meself who left, \" Catti-brie began, \"and Drizzt who wanted to follow...\\n\\n Regis nodded in agreement. If Catti-brie, or any of them, had gone into apparent peril, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden would have taken up the chase, and taken up the fight, no matter the odds. Drizzt, Wulfgar, Catti-brie, and Bruenor had gone more than halfway across the con tinent in search of Regis when Entreri had abducted him. Regis had known Catti-brie since she was just a child, and had always held her in the highest regard, but never had he been more proud of her than at this very moment.\\n\\n \"A human will be a detriment to Drizzt in Menzoberranzan, \" he said again.\\n\\n \"I care not, \" Catti-brie said under her breath. She did not under stand where Regis\u0027s words were leading.\\n\\n Regis hopped off his bed and rushed across the room. Catti-brie braced, thinking he meant to tackle her, but he ran past, to his desk, and pulled open one of its lower drawers. \"So don\u0027t be a human, \" the halfling proclaimed, and he tossed the magical mask to Catti brie.\\n\\n Catti-brie caught it and stood staring at it in surprise as Regis ran back past her, to his bed.\\n\\n Entreri had used the mask to get into Mithril Hall, had, through its magic, so perfectly disguised himself as Regis that the halfling\u0027s friends, even Drizzt, had been taken in.\\n\\n \"Drizzt really is making for Silverymoon, \" Regis told her.\\n\\n Catti-brie was surprised, thinking that the drow would have simply gone into the Underdark through the lower chambers of Mithril Hall. When she thought about it, though, she realized that Bruenor had placed many guards at those chambers, with orders to keep the doors closed and locked.\\n\\n \"One more thing, \" Regis said. Catti-brie looped the mask on her belt and turned to the bed, to see Regis standing on the shifted mat tress, holding a brilliantly jeweled dagger in his hands.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t need this, \" Regis explained, \"not here, with Bruenor and his thousands beside me.\" He held the weapon out, but Catti brie did not immediately take it.\\n\\n She had seen that dagger, Artemis Entreri\u0027s dagger, before. The assassin had once pressed it against her neck, stealing her courage, making her feel more helpless, more a little girl, than at any other time in her life. Catti-brie wasn\u0027t sure that she could take it from Regis, wasn\u0027t sure that she could bear to carry the thing with her.\\n\\n \"Entreri is dead, \" Regis assured her, not quite understanding her hesitation.\\n\\n Catti-brie nodded absently, though her thoughts remained filled with memories of being Entreri\u0027s captive. She remembered the man\u0027s earthy smell and equated that smell now with the aroma of pure evil. She had been so powerless.. . like the moment when the ceiling fell in on Wulfgar. Powerless now, she wondered, when Drizzt might need her?\\n\\n Catti-brie firmed her jaw and took the dagger. She clutched it tightly, then slid it into her belt.\\n\\n \"Ye mustn\u0027t tell Bruenor, \" she said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll know, \" Regis argued. \"I might have been able to turn aside his curiosity about Drizzt\u0027s departure, Drizzt is always leav ing, but Bruenor will soon realize that you are gone.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie had no argument for that, but, again, she didn\u0027t care. She had to get to Drizzt. This was her quest, her way of taking back control of a life that had quickly been turned upside down.\\n\\n She rushed to the bed, wrapped Regis in a big hug, and kissed him hard on the cheek. \"Farewell, me friend!\" she cried, dropping him to the mattress. \"Farewell!\"\\n\\n Then she was gone, and Regis sat there, his chin in his plump hands. So many things had changed in the last day. First Drizzt, and now Catti-brie. With Wulfgar gone, that left only Regis and Bruenor of the five friends remaining in Mithril Hall.\\n\\n Bruenor! Regis rolled to his side and groaned. He buried his face in his hands at the thought of the mighty dwarf. If Bruenor ever learned that Regis had aided Catti-brie on her dangerous way, he would rip the halfling apart.\\n\\n Regis couldn\u0027t begin to think of how he might tell the dwarven king. Suddenly he regretted his decision, felt stupid for letting his emotions, his sympathies, get in the way of good judgment. He understood Catti-brie\u0027s need and felt that it was right for her to go after Drizzt, if that was what she truly desired to do, she was a grown woman, after all, and a fine warrior, but Bruenor wouldn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n Neither would Drizzt, the halfling realized, and he groaned again. He had broken his word to the drow, had told the secret on the very first day! And his mistake had sent Catti-brie running into danger.\\n\\n \"Drizzt will kill me!\" he wailed.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s head came back around the doorjamb, her smile wider, more full of life, than Regis had seen it in a long, long time. Suddenly she seemed the spirited lass that he and the others had come to love, the spirited young woman who had been lost to the world when the ceiling had fallen on Wulfgar. Even the redness had flown from her eyes, replaced by a joyful inner sparkle. \"Just ye hope that Drizzt comes back to kill ye!\" Catti-brie chirped, and she blew the halfling a kiss and rushed away.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" Regis called halfheartedly. Regis was just as glad that Catti-brie didn\u0027t stop. He still thought himself irrational, even stu pid, and still knew that he would have to answer to both Bruenor and Drizzt for his actions, but that last smile of Catti-brie\u0027s, her spark of life so obviously returned, had settled the argument.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-3.html","bookId":2128,"book":{"id":2128,"title":"Starless Night (Legacy of the Drow #2)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #2: Starless Night \\n Still reeling from the death of Wulfgar, Drizzt is allowed little time to grieve, for dark elves are massing in the caverns deep under Mithral Hall.
