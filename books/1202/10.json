MIDDLEMORE SOME SENSIBLE ADVICE. \n \n \"Rejoining Mrs. Middlemore, our reporter informed her that he was satisfied that Sophy had heard nothing in the night. \n \n \"\u0027Of course she didn\u0027t,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore. \u0027Once she\u0027s in bed she lays like a log.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027She\u0027s a sharp little thing,\u0027 observed our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027Sharp ain\u0027t the word, sir. What\u0027s going to be the end of her is more than I can fathom.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Has she a mother?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Father?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If he can be called one. Drunk half his time, in trouble the other half.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027So that poor Sophy has to look after herself?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Pretty well. She does odd jobs, and picks up a bit \u0027ere and a bit there. When M. Felix first come to live \u0027ere I\u0027d made up my mind to \u0027ave \u0027er altogether with me, though she\u0027d \u0027ave worrited the life out of me, I know she would; but he wouldn\u0027t let me \u0027ave nobody in the house but \u0027im, and wouldn\u0027t let nobody sleep in it a single night, so I \u0027ad to disappoint the child. I did take \u0027er in once or twice when she came round to me almost black and bloo with the way \u0027er brute of a father had served \u0027er, but I \u0027ad to be careful that M. Felix shouldn\u0027t see \u0027er--smuggling \u0027er into the kitchen when he was away, and letting \u0027er out very early in the morning--or I should never \u0027ave \u0027eard the last of it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You are the only friend the girl has, it seems?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027She ain\u0027t got many more.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Mind what I tell you, Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 said our reporter, with the kindest intentions, \u0027there\u0027s capital stuff in Sophy. Now that M. Felix is gone it would be a charity to adopt her, if you haven\u0027t any of your own.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I ain\u0027t got none of my own,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, shaking her head dubiously, \u0027but since I arksed \u0027er whether she\u0027d like to live with me, and she said she would, she\u0027s got into ways that I don\u0027t think I could abide. You see, sir, she wasn\u0027t so old then, and I might \u0027ave moulded her. I don\u0027t know as I could do it now.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What ways do you refer to?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well, sir, I\u0027ve seen her selling papers in the streets----\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That\u0027s not a crime,\u0027 interposed our reporter; \u0027especially if she does it for food.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If you won\u0027t mind my saying so,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, with considerable dignity, \u0027I consider it low; but that\u0027s not so bad as selling matches, which is next door to begging.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But she doesn\u0027t beg?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, I don\u0027t think she goes as low as that.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nor steal?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No,\u0027 replied Mrs. Middlemore, with spirit, \u0027she\u0027ll take anything that\u0027s give to her, but\u0027s as honest as the sun, I\u0027ll say that of her.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027All that you\u0027ve told me of Sophy, Mrs. Middlemore, is in her favor, and I have already a sneaking regard for her.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Lord, sir!\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore, misconstruing the sentiment, \u0027and you the gentleman that you are!\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 repeated our reporter, complacently, \u0027a sneaking regard for her. Hawking papers and matches is not the loftiest occupation, but it is a form of commerce; and commerce, my dear madam, has made England what it is.\u0027 \n \n \"It was not entirely without a selfish motive, although he was favorably disposed toward the poor waif, that our reporter wandered for a few moments from the engrossing subject of M. Felix\u0027s disappearance to the less eventful consideration of Sophy\u0027s welfare. By one of those processes of intuition which come to observant men by inspiration, as it were, he was impressed with the idea that Sophy might be useful to him and to us in the elucidation of the mystery concerning M. Felix. We will not weaken the interest of what is to follow by divulging whether this idea was or was not justified by results; our readers will be able to judge for themselves later on. His views regarding Sophy had their weight with Mrs. Middlemore. \n \n \"\u0027I mean to keep Sophy with me,\u0027 said that lady, \u0027for a little while at all events, and if she\u0027ll only keep away from the theaytres I\u0027ll do what I can for \u0027er.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Does she frequent theatres?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Does she?\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore, and immediately answered herself after a favorite fashion with certain of her class. \u0027Doesn\u0027t she? Why she saves every copper she can get to go to the galleries, and when she ain\u0027t got no money she hangs round the stage doors to see the actors and actresses go in and out. I don\u0027t believe she could stay away if it was to save her life.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Persons in a much higher social position than ourselves,\u0027 said our reporter, turning every point to Sophy\u0027s advantage, \u0027are in the habit of hanging round stage doors. The stage is a great institution, Mrs. Middlemore, greater than ever it was before, and is courted--yes, my dear madam, courted--by the highest as well as the lowest in the land, from the Prince of Wales at the top to poor little Sophy at the bottom. Every fresh thing you tell me of Sophy makes me think better of her. But let us return to M. Felix. He would not allow you to have any person in the house, you say. What was his motive?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I can\u0027t say, sir, except that he wanted to keep \u0027isself to \u0027isself.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you expostulate with him?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did I what, sir?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you tell him you would feel lonely without a companion occasionally?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not me, sir. M. Felix wasn\u0027t the kind of gentleman you could cross. He \u0027ad a way of speaking, when he was giving orders you couldn\u0027t mistake. His word was lore, and he meant it to be. You ain\u0027t forgetting, sir, that he was master \u0027ere?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, I\u0027m not forgetting that. His orders, then, were to be obeyed without question?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They was, sir. He said to me, \"When people don\u0027t do as I tell \u0027em, Mrs. Middlemore, I get rid of \u0027em.\"\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027A very dictatorial gentleman.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Only when he was saying, \"This is to be,\" or, \"That is to be.\" At other times he was as smooth as marble, and always passed a pleasant word.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027He had visitors occasionally, I suppose?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Oh, yes, sir, but I scarcely ever sor them. Nearly always he let \u0027em in and out \u0027isself.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027In a manner of speaking, then, he led a secret life?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Some might call it so. Gentlemen living in chambers do all sorts of things.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027So I believe,\u0027 said our reporter, dryly. \n \n \"\u0027And it ain\u0027t for the likes of us to question \u0027em. We\u0027ve got our living to make, and if it pays us to be mum, mum we must be.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I understand that. From what I can gather, Mrs. Middlemore, M. Felix had no family?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not that I know of, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027As to his visitors, now, were they mostly ladies or gentlemen?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Mostly ladies, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Have any of them been here to see his body?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not one, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That is strange. He might almost as well have died on a desert island.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir. That\u0027s the reason why we\u0027ve been all at sea what to do. There was nobody to give directions.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027It is certainly a perplexing situation, unprecedented in my experience. Should you happen to meet any of the persons who were in the habit of visiting him, would you be able to identify them?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I don\u0027t think I should, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Supposing that he came by his death in a violent way--I don\u0027t say it is so, because the medical evidence does not favor that conclusion--but supposing that this evidence was misleading, and was proved to be so, there is nobody to take up the matter authoritatively, to take measures, I mean, to bring the guilty party to justice?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nobody, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Only the police?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir, only the police?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027And all they have succeeded in doing is to make things uncomfortable for you?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 sighed Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027that\u0027s all they\u0027ve done. I said to Mr. Nightingale, \"A nice friend you\u0027ve been,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t \u0027elp saying it after all I\u0027ve gone through.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Is it Constable Nightingale you are speaking of?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, it is.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Is he an old friend of yours?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027He was on the beat \u0027ere before Mr. Wigg.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Ah; and that is how you got to know him?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027He knew M. Felix, probably?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Mr. Felix made a point of being always friendly with the policemen on the beat.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Sensible man. Tipped them, I daresay?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They\u0027d best answer that theirselves. He never give me nothing to give \u0027em.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What did Constable Nightingale say when you made that remark to him?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nothing,\u0027 replied Mrs. Middlemore, with sudden reserve. \n \n \"\u0027Surely he must have made some remark, to the effect that he was your friend, or words bearing the same meaning?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027He didn\u0027t say nothing.\u0027 \n \n \"Our reporter gave up the point; it was his cue to keep Mrs. Middlemore in a good humor. \n \n \"\u0027I\u0027ll have one more look in the bedroom,\u0027 he said. \n \n \"At first his scrutiny was not rewarded by any discovery, but, passing his hand over the pillows on the bed, he felt something hard beneath them, and upon lifting them up he saw a six-chambered revolver, loaded in every barrel. \n \n \"\u0027Lord save us!\u0027 cried Mrs. Middlemore, starting back. \n \n \"\u0027Did you not know it was here?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, sir, this is the first time I ever saw it. I never knew he kep\u0027 one.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Do the police know?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They didn\u0027t mention it, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well, we will leave it where it is. Don\u0027t touch it, Mrs. Middlemore; it\u0027s loaded.\u0027 \n \n \"Before he replaced it, however, he made the following note in his pocket-book: \u0027A Colt\u0027s double-action revolver, nickel plated, six shots, No. 819.\u0027 And, unseen by Mrs. Middlemore, he scratched on the metal with his penknife the initial F. Then he looked at his watch, and said-- \n \n \"\u0027It is nearly ten o\u0027clock. My advice now is that you go and give the alarm to the police that the body of M. Felix has vanished.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You\u0027ll go along with me, sir?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, for your sake I had better not be seen. Give me two minutes to get away, and then go for the police at once. I will come and see you again, and help you in every way I can.\u0027 \n \n \"Shaking her hand, and leaving half a sovereign in it, our reporter, accompanied by Mrs. Middlemore, went to the street door, and left her standing there.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48885.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
