Arrived once more in that comfortable apartment, they shook off the snow dust which had blown in upon them from the street. Then Constable Nightingale assumed a judicial attitude. \"In case of anything being wrong,\" he said, \"we must all be agreed upon what has took place before it\u0027s discovered.\" \"Before what\u0027s discovered?\" cried Mrs. Middlemore. \"That we\u0027ve got to find out.\" \"It\u0027s ten to one there\u0027s nothing to find out,\" said Constable Wigg. \"It\u0027s ten to one there is,\" retorted Constable Nightingale. \"I go a bit deeper than you, Wigg; but whether there is or there ain\u0027t, it\u0027s always well to be prepared with a story. I\u0027ve got something in my mind that you don\u0027t seem to have in yours; what it is you shall hear presently. Mrs. Middlemore, going out for her supper-beer at her usual hour, about half-past eleven shuts the street-door behind her, and does not return till past twelve. Is that correct, ma\u0027am?\" \"Quite correct, Mr. Nightingale; but what are you driving at?\" \"All in good time, my dear. You leave the house safe, and you are sure you shut the street-door tight?\" \"I\u0027ll take my oath of it.\" \"It may come to that; I don\u0027t want to scare you, but it may come to that. When you come back with the supper-beer you find the street-door open?\" \"But I don\u0027t.\" \"Excuse me, you do; it\u0027s necessary.\" \"Oh!\" \"And I\u0027ll tell you why. When you come home you find Wigg and me here, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"You\u0027ve heard how we got in, but it\u0027s a fact that we had no business here unless we was called in. We must have been called in by somebody, and whoever it was must have had a reason for inviting us. Is that sound, Wigg?\" \"As sound as a rock, Nightingale.\" \"Mr. Felix didn\u0027t call us in, and there\u0027s no one else in the house while you\u0027ve gone for your supper-beer?\" Mrs. Middlemore coughed, which caused Constable Nightingale to ask, \"What\u0027s that for?\" \"It ain\u0027t for me to say,\" replied Mrs. Middlemore. \"What you want to git at is that there\u0027s only two people living regularly in the \u0027ouse, Mr. Felix and me. If Mr. Felix makes it worth my while to keep my own counsel, I\u0027m going to keep it, and I don\u0027t care what happens.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t persuade you otherwise. Gentlemen that\u0027s so liberal with their money as him ain\u0027t to be met with every day. Very well, then. There\u0027s only you and Mr. Felix living in the house, and he don\u0027t call us in. It\u0027s you that does that. Why? You shut the street-door tight when you went out; you find it open when you come back, and at the same time you see a man with a red handkercher round his neck run out of the house. Of course you\u0027re alarmed; Wigg happens to be near, and you call him; he, thinking he may want assistance, calls me; and that\u0027s how it is we\u0027re both here at the present moment. That\u0027s pretty straight, isn\u0027t it?\" Both his hearers agreed that it was, and he proceeded: \"But we mustn\u0027t forget that we\u0027ve been here some time already. I make it, by my silver watch that I won in a raffle, twenty minutes to two. Your kitchen clock, Mrs. Middlemore, is a little slow.\" \"Do what I will,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"I can\u0027t make it go right.\" \"Some clocks,\" observed Constable Nightingale, with a touch of humor--he was on the best of terms with himself, having, in a certain sense, snuffed out Constable Wigg--\"are like some men and women; they\u0027re either too slow or too fast, and try your hardest you can\u0027t alter \u0027em. We must be able to account for a little time between past twelve o\u0027clock and now; there\u0027s no need to be too particular; such a night as this is \u0027ll excuse a lot. I\u0027ll take the liberty of stopping your clock and putting the hands back to twelve, so that you won\u0027t be fixed to a half-hour or so. The clock stopped while you was getting your supper-beer, of course. Likewise I stop my watch, and put the hands back to about the same time. Now, what do I do when Wigg calls me here? I hear what you, ma\u0027am, have to say about the street-door being open and a man running out and almost upsetting you, and I make tracks after him. I don\u0027t catch him, and then I come back here, and that brings us up to this very minute. Plain sailing, so far. You\u0027ll bear it in mind, you and Wigg, won\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027ve got it,\" said Wigg, \"at my fingers\u0027 ends.\" \"So \u0027ave I,\" said Mrs. Middlemore. \"But what are you going to do now?\" asked Constable Wigg. \"To find the cat,\" replied Constable Nightingale. \"Going to take it up?\" This, with a fine touch of sarcasm. \"No, Wigg,\" said Constable Nightingale, speaking very seriously. \"I want to make sure where it got that red color from, because, not to put too fine a point on it, it\u0027s blood.\" Mrs. Middlemore uttered a stifled scream, and clapped her hands on her hips. \"That,\" continued Constable Nightingale, in a tone of severity to his brother constable, \"is what I had in my mind and you didn\u0027t have in yours. Why, if you look with only half an eye at them stains on the floor, you can\u0027t mistake \u0027em.\" \"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" moaned Mrs. Middlemore, \"we shall all be murdered in our beds?\" \"Nothing of the sort, my dear,\" said Constable Nightingale; \"we\u0027ll look after you. Pull yourself together, there\u0027s a good soul, and answer me one or two questions. I know that Mr. Felix comes home late sometimes.\" \"Very often, very often.\" \"And that, as well as being generous with his money, he likes his pleasures. Now, are you sure he was at home when you went out for your beer?\" \"I\u0027m certain of it.\" \"And that he did not go out before you come back?\" \"How can I tell you that?\" \"Of course. A stupid question. But, at all events, he ain\u0027t the sort of man to go out in such a storm as this?\" \"Not \u0027im. He\u0027s too fond of his comforts.\" \"Does he ever ring for you in the middle of the night--at such a time as this, for instance?\" \"Never.\" \"Has he ever been took ill in the night, and rung you up?\" \"Never.\" \"Do you ever go up to his room without being summoned?\" \"It\u0027s more than I dare. I should lose the best customer I ever had in my life. He made things as clear as can be when he first come into the \u0027ouse. \u0027Never,\u0027 he ses to me, \u0027under any circumstances whatever, let me see you going upstairs to my rooms unless I call you. Never let me ketch you prying about. If I do, you shall \u0027ear of it in a way you won\u0027t like.\u0027\" Constable Nightingale was silent a few moments, and then he said, briskly, \"Let\u0027s us go and hunt up that cat.\" But although they searched the basement through they could not find it. \"Perhaps,\" suggested Constable Wigg, \"it got out of the house when we opened the street-door just now.\" \"Perhaps,\" assented Constable Nightingale, laconically. Then they ascended the stairs to the ground floor, Constable Nightingale examining very carefully the marks of the cat\u0027s paws on the oilcloth. \"Do you see, Mrs. Middlemore? Blood. There\u0027s no mistaking it. And I\u0027m hanged if it doesn\u0027t go upstairs to the first floor.\" \"You\u0027re not going up, Mr. Nightingale?\" asked Mrs. Middlemore, under her breath, laying her hand on his arm. \"If I know myself,\" said Constable Nightingale, patting her hand, \"I am. Whatever happens, it\u0027s my duty and Wigg\u0027s to get at the bottom of this. What else did you call us in for?\" \"To be sure,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, helplessly, \"but if you have any feeling for me, speak low.\" \"I will, my dear. My feelings for you well you must know, but this is not the time. Look here at this stain, and this, and this. The spectre cat has been up these stairs. Puss, puss, puss, puss! Not likely that it\u0027ll answer; it\u0027s got the cunning of a fox. That\u0027s Mr. Felix\u0027s room, if my eyes don\u0027t deceive me.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"But it don\u0027t look the same door as the one I have been through; it ain\u0027t the first time I\u0027ve been here, you know. Where\u0027s the keyhole? I\u0027ll take my oath there was a keyhole when I last saw the door.\" \"The key \u0027ole\u0027s \u0027id. That brass plate covers it; it\u0027s a patent spring, and he fixes it some\u0027ow from the inside; he presses something, and it slides down; then he turns a screw, and makes it tight.\" \"Can anyone do it but him?\" \"I don\u0027t think they can; it\u0027s \u0027is own idea, he ses.\" \"See how we\u0027re getting on, Wigg. No one can work that brass plate but him; that shows he\u0027s at home.\" He knocked at the door, and called \"Mr. Felix, Mr. Felix!\" \"He\u0027ll give me notice to leave,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"I\u0027m sure he will. He\u0027s the last man in the world to be broke in upon like this.\" \"Leave it to me, my dear,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"I\u0027ll make it all right with him. What did he say to me when I was on this beat? I told you, you remember, Wigg. \u0027Constable,\u0027 says he, \u0027you\u0027re on night duty here.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 I answers. \u0027Very good,\u0027 says he, \u0027I live in this house, and I always make it a point to look after them as looks after me.\u0027 That was a straight tip, and I\u0027m looking after him now. Mr. Felix, Mr. Felix!\" But though he called again and again, and rapped at the door twenty times, he received no answer from within the room. \"It\u0027s singular,\" he said, knitting his brows. \"He must be a sound sleeper, must Mr. Felix. I\u0027ll try again.\" He continued to knock and call \"loud enough,\" as he declared, \"to rouse the dead,\" but no response came to the anxious little group on the landing. \"There\u0027s not only no keyhole,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"but there\u0027s no handle to take hold of. The door\u0027s for all the world like a safe without a knob. Mr. Felix, Mr. Felix, Mr. Felix! Don\u0027t you hear us, sir? I\u0027ve got something particular to say to you.\" For all the effect he produced he might have spoken to a stone wall, and he and Constable Wigg and Mrs. Middlemore stood looking helplessly at each other. \"I tell you what it is,\" he said, tightening his belt, \"this has got beyond a joke. What with the silence, and the bloodstains, and the man with the red handkercher round his neck as run out of the house while Wigg and me was talking together outside, there\u0027s more in this than meets the eye. Now, Mrs. Middlemore, there\u0027s no occasion for us to speak low any more; it\u0027s wearing to the throat. Have you got any doubt at all that the brass plate there couldn\u0027t be fixed as it is unless somebody was inside the room?\" \"I\u0027m certain of it, Mr. Nightingale, I\u0027m certain of it.\" \"Then Mr. Felix, or somebody else, must be there, and if he\u0027s alive couldn\u0027t help hearing us, unless he\u0027s took a sleeping draught of twenty-horse power. There\u0027s a bell wire up there; Wigg, give me a back.\" Constable Wigg stooped, and Constable Nightingale stood on his back and reached the wire, which he pulled smartly for so long a time that Constable Wigg\u0027s back gave way, and brought Constable Nightingale to the ground somewhat unexpectedly. Certainly every person in the house possessed of the sense of hearing must have heard the bell, which had a peculiar resonant ring, and seemed on this occasion to have a hundred ghostly echoes which proclaimed themselves incontinently from attic to basement. No well-behaved echo would have displayed such a lack of method. \"Oughtn\u0027t that to rouse him?\" asked Constable Nightingale. \"It ought to,\" replied Mrs. Middlemore, \"if----\" and then suddenly paused, the \"if\" frozen on her tongue. \"Ah,\" said Constable Nightingale, gravely, \"if!\" There was a window on the landing, and he opened it. The snow dust floated through it, but in less quantities, and there was a perceptible abatement in the violence of the storm. He closed the window. \"It ain\u0027t so bad as it was. Mrs. Middlemore, do you think I could force this door open?\" \"Not without tools,\" said Mrs. Middlemore. \"It\u0027s made of oak.\" \"No harm in trying,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"Here, Wigg, give us a pound.\" They applied their shoulders with a will, but their united efforts produced no impression. \"It\u0027s got to be opened,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"by fair means or foul. Wigg, do you know of a locksmith about here?\" \"I don\u0027t.\" In point of fact Constable Nightingale knew of one, but it was at some little distance, and he did not want to leave Constable Wigg and Mrs. Middlemore alone. \"There\u0027s one in Wardour Street,\" he said. \"Is there?\" said Constable Wigg. \"I\u0027m new to the neighborhood, and I\u0027m certain I shouldn\u0027t be able to find it.\" \"All right,\" said Constable Nightingale, briskly, seeing his way out of the difficulty, \"we\u0027ll go together.\" \"And leave me alone \u0027ere after what\u0027s happened!\" cried Mrs. Middlemore. \"Not if you was to fill my lap with dymens! That \u0027orrid cat \u0027d come and scare the life out of me!\" \"We can\u0027t all go,\" mused Constable Nightingale, with a stern eye on his comrade, \"and I ain\u0027t a man to shirk a duty; but don\u0027t go back on a pal, Wigg, whatever you do.\" \"Nobody could ever bring that against me, Nightingale,\" said Constable Wigg, in an injured tone; \"and I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re driving at.\" \"I hope you don\u0027t,\" said Constable Nightingale, by no means softened, \"that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say. I hope you don\u0027t. You\u0027d better both see me to the door, and shut it after me. And mind you keep your ears open to let me in when I come back.\" Constable Nightingale, a victim to duty, was presently battling with the storm through the deserted streets, while Constable Wigg and Mrs. Middlemore, at the housekeeper\u0027s suggestion, made their way to the warm kitchen, where she brewed for her companion a stiff glass of grog. \"What did Mr. Nightingale mean,\" asked Mrs. Middlemore, \"when he said never go back on a pal?\" \"I\u0027d rather not say,\" replied Constable Wigg, and then appeared suddenly to come to a different conclusion. \"But why not? The last of my wishes would be to vex you, and when you\u0027re curious you like to know, don\u0027t you, my--I beg you a thousand pardons--don\u0027t you, ma\u0027am?\" \"Mr. Wigg,\" observed Mrs. Middlemore, \"I\u0027m a woman, and I do like to know. Oh!\" she cried, with a little shriek, \"was that somebody moving upstairs?\" \"No, my dear, no. Keep close to me; I will protect you and proud of the chance, as who wouldn\u0027t be? When Nightingale threw out that hint, he meant, if I\u0027m not mistook, that a lady should have only one admirer, hisself.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sure!\" \"He\u0027s not a bad sort of fellow, is Nightingale--it ain\u0027t for me to say anything against him--but when he wants a monopoly of something very precious\"--and Constable Wigg looked languishingly at Mrs. Middlemore--\"when he wants that, and as good as says it belongs to him and no one else, he touches a tender point. There\u0027s no harm in my admiring you, my dear; who could help it, that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know? Thank you--I will take another lump of sugar. Yes, who could help it? Charms like yours--if you\u0027ll forgive me for mentioning \u0027em--ain\u0027t to be met with every day, and a man with a heart would have to be blind not to be struck. There! I wouldn\u0027t have spoke so free if it hadn\u0027t been for Nightingale and for your asking me what he meant. But a man can\u0027t always restrain his feelings, and I hope I haven\u0027t hurt yours, my dear.\" \"Not a bit, Mr. Wigg,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, and the tone would have been amorous had it not been for the mysterious trouble in her house; \"you\u0027ve spoke beautiful, and Mr. Nightingale ought to be ashamed of \u0027isself.\" \"Don\u0027t tell him I said anything, my dear.\" \"I won\u0027t. I give you my \u0027and on it.\" He took it and squeezed it, and said, \"What\u0027s passed we\u0027ll keep to ourselves.\" \"We will, Mr. Wigg.\" \"Here\u0027s to our better acquaintance, my dear.\" \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re kindness itself. Oh, Mr. Wigg, I \u0027ope nothing \u0027as \u0027appened to Mr. Felix.\" \"I hope so, too. My opinion is that he\u0027s out, and that the brass plate over the keyhole has got there by accident. But Nightingale always makes the worst of things. That\u0027s not my way. Wait till the worst comes, I say; it\u0027s time enough. You may worrit yourself to death, and be no better off for it after all.\" In this strain they continued their conversation, Mrs. Middlemore declaring that it was quite a comfort to have Constable Wigg with her. She confided to him that she had a bit of money saved, and that Mr. Felix had said more than once that he would remember her in his will, which elicited from Constable Wigg the remark that he hoped Mr. Felix had made his will and had behaved as he ought to; \"though, mind you,\" he added, \"I don\u0027t believe anything\u0027s the matter with him, or that he\u0027s at home. It\u0027s all through that spectre cat, and as for bloodstains, they\u0027ve got to be proved.\" A knocking and rattling at the street-door caused Mrs. Middlemore to cling very closely to him, and when she recovered her fright, they both went upstairs to let Constable Nightingale in. \"Is that you, Nightingale?\" Constable Wigg called out before he turned the key. \"Yes, it\u0027s me,\" cried Constable Nightingale, without: \"don\u0027t keep us waiting all night.\" \"He\u0027s got the locksmith with him,\" whispered Constable Wigg, with his lips very close to Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s ear. Then he threw open the street-door. Constable Nightingale had somebody else with him besides the locksmith. Accompanying them was a tall, thin, gentlemanly-looking, but rather seedy young gentleman, who stepped quickly into the passage. \"Has anything took place?\" inquired Constable Nightingale, glancing suspiciously from Constable Wigg to Mrs. Middlemore. \"Nothing,\" replied Constable Wigg. \"There ain\u0027t been a sound in the house.\" \"Just as we turned the corner,\" said Constable Nightingale, with a motion of his hand toward the seedy young gentleman, \"we met Dr. Lamb, who was coming home from a case, and as there\u0027s no knowing what might be wanted, I asked him to favor us with his company.\" Mrs. Middlemore knew Dr. Lamb, who kept a chemist\u0027s shop in the neighborhood, and she gave him a friendly nod. It must have been a trying case that the young gentleman had come from, for he looked particularly shaky, and was rather unsteady on his legs. The locksmith now made some sensible remarks to the effect that he had been awakened from a sound sleep, and would like to get back to bed again; therefore, had they not better get to work at once? His suggestion was acted upon, and they all proceeded upstairs. \"I\u0027ll give him another chance,\" said Constable Nightingale, and he forthwith exerted the full strength of his lungs and hammered away at the door, to as little purpose as he had previously done. \"There\u0027s nothing for it,\" he said, very red in the face, \"but to force open the door in the name of the law.\" The locksmith, who had brought a basket of tools with him, declared he would make short work of it, but after examining the door was forced to confess inwardly that this was an idle boast. It was of stout oak, and to remove the brass plate and pick the lock occupied him much longer than he expected. However, in the course of about twenty minutes the task was accomplished, and the door stood open for them to enter. Standing for a moment irresolutely on the threshold they were greeted by a blast of cold air. Constable Nightingale was the first to notice that the window was open, and he stepped into the room and closed it. The others followed, and were treading close on his heels when he waved them back, and pointed downward. There, on the floor, was a little pool of blood. They shuddered as they gazed upon it. \"I thought as much,\" said Constable Nightingale, the first to speak. \"There\u0027s been foul play here. Who opened that window, and left it open on such a night? The cry for help you heard, Wigg, came from this room.\" \"But there\u0027s nobody here,\" said Constable Wigg. \"That\u0027s his bedroom,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, in an awestruck voice, pointing to a room the door of which was ajar. They stepped softly toward it, Dr. Lamb now taking the lead. In an arm-chair by the side of the bed sat a man, his arms hanging listlessly down. Dr. Lamb shook him roughly. \"Wake up!\" But the figure did not move. Dr. Lamb leant over the recumbent form, and thrust his hand inside the man\u0027s waistcoat. Then, with his fingers under the man\u0027s chin, he raised the head, so that the face was visible. \"Good Lord!\" cried Mrs. Middlemore. \"It\u0027s Mr. Felix! What\u0027s the matter with him?\" Dr. Lamb put his finger to his lips, and did not immediately reply. When he removed his hand the head dropped down again, hiding the face. \"If you want to know what\u0027s the matter with the man,\" he said, presently, \"he\u0027s dead.\" \"Dead!\" exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore. \"As a doornail,\" said Dr. Lamb.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48880.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
