The light of a lamp was shining upon her form, which was stooping forward in the direction of the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It had already been mentioned that the tide on this night was unusually high, and our reporter was apprehensive, from the position of the woman, that she was contemplating suicide. If so she had chosen a favorable moment to put her sad design into execution, for there was no person near enough to prevent her had she been expeditious. She looked neither to the right nor to the left, but down before her on the rolling river. Our reporter hastened his steps, in fear least he should be too late to arrest her purpose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unseen by them another man was approaching the woman, but not so rapidly as our reporter. This was a policeman who had emerged from the shadows of the Waterloo steps on the opposite side, and as, when he started, he was nearer to her than our reporter, they both reached her at the same moment. Each becoming aware of the other\u0027s presence, they would have shown recognition of it had not their attention been diverted by a sufficiently startling proceeding on the part of the woman. Still unaware that there were witnesses of her movements, she leaned forward at a perilous angle, and with all her strength threw some heavy object into the water. The force she used destroyed her balance, and she would have fallen into the river had not the policeman and our reporter laid violent hands upon her, and dragged her from her dangerous position on the ramparts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Just in time, thank God!\u0027 said our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Just too late,\u0027 retorted the policeman. \u0027A moment sooner, and we should have saved her baby.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Her baby!\u0027 exclaimed our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes. Didn\u0027t you hear the poor thing give a scream?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027No.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You must be hard of hearing. First a sob, then a scream. Now, then, own up!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He shook the woman roughly, but obtained no response from her. She was cowering to the flagstones, her face hidden in her hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our reporter is not the stamp of man to stand idly by while the life of a human being is in danger. He stripped off his coat and waistcoat with the speed of lightning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027That\u0027s your sort,\u0027 said the policeman. \u0027I can\u0027t swim; you can.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not a stroke,\u0027 said our reporter, and was about to plunge into the river when the woman sprang up and caught his arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027For God\u0027s sake,\u0027 she said, trembling with agitation, \u0027do not risk your life for nothing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Your baby is drowning,\u0027 cried our reporter. \u0027Let me go!\u0027 He strove vainly to extricate himself from her clutch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You shall not, you shall not!\u0027 said the woman. \u0027As Heaven is my judge, I have done no wrong. I have no baby; I came out alone. You are a gentleman. By all that is sacred I speak the truth!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027The policeman says he heard a scream.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027He is mistaken. I beg you to believe me. Oh, unhappy woman that I am? Have I not one friend in all the wide world?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was not alone her words that carried conviction with them, it was her deep distress, and the evident sincerity with which she spoke. Moreover, now that our reporter had the opportunity of observing her closely, he saw that she was not of a common stamp. There was a refinement in her voice and manner which impressed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I believe you,\u0027 he said, and slowly put on his waistcoat and coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027The chance is lost,\u0027 said the policeman, with a scornful smile; \u0027the poor thing is dead by this time. A put-up job, my man. I wasn\u0027t born yesterday.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He had noted the dialogue between the woman and our reporter, some portion of which had escaped him, and his suspicions were aroused. He was not entirely without justification. Seeing upon one side of her a policeman, and on the other side a gentleman, the woman, being undoubtedly of the better class, had gravitated naturally toward our reporter. Thus at once was established, without premeditation, a conflict of interests in the eyes of the policeman. He represented the Law, which is invariably more suspicious than sympathetic. Opposing him were two strangers who might be in collusion. Hunting in couples, one of either sex, was a common trick of the criminal classes, with which every policeman is familiar. The officer with whom we are dealing was not of an analytic turn; he jumped rather at conclusions than motives; therefore, he pronounced the verdict first and examined the evidence afterward, or left it to others to examine. All that he was honestly concerned in was the performance of his duty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Did you not hear her say,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027that she was alone, and no baby with her?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I heard something of the sort,\u0027 replied the policeman, candidly, believing it is another matter. \u0027I believe in my own ears. Are you a confederate of hers?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our reporter laughed, and his laugh strengthened the policeman\u0027s suspicions and excited his ire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Perhaps you will both deny,\u0027 he said, \u0027that something was thrown into the river.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I certainly heard a splash,\u0027 said our reporter, and he looked at the woman for confirmation, but she said nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027We\u0027ll fish it up, whatever it is,\u0027 said the policeman. \u0027If it isn\u0027t a baby--which I say it is, as I heard it cry--it\u0027s stolen property. Pretty nigh as bad.\u0027 So saying, he blew his whistle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The sound terrified the woman; she clung to our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027What need is there to summon assistance?\u0027 asked our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I know what I\u0027m up to,\u0027 replied the policeman. \u0027I\u0027ll trouble you to come to the police station. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I intend to do so. Are you going to charge this lady?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A grateful sob escaped the woman, produced by the reference to her as a lady no less than by the considerate tone in which it was made. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027If you\u0027re particularly anxious to know,\u0027 said the policeman, \u0027I am going to charge you both.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much amused, our reporter asked, \u0027What do you charge her with?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027First, with drowning her baby; next, with attempting to commit suicide.\u0027 He paused in the middle of the sentence to blow his whistle again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027And what is your charge against me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Aiding and abetting. Come,\u0027 he said to the woman, putting his hand under her chin and attempting to raise her face to the light, \u0027let me have a look at you. A hundred to one I\u0027ve seen you before.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was so rough that the woman cried out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Be very careful,\u0027 said our reporter, in a warning tone. \u0027If you use violence it will go against you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It will go against you,\u0027 retorted the policeman, who was losing his discretion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027That is to be seen,\u0027 said our reporter, gravely, \u0027when we reach the police-station. Meanwhile, you are acting outside your right in compelling this lady to look you in the face.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Very well,\u0027 said the policeman, surlily, beginning to be shaken by the temperate conduct of our reporter, \u0027I hear assistance coming; I\u0027ll wait.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The measured tread of another policeman was heard in the near distance. Our reporter stood still, perfectly calm and self-possessed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The woman, now sobbing bitterly, drew her handkerchief from her pocket, and a piece of paper, which she undesignedly and unwittingly drew forth with it, fluttered to the ground. Only the sharp eyes of our reporter saw it, and he stooped and picked it up. He glanced at it without attracting the attention of the policeman, and what he saw both greatly astonished him and influenced his future course with respect to the woman. He felt instinctively that he held in his hand a thread, however slight and slender, in the Mystery of Monsieur Felix. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our readers will remember that in certain editions of the Evening Moon we inserted an advertisement referring to the death of M. Felix, but lest the precise terms of that advertisement should be forgotten by them we reprint it here, to refresh their memory. The advertisement ran as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027The Strange Death of M. Felix, in Gerard Street, Soho. Persons who had private or other interviews with M. Felix between the hours of eight in the morning and twelve at night on the 16th of January, or who are in possession of information which will throw light upon the circumstances surrounding his death, are urgently requested to call at the office of the Evening Moon, at any time after the appearance of this advertisement. Liberal rewards will be paid to all who give such information, and the best legal assistance is offered by the proprietors of this journal, entirely at their own expense, to all, who may desire it and who are in any way interested in M. Felix\u0027s death.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Up to the present time the advertisement had been productive of no result of any value. A great many persons had called at our office respecting it, but they knew nothing that was likely to be of assistance to us; their aim was to obtain money without giving an equivalent for it. That the step we took, however, was not useless was proved by what our reporter now held in his hand. It was the advertisement, cut carefully from our journal, pasted upon a sheet of note-paper, and framed, as it were, in clear lines of red ink. Surely it was not without reason that the woman had been thus painstaking with this extract. Surely there must be some connecting link between her and M. Felix, whose death and subsequent disappearance were still enveloped in mystery. Thus thought our reporter the moment his eyes fell upon the advertisement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The approach of the second policeman afforded him an opportunity of speaking to her concerning it. While the two policemen were talking, the second asking for information, the first giving it, he exchanged a few words with the woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You have dropped something,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She put her hand hastily in her pocket and discovered her loss. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I have it,\u0027 said our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It is only a piece of paper,\u0027 said the woman; \u0027give it back to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You had better let me keep it,\u0027 he said. \u0027You will be charged and searched at the police-station----\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She interrupted him, saying, in a pitiful voice, \u0027Will they not let me go--oh will they not let me go?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027They will not,\u0027 replied our reporter, \u0027and they are not to be blamed. They are merely doing their duty. You have acted in a way which throws suspicion upon you----\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I have done nothing wrong,\u0027 she said, interrupting him again; and that she regarded him as being well disposed toward her was proved by her speaking in a low tone, notwithstanding her anguish of mind, \u0027indeed, indeed I have not!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I believe you; they will not. I will not ask you what you have done; if you confide in me it must be of your own free will; but you may truly believe that I am desirous and willing to be your friend, your sincere and earnest friend. Something more; I may be able to assist you in a manner you little dream of. The paper you have dropped is an advertisement from the Evening Moon, referring to the death of M. Felix.\u0027 She shivered at the name, raised her eyes, and dropped them again. This gave him an opportunity of observing that they were of a peculiar and beautiful tinge of blue, and the soft pathetic light they shed touched him deeply. \u0027Be patient a moment,\u0027 he continued; \u0027I must have a little private talk with you before we get to the police station, and I think I can manage it.\u0027 He had seen and recognized the face of the second policeman, who now, as he came forward, greeted him respectfully. \u0027Your comrade here,\u0027 said our reporter, jocosely, \u0027believes that I am engaged in some unlawful conspiracy. You know who I am. Set his mind at rest.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It happened fortunately that this second policeman and our reporter were old acquaintances, and had spent many an hour together in the still watches of the night. A few words whispered in the ear of the first policeman settled his doubts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I beg your pardon, sir,\u0027 he said, apologetically, \u0027but mistakes will happen in the best regulated families.\u0027 A remark which denoted that the worthy and zealous officer was not deficient in a sense of humor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027A mistake has happened here,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027I presume that you do not now intend to charge me with aiding and abetting.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not a bit of it, sir. It was only my joke.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You have a queer way of airing your jokes, but I cannot reasonably complain; you had grounds for suspicion. And now about this lady.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t ask me to neglect my duty, sir. I must take her to the station.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027She denies that she has done anything wrong.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027They all do that, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Do you persist in your charges against her?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Well, sir, about the baby I won\u0027t be sure now; it\u0027s as likely as not I was mistaken in thinking I heard it scream; but we\u0027ll try to prove the rights of the thing. I don\u0027t give way, sir, in my belief that she attempted to commit suicide.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I am a properly qualified solicitor,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027and I shall appear for her, and shall also offer myself as an eye-witness of the affair. I shall support her in her statement that she had no intention of committing suicide.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I can\u0027t help that, sir,\u0027 said the policeman, with respectful pertinacity, \u0027I can only report what I saw, and I must do my duty. She nearly fell into the river; I hope you won\u0027t deny that, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I will not deny it. You are speaking now quite fairly and temperately, and I hope to bring you round to my view.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027To let her off, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I can\u0027t do it, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But listen to reason. She accidentally lost her balance----\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027And,\u0027 interposed the policeman, \u0027would have fallen in had it not been for us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027That does not establish a charge of an attempt at suicide.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It must be looked into, sir,\u0027 said the policeman, stiffly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It seems to me,\u0027 said the second policeman, \u0027that it all depends upon what it was she threw into the river.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Without asking permission our reporter stepped aside with the woman, and spoke privately to her. She had listened to the conversation in an agonized state of mind, turning her eyes alternately to her accuser and her defender with the air of one who was being hunted down. Helpless, despairing innocence was depicted in her face, and the favorable impression she had produced upon our reporter was strengthened. Had she not in his belief been connected in a manner yet to be explained with the Mystery of M. Felix he would have been inclined to champion her cause, and because of this belief he would have ranked himself on her side even if he had supposed that the charges brought against her were true. Without a shade of doubt she was a lady; her attire, although it bore no indications of worldly prosperity, her manners, her speech, unmistakably proclaimed the fact. She was apparently a little over forty years of age, and there were traces of long-endured suffering on her features. In her youth she must have possessed remarkable beauty, which even now could not fail in attracting attention; her figure was slight and graceful, her movements gentle and refined. These signs rendered her appearance at such an hour and under such circumstances sufficiently perplexing, but our reporter was satisfied to trust to the future for a satisfactory explanation of what at present, to a vulgar mind, was full of suspicion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In stating that he was a properly qualified solicitor our reporter stated a simple fact. He had served articles in a solicitor\u0027s office, and had abandoned that profession for one which possessed greater attractions for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It occurred to him to test her, and he addressed her in French. She replied to him in the same language, but with an accent which put his to the blush. We shall, however, give what passed between them in our native tongue, for the sake of perfect clearness, and in the interests of those of our readers who may not be familiar with any other language than their own. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You have not deceived me?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Indeed, indeed, I have not,\u0027 she replied, earnestly. \u0027I have spoken the truth. You will not desert me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I will not. You may count upon me as a sincere friend; but you must confide in me implicitly. I will serve you honestly and faithfully. You have met with misfortunes?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Great misfortunes. I am a most unhappy woman!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Have you any other friends in London in whom you would confide in preference to me? If you have and will give me their names and addresses, I will bring them to you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I have no other friend in this city in whom I can confide.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not one who can assist you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not one.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Are you quite unknown here?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But surely you are not entirely alone?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She made an effort to speak, but words failed her; she raised her imploring eyes to his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Strive to master your agitation,\u0027 he continued, \u0027and bend your mind upon the position in which you stand. You heard what the policeman said?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Will you tell them what it was you threw into the river?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I cannot tell them. It might injure--it might ruin me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Was it property of your own?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It was.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027To which no person but yourself has a claim?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It was my own; no person but myself has a claim to it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027The loss or recovery of which would injure no one?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027No one but myself.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Now, consider. You will be taken to the police station and charged.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But they will let me go until to-morrow?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027They will not. If I, a stranger to you, offered bail, it would not be accepted. You will be locked up till the morning.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027My God!\u0027 cried the woman. \u0027What will become of her--oh, what will become of her?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Of her? Then you are not entirely alone in this city?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I have a daughter,\u0027 she said, in a low, despairing tone. \u0027She will be distracted if I do not return to her to-night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027As I have explained to you, that is out of the question. If you are not unwilling, I will go to her and explain matters.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027No, no!\u0027 cried the woman. \u0027She must not know the truth! What have I done that this misfortune should fall upon me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I feel deeply for you. If I knew how I could inspire you with confidence in me I should be glad. Look at me and say whether you cannot trust implicitly in me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They gazed at each other in silence for many moments. The policemen, standing apart, did not interrupt them, and as they spoke in French, could not have understood if they had heard what was passing. The woman put out her hand timidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I will trust you,\u0027 she said. \u0027It may be that the good Lord has sent me a friend when I most needed one. By the memory of all that is dearest to you, do not betray me!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I swear solemnly that I will not.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The pressure of her hand seemed to instil faith in her. All the earnestness of her soul was expressed in the words she now spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I give into your charge what is infinitely more precious than life--my honor, and my dear daughter\u0027s happiness. May Heaven so deal by you as you deal by me!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I am content,\u0027 said our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At this juncture the first policeman thought he had allowed sufficient time for a decision. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Time presses, sir,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Then we had better go to the station,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027if you persist in your ridiculous charge.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027There is nothing else for me to do, sir,\u0027 said the policeman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You have no objection to my walking by the side of this lady, keeping yourself out of hearing. I wish to receive instructions from her.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Give me your word, sir, that there will be no attempt at escape.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027There shall not be.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said the second policeman, \u0027you may take the gentleman\u0027s word for a good deal more than that. You won\u0027t want me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He left them, and our reporter and the woman, preceded by the policeman, who occasionally looked over his shoulder to see that they were following him, walked to the Bow Street Police Station.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48890.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
