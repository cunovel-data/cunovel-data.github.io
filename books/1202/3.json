{"id":43674,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. A THRILLING INCIDENT.","content":"\"The wonder is,\" said Constable Nightingale, while Mrs. Middlemore shook the snow out of her clothes, \"how you had the courage to venture out in such weather.\" \"It\u0027s \u0027abit, Mr. Nightingale, that\u0027s what it is. Once I get to doing a thing regular, done it must be if I want to keep my peace of mind. There wouldn\u0027t be a wink of sleep for me if I didn\u0027t go and fetch my supper beer myself every night. I don\u0027t keep a gal, Mr. Winks----\" \"Wigg,\" said that gentleman in correction, with a dreamy look at the beer-jug. \"I beg you a thousand pardons, Mr. Wigg, I\u0027m sure. I don\u0027t keep a gal, and that\u0027s why my place is always nice and clean, as you see it now. If you want your work done, do it yourself--that\u0027s my motter. Not that I can\u0027t afford to keep a gal, but Mr. Felix he ses when he come to me about the rooms when I didn\u0027t \u0027ave a blessed lodger in the \u0027ouse, \u0027I\u0027ll take \u0027em,\u0027 he ses, \u0027conditionally. You mustn\u0027t let a room in the place to anybody but me.\u0027 \u0027But I make my living out of the rooms, sir,\u0027 ses I, \u0027and I can\u0027t afford to let \u0027em remain empty.\u0027 \u0027You can afford,\u0027 ses Mr. Felix, \u0027if I pay for \u0027em remaining empty. What rent do you arks for the whole \u0027ouse with the exception of the basement?\u0027 I opened my mouth wide, I don\u0027t mind telling you that, Mr. Wigg, when I put a price upon the \u0027ouse. All he ses is, \u0027Agreed.\u0027 \u0027Then there\u0027s attendance, sir,\u0027 I ses. \u0027How much for that?\u0027 he arks. I opens my mouth wide agin, and all he ses is, \u0027Agreed.\u0027 You see, Mr. Wigg, seeing as\u0027 ow you\u0027re a friend of Mr. Nightingale\u0027s, and as no friend of his\u0027n can be anything but a gentleman, there\u0027s no \u0027arm in my telling you a thing or two about Mr. Felix, more especially as you\u0027re on night duty \u0027ere.\" \"Here\u0027s to our better acquaintance,\" said Constable Wigg, laying hands on the beer-jug in an absent kind of way, and raising it to his mouth. When, after a long interval, he put it down again with a sigh of intense satisfaction, he met the reproachful gaze of Constable Nightingale, who gasped: \"Well, of all the cheek! Without ever being asked!\" \"Love your heart,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"what does that matter? He\u0027s as welcome as the flowers in May, being a friend of your\u0027n.\" She handed the jug to Constable Nightingale, asking, as she did so, \"Did you ever \u0027ave a inspiration, Mr. Nightingale?\" Constable Nightingale did not immediately reply, his face being buried in the jug. When it was free, and he had wiped his mouth, he said, in a mild tone--any harsh judgment he may have harbored against Constable Wigg being softened by the refreshing draught-- \"I must have had one to-night when I come this way, out of my beat, to have a talk with Wigg, and to see that you was all right. The taters in the oven\u0027ll be burnt to a cinder if they\u0027re not took out immediate.\" \"You\u0027ve got a nose for baked taters, you \u0027ave,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, admiringly. \"Trust you for finding out things without eyes! But you always can smell what I\u0027ve got in the oven.\" Constable Wigg rubbed his hands joyously when he saw Mrs. Middlemore lay three plates and draw three chairs up to the table. Then she whipped the baked potatoes out of the oven, saying, \"Done to a turn. Now we can talk and \u0027ave supper at the same time. Make yourself at \u0027ome, Mr. Wigg, and \u0027elp yourself to what you like. I\u0027ll \u0027ave a bit of fowl, Mr. Nightingale, and jest a thin slice of the cold pork, if you please Mr. Wigg. It\u0027s a favorite dish of yours, I can see. Mr. Nightingale, you won\u0027t make compliments, I\u0027m sure. You\u0027re the last man as ought to in this \u0027ouse.\" Constable Nightingale pressed her foot under the table, and she smiled at him, and continued, \"I was going to tell you about my inspiration when I got the supper beer. A pint and a half won\u0027t be enough,\u0027 ses I to myself; a pint and a half\u0027s my regular allowance, Mr. Wigg, and I don\u0027t find it too much, because I don\u0027t drink sperrits. \u0027A pint and a half won\u0027t be enough,\u0027 ses I to myself; \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if a friend dropped in, so I\u0027ll double it.\u0027 And I did.\" \"That\u0027s something like an inspiration,\" said Constable Nightingale, looking amorously at Mrs. Middlemore, who smiled amorously at him in return. Constable Wigg cut these amorous inclinings short by remarking, \"We was talking of Mr. Felix. Nightingale commenced twice to-night telling a story about him, and it\u0027s not told yet.\" \"Not my fault, Wigg,\" Constable Nightingale managed to say, with his mouth full. \"I\u0027ll tell my story first,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"and he can tell his afterward. Try them sausages, Mr. Wigg. Mr. Felix always \u0027as the best of everythink. I buy \u0027em at Wall\u0027s. So when he ses \u0027Agreed\u0027 to the rent and attendance, he ses, \u0027And about servants?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t afford to keep more than one, sir,\u0027 I ses. \u0027You can, ses he; \u0027you can afford to keep none. You\u0027ll find me the best tenant you ever \u0027ad, and what you\u0027ve got to do is to foller my instructions. \u0027I\u0027ll do my best, sir,\u0027 ses I. \u0027It\u0027ll pay you,\u0027 ses he, \u0027to let me do exactly as I please, and never to cross me.\u0027 And I\u0027m bound to say, Mr. Wigg, that it \u0027as paid me never to cross \u0027im and never to arks questions. \u0027We shall git along capitally together,\u0027 ses he, \u0027without servants. They\u0027re a prying, idle lot, and I won\u0027t \u0027ave \u0027em creeping up the stairs on welwet toes to find out what I\u0027m doing. So keep none, Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 he ses, \u0027not the ghost of one. You can wait on me without assistance. If I want to entertain a visitor or two I\u0027ll \u0027ave the meals brought in ready cooked, and if we want hextra attendance I\u0027ll git Gunter to send in a man as knows \u0027is business and can \u0027old \u0027is tongue.\u0027 Of course I was agreeable to that, and he pays me down a month in advance, like the gentleman he is. Though I don\u0027t drink sperrits, Mr. Nightingale, that\u0027s no reason why you should deny yourself. You know where the bottle is, and per\u0027aps Mr. Wigg will jine you.\" \"Mrs. Middlemore,\" said Constable Wigg, \"you\u0027re a lady after my own heart, and I\u0027m glad I\u0027m alive. Here\u0027s looking toward you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Wigg,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"and what I say is it\u0027s a shame that men like you and Mr. Nightingale should be trapesing the streets with the snow coming down and the wind a-blowing as it is now. Jest listen to it; it\u0027s going on worse than ever. Might I take the liberty of inquiring--you being on the beat, Mr. Wigg--whether you sor a lady come out of the house while I was gone for the supper beer?\" \"No lady came out of the house,\" replied Constable Wigg. \"A man did.\" \"A man!\" cried Mrs. Middlemore. \"Not Mr. Felix, surely!\" \"No, not him,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"A strange-looking man with a red handkercher round his neck.\" \"A strange-looking man, with a red \u0027andkercher round \u0027is neck?\" exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore. \"\u0027Ow did he git in?\" \"That\u0027s not for us to say,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"Perhaps Mr. Felix let him in when you was away.\" \"Yes, most likely,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, with an air of confusion which she strove vainly to conceal from the observation of her visitors; \"of course, that must be. Mr. Felix often lets people in \u0027isself. \u0027Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 he ses sometimes, \u0027if there\u0027s a ring or a knock at the door, I\u0027ll attend to it. You needn\u0027t trouble yourself.\u0027 And I don\u0027t--knowing \u0027im, and knowing it\u0027ll pay me better to foller \u0027is instructions. For there\u0027s never a time that sech a thing \u0027appens that Mr. Felix doesn\u0027t say to me afterward, \u0027Here\u0027s a half-sovering for you, Mrs. Middlemore.\u0027\" \"You\u0027re in for one to-morrow morning, then,\" observed Constable Wigg, \"because it was a man we saw and not a woman.\" \"He won\u0027t forgit it,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"not \u0027im. He\u0027s too free and generous with \u0027is money, so long as he\u0027s let alone, and not pry\u0027d upon. What he does is no business of mine, and I\u0027m not going to make it mine.\" \"Ah,\" Mrs. Middlemore, said Constable Wigg, emptying his second glass of whiskey, \"you know which side your bread is buttered.\" \"I wasn\u0027t born yesterday,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, with a shrewd smile, \"and I\u0027ve seed things that I keep to myself. Why not? You\u0027d do the same if you was in my shoes, wouldn\u0027t you?\" \"That we would,\" replied both the policeman in one breath; and Constable Wigg added, \"You\u0027re a lucky woman to have such a lodger.\" \"Well,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, \"I don\u0027t deny it. I never met with such a man as Mr. Felix, and I don\u0027t believe there is another. Why, when he took possession, he ses, \u0027Clear out every bit of furniture there is in the rooms. Send it to auction if you like and sell it, and pocket the money. When I leave you shall either \u0027ave all my furniture, or I\u0027ll furnish the rooms over agin according to your fancy, and it shan\u0027t cost you a penny.\u0027 I was agreeable. Because why? Because he give me forty pound on account, to show that he was in earnest. Then he begins to furnish, and if you was to see \u0027is rooms, Mr. Wigg, you\u0027d be that took aback that you wouldn\u0027t know what to say. All sorts of wonderful woods, satings, picters, swords and daggers, strange rugs and carpets, painted plates and dishes, \u0027angings, old lamps, and goodness only knows what I don\u0027t understand \u0027arf of \u0027em. There! I\u0027ve talked enough about Mr. Felix for once. Let\u0027s talk of something else.\" \"Do you keep cats, Mrs. Middlemore?\" asked Constable Nightingale, brewing another grog for himself and Constable Wigg. \"I don\u0027t,\" replied Mrs. Middlemore. \"Mr. Felix won\u0027t \u0027ave one in the \u0027ouse.\" \"There\u0027s one in the house now, though,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"It come in when the wind burst open the street door, and Wigg and me fell into the passage. He says it\u0027s not a cat, but a spectre, a ghost.\" \"Lord save us!\" ejaculated Mrs. Middlemore. \"If Mr. Felix sees it he\u0027ll never forgive me. He \u0027as a \u0027atred of \u0027em. And the ghost of a cat, too!\" She was so impressed that she edged closer to Constable Nightingale. \"It was a spectre cat,\" said Constable Wigg, desirous to do something to divert Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s thoughts from Mr. Felix, and also from her leaning toward his comrade. \"And then there was that cry for \u0027Help\u0027 I fancied I heard.\" \"What cry for help?\" asked Mrs. Middlemore. \"I thought I heard it three times,\" said Constable Wigg--but he was prevented from going further by an incident which was followed by a startling picture. Constable Nightingale, rather thrown off his balance by the drink he had imbibed, and desirous to meet the advances of Mrs. Middlemore, slyly put his arm round her waist, and to hide the movement from the observation of his brother constable, made a clumsy movement over the table, and overturned the candle, the effect of which was to put out the light and to leave them in darkness. He was not sorry for it, for the reason that he was hugging Mrs. Middlemore close. But Constable Wigg started up in fear, and cried: \"Somebody has pushed open the door!\" In point of fact the kitchen-door had been quietly pushed open, and the other two observed it when their attention was directed toward it. \"What is it?\" whispered Mrs. Middlemore, shaking like a jelly, \"Oh, what is it?\" Constable Nightingale, for the second time that night pulled out his dark lantern, and cast its light upon the door. And there, imbedded in the circle of light, was the cat which had already twice before alarmed Constable Wigg. They uttered a cry of horror, and indeed they were justified by the picture which presented itself. The cat was red. Every bristle, sticking up on its skin, was luminous with horrible color. It was a perfect ball of blood.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48878.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
