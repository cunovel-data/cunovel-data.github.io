{"id":43718,"no":47,"title":"CHAPTER XLVII. I RECEIVE A STRANGE VISITOR.","content":"Before I went to bed a little incident occurred which it may be as well to mention. It will be in the remembrance of the reader that when I discovered the dagger which M. Felix had thrown at Emilia on the occasion of her visit to him, I placed it behind the massive sideboard in the sitting-room, my purpose being to conceal it from prying eyes. Curious to see whether the weapon had been disturbed I took a candle and looked. It was still there, and I was about to move away when my attention was attracted to another object which lay edgewise by its side. This object was a photograph, which had evidently dropped behind the sideboard, and had lain there neglected for some time. Thinking it might be the photograph of M. Felix I managed to nick it forward, and presently was able to reach it with my hand. It was covered with dust, which I blew away, disclosing the picture of a young man with a handsome, prepossessing face. \"If this is a likeness of M. Felix,\" I mused, \"it proves how little the features of a man are an index to his character.\" There was something peculiarly winning in the expression of the face; and there was a smile in the eyes and on the lips. The picture had faded with time, but was still distinct and clear in its outlines. I determined to ask Mrs. Middlemore in the morning whether it was a likeness of M. Felix, and I put it on the table and retired to bed. I had had a long and tiring day, and I slept soundly. At eight o\u0027clock I jumped up, ready and eager to resume the task upon which I was engaged. I had almost finished dressing when my eyes fell upon the picture I had found upon the previous night, and I took it again in my hand and examined it by the morning\u0027s light. Looking at the back of the card I saw some writing there, the name of a man and a date which fixed the time at nineteen years ago. The name was \"Gerald Paget.\" I was inexpressibly relieved. The picture, then, was not that of M. Felix, but of Emilia\u0027s husband. I was glad to possess it, and glad also of the mute evidence it presented, denoting that the original must have been of a frank and honest nature. I put it in my pocket without scruple; intrinsically the portrait was of no value, and I considered myself entitled to appropriate it. To make sure, however, that the likeness was not that of M. Felix, I showed it to Mrs. Middlemore, without informing her how I had become possessed of it. She had never seen it, she said, and it was not a portrait of M. Felix, who was a different kind of man. Satisfied on this point I went out with Sophy to hire a servant to take her place in her absence. We had no difficulty in obtaining one; as Sophy had said, we could have obtained a score, and we picked out the nicest and most amenable, the choice being Sophy\u0027s, upon whose judgment in this selection it was safest to depend. The new domestic being officially installed in Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s kitchen, I gave that worthy woman \"something on account,\" and bade her good-morning, and told her that Sophy and I would probably be absent for two or three weeks. \"You\u0027ll take care of \u0027er, sir, I\u0027m sure,\" said Mrs. Middlemore. \"You need have no anxiety,\" I replied. \"She will be quite safe with me.\" Before these words were exchanged I had asked Sophy whether she was still of the same mind as she had been on the previous evening. \"\u0027Course I am,\" said Sophy. \"I wouldn\u0027t give it up for nothink you could orfer me.\" She had given herself \"a good scrub,\" and had tidied her hair, and I was surprised at the difference this made in her appearance. \"Now, Sophy,\" I said, after I had bidden Mrs. Middlemore good-by, \"here are four sovereigns. Go to some wardrobe shop where you are not known, and buy a complete outfit of second-hand decent clothes, stockings, petticoats, boots, and everything you wear, and come to my rooms in them at half-past one. Be careful that you choose neat clothing, nothing showy or conspicuous; the way you are dressed the next time I see you will prove whether you understand what it is I wish you to do.\" \"You sha\u0027n\u0027t find fault with me,\" said Sophy, with tears in her eyes. \"I never thought I should \u0027ave sech a slice of luck as this.\" At noon I was in my chambers, having arranged with the editor of the Evening Moon for another absence from duty. Bob Tucker was to come at one, and I employed the intervening minutes in setting things right in my rooms. I should have liked to go to Emilia for the purpose of showing her the picture I had found, and of receiving confirmation that it was a portrait of her husband, but I had not the time. The chimes of Westminster had just proclaimed the half-hour when I heard a knock at the outer door of my chambers. \"Bob is early,\" I thought, and I went and opened the door. A stranger confronted me, a middle-aged man, with sandy hair and light fluffy whiskers, and of a rather ponderous build. \"I have come to see Mr. Agnold,\" said the stranger. \"He is busy,\" I replied, testily, \"and cannot be seen.\" I did not know the man, and the business I had to transact was too important for interruption. \"I will wait,\" said the stranger, coolly. \"It will be useless waiting,\" I said. \"Mr. Agnold cannot be seen to-day.\" \"I will wait till to-morrow,\" said the stranger, pulling his fluffy whiskers, and gazing at me with more than warrantable attention. \"Yes,\" I said, \"call to-morrow, and unless your errand is urgent and personal do not call at all. Mr. Agnold\u0027s time is valuable.\" I closed the door unceremoniously in his face and re-entered my sitting-room. My behavior is open to an unfavorable construction, I admit, but bachelors living in chambers in the houses roundabout are much annoyed by persons who intrude at all unseasonable hours, and who for the most part turn out to be commercial travellers desirous to show you samples of goods you do not want. But there was another reason in this particular instance for my unceremonious treatment of the uninvited visitor. All the time he was speaking to me I was conscious that he was observing me in a manner which I resented. There was an intentional rudeness in his pertinacious scrutiny which aroused in me a certain anger, which, reasonably or unreasonably, was a guide in my conduct toward him. I resumed my employment, but my mind was disturbed by the incident, and I could not drive it away. The man could not be a commercial traveller, I reflected, for those individuals are models of pleasantry and politeness, and do everything in their power to win your good graces. What, therefore, could be his object in paying me a visit? Had I done wrong in sending him away without inquiring its nature? \"Confound the fellow!\" I said. \"He has got into my head and is likely to remain there, a fixture. I suppose he has gone.\" I went to the door and threw it open. On a little bench in the lobby outside sat the man, quietly and patiently. \"Not gone!\" I cried. \"Not gone,\" he replied. \"You heard what I said, did you not?\" \"Perfectly. You said Mr. Agnold cannot be seen today. Upon which I replied that I would wait till to-morrow.\" \"To wait here?\" I exclaimed. \"Yes, to wait here till to-morrow, or the next day, or the next. In point of fact, to wait till I have had a few minutes\u0027 chat with Mr. Agnold.\" \"I am Mr. Agnold,\" I said, angrily. \"I knew that all along,\" he said, with irritating politeness. \"What is it you want with me? Will you detain me long?\" \"Not very long; it will depend upon yourself. I come on behalf of Dr. Peterssen.\" My anger instantly subsided; I became as cool as my visitor. \"Enter,\" I said, \"and let us get it over. Who is Dr. Peterssen, and what has he got to do with me, or I with him?\" These last words were spoken when my visitor and I were standing face to face in my sitting-room. \"Oh, I am not here to answer questions,\" said my visitor. \"I have a commission to execute, and a question or two myself to ask on behalf of Dr. Peterssen.\" \"Which I shall answer or not, as I please.\" \"Of course it is entirely within your discretion; I cannot force you; I am merely an instrument.\" \"I must know with whom I am conversing,\" I said, \"before we proceed further.\" He handed me a card, on which was printed, \"Mr. Nettlefold, The Elms, Ealing.\" \"I never heard of you,\" I said, putting the card on the table. \"I can\u0027t help that,\" he responded. \"Perhaps it will expedite matters if I inform you that I do not come from Dr. Peterssen direct. Before presenting myself to you I paid a visit to Mr. Bob Tucker.\" I was confounded. Was the cunning scheme suggested by Bob, and to carry out which I had enlisted Sophy\u0027s services, to be nipped in the bud? \"Mr. Tucker,\" continued Mr. Nettlefold, \"refused all explanations, and referred me to you, who, it seems, are the prime mover in this affair.\" \"In what affair?\" \"As you are aware, Dr. Peterssen resides at Tylney House, Sheldon. He desires this fact to be widely known, having no motives for secrecy. Mr. Bob Tucker has been prowling about this neighborhood lately, making inquiries concerning Dr. Peterssen, and prying into his private affairs in a manner to which Dr. Peterssen does not propose to submit.\" \"A nice mess Bob has made of it,\" I thought. \"What a fool I was to trust to him!\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Nettlefold, \"did you speak?\" \"I did not.\" \"I thought I saw your lips move. To continue. Mr. Bob Tucker could not have been aware that while he was thus clumsily playing Paul Pry, he was himself being watched, and that all the information given to him of Dr. Peterssen\u0027s affairs was false. When Mr. Tucker left Sheldon he was followed and his address in London discovered. He paid you a visit last night, and your address was discovered. I am commissioned by Dr. Peterssen to inquire your motive for your proceedings?\" \"I shall answer no questions. Finish your commission, and go.\" \"Very well. I am instructed to say that should Mr. Bob Tucker, or you, or any person in your employ, come again to Sheldon for the purpose of making injurious inquiries, he, you, or the other person will receive a sound horsewhipping, and after that a ducking in a convenient pond. That is all. Have you anything to say?\" \"Just one observation. You can tell Dr. Peterssen in the plainest possible terms that I know him to be an infernal scoundrel, and that it is my intention to expose him. I shall visit Sheldon very soon, and he will have an opportunity of putting his threats into execution; it will then be seen who has the most to fear, he or I. There is the door, Mr. Nettlefold. Remove yourself quickly, if you do not wish to be removed.\" To my astonishment, my visitor, instead of hurrying to the door, threw himself into my most comfortable arm-chair, and burst into a loud fit of laughter. I had not recovered from my astonishment before he spoke. \"Capital. Capital. Settled my disguise last night. Carried it out this morning. Took me about an hour. Altered my voice. Altered the way I speak as Bob Tucker. Changed my clothes. And my hair. And my manner. Rather good isn\u0027t it? Compliment me.\" And there in my chair sat, not Mr. Nettlefold, but my old friend Bob Tucker, laughing and wagging his head at the trick he had played me. \"Upon my word, Bob,\" I said with a feeling of great relief, \"you gave me a turn. I should never have known you.\" \"Thought you wouldn\u0027t. When I looked in the glass didn\u0027t know myself. Thought I was another fellow. Thought I\u0027d try it on you first, to make sure, you know.\" \"Bob,\" I said, shaking hands heartily with him, \"you\u0027re splendid. Scotland Yard\u0027s a fool to you. I would trust you with my life.\" \"You might. It would be quite safe with me. So long as you kept your breath. Think I\u0027m a match for Peterssen?\" \"For a dozen Peterssens. You\u0027re a gem of the first water. I\u0027ve hardly got over it.\" \"Don\u0027t think any more of it. Plenty of time by and by. Always knew I was cut out for this sort of thing. Let\u0027s to business. You see what I\u0027ve done. What have you done?\" \"I have got the girl.\" \"Good. Sharp! Clever! Cool!\" \"You shall see her; she will be here soon.\" Then I related to him everything I knew of Sophy, and dwelt especially upon her behavior on the night of the disappearance of the body of M. Felix, which I could see made a powerful impression upon him. \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed. \"Got pluck, that girl. Seems just the article we want.\" His admiration increased when I told him of the expedient suggested by Sophy to keep her lack of education from the knowledge of Dr. Peterssen\u0027s people. \"She\u0027s a nugget,\" he said. \"Take quite an interest in her already. Possibilities in that girl. She will come through this affair with flying colors.\" \"That is my opinion, Bob. She will be a relation of yours, I suppose.\" \"Step-daughter,\" he said, with a wink. \"By my first wife. The girl in the way then. Much more in the way now. Why? Her mother\u0027s dead, and I\u0027m married again. Conundrum. What relation is she to my second wife? Work it out. Name, Maria. A perfect encumbrance. Dumb from her birth. And silly. Horrible nuisance. No vice in her. Not dangerous in the least. Therefore, friendly patient. No restraint or punishment. To be allowed to go about the house and grounds. Do as she likes. Must sleep in room by herself. Will give no trouble. Quarter paid in advance. Make her happy, and she shall remain for years. Must be kindly treated. Will programme do?\" \"It is excellently arranged.\" \"I go down as Mr. Nettlefold, The Elms, Ealing. Cousin of mine lives there. Should letters addressed Nettlefold arrive, will forward them on to me wherever I am. As I say, go down as Mr. Nettlefold. Leave Sheldon as such. Return to Sheldon as another man. To watch over Sophy, otherwise Maria. Got danger signals ready.\" He produced a number of small pellets, some blue, some white, weighted, and attached to thin cords. \"Sophy,\" he continued, \"otherwise Maria, ties these to underclothing. Stays. String of petticoat. Anything. Detaches one when required. I\u0027ll instruct her. Every day one thrown over wall. None thrown, go in and see her. Quite safe. Will she remain long?\" I answered that I thought she would be able to get hold of the desk in less than a week, and that under no circumstances should she remain longer than a fortnight. If she could not accomplish her task in that time it would be useless to keep her there. We continued talking about the arrangements till half-past one, when my faithful and punctual Sophy made her appearance. She looked the picture of neatness, and her eyes beamed when I expressed approval of her attire. Bob gazed upon her with satisfaction. \"She\u0027ll do,\" he said. \"You keep quiet. I\u0027ll take her in hand.\" I left it to him to explain matters and to teach her her lesson. He could have had no apter pupil; in less than half an hour she was proficient. \"We start, the three of us,\" said Bob, \"at three o\u0027clock. Not for Sheldon. Four miles from there is a large village, Nutford. We put up there. Arrive six-twenty. Have dinner. Dark night. Walk to Sheldon. Reconnoitre. Show you the wall, where you can get over. If you want to. Show you where to throw pellets. Four o\u0027clock every afternoon. Convenient time. Dr. Peterssen probably away. Feel all right?\" \"As right as a trivet,\" said Sophy. \"You\u0027re a girl--after my own heart. Have something to eat before we start. Tuck away.\" At three o\u0027clock we were in the train which was to convey us to our destination.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48922.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
