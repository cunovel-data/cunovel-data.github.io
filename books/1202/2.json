THE SPECTRE CAT.","content":"\"That\u0027s a rum start,\" said Constable Wigg. \"Was it Mr. Felix?\" \n \n \"No,\" replied Constable Nightingale, \"Mr. Felix is altogether a different kind of man. Takes things more coolly. Walks slow, talks slow, thinks slow, looks at you slow. This fellow was like a flash of lightning. Did you catch sight of his face?\" \n \n \"He was in such a devil of a hurry that there was no catching sight of anything except the red handkerchief round his neck. There was no mistaking that. Seemed a youngish man.\" \n \n \"Yes. Been on a visit to Mr. Felix, most likely.\" \n \n \"Or to some other lodger in the house,\" suggested Constable Wigg. \n \n \"There ain\u0027t no other,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"Every room in it except the basement is let to Mr. Felix.\" \n \n \"A married man, then\u0027 with a large family?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Constable Nightingale, with a little cough. \"Single. Or, perhaps, a widower. No business of ours, Wigg.\" \n \n \"Certainly not. Go on with your story, Nightingale. \u0027You\u0027re wanted up there\u0027 says Mrs. Middlemore.\" \n \n \"Yes. \u0027You\u0027re wanted up there,\u0027 she says, meaning Mr. Felix\u0027s rooms. \u0027Did Mr. Felix send for me?\u0027 I ask. \u0027He did,\u0027 she answers. \u0027He rings his bell and says, \"Go for a policeman.\" And he\u0027ll not be sorry it\u0027s you, Mr. Nightingale, because you\u0027re a man as can be trusted,\u0027 Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s precise words. You see, Wigg, me and her ain\u0027t exactly strangers. I\u0027m a single man, and I\u0027m mistook if she ain\u0027t got a bit of money put by.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re a knowing one, Nightingale,\u0027 said Constable Wigg, somewhat enviously, and it is not to the credit of human nature to state that there flashed into his mind the base idea of endeavoring to supplant his brother constable in Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s good graces. What should hinder him? He was a single man, many years younger than Constable Nightingale, and much better looking. All was fair in love and war. The \"bit of money put by\" was a temptation from Lucifer. \n \n \"That\u0027s what brings me round here now and then,\" continued Constable Nightingale, complacently. \"A man might go a good deal further than Mrs. Middlemore, and fare a good deal worse. \u0027I suppose,\u0027 says I to her, \u0027there\u0027s somebody with Mr. Felix as he wants to get rid of, and as won\u0027t go?\u0027 \u0027I ain\u0027t at liberty to say,\u0027 she answers, \u0027but you\u0027re pretty near the mark. Come and see for yourself, and don\u0027t forget that Mr. Felix has got a liberal heart, and hates fuss.\u0027 Upon that, Wigg, I holds my tongue, because I\u0027m a man as knows how to, and I follows Mrs. Middlemore into the house. I\u0027d been inside before, of course, but never upstairs, always down and Mrs. Middlemore had told me such a lot about Mr. Felix\u0027s rooms that I was curious to see them. \u0027Furnished like a palace,\u0027 Mrs. Middlemore used to say; so up the stairs I steps, Mrs. Middlemore showing the way, and I don\u0027t mind confessing that before we got to the first landing I put my arm round Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s waist--but that\u0027s neither here nor there. She stops on the landing, and knocks at the door----\" \n \n But here Constable Nightingale was compelled to pause, and to hold on tight to his comrade. The storm quite suddenly reached such a pitch of fury that the men could scarcely keep their feet, and it would have been impossible to hear a word that was spoken. It was not a fitful display of temper; so fierce grew the wind that it blew the street door open with a crash, and as the policemen were leaning against it, the consequence was that they were precipitated into the passage, and fell flat upon their backs. The reason of the door being blown open so readily was probably, as Constable Nightingale afterward remarked, because the man who had recently left the house so hastily had not pulled it tight behind him, but the tempest was raging so furiously that it might well have made light of such an obstacle as an old street door. It was with difficulty the policemen recovered their feet, and the strength of the wind as it rushed through the passage was so great that the idea that they would be safer inside the house than out occurred to both of them at once. To expose themselves to the fury of the elements in the open would undoubtedly have been attended with danger. Instinctively they advanced to the door, and after a struggle succeeded in shutting it. That being accomplished, they stood in the dark passage, mentally debating what they should do next. \n \n \"There\u0027s something moving,\" whispered Constable Wigg, trembling. He was not remarkable for courage, and had a horror of darkness. \n \n Constable Nightingale was made of sterner stuff. He promptly pulled out his dark lantern, and cast its circle of light upon the floor; and there, creeping timidly along close to the wall, they saw the miserable half-starved cat which had shaken Constable Wigg\u0027s nerves earlier in the night. It had taken advantage of the open street door to obtain the shelter for which it had long been seeking. \n \n \"It ain\u0027t the first time,\" said Constable Wigg, in a vicious tone, \"that this little beast has given me a turn. Just before you come up it run across me and almost sent my heart into my mouth.\" \n \n But for a mournful, fear-stricken look in its yellow eyes, the light of the dark lantern seemed to deprive the wretched cat of the power of motion. It remained perfectly still, cowering to the ground. Even when Constable Wigg gave it a spiteful kick it did not move of its own volition, and it was only when the attention of the policeman was no longer directed toward it that it slunk slowly and stealthily away. \n \n Meanwhile the tempest raged more furiously than ever outside. The shrieking wind tore through the streets, carrying devastation in its train, and the air was thick with whirling, blinding snow. \n \n \"Did you ever hear anything like it?\" said Constable Nightingale. \n \n \"Never,\" said Constable Wigg. \n \n \"It would be madness to go out,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"We should be dashed to pieces. Besides, what good could we do? Besides, who would be likely to want us? Besides, who\u0027s to know?\" \n \n * * * * * * \n \n There was a world of philosophy in these reflections, which Constable Wigg was only too ready to acknowledge. \n \n \"What do you propose, Nightingale?\" he asked. \n \n \"That we go down to Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s kitchen,\" replied Constable Nightingale, \"and make ourselves comfortable. I know the way.\" \n \n He led it, and Constable Wigg very cheerfully accompanied him. The kitchen was the coziest of apartments, and their hearts warmed within them as they entered it. Mrs. Middlemore, like a sensible woman, had taken the precaution to bank up the fire before she left the house, and it needed but one touch from the poker to cause it to spring into a bright glowing blaze. This touch was applied by Constable Nightingale, and the shadows upon walls and ceiling leapt into ruddy life. \n \n \"This is something like,\" said Constable Wigg, stooping and warming himself. \n \n Having no further need for his dark lantern, Constable Nightingale tucked it snugly away, and then proceeded to light a candle which, in its flat tin candlestick and a box of matches handy, stood on the kitchen table. They were not the only articles on the table. There was no table-cloth, it is true, but what mattered that? The whitest of table-cloths would have made but a sorry supper, and in the present instance could not have added to the attractions which the lighted candle revealed. There was bread, there was butter, there was cheese, there were pickles, there was a plate of sausages, there was half a roast fowl, and there was a fine piece of cold pork. Constable Wigg\u0027s eyes wandered to the table, and became, so to speak, glued there. He was now standing with his back to the fire, and was being comfortably warmed through. Even a kitchen may become a veritable Aladdin\u0027s cave, and this was the case with Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s kitchen, in the estimation of Constable Wigg. \n \n \"If there\u0027s one thing I like better than another for supper,\" he said, meditatively, and with pathos in his voice, \"it is cold pork and pickles. And there\u0027s enough for three, Nightingale, there\u0027s enough for three.\" \n \n Constable Nightingale nodded genially, and, with the air of a man familiar with his surroundings, took up a piece of butter on a knife, and put it to his mouth. \n \n \"The best fresh,\" he observed. \n \n \"You don\u0027t say so?\" exclaimed Constable Wigg, not contentiously, but in amiable wonder. \n \n \"Taste it,\" said Constable Nightingale, handing his comrade the knife with a new knob of butter on it. \n \n \"It is the best fresh,\" said Constable Wigg. \"She lives on the fat of the land.\" This evidence of good living and the cheerful homeliness of the kitchen strengthened his notion of supplanting Constable Nightingale in the affections of Mrs. Middlemore, but he was careful not to betray himself. \"You know your way about, Nightingale. It ain\u0027t the first time you\u0027ve been in this here snuggery.\" \n \n Constable Nightingale smiled knowingly, and said, \"Cold pork and pickles ain\u0027t half a bad supper, to say nothing of sausages, roast fowl, and----and----.\" He sniffed intelligently and inquired, \"Ain\u0027t there a baked tatery smell somewheres near?\" \n \n \"Now you mention it,\" replied Constable Wigg, also sniffing, \"I believe there is.\" \n \n \"And here they are, Wigg,\" said Constable Nightingale, opening the door of the oven, and exposing four large, flowery potatoes baking in their skins. \"Not yet quite done, not yet quite ready to burst, and all a-growing and a-blowing, and waiting for butter and pepper. They\u0027re relishy enough without butter and pepper, but with butter and pepper they\u0027re a feast for a emperor.\" \n \n \"Ah,\" sighed Constable Wigg, \"it\u0027s better to be born lucky than rich. Now just cast your eye at the door, Nightingale. I\u0027m blessed if that beastly cat ain\u0027t poking its nose in again.\" And as though there was within him a superabundance of vicious energy which required immediate working off, Constable Wigg threw his truncheon at the cat, which, without uttering a sound, fled from the kitchen. \"What riles me about that cat is that it moves about like a ghost, without as much as a whine. It takes you all of a sudden, like a stab in the back. It\u0027ll be up to some mischief before the night is out.\" \n \n \"Why, Wigg,\" said Constable Nightingale, with a laugh, \"you talk of it as if it wasn\u0027t a cat at all.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe it is. In my opinion it\u0027s a spectre cat, a spirit without a solid body. I lifted it with my foot in the street, and not a sound came from it. I kicked it in the passage, and it crept away like a ghost. I let fly my truncheon at it and hit it on the head, and off it went like a shadder, without a whine. It ain\u0027t natural. If it comes across me again I advise it to say its prayers.\" \n \n Which, to say the least of it, was an absurd recommendation to offer to a cat. But Constable Wigg was in an unreasonable and spiteful temper, and he became morose and melancholy when he saw how thoroughly Constable Nightingale was making himself at home in Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s kitchen; or perhaps it was the sight of the tempting food on the table which, without lawful invitation, he dared not touch. However it was, he was not allowed much time for gloomy reflection, his thoughts being diverted by the violent slamming of the street door, and by the further sound of a person breathing heavily in her course downstairs. \n \n \"It\u0027s Mrs. Middlemore,\" said Constable Nightingale, in a low tone. \"I never thought she\u0027d be able to open the door alone with such a wind blowing. We\u0027ll give her a surprise.\" \n \n They heard Mrs. Middlemore stop outside the kitchen, and exclaim, \"Well! To think I should \u0027ave been so foolish as to leave the candle alight! I could \u0027ave swore I blowed it out before I left the room!\" Then she opened the door, and it was well that Constable Nightingale darted forward to her support, for if he had not she would have fallen to the ground in affright, and the supper beer would have been lost to taste, if not to sight. It was as well, too, that he put his face close enough to her lips to partially stifle a kind of a hysterical gurgle which was escaping therefrom. It was, however, a proceeding of which Constable Wigg did not inwardly approve. \n \n \"Pluck up, Mrs. Middlemore,\" said Constable Nightingale, cheerily, \"there\u0027s nothing wrong. It\u0027s only me and my mate, Wigg, who\u0027s on night duty here. Everything\u0027s as right as a fiddle. Take a pull at the beer--a long pull. Now you feel better, don\u0027t you?\" \n \n Mrs. Middlemore--her movements being enviously watched by Constable Wigg, whose thirst was growing almost unbearable--removed her lips from the jug, and said: \n \n \"Ever so much. But how did you get in?\" \n \n \"Didn\u0027t get in at all,\" said Constable Nightingale, jocosely; \"we were blown in.\" \n \n \"Blown in!\" \n \n \"Yes, my dear. We was standing outside, Wigg and me, leaning against the door, when the wind come like a clap of thunder, and blew it clean open, and of course we went with it, flat on our backs the pair of us. When we got on our feet again the wind was tearing so, and the snow was pelting down that fierce, that I thought we might venture to take a liberty, and we come down here to warm ourselves. And that\u0027s the long and the short of it, my dear.\" \n \n He still had his arm round Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s waist, and now he gave her a hug. She was a pleasant-faced, round-bodied woman, some forty years of age, and she looked up smilingly as the constable--her favorite constable--hugged her, and said, \n \n \"Well, now, I declare you did startle me. When I opened the door, and sor two men a-standing in my kitchen, I thought of burglars, and you might \u0027ave knocked me down with a feather. \n \n \"And now we\u0027re here,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d have the heart to turn us out.\" \n \n \"Turn you out!\" exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore, \"I wouldn\u0027t turn a cat out on such a night as this!\" \n \n \"More cats,\" thought Constable Wigg, with his eyes on the cold pork and pickles. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48877.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
