They are at the top of the house, on the third floor, and a capacious bow-window in his sitting-room affords a good view of the river and the Embankment gardens. He describes his chambers as an ideal residence, and declares he would not exchange it for a palace. In daytime the view from his bow-window is varied and animated, in night-time the lights and shadows on the Thames are replete with suggestion. From this window he has drawn the inspiration for many admirable articles which have appeared in our columns, in which his play of fancy illumines his depiction of a busy city\u0027s life. \n \n \"He let himself in with his latch-key, and Sophy followed close on his heels up the silent stairs. On the third floor another latch-key admitted them to the privacy of his chambers. \n \n \"\u0027It will be dark for a moment, Sophy,\u0027 he said; \u0027you are not frightened, I hope?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not a bit,\u0027 replied Sophy. \n \n \"It may not be unworthy of remark that she never again addressed him as \u0027old \u0027un, which he ascribed to the little incident of the purchase of the pair of boots. It had raised him to an altitude which rendered so familiar an appellation out of place. \n \n \"In less than a minute he had lit the gas in his sitting-room, and Sophy stood gazing around in wonder and delight. Our reporter is a gentleman of taste, no mere grub working from hand to mouth. He entered the ranks of journalism from choice, and possesses a private income which renders him independent of it; thus he is enabled to surround himself with luxuries which are out of the reach of the ordinary rank and file of his brother workers, who one and all have a good word for him because of the kindnesses they have on numerous occasions received at his hands. \n \n \"Sophy looked round on the books and pictures and valuable objects with which the room was literally packed, and her appreciation--little as she understood them--was expressed in her eyes. \n \n \"\u0027This is my den, Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027What do you think of it?\u0027 \n \n \"As he spoke he applied a lighted match to a couple of bachelor\u0027s wheels in the stove, and in an instant a cheerful fire was glowing. \n \n \"\u0027Well, I never!\u0027 exclaimed Sophy. \u0027It\u0027s magic.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, Sophy, sober fact. Single life nowadays is filled with innumerable conveniences to keep a fellow from the path of matrimony. This little bachelor\u0027s wheel\u0027--holding one up--\u0027is a formidable foe to anxious mammas with marriageable daughters. But I am talking above you, Sophy; pardon the flight. Go to the window there; you will see the river from it.\u0027 \n \n \"He stood by her side while she gazed upon the wonderful sight, too little appreciated by those who are familiar with it. The moon was shining brightly, and the heavens were dotted with stars; long lines of lights were shining in the water, animated as it were with a mysterious spiritual life by the shifting currents of the river. It was at this moment that Sophy gave expression to a remarkable effort at grammar. \n \n \"\u0027I say, \u0027ow \u0027igh the Thames are!\u0027 \n \n \"Our reporter was amused, and did not correct her. \u0027Yes, Sophy, the river has reached an unusual height. And now, little one, as time is flying, let us proceed to business.\u0027 \n \n \"Sophy, brought down to earth, retired from the window, and stood by the table, at which our reporter seated himself. He could not prevail upon her to take a chair. \n \n \"\u0027I can talk better standing,\u0027 she said. \u0027Before I tell what I got to tell, I\u0027d like to know wot aunt said of me when you and \u0027er was up in Mr. Felix\u0027s rooms this morning. You know. When I\u0027d jest got out of bed.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nothing very particular, Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027except that you were a sound sleeper.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You arksed \u0027er that?\u0027 said Sophy, shrewdly. \n \n \"\u0027Yes, You see, Sophy, I was naturally anxious to learn all I could of the strange disappearance of M. Felix\u0027s body. It was there last night when you and your aunt went to bed; it was not there this morning when you got up.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Aunt couldn\u0027t tell yer much.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027She could tell me nothing. She went to bed, and though she has passed bad nights this week----\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Oh, she sed that, did she?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Meaning that she don\u0027t sleep much?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, that undoubtedly was her meaning.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well, go on, please,\u0027 said Sophy. \n \n \"\u0027Though she has passed bad nights lately, it was a fact that last night she slept very soundly. Then the idea occurred to me to come down and ask you whether you had heard anything in the night--because, you know, Sophy, that M. Felix\u0027s body could not have disappeared from the house without some sound being made. We do not live in an age of miracles. The body could not have flown up the chimney, or made its way through thick walls. There is only one way it could have been got out, and that was through the street door.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Right you are,\u0027 said Sophy. \n \n \"\u0027Now, Sophy, I am sure you are a sensible little girl, and that I can open my mind freely to you.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You can that. I ain\u0027t much to look at, but I ain\u0027t quite a fool neither.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I am certain you are not. I cannot tell you how deeply I am interested in this mysterious affair, and how much I desire to get at the bottom of it. Whoever assists me to do this will not repent it, and somehow or other I have an idea that you can help me. If you can, I will be a real good friend to you.\u0027 \n \n \"You\u0027ve been that already, the best I ever sor. I took you in once this morning, and I ain\u0027t going to do it agin.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027How did you take me in, Sophy?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I told yer I didn\u0027t wake up last night, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You did, Sophy.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027And that I didn\u0027t \u0027ear no noise?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They was crammers. I did wake up in the middle of the night, and I did \u0027ear a noise.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter, repressing his excitement as well as he could, \u0027I feel that you are going to do me a good turn.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Aunt\u0027s a awful liar,\u0027 said Sophy. \n \n \"\u0027Is she?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027She ses she sleeps light, and I sleep sound. It\u0027s all the other way. She goes to bed and drops off like the snuff of a candle, and she snores like a pig. I sleep on and off like. I don\u0027t let aunt know it, \u0027cause I don\u0027t want to be rushed out of bed till I\u0027ve a mind to git up, so I pretend to be fast asleep, and I let her shake me as much as she likes. I do not lay snuggled up; and I was laying like that last night all the while aunt was snoring fit to shake the \u0027ouse down, when I \u0027eerd wot sounded like somethink movin\u0027 upstairs. I wasn\u0027t scared--yer don\u0027t know Sophy if yer think that. \"I\u0027ll see what it is,\" thinks I, \"if I die for it.\" So I creeps out of bed, and stands quiet a bit in the dark, without moving.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You are a brave little girl, Sophy, and I am proud of you.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I stands listening and wondering, and the sound of somethink moving upstairs goes on. Moving quite soft, sir, jest as if it didn\u0027t want to be \u0027eerd. \"Blowed if I don\u0027t go up,\" thinks I, \"and find out wot it\u0027s all about.\" I wouldn\u0027t light a candle, \u0027cause that might wake aunt, and I wanted to \u0027ave it all to myself. Well, sir, I creeps to the door in my bare feet and opens it, and goes into the passage. Sure enough, I ain\u0027t deceived; there is somethink on the stairs. Up I creeps, as soft as a cat, feeling my way by the bannisters, till I git to the passage that leads to the street-door. Then somethink \u0027appens to me that upsets the applecart. I ketches my toe agin a nail, and I screams out. But that\u0027s nothink to what follers. A \u0027and claps itself on my mouth, and somebody ses, \"If yer move or speak out loud I\u0027ll kill yer!\" If I sed I wasn\u0027t frightened at that I\u0027d be telling yer the biggest crammer of the lot, but I pulls myself together, and I whispers under my breath, \"Wot is it? Burgulers?\" \"Yes,\" ses the voice, \"burgulers, as\u0027ll \u0027ave yer blood if yer don\u0027t do as yer told.\" \"I\u0027ll do everythink yer want,\" I ses, \"if yer don\u0027t \u0027urt me. My blood won\u0027t do yer a bit o\u0027 good; it ain\u0027t much good to me as I knows on. Is there more than one of yer?\" \"There\u0027s a band of us,\" ses the voice. \"Who\u0027s downstairs?\" \"Only aunt,\" I ses. \"Ain\u0027t there nobody else in the \u0027ouse?\" arsks the voice. \"Not a blessed soul,\" ses I, \"excep\u0027 the corpse on the fust floor.\" \"Take yer oath on it,\" ses the voice. \"I \u0027ope I may never move from this spot alive,\" ses I, \"if it ain\u0027t the truth I\u0027m telling of yer!\" \n \n \"Now jest listen to me,\" ses the voice. \"You do as yer told, or you\u0027ll be chopped into ten thousan\u0027 little bits. Set down on the stairs there, and shut yer eyes, and don\u0027t move or speak till you \u0027ear a whistle; it won\u0027t be a loud \u0027un, but loud enough for you to \u0027ear. Then you git up, and shut the street-door softly--you\u0027ll find it open--and lock it and put up the chain. Then go downstairs without speaking a word, and if yer aunt\u0027s awake and arsks yer wot\u0027s the matter, say nothink; if she\u0027s asleep, don\u0027t wake her. When she gits up in the morning don\u0027t say nothink to \u0027er, and don\u0027t answer no questions about us. You understand all that?\" \"Every word on it,\" I ses. \"And yer\u0027ll do as yer ordered?\" ses the voice. \"Yes, I will,\" I ses. \"Mind yer do,\" ses the voice, \"or somethink orful \u0027ll \u0027appen to yer. You\u0027ll be watched the \u0027ole day long, and if yer let on, look out for yerself. Now set yerself down on the stairs.\" I did, sir, and though I was froze almost to a stone, I never moved or spoke. It was that dark that I couldn\u0027t see a inch before my nose, even when I opened my eyes slyly, but I couldn\u0027t \u0027elp \u0027earing wot was going on. There was a creeping, and a bumping, and the sound of the street-door being unlocked and the chain being took down. Then everythink was quiet agin inside, and all I \u0027eerd was a policeman in the street outside, trying the doors as he passed on. When he\u0027d got well out of the street, as near as I could tell, the street-door was opened without as much as a creak, and in another minute I \u0027eerd a low whistle. Then I got up; it was all a job, sir, \u0027cause I was cramped, but I managed it, and I crep\u0027 to the street-door, and shut it, and locked it, and put the chain up. I was glad enough to do it, I can tell yer, and I felt my way downstairs and got into bed. Aunt \u0027adn\u0027t as much as moved, and nobody knew nothink but me and the burgulers. That\u0027s all I know about last night.\u0027 \n \n \"It was enough, in all conscience; a strange story indeed, and related by such a common little waif as Sophy. Our reporter had not interrupted her once, but allowed her to proceed, in her own quaint and original way, to the end. \n \n \"\u0027And you have told nobody but me, Sophy?\u0027 asked our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027It ain\u0027t crossed my lips till this minute,\u0027 replied Sophy. \u0027I don\u0027t know wot I might \u0027ave done if I \u0027adn\u0027t seed you this morning. You spoke civil and nice to me, and I took to yer in a minute. Yer might \u0027ave knocked me down with a feather when I \u0027eered arter you\u0027d gone wot the burgulers\u0027 little game was, and it come to me in a jiffy that you\u0027d like to know wot \u0027ad become of Mr. Felix\u0027s body. \"I\u0027ll wait till I see \u0027im agin,\" ses I to myself, \"and then I\u0027ll tell \u0027im all about it.\" If you \u0027adn\u0027t come to aunt\u0027s to-night I should \u0027ave come to you.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I am infinitely obliged to you,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027We\u0027ll keep the matter to ourselves at present, and if there\u0027s any reward offered for the recovery of the body, or for any information that may lead to its recovery, it shall be yours, Sophy, every farthing of it.\u0027 \n \n \"Sophy\u0027s eyes glistened as she said, \u0027If they arsks me, then, why I adn\u0027t spoke before, I\u0027ll tell \u0027em I was too frightened by wot the burguler sed he\u0027d do to me if I sed anythink about it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That excuse will do nicely. Did you hear the sound of many feet?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I think it was only one man as was moving about,\u0027 replied Sophy, after a little consideration. \n \n \"\u0027How do we account, then, for there being more than one man concerned in this singular robbery?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Per\u0027aps there wasn\u0027t more than one,\u0027 suggested Sophy quickly, \u0027and in course he \u0027ad to carry the body. It couldn\u0027t walk of itself, being dead.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Quite so, my young logician--a compliment Sophy. Before you put up the chain, did you look out into the street?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I didn\u0027t dare to.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Then you don\u0027t know if there was a cab or a cart waiting at the door?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I don\u0027t, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you hear the sound of wheels moving away after the door was secured?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, I didn\u0027t. Everythink was as still as still can be, inside and out.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027There must have been a vehicle of some sort, however, stationed near. A man couldn\u0027t carry a dead body through the streets very far without being caught. Perhaps he would not allow it to stand too near your aunt\u0027s house for fear of suspicion being excited. The natural conclusion is that a growler was engaged, and that it walked slowly to and fro in a given direction till he came up to it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That must \u0027ave been it, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If I give you five shillings, Sophy, can you take care of it?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Rather! But you\u0027ve done enough for me to-night, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not half enough, my girl. Here\u0027s the money.\u0027 \n \n \"From the expression on Sophy\u0027s face she would have liked to resist the temptation, but it was too strong for her, so she took the two half-crowns, saying gleefully as she tied them in her money-box, I shall soon \u0027ave enough to buy wot I want.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What is it you desire so particularly, Sophy? A new frock?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I want a pair of tights.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027In heaven\u0027s name, what for?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027To see \u0027ow I look in \u0027em.\u0027 Sophy glanced down at her legs, then stood straight up and walked a few steps this way and a few steps that, in glowing anticipation of the delights in store for her. \n \n \"\u0027You would like to be an actress, Sophy?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Wouldn\u0027t I? Jest! I can do a lot of steps, sir. Would you like to see me dance?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not to-night, Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter, thinking of the proprieties; \u0027I haven\u0027t time, and you had best get back as quick as you can to your aunt. I\u0027ll see you part of the way. I don\u0027t know what excuse you will give her for being absent so long.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Let me alone for that. It ain\u0027t the fust time, and won\u0027t be the last.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well, come along, my girl.\u0027 \n \n \"They left the house without being observed, and our reporter saw Sophy as far as St. Martin\u0027s Lane, and then bade her good night. Before returning to his chambers he walked in the direction of the Embankment with the intention of taking a stroll there. It was a favorite promenade of his on fine nights, and on this night in particular he desired it, in order that he might think in the quietude of that grand avenue of the information he had gained. Elated as he was at the progress he was making in the elucidation of the mystery, he could not but be conscious that every new discovery he had made seemed to add to its difficulty. What he wanted now was a tangible clew, however slight, which he could follow up in a practical way. Little did he dream that everything was working in his favor, and that time and circumstance were leading him to the clew he was so anxious to possess. \n \n \"There was one thing in the story related to him by Sophy which greatly perplexed him. The child could not have assisted him to a satisfactory solution, for he was satisfied that she had disclosed all she knew of the events of the night, and he therefore had made no mention to her of the perplexing point. It was this. Sophy had told him that while she was sitting on the stairs with her eyes closed she heard the man unlock the street door and take the chain down. That being so, the question remained--how had he got into the house? Scarcely through the street door, for it was hardly likely that, having got in through it, he would have locked it and put the chain up, and thus created for himself a serious obstacle to his escape in the event of his being discovered before he had accomplished his work. Our reporter could think of no satisfactory answer to this question, and it had to take its place among other questions to which, in the present aspect of the case, no answers could be found. \n \n \"He had turned on to the Embankment by way of Westminster Bridge, and passing under the arch of the Charing Cross Railway bridge, was proceeding onward toward Waterloo when he saw something that caused him to quicken his steps in its direction. Fate or chance was about to place in his hands the link for which he was yearning--a link but for which the mystery of M. Felix might forever have remained unravelled.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48889.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
