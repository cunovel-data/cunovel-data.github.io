{"id":43683,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. THE REPORTER OF THE \"EVENING MOON\" MAKES A DISCOVERY.","content":"\"On the evening of the 19th our reporter paid a visit to Mrs. Middlemore. Sophy opened the street door for him. \"\u0027Hallo, old \u0027un,\u0027 said the girl, \u0027it\u0027s you, is it?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027here I am again.\u0027 \"\u0027As large as life,\u0027 remarked Sophy, vivaciously, \u0027and twice as--no, I won\u0027t say that; you ain\u0027t arf a bad sort. What\u0027s yer little game this time, old \u0027un?\u0027 \"\u0027Is Mrs. Middlemore in?\u0027 asked our reporter. \"\u0027Yes, aunt\u0027s at \u0027ome. Do you want to see \u0027er?\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027ve come for, Sophy.\u0027 \"\u0027Who\u0027s that, Sophy?\u0027 cried Mrs. Middlemore, from the bottom of the basement stairs. \"\u0027It\u0027s the old \u0027un, aunt,\u0027 screamed Sophy. \"\u0027Don\u0027t be absurd,\u0027 said our reporter, pinching Sophy\u0027s cheek. \u0027It is I, Mrs. Middlemore, the reporter from the Evening Moon.\u0027 \"\u0027Come down, sir,\u0027 cried Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027if come you must. Don\u0027t stop talking to that \u0027uzzy.\u0027 \"Sophy put her tongue in her cheek, and whispering, \u0027Ain\u0027t she a treat?\u0027 preceded our reporter to the kitchen. \"\u0027Good-evening, Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 said our reporter. \"\u0027Good-evening, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027Sophy, \u0027ave you shut the street door tight?\u0027 \"\u0027As tight as a drum,\u0027 replied Sophy. \"\u0027Mrs. Middlemore sank into a chair with a heavy sigh, and our reporter took a seat opposite her. There was a jug of beer on the table. \"\u0027Will you \u0027ave a glass, sir?\u0027 asked Mrs. Middlemore, hospitably. \"\u0027No, thank you; I have just dined, and I thought I would come and have a chat with you in a general way.\u0027 \"\u0027Thank \u0027eaven it\u0027s about nothing particular,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, in a tone of manifest relief. \"\u0027It may lead to something particular,\u0027 observed our reporter, genially. \u0027We\u0027re only on the threshold as yet.\u0027 \"\u0027Stop a bit, sir, please. Sophy!\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, aunty dear,\u0027 responded the girl, in a tone of simulated sweetness. \"\u0027If I let you go out for a walk, will you come back in arf an hour?\u0027 \"Sophy hesitated. Between her longing for a run in the streets and her longing to hear what our reporter had to say, she felt herself in a difficulty. \"\u0027Well, now,\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore, sharply. \"\u0027Oh, aunty dear,\u0027 said Sophy, pressing the bosom of her frock, and pretending to be greatly startled at her aunt\u0027s sharp voice, you send my \u0027eart into my mouth.\u0027 \"\u0027Will you promise not to stop out longer than an hour?\u0027 \"Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s anxiety to get rid of her decided the girl. For once she would forego the temptations of the streets. \"\u0027Don\u0027t want to go out,\u0027 she said, shortly. \"\u0027But you\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, resenting this opposition to her authority, \u0027or I\u0027ll bundle you out for good, neck and crop. Promise, like a good girl.\u0027 \"\u0027Shan\u0027t promise,\u0027 said Sophy, rebelliously. \"\u0027Oh, dear, oh, dear,\u0027 moaned Mrs. Middlemore. \u0027What am I to do with her? And after all the nice things you said of her this morning, sir?\u0027 \"\u0027Did you say nice things of me?\u0027 asked Sophy, of our reporter. \"\u0027I did, Sophy,\u0027 he replied, \u0027and I\u0027m sure you will do as your aunt tells you.\u0027 \"\u0027That settles it. I\u0027ll go. \u0027Ow long for, aunty?\u0027 \"\u0027An hour. Not a minute more.\u0027 \"\u0027I say\u0027--to our reporter--\u0027you might lend us yer watch. Then I shouldn\u0027t make any mistake.\u0027 \"\u0027Get along with you,\u0027 said our reporter, laughing. \u0027The shops are full of clocks.\u0027 \"\u0027Thank yer for nothing,\u0027 said Sophy, proceeding to array herself. Spitting on the palm of her hand, she made a pretence of smoothing her hair. Then she looked at herself in a piece of looking-glass that was hanging on the wall, and turned her head this way and that, smirking most comically. Then she shook out her skirts, and looked over her shoulder to see that they hung becomingly. Then she tied a piece of string round one yawning boot. Then she put on her head something in straw that once might have been called a hat, but which had long since forfeited all claims to respectability. Then she fished out a poor little scarf, about six inches square, and pinned it round her shoulders with a coquettishness not devoid of grace. Her toilette completed, she asked-- \"\u0027Will I do?\u0027 \"\u0027Very nicely, Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter. But although he spoke gayly he was stirred by a certain pity for this little waif, who was so conspicuously animated by a spirit to make the best of things--a spirit which might with advantage be emulated by her betters--and who made a joke even of her poverty and rags. \"\u0027Much obliged,\u0027 said Sophy. \u0027Give us a kiss, aunty. Now I\u0027m off.\u0027 \"And off she was, but not without saluting our reporter with an elaborate courtesy. \"Mrs. Middlemore waited till she heard the street-door slam, and then said, \"\u0027Did you ever see the likes of her?\u0027 \"\u0027I declare to you, my dear madam,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027that the more I see of Sophy the more I like her. What have the police done? Anything?\u0027 \"\u0027Nothing, sir. I went and told \u0027em what \u0027ad \u0027appened, and two policemen came and looked at the bed, looked under it, looked in every room as you said they would, looked at me, and went away.\u0027 \"\u0027And they have not been here again?\u0027 \"\u0027No, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Mrs. Middlemore, may I have another peep in M. Felix\u0027s rooms?\u0027 \"\u0027Certainly, sir.\u0027 \"They went up together, Mrs. Middlemore breathing heavily, perfuming the air with a flavor of beer. There was an escritoire in the sitting-room, and our reporter examined it. \"\u0027I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m looking for,\u0027 he said. \u0027I see pens, ink, and paper, denoting that M. Felix was occasionally in the habit of using them, but there is not a scrap of paper about with his writing on it. There is not even a monogram on the note paper. If we could find something, it might furnish a clue. He received letters, I suppose?\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, yes, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027And the presumption is that he answered them. Did you ever post any of his letters?\u0027 \"\u0027Never once, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Here is a waste-paper basket; there must have been in it, at odd times, scraps of the letters he received and spoilt sheets of his own. Has your dust bin been emptied this week?\u0027 \"\u0027No, sir, but you wouldn\u0027t find anything of Mr. Felix\u0027s in it. It was one of his orders that whatever was in the waste-paper basket should be burnt here in his own fireplace. I used to sweep this room in the morning when he was in bed, and he always said I did my work so quietly that he was never disturbed by any noise.\u0027 \"\u0027Look round the room, Mrs. Middlemore, and see if you miss anything. You would be pretty well acquainted with everything in it. What is the meaning of that gasp? You do miss something?\u0027 \"\u0027There was another desk, sir, and I don\u0027t see it.\u0027 \"\u0027What kind of desk?\u0027 \"\u0027A small one, sir, that used to smell quite nice.\u0027 \"\u0027Ah, made of cedar wood, no doubt. Did M. Felix keep his papers in this desk?\u0027 \"\u0027Some of his papers, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027How do you know that?\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027ve come into the room when he\u0027s rung for me, and saw the desk open.\u0027 \"\u0027Ocular proof, Mrs. Middlemore.\u0027 \"\u0027What sort\u0027s that, sir?\u0027 \"\u0027Visible to the eye--your eye, my dear madam.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, dubiously. \"\u0027Now, Mrs. Middlemore, can you inform me whether those papers you saw in the missing desk were private papers?\u0027 \"\u0027It ain\u0027t possible for me to say, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Neither can you say, I suppose, whether M. Felix set any particular store upon them?\u0027 \"\u0027Well, sir, now you bring me to it, things come to my mind.\u0027 \"\u0027Exactly.\u0027 \"\u0027Whenever I come into the room,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027and the desk was open, Mr. Felix used to shut it up quick.\u0027 \"\u0027Lest you should see them too closely?\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m sure I shouldn\u0027t \u0027ave made no use of \u0027em; least of all, bad use.\u0027 \"\u0027That is not the point. He closed the desk quickly when another person was by, with an evident wish to keep all possible knowledge of them to himself.\u0027 \"\u0027It looks like that. You do push a thing close.\u0027 \"Our reporter accepted this as a compliment, and continued: \"\u0027That appears to establish the fact that this desk--which probably was brought from India, Mrs. Middlemore--contained M. Felix\u0027s private papers?\u0027 \"\u0027It do, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, admiringly. \"\u0027And, therefore, papers of importance. The desk was inlaid with silver, Mrs. Middlemore.\u0027 \"\u0027Lor\u0027, sir!\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Middlemore, doubtless regarding our reporter as a man who dealt in enchantments. \u0027How did you find out that?\u0027 \"\u0027It was, was it not?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir, it was.\u0027 \"\u0027When M. Felix had visitors, was this desk ever allowed to lie carelessly about?\u0027 \"\u0027No, sir. At them times he used to keep it in \u0027is bedroom, on a little table by the side of \u0027is bed.\u0027 \"\u0027Let us look through the bedroom, and see if it is there.\u0027 \"They searched the bedroom thoroughly, without finding it. \"\u0027It is undoubtedly gone,\u0027 said our reporter. \"\u0027It do look like it, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Mrs. Middlemore, when M. Felix was found dead in his chair, was this desk in either of the rooms?\u0027 \"\u0027I didn\u0027t see it, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027You could not swear it was not here?\u0027 \"\u0027I shouldn\u0027t like to, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027The probability, however, is that it had gone when the door was forced open?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027The police could scarcely take it away without your knowledge?\u0027 \"\u0027They\u0027d \u0027ave been clever to do it.\u0027 \"\u0027Had they done so, they would certainly have been exceeding their duties. Now, do not answer the questions I put to you too quickly. Were you in these rooms on the day before M. Felix\u0027s death?\u0027 \"\u0027I were, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Was the desk here then?\u0027 \"\u0027It were; I can swear to that.\u0027 \"\u0027You saw it with your own eyes?\u0027 \"\u0027I couldn\u0027t see it with no others,\u0027 replied Mrs. Middlemore, smirking, in approval of her small wit. \"\u0027Of course, you could not. Is there any particular reason why you are so positive of this?\u0027 \"\u0027Well, sir, Mr. Felix wanted something, and rung for me; and when I come into the room he was sitting at this table with the desk open before him, and all the papers scattered about.\u0027 \"\u0027That fixes it. Did he seem to be searching for, or examining with more than usual interest, any special document?\u0027 \"\u0027He seemed flustered and excited, sir. I can\u0027t say no more than that.\u0027 \"\u0027He was not generally of an excitable temperament?\u0027 \"\u0027Not at all. He was easy going, and always with a pleasant word.\u0027 \"\u0027A model man. I observe that you call him Mr. and not Monsieur?\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t bring myself to foreign languages, sir. My tongue gits into a knot.\u0027 \"\u0027He was a foreigner, I suppose?\u0027 \"\u0027I suppose so, sir. I ain\u0027t the best of judges.\u0027 \"\u0027A Frenchman?\u0027 \"\u0027So I thought, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Or an Italian?\u0027 \"\u0027Perhaps, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, wavering. \"\u0027Or a Spaniard?\u0027 \"\u0027Perhaps, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, growing more undecided. \"\u0027Or a Russian?\u0027 \"\u0027How can I say, sir?\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, now quite at sea as to M. Felix\u0027s nationality. \"\u0027He spoke the English language well?\u0027 \"\u0027As well as me, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027So that, after all, he might have been an Englishman?\u0027 \"\u0027He might,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, declining to commit herself, \u0027and he mightn\u0027t.\u0027 \"Our reporter did not press the point, as to which Mrs. Middlemore had evidently disclosed all she knew. \"\u0027If we could find the missing desk, Mrs. Middlemore, it might throw a light upon the mystery.\u0027 \"Again did Mrs. Middlemore decline to commit herself; again did she answer, \u0027It might, and it mightn\u0027t, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027I presume there was nothing in the desk that attracted your attention besides the papers?\u0027 \"\u0027Only one thing, sir--a curious sort of knife.\u0027 \"\u0027A paper knife, most likely.\u0027 \"\u0027It was more like a dagger,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore. \u0027It \u0027ad a \u0027andle like a twisted snake, with a\u0027 open mouth and a colored stone in its eye. It \u0027ad a sharp pint, too?\u0027 \"\u0027How did you become aware of that? Did you ever try it?\u0027 \"\u0027Not me, sir; but once I come in when Mr. Felix \u0027ad it in \u0027is \u0027and, playing with it, and all at once he dropped it like a \u0027ot pertater. He pricked \u0027isself with it, and there was blood on \u0027is \u0027and.\u0027 \"\u0027You have furnished me with a valuable piece of evidence, Mrs. Middlemore. Papers are easily burnt, and a desk broken up and destroyed. It would not be so easy to get rid of that knife, which, from your description, must be a foreign dagger, and the identification of which would be a simple matter. For instance, you could swear to it, and so could I, who have never seen it.\u0027 \"\u0027Anybody could swear to it, sir; it couldn\u0027t be mistook.\u0027 \"\u0027Did M. Felix keep this dagger always in his desk?\u0027 \"\u0027I should say he did, sir. I never saw it laying about loose, and never saw it at all unless the desk was open.\u0027 \"\u0027Did you see it on the last occasion you saw the desk open, a few hours before M. Felix\u0027s death?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir, it was among \u0027is papers.\u0027 \"\u0027Have you any suspicion, Mrs. Middlemore, who at this present moment has possession of the desk and the dagger?\u0027 \"\u0027Not the least, sir. \u0027Ave you?\u0027 \"\u0027I have. A suspicion amounting to a certainty. Have you forgotten the man with a red handkerchief round his neck who escaped from the house on the night of the eventful discovery?\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m not likely to forget \u0027im,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, and then added, in an excited tone, \u0027do you think it was \u0027im as took it?\u0027 \"\u0027Him, and no other. Now we arrive at the motive of his visit; it was robbery. Not a vulgar robbery such as an ordinary thief would have committed, but one of a particular nature, and committed with a knowledge that M. Felix\u0027s Indian desk contained a secret or secrets of value, which no doubt he could turn to good account. We are getting on, Mrs. Middlemore, we are getting on,\u0027 said our reporter, rubbing his hands in satisfaction. \u0027In these affairs there is nothing like patience.\u0027 \"\u0027You\u0027re as good as a detective, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027and you\u0027ve got the patience of Job. You won\u0027t mind my saying that I\u0027ve thought lots of your questions foolish, and only put for the sake of saying something. I don\u0027t think so now, sir.\u0027 \"\u0027Thank you for the compliment. I assure you I have not asked you one idle question. Recall to mind whether the man with the red handkerchief round his neck carried anything away with him that looked like a desk as he escaped from the house.\u0027 \"\u0027I don\u0027t believe, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, with evident reluctance, \u0027as that will ever be known.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, yes, it will. Answer my question.\u0027 \"\u0027I didn\u0027t notice nothing,\u0027 replied Mrs. Middlemore. \"We pause a moment here to observe that it was these reserved replies, when any question relating to this man was asked, as well as the conflicting testimony of the constables Wigg and Nightingale, that led us to the conclusion, already recorded, that the precise truth was not revealed as to which one of the three witnesses actually saw the man. Having committed themselves to a certain statement for the purpose of exonerating the constables from official blame, they could not afterward contradict themselves, because such a contradiction would have thrown grave doubt upon the whole of their evidence. \"\u0027He could not,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027very well have carried away an article of this description without its being noticed by any one who saw him.\u0027 \"\u0027Ain\u0027t it excusable, sir,\u0027 observed Mrs. Middlemore, nervously, \u0027when you think of the storm and the confusion we was in?\u0027 \"\u0027Well, perhaps, but it is a pity we cannot obtain definite information on the point. Isn\u0027t that a knock at the street door?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, making no attempt to move from the room. \"\u0027You had better go down and see who it is. I will remain here. There is really nothing to be frightened at. It might be Sophy come back.\u0027 \"At this suggestion Mrs. Middlemore left the room, and went to the street door. Being alone, our reporter looked about him, and almost immediately made an important discovery. Against the wall, on the right hand side of the door as he entered, stood a massive sideboard, a very handsome piece of furniture. The lower part of this sideboard was close against the waistcoat, above which there was a space between the back of the sideboard and the wall of about an inch in width. Happening to glance at the back of the sideboard, the light of the candle which our reporter held in his hand fell upon something bright. Stooping, he drew the object out, and was excited to find it was the identical dagger about which he and Mrs. Middlemore had been conversing. There could not be the possibility of a mistake. Its handle, as Mrs. Middlemore had described, resembled a twisted snake; the mouth was open, and in its head was a ruby to represent an eye. A dangerous instrument, with a very sharp point, the metal of which it was composed being bright steel. But it was not the peculiar shape of the handle, nor the bright steel of the blade, nor the ruby eye, which excited our reporter. It was the fact that there was rust upon the blade, and that this rust was caused by blood, of which there were light stains plainly visible on the handle of the dagger.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48887.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
