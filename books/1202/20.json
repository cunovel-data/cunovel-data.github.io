He took her by the arm, and led her unceremoniously away. Stopping on the opposite side of the road, he said to her: \n \n \"\u0027Now, Mrs. Middlemore, what brought you here?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I was sent for, sir,\u0027 she answered. \n \n \"\u0027By whom?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027By the magerstate.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Where is the paper?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What paper, sir?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027The summons.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I ain\u0027t got none. The perlice orficer comes to me and ses, \"Mrs. Middlemore,\" he ses, \"you must go immediate to the Bow Street Perlice Station, and wait outside till yer called.\" \"But what about?\" I arks. \"About Mr. Felix,\" he answers; \"somethink\u0027s been found out, and they can\u0027t git on without yer. Yer\u0027ll have to wait a longish time per\u0027aps, but if yer move away till yer called it\u0027ll be worse for yer.\" \"But what am I to do about the \u0027ouse?\" I arks. \"Sophy\u0027s out, and there\u0027s no one to mind it.\" \"I\u0027ll mind it,\" ses the perlice orficer, \"and when Sophy comes back I\u0027ll let her in. Off yer go, and don\u0027t tell nobody at Bow Street what yer\u0027ve come about. It\u0027s a secret, and the Government won\u0027t stand it being talked of. Yer\u0027ll be paid for yer trouble.\" So off I starts, and \u0027ere \u0027ave I been waiting for nigh upon two hours, and nobody\u0027s made a move toward me.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I\u0027ve heard something of this,\u0027 said our reporter, pushing Mrs. Middle more into a cab, and giving the driver instructions to drive quickly to Gerard Street. It was not without difficulty he succeeded in this, for Mrs. Middlemore, with the fear of the \u0027Government\u0027 upon her, wanted to remain in Bow Street. \u0027I met Sophy before I came here, and she told me you had been sent for to the police Station. Now be quiet, will you? Have you not promised to be guided by me?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But the Government, sir, the Government! I shall be clapped in prison!\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You\u0027ll be nothing of the sort. The Government and I are friends, and you are perfectly safe if you do as I tell you.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I must, I serpose, sir. There\u0027s nothink else for it, but I\u0027m being wore to a shadder. If this goes on much longer I sha\u0027n\u0027t \u0027ave a ounce of flesh on my bones. Yer sor Sophy, sir, did yer? Yer\u0027ve been at the \u0027ouse, then?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, I have been at your house, but it was not there that I saw your niece. I met her in the street, and she informed me that you were at Bow Street Police Station.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What was the \u0027uzzy doing in the streets?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I can\u0027t say, but in the streets she was forced to remain.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Why, sir, the \u0027ouse was open to \u0027er. I met \u0027er and told \u0027er to go \u0027ome and wait till I come back.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Exactly. And she did go, and knocked at the door, as I did, but she was as unsuccessful as I was. She did not get in.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027\u0027Ow can that be, sir? The perlice officer was there, waiting to open the door for \u0027er. The lazy slut! She\u0027s been telling yer a parcel of lies.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027How about myself, Mrs. Middlemore? Am I telling you a parcel of lies when I say that I knocked pretty loudly at your door, and that no one came to open it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I wouldn\u0027t dispute your word, sir, but I can\u0027t make it out.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I can, and I will explain it to you presently, inside your house, if we can manage to get in. Here we are. Jump out.\u0027 \n \n \"The cab being discharged, Mrs. Middlemore knocked and rang, but knocked and rang in vain. \n \n \"\u0027Allo, anty!\u0027 said Sophy, coming up. \u0027\u0027Ave they found Mr. Felix\u0027s body?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027\u0027Ush, you \u0027uzzy,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, clapping her hand on the girl\u0027s mouth. \u0027What do yer mean by being outside instead of in?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What do I mean?\u0027 retorted Sophy, with an air of great enjoyment. \u0027Why, \u0027cause I couldn\u0027t git in. I knocked and knocked, jest as you\u0027re doing of now, but nobody answered.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I understood,\u0027 said our reporter to Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027that you generally carry your latchkey with you.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027So I do sir, but I didn\u0027t \u0027ave it in my pocket when the perlice officer come; it was downstairs on the kitchen table. I wanted to go down and fetch it, but he wouldn\u0027t let me wait a minute. \"If yer ain\u0027t quick,\" he said, \"yer\u0027ll git yerself in trouble;\" and he bundled me out of the \u0027ouse. That\u0027s \u0027ow it was, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027The question is,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027how we are to get in. Is there a back way?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Then we must get in by the front door or window. The window will be the easiest. It is fastened inside in the usual way, I suppose?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027The easiest plan will be for me to break one of the panes in such a manner as to attract as little notice as possible, and then put my hand through and undo the fastening. Then we can lift the sash, and Sophy can get in and unlock the street door for us.\u0027 \n \n \"I\u0027m game,\u0027 said Sophy, to whom any task of this kind was especially inviting. \n \n \"Our reporter was about to put his plan into execution when Mrs. Middlemore clutched his arm. He instantly withdrew it. \n \n \"\u0027Of course, Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 he said, coldly, \u0027it is your house, and I can\u0027t commit a trespass without your permission.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027It ain\u0027t that, sir,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, piteously. \u0027Sophy\u0027s a plucky little thing, and though I do give \u0027er a \u0027ard word now and then, I mean well by \u0027er, I do indeed, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yer a good sort, aunty,\u0027 said Sophy. \u0027I don\u0027t mind yer \u0027ard words, not a bit.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027\u0027Old yer saucy tongue, and let me speak to the gentleman. Yes, sir, I mean well by Sophy, and I should never \u0027ave another minute\u0027s peace if anythink was to appen to \u0027er.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What do you think will happen to her if I do what I propose?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027There\u0027s been one sudding death in the \u0027ouse, sir----.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Go on, Mrs. Middlemore. Don\u0027t stop in the middle of a sentence; finish what you have to say. Time is very precious just now.\u0027 \n \n \"There\u0027s been one sudding death in the \u0027ouse, and now there\u0027s a man in there as won\u0027t or can\u0027t answer.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You fear he might be dead. If so, he cannot do Sophy any harm. Eh, Sophy?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not \u0027im. It\u0027d take more nor one dead man to scare Sophy. Jest you open the winder, and I\u0027ll be in like a shot.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Have I your permission now, Mrs. Middlemore?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But if he shouldn\u0027t be dead, sor. If he was laying in wait with a crowbar to knock Sophy on the \u0027ead----\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Oh, you are beginning to think the man who called upon you was not a police officer, after all?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I\u0027m beginning to have my doubts, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I never had any. He is as much a police officer as you are. He told you a cock and bull story, and got rid of you. He was left in the house alone, and, more for your sake than my own, I want to find out what he has been up to. Decide quickly, please.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Do what you like, sir. You\u0027ve been right in everything; but things are getting more and more mysterious.\u0027 \n \n \"Without wasting more words our reporter pushed his elbow into a pane, and putting his hand through, undid the fastening and raised the sash. Sophy climbed in like a cat, and the next minute the street door was open. They entered and closed the door behind them. \n \n \"\u0027We will proceed systematically,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027The man spoke to you in the passage here.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir; and sed he\u0027d wait.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you tell him to wait in the kitchen, or the parlor, or in any particular room?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, sir; I left it to \u0027im.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Doubtless he has been into every room in the house. We will go into the kitchen first.\u0027 \n \n \"Nothing had been disturbed there; the key of the street-door was on the kitchen table. Our reporter took it up and examined it closely. \n \n \"\u0027As I imagined,\u0027 he said. \u0027He has taken an impression of the key in wax.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What for, sir?\u0027 asked Mrs. Middlemore, in great trepidation. \n \n \"\u0027To enable him to enter the house again secretly, if he wished. When I am gone send for a plumber and a locksmith. Let the plumber put in the pane of glass, and have another lock put on the street door. Your visitor must have been in a hurry, or he would have cleaned this key more carefully.\u0027 \n \n \"From the kitchen they went into the parlor, and apparently nothing had been disturbed there. Then they proceeded upstairs to the rooms occupied by M. Felix. \n \n \"\u0027Look carefully round,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027and tell me if anything has been taken away.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nothink, sir, that I can see.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But there may have been papers, or money, or something of which he wishes to obtain possession, secreted somewhere, and it is quite likely he may have found them.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I won\u0027t dispute you, sir. You see further than I do; but it don\u0027t seem as if anythink\u0027s been took.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Or moved? The ornaments on the mantelshelf--are they all there?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I don\u0027t miss one, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But they have been shifted. Here is this vase; observe the circle upon which it stood. The vase has been lifted and put down again, but not on the exact spot it occupied when he took it up. This proves the object for which he came; he has been searching for something, and has probably found it and taken it away. How could you have been so foolish as to leave him in the house alone?\u0027 \n \n \"Mrs. Middlemore sank helpless into a chair, and moaned. \u0027What else could I do, sir, what else could I do? It\u0027ll be the death of me, I know it will!\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not at all. It only proves that we have cunning persons to work against. I am all the more determined to track this mystery down.\u0027 He opened the bedroom door, and exclaimed, \u0027Here is direct evidence. The fellow has not been so careful in this room. Chairs have been moved, the bedclothes are disturbed. Why, where is the revolver?\u0027 \n \n \"He referred to the revolver which he had found beneath the pillows, and which he had replaced. It had been abstracted. Inwardly he congratulated himself that he had not only taken a full note of the description of the weapon, but had also scratched the initial,\u0027F.\u0027 on the metal. He took, out his pocketbook and turned to the page upon which he had made an entry. \n \n \"\u0027Listen to this, Mrs. Middlemore, and be thankful that you have a friend like me on your side: \"A Colt\u0027s double action revolver, nickel-plated, six shots, No. 819.\" I can swear to that revolver, and moreover can swear that it was loaded. Are you satisfied now that you have been imposed upon, and that the man who visited you came upon a bogus errand?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Of course I am, sir, but what could \u0027ave been \u0027is objec\u0027--\u0027Oh, what could \u0027ave been \u0027is objec\u0027?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That has yet to be discovered, and discovered it shall be. The abstraction of this revolver may assist us. The fellow does not dream that I have its description here, and that it can be sworn to. Surely he was not dressed as a policeman?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, sir, he sed he was a private officer.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027And you believed him?\u0027 \n \n \"Again Mrs. Middlemore moaned, \u0027What else could I do, sir? what else could I do? He spoke that confident and easy that an angel would \u0027ave believed what he sed.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Don\u0027t be taken in again. Be just a little more careful in your dealings with strangers.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I will, sir, I will.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I don\u0027t see that I can do any good by remaining here. I should like, though, to take down from your lips a description of the man. You can give it to me, I hope?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I can, sir. A tall man, very thin, with a long thin face and thick black eyebrows.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Is that all?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027All I can remember, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"Our reporter wrote the words in his pocketbook, and asked, \u0027Can you tell me how he was dressed?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Only that he had dark clothes on.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You would know him again if you saw him?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I could swear to him, sir.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Come, that is a satisfaction. You can swear to the man, and I can swear to the revolver. Two direct pieces of evidence, if we can lay hands upon them.\u0027 \n \n \"Sophy unexpectedly presented herself as an additional witness. \u0027I can swear to \u0027im too,\u0027 she said. \n \n \"\u0027Ah, Sophy, you are invaluable,\u0027 said our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027Didn\u0027t I say the slut was telling us a parcel of lies?\u0027 cried Mrs. Middlemore, making a movement as though she were about to fall upon the girl. \n \n \"\u0027Easy, Mrs. Middlemore, easy,\u0027 said our reporter, holding the housekeeper back. \u0027Let us hear what Sophy has to say.\u0027 \n \n \"But Sophy, firing up, diverged a moment. \u0027Jest look \u0027ere, aunty,\u0027 she said, with spirit. \u0027Don\u0027t yer be so fast with yer sluts and yer \u0027uzzies. I\u0027m gitting tired of it, I am. I ain\u0027t told one lie yet, and if yer don\u0027t mind what yer about I\u0027ll keep my mouth shut.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, Sophy, my girl,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027you will do nothing of the sort. You will tell me all you know about this man.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Jest you make \u0027er be civil, then,\u0027 said Sophy. \u0027She does nothink but bully me day and night. She don\u0027t pay me no wages, and I ain\u0027t going to stand it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Be reasonable Sophy,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027Your aunt is worried, and you must make excuses for her.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Ain\u0027t I flesh and blood the same as she is?\u0027 continued the irate girl. \u0027I\u0027ve a good mind to run away from \u0027er, that I am, and never come back no more. I\u0027ll do it. Tata, aunty, and thank yer for nothink.\u0027 \n \n \"Had it not been for our reporter, she would have run out of the house. He laid his hand gently on her arm, and said: \n \n \"\u0027Don\u0027t forget your promise to me, Sophy.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I won\u0027t; I\u0027ll keep it, never fear. I\u0027ll wear myself to skin and bone for yer--yes, I will, if it\u0027ll do yer any good; but I won\u0027t be bullied by \u0027er no more.\u0027 \n \n \"Sophy\u0027s threat terrified Mrs. Middlemore; the prospect of being left in the house alone was appalling, and she straightway fell to on humble pie. \n \n \"\u0027I\u0027m sorry for what I sed, Sophy, and I beg yer parding, and I\u0027ll give yer sixpence a week. There, now, be a good gal. But yer did tell us yer couldn\u0027t git into the \u0027ouse.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No more I could. I knocked and rattled and kicked the door, and nobody come. \u0027Ow should I know that a tall, thin man, with a long face and thick black eyebrows, was the feller as took yer in?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You saw him, then?\u0027 said our reporter, observing that Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s apology and, the promise of sixpence a week had mollified the girl. \n \n \"\u0027Yes, I sor \u0027im before I got to the \u0027ouse, but I didn\u0027t know he come out of it. He was jest what aunty sed he was, and what\u0027s more, he \u0027ad large flat feet.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If you saw him again you could swear to him?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I\u0027d pick \u0027im out of a thousan.\u0027 He run agin me, he did, and I sed, \"Who are yer pushing of?\" He didn\u0027t say nothink, but walked off forty to the dozen.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Looking as if he did not wish to attract notice?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, he did look like that.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Was he carrying anything?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not that I sor. He \u0027ad \u0027is coat buttoned up.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027When he come to me,\u0027 said Mrs. Middlemore, \u0027it was unbuttoned.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Proving that he took something away with him. Anything else Sophy?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Nothink else.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You and your aunt are friends now, are you not?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Oh, I don\u0027t bear no malice.\u0027 \n \n \"Mrs. Middlemore kissed Sophy, and her anger was entirely dispelled. Once more our reporter, having made peace between them, attempted to leave, but Mrs. Middlemore said, imploringly: \n \n \"\u0027Would yer mind looking all over the \u0027ouse fust? He might be \u0027iding in it to murder us in the night.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Sophy saw him walking away,\u0027 said our reporter; \u0027but to satisfy you I will go into every room; and I\u0027ll do something more, if you are agreeable. Could you make me up a bed?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, sir, I could, in any room you like.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027M. Felix\u0027s bedroom will do for me. Don\u0027t look startled; I am almost as brave as Sophy. Put the bed straight, and I\u0027ll come some time between eleven and twelve o\u0027clock, and pass the night here.\u0027 \n \n \"Mrs. Middlemore was profuse in her thanks, and our reporter searched the house from top to bottom. Assuring the housekeeper that she was quite safe, he succeeded in making his escape.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48895.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
