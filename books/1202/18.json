{"id":43689,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. HOW THE CHARGE WAS DISPOSED OF.","content":"\"On the following morning, at half-past ten, our reporter presented himself at the Bow Street Police Court, and was allowed a private interview with Constance\u0027s mother, whom we must for the present designate by the name she had assumed, Mrs. Weston. She looked worn and pale, but beneath these traces of physical fatigue our reporter observed in her an undefinable expression of moral strength which surprised him. He had yet to learn, as our readers have, that this woman\u0027s delicate frame was ennobled by those lofty attributes of endurance and fortitude and moral power which in human history have helped to make both heroes and martyrs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You have passed a bad night,\u0027 said our reporter, commiseratingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027In one sense I have,\u0027 said Mrs. Weston, \u0027but hope and prayer have sustained me, and the Inspector has been very kind to me. Tell me of my daughter.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He briefly related the particulars of his interview with Constance, but made no mention of the red silk scarf. She thanked him with great sweetness for the trouble he had taken, and said that she had been wonderfully comforted by the belief that she had providentially met with so true a friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Time will prove,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027that you are not deceived in your belief, but the manifestation of this proof will depend greatly upon yourself. To speak more precisely, in your hands appears to me to rest the power of accelerating events and of setting wrong things right. I am speaking partly in the dark, from a kind of spiritual intuition as it were, but when I strike a trail I have something of the bloodhound in me; innocence will find in me a firm champion, guilt I will pursue till I track it to its threshold.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The words were grandiloquent, it is true, but it was scarcely possible to doubt their sincerity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027In resolving to confide thoroughly in you,\u0027 said Mrs. Weston, gazing earnestly at him, \u0027I am risking more than you can possibly imagine. I am like a shipwrecked woman to whom a prospect of deliverance has suddenly appeared. I ask for no professions; I will trust you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You will live to thank the chance which has thrown us together,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027I do not hesitate to say that you have aroused in me a strange interest; I devote myself to your cause heartily, in the conviction that I am championing the cause of right and innocence.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tears sprang in her eyes. \u0027Shall I be released today?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I am confident of it. I want to say a word to the Inspector.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Inspector Jealous, who was standing near, he expressed his thanks for the kindness he had shown Mrs. Weston. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Well, you see,\u0027 said the inspector, in the first place it was enough that she is a friend of yours; in the second place, it was enough that she is a lady. I can read signs; she does not belong to the classes we are in the habit of dealing with.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027She does not,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027The whole affair is a mistake, excusable enough on the part of the policeman, but regrettable because of the distress it has caused an innocent lady. I shall make no complaint against the policeman, on the score of over-officiousness; he was within his rights, and on abstract grounds is perhaps to be commended for his mistaken zeal.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was a wise and prudent speech, and the Inspector, already kindly disposed, conveyed it, before the case was called on, to the ears of the policeman who had made the charge. Assured that no attempt would be made by our reporter to bring him into disrepute, he toned down his evidence considerably, and himself assisted in the dismissal of the case, the brief particulars of which we extract from our police columns: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Groundless Charge.--Mary Weston, a woman of respectable appearance, was charged with attempting to commit suicide. Constable 382 C said that he was on duty on the Thames Embankment last night, about twelve o\u0027clock, when he saw the woman standing on the stone parapet close to Cleopatra\u0027s Needle. Drawing near to her he heard a splash in the water, and the woman was falling forward when he seized her and pulled her away. A gentleman in court laid hold of the woman at the same time, and assisted him in preventing her from carrying out her purpose. The gentleman referred to, Mr. Robert Agnold, one of the reporters upon the Evening Moon, and also a properly qualified solicitor, said he appeared for the accused, who distinctly denied that she had any intention of committing suicide. He was himself a witness of the occurrence, and was convinced that the constable, who had behaved very well throughout the affair, had acted under a mistaken impression. The magistrate asked the constable what caused the splash? The constable replied something the accused threw into the river. The magistrate: \u0027Did you see what it was?\u0027 The constable: \u0027No.\u0027 Mr. Agnold: \u0027I should state that the accused admits throwing something into the river, and that in the act of doing so she overbalanced herself and so aroused the constable\u0027s suspicions. Whatever it was that she threw away, it was her own property and presumably valueless, and, although her action was open to an eccentric construction, it could go no farther than that. She had a perfect right to do what she pleased with what belonged to her.\u0027 The constable said that search had been made for it, but it had not been found. The woman went quietly to the station, but refused to give her address. She was not known to the police, and there was no evidence of her having been charged before. The magistrate, to the accused: \u0027Have you any trouble that urged you to put an end to your life?\u0027 The accused, whose speech was distinguished by great modesty and refinement: \u0027I have troubles, as other people have, but none that could impel me to an act so sinful. Nothing was farther from my thoughts than the attempt with which I am charged. I have done no wrong.\u0027 Mr. Agnold: \u0027Apart from my position as her professional adviser, I will answer for her in every way.\u0027 The magistrate: \u0027She is discharged.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was half-past twelve when Mrs. Weston and our reporter issued from the police court. They walked in silence toward Leicester Square, which, in contrast to the thronged thoroughfares immediately adjoining it, is at this time of the day comparatively quiet. Mrs. Weston looked around inquiringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Do you know where we are?\u0027 asked our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027No,\u0027 she replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Then you are not well acquainted with London?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not very well.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027This is Leicester Square. We are not far from Gerard street, Soho, where M. Felix was found dead.\u0027 A tremor passed through her, and the hand which rested upon our reporter\u0027s arm pressed it convulsively. He did not pursue the subject, but said, \u0027All\u0027s well that ends well. Your daughter will see you earlier than she expects. You will go straight home, I suppose?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Not straight. I am fearful of being followed. Heaven knows whether I shall be able to accomplish the task that lies before me, but whatever I do must be done without drawing notice upon myself. I will not disguise from you that I have innocently placed myself in a false position, and that I am in danger. I cannot explain my words at this moment; I am anxious to see my beloved child; but I must repeat what I have said to you before, that no sin or guilt lies at my door.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I understand that, and I will bide your time. You are afraid that we are being watched. I see no one in sight that can be dogging us, but I can provide against the remotest possibility if you will allow me to accompany you part of the way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She accepted his services gratefully, and he hailed a cab, the driver of which he directed to proceed in an opposite direction to Forston Street, Camden Town. When the cab had gone a couple of miles they alighted and walked the length of two or three streets, our reporter keeping a sharp lookout; then another cab was hailed, which drove them to Camden Town, about a quarter of a mile from Forston Street. They walked together to within fifty yards of No. 21, and then Mrs. Weston paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You wish me to leave you here,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027Shall I see you again soon?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027This evening, at eight o\u0027clock,\u0027 she replied, \u0027if you will call upon me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I will be punctual.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I ought to tell you before you go,\u0027 she said, in a low tone, \u0027that the name I gave at the police station is not my own. I was justified in giving a false name; otherwise the knowledge of my--my disgrace might have reached my daughter.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You use a wrong term,\u0027 said our reporter, \u0027no disgrace whatever attaches to you. Good-by till this evening.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He shook hands with her and walked briskly away. He had nothing of importance to attend to in the office of the Evening Moon, but he was expected to present himself there, and it was necessary that he should arrange to have the afternoon and evening free. This being settled, he turned toward Gerard Street, with the intention of calling upon Mrs. Middlemore, to ascertain whether anything fresh had transpired. He knocked vainly at the door, however, Mrs. Middlemore was not in the house. At the bottom of Gerard Street he encountered Sophy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Ah, Sophy,\u0027 he said, \u0027I have just been to your house.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027\u0027Ave yer?\u0027 said Sophy, sidling up to him. \u0027Aunty ain\u0027t at \u0027ome.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027So I discovered. Where is she?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027At the perlice station,\u0027 answered the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Anything wrong?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But what has she gone for?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s about Mr. Felix.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027About Mr. Felix!\u0027 he exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027So she ses.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But what is the meaning of it, Sophy?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I can\u0027t tell yer. All I know is I meets aunty with a face like pickled cabbage, running and blowing and \u0027olding \u0027er sides, and I arks \u0027er what she\u0027s in sech a \u0027urry about. \u0027It\u0027s about poor Mr. Felix,\u0027 she ses, as well as she could speak; she was that out of breath she could \u0027ardly git \u0027er words out. \u0027They\u0027ve found out somethink, and they\u0027ve sent for me to the perlice station. You go \u0027ome at once and wait till I come back.\u0027 \u0027Ow shall I get in?\u0027 I arks; aunty never gives me the door-key; ketch \u0027er doing that! \u0027Ow shall I get in?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a gent there,\u0027 ses aunty, as \u0027ill open the door for yer.\u0027 \u0027I goes and knocks, and as no gent comes and opens the door for me, I takes a walk.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Is that all you know, Sophy?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027That\u0027s all. I don\u0027t keep nothink from you--not likely.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Can you tell me the name of the police station?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh, yes, I can tell yer that. Bow Street.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our reporter did not wait to exchange any further words, but hastened as fast as he could to the Bow Street Police Court. He was close to it when a constable accosted him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I was coming for you at the Evening Moon office, sir,\u0027 said the constable. \u0027The Inspector sent me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027What does he want?\u0027 asked our reporter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027They\u0027ve fished up something from the river. He thought you would like to see it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I should.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As he entered the doors his coat was plucked by Mrs. Middlemore. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Ah, Mrs. Middlemore,\u0027 he said, hastily, \u0027I will speak to you presently. Don\u0027t go away; I will be out in a minute or two.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48893.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
