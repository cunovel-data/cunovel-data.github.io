{"id":43726,"no":55,"title":"CHAPTER LV. TREACHERY.","content":"\"News, Agnold!\" cried Bob, when I joined him in the country. \n \n \"Bravo!\" I said, \"out with it.\" \n \n \"Three men answering to the description of those we are seeking were seen yesterday on the road to Monkshead.\" \n \n \"Where is that?\" \n \n \"Thirty-two miles from here, as the crow flies.\" \n \n \"Who gave you the information?\" \n \n \"Crawley. The fellow is of some use, after all.\" \n \n I was not so sure, but when I questioned Crawley he was so precise and circumstantial in his account that I saw no valid reason to discredit him. He had received the news from a teamster, he said, who had passed the men on the road. Were they walking? Yes. How did the teamster know they were going to Monkshead? They were on the high road. How far from Monkshead? About ten miles. \n \n \"I have asked questions,\" said Crawley, \"of every stranger who has passed through the village, and this was the only one who could tell me anything at all.\" \n \n \"Did you describe Dr. Peterssen\u0027s appearance to him?\" I asked. \n \n \"Yes, and he said it was something like another of the men.\" \n \n \"Did you describe the third?\" \n \n \"How could I, when I never saw him?\" \n \n I had put the last question as a test of Crawley\u0027s truthfulness; if he had answered otherwise, the doubts I had of his veracity would have been strengthened. \n \n \"You believe he is speaking the truth, Bob?\" I asked my friend, Crawley being out of hearing. \n \n \"What reason has he to tell lies?\" asked Bob, in return. \n \n \"To show that he is doing something toward earning his wages.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s cutting it rather fine,\" said Bob. \"You are giving Crawley credit for intellect; I think he is not overstocked in that respect. Can\u0027t afford to throw away a chance, Agnold.\" \n \n \"Certainly not, and this chance shall not be slighted. But we will not risk everything upon the hazard. My plan is this. Crawley, Sophy, and I will go to Monkshead on a voyage of discovery. You shall remain here to take advantage of anything that may turn up. I will keep you posted as to our movements; you will keep me posted as to yours. Blessings on the electric telegraph. You will repeat all telegrams that arrive for me to such places as I shall direct, retaining the originals in case of miscarriage. Do you agree to all this?\" \n \n \"I must,\" said Bob, \"though I would rather go with you.\" \n \n \"There would then be no one left in command here, and we should be burning our ships.\" \n \n \"All right. You are welcome to Crawley. Must you take Sophy?\" \n \n \"I must. She is the only one in our party who is familiar with M. Felix. If we hunt Peterssen down, M. Felix will most likely be with him, and Sophy is at hand for the purpose of identification. Should I have reason to believe we have struck the right trail, I will wire to you, and you can come on to us. Say agreed, old fellow.\" \n \n \"Agreed, old fellow.\" \n \n After that Bob and I were closeted together for an hour, setting down all our arrangements in black and white; then I prepared to depart. \n \n \"Good luck, Agnold,\" said the faithful Bob. \"Send for me soon.\" \n \n \"As soon as I can. I want you to be in at the death.\" \n \n I spoke these words lightly, with no notion of their ominous significance, and a carriage and pair having been got ready for us, Crawley, Sophy, and I took our seats in it, and bowled along to Monkshead. We arrived there at noon on the following day, and at the post-office I found two telegrams sent by Bob, one from himself saying that stagnation was the order of things, the other a copy of one forwarded from Emilia in London, in which she said that she had not heard from M. Bordier, and expected that he was on his way to her. The whole of the afternoon I was engaged in the attempt to discover whether any persons answering to the description of Dr. Peterssen and his companions had made any stay in Monkshead. I learnt nothing of a satisfactory nature, and, thoroughly exhausted, I was discontentedly refreshing the inner man, Sophy sitting at the same table with me, when Crawley, who had been out making inquiries, came in with a man who looked like what he was--a tramp. \n \n \"Here\u0027s a fellow,\" said Crawley, \"who can tell us something.\" \n \n \"If I\u0027m paid for it,\" said the tramp. \n \n \"You shall be paid for your trouble,\" I said, giving him a shilling. \"This is on account. You shall have another if your information is satisfactory.\" \n \n \"He has tramped from Deering,\" said Crawley, \"and passed the parties we are looking for.\" \n \n \"How far off?\" I asked. \n \n \"A matter of forty miles,\" replied the tramp. \n \n \"Were they riding or walking?\" \n \n \"Two was riding, one was walking.\" \n \n \"What was the conveyance?\" \n \n \"What do you mean?\" \n \n \"Were they riding in a carriage?\" \n \n \"No, in a cart; top of sack of hay.\" \n \n \"What is the man who was walking like?\" \n \n His description enabled me to recognize Dr. Peterssen; it tallied with that given to me by Emilia, Bob, and Sophy. \n \n \"And the two men riding on the hay?\" I asked. \"Can\u0027t be so sure of them,\" said the tramp; but his description warranted the belief that they were Dr. Peterssen\u0027s patient and M. Felix. As to the latter I consulted Sophy, and she said it was something like M. Felix. \n \n \"How do you know,\" I inquired, \"that these men were travelling in company?\" \n \n \"\u0027Cause two of \u0027em--one as was walking and the other as was riding--was talking to one another.\" \n \n \"Did you hear what they said?\" \n \n \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" \n \n He had nothing more to tell me, and he took his departure after receiving his second shilling. \n \n I turned to Crawley and asked him how he had picked up the tramp. \n \n \"I was having half a pint at the Staff\u0027s Head,\" replied Crawley, \"when he came in. Seeing he was a tramp, stood him a pint, and asked him where he\u0027d come from. From Deering, he said. Then I asked him whether he\u0027d met anybody in particular on the road, and he said nobody; but when I spoke of three men in company, and gave him an idea of what Dr. Peterssen was like, he brightened up and told me what he told you. I thought you had better see him, so I brought him along.\" \n \n I nodded and said we would start for Deering in the morning, and Crawley went to the bar to refresh himself. Now, whether I was influenced by my original latent suspicions of Crawley, or by the non-success I was meeting with, one thing was certain. I was not entirely satisfied with Crawley, and my dissatisfaction was not lessened by the fact that I could find no valid reasons for mistrusting him. Later on it will be seen whether I was right or wrong in my impressions, but, as will also presently be seen, the trail I was following up, whether it were true or false, led to important results, the mere remembrance of which will abide with me as long as I live. \n \n We did not reach Deering till late the next night. The post-office was closed, and I could not obtain the telegrams which I had directed Bob to forward till the morrow. As on the previous day, there were two--one from Bob with no news, the other from Emilia expressing anxiety regarding the continued silence and absence of M. Bordier. I myself considered it strange, and I sympathized with Emilia\u0027s unexpressed fears that she had been buoyed up by false hopes. Things altogether were looking gloomy; we seemed to be drifting without a rudder, and my experiences in Deering tended still further to discourage me. There were no traces of the men I was seeking, and after dispatching letters and telegrams to Bob and Emilia, I seriously discussed with myself the advisability of returning to London and awaiting news of M. Bordier. Sophy broke in upon my cogitations. \n \n \"I\u0027ve found \u0027em out,\" she said, with a flushed face. \"That there Crawley is taking of us in, you see if he ain\u0027t. He\u0027s been telling a pack of lies with \u0027is \u0027ay cart and \u0027is tramp. He\u0027s got \u0027old of another cove, and is bringing of \u0027im \u0027ere. I \u0027eerd \u0027im telling the chap what to say to yer. I\u0027m mum. \u0027Ere he is.\" \n \n Sure enough there entered Crawley with another tramp, who told me a plausible story of having met Dr. Peterssen and his companions some thirty miles off. The fellow played his part fairly well, and when I refused to give him money, began to bully. I soon silenced him, however, by threatening to give him into custody on a charge of conspiracy, and he slunk away without another word, but with a secret sign to Crawley, which I detected. Crawley would have followed him, but I had got between him and the door. \n \n \"You miserable sneak,\" I said, \"your game\u0027s at an end. So, you\u0027ve been coached by your scoundrelly employer, Peterssen, to deceive us, and I was fool enough to be taken in by you. What have you to say about it?\" \n \n He looked at me slyly, but did not speak. \n \n \"You are frightened that you may criminate yourself, but you have done that already. I can prove that you have robbed us of money under false pretences; I can prove that you have entered into a conspiracy against us. Do you know the punishment for conspiracy? It is penal servitude, my friend. You wince at that. Honesty would have served your interests better, my fine fellow. Had you not behaved treacherously you would have been made for life. And now you will find that you have fallen between two stools. You think that Dr. Peterssen will reward you. You are mistaken. He has promised you a sum of money for misleading us. You will not get a penny of it. You fool! Better for you to have trusted straightforward gentlemen who had the means, and had the will, to richly reward you, than a scoundrel like your master, who has used you as a tool. You are to report the success of your treachery to him personally. Where? In London? Go to him there, go to the address he gave you, and try and find him. As he has rogued others, he has rogued you. Before you are many hours older, you will learn that honesty would have been your best policy.\" \n \n The play of his features proved to me that all my shots were faithful and had struck home. I gave him a parting one. \n \n \"I will put the police on your track. You are a marked man from this day, and you and your master will have to answer in the criminal dock for the crimes of which you are guilty.\" \n \n I had moved from the door, and he, seizing the opportunity, darted through it and was gone. \n \n \"Fine words!\" I exclaimed. \"Much good they will do!\" \n \n \"Never mind,\" said faithful Sophy. \"You gave it \u0027im \u0027ot, and no mistake. You frightened \u0027im out of \u0027is life; he\u0027ll shy at every peeler he meets.\" \n \n \"It will not help us,\" I said, in a rueful tone. \"We are at a dead-lock.\" \n \n \"Never say die,\" said Sophy, cheerfully. \"That ain\u0027t a bit like yer.\" \n \n Upon my word her encouragement put fresh life into me, and I grew less despondent. Determined to leave Deering as quickly as possible, I went to see about a trap, and here I met with another disappointment. I could not get a trap till the following day. \n \n \"We shall have to wait until to-morrow, Sophy,\" I said. \"So let us make ourselves comfortable. I wonder if there\u0027s a local newspaper about. I will read you the news if there is; it will help to pass the time.\" \n \n Upon what slender foundations do momentous issues hang! A pregnant proof of this truism was at hand. There was no newspaper printed at Deering, but at Fleetdyke, the nearest place of importance, was published a small daily sheet called the Fleetdyke Herald. The landlord at the inn at which we put up did not take in the paper, but it happened that a traveller, making pause there, had left behind him two copies of as recent date as yesterday and the day before. These the landlord brought in to me, and I sat down to entertain Sophy, who prepared herself for an hour of great enjoyment. \n \n \"What things in a newspaper do you like best, Sophy?\" I asked. \n \n \"Perlice Courts,\" she replied, \"when I gets the chance of anybody reading \u0027em out--about once in a bloo moon, yer know.\" \n \n \"Police Courts it shall be,\" I said. \"I have a fancy for them myself.\" \n \n So evidently had the Editor of the Fleetdyke Herald, who seemed to make it a special feature of his paper to gather the police-court news of a rather wide district around his locality as an attraction to his subscribers. I had read aloud to Sophy four or five of the most entertaining cases when I was startled by the heading, \"Tampering with a registrar\u0027s book. Strange case.\" I read the report under this heading rapidly to myself, and Sophy, observing that something had startled me, sat in silence and did not speak a word. The case was not concluded in the paper I was reading from. The last line ran: \"Adjourned till to-morrow for the production of an important witness from London.\" I looked at the date of the newspaper--it was the day before yesterday. The other paper which I had not yet taken up was of yesterday\u0027s date, and I found in it the conclusion of the case. The first day\u0027s report, with its pregnant heading, startled me, as I have said. The second day\u0027s report startled me still more. By the merest accident my fingers were on the pulse of the torture of Emilia\u0027s life. I ran down to the bar; the landlord stood behind it, wiping some glasses. \n \n \"Is the village of Glasserton at a great distance from here?\" I asked. \n \n \"Oh, no,\" replied the landlord, \"about eleven miles. You can shorten it by two miles if you cut through Deering Woods.\" \n \n I glanced at the clock--half-past four. \"It\u0027s a melancholy walk through the woods,\" remarked the landlord, \"but to be sure the moon will rise at ten.\" \n \n \"Can anyone show me the short cut?\" I asked. \"I wish particularly to go to Glasserton to-night.\" \n \n \"My daughter will put you in the way of it.\" \n \n \"Thank you. Ask her to get ready. I will give her half-a-crown for her trouble.\" \n \n I called to Sophy, and asked her if she was ready fur a long walk. \n \n \"I am ready for anything,\" she said, \"along o\u0027 you.\" \n \n \"Ten miles there, and ten miles back, Sophy,\" I said, for it was my intention to return to the inn that night. \n \n \"I\u0027ll walk all night if yer want me to.\" \n \n \"Come along, then, my girl.\" \n \n I settled my account with the landlord before I left, and then, accompanied by his daughter, a girl of fourteen, we walked to Deering Woods. \n \n \"There!\" said she, \"keep on this track and it will take you right through the woods till you reach the road for Glasserton. When you come to two tracks keep to the left.\" \n \n The directions she gave were clear, and I made her happy with the promised half-a-crown. \n \n \"How far do the woods extend?\" I asked. \n \n \"You\u0027ll have to walk six or seven miles,\" she replied, \"before you get out of \u0027em--and mind you take care of the cliffs. They\u0027re dangerous.\" \n \n \"We shall see them, I suppose, before we come on them?\" \n \n \"Oh, you\u0027ll see \u0027em right enough, but nobody goes nearer to \u0027em than they can help.\" \n \n She stood looking after us till thick clusters of trees hid us from her sight. \n \n \"Step out, Sophy,\" I said, \"we\u0027ve got a long walk before us.\" \n \n An explanation of the motive for my sudden visit to Glasserton will be found in the following extracts from the Fleetdyke Herald: \n \n THE FIRST EXTRACT. \n \n \"Tampering with a Register Book. Strange Case.--M. Bordier and his son, Julian Bordier, of Swiss extraction, were charged with erasing a name, and writing another over it, from a marriage entry in the register book of marriages in the parish of Glasserton. Mr. Hare, the registrar, stated that the accused visited him yesterday afternoon, for the purpose, as they said, of verifying a copy of a marriage certificate which they brought with them. The marriage in question was solemnized over nineteen years ago, and, according to the entry as it now stands, was between Gerald Paget and Emilia Braham, The elder of the accused made the examination, and professed himself satisfied. He then requested the registrar to step out of the office with him, saying that he wished to make some private inquiries of him. The registrar consented, and the two went outside for a few minutes, the questions which M. Bordier asked relating to the witnesses to the marriage, Julian Bordier meanwhile remaining alone in the office with, the register book. Mr. Hare, who has been registrar for nine or ten months only, answered the questions to the best of his ability, and then M. Bordier summoned his son from the office, and the accused departed. In the evening Mr. Hare had occasion to consult the register book, and as a matter of curiosity he referred to the entry which his visitors in the afternoon had called to verify. To his astonishment he discovered that the name of the bridegroom had been erased, and the name of Gerald Paget written over the erasure. His suspicions fell immediately upon M. Bordier and Julian Bordier, and learning that they had left the village, he obtained a warrant for their arrest, and, with a policeman, started in pursuit. The accused were greatly agitated when told to consider themselves under arrest, and the elder of the two commenced an explanation, to which, however, Mr. Hare and the constable refused to listen. He then begged to be permitted to write and telegraph to London for legal and professional assistance which, he said, would establish their innocence, and his request being granted, he wrote and despatched both letters and telegrams. The registrar having finished his evidence, the magistrate said the case was quite clear, and asked the accused what they had to say in their defence. M. Bordier, who assumed the office of spokesman, his son preserving a somewhat scornful silence, handed the magistrate two telegrams he had received from London in reply to those he had despatched. M. Bordier said that he refrained from putting any questions to the registrar, giving as a reason that he was ignorant of the procedure in English Courts of Justice. The magistrate, having read the telegrams, remarked that the names attached to them were those of eminent and renowned gentlemen whose time must be very valuable. As they promised to attend the court on the following morning and were anxious to return on the same day the accused were therefore remanded till to-morrow for the production of these important witnesses from London.\" \n \n THE SECOND EXTRACT. \n \n Tampering with a Register Book. Strange and Important Evidence.--Result.--M. Bordier and his son, Julian Bordier, were brought up on remand on the charge of altering a signature in a marriage entry in the register book of the parish of Glasserton. Upon the case being called Mr. Lawson, of the well-known firm of Lawson \u0026 Lawson, St. Helen\u0027s, London, who said he appeared for the defence, asked that Mr. Shepherd, the eminent expert in caligraphy, should be allowed to examine the register book, and the application was granted. The clerk read the evidence given yesterday by Mr. Hare, the registrar, who stated, in reply to a question from the magistrate, that he had nothing to add to it. Mr. Lawson then proceeded to cross-examine the witness: \n \n \"\u0027You state that the register book was examined in your presence?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Was there any possibility of the signature being tampered with while you were by?\u0027--\u0027It could not possibly have been done in my presence.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Was M. Bordier left alone in the office with the book?\u0027--\u0027No.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027In point of fact, you did not lose sight of him during the whole of the visit?\u0027--\u0027I did not.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not even for a moment?\u0027--\u0027Not for one moment.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Then he could not have made the erasure or have written the name over it?\u0027--\u0027He could not.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You do not accuse him?\u0027--\u0027Of actually committing the offence, no. Of being an accessory, yes. He called me out of the office to give his accomplice time to do what he wished.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027We shall see. Only M. Julian Bordier could possibly have altered the entry?\u0027--\u0027Only him.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson (to the Magistrate): \u0027This proves that M. Bordier could not have made the erasure.\u0027--Magistrate: \u0027Exactly.\u0027 \n \n \"Cross-examination resumed: \u0027It is not important to the case, but are you familiar with the record of the marriage of Emilia Braham and Gerald Paget, or between her and any other person?\u0027--\u0027No, I never had occasion to refer to this particular entry.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Were M. Bordier and his son the only visitors you received on that day who wished to verify an entry in the register book?\u0027--\u0027The only visitors.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027After they left you did you leave your office?\u0027--\u0027For an hour in the evening.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Before you discovered that the entry had been tampered with?\u0027--\u0027Yes, before that.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Who was in charge of the premises while you were away?\u0027--\u0027The servant, Jane Seebold.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027When you made the discovery of the erasure, did you ask Jane Seebold if anyone had called in your absence?\u0027--\u0027I did not.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you at any time inform her that the book had been tampered with?\u0027--\u0027I did not.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You jumped at the conclusion that the gentlemen you accuse must be guilty?\u0027--\u0027There is no other conclusion.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That will do. Call Mr. Shepherd.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Shepherd stepped into the witness-box. \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027You are an expert in handwriting?\u0027--\u0027Witness: I am; it is my profession.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You have given evidence in many celebrated cases?\u0027--\u0027I have.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027Mr. Shepherd\u0027s name and reputation are well known.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Have you examined the entry of the marriage between Emilia Braham and Gerald Paget?\u0027--\u0027I have.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027There is an undoubted erasure of the signature of the bridegroom?\u0027--\u0027There is.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027The name, Gerald Paget, as it now appears, has been recently written?\u0027--\u0027Quite recently, within the past week. The state of the ink in which the name is freshly written proves it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You put a marked emphasis upon the words \"freshly written.\" Have you a reason for doing so?\u0027--\u0027I have. Upon a careful examination of the entry I am of the firm opinion that the name erased is the same as the name written above the erasure. The letters have been very cleverly traced.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027That sounds very strange.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027It does; but it is a puzzle that may be solved. Say that there is here a question of property which would fall to the Emilia Braham who is married according to this entry. To become possessed of this property, she must prove her marriage with Gerald Paget. Some one interested on the other side gets hold of the register book, and erases the name of Gerald Paget. What name shall be substituted in its place? What but that of Gerald Paget? This opens up the suggestion that a friend of Emilia Braham (speaking of her in her maiden name) has also paid a visit to the register, book, has erased the bridegroom\u0027s name, and written in its place that of Paget, to prove the said Emilia\u0027s marriage with him. A formidable suspicion is thrown upon her, and the very entry upon which she relies is weighty evidence against her.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027It is an ingenious theory, but I cannot see that it has any bearing upon the present case.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027It has an indirect bearing. I have here a copy of the marriage certificate, which I must ask you to compare with the entry in the register book. You will see in the copy that the name is Gerald Paget, and you cannot doubt that the copy is genuine.\" \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027There can be little doubt of that. The state of the paper is a proof.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027If the copy had been lost, it would have greatly strengthened those whose interests are opposed to Mrs. Paget\u0027s. I have nothing further to ask you, Mr. Shepherd. Call Jane Seebold.\u0027 \n \n \"Jane Seebold was shown into the witness-box. \n \n \"\u0027Your name is Jane Seebold?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You are in the service of Mr. Hare?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Do you remember the day before yesterday?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027In the evening Mr. Hare went out for an hour?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Was the office in which the official books are kept open?\u0027--\u0027Yes, it was, and I was sweeping it out.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did anybody call while you were so employed?\u0027--\u0027Yes, a gentleman.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did he inquire for any one?\u0027--\u0027Yes, my master.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well?\u0027--\u0027I told him he was out.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What did he say to that?\u0027--\u0027He said he would wait for him.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You allowed him to wait?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027In the office?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What did you do while he waited?\u0027--\u0027I had work in other parts of the house, and I went and did it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027For how long was the gentleman left alone in the office?\u0027--\u0027Half an hour, perhaps.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Then you went in to him?\u0027--\u0027Yes, and he said he was going, and he went.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you tell your master of the gentleman\u0027s visit when he returned?\u0027--\u0027No, I didn\u0027t.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Why didn\u0027t you?\u0027 The witness hesitated. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you? Remember that you are on your oath, and that if you prevaricate or speak falsely you may get yourself into serious trouble. Why did you not tell your master of the gentleman\u0027s visit?\u0027--\u0027Well, he gave me five shillings, and told me to say nothing about it. I don\u0027t see that I\u0027ve done any harm.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You can step down.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027Stop a moment. Where were the official books while the gentleman was in the office?\u0027--\u0027In their proper place--the desk.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027Was the desk locked?\u0027--\u0027The lock\u0027s been broke all the time I\u0027ve been in the place.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027So that all a person had to do to get hold of the books was to lift the lid?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027Your conduct was very reprehensible.\u0027 \n \n \"The witness then left the box. \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027We have brought the inquiry now to this point. Supposing the erasure to have been made on the day in question, the commission of the offence lies between M. Julian Bordier and the person who visited the registrar\u0027s office in his absence.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027Quite so. I think the registrar should keep these important public books in a more secure place--in an iron safe.\u0027 \n \n \"The Registrar: \u0027I am not supplied with one, your Worship, and I cannot afford to buy one. My servant\u0027s evidence comes upon me as a surprise.\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027I repeat what I said. These official records should be kept in safer custody. The authorities should provide proper receptacles for them.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027I shall proceed now to prove that it is an utter impossibility that M. Julian Bordier can be guilty of the offence with which he and his father are charged. Call Mr. Wordsworth.\u0027 \n \n \"This gentleman, whose name and fame are world-renowned, then gave his evidence, which was short, conclusive, and surprising. \n \n \"\u0027You are an oculist?\u0027--\u0027I am.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You are attending M. Julian Bordier?\u0027--\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Is that the gentleman?\u0027--\u0027That is the gentleman.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What are you attending him for?\u0027--\u0027For his sight.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Could he the day before yesterday have erased a name from the register book and written another name above it?\u0027--\u0027It is utterly impossible.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Why?\u0027--\u0027Because he was blind. He is blind now; His eyes are open, but he cannot see. It is against my express wish that he left London. If he does not return immediately and abide by my instructions, I shall despair of restoring his sight.\u0027 \n \n \"M. Bordier: \u0027May I say a word?\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027Certainly.\u0027 \n \n \"M. Bordier: \u0027I came to Glasserton to compare the copy of a marriage certificate with the original entry. My son\u0027s happiness hung upon this proof, and he insisted upon accompanying me. He would not be dissuaded, and although I feared there was a risk, I yielded to his wish. When we were arrested I endeavored to explain matters to the registrar and the officer, but they would not listen to me. Ignorant of the methods of English courts of justice, I thought it wisest to obtain counsel and assistance from London. That is all I have to say.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Lawson: \u0027Is it necessary, your worship, for me to address you?\u0027 \n \n \"The Magistrate: \u0027No. The gentlemen are discharged, and I regret that they have had to submit to this trial. I trust, Mr. Wordsworth, that you will be able to cure M. Julian Bordier.\u0027 \n \n \"Mr. Wordsworth: \u0027If he will be guided by me, I hope to restore his sight.\u0027 \n \n \"The parties then left the court.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48930.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
