{"id":43687,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. AT THE BOW STREET POLICE STATION.","content":"\"\u0027We have but little time for uninterrupted conversation,\u0027 said our reporter, still speaking in French, \u0027and must make the best of it. At the station we shall not be private, as we are now. An explanation is due from me first. I am, as you have heard, a properly qualified solicitor, and can therefore defend you legally, although at present I see little to defend. But the fact that I am your authorized legal adviser should strengthen your confidence in me, for whatever information of a secret nature I receive from you I am bound professionally to respect. You see, therefore, that your interests are safe in my hands.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I am truly grateful to you,\u0027 said the woman. \n \n \"\u0027Intended for the Law,\u0027 continued our reporter, \u0027I do not follow it as a profession. I am a journalist, engaged upon the Evening Moon. You start. The fact of my being so engaged should still further increase your confidence in me. Now, perhaps, you can understand why I am so much interested in the advertisement cut from our paper which you carry about with you. May I accept it that you have read what has been published in the Evening Moon concerning the death and strange disappearance of M. Felix?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I have read all that has appeared in the paper,\u0027 said the woman, who was paying the closest attention to what he was saying, \n \n \"\u0027Thank you for the frank admission. To my hands has been entrusted the task of clearing up this strange affair, and of bringing it forward to the full light of day. That is only a portion of my mission. I have taken it upon myself to so sift the matter to the bottom, that, if any innocent person has been wronged, his innocence shall be made clear, and also to punish the guilty. Where there is mystery there is generally crime, and where there is crime the presumption is that innocent beings have been brought to sorrow. Whether right Or wrong, I have the firmest conviction that there is some story of wrong-doing underlying this mystery, and if I am right--which time and good fortune can alone establish--this wrong-doing must have inflicted suffering upon innocent persons. In opening my mind to you upon these issues I may be, in your estimation, speaking at random of details of which you are ignorant, and indeed of details which exist only in my imagination, and have no foundation in fact; but I take the chance of that, believing that no harm can be done by a perfectly open confession of the motives which are urging me on in the elucidation of a mystery which has caused, and still is causing, a great deal of excitement. You will now understand why the discovery surprised me that you should have taken the trouble to so carefully preserve the advertisement which slipped from your pocket. It would scarcely have been done by one whom it did not in some way concern, and it remains to you to enlighten me upon this point. Let me assure you that the advertisement was inserted in good faith, and that its terms will be scrupulously observed. Legal assistance is offered, and will be given, and money will be spent if any good purpose can be served by it. That is all I have time to say in explanation of the interest, to you in all probability the singular interest, I have taken in our meeting to-night. The whole of this evening I have been engaged in following up a clew connected with the disappearance of the body of M. Felix, of which, as you read the Evening Moon, you are doubtless aware.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 said the woman, \u0027I have read of it.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I am on the track, and I venture to affirm that I shall eventually succeed in my purpose. I have already more than one ally. May I hope that I have gained another?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I do not know,\u0027 said the woman, and though they were walking now through unlighted spaces and he could not see her face, our reporter divined from her broken tones that she was crying. \u0027I cannot say. All is dark before me; there is not a star in the future to light me on my way.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Do not give up hope,\u0027 said our reporter. \u0027I am by your side to help you. You and your daughter, two women, alone in London as I understand, without a friend, can do very little, but an earnest, willing man, who has influence and means to back him up, may do much.\u0027 \n \n \"In his sincere sympathy our reporter pressed the woman\u0027s arm, and she uttered an exclamation of pain. \n \n \"Have I hurt you?\u0027 he asked, hurriedly. \n \n \"\u0027My arm has been injured,\u0027 replied the woman, biting her lip so that she should not repeat the cry; \u0027it has been cut to the bone.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I am very sorry. Is it your left arm?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Was it recently done?--but I beg your pardon for questioning you so closely.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You have the right to question me. It was done a few days ago.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You are unfortunate in more ways than one.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Truly, truly,\u0027 sighed the woman. \u0027Your voice, your words are kind, but I can think of nothing but my dear child. She is waiting for me, expecting me, listening for my footsteps on the stairs. If I could escape--if I could get away unseen!\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You must not dream of it; you would plunge yourself into deeper trouble; and my word is pledged.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, yes, I forgot; I am ungrateful.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I will do all I can for you at the Police Station; if it is possible, you shall in a few minutes go to your daughter; but I must not disguise from you the chances are very small.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027But you will try--you will try?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Yes, I will try; I will stand bail for you; I can do no more just now.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You have done much, more than I can repay. If they are cruel enough to detain me, how long shall I have to wait?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Till to-morrow morning. You will be brought up before a magistrate.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027It is a terrible disgrace, a terrible, terrible disgrace! But they cannot punish me if I have done nothing wrong?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027No, they cannot punish you unless they can prove something against you which will render you liable.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Can they upon suspicion?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Upon mere suspicion, no.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027When I appear before the magistrate, will you be there?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You may rely upon me. I shall be there to represent you legally, as I am willing now to assist you privately. We are near the station. Have you nothing more to say to me?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Did you tell me that I should be searched at the station, or is it only my fear?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027It is almost certain you will be searched.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They must find nothing upon me; they must not know who I am, or my daughter\u0027s happiness is wrecked.\u0027 \n \n \"Hastily and stealthily she extracted from her pocket a key, a purse and a handkerchief, and slipped them into his hands. As hastily and stealthily he slipped them into his own pocket. The policeman had not observed the proceeding. \n \n \"\u0027Will you not require you handkerchief?\u0027 asked our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027I must do without it. My initials are worked upon it, and it might lead to my identification. They must not, they must not know!\u0027 \n \n \"This remark would have seriously disturbed our reporter if he had not made up his mind to believe thoroughly, for the time being, everything the woman told him, and to leave it to the future to decide whether she was or was not deceiving him. \n \n \"\u0027Should I be detained,\u0027 said the woman, \u0027you will go to my daughter and assure her I am in no danger?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I will go with pleasure.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You will not wait till morning? You will go at once?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I will go straight from the station.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Heaven reward you! Believe a suffering, much-wronged woman, sir, your confidence is not misplaced.\u0027 \n \n \"They had not time to exchange another word; they were at the station door. \n \n \"The Inspector was within, taking the night charges, and our reporter saw with satisfaction that it was an officer with whom he was acquainted. \n \n \"\u0027Good-evening, Mr. Jealous,\u0027 he said. \n \n \"Inspector Jealous looked up. \u0027Hallo,\u0027 he said, \u0027what brings you here?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I come on behalf of this lady,\u0027 replied our reporter, \u0027against whom a policeman on duty on the Thames Embankment has a groundless charge to make.\u0027 \n \n \"The Inspector\u0027s eyes wandered from our reporter to the lady. The policeman came forward and laid his charge in a temperate manner. Inspector Jealous listened in silence. \n \n \"\u0027I thought at first,\u0027 said the policeman, \u0027that it was a child she had thrown into the river, but the gentleman here thinks the other way, and he is as likely to be right as I am. Of her attempt at suicide I am certain.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That is a distinct charge,\u0027 said Inspector Jealous, dipping his pen in the ink. \u0027The bundle, whatever it is, can, I dare say, be recovered.\u0027 He called a constable, and gave him some whispered instructions; after which the man left the office. \u0027You can join him presently on the Embankment. Do you know the woman?\u0027 Pinned to formula, Inspector Jealous ignored our reporter\u0027s reference to her as a lady. \n \n \"\u0027Look up,\u0027 said our reporter to the woman; \u0027you have nothing to be ashamed of.\u0027 \n \n \"Thus assured and comforted the woman raised her face, so that everyone in the office could see it clearly. Tears were hanging on her eyelids, and there was a piteous expression upon the trembling mouth. \n \n \"\u0027I don\u0027t know her,\u0027 said the policeman, honestly. \n \n \"The constables in the office craned their necks, then shook their heads. \n \n \"\u0027She\u0027s no better than she ought to be! She\u0027s no better than I am! I\u0027m as good as her any day of the week! Go to blazes, the lot of yer!\u0027 \n \n \"The interruption came from a tipsy woman sitting on a bench. Inspector Jealous made a slight motion with his head, and the tipsy creature was taken away. Then Inspector Jealous turned to our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027I have nothing to say against the constable making the charge,\u0027 said our reporter; \u0027he has performed his duty conscientiously, only he is mistaken. I was an eyewitness of the affair, and I say that there was nothing thrown in the river that the lady had not a right to throw into it--the property being her own--and that she did not attempt to commit suicide. Under these circumstances I trust you will not subject her to the indignity of being locked up. She will appear in the morning; I will be her recognizance.\u0027 \n \n \"Inspector Jealous nodded his head, and began to dissect. \n \n \"\u0027What was in the bundle?\u0027 he asked of our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027I have told you,\u0027 replied our reporter, feeling himself immediately at a disadvantage; \u0027her own property.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027What was its nature?\u0027 \n \n \"Manifestly this was a question which our reporter could not answer. \n \n \"\u0027You must excuse my asking,\u0027 said the Inspector, \u0027how you come to know it was her property?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027She told me as much.\u0027 \n \n \"This time, instead of nodding his head, Inspector Jealous shook it. \n \n \"\u0027I am afraid I cannot accept that. What is her name?\u0027 \n \n \"Another question which our reporter could not answer. \n \n \"\u0027Where does she live?\u0027 pursued the logical and inexorable Inspector. \n \n \"Our reporter felt the ground slipping from under him. These two or three simple questions were like sledge-hammer blows, and he was staggered. \n \n \"\u0027Surely,\u0027 he said, lamely parrying, \u0027you do not question my honesty in the matter?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Not for a moment,\u0027 said Inspector Jealous, with perfect good temper, \u0027but you must see yourself how it stands. Here is a direct charge made----\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027And denied,\u0027 interposed our reporter. \n \n \"\u0027Exactly,\u0027 assented Inspector Jealous; \u0027but it is usual, you know, to deny such charges, and the authority to decide which side is right is not vested in me. There is not only the charge of attempted suicide, but there is that bundle that was thrown into the river. I am very sorry, but----\u0027 \n \n \"He did not finish the sentence, but there was no misunderstanding his meaning. \n \n \"\u0027You must submit,\u0027 said our reporter to the woman, and then turned to Inspector Jealous. \u0027I may have a few private words with her, I suppose, out of hearing of the officers present?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Certainly,\u0027 replied Inspector Jealous, \u0027after I have entered the charge; and although I shall be compelled to detain her here, I promise to make her as comfortable as possible for the night.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Thank you,\u0027 said our reporter; \u0027I was about to ask you to do so.\u0027 \n \n \"Only one charge was entered in the book, that of attempted suicide, the constable\u0027s suspicions as to the bundle the woman threw into the river being deemed of too vague a nature to frame an accusation upon. \n \n \"\u0027Your name?\u0027 asked the Inspector of the woman. \n \n \"At this question she was seized with a sudden trembling; her white face grew whiter; her hands wandered feebly, aimlessly around, and had it not been for the support afforded her by our reporter, who held her up, she might have fallen insensible to the ground. \n \n \"\u0027Do not give way,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027think of your daughter.\u0027\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48891.html","bookId":1202,"book":{"id":1202,"title":"The Mystery of M.
