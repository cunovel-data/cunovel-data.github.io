{"id":6578,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and we never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho\u0027 not often, take my advice. \\n\\n We acted in concert to supply Braddock\u0027s army with provisions; and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail\u0027d with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by re-enforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess\u0027d to have, and I believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny. \\n\\n Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this new governor\u0027s administration, it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation. \\n\\n In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show\u0027d me some electric experiments. They were imperfectly perform\u0027d, as he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris\u0027d and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv\u0027d from Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquir\u0027d great readiness in performing those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders. \\n\\n To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish\u0027d themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang\u0027d in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur\u0027d an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form\u0027d by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro\u0027 the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick\u0027d up some money. In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air. \\n\\n Oblig\u0027d as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., I thought it right he should be inform\u0027d of our success in using it, and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments. He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions. One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers, however, being shown to Dr. othergill, he thought them of too much value to be stifled, and advis\u0027d the printing of them. Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentleman\u0027s Magazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrived afterward they swell\u0027d to a quarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money. \\n\\n It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard to translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abbe Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form\u0027d and publish\u0027d a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system. Afterwards, having been assur\u0027d that there really existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address\u0027d to me, defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of the positions deduc\u0027d from them. \\n\\n I once purpos\u0027d answering the abbe, and actually began the answer; but, on consideration that my writings contain\u0027d a description of experiments which any one might repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi\u0027d, could not be defended; or of observations offer\u0027d as conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages, might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of one another\u0027s meaning, much of one of the abbe\u0027s letters being founded on an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare from public business in making new experiments, than in disputing about those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and the doctrine it contain\u0027d was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abbe; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except Monsieur B----, of Paris, his eleve and immediate disciple. \\n\\n What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag\u0027d the public attention every where. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur\u0027d in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv\u0027d in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity. \\n\\n Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, on this, resum\u0027d the consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which be accompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me. Without my having made any application for that honor, they chose me a member, and voted that I should be excus\u0027d the customary payments, which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured. \\n\\n Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before-mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as was customary at that time, were engag\u0027d in drinking, he took me aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis\u0027d by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he begg\u0027d me to be assur\u0027d of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, of the proprietor\u0027s good disposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so long continu\u0027d to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor\u0027d between him and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc. The drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises. \\n\\n My answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures he propos\u0027d should appear to be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on every thing in my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamper\u0027d with. \\n\\n On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to do business with the Assembly, they appear\u0027d again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the penman, first, of the request to have a communication of the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward publish\u0027d. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem\u0027d one of the best political writers in England; had been employ\u0027d in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain\u0027d a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was thought as good as any man\u0027s. \\n\\n The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown, resolv\u0027d to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king\u0027s use (ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus\u0027d to pass, in compliance with his instructions. \\n\\n I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv\u0027d at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavor an accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that his majesty\u0027s service might not be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir\u0027d the governor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both sides. We met and discuss\u0027d the business. In behalf of the Assembly, I urg\u0027d all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions; the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey\u0027d, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly prevail\u0027d with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the king\u0027s troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos\u0027d to the enemy. \\n\\n I acquainted the House with what had pass\u0027d, and, presenting them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro\u0027 force, against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the governor pass\u0027d, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the meantime, the paquet had sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship\u0027s thanks for my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share. \\n\\n He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the paquet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His answer was, \"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer.\" By some accidental hinderance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship\u0027s character, of which indecision was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail\u0027d. There were then two of the paquet-boats, which had been long in port, but were detained for the general\u0027s letters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another paquet arriv\u0027d; she too was detain\u0027d; and, before we sail\u0027d, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch\u0027d, as having been there longest. Passengers were engag\u0027d in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods! but their anxiety avail\u0027d nothing; his lordship\u0027s letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly. \\n\\n Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a paquet from Governor Denny for the General. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion\u0027d my inquiring when he was to return, and where be lodg\u0027d, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order\u0027d to call to-morrow at nine for the general\u0027s answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. \"So, you are soon return\u0027d, Innis?\" \"Returned! no, I am not gone yet.\" \"How so?\" \"I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship\u0027s letter, and it is not yet ready.\" \"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? \\n\\n for I see him constantly at his escritoire.\" \"Yes,\" says Innis, \"but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on!\" This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what he was doing. \\n\\n This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig\u0027d to procure more. \\n\\n At length the fleet sail\u0027d, the General and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg, with intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the paquet-boats in company ordered to attend the General\u0027s ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two paquets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then alter\u0027d his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and return\u0027d to New York, with all his troops, together with the two paquets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation. \\n\\n I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those paquets. He told me that, when he had been detain\u0027d a month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a paquetboat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. He answer\u0027d, three days. The general replied, \"If you can do it in one day, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow.\" So he never obtain\u0027d leave, though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months. \\n\\n I saw also in London one of Bonnell\u0027s passengers, who was so enrag\u0027d against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he would sue for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable. \\n\\n On the whole, I wonder\u0027d much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho\u0027 Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos\u0027d while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang\u0027d all our mercantile operations, and distress\u0027d our trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain\u0027d by the enemy, but in reality for beating down their price in favor of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain\u0027d near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home. \\n\\n Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the command. Shirley, tho\u0027 thereby superseded, was present also. There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by him, I said, \"They have given you, sir, too low a seat.\" \"No matter,\" says he, \"Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.\" While I was, as afore mention\u0027d, detain\u0027d at New York, I receiv\u0027d all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish\u0027d to Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain\u0027d from the different persons I had employ\u0027d to assist in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance. He caus\u0027d them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis\u0027d to give me an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and, tho\u0027 I call\u0027d often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. \"And you,\" says he, \"when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately.\" \\n\\n I mention\u0027d, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had been put to by being detain\u0027d so long at New York, as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I had advanc\u0027d, as I charged no commission for my service, \"0, sir,\" says he, \"you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets.\" I assur\u0027d him that was not my case, and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear\u0027d clearly not to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments. As to my ballance, I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/41/188.html","bookId":212,"book":{"id":212,"title":"The Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin富兰克林自传","description":"简介： The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs.
