{"id":6576,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Our city, tho\u0027 laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large, strait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav\u0027d, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough\u0027d them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv\u0027d near what was call\u0027d the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav\u0027d with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. \n By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav\u0027d with stone between the market and the brick\u0027d foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav\u0027d, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover\u0027d with mire, which was not remov\u0027d, the city as yet having no scavengers. \n After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours\u0027 doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain\u0027d by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people\u0027s feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign\u0027d, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this rais\u0027d a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose. \n After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone.and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress\u0027d with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib\u0027d to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply\u0027d with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg\u0027d on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu\u0027d bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repair\u0027d. \n I have sometimes wonder\u0027d that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us\u0027d at Vauxhall have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro\u0027 them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated. \n The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos\u0027d, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ\u0027d that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away; but it was suffer\u0027d to accumulate till wet weather reduc\u0027d it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labour rak\u0027d together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of which suffer\u0027d some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses. \n An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street, one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask\u0027d who employ\u0027d her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and hopes they will give me something.\" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o\u0027clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac\u0027d in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash\u0027d it quite away, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean. \n I then judg\u0027d that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as follows: \n \"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak\u0027d up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that they be furnish\u0027d with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service. \n \"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry it all away. \n \"That the mud, when rak\u0027d up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac\u0027d high upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover\u0027d with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac\u0027d at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they remaining where plac\u0027d till the mud is drain\u0027d, and then horses brought to draw them away.\" \n I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry\u0027d away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro\u0027 the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o\u0027clock, I observ\u0027d there was not one shop open, tho\u0027 it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow. \n Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho\u0027 dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produc\u0027d not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America. \n Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid any thing to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac\u0027d by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv\u0027d from it-- not one farthing! \n The business of the postoffice occasion\u0027d my taking a journey this year to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They were conferr\u0027d in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy. \n In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv\u0027d this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv\u0027d the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho\u0027 they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June. \n In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general purposes. As we pass\u0027d thro\u0027 New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation, I ventur\u0027d to lay it before the Congress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners had form\u0027d plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be established, which pass\u0027d in the affirmative unanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen\u0027d to be preferr\u0027d, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported. \n By this plan the general government was to be administered by a president-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in England it was judg\u0027d to have too much of the democratic. \n The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form\u0027d, supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed. \n Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of states and princes. \n Look round the habitable world, how few Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue! \n Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc\u0027d by the occasion. \n The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly, express\u0027d his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention.\" The House, however, by the management of a certain member, took it up when I happen\u0027d to be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification. \n In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv\u0027d there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir\u0027d with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign\u0027d. Mr. Morris ask\u0027d me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, \"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.\" \"My dear friend,\" says he, pleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them.\" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston. \n In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which it appear\u0027d that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retain\u0027d the government. I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur\u0027d a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion\u0027d by the contest, and we often din\u0027d together. \n One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street. \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir\u0027d the idea of Sancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these damn\u0027d Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give you a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked them enough.\" He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wip\u0027d off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and plac\u0027d it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir\u0027d of the contest, and quitted the government. \n These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this injustice, tho\u0027 constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris\u0027s successor, ventured to disobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter. \n But I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some transactions to be mention\u0027d that happened during the administration of Governor Morris. \n War being in a manner commenced with France, the government of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy\u0027s countryman, he appli\u0027d to me for my influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well receiv\u0027d. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho\u0027 very desirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate. \n I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos\u0027d that the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos\u0027d the provisions might easily be purchas\u0027d. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain\u0027d instant credit, and were not only receiv\u0027d in payment for the provisions, but many money\u0027d people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair was by my means compleated. My Quincy return\u0027d thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas\u0027d with the success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship. \n The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos\u0027d at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain\u0027d of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march\u0027d to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish\u0027d me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they propos\u0027d to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey. \n We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro\u0027 the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din\u0027d with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear\u0027d that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were surpris\u0027d, declar\u0027d the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim\u0027d against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/41/186.html","bookId":212,"book":{"id":212,"title":"The Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin富兰克林自传","description":"简介： The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs.
