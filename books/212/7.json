{"id":6571,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow\u0027d him, but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment, crav\u0027d his forbearance a little longer, which he allow\u0027d me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected. \\n\\n But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least reason to expect. Mr. Meredith\u0027s father, who was to have paid for our printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su\u0027d us all. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais\u0027d in time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price. \\n\\n In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our discredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain\u0027d of the Merediths\u0027 fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail\u0027d in their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv\u0027d, I should then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends. \\n\\n Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner, \"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business.\" \"No,\" said he, \"my father has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a business I am not fit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade. Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin\u0027d to go with them, and follow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If you will take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership, and leave the whole in your hands.\" I agreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in writing, sign\u0027d, and seal\u0027d immediately. I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing the best account that had been given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick. \\n\\n As soon as he was gone, I recurr\u0027d to my two friends; and because I would not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of what each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off the company\u0027s debts, and went on with the business in my own name, advertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in or about the year 1729. \\n\\n About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money, only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soon to be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants oppos\u0027d any addition, being against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors. We had discuss\u0027d this point in our Junto, where I was on the side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses inhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well, that when I first walk\u0027d about the streets of Philadelphia, eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between Second and Front streets, with bills on their doors, \"To be let\"; and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another. \\n\\n Our debates possess\u0027d me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled \"The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency.\" It was well receiv\u0027d by the common people in general; but the rich men dislik\u0027d it, for it increas\u0027d and strengthen\u0027d the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition slacken\u0027d, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My friends there, who conceiv\u0027d I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable jobb and a great help to me. This was another advantage gain\u0027d by my being able to write. \\n\\n The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident as never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, till I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful. \\n\\n I soon after obtain\u0027d, thro\u0027 my friend Hamilton, the printing of the Newcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it; small things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and these, to me, were really great advantages, as they were great encouragements. He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and votes of that government, which continu\u0027d in my hands as long as I follow\u0027d the business. \\n\\n I now open\u0027d a little stationer\u0027s shop. I had in it blanks of all sorts, the correctest that ever appear\u0027d among us, being assisted in that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment, chapmen\u0027s books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and work\u0027d with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose. \\n\\n I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the printing-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I drest plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion. I never went out a fishing or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch\u0027d me from my work, but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas\u0027d at the stores thro\u0027 the streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus being esteem\u0027d an industrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly. In the mean time, Keimer\u0027s credit and business declining daily, he was at last forc\u0027d to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors. He went to Barbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances. \\n\\n His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work\u0027d with him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials. I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good deal of interest. I therefore propos\u0027d a partnership to him which he, fortunately for me, rejected with scorn. He was very proud, dress\u0027d like a gentleman, liv\u0027d expensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him. There this apprentice employ\u0027d his former master as a journeyman; they quarrel\u0027d often; Harry went continually behindhand, and at length was forc\u0027d to sell his types and return to his country work in Pensilvania. The person that bought them employ\u0027d Keimer to use them, but in a few years he died. \\n\\n There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business. However, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for, tho\u0027 I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion\u0027d some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it. \\n\\n I had hitherto continu\u0027d to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for his glazier\u0027s business, tho\u0027 he worked little, being always absorbed in his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a relation\u0027s daughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a serious courtship on my part ensu\u0027d, the girl being in herself very deserving. The old folks encourag\u0027d me by continual invitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to explain. Mrs. Godfrey manag\u0027d our little treaty. I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then above a hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been inform\u0027d the printing business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up. \\n\\n Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas\u0027d, I know not; but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family. This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ\u0027d, and they removed, leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates. \\n\\n But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look\u0027d round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found that, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable. In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way, which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which of all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it. A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read\u0027s family, who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I piti\u0027d poor Miss Read\u0027s unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho\u0027 the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. Our mutual affection was revived, but there were now great objections to our union. The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov\u0027d, because of the distance; and, tho\u0027 there was a report of his death, it was not certain. Then, tho\u0027 it should be true, he had left many debts, which his successor might be call\u0027d upon to pay. We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took her to wife, September 1st, 1730. \\n\\n None of the inconveniences happened that we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate, assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have ever mutually endeavored to make each other happy. Thus I corrected that great erratum as well as I could. \\n\\n About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little room of Mr. Grace\u0027s, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made by me, that, since our books were often referr\u0027d to in our disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik\u0027d to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole. It was lik\u0027d and agreed to, and we fill\u0027d one end of the room with such books as we could best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho\u0027 they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated, and each took his books home again \\n\\n And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a subscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to continue. We afterwards obtain\u0027d a charter, the company being increased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing. These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges. \\n\\n Memo. Thus far was written with the intention express\u0027d in the beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importance to others. What follows was written many years after in compliance with the advice contain\u0027d in these letters, and accordingly intended for the public. The affairs of the Revolution occasion\u0027d the interruption. \\n\\n \"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it. Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben. Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions? The influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend\u0027s journals. It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist. Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be! I know of no character living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth. Not that I think the work would have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\" \\n\\n The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a friend, I received from him the following: \\n\\n Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan. \"PARIS, January 31, 1783. \\n\\n \"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will have considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted in these. It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight. The nearest thing to having experience of one\u0027s own, is to have other people\u0027s affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life? \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/41/181.html","bookId":212,"book":{"id":212,"title":"The Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin富兰克林自传","description":"简介： The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs.
