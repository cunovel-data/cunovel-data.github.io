{"id":6570,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"The \"Journal\" was printed by Sparks, from a copy made at Reading in 1787. But it does not contain the Plan. --Ed. We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry alterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major Gordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem\u0027d a little asham\u0027d at seeing me, but pass\u0027d without saying anything. I should have been as much asham\u0027d at seeing Miss Read, had not her friends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and soon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name, it being now said that he bad another wife. He was a worthless fellow, tho\u0027 an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He got into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply\u0027d with stationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho\u0027 none good, and seem\u0027d to have a great deal of business. \n Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open\u0027d our goods; I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a little time, expert at selling. \n We lodg\u0027d and, boarded together; he counsell\u0027d me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected and lov\u0027d him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass\u0027d my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his executors, and my employment under him ended. \n My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wages by the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that he might better attend his stationer\u0027s shop. I had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her friends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri\u0027d for farther employment as a merchant\u0027s clerk; but, not readily meeting with any, I clos\u0027d again with Keimer. I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he had agreed with at extream low wages per week, to be rais\u0027d a shilling every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor t\u0027other. John ----, a wild Irishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was to be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice. \n I soon perceiv\u0027d that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been us\u0027d to give, was, to have these raw, cheap hands form\u0027d thro\u0027 me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better. \n It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish\u0027d among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited plays; belong\u0027d to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not well satisfi\u0027d, wishing of all things to see London, and become a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk\u0027d out of town, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of being introduc\u0027d among the players, grew necessitous, pawn\u0027d his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp\u0027s bill was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. \n John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something daily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer\u0027s Sabbath, so I had two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist. He, however, kindly made no demand of it. \n Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder in America; I had seen types cast at James\u0027s in London, but without much attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made use of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the matrices in lead, And thus supply\u0027d in a pretty tolerable way all eficiencies. \n I also engrav\u0027d several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a factotum. \n But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became every day of less importance, as the other hands improv\u0027d in the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter\u0027s wages, he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master, frequently found fault, was captious, and seem\u0027d ready for an outbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience, thinking that his encumber\u0027d circumstances were partly the cause. At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening near the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was the matter. Keimer, being in the street, look\u0027d up and saw me, call\u0027d out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding some reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity, all the neighbors who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the printing-house, continu\u0027d the quarrel, high words pass\u0027d on both sides, he gave me the quarter\u0027s warning we had stipulated, expressing a wish that he had not been oblig\u0027d to so long a warning. I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my hat, walk\u0027d out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings. \n Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over. He had conceiv\u0027d a great regard for me, and was very unwilling that I should leave the house while he remain\u0027d in it. He dissuaded me from returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess\u0027d; that his creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold often without profit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse that had pass\u0027d between them, he was sure would advance money to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. \"My time,\" says he, \"will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time we may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally.\" \n The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and approv\u0027d of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his son, had prevail\u0027d on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop\u0027d might break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who carry\u0027d it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so remain\u0027d idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ\u0027d to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return. Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return\u0027d, and we went on more smoothly than for some time before. The New jersey jobb was obtain\u0027d, I contriv\u0027d a copperplate press for it, the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for the bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water. \n At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the province. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a friend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv\u0027d by reading than Keimer\u0027s, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation seem\u0027d to he more valu\u0027d. \n They had me to their houses, introduced me to their friends, and show\u0027d me much civility; while he, tho\u0027 the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv\u0027d opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a little knavish withal. \n We continu\u0027d there near three months; and by that time I could reckon among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general. The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for himself, when young, by wheeling clay for the brick-makers, learned to write after be was of age, carri\u0027d the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir\u0027d a good estate; and says he, \"I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.\" He had not then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere. These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was to some of them. They all continued their regard for me as long as they lived. \n Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and morals, that you may see how far those influenc\u0027d the future events of my life. My parents had early given me religious impressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle\u0027s Lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards wrong\u0027d me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith\u0027s conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho\u0027 it might be true, was not very useful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines of Dryden: \n \"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man Sees but a part o\u0027 the chain, the nearest link: His eyes not carrying to the equal beam, That poises all above;\" and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing, appear\u0027d now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv\u0027d into my argument, so as to infect all that follow\u0027d, as is common in metaphysical reasonings. \n I grew convinc\u0027d that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I form\u0027d written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation had indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain\u0027d an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them, yet probably these actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favorable circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro\u0027 this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because the instances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it properly, and determin\u0027d to preserve it. \n We had not been long return\u0027d to Philadelphia before the new types arriv\u0027d from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the market, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-four pounds a year, tho\u0027 I have since known it to let for seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them. We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order, before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure, and this countryman\u0027s five shillings, being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young beginners. \n There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking. \n I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, I had form\u0027d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss\u0027d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties. \n The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the scriveners, a good-natur\u0027d, friendly, middle-ag\u0027d man, a great lover of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of sensible conversation. \n Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley\u0027s Quadrant. But he knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal precision in everything said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us. \n Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov\u0027d books, and sometimes made a few verses. \n William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir\u0027d a considerable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it. He also became surveyor-general. \n William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid, sensible man. \n Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz\u0027d before. \n Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and witty; a lover of punning and of his friends. \n And William Coleman, then a merchant\u0027s clerk, about my age, who had the coolest, dearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of almost any man I ever met with. He became afterwards a merchant of great note, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continued without interruption to his death, upward of forty years; and the club continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of conversation, every thing being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of hereafter. \n But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending business to us. Breintnal particularly procur\u0027d us from the Quakers the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by Keimer; and upon this we work\u0027d exceedingly hard, for the price was low. It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes. I compos\u0027d of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished my distribution for the next day\u0027s work, for the little jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But so determin\u0027d I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when, having impos\u0027d my forms, I thought my day\u0027s work over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to pi, I immediately distributed and compos\u0027d it over again before I went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to give us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention being made of the new printing-office at the merchants\u0027 Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew\u0027s in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: \"For the industry of that Franklin,\" says he, \"is superior to any thing I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.\" This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business. \n I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely, tho\u0027 it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation. \n George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a journeyman to us. We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag\u0027d, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ\u0027d. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford\u0027s paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY, which Breintnal continu\u0027d some months. By this means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer\u0027s proposals, which we burlesqu\u0027d and ridicul\u0027d, were disregarded. He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it prov\u0027d in a few years extremely profitable to me. \n I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our partnership still continu\u0027d; the reason may be that, in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me. Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make the best of it. \n Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people, occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk\u0027d of, and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/41/180.html","bookId":212,"book":{"id":212,"title":"The Autobiography Of Benjamin Franklin富兰克林自传","description":"简介： The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs.
