{"id":4671,"no":3,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 3","content":"THE autumn and winter passed uneventfully. Arthur was reading hard and had little spare time. He contrived to get a glimpse of Montanelli once or oftener in every week, if only for a few minutes. From time to time he would come in to ask for help with some difficult book; but on these occasions the subject of study was strictly adhered to. Montanelli, feeling, rather than observing, the slight, impalpable barrier that had come between them, shrank from everything which might seem like an attempt to retain the old close relationship. Arthur\u0027s visits now caused him more distress than pleasure, so trying was the constant effort to appear at ease and to behave as if nothing were altered. Arthur, for his part, noticed, hardly understanding it, the subtle change in the Padre\u0027s manner; and, vaguely feeling that it had some connection with the vexed question of the \"new ideas,\" avoided all mention of the subject with which his thoughts were constantly filled. Yet he had never loved Montanelli so deeply as now. The dim, persistent sense of dissatisfaction, of spiritual emptiness, which he had tried so hard to stifle under a load of theology and ritual, had vanished into nothing at the touch of Young Italy. All the unhealthy fancies born of loneliness and sick-room watching had passed away, and the doubts against which he used to pray had gone without the need of exorcism. With the awakening of a new enthusiasm, a clearer, fresher religious ideal (for it was more in this light than in that of a political development that the students\u0027 movement had appeared to him), had come a sense of rest and completeness, of peace on earth and good will towards men; and in this mood of solemn and tender exaltation all the world seemed to him full of light. He found a new element of something lovable in the persons whom he had most disliked; and Montanelli, who for five years had been his ideal hero, was now in his eyes surrounded with an additional halo, as a potential prophet of the new faith. He listened with passionate eagerness to the Padre\u0027s sermons, trying to find in them some trace of inner kinship with the republican ideal; and pored over the Gospels, rejoicing in the democratic tendencies of Christianity at its origin.\\n\\n One day in January he called at the seminary to return a book which he had borrowed. Hearing that the Father Director was out, he went up to Montanelli\u0027s private study, placed the volume on its shelf, and was about to leave the room when the title of a book lying on the table caught his eyes. It was Dante\u0027s \"De Monarchia.\" He began to read it and soon became so absorbed that when the door opened and shut he did not hear. He was aroused from his preoccupation by Montanelli\u0027s voice behind him.\\n\\n \"I did not expect you to-day,\" said the Padre, glancing at the title of the book. \"I was just going to send and ask if you could come to me this evening.\"\\n\\n \"Is it anything important? I have an engagement for this evening; but I will miss it if------\"\\n\\n \"No; to-morrow will do. I want to see you because I am going away on Tuesday. I have been sent for to Rome.\"\\n\\n \"To Rome? For long?\"\\n\\n \"The letter says, \u0027till after Easter.\u0027 It is from the Vatican. I would have let you know at once, but have been very busy settling up things about the seminary and making arrangements for the new Director.\"\\n\\n \"But, Padre, surely you are not giving up the seminary?\"\\n\\n \"It will have to be so; but I shall probably come back to Pisa, for some time at least.\"\\n\\n \"But why are you giving it up?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it is not yet officially announced; but I am offered a bishopric.\"\\n\\n \"Padre! Where?\"\\n\\n \"That is the point about which I have to go to Rome. It is not yet decided whether I am to take a see in the Apennines, or to remain here as Suffragan.\"\\n\\n \"And is the new Director chosen yet?\"\\n\\n \"Father Cardi has been nominated and arrives here to-morrow.\"\\n\\n \"Is not that rather sudden?\"\\n\\n \"Yes; but----The decisions of the Vatican are sometimes not communicated till the last moment.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know the new Director?\"\\n\\n \"Not personally; but he is very highly spoken of. Monsignor Belloni, who writes, says that he is a man of great erudition.\"\\n\\n \"The seminary will miss you terribly.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about the seminary, but I am sure you will miss me, carino; perhaps almost as much as I shall miss you.\"\\n\\n \"I shall indeed; but I am very glad, for all that.\"\\n\\n \"Are you? I don\u0027t know that I am.\" He sat down at the table with a weary look on his face; not the look of a man who is expecting high promotion.\\n\\n \"Are you busy this afternoon, Arthur?\" he said after a moment. \"If not, I wish you would stay with me for a while, as you can\u0027t come to-night. I am a little out of sorts, I think; and I want to see as much of you as possible before leaving.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I can stay a bit. I am due at six.\"\\n\\n \"One of your meetings?\"\\n\\n Arthur nodded; and Montanelli changed the subject hastily.\\n\\n \"I want to speak to you about yourself,\" he said. \"You will need another confessor in my absence.\"\\n\\n \"When you come back I may go on confessing to you, may I not?\"\\n\\n \"My dear boy, how can you ask? Of course I am speaking only of the three or four months that I shall be away. Will you go to one of the Fathers of Santa Caterina?\"\\n\\n \"Very well.\"\\n\\n They talked of other matters for a little while; then Arthur rose.\\n\\n \"I must go, Padre; the students will be waiting for me.\"\\n\\n The haggard look came back to Montanelli\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Already? You had almost charmed away my black mood. Well, good-bye.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye. I will be sure to come to-morrow.\"\\n\\n \"Try to come early, so that I may have time to see you alone. Father Cardi will be here. Arthur, my dear boy, be careful while I am gone; don\u0027t be led into doing anything rash, at least before I come back. You cannot think how anxious I feel about leaving you.\"\\n\\n \"There is no need, Padre; everything is quite quiet. It will be a long time yet.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye,\" Montanelli said abruptly, and sat down to his writing.\\n\\n The first person upon whom Arthur\u0027s eyes fell, as he entered the room where the students\u0027 little gatherings were held, was his old playmate, Dr. Warren\u0027s daughter. She was sitting in a corner by the window, listening with an absorbed and earnest face to what one of the \"initiators,\" a tall young Lombard in a threadbare coat, was saying to her. During the last few months she had changed and developed greatly, and now looked a grown-up young woman, though the dense black plaits still hung down her back in school-girl fashion. She was dressed all in black, and had thrown a black scarf over her head, as the room was cold and draughty. At her breast was a spray of cypress, the emblem of Young Italy. The initiator was passionately describing to her the misery of the Calabrian peasantry; and she sat listening silently, her chin resting on one hand and her eyes on the ground. To Arthur she seemed a melancholy vision of Liberty mourning for the lost Republic. (Julia would have seen in her only an overgrown hoyden, with a sallow complexion, an irregular nose, and an old stuff frock that was too short for her.)\\n\\n \"You here, Jim!\" he said, coming up to her when the initiator had been called to the other end of the room. \"Jim\" was a childish corruption of her curious baptismal name: Jennifer. Her Italian schoolmates called her \"Gemma.\"\\n\\n She raised her head with a start.\\n\\n \"Arthur! Oh, I didn\u0027t know you--belonged here!\"\\n\\n \"And I had no idea about you. Jim, since when have you----?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand!\" she interposed quickly. \"I am not a member. It is only that I have done one or two little things. You see, I met Bini--you know Carlo Bini?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course.\" Bini was the organizer of the Leghorn branch; and all Young Italy knew him.\\n\\n \"Well, he began talking to me about these things; and I asked him to let me go to a students\u0027 meeting. The other day he wrote to me to Florence------Didn\u0027t you know I had been to Florence for the Christmas holidays?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t often hear from home now.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes! Anyhow, I went to stay with the Wrights.\" (The Wrights were old schoolfellows of hers who had moved to Florence.) \"Then Bini wrote and told me to pass through Pisa to-day on my way home, so that I could come here. Ah! they\u0027re going to begin.\"\\n\\n The lecture was upon the ideal Republic and the duty of the young to fit themselves for it. The lecturer\u0027s comprehension of his subject was somewhat vague; but Arthur listened with devout admiration. His mind at this period was curiously uncritical; when he accepted a moral ideal he swallowed it whole without stopping to think whether it was quite digestible. When the lecture and the long discussion which followed it were finished and the students began to disperse, he went up to Gemma, who was still sitting in the corner of the room.\\n\\n \"Let me walk with you, Jim. Where are you staying?\"\\n\\n \"With Marietta.\"\\n\\n \"Your father\u0027s old housekeeper?\"\\n\\n \"Yes; she lives a good way from here.\"\\n\\n They walked for some time in silence. Then Arthur said suddenly:\\n\\n \"You are seventeen, now, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I was seventeen in October.\"\\n\\n \"I always knew you would not grow up like other girls and begin wanting to go to balls and all that sort of thing. Jim, dear, I have so often wondered whether you would ever come to be one of us.\"\\n\\n \"So have I.\"\\n\\n \"You said you had done things for Bini; I didn\u0027t know you even knew him.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t for Bini; it was for the other one\"\\n\\n \"Which other one?\"\\n\\n \"The one that was talking to me to-night-- Bolla.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know him well?\" Arthur put in with a little touch of jealousy. Bolla was a sore subject with him; there had been a rivalry between them about some work which the committee of Young Italy had finally intrusted to Bolla, declaring Arthur too young and inexperienced.\\n\\n \"I know him pretty well; and I like him very much. He has been staying in Leghorn.\"\\n\\n \"I know; he went there in November------\"\\n\\n \"Because of the steamers. Arthur, don\u0027t you think your house would be safer than ours for that work? Nobody would suspect a rich shipping family like yours; and you know everyone at the docks----\"\\n\\n \"Hush! not so loud, dear! So it was in your house the books from Marseilles were hidden?\"\\n\\n \"Only for one day. Oh! perhaps I oughtn\u0027t to have told you.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? You know I belong to the society. Gemma, dear, there is nothing in all the world that would make me so happy as for you to join us-- you and the Padre.\"\\n\\n \"Your Padre! Surely he----\"\\n\\n \"No; he thinks differently. But I have sometimes fancied--that is--hoped--I don\u0027t know----\"\\n\\n \"But, Arthur! he\u0027s a priest.\"\\n\\n \"What of that? There are priests in the society --two of them write in the paper. And why not? It is the mission of the priesthood to lead the world to higher ideals and aims, and what else does the society try to do? It is, after all, more a religious and moral question than a political one. If people are fit to be free and responsible citizens, no one can keep them enslaved.\"\\n\\n Gemma knit her brows. \"It seems to me, Arthur,\" she said, \"that there\u0027s a muddle somewhere in your logic. A priest teaches religious doctrine. I don\u0027t see what that has to do with getting rid of the Austrians.\"\\n\\n \"A priest is a teacher of Christianity, and the greatest of all revolutionists was Christ.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know, I was talking about priests to father the other day, and he said----\"\\n\\n \"Gemma, your father is a Protestant.\"\\n\\n After a little pause she looked round at him frankly.\\n\\n \"Look here, we had better leave this subject alone. You are always intolerant when you talk about Protestants.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to be intolerant. But I think Protestants are generally intolerant when they talk about priests.\"\\n\\n \"I dare say. Anyhow, we have so often quarreled over this subject that it is not worth while to begin again. What did you think of the lecture?\"\\n\\n \"I liked it very much--especially the last part. I was glad he spoke so strongly about the need of living the Republic, not dreaming of it. It is as Christ said: \u0027The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"It was just that part that I didn\u0027t like. He talked so much of the wonderful things we ought to think and feel and be, but he never told us practically what we ought to do.\"\\n\\n \"When the time of crisis comes there will be plenty for us to do; but we must be patient; these great changes are not made in a day.\"\\n\\n \"The longer a thing is to take doing, the more reason to begin at once. You talk about being fit for freedom--did you ever know anyone so fit for it as your mother? Wasn\u0027t she the most perfectly angelic woman you ever saw? And what use was all her goodness? She was a slave till the day she died--bullied and worried and insulted by your brother James and his wife. It would have been much better for her if she had not been so sweet and patient; they would never have treated her so. That\u0027s just the way with Italy; it\u0027s not patience that\u0027s wanted--it\u0027s for somebody to get up and defend themselves------\"\\n\\n \"Jim, dear, if anger and passion could have saved Italy she would have been free long ago; it is not hatred that she needs, it is love.\"\\n\\n As he said the word a sudden flush went up to his forehead and died out again. Gemma did not see it; she was looking straight before her with knitted brows and set mouth.\\n\\n \"You think I am wrong, Arthur,\" she said after a pause; \"but I am right, and you will grow to see it some day. This is the house. Will you come in?\"\\n\\n \"No; it\u0027s late. Good-night, dear!\"\\n\\n He was standing on the doorstep, clasping her hand in both of his.\\n\\n \"For God and the people----\"\\n\\n Slowly and gravely she completed the unfinished motto:\\n\\n \"Now and forever.\"\\n\\n Then she pulled away her hand and ran into the house. When the door had closed behind her he stooped and picked up the spray of cypress which had fallen from her breast.\\n\\n 秋冬两季平淡无奇地过去了。亚瑟读书很用功，没有多少空闲的时间。他设法每个星期去看望蒙泰尼里一两次，哪怕只有几分钟的时间。他时不时地会带上一本晦涩难懂的书，让他帮着解疑答惑。但是在这些场合，他们只是切实谈论学习上的事情。与其说蒙泰尼里观察到了，倒不如说他感觉到了一道难以琢磨的小小障碍横在他们中间，所以他一举一动都很谨慎，不让自己显得像是尽量保持过去那种亲密的关系。\\n\\n 亚瑟的来访现在给他带来的不安要大于愉快，所以老是装出若无其事、显得一切都没有改变的样子是件痛苦的事情。亚瑟也发现到了Padre的举止有了微妙的变化，但是不大明白个中的缘由。他隐约地觉得这与恼人的“新思潮”问题有关，所以他避免提到这个话题，尽管他满脑子都是这些东西。可是他从来都没有像现在这样深爱着蒙泰尼里。从前他在朦胧之间老是有一种难以满足的感觉，而且觉得精神空虚，他一直是在神学理论和宗教仪式的重压下努力抑制这些感觉。但在接触到青年意大利党后，这些感觉全都烟消云散。因为孤独和照料病人而产生的所有那些不健康的幻想已经无影无踪，曾经求助于祈祷的疑惑也已消失，用不着驱邪祓魔。随着一种新的激情觉醒以后，一种更加清晰、更加崭新的宗教理想（因为他是从这个方面而非从政治发展来看待学生运动的，所以他更是如此）已经成了一种恬适充实的感觉，体现了世界和平、四海之内皆兄弟的理念。在这种庄重温和的欢快气氛之下，他认为全世界都充满了光明。他在他最喜欢的那些人身上发现了某种可爱的因素。五年以来，他一直把蒙泰尼里当作理想中的英雄。在他的眼里，蒙泰尼里现在又增添了新的光环，就像是那种新信仰的一个潜在先知。他怀着满腔的热情聆听Padre的布道，试图在他的话中捕捉到与新共和理想的某种内在关系。他还潜心钻研《福音书》，庆幸基督教在起源时就具备了民主的倾向。\\n\\n 一月里的一天，他来到神学院归还一本索借的书。听说院长神父出去以后，他径直走进蒙泰尼里的书房，把那本书放在书架上，然后准备离开房间。这时搁在桌上的一本书引起了他的注意。这是但丁的《帝制论》。他开始阅读这本书，并且很快地入了迷，连房门打开和关上的声音都没有听见。直到蒙泰尼里在他背后说话，他才醒悟过来。\\n\\n “我没有料到你今天会来。”Padre说道，并且拿眼看了一下那本书。“我准备派人去问你今天晚上能否来一下。”\\n\\n “有什么要紧的事吗？我今晚有个约会，可是我可以不去，如果——”\\n\\n “没什么要紧的，明天来也行。我想见你一面，因为星期二我就要走了。我已经应召去罗马了。”\\n\\n “去罗马？要去多长时间？”\\n\\n “信上说‘直到复活节以后’。信是梵蒂冈发来的。我本想立即就告诉你的，但是一直忙着处理神学院的事情，并且安排迎接新院长。”\\n\\n “可是，Padre，您当然不会放弃神学院吧？”\\n\\n “只能如此。但是我可能回到比萨，至少待上一段时间。”\\n\\n “可是您为什么要放弃这个地方呢？”\\n\\n “呃，现在还没有正式宣布，但是已经任命我为主教。”\\n\\n “Padre！在什么地方？”\\n\\n “就是为了这件事情，我才一定要去罗马一趟。究竟到亚平宁山区升任主教，还是留在这里担任副主教，现在还没有作出决定。”\\n\\n “已经选定了新院长了吗？”\\n\\n “卡尔迪神父已被任命为院长，他明天就会到达这里。”\\n\\n “是不是有点突然？”\\n\\n “是的，但是——梵蒂冈的决定有时要到最后才会公布。”\\n\\n “您认识新院长吗？”\\n\\n “没有见过面，但是他的口碑极佳。勤于笔耕的贝洛尼神父说他是一位学识渊博的人。”\\n\\n “神学院里的人会非常想念您的。”\\n\\n “神学院的事我不知道，但是我相信你会想念我的，亲爱的。你也许会像我想念你那样想念我。”\\n\\n “我肯定会想念您的。但是尽管如此我还是非常高兴。”\\n\\n “是吗？我不知道我是什么样的心境。”他坐在桌边，脸上露出倦容，看上去不像是一个就要升任高职的人。\\n\\n “亚瑟，你今天下午忙吗？”过了片刻他说道，“如果不忙的话，我希望你能陪我一会儿，因为你今天晚上不能过来。我看我是有些不大舒服。在我离开之前，我想尽量地多看你几眼。”\\n\\n “行啊，我可以待上一会儿。他们六点钟等我。”\\n\\n “去参加一个会吗？”\\n\\n 亚瑟点点头，然后蒙泰尼里匆忙换了一个话题。\\n\\n “我想和你谈谈你自己的事。”他说，“在我不在的时候，你需要另外一位忏悔神父。”\\n\\n “在您回来的时候，我可以继续向您忏悔，难道这样不行吗？”\\n\\n “我亲爱的孩子，你怎么能这样说话呢？当然我只是说我不在的三四个月内。你去找圣特琳娜教堂的一位神父好吗？”\\n\\n “很好。”\\n\\n 他们又谈了一会儿别的事情，然后亚瑟站起身来。\\n\\n “我该走了，Padre。那些学生会等我的。”\\n\\n 蒙泰尼里的脸上又露出憔悴的表情。\\n\\n “时间到了吗？你几乎已使我郁闷的心情好起来。呃，再见吧。”\\n\\n “再见。我明天肯定会来的。”\\n\\n “尽量早点来，那样的话我也许能有时间单独见你。卡尔迪神父会来这里。亚瑟，我的孩子，我不在的时候小心一点。不要受人误导做出轻率的事来，至少在我回来之前。你想象不出离开你，我是多么不放心啊。”\\n\\n “没有这个必要，Padre。一切都很平静。事情还远着呢。”\\n\\n “再见。”蒙泰尼里脱口说道，然后坐在桌旁拿笔写了起来。\\n\\n 当亚瑟走进学生们举行小型集会的房间时，他看到的第一个人是他孩童时的伙伴，华伦医生的女儿。她坐在靠窗的一角，聚精会神地听着一位发起人对她讲话。那是一个身材高大的伦巴第人，身上穿着一件破旧的外套。近几个月她有了变化，发育得很快，现在看上去已像是一位成熟的年轻女性，尽管粗黑的辫子还垂在背后，仍旧是一位女学生的打扮。\\n\\n 她浑身上下都是一袭黑衣，头上裹着一条黑色的围巾，因为屋里冷风飕飕。她的胸前插着一串柏枝，这是青年意大利党的党徽。那位发起人热情洋溢，正对她描绘卡拉布里亚农民的苦难。她静静地听着，一只手托着下巴，眼睛看着地上。在亚瑟看来，她仿佛就是黯然神伤的自由女神，正在哀悼毁于一旦的共和国。（朱丽亚会认为她只是一个发育过快的野女孩，肤色蜡黄，鼻子长得又不规则，而且所穿的那件旧布衣料做的连衣裙又太短了。）\\n\\n “吉姆，你也在这儿！”他说。在那位发起人被叫到房间另一头去的时候，他朝她走了过去。她在受洗礼时取了詹妮弗这个奇怪的名字，结果给小孩子们叫走了样，成了“吉姆”。她的意大利同学叫她“琼玛”。\\n\\n 她吃了一惊，抬起头来。\\n\\n “亚瑟！噢，我不知道你——你也属于这个地方！”\\n\\n “可我也不知道你的情况啊。吉姆，你是什么时候——”\\n\\n “你不明白的！”她马上插嘴说道。“我并不是这里的成员。只是我做过一两件小事。你知道，我结识了毕尼——你知道卡洛·毕尼吗？”\\n\\n “当然知道。”毕尼是里窝那支部的组织人，青年意大利党全都知道他。\\n\\n “呃，他先和我谈起这些事情，然后我就请他带我参加了一次学生会议。那天他写信给我，要我到佛罗伦萨去——你知道我在佛罗伦萨过的圣诞节吗？”\\n\\n “我现在不常接到家里的信。”\\n\\n “噢，对了！反正去的时候，我住在赖特姐妹的家里。（赖特姐妹是她的同学，她们搬到佛罗伦萨去了。）然后毕尼写信告诉我，让我回家时在今天路过比萨，这样我就到了这里。啊！他们开始了。”\\n\\n 演讲的内容是有关理想共和国，以及为了实现这个共和国青年人应该担负什么责任。那位演讲人对这个题目理解得并不深刻，但是亚瑟怀着虔诚的敬意认真听着。在这个时期，他的大脑非常缺乏批判能力。在接受一个道德理想时，他就吞下所有的东西，没有去想是否消化得了。演讲结束以后进行了长时间的讨论，完了学生开始散去。他走到琼玛那里，琼玛仍然坐在屋子的那一角。\\n\\n “让我来送你吧，吉姆。你住在什么地方？”\\n\\n “我和玛丽塔住在一起。”\\n\\n “你父亲的老管家？”\\n\\n “对，她住的地方离这儿挺远。”\\n\\n 他们默不做声地走了一段时间。然后亚瑟突然开口说话：“你现在已经十七岁了吧？”\\n\\n “十月份我就满十七岁了。”\\n\\n “以前我就知道，你长大以后不会像其他的女孩一样，光是想着参加舞会，以及那些东西。吉姆，亲爱的，我心里常想你会不会成为我们中间的一员。”\\n\\n “我也常这么想。”\\n\\n “你说过曾为毕尼做过事情，我以前并不知道你认识他。”\\n\\n “不是为毕尼做事，是为另外一个人做事。”\\n\\n “另外一个人？”\\n\\n “就是今晚和我说话的那个——波拉。”\\n\\n “你和他很熟吗？”亚瑟的话中有一丝妒意。谈起波拉他就不高兴，他们之间曾经争着去做某件事情，但是青年意大利党委员会最终还是让波拉去了，而且竟然还说亚瑟太年轻，没有经验。\\n\\n “我和他挺熟，我很喜欢他。他一直住在里窝那。”\\n\\n “我知道，他是十一月去的——”\\n\\n “就是有关轮船的事情。亚瑟，你不认为进行这项工作，你家要比我家更安全吗？没有人会怀疑像你们那样一个经营船运的富家，而且你几乎认识码头上的每一个人——”\\n\\n “嘘！亲爱的，别那么大声嚷嚷！这么说从马赛运来的书籍就藏在你的家里？”\\n\\n “只藏一天。噢！也许我不应该告诉你。”\\n\\n “为什么呢？你知道我是这个组织中的人。琼玛，亲爱的，世界上没有什么能比你们参加到我们中来更让人高兴，我是说你和Padre。”\\n\\n “你的Padre！他当然——”\\n\\n “不，他的看法不同。可我有时幻想——也就是我希望——我不知道——”\\n\\n “亚瑟，他可是一位教士啊！”\\n\\n “这又怎么样？我们这个组织里就有教士——有两位还在报上发表过文章呢。为什么不行呢？教士的使命就是引导世界实现更高的理想和目标，我们这个组织还想做些什么？归根到底，这不单是一个政治问题，更是一个宗教和道德问题。如果人们都配享受自由，都配成为尽责的公民，那么谁都不能奴役他们。”\\n\\n 琼玛皱起了眉头。“在我看来，亚瑟，”她说道，“你的逻辑有些紊乱。一个教士传授宗教的教义，我看不出这与赶走奥地利人有什么关系。”\\n\\n “教士传授的是基督教的教义，在所有的革命家当中，最伟大的是基督。”\\n\\n “你知道吗，那天我对父亲谈起教士，他说——”\\n\\n “琼玛，你的父亲是一位新教徒。”\\n\\n 停顿片刻以后，她率直地打量着他。\\n\\n “听着，我们最好不要谈起这个话题。一谈到新教徒，你总是带有偏见。”\\n\\n “我不是带有偏见。但我认为谈起了教士，新教徒一般都带有偏见。”\\n\\n “大概是吧。反正我们谈及这个话题时，我们经常争执不休，所以不值得再提起这个话题。你认为演讲怎么样？”\\n\\n “我非常喜欢——特别是最后一部分。使我感到高兴的是，他强调了实现共和国的必要性，而不是梦想其成。就像基督所说的那样：‘天国就在你的心中。’”\\n\\n “就是这个部分我不喜欢。有关我们应该思考、感知和实现的美好事物，他谈得太多了。但是从头至尾，他基本上没有告诉我们应该做些什么。”\\n\\n “到了紧要关头，我们会有许多事情要做。但是我们必须耐心等待，天翻地覆的变化不是一蹴而就的。”\\n\\n “实现一件事情的时间越长，那就更有理由立即动手去做。你谈到了配享受自由——你还知道有谁比你的母亲更配享受自由吗？难道她不是你见过的最完美的天使般的女性吗？\\n\\n 可她所有的那些美德又有什么用呢？直到她死的那一天，她都是一个奴隶——受尽了你的哥哥杰姆斯和他妻子的欺凌、骚扰和侮辱。如果她不是那样的温柔和耐心，她的境况就会好得多。意大利的情况也就是如此。需要的并不是耐心——得有人挺身而出，保卫他们自己——”\\n\\n “吉姆，亲爱的，如果愤怒和激情能够挽救意大利，她早就得到了自由。她需要的并不是仇恨，她需要的是爱。”\\n\\n 在他说出这个字时，他的前额突然露出了赧色，但是随即又消失了。琼玛并没有看出来，她正皱着眉头，抿着嘴直视前方。\\n\\n “你认为我错了，亚瑟，”她停顿了片刻说道，“但是我是对的，总有一天你会明白这个道理的。就是这家。你进来吗？”\\n\\n “不啦，时候不早了。晚安，亲爱的！”\\n\\n 他站在门口，双手紧握着她的手。\\n\\n “为了上帝和人民——”\\n\\n 她缓慢而又庄重地说完那句没有说完的誓言：“始终不渝。”［青年意大利党的口号是“为了上帝和人民，始终不渝”。］琼玛抽回了她的手，然后跑进了屋子。当她随手关上门时，他弯腰拾起从她胸前落下的那串柏枝。\\n\\n \\n\\n
