{"id":4691,"no":23,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 5","content":"FOR a week the Gadfly lay in a fearful state. The attack was a violent one, and the Governor, rendered brutal by fear and perplexity, had not only chained him hand and foot, but had insisted on his being bound to his pallet with leather straps, drawn so tight that he could not move without their cutting into the flesh. He endured everything with his dogged, bitter stoicism till the end of the sixth day. Then his pride broke down, and he piteously entreated the prison doctor for a dose of opium. The doctor was quite willing to give it; but the Governor, hearing of the request, sharply forbade \"any such foolery.\" \"How do you know what he wants it for?\" he said. \"It\u0027s just as likely as not that he\u0027s shamming all the time and wants to drug the sentinel, or some such devilry. Rivarez is cunning enough for anything.\" \"My giving him a dose would hardly help him to drug the sentinel,\" replied the doctor, unable to suppress a smile. \"And as for shamming-- there\u0027s not much fear of that. He is as likely as not to die.\" \"Anyway, I won\u0027t have it given. If a man wants to be tenderly treated, he should behave accordingly. He has thoroughly deserved a little sharp discipline. Perhaps it will be a lesson to him not to play tricks with the window-bars again.\" \"The law does not admit of torture, though,\" the doctor ventured to say; \"and this is coming perilously near it.\" \"The law says nothing about opium, I think,\" said the Governor snappishly. \"It is for you to decide, of course, colonel; but I hope you will let the straps be taken off at any rate. They are a needless aggravation of his misery. There\u0027s no fear of his escaping now. He couldn\u0027t stand if you let him go free.\" \"My good sir, a doctor may make a mistake like other people, I suppose. I have got him safe strapped now, and he\u0027s going to stop so.\" \"At least, then, have the straps a little loosened. It is downright barbarity to keep them drawn so tight.\" \"They will stop exactly as they are; and I will thank you, sir, not to talk about barbarity to me. If I do a thing, I have a reason for it.\" So the seventh night passed without any relief, and the soldier stationed on guard at the cell door crossed himself, shuddering, over and over again, as he listened all night long to heart-rending moans. The Gadfly\u0027s endurance was failing him at last. At six in the morning the sentinel, just before going off duty, unlocked the door softly and entered the cell. He knew that he was committing a serious breach of discipline, but could not bear to go away without offering the consolation of a friendly word. He found the Gadfly lying still, with closed eyes and parted lips. He stood silent for a moment; then stooped down and asked: \"Can I do anything for you, sir? I have only a minute.\" The Gadfly opened his eyes. \"Let me alone!\" he moaned. \"Let me alone----\" He was asleep almost before the soldier had slipped back to his post. Ten days afterwards the Governor called again at the palace, but found that the Cardinal had gone to visit a sick man at Pieve d\u0027Ottavo, and was not expected home till the afternoon. That evening, just as he was sitting down to dinner, his servant came in to announce: \"His Eminence would like to speak to you.\" The Governor, with a hasty glance into the looking glass, to make sure that his uniform was in order, put on his most dignified air, and went into the reception room, where Montanelli was sitting, beating his hand gently on the arm of the chair and looking out of the window with an anxious line between his brows. \"I heard that you called to-day,\" he said, cutting short the Governor\u0027s polite speeches with a slightly imperious manner which he never adopted in speaking to the country folk. \"It was probably on the business about which I have been wishing to speak to you.\" \"It was about Rivarez, Your Eminence.\" \"So I supposed. I have been thinking the matter over these last few days. But before we go into that, I should like to hear whether you have anything new to tell me.\" The Governor pulled his moustaches with an embarrassed air. \"The fact is, I came to know whether Your Eminence had anything to tell me. If you still have an objection to the course I proposed taking, I should be sincerely glad of your advice in the matter; for, honestly, I don\u0027t know what to do.\" \"Is there any new difficulty?\" \"Only that next Thursday is the 3d of June, --Corpus Domini,--and somehow or other the matter must be settled before then.\" \"Thursday is Corpus Domini, certainly; but why must it be settled especially before then?\" \"I am exceedingly sorry, Your Eminence, if I seem to oppose you, but I can\u0027t undertake to be responsible for the peace of the town if Rivarez is not got rid of before then. All the roughest set in the hills collects here for that day, as Your Eminence knows, and it is more than probable that they may attempt to break open the fortress gates and take him out. They won\u0027t succeed; I\u0027ll take care of that, if I have to sweep them from the gates with powder and shot. But we are very likely to have something of that kind before the day is over. Here in the Romagna there is bad blood in the people, and when once they get out their knives----\" \"I think with a little care we can prevent matters going as far as knives. I have always found the people of this district easy to get on with, if they are reasonably treated. Of course, if you once begin to threaten or coerce a Romagnol he becomes unmanageable. But have you any reason for supposing a new rescue scheme is intended?\" \"I heard, both this morning and yesterday, from confidential agents of mine, that a great many rumours are circulating all over the district and that the people are evidently up to some mischief or other. But one can\u0027t find out the details; if one could it would be easier to take precautions. And for my part, after the fright we had the other day, I prefer to be on the safe side. With such a cunning fox as Rivarez one can\u0027t be too careful.\" \"The last I heard about Rivarez was that he was too ill to move or speak. Is he recovering, then?\" \"He seems much better now, Your Eminence. He certainly has been very ill--unless he was shamming all the time.\" \"Have you any reason for supposing that likely?\" \"Well, the doctor seems convinced that it was all genuine; but it\u0027s a very mysterious kind of illness. Any way, he is recovering, and more intractable than ever.\" \"What has he done now?\" \"There\u0027s not much he can do, fortunately,\" the Governor answered, smiling as he remembered the straps. \"But his behaviour is something indescribable. Yesterday morning I went into the cell to ask him a few questions; he is not well enough yet to come to me for interrogation--and indeed, I thought it best not to run any risk of the people seeing him until he recovers. Such absurd stories always get about at once.\" \"So you went there to interrogate him?\" \"Yes, Your Eminence. I hoped he would be more amenable to reason now.\" Montanelli looked him over deliberately, almost as if he had been inspecting a new and disagreeable animal. Fortunately, however, the Governor was fingering his sword-belt, and did not see the look. He went on placidly: \"I have not subjected him to any particular severities, but I have been obliged to be rather strict with him--especially as it is a military prison--and I thought that perhaps a little indulgence might have a good effect. I offered to relax the discipline considerably if he would behave in a reasonable manner; and how does Your Eminence suppose he answered me? He lay looking at me a minute, like a wolf in a cage, and then said quite softly: \u0027Colonel, I can\u0027t get up and strangle you; but my teeth are pretty good; you had better take your throat a little further off.\u0027 He is as savage as a wild-cat.\" \"I am not surprised to hear it,\" Montanelli answered quietly. \"But I came to ask you a question. Do you honestly believe that the presence of Rivarez in the prison here constitutes a serious danger to the peace of the district?\" \"Most certainly I do, Your Eminence.\" \"You think that, to prevent the risk of bloodshed, it is absolutely necessary that he should somehow be got rid of before Corpus Domini?\" \"I can only repeat that if he is here on Thursday, I do not expect the festival to pass over without a fight, and I think it likely to be a serious one.\" \"And you think that if he were not here there would be no such danger?\" \"In that case, there would either be no disturbance at all, or at most a little shouting and stone-throwing. If Your Eminence can find some way of getting rid of him, I will undertake that the peace shall be kept. Otherwise, I expect most serious trouble. I am convinced that a new rescue plot is on hand, and Thursday is the day when we may expect the attempt. Now, if on that very morning they suddenly find that he is not in the fortress at all, their plan fails of itself, and they have no occasion to begin fighting. But if we have to repulse them, and the daggers once get drawn among such throngs of people, we are likely to have the place burnt down before nightfall.\" \"Then why do you not send him in to Ravenna?\" \"Heaven knows, Your Eminence, I should be thankful to do it! But how am I to prevent the people rescuing him on the way? I have not soldiers enough to resist an armed attack; and all these mountaineers have got knives or flint-locks or some such thing.\" \"You still persist, then, in wishing for a court-martial, and in asking my consent to it?\" \"Pardon me, Your Eminence; I ask you only one thing--to help me prevent riots and bloodshed. I am quite willing to admit that the military commissions, such as that of Colonel Freddi, were sometimes unnecessarily severe, and irritated instead of subduing the people; but I think that in this case a court-martial would be a wise measure and in the long run a merciful one. It would prevent a riot, which in itself would be a terrible disaster, and which very likely might cause a return of the military commissions His Holiness has abolished.\" The Governor finished his little speech with much solemnity, and waited for the Cardinal\u0027s answer. It was a long time coming; and when it came was startlingly unexpected. \"Colonel Ferrari, do you believe in God?\" \"Your Eminence!\" the colonel gasped in a voice full of exclamation-stops. \"Do you believe in God?\" Montanelli repeated, rising and looking down at him with steady, searching eyes. The colonel rose too. \"Your Eminence, I am a Christian man, and have never yet been refused absolution.\" Montanelli lifted the cross from his breast. \"Then swear on the cross of the Redeemer Who died for you, that you have been speaking the truth to me.\" The colonel stood still and gazed at it blankly. He could not quite make up his mind which was mad, he or the Cardinal. \"You have asked me,\" Montanelli went on, \"to give my consent to a man\u0027s death. Kiss the cross, if you dare, and tell me that you believe there is no other way to prevent greater bloodshed. And remember that if you tell me a lie you are imperilling your immortal soul.\" After a little pause, the Governor bent down and put the cross to his lips. \"I believe it,\" he said. Montanelli turned slowly away. \"I will give you a definite answer to-morrow. But first I must see Rivarez and speak to him alone.\" \"Your Eminence--if I might suggest--I am sure you will regret it. For that matter, he sent me a message yesterday, by the guard, asking to see Your Eminence; but I took no notice of it, because----\" \"Took no notice!\" Montanelli repeated. \"A man in such circumstances sent you a message, and you took no notice of it?\" \"I am sorry if Your Eminence is displeased. I did not wish to trouble you over a mere impertinence like that; I know Rivarez well enough by now to feel sure that he only wanted to insult you. And, indeed, if you will allow me to say so, it would be most imprudent to go near him alone; he is really dangerous--so much so, in fact, that I have thought it necessary to use some physical restraint of a mild kind------\" \"And you really think there is much danger to be apprehended from one sick and unarmed man, who is under physical restraint of a mild kind?\" Montanelli spoke quite gently, but the colonel felt the sting of his quiet contempt, and flushed under it resentfully. \"Your Eminence will do as you think best,\" he said in his stiffest manner. \"I only wished to spare you the pain of hearing this man\u0027s awful blasphemies.\" \"Which do you think the more grievous misfortune for a Christian man; to hear a blasphemous word uttered, or to abandon a fellow-creature in extremity?\" The Governor stood erect and stiff, with his official face, like a face of wood. He was deeply offended at Montanelli\u0027s treatment of him, and showed it by unusual ceremoniousness. \"At what time does Your Eminence wish to visit the prisoner?\" he asked. \"I will go to him at once.\" \"As Your Eminence pleases. If you will kindly wait a few moments, I will send someone to prepare him.\" The Governor had come down from his official pedestal in a great hurry. He did not want Montanelli to see the straps. \"Thank you; I would rather see him as he is, without preparation. I will go straight up to the fortress. Good-evening, colonel; you may expect my answer to-morrow morning.\" 整整一个星期，牛虻的病都处于严重的状态。这次病情发作来势凶猛。统领由于害怕和困惑而变得残暴，不仅给他戴上了手铐脚镣，而且坚持用皮带把他紧紧地绑在地铺上。所以他一动弹，皮带就嵌进皮肉里。凭着顽强而又坚定的禁欲主义精神，他忍受了一切，然而到了第六天晚上，他的自尊垮了下来。他可怜巴巴地请求狱医给他一剂鸦片。医生十分愿意给他，但是统领听到这个请求以后，严厉禁止“任何愚蠢的行径”。 “你怎么知道他要它做什么？”他说。“可能他一直是在无病呻吟，可能他想用它麻醉哨兵，或者干出诸如此类的坏事。里瓦雷兹狡猾得很，什么事都能做得出来。” “我给他一剂鸦片根本就不能帮助他麻醉哨兵。”医生回答，忍不住笑起来。“至于无病呻吟——这倒不用担心。他可能快死了。” “反正我不许给他。如果想要别人待他好一些，那么他就应该表现得好一些。他理应受到一点严厉的管制。也许对他来说是个教训，再也不要玩弄窗户栏杆那套把戏。” “可是法律并不允许动用酷刑，”医生斗胆说道，“这就近乎动用酷刑了。” “我认为法律并没有提到鸦片。”统领厉声说道。 “这当然该你来决定，上校，但我还是希望你让他们取下皮带。没有必要加重他的痛苦。现在不用害怕他逃跑，即使你把他放走，他也站不起来。” “我的好好先生，我想医生也许会像别人一样犯下错误。我现在就要把他牢牢地绑在那里，他就得这样。” “至少，还是把皮带松一下吧。把他绑得那么紧，那也太野蛮了。” “就这么绑。谢谢你，先生，你就不要对我谈论野蛮了。如果我做了什么，那我是有理由的。” 第七个夜晚就这样过去了，没有采取止痛的措施。牢房门外站岗的士兵整夜都听到撕心裂肺的呻吟，他连连画着十字，浑身一阵阵地颤抖。牛虻再也忍受不住了。 早晨六点，就在下岗之前，哨兵打开了牢门，轻轻地走了进去。他知道他正在严重违反纪律，但是走前不去友好地说上一句安慰的话，他实在于心不忍。 他发现牛虻静静地躺在那里，闭着眼睛，张着嘴巴。他默默地站了一会儿，然后弯腰问道：“先生，我能为你做些什么吗？我只有一分钟的时间。” 牛虻睁开了眼睛。“别管我！”他呻吟道，“别管我——” 在那名士兵溜回到岗位之前，他就已睡着了。 十天以后，统领再次造访宫殿，但他发现红衣主教去了彼埃维迪奥塔沃，为了看望一位病人，要到下午才能回来。当天傍晚，在他坐下来准备吃饭时，他的仆人进来通报：“主教阁下希望同您谈话。” 统领匆忙照了一下镜子，看看军服穿得是否齐整。他端起了最为庄重的架子，然后走进了接待室。蒙泰尼里坐在那里，轻轻地敲着椅子的扶手，紧锁眉头望着窗外。 “我听说你今天找过我。”他打断了统领的客套话，态度有些傲慢。他在和农民说话时从不这样。“可能就是我所希望和你交谈的事情。” “有关里瓦雷兹，主教阁下。” “这我已经想到了。过去几天我一直都在考虑这件事。但是在我们谈起这事之前，我愿意听听你有没有什么新的消息告诉我。” 统领有些尴尬，用手捋了下胡须。 “事实上我去您那里，是想了解一下主教阁下有什么话要对我说。如果您仍然反对我的提议，我将会十分乐意接受您的指示。因为说句实话，我也不知道应该怎么办。” “出现了新的困难吗？” “只是下个星期四就是６月３日——迎圣体节——不管怎样，在此之前都要解决这个问题。” “星期四是迎圣体节，不错。但是为什么必须在此之前解决呢？” “如果我似乎违背了您的意志，主教阁下，我将万分抱歉。但是如果在此之前不把里瓦雷兹除掉，本城的治安我就无法负责。所有的山野粗民那天都会聚集到这里，主教阁下，这您也知道。他们十有八九可能企图打开城堡的大门，把他劫持出去。他们不会成功的，我会采取措施加以防范，就是使用火药和子弹把他们从大门赶走，我也在所不惜。那天极有可能发生这种事情。罗马尼阿这里尽是凶悍强暴的刁民，他们一旦拔出刀子——” “我认为只要小心一点，我们就可以防止事态扩大，不至于拔出刀子来。我一向发现这个地区的人们很好相处，只要合理地对待他们。当然了，如果你开始威胁或者要挟一个罗马尼阿人，他就变得无法无天。但是你有什么理由怀疑他们将会劫狱呢？” “今天早晨和昨天，我从我的心腹特工那里听说这个地区谣言四起，显然有人正在图谋不轨。但是没有查出详细的情况。如果能够查出来，防范就会容易一些。就我而言，经历了那天的惊吓，我宁愿求稳。面对里瓦雷兹这样一只狡猾的狐狸，我们大意不得。” “上次我听说里瓦雷兹病得既不能动弹也不能说话。那么他恢复了没有？” “他现在好像好多了，主教阁下。他当然病得很重——除非他一直是在无病呻吟。” “你有什么理由这样怀疑吗？” “呃，医生似乎相信他是真的病了，但是病得非常蹊跷。反正他是在恢复，而且更加桀骜不驯。” “他现在干了什么？” “幸运的是他什么也干不了。”统领回答。想起了皮带，他禁不住微微一笑。“但是他的举止有点说不清楚。昨天早晨，我去牢里问他几个问题。他的身体还没有好转，不能前来接受我的审问——的确，我认为在他身体复原之前，最好还是不让别人看见他，免得节外生枝。那样的话，马上就会传出荒谬的谣言。” “这么说你去那里审问了他？” “是，主教阁下。我曾希望现在他比较通情达理。” 蒙泰尼里审慎地看着他，几乎像在查验一只未曾见过而又令人生厌的新动物。所幸统领正在玩弄他的腰刀，没有看见这种目光。他若无其事地接着说道：“我并没有对他施用任何特别的酷刑，但是我被迫对他严加管束——特别是因为那是一座军事监狱——我曾以为稍微宽容一点也许有些效果。我提出放宽管束的尺度，如果他能理智一些。主教阁下猜猜他是怎么回答我的？他躺在那里看了我一会儿，就像一只关在笼子里的恶狼，然后他非常和气地说：‘上校，我起不来，无法把你掐死。但是我的牙齿还挺厉害，你最好把你的喉咙搁远一点。’他就像一只野猫一样凶狠。” “听到这话我并不觉得惊讶，”蒙泰尼里平静地回答，“但是我到这里是想问你一个问题。你真的相信里瓦雷兹留在狱中，对这个地区的治安构成了严重的威胁吗？” “我确信如此，主教阁下。” “你认为如要防止流血，在迎圣体节之前就得除掉里瓦雷兹吗？” “我只能再三重申，如果星期四他还在的话，我坚信节日当天会有一场战斗，而且我认为那将是一场激烈的战斗。” “如果他不在这里的话，那就不会有这样的危险？” “这样的话，要不就是风平浪静，要不至多就是喊上几声，扔扔石头而已。如果主教阁下能够找到一个除掉他的办法，我会确保治安。否则，我估计会出大的乱子。我相信他们正在密谋新的劫狱计划，星期四就是他们动手的日子。现在，如果那天早晨他们突然发现他并不在城堡，他们的计划就会自行宣告失败，他们没有机会发起战斗。但是如果我们非得挫败他们，等到他们在人群中拔出刀子，我们可能在天黑之前就得焚毁那个地方。” “那么你为什么不把他押送到拉文纳去呢？” “天知道，主教阁下，能那样做的话我就该谢天谢地！但是我怎么才能防止他们在途中把他劫走呢？我没有足够的士兵抵挡武装袭击，那些山民全都带着刀子和明火枪，以及诸如此类的东西。” “那你仍然坚持希望建立军事法庭，并且请求我予以同意吗？” “请您原谅，主教阁下，我只请求您一件事——帮助我防止骚乱和流血，我十分愿意承认军事委员会，如像费雷迪上校的军事委员会，有时过于严厉，非但没有抑制民众，反而激怒了民众。但我认为在这个案子上，设立军事法庭将是一步明智的举措，而且极有可能恢复圣父已经废除的军事委员会。” 统领结束了简短的讲演，神情煞是庄重。他等着红衣主教的答复。对方良久没有作声，等到他开口说话时，他的答复却又出乎意料。 “费拉里上校，你相信上帝吗？” “主教阁下！”上校瞠目结舌。 “你相信上帝吗？”蒙泰尼里重复了一遍，起身俯视着他，目光平静而又咄咄逼人。上校也站了起来。 “主教阁下，我是个基督徒，从来没被拒绝过赦罪。” 蒙泰尼里举起胸前的十字架。 “救世主为你而死，你就对着他的十字架发誓，你跟我说的话全是真话。” 上校站着不动，茫然地凝视着十字架。他实在弄不清楚，到底是他疯了，还是红衣主教疯了。 “你已经请求我同意把一个人处死，”蒙泰尼里接着说道，“如果你敢，你就亲吻十字架，并且告诉我你相信没有别的办法防止更多的人流血。记住，如果你跟我撒谎，你就在危及你那不朽的灵魂。” 沉默片刻之后，统领俯下身去，把十字架贴到唇上。 “我相信这一点。”他说。 蒙泰尼里缓慢地转身走开。 “明天我会给你一个明确的答复。但是我必须先见见里瓦雷兹，单独和他谈谈。” “主教阁下——如果您能听我一句话——我相信您会为此感到后悔的。他昨天通过看守给我捎了一个口信，请求面见主教阁下。但是我没有理会，因为——” “没有理会！”蒙泰尼里重复了一遍。“一个人身陷这种处境，他给你捎了一个口信，而你竟然没有理会？” “如果主教阁下深感不悦，那我非常抱歉。我不希望为了这样一件无礼的小事打扰您，我现在非常了解里瓦雷兹，他只想侮辱您。如果蒙您准许，要我说的话，单独接近他可是非常莽撞的。他真的很危险——因此，事实上我一直认为有必要使用某种温和的身体约束——” “你真的认为一个手无寸铁的病人，置于温和的身体约束之下，会有很大的危险吗？”蒙泰尼里说道，语气十分和气。 但是上校觉出了他那平静的轻蔑，气得脸涨得通红。 “主教阁下愿怎么做就怎么做吧。”他说，态度很生硬，“我只是希望不想让您听到那个家伙说出恶毒的亵渎言词。” “你认为对于一个基督徒来说，什么才是更加悲哀的不幸：听人说出一个亵渎的单词，还是放弃一个处于困境的同类？” 统领挺直身体站在那里，脸上官气十足，就像是用木头雕成。蒙泰尼里的态度使他非常气愤，于是他显得格外的客套，借此表现他的气愤。 “主教阁下希望什么时间探视犯人？”他问。 “我立即就去找他。” “悉听主教阁下尊便。如果您能等上几分钟，我会派人让他准备一下。” 统领匆忙离开他的座位。他不想让蒙泰尼里看见皮带。 “谢谢，我情愿看到他现在是副什么模样，不用准备了。我径直前去城堡。晚安，上校。你明天就会得到我的答复。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/310/3020.html","bookId":163,"book":{"id":163,"title":"牛虻 The Gadfly","description":"简介： The Gadfly is a novel by Ethel Lilian Voynich, published in 1897 (United States, June; Great Britain, September of the same year), set in 1840s Italy under the dominance of Austria, a time of tumultuous revolt and uprisings.
