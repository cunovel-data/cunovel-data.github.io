{"id":34692,"no":14,"title":"XIV POSTMARKS","content":"Between church service and Sunday School we of the First church have so many things to attend to that no one can spare a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Reverent things, not secular,\" Calliope explains, \"plannin\u0027 for church chicken-pie suppers an\u0027 Christmas bazaars and like that; but not a word about a picnic, not even if they was to be one o\u0027 Monday sunrise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To be sure, this habit of ours occasionally causes a contretemps. As when one morning Mis\u0027 Toplady arrived late and, in a flurry, essayed to send up to the pulpit by the sexton a Missionary meeting notice to be read. Into this notice the minister plunged without the precaution of first examining it, and so delivered aloud:— \\n\\n \"See Mis\u0027 Sykes about bringing wiping cloths and dish-rags. \\n\\n \"See Abigail about enough forks for her table. \\n\\n \"Look around for my rubbers. \\n\\n \"Dun Mame Holcomb for her twenty cents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 224] \\n\\n \\n\\n Not until he reached the fourth item was the minister stopped by the agonized rustle in a congregation that had easily recognized Mis\u0027 Toplady\u0027s \"between services\" list of reminder, the notice of the forthcoming meeting being safe in her hymn book. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still we persist in our Sabbath conferences when \"everybody is there where you want \u0027em an\u0027 everybody can see everybody an\u0027 no time lost an\u0027 no party line listening\"; and it is then that those who have been for some time away from the village receive their warmest welcome. I am not certain that the \"I must get down to church and see everybody\" of a returned neighbour does not hold in fair measure the principles of familyhood and of Christ\u0027s persuadings to this deep comradeship. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was in this time after church that we welcomed Calliope one August Sunday when she had unexpectedly come down from town on the Saturday night. And later, when the Sunday-school bell had rung, I waited with her in the church while she looked up her Bible, left somewhere in the pews. When she had found it, she opened it in a manner of eager haste, and I inadvertently saw pasted to the inside cover a sealed letter, superscription down, for whose safety she had been concerned. I had asked her to dine with me, and as we walked home together she told me about the letter and what its sealed presence in her Bible meant. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 225] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t ever read it,\" Calliope explained to me wistfully. \"Every one o\u0027 the Ladies\u0027 Foreign Missionary Circle has got one, an\u0027 none of us has ever read \u0027em. It ain\u0027t my letter, so to say. It\u0027s one o\u0027 the Jem Pitlaw collection. The postmark,\" she imparted, looking up at me proudly, \"is Bombay, India.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At my question about the Jem Pitlaw collection she laughed deprecatingly, and then she sighed. (\"Ain\u0027t it nice,\" she had once said to me, \"your laughs hev a sigh for a linin\u0027, an\u0027 sighs can hev laughin\u0027 for trimmin\u0027. Only trouble is, most folks want to line with trimmin\u0027s, an\u0027 they ain\u0027t rill durable, used that way.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jem Pitlaw,\" Calliope told me now, \"used to be schoolmaster here—the kind that comes from Away an\u0027 is terrible looked up to on that account, but Jem deserved it. He knew all there was to know, an\u0027 yet he thought we knew some little things, too. We was all rill fond of him, though he kept to himself, an\u0027 never seemed to want to fall in love, an\u0027 not many of us knew him well enough to talk to at all familiar. But when he went off West on a vacation, an\u0027 didn\u0027t come back, an\u0027 never come back, an\u0027 then died, Friendship Village mourned for him,—sincere, though no crape,—an\u0027 missed him enormous. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027d had a room at Postmaster Sykes\u0027s—that[Pg 226] was when he was postmaster first an\u0027 they was still humble an\u0027 not above the honest penny. An\u0027 Jem Pitlaw left two trunks an\u0027 a sealed box to their house. An\u0027 when he didn\u0027t come back in two years, Silas Sykes moved the things out of the spare room over to the post-office store loft. An\u0027 there they set, three years on end, till we got word Jem was dead—the very week o\u0027 the Ladies\u0027 Foreign Missionary Circle\u0027s Ten Cent Tropical Fête. Though, rilly, the Tropical Fête wasn\u0027t what you might say \u0027tropical.\u0027 It was held on the seventeenth of January, an\u0027 that night the thermometer was twenty-four degrees below on the bank corner. Nor it wasn\u0027t rilly what you might say a Fête, either. But none o\u0027 the Circle regretted them lacks. A lack is as good as a gift, sometimes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027d started the Foreign Missionary Circle through Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes gettin\u0027 her palm. I donno what there is about palms, but you know the very name makes some folks think thoughts \u0027way outside their heads, an\u0027 not just stuffy-up inside their own brains. When I hear \u0027palm,\u0027 I sort o\u0027 feel like my i-dees got kind o\u0027 wordy wings an\u0027 just went it without me. An\u0027 that was the way with more than me, I found out. Nobody in Friendship Village hed a palm, but we\u0027d all seen pictures an\u0027 hankered—like you do. An\u0027 all of a sudden Mis\u0027 Sykes got one, like she gets her new hat, sometimes,[Pg 227] without a soul knowin\u0027 she\u0027s thinkin\u0027 \u0027hat\u0027 till she flams out in it. Givin\u0027 surprise is breath an\u0027 bread to that woman. She unpacked the palm in the kitchen, an\u0027 telephoned around, an\u0027 we all went over just as we was an\u0027 set down there an\u0027 looked at it an\u0027 thought \u0027Palm\u0027! You can\u0027t realize how we felt, all of us, if you ain\u0027t lived all your life with nothin\u0027 but begonias an\u0027 fuchsias from November to April, an\u0027 sometimes into May. But we was all mixed up about \u0027em, now we see one. Some hed heard dates grew on palms. Others would have it it was cocoanuts. Still more said they was natives of the equator, an\u0027 give nothin\u0027 but shade. So it went. But after a while Mis\u0027 Timothy Toplady spoke up with that way o\u0027 comin\u0027 downstairs on her words an\u0027 rilly gettin\u0027 to a landin\u0027:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027They\u0027s quite a number o\u0027 things,\u0027 she says, \u0027that I want to do so much it seems like I can\u0027t die without doin\u0027 \u0027em. But I guess prob\u0027ly I will die without. Folks seems to drop off leavin\u0027 lots of doin\u0027s undone. An\u0027 one o\u0027 my worst is, I want to see palm trees growin\u0027 in hot lands—big spiky leaves pointin\u0027 into the blue sky like fury. \u0027Seems if I could do that,\u0027 s\u0027she, \u0027I\u0027d take in one long breath that\u0027d make me all lungs an\u0027 float me up an\u0027 off.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We all laughed, but we knew what she meant well enough, because we all felt the same way. I[Pg 228] think most North folks do—like they was cocoanuts an\u0027 dates in our actions, \u0027way back. An\u0027 so we was all ready for Mis\u0027 Toplady\u0027s idee when it come—which is the most any idee can expect:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I tell you what,\u0027 s\u0027she, \u0027le\u0027s hev a Ladies\u0027 Foreign Missionary Circle, an\u0027 get read up on them tropical countries. The only thing I really know about the tropics is what comes to me unbeknownst when I smell my tea rose. I\u0027ve always been meanin\u0027 to take an interest in missions,\u0027 says she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So we started it, then an\u0027 there, an\u0027 she an\u0027 I was the committee to draw out a constitution an\u0027 decide what officers should be elected an\u0027 do the general creatin\u0027. We made it up that Mis\u0027 Sykes should be the president—that woman is a born leader, and, as a leader, you can depend on the very back of her head. An\u0027 at last we went off to the minister that then was to ask him what to take up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Most laudable,\u0027 s\u0027he, when he\u0027d heard. \u0027Well, now, what country is it you\u0027re most interested in?\u0027 he says. \u0027Some island of the sea, I s\u0027pose?\u0027 he asks, bright. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027We\u0027re interested in palms,\u0027 Mis\u0027 Timothy Toplady explained it to him frank, \u0027an\u0027 we want to study about the missionaries in some country where they\u0027s dates an\u0027 cocoanuts an\u0027 oaseses.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He smiled at that, sweet an\u0027 deep—I know it seemed to me as if he knew more about what we[Pg 229] wanted than we knew ourselves. Because they\u0027s some ministers that understands that Christianity ain\u0027t all in the bottle labelled with it. Some of it is labelled \u0027ointment,\u0027 an\u0027 some \u0027perfume,\u0027 an\u0027 some just plain kitchen flavourin\u0027. An\u0027 a good deal of it ain\u0027t labelled at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I forget what country it was we did study. But they was nine to ten of us, an\u0027 we met every week, an\u0027 I tell you the time wa\u0027n\u0027t wasted. We took things in lavish. I know Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss said that after belongin\u0027 to the Ladies\u0027 Foreign Missionary Circle she could never feel the same absent-minded sensation again when she dusted her parlour shells. An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady said when she opened her kitchen cabinet an\u0027 smelt the cinnamon an\u0027 allspice out o\u0027 the perforated tops, \u0027most always, no matter how mad she was, she broke out in a hymn, like \u0027When All Thy Mercies,\u0027 sheer through knowin\u0027 how allspice was born of God an\u0027 not made of man. An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes said when she read her Bible, an\u0027 it talked about India\u0027s coral strand, it seemed like, through knowin\u0027 what a reef was, she was right there on one, with her Lord. I felt the same way, too—though I\u0027d always felt the same way, for that matter—I always did tip vanilla on my handkerchief an\u0027 pretend it was flowers an\u0027 that I\u0027d gone down South for the cold months. An\u0027 it got so that when the minister give out a text that[Pg 230] had geography in it, like the Red Sea, or Beer-elim, or \u0027a place called The Fair Haven,\u0027 the Ladies Foreign Missionary Circle would look round in our seats an\u0027 nod to each other, without it showin\u0027, because we knew that we knew, extra special, just what God was talkin\u0027 about. I tell you, knowledge makes you alive at places where you didn\u0027t know there was such a place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In five months\u0027 time we felt we owed so much to the Ladies\u0027 Foreign Missionary Circle that it was Mis\u0027 Sykes suggested we give the Ten Cent Tropical Fête, an\u0027 earn five dollars or so for missions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027We know a great deal about the tropics now,\u0027 she says, \u0027an\u0027 I propose we earn a missionary thank-offering. Coral an\u0027 cocoanuts an\u0027 dates an\u0027 spices isn\u0027t all the Lord is interested in, by any means,\u0027 s\u0027she. \u0027An\u0027 the winter is the time to give a tropic fête, when folks are thinkin\u0027 about warm things natural.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We voted to hev the fête to Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s because it was too cold to carry the palm out. We went into it quite extensive—figs an\u0027 dates an\u0027 bananas an\u0027 ginger for refreshments, an\u0027 little nigger dolls for souvenirs, an\u0027 like that. It was quite a novel thing for Friendship, an\u0027 everybody was takin\u0027 an interest an\u0027 offerin\u0027 to lend Japanese umbrellas an\u0027 Indian baskets an\u0027 books on the South Sea, an\u0027 a bamboo chair with an elephant crocheted in the[Pg 231] tidy. An\u0027 then, bein\u0027 as happenin\u0027s always crowd along in flocks, what come that very week o\u0027 the fête but a letter from an old aunt of Jem Pitlaw\u0027s, out West. An\u0027 if Jem hadn\u0027t been dead almost ever since he left Friendship! an\u0027 the aunt wrote that we should sell his things to pay for keepin\u0027 \u0027em, as she was too poor to send for \u0027em an\u0027 hadn\u0027t any room if she wasn\u0027t. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I donno whether you know what rill excitement is, but if you don\u0027t, you\u0027d ought to drop two locked trunks an\u0027 a sealed box into a town the size o\u0027 Friendship Village, an\u0027 leave \u0027em there goin\u0027 on five years, an\u0027 then die an\u0027 let \u0027em be sold. That\u0027ll show you what a pitch true interest can get het up to. All of a sudden the Tropical Fête was no more account than the telephone ringin\u0027 when a circus procession is going by. Some o\u0027 the Ladies\u0027 Missionary was rill indignant, an\u0027 said we\u0027d ought to sue for repairin\u0027 rights, same as when you\u0027re interfered with in business. Mis\u0027 Sykes, she done her able best, too, but nothin\u0027 would do Silas but he must offer them things for sale on the instant. \u0027The time,\u0027 s\u0027he, firm, \u0027to do a thing is now, while the interest is up. An\u0027 in this country,\u0027 s\u0027he, \u0027\"now\" don\u0027t stay \"now\" more\u0027n two minutes at a time.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So he offered for sale the contents of them three things—the two trunks an\u0027 the sealed box—unsight, unseen, on the day before the Fête was to be. Only[Pg 232] one thing interfered with the \u0027unsight, unseen\u0027 business: the sealed box had got damp an\u0027 broke open, an\u0027 what was inside was all showin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 I saw it on the day o\u0027 the sale. Most o\u0027 the Circle was to her house finishin\u0027 up the decorations for the Fête so\u0027s to leave the last day clear for seein\u0027 to the refreshments, an\u0027 her an\u0027 I run over to the post-office store for some odds an\u0027 ends. Silas had brought the two trunks an\u0027 the box down from the loft so to give \u0027em some advertisin\u0027. An\u0027 lookin\u0027 in the corner o\u0027 the broke box we could see, just as plain as plain, was letters. Letters in bunches, all tied up, an\u0027 letters laid in loose—they must \u0027a\u0027 been full a hundred of \u0027em, all lookin\u0027 mysterious an\u0027 ready to tell you somethin\u0027, like letters will. I know the looks o\u0027 the letters sort o\u0027 went to my head, like the news of Far Off. An\u0027 I hated seein\u0027 Jem\u0027s trunks there, with his initials on, appearin\u0027 all trustin\u0027 an\u0027 as if they thought he was still alive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But that wasn\u0027t the worst. They was three strangers there in the store—travellin\u0027 men that had just come in on the Through, an\u0027 they was hangin\u0027 round the things lookin\u0027 at \u0027em, as if they had the right to. This town ain\u0027t very much on the buy, an\u0027 we don\u0027t hev many strangers here, an\u0027 we ain\u0027t rill used to \u0027em. An\u0027 it did seem too bad, I know we thought, that them three should hev happened in on the day of a private Friendship Village sale that[Pg 233] didn\u0027t concern nobody else but one, an\u0027 him dead. An\u0027 we felt this special when one o\u0027 the men took a-hold of a bunch o\u0027 the letters, an\u0027 we could see the address of the top one, to Jem Pitlaw, wrote thin an\u0027 tiny-fine, like a woman. An\u0027 at that Mis\u0027 Sykes says sharp to her husband:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Silas Sykes, you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to sell them letters?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes, ma\u0027am, I am,\u0027 Silas snaps, like he hed a right to all the letters on earth, bein\u0027 he was postmaster of Friendship Village. \u0027Letters,\u0027 Silas give out, \u0027is just precisely the same as books, only they ain\u0027t been through the expense of printin\u0027. No differ\u0027nce. No differ\u0027nce!\u0027—Silas always seems to think repeatin\u0027 a thing over\u0027ll get him somewheres, like a clock retickin\u0027 itself. \u0027An\u0027,\u0027 he says, \u0027I\u0027m goin\u0027 to sell \u0027em for what they\u0027ll bring, same as the rest o\u0027 the things, an\u0027 you needn\u0027t to say one word.\u0027 An\u0027 bein\u0027 as Silas was snappin\u0027, not only as a postmaster but as a husband, Mis\u0027 Sykes, she kep\u0027 her silence. Matrimony an\u0027 politics both in one man is too much for any woman to face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we two went back to Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s all het up an\u0027 sad, an\u0027 told the Circle about Jem Pitlaw\u0027s letters. An\u0027 we all stopped decoratin\u0027 an\u0027 set down just where we was an talked about what an awful thing it seemed. I donno as you\u0027ll sense it as strong as we did. It was more a feelin\u0027 than a wordin\u0027. Letters—bein\u0027 sold an\u0027 read out loud an\u0027 gettin\u0027[Pg 234] known about. It seemed like lookin\u0027 in somebody\u0027s purse before they\u0027re dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I should of thought,\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes says, \u0027that Silas regardin\u0027 bein\u0027 postmaster as a sacred office would have made him do differ\u0027nt. An\u0027 I know he talked that right along before he got his appointment. \"Free Private Secretary to the People,\" an\u0027 \"Trusted Curator of Public Communication,\" he put it when he was goin\u0027 around with his petition,\u0027 says she, grievin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady—I rec\u0027lect she hed been puttin\u0027 up a big Japanese umbrella, an\u0027 she looked out from under it sort o\u0027 sweet an\u0027 sincere an\u0027 dreamy—\u0027you\u0027ve got to be a woman an\u0027 you\u0027ve got to live in a little town before you know what a letter really is. I don\u0027t think these folks that hev lots o\u0027 mail left in the front hall in the mornin\u0027—an\u0027 sometimes get one that same afternoon—knows about letters at all. An\u0027 I don\u0027t believe any man ever knows, sole except when he\u0027s in love. To sense what a letter is you\u0027ve got to be a woman without what-you-may-say much to enjoy; you\u0027ve got to hear the train whistle that might bring you one; you\u0027ve got to calculate how long it\u0027ll take \u0027em to distribute the mail, an\u0027 mebbe hurry to get your bread mixed, or your fried-cakes out o\u0027 the lard, or your cannin\u0027 where you can leave it—an\u0027 then go change your shoes an\u0027 slip on another skirt,[Pg 235] an\u0027 poke your hair up under your hat so\u0027s it won\u0027t show, an\u0027 go down to the post-office in the hot sun, an\u0027 see the letter through the glass, there in your own box, waitin\u0027 for you. That minute, when your heart comes up in your throat, I tell you, is gettin\u0027 a letter.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We all knew this is so—every one of us. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s just like that when you write \u0027em, only felt differ\u0027nt,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss. \u0027I do mine to my sister a little at a time—I keep it back o\u0027 the clock in the kitchen an\u0027 hide the pencil inside the clock door, so\u0027s it won\u0027t walk off, the way pencils do at our house. An\u0027 then, right in the midst of things, be it flour or be it suds, I can scratch down what comes in my head, till I declare sometimes I can hardly mail it for readin\u0027 it over an\u0027 thinkin\u0027 how she\u0027ll like to get it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027My, my!\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes, reminiscent, \u0027\u0027specially since Silas has been postmaster an\u0027 we\u0027ve had so much to do with other people\u0027s letters, I\u0027ve been so hungry for letters of my own that I\u0027ve wrote for samples. I can do that with a level conscience because, after all, you do get a new dress now an\u0027 then. But I couldn\u0027t answer advertisements, same as some, when I didn\u0027t mean true—just to get the letters back. That don\u0027t seem to me rill honest.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 then I owned up. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 236] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Last week, when I paid my taxes,\u0027 I says, \u0027I whipped out o\u0027 the clerk\u0027s office quick, sole so\u0027s he\u0027d hev to mail me my tax receipt. But he didn\u0027t do it. He sent it over by their hired girl that noon. I love letters like I do my telephone bell an\u0027 my friends,\u0027 I know I says. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 there was all that hundred letters or so—letters that somebody had put love in for Jem Pitlaw, an\u0027 that he\u0027d read love out of an\u0027 saved \u0027em—there they was goin\u0027 to be sold for all Friendship Village to read, includin\u0027 some that hadn\u0027t even known him, mebbe more than to speak to. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We wasn\u0027t quite through decoratin\u0027 when supper time come, so we stayed on to Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s for a pick-up lunch, et in the kitchen, an\u0027 finished up afterwards. Most of \u0027em could do that better than they could leave their work an\u0027 come down again next mornin\u0027—men-folks can always get along for supper, bein\u0027 it\u0027s not a hot meal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Ain\u0027t it wonderful,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, thoughtful, \u0027here we are, settin\u0027 \u0027round the kitchen table at Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes\u0027s in Friendship Village. An\u0027 away off in Arabia or Asia or somewhere that I ain\u0027t sure they is any such place, is somebody settin\u0027 that never heard of us nor we of him, an\u0027 he\u0027s goin\u0027 to hev our five dollars from the Tropical Fête to-morrow night, an\u0027 put it to work doin\u0027 good.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It makes sort of a connection, don\u0027t it?\u0027 says[Pg 237] Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss. \u0027There they are an\u0027 here we are. Ain\u0027t it strange? \u0027Seems like our doin\u0027 this makes us feel nearer to them places. I donno but that,\u0027 says she, noddin\u0027, \u0027is the start of what it means about the lion and the lamb layin\u0027 down together.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh!\u0027says Mis\u0027 Toplady, \u0027I tell you the Foreign Missionary Circle has been next best to goin\u0027. \u0027Seems sometimes as if I\u0027ve \u0027most been somewheres an\u0027 seen palms a-growin\u0027 an\u0027 a-wavin\u0027 an\u0027 a red sky back. Don\u0027t it to you? I\u0027ve dreamed o\u0027 them places all my life, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t never had anything but Friendship Village, an\u0027 I don\u0027t know now that Arabia an\u0027 Asia an\u0027 India is rilly fitted in, the way they look on the map. An\u0027 so with some more. But if so be they are, then,\u0027 she says, \u0027we owe it to the Foreign Missionary Circle that we\u0027ve got that far towards seein\u0027 \u0027em.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 we all agreed, warm, excep\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes, who was the hostess an\u0027 too busy to talk much; but we knew how she felt. An\u0027 we said some more about how wonderful things are, there in Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s kitchen while we et. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, when we got done decoratin\u0027 after supper, we all walked over to the post-office store to the sale—the whole Circle of us. Because, of course, if the letters was to be sold there wasn\u0027t any harm in seein\u0027 who got \u0027em, an\u0027 in knowin\u0027 just how mean[Pg 238] who was. Then, too, we was interested in what was in the two trunks. We was quite early—early enough to set along on the front rows of breakfast-food boxes that was fixed ready. An\u0027 in the very frontmost one was Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss, an\u0027 me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But we see, first thing when we got into the store, that they was strangers present. The three travellin\u0027 men that Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 I had noticed that afternoon was still in town, of course, an\u0027 there they was to the sale, loungin\u0027 along on the counter each side o\u0027 the cheese. We couldn\u0027t bear their bein\u0027 there. It was our sale, an\u0027 they wasn\u0027t rill sure to understand. To us Mr. Pitlaw hed been Mr. Pitlaw. To them he was just somebody that hed been somebody. I didn\u0027t like it, nor they didn\u0027t none o\u0027 the Ladies\u0027 Missionary like it. We all looked at each other an\u0027 nodded without it showin\u0027, like we do, an\u0027 we could see we all felt the same. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Silas was goin\u0027 to officiate himself—that man has got the idee it\u0027s the whistle that runs the boat. They had persuaded him to open the trunks an\u0027 sell the things off piecemeal, an\u0027 he see that was rilly the only way to do it. So when the time come he broke open the two trunks an\u0027 he wouldn\u0027t let anybody touch hasp or strap or hammer but himself. It made me sort of sick to see even the trunk things of Mr. Pitlaw\u0027s come out—a pepper an\u0027 salt suit, a[Pg 239] pair of new suspenders, a collar an\u0027 cuff case—the kind that you\u0027d recognize was a Christmas present; a nice brush an\u0027 comb he\u0027d kept for best an\u0027 never used, a cake of pretty-paper soap he\u0027d never opened, a bunch o\u0027 keys, an\u0027 like that. You know how it makes you feel to unpack even your own things that have been put away a good while; it\u0027s like thinkin\u0027 over forgot thoughts. Well, an\u0027 this was worse. Jem Pitlaw, that none of us had known well enough to mention familiar things to, was dead—he was dead; an\u0027 here we were, lookin\u0027 on an\u0027 seein\u0027 the things that was never out of his room before, an\u0027 that he\u0027d put in there, neat an\u0027 nice, five years back, to be took out, he thought, in a few weeks. Quite a lot of us felt delicate, but some got behind the delicate idee an\u0027 made it an excuse for not buyin\u0027 much. They\u0027s all kinds to a sale—did you ever notice? Timothy Toplady, for instance—I donno but he\u0027s all kinds in his single self. \u0027Seems he couldn\u0027t bring himself to bid on a thing but Jem Pitlaw\u0027s keys. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Of course nobody knows what they\u0027ll fit,\u0027 says he, disparagin\u0027, \u0027so to buy \u0027em don\u0027t seem like bein\u0027 too familiar with Mr. Pitlaw,\u0027 s\u0027he, rill pleased with himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Mis\u0027 Sykes whispers to me:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Them keys\u0027ll go dirt cheap, an\u0027 Timothy knows it, an\u0027 a strange key may come in handy[Pg 240] any minute. Timothy\u0027s reasons never whip to a froth,\u0027 s\u0027she, cold. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I guess she was over-critical because of gettin\u0027 more fidgety, like we all did, the nearer Silas got to the letters. He hed left the letters till the last. An\u0027 what with folks peekin\u0027 in the box since he\u0027d brought it down, an\u0027 what with handlin\u0027 what was ready to spill out, most of \u0027em by then was in plain sight. An\u0027 there I see more o\u0027 them same ones—little thin writin\u0027, like a woman\u0027s. We \u0027most all noticed it. An\u0027 I couldn\u0027t keep my eyes off of \u0027em. \u0027Seemed like she might be somebody with soft ways that ought to be there, savin\u0027 the letters, wardin\u0027 off the heartache for Mr. Pitlaw an\u0027 mebbe one for herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 right while I was lookin\u0027 Silas turned to the box and cleared his throat, important as if he was the whistle for New York City, an\u0027 he lifted up the bunch of the letters that had the little fine writin\u0027 on top, just the way Mr. Pitlaw had tied \u0027em up with common string. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh!\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady and Mis\u0027 Sykes, each side of me, the one \u0027oh!\u0027 strong an\u0027 the other low, but both \u0027oh\u0027s\u0027 meanin\u0027 the same thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Now, what,\u0027 says Silas, brisk, \u0027am I bid for this package of nice letters here? Good clear writin\u0027, all in strong condition, an\u0027 no holes in, just as firm an\u0027 fresh,\u0027 s\u0027he, \u0027as the day they was dropped into[Pg 241] the mail. What am I bid for \u0027em?\u0027 he asks, his eyebrows rill expectant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not one of the travellin\u0027 men had bid a thing. They had sat still, just merely loungin\u0027 each side the cheese, laughin\u0027 some, like men will, among each other, but not carin\u0027 to take any part, an\u0027 we ladies felt rill glad o\u0027 that. But all of a sudden, when Silas put up the bunch o\u0027 letters, them three men woke up, an\u0027 we see like lightnin\u0027 that this was what they hed been waitin\u0027 for. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twenty-five cents!\u0027 bids one of \u0027em, decisive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was a movement of horror spread around the Missionary Circle at the words. Sometimes it\u0027s bad enough to hev one thing happen, but often it\u0027s worse to hev another occur. Even Silas looked a little doubtful, but to Silas the main chance is always the main thing, an\u0027 instantly he see that these men, if they got in the spirit of it, would run them letters up rill high just for the fun of it. An\u0027 Silas was like some are: he felt that money is money. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So what did he do but begin cryin\u0027 the goods up higher—holdin\u0027 the letters in his hands, that little, thin writin\u0027 lookin\u0027 like it was askin\u0027 somethin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Here we hev letters,\u0027 says Silas, \u0027letters from Away. Not just business letters, to judge by the envelopes—an\u0027 I allow, gentlemen,\u0027 says Silas, facetious, \u0027that, bein\u0027 postmaster of Friendship Village, I\u0027m as good a judge of letters as there is a-goin\u0027.[Pg 242] Here we hev some intimate personal letters offered for sale legitimate by their heiress. What am I bid?\u0027 asks he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Thirty-five cents!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Fifty cents!\u0027 says the other two travellin\u0027 gentlemen, quick an\u0027 in turn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Seventy-five cents!\u0027 cries out the first, gettin\u0027 in earnest—though they was all laughin\u0027 at hevin\u0027 somethin\u0027 inspirin\u0027 to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Silas merely caught a-hold of the mood they was in, crafty, as if he\u0027d been gettin\u0027 the signers to his petition while they was feelin\u0027 good. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027One moment, gentlemen!\u0027 s\u0027he. \u0027Do you know what you\u0027re biddin\u0027 on? I ain\u0027t told you the half yet,\u0027 s\u0027he. \u0027I ain\u0027t told you,\u0027 s\u0027he, \u0027where these letters come from.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With that he hitches his glasses an\u0027 looked at the postmarks. An\u0027 he read \u0027em off. Oh, an\u0027 what do you guess them postmarks was? I\u0027ll never forget the feelin\u0027 that come over me when I heard what he was sayin\u0027, turnin\u0027 back in under the string to see. For the stamps on the letters was foreign stamps. The postmarks was foreign postmarks. An\u0027 what Silas read off was: Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Singapore—oh, I can\u0027t begin to remember all the names nor to pronounce \u0027em, but I think they was all in India, or leastwise in Asia. Think of it! in Asia, that none of the Ladies\u0027 Foreign[Pg 243] Missionary Circle hed been sure there was such a place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know how we all looked around at each other sudden, with the same little jump in the chest as when we remember we\u0027ve got bread in the oven past the three-quarters, or when we\u0027ve left the preserves on the blaze while we\u0027ve done somethin\u0027 else an\u0027 think it\u0027s burnin\u0027, or when we\u0027ve cut out both sleeves for one arm an\u0027 ain\u0027t got any more cloth. I mean it was that intimate, personal jump, like when awful, first-person things have happened. An\u0027 I tell you what, when the Ladies\u0027 Missionary feels a thing, they feel it strong an\u0027 they act it sudden. It\u0027s our way, as a Circle. An\u0027 in that look that went round among us there was hid the nod that knows what each other means. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027One dollar!\u0027 shouts one o\u0027 the travellin\u0027 men. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 with that we all turned, like one solid human being, straight towards Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes, that was our president an\u0027 a born leader besides, an\u0027 the way we looked at her resembled a vote. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mis\u0027 Sykes stood up, grave an\u0027 scairt, though not to show. An\u0027 we was sure she\u0027d do the right thing, though we didn\u0027t know what the right thing was; but we felt confidence, I know, in the very pattern on the back of her shawl. An\u0027 she says, clear:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I\u0027d like to be understood to bid for the whole[Pg 244] box o\u0027 Mr. Pitlaw\u0027s letters, includin\u0027 the bunch that\u0027s up. An\u0027 I bid five dollars.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course we all knew in a minute what that meant: Mis\u0027 Sykes was biddin\u0027 with the proceeds of the Ten Cent Tropical Fête that was to be. But we see, too, that this was a missionary cause if there ever was one, an\u0027 they wa\u0027n\u0027t one of us that thought it irregular, or grudged it, or looked behind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know whether you know how much five dollars rilly is—like you sense it when you\u0027ve spoke it to a sale, or put it on a subscription paper in Friendship. There wasn\u0027t a sound in that store, everybody was so dumfounded. But none was so much as Silas Sykes. Silas was so surprised that he forgot that he was in public. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027My King!\u0027 says he, unexpected to himself. \u0027What you sayin\u0027, Huldy? You ain\u0027t biddin\u0027 that out o\u0027 your allowance, be you?\u0027 says he. Silas likes big words in the home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027No, sir,\u0027 says she, crisp, back, \u0027I ain\u0027t. I can\u0027t do miracles out of nothin\u0027. But I bid, an\u0027 you\u0027ll get your money, Silas. An\u0027 I may as well take the letters now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With that she rose up an\u0027 spread out her shawl almost broodin\u0027, an\u0027 gathered that box o\u0027 Jem Pitlaw\u0027s into her two arms. An\u0027 with one motion all the rest o\u0027 the Ladies\u0027 Missionary got up behind her an\u0027 stalked out of the store, like a big bid is sole all[Pg 245] there is to an auction. An\u0027 they let us go. Why, there wasn\u0027t another thing for Silas Sykes to do but let be as was. Them three men over by the cheese just laughed, an\u0027 said out somethin\u0027 about no gentleman outbiddin\u0027 a lady, an\u0027 shut up, beat, but pretendin\u0027 to give in, like some will. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just before we all got to the door we heard somebody\u0027s feet come down off\u0027n a cracker-barrel or somethin\u0027, an\u0027 Timothy Toplady\u0027s voice after us, shrill-high an\u0027 nervous:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Amanda,\u0027 s\u0027he, \u0027you ain\u0027t calculatin\u0027 to help back up this tomfoolishness, I hope?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Amanda says at him, over her shoulder: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027If I was, that\u0027d be between my hens an\u0027 me, Timothy Toplady,\u0027 says she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 the store door shut behind us—not mad, I remember, but gentle, like \u0027Amen.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We took the letters straight to Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s an\u0027 through the house to the kitchen, where there was a good hot fire in the range. It was bitter cold outdoors, an\u0027 we set down around the stove just as we was, with the letters on the floor in front o\u0027 the hearth. An\u0027 when Mis\u0027 Sykes hed got the bracket lamp lit, she turned round, her bonnet all crooked but her face triumphant, an\u0027 took off a griddle of the stove an\u0027 stirred up the coals. An\u0027 we see what was in her mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027We can take turns puttin\u0027 \u0027em in,\u0027 she says. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 246] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I guess it was in all our minds what Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss says, wistful:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t you think,\u0027 she says, \u0027or do you think, it\u0027d be wrongin\u0027 Mr. Pitlaw if we read over the postmarks out loud first?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We divided up the bunches an\u0027 we set down around an\u0027 untied the strings, an\u0027, turn in an\u0027 turn out, we read the postmarks off. \u0027Most every one of \u0027em was foreign—oh, I can\u0027t begin to tell you where. It was all mixed up an\u0027 shinin\u0027 of names we\u0027d never heard of before, an\u0027 names we had heard in sermons an\u0027 in the Bible—Egypt an\u0027 Greece an\u0027 Rome an\u0027 isles o\u0027 the sea. Mis\u0027 Toplady stopped right in the middle o\u0027 hers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh, I can\u0027t be sure I\u0027m pronouncin\u0027 \u0027em right,\u0027 she says, huntin\u0027 for her handkerchief, \u0027but I guess you ladies get the feel o\u0027 the places, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 that was just it: we did. We got the feel of them far places that night like we never could hev hed it any other way. An\u0027 when we got all through, Mis\u0027 Toplady spoke up again—but this time it was like she flew up a little way an\u0027 lit on somethin\u0027. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It ain\u0027t likely,\u0027 she says, \u0027that we\u0027ll ever, any of us, hev a letter of our own from places like these. We don\u0027t get many letters, an\u0027 what we do get come from the same old towns, over an\u0027 over again, an\u0027 quite near by. Do you know,\u0027 she says, \u0027I believe this Writin\u0027 here\u0027—she held out the tiny fine [Pg 247]writing that was like a woman with soft ways—\u0027would understand if we each took one of her letters an\u0027 glued it together here an\u0027 now an\u0027 carried it home an\u0027 pasted it in our Bibles. She went travellin\u0027 off to them places, an\u0027 she must have wanted to; an\u0027 she would know what it is to want to go an\u0027 yet never get there.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think Mis\u0027 Amanda was right—we all thought so. An\u0027 we done what she mentioned, an\u0027 made our choice o\u0027 postmarks. I know Mis\u0027 Amanda took Cairo. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027\u0027Count of the name sort o\u0027 picturin\u0027 out a palm tree a-growin\u0027 an\u0027 a-wavin\u0027 against a red sky,\u0027 she says, when she was pinnin\u0027 her shawl clear up over her hat to go out in the cold. \u0027Think of it,\u0027 she says; \u0027she might \u0027a\u0027 passed a palm the day she wrote it. Ain\u0027t it like seein\u0027 \u0027em grow yourself?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n ... \"Mebbe it all wasn\u0027t quite regular,\" Calliope added, \"though we made over five dollars at the Ten Cent Fête. But the minister, when we told him, he seemed to think it was all right, an\u0027 he kep\u0027 smilin\u0027, sweet an\u0027 deep, like we\u0027d done more\u0027n we had done. An\u0027 I think he knew what we meant when we said we was all feelin\u0027 nearer, lion an\u0027 lamb, to them strange missionary countries.
