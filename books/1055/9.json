{"id":34687,"no":9,"title":"IX THE COLD SHOULDER","content":"There is something more about Mrs. Oliver Wheeler Johnson. Did you ever look through an old school-book of your own and, say, on the history picture of Vesuvius in eruption impose your own memory of Pompeii, visited in these twenty years since you studied about it; and have you not stared hard at the time between and felt yourself some one other than that one who once dreamed over the Vesuvius picture? Or, years after you read the Letters, you have made a little mark below Cicero\u0027s cry from exile, \"Oh, that I had been less eager for life!\" and you look at the cry and at the mark, and you and one of these become an anachronism—but you are not sure which it is that so becomes. So now, in reading over these notes some while after I have set them down, I am minded here to give you my look ahead to the end of the summer and to slip in some account of what happened as a closing of the tale. And I confess that something about me—perhaps it is the [Pg 137]Custodian herself—likes this way of pretending a freedom from time and of looking upon its fruit to say which seeds have grown and which have not. Friendship Village is not superstitious, but when curious coincidences occur we do, as we say, \"take down note.\" And it did seem like a judgment upon us that, a little time after the Java fiasco, and while indignation was yet at high noon, Mrs. Oliver Wheeler Johnson fell ill. At first I think we affected not to know it. When she did not appear at church, none of us mentioned it for a Sunday or two. Then when some one casually noted her absence we said, \"Oh, wasn\u0027t she? Got little cold, likely.\" That we saw her no more down town or \"brushing up\" about her door we facilely laid to chance. When the village heard that her maid—who always offended by talking almost in a whisper—had once or twice excused her mistress to callers, every one shut lips and hardened hearts and said some folk acted very funny about their calling duties. But when, at the twelve o\u0027clock breakfast of the new minister\u0027s wife—(\"Like enough breakfast at noon was a real Bible custom,\" the puzzled devotees solved that amazing hour), Mrs. Johnson did not appear, the village was forced to admit that something must be wrong. Moreover, against its will the behaviour of young Mr. Johnson was gravely alarming Friendship.[Pg 138] Mr. Johnson was in real estate and insurance in the city, and this did not impress the village as a serious business. \"Because, what does he sell!\" as Abigail Arnold said. \"We know he don\u0027t own property. He rents the very house they live in. A doctor\u0027s a doctor an\u0027 he gives pills, an\u0027 a store\u0027s a store with the kind o\u0027 thing you need. But it don\u0027t seem like that man could make a real good livin\u0027 for her, dealin\u0027 vague in nothin\u0027 that way.\" His income, it was felt, was problematical, and the village had settled it that what the Oliver Wheeler Johnsons\u0027 had was chiefly wedding presents \"an\u0027 high-falutin\u0027 tastes.\" But, in the face of the evidence, every afternoon at three o\u0027clock the young husband ordered a pha?ton from Jimmy Sturgis and came home from the city to take his wife to drive. Between shutters the village saw that little Mrs. Johnson\u0027s face did look betrayingly pale, and the blue ostrich plume lay motionless on her bright hair. \"I guess Mis\u0027 Johnson\u0027s real run down,\" her acquaintances said to one another uneasily. Still we did not go to see her. The weeks went by until, one morning, Calliope met the little new Friendship doctor on the street and asked him about his patient. \"I up an\u0027 ask\u0027 him flat out,\" Calliope confessed afterward; \"not that I really cared to be told, but I hated to know I was heathenish. You don\u0027t like the feelin\u0027. To know they ain\u0027t heathens is all[Pg 139] that keeps some folks from bein\u0027 \u0027em. Well, so I ask\u0027 him. \u0027Doctor Heron,\u0027 s\u0027I, \u0027is that Mis\u0027 Johnson real sick, or is she just sickish?\u0027 He looks at me an\u0027—\u0027Looks pretty sick, don\u0027t she?\u0027 s\u0027e. \u0027Well,\u0027 s\u0027I, \u0027I\u0027ve seen folks look real rich that wa\u0027n\u0027t it by right-down pocketbook evidence.\u0027 \u0027Been to see her?\u0027 s\u0027e. \u0027No,\u0027 s\u0027I, short. \u0027Might drop in,\u0027 s\u0027e, an\u0027 walks off, lookin\u0027 cordial. That little Doctor Heron is that close-mouthed I declare if I don\u0027t respect him same as the minister an\u0027 the pipe-organ an\u0027 the skippin\u0027 hills.\" So, as midsummer passed and found the little woman still ailing, I obeyed an idle impulse and went one evening to see her. I recall that as soon as I had crossed her threshold the old influence came upon me, and I was minded to run from the place in sheer distaste of the overemphasis and the lifted, pointed chin and the fluttering importances of her presence. I was ashamed enough that this should be so, but so it was; and I held my ground to await her coming to the room only by a measure of will. I sat with Mrs. Johnson for an hour that evening. And it would seem that, as is the habit of many, having taken my own way I was straightway possessed to draw others after me. There are those who behave similarly and who set cunningly to work to gain their own ends, as, for example, I did.[Pg 140] For one night soon I devised a little feast, which I have always held to be a good doorway to any enterprise, and, at the Friendship-appointed supper hour of six, I made my table as fair as possible, as has been done in like case ever since butter was first served \"in a lordly dish.\" And my guests were Calliope, without whom no festival is wholly in keeping, and Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss, and Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes, and that great, tolerant Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady. Because they had arrived so unsuspectingly I own myself to have felt guilty enough when, in that comfortable half-hour after a new and delectable dessert had been pronounced upon, I suggested with what casualness I might summon that we five pay a visit that night to Mrs. Oliver Wheeler Johnson. \"Land!\" said Mis\u0027 Holcomb, \"I\u0027ve thought I would an\u0027 then I\u0027ve thought I wouldn\u0027t till I feel all two-faced about myself. I donno. Sometimes I think one way an\u0027 sometimes I think the other. Are you ever like that?\" \"I s\u0027pose,\" said Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes, majestically, \"that them in our position ought to overlook. I donno\u0027s \u0027twould hurt us any to go,\" she added graciously. Calliope\u0027s eyes twinkled. \"That\u0027s it,\" she said; \"let them that\u0027s got the[Pg 141] social position to overlook things be Christian an\u0027 overlook \u0027em.\" That great Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady folded her hands, dimpled like a baby giant\u0027s. \"I\u0027d be glad to go,\" she said simply; \"I\u0027ve got some grape jell that looks to me like it wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to keep long, an\u0027 I\u0027d be thankful to be on terms with her so\u0027s I could carry it in to her. They ain\u0027t a single other invalid in Friendship.\" Calliope sprang to her feet and crossed her little arms, a hand hugging either shoulder. \"Well said!\" she cried; \"do let\u0027s go! I\u0027m sick to death of slidin\u0027 off the subject whenever it comes up in my mind.\" So, in the fair October dusk, we five went down the Plank Road—where Summer lingers late. The air was gentle with the soft, impending dark. I wonder why the colonnade of sweet influences, down which we stepped, did not win us to themselves. But I remember how, instead, our imminent visit drew us back to the days of Mrs. Johnson\u0027s coming, so that presently we were going over the incident of the Java entertainment, and, as Calliope would have put it, \"crystallizing and boiling over\" again in the old distaste. But when we reached the little cottage of the Johnsons, our varied motives for the visit were abruptly merged in a common anxiety. For Doctor[Pg 142] Heron\u0027s buggy stood at the gate and the little one-story cottage was dark save for a light in what we knew to be a corner bedroom. The hallway was open to the night, but though we could distinctly hear the bell jingle in the kitchen no one answered the summons. Then, there being somewhere about a murmur of voices, Calliope stepped within and called softly:— \"Doctor, Doctor Heron—you there? Is they anything we can do?\" The doctor came momentarily to the lighted doorway down the hall. \"That you, Calliope?\" he said. \"You might come here, will you? Tell the rest to sit down somewheres. And you tell Mr. Johnson he can come.\" On which, from out the dark living room, some one emerged very swiftly and without a word pushed by us all where we were crowded in the passage and strode down to the little lighted chamber. Calliope hurried after him, and we four shrank back in sudden dread and slipped silently into the room which the young husband had left, and stood together in the dimness. Was she so sick? In that room he must have heard the door-bell as we had heard it, and yet he had not answered. Was it possible that we had come too late? While we waited we said nothing at all, save that[Pg 143] great Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady, who said three times or four, \"Oh, dear, oh, dear, I\u0027m always waitin\u0027 till somethin\u0027s too late—either me or the other thing.\" It seemed very long before we heard some stir, but it can have been only a few minutes until the doctor came down the little hall and groped into the room. In answer to all that we asked he merely occupied himself in lighting a match and setting it deliberately to the candles on the table and adjusting their shades. They were, we noted afterward, the same candles whose presence we had detected and derided at those long ago tête-à-tête suppers in that house. The light glowed on the young doctor\u0027s pale face as he looked at us, each in turn, before he spoke. And when he had done with his slow scrutiny—I think that we cannot wholly have fancied its accusation—he said only:— \"Yes, she\u0027s pretty sick. I can\u0027t tell yet.\" Then he turned and closed the outer door and stood leaning against it, looking up the hall. \"Miss Marsh!\" he called. But why did the man not tell us something, we wondered; and there flashed in my mind Calliope\u0027s reference to the pipe-organ and the skipping hills. At all events, Calliope would tell us. And so she did. We heard her step in the hall, coming quickly and yet with a manner of exceeding care. I think that with the swift sense which wings[Pg 144] before intelligence, the others understood before they saw her, even as I understood. Calliope stopped in the doorway as if she could trust herself to go no farther. And she was holding something in her arms. \"Calliope,\" we said; \"Calliope....\" She looked down at that which she held, and then she looked at us. And the tears were in her eyes, but her face was brighter than I have ever known it. \"It\u0027s a baby,\" she said, \"a little bit of a baby. Her baby. An\u0027 it makes me feel—it makes me feel—oh,\" she broke off, \"don\u0027t it make you feel that way, too?\" We looked at one another, and avoided one another\u0027s look, and then looked long at the baby. I do not remember that we said anything at all, or if we did so, that it bore a meaning. But an instant after Calliope gave the baby to the nurse who appeared in the doorway, we all tiptoed down to the kitchen by common consent. And it was plain that Mrs. Johnson\u0027s baby made us feel that way, too. In our desire to be of tardy service we did the most absurd things. We took possession of the kitchen, rejoicing that we found the supper dishes uncared for, and we heated a great kettle of water, and washed and wiped and put away, as softly as we could; and then we \"brushed up around.\" I think that only the need of silence kept us from[Pg 145] cleaning windows. When the nurse appeared—who had arrived that day unknown of Friendship—we sprang as one to do her bidding. We sent the little maid to bed, we tidied the living room, walking tiptoe, and then we went back through the kitchen and sat down on the little side \"stoop.\" And all this time we had addressed one another only about the tasks which we had in hand. After a little silence, \"The milkman was quite late this morning,\" observed Mis\u0027 Holcomb. \"Well, he\u0027s begun to deliver in cans instead o\u0027 bottles,\" Mis\u0027 Sykes explained; \"it takes him some longer to get around. He says bottles makes his wife just that much more to do.\" Then we fell silent again. It was Calliope, sitting on the porch step outside, where it was dark, who at last had the courage to be articulate. \"I hope—I hope,\" she said, \"she\u0027s goin\u0027 to be all right.\" Mis\u0027 Sykes shaded her eyes from the bracket lamp within. \"I\u0027ll go bail,\" she said, \"that little you-do-as-I-say chin\u0027ll carry her through. I\u0027m glad she\u0027s got it.\" Just then we heard the thin crying of the child and we could divine Calliope, that on the step where[Pg 146] she sat she was hugging her arms and rocking somewhat, to and fro. \"Like enough,\" she said, \"oh, like enough—folks ain\u0027t so cramped about runnin\u0027 their own feelin\u0027s as they think they are!\" To this we murmured something indefinite in sound but positive enough in sense. And we all knew what we all knew. \"Let\u0027s go out around the house to the front gate,\" said that great Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady, abruptly. \"Have any of you ladies got two handkerchiefs?\" \"I\u0027ve got two,\" said Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes, \"an\u0027 I ain\u0027t used either one. Do you want the one with essence or the one without?\" \"I ain\u0027t partial,\" said Mis\u0027 Amanda. We rose and stumbled along the grassy path that led round the house. At the gate we met Doctor Heron. \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"well.\" And after a moment, \"Will—will any of you be here in the morning?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" we all said simply. \"That\u0027s good,\" he commented shortly, \"I didn\u0027t know.\" We five had to separate at the first corner to go our home ways, and we stood for a moment under the gas-light. I remember how, just then, Peter\u0027s father came singing past us, like one of the [Pg 147]Friendship family who did not understand his kinship. Even as we five had not understood ours. \"You haven\u0027t got a shawl, hev you?\" Mis\u0027 Sykes said to me solicitously. \"The nights have been some chilly on a person\u0027s shoulders for a day or two now,\" said Mis\u0027 Holcomb. Calliope put her hand up quickly to her throat. \"Quit,\" she said. \"All of you. Thank God. An\u0027 shake hands. I tell you, after this I bet I\u0027ll run my own feelin\u0027s about folks or I\u0027ll bring down the sky an\u0027 make new feelin\u0027s! Oh,\" said Calliope, \"don\u0027t her—an\u0027 now—an\u0027 the baby—an\u0027—oh, an\u0027 that bright star winkin\u0027 over that hitchin\u0027 post, make things seem—easy? Good night. I can\u0027t stand out here any longer.\" But when we had gone away a few steps, Calliope called us back. And as we turned again, \"To bring down the sky,\" she repeated, \"I bet that\u0027s the way God meant us to do. They ain\u0027t any of us got enough to us to piece out without it!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1799/52247.html","bookId":1055,"book":{"id":1055,"title":"Friendship Village Love Stories","description":"简介： Although it is June, the Little Child about whom I shall sometimes write in these pages this morning brought me a few violets.
