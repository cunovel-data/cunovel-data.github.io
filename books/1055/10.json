{"id":34688,"no":10,"title":"X EVENING DRESS","content":"I have said that Daphne Street has been paved within the past year, but I had not heard of the manner in which the miracle had been wrought until the day when Calliope\u0027s brief stay in the village ended and she came to tell me good-by—and, more than incidentally, to show me some samples of a dress which she might have, and a dress which she wouldn\u0027t have, and a dress which she had made up her mind to have. \"We don\u0027t dress much here in Friendship Village,\" she observed. \"Not but what we\u0027d like to, but we ain\u0027t the time nor the means nor the places to wear to. But they was one night—\" She looked at me, as always when she means to tell a story, somewhat with the manner of asking a permission. \"None of the low-neck\u0027 fashion-plates used to seem real to us,\" she said. \"We used to look at \u0027em pinned up in Lyddy Ember\u0027s dressmakin\u0027[Pg 149] windows, ah-ahing in their low pink an\u0027 long blue, an\u0027 we\u0027d look \u0027em over an\u0027 think tolerant enough, like about sea-serpents. But neither the one nor the other bit hold rill vital, because the plates was so young an\u0027 smilin\u0027 an\u0027 party-seemin\u0027, an\u0027 we was old an\u0027 busy, like you get, an\u0027 considered past the dressin\u0027 age. Still, it made kind of a nice thing to do on the way home from the grocery hot forenoons—draw up there on the shady side, where the street kitters some into a curve, an\u0027 look at Lyddy\u0027s plates, an\u0027 choose, like you was goin\u0027 to get one. \"Land knows we needed some oasises on that street from the grocery up home. Daphne Street, our main street, didn\u0027t always use\u0027 to be what it is now—neat little wooden blocks an\u0027 a stone curb. You know how it use\u0027 to be—no curb an\u0027 the road a sight, over your shoe-tops with mud in the wet, an\u0027 over your shoe-tops with sand when it come dry. We ladies used to talk a good deal about it, but the men knew it meant money to hev it fixed, an\u0027 so they told us hevin\u0027 it fixed meant cuttin\u0027 the trees down, an\u0027 that kept us quiet—all but the Friendship Married Ladies Cemetery Improvement Sodality. \"Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes was president o\u0027 the Sodality last year, you know,—she\u0027s most always president of everything,—an\u0027 we\u0027d been workin\u0027[Pg 150] quite hard all that winter, an\u0027 had got things in the cemetery rill ship-shape—at least I mean things on the cemetery was. An\u0027 at one o\u0027 the July meetin\u0027s last summer Mis\u0027 Sykes up an\u0027 proposed that we give over workin\u0027 for the dead an\u0027 turn to the livin\u0027, an\u0027 pave the main street of Friendship Village. \"\u0027True,\u0027 she says, \u0027our constitution states that the purpose of our Sodality shall be to keep up the graves of our townspeople an\u0027 make \u0027em attractive to others. But,\u0027 says she, \u0027when they ain\u0027t enough of us dead to occupy all the time, the only Christian way to remedy that is to work for folks before they die, while we\u0027re waitin\u0027 for their graves.\u0027 \"This seemed reasonable, an\u0027 we voted unanimous to pave Daphne Street. An\u0027 on the way home Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Timothy Toplady an\u0027 I see Timothy Toplady settin\u0027 in the post-office store, an\u0027 we went in to tell him an\u0027 Silas Sykes about it. But before we could start in, Silas says, eyebrows all eager, \u0027Ain\u0027t you heard?\u0027 \"\u0027Heard what?\u0027 says his wife, kind o\u0027 cross, bein\u0027 he was her wedded husband an\u0027 she hadn\u0027t heard. \"\u0027\u0027Bout Threat Hubbelthwait,\u0027 says Silas, lookin\u0027 at Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 me, bein\u0027s Mis\u0027 Sykes was his wife. \u0027Drunk again,\u0027 says Silas, \u0027an\u0027 fiddlin\u0027 for dear life, an\u0027 won\u0027t let anybody into the hotel. Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait has gone over to her mother\u0027s,[Pg 151] an\u0027 the hired girl with her; an\u0027 Threat\u0027s settin\u0027 in the bar an\u0027 playin\u0027 all the hymn tunes he knows.\u0027 \"It wasn\u0027t the first time it had happened, you know. Threat an\u0027 his wife an\u0027 the hired girl keep the only hotel in Friendship Village—when Threat is sober. When he isn\u0027t, he sometimes closes up the house an\u0027 turns out whoever happens to be there, an\u0027 won\u0027t let a soul in—though, of course, not much of anybody ever comes to Friendship anyway, excep\u0027 now an\u0027 then an automobile on its way somewheres. An\u0027 there Threat will set in the bar, sometimes most of one week, sometimes most of two, an\u0027 scrape away on the only tunes he knows—all hymns, \u0027Just As I Am,\u0027 an\u0027 \u0027Can A Little Child Like Me?\u0027 Threat don\u0027t mean to be sacrilegious; he shows that by never singin\u0027 them two hymns in church, when they\u0027re give out. \"\u0027Land!\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes, when Silas got through, \u0027what men are!\u0027 \"\u0027We ain\u0027t so much as woman, lemme tell you,\u0027 says Silas, right crisp. Which wasn\u0027t what he meant, an\u0027 we all laughed at him, so he was a little mad to start with. \"\u0027The Sodality\u0027s decided to pave Daphne Street,\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes mentions then, simple. \"\u0027Pave what?\u0027 shouts Silas—Silas always seems to think the more you do in sound the more you\u0027ll do in sense. [Pg 152] \"\u0027Do what to Daphne Street?\u0027 says Timothy, whirlin\u0027 from the peanut roaster. \"\u0027Pave Daphne Street,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 me, wonderin\u0027. \"Silas wrapped his arms around his own shoulders. \"\u0027When,\u0027 says he, lettin\u0027 his head lurch with his own emphasizin\u0027, \u0027did the Common Council hear about this?\u0027 \"\u0027They ain\u0027t heard, about it,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes, \u0027no more\u0027n we ever hear anything about them.\u0027 \"Silas an\u0027 Timothy is both aldermen, an\u0027 rill sensitive over it. I guess the Common Council always is a delicate subject, ain\u0027t it? \"Mebbe it wasn\u0027t a rill diplomatic way to begin, but it hadn\u0027t entered the Sodality\u0027s head that the town wouldn\u0027t be glad to hev the pavin\u0027 done if the Sodality was willin\u0027 to do it. Ain\u0027t it a hard thing to learn that it ain\u0027t all willingness, nor yet all bein\u0027 capable, that gets things done in the world? It\u0027s part just edgin\u0027 round an\u0027 edgin\u0027 round. \"What did the Common Council do that night but call a special meetin\u0027 an\u0027 vote not to order any city pavin\u0027 done that present year. Every member was there but Threat Hubbelthwait, who was fiddlin\u0027, an\u0027 every vote was switched by Silas an\u0027 Timothy to be unanimous, excep\u0027 Eppleby Holcomb\u0027s vote. Eppleby, we heard afterwards, said that when a pack o\u0027 women made up their minds to[Pg 153] pave, they\u0027d pave if it was to pave—some place that Eppleby hadn\u0027t ought to \u0027a\u0027 mentioned; an\u0027 he was goin\u0027 to be on the pavin\u0027 side. But then, Eppleby is the gentlest husband in Friendship Village, an\u0027 known to be. \"Sodality met special next day, not so much to do anything as to let it be known that we\u0027d took action. This we done by votin\u0027 to lay low till such time as we could order the wooden blocks. We preferred to pave peaceable, it bein\u0027 hot weather. \"Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Mayor Uppers an\u0027 I walked home together from that meetin\u0027. It was a blisterin\u0027 July afternoon—one of them afternoons that melts itself out flat, same as a dropped pepp\u0027mint on a brick walk, an\u0027 you\u0027re left stickin\u0027 in it helpless as a fly, an\u0027 generally buzzin\u0027. I rec\u0027lect we was buzzin\u0027—comin\u0027 down Daphne Street in that chokin\u0027 dust an\u0027 no pavement. \"\u0027It\u0027s a dog\u0027s life, livin\u0027 in a little town—in some respects,\u0027 I remember Mis\u0027 Sykes says. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, tolerant, \u0027I know. I know it is. But I\u0027d rather live in a little town an\u0027 dog it out than go up to the city an\u0027 turn wolf, same as some.\u0027 \"An\u0027 yet we all felt the same, every one of us. They ain\u0027t a woman livin\u0027 in a little place that don\u0027t feel the same, now and again. It\u0027s quiet an\u0027 it\u0027s[Pg 154] easy housework, an\u0027 you get to know folks well. But oh, none of it what you might say glitters. An\u0027 they ain\u0027t no woman whatever—no matter how good a wife an\u0027 mother an\u0027 Christian an\u0027 even housekeeper she is—that don\u0027t, \u0027way down deep in her heart, feel that hankerin\u0027 after some sort o\u0027 glitter. \"So it was natural enough that we should draw up at Lyddy\u0027s dressmakin\u0027 window an\u0027 rest ourself. An\u0027 that afternoon we\u0027d have done so, anyway, for she hed been pinnin\u0027 up her new summer plates—Lyddy don\u0027t believe in rushin\u0027 the season. An\u0027 no sooner had we got a good look at \u0027em—big coloured sheets they was, with full-length pictures—than Mis\u0027 Toplady leaned \u0027way forward, her hands on her knees, an\u0027 stood lookin\u0027 at \u0027em the way you look at the parade. \"\u0027Well, look-a-there,\u0027 she says. \u0027Look at that one.\u0027 \"The one she meant was a woman with her hair all plaited an\u0027 fringed an\u0027 cut bias, an\u0027 with a little white hat o\u0027 lilacs \u0027bout as big as a cork; an\u0027 her dress—my land! Her dress was long an\u0027 rill light blue, an\u0027 seemed like it must have been paper, it was so fancy. It didn\u0027t seem like cloth goods at all, same as we hed on. It was more like we was wearin\u0027 meat an\u0027 vegetable dresses, an\u0027 this dress was dessert—all whipped cream an\u0027 pink sugar an\u0027 a flower on the plate. [Pg 155] \"\u0027Dear land!\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, lookin\u0027 \u0027round at us strange, \u0027do they do it when they get gray hair? I didn\u0027t know they done it when their hair was gray.\u0027 \"We all looked, an\u0027 sure enough, the woman\u0027s hair was white. \u0027Afternoon Toilette for Elderly Woman,\u0027 it said underneath, plain as plain. Always before the plates hed all been young an\u0027 smilin\u0027 an\u0027 party-seemin\u0027, an\u0027 we\u0027d thought of all that as past an\u0027 done for, with us, along with all the other things that didn\u0027t come true. But here was a woman grayer than any of us, an\u0027 yet lookin\u0027 as live as if she\u0027d been wearin\u0027 a housework dress. \"\u0027Why,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes, starin\u0027, \u0027that must be a new thing this season. I never heard of a woman well along in years wearin\u0027 anything but brown or navy blue or gray,—besides black.\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes is terribly dressy, but even she never yet got anywheres inside the rainbow, except in a bow at the chin. \"\u0027My,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss, wistful, \u0027wouldn\u0027t it seem like heaven to be able to wear colours without bein\u0027 talked about?\u0027 \"An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Mayor Uppers—her that her husband grew well off bein\u0027 mayor, an\u0027 never\u0027d been back to Friendship Village since he was put out of office, she says low:— \"\u0027You ladies that has husbands to keep thinkin\u0027[Pg 156] well of you, I should think you\u0027d think about this thing. Men,\u0027 she says, \u0027loves the light shades.\u0027 \"At that Mis\u0027 Toplady turned around on us, an\u0027 we see her eyes expressin\u0027 i-dees. \"\u0027Ladies,\u0027 says she, impressive, \u0027Mis\u0027 Uppers is right. We hadn\u0027t ought to talk back or show mad. We ladies of the Sodality had ought to be able to get our own way peaceable, just by takin\u0027 it, the way the Lord give women the weapons to do.\u0027 \"We see that somethin\u0027 was seethin\u0027 in her mind, but we couldn\u0027t work our way to what it was. \"\u0027Ladies,\u0027 says she, an\u0027 stepped up on the wooden step to Lyddy\u0027s dressmakin\u0027 shop, \u0027has the husbands of any one of us seen us, for twenty years, dressed in the light shades?\u0027 \"I didn\u0027t hev any husband to answer for, but I could truthfully say of the rest that you\u0027d think black an\u0027 brown an\u0027 gray an\u0027 navy had exhausted the Lord\u0027s ingenuity, for all the attention they\u0027d paid to any other colour He\u0027d wove with. \"\u0027Let\u0027s the Sodality get up an evenin\u0027 party, an\u0027 hev it in post-office hall, an\u0027 invite our husbands an\u0027 buy new dresses—light shades an\u0027 some lace,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, lettin\u0027 the i-dee drag her along, main strength. \"Mis\u0027 Sykes was studyin\u0027 the fashion-plate hungry, but she stopped an\u0027 stepped up side o\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady. [Pg 157] \"\u0027Well, sir,\u0027 she said, \u0027I donno but \u0027twould help us to work the pavin\u0027 of Daphne Street. Why, Silas Sykes, for one, is right down soft-hearted about clothes. He always notices which one of their waists the choir\u0027s got on. I heard him say once he wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to church again till they bought somethin\u0027 new.\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Holcomb nodded. \u0027Five years ago,\u0027 she said, \u0027I went up to the city with Eppleby. An\u0027 I saw him turn around to look after a woman. I\u0027ll never forget the sensation it give me—like I was married to a man that wasn\u0027t my husband. The woman had on a light pink dress. I know I come home an\u0027 bought a pink collar; I didn\u0027t think I could go any farther, because she was quite young. Do you s\u0027pose....\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Toplady pointed at Lyddy\u0027s fashion-plate. \u0027I should go,\u0027 she says, \u0027just as far as my money would let me go.\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Uppers stood lookin\u0027 down to the walk. \u0027The mayor,\u0027 she says—she calls him \u0027the mayor\u0027 yet—\u0027was terrible fond o\u0027 coloured neckties. He was rill partial to green ones. Mebbe I didn\u0027t think enough about what that meant....\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Toplady came down off the step. \u0027Every man is alike,\u0027 says she, decided. \u0027Most of us Friendship ladies thinks if we give \u0027em a clean roller towel we\u0027ve done enough towards makin\u0027 things pretty;[Pg 158] an\u0027 I think it\u0027s time, as wives, we took advantage of the styles.\u0027 \"\u0027An\u0027,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Sykes, the president, rill dreamy for her, but firm, \u0027I think so, too.\u0027 \"I tell you, we all walked home feelin\u0027 like we\u0027d hed a present—me too, though I knew very well I couldn\u0027t hev a light dress, an\u0027 I didn\u0027t hev any husband. You start out thinkin\u0027 them are the two principal things, but you get a-hold o\u0027 some others, if you pay attention. Still, I judged the ladies was on the right track, for men is men, say what who will. All but Threat Hubbelthwait. We passed the hotel an\u0027 heard him settin\u0027 in there by the bar scrapin\u0027 away on \u0027Can A Little Child Like Me?\u0027 We took shame to him, an\u0027 yet I know we all looked at each other sort of motherly, like he was some little shaver, same as he sung, an\u0027 performin\u0027 most fool. \"It don\u0027t take us ladies long to do things, when our minds is made. Especially it don\u0027t when Mis\u0027 Timothy Toplady is chairman of the Entertainment Committee, or the Doin\u0027 Committee of whatever happens, like she was that time. First, we found out they was plenty enough nun\u0027s veilin\u0027 in the post-office store, cheap an\u0027 wide an\u0027 in stock an\u0027 all the light shades; an\u0027 I bought all the dresses, noons, of the clerk, so Silas wouldn\u0027t suspect—me not hevin\u0027 any husband to inquire around,[Pg 159] like they do. Then we hired the post-office hall, vague, without sayin\u0027 for what—an\u0027 that pleased Silas that gets the rent. An\u0027 then we give the invitations, spectacular, through the Friendship Daily to the Sodality\u0027s husbands, for the next Tuesday night. We could do it that quick, not bein\u0027 dependent on dressmakers same as some. The ladies was all goin\u0027 to make their dresses themselves, an\u0027 the dresses wa\u0027n\u0027t much to do to make. Nobody bothered a very great deal about how we should make \u0027em, the principal thing bein\u0027 the colour; Mis\u0027 Toplady\u0027s was blue, like the fashion-plate; Mis\u0027 Holcomb\u0027s pink, like the woman in the city; Mis\u0027 Uppers\u0027 green, like the mayor\u0027s necktie, an\u0027 so on. I made me up a dress out o\u0027 the spare-room curtains—white, with a little blue flower in it, an\u0027 a new blue ribbon belt. But Mis\u0027 Sykes, she went to work an\u0027 rented a dress from the city, for that one night. That much she give out about it, an\u0027 would give out no more. That woman loves a surprise. She\u0027s got a rill pleasant mind, Mis\u0027 Sykes has, but one that does enjoy jerkin\u0027 other people\u0027s minds up, an most anything\u0027ll do for the string. \"For all we thought we hed so much time, an\u0027 it was so easy to do, the afternoon o\u0027 the party we went \u0027most crazy. We\u0027d got up quite a nice little cold supper—Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait had helped us, she bein\u0027 still at large, an\u0027 Threat fiddlin\u0027. We planned[Pg 160] meat loaf an\u0027 salad an\u0027 pickles an\u0027 jelly, an\u0027 scalloped potatoes for the hot dish, an\u0027 ice cream an\u0027 cake, enough in all for thirty folks: fifteen husbands an\u0027 fifteen Sodality, or approximatish. An\u0027 we planned to go to the hall in the afternoon an\u0027 take our dresses there, an\u0027 sly em\u0027 up and leave \u0027em, an\u0027 put \u0027em on after we\u0027d got there that night, so\u0027s nobody\u0027s husbands should suspect. But when we all came in the afternoon, an\u0027 the decoratin\u0027 with greens an\u0027 festoons of cut paper an\u0027 all was to do, there Mis\u0027 Toplady, that was to make scalloped potatoes, hadn\u0027t got her sleeves in yet, an\u0027 she was down to the hall tryin\u0027 to do both; an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Holcomb, that was to make the salad dressing, had got so nervous over her collar that she couldn\u0027t tell which edge she\u0027d cut for the top. But the rest of us was ready, an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s dress had come from the city, an\u0027 we all, Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 Mame too, hed our dresses in boxes in the post-office hall kitchen cupboards. An\u0027 we done the decoratin\u0027, an\u0027 it looked rill lovely, with the long tables laid ready at each side, an\u0027 room for bein\u0027 a party left in between \u0027em. \"Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Holcomb left the hall about five o\u0027clock to go home an\u0027 lay out Silas\u0027s an\u0027 Timothy\u0027s an\u0027 Eppleby\u0027s best clothes for \u0027em—the rest hed done it at noon. Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait was goin\u0027 over to the hotel to get some dishes out, an\u0027 I went with her to help. The bar[Pg 161] was to the back, where Threat set an\u0027 slep\u0027 an\u0027 fiddled, an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait was goin\u0027 to slip in still an\u0027 sly the dishes out to me. A good many of the hotel dishes was her individual weddin\u0027 presents, so she didn\u0027t think wrong of her conscience. \"We was all five hurryin\u0027 along together, rehearsin\u0027 all we\u0027d got to do before six-thirty, when we heard a funny sound. We listened, an\u0027 we thought they must be testin\u0027 the hose. But when we got to Lyddy\u0027s shop, where the street kitters off some in a curve, we looked ahead an\u0027 we see it wasn\u0027t that. \"It\u0027s an automobile,\" says Mis\u0027 Toplady. \u0027My land,\u0027 she says, \u0027it ain\u0027t only one. It\u0027s two.\u0027 \"An\u0027 we see it was. There come the two of \u0027em, ploughin\u0027 along through the awful sand of Daphne Street, that was fit for no human locomotive, unless ostriches. When the Proudfits are here, that\u0027s the only one in the village with an automobile, they understand the sand, and they\u0027d put on the whole steam and tear right along through it. But strangers would go careful, for fear they\u0027d get stuck, an\u0027 so they got it, like you do. An\u0027 them two big red cars was comin\u0027 slow, the dust like cloaks an\u0027 curtains billowin\u0027 up behind. They looked quite wild, includin\u0027 the seven folks in each one that was laughin\u0027 an\u0027 callin\u0027 out. An\u0027 by the time they\u0027d come up to us, us four ladies of the Sodality an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait was lined up on the walk watchin\u0027 \u0027em. They[Pg 162] stopped an\u0027 one of \u0027em hailed us, leanin\u0027 past his driver. \"\u0027I beg your pardon,\u0027 he says, \u0027is this the street to the best hotel?\u0027 \"It was Mis\u0027 Toplady that answered him, rill collected. \u0027They\u0027s only one street in town,\u0027 says she, \u0027an\u0027 they\u0027s only one hotel, an\u0027 that they ain\u0027t now.\u0027 \"\u0027Can you tell me how soon there will be one?\u0027 says the man. \u0027By dinner-time, I hope.\u0027 \"We all felt kind of delicate about answerin\u0027 this, an\u0027 so Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait herself spoke up. \u0027Threat\u0027s drunk an\u0027 fiddlin\u0027, she says. \u0027They\u0027s no tellin\u0027 when Friendship Village will ever hev a hotel again.\u0027 \"Both automobiles was listenin\u0027 by then, an\u0027 though some of \u0027em laughed out sort o\u0027 rueful, not many of \u0027em see the funny. \"\u0027Gad,\u0027 one of the men says, \u0027how about the bird an\u0027 the bottle we were to send back to Bonner, sittin\u0027 by his tire in the desert, a ways back? Don\u0027t tell us there\u0027s no place,\u0027 he says, \u0027where we can find dinner, twenty-one of us and the three chauf—\u0027 that word. \"Mis\u0027 Toplady shook her head. \u0027They ain\u0027t a place big enough to seat twenty-one, even if they was the food to feed \u0027em—\u0027 she begun, an\u0027 then she stopped an\u0027 looked \u0027round at us, as though she was thinkin\u0027 somethin\u0027. [Pg 163] \"\u0027Oh, come now,\u0027 says the man,—he was good-lookin\u0027 an\u0027 young, an\u0027 merry-seemin\u0027,—\u0027Oh, come now,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am sure that the ladies of Friendship could cook things such as never man yet ate. We are sta-arving,\u0027 he says, humorous. \u0027Can\u0027t you do something for us? We\u0027ll give you,\u0027 he winds up, genial, \u0027two dollars a plate for a good, home-cooking dinner for the twenty-four of us. What do you say?\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Toplady whirled toward us sort o\u0027 wild. \u0027Is two dollars times twenty-four, forty-eight dollars?\u0027 says she, low. \"An\u0027 we see it was, though Mis\u0027 Holcomb was still figurin\u0027 it out in the palm of her other hand, while we stood gettin\u0027 glances out of each other\u0027s eyes, an\u0027 sendin\u0027 \u0027em, give for take. We see, quick as a flash, what Mis\u0027 Toplady was thinkin\u0027 about. An\u0027 it was about that hall, all festooned with greens an\u0027 cut paper, an\u0027 the two long tables laid ready, an\u0027 the veal loaf an\u0027 scalloped potatoes an\u0027 ice-cream for thirty. An\u0027 when Mis\u0027 Sykes, that usually speaks, stood still, an\u0027 didn\u0027t say one word, but just nodded a little bit, sort o\u0027 sad, Mis\u0027 Toplady, that was chairman o\u0027 the Entertainment Committee, done like she does sometimes—she took the whole thing into her own hands an\u0027 just settled it. \"\u0027Why, yes,\u0027 she says to \u0027em, rill pleasant, \u0027if you want to come up to post-office hall at half-past[Pg 164] six,\u0027 she says, \u0027the Friendship Married Ladies\u0027 Cemetery Improvement Sodality will serve you your supper, nice as the nicest, for two dollars a head.\u0027 \"\u0027Good!\u0027 the men all sings out, an\u0027 the women spats their hands soft, an\u0027 one of \u0027em says somethin\u0027 to the merry-seemin\u0027 man. \"\u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he says then, \u0027couldn\u0027t we all break into this hotel an\u0027 floss up a bit before dinner?\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait stepped out towards \u0027em. \"\u0027I was thinkin\u0027 of that,\u0027 says she. \u0027My husband,\u0027 she says, dignified, \u0027is settin\u0027 in the bar—practisin\u0027 his violin. He—he does that sometimes, an\u0027 we—don\u0027t bother him. But the bar is at the back. I can let you in, still, the front way to the rooms, if you want. An\u0027 I\u0027ll be there myself to wait on you.\u0027 \"An\u0027 that was what they done, somebody takin\u0027 one o\u0027 the cars back for the other car, an\u0027 the rest of us fair breakin\u0027 into a run toward post-office hall. \"\u0027My land,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, almost like a groan, \u0027what hev we done?\u0027 \"It was a funny thing to do, we see it afterward. But I tell you, you can\u0027t appreciate the influence o\u0027 that forty-eight dollars unless you\u0027ve tried to earn money in a town the size o\u0027 Friendship Village. Sodality hardly ever made more than five dollars to its ten-cent entertainments—an\u0027 that for a big turn-out on a dry night. An\u0027 here was the price[Pg 165] of about nine such entertainments give us outright, an\u0027 no extra work, an\u0027 rill feet-achin\u0027 weather. I say it was more than flesh an\u0027 blood or wives could stand. We done it automatic, like you contradict when it\u0027s necessary. \"But there was the men to reckon with. \"\u0027What\u0027ll Timothy—an\u0027 Silas—an\u0027 Eppleby....\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady says, an\u0027 stops, some bothered an\u0027 some rill pained. \"I judged, not havin\u0027 any husband to be doin\u0027 the inquirin\u0027, it wasn\u0027t polite for me to laugh. But I couldn\u0027t hardly help it, thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 them fifteen hungry men an\u0027 the supper et away from \u0027em, just William Nilly. \"Mis\u0027 Sykes, we remembered afterwards, never said a word, but only kep\u0027 up with us back to the hall. \"Back to the hall, where the rest o\u0027 the Sodality was, we told \u0027em what we\u0027d done—beginnin\u0027 with the forty-eight dollars, like some kind o\u0027 weapon. But I tell you, we hadn\u0027t reckoned without knowin\u0027 our hostesses, head an\u0027 heart. An\u0027 they went in pell mell, pleased an\u0027 glad as we was, an\u0027 plannin\u0027 like mad. \"The first need was more food to make up that supper to somewheres near two dollars\u0027 worth—feedin\u0027 your husband is one thing an\u0027 gettin\u0027 up a two-dollar meal is another. But we collected that[Pg 166] all in pretty sudden: leg o\u0027 lamb, left from the Holcombs\u0027 dinner an\u0027 only cut off of one side; the Sykes\u0027s roast o\u0027 veal, the same; three chickens for soup the Libertys hed just dressed for next day company dinner; big platter of devilled eggs chipped in from Mis\u0027 Toplady; a jar o\u0027 doughnuts, a steamer o\u0027 cookies, a fruit-cake a year old—we just made out our list an\u0027 scattered to empty out all our pantries. \"By six o\u0027clock we was back in the hall, an\u0027 all the food with us. But nobody hed met nobody\u0027s husband yet, an\u0027 nobody wanted to. We didn\u0027t quite know how we was goin\u0027 to do, I guess—but done is done, an\u0027 to do takes care of itself. \"\u0027Hadn\u0027t we ought to \u0027a\u0027 sent word to the men?\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Holcomb, for the third or fourth time. \u0027I sneaked around so\u0027s not to pass Eppleby\u0027s office, but I declare I feel mean. He\u0027ll hev to eat sauce an\u0027 plain bread-an\u0027-butter for his supper. An\u0027 most o\u0027 the men-folks the same. \u0027Seems though somebody\u0027d ought to send \u0027em word an\u0027 not let \u0027em come up here, all washed an\u0027 dressed.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, cuttin\u0027 cake with her lips shut tight an\u0027 talkin\u0027 anyway, \u0027I kind o\u0027 thought—leave \u0027em come up. I bet they\u0027d rather be in it than out of it, every one of \u0027em, an\u0027 who knows they might be some supper left? An\u0027 we can all—\u0027 [Pg 167] \"An\u0027 at that Mis\u0027 Toplady faces round from cuttin\u0027 the cake: \u0027My land, my land,\u0027 she says, sort o\u0027 hushed, \u0027why, doin\u0027 this, we can\u0027t none of us wear our new dresses!\u0027 \"An\u0027 at that we looked at each other, each one sort of accusin\u0027, an\u0027 I guess all our hearts givin\u0027 one o\u0027 them sickish thumps. An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes, her that hed been so still, snaps back:— \"\u0027I wondered what you thought I\u0027d rented my dress from the city for at Three Dollars a night.\u0027 \"I tell you, that made a hush in the middle of the plannin\u0027. We\u0027d forgot all about our own dresses, an\u0027 that was bad enough, with the hall all hired an\u0027 everything all ready, an\u0027 every chance in the world of everybody\u0027s husband\u0027s findin\u0027 out about the dresses before we could get up another Sodality party, same way. But here was Mis\u0027 Sykes, three dollars out, an mebbe wouldn\u0027t be able to rent her dress again at all. \"\u0027I did want Silas,\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes says then, wistful, \u0027to see me in that dress. Silas an\u0027 I have been married so long,\u0027 she says, \u0027that I often wonder if I seem like a person to him at all. But in that dress from the city, I think I would.\u0027 \"We was each an\u0027 all ready to cry, an\u0027 I dunno but we would hev done it—though we was all ready to serve, too: coffee made, potatoes pipin\u0027 hot, veal an\u0027 lamb het up an\u0027 smellin\u0027 rich, chicken[Pg 168] soup steamin\u0027, an\u0027 all. But just that very minute we heard some of \u0027em comin\u0027 in the hall—an\u0027 the one \u0027ready\u0027 conquered the other \u0027ready,\u0027 like it will, an\u0027 we all made a rush, part curious an\u0027 part nerves, to peek through the little servin\u0027 window from the kitchen. \"What do you think we saw? It was the automobile folks, hungry an\u0027 got there first. In they\u0027d come, women laughin\u0027, men jokin\u0027, all makin\u0027 a lark out o\u0027 the whole thing. An\u0027 if the women wasn\u0027t, every last one of \u0027em, wearin\u0027—not the clothes they hed come in, but light pink an\u0027 light blue an\u0027 white an\u0027 flowered things, an\u0027 all like that. \"Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait burst in on us while we was lookin\u0027. \u0027They hed things in their trunk at the back o\u0027 the automobile,\u0027 says she. \u0027They says they wanted to floss up for dinner, an\u0027 floss up they hev. They look like Lyddy\u0027s fashion sheets, one an\u0027 all.\u0027 \"At that Mis\u0027 Sykes, a-ceasin\u0027 to peek, she drops her tray on the bare floor an\u0027 begun untyin\u0027 her apron. \u0027Quick!\u0027 she raps out, \u0027Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait, you go an\u0027 set \u0027em down. An\u0027 every one o\u0027 you—into them togs of ours! Here\u0027s the chance to wear \u0027em—here an\u0027 now,\u0027 she says, \u0027an\u0027 leave them folks see we know how to do things here in Friendship Village as good as the best.\u0027 [Pg 169] \"Well, bein\u0027 as she had rented the dress, an\u0027 three dollars hed to be paid out anyhow, an\u0027 bein\u0027 as she was president, an\u0027 bein\u0027 as we was all hankerin\u0027 in our hearts, we didn\u0027t need much urgin\u0027. We slammed the servin\u0027 window shut an\u0027 set chairs against both doors, an\u0027 we whisked out of our regular dresses like wild. \"\u0027Oh, land—my land, the sleeves—the sleeves ain\u0027t in mine!\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, sort o\u0027 glazed, an\u0027 speakin\u0027 in a wail. But we encouraged her up to pin \u0027em in, which she done, an\u0027 it couldn\u0027t be told from stitches. Poor Mame Holcomb\u0027s collar that wasn\u0027t on yet we turned in for her V-shape, so\u0027s her dress was low, like the best. An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Uppers, that was seasonin\u0027 the chicken soup like none of us could, her we took turns in dressin\u0027 in her green. An\u0027 I\u0027d got into my spare-room curtains, somehow, just as Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait come shoving at that door. \"\u0027The men—the men!\u0027 says she, painful. \u0027They\u0027re all out here—Silas an\u0027 Timothy an\u0027 Eppleby an\u0027 all. They\u0027ve all heard about it—the automobiles went to the post-office for their mail, an\u0027 Silas told \u0027em enjoyable about Threat, an\u0027 the automobiles told him where they was goin\u0027 to eat. An\u0027 they\u0027ve come, thinkin\u0027 they\u0027s enough for all, an\u0027 they\u0027re out here now.\u0027 \"Mis\u0027 Toplady groaned a little, agonized an\u0027[Pg 170] stifled, but rill firm. \u0027Tell \u0027em, then,\u0027 says she, \u0027to come back up here, like men, an\u0027 help.\u0027 \"Then we heard a little rustle, soft an\u0027 silky an\u0027 kind o\u0027 pink-soundin\u0027, an\u0027 we looked around, an\u0027 there, from where she had been dressin\u0027 herself over behind the kitchen boiler all alone, Mis\u0027 Postmaster Sykes stepped out. My land, if she wasn\u0027t in a white dress, a little low in the neck, an\u0027 elbow sleeves, an\u0027 all covered solid as crust with glitterin\u0027 silver spangles. \"\u0027Let\u0027s tell \u0027em ourselves,\u0027 she says, \u0027come on—all of you. Let\u0027s take out the first course, an\u0027 tell the men what we want \u0027em to do.\u0027 \"We made Mis\u0027 Sykes go first, carryin\u0027 high the tureen of chicken soup. An\u0027 on one side of her walked Mis\u0027 Timothy Toplady, in blue, with the wafers, an\u0027 on the other Mis\u0027 Holcomb-that-was-Mame-Bliss, in pink, with the radishes. An\u0027 neither one of \u0027em could hardly help lookin\u0027 at Mis\u0027 Sykes\u0027s dress all the way out. An\u0027 back of \u0027em went the rest o\u0027 the ladies, all in pink an\u0027 blue an\u0027 white an\u0027 pale green nun\u0027s veilin\u0027 that they\u0027d made, an\u0027 carryin\u0027 the water-pitchers an\u0027 ice an\u0027 celery an\u0027 like that. An\u0027 me, I hung back in the kitchen watchin\u0027 an\u0027 lovin\u0027 \u0027em every one—an\u0027 almost lovin\u0027 Timothy Toplady an\u0027 Silas Sykes an\u0027 Eppleby when they looked on an\u0027 saw. \"Mis\u0027 Sykes set the soup down in front o\u0027 the[Pg 171] merry-seemin\u0027 man for him to serve it. An\u0027 then she crossed over an\u0027 spoke to Silas, an\u0027 swep\u0027 up ahead of him in that spangly dress, the other ladies followin\u0027 an\u0027 noddin\u0027 bright when they passed the men, an\u0027 motionin\u0027 \u0027em toward the back o\u0027 the hall. An\u0027 back the men all come into the kitchen, followin\u0027 as they was asked to do, an\u0027 orderly through bein\u0027 dazed. Silas an\u0027 Timothy an\u0027 Eppleby was first, an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes an\u0027 Mis\u0027 Toplady an\u0027 Mame went up to \u0027em together. \"I\u0027ll never forget that minute. I thought the men was goin\u0027 to burst out characteristic an\u0027 the whole time be tart, an\u0027 I shut both doors an\u0027 the servin\u0027 window careful. An\u0027 instead o\u0027 that, them three men stood there just smilin\u0027 a little an lookin\u0027 surprised an\u0027 agreeable; an\u0027 the other husbands, either takin\u0027 the cue or feelin\u0027 the same, done likewise, too. An\u0027 when Mame Bliss says, sort o\u0027 tremblin\u0027—Eppleby bein\u0027 the gentlest husband in Friendship Village, an\u0027 known to be: \u0027How do you like us, Eppleby?\u0027 Eppleby just nods an\u0027 wrinkles up his eyes an\u0027 smiles at her, like he meant lots more. An\u0027 he says, \u0027Why didn\u0027t you never wear that dress before, Mame?\u0027 \"An\u0027 \u0027Well, Timothy?\u0027 says Mis\u0027 Toplady, sort o\u0027 masterful, an\u0027 fully expectin\u0027 to hev to master. But Timothy Toplady, he just rubs his hands an\u0027 looks at her sort o\u0027 wonderin\u0027, an\u0027 he says, \u0027Blisterin\u0027[Pg 172] Benson, you look as good as the city folks, Amandy—all light, an\u0027 loose made, an\u0027 stylish—\u0027 \"But Silas Sykes, he just stood lookin\u0027 at his wife an\u0027 lookin\u0027. Of course she did hev the advantage, bein\u0027 her spangles shone so. An\u0027 Silas looked at her an\u0027 looked, just as if her bein\u0027 his wife didn\u0027t make him admire her any the less. An\u0027 Mis\u0027 Sykes, she was rill pink an\u0027 pleased an\u0027 breathless, an\u0027 I guess she could see she seemed like a person to Silas, the way she\u0027d wanted to. \"It all went off splendid. The men stayed an\u0027 dished in the kitchen an\u0027 helped carry away from the tables—the forty-eight dollars completin\u0027 their respect—an\u0027 we ladies done the servin\u0027. An\u0027 I tell you, we served \u0027em with an air, \u0027count o\u0027 bein\u0027 well dressed, like they was, an\u0027 knowin\u0027 it. An\u0027 we knew the automobile folks appreciated it—we could tell by the way they kep\u0027 lookin\u0027 at us. But of course we all understood Mis\u0027 Sykes looked the best, an\u0027 we let her do all the most prominent things—bringin\u0027 in the first dish of everything an\u0027 like that, so\u0027s they could hev a good look. \"When it was over, the merry-seemin\u0027 man stood up an\u0027 made a little speech o\u0027 thanks, rill courteous an\u0027 sweet, an\u0027 like he knew how to act. An\u0027 when he was through we, one an\u0027 all, nudged Mis\u0027 Sykes to reply, an\u0027 she done so, the two tables[Pg 173] listenin\u0027, an\u0027 the Sodality standin\u0027 in between, an\u0027 the Sodality\u0027s husbands crowdin\u0027 in both kitchen doors to listen. \"Mis\u0027 Sykes says, rill dignified, an\u0027 the light catchin\u0027 in her spangles: \u0027We\u0027re all very much obliged, I\u0027m sure, for our forty-eight dollars clear. An\u0027 we think perhaps you\u0027d like to know what the money is goin\u0027 toward. It\u0027s goin\u0027,\u0027 she says, \u0027towards the pavin\u0027 of the main street of our little city.\u0027 \"Silas Sykes was lookin\u0027 out the servin\u0027 window like it was a box. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 says he, more of him comin\u0027 out of the window, \u0027what\u0027s that you say?\u0027 \"An\u0027 they was a little wave o\u0027 moves an\u0027 murmurs all around him like when somethin\u0027 is goin\u0027 to happen an\u0027 nobody knows what; an\u0027 I know the Sodality caught its breath, for, as Mis\u0027 Toplady always says, the dear land knows what men will do. \"With that up springs the merry-seemin\u0027 man, his face all beamin\u0027, an\u0027 he says loud an\u0027 clear an\u0027 drowndin\u0027 out everything else: \u0027Hear, hear! Likewise, here an\u0027 now. I move that we as one man, an\u0027 that man\u0027s automobile having lately come up the main street of Friendship Village—do ourself contribute to this most worthy end. Get to work,\u0027 says he. \u0027Think civic thoughts!\u0027 \"He slid the last roll off its plate, an\u0027 he laid somethin\u0027 in paper money on it, an\u0027 he started it[Pg 174] down the table. An\u0027 every man of \u0027em done as he done. An\u0027 I tell you, when we see Mis\u0027 Hubbelthwait\u0027s bread plate pilin\u0027 with bills, an\u0027 knew what it was for, we couldn\u0027t help—the whole Sodality couldn\u0027t help—steppin\u0027 forwards, close to the table, an\u0027 standin\u0027 there an\u0027 holdin\u0027 our breaths. An\u0027 the men, back there in the kitchen, they hushed up when they see the money, an\u0027 they kep\u0027 hushed. Land, land, it was a great minute!
