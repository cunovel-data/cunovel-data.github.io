{"id":34681,"no":3,"title":"III MIGGY","content":"I have never heard the chimes of Westminster cathedral, but when some time they do sound for me I shall find in them something all my own. For the old rosewood clock which has told time for me these many years is possessed of a kind of intelligence because its maker gave to it the Westminster chimes. Thus, though the clock must by patient ticking teach the rhythm of duration until the secret monotony of rhythm is confessed, it has also its high tides of life, rhythmic, too, and at every quarter hour fills a kind of general creative office: four notes for the quarter, eight for the half, twelve for the three-quarters, sixteen for the hour, and then the deep Amen of the strokes. At twelve o\u0027clock it swells richly to its zenith of expression and almost says something else. Through even the organ fulness of the cathedral bells I shall hear the tingling melody of the rosewood clock chimes, for their sweet incidence has been to me both matins and lullaby and often trembles within my sleep. I have the clock always[Pg 34] with me. It is a little voice-friend, it is one of those half folk, like flowers and the wind and an open fireplace and a piano, which are a frail, semi-born race, wistful of complete life, but as yet only partly overlapping our own sphere. These fascinate me almost as much as the articulate. That was why, when my little maid Elfa had brought me the summons to-day, I stood on the threshold and in some satisfaction watched Miggy, rapt before my clock in its musical maximum of noon. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miggy is as thin as a bough, and her rather large head is swept by an ungovernable lot of fine brown hair. Her face was turned from me, and she was wearing a high-necked gingham apron faded to varying values of brown and faint purple and violet of a quite surprising beauty. When the last stroke ceased, she turned to me as if I had been there all the time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish I could hear it do that again,\" she said, standing where she had stood, arms folded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will, perhaps, to-morrow,\" I answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Truly, if it was to be Miggy, then she would hear the chimes to-morrow and to-morrow; and as she turned, my emotion of finality increased. I have never loved the tribe of the Headlongs, though I am very sorry for any one who has not had with them an occasional innocent tribal junket; but I hold that through our intuitions, we may become[Pg 35] a kind of apotheosis of the Headlongs. Who of us has not chosen a vase, a chair, a rug, by some motive transcending taste, by the bidding of a friendly-faithful monitor who, somewhere inside one, nodded a choice which we obeyed? And yet a vase is a dead thing with no little seeking tentacles that catch and cling, while in choosing the living it is that one\u0027s friendly-faithful monitor is simply recognizing the monitor of the other person. I, for one, am more and more willing to trust these two to avow their own. For I think that this monitor is, perhaps, that silent Custodian whom, if ever I can win through her elusiveness, I shall know to be myself. As the years pass I trust her more and more. I find that we like the same people, she and I! And instantly we both liked Miggy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miggy stood regarding me intently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw you go past the Brevy\u0027s yesterday, where the crape is on the door,\" she observed; \"I thought it was you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I wonder at the precision with which very little people and very big people brush aside the minor conventions and do it in such ways that one nature is never mistaken for the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The girl who died there was your friend, then?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" Miggy said; \"I just knew her to speak to. And she didn\u0027t always bother her head to[Pg 36] speak to me. I just went in there yesterday morning to get the feeling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon. To get—what?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Miggy, \"you know when you look at a corpse you can always sense your own breath better—like it was something alive inside you. That\u0027s why I never miss seeing one if I can help. It\u0027s the only time I\u0027m real glad I\u0027m living.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As I motioned her to the chair and took my own, I felt a kind of weariness. The neurotics, I do believe, are of us all the nearest to the truth about things, but as I grow older I find myself getting to take a surpassing comfort in the normal. Or rather, I am always willing to have the normal thrust upon me, but my neurotics I wish to select for myself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My neighbour tells me,\" I said merely, \"that she thinks you should be my secretary.\" (It is a big word for the office, but a little hill is still a hill.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so, too,\" said Miggy, simply, \"I was afraid you wouldn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you ever been anybody\u0027s secretary?\" I continued. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never,\" said Miggy. \"I never saw anybody before that had a secretary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But something must have made her think you would do,\" I suggested. \"And what made you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" Miggy said, \"she thinks so because she[Pg 37] wants me to get ahead. And I think so because I generally think I can do anything—except mathematics. Has Secretary got any mathematics about it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not my secretary work,\" I told her, reviewing these extraordinary qualifications for duty; \"except counting the words on a page. You could do that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that!\" said Miggy. \"But if you told me to multiply two fractions you\u0027d never see me again, no matter how much I wanted to come back. Calliope Marsh says she\u0027s always expecting to find some folks\u0027 heads caved in on one side—same as red and blue balloons. If mine caved, it\u0027d be on the mathematics corner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I assured her that I never have a fraction in my house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll come,\" said Miggy, simply. \\n\\n \\n\\n But immediately she leaned forward with a look of anxiety, and her face was pointed and big-eyed, so that distress became a part of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said, \"I forgot. I meant to tell you first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it? Can you not come, after all?\" I inquired gravely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a drawback,\" said Miggy, soberly. \"A man\u0027s in love with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She linked her arms before her, a hand on either[Pg 38] shoulder—arms whose slenderness amazes me, though at the wrist they taper and in their extreme littleness are yet round. Because of this frailty she has a kind of little girl look which at that moment curiously moved me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who told you that?\" I asked abruptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About it being a drawback? Everybody \u0027most,\" said Miggy. \"They all laugh about us and act like it was a pity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment I felt a kind of anger as I felt it once when a woman said to me of a wife of many years whose first little child was coming, that she was \"in trouble.\" I own that,—save with my neighbour, and Calliope, and a few more whom I love—here in the village I miss the simple good breeding of the perception that nothing is nobler than the emotions, and the simple good taste of taking seriously love among its young. Taking it seriously, I say. Not, heaven forbid, taking it for granted, as do the cities. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Other things being equal, I prefer folk who are in love,\" I told Miggy. Though I observe that I instance a commercialization which I deplore by not insisting on this secretarial qualification to anything like the extent with which I insist on, say, spelling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miggy nodded—three little nods which seemed to settle everything. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll come,\" she repeated. \"Anyhow, it[Pg 39] isn\u0027t me that\u0027s in love at all. It\u0027s Peter. But of course I have to have some of the blame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So! It was, then, not \"all Peter with Miggy.\" Poor Peter. It must be a terrific problem to be a Peter to such a Miggy. I must have looked \"Poor Peter,\" because the girl\u0027s face took on its first smile. Such a smile as it was, brilliant, sparkling, occupying her features instead of informing them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t interfere much,\" she observed. \"He\u0027s in the cannery all day and then he practises violin and tinkers. I only see him one or two evenings a week; and I never think of him at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As my secretary,\" said I, \"you may make a mental note for me: remind me that I wish sometime to meet Peter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be real pleased,\" said Miggy, \"and real scared. Now about my being your secretary: do I have to take down everything you do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear child!\" I exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t I?\" said Miggy. \"Why, the Ladies\u0027 Aid has a secretary and she takes down every single thing the society does. I thought that was being one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I told her, as well as might be, what I should require of her—not by now, I own, with any particularity of idea that I had a secretary, but rather that I had surprisingly acquired a Miggy, who might be of use in many a little mechanical task. She listened,[Pg 40] and, when I had made an end, gave her three little nods; but her face fell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s just doing as you\u0027re told,\" she summed it up with a sigh. \"Everything is, ain\u0027t it? I thought maybe Secretary was doing your best.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is,\" I told her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she said positively, \"you can\u0027t do your best when you have to do just exactly what you\u0027re told. Your best tells you how to do itself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this na?ve putting of the personal equation which should play so powerful a part in the economics of toil I was minded to apologize for intending to interfere with set tasks in Miggy\u0027s possible duties with me. She had the truth, though: that the strong creative instinct is the chief endowment, primal as breath; for on it depend both life and the expression of life, the life of the race and the ultimate racial utterance. \\n\\n \\n\\n We talked on for a little, Miggy, I observed, having that royal indifference to time which, when it does not involve indifference to the time of other people, I delightedly commend. For myself, I can never understand why I should eat at one or sleep at eleven, if it is, as it often is, my one and my eleven and nobody else\u0027s. For, as between the clock and me alone, one and eleven and all other o\u0027clocks are mine and I am not theirs. But I have known men and women living in hotels who would[Pg 41] interrupt a sunset to go to dine, or wave away the stars in their courses to go to sleep, merely because the hour had struck. It must be in their blood, poor things, as descendants from the cell, to which time and space were the only considerations. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Miggy was leaving, she paused on the threshold with her first hint of shyness, a hint which I welcomed. I think that every one to whom I am permanently drawn must have in his nature a phase of shyness, even of unconquerable timidity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I shouldn\u0027t do things,\" Miggy said, \"like you\u0027re used to having them done—would you tell me? I know a few nice things to do and I do \u0027em. But I\u0027m always waking up in the night and thinking what a lot there must be that I do wrong. So if I do \u0027em wrong would you mind not just squirming and keeping still about \u0027em—but tell me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you, child, if there is need,\" I promised her. And I caught her smile—that faint, swift, solemn minute which sometimes reveals on a face the childlike wistfulness of every one of us, under the mask, to come as near as may be to the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n I own that when, just now, I turned from her leave-taking, I had that infrequent sense of emptiness-in-the-room which I have had usually only with those I love or with some rare being, all fire and spirit and idea, who has flamed in my presence[Pg 42] and died into departure. I cannot see why we do not feel this sense of emptiness whenever we leave one another. Would you not think that it would be so with us who live above the abyss and below the uttermost spaces? It is not so, and there are those from whose presence I long to be gone in a discomfort which is a kind of orison of my soul to my body to hurry away. It is so that I long to be gone from that little Mrs. Oliver Wheeler Johnson, and of this I am sorely ashamed. But I think that all such dissonance is merely a failure in method, and that the spirit of this business of being is that we long for one another to be near. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, in \"this world of visible images\" and patterns and schedules and o\u0027clocks, it is like stumbling on the true game to come on some one who is not on any dial. And I fancy that Miggy is no o\u0027clock. She is not Dawn o\u0027clock, because already she has lived so much; nor Noon o\u0027clock, because she is far from her high moment; nor is she Dusk o\u0027clock, because she is so poignantly alive. Rather, she is like the chimes of a clock—which do not tell the time, but which almost say something else. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1799/52241.html","bookId":1055,"book":{"id":1055,"title":"Friendship Village Love Stories","description":"简介： Although it is June, the Little Child about whom I shall sometimes write in these pages this morning brought me a few violets.
