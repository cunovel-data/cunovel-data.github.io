{"id":34695,"no":17,"title":"XVII ADOPTION","content":"The big window of my sitting room is an isle of sirens on whose shore many of my bird neighbours are continually coming to grief. For, from without, the window makes a place of soft skies and seductive leaves where any bird might think to wing a way. And in that mirrored deep there is that curious atmosphere which makes In-a-looking-glass a better thing than the room which it reflects—an elusive sense which Little Child might call Isn\u0027t-any-such-placeness. I think that I might call it so too. And so, evidently, the birds would call it, for they are always trying to find there some path of flight. \\n\\n \\n\\n A morning or two ago, when I heard against the pane the soft thud of an eager little body, I hurried out to see lying under the window an oriole. It was too terrible that it should have been an oriole. For days I had seen him hanging here and there, back downward, on this limb and that, and heard his full-throated note ringing from the innermost air, so that the deeps of air could never again be[Pg 275] wholly alien to me. And now he lay, his wings outstretched, his eyes dim, his breast hardly moving. I watched him, hoping for the breath to begin to flutter and labour. But though the great Nature was with him, herself passioning in all the little fibres to keep life pulsing on, yet her passion was not enough; and while I looked the little life went out. \\n\\n \\n\\n ... I held the tiny body in my hand, and it was almost as if the difference between living and not living slipped through my fingers and was gone. If only that one within me, who watches between the seeing and the knowing, had been a little quicker, I might almost have understood.... \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them little things go out like a match,\" said my neighbour. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was standing on the other side of the box hedge, and I caught a look on her face that I had seen there once or twice before, so that my heart had warmed to her; and now, because of that look, she fitted within the moment like the right word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It don\u0027t seem like anybody could mean \u0027em to die before their time,\" she said. \"Ain\u0027t it almost as if it happened when Everything somehow couldn\u0027t help it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was this, the tragedy of the Unfulfilled Intention, that was in my mind while I hollowed the[Pg 276] little grave under the hedge. And when we had finished, my neighbour, who had stepped informally over the box to help me, looked up with a return of that fleeting expression which I had noted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess we\u0027ve found one now for sure,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Found one?\" I puzzled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought you knew,\" she told me. \"I thought everybody knew—we\u0027ve been looking for one so long. For a baby.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She never had told me and no one had told me, but I loved her for thinking that all the world knew. There are abroad a multitude of these sweet suspicions as well as the sad misgivings of the hunted. She had simply let me know, that early morning in the garden, her sorrow that there was \"no little thing runnin\u0027 round.\" And now she told me for how long they had been trying to find one to adopt, consciously serving no social need, but simply hungering for a child whom they could \"take to.\" It was a story of fruitless visits to the homes in the city, the news sent of this little waif or that, all proving too old or of too sad an inheritance. To me it would seem that the more tragic the inheritance the more poignantly sounds the cry for foster-folk. And this may be extreme, I know, but virtue, I find, does not lie exclusively in the mean, either. It lies partly in one\u0027s taste in extremes. However,[Pg 277] this special extreme I find not generally believed in as I believe in it; and my neighbour, not sharing it, had waited on with empty arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now, after all the long hoping, she had found a baby—a baby who filled all the requirements and more. First of all, he was a boy; second, he was of healthful Scotch parentage; third, he was six weeks old; and, fondest I could see in my neighbour\u0027s heart, he was good to look at. When she told me this she produced, from beneath her apron, a broken picture post-card. The baby was lying on a white blanket spread on the grass, and he was looking up with the intentness of some little soul not yet embodied; or as if, having been born, some shadow-thing, left over from his source of shadows, yet detained his attention. \"William,\" it said beneath the picture. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I shall call him Kenneth,\" my neighbour said; \"I\u0027ve always meant to. I don\u0027t want he should be called after his father, being he isn\u0027t ours, you might say. But he is ours,\" she added in a kind of challenge. \"He\u0027s going after him to-morrow to the city\"—and now \"he\" meant her husband, in that fine habit of use by these husbands and wives of the two third persons singular to mean only each other, in a splendid, ultimate, inevitable sense, authentic as the \"we\" of a sovereign, no more to be mistaken. \"I\u0027d go too,\" she added, \"but we\u0027re adopting the[Pg 278] baby with the egg money—we\u0027ve saved it for years for when the time come. And one fare to the city and back is a lot of eggs. I thought I\u0027d rather wait for him here and have the ticket money to spend on the clothes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was on her way, I thought I guessed, to carry her good news to our friends in the village, for she bore that same air which I have noted, of being impermanent and subject to flight. And as she left me she turned to give me one of those rare compliments which are priceless. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You come over this afternoon,\" she said, \"and I\u0027ll show you what little things I\u0027ve made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I remember another compliment. It was when, in town, a charming little woman, a woman all of physical curves and mental tangents, had been telling a group of us about a gay day in a four-in-hand. She had not looked at me because for that sort of woman, as well as for others, I lack all that which would make them take account of my presence; but when in the four-in-hand she came to some mention of the road where the accident had nearly occurred (\"Oh, it was a beautiful road,\" she said, \"the river on one side, and the highlands, and a whole mob of trees,\") she turned straight upon me through her description as consistently as she had neglected me when she described the elbow-bits of the leaders and the boots of the woman on the [Pg 279]box-seat. It may have been a chance, but I have always hugged it to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n My neighbour\u0027s house is small, and her little upstairs rooms are the half-story with sloping ceilings and windows which extend from the floor to the top of one\u0027s head. It gives me a curious sense of over-familiarity with a window to be as tall as it is. I feel that I have it at advantage and that I am using it with undue intimacy. When I was a little girl I used to creep under the dining-room table and sit there, looking up, transfixed at the difference. A new angle of material vision, the sight of the other side of the shield, always gives me this pause. But whereas this other aspect of things used to be a delight, now, in life, I shrink a little from availing myself of certain revelations. I have a great wish to know things, but I would know them otherwise than by looking at their linings. I think that even a window should be sanctioned in its reticences. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before a black walnut commode my neighbour knelt that afternoon, and I found that it was filled with the things which she had made for the baby, when they should find him. These she showed to me—they were simple and none too fine, and she had made them on her sewing-machine in the intervals of her busy life. For three years she had wrought at them, buying them from the egg money.[Pg 280] I wondered if this secret pastime of garment-making might not account for my impression of her that she must always be off to engage in something other. Perhaps it was this occupation, always calling her, which would not let her appear fixed at garden-watering or festival. I think that it may be so of any who are \"pressed in the spirit\" to serve, to witness to any truth: that is their vocation and every other is an avocation, a calling away from the real business of life. For this reason it is my habit to think of the social workers in any division of the service, family or town or state or church, as Vocationists. It is they who are following the one great occupation. The rest of us are avocationists. In my neighbour I perceived one of the great comrade company of the Vocationists, unconscious of her banner, but because of some sweet, secret piping, following, following.... \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always thought I\u0027d get to do a little embroidering on a yoke or two,\" she said, \"but so far I couldn\u0027t. Anyway I thought I could do the plain part and running the machine before he came. The other I could sit by the crib and do. Embroidery seems sort o\u0027 baby-watchin\u0027 work, don\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When I left her I walked across the lawns to my home in a sense of security and peace. With increasing thousands consciously striving and passioning to help, and thousands helping because of[Pg 281] the unconscious spirit within them, are there not many windows in the walls? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\" was to go by the Accommodation early next morning to bring home the baby. Therefore when, just before seven o\u0027clock, I observed my neighbour\u0027s husband leave his home and join Peter at his gate as usual, I went at once to see if something was amiss. \\n\\n \\n\\n My neighbour was having breakfast as her custom was \"after the men-folks were out of the way.\" At all events she was pretending to eat. I saw in her eyes that something was troubling her, but she greeted me cheerfully. I sat by the sewing-machine while she went on with her pretence at breakfast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The little thing\u0027s sick,\" she said. \"Last night we got the despatch. \u0027Baby in hospital for day or two. Will advise often,\u0027 it had in it. I\u0027m glad they put that in. I\u0027ll feel better to know they\u0027ll get good advice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I sat with her for a long time, regardless of my work or that Miggy was waiting for me. I was struck by the charm of matter-of-fact hopefulness in my neighbour, not the deliberate forcing of hope, but the simple expectation that nothing tragic would occur. But for all that she ate no breakfast, and I knew well the faint, quite physical sickness that she must have endured since the message came. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to get his basket ready to-day,\" she said. \"I never did that, two reasons. One was, it[Pg 282] seemed sort of taking too much for granted, like heating your spider before the meat wagon drives up. The other reason was I needed the basket for the clothes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I stayed with her while she made ready the clothes-basket, lining it with an old muslin curtain, filling it with pillows, covering it with the afghan from the parlour couch. Then, in a shoe box edged with the curtain\u0027s broad ruffle, she put an array of little things: the brush from the spare-room bureau, the pincushion from her own work-basket, a sachet bag that had come with a last year\u0027s Christmas gift, a cake of \"nice soap\" which she had kept for years and never unwrapped because it was so expensive. And then she added a little glass-stoppered bottle of white pills. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re for,\" she said. \"I found them when I housecleaned, and there was so many of \u0027em I hated to throw \u0027em away. Of course I\u0027ll never use \u0027em, but they look sort of nice in there—so white and a glass cork—don\u0027t you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She walked with me across the lawn and stood brooding, one hand across her mouth, looking down at the disturbance—so slight!—in the grass where we had laid the bird. And on her face was the look which, each time that I saw it there, drew me nearer to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 283] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Seems as if I\u0027d ought to be there to the hospital,\" she said, \"doing what I can. Do you s\u0027pose they\u0027ll take good care of him? I guess they know more about it than I do. But if I could get hold of him in my arms it seems as if I could help \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I said what I could, and she went away to her house. And for the first time since I had known her she did not seem put upon to be back at some employment. These times of unwonted idleness are terrible to witness. I remember a farmer whom I once saw in the afternoon, dressed in his best, waiting in the kitchen for the hour of his daughter\u0027s wedding, and I wondered that the great hands did not work of their own will. The lost aspect of certain men on holidays, the awful inactivity of the day of a funeral, the sad idleness of old age, all these are very near to the tragedy of negation. Work, the positive, the normal, the joyous, is like an added way of being. I thought that I would never again marvel at my neighbour for being always on the edge of flight to some pressing occupation. Why should she not be so?—with all that there is to be done. Whether we rush about, or conceal the need and rush secretly, is a detail of our breeding; the need is to get things done, to become by doing. And while for myself I would prefer the accomplishment of not seeming to hurry, as another is accomplished at the harp, yet I own that I would[Pg 284] cheerfully forego the pretty grace rather than find myself without some slight degree of the robust proficiency of getting things done. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you\u0027re born a picture in a book,\" Calliope once said, \"it\u0027s all very well to set still on the page an\u0027 hold your hands. But if you\u0027re born anyways human at all, stick up your head an\u0027 start out for somewhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n My neighbour rarely comes to my house. And therefore, though she is to me so familiar a figure in her garden, when next morning I found her awaiting me in my sitting room, she seemed strange to me. Perhaps, too, she was really strange to me that day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My baby died,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood there looking at me, and I knew that what she said was true, but it seemed to me for a moment that I could not have it so. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He died yesterday in the evening,\" she told me. \"I just heard this morning, when the telegraph office opened. I dressed myself to go after him, but he\u0027s gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To go after him?\" I repeated. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was in the charity part. I was afraid they\u0027d bury him in the potter\u0027s field and they wouldn\u0027t mark—it, and that I couldn\u0027t never tell which one it was. So I want to get him and have him buried here.[Pg 285] He didn\u0027t want I should go—he thought it\u0027d be too much for me. But I was bound to, so he says he\u0027d go. They\u0027d ought to get here on the Five o\u0027Clock this afternoon. Oh, if I\u0027d went yesterday, do you think it would \u0027a\u0027 been any different?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There I could comfort her. I did not think it would have been different. But when I tried to tell her how much better it was this way than that the baby should first have come to her and then have sickened, she would have none of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never held him once,\" she said. \"Do you s\u0027pose anything could be worse than that? I\u0027d rather have got hold of him once, no matter what.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It touched me unutterably, the grief of this mother who was no mother. I had no knowledge what to say to her. But I think that what she wanted most was companionship. She went to one and another and another of our neighbours to whom she had shown so happily the broken post-card picture, and to them in the same way she took the news:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My baby died.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And I was amazed to find how in this little time, the tentacles of her heart having fastened and clung, she had made for herself, without ever having seen the child, little things to tell about him: His eyes were so bright; the sun was shining and the picture was made out-of-doors, yet the eyes were opened wide. They were blue eyes—had she told us?[Pg 286] Had we noticed the hands in the picture? And the head was a beautiful shape.... All this seemed to me marvellous. For I saw that no woman ever mourns for any child dumbly, as a bird mourns a fledgling, but even if she never sees it, she will yet contrive some little tender ways to give it personality and to cherish it. \\n\\n \\n\\n They did their best to comfort her, the women of the village. But many of them had lost little children of their own, and these women could not regard her loss as at all akin to theirs. I think that this my neighbour felt; and perhaps she dimly felt that to me her grief, hardly less than theirs, brimmed with the tragic disaster of the unfulfilled and bore, besides, its own peculiar bitterness. In any case I was of those who, that afternoon, went out to the cemetery to await the coming of my neighbour and \"him\" and their little burden. Calliope was there, and Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady and Miggy; and when it was time to go Little Child was with me, so she went too. For I am not of those who keep from children familiarity with death. Familiarity with the ways of death I would spare them, but not the basic things, primal as day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to give a real funeral,\" my neighbour had said. \"I just want the few that I tell to happen out there to the cemetery, along about five. And then we\u0027ll come with him. It seems as if it\u0027ll hurt less[Pg 287] that way. I couldn\u0027t bear to see a whole line driving along, and me look back and know who it was for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cemetery had the dignity and serenity of a meadow, a meadow still somewhat amazed that it had been for a while distracted from its ancient uses, but, after all, perceiving no permanent difference in its function. I am never weary of walking down these grassy streets and of recounting their strangenesses. As that of the headstone of David Bibber\u0027s wives, one stone extending across the heads of the two graves and at either end of the stone two Gothic peaks from whose inner slopes reach two marble hands, clasped midway, and, \\n\\n \\n\\n SACRED TO THE WIVES OF DAVID BIBBER \\n\\n \\n\\n inscribed below, the wifely names not appearing in the epitaph. And that of Mark Sturgis who, the village said, had had the good luck to marry two women named Dora; so he had erected a low monument to \"Dora, Beloved Wife of Mark Sturgis, Jr.\" (\"But how mixin\u0027 it must be to the ghosts!\" Calliope said.) And of the young girl of a former Friendship family of wealth, a girl who sleeps beneath a monument on which stands a great figure of a young woman in a white marble dress made with three flounces. (\"Honest,\" Calliope had put it,[Pg 288] \"you can\u0027t hardly tell whether it\u0027s a tomb or a valentine.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n But these have for me an interest less of the bizarre than of the human, and nothing that is human was alien to that hour. \\n\\n \\n\\n We waited for them by the new little grave, the disturbance—so slight!—in the earth where we would lay the stranger baby. Our hands were filled with garden flowers—Calliope had drawn a little hand cart laden with ferns and sweet-brier, and my dear Mis\u0027 Amanda Toplady had cut all the half-blown buds from her loved tea rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It seems like a little baby wasn\u0027t real dead that I hadn\u0027t helped lay out,\" said that great Mis\u0027 Amanda, trying to find her handkerchief. \"Oh, I wish\u0027t it was alive. It seems like such a little bit of comin\u0027 alive to ask the Lord!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And as the afternoon shadows drew about us with fostering arms, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Out-Here knows we feel bad more than Down Town, don\u0027t it?\" said Little Child. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have always thought very beautiful that village custom of which I have before spoken, which provides that the father and mother of a little baby who dies may take it with them in a closed carriage to the grave. It was so that my neighbour and her husband brought their baby to the cemetery from the station, with the little coffin on their knees. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 289] \\n\\n \\n\\n On the box beside the driver Peter was riding. We learned afterward that he had appeared at the station and had himself taken that little coffin from the car. \"So then it didn\u0027t have to be on the truck at all,\" my neighbour noted thankfully when she told me. I think that it must be this living with only a street or two between folk and the open country which gives these unconscious sharpenings of sensibility often, otherwhere, bred only by old niceties of habit. \\n\\n \\n\\n So little Kenneth was buried, who never had the name save in unreality; whom my neighbour had never tended; who lived for her only in dream and on that broken post-card and here in the hidden dust. It made her grief so sad a thing that her arms did not miss him; nor had he slipped from any usage of the day; nor was any link broken with the past; only the plans that had hung in air had gone out, like flames which had kindled nothing. Because of this she sorrowed from within some closed place at which her husband could only guess, who stood patiently without in his embarrassed concern, his clumsy anxiety to do what there was to be done, his wondering distress at his wife\u0027s drooping grief. But her sorrow was rooted in the love of women for the \"little young thing, runnin\u0027 round,\" for which she had long passioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, God, who lived in the spirit of the little[Pg 290] Lord Jesus, live Thou in this child\u0027s spirit, and it in Thee, world without end,\" Doctor June prayed. And Little Child whispered to me and then went to let fall a pink in the grave. \"So if the flower gets to be an angel flower, then they can go round together,\" she explained. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I looked up there were in the west the first faint heraldings of rose. And against it stood Miggy and Peter, side by side, looking down this new way of each other\u0027s lives which took account of sorrow. He said something to her, and she nodded, and gave him her white hollyhocks to lay with the rest. And as they turned away together Little Child whispered to me, pulling herself, by my arm, to high tiptoe:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That little child we put in the sunset,\" she said, nodding to the west, \"it\u0027s there now. It\u0027s there now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps it was that my heart was filled with the tragedy of the unfulfilled intention, perhaps it was that I thought that Little Child\u0027s whispering was true. In any case I hastened my steps, and as we passed out on the road I overtook Miggy and Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peter,\" said I, \"may Miggy and I come to pay you that visit now, on the way back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miggy looked startled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s supper time,\" she objected. \\n\\n \\n\\n Who are we that we should interrupt a sunset, or[Pg 291] a situation, or the stars in their courses, merely to sup? Neither Miggy nor I belong to those who do so. Besides, we had to pass Peter\u0027s very door. I said so, and all the time Peter\u0027s face was glowing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hurry on ahead,\" I bade him, \"and Miggy and Little Child and I will come in your house to call.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at me gratefully, and waited for good night to my neighbour, and went swiftly away down the road toward the sunset. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, goody grand, goody grand,\" Little Child went on softly, in an invocation of her own to some secret divinity of her pleasure. \"Oh, that little child we put there, it\u0027s talkin\u0027 to the sky, an\u0027 I guess that makes sunset be!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n My neighbour was looking back across the tranquil meadow which might have been deep with summer hay instead of mounded to its sad harvest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish,\" she said, \"I could have had his little grave in my garden, same as you would a bird. Still I s\u0027pose a cemet\u0027ry is a cemet\u0027ry and had ought to be buried in. But oh, I can\u0027t tell you how glad I am to have him here in Friendship Village. It\u0027s better to think about, ain\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the thing that gripped my heart was to see her, beside her husband, go down the road and not hurry. All that bustling impermanence was fallen from her. I think that now I am becoming thankful for every one who goes busily quickening the day[Pg 292] with a multitude, yes, even with a confusion, of homely, cheerful tasks. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miggy slipped her hand within my arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you think of it?\" she said. \"I\u0027ve been, all the time. It\u0027s most the same with her as it would be to me if I\u0027d lost her. You know ... that little Margaret. I mean, if she should never be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As when one hears the note of an oriole ringing from the innermost air, so now it seems to me that after these things the deeps of air can never again be wholly alien to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1799/52255.html","bookId":1055,"book":{"id":1055,"title":"Friendship Village Love Stories","description":"简介： Although it is June, the Little Child about whom I shall sometimes write in these pages this morning brought me a few violets.
