{"id":6121,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"This wandering race, sever\u0027d from other men, Boast yet their intercourse with human arts; The seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt, Find them acquainted with their secret treasures: And unregarded herbs, and flowers, and blossoms, Display undreamt-of powers when gather\u0027d by them. The Jew\n Our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to inform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the rest of this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have easily anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by all the world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her father to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to the house which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.\n It would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. But he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted people, and those were to be conquered.\n \"Holy Abraham!\" he exclaimed, \"he is a good youth, and my heart bleeds to see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his corslet of goodly price---but to carry him to our house!---damsel, hast thou well considered?---he is a Christian, and by our law we may not deal with the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.\"\n \"Speak not so, my dear father,\" replied Rebecca; \"we may not indeed mix with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the Gentile becometh the Jew\u0027s brother.\"\n \"I would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,\" replied Isaac;---\"nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.\"\n \"Nay, let them place him in my litter,\" said Rebecca; \"I will mount one of the palfreys.\"\n \"That were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of Edom,\" whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until Isaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried voice---\"Beard of Aaron!---what if the youth perish!---if he die in our custody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces by the multitude?\"\n \"He will not die, my father,\" said Rebecca, gently extricating herself from the grasp of Isaac \"he will not die unless we abandon him; and if so, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.\"\n \"Nay,\" said Isaac, releasing his hold, \"it grieveth me as much to see the drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from mine own purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the Rabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made thee skilful in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs, and the force of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth thee---thou art a good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto me and unto my house, and unto the people of my fathers.\"\n The apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her return to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The Templar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold and ardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.\n Rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and to bind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic ballads, must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as they are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how frequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her cure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.\n But the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical science in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of the time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced sage among this despised people, when wounded or in sickness. The aid of the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though a general belief prevailed among the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins were deeply acquainted with the occult sciences, and particularly with the cabalistical art, which had its name and origin in the studies of the sages of Israel. Neither did the Rabbins disown such acquaintance with supernatural arts, which added nothing (for what could add aught?) to the hatred with which their nation was regarded, while it diminished the contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician might be the subject of equal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer, but he could not be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the wonderful cures they are said to have performed, that the Jews possessed some secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with the exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great care to conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.\n The beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained, arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years, her sex, and even the age in which she lived. Her knowledge of medicine and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged Jewess, the daughter of one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved Rebecca as her own child, and was believed to have communicated to her secrets, which had been left to herself by her sage father at the same time, and under the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed been to fall a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived in her apt pupil.\n Rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally revered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself, out of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself with his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty than was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her people, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion, even in preference to his own.\n When Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state of unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken place during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound, and having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed, informed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great bleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of Miriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest\u0027s life, and that he might with safety travel to York with them on the ensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His charity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would have left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he was residing at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however, Rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that had peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be discovered; the other, that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was an intimate favourite of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and that, in case the monarch should return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John with treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small need of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richard\u0027s favour.\n \"Thou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,\" said Isaac, giving way to these weighty arguments---\"it were an offending of Heaven to betray the secrets of the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not rashly to be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and shekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise physician---assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom Providence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England call the Lion\u0027s Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the hands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got assurance of my dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to thy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our house shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. And if he of the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad, then shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence, when the king\u0027s displeasure shall burn high against thy father. And if he doth not return, this Wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword, even as he did yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good youth, and keepeth the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that which he borroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my father\u0027s house, when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons of Belial.\"\n It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to consciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery from a state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall exactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists, or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined to great weakness and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and received, of steeds rushing upon each other, overthrowing and overthrown---of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the heady tumult of a confused fight. An effort to draw aside the curtain of his couch was in some degree successful, although rendered difficult by the pain of his wound.\n To his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently furnished, but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in other respects partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to doubt whether he had not, during his sleep, been transported back again to the land of Palestine. The impression was increased, when, the tapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in a rich habit, which partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided through the door which it concealed, and was followed by a swarthy domestic.\n As the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she imposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while the attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe\u0027s side, and the lovely Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place, and the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful and dignified simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more civilized days, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to female delicacy. The idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different sex, was melted away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death. Rebecca\u0027s few and brief directions were given in the Hebrew language to the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her assistant in similar cases, obeyed them without reply.\n The accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded when uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca, the romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms pronounced by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear, but, from the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which accompanied them, touching and affecting to the heart. Without making an attempt at further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take the measures they thought most proper for his recovery; and it was not until those were completed, and this kind physician about to retire, that his curiosity could no longer be suppressed.---\"Gentle maiden,\" he began in the Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels had rendered him familiar, and which he thought most likely to be understood by the turban\u0027d and caftan\u0027d damsel who stood before him---\"I pray you, gentle maiden, of your courtesy------\"\n But here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she could scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general expression was that of contemplative melancholy. \"I am of England, Sir Knight, and speak the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage belong to another climate.\"\n \"Noble damsel,\"---again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca hastened to interrupt him.\n \"Bestow not on me, Sir Knight,\" she said, \"the epithet of noble. It is well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor Jewess, the daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good and kind lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.\"\n I know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied with the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of the lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were, mellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a minstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays through a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to retain the same class of feelings towards a Jewess. This Rebecca had foreseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her father\u0027s name and lineage; yet---for the fair and wise daughter of Isaac was not without a touch of female weakness ---she could not but sigh internally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether unmixed with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his unknown benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed, and collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which expressed a grateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected quarter, and from one of an inferior race. It was not that Ivanhoe\u0027s former carriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that one word should operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could not be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a degraded class, to whom it could not be honourably rendered.\n But the gentleness and candour of Rebecca\u0027s nature imputed no fault to Ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion. On the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now regarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was disgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased not to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and convalescence. She informed him of the necessity they were under of removing to York, and of her father\u0027s resolution to transport him thither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be restored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan, which he grounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.\n \"Was there not,\" he said, \"in Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin, or even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a wounded countryman\u0027s residence with him until he should be again able to bear his armour?---Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could be received?---Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he was sure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold\u0027s, to whom he was related?\"\n \"Any, the worst of these harbourages,\" said Rebecca, with a melancholy smile, \"would unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss your physician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well know, can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since the days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the advantages. No Nazarene---I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight ---no Christian leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to bear your corslet within a month.\"\n \"And how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?\" said Ivanhoe, impatiently.\n \"Within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my directions,\" replied Rebecca.\n \"By Our Blessed Lady,\" said Wilfred, \"if it be not a sin to name her here, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if thou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full of crowns, come by them as I may.\"\n \"I will accomplish my promise,\" said Rebecca, \"and thou shalt bear thine armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one boon in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.\"\n \"If it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield to one of thy people,\" replied Ivanhoe, \"I will grant thy boon blithely and thankfully.\"\n \"Nay,\" answered Rebecca, \"I will but pray of thee to believe henceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without desiring other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made both Jew and Gentile.\"\n \"It were sin to doubt it, maiden,\" replied Ivanhoe; \"and I repose myself on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting you will enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind leech, let me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon Cedric and his household?---what of the lovely Lady---\" He stopt, as if unwilling to speak Rowena\u0027s name in the house of a Jew---\"Of her, I mean, who was named Queen of the tournament?\"\n \"And who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with judgment which was admired as much as your valour,\" replied Rebecca.\n The blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing his cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in Rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.\n \"It was less of her I would speak,\" said he, \"than of Prince John; and I would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends me not?\"\n \"Let me use my authority as a leech,\" answered Rebecca, \"and enjoin you to keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize you of what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament, and set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights, and churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring, by fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the land. It is said he designs to assume his brother\u0027s crown.\"\n \"Not without a blow struck in its defence,\" said Ivanhoe, raising himself upon the couch, \"if there were but one true subject in England I will fight for Richard\u0027s title with the best of them ---ay, one or two, in his just quarrel!\"\n \"But that you may be able to do so,\" said Rebecca touching his shoulder with her hand, \"you must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.\"\n \"True, maiden,\" said Ivanhoe, \"as quiet as these disquieted times will permit---And of Cedric and his household?\"\n \"His steward came but brief while since,\" said the Jewess, \"panting with haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth of Cedric\u0027s flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane of Coningsburgh had left Prince John\u0027s lodging in high displeasure, and were about to set forth on their return homeward.\"\n \"Went any lady with them to the banquet?\" said Wilfred.\n \"The Lady Rowena,\" said Rebecca, answering the question with more precision than it had been asked---\"The Lady Rowena went not to the Prince\u0027s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her journey back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your faithful squire Gurth------\"\n \"Ha!\" exclaimed the knight, \"knowest thou his name?---But thou dost,\" he immediately added, \"and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and, as I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.\"\n \"Speak not of that,\" said Rebecca, blushing deeply; \"I see how easy it is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.\"\n \"But this sum of gold,\" said Ivanhoe, gravely, \"my honour is concerned in repaying it to your father.\"\n \"Let it be as thou wilt,\" said Rebecca, \"when eight days have passed away; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy recovery.\"\n \"Be it so, kind maiden,\" said Ivanhoe; \"I were most ungrateful to dispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and I have done with questioning thee.\"\n \"I grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,\" answered the Jewess, \"that he is in custody by the order of Cedric.\"---And then observing the distress which her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, \"But the steward Oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his master\u0027s displeasure against him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a faithful serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed this error out of the love which he bore to Cedric\u0027s son. And he said, moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the Jester, were resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case Cedric\u0027s ire against him could not be mitigated.\"\n \"Would to God they may keep their purpose!\" said Ivanhoe; \"but it seems as if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to me. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his crown;---my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of her sex;---and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman but for his love and loyal service to me!---Thou seest, maiden, what an ill-fated wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve thee also in their pursuit.\"\n \"Nay,\" said Rebecca, \"thy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee miscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true heart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which thou hast sustained, seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a helper and a physician, even among the most despised of the land?---Therefore, be of good courage, and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel which thine arm shall work before this people. Adieu---and having taken the medicine which I shall send thee by the hand of Reuben, compose thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the journey on the succeeding day.\"\n Ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of Rebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative and narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed slumbers. In the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from feverish symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.\n He was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the lists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one circumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure sufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac, like the enriched traveller of Juvenal\u0027s tenth satire, had ever the fear of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike accounted fair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He therefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts, and shorter repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had several hours the start of him, but who had been delayed by their protracted feasting at the convent of Saint Withold\u0027s. Yet such was the virtue of Miriam\u0027s balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoe\u0027s constitution, that he did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his kind physician had apprehended.\n In another point of view, however, the Jew\u0027s haste proved somewhat more than good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend him as a guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means from the national love of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized as laziness and gluttony. Reversing Shylock\u0027s position, they had accepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and were very much displeased when they found themselves disappointed, by the rapidity with which he insisted on their proceeding. They remonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their horses by these forced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a deadly feud, concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for consumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that when the alarm of danger approached, and that which Isaac feared was likely to come upon him, he was deserted by the discontented mercenaries on whose protection he had relied, without using the means necessary to secure their attachment.\n In this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded patient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon afterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates. Little notice was at first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have remained behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it under the impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise, for Rowena had not unveiled herself. But De Bracy\u0027s astonishment was considerable, when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of Saxon outlaws, with whom his name might be a protection for himself and his friends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\n The ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity, never utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight any injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his betraying him to Front-de-Boeuf, who would have had no scruples to put to death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of Ivanhoe. On the other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady Rowena, as the events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfred\u0027s previous banishment from his father\u0027s house, had made matter of notoriety, was a pitch far above the flight of De Bracy\u0027s generosity. A middle course betwixt good and evil was all which he found himself capable of adopting, and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the litter, and to suffer no one to approach it. If questioned, they were directed by their master to say, that the empty litter of the Lady Rowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been wounded in the scuffle. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the Knight Templar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own schemes, the one on the Jew\u0027s treasure, and the other on his daughter, De Bracy\u0027s squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded comrade, to a distant apartment. This explanation was accordingly returned by these men to Front-de-Boeuf, when he questioned them why they did not make for the battlements upon the alarm.\n \"A wounded companion!\" he replied in great wrath and astonishment. \"No wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay leaguer before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to nobles, since men-at-arms have turned sick men\u0027s nurses, and Free Companions are grown keepers of dying folk\u0027s curtains, when the castle is about to be assailed.---To the battlements, ye loitering villains!\" he exclaimed, raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again, \"to the battlements, or I will splinter your bones with this truncheon!\"\n The men sulkily replied, \"that they desired nothing better than to go to the battlements, providing Front-de-Boeuf would bear them out with their master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.\"\n \"The dying man, knaves!\" rejoined the Baron; \"I promise thee we shall all be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I will relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.---Here, Urfried---hag---fiend of a Saxon witch---hearest me not?---tend me this bedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves use their weapons.---Here be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and quarrells*\n * The arblast was a cross-bow, the windlace the machine * used in bending that weapon, and the quarrell, so called * from its square or diamond-shaped head, was the bolt * adapted to it.\n ---to the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt through a Saxon brain.\"\n The men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise and detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were commanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried, or Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca the care of her patient.\n \n 这个流浪的民族与众人隔绝，\n 但自诩他们擅长人间的各种技艺；\n

我们的叙述必须回到几页以前，向读者交代一下某些过程，否则他们就无法理解这些重要情节的来龙去脉了。读者凭自己的智慧，想必已经猜到，在艾文荷伤重倒下，似乎全世界都抛弃了他的时候，那是由于丽贝卡的再三要求，才打动了她的父亲，把英勇的年轻武士从比武场上抬到了家中；当时以撒父女俩寓居在阿什贝镇的郊区。\n 要说服以撒采取这一步行动，在任何情况下都是并不困难的，因为他天性仁慈，注重情义。但是他也接受了他那个被迫害民族的偏见，胆小怕事，顾虑重重，这些便是需要克服的。\n “神圣的亚伯拉罕啊！”他喊道，“他是一个好青年，看到鲜血流下他贵重的绣花袄子和价钱昂贵的盔甲，我的心也酸了。但是把他带到我们家里！闺女，你有没有郑重考虑过？他是个基督徒，按照我们的律法，我们是不能与异乡人和外邦人来往的，除非为了商业利益。”\n “不要这么讲，亲爱的爸爸，”丽贝卡答道，“我们确实不能与他们一起喝酒，一起娱乐，但是受了伤，正处在危难中的外邦人，应该也是犹太人的弟兄。”\n “但愿我知道，雅各·本·图德拉拉比(注)对这个问题是怎么想的，”以撤答道。“不过决不能让一个好青年流血死去。让塞特和鲁本把他抬到阿什贝去吧。”\n --------\n (注)拉比是犹太教中主持宗教仪式和执行教规及律法的人，意为“老师”。\n “不，让他们把他安置在我的驮轿里，”丽贝卡说，“我可以骑马。”\n “那会把你暴露在以实玛利和以东(注)的那些狗面前，”以撒小声说，向一群骑士和扈从投出了怀疑的一瞥。但是丽贝卡已在把她的仁慈计划付诸实施了，没有听到他的话；最后以撒拉住她的衣袖，又慌张地喊道：“老祖宗亚伦啊！万一这年轻人死了，怎么办！如果他在我们的保护下死去，会不会要我们承担责任？‘说不定我还会给他们碎尸万段呢！”\n --------\n (注)以实玛利已见前，据说他是阿拉伯人的祖先。以东本来也是亚伯拉罕的后裔，后来他们建立了以东国，但在摩西率领以色列人逃离埃及时，以东人不准他们通过，因而成为仇敌，最后犹太王大卫灭亡了以东国。在这里，以实玛利人和以东人均指欺压犹太民族的人。\n “他不会死，我的父亲，”丽贝卡说，轻轻从以撒手中掣回衣袖。“他不会死，除非我们丢下他不管；如果那样，我们确实应该为他的死向上帝和世人负责了。”\n “好吧，”以撒说，放开了手，“我看到他的血一滴滴流掉，心里难过极了，就像那么多金币从我的钱袋中流走一样。我很清楚，拜占庭的拉比马纳塞斯的女儿米莉亚姆——愿她的灵魂在天上安息——教育了你，让你懂得了医术，还知道了草药的功能和配剂的作用。因此，你想怎么做就怎么做吧，你是一个好闺女，是上帝对我的恩赐，是我和我的家，以至我祖先的民族的荣誉，是我的一首欢乐的歌。”\n 然而以撒的顾虑不是毫无根据的，在返回阿什贝的途中，他女儿慷慨无私的仁慈行为，果然把她的美貌呈露到了众人面前，这自然没有逃过布里恩印布瓦吉贝尔那不怀好意的目光。他在他们旁边来来回回走了两次，把邪恶放肆的眼睛盯住了漂亮的犹太姑娘，这种爱慕引起的后果，我们已经看到了，那便是她无意之间落进了那个荒淫无耻的酒色之徒的魔掌。\n 丽贝卡毫不拖延，把病人带到了他们的临时寓所，亲自替他检查和包扎伤口。传奇小说和爱情歌谣的年轻读者自然知道，在那个所谓的黑暗时代中，外科手术往往是在妇女中间传授的，英勇的骑士负了伤，时常便有一位深深打动他心灵的女子替他诊治。\n 但是犹太人不论男女，对医学的各个部门都掌握着一定的知识和实践技能，当时的国王和王公贵族生了病或者受了伤，往往得在他们所鄙视的这个民族中，物色一位经验丰富的高手替他们医治。尽管在基督徒中间，大家普遍认为，犹太拉比所熟悉的是东方的各种秘传妖术，尤其是犹太教的玄妙魔法，它们的名称和渊源无非来自以色列圣哲们的著作，但是一旦患病，他们依然要求助于犹太医生，其急切程度并不因而稍减。同时拉比们也并不否认他们了解超自然的事物，反正他们的民族受到的歧视已无以复加，这并不能给他们带来什么坏处，相反倒能减轻那种恶毒攻击中的鄙薄成分。一个犹太术士在人们的心目中，可能与一个犹太高利贷者同样可恨，但他不会遭到同样的蔑视。此外，据说这些犹太人治愈过各种疑难杂症，因此很可能他们确实掌握了某些医疗技术的奥妙，这成了他们的独得之秘，他们的处境养成的排外精神，又使他们虽然生活在基督徒中，却严加防范，不让它们泄露给基督徒。\n 美丽的丽贝卡从小获得了良好的教养，接受了她的民族所固有的各种知识，加上她聪明好学，理解能力强，经过几年的学习，把这些知识融会贯通之后，她已显得出类拔革，超过了她的年龄、性别、甚至她生活的那个时代所达到的一般水平。她的医药知识和医疗技术，是一个年长的犹太妇女传授的，这是当时一位名医的女儿，她喜欢丽贝卡，把她看作自己的孩子；据说她也是在这样的年龄，这样的情况下继承渊博的父亲的衣钵的，现在她便把这些秘密传给了丽贝卡。确实，米莉亚姆的一生是不幸的，她成了那个宗教狂热时代的牺牲者，然而她的学问却由她聪明伶俐的学生继承下来了。\n 这样，丽贝卡的知识也像她的美貌一样，在她的部族中赢得了普遍的尊敬和赞美，大家几乎把她看作圣贤传记中提到的那些天资聪颖的女性之一。她的父亲崇拜她的才能，又不由自主地把她看作掌上明珠，对她十分宠爱，因此给了她充分的自由，超过了他的民族习惯通常所允许的限度，正如我们已看到的，他常常按照她的主意行事，甚至不惜违背他原来的看法。\n 艾文荷到达以撒的寓所时，仍处在昏迷状态，这是由于在比武场上努力拼搏，流血过多造成的。丽贝卡检查了伤口，按照她学到的医疗方法，给它敷上了创伤药；她告诉父亲，她担心的只是大出血可能引起的高烧，如果热度消退，米莉亚姆的药膏发挥预期的疗效，这位客人的生命便没有危险，下一天他还可保无虞，与他们一起旅行，前往约克。以撒一听傻了眼。他的慈悲心肠本来只限于把他带到阿什贝，至多也只是把这个重伤的基督徒留在目前的寓所里，托人照料一下，同时向那个希伯来房东保证，所有费用他会随时奉上。然而丽贝卡不同意这么办，她的理由很多，我们只想提一下以撒认为特别重要的两点。首先，她无论如何不能把珍贵的药品交给另一个医生，哪怕这是她本民族的人，她担心这贵重的秘方会泄漏；其次，这位负伤的骑士艾文荷的威尔弗莱德，是狮心王理查十分器重的一个亲信，万一这位国王回到国内，得知以撒曾资助他的兄弟阴谋叛乱，便难免要治他的罪，到那时唯有这个得到理查宠爱的骑士可以保护他，让他度过难关。\n “你讲的确是实情，丽贝卡，”以撒说，开始向这些有力的论点屈服了，“把故世的米莉亚姆的秘方泄漏给别人，那是违背天意的；上帝的恩赐不能任意挥霍，送给不相干的人，不论那是黄金白银，还是一个明哲医生的秘方；毫无疑问，上天把它们托付给什么人，这些人便应该把它们保管好。至于英国的拿撒勒人称作狮心工的那个人——很清楚，我宁可遇见以东的大狮子，也不愿落在他的手中，说不定他已知道我跟他兄弟的那些交易呢。所以我愿意听从你的主张，让这个年轻人跟我们一起前往约克，住在我们家里，一直住到他的伤治好为止。现在外面都在纷纷传说，那个狮心王已经回国，要是真的这样，万一国王的不满落到你父亲的头上，那么唯有艾文荷的威尔弗莱德是我可靠的保护人。如果国王不回来，这个威尔弗莱德凭他的一身武艺，也能像昨天和今天那样，挣得不少钱财，然后把欠我们的钱归还我们。因为这人是个好青年，很守信用，借了钱从不赖账，还肯搭救以色列人，哪怕你的父亲落进了彼列的门徒和强人们手中，他也会伸出援助之手的。”\n 几乎到了天快黑的时候，艾文荷才恢复知觉。他从时断时续的睡眠中醒来时，头脑还昏昏沉沉的，这是摆脱昏迷状态后必然有的情形。一时间他怎么也想不起，他在比武场上倒下以前发生了什么；对昨天经历的事，他总觉得隐隐约约，模模糊糊，理不出一个头绪。他只知道他受了伤，身上疼痛，又十分虚弱，毫无力气；进攻和反击，战马的迎面奔突、冲击和倒下．呐喊和武器的撞击，在他的记忆中构成了一幅天翻地覆似的混乱景象。他努力拉开帐子，这在一定程度上做到了，但伤口的疼痛使他几乎忍受不住。\n 令他惊异不止的，是他发现他睡在一间陈设豪华的屋子里，一眼望去没有椅子，只有一个个座垫，从各方面看，它的布置带有浓郁的东方色彩，以致他开始怀疑，是否在他睡着的时候，他又给送回到了巴勒斯坦的土地上。后来这种印象更深了，他看到遮在门上的帷幔拉开了，一个少女的身影飘进了屋子，她的服饰华丽，带有东方风味，不像欧洲人穿的，少女的后面跟着一个皮肤黝黑的仆人。\n 受伤的骑士正想向这个美丽的幽灵提出疑问时，她把一根细细的手指按在鲜红的嘴唇上，示意他别说话，这时那个仆人走到床边，揭开了艾文荷胁边的被子，秀丽的犹太姑娘端详了一会，觉得很满意；伤口还包扎得好好的，情况不坏。她开始工作，尽管在较为文明的时代，这种事也被看作是不适合女性做的，然而她的动作那么优美而庄重，神态又那么单纯而朴实，她没有想到这是一个年轻漂亮的少女在侍候一个病人，或者在为一个异性包扎伤口，她的一切思想都集中在这个仁慈的行动上，要用她的悉心护理减轻病人的痛苦，战胜死亡的威胁。丽贝卡用希伯来语向老仆人作了简单扼要的指示，后者在类似的情况下一向充当她的助手，因此不用多问便照办了。\n 一种陌生的语言，不论出自别人的口中听来会如何刺耳，可是出自漂亮的丽贝卡之口，却会产生一种美妙而快乐的效果，这是幻想赋予了它魅力，使它变得仿佛是一位仁慈的仙女发出的声音，确实，耳朵听不懂它的意义，只是伴随它的那种甜蜜的音调和温柔的表情，引起了心灵的愉快反应和共鸣。艾文荷不想再问什么，只是在沉默中，听任他们采取他们认为对他的复原最有利的措施；直到一切结束之后，那位亲切的医生打算告辞时，他的好奇心才终于克制不住。他在东方之行中学会了一些阿拉伯语，现在站在他面前的这位小姐既然戴着头巾，穿着系腰带的长袍，他可以用这种语言与她说话，因此他开口道：“请问，温柔的小姐，您这么照料我……”\n 但是美丽的医生立刻打断了他的话，她那平时显得忧郁和凝重的面容上，一时间浮起了一抹克制不住的微笑：“我是生在英国的，骑士先生，能讲英语，虽然我的衣着和血统属于另一地区。”\n “尊贵的小姐，”艾文荷骑士又开始道，但丽贝卡又匆忙打断了他的话。\n “不要用‘尊贵’这个词称呼我，”她说。“我还是应该马上让你明白，侍候你的小女子是可怜的犹太人，约克的以撒的女儿；最近他得到过你真诚亲切的关照，因此在你处在目前这种状况，需要帮助的时候，他和他的家人理应尽力照料你。”\n 我不知道，美丽的罗文娜对她的忠诚骑士刚才的表现，是否会完全满意，因为他脉脉含情，注视着可爱的丽贝卡那姣好的容貌，那窈窕的身材，那熠熠生辉的眼睛，而这对发亮的眼睛在纤细的长睫毛的掩映下，显得若明若暗，光线柔和，一个行吟诗人见了，会把它比作夜空中透过茉莉花丛向外窥探的星光。但艾文荷是一个正宗的天主教徒，不可能对犹太姑娘保持同样的观感；丽贝卡也早已预见到这点，正因为这样，她才急于提到她父亲的名字和她的血统。然而，以撒的这位漂亮聪明的女儿，也不能没有一点女性的弱点，当她发现，那尊敬爱慕的目光一下子发生了变化时，不免在心中暗暗叹息，因为这目光尽管仍在一定程度上保持着刚才对陌生的女恩人所流露的温情，神色已显得冷淡、平静和矜持了，它不再包含深刻的感情，不过是表示对来自一个意想不到的外人，一个弱小民族的一分子的悉心照料，不胜感激而已。这不是说，艾文荷以前的态度，除了一般的真诚敬意；那种年轻人必然会给予一位美女的敬意而外，还有什么别的意思；然而一句话竟会像符咒一样，顿时把可怜的丽贝卡，那个根本并不认为自己不配得到尊敬的丽贝卡，贬抑到了低人一等的地位，这终究是令人寒心的。\n 但是丽贝卡天生温柔而坦率，对艾文荷也怀有时代和宗教造成的偏见，她不想责怪。相反，这位美貌的犹太女子尽管已意识到，她的病人现在只是把她看作堕落的民族中的一个人，与她的交往超出必要的限度是不光彩的，她仍耐心地、全心全意地关心他，希望他痊愈和康复。她通知他，他们必须前往约克，她的父亲决定挈他同行，让他在恢复健康以前，一直住在他的家中。艾文荷对这个计划却大不以为然，理由是他不想再麻烦他的恩人们了。\n “我可以留在阿什贝，或者它的附近，”他说，“不妨找一个撒克逊庄主，或者一个富裕的农民也可以，只要他愿意接待一个受伤的同胞，让我在伤势痊愈，可以重新穿上盔甲以前，暂时在他家中住下便行了。甚至也可以找一家撒克逊人捐助的修道院，只要它肯接待我。或者是否可以把我送往伯顿，那里的圣维索尔特修道院院长沃尔西奥夫是一定能收留我的，我与他有些亲戚关系。”\n “毫无疑问，”丽贝卡说，露出了一丝伤心的微笑，“作为你的避难所，所有这些地方都比一个遭人唾弃的犹太人的家，更适合你居住；然而，骑士先生，除非你要赶走你的医生，你就无法改变你的住所。你很清楚，我们的民族能够治疗刀伤，虽然我们从不使枪弄棒；尤其在我们的家庭里，还保存着那些秘方，这是从所罗门时代一直传到今天的，它们的效力，你已经体会到了。在英伦三岛这片土地上，没有一个拿撒勒人——请你原谅，骑士先生——没有一个基督徒医生，可以在一个月以内让你重新穿上盔甲。”\n “那么你能用多少日子给我治好？”艾文荷焦急地问。\n “不超过八天，只要你耐心一些，完全按照我的话做，”丽贝卡回答。\n “我以圣母的名义起誓——如果在这里提到她不算罪孽——这不是我或任何真正的骑士躺在床上养伤的时候；只要你的保证能够兑现，小姐，我会尽一切力量，找到满满一头盔的金币报答你。”\n “我的保证是一定会兑现的，”丽贝卡说，“从现在起八天以内，你便能披上你的盔甲，但是我不要你的金银，我只要求你答应我一件事。”\n “只要我能办到，又是一个真正的基督徒可以答应犹太人的事，”文文荷答道，“我一定答应你，满足你的要求。”\n “我不要你什么，”丽贝卡答道，“我只要求你今后相信，犹太人对基督徒也可以大有用处，他们不需要任何报酬，只希望大家明白，犹太人和外邦人同样是上帝创造的，他们同样应该得到上天的保佑。”\n “不相信这点是有罪的，小姐，”艾文荷答道，“那么我就依靠你的技术，不再犹豫和怀疑了；我相信，在你的治疗下，到了第八天，我便能穿上盔甲了。现在，仁慈的医生，让我询问一下外面的消息，高贵的撒克逊人塞德里克和他的家人怎么样了？还有那位可爱的小姐……”他住口了，似乎不愿在犹太人的家中讲出罗文娜的名字，“我是指在比武大会上当选为女王的那位小姐，她怎么样了？”\n “也就是你选出的那位小姐吧，骑士先生？”丽贝卡答道，“你的眼力确实也像你的勇敢一样，得到了大家的赞赏。”\n 尽管艾文荷流了不少血，这时一抹红晕还是涌上了他的面颊，他发觉，虽然他尽力掩饰他对罗文娜的深刻感情，由于一时性急，还是在不经意间泄漏了秘密。\n “我要打听的主要不是她，是约翰亲王，”他说。“还有，我想知道，我那个忠实扈从怎么样了，为什么他不来侍候我？”\n “现在我得运用医生的权力，责令你保持沉默了，”丽贝卡答道。“你不能再胡思乱想，你要知道的一些事，我现在可以告诉你。约翰亲王中止了比武大会，带着他手下那班贵族、骑士和教士，匆匆忙忙赶往约克了；离开以前，他还运用一切合法的和不合法的手段，从当地一些有钱的人那里，搜刮了尽量多的钱财。据说他在图谋起事，夺取他哥哥的王位。”\n “这必然会引起一场战斗，”艾文荷说，从病床上撑起了身子，“只要英国还有一个真正的臣民，他便应该挺身而出。为了保卫理查的权利，我要与那些人战斗到底——是的，为了他的正义事业，一个对付他们两个！”\n “但是为了你能那么做，”丽贝卡说，把手按住了他的肩膀，“你现在必须遵从我的指导，保持平静。”\n “对，姑娘，”艾文荷说，“在这个不平静的时代中尽量保持平静。那么塞德里克和他的一家人呢？”\n “他的管家后来匆匆忙忙来过一会，”犹太姑娘说，“他跑得气喘吁吁，向我父亲索取一笔钱，那是塞德里克一批羊毛的货款；我从他那里听得，塞德里克和科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦，离开约翰亲王的住处时非常生气，当时正预备赶回家去。”\n “有没有哪位小姐与他们一起参加宴会？”威尔弗莱德问。\n “你是问罗文娜小姐吧，”丽贝卡回答时提得比较明确了，“罗文娜小姐没有去参加亲王的宴会，据管家告诉我们，她现在正与她的监护人塞德里克一起回罗瑟伍德。至于你那个忠实的扈从葛四……”\n “哈！”骑士喊道，“你知道他的名字？对，你知道，”他马上又道，“你当然知道，因为他是从你的手中——对，现在我相信，那只是出于你自己的慷慨，他昨天才从你手中收到了一百枚金币。”\n “不要再提那件事，”丽贝卡说，脸色涨得通红，“我发现，内心希望隐藏的事，舌头会多么轻易地泄露出来。”\n “但是这些金币，”艾文荷说，“它涉及我的荣誉，我必须归还你的父亲。”\n “等八天过去以后，随你要怎么办吧，”丽贝卡说，“但是现在不要想它，也不必谈它，这会影响你的康复。”\n “可以，仁慈的姑娘，”艾文荷说，“如果我不听你的话，那真是不知好歹了。但是请你讲讲可怜的葛四怎么样，此外我不会再向你打听什么了。”\n “我很难过，不得不照实告诉你，骑士先生，”犹太姑娘答道，“他给塞德里克下令监禁了。”接着她发现威尔弗莱德听到这消息便愁容满面，马上又道：“不过据管家奥斯瓦尔德说，如果没有什么事重新弓愧主人对他的不满，他相信塞德里克会宽恕葛四，因为他是一个忠实的奴仆，一向得到主人的宠爱，何况他之所以犯这错误，只是出于他对塞德里克的儿子的爱护。他还说，万一塞德里克对他的怒火无法减轻，他和他的伙伴们，尤其是小丑汪八，决定事先通知葛四，让他设法逃走。”\n “但愿上帝保佑，他们不致改变主意吧！”艾文荷说。 “但是我总觉得，好像我是注定要给任何关心我的人带来灾难的。我的国王器重我和提拔我，可是你瞧，他对他的兄弟恩重如山，这位兄弟却拿起武器，要篡夺他的王位；我的关心又给一位最美丽的小姐带来了约束和麻烦；现在我的父亲在一怒之下又几乎杀死这个可怜的奴仆，这又仅仅因为他爱我，忠诚地为我办事！你瞧，姑娘，你尽力帮助的是这么一个命运不济的家伙；还是明智一些，放我走吧，免得跟随我的恶运像猎狗一样，把你也当作了它捕捉的猎物。”\n “不，骑士先生，”丽贝卡说，“你的虚弱和你的忧虑使你曲解了上天的意图。你想，正当你的国家最需要坚强的战士和忠诚的心灵的时候，你回到了国内；正当你国王的敌人专横跋扈，不可一世的时候，你煞住了他们的嚣张气焰。至于你经受的厄运，你没有看到正是在这个时候，上帝甚至从遭到唾弃的民族中，给你派来了一个救护你的医生吗？因此你得鼓起勇气，相信你是为了某种惊天动地的事业。由上天派来为这个国家尽你的力量的。再见，我会派鲁本送药给你，你要按时服用，安心静养，使你经得起明天的旅行。”\n 艾文荷给这番道理说服了，接受了丽贝卡的指导。鲁本给他的药是带有止痛和麻醉作用的，它使病人度过了沉睡和没有痛苦的一夜。到了早上，那位仁慈的医生发现他的热度已完全退尽，适合旅途的劳顿了。\n 他给安置在驮舆中，这就是他离开比武场时用的，还为他的旅途舒适采取了一切措施。只有一件事，虽然经过而贝卡的再三恳求，仍未引起足够的重视，按照受伤的骑士的需要行事。原来以撤正如尤维纳利斯(注)在第十首讽刺诗中描写的有钱旅客，总是担心强盗的拦路抢劫，觉得掠夺成性的诺曼贵族和撒克逊土匪，都可能把他当作一块肥肉，随时出现在他眼前，因此他必须马不停蹄，加紧赶路，缩短休息和吃饭的时间。结果尽管塞德里克和阿特尔斯坦比他早几个钟头动身，他却超过了他们，何况他们在圣维索尔特修道院的丰盛筵席还耽误了不少工夫。然而由于米莉亚姆的药膏的神奇疗效，也由于艾文荷的体力的强壮，他顶住了兼程赶路的劳累，没有引起那位仁慈的医生担忧的不利后果。\n --------\n (注)尤维纳利斯（约60一约140），古罗马讽刺诗人，他的作品仅留下十六首讽刺诗，由后人编为五卷《讽刺诗》。第十首属于社会性的讽刺作品。\n 可是从另一角度看，犹太人的赶路只是欲速不达，适得其反。他坚持快速的做法，在他和他雇佣的护送人员之间，引起了几次争执。那些人都是撒克逊人。带有这个民族无法改变的贪图安逸享乐的特点，诺曼人曾把这称之为好吃懒做的劣根性。他们与夏洛克(注)的立场正好相反，是想靠犹太财主大吃大喝才接受雇佣的，现在发现这位财主只顾赶路，便大失所望，十分恼火。他们还提出了抗议，认为这么不停地奔跑，他们的马有受伤的危险。最后，以撒和他的护卫人员，为每顿饭供应的麦酒数量发生了激烈争吵。这样，在已经看到危险的迹象，以撒心惊胆战，唯恐祸事来临的时候，那些胸怀不满的雇佣兵却丢下他扬长而去了。他指望依靠他们的保护但没有采取必要的手段，笼络住他们的心。\n --------\n (注)莎士比亚的喜剧《威尼斯商人》中的犹太人，在这里即指以撒。\n 犹太人父女俩和他们的伤员，便是在这种无计可施的状况中遇到塞德里克的，这事前面已经交代过了，不久他们便全部落进了德布拉西一伙人的手中。起先那个驮舆没有引起注意，要不是德布拉西的好奇，它本来可以没有事。可是他偏偏向驮舆内张了一下，觉得他要追逐的猎物说不定藏在这里边，因为罗文娜一直戴着面纱。这么一来，德布拉西吃了一惊，发现驮舆内躺的是一个受伤的男人，而这个男人以为他是落进了撒克逊强人的手中，那么他的名字也许可以对他自己和他的朋友们发生保护作用，因此他坦率地承认他便是艾文荷的威尔弗莱德。\n 德布拉西尽管粗野、轻浮，骑士的荣誉观念还没有被他完全抛弃，这使他不想伤害处在无力自卫状态的骑士，同样也不愿向牛面将军告密，他知道，后者作为艾文荷封地的争夺者，会不顾一切，毫不迟疑地把那个人处死。另一方面，比武场上的情形，还有尽人皆知的威尔弗莱德被父亲赶出家门的原因，又使德布拉西不愿释放罗文娜小姐心目中的情人，这已大大超出他的宽容心理的最大限度。在善与恶之间，他所能采取的唯一折衷办法，便是命令他的两名扈从守在驮舆旁边，不让任何人接近它。如果有人问起，他们便得按照主人的吩咐，答说这是罗文娜小姐的驮舆，是她让给他们在混战中受伤的一个家人乘坐的。到达托奎尔斯通后，圣殿骑士和城堡的主人都忙于实行自己的计划，一个要敲榨犹太人的财产，另一个要霸占他的女儿，因此德布拉西的两个扈从得以在运送一个受伤的伙伴的名义下，把艾文荷送进了一间偏僻的屋子。在牛面将军向他们查问，为什么听到警报还不上城楼时，他们也是那么解释的。\n “一个受伤的伙伴！”牛面将军答道，十分生气和诧异。“难怪那些乡巴佬和庄稼汉这么嚣张，居然敢来围攻城堡，那些小丑和猪倌居然敢给贵族下战书，就因为在城堡即将遭到攻击的时候，我们的战士竟还在给病人当护士，我们的自由战士竟在守卫伤员的病床！上城楼去，你们这些游手好闲的混蛋！”他拉开洪亮的嗓门大声吆喝，震得屋顶部发出了回声，“上城楼去，别叫我用这根大棒打断你们的脊梁骨！”\n 那两个人哭丧着脸答道，他们宁可上城楼打仗，只要牛面将军肯替他们在主人面前说句话就成了，因为是他们的主人命令他们在这里照料垂死的人的。\n “垂死的人！你们这些混蛋，”男爵答道，“我告诉你们，要是我们守不住这个城堡，我们大家都得变成死人。但是我可以把守护这个混蛋的任务交给别人。喂，厄弗利德，老虔婆，撒克逊巫婆，听见我喊你没有？你来侍候这个病人，因为他必须有人照料，这两个流氓得跟我去打仗。伙计们，这里有两张石弩，弩机和方镞箭也齐备，你们马上带着它们到碉堡上去，看准了撒克逊人的头颅狠狠射箭。”\n 两个扈从与干这行当的多数人一样，喜爱厮打，不愿闲着，马上欢天喜地的上城楼去执行命令了。这样，守护艾文荷的责任落到了厄弗利德，即乌尔莉加身上。但是她的头脑里充满了屈辱的回忆和复仇的愿望，这使她马上把照料病人的任务交给了丽贝卡。\n \n
