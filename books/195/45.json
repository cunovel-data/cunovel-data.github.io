{"id":6136,"no":45,"title":"Chapter 43","content":"Be Mowbray\u0027s sins so heavy in his bosom, That they may break his foaming courser\u0027s back, And throw the rider headlong in the lists, A caitiff recreant! Richard II\\n\\n Our scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of Templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the life or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or rural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not peculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of single combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody spectacle of brave men falling by each other\u0027s hands. Even in our own days, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match, a riot, or a meeting of radical reformers, collects, at considerable hazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators, otherwise little interested, except to see how matters are to be conducted, or whether the heroes of the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors, flints or dunghills.\\n\\n The eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the gate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing the procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the tiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on a piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been levelled with care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports. It occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully palisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied with galleries and benches for their use.\\n\\n On the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at the east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors and Knights of the Order. Over these floated the sacred standard, called \"Le Beau-seant\", which was the ensign, as its name was the battle-cry, of the Templars.\\n\\n At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged around a stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the victim whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal circle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung ready for that purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black slaves, whose colour and African features, then so little known in England, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them as on demons employed about their own diabolical exercises. These men stirred not, excepting now and then, under the direction of one who seemed their chief, to shift and replace the ready fuel. They looked not on the multitude. In fact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of every thing save the discharge of their own horrible duty.\\n\\n And when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips, and showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the expected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing that they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had communed, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her dreadful punishment. They whispered to each other, and communicated all the feats which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period, not failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his due.\\n\\n \"Have you not heard, Father Dennet,\" quoth one boor to another advanced in years, \"that the devil has carried away bodily the great Saxon Thane, Athelstane of Coningsburgh?\"\\n\\n \"Ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint Dunstan.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s that?\" said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a harp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed of no vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered doublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the \"wrest\", or key, with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a silver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or badge of the baron to whose family he belonged, had barely the word SHERWOOD engraved upon it.---\"How mean you by that?\" said the gay Minstrel, mingling in the conversation of the peasants; \"I came to seek one subject for my rhyme, and, by\u0027r Lady, I were glad to find two.\"\\n\\n \"It is well avouched,\" said the elder peasant, \"that after Athelstane of Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks---\"\\n\\n \"That is impossible,\" said the Minstrel; \"I saw him in life at the Passage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.\"\\n\\n \"Dead, however, he was, or else translated,\" said the younger peasant; \"for I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund\u0027s singing the death\u0027s hymn for him; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle of Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for Mabel Parkins, who---\"\\n\\n \"Ay, dead was Athelstane,\" said the old man, shaking his head, \"and the more pity it was, for the old Saxon blood---\"\\n\\n \"But, your story, my masters---your story,\" said the Minstrel, somewhat impatiently.\\n\\n \"Ay, ay---construe us the story,\" said a burly Friar, who stood beside them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrim\u0027s staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion served,---\"Your story,\" said the stalwart churchman; \"burn not daylight about it---we have short time to spare.\"\\n\\n \"An please your reverence,\" said Dennet, \"a drunken priest came to visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund\u0027s------\"\\n\\n \"It does not please my reverence,\" answered the churchman, \"that there should be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that a layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the holy man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot unsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine---I have felt it myself.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then,\" answered Father Dennet, \"a holy brother came to visit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund\u0027s---a sort of hedge-priest is the visitor, and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the tinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch of bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and a merry, who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a Cheshire round, with e\u0027er a man in Yorkshire.\"\\n\\n \"That last part of thy speech, Dennet,\" said the Minstrel, \"has saved thee a rib or twain.\"\\n\\n \"Tush, man, I fear him not,\" said Dennet; \"I am somewhat old and stiff, but when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster---\"\\n\\n \"But the story---the story, my friend,\" again said the Minstrel.\\n\\n \"Why, the tale is but this---Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at Saint Edmund\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a lie, and a loud one,\" said the Friar, \"for I saw him borne to his own Castle of Coningsburgh.\"\\n\\n \"Nay, then, e\u0027en tell the story yourself, my masters,\" said Dennet, turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of his comrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale. ---\"These two \u0027sober\u0027 friars,\" said he at length, \"since this reverend man will needs have them such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not, for the best part for a summer\u0027s day, when they were aroused by a deep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased Athelstane entered the apartment, saying, \u0027Ye evil shep-herds!---\u0027\"\\n\\n \"It is false,\" said the Friar, hastily, \"he never spoke a word.\"\\n\\n \"So ho! Friar Tuck,\" said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the rustics; \"we have started a new hare, I find.\"\\n\\n \"I tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,\" said the Hermit, \"I saw Athelstane of Coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had his shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre---A butt of sack will not wash it out of my memory.\"\\n\\n \"Pshaw!\" answered the Minstrel; \"thou dost but jest with me!\"\\n\\n \"Never believe me,\" said the Friar, \"an I fetched not a knock at him with my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided through his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!\"\\n\\n \"By Saint Hubert,\" said the Minstrel, \"but it is a wondrous tale, and fit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, \u0027Sorrow came to the old Friar.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Laugh, if ye list,\" said Friar Tuck; \"but an ye catch me singing on such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him headlong! No, no---I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some good work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the like matter of godly service, and therefore am I here.\"\\n\\n As they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance from the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen sounds fell successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient space for each to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again filled by repetition of the iron knell. These sounds, the signal of the approaching ceremony, chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled multitude, whose eyes were now turned to the Preceptory, expecting the approach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the criminal.\\n\\n At length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing the great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by six trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the Grand Master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture was of the simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed cap-a-pie in bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword, which were borne by his two esquires behind him. His face, though partly hidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrel-cap, bore a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed to contend with irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not slept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the habitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the Temple. His general appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking at him with attention, men read that in his dark features, from which they willingly withdrew their eyes.\\n\\n On either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin, who acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes of peace, the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other Companions of the Temple, with a long train of esquires and pages clad in black, aspirants to the honour of being one day Knights of the Order. After these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot, in the same sable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the accused, moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the scene of her fate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance there should be among them some of those amulets which Satan was supposed to bestow upon his victims, to deprive them of the power of confession even when under the torture. A coarse white dress, of the simplest form, had been substituted for her Oriental garments; yet there was such an exquisite mixture of courage and resignation in her look, that even in this garb, and with no other ornament than her long black tresses, each eye wept that looked upon her, and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a creature so goodly into a vessel of wrath, and a waged slave of the devil.\\n\\n A crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the victim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks bent upon the ground.\\n\\n This slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of which was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around them from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a halt. There was then a momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all his attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted from their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by the esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.\\n\\n The unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the pile. On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the body, she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally doubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space of a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to familiarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally turned away her head.\\n\\n Meanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry of his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank, a loud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court were seated for judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the champion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was the pledge of battle, at the feet of the Grand Master.\\n\\n \"Valorous Lord, and reverend Father,\" said he, \"here standeth the good Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the Temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your reverence\u0027s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this day, to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly deserved the doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;---here, I say, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be your noble and sanctified pleasure.\"\\n\\n \"Hath he made oath,\" said the Grand Master, \"that his quarrel is just and honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the \u0027Te igitur\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Sir, and most reverend father,\" answered Malvoisin, readily, \"our brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation in the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise he ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and may take no oath.\"\\n\\n This explanation was satisfactory, to Albert\u0027s great joy; for the wily knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his doing so.\\n\\n The Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin, commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets then again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed aloud,---\"Oyez, oyez, oyez.---Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to try by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to such champion the reverend and valorous Grand Master here present allows a fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else appertains to a fair combat.\" The trumpets again sounded, and there was a dead pause of many minutes.\\n\\n \"No champion appears for the appellant,\" said the Grand Master. \"Go, herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her in this her cause.\" The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was seated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse\u0027s head toward that end of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and Mont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebecca\u0027s chair as soon as the herald.\\n\\n \"Is this regular, and according to the law of combat?\" said Malvoisin, looking to the Grand Master.\\n\\n \"Albert de Malvoisin, it is,\" answered Beaumanoir; \"for in this appeal to the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having that communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the truth of the quarrel.\"\\n\\n In the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms: ---\"Damsel, the Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demands of thee, if thou art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?\"\\n\\n \"Say to the Grand Master,\" replied Rebecca, \"that I maintain my innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become guilty of mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms will permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is in man\u0027s extremity, will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed, may His holy will be done!\" The herald retired to carry this answer to the Grand Master.\\n\\n \"God forbid,\" said Lucas Beaumanoir, \"that Jew or Pagan should impeach us of injustice!---Until the shadows be cast from the west to the eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this unfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for death.\"\\n\\n The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce promise herself from man. During this awful pause, the voice of Bois-Guilbert broke upon her ear---it was but a whisper, yet it startled her more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.\\n\\n \"Rebecca,\" said the Templar, \"dost thou hear me?\"\\n\\n \"I have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,\" said the unfortunate maiden.\\n\\n \"Ay, but dost thou understand my words?\" said the Templar; \"for the sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know on what ground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.---This listed space---that chair---these faggots---I know their purpose, and yet it appears to me like something unreal---the fearful picture of a vision, which appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my reason.\"\\n\\n \"My mind and senses keep touch and time,\" answered Rebecca, \"and tell me alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body, and open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.\"\\n\\n \"Dreams, Rebecca,---dreams,\" answered the Templar; \"idle visions, rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me, Rebecca,\" he said, proceeding with animation; \"a better chance hast thou for life and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee behind me on my steed---on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider. I won him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond---mount, I say, behind me---in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind---a new world of pleasure opens to thee---to me a new career of fame. Let them speak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert from their list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood whatever blot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.\"\\n\\n \"Tempter,\" said Rebecca, \"begone!---Not in this last extremity canst thou move me one hair\u0027s-breadth from my resting place ---surrounded as I am by foes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy---avoid thee, in the name of God!\"\\n\\n Albert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their conference, now advanced to interrupt it.\\n\\n \"Hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?\" he demanded of Bois-Guilbert; \"or is she resolute in her denial?\"\\n\\n \"She is indeed resolute,\" said Bois-Guilbert.\\n\\n \"Then,\" said Malvoisin, \"must thou, noble brother, resume thy place to attend the issue---The shades are changing on the circle of the dial---Come, brave Bois-Guilbert---come, thou hope of our holy Order, and soon to be its head.\"\\n\\n As he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight\u0027s bridle, as if to lead him back to his station.\\n\\n \"False villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?\" said Sir Brian, angrily. And shaking off his companion\u0027s grasp, he rode back to the upper end of the lists.\\n\\n \"There is yet spirit in him,\" said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet, \"were it well directed---but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever approaches it.\"\\n\\n The Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the appearance of a champion.\\n\\n \"And reason good,\" said Friar Tuck, \"seeing she is a Jewess---and yet, by mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times a witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce Templar, ere he carried the matter off thus.\"\\n\\n It was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear for a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by Malvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the pledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging his horse to speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. A hundred voices exclaimed, \"A champion! a champion!\" And despite the prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard, The second glance, however, served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited. His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared to reel from fatigue, and the rider, however undauntedly he presented himself in the lists, either from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed scarce able to support himself in the saddle.\\n\\n To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, \"I am a good knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just and lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York; to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and to defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as I will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of God, of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good knight.\"\\n\\n \"The stranger must first show,\" said Malvoisin, \"that he is good knight, and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her champions against nameless men.\"\\n\\n \"My name,\" said the Knight, raising his helmet, \"is better known, my lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\"\\n\\n \"I will not fight with thee at present,\" said the Templar, in a changed and hollow voice. \"Get thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse, and it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this boyish spirit of bravado.\"\\n\\n \"Ha! proud Templar,\" said Ivanhoe, \"hast thou forgotten that twice didst thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre---remember the Passage of Arms at Ashby---remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of Rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that thou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour thou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I will proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe---in every Preceptory of thine Order--unless thou do battle without farther delay.\"\\n\\n Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and then exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, \"Dog of a Saxon! take thy lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!\"\\n\\n \"Does the Grand Master allow me the combat?\" said Ivanhoe.\\n\\n \"I may not deny what thou hast challenged,\" said the Grand Master, \"provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou wert in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever been, yet would I have thee honourably met with.\"\\n\\n \"Thus---thus as I am, and not otherwise,\" said Ivanhoe; \"it is the judgment of God---to his keeping I commend myself. ---Rebecca,\" said he, riding up to the fatal chair, \"dost thou accept of me for thy champion?\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" she said---\"I do,\" fluttered by an emotion which the fear of death had been unable to produce, \"I do accept thee as the champion whom Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no---no---thy wounds are uncured---Meet not that proud man---why shouldst thou perish also?\"\\n\\n But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and assumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked, as he clasped his visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the variety of emotions by which he had been agitated, continued during the whole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much flushed.\\n\\n The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice, repeating thrice---\"Faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!\" After the third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed, that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. The Grand Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca\u0027s glove, now threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words, \"Laissez aller\".\\n\\n The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career. The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went down, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous steed of the Templar. This issue of the combat all had foreseen; but although the spear of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield of Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to the astonishment of all who beheld it reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell in the lists.\\n\\n Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot, hastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose not. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the sword\u0027s point to his throat, commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot. Bois-Guilbert returned no answer.\\n\\n \"Slay him not, Sir Knight,\" cried the Grand Master, \"unshriven and unabsolved---kill not body and soul! We allow him vanquished.\"\\n\\n He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered champion. His eyes were closed---the dark red flush was still on his brow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened---but they were fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to the pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.\\n\\n \"This is indeed the judgment of God,\" said the Grand Master, looking upwards---\"\u0027Fiat voluntas tua!\u0027\"\\n\\n \\n\\n 愿毛勃雷身上的罪恶那么沉重，\\n\\n 压断唾沫四溅的战马的脊梁，\\n\\n 把马背上的人摔在比武场上，\\n\\n 像一个卑鄙的懦夫……！\\n\\n 《理查二世》(注)\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)莎士比亚的历史剧，引文见第一幕第二场。\\n\\n 我们的场面又得移到圣殿会堂外面了，大约再过一小时，这里便要进行一场血战，决定丽贝卡的生死问题。现在场子上人山人海，热闹异常，仿佛周围数十里的居民都倾巢而出，在这儿参加宗教庆典或乡村节日一般。爱看流血和杀人，不是那个黑暗时代所特有的，但在个人决斗和集体比武流行的社会，大家对勇士经过厮杀倒在血泊中，已习以为常。哪怕道德水平大有提高的今天，执行死刑，拳击比赛，聚众闹事，或者激进改革派的集会，都会吸引大批人群，不顾可能遇到的危险前去观看；其实他们不是关心这事，只是想看看它是怎么进行的，或者那些英雄好汉，用叛乱分子的豪言壮语说，究竟谁是“硬汉子”，谁是“软骨头”。\\n\\n 因此相当多的人，都把眼睛钉住了圣殿会堂的大门，想一睹队伍入场的壮观；更多的人则聚集在比武场四周，把它围得水泄不通。这场地是属于会堂的，与它连成一片，地面曾经过仔细平整，平时便在这里进行军事操练或武术比赛。它位在一个平坦的高丘顶上，周围筑有坚固的栅栏，由于圣殿骑士们欢迎大家前去观看他们的武艺表演，场内建有宽广的看台和观众席位。\\n\\n 现在场子的东端高耸着一个豪华的座位，那是为大宗师准备的，它的两旁便是荣誉席，是会督和骑士们的席位，这些座位上空飘扬着一面神圣的大旗，称作黑白神旗，它是圣殿骑士团的标志，也是他们作战时的口号。\\n\\n 场子的另一头放着一堆木柴，木柴中间有一根火刑柱，深深固定在地下，柴堆中只留出一条通道，以便受刑者进入这个可怕的圈子，然后由已经挂在那儿的镣铐和锁链捆绑在柱子上。在这些死刑设施旁边，站着四个黑奴，他们的黝黑皮肤和相貌，当时在英国还很罕见，这使群众看了胆战心惊，仿佛那是专门用来行使魔法的恶鬼。这些人都一动不动，只是在一个似乎是他们的头目的人指挥下，不时搬动一下木柴。他们从不看群众一眼，好像根本没有意识到周围的人和事物的存在，他们关心的只是怎样行使他们的骇人职责。在互相讲话时，他们噘起了肥厚的嘴唇，露出了洁白的牙齿，仿佛在对即将搬演的悲剧发出傻笑。惶恐不安的群众看了他们，恐怕不得不认为，这些人便是女巫行使魔法的共谋犯，现在只是因为她的死期已到，他们才反戈一击，充当起对她实行可怕的惩罚的帮手。大家交头接耳，谈论着魔王在那个动乱和不幸的时期中使的各种花招，当然难免把不是魔鬼干的事也算到了魔鬼的账上。\\n\\n “丹尼特老爹，”一个农民对另一个上了年纪的农民说，“你有没有听到，魔鬼把撒克逊大庄主科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦带走了？”\\n\\n “对，但是靠上帝和圣邓斯坦的保佑，他又把他送回来了。”\\n\\n “这是怎么回事？”一个活泼的小伙子问，他穿一件绣金的绿大褂，后面跟着一个粗壮的小孩，背上挂着一只竖琴，这透露了他的职业。这个行吟诗人似乎不是普通的老百姓，因为除了那件豪华的绣花上衣以外，他的脖颈里还套着一根银项链，链子上挂着校音器或钥匙，那是调准竖琴的音调的。他的右臂上有一块银牌，牌上不是像一般那样刻着他所属的贵族家庭的纹章或标记，它只有一个字：“舍伍德”。“你的话是什么意思？”快活的行吟诗人加入了农民的谈话，“我到这儿来，本想为我的歌曲找一个题材，但是圣母保佑，我一下子找到了两个，这太好了。”\\n\\n “据大家传说，”年长的农民道，“科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦死了四个星期以后……”\\n\\n “那是不可能的，”行吟诗人说，“我在阿什贝的比武大会上，看到他还活得好好的。”\\n\\n “可是他死了，或者灵魂上了天，”年轻的农民说，“因为我听到圣埃德蒙的修士为他唱安魂歌，而且科宁斯堡还举办了丰盛的丧筵，施舍了财物，这是确确实实的，我本来也要上那儿，只是梅布尔·帕金斯……”\\n\\n “唉，阿特尔斯坦死了，”老人说，摇摇头，“尤其可惜的是，古老的撒克逊王家血统就此……”\\n\\n “但是你们的故事，两位师傅，你们的故事，”行吟诗人说，有些焦急。\\n\\n “对，对，把故事讲下去呀，”一个粗犷的修士插嘴道。他站在他们旁边，靠在一根棍棒上，它的外形介于朝圣者的手杖和铁头木棍之间，也许视情况的不同，它兼有两者的用处。“讲故事吧，”魁梧的教士又道，“别磨磨蹭蹭的，我们没这么多时间。”\\n\\n “要是这位长老爱听的话，”丹尼特说道，“那天有一个喝得醉醺醺的神父来到圣埃德蒙修道院，拜访执事……”\\n\\n “我可不爱听这种谎话，”教士答道，“神父怎么会喝得醉醺醺的，即使有，俗人也不该这么讲。说话得有分寸，我的朋友，只能说这位圣徒一心在思考经文，以致想得出了神，脚步也有些摇晃了，好像刚喝饱了酒；我便有过这种体验。”\\n\\n “那么好吧，”丹尼特老爹说道， “一位神父来到埃德蒙修道院拜访执事——不过那是个不守清规的教士，森林里偷走的鹿一半是他杀的，他觉得酒壶的叮当声比教堂里圣铃的声音更悦耳，一块咸猪肉比一本祈祷书更有意思；至于别的，他倒是个好人，总是高高兴兴的，还会舞枪弄棒，弯弓射箭，跟约克郡随便哪个小伙子都会跳舞。”\\n\\n “丹尼特，”行吟诗人说道，“多亏最后这几句话，你才没给打断一根、甚至两根肋骨。”\\n\\n “去你的，小伙子，我不怕他，”丹尼特说。“我老了，手脚不灵，可是当年我在唐卡斯特跟人比赛摔跤……”\\n\\n “但是故事，你的故事，朋友，”行吟诗人又提醒他道。\\n\\n “得啦，故事就是这样：科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦是葬在圣埃德蒙修道院的。”\\n\\n “那是胡说，彻头彻尾的胡说，”修士道，“因为我看见他给抬回科宁斯堡他自己的家中了。”\\n\\n “那么请你自己讲吧，大师傅，”丹尼特说，他一再遭到反驳，有些生气了；他的伙伴和行吟诗人讲了许多好话，最后老农民才消了气，继续讲他的故事：“那两个清醒的教士——因为这位师傅一定说他们没喝酒呢——不断喝甜麦酒，葡萄酒，还有别的什么酒，足足喝了大半天，突然听到了沉重的呻吟声，当嘟当啷的锁链声，过了一会，阿特尔斯坦这个死人突然走进了屋子，说道：‘你们这些坏心肠的教士！’……”\\n\\n “不要瞎说，”修士慌忙插嘴道，“他根本没有讲话。”\\n\\n “好啦！塔克修士，”行吟诗人说，把他从两个乡下人身边拉开了，“我看我们又要自找麻烦了。”\\n\\n “我告诉你，阿伦阿代尔，”修士说，“我亲眼看到了科宁斯堡的阿特尔斯坦，他跟个活人一样，裹着尸衣，浑身都是一股泥土味。哪怕再喝一桶酒，我也忘不了这情形。”\\n\\n “别胡诌！”行吟诗人答道，“你这是在逗我呢！”\\n\\n “不骗你，”修士说，“我还抡起我的铁头木棍，朝他狠狠挨了一下，可是奇怪，棍子从他身上穿了过去，好像打在一阵烟上！”\\n\\n “我的圣休伯特！”行吟诗人说，“不过这倒是个有趣的故事，可以配上古老的曲调，编成一支《老修士遇到了新烦恼》。”\\n\\n “你要笑就笑吧，”塔克修士说，“但是我决不唱这种歌，免得魔鬼找我的麻烦，把我抓走！不，决不，我当时就许下愿心，要为行善积德出一把力，如有烧死女巫、决斗断案之类的功德，一定要参加，这样我就到这儿来了。”\\n\\n 他们正在这么谈论，圣迈克尔教堂的大钟响了，打断了他们的谈话。这教堂属于圣殿会堂，位在离会堂不远的一个庄子里。钟声显得阴森可怕，一声接一声的，中间停顿一下，等它的回声在远处消失之后，又把另一声送到空中。这些钟声便是典礼即将开始的信号，它使汇集的人群心中发冷，充满了恐怖；现在大家的眼睛转向了会堂，等待着大宗师、比武的勇士和犯人的出场。\\n\\n 最后吊桥放下了，大门打开了，一个骑士举着骑士团的大旗，从城堡内疾驰而出，他的前面有六个号手，后面是会督，他们两个一排，最后才是大宗师，他骑着高头大马，但马身上的装饰十分简单。他的后面是布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，他全副武装，穿着明晃晃的盔甲，但没有拿枪、盾和剑，它们由他后面的两名扈从拿着。他的脸虽然给军盔顶上飘下来的长长的羽饰遮没了一部分，仍能看到它流露着强烈而复杂的感情，似乎倔傲和犹豫正在他心中搏斗。他的脸色死一般的苍白，仿佛他已几夜没睡，然而他骑在战马上，仍像平时一样轻松自如，表现了这位最著名的圣殿骑士的优美风度。他的整个外表显得庄重、威严，然而只要仔细观察，便不难发现他的阴暗面貌中隐藏着一股杀气，使人不寒而栗，不敢逼视。\\n\\n 骑在他两边的，是康拉德·蒙特菲舍和艾伯特·马尔沃辛，他们担任了比武的监督官，穿着礼服，也就是骑士团的白色会服。他们后面跟着圣殿骑士团的其他骑士，还有长长一队穿黑衣的扈从和侍仆，这些人都是向往着有朝一日获得骑士的荣誉的。在这些新手后面是一队步行的卫士，他们穿着黑色制服，从他们高举的长矛中间，可以望见女犯人的苍白面容，她正迈着缓慢、但毫不气馁的步子，走向决定她命运的场所。她已被卸下了所有的装饰品，免得她利用它们夹带符箓，据说这种符箓是魔鬼授予他的门徒的，有了它们，哪怕在严刑逼供下，他们也不会招供。现在她已脱下那身东方衣衫，穿着粗布白衣服，它根本谈不到式样，然而哪怕是这身打扮，除了一绺绺乌黑的长发以外，没有别的装饰，她的眉宇间依然流露出一种英勇无畏和听天由命相结合的安详神色，以致看到她的每只眼睛都不由得流下眼泪，甚至那个铁石心肠的老顽固也不免感到惋惜，觉得这么一个美人实在不应该遭到命运的这番播弄，以致天怒人怨，沦落为魔鬼手中的驯服工具。\\n\\n 会堂的仆役和差人跟在犯人后面，大家合抱着手臂，眼望着地面，慢慢走着，谁也不敢乱动，显得秩序井然。\\n\\n 这大队人马缓缓走上平坦的斜坡，登上比武场所在的高地；进入那里之后，便从右向左绕场一周，然后止步站立。于是大宗师和他的随从，除了比武的勇士和两个监督官，都纷纷跨下马背，马也由专为这事侍候在左右的扈从们立即牵出了比武场。\\n\\n 不幸的丽贝卡给带到了靠近柴堆的黑椅子前面；当她第一眼看到那个可怕的地点，那个准备给她带来精神折磨，同样也给她带来肉体痛苦的场所时，可以看出她哆嗦了一下，闭上了眼睛，显然，她在心中祈祷，因为她的嘴唇在翁动，尽管没有发出任何声音。但是过了一分钟，她便睁开眼睛，向柴堆注视了一会，仿佛要让她的头脑接受这事实，然后才不慌不忙地把头转开。\\n\\n 这时大宗师升座了，骑士们按照各自的地位，在大宗师的周围或背后坐下。接着响起了嘹亮而漫长的号角声，它宣告法庭已正式开庭。然后马尔沃辛作为比武的监督官，走前一步，把犹太姑娘的手套，她要求决斗的信物，放到了大宗师的脚下。\\n\\n “英勇而仁慈的大宗师阁下，”他开口道，“现在我把决斗的信物放在您尊贵的脚下，并带领圣殿骑士团会督级骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔前来向您报到，他作为接受挑战的杰出骑士，将在今天履行决斗的义务，以证明本骑士团的神圣法庭所作判决正确无误，该名为丽贝卡的犹太女子确系女巫，她的处死是罪有应得。该骑士现已作好准备，将按照骑士的方式进行光荣的决斗，现特请尊贵的大宗师明示，予以允准。”\\n\\n “他已经对天盟誓，保证他的控告是公正而诚实的吗？”大宗师说。“把基督受难十字架和弥撒祈祷书拿来。”\\n\\n “尊贵的大宗师阁下，”马尔沃辛立即答道，“我们的兄弟布里恩已在康拉德·蒙特菲舍骑士主持下对天盟誓，保证他的指控是诚实的；他不能采取其他的宣誓方式，因为他的对方是一个不信基督的异教徒，是无权宣誓的。”\\n\\n 这说明获得了允准，使艾伯特如释重负源来这个狡黠的骑士早已预见到，要布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔当众这么宣誓是非常困难，几乎不可能的，这样他才想出了这个借口，避免了不必要的麻烦。\\n\\n 大宗师同意了艾伯特·马尔沃辛的解释以后，便命令典礼官上场行使职责。这时号角再次吹响了，一名典礼官站到前面，大声宣告：“全体肃静，请注意！圣殿骑士团骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔阁下在此接受挑战，以决定犹太女子而贝卡所受到的指控是否公正。鉴于丽贝卡系一女子，依法可由他人代为决斗，任何身家清白的骑士均可代替她上场应战；圣殿骑土四尊贵而英勇的大宗师业已允准，该骑士可在本场地，在阳光与风向完全相同的条件下，进行公平合理的决斗。”号音又响了一遍，接着死一般的沉寂保持了好几分钟。\\n\\n “没有人为申诉人上场比武，”大宗师说。“典礼官，去问问她，是不是有人会为这件事替她战斗。”\\n\\n 典礼官走向丽贝卡坐的椅子；这时布瓦吉贝尔也掉转马头，不顾马尔沃辛和蒙特菲舍在两旁对他使眼色，向比武场的另一头跑去，与典礼官同时到达了丽贝卡的椅边。\\n\\n “按照比武的规则，这合适吗？”马尔沃辛向大宗师问道。\\n\\n “艾伯特·马尔沃辛，这是可以的，”博马诺答道，“因为在祈求上帝作出判断时，我们不能禁止双方自由接触，这样才有利于揭开案情的真相。”\\n\\n 与此同时，典礼官向丽贝卡这么说道；“小姑娘，光荣而公正的大宗师问你，今天你是否有希望得到一个代你决斗的武士，或者你愿意承认你受到的制裁是公正的，因而接受死刑的判决？”\\n\\n “请你回复大宗师，”丽贝卡答道，“我坚持我是无辜的，我不承认对我的制裁是公正的，否则我便犯了抛弃我的生命的罪。请你对他说，我要求在他的规则所允许的范围内，尽量延长时间涸为上帝总是在人濒临绝境时才赐予机会的，到那时上帝也许会给我送来一位拯救者；如果过了期限，一切照旧，那么就照他的旨意办吧！”\\n\\n 典礼官把这答复回报了大宗师。\\n\\n “上帝保佑，不要让犹太人或异教徒指责我们不公正！”卢加斯·博马诺说道。“我们可以等到太阳平西，日影向东投射时，看有没有人自告奋勇，愿为这不幸的女人决斗。但是到了那个时刻，请她准备就死吧。”\\n\\n 典礼官又把大宗师的话传给了丽贝卡，她俯首恭听，合抱着双手，然后仰起了脸，似乎在祈求上帝赐给她不能在人间得到的帮助。在这可怕的沉寂中，布瓦吉贝尔的声音传进了她的耳朵，它轻轻的，然而比典礼官的大声通报更使她心惊胆战。\\n\\n “丽贝卡，”圣殿骑士道，“你听到我的话吗？”\\n\\n “我不想听你的话，残忍而狠心的人，”不幸的少女说。\\n\\n “唉，但是你明白我的意思吗？”圣殿骑士说，“现在我的声音在我自己听来也变得非常可怕了。我简直不知道我们是站在什么地方，或者他们把我们带到这儿来是什么目的。这片比武场地，那把椅子，那些木柴，我知道它们是作什么用的，然而我总觉得这一切不像是真的，这只是骇人的幻景，它使我惶恐，使我厌恶，但是不能使我的理智相信这是真的。”\\n\\n “我的头脑和感官都很清醒，明确，”丽贝卡答道，“它们都告诉我，这些木柴是要用来消灭我尘世的身体，但也为我进入更美好的世界，开辟了一条痛苦的、然而短暂的道路。”\\n\\n “这是梦想，丽贝卡，梦想，”圣殿骑士答道，“虚假的幻想，连你们比较明智的撒都该人(注1)也不会信以为真。听我说，丽贝卡，”他怀着激动的心情继续道，“现在你还有一个活命和自由的机会，这是那些混蛋和那个老顽固做梦也不会想到的。请你跳上我的马，骑在我的背后——我的札莫尔是一匹慓悍的马，它决不会让骑它的人遭到危险，这是我跟特拉布松(注2)的苏丹决斗时赢得的。我说，跳上马背，骑在我的后面。只要短短一个小时，我就可以把追赶的人甩得远远的，于是欢乐的新世界便会出现在你的面前，而对于我，这是一条新的荣誉的道路。让他们去谈他们的审判吧，我根本不在乎；让他们把布瓦吉贝尔的名字从修道士的奴隶名单上抹掉好了！如果他们胆敢污蔑我的纹章，我就要他们付出鲜血的代价。”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注1)犹太教中的一派，不相信灵魂永生和肉身复活。\\n\\n (注2)位在土耳其的一个中世纪伊斯兰国家。\\n\\n “滚开，魔鬼！”丽贝卡说。“哪怕到了这最后的时刻，你也不能使我的决心动摇一丝一毫。尽管我的周围都是敌人，我仍认为你是我最凶恶的、不共戴天的敌人；我用上帝的名义命令你走开！”\\n\\n 他们的谈判拖了这么长时间，艾伯特·马尔沃辛再也不能忍耐，终于走上前来制止他们了。\\n\\n “小姑娘有没有承认她有罪？”他问布瓦吉贝尔，“难道她到死也不肯认罪吗？”\\n\\n “是的，她宁死也不认罪，”布瓦吉贝尔说。\\n\\n “那么。”马尔沃辛道，“尊贵的兄弟，请你回到你的位置，等待事情的结局吧。日晷的阴影已转移到另一边了。来吧，勇敢的布瓦吉贝尔——来吧，你是我们骑士团的希望，马上可以成为它的首领啦。”\\n\\n 他用安慰的声调这么说，一边把手按在他的缰绳上，似乎要把他领回他的岗位。\\n\\n “虚伪的坏蛋！你按住我的缰绳是什么意思？”布里恩骑士怒气冲冲地说。他摔开了朋友的手，骑回场子的上首了。\\n\\n “他的抵触情绪还很大，”马尔沃辛偷偷对蒙特菲舍说，“但愿他不致胡来，不致像希腊人的火药罐(注)，遇到什么便烧毁什么吧。”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)古代的一种火药发射器，据说是希腊人发明的，遇水不会熄灭，因此可以攻打战船和堡垒，烧毁一切。\\n\\n 法官们已在场上待了两个钟头，但是一个应战的人也没出现。\\n\\n “这是不奇怪的，因为她是一个犹太女于，”塔克修士说道。“不过凭良心说，这么年轻漂亮的女子就这么处死，没人肯替她厮打，实在叫人受不了！哪怕她身上附着十个魔鬼，只要她有一点基督徒的味道，我也得举起铁头木棍，把那个凶恶的圣殿骑士的钢盔打个稀巴烂，不让他逍遥法外。”\\n\\n 然而大家相信，没有人可能或愿意，为一个被指控行使巫术的犹太女子出场决斗；骑士们在马尔沃辛的怂恿下，纷纷交头接耳，认为可以宣布撤销丽贝卡的挑战了。然而正在这时，一个骑士马不停蹄地出现在旷野上，朝着比武场疾驰而来。千百个声音喊了起来：“斗士来了，斗士来了！”尽管先入之见已在群众中形成，他们看到这位骑士进入场子，还是一致发出了欢呼。然而仔细一看，骑士的及时到达所引起的希望，便告幻灭了。他的马经过长途跋涉已筋疲力尽，随时有倒下的危险；骑在马上的人虽然显得无所畏惧，但由于虚弱、疲倦，或者两者的共同作用，几乎在马鞍上已有些支撑不住了。\\n\\n 典礼官当即要他自报身分、姓名和意图，陌生的骑士有恃无恐、理直气壮地答道：“我是正式的骑士，贵族出身，现在前来用我的剑和枪，为这位姑娘，约克的以撤的女儿丽贝卡，主持正义，保护她的合法权利；证明对她的判罪毫无事实根据，是错误的，并向布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔骑士这个叛徒、凶手和骗子发出挑战；我要在这片场地上，在上帝、圣母和杰出的骑士圣乔治的帮助下，凭我与他的比武，证明上面所说的一切。”\\n\\n “来人必须首先证明他是正式的骑士，具有清白的家世，”马尔沃辛说道。“圣殿骑士从来不与无名小卒决斗。”\\n\\n “我的名字比你的更响亮，我的家世比你的更清白，马尔沃辛，”骑士答道，揭开了面甲。“我是艾文荷的威尔弗莱德。”\\n\\n “目前我还不想与你决斗，”圣殿骑士说道，他的声音变了，显得有些虚张声势。“还是先把你的伤养好，把你的马喂饱吧，到那时也许我会觉得，为了教训一下你这个初出茅庐的小子，还值得跟你较量一下。”\\n\\n “哈！傲慢的圣殿骑士，”艾文荷答道，“你忘记曾在这支枪前两次摔下马背吗？想想在阿克的比武，想想在阿什贝的较量，想想你在罗瑟伍德的大厅上夸下的海口吧，那时你用你的金链子与我的圣物盒打赌，说要与艾文荷的威尔弗莱德一决雌雄，恢复你失去的荣誉呢！凭我的圣物盒和盒中的圣骨起誓，除非你毫不拖延地与我决斗，我就要在欧洲的每个朝廷上，在你们骑士团的每个会堂中，宣布你这个圣殿骑士是一名怕死的懦夫！”\\n\\n 布瓦吉贝尔有些迟疑不决，回头看了看丽贝卡，然后对着艾文荷恶狠狠地喊道：“你这只撒克逊狗！既然你要讨死，那就拿起你的枪，准备死吧！”\\n\\n “大宗师同意我的决斗吗？”艾文荷问。\\n\\n “我不能否决你的挑战，只要那位姑娘接受你作她的斗士，”大宗师说。“然而我希望你改善一下你的条件再参加战斗。你一向仇视我们的骑士团，但我愿意公平地对待你。”\\n\\n “不必，我可以就这么参加决斗，”艾文荷说。“这是上帝的审判——我把自己交给他，听候他的裁决。”然后他把马骑到被告前面，说道：“丽贝卡，你接受我作你的斗士吗？”\\n\\n “我接受……接受……”她说，由于激动，她的声音有些发抖，这是她在死亡的恐怖面前也没有过的，“我接受你作我的斗士润为你是上帝派来救我的。然而，不……不……你的伤还没好。不要与那个傲慢的人决斗；为什么要让你也毁灭呢？”\\n\\n 但是艾文荷已来到他的位置上，放下了面甲，端起了长枪。布瓦吉贝尔也作好了准备；据他的扈从说，尽管由于各种错综复杂的感情在他心中搏斗，他的脸色整个早上都显得那么灰暗苍白，但是在他扣上面甲的时候，他突然变得红光满面，两颊发烧。\\n\\n 典礼官看到双方已站好位置，便提高嗓音，重复了三次：“履行你们的责任吧，勇敢的骑士们！”喊了第三声以后，他便退到边上，又用同样的声调宣布，任何人都不得用言语、叫喊或行动，干预或扰乱比武场上的战斗，否则便立即处死。大宗师手里拿着战斗的信物——丽贝卡的手套，现在把它丢进场内，宣布了一个不祥的命令：“开始！”\\n\\n 号角吹响了，两个骑士以最快的速度面对面冲去。艾文荷那匹疲惫不堪的马和马上那个同样疲惫不堪的人，正如大家所预料的，在圣殿骑士那支瞄准的长枪和那匹强壮的战马面前倒下了。战斗的这个结果是可想而知的，但是艾文荷的那支长枪虽然相比之下，只是在布瓦吉贝尔的盾牌上轻轻碰了一下，令观众大吃一惊的是，那位骑士却在马上晃了一晃，两脚顿时离开马镫，掉到了地上。\\n\\n 艾文荷的马倒下后，他立刻抽出身子，站了起来，为了改变不利的处境，马上拔出了剑；他的对手却没有站起来。威尔弗莱德用一只脚踹住他的胸口，把剑尖指向他的喉咙，命令他投降，否则就当场杀死他。布瓦吉贝尔什么也没回答。\\n\\n “不要杀死他，骑士先生，”大宗师喊道，“他还没忏悔，还没得到赦免。不要把他的灵魂和身体一起杀死！我们承认他打败了。”\\n\\n 他走进了比武场，下令给战败的骑士揭开头盔。他的眼睛紧闭着．深深的红潮仍留在他的脸上。当大家在惊异中端详他的时候，他的眼睛睁开了，但呆滞无神，一动不动。红潮逐渐从他的脸上消失，变成死一般的苍白。他不是给对方的枪刺死的，他是死在自己各种感情的激烈斗争中的。\\n\\n “这确实是上帝的判决，”大宗师仰起了头说，“愿你的旨意行在地上！(注)”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n
