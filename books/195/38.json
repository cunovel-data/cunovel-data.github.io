{"id":6129,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"Say not my art is fraud---all live by seeming. The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier Gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming; The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier Will eke with it his service.---All admit it, All practise it; and he who is content With showing what he is, shall have small credit In church, or camp, or state---So wags the world. Old Play\n Albert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor of the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that Philip Malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history, and was, like that baron, in close league with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\n Amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order included but too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished; but with this difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how to throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised. Had not the arrival of the Grand Master been so unexpectedly sudden, he would have seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to argue any relaxation of discipline. And, even although surprised, and, to a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made such haste to reform the particulars he censured, ---succeeded, in fine, so well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been lately devoted to license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began to entertain a higher opinion of the Preceptor\u0027s morals, than the first appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.\n But these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were greatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a house of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the paramour of a brother of the Order; and when Albert appeared before him, he was regarded with unwonted sternness.\n \"There is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order of the Temple,\" said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, \"a Jewish woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir Preceptor.\"\n Albert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate Rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building, and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being known. He read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to himself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.\n \"Why are you mute?\" continued the Grand Master.\n \"Is it permitted to me to reply?\" answered the Preceptor, in a tone of the deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an instant\u0027s space for arranging his ideas.\n \"Speak, you are permitted,\" said the Grand Master---\"speak, and say, knowest thou the capital of our holy rule,---\u0027De commilitonibus Templi in sancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter oblectationem carnis?\u0027\"*\n * The edict which he quotes, is against communion with * women of light character.\n \"Surely, most reverend father,\" answered the Preceptor, \"I have not risen to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most important prohibitions.\"\n \"How comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish sorceress, into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?\"\n \"A Jewish sorceress!\" echoed Albert Malvoisin; \"good angels guard us!\"\n \"Ay, brother, a Jewish sorceress!\" said the Grand Master, sternly. \"I have said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that wretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch Miriam, is now---shame to be thought or spoken! ---lodged within this thy Preceptory?\"\n \"Your wisdom, reverend father,\" answered the Preceptor, \"hath rolled away the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good a knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the charms of this female, whom I received into this house merely to place a bar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented at the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother.\"\n \"Hath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?\" demanded the Grand Master.\n \"What! under this roof?\" said the Preceptor, crossing himself; \"Saint Magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!---No! if I have sinned in receiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus break off our brother\u0027s besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed to me so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of insanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since your reverend wisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it may account fully for his enamoured folly.\"\n \"It doth!---it doth!\" said Beaumanoir. \"See, brother Conrade, the peril of yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan! We look upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure in what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion, obtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work which was begun by idleness and folly. It may be that our brother Bois-Guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe chastisement; rather the support of the staff, than the strokes of the rod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly, and restore him to his brethren.\"\n \"It were deep pity,\" said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, \"to lose to the Order one of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid of its sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain with his own hand.\"\n \"The blood of these accursed dogs,\" said the Grand Master, \"shall be a sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall burst the bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which the Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even heaps upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath flung her enchantments over a brother of the Holy Temple, assuredly she shall die the death.\"\n \"But the laws of England,\"---said the Preceptor, who, though delighted that the Grand Master\u0027s resentment, thus fortunately averted from himself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to fear he was carrying it too far.\n \"The laws of England,\" interrupted Beaumanoir, \"permit and enjoin each judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most petty baron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain. And shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within a preceptory of his Order? ---No!---we will judge and condemn. The witch shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be forgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.\"\n Albert Malvoisin bowed and retired,---not to give directions for preparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not long ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had anew sustained from the fair Jewess. \"The unthinking,\" he said, \"the ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved her life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until roof and rafters crackled and crashed around me. I was the butt of a hundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against a latticed casement, and the only use I made of my shield was for her protection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl upbraids me that I did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only the slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that ever she will be brought to grant any. The devil, that possessed her race with obstinacy, has concentrated its full force in her single person!\"\n \"The devil,\" said the Preceptor, \"I think, possessed you both. How oft have I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell you that there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who would think it sin to refuse so brave a knight \u0027le don d\u0027amoureux merci\u0027, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate Jewess! By the mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when he maintains she hath cast a spell over you.\"\n \"Lucas Beaumanoir!\"---said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully---\"Are these your precautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that Rebecca is in the Preceptory?\"\n \"How could I help it?\" said the Preceptor. \"I neglected nothing that could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the devil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I could; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied---the victim of magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.\"\n \"She shall not, by Heaven!\" said Bois-Guilbert.\n \"By Heaven, she must and will!\" said Malvoisin. \"Neither you nor any one else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of a Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous indulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.\"\n \"Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!\" said Bois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.\n \"What they may believe, I know not,\" said Malvoisin, calmly; \"but I know well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to the hundred, will cry \u0027amen\u0027 to the Grand Master\u0027s sentence.\"\n \"I have it,\" said Bois-Guilbert. \"Albert, thou art my friend. Thou must connive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some place of greater security and secrecy.\"\n \"I cannot, if I would,\" replied the Preceptor; \"the mansion is filled with the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted to him. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you in this matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have risked enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a sentence of degradation, or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake of a painted piece of Jewish flesh and blood. And you, if you will be guided by my counsel, will give up this wild-goose chase, and fly your hawk at some other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,---thy present rank, thy future honours, all depend on thy place in the Order. Shouldst thou adhere perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give Beaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and he knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will ruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of a Jewish sorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst not control him. When the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest caress the daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own humour.\"\n \"Malvoisin,\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"thou art a cold-blooded---\"\n \"Friend,\" said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which Bois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word, ---\"a cold-blooded friend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I tell thee once more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once more, thou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master---throw thyself at his feet and tell him---\"\n \"Not at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard\u0027s very beard will I say---\"\n \"Say to him, then, to his beard,\" continued Malvoisin, coolly, \"that you love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost enlarge on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by the avowal of a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren, and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between Flanders and Burgundy.\"\n \"Thou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,\" said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after a moment\u0027s reflection. \"I will give the hoary bigot no advantage over me; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should expose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast her off---yes, I will leave her to her fate, unless---\"\n \"Qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,\" said Malvoisin; \"women are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours---ambition is the serious business of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this Jewess, before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched before thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close conversation ---I must order the hall for his judgment-seat.\"\n \"What!\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"so soon?\"\n \"Ay,\" replied the Preceptor, \"trial moves rapidly on when the judge has determined the sentence beforehand.\"\n \"Rebecca,\" said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, \"thou art like to cost me dear---Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm hypocrite recommends?---One effort will I make to save thee---but beware of ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my love. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where contempt and reproaches are his only reward.\"\n The Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined by Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Master\u0027s resolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.\n \"It is surely a dream,\" said the Preceptor; \"we have many Jewish physicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful cures.\"\n \"The Grand Master thinks otherwise,\" said Mont-Fitchet; \"and, Albert, I will be upright with thee---wizard or not, it were better that this miserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest his high rank, his fame in arms---thou knowest the zeal with which many of our brethren regard him---but all this will not avail him with our Grand Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of this Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it were better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in her destruction.\"\n \"I have been working him even now to abandon her,\" said Malvoisin; \"but still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for sorcery?---Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that the proofs are so weak?\"\n \"They must be strengthened, Albert,\" replied Mont-Fitchet, \"they must be strengthened. Dost thou understand me?\"\n \"I do,\" said the Preceptor, \"nor do I scruple to do aught for advancement of the Order---but there is little time to find engines fitting.\"\n \"Malvoisin, they MUST be found,\" said Conrade; \"well will it advantage both the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor Preceptory---that of Maison-Dieu is worth double its value ---thou knowest my interest with our old Chief---find those who can carry this matter through, and thou art Preceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent---How sayst thou?\"\n \"There is,\" replied Malvoisin, \"among those who came hither with Bois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my brother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of Front-de-Boeuf---It may be they know something of the witcheries of this woman.\"\n \"Away, seek them out instantly---and hark thee, if a byzant or two will sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.\"\n \"They would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,\" said the Preceptor.\n \"Away, then,\" said Mont-Fitchet; \"at noon the affair will proceed. I have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned to the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.\"\n The ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca heard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place of confinement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and the circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the solitary visits of the fierce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of any evil that could befall her besides. The door of the chamber was unlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by four warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.\n \"Daughter of an accursed race!\" said the Preceptor, \"arise and follow us.\"\n \"Whither,\" said Rebecca, \"and for what purpose?\"\n \"Damsel,\" answered Conrade, \"it is not for thee to question, but to obey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought before the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to answer for thine offences.\"\n \"May the God of Abraham be praised!\" said Rebecca, folding her hands devoutly; \"the name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me as the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee---permit me only to wrap my veil around my head.\"\n They descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long gallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his court of justice.\n The lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and yeomen, who made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended by the Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of halberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her. As she passed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a scrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she received almost unconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents. The assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon the scene, which we shall endeavour to describe in the next chapter.\n \n 不要说我弄虚作假，大家都在这么生活，\n 乞丐讨饭必须装出一副可怜的外表，\n 大臣升官发财得靠营私舞弊，吹牛拍马，\n 教士自然深谙此道，不甘落后，\n 哪怕勇敢的战士也得夸大自己的功劳。\n 大家都容忍这点，大家也照此办理，\n 谁不想夸耀自己便只得终生潦倒，\n 教堂、军营或国家，世事变过莫不如此。\n 古戏剧\n 圣殿会堂的堂长，即他们所说的会督，是艾伯特·马尔沃辛，他就是本书中已提到过几次的菲利普·马尔沃辛的兄弟，他与那位男爵一样，也是布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔的亲密朋友。\n 虽然圣殿骑士中有的是放荡不羁、无法无天的人，圣殿会堂的艾伯特仍称得上其中的佼佼者；他与布瓦吉贝尔的不同，只是他知道怎么给他的罪行和野心，披上一层虚伪的纱幕，装出一副虔诚的外表，掩盖他桀骛不驯的内心。要不是大宗师出乎意外的突然驾临，他确实看不出圣殿会堂有哪一点触犯了戒律。但是，尽管他有些惊慌，并在一定程度上露出了破绽，对上级的申斥，他仍然洗耳恭听，表示真诚悔改，而且对遭到批评的各点，迅速加以改正；这样，会堂中腐化堕落、寻欢作乐的风气，终于有所改观，出现了人人清心寡欲、虔诚修炼的景象。卢加斯·博马诺也开始对会督的为人有了较高的评价，不再像起先看到会堂乌烟瘴气时那么反感了。\n 但是现在大宗师的这些好感从根本上动摇了，他从未想到，艾伯特居然会容许一个被俘的犹太女子住在神圣的会堂里，尤其可怕的是，这个女子竟是骑士团一个弟兄的情妇，因此当艾伯特出现在他面前时，他对他一反常态，变得声色俱厉。\n “这幢房子是献给纯洁的圣殿骑士团的，”大宗师说，口气严厉，“可是现在，会督阁下，有一个教友把犹太女人带到了这里，而且在你的纵容下，居住在这里。”\n 艾伯特。马尔沃辛一听，慌了手脚；因为不幸的丽贝卡关在一个偏僻而秘密的所在，加以防范严密，她的住处外人是不知道的。他从博马诺的神色中看到，要是不能扭转局面，他和布瓦吉贝尔便大祸临头了。\n “你为什么不开口？”大宗师继续道。\n “我现在可以回答吗？”会督答道，装出一副恭敬谦逊的样子，其实只是要借这个问题拖延一些时间，以便考虑对策。\n “你可以回答，”大宗师说。“我先问你，你可知道我们神圣的章程中有这么一条：‘圣殿骑士团的战士与不正派女人来往，只是为了满足自己的肉欲’？”\n “当然知道，尊敬的大宗师，”会督答道，“我如果连我们最重要的戒律中的这一条也不知道，那么就不配担任目前的职务了。”\n “那么我再问你一次，你允许一个弟兄带着他的情妇，这情妇又是一名犹太女巫，进入这个神圣的地方，玷污和亵渎我们的会堂，这是怎么回事？”\n “一名犹太女巫！”艾伯特·马尔沃辛接口道，“仁慈的天使保佑我们吧！”\n “对，兄弟，一名犹太女巫，”大宗师严厉地说，“我是这么说的。你敢否认，说这个丽贝卡，约克的异教徒高利贷者以撒的女儿，邪恶的妖妇米莉亚姆的学生，现在——想到和提到这事，我便感到可耻！——不是住在你这个会堂中吗？”\n “尊敬的大宗师，”会督答道，“您的智慧驱散了我的疑团，使我的心豁然开朗了。本来我一直奇怪，像布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔这么一个杰出的骑士，怎么会迷恋这个女人的姿色，不知醒悟呢？我让她暂时住在会堂中，只是为了限制她的行动，免得他们的关系进一步发展，以致铸成大错，使我们一位英勇虔诚的弟兄走上堕落的道路。”\n “那么他们之间还没有发生违反他的誓约的事？”大宗师问道。\n “什么！在这会堂里？”会督说，在身上划了个十字，“凭圣抹大拉和一万个童贞女起誓，没有这样的事！没有！如果我容许她待在这里是犯了罪，那么这只是出于一个错误想法，认为这可以防止我们的弟兄继续受到这个犹太女人的迷惑；在我看来，这件事这么荒唐，这么不近情理，我只能认为这是精神失常的表现，还是用同情而不是用责怪的办法医治较好。但是现在，大宗师的明智发现使我茅塞顿开，这个犹太妖妇原来是女巫，也许这便足以说明他那么迷恋她的原因了。”\n “是这样！是这样！”博马诺说。“瞧，康拉德兄弟，撒旦总是先用这些手段和诱惑使人堕落的！我们观看女人只是为了满足眼睛的欲望，享受男人所说的她的美色，但魔鬼这吃人的狮子便乘虚而入，获得了控制我们的权力，可以靠魔力和巫术完成懒惰和愚昧所开始的工作了。也许在这件事上，我们的弟兄布瓦吉贝尔应该得到同情，而不是严厉的惩罚，应该得到我的牧杖的支持，而不是权杖的打击；也许我们的训诫和祈祷可以促使他迷途知返，回到他的弟兄们中间。”\n “在我们的圣教会需要它的儿子们的帮助时，让我们的骑士团失去一个优秀的战士，这实在太不幸了，”康拉德·蒙特菲舍说道。“这个布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔亲手杀死过三百个萨拉森人呢。”\n “这些邪恶的富生的血，对遭到异教徒鄙弃和亵读的圣徒和天使，是美好而适当的祭品，”大宗师说。“圣徒和天使会帮助我们对抗巫术和妖法，从魔鬼的罗网中搭救我们的弟兄。他会挣脱这个大利拉的绳索，就像参孙挣脱非利士人捆绑他的两条新绳一样，(注)他会杀死那些邪教徒，叫他们尸积如山。但是这个邪恶的女巫，她用妖术蛊惑圣殿骑士团的一个弟兄，她当然应该处死。”\n --------\n (注)参孙是大力士，以色列人的士师。非利士人包围了犹太人，要他们献出参孙，他们只得用两条新绳捆住了他，交给非利士人，但参孙一到那里便挣脱绳子，杀死了敌人。后来非利士人收买了参孙的情妇大利拉，才终于绑住他，见《旧·士师记》第15、16章（参见本书第16章注）。\n “但是英国的法律……”会督说，虽然他喜出望外，发现大宗师的愤怒一下子从自己和布瓦吉贝尔这里，转移到了别人身上，但又担心这么做未免走得太远。\n “英国的法律，”博马诺打断了他的话，“允许也责成每个法官在他的职责范围内，行使审判权。一个最小的贵族也可以在自己的领地上，逮捕和审问女巫，对她绳之以法。难道圣殿骑士团的大宗师在他自己的会堂里，倒没有这种权力？不！我们有权审问和判刑。我们必须从这块土地上消灭女巫，这样，她所造成的罪恶才能得到赦免。把城堡的大厅收拾一下，马上准备审问这个妖逆。”\n 艾伯特·马尔沃辛鞠躬告退了。但他没有下令收拾大厅，先赶紧寻找市里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，把事情可能怎么了结通知他。隔了不多久，他找到了他，只见他气得呼哧呼哧的，原来又在美丽的犹太女郎那里碰了钉子。“这个自不量力、不知好歹的娘们，”他说，“居然不把一个冒了九死一生危险，从血与火中搭救她的人放在眼里！马尔沃辛，说真的！我在那里一直待到屋顶坍了，椽子断了才离开。我成了千百支箭的靶子，它们像冰雹打在窗棂上一样，咯嗒咯嗒射在我的身上，我的盾牌完全用来保护她了。为了她，我忍受了一切，现在倒好，这个固执任性的小娘们还怪我不让她死在那里，不仅一点感激的表示也没有，而且不让我抱任何希望，斩钉截铁地拒绝了我。她的民族受了魔鬼的迷惑，变得顽固不化，现在这种力量一定全部集中到了她的身上！”\n “我看，”会督说道，“你们两个人都给魔鬼迷住了。我不是常常劝你，即使不能悬崖勒马，至少也得小心一些吗？我早对你说过，在基督徒中有的是心甘情愿供你玩乐的娘们，她们见了你这么一位风流多情的英勇骑士，巴结你还来不及呢，可你偏偏一往情深，要钉住这个任性、顽固的犹太女人！凭良心说，我认为卢加斯·博马诺这老头猜得对，她是用魔法把你迷住了。”\n “卢加斯·博马诺！”布瓦吉贝尔说，露出了责备的意思。“马尔沃辛，你要我小心，原来是这么回事？你把丽贝卡在会堂的消息透露给那个老糊涂了？”\n “这叫我有什么办法？”会督说。“我采取了一切措施，要为你保守秘密；但它还是泄漏了，这是不是魔鬼搞的花招，只有魔鬼才知道。但我已尽力挽回这事，现在只要你放弃丽贝卡，便可以脱掉干系。你得到了同情，因为你只是魔法的受害者。她是女巫，必须受到应有的惩罚。”\n “凭老天起誓，我不同意！”布瓦吉贝尔说。\n “凭老天起誓，她必须，也一定会受到惩罚！”马尔沃辛说。“不论你还是任何别人，都无法救她。卢加斯·博马诺已经决定，处死犹太女子是必要的赎罪，它可以抵消圣殿骑士们犯下的种种放荡行为。要知道，他有权力也有决心实行这一合理而虔诚的意图。”\n “这种愚昧而荒唐的事，我们的后代谁会相信！”布瓦吉贝尔说，在屋子里大踏步地走来走去。\n “他们信不信，我不知道，”马尔沃辛安详地说，“我只知道，在我们今天，不论教士还是俗人，对大宗师的判决，一百个人中有九十九个会高喊‘阿门’。”\n “我有办法了，”布瓦吉贝尔说。“艾伯特，你是我的朋友；你必须装不知道，让她逃走，马尔沃辛，我会把她送往一个更安全和秘密的地方。”\n “即使我愿意，也不能这么做，”会督答道，“会堂里到处都有大宗师的随从和亲信。我可以坦率告诉你，兄弟，在这件事上我不能与你乘一条船，哪怕它有希望找到一个安全的港口。我已经为你冒了不少风险；我不想为了一个犹太女子的漂亮脸蛋，受到降级的处分，甚至失去我的会督职务。至于你，如果你肯听从我的劝告，你应该抛弃这只野鸭，用你的鹰去追逐别的猎物。你考虑吧，布瓦吉贝尔，你现在的地位，你未来的荣誉，都来自你作为骑士团成员的身分。如果你执迷不悟，非要这个丽贝卡不可，你无异使博马诺有权开除你，他不会放过你的。抓在他颤抖的手中的权标，他还不想放弃，他知道你正在把大胆的手伸向它，企图夺取他的权力。如果你坚持要保护一个犹太女巫，便是给他提供了一个最好的借口，他非把你搞得身败名裂不可。你还是让他一步为好，因为你还对付不了他。等权杖握到了你的手中，你要跟犹太女儿谈情说爱，还是烧死她们，就可以悉听尊便了。”\n “马尔沃辛，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“你是一个冷酷的……”\n “朋友，”会督抢先说完了那句话，免得布瓦吉贝尔用难听的话称呼他。“不错，我是一个冷酷的朋友，因此我才更适合给你提出忠告。我再向你说一遍：你救不了丽贝卡。我还得对你说：你只能与她一起毁灭。还是赶快找大宗师，跪在他的脚下，告诉他……”\n “我起誓，我不想跪在他的脚下！只想指着老家伙的鼻子对他说……”\n “那么就指着他的鼻子对他说吧，”马尔沃辛冷冷地继续道，“你说你俘获的这个犹太女子使你爱得发狂了；但是，你越是对你的爱情晓晚不休，他越是要加快步骤，处死漂亮的小妖精。既然你不打自招，承认犯了违背誓约的罪，你就无法指望得到弟兄们的帮助，只能抛弃你有权有势的锦绣前程，拿起你的长枪，给佛兰德或勃良第充当打手，为它们毫不足道的争执卖命了。”\n “你说得对，马尔沃辛，”布瓦吉贝尔考虑了一会之后，答道。“我不能让这个老顽固得逞，把我踩在脚下；说到丽贝卡，她也不配得到我的保护，我何必为她牺牲地位和荣誉。我还是抛弃她的好；是的，随她怎样吧，除非……”\n “不要给你明智而必要的决定，再附加什么条件，”马尔沃辛说。“女人只是男人消闲的玩物，功名利禄才是生命的核心。光辉的前途展开在你的面前，你应该大踏步向前走，哪怕把这个犹太女人那样的小东西踩死一千个，也毫不足惜！我们得暂时分开了，不能再让人看到我们在一起密谈；我得马上安排一下，好让他在大厅上审问案子。”\n “什么！”布瓦吉贝尔说，“这么快？”\n “对，”会督答道，“法官既已决定怎么判决，审问就该趁早进行。”\n 布瓦吉贝尔剩下一个人后，对自己说道：“丽贝卡，你把我害得够了。为什么我不能照这个冷酷的伪君子的建议，让你听任命运的摆布呢？我可以为挽救你再作一次努力；但当心，不要不知好歹！如果你再拒绝我，我的报复也会像我的爱一样强烈。布瓦吉贝尔的生命和荣誉决不能白白冒险，仅仅得到鄙视和谴责的回报。”\n 会督刚作了一些必要的安排，康拉德·蒙特菲舍已来找他，通知他，大宗师决定为妖术的事立即提审犹太女子。\n “这实在是莫须有的罪名，”会督说，“我们有不少犹太医生，他们治好了各种疑难杂症，可是我们从没说他们是巫师。”\n “大宗师不这么想，”蒙特菲舍说。“艾伯特，我可以坦率地告诉你，不论这个可怜的女子是不是巫师，让她死，比让骑士团失去布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，或者让骑士团由于内部的争论而分裂好一些。你知道，布里恩地位很高，战功卓著；你也知道，我们的许多弟兄衷心拥戴他；但那一切不能改变大宗师对他的看法，如果他相信布里恩是犹太女子的同谋犯，不是受害者。哪怕她一个人关系着犹太十二部族的存亡，处死她一个人，总比让布瓦吉贝尔与她一起毁灭的好。”\n “我刚才也一直在做他的工作，要他抛弃她，”马尔沃辛说。“但我还是觉得，要为施行妖术判处丽贝卡死罪，证据不够充分吧？大宗师一旦发觉证据不足，会不会改变主意？”\n “证据必须充足，艾伯特，”蒙特菲舍答道，“它们必须充足，你明白我的意思吗？”\n “明白，”会督说，“为了我们的会堂，我也什么都愿意做；但是时间太局促了，不容易找到合适的证人。”\n “但必须找到，马尔沃辛，”康拉德说，“这对整个团体和你都事关重大。这个会堂是个穷会堂，天府会堂比这里富裕一倍。你知道，老首长对我言听计从；你找到了能使这案产顺利进行的证人，你也就是肯特郡富饶的天府会堂的会督了。你认为怎么样？”\n “在随同布瓦吉贝尔来到这里的人中，”马尔沃辛答道，“有两个人我很熟悉，他们是我的兄弟菲利普·马尔沃辛的部下，后来投奔牛面将军的。也许他们对这个女人的妖术能提供一些情况。”\n “那好，马上去找他们。听着，如果需要一两个金币促进他们的记忆力，不要舍不得花钱。”\n “有了钱，他们甚至可以证明他们的亲生母亲是女巫呢，”会督说。\n “那么去吧，”蒙特菲舍说，“审问在中午就得开始。我还从没看到我们的老首长这么性急的，只有一次，那还是把一个皈依穆斯林的叛教分子哈米特·阿尔法吉判处火刑的时候。”\n 刚到中午，城堡的大钟打响了。丽贝卡听到通往四室的小楼梯上出现了脚步声，它告诉她，来的是几个人，这使她很高兴，因为她最怕死皮赖脸、自作多情的布瓦吉贝尔单独来找她，她觉得任何危险都比这好。囚室的锁开了，康拉德与马尔沃辛走了进来，后面还跟着四个穿黑衣服的执戟卫士。\n “犹太人的女儿！”会督说，“起来跟我们走。”\n “上哪儿，去做什么？”丽贝卡说。\n “小姑娘，”康拉德答道，“你无权提出问题，只能服从。但是不妨让你知道，你是要去接受我们骑士团大宗师的审判，供认你所犯的罪。”\n “荣耀归于亚伯拉罕的上帝！”丽贝卡虔诚地说，合抱着双手，“一个法官，即使他敌视我的民族，对我说来也如同是我的保护人。我非常愿意跟你们去，只是请允许我遮上面纱。”\n 他们迈着缓慢而庄严的步子走下楼梯，穿过了长长的走廊，走廊尽头是一扇折门，过了折门便是大厅，大宗师的临时法庭设立在这里。\n 这间宽敞的屋子下首站满了乡绅和农民，他们只得勉强腾出一条路，让丽贝卡在会督和蒙特菲舍，以及执戟卫兵的弹压下，走往她指定的座位。她走过人群时，合抱着双手，低垂着头，这时一张纸条塞进了她手中，她几乎是无意识地接了纸条，一直握着它，没有想到看它的内容。但是在这个可怕的会场里她有一个朋友的信念，给了她勇气，她抬头向周围瞧了一眼，以便确定她给带到了什么人面前。这样，她看到了这个场面，但是关于它的情形，我们只能在下一章中描写了。\n
