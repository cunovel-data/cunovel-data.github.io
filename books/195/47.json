{"id":6138,"no":47,"title":"Note","content":"NOTE TO CHAPTER I. Note A.---The Ranger or the Forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs. A most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the Forest Laws. These oppressive enactments were the produce of the Norman Conquest, for the Saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane; while those of William, enthusiastically attached to the exercise and its rights, were to the last degree tyrannical. The formation of the New Forest, bears evidence to his passion for hunting, where he reduced many a happy village to the condition of that one commemorated by my friend, Mr William Stewart Rose: \"Amongst the ruins of the church The midnight raven found a perch, A melancholy place; The ruthless Conqueror cast down, Woe worth the deed, that little town, To lengthen out his chase.\" The disabling dogs, which might be necessary for keeping flocks and herds, from running at the deer, was called \"lawing\", and was in general use. The Charter of the Forest designed to lessen those evils, declares that inquisition, or view, for lawing dogs, shall be made every third year, and shall be then done by the view and testimony of lawful men, not otherwise; and they whose dogs shall be then found unlawed, shall give three shillings for mercy, and for the future no man\u0027s ox shall be taken for lawing. Such lawing also shall be done by the assize commonly used, and which is, that three claws shall be cut off without the ball of the right foot. See on this subject the Historical Essay on the Magna Charta of King John, (a most beautiful volume), by Richard Thomson. NOTE TO CHAPTER II. Note B.---Negro Slaves. The severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of the slaves of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as being totally out of costume and propriety. I remember the same objection being made to a set of sable functionaries, whom my friend, Mat Lewis, introduced as the guards and mischief-doing satellites of the wicked Baron, in his Castle Spectre. Mat treated the objection with great contempt, and averred in reply, that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking effect of contrast, and that, could he have derived a similar advantage from making his heroine blue, blue she should have been. I do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this; but neither will I allow that the author of a modern antique romance is obliged to confine himself to the introduction of those manners only which can be proved to have absolutely existed in the times he is depicting, so that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and natural, and contain no obvious anachronism. In this point of view, what can be more natural, than that the Templars, who, we know, copied closely the luxuries of the Asiatic warriors with whom they fought, should use the service of the enslaved Africans, whom the fate of war transferred to new masters? I am sure, if there are no precise proofs of their having done so, there is nothing, on the other hand, that can entitle us positively to conclude that they never did. Besides, there is an instance in romance. John of Rampayne, an excellent juggler and minstrel, undertook to effect the escape of one Audulf de Bracy, by presenting himself in disguise at the court of the king, where he was confined. For this purpose, \"he stained his hair and his whole body entirely as black as jet, so that nothing was white but his teeth,\" and succeeded in imposing himself on the king, as an Ethiopian minstrel. He effected, by stratagem, the escape of the prisoner. Negroes, therefore, must have been known in England in the dark ages.* * Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy, prefixed to * Ritson\u0027s Ancient Metrical Romances, p. clxxxvii. NOTE TO CHAPTER XVII. Note C.---Minstrelsy. The realm of France, it is well known, was divided betwixt the Norman and Teutonic race, who spoke the language in which the word Yes is pronounced as \"oui\", and the inhabitants of the southern regions, whose speech bearing some affinity to the Italian, pronounced the same word \"oc\". The poets of the former race were called \"Minstrels\", and their poems \"Lays\": those of the latter were termed \"Troubadours\", and their compositions called \"sirventes\", and other names. Richard, a professed admirer of the joyous science in all its branches, could imitate either the minstrel or troubadour. It is less likely that he should have been able to compose or sing an English ballad; yet so much do we wish to assimilate Him of the Lion Heart to the band of warriors whom he led, that the anachronism, if there be one may readily be forgiven. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXI. Note D.---Battle of Stamford. A great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions. The bloody battle alluded to in the text, fought and won by King Harold, over his brother the rebellious Tosti, and an auxiliary force of Danes or Norsemen, was said, in the text, and a corresponding note, to have taken place at Stamford, in Leicestershire, and upon the river Welland. This is a mistake, into which the author has been led by trusting to his memory, and so confounding two places of the same name. The Stamford, Strangford, or Staneford, at which the battle really was fought, is a ford upon the river Derwent, at the distance of about seven miles from York, and situated in that large and opulent county. A long wooden bridge over the Derwent, the site of which, with one remaining buttress, is still shown to the curious traveller, was furiously contested. One Norwegian long defended it by his single arm, and was at length pierced with a spear thrust through the planks of the bridge from a boat beneath. The neighbourhood of Stamford, on the Derwent, contains some memorials of the battle. Horseshoes, swords, and the heads of halberds, or bills, are often found there; one place is called the \"Danes\u0027 well,\" another the \"Battle flats.\" From a tradition that the weapon with which the Norwegian champion was slain, resembled a pear, or, as others say, that the trough or boat in which the soldier floated under the bridge to strike the blow, had such a shape, the country people usually begin a great market, which is held at Stamford, with an entertainment called the Pear-pie feast, which after all may be a corruption of the Spear-pie feast. For more particulars, Drake\u0027s History of York may be referred to. The author\u0027s mistake was pointed out to him, in the most obliging manner, by Robert Belt, Esq. of Bossal House. The battle was fought in 1066. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXII. Note E.---The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal. This horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which the Spaniards subjected Guatimozin, in order to extort a discovery of his concealed wealth. But, in fact, an instance of similar barbarity is to be found nearer home, and occurs in the annals of Queen Mary\u0027s time, containing so many other examples of atrocity. Every reader must recollect, that after the fall of the Catholic Church, and the Presbyterian Church Government had been established by law, the rank, and especially the wealth, of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and so forth, were no longer vested in ecclesiastics, but in lay impropriators of the church revenues, or, as the Scottish lawyers called them, titulars of the temporalities of the benefice, though having no claim to the spiritual character of their predecessors in office. Of these laymen, who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues, some were men of high birth and rank, like the famous Lord James Stewart, the Prior of St Andrews, who did not fail to keep for their own use the rents, lands, and revenues of the church. But if, on the other hand, the titulars were men of inferior importance, who had been inducted into the office by the interest of some powerful person, it was generally understood that the new Abbot should grant for his patron\u0027s benefit such leases and conveyances of the church lands and tithes as might afford their protector the lion\u0027s share of the booty. This was the origin of those who were wittily termed Tulchan* * A \"Tulchan\" is a calf\u0027s skin stuffed, and placed before a * cow who has lost its calf, to induce the animal to part * with her milk. The resemblance between such a Tulchan and * a Bishop named to transmit the temporalities of a benefice * to some powerful patron, is easily understood. Bishops, being a sort of imaginary prelate, whose image was set up to enable his patron and principal to plunder the benefice under his name. There were other cases, however, in which men who had got grants of these secularised benefices, were desirous of retaining them for their own use, without having the influence sufficient to establish their purpose; and these became frequently unable to protect themselves, however unwilling to submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of the district. Bannatyne, secretary to John Knox, recounts a singular course of oppression practised on one of those titulars abbots, by the Earl of Cassilis in Ayrshire, whose extent of feudal influence was so wide that he was usually termed the King of Carrick. We give the fact as it occurs in Bannatyne\u0027s Journal, only premising that the Journalist held his master\u0027s opinions, both with respect to the Earl of Cassilis as an opposer of the king\u0027s party, and as being a detester of the practice of granting church revenues to titulars, instead of their being devoted to pious uses, such as the support of the clergy, expense of schools, and the relief of the national poor. He mingles in the narrative, therefore, a well deserved feeling of execration against the tyrant who employed the torture, which a tone of ridicule towards the patient, as if, after all, it had not been ill bestowed on such an equivocal and amphibious character as a titular abbot. He entitles his narrative, THE EARL OF CASSILIS\u0027 TYRANNY AGAINST A QUICK (i.e. LIVING) MAN. \"Master Allan Stewart, friend to Captain James Stewart of Cardonall, by means of the Queen\u0027s corrupted court, obtained the Abbey of Crossraguel. The said Earl thinking himself greater than any king in those quarters, determined to have that whole benefice (as he hath divers others) to pay at his pleasure; and because he could not find sic security as his insatiable appetite required, this shift was devised. The said Mr Allan being in company with the Laird of Bargany, (also a Kennedy,) was, by the Earl and his friends, enticed to leave the safeguard which he had with the Laird, and come to make good cheer with the said Earl. The simplicity of the imprudent man was suddenly abused; and so he passed his time with them certain days, which he did in Maybole with Thomas Kennedie, uncle to the said Earl; after which the said Mr Allan passed, with quiet company, to visit the place and bounds of Crossraguel, (his abbacy,) of which the said Earl being surely advertised, determined to put in practice the tyranny which long before he had conceived. And so, as king of the country, apprehended the said Mr Allan, and carried him to the house of Denure, where for a season he was honourably treated, (if a prisoner can think any entertainment pleasing;) but after that certain days were spent, and that the Earl could not obtain the feus of Crossraguel according to his own appetite, he determined to prove if a collation could work that which neither dinner nor supper could do for a long time. And so the said Mr Allan was carried to a secret chamber: with him passed the honourable Earl, his worshipful brother, and such as were appointed to be servants at that banquet. In the chamber there was a grit iron chimlay, under it a fire; other grit provision was not seen. The first course was,---\u0027My Lord Abbot,\u0027 (said the Earl,) \u0027it will please you confess here, that with your own consent you remain in my company, because ye durst not commit yourself to the hands of others.\u0027 The Abbot answered, \u0027Would you, my lord, that I should make a manifest lie for your pleasure? The truth is, my lord, it is against my will that I am here; neither yet have I any pleasure in your company.\u0027 \u0027But ye shall remain with me, nevertheless, at this time,\u0027 said the Earl. \u0027l am not able to resist your will and pleasure,\u0027 said the Abbot, \u0027in this place.\u0027 \u0027Ye must then obey me,\u0027 said the Earl,---and with that were presented unto him certain letters to subscribe, amongst which there was a five years\u0027 tack, and a nineteen years\u0027 tack, and a charter of feu of all the lands (of Crossraguel, with all the clauses necessary for the Earl to haste him to hell. For if adultery, sacrilege, oppression, barbarous cruelty, and theft heaped upon theft, deserve hell, the great King of Carrick can no more escape hell for ever, than the imprudent Abbot escaped the fire for a season as follows. \"After that the Earl spied repugnance, and saw that he could not come to his purpose by fair means, he commanded his cooks to prepare the banquet: and so first they flayed the sheep, that is, they took off the Abbot\u0027s cloathes even to his skin, and next they bound him to the chimney---his legs to the one end, and his arms to the other; and so they began to beet (i.e. feed) the fire sometimes to his buttocks, sometimes to his legs, sometimes to his shoulders and arms; and that the roast might not burn, but that it might rest in soppe, they spared not flambing with oil, (basting as a cook bastes roasted meat); Lord, look thou to sic cruelty! And that the crying of the miserable man should not be heard, they dosed his mouth that the voice might be stopped. It may be suspected that some partisan of the King\u0027s (Darnley\u0027s) murder was there. In that torment they held the poor man, till that often he cried for God\u0027s sake to dispatch him; for he had as meikle gold in his awin purse as would buy powder enough to shorten his pain. The famous King of Carrick and his cooks perceiving the roast to be aneuch, commanded it to be tane fra the fire, and the Earl himself began the grace in this manner: ---\u0027Benedicite, Jesus Maria, you are the most obstinate man that ever I saw; gif I had known that ye had been so stubborn, I would not for a thousand crowns have handled you so; I never did so to man before you.\u0027 And yet he returned to the same practice within two days, and ceased not till that he obtained his formost purpose, that is, that he had got all his pieces subscryvit alsweill as ane half-roasted hand could do it. The Earl thinking himself sure enough so long as he had the half-roasted Abbot in his own keeping, and yet being ashamed of his presence by reason of his former cruelty, left the place of Denure in the hands of certain of his servants, and the half-roasted Abbot to be kept there as prisoner. The Laird of Bargany, out of whose company the said Abbot had been enticed, understanding, (not the extremity,) but the retaining of the man, sent to the court, and raised letters of deliverance of the person of the man according to the order, which being disobeyed, the said Earl for his contempt was denounced rebel, and put to the horne. But yet hope was there none, neither to the afflicted to be delivered, neither yet to the purchaser (i.e. procurer) of the letters to obtain any comfort thereby; for in that time God was despised, and the lawful authority was contemned in Scotland, in hope of the sudden return and regiment of that cruel murderer of her awin husband, of whose lords the said Earl was called one; and yet, oftener than once, he was solemnly sworn to the King and to his Regent.\" The Journalist then recites the complaint of the injured Allan Stewart, Commendator of Crossraguel, to the Regent and Privy Council, averring his having been carried, partly by flattery, partly by force, to the black vault of Denure, a strong fortalice, built on a rock overhanging the Irish channel, where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole churches and parsonages belonging to the Abbey of Crossraguel, which he utterly refused as an unreasonable demand, and the more so that he had already conveyed them to John Stewart of Cardonah, by whose interest he had been made Commendator. The complainant proceeds to state, that he was, after many menaces, stript, bound, and his limbs exposed to fire in the manner already described, till, compelled by excess of agony, he subscribed the charter and leases presented to him, of the contents of which he was totally ignorant. A few days afterwards, being again required to execute a ratification of these deeds before a notary and witnesses, and refusing to do so, he was once more subjected to the same torture, until his agony was so excessive that he exclaimed, \"Fye on you, why do you not strike your whingers into me, or blow me up with a barrel of powder, rather than torture me thus unmercifully?\" upon which the Earl commanded Alexander Richard, one of his attendants, to stop the patient\u0027s mouth with a napkin, which was done accordingly. Thus he was once more compelled to submit to their tyranny. The petition concluded with stating, that the Earl, under pretence of the deeds thus iniquitously obtained, had taken possession of the whole place and living of Crossraguel, and enjoyed the profits thereof for three years. The doom of the Regent and Council shows singularly the total interruption of justice at this calamitous period, even in the most clamant cases of oppression. The Council declined interference with the course of the ordinary justice of the county, (which was completely under the said Earl of Cassilis\u0027 control,) and only enacted, that he should forbear molestation of the unfortunate Comendator, under the surety of two thousand pounds Scots. The Earl was appointed also to keep the peace towards the celebrated George Buchanan, who had a pension out of the same Abbacy, to a similar extent, and under the like penalty. The consequences are thus described by the Journalist already quoted.--- \"The said Laird of Bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could neither help the oppressed, nor yet the afflicted, applied his mind to the next remedy, and in the end, by his servants, took the house of Denure, where the poor Abbot was kept prisoner. The bruit flew fra Carrick to Galloway, and so suddenly assembled herd and hyre-man that pertained to the band of the Kennedies; and so within a few hours was the house of Denure environed again. The master of Cassilis was the frackast (i.e. the readiest or boldest) and would not stay, but in his heat would lay fire to the dungeon, with no small boasting that all enemies within the house should die. \"He was required and admonished by those that were within to be more moderate, and not to hazard himself so foolishly. But no admonition would help, till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder, and then ceased he from further pursuit in fury. The Laird of Bargany had before purchest (obtained) of the authorities, letters, charging all faithfull subjects to the King\u0027s Majesty, to assist him against that cruel tyrant and mansworn traitor, the Earl of Cassilis; which letters, with his private writings, he published, and shortly found sic concurrence of Kyle and Cunynghame with his other friends, that the Carrick company drew back fra the house: and so the other approached, furnished the house with more men, delivered the said Mr Allan, and carried him to Ayr, where, publicly at the market cross of the said town, he declared how cruelly he was entreated, and how the murdered King suffered not sic torment as he did, excepting only he escaped the death: and, therefore, publickly did revoke all things that were done in that extremity, and especially revoked the subscription of the three writings, to wit, of a fyve yeir tack and nineteen year tack, and of a charter of feu. And so the house remained, and remains (till this day, the 7th of February, 1571,) in the custody of the said Laird of Bargany and of his servants. And so cruelty was disappointed of proffeit present, and shall be eternallie punished, unless he earnestly repent. And this far for the cruelty committed, to give occasion unto others, and to such as hate the monstrous dealing of degenerate nobility, to look more diligently upon their behaviuours, and to paint them forth unto the world, that they themselves may be ashamed of their own beastliness, and that the world may be advertised and admonished to abhor, detest, and avoid the company of all sic tyrants, who are not worthy of the society of men, but ought to be sent suddenly to the devil, with whom they must burn without end, for their contempt of God, and cruelty committed against his creatures. Let Cassilis and his brother be the first to be the example unto others. Amen. Amen.\"* * Bannatyne\u0027s Journal. This extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography, to render it more intelligible to the general reader. I have to add, that the Kennedies of Bargany, who interfered in behalf of the oppressed Abbot, were themselves a younger branch of the Cassilis family, but held different politics, and were powerful enough in this, and other instances, to bid them defiance. The ultimate issue of this affair does not appear; but as the house of Cassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus and leases which belonged to Crossraguel Abbey, it is probable the talons of the King of Carrick were strong enough, in those disorderly times, to retain the prey which they had so mercilessly fixed upon. I may also add, that it appears by some papers in my possession, that the officers or Country Keepers on the border, were accustomed to torment their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their chimneys, to extort confession. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXIX Note F.---Heraldry The author has been here upbraided with false heraldry, as having charged metal upon metal. It should be remembered, however, that heraldry had only its first rude origin during the crusades, and that all the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time, and introduced at a much later period. Those who think otherwise must suppose that the Goddess of \"Armoirers\", like the Goddess of Arms, sprung into the world completely equipped in all the gaudy trappings of the department she presides over. Additional Note In corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which were assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after the conquest of Jerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses or, upon a field azure, displaying thus metal upon metal. The heralds have tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modes---but Ferne gallantly contends, that a prince of Godfrey\u0027s qualities should not be bound by the ordinary rules. The Scottish Nisbet, and the same Ferne, insist that the chiefs of the Crusade must have assigned to Godfrey this extraordinary and unwonted coat-of-arms, in order to induce those who should behold them to make enquiries; and hence give them the name of \"arma inquirenda\". But with reverence to these grave authorities, it seems unlikely that the assembled princes of Europe should have adjudged to Godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general rule, if such rule had then existed; at any rate, it proves that metal upon metal, now accounted a solecism in heraldry, was admitted in other cases similar to that in the text. See Ferne\u0027s \"Blazon of Gentrie\" p. 238. Edition 1586. Nisbet\u0027s \"Heraldry\", vol. i. p. 113. Second Edition. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXI Note G.---Ulrica\u0027s Death song. It will readily occur to the antiquary, that these verses are intended to imitate the antique poetry of the Scalds---the minstrels of the old Scandinavians---the race, as the Laureate so happily terms them, \"Stern to inflict, and stubborn to endure, Who smiled in death.\" The poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, after their civilisation and conversion, was of a different and softer character; but in the circumstances of Ulrica, she may be not unnaturally supposed to return to the wild strains which animated her forefathers during the time of Paganism and untamed ferocity. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXII Note H.---Richard Coeur-de-Lion. The interchange of a cuff with the jolly priest is not entirely out of character with Richard I., if romances read him aright. In the very curious romance on the subject of his adventures in the Holy Land, and his return from thence, it is recorded how he exchanged a pugilistic favour of this nature, while a prisoner in Germany. His opponent was the son of his principal warder, and was so imprudent as to give the challenge to this barter of buffets. The King stood forth like a true man, and received a blow which staggered him. In requital, having previously waxed his hand, a practice unknown, I believe, to the gentlemen of the modern fancy, he returned the box on the ear with such interest as to kill his antagonist on the spot. ---See, in Ellis\u0027s Specimens of English Romance, that of Coeur-de-Lion. NOTE TO CHAPTER XXXIII Note I.---Hedge-Priests. It is curious to observe, that in every state of society, some sort of ghostly consolation is provided for the members of the community, though assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion. A gang of beggars have their Patrico, and the banditti of the Apennines have among them persons acting as monks and priests, by whom they are confessed, and who perform mass before them. Unquestionably, such reverend persons, in such a society, must accommodate their manners and their morals to the community in which they live; and if they can occasionally obtain a degree of reverence for their supposed spiritual gifts, are, on most occasions, loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as possessing a character inconsistent with all around them. Hence the fighting parson in the old play of Sir John Oldcastle, and the famous friar of Robin Hood\u0027s band. Nor were such characters ideal. There exists a monition of the Bishop of Durham against irregular churchmen of this class, who associated themselves with Border robbers, and desecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function, by celebrating them for the benefit of thieves, robbers, and murderers, amongst ruins and in caverns of the earth, without regard to canonical form, and with torn and dirty attire, and maimed rites, altogether improper for the occasion. NOTE TO CHAPTER XLI. Note J.---Castle of Coningsburgh. When I last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days, one of the very few remaining examples of Saxon fortification, I was strongly impressed with the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject, which, from some recent acquaintance with the architecture of the ancient Scandinavians, seemed to me peculiarly interesting. I was, however, obliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey, without leisure to take more than a transient view of Coningsburgh. Yet the idea dwells so strongly in my mind, that I feel considerably tempted to write a page or two in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis, leaving better antiquaries to correct or refute conclusions which are perhaps too hastily drawn. Those who have visited the Zetland Islands, are familiar with the description of castles called by the inhabitants Burghs; and by the Highlanders---for they are also to be found both in the Western Isles and on the mainland---Duns. Pennant has engraved a view of the famous Dun-Dornadilla in Glenelg; and there are many others, all of them built after a peculiar mode of architecture, which argues a people in the most primitive state of society. The most perfect specimen is that upon the island of Mousa, near to the mainland of Zetland, which is probably in the same state as when inhabited. It is a single round tower, the wall curving in slightly, and then turning outward again in the form of a dice-box, so that the defenders on the top might the better protect the base. It is formed of rough stones, selected with care, and laid in courses or circles, with much compactness, but without cement of any kind. The tower has never, to appearance, had roofing of any sort; a fire was made in the centre of the space which it encloses, and originally the building was probably little more than a wall drawn as a sort of screen around the great council fire of the tribe. But, although the means or ingenuity of the builders did not extend so far as to provide a roof, they supplied the want by constructing apartments in the interior of the walls of the tower itself. The circumvallation formed a double enclosure, the inner side of which was, in fact, two feet or three feet distant from the other, and connected by a concentric range of long flat stones, thus forming a series of concentric rings or stories of various heights, rising to the top of the tower. Each of these stories or galleries has four windows, facing directly to the points of the compass, and rising of course regularly above each other. These four perpendicular ranges of windows admitted air, and, the fire being kindled, heat, or smoke at least, to each of the galleries. The access from gallery to gallery is equally primitive. A path, on the principle of an inclined plane, turns round and round the building like a screw, and gives access to the different stories, intersecting each of them in its turn, and thus gradually rising to the top of the wall of the tower. On the outside there are no windows; and I may add, that an enclosure of a square, or sometimes a round form, gave the inhabitants of the Burgh an opportunity to secure any sheep or cattle which they might possess. Such is the general architecture of that very early period when the Northmen swept the seas, and brought to their rude houses, such as I have described them, the plunder of polished nations. In Zetland there are several scores of these Burghs, occupying in every case, capes, headlands, islets, and similar places of advantage singularly well chosen. I remember the remains of one upon an island in a small lake near Lerwick, which at high tide communicates with the sea, the access to which is very ingenious, by means of a causeway or dike, about three or four inches under the surface of the water. This causeway makes a sharp angle in its approach to the Burgh. The inhabitants, doubtless, were well acquainted with this, but strangers, who might approach in a hostile manner, and were ignorant of the curve of the causeway, would probably plunge into the lake, which is six or seven feet in depth at the least. This must have been the device of some Vauban or Cohorn of those early times. The style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed neither the art of using lime or cement of any kind, nor the skill to throw an arch, construct a roof, or erect a stair; and yet, with all this ignorance, showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation of Burghs, and regulating the access to them, as well as neatness and regularity in the erection, since the buildings themselves show a style of advance in the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so many of the principal branches of architectural knowledge. I have always thought, that one of the most curious and valuable objects of antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society, by the efforts made in early ages to improve the rudeness of their first expedients, until they either approach excellence, or, as is more frequently the case, are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries, which supersede both the earlier and ruder system, and the improvements which have been ingrafted upon it. For example, if we conceive the recent discovery of gas to be so much improved and adapted to domestic use, as to supersede all other modes of producing domestic light; we can already suppose, some centuries afterwards, the heads of a whole Society of Antiquaries half turned by the discovery of a pair of patent snuffers, and by the learned theories which would be brought forward to account for the form and purpose of so singular an implement. Following some such principle, I am inclined to regard the singular Castle of Coningsburgh---I mean the Saxon part of it ---as a step in advance from the rude architecture, if it deserves the name, which must have been common to the Saxons as to other Northmen. The builders had attained the art of using cement, and of roofing a building,---great improvements on the original Burgh. But in the round keep, a shape only seen in the most ancient castles---the chambers excavated in the thickness of the walls and buttresses---the difficulty by which access is gained from one story to those above it, Coningsburgh still retains the simplicity of its origin, and shows by what slow degrees man proceeded from occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings, as were afforded by the galleries of the Castle of Mousa, to the more splendid accommodations of the Norman castles, with all their stern and Gothic graces. I am ignorant if these remarks are new, or if they will be confirmed by closer examination; but I think, that, on a hasty observation, Coningsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to trace the history of architecture back to the times preceding the Norman Conquest. It would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the Castle of Mousa, as it cannot be well understood by a plan. The Castle of Coningsburgh is thus described:--- \"The castle is large, the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent from the river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the town stands, situated at the head of a rich and magnificent vale, formed by an amphitheatre of woody hills, in which flows the gentle Don. Near the castle is a barrow, said to be Hengist\u0027s tomb. The entrance is flanked to the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, and there are several similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and on the east side the ditch and bank are double and very steep. On the top of the churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high relief, two ravens, or such-like birds. On the south side of the churchyard lies an ancient stone, ridged like a coffin, on which is carved a man on horseback; and another man with a shield encountering a vast winged serpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was probably one of the rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this county. See it engraved on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate 14. fig. 1. The name of Coningsburgh, by which this castle goes in the old editions of the Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the residence of the Saxon kings. It afterwards belonged to King Harold. The Conqueror bestowed it on William de Warren, with all its privileges and jurisdiction, which are said to have extended over twenty-eight towns. At the corner of the area, which is of an irregular form, stands the great tower, or keep, placed on a small hill of its own dimensions, on which lies six vast projecting buttresses, ascending in a steep direction to prop and support the building, and continued upwards up the side as turrets. The tower within forms a complete circle, twenty-one feet in diameter, the walls fourteen feet thick. The ascent into the tower is by an exceeding deep flight of steep steps, four feet and a half wide, on the south side leading to a low doorway, over which is a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone. Within this door is the staircase which ascends straight through the thickness of the wall, not communicating with the room on the first floor, in whose centre is the opening to the dungeon. Neither of these lower rooms is lighted except from a hole in the floor of the third story; the room in which, as well as in that above it, is finished with compact smooth stonework, both having chimney-pieces, with an arch resting on triple clustered pillars. In the third story, or guard-chamber, is a small recess with a loop-hole, probably a bedchamber, and in that floor above a niche for a saint or holy-water pot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon castle of the first ages of the Heptarchy. Mr. Watson thus describes it. From the first floor to the second story, (third from the ground,) is a way by a stair in the wall five feet wide. The next staircase is approached by a ladder, and ends at the fourth story from the ground. Two yards from the door, at the head of this stair, is an opening nearly east, accessible by treading on the ledge of the wall, which diminishes eight inches each story; and this last opening leads into a room or chapel ten feet by twelve, and fifteen or sixteen high, arched with free-stone, and supported by small circular columns of the same, the capitals and arches Saxon. It has an east window, and on each side in the wall, about four feet from the ground, a stone basin with a hole and iron pipe to convey the water into or through the wall. This chapel is one of the buttresses, but no sign of it without, for even the window, though large within, is only a long narrow loop-hole, scarcely to be seen without. On the left side of this chapel is a small oratory, eight by six in the thickness of the wall, with a niche in the wall, and enlightened by a like loop-hole. The fourth stair from the ground, ten feet west from the chapel door, leads to the top of the tower through the thickness of the wall, which at top is but three yards. Each story is about fifteen feet high, so that the tower will be seventy-five feet from the ground. The inside forms a circle, whose diameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom of the dungeon is piled with stones.\"---Gough\u0027s \"Edition Of Camden\u0027s Britannia\". Second Edition, vol. iii. p. 267. 一　护林官 在那个灾难深重的时代，最触目惊心的是“森林法”。这些暴虐的法令是诺曼征服的产物，因为撒克逊人关于狩猎的立法一向是温和而仁慈的；可是威廉热衷于畋猎和有关特权，他在这方面制订的法规残酷专横到了极点、“新森林”(注)的建立便是他这种狂热情绪的证明，那里许多安居乐业的乡村因此变成了一片荒凉的土地；我的朋友威廉·斯图尔特·罗斯对这情形作过真实的描绘； 在教堂的废墟中间， 成了渡鸦深夜栖息的所在， 到处变得满目荒凉； 为了扩大王家猎园， 无情的征服者不顾一切， 摧毁了整个市镇。 -------- (注)征服者威廉开辟的一个王家猎园，在汉普郡。这个猎园使三十多英里以内的市镇和村庄，以及近四十个教堂，全部夷为平地。 为了保护麋鹿，防止牲口和畜群的侵犯，把牧放家畜的狗割除前爪，可能是必要的，这在当时曾普遍实行，称为使狗“合法化”。后来《森林宪章》为了减轻这种苛政，宣布每三年对狗的合法化进行一次检查，查验工作由司法人员负责，其他人不得参与，检查后应发给证明；未经合法化的狗，其主人应缴纳三先令罚金；此后牛羊等不再进行合法化手续。此类合法化还必须按法定标准进行，即割除三只前爪，但不切除右足的拇趾。 二　黑奴 有些苛刻的批评家，对布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔那些奴隶的肤色提出了异议，认为这完全不符合他们的服饰和身分。我记得，我的朋友马修·刘易斯(注)在他的《鬼堡》中，把阴险的男爵身边的卫士和坏蛋写成了黑皮肤的人，也遭到过同样的指责。马修根本不把这些挑剔放在眼里，理直气壮地答道，他把这些奴隶写成黑皮肤，是为了取得鲜明的对照效果；如果他觉得把女主角写成蓝皮肤，可以获得同样的效果，他也会把她写成蓝皮肤的女人。 -------- (注)马修·刘易斯（1775—1818），英国小说家和剧作家，风格接近哥特式恐怖小说。《鬼堡》是他的一个剧本。 我并不认为，写书的人都可以这么随心所欲，但我也不认为，现代历史小说的作者写到的一切，必须绝对符合他所描写的那个时代中存在过的情形，这样他的描写才是合理的，自然的，才不致违背那个时代的风貌。根据这样的观点，圣殿骑士由于经常与亚洲的武士战斗，因而模仿这些人的奢靡作风，把俘获的非洲人变成自己的奴隶，让他们为自己当差，不是很自然的吗？我认为，即使没有明确的证据，证明他们曾这么做，那么反过来说，也没有证据可以让我们得出相反的结论，说他们从未这么做过。何况在传奇故事中也有过一个先例。 兰帕扬的约翰是一个出色的魔术师和行吟诗人，为了搭救一个名叫奥杜尔夫·德布拉西的人逃出囚禁他的王宫，曾自告奋勇乔装改扮去谒见国王。为此目的，他“把他的头发和整个身子都涂得墨黑，除了牙齿全身没有一处是白的”，终于骗过了国王，相信他是埃塞俄比亚的行吟歌手。他便略施计谋，使被囚禁的人逃出了牢笼。由此可见，在中世纪，英国已经知道有黑人的存在。（见里特森(注)的《古代诗体故事》。） -------- (注)约瑟夫·里特森（1752—1803），英国古诗研究者。 三　斯坦福德战役 本书前几版中出现过一个地理上的重大错误。哈罗德国王打败他的兄弟托斯蒂格及其同盟者丹麦人或挪威人的那场血战，在书中和相应的注中被说成是在林肯郡的斯坦福德，在韦兰德河边进行的。这是作者单凭记忆造成的错误，把同样名称的两个地方混为一谈了。真正发生这场战争的斯坦福德，是在德文特河边一个渡口附近，离约克城大约九英里，位在这个富饶的大郡境内。德文特河上从前有一座很长的木桥，好奇的旅行者仍可看到它残留的一个桥墩，这便是它的位置，桥上当时曾发生过激战。一个挪威兵曾独自在那里守卫了很久，最后才被一个长枪手驾舟从桥下刺穿木板后刺死。 德文特河边的城堡斯坦福德一带，还留有这次战争的一些遗迹。那里时常会发现残留的马蹄铁、剑、战钺的头等等；有个地方名为“丹麦井”，还有个地方名为“战地”。这些情况在德雷克的《约克郡史》中有详细记载。这次战事发生在1066年。 四　酷刑 这种骇人听闻的酷刑，可使读者想起西班牙为了追查考乌特莫克(注1)隐藏的财产，对他所做的一切。但是事实上，类似的暴虐行为也可以在我们这儿找到，玛丽女王(注2)时代的编年史中，便记载了许多这类例子。每个读者想必还记得，在天主教会没落，长老会取得合法的统治地位以后，主教和修道院长等等头衔，尤其是财产，不再授予教士，教会的收益由俗人代管，根据苏格兰的法律，这些人称为教会财产的挂名代理人，并不享有前任的宗教权利。 -------- (注1)考乌特莫克（1495—1552），墨西哥阿兹特克人的末代皇帝。十五世纪西班牙人侵入该地区后，考乌特莫克被俘；为了追查阿兹特克人隐藏财物的地点，西班牙人对他滥施酷刑，最后把他折磨致死。 (注2)十六世纪的苏格兰女王。下面所叙述的事都发生在十六世纪苏格兰宗教改革运动时期。 这些享有教会收益的俗人，有的是出身高贵的大贵族，如担任圣安德鲁斯修道院长的著名的詹姆斯·斯图亚特勋爵，这些人能把教会的租金、土地和收益据为己有。但在另一种情况下，代理人地位较低，他们是在某些有力人物的支持下，担任这类职务的，因此一般说，新的修道院长必须考虑恩主的利益，把教会的土地和什一税出让和租借给自已的保护人，以致大部分收益落入后者之手。这便是他们被戏称为空头主教的来源，因为这些人只是徒有虚名，树立他们的地位只是使他们的庇护人和主人，得以在他们的名义下榨取教产的实际利益。 然而也有另一类情况，有些得到教会财产代管权的俗人，企图为自己保留这些利益，但又没有足够的力量保障他们的意图；结果这些人不论如何不愿向当地的封建霸主屈服，往往无法保护他们自己。 约翰·诺克斯(注1)的秘书班纳坦，详细描述了一个独特的事例，说明艾尔郡的卡酉利斯伯爵如何对一个挂名修道院长施加压力；这位伯爵在当地拥有十分强大的封建势力，以致通常被称为“卡里克国王”(注2)。这里引用班纳坦在《大事记》中的叙述，它题为“卡西利斯伯爵对一个活人实施的暴行”： -------- (注1)约翰·诺克斯（约1513—1572）苏格兰宗教改革家，长者会的创始人。 (注2)艾尔都是苏格兰古代的一个郡，卡里克是其中的一个区。 “阿伦·斯图尔特公子利用玛丽女王朝廷的腐败，取得了克罗斯拉格尔修道院长的职位。上述伯爵认为他在该地区比任何国王都大，决定要把教会的全部收益攫为己有；为了满足他贪得无厌的欲望，他便想出了这么一个办法。当阿伦先生正与巴格尼勋爵在一起时，伯爵和他的朋友们诱使他离开了勋爵的保护，前去与他们一起寻欢作乐。这个单纯而不谨慎的少爷就此落进了陷阱；他先与伯爵的舅父托马斯·肯尼迪在迈博尔玩了几天，然后随他的一些朋友，游览了克罗斯拉格尔一带地方。这些活动伯爵显然都是知道的，他决定就在这时把他早已计划好的暴行付之实施。于是他作为当地的土皇帝，拘留了阿伦先生，把他带往迪努尔的一所房子里，并在一段时间里对他十分优待。但是几天过去了，伯爵并未能按照他自己的要求，获得克罗斯拉格尔的租赁权，于是他决定用另一种款待方式达到他的目的。阿伦先生给带进了一间密室，除了高贵的伯爵，还有一些仆人在那里侍候。屋里有一只很大的铁炉子，炉里生着火，并无其他设备。第一道程序是：‘修道院长阁下，’伯爵说，‘你最好承认，你是自愿来到这里与我作伴的，因为你不能让自己落进别人手里。’修道院长答道：‘那么，伯爵，你是要我公开说谎，取得你的欢心？事实是，阁下，我是被迫来到这儿的，我也根本不想与你待在一起。’伯爵答道：‘但目前你必须与我待在一起。’修道院长答道：‘那是因为我在这里无法违抗你的愿望和要求。’伯爵说道：‘那么你就得照我的话做。’他随即拿出了几份文件要他签字，其中有一张五年期的租赁契约，一张十九年的租赁契约，一张租用克罗斯拉格尔全部上地的凭证，从它们的所有条款看，伯爵是早应该下地狱的；因为如果通奸、读圣、压迫、野蛮的暴行、盗窃等等，应该在地狱中受到惩罚，那么卡里克国王已经可以在地狱中永世不得翻身了。 “那以后，伯爵发现对方不肯就范，他无法用和平的手段达到目的，于是命令那些仆人动手，准备新的‘筵席’：首先，他们剥掉了羊的皮，那就是剥掉了修道院长所有的外衣和内衣，然后把他绑在炉子上——腿在一头，手臂在另一头，接着便开始加大火力，有时烤他的臀部，有时烤他的腿，有时烤他的肩膀和手臂；为了使这种烤炙不致变成燃烧，又不致停顿，他们不断在他身上浇油。这个可怜的人给塞住了嘴巴，因此无法让人听到他的喊叫。也许杀害达恩利(注)的凶手在这里参加指导。那个倒霉的家伙在这种酷刑下，不时大喊看在上帝分上，请他们还是快些杀死他吧，因为他口袋里还有不少金币，足够买炸药来缩短他的痛苦。最后著名的卡里克王觉得已烤得够了，于是命令手下的人把他从火上移开，然后由伯爵亲自开导他：‘圣母保佑吧，你是我见过的最固执的人，要是我早知道你这么难对付，哪怕给我一干金镑，我也不想跟你打交道；这种事以前我还从没遇到过。’然而不到两天，他又故伎重演了，这样，直至达到了预定的目的才罢休，那只烤焦一半的手签署了他提交的所有文件。这以后伯爵离开了迪努尔，把烧成半焦的修道院长交由手下的人看管。巴格尼勋爵得知修道院长被扣留后（他还不知道他受酷刑的事），向朝廷提出了控告，并进行了营救，但是伯爵不予理睬，因而被宣布为叛逆，然而这丝毫也无济于事，因为当时教会既不受尊敬，政府的地位也不稳固。”后来这事如何了结，再也无人提起，可是卡西利斯家始终保持着克罗斯拉格尔的大部分收益。 我还可以附带说一句，根据我所掌握的一些文件，苏格兰边境地区的 -------- (注)玛丽女王的丈夫，夫妇不和，不久达恩利即被暗杀，原因不明。官员对犯人实施酷刑，以至绑在火炉上烧烤的事，已司空见惯。 五　纹章 作者在这一点上受到了指责，认为他的描写违反了纹章学的规则。然而应该知道，在十字军时期，纹章还初具雏形；这门光怪陆离的学问的一切细节，都是随着时间的进展逐步形成的，直到很久以后它们才得以确立。不认识这点，无异是把纹章学想象成与女战神雅典娜一样(注)，是全身披挂好了来到世上的。 -------- (注)据希腊神话，女战神雅典娜是主神宙斯的女儿。一天，宙斯突然感到头疼，命令火神劈开他的脑袋，雅典娜便跳了出来，那时她已全身披戴盔甲，像一个战士一样。 六　乌尔莉加的死前之歌 对于考古学家们说来，很清楚，乌尔莉加的这首死前之歌，是模仿古代斯堪的纳维亚行吟诗人的古朴诗歌的。盎格鲁一撒克逊人在接受文明和皈依基督教后，他们吟唱的诗歌取得了另一种性质，调子也比较柔和了。但乌尔莉加在当时的环境中，采用她的祖先在异教时代所运用的粗野曲调，应该说还是很自然的。 七　狮心王理查 如果在民间传说中，理查的性格没有遭到歪曲，那么他与快活的教士的这场拳击比赛，不是完全不可能的。有一则十分离奇的说唱诗歌，是以理查在圣地的冒险活动，以及他从那里回国的经历为题材的。它便记载了他在德国被囚禁时期，怎样与一个人进行这种拳击比赛的事。他的对手是负责看管他的狱吏的儿子，小伙子不知天高地厚，竟向理查挑战，要与他一比高下。国王像一个真正的人那样应战了，他受到的一拳使他的身子晃动了一下。在还击时，他先把蜡涂了手（我相信，这办法现代的拳击爱好者还不知道），一拳出去这么有力，似乎要把对方当场打死。见埃利斯编的《英国早期传奇诗歌范例》中有关狮心工的部分(注)。 -------- (注)乔治·埃利斯（1753—1815），英国的古诗研究者，司各特的好友。《英国早期诗歌范例》是他的有名著作。 八　草包教士 奇怪的是在任何社会团体中，都能找到为人提供精神安慰的教士，尽管这些团体的目的与宗教风马牛不相关。一群乞丐有他们自己的草包教士，亚平宁山脉中的土匪也有各自的修士和教士，替大家举行忏悔仪式和祈祷活动。毫无疑问，在这样的生活圈子中，这些教士必须改变他们的行为方式和道德准则，适应他们所生活的那个团体的需要。如果说他们有时也能获得一定程度的尊敬，被认为具有神灵性质，那么在大多数场合，他们只能得到无情的嘲笑，因为他们与周围的人具有不同的身分。 古代剧本《约翰·奥尔德卡斯尔爵士》(注)中那个好斗的教士，罗宾汉手下的这个著名修士，都是这类人。这些人物也并非完全出自虚构。有一篇达勒姆主教的告诫文，便是指责这些不合常规的教士的；它说他们与边境地区的盗匪混在一起，污辱了他们所担负的神圣的宗教职责，不顾宗教仪式的庄严性质，穿着破旧和肮脏的衣服，在荒野和山洞中为盗贼、强人和凶杀犯祈祷和唱赞美诗。 -------- (注)英国的一个古剧本，发表于1600年，作者不详，曾被误认为莎士比亚的作品。 九　洛克斯利 从关于罗宾汉的民谣中，我们知道，这个著名的绿林大盗有时乔装改扮，化名为洛克斯利，据说这是他出生的乡村的名字，但它的地理位置并不清楚。里特森认为，它可能在德比郡或肯特，也可能在诺丁汉。 十　科宁斯堡 古代的这一有趣废墟是撒克逊筑城学残留的极少例子之一，我上次看到它时，它给我留下了深刻的印象，使我非常想从最近发现的古代斯堪的纳维亚建筑的角度，对它的建造理论进行一些探索。然而由于当时在旅途中我急于离开那里，没有工夫对它作较深入的观察。但这个想法一直停留在我的心中，我总想至少就我的假设的要点，作些较详细的阐述，以便把我粗略的构想就正于更有研究的考古家，或者接受他们的批评。 访问过设得兰群岛的人，都熟知当地居民和高地人所描述的这类城堡。彭南特(注)曾为著名的多纳迪拉城堡雕刻过一幅风景；还有许多城堡都具有特殊的建筑方式，说明当时的人还生活在原始的状态。最完整的标本应该是设得兰的梅恩兰岛附近穆萨岛上的一所城堡，它也许仍保持着当初有人居住时的状态。 -------- (注)托马斯·彭南特（172—1798），英国博物学家、考古家和旅行家，著有《苏格兰游记》等。 这是一个独立的圆形塔楼，墙壁略呈弧形，然后又向外弯曲，使它的形状有些像骰子匣，守卫在堡顶的人可以较好地保卫底部。它是用经过挑选的粗石块，一圈圈或一层层堆砌而成，非常结实，但还不知道使用水泥之类的胶合材料。从外形看，塔楼上从未建造过屋顶；圈在墙内的广场中心是生篝火的，也许它最早只是在部族的大烽烟周围建造的一种屏障。不过，尽管建造者当时还没有想到要修建屋顶，他们在墙壁内部却开辟了房间。于是这堵围墙就成了夹层墙，内圈离外圈事实上有二、三英尺之远，两者由一排排长石板构成的同心圆圈联结，这样形成了高度不同的一个个同心圆环，直至塔楼顶端。这些楼面或回廊每层都有四个窗户，面对罗盘上的四个方向，它们当然彼此重叠，位在一直线上。这垂直的四行窗户可以流通空气，升火的时候，也可输入热气，至少是烟雾。这各层之间的通道同样是极原始的，它由倾斜的阶梯构成，在各层之间以螺旋形盘旋而上，各层有一出口，逐渐通至塔楼楼顶。城堡的外墙没有任何窗户，围墙内的广场可以是方形，也可以是圆形，居住者在那里饲养牛羊，可保不致丢失。 北欧人早期靠在海上劫掠为生的时候，便住在这样的城堡中，当时他们还不知道使用任何种类的石灰或胶泥，也不懂得如何建造屋顶等等。后来随着各种新的建筑材料的应用和建筑方法的改进，他们的居住条件才逐步改善。我认为，后来的诺曼城堡，便是在这个基础上演变而成。根据这个观点，我把科宁斯堡这个独特的城堡，看作这过程中的一个阶段，它与穆萨岛的那种圆形塔楼，有一定的渊源关系。 关于科宁斯堡，卡姆登(注)在《不列颠志》中是这么描写的： -------- (注)威廉·卡姆登（1551—1623），英国文物研究者，历史学家。《不列颠志》是英国第一部综合性地理志，卡姆登最著名的一部著作，最早出版于1586年，后多次再版，并逐步修正。 “城堡很大，外墙耸立在河边一片风光明媚的斜坡上，但后面市镇所在的高山比它高得多。这是在一个富饶而美丽的峡谷口上，周围是树木葱宠的山丘，形成了一片盆地，唐河在那里缓缓流过。城堡附近有一个古墓，据说为亨吉斯特的陵寝。人口处左侧残留着一个圆塔，塔基呈斜坡形，外墙边还有几个类似的圆塔。入口的大门有石框，东边有双重的沟渠和河堤，非常陡峭。教堂院子围墙顶上有一块墓碑，碑上刻的深浮雕是两只渡鸦之类的鸟。教堂院子南边有一大块古石，像棺木一样突出在地面，石上刻着一个骑马的人；另一个持盾的人正在与一条长翅膀的巨蛇搏斗，它后面还有一个拿盾的人。这可能是该郡墓地上常见的那种粗糙十字架的残余……《不列颠志》的前几版都把这城堡称为科宁斯堡，因而被认为是撒克逊国王们的住地。它后来属于哈罗德国王。征服者威廉把它赐给了诺曼巨子……这块地方的形状是不规则的，在它的一角是一个大塔楼，它位在与它同样面积的小山丘上，城堡墙上有六个突出的大扶壁，它们像峭壁一般支撑和扶持着整个建筑，并一直向上延伸，形成了一些塔楼。主楼里面构成了一个圆形广场，直径为二十一英尺，墙壁厚十四英尺。进入城堡的台阶非常高，又非常陡，宽四英尺半，从南边通向一扇矮门，门上有大石块交叉构成的圆形拱顶。进门便是楼梯，它十分狭窄，从厚实的墙壁中通过，但不能通往二楼，二楼中央有一个洞，与底层的地牢沟通。下面这两层的光线全来自三层地面上的一个洞，那里的屋子与上面几层一样，都是用磨光的硬石板建成，每间都有壁炉，支在石三角架上。第三层或称警卫室，那里有一个小套间，墙上开着狭长的透光孔，这可能是卧室，这层墙上还有一个壁龛，是放圣像或圣水盘的。金氏认为，这便是七国时代初期的撒克逊城堡。对这城堡沃森先生是这么描写的：从二楼到三楼得靠墙内五英尺宽的楼梯上下，这楼梯又通过一个小梯子与上一层楼梯连接，进入第四层。在这层楼梯顶端，离门两码远，靠近东边有一个出口，可以经过墙边的过道到达那里，这些墙壁的厚度每层都缩小八英寸。这最后一个出口通向一间屋子，那是城堡的小礼拜堂，它十二英尺长，十英尺宽，十五、六英尺高，有石造拱顶，由一些小圆石柱支撑，它们都带有撒克逊时代的特征。屋内东边有一扇窗，墙两边离地四英寸处有一个石盆，盆中有一小孔，一根铁管通过墙壁从外面引入清水。这屋子位在扶壁内，但外面没有任何痕迹，因为窗户里边虽较大，外边只是一条狭长的小孔，几乎不易发现。小礼拜堂的左边是一间小祈祷室，它八英尺宽，六英尺深，也位在墙内，墙上有一神龛，靠同样的透光孔照明。第四层楼梯在小礼拜堂门西首十英尺处，它通向塔楼顶层，这里的墙壁仅三码厚。城堡的每层大约十五英尺高，因此整个城堡离地面约七十五英尺。它里面形成了一个圆形场下，直径大约十二英尺。地牢底部的深坑堆满了石块。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2707.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷
