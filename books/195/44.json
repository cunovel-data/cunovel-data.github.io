{"id":6135,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"I found them winding of Marcello\u0027s corpse. And there was such a solemn melody, \u0027Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,--- Such as old grandames, watching by the dead, Are wont to outwear the night with. Old Play\n The mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very peculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in which it was erected. A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be almost precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side of the tower, by which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could a few years since, gain access to a small stair within the thickness of the main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the building,---the two lower being dungeons or vaults, which neither receive air nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with which they seem to have communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper apartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given by stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses.\n By this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard, followed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment which occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred, by the difficulties of the ascent, gained time to muffle his face in his mantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself to his father until the King should give him the signal.\n There were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table, about a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon families in the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least, elderly men; for the younger race, to the great displeasure of the seniors, had, like Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which separated for half a century the Norman victors from the vanquished Saxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their silence and their mournful posture, formed a strong contrast to the levity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their grey locks and long full beards, together with their antique tunics and loose black mantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they were seated, and gave the appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of Woden, recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory.\n Cedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of Richard (only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose gravely, and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, \"Waes hael\", raising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger to the customs of his English subjects, returned the greeting with the appropriate words, \"Drinc hael\", and partook of a cup which was handed to him by the sewer. The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who pledged his father in silence, supplying the usual speech by an inclination of his head, lest his voice should have been recognised.\n When this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and, extending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude chapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external buttresses. As there was no opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole, the place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or torches, which showed, by a red and smoky light, the arched roof and naked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the crucifix of the same material.\n Before this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier kneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers, with the greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a splendid \"soul-scat\" was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund\u0027s by the mother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole brethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to Coningsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard in the performance of divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the others failed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which went on at the castle. In maintaining this pious watch and ward, the good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for an instant, lest Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay his clutches on the departed Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall, which, having been that used at the funeral of Saint Edmund, was liable to be desecrated, if handled by the profane. If, in truth, these attentions could be of any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them at the hands of the brethren of Saint Edmund\u0027s, since, besides a hundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of Athelstane had announced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part of the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetual prayers for his soul, and that of her departed husband. Richard and Wilfred followed the Saxon Cedric into the apartment of death, where, as their guide pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of Athelstane, they followed his example in devoutly crossing themselves, and muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.\n This act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to follow him, gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and, after ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a small oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was about eight feet square, hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the wall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to the west, and widening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun found its way into its dark recess, and showed a female of a dignified mien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic beauty. Her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress, enhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured and flowing tresses, which time had neither thinned nor mingled with silver. Her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent with resignation. On the stone table before her stood a crucifix of ivory, beside which was laid a missal, having its pages richly illuminated, and its boards adorned with clasps of gold, and bosses of the same precious metal.\n \"Noble Edith,\" said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if to give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion, \"these are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And this, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.\"\n \"His bravery has my thanks,\" returned the lady; \"although it be the will of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his courtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to behold the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour of sorrow and lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them, satisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can yet afford.\"\n The guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their hospitable guide.\n Another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size with that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story immediately above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened, proceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music. When they entered, they found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons and maidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Four maidens, Rowena leading the choir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased, of which we have only been able to decipher two or three stanzas:---\n Dust unto dust, To this all must; The tenant hath resign\u0027d The faded form To waste and worm--- Corruption claims her kind.\n Through paths unknown Thy soul hath flown, To seek the realms of woe, Where fiery pain Shall purge the stain Of actions done below.\n In that sad place, By Mary\u0027s grace, Brief may thy dwelling be Till prayers and alms, And holy psalms, Shall set the captive free.\n While this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was engaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste could compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of Athelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from baskets of flowers placed before them, garlands, which they intended for the same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if not marked with deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or a smile called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they were preparing. Neither was this propensity (if we must needs confess the truth) at all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights, which occasioned some looking up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone, too proud to be vain, paid her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful courtesy. Her demeanour was serious, but not dejected; and it may be doubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his fate, did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her kinsman.\n To Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably clear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so much deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper to whisper the explanation---\"She was the affianced bride of the noble Athelstane.\"---It may be doubted whether this communication went a far way to increase Wilfred\u0027s disposition to sympathize with the mourners of Coningsburgh.\n Having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in which the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different forms, Cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them, for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those who were immediately effected by the unhappy event. He assured them of every accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the Black Knight took his hand.\n \"I crave to remind you, noble Thane,\" he said, \"that when we last parted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you, to grant me a boon.\"\n \"It is granted ere named, noble Knight,\" said Cedric; \"yet, at this sad moment------\"\n \"Of that also,\" said the King, \"I have bethought me---but my time is brief---neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on the noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and hasty opinions.\"\n \"Sir Knight of the Fetterlock,\" said Cedric, colouring, and interrupting the King in his turn, \"I trust your boon regards yourself and no other; for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting that a stranger should mingle.\"\n \"Nor do I wish to mingle,\" said the King, mildly, \"unless in so far as you will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but as the Black Knight of the Fetterlock---Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.\"\n \"Richard of Anjou!\" exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost astonishment.\n \"No, noble Cedric---Richard of England!---whose deepest interest ---whose deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other. ---And, how now, worthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?\"\n \"To Norman blood,\" said Cedric, \"it hath never bended.\"\n \"Reserve thine homage then,\" said the Monarch, \"until I shall prove my right to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.\"\n \"Prince,\" answered Cedric, \"I have ever done justice to thy bravery and thy worth---Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy descent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm of Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the heir to the monarchy.\"\n \"I will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,\" said Richard, calmly; \"but I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt find another to be put into the scale against it.\"\n \"And hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?\" said Cedric---\"To upbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has closed o\u0027er the last scion of Saxon royalty?\"---His countenance darkened as he spoke.---\"It was boldly---it was rashly done!\"\n \"Not so, by the holy rood!\" replied the King; \"it was done in the frank confidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a shadow of danger.\"\n \"Thou sayest well, Sir King---for King I own thou art, and wilt be, despite of my feeble opposition.---I dare not take the only mode to prevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my reach!\"\n \"And now to my boon,\" said the King, \"which I ask not with one jot the less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful sovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being held faithless, man-sworn, and \u0027nidering\u0027,*\n * Infamous.\n to forgive and receive to thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In this reconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest---the happiness of my friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.\"\n \"And this is Wilfred!\" said Cedric, pointing to his son.\n \"My father!---my father!\" said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at Cedric\u0027s feet, \"grant me thy forgiveness!\"\n \"Thou hast it, my son,\" said Cedric, raising him up. \"The son of Hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to a Norman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English ancestry---no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my decent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself of English ancestry.---Thou art about to speak,\" he added, sternly, \"and I guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two years\u0027 mourning, as for a betrothed husband---all our Saxon ancestors would disown us were we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should have wedded---him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and ancestry---is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself would burst his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his memory.\"\n It seemed as if Cedric\u0027s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in the garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like something arisen from the dead! *\n * The resuscitation of Athelstane has been much criticised, * as too violent a breach of probability, even for a work of * such fantastic character. It was a \"tour-de-force\", to * which the author was compelled to have recourse, by the * vehement entreaties of his friend and printer, who was * inconsolable on the Saxon being conveyed to the tomb.\n The effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly appalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed on the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth which he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself, repeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred to his memory, while Richard alternately said, \"Benedicite\", and swore, \"Mort de ma vie!\"\n In the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying, \"Secure the treacherous monks!\"---others, \"Down with them into the dungeon!\"---others, \"Pitch them from the highest battlements!\"\n \"In the name of God!\" said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of his departed friend, \"if thou art mortal, speak!---if a departed spirit, say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught that can set thy spirit at repose.---Living or dead, noble Athelstane, speak to Cedric!\"\n \"I will,\" said the spectre, very composedly, \"when I have collected breath, and when you give me time---Alive, saidst thou? ---I am as much alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which seem three ages---Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By Heaven, and all saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong days, and by God\u0027s providence it is that I am now here to tell it.\"\n \"Why, noble Athelstane,\" said the Black Knight, \"I myself saw you struck down by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at Torquilstone, and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the teeth.\"\n \"You thought amiss, Sir Knight,\" said Athelstane, \"and Wamba lied. My teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find---No thanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that the blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good mace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not valued it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have spoilt his retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but unwounded. Others, of both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered above me, so that I never recovered my senses until I found myself in a coffin---(an open one, by good luck)---placed before the altar of the church of Saint Edmund\u0027s. I sneezed repeatedly---groaned---awakened and would have arisen, when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came running at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to find the man alive, whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked for wine ---they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for I slept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I found my arms swathed down---my feet tied so fast that mine ankles ache at the very remembrance---the place was utterly dark---the oubliette, as I suppose, of their accursed convent, and from the close, stifled, damp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture. I had strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my dungeon creaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I was in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of the Father Abbot.---Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which he used to ask me for another slice of the haunch! ---the dog has feasted with me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.\"\n \"Have patience, noble Athelstane,\" said the King, \"take breath ---tell your story at leisure---beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth listening to as a romance.\"\n \"Ay but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!\" said Athelstane.---\"A barley loaf and a pitcher of water ---that THEY gave me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had enriched, when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange for their prayers ---the nest of foul ungrateful vipers---barley bread and ditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them out of their nest, though I be excommunicated!\"\n \"But, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,\" said Cedric, grasping the hand of his friend, \"how didst thou escape this imminent danger---did their hearts relent?\"\n \"Did their hearts relent!\" echoed Athelstane.---\"Do rocks melt with the sun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the Convent, which I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast, when they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the swarm out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms, little judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who were thus famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for food---no wonder---the gouty Sacristan was even too busy with his own provender to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step and a strong flavour of wine and spices about his person. Good cheer had opened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of wine, instead of my former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated; when, to add to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of turnkey fitly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar. The light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to which my chains were fixed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot had supposed. Even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps of that infernal dungeon.\"\n \"Take breath, noble Athelstane,\" said Richard, \"and partake of some refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.\"\n \"Partake!\" quoth Athelstane; \"I have been partaking five times to-day---and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign to the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of wine.\"\n The guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their resuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:---He had indeed now many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith, having given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within the Castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger\u0027s apartment attended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze into the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up an erroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more inaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar without, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact. Athelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his escape:---\n \"Finding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as well as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might; and after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of a jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it so please ye, was holding a devil\u0027s mass with a huge beetle-browed, broad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much more like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the fashion of my grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made me more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both stood aghast; but when I knocked down the Sacristan with my fist, the other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge quarter-staff.\"\n \"This must be our Friar Tuck, for a count\u0027s ransom,\" said Richard, looking at Ivanhoe.\n \"He may be the devil, an he will,\" said Athelstane. \"Fortunately he missed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his heels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by means of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sexton\u0027s belt; and I had thoughts of beating out the knave\u0027s brains with the bunch of keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a brace of hearty kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some baked meat, and a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had been regaling, went to the stable, and found in a private stall mine own best palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father Abbot\u0027s particular use. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could compass---man and mother\u0027s son flying before me wherever I came, taking me for a spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being recognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gained admittance into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be the attendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castle-yard very merry, considering they are assembled to celebrate their lord\u0027s funeral ---I say the sewer thought I was dressed to bear a part in the tregetour\u0027s mummery, and so I got admission, and did but disclose myself to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere I came in quest of you, my noble friend.\"\n \"And you have found me,\" said Cedric, \"ready to resume our brave projects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.\"\n \"Talk not to me of delivering any one,\" said Athelstane; \"it is well I am delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain Abbot. He shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will have him craned up from without.\"\n \"But, my son,\" said Edith, \"consider his sacred office.\"\n \"Consider my three days\u0027 fast,\" replied Athelstane; \"I will have their blood every one of them. Front-de-Boeuf was burnt alive for a less matter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much garlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful slaves, so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave me neither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of Hengist!\"\n \"But the Pope, my noble friend,\"---said Cedric---\n \"But the devil, my noble friend,\"---answered Athelstane; \"they die, and no more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the world would go on without them.\"\n \"For shame, noble Athelstane,\" said Cedric; \"forget such wretches in the career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman prince, Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the Holy Confessor lives to dispute it.\"\n \"How!\" said Athelstane, \"is this the noble King Richard?\"\n \"It is Richard Plantagenet himself,\" said Cedric; \"yet I need not remind thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be injured nor detained prisoner---thou well knowest thy duty to him as his host.\"\n \"Ay, by my faith!\" said Athelstane; \"and my duty as a subject besides, for I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.\"\n \"My son,\" said Edith, \"think on thy royal rights!\"\n \"Think on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!\" said Cedric.\n \"Mother and friend,\" said Athelstane, \"a truce to your upbraidings---bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of ambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into it. One half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that perfidious Abbot Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to be trusted. Since these plots were set in agitation, I have had nothing but hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments and starvation; besides that they can only end in the murder of some thousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I will be king in my own domains, and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the Abbot.\"\n \"And my ward Rowena,\" said Cedric---\"I trust you intend not to desert her?\"\n \"Father Cedric,\" said Athelstane, \"be reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares not for me---she loves the little finger of my kinsman Wilfred\u0027s glove better than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it---Nay, blush not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than a country franklin ---and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for grave-clothes and a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of merriment---Nay, an thou wilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better jest---Give me thy hand, or rather lend it me, for I but ask it in the way of friendship. ---Here, cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce and abjure------Hey! by Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath vanished!---Yet, unless my eyes are still dazzled with the fasting I have undergone, I saw him stand there but even now.\"\n All now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished. It was at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that, after very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and had left the castle.\n \"Fair cousin,\" said Athelstane to Rowena, \"could I think that this sudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the weightiest reason, I would myself resume---\"\n But he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe had disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely embarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the apartment.\n \"Certainly,\" quoth Athelstane, \"women are the least to be trusted of all animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I expected not thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot---These cursed grave-clothes have surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.---To you I turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a liege-subject---\"\n But King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it was learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his presence the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment\u0027s speech with him, had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a steed, compelled the Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which, according to Wamba, rendered the old Jew\u0027s neck not worth a penny\u0027s purchase.\n \"By my halidome!\" said Athelstane, \"it is certain that Zernebock hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my grave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one I speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice! ---But it skills not talking of it. Come, my friends---such of you as are left, follow me to the banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear---it is, I trust, as yet tolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon noble; and should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly off with the supper?\"\n \n 我看到人们绕着马赛洛的遗体行走，\n 这时在悲伤、啼哭的悼念活动中，\n 响起了一片低沉庄严的哀号声——\n 守灵的老婆婆们总是这样\n 用一阵阵哭泣消磨漫漫长夜的。\n 古戏剧\n 科宁斯堡主楼入口处的建筑式样十分特别，带有它修建时期古老简陋的朴素风格。一进堡内便可看到几级台阶，每一级都又高又窄，简直像个陡坡，它通向主楼南边的一扇矮门，冒险的考古家今天仍可以，至少几年以前还可以从这扇小门，登上造在主楼厚厚的墙壁内的小楼梯，进入城堡的第三层——下面两层是地下室或储藏库，它们既不通风，也没光线，全凭三层楼上的一个小方洞，在那里架一把梯子，与上面的屋子互相沟通。主楼上面的部分一共四层，上下的楼梯全是造在墙外扶壁中间的。\n 理查国王带着忠实的艾文荷，通过这困难而复杂的路径，给领上了三层楼，那里整个楼面只是一间圆形大厅。威尔弗莱德利用上楼的艰难过程，撩起披风遮没了自己的脸，这样他可以在国王向他发出暗号以前，不致在父亲面前露出真面目。\n 大厅里有十多个人，坐在一张大栎木桌子周围，这是邻近各郡最体面的撒克逊家族的代表，他们全都老了，或者至少上了年纪；因为较年轻的一代也像艾文荷那样，不顾诺曼胜利者和撒克逊战败者之间长达半个世纪的许多隔阂，互相来往，这引起了老人们的不满。这些年高德助的长者垂头丧气，愁容满面，他们的消沉和伤心表情，与院子中那些逍遥自在、饮酒作乐的人构成了鲜明的对照。他们的一络绺白发和长长的胡须，以及式样古老的长袍和宽松的黑大褂，出现在这间古色古香的大厅里，显得十分协调，仿佛这是古代一群崇奉奥了神的信徒，又重返人间，正在为他们民族光辉的式微表示哀悼。\n 塞德里克也坐在这里，他的地位与这些人相当，而且似乎被公认为他们的领袖。他知道的理查只是英勇的镣铐骑士，因此看见他进屋，便严肃地站起来，用通常的礼节向他表示欢迎，同时把一杯酒举到头顶，说道：“敬请于杯。”国王对英格兰人的礼节并不陌生，用相应的话作了回答：“敬谢款待，”随即把管家递来的一杯酒喝干了。同样的礼节也由艾文荷重演了一遍，只是他与父亲祝酒时没有出声，只用点头代替答话，免得被父亲听出他的声音。\n 在这场会面的礼节结束之后，塞德里克重又起立，向理查伸出了一只手，带他走进一间非常简陋的小礼拜堂；它可以说是从外墙的扶壁中挖出的，没有任何窗户，只有墙上开着一个狭长的洞口，以致室内几乎昏暗无光，得靠两支火把照明，才能在香烟缭绕的红光中，看到拱形屋顶和毫无陈设的墙壁，粗糙的石祭台和同样材料制作的基督受难十字架。\n 祭台前放着灵床，灵床两侧各跪着三个教士，他们手拿念珠喃喃祈祷，露出了虔诚恭敬的外表。原来死者的母亲为这场安魂弥撒，付给了圣埃德蒙修道院一大笔钱，看在钱的份上，除了瘸腿的司事以外，全体修士都来到了科宁斯堡；在阿特尔斯坦的灵床旁边经常保持六个人在那里奉行圣事，其余的人便趁此机会，与城堡内的其他人一起吃喝玩乐。在履行这种守灵活动时，虔诚的修士们特别注意；不让他们的诵经声稍有停顿，否则古老的撒克逊人的亚波伦(注)泽恩博克，便会把死去的阿特尔斯坦抓走。他们还同样注意，不让不洁净的俗人碰到棺罩，它是在圣埃德蒙的丧礼上使用过的，如果给俗人的手玷污，便会失去它的圣洁性。确实，如果这些事对死者有任何用处的话，他是有权要求圣埃德蒙的修士这么做的，因为阿特尔斯坦的母亲除了为灵魂的赎罪付了一百枚金币以外，还答应把死者的大部分田地捐献给修道院，让它为他的灵魂和她故世的丈夫的灵魂常年进行祈祷。\n --------\n (注)《圣经》中提到的无底洞魔王，见《启示录》第9章。\n 理查和威尔弗莱德跟着撒克逊人塞德里克走进灵堂，在他们的向导带着庄严的神色，指给他们看早逝的阿特尔斯坦的灵位后，也照他的样子在身上虔诚地划了十字，并为离去的灵魂的安息，念了一段短短的祷告。\n 完成了这些吊唁的礼节后，塞德里克又示意他们跟着他，毫无声息地轻轻穿过石板地面，登上几级台阶，然后小心翼翼地打开了礼拜堂隔壁一间小祈祷室的门。它大约有八英尺见方，也像礼拜堂一样是从厚实的墙壁上挖出的；狭长的小窗洞开在西面墙上，它的两边向内倾斜，形成了一个喇叭口，夕阳的光线从那里射进阴暗的室内，照见了一位相貌端庄的妇人，她老了，但脸上仍保持着早年雍容华贵的神态。她穿着长长的黑丧服，肩上披着黑纱头巾，在它们的衬托下，她的皮肤更显得白皙，一绺绺淡黄头发也光泽四射，时间没有使它们变得稀少，也没有出现银丝。她满面愁容，似乎已把一切置之度外。她面前的石桌上放着一个象牙的基督受难十字架，旁边是一本弥撒书，书页边上镀了金，显得光辉夺目，封面装着金扣子，还饰有一些镀金浮雕。\n 塞德里克先默默站了一会，仿佛要让理查和威尔弗莱德有时间端详这位主妇，然后说道；“尊贵的伊迪丝，这两位外地的贵客是来向您表示哀悼的。尤其这位勇敢的骑士，他曾为了搭救我们今天悼念的人，奋不顾身地进行战斗。”\n “他的英勇我应该感谢，”夫人答道，“尽管这是上天的意旨，使它没有获得成功。我还感谢他和他的朋友前来吊唁，在艾德林的未亡人和阿特尔斯坦的母亲深感悲痛的时刻，特地来探望她。仁慈的亲戚，我请您代为招待他们，尽我们所有的力量让他们得到最好的款待。”\n 客人们向悲哀的主妇深深鞠躬之后，便随着谦恭有礼的向导一起告退了。\n 另一个螺旋楼梯把他们带进了一间大屋子，它与他们最早进入的大厅同样大小，实际就在后者的上面。早在开门以前，已可听到屋内轻轻的、忧郁的诵经声。进屋后，他们发现这里有二十来个夫人小姐，都来自撒克逊的世家望族。四位小姐组成的合唱队，由罗文娜为首，正在为死者唱安魂曲，我们在这里姑译出其中的两三节；\n 尘土归于尘土，\n 此乃必然之路。\n 灵魂离开躯体，\n 任它废弃泉下，\n 虫蚁咬啮蛀蚀，\n 腐烂本是自然之理。\n 灵魂飘飘忽忽，\n 行经未知之途，\n 暂人炼狱赎罪，\n 经受烈焰煎熬，\n 洗净旧日污垢，\n 尘世罪孽由此解脱。\n 在此悲伤之国，\n 依靠圣母护佑，\n 祈求上天恩德，\n 早日赦免罪愆，\n 灵魂得以超度，\n 告别苦海进入天国。\n 在四位少女用低沉悲哀的调子唱这挽歌时，其余的人分成两组，一组在潜心绣花，给阿特尔斯坦的大幅丝绸枢罩添些花纹；另一组正从一些花篮中挑选花朵，编织花环，这也同样是供丧事用的。小姐们虽不显得非常悲痛、但都保持着端庄稳重的外表；她们不时会发出一些低语声或谈笑声，于是立即遭到较严厉的年长妇女的斥责；有时还可看到一位少女在仔细研究她的丧服的大小式样，以致把丧事的准备工作丢在一边。我们不得不承认，这些倾向在两位陌生骑士面前，也未能完全避免，有的偷偷抬起头来看他们有的在窃窃私语。只有罗文娜由于生性高傲，不屑这么做，仅仅向她的救命恩人行了个优美的屈膝礼，表示问候。她举上严肃、但并不伤心；也许，对艾文荷的怀念和对他前途未卜的命运的担忧，在她的头脑中比她的亲属的去世，占有了更大的比重。\n 然而我们已经看到，在这类事情上，塞德里克的头脑是不太清醒的，在他看来，他的义女的悲痛大大超过了其他少女，因此他认为他理应向客人轻轻作些解释：“她是高贵的阿特尔斯坦的未婚妻。”但这说明是否能在威尔弗莱德的心中，提高他对科宁斯堡这些死者家属的同情，那就不得而知了。\n 这样按照礼节，把客人带往各个房间，观看了用不同方式为阿特尔斯坦举行的悼念活动之后，塞德里克又领着他们走进了一个小房间，据他介绍，这是专门为贵宾准备的休息室，这些人由于与死者非亲非故，可能不愿与那些跟丧事直接有关的人待在一起。他说明，他们在这里会得到尽善尽美的招待，然后便想告退，可是黑甲骑士拉住了他的手。\n “高贵的乡绅，”他说道，“我们上次分手时，由于我对您的绵力协助，蒙您允诺，只要我有什么请求，您一定会答应。”\n “是的，我一定会答应，高贵的骑士，”塞德里克答道，“只是在目前这个悲痛的时刻……”\n “这点我也想到了，”国王说，“但我的时间有限，而且我觉得，在我们给高贵的阿特尔斯坦下葬的时候，把我们的一些偏见和轻率的考虑一起埋葬，这也是合理的。”\n “镣铐骑士阁下，”塞德里克涨红了脸，打断了国王的话，说道，“我希望您的要求除了您本人，不涉及别人，因为如果事情涉及我家族的荣誉，那么一个外人的介入，便不合适了。”\n “我本来也不想介入，”国王心平气和地说，“只是请您原谅，这事与我也有一定关系。您一直只知道我是镣铐黑甲骑士，现在我只得告诉您，我便是金雀花王朝的理查。”\n “安茹家的理查！”塞德里克惊叫起来，这出乎意外的发现使他倒退了一步。\n “不对，尊贵的塞德里克，是英国的理查！我最关心的——我最大的愿望，便是看到英国的儿子都能和衷共济，团结一致。现在，高贵的乡绅，你还不愿向你的国王下跪吗？”\n “对诺曼人的国王，我的膝盖还从来没有弯过，”塞德里克答道。\n “那就保留你的跪拜礼吧，”国王说。“我会证明我对诺曼人和英国人一视同仁，因而是有权得到你的这种礼敬的。”\n “王爷，”塞德里克答道，“我对你的勇敢和高尚，一向是敬重的。我也不是不知道，你是有权继承王位的，因为你是玛蒂尔达的后裔，而玛蒂尔达是埃德加·艾塞林的侄女，苏格兰国王马尔科姆的女儿。(注)但是尽管她具有撒克逊王族的血统，她毕竟还不是王室的继承人。”\n --------\n (注)玛蒂尔达是苏格兰国王马尔科姆三世的女儿，而马尔科姆的王后是盎格鲁一撒克逊亲王爱德华·艾塞林的女儿玛格丽特。这里提到的埃德加·艾塞林则是玛格丽特的亲兄弟，他也是撒克逊亲王，曾抵抗征眼者威廉，并一度被拥戴为英国国王，因此他与玛格丽特都属于撒克逊王族。玛蒂尔达后来嫁给了英国诺曼王朝国王亨利一世为王后（参见前第二十三章注），他们的女儿也名玛蒂尔达，曾嫁给安茹伯爵，诺曼王朝绝嗣后，便由安茹伯爵之子亨利继位，称亨利二世，英国的金雀花王朝便由此开始。狮心王理查则是亨利二世之子，因此从母亲来看，他也是有撒克逊王族血统的。\n “我不想与你辩论我的继承权，高贵的乡绅，”理查平静地说，“但是我请你看看你周围的人，你恐怕找不到一个足以在身分上与我对抗的人。”\n “那么，王爷，你到这儿来就是要告诉我这点吗？”塞德里克说，“你是要在撒克逊王族最后一个苗裔进入坟墓之际，向我指出我的民族的衰落吗？”他说话时，脸色变得阴沉了。“这未免太放肆——太莽撞了吧！”\n “凭神圣的十字架起誓，不是这样！”国王答道。“这只是出于我对你的信任，我相信一个勇敢的人对另一个勇敢的人可以无话不谈，不必有所顾忌。”\n “你讲得很好，国王阁下——因为我承认，你现在是，将来也会是国王，我的反对软弱无力，不起任何作用。虽然你把改变这局面的唯一办法送到了我面前，它对我产生了强烈的诱惑，但我不敢这么做！”\n “现在还是谈谈我的要求吧，”国王说。 “尽管你拒绝承认我合法的君主地位，我相信你仍会履行你的诺言。我希望你言而有信，不致被人认为是一个出尔反尔、发伪誓、讲假话的小人；我的要求很简单：宽恕这个卓越的骑士艾文荷的威尔弗莱德，恢复你们父子的感情。你应该承认，这和解是与我有利害关系的，它能给我的朋友带来幸福，也能消除忠于我的人民之间的分歧。”\n “他便是威尔弗莱德？”塞德里克指着他的儿子，问道。\n “我的父亲！我的父亲！”艾文荷喊道，匍伏在塞德里克的脚边，“宽恕我吧！”\n “我宽恕你，我的儿子，”塞德里克说，扶起了他。“赫里沃德的子孙是知道怎么履行诺言的，哪怕这是向一个诺曼人讲的。不过我希望你在我面前得照你英国祖先的样子，穿上英国的服饰；在我的家庭里不应该看到短袍子，花哨的无边圆帽和鲜艳的翎饰。作为塞德里克的儿子，他必须表明他是英国人的后裔。你想讲话，”他又严厉地说，“我猜到你要讲什么。罗文娜小姐必须为她的未婚夫完成两年的服丧期；她本来是应该嫁给他的，他的出身和家世也当之无愧，如果我们在他尸骨未寒的时候，便允许她与别人结合，那么我们所有的撒克逊祖先，都不会承认我们是他们的子孙。阿特尔斯坦的英灵也会从沾血的裹尸布中跳出来，站在我们面前，禁止我们在他身后给他带来这种耻辱。”\n 塞德里克的这番话仿佛在召唤鬼魂，因为他话音未落，门便墓地开了，阿特尔斯坦穿着下葬的衣服，来到了他们面前；他脸色苍白、憔悴，仿佛刚从坟墓里爬起来。(注)\n --------\n (注)阿特尔斯坦的复活，遭到了许多批评，因为它太不合情理，哪怕对这种纯属虚构的小说而言，也太荒唐了。这只是作者出于无奈，不得已而用之的一种手法，因为他的朋友和出版商对这位撤克逊人被送进坟墓很不甘心，再三要求作者这么做。——原注\n 幽灵的出现，使在场的人都大惊失色。塞德里克吓得一直退到了墙边，靠在那里，仿佛已无法站稳；他一眼不眨地注视着朋友的形象，张开了嘴巴，好像再也合不拢了。艾文荷在身上划十字，用撒克逊语、拉丁文或诺曼法语反复念他想得起来的祷告。理查则一会儿叫唤：“上帝保佑！”一会儿喊道：“吓死人了！”\n 这时楼下吵吵闹闹，响成一片，有的人在喊：“抓住这些没良心的修士！”有的人在喊：“把他们关进地牢！”还有的人在喊：“把他们从城墙上丢下去！”\n “看在上帝分上，”塞德里克对着好像是他死去的朋友的幽灵说道，“如果你是人，请你讲明白！如果是死去的灵魂，那就告诉我们，你来找我们有什么事，或者我能为你做什么，让你的灵魂得到安息。高贵的阿特尔斯坦，不论你是死是活，有话就对塞德里克说吧！”\n “不要急，”幽灵安详自若地说，“先让我休息一下，喘一口气。你问我是不是还活着？我是活着，只是三天来这个人是靠面包和水活着，这是漫长的三天，仿佛三个世纪一样。是的，面包和水，塞德里克伯父！老天爷和所有的圣徒都可作证，在漫长的三天中还没有更好的食物进入我的食道，这是天意，是靠上帝的保佑，我现在才能在这里把一切告诉你。”\n “奇怪，高贵的阿特尔斯坦，”黑甲骑士说道，“在托奎尔斯通的风暴结束时，我亲眼看见你给凶恶的圣殿骑士砍下了马背；我以为——汪八也这么讲——你的头颅直到牙齿都给劈开了呢。”\n “你搞错了，骑士阁下，汪八也是胡诌，”阿特尔斯坦答道。“我的牙齿现在还好好的，待会儿我还得用它吃晚饭呢。不过这还是圣殿骑士帮了我的忙，他的剑正要往下劈，给我的狼牙棒一挡，剑身歪了，结果打在我身上的不是刀口，是刀背；要是我戴着钢盔，这一击我根本不在乎，我会趁机口敬他一下，让他再也逃不了。可是事与愿违，我给打晕了，掉到了地上，但并没受伤。这时双方仍在厮打，杀死的人压在我的身上，以致我失去了知觉，等醒来时才发现我躺在一口棺材里，幸好棺材的盖还开着！那是在圣埃德蒙教堂的祭台前面。我打了几个喷嚏，哼哼哧哧地醒了，爬出了棺材，执事和长老听到吵闹，吓得什么似的，跑了过来，当然大吃一惊，可是一点也不高兴，发现他们本来可以继承我的家产，现在这个人却又活了。我要酒喝，他们给了我一点，可是酒里一定加了不少迷魂药，因为我睡得比以前更熟了，过了好几个钟头才苏醒。我发现我的手臂给绑住了，脚也缚得那么紧，到现在想起来，脚踝骨还有些疼呢。我的周围一片漆黑，我想这一定是该死的修道院地下室，它密不透风，又潮湿又沉闷，有一股霉味，可见它也是用作地下墓穴的。我心里正在纳闷，不知出了什么事，地窖的门吱吱开了，两个混蛋修士走了进来。他们竭力让我相信，我是在炼狱里，可是我听得出，这明明是那个胖得气喘吁吁的长老的声音。我的圣杰里米啊！这与他求我多给他一块火腿的声音多么不同！这混蛋从圣诞节起，在我这里大吃大喝了十二天呢！”\n “别发火，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦，”国王说，“歇一口气，慢慢讲你的故事；这真是千古奇闻，像一篇小说。”\n “凭神圣的十字架起誓，这可不是小说，是严酷的事实！”阿特尔斯坦说。“他们只给了我一块大麦面包和一罐水，这些昧良心的小气鬼，他们是靠我父亲和我发财的呢；要知道，从穷苦的奴隶和农夫那里，他们至多凭他们的祷告，骗到几块肉和几斤麦子。修道院成了这伙肮脏龌龊、忘恩负义的毒蛇的安乐案，对我这么一位大施主只给些大麦面包和脏水！哪怕我给开除出教，我也非把他们撵出这个安乐窠不可！”\n “但是，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦，”塞德里克说，拉住了他朋友的手，“凭圣母的名义，请你告诉我们，你是怎么从这危急的处境中脱身的？难道他们不觉得良心不安吗？”\n “良心不安！”阿特尔斯坦答道，“石头会在太阳下熔化吗？要不是修道院里的人都跑光了，我还会关在那里——后来我才知道，他们是到这里来吃我的丧宴的，这些混蛋明明知道我给活埋在那里，居然还成群结队到这儿来喝酒作乐。他们把我的身体关在那里挨饿，却在这里呢呢喃喃念赞美诗，说要超度我的灵魂，岂不荒唐。他们走后，我等了好久，还不见送食物给我，原来那个患痛风症的执事正忙于自己吃喝，哪里想得到我。最后他到地窖来了，脚步歪歪斜斜的，满嘴的酒气和香料味。他喝饱了酒，心里高兴，这才给我留下了一块馅饼和一瓶酒，不再是以前那种食物。我吃了馅饼，喝了酒，全身才有了力气；更幸运的是，执事已喝得昏昏沉沉，没法履行他牢头禁子的职责，锁门时没把锁套进铁环，以致门只是虚掩着。亮光、食物和酒，使我的头脑灵活了。我身上的锁链是套在一只铁环中的，它早已锈得快断了；这是我和那个混蛋长老都没料到的。其实在那样潮湿的地牢里，哪怕铁器也是经不起多少日子的腐蚀的。”\n “休息一下，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦，”理查说，“还是先吃些东西，再往下讲这种可怕的故事吧。”\n “吃东西！”阿特尔斯坦道，“我今天已吃过五顿了。不过再吃一块香香的火腿也未始不可，先生们，请跟我一起喝一杯吧。”\n 两个客人尽管还有些惊魂不定，仍与复活的主人干了杯，让他把故事讲下去。这时听他讲的，已不仅是原来那几个人，因为伊迪丝对城堡内的事务作了些必要的安排后，也跟着复活的死人来到了贵宾接待室，后面还跟着许多客人，有男的也有女的，把小房间挤得水泄不通，其余的人只得凑集在楼梯上，听到几句模糊不清的话，然后以讹传讹，传给下面的人，下面的人又传给外面的下等人，结果变得面目全非，与原来的故事大相径庭了。不过根据阿特尔斯坦的自述，他脱险的经过是这样的：\n “我终于挣脱了那个铁环，像一个拖着脚镣的人，用尽我几天来饿坏的身子所有的力气，爬上了楼梯，摸索了好久，最后朝着传来欢乐的歌声的地方走去，来到了一间屋子，只见那位可敬的执事——对不起，恕我直说——正跟一个浓眉大眼、虎背熊腰的灰衣修士饮酒作乐呢。那个修士简直跟个土匪似的。我一下子冲进屋子，身上还穿着尸衣，挂着铁链，样子完全像地狱中来的不速之客，以致把两人吓了一跳，我马上挥起拳头，把执事打昏在地上，但他那位酒肉朋友，却举起粗大的铁头木棍，向我挥来。”\n “我敢打赌，这一定是我们的塔克修士，”理查说，看了一眼艾文荷。\n “他是魔鬼也罢，随他去，”阿特尔斯坦说。“幸好他没打中我，我正要过去与他厮杀，他便拔脚跑了。我也赶紧从执事的腰带上解下钥匙，开了铁链上的锁，好让自己快些逃走；我本该用那串钥匙打破这混蛋的脑瓜，但想起他给我送来的馅饼和酒，心中便有些不忍，只是把这无赖狠狠踢了两脚，让他躺在那里，不再管他。我往袋里装了几块烤肉，还有那两位先生吃剩的一皮囊酒，走进马厩，发现我那匹出色的小马单独缚在一根栏杆上，毫无疑问，这是专门留给长老的。于是我骑上马，飞一般地赶回这里，一路上所有的人看到我，都以为我是鬼，尤其我为了不让人认出我，用尸衣上的兜帽遮着脸。我还差点进不了自己的城堡，幸好我给当成了魔术师的助手，他正在院子里跟大伙儿逗乐呢；这些人以为这么玩乐就是在为主人操办丧事。管家看到我这身装束，把我当作了预备在哑剧中扮演的角色，也放我进来了。我只向我母亲公开了自己，吃了些东西，便来找你了，我尊贵的朋友。”\n “你来得正好，”塞德里克说，“我预备继续执行我们的英勇计划，为我们的荣誉和自由而斗争。我告诉你，要拯救高贵的撒克逊民族，明天便是大吉大利的起事日子。”\n “不要跟我讲什么拯救不拯救啦，”阿特尔斯坦说道，“我拯救了自己，这就够了。现在我只想惩办那个混蛋的长老。应该让他穿着他的全套法衣，吊在科宁斯堡城楼顶上示众。如果楼梯太窄，他的尸体太胖，抬不上去，我可以从外面把它吊上去。”\n “但是，我的孩子，”伊迪丝说道，“他有圣职在身呢。”\n “他们让我饿了三天，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“我得要他们用血来抵罪。牛面将军活活烧死了，他的罪还没这么大，因为他给他的俘虏供应了丰盛的伙食，只是最后一道浓汤放的大蒜太多了。可是这些虚情假意、忘恩负义的奴才，平时总是在我的酒席上吃白食，花言巧语奉承我，现在却连加大蒜的浓汤也不给我吃。凭亨吉斯特的英灵起誓，这些家伙非死不可！”\n “不过，高贵的朋友，教皇……”塞德里克说。\n “我不怕，高贵的朋友，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“他们非死不可，绝不宽恕。哪怕他们是世界上最好的修士，没有他们，大家照样过活。”\n “真不害羞，高贵的阿特尔斯坦，”塞德里克说道，“忘记这些小人物吧，光辉的道路展开在你的面前。告诉这位诺曼王子，安茹的理查，尽管他像狮子一样勇猛，他也不能否认，在神圣的忏悔者还有一位男性后裔活在世上的时候，阿尔弗烈德大王的王位是否应该属于他，还不一定呢。”\n “什么！”阿特尔斯坦说，“这便是尊贵的理查工吗？”\n “不错，他便是金雀花王朝的理查，”塞德里克说，“不过他是自愿前来作客的，用不到我提醒你，我们是不能伤害他，也不能扣留他的；你很清楚，你作为这儿的主人对他应尽的责任。”\n “这当然！”阿特尔斯坦说，“而且我还应该尽臣子的责任，因为在这里，我也应该全心全意向他效忠。”\n “我的孩子，”伊迪丝说，“别忘记你的王位继承权！”\n “别忘记英国的自由，自甘堕落的王子！”塞德里克说。\n “我的母亲和朋友，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“把你们的责备收起来吧！面包和水，还有地牢，是遏制野心的特效药，我走出坟墓后，比走进坟墓前头脑清醒多了。那些糊涂的虚荣观念，一半是奸佞狡猾的沃尔弗勒姆长老灌输给我的，现在你们也看到，他是不是一个可以信赖的谋士了。这些计划把人弄得心神不定，我整天东奔西走，结果是消化不良，挨打受伤，蹲监牢，饿肚子；不仅如此，它们最后只能使成千上万安分守己的老百姓死在战乱中。我告诉你们，我只想在自己的领地上当国王，别的地方哪儿也不去；我的统治的第一个命令便是吊死那个长老。”\n “那么我的义女罗文娜，”塞德里克说道，“我想你不致要抛弃她吧？”\n “塞德里克伯父，”阿特尔斯坦答道，“头脑清醒一些吧。罗文娜小姐并不爱我，我的亲戚威尔弗莱德的一只小指头，在她眼里比我整个人还重要。她就在那儿，可以证明这点。不，不要脸红，我的女亲戚；爱一个风度翩翩的骑士，不爱一个乡下庄主，这没有什么害羞的；也不要笑我，罗文娜，上帝知道，我这身尸衣和面黄肌瘦的样子，不是一件有趣的事。好吧，如果你一定要笑，我可以给你找一件更有趣的事。把你的手给我，不，暂时借给我，因为我只是为了友谊借用一下。我的兄弟艾文荷的威尔弗莱德，请你允许我放弃和取消……嗨！我的圣邓斯坦，我们的亲戚威尔弗莱德怎么不见了！除非我饿了几天，眼睛发花了，我明明看见他刚才还在这儿呢。”\n 大家东张西望，都在找艾文荷，但是他不见了。最后才发现，原来他是给一个犹太人叫走了；两人简单谈了几句，他便把葛四叫来，穿上盔甲，离开了城堡。\n “美丽的表妹，”阿特尔斯坦对罗文娜说，“艾文荷的突然离开，一定发生了什么急事，否则我倒真有些后悔了……”\n 但是他在发现艾文荷不知去向后，便放开了罗文娜的手；罗文娜觉得自己的处境十分尴尬，因此一有机会便溜之大吉，从屋中消失了。\n “毫无疑问，”阿特尔斯坦又道，“除了修士与长老以外，女人是所有动物中最不可信任的。我本来还指望得到她的感谢，说不定她还会吻我一下，现在只得算了。我这身尸衣一定有魔法附在上面，以致每个人见了我都要逃走。我还是向您，尊贵的理查工，表示我的忠诚吧，我作为您的臣民……”\n 但是理查工也不见了，谁也不知道他去了哪儿。最后大家才获悉，他匆匆赶到院子里，召见了跟艾文荷谈过话的犹太人，与他谈了几句，立刻大喊备马，自己跳上了他的坐骑，还强迫犹太人骑了另一匹马，便一起飞也似的走了，据汪八说，他们骑得那么快，犹太老头儿难保不会摔断脖子。\n “我的老天爷！”阿特尔斯坦说道，“在我离开的时候，泽恩博克一定控制了我的城堡。我回来时穿着尸衣，这说明我是从坟墓中回来的，因此我跟任何人说话，他一听到我的声音便逃走了！算了，还是别谈这些。现在，我的朋友们，既然你们还留在这儿，就跟我上宴会大厅吧，免得又有什么人要逃走。我相信，那儿的筵席一定还可以，配得上一个历史悠久的撒克逊贵族的丧事；要是我们再耽搁一会，说不定魔鬼会把我们的晚饭也卷走呢。”\n
