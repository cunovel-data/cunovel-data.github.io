{"id":6127,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 34","content":"KING JOHN.---I\u0027ll tell thee what, my friend, He is a very serpent in my way; And wheresoe\u0027er this foot of mine doth tread, He lies before me.---Dost thou understand me? King John There was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John had invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother\u0027s throne. Waldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in making an open declaration of their purpose. But their enterprise was delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy. The stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of Front-de-Boeuf; the buoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy; the sagacity, martial experience, and renowned valour of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, were important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither John nor his adviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to have vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the subsidy for which Prince John had contracted with that Israelite and his brethren. This deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency so critical. It was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused report began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and Bois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-Boeuf, had been taken or slain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance, for the purpose of committing an assault on the Saxon Cedric and his attendants. At another time the Prince would have treated this deed of violence as a good jest; but now, that it interfered with and impeded his own plans, he exclaimed against the perpetrators, and spoke of the broken laws, and the infringement of public order and of private property, in a tone which might have become King Alfred. \"The unprincipled marauders,\" he said---\"were I ever to become monarch of England, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their own castles.\" \"But to become monarch of England,\" said his Ahithophel coolly, \"it is necessary not only that your Grace should endure the transgressions of these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your protection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in the habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl Saxons should have realized your Grace\u0027s vision, of converting feudal drawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to whom such an imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it will be dangerous to stir without Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar; and yet we have gone too far to recede with safety.\" Prince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to stride up and down the apartment. \"The villains,\" he said, \"the base treacherous villains, to desert me at this pinch!\" \"Nay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,\" said Waldemar, \"who must be toying with follies when such business was in hand.\" \"What is to be done?\" said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar. \"I know nothing which can be done,\" answered his counsellor, \"save that which I have already taken order for.---I came not to bewail this evil chance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.\" \"Thou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,\" said the Prince; \"and when I have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John will be renowned in our annals.---What hast thou commanded?\" \"I have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy\u0027s lieutenant, to cause his trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently forth towards the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, to do what yet may be done for the succour of our friends.\" Prince John\u0027s face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has undergone what it conceives to be an insult. \"By the face of God!\" he said, \"Waldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in a town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.\" \"I crave your Grace\u0027s pardon,\" said Fitzurse, internally cursing the idle vanity of his patron; \"but when time pressed, and even the loss of minutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon me, in a matter of such importance to your Grace\u0027s interest.\" \"Thou art pardoned, Fitzurse,\" said the prince, gravely; \"thy purpose hath atoned for thy hasty rashness.---But whom have we here?---De Bracy himself, by the rood!---and in strange guise doth he come before us.\" It was indeed De Bracy---\"bloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.\" His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken, defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay and dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it on the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told his news. \"De Bracy,\" said Prince John, \"what means this?---Speak, I charge thee!---Are the Saxons in rebellion?\" \"Speak, De Bracy,\" said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his master, \"thou wert wont to be a man---Where is the Templar? ---where Front-de-Boeuf?\" \"The Templar is fled,\" said De Bracy; \"Front-de-Boeuf you will never see more. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own castle and I alone am escaped to tell you.\" \"Cold news,\" said Waldemar, \"to us, though you speak of fire and conflagration.\" \"The worst news is not yet said,\" answered De Bracy; and, coming up to Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone ---\"Richard is in England---I have seen and spoken with him.\" Prince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himself---much like to a man who receives an arrow in his bosom. \"Thou ravest, De Bracy,\" said Fitzurse, \"it cannot be.\" \"It is as true as truth itself,\" said De Bracy; \"I was his prisoner, and spoke with him.\" \"With Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?\" continued Fitzurse. \"With Richard Plantagenet,\" replied De Bracy, \"with Richard Coeur-de-Lion---with Richard of England.\" \"And thou wert his prisoner?\" said Waldemar; \"he is then at the head of a power?\" \"No---only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his person is unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He joined them only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.\" \"Ay,\" said Fitzurse, \"such is indeed the fashion of Richard ---a true knight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting the prowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while the weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is endangered.---What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?\" \"I?---I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused them---I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God sends us?\" \"I am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,\" answered Waldemar. \"Give her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank, with the help of lance and stirrup,\" said De Bracy. \"Not so,\" answered Fitzurse; \"I will take sanctuary in this church of Saint Peter---the Archbishop is my sworn brother.\" During this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the stupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence, and had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his followers. \"They fall off from me,\" he said to himself, \"they hold no more by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on it! --- Hell and fiends! can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted by these cravens?\"---He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical passion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on their conversation. \"Ha, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady\u0027s brow, I held ye sage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour, pleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might be won by one bold cast!\" \"I understand you not,\" said De Bracy. \"As soon as Richard\u0027s return is blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over with us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France or take the protection of the Queen Mother.\" \"I seek no safety for myself,\" said Prince John, haughtily; \"that I could secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De Bracy, and you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not greatly delight to see your heads blackening on Clifford\u0027s gate yonder. Thinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee to be taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make his peace with King Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert Estoteville lies betwixt thee and Hull with all his forces, and that the Earl of Essex is gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear these levies even before Richard\u0027s return, trowest thou there is any doubt now which party their leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has strength enough to drive all thy Free Lances into the Humber.\"---Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy looked in each other\u0027s faces with blank dismay.---\"There is but one road to safety,\" continued the Prince, and his brow grew black as midnight; \"this object of our terror journeys alone---He must be met withal.\" \"Not by me,\" said De Bracy, hastily; \"I was his prisoner, and he took me to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.\" \"Who spoke of harming him?\" said Prince John, with a hardened laugh; \"the knave will say next that I meant he should slay him! ---No---a prison were better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?---Things will be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise---It was founded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany---Our uncle Robert lived and died in the castle of Cardiffe.\" \"Ay, but,\" said Waldemar, \"your sire Henry sate more firm in his seat than your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by the sexton---no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.\" \"Prison or tomb,\" said De Bracy, \"I wash my hands of the whole matter.\" \"Villain!\" said Prince John, \"thou wouldst not bewray our counsel?\" \"Counsel was never bewrayed by me,\" said De Bracy, haughtily, \"nor must the name of villain be coupled with mine!\" \"Peace, Sir Knight!\" said Waldemar; \"and you, good my lord, forgive the scruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove them.\" \"That passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,\" replied the Knight. \"Why, good Sir Maurice,\" rejoined the wily politician, \"start not aside like a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of your terror.---This Richard---but a day since, and it would have been thy dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle---a hundred times I have heard thee wish it.\" \"Ay,\" said De Bracy, \"but that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and in the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of assaulting him alone, and in a forest.\" \"Thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,\" said Waldemar. \"Was it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won renown? or was it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and unknown forests?\" \"Ay, but I promise you,\" said De Bracy, \"that neither Tristram nor Lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard Plantagenet, and I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.\" \"Thou art mad, De Bracy---what is it we propose to thee, a hired and retained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for Prince John\u0027s service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou scruplest, though thy patron\u0027s fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine own, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!\" \"I tell you,\" said De Bracy, sullenly, \"that he gave me my life. True, he sent me from his presence, and refused my homage---so far I owe him neither favour nor allegiance---but I will not lift hand against him.\" \"It needs not---send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.\" \"Ye have sufficient ruffians of your own,\" said De Bracy; \"not one of mine shall budge on such an errand.\" \"Art thou so obstinate, De Bracy?\" said Prince John; \"and wilt thou forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?\" \"I mean it not,\" said De Bracy; \"I will abide by you in aught that becomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway practice comes not within my vow.\" \"Come hither, Waldemar,\" said Prince John. \"An unhappy prince am I. My father, King Henry, had faithful servants---He had but to say that he was plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.---Tracy, Morville, Brito * * Reginald Fitzurse, William de Tracy, Hugh de Morville, * and Richard Brito, were the gentlemen of Henry the * Second\u0027s household, who, instigated by some passionate * expressions of their sovereign, slew the celebrated * Thomas-a-Becket. loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen off from his father\u0027s fidelity and courage.\" \"He has fallen off from neither,\" said Waldemar Fitzurse; \"and since it may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this perilous enterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far short of what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar of saints, than put spear in rest against Coeur-de-Lion.---De Bracy, to thee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard Prince John\u0027s person. If you receive such news as I trust to send you, our enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.---Page,\" he said, \"hie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in readiness; and bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow, come to me instantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me also.---Adieu, my Prince, till better times.\" Thus speaking, he left the apartment. \"He goes to make my brother prisoner,\" said Prince John to De Bracy, \"with as little touch of compunction, as if it but concerned the liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders, and use our dear Richard\u0027s person with all due respect.\" De Bracy only answered by a smile. \"By the light of Our Lady\u0027s brow,\" said Prince John, \"our orders to him were most precise---though it may be you heard them not, as we stood together in the oriel window---Most clear and positive was our charge that Richard\u0027s safety should be cared for, and woe to Waldemar\u0027s head if he transgress it!\" \"I had better pass to his lodgings,\" said De Bracy, \"and make him fully aware of your Grace\u0027s pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may not perchance have reached that of Waldemar.\" \"Nay, nay,\" said Prince John, impatiently, \"I promise thee he heard me; and, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come hither; let me lean on thy shoulder.\" They walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince John, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say, \"What thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?---He trusts to be our Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office so high to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so readily undertaking this enterprise against Richard. Thou dost think, I warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly declining this unpleasing task---But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee for thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary to be done, the perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and there may be refusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our estimation those who deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no such good title to the high office of Chancellor, as thy chivalrous and courageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of High Marshal. Think of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.\" \"Fickle tyrant!\" muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the Prince; \"evil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor, indeed!---He who hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I trow. But High Marshal of England! that,\" he said, extending his arm, as if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the antechamber, \"that is indeed a prize worth playing for!\" De Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an attendant. \"Bid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall have spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.\" The scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John traversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps. \"Bardon,\" said he, \"what did Waldemar desire of thee?\" \"Two resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.\" \"And thou hast fitted him?\" \"Let your grace never trust me else,\" answered the master of the spies. \"One is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and Teviotdale thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other is Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry Sherwood; he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt this and Richmond.\" \"\u0027Tis well,\" said the Prince.---\"Goes Waldemar forth with them?\" \"Instantly,\" said Bardon. \"With what attendance?\" asked John, carelessly. \"Broad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his cruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that belonged to Ralph Middleton\u0027s gang---they are called the Spears of Spyinghow.\" \"\u0027Tis well,\" said Prince John; then added, after a moment\u0027s pause, \"Bardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on Maurice De Bracy---so that he shall not observe it, however---And let us know of his motions from time to time ---with whom he converses, what he proposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.\" Hugh Bardon bowed, and retired. \"If Maurice betrays me,\" said Prince John---\"if he betrays me, as his bearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard thundering at the gates of York.\" 约翰王。我告诉你，我的朋友， 他是挡在我路上的一条毒蛇， 不论我的脚瑞到哪里， 他总是在我面前，你明白我的意思吗？ 《约翰王》(注) -------- (注)莎士比亚的历史剧，引文见第三幕第三场。 在约克城堡中，约翰亲王举办了盛大的宴会，凡是他认为可以帮助他实现他的野心计划，篡夺他兄长的王位的人，包括贵族、主教和军事首脑，都在他邀请之列。他那位长袖善舞、足智多谋的助手沃尔德马·菲泽西，在这些人中进行秘密串联，鼓舞大家的勇气，为公开宣布他们的意图作了必要的准备。但是他们的冒险活动，由于这个集团中不多几个主要人物的缺席，不得不推迟了。虽然野蛮、但坚定而骁勇的牛面将军，性情浮躁、行为鲁莽的德布拉西，精明强干、富有作战经验的著名勇士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，对这次阴谋的成功具有举足轻重的作用；对他们情况不明的无故缺席，约翰和他的首席大臣只能暗中咒骂，却不敢丢开他们自行起事。犹太人以撒仿佛也消失了，因而断绝了一定的财政来源，本来这是约翰亲王与他那一伙犹太人早已讲定的。在这紧要关头，经费的短缺可能成为致命的打击。 托奎尔斯通城堡陷落的第二天早上，混乱的消息开始在约克城中传播，据说德布拉西和布瓦吉贝尔，以及他们的同伙牛面将军，已被擒住或杀死。沃尔德马把谣言报告了约翰亲王，说他担心这消息是真的，因为他知道，他们曾带了不多几个人，预备对撒克逊人塞德里克和他的随从进行袭击。在别的时候，亲王听到这种暴力活动，会当作有趣的谈笑资料，但现在，它于扰和妨碍了他的计划，他不禁大声责骂这些人胡作非为，还说这触犯了法律，扰乱了社会秩序，侵害了私有财产，那声色俱厉的口气大可与阿尔弗烈德大王相比。 “这些无法无天的强盗！”他说，“我一旦作了英国的国王，非把这些违法分子绞死在他们各自的城堡吊桥上不可。” “但是要当上英国国王，”他的亚希多弗(注)冷冷地说道，“殿下不仅必须容忍这些无法无天的强盗干的违法勾当，而且得为他们提供庇护，尽管他们常常会破坏您所颂扬和沤歌的法律。如果撒克逊乡巴佬得知殿下想把封建庄园的吊桥变成绞架，他们一定会拥戴我们；那个狂妄自大的塞德里克，也许就是怀有这种幻想的人。殿下完全清楚，没有牛面将军、德布拉西和圣殿骑士，我们的起事便很难成功；然而我们已走得太远，无法安全退却了。” -------- (注)亚希多弗，《圣经》中以色列王大卫的谋臣，但他背叛了大卫，帮助大卫的儿子沙龙谋反，见《撒母耳记下》第16章。 约翰亲王心烦意乱，连连打着额头，然后开始在屋里踱来踱去。 “这些混蛋，”他说，“背信弃义的卑鄙混蛋，在这节骨眼上抛弃了我！” “不，应该说这是些轻浮、糊涂的疯子，”沃尔德马说，“他们丢下了这件大事不干，却一心要找娘儿们谈情说爱。” “现在怎么办？”亲王说，蓦地在沃尔德马面前站住了。 “除了我已经做的以外，我不知道还有什么办法？”他的大臣答道。“我是在尽力采取了一些补救措施以后，才来向殿下报告这不幸消息的。” “你永远是我的得力助手，沃尔德马，”亲王说，“有你这么一位大臣为我出谋划策，约翰王朝一定会名垂史册。那么你已经做了些什么呢？” “我已下令，由德布拉西的副将路易·温克尔布兰德执掌号令，集合人马，打起旗号，立刻向牛面将军的城堡进发，尽一切可能，救援我们那些朋友。” 约翰亲王的脸色蓦地涨红了，他像一个娇生惯养的孩子，自以为受了欺侮，别人没把他放在眼里。 “凭上帝的名义起誓！”他说，“沃尔德马·菲泽西，你怎么这么自作主张！在我坐镇的城里，没有我的命令，也不向我请示，便擅自下令集合人马，打出旗号，这太冒失了。” “请殿下原谅，”菲泽西说，心里却在咒骂他的上司妄自尊大，“但是时间紧迫，耽误几分钟就可能无法挽救，因此我考虑只得自行承担责任，这件事这么重大，关系到殿下的成败得失呢。” “我原谅你，菲泽西，”亲王严厉地说，“你的意图抵偿了你的鲁莽冒失。但这是谁来啦？我的天，这是德布拉西啊！他怎么穿得这么奇奇怪怪的跑来见我。” 那真的是德布拉西，他满脸通红，气喘吁吁，仿佛长途跋涉，刚跨下马背。他的盔甲似乎刚经历了一场艰苦的血战，又破又旧，血迹斑斑，从头到脚沾满了污泥和尘土。他摘下头盔，把它放在桌上，站了一会，仿佛要定下伸来，才能报告他的消息。 “德布拉西，”约翰亲王说，“这是怎么回事？讲啊，我命令你讲！是撒克逊人造反了吗？” “讲呀，德布拉西，”菲泽西几乎与他的主人同时开口道，“你一向是勇敢的啊。圣殿骑士在哪儿？牛面将军在哪儿？” “圣殿骑士逃走了，”德布拉西说，“牛面将军你们是再也见不到啦。他的城堡烧成了灰烬，他自己也葬身在火窟中了，只有我跑了出来，向你们报告消息。” “尽管你讲的是燃烧和大火，我们听了却只觉得浑身发冷，”沃尔德马说。 “最坏的消息还没讲呢，”德布拉西答道，于是他走到约翰亲王面前，用轻轻的、十分郑重的声音说道：“理查回到英国了，我亲自看到了他，还与他讲了话。” 约翰亲王的脸色霎时变白了，两腿索索发抖，他只得抓住栎木椅背支撑自己，仿佛有一支箭射中了他的胸口。 “你在胡诌，德布拉西，”菲泽西说，“这不可能。” “事情千真万确，”德布拉西说，“我还当了他的俘虏，与他讲话来着。” “你是说与金雀花王朝的理查讲过话？”菲泽西继续问。 勺｝，与金雀花王朝的理查，与狮心王理查，与英国的理查王讲过话，”德布拉西答道。 “你还当了他的俘虏？”沃尔德马说，“那么他率领着一支军队？” “不，他的周围只有一些乡巴佬，一些亡命之徒，他们不知道他的身分。我听他说，他马上就要离开他们。他与他们在一起，只是要帮助他们攻打托奎尔斯通。” “对，”菲泽西说，“这确实是理查的作风；他是真正的游侠骑士，愿意漂泊各地，凭他的一身武艺扶危济困，就像盖依和贝维斯(注)那类人物，却把国家大事丢在脑后，也不顾自身的安危。德布拉西，那么你打算怎么办呢？” -------- (注)英国古代民间传说和歌谣中的英雄和游侠，但不一定实有其人。 “我？我向理查表示，愿意把我的自由团队供他驱策，但他拒绝了。现在我只得把他们带往赫尔，伺机渡海，前往佛兰德，好在目前兵荒马乱，一个人只要肯干，不怕找不到雇佣他的人。至于你，沃尔德马，你愿意抛弃政治，拿起长枪和盾牌跟我一起干，共同分担上帝给我们的命运吗？” “我太老了，莫里斯，而且我还有一个女儿，”沃尔德马答道。 “把她嫁给我，菲泽西，她不会吃亏，我凭一匹战马和一支枪，便能让她过得舒舒服服的，”德布拉西说。 “这不成，”菲泽西答道，“我要在这里圣彼得教堂中寻求庇护，它的大主教与我是结义弟兄。” 在他们这么谈论时，约翰亲王已逐渐镇静，从那个意外消息引起的震惊中醒来了，他注意听着两个部下的谈话，心里想：“他们打算离开我了，他们与我的关系就像树上的枯叶，只要一缕微风吹过，便会脱离树枝！这些恶鬼应该入地狱！在这些懦夫抛弃我的时候，难道我就束手无策了吗？”他停了一会，怀着恶毒阴险的心情，竭力发出了一阵狂笑，这终于打断了他们的谈话。 “哈哈哈！我的大臣们，凭圣母的光辉起誓，我一直把你们看作明达的人，勇敢的人，足智多谋的人，对来之不易的成就会真心爱护，谁知正当我们高贵的事业，只要再加一把劲，便可大功告成的时候，你们却想临阵脱逃，把唾手可得的荣华富贵统统抛弃了！” “我不懂您的意思，”德布拉西说。“理查回来的消息只要一传开，他马上会拥有一支军队，于是我们便一切都完了。我的殿下，我劝您还是赶紧逃往法国，或者设法取得母后的保护吧。” “我不是为自己的安全考虑，”约翰亲王傲慢地说，“我只要跟我的哥哥说一声就没事了。但是你，德布拉西，还有你，沃尔德马·菲泽西，尽管你们随时准备抛弃我，我却不忍心看到你们的头颅挂在克利福德监狱门口示众。沃尔德马，你想，那位诡计多端的大主教，为了与理查国王言归于好，不会让你从他的祭台旁边抓走吗？德布拉西，你难道忘记，在你和赫尔之间，驻扎着罗伯特·埃斯托特维尔的大批军队，而且埃塞克斯伯爵正在招兵买马，扩充实力？如果在理查回国以前，我们有理由提防他们的这些活动，那么现在，他们会站在哪一边，难道还有疑问吗？相信我，埃斯托特维尔一个人就有足够的力量，把你的自由团队赶进亨伯河中了。” 沃尔德马·菲泽西和德布拉酉面面相觑，垂头丧气。“安全的道路只有一条，”亲王继续道，脸色变得像黑夜一样阴沉可怕，“使我们不安的这个人是单身旅行，我们应该主动找他。” “我不干，”德布拉西马上说，“我是他的俘虏，他宽恕了我。我不愿伤害他的一根毫毛。” “谁说要害他啦？”约翰亲王说，露出了阴险的冷笑，“说不定哪个无赖还会说我想暗杀他呢！不，还是牢房比较好；它在英国还是在奥地利，这有什么不同？这样，一切便与我们开始这场冒险以前完全一样。我们的前提只是假定理查仍在德国当他的俘虏。我们有一个亲族罗伯特(注)便是给囚禁以后，死在加的夫城堡的。” -------- (注)指征服者威廉的长子罗伯特，见本书第十五章。 “对，”沃尔德马说，“但是你的祖先亨利的王位很稳定，殿下可不同。我认为最可靠的监牢，还是教堂司事管辖的墓地，没有一间牢房比教堂的墓穴更坚固。我的话完了。” “不论监牢或坟墓，这件事我决不插手，”德布拉西说。 “混蛋！”约翰亲王说，“你想出卖我们的计划不成？” “我不想出卖你们，”德布拉西骄傲地说，“但是我也不准别人把混蛋这个称呼加在我的身上！” “不要争吵，我的骑士！”沃尔德马说。“殿下，我也希望您原谅勇敢的德布拉西，他只是有些顾虑，我相信我会很快说服他的。” “你的口才在我这里没有用，菲泽西，”骑士答道。 “我的莫里斯爵爷，”狡猾的大臣接口道，“干吗要像一只受惊的马那么逃之夭夭，至少考虑一下啊。这个理查，不过一天以前，你还口口声声说，要跟他在战场上一对一地决一死战；这样的话我已听你讲过一百遍了。” “对，”德布拉西说，“但正如你讲的，那是一个对一个，是在战场上！我叭没说过，我要趁他单身一人的时候，在森林中袭击他。” “如果你对这种事有顾虑，你就不是一个出色的骑士，”沃尔德马说。 “朗斯洛和特里斯特拉姆(注)是在战场上赢得荣誉的吗？他们不是也躲在无人知晓的森林中，从暗处袭击强大的武士吗？” -------- (注)英国中世纪故事亚瑟王传奇中的两个著名骑士，一向被看作骑士的典范。 “对，但我可以告诉你，”德布拉西说，“不论特里斯特拉姆还是朗斯洛，如果一个对一个，都不是金雀花王朝的理查的对手，而且我相信，他们人来不想几个人攻打一个人。” “你疯了不成，德布拉西？我们要你招募这支自由团队的雇佣兵，还不是要他们用自己的剑，为约翰亲王效力吗？可是现在我们要你对我们的敌人采取行动，你却迟疑不决，尽管你的保护人，你的朋友和你自己的命运，我们每一个人的生命和荣誉，都面临着千钧一发的危险！” “我告诉你，”德布拉西绷着脸说，“他给了我一条生路。确实，他不要我跟随他，拒绝我为他效力，因此我不欠他的情，也不必对他效忠；但是我不能用我的手害他。” “这用不到，你可以派路易·温克尔布兰德带二十个部下去干。” “你们手下有的是杀人不眨眼的暴徒，”德布拉酉说。“我一个也不派，不想让我的部下介入这事。” “德布拉西，你怎么这么固执？”约翰亲王说。“你讲过不少要为我出生入死的话，可现在却袖手旁观吗？” “不能这么说，”德布拉西答道，“只要是适合一个骑士干的，不论在比武场上还是在战场上，我都乐意为您效劳，但那种盗匪行为不在我的誓言之内。” “到这儿来，沃尔德马，”约翰亲王说，“我是一个不幸的亲王。我的父亲亨利国王身边的人都忠心耿耿，他只要说一声，那个闹独立的教士弄得他寝食不安，托马斯·贝克特(注1)尽管是个圣徒，他的血马上流在自己的祭台脚下了。除了特拉西、莫维尔、布里托(注2)这些忠诚而英勇的人，其中也有你的家族，可是现在这种精神在你身上消失了！雷金纳德·菲泽西虽然留下了一个儿子，但他已失去了他父亲的忠诚和勇敢。” -------- (注1)托马斯·贝克特（ill一1170），英国教士，曾任亨利二世的枢密大臣，后又被任命为坎特伯雷大主教。但在任大主教期间，他站在罗马教皇一边，主张君主不得干预教会的事务，因而被亨利二世派人杀死。 (注2)雷金纳德·菲泽西，威廉·特拉西，休·莫维尔，以及理查·布里托，都是亨利二世的卫士，由于国王对托马斯·贝克特的行为表示了强烈的不满，他们便把那位著名的大主教杀死了。——原注 “他什么也没失去，”沃尔德马·菲泽西说。“既然没有更好的办法，我愿意亲自承担这项危险的任务。不过，虽然我的父亲付出了很高代价，才博得一位亲切的朋友的赞美，他为证明他对亨利的忠诚所作的事，比起我要做的，还是差得很远，因为我宁可举起枪来进攻所有的圣徒，也不愿与狮心王对抗。德布拉酉，我只能要求你提高警惕，保护约翰亲王的安全了。我相信我会给你们带来好消息，到那时我们的事业便万无一失了。侍从，”他又道，“赶快回我的住宅去，告诉我的军械师作好一切准备；同时传我的话，叫斯蒂芬·韦瑟拉尔和布罗德·托雷斯比，还有斯派豪的三名长枪手，马上前来见我；让侦察队长休·巴登也等着我。再见，亲王，我们会面的时候情况就会好转了。”这么说完，他便走出了屋子。 “他要去把我的哥哥关进牢房，”约翰亲王对德布拉酉说，“可是他一点也不觉得良心有愧，好像这涉及的仅仅是一个撒克逊庄主的自由。我希望他能按照我的指示行事，用应有的礼貌对待我亲爱的理查哥哥。” 德布拉西的回答只是微微一笑。 “凭圣母的荣光起誓，”约翰亲王说，“我给他的命令十分明确，不过你可能没有听到，当时我们是一起站在那扇凸肚窗前谈的。我给他的任务非常清晰和精确，那就是必须保证理查的安全；如果沃尔德马越出这条界线，我便得要他的脑袋！” “我想我还是到他的寓所走一次，”德布拉西说，“把殿下的意思再明确叮嘱他一下，因为我既然没有听到这话，沃尔德马可能也没有听到。” “不，不，”约翰亲王不耐烦地说，“我保证他听到了，再说，我还有别的任务交代你，莫里斯，到这儿来，让我靠在你的肩上。” 他们在大厅里绕了一圈，保持着这种亲密的姿势；约翰亲王操起十分机密的口气，开始说道：“我的德布拉西，你觉得这个沃尔德马·菲泽西怎么样？他是指望担任首相呢。可是在我任命一个人担当这么高的职务时，我自然得郑重考虑一下，你想，这个人居然毫不犹豫便自告奋勇，要去拘捕理查，可见他对我们王族是缺乏必要的尊敬的。我敢说你一定以为，你这么大胆拒绝了这个不愉快的任务，必然会失去我的宠信。其实不然，莫里斯！我倒是对你的坚贞操守十分钦佩。有许多不得不做的事，做的人不一定能得到我们的尊敬和喜爱；可是拒绝这么做的人却会得到我们的器重，尽管他不愿照我们的要求行事。逮捕我不幸的兄长这件事，对任命首相这样的高级职务，不能构成有利的条件，可是你的拒绝却表现了英勇的骑士风度，使你完全有资格接受大元帅的权杖。记住这点，德布拉西，去办你的事吧。” “阴险多变的暴君！”德布拉西一边向亲王告辞，一边在心里嘀咕，“谁相信你，便活该倒霉。首相，确实不错！但是，谁当你的心腹大臣，恐怕非吃苦头不可。不过英国的大元帅！这……”他说，伸出了胳臂，仿佛在接受那根权杖，一边昂首阔步地走出了前室，“这倒确实不坏，值得争取！” 德布拉西刚离开屋子，约翰亲王立刻召来他的侍卫。 “命令我的侦察队长休·巴登与沃尔德马·菲泽西谈完以后，马上前来见我。” 他在屋里踱来踱去，显得心绪不宁，脚步趔趔趄趄的，但隔不多久，侦察队长便进屋来了。 “巴登，”亲王说，“沃尔德马要你干什么啦？” “要我派两名得力的人给他，必须熟悉这一带北方荒野，善于辨认人和马的踪迹的。” “你提供了合适的人没有？” “这种事殿下放心好了，”侦察队长答道。“我派的人，一个是从赫克瑟姆郡来的，一向在泰恩河谷和蒂维厄特河谷侦查盗贼，行动像猎狗跟踪受伤的鹿那么灵敏。另一个是在约克郡长大的，时常在快活的谢尔伍德森林中打猎，熟悉从这里到里士满之间每一片森林的地理形势和树木位置。” “这很好，”亲王说，“沃尔德马跟他们动身没有？” “马上动身，”巴登说。 “随行的有谁？”约翰漫不经心似的问。 “布罗德·托雷斯比与他一起去，还有韦瑟拉尔，这人心狠手辣涸此大家称他铁石心肠的斯蒂芬，还有原来属于拉尔夫·米德尔顿一伙的三名北方士兵，人称斯派豪的长枪手的。” “很好，”约翰亲王说，停了一会又道，“巴登，有一件事很重要，你必须密切注意莫里斯·德布拉西的行动，但不能让他发觉。你得把他的行踪随时向我报告，他与什么人谈话，谈了些什么等等。这事不能疏忽，否则你得负责。” 休·巴登鞠躬告退了。 “如果莫里斯出卖我……”约翰亲王在心中说，“他的行动使我不得不担忧，但是如果他出卖我，哪怕理查已攻到约克的城门口，我也非处死他不可。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2696.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷
