{"id":6132,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 39","content":"O maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art, My bosom is proud as thine own. Seward It was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be called such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door of Rebecca\u0027s prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then engaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which concluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English. When Israel, of the Lord beloved, Out of the land of bondage came, Her father\u0027s God before her moved, An awful guide, in smoke and flame. By day, along the astonish\u0027d lands The cloudy pillar glided slow; By night, Arabia\u0027s crimson\u0027d sands Return\u0027d the fiery column\u0027s glow. There rose the choral hymn of praise, And trump and timbrel answer\u0027d keen, And Zion\u0027s daughters pour\u0027d their lays, With priest\u0027s and warrior\u0027s voice between. No portents now our foes amaze, Forsaken Israel wanders lone; Our fathers would not know THY ways, And THOU hast left them to their own. But, present still, though now unseen; When brightly shines the prosperous day, Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen To temper the deceitful ray. And oh, when stoops on Judah\u0027s path In shade and storm the frequent night, Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath, A burning, and a shining light! Our harps we left by Babel\u0027s streams, The tyrant\u0027s jest, the Gentile\u0027s scorn; No censer round our altar beams, And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn. But THOU hast said, the blood of goat, The flesh of rams, I will not prize; A contrite heart, and humble thought, Are mine accepted sacrifice. When the sounds of Rebecca\u0027s devotional hymn had died away in silence, the low knock at the door was again renewed. \"Enter,\" she said, \"if thou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy entrance.\" \"I am,\" said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, \"friend or foe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.\" Alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she considered as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with a cautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest corner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she could, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible. She drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution, as one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it, being offered, to the utmost of her power. \"You have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,\" said the Templar; \"or if I must so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to fear me.\" \"I fear you not, Sir Knight,\" replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; \"my trust is strong, and I fear thee not.\" \"You have no cause,\" answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; \"my former frantic attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are guards, over whom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death, Rebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one, even by me, were my frenzy---for frenzy it is---to urge me so far.\" \"May Heaven be praised!\" said the Jewess; \"death is the least of my apprehensions in this den of evil.\" \"Ay,\" replied the Templar, \"the idea of death is easily received by the courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A thrust with a lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little ---To you, a spring from a dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors, compared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me---I say this---perhaps mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, Rebecca, than thine are; but we know alike how to die for them.\" \"Unhappy man,\" said the Jewess; \"and art thou condemned to expose thy life for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge the solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which is not bread---but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate on the wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the Rock of Ages.\" \"Silence, maiden,\" answered the Templar; \"such discourse now avails but little. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted course of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men calls thy crime.\" \"And to whom---if such my fate---to whom do I owe this?\" said Rebecca \"surely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause, dragged me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.\" \"Think not,\" said the Templar, \"that I have so exposed thee; I would have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as ever I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.\" \"Had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,\" said Rebecca, \"I had thanked thee for thy care---as it is, thou hast claimed merit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me, preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.\" \"Truce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,\" said the Templar; \"I have my own cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it.\" \"What is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?\" said the Jewess; \"speak it briefly.---If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to myself---the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and I have few moments to prepare for it.\" \"I perceive, Rebecca,\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"that thou dost continue to burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I have prevented.\" \"Sir Knight,\" said Rebecca, \"I would avoid reproaches---But what is more certain than that I owe my death to thine unbridled passion?\" \"You err---you err,\"---said the Templar, hastily, \"if you impute what I could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency. ---Could I guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of frantic valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid self-torments of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above common sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our Order, who think and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the grounds of his opinions and actions?\" \"Yet,\" said Rebecca, \"you sate a judge upon me, innocent---most innocent---as you knew me to be---you concurred in my condemnation, and, if I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my guilt, and assure my punishment.\" \"Thy patience, maiden,\" replied the Templar. \"No race knows so well as thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark as to make advantage even of an adverse wind.\" \"Lamented be the hour,\" said Rebecca, \"that has taught such art to the House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the stubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and the denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before strangers. It is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own misdeeds and those of our fathers; but you---you who boast your freedom as your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to soothe the prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?\" \"Your words are bitter, Rebecca,\" said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the apartment with impatience, \"but I came not hither to bandy reproaches with you.---Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although circumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is the mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside by the rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. That scroll which warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it came, if not from Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou have excited such interest?\" \"A brief respite from instant death,\" said Rebecca, \"which will little avail me---was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou hast heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the tomb?\" \"No maiden,\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"this was NOT all that I purposed. Had it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and the fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the Champion Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion of the Order. Then I myself---such was my purpose---had, on the sounding of the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed in the fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his shield and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two or three of the brethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them out of the saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine innocence have been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have trusted for the reward of my victory.\" \"This, Sir Knight,\" said Rebecca, \"is but idle boasting---a brag of what you would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise. You received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can find one, must encounter your lance in the lists ---yet you would assume the air of my friend and protector!\" \"Thy friend and protector,\" said the Templar, gravely, \"I will yet be---but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of dishonour; and then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all that I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.\" \"Speak,\" said Rebecca; \"I understand thee not.\" \"Well, then,\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"I will speak as freely as ever did doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky confessional.---Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and rank---lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I mean, in which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding to that mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard Lucas de Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such is my certain doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause. Accursed be he of Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed Albert de Malvoisin, who withheld me from the resolution I had formed, of hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and superannuated fool, who listened to a charge so absurd, and against a creature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!\" \"And what now avails rant or flattery?\" answered Rebecca. \"Thou hast made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent woman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes---What avails it to reckon together?---thy choice is made.\" \"No, Rebecca,\" said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer towards her; \"my choice is NOT made---nay, mark, it is thine to make the election. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms; and if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and faggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on equal issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and his minion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear his corslet, and Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou diest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth to enter the lists in thy defence.\" \"And what avails repeating this so often?\" said Rebecca. \"Much,\" replied the Templar; \"for thou must learn to look at thy fate on every side.\" \"Well, then, turn the tapestry,\" said the Jewess, \"and let me see the other side.\" \"If I appear,\" said Bois-Guilbert, \"in the fatal lists, thou diest by a slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels---the illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour, I lose the prospect of such greatness as scarce emperors attain to---I sacrifice mighty ambition, I destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled---and yet, Rebecca,\" he added, throwing himself at her feet, \"this greatness will I sacrifice, this fame will I renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it is half within my grasp, if thou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee for my lover.\" \"Think not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,\" answered Rebecca, \"but hasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John ---they cannot, in honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand Master. So shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part, or the pretext of requiring any requital from me.\" \"With these I deal not,\" he continued, holding the train of her robe---\"it is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy choice? Bethink thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is death who is my rival.\" \"I weigh not these evils,\" said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even feign to endure it. \"Be a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions pretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital which would change thy magnanimity into base barter.\" \"No, damsel!\" said the proud Templar, springing up, \"thou shalt not thus impose on me---if I renounce present fame and future ambition, I renounce it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me, Rebecca,\" he said, again softening his tone; \"England,---Europe,---is not the world. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even for my ambition. We will go to Palestine, where Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat, is my friend---a friend free as myself from the doting scruples which fetter our free-born reason----rather with Saladin will we league ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn. ---I will form new paths to greatness,\" he continued, again traversing the room with hasty strides---\"Europe shall hear the loud step of him she has driven from her sons!---Not the millions whom her crusaders send to slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine---not the sabres of the thousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep into that land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of me and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere to me in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen, Rebecca---on Mount Carmel shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will exchange my long-desired batoon for a sceptre!\" \"A dream,\" said Rebecca; \"an empty vision of the night, which, were it a waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which thou mightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or religious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties, and cast away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member, in order to gratify an unruly passion for the daughter of another people.---Put not a price on my deliverance, Sir Knight---sell not a deed of generosity---protect the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not for a selfish advantage---Go to the throne of England; Richard will listen to my appeal from these cruel men.\" \"Never, Rebecca!\" said the Templar, fiercely. \"If I renounce my Order, for thee alone will I renounce it---Ambition shall remain mine, if thou refuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands. ---Stoop my crest to Richard?---ask a boon of that heart of pride?---Never, Rebecca, will I place the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake the Order, I never will degrade or betray it.\" \"Now God be gracious to me,\" said Rebecca, \"for the succour of man is well-nigh hopeless!\" \"It is indeed,\" said the Templar; \"for, proud as thou art, thou hast in me found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest, think not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength; and think then upon thine own fate ---to die the dreadful death of the worst of criminals---to be consumed upon a blazing pile---dispersed to the elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed---not a relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived and moved!---Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect ---thou wilt yield to my suit.\" \"Bois-Guilbert,\" answered the Jewess, \"thou knowest not the heart of woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best feelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown by woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a woman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient of pain---yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to suffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that my courage shall mount higher than thine. Farewell---I waste no more words on thee; the time that remains on earth to the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise spent---she must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his people, but who ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in sincerity and in truth.\" \"We part then thus?\" said the Templar, after a short pause; \"would to Heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth and Christian in faith!---Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think when and how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine own degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my look only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor---this could I wish, Rebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share I must have in thy death.\" \"Thou hast spoken the Jew,\" said Rebecca, \"as the persecution of such as thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his country, but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence, which oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history of the people of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such marvels among the nations, were then a people of misers and of usurers!---And know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which your boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the cedar---names that ascend far back to those high times when the Divine Presence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive their splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful Voice, which bade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the Vision---Such were the princes of the House of Jacob.\" Rebecca\u0027s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race, but faded as she added, with at sigh, \"Such WERE the princes of Judah, now such no more!---They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and mixed with the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who shame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac the son of Adonikam! Farewell!---I envy not thy blood-won honours---I envy not thy barbarous descent from northern heathens---I envy thee not thy faith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy practice.\" \"There is a spell on me, by Heaven!\" said Bois-Guilbert. \"I almost think yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with which I part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.---Fair creature!\" he said, approaching near her, but with great respect,---\"so young, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and with infamy and agony. Who would not weep for thee?---The tear, that has been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I gaze on thee. But it must be---nothing may now save thy life. Thou and I are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that hurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which are dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let us part, at least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in vain, and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.\" \"Thus,\" said Rebecca, \"do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild passions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the author of my early death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind; but it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.\" \"Yes,\" said the Templar, \"I am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me, untaught, untamed---and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and crafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me above them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high in my views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I remain---proud, inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall have proof.---But thou forgivest me, Rebecca?\" \"As freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.\" \"Farewell, then,\" said the Templar, and left the apartment. The Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the return of Bois-Guilbert. \"Thou hast tarried long,\" he said; \"I have been as if stretched on red-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or his spy Conrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.---But what ails thee, brother?---Thy step totters, thy brow is as black as night. Art thou well, Bois-Guilbert?\" \"Ay,\" answered the Templar, \"as well as the wretch who is doomed to die within an hour.---Nay, by the rood, not half so well---for there be those in such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By Heaven, Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me. I am half resolved to go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth, and refuse to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me.\" \"Thou art mad,\" answered Malvoisin; \"thou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin thyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life of this Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will name another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the accused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed on thee.\" \"\u0027Tis false---I will myself take arms in her behalf,\" answered the Templar, haughtily; \"and, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, that thou knowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point of my lance.\" \"Ay, but thou forgettest,\" said the wily adviser, \"thou wilt have neither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to Lucas Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see how long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom. The words shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an hundred feet under ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide trial as a recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy possession, thou wilt be enjoying straw, darkness, and chains, in some distant convent cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy water, to expel the foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee. Thou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.\" \"I will break forth and fly,\" said Bois-Guilbert---\"fly to some distant land, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way. No drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by my sanction.\" \"Thou canst not fly,\" said the Preceptor; \"thy ravings have excited suspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go and make the essay---present thyself before the gate, and command the bridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.---Thou are surprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou to fly, what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of thine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?---Think on it. Where shall thine old companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant, amid the hisses of the assembled people? What grief will be at the Court of France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news, that the knight that set him hard in Palestine, and well-nigh darkened his renown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could not even save by so costly a sacrifice!\" \"Malvoisin,\" said the Knight, \"I thank thee---thou hast touched the string at which my heart most readily thrills!---Come of it what may, recreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to God, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear in these lists! But they will be empty---no one will risk to break a lance for the innocent, the forlorn.\" \"The better for thee, if it prove so,\" said the Preceptor; \"if no champion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall die, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame, and who will count that blame for praise and commendation.\" \"True,\" said Bois-Guilbert; \"if no champion appears, I am but a part of the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no part in what is to follow.\" \"None whatever,\" said Malvoisin; \"no more than the armed image of Saint George when it makes part of a procession.\" \"Well, I will resume my resolution,\" replied the haughty Templar. \"She has despised me---repulsed me---reviled me---And wherefore should I offer up for her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others? Malvoisin, I will appear in the lists.\" He left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the Preceptor followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in Bois-Guilbert\u0027s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much advantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to mention the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on condition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca. Yet although, in combating his friend\u0027s better feelings, he possessed all the advantage which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over a man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all Malvoisin\u0027s art to keep Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had prevailed on him to adopt. He was obliged to watch him closely to prevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to intercept his communication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an open rupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as champion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating or ensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which he could save himself from degradation and disgrace. 啊，姑娘，尽管你这么倔强和冷酷， 我的心可是与你的一样高傲。 西沃德(注) -------- (注)安娜·西沃德（1747—1809），英国女诗人，曾活跃于当时的文学界，死后，她的诗作由司各特于1810年予以出版。 在丽贝卡的审问——如果那可以称作审问的话——举行的当天傍晚，囚禁她的牢房门上响起了轻轻的叩门声。屋里的人没有理睬它，因为她正按照她的宗教的要求，聚精会神地作晚祷，祷告的最后是一篇赞歌，如果把它译成英文，大致便是这样： 当主所爱护的以色列人， 走出奴役他们的土地时， 上帝在前面给他们领路， 在烟和火中作他们敬畏的向导。 白天在危机四伏的土地上， 云柱护卫着他们缓缓向前移动， 夜晚阿拉伯半岛的红色砂土 又用光亮的火柱照耀着他们前进。 赞美的歌声从他们中间升起， 号角和手鼓紧紧追随着歌声， 锡安的女儿们在齐声欢唱， 教士和武士的声音互相应和。 现在不再有凶兆令敌人畏惧， 以色列人仿佛成了荒野中的孤儿， 我们的祖先不了解你的意图， 误以为你已把他们抛弃不管。 其实我们看不到你，你仍在我们身边 在光辉灿烂的兴旺日子， 你在我们心中仍是云雾的屏障， 可以遮挡虚假欺诈的光线。 在魅影幢幢夜幕降临的时候， 你也总是降临在犹太人的旅途上， 你容忍一切，从不轻易震怒， 你是燃烧不息的光芒四射的明灯！ 我们的竖琴已留在巴别的河岸边， 它遭到了暴君耻笑，外邦人的凌辱； 我们的祭台上不再有香烟缭统， 我们的手鼓、喇。和号角也已沉寂。 但是你说过：山羊的血， 公羊的肉，都不是我所需要的； 悔改的心和恭顺的思想， 才是我所要求的祭品。(注) -------- (注)这诗的第一节写以色列人逃出埃及的情形，根据《旧约·出埃及记》。第二、三节写他们获得自由后的欢乐，以及继之而来的迷茫，但上帝仍在他们身边，保护着他们。第四节的巴别出自《旧约·创世记》，是挪亚的后裔建立的城市，但在希伯来文中，巴别就是巴比伦，因此这里是说以色列人从“巴比伦囚虏”中释放后流亡各地的心情。 当丽贝卡的虔诚歌声终于沉寂之后，轻轻的叩门声又出现了。她答道：“如果你是朋友，进来吧；如果你是敌人，那么我也无法拒绝你进来。” “我是朋友还是敌人，丽贝卡，”布里思·布瓦吉贝尔一边进屋，一边说道，“就要看这次会见的结果怎样了。” 丽贝卡认为她的灾难的根源，便是这个人肆无忌惮的情欲，因此一看见这个人心中已经慌了，立刻向后退缩，但这举动是在惊恐中防备万一，不是害怕；她一直退到了屋子最远的一角，仿佛决定要离他越远越好，只是到了退无可退的地方才站住。她采取的态度不是蔑视，而是坚决，这是表示她并不想挑衅，然而如果她遭到攻击，她就会尽她所有的力量反抗到底。 “你没有理由怕我，丽贝卡，”圣殿骑士说，“或者讲得准确一些，至少目前你没有理由怕我。” “我并不怕你，骑士先生，”丽贝卡答道，尽管她的急促呼吸与她的英勇口气不太一致，“我充满自信，我不怕你。” “你也不必怕我，”布瓦吉贝尔严肃地说道，“我以前的疯狂意图你现在不用再担心。这儿门外就有守兵，他们是连我也管不了的。他们可以把你押赴刑场处死，丽贝卡，但是他们不会容许任何人侮辱你，这也包括我在内，如果我的疯狂——这确实是一种疯狂——迫使我这么做的话。” “那真是谢天谢地！”犹太姑娘说，“在这个罪恶的魔窟中，我担心的根本不是死。” “是的，”圣殿骑士答道，“对于勇敢的心灵，死的观念是容易接受的，如果通向它的道路突然打开的话。一枪刺死，或者一刀砍死，对我算不得什么；对于你，从高耸的城墙上纵身一跃，或者给锋利的匕首刺中心脏，都并不可怕，你和我一样，都是把耻辱看得更严重的。但是请你听我说，也许我的荣誉感也像你的一样，只是一种幻想，丽贝卡，然而我们同样懂得，怎样为了它慷慨就死。” “不幸的人，”犹太姑娘说道，“难道你曾冒生命的危险，只是为了那些连你清醒的理智也并不信以为真的原则吗？这无疑是为了不能活命的食物，抛弃你最珍贵的东西。但我不是这样，不要这么理解我。你的决心会随着人们互相矛盾、千变万化的看法而摇摆不定，我的意志却是建立在永恒的磐石(注)上的。” -------- (注)出自《圣经》，《以赛亚书》第26章第4节说：“你们当依靠耶和华直到永远，因为耶和华是永久的磐石。” “别说了，姑娘，”圣殿骑士答道，“这样的争论现在没有多大意义。你已被判处了死刑，但这种死不是一瞬间的痛苦，不是烦恼所挑选的、绝望所欢迎的那种死，这是一种缓慢而悲惨的死，一种漫长的痛苦过程，只适用于那些顽固的恶魔对你所指控的那种罪行。” “如果这是我的命运，那么是谁造成的呢？”丽贝卡说，“当然是那个出于自私而粗暴的动机，把我劫持到这儿的人，那个出于不可告人的目的，至今仍在夸大他所带给我的悲惨命运的人。” “不要这么想，”圣殿骑士说，“这不是我要你接受的命运。我愿意用我的胸膛来保卫你，就像我曾经用它来掩护你，迎接射向你的许多箭一样。” “如果你是为了正义的目的，保护一个无辜的人，”丽贝卡说，“那么我已经为你的关心，感谢过你了。然而现在你一再向我表功，我只得正告你，如果活着便得付出你要我付出的代价，那么这样的生活对我毫无价值。” “你的责备可以收场了，丽贝卡，”圣殿骑士说，“我已经够痛苦了，再也受不了你的谴责给我增加的烦恼。” “那么你来的目的是什么，骑士先生？”犹太姑娘说。“讲干脆一些。你除了来看看你给我造成的痛苦以外，是否还有别的原因，请你告诉我。然后马上离开，不要再纠缠我。在我的一生和永恒之间，已只剩了短短的、但可怕的一步，我没有多少时间为这一步作准备了。” “丽贝卡，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“我看到，你还在把你的苦难归咎于我，其实这是我干方百计想制止的。”． “骑士先生，”丽贝卡说，“我可以不再责怪你，但是我的死来源于你放纵的情欲，难道不是确定不移的事实吗？” “你错了，错了，”圣殿骑士赶紧说，“你是把我既未预见到，也无法防止的事，看作了我的意图或谋划。我怎么会料到那个老顽固会突然到来呢？这家伙只是表现了几次疯狂的勇气，得到了一些傻瓜对他愚昧无知、自我折磨的禁欲生活的颂扬，才爬上了现在的地位，这超过了他自身的才能，也超过了通常的情理，使他凌驾于我和骑士团中的许多人之上；我们并不同意他那些无聊的、荒唐的偏见，然而它们却是他的观点和行动的基础。” “可是你却成了审判我的法官，”丽贝卡说，“你明明知道我是无辜的，根本没有错，可是你却同意了对我的判决。如果我没有听错，现在便是要由你来参加决斗，确认我的罪名，行使对我的惩罚。” “耐心一点，姑娘，”圣殿骑士答道。“没有一个民族像你们犹太人那样懂得怎样暂时忍耐，等待时机，以便在逆风中安全行船的道理。” “以色列人懂得这个道理，是在生死存亡的悲痛时刻！”丽贝卡说道。“那是灾难使人忍气吞声，就像烈火使坚硬的钢铁弯折一样；那些不再能主宰自己命运的人民，那些失去了自由独立的国家的公民，在外邦人面前只能低头屈服。这是我们的不幸，骑士先生，是我们自己和我们祖先的罪孽造成的。但是你们——你们自称自由是你们的天赋权利，那么你们违反自己的信念，屈从别人的偏见，这耻辱不是严重得多吗？” “你的话太尖刻了，丽贝卡，”布瓦吉贝尔说，不耐烦地在屋里踱来踱去，“不过我到这里来不是为了跟你互相指责。你要知道，布瓦吉贝尔是从不向人屈服的，尽管环境有时会使他改变自己的计划。他的意志像山中的溪流，有时一块石头可能使它改变一段流程，但是它最终还是要奔向大海。那张提醒你要求请人决斗的字条，除了布瓦吉贝尔，你以为还有谁会写呢？除了他，还有谁会对你这么关心呢？” “将立即处死改为暂缓执行，对我说来没有多大意义，”丽贝卡说。“你把我推进了痛苦的深渊，甚至已到达了坟墓的边缘，难道你出了那个主意便算尽了你的责任吗？” “不，姑娘，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“这不是我的全部意图。可惜这件事给那个疯狂的老顽固，还有古达尔利克的那个傻瓜搅乱了，古达尔利克的这个人作为圣殿骑士，自以为通达情理，在按照一般的规则办事呢；要不然，代表骑士团进行决斗的任务不会落到一个会督身上，团内的任何骑士都可以担当。这样——这是我的目的—— 我便可以在号音吹响时，改扮成一个路经此地的骑士，为了一献身手，才自告奋勇，作为你的斗士进入比武场的；那么，随博马诺在我们的弟兄中怎么挑选，哪怕挑选两个、三个斗士来与我比试，我也有把握凭我一支枪把他们统统打下马背。于是丽贝卡，你的无辜便可得到证明，我也因而赢得了你的感谢，你当然会报答我。” “骑士先生，”丽贝卡说，“这只是你编造的故事——在没有合适的办法达到目的时，你便用这种花言巧语来标榜自己。你接受了我的手套，就必须在比武场上与我的斗士——如果我这个孤苦无依的人能找到一个的话——一决雌雄；你却还要装出一副姿态，好像是我的朋友和保护人！” “是的，”圣殿骑士严肃地说，“我仍要作你的朋友和保护人；只是你知道，这得冒多大的危险，几乎可以说，这必然会使我名誉扫地。因此请你不要责备我，在我为了挽救一个犹太姑娘的生命，抛弃我以前所珍爱的一切以前，我必须先取得你的承诺。” “讲下去，”丽贝卡说，“我不明白你的意思。” “那么好吧，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“我就像一个诚心悔改的人进了忏悔室，面对神父无话不讲了。丽贝卡，如果我不走上那个比武场，我便会失去名誉和地位——失去我的鼻孔呼吸的空气，也就是失去弟兄们对我的尊敬，失去飞黄腾达，继承老顽固卢加斯·博马诺现在的位置的机会，当然，一旦我爬到他的位置上，我的做法会与他完全不同。除非我参加反对你的比武，否则我的命运便是这样。可恨的是古达尔利克的那个家伙，让我走进了死胡同！更可恨的是，艾伯特·马尔沃辛拦住了我，不让我把手套当面掷回给那个老糊涂，这家伙又迷信，又悻晦，居然会主持这么荒谬的审问，要把你这么一个心地光明磊落，又生得如花侧五的女子当场处死！” “可是现在你对我夸夸其谈或者奉承巴结，又有什么用呢？”丽贝卡答道。“你在陷害一个无辜的女人和丧失你的富贵荣华之间，已经作出了选择。现在再谈论它们的得失有什么意思？你已经决定了。” “不，丽贝卡，”骑士说，声调温柔了一些，向她走近了几步，“我还没有作出选择；请你注意，我没有，要作出选择的是你。如果我走上比武场，我必须维护我在武艺上的声誉；那么，不论你找到了斗士没有，你都得给烈焰吞没，死在火堆上，因为世界上还没有一个骑士可以与我匹敌或超过我，除了狮心工理查和他的宠臣艾文荷，可是艾文荷，你知道得很清楚，他还不能穿盔甲，而理查还关在国外的牢房中。总之，如果我上场，你便得死，哪怕你的姿色打动了一个不知天高地厚的小伙子，愿意为你决斗也没有用。” “你反反复复这么讲，有什么意义？”丽贝卡说。 “意义很大，”圣殿骑士答道，“因为你必须懂得，怎样从各方面来考虑你的命运。” “好吧，那就请你翻到挂毯的反面，让我看看是怎么回事吧，”犹太姑娘说。 “如果我走进了那个不幸的比武场，你得到的便是缓慢而悲惨的死，这种痛苦据说是到了阴司也不能解脱的。但是如果我不上场，我就会身败名裂，被指责为遭到巫术蛊惑，与邪教徒同流合污的人；我的显赫名声会使这些谣言变本加厉，成为一种咒骂和低毁。我失去声望，失去荣誉，失去了连帝王也难以相比的伟大前途；我只得牺牲我的远大抱负，让我苦心经营的计划化为乌有——据说异教徒曾想建造通往天堂的梯子，这计划便是我的梯子，现在这一切都付之东流了。然而，丽贝卡，” 他又说，跪到了她的脚下，“我愿意牺牲这一切，丢掉我的虚名，抛弃我已经到手了一半的权力，只要你说一声：“布瓦吉贝尔，我接受你作我的情人。” “不要痴心妄想吧，骑士先生，”丽贝卡答道，“你不如赶快去找摄政王，找王太后，找约翰亲王；为了英国王室的荣誉，他们不会允许你们的大宗师这么胡闹。这样，你既可以保护我，也不必牺牲你自己，或者要求我作出任何报答了。” “我不跟那些人打交道，”他继续说，抓住了她的衣据，“我只想求你一个人；什么能抵得上你的选择呢？你考虑一下吧，就算我是魔鬼，然而死更可怕；你只能在死和我之间作出选择。” “我不想对这些不幸进行比较，”而贝卡说，不敢激怒那个狂热的骑士，然而也决定不再容忍他的胡言乱语，不再与他假意敷衍。“请你做一个正直的人，像一个真正的基督徒！如果你的信仰确实还让你保留着一点善心，不仅在嘴上这么讲，也在行动上这么做，要从可怕的死亡中拯救我，那就不必要求任何报答，使你的宽宏大量变成卑鄙的交易。” “不，姑娘！”骄傲的骑士说，跳了起来，“你这些道理骗不了我；如果我抛弃现在的名声和未来的野心，那么这是为你抛弃的，然后我们便得一起出走。听我说，丽贝卡，”他继续道，声音又温柔了一些，“英国和欧洲不是整个世界。我们有不少地方可去，那是个广阔的天地，甚至可以满足我的野心。我们可以前往巴勒斯坦，那里的蒙特塞拉特侯爵康拉德是我的朋友，他像我一样自由自在，不把那些束缚我们天生的自由思想的糊涂观念放在眼里；我们也可以与萨拉丁合作，这比受我们瞧不起的那些顽固分子的气还好一些。我要为远大的前途开辟新的道路，”他继续说，又迈着大步在屋内走了起来，“欧洲会听到，从它的家中给赶走的一个儿子的响亮脚步声！它派出的十字军屠杀了千百万人，也不能保住巴勒斯坦；萨拉森人的千万把军刀，也不能在各国争夺的那块土地上建立自己的地盘；只有我和我那些不顾老顽固的阻挠，追随我出生入死的弟兄们，凭我们的力量和计谋，才能在那里建立起一个王国。到那时，丽贝卡，你便是王后；我凭我的勇敢，要为你在加尔默罗山上建立起一座王宫，我要用我长期盼望的骑士团的权杖换取一个国王的权力！” “这是梦想，”丽贝卡说，“夜里想入非非的结果，何况即使这是真的，我也毫不动心。够了，你可能取得的权力，我根本不想分享；再说，家乡或宗教信仰对我说来，不是可有可无的，愿意拿这些东西作交易的人，不会得到我的尊敬；为了一个异族女子，不惜胡作非为，放纵情欲，把他宣誓参加的骑士团也置之不顾的人，也不会得到我的信任。骑士先生，不要为搭救我索取代价，不要把一个慷慨的行为当作商品出售，扶助弱者应该是出于善良的爱心，而不是出于自私的动机。去找英国的国王吧；理查会听取我对那些残忍的人的申诉的。” “这绝对不成，丽贝卡！”圣殿骑士咬牙切齿地说。“如果我抛弃我的骑士团，那是为你抛弃的；既然你拒绝我的爱，那么我仍保留着我的野心；我不会让任何人愚弄我。要我向理查低头？——向这颗傲慢的心乞求恩典？丽贝卡，我永远不会让圣殿骑士团由于我的缘故，拜倒在他的脚下。我可以抛弃骑士团，但我决不会贬低它，出卖它。” “那么我只能祈求上帝的保佑了，”丽贝卡说，“因为人的搭救已几乎没有指望了！” “确实这样，”圣殿骑士说道，“因为尽管你这么高傲，你会发现我也与你同样高傲。如果我端起长枪进入比武场，我便会不顾一切，使出我的全部力量进行决斗。想想你那时的命运吧——你会像罪恶滔天的犯人一样死在可怕的烈火中——你会给熊熊燃烧的烈焰所吞没——你会化成一堆灰，化成构成我们神奇生命的各种元素 ——你的美好容貌从此消失得无影无踪，谁也不会相信这是一个曾经生活过和行动过的人！丽贝卡，这不是一个女人所能忍受的前景，你还是接受我的要求好。” “布瓦吉贝尔，”犹太姑娘答道，“你不了解女人的心，或者你接触过的只是那些丧失了最高尚的感情的女人。我告诉你，骄傲的圣殿骑士，你在最激烈的战斗中表现过你所夸耀的勇气，但这与女人为了爱情或责任，自愿忍受痛苦的勇气，是不能相比的。我自己是一个女人，是在温柔和爱护中长大的，我天然惧怕危险，不能忍受痛苦；可是我们走进那片决定生死的比武场时，你是去战斗的，我却是去受苦的，我感到我充满自信，我相信我的勇气会大大超过你的。再见，我不想再为你浪费唇舌；雅各的女儿留在世上的时间需要用在别的方面，她必须寻找安慰者(注)，他可能不让他的人民看到他的脸，但凡是真心诚意寻找他，向他呼吁的人，他的耳朵是一定会听到的。” -------- (注)指圣灵，其实这是基督教的概念，《圣经》中译为保惠师，《约翰福音》第14章第26节：“耶稣回答说……保惠师就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，他要将一切的事指教你们……” “那么我们就这么分手吗？”圣殿骑士停了一会说道，“老天爷应该根本不让我们见面，或者让你生在高贵的基督徒的家庭中！不，我的天哪！在我望着你的时候，在我想到我们下一次是在什么时候，什么地方会面的时候，我甚至希望我自己也是你那个屈辱的民族中的一员，我的手是与银钱账目打交道，不是与矛和盾打交道的。我的头得在每个小贵族面前垂下，我的目光只能使破产的债务人发抖和害怕——是的，我宁可这样，丽贝卡，使我可以在生活中接近你，避免我对你的死所必须承担的可怕责任。” “你所说的犹太人的这种情形，是你这类人的迫害造成的，”丽贝卡说道。“上帝在震怒中把他们驱逐出了自己的国家，但是勤劳给他们开辟了一条取得权力和影响的道路，这是压迫留给他们的唯一的一条路。请你读读上帝的选民的古代历史，告诉我，耶和华在各国用来显示奇迹的那些人，那时是不是守财奴和高利贷者！要知道，骄傲的骑士，我们可以举出不少人的名字，你们吹嘘的北方贵族与他们相比，不过是蓖麻之于松柏而” 已——他们的名字可以追溯到那个遥远的古代，那时神圣的耶和华君临在两个小天使雕像之间的施恩座(注)上；他们的光辉并非来自人间的君主，而是来自耶和华的威严声音，这声音命令他们的祖先站在离他最近的地方。这就是犹太人的祖先。” -------- (注)指上帝的宝座，《旧约·出埃及记》第25章：“耶和华晓谕摩西说……要用精金作施恩座，要用金子锤出两个（口基）（口路）啪来，安在施恩座的两头……我要在那里与你相会……（口基）（口路）啪即有翅膀的小天使。 丽贝卡在夸耀犹太民族古代的光荣时，兴奋得脸上泛起了红晕，但接着红潮消退了，她叹了口气：“现在这都过去了，不再有了！犹太人遭到了蹂躏，成了被摧残的青草，与路上的泥土混合在一起。然而他们中间仍有不甘辱没他们的祖先的人，阿多尼康之子以撒的女儿便是其中的一个！再见！我并不羡慕你靠鲜血染红的荣誉，也不羡慕你北方异教徒的野蛮出身；我不羡慕你的信仰，它永远只停留在你的嘴上，但从未进入你的心中，也从未表现在你的行动上。” “我的天，我真是给魔法迷住了！”布瓦吉贝尔说。“我快相信那个老糊涂的话啦，我对你这么恋恋不舍是受了迷惑，不是自然的。”他靠近了她一些，但十分恭敬，又道：“这么漂亮的一个人！这么年轻，这么美丽，这么不怕死！可是注定要死了，要在耻辱和痛苦中死了。谁能不为你啼哭呢？眼泪与这些眼皮已阔别了二十年，可是在我看着你的时候，它们又回来了。然而死已经不可避免——什么也不能挽救你的生命了。你和我只是不可抗拒的命运手中的盲目工具，它驱赶着我们，像暴风雨吹打着两只美好的船，要它们互相撞击，最后同归于尽。那么请原谅我吧，至少让我们像朋友一样分手吧。我想改变你的决定，但办不到，我的又像命运的铁的指令一样不可改变。” “人就是这样，把自己放荡的情欲造成的后果归咎于命运，”丽贝卡说。“但是我原谅你，布瓦吉贝尔，尽管你是我过早离开人世的罪魁祸首。你的铁石心肠虽然有时也会闪过一些高尚的思想，但它是一片懒汉的花园，遍地的野草在那里扼杀了美好和健全的花木。” “是的，”圣殿骑士答道，“丽贝卡，正如你所说的，我是一个没有教养、桀骜不驯的人；我所引以自豪的只是钢铁一般的坚强意志，它使我在大批愚昧的傻瓜和狡诈的顽固分子之间显得高人一等。我从年轻时起，便是一个战争的孩子，并且怀有极高的抱负，坚定不移地要达到我的目的。现在我也只能是这样一个人——骄傲，不可改变，不可屈服，这是世界可以证明的。但是，丽贝卡，你宽恕我吗？” “是的，像受害者宽恕刽子手一样宽恕你。” “那么，再见，”圣殿骑士说，走出了屋子。 艾伯特会督已等得不耐烦了，他是在隔壁屋里等布瓦吉贝尔回来。 “你拖得太久，简直使我有些坐立不安了，”他说，“万一大宗师或者他的坐探康拉德来了，叫我怎么办？我为了迁就你，已吃够了苦头。但是，兄弟，你哪里不舒服呀？你走路摇摇晃晃的，一副愁眉苦脸的样子。布瓦吉贝尔，你究竟怎么啦？” “唉，”圣殿骑士答道，“我觉得自己像一小时内就要处死的囚徒一样。不过，说真的，还不如囚徒，因为我发现，有的人处在这种状况，会像丢掉一件衣服那样走向死亡。老天作证，马尔沃辛，那个小姑娘几乎使我失去了做人的勇气。我简直想去找大宗师，当面向他声明退出骑士团，拒绝他强迫我接受的残暴使命。” “你疯了，”马尔沃辛说，“真的，你可能因此彻底葬送了自己，却丝毫也不能挽救这个犹太姑娘的生命，尽管你把她的生命看得那么宝贵。博马诺会另派一人执行他的判决，犯人会同样被处死，就像你执行这任务一样。” “这是虚伪的，我要亲自为她进行决斗，”圣殿骑士傲慢地回答。“如果那样，马尔沃辛，你可以相信，这骑士团内没有一个人是我的对手，他们都得在我的枪尖前面滚下马背。” “对，但你忘记了，”狡猾的参谋答道，“你既没有时间，也没有机会执行这个疯狂的计划。你去找卢加斯·博马诺试试，你对他说你要抛弃你的誓约，你看看，那个专横的老头子会让你有多长时间的自由。你的话一出口，你就会给丢进会堂中一百英尺下面的地牢，作为一个变节的骑士受到审判；或者，如果他仍认为你遭到了魔法的蛊惑，你便会给送到一个遥远的修道院中，给锁在黑暗的小屋子里，睡在草堆上，让人给你念经驱鬼，朝你身上浇圣水，直到控制你的恶魔离开你为止。你必须参加比武，布里恩，否则你就得身败名裂，永无出头之日。” “我会逃走，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“逃到一个遥远的地方，一个还没有受到疯狂和愚昧的宗教观念毒害的地方。我决不允许这个纯洁美好的少女，为了我的缘故流掉一滴血。” “你逃不了，”会督说，“你的胡言乱语已引起了怀疑，不会让你离开会堂。你不妨试试，走到大门口，命令放下吊桥，看看你会得到什么回答。我的话使你吃惊，你感到委屈，但这对你难道不是更好吗？哪怕你逃了出去，最后仍会被反绑着双手押回城堡，徒然给你的祖先带来羞辱，使你的地位一落千丈。你想想吧。如果圣殿骑士团中最出色的骑士布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔被宣布为变节分子，那时叫你的老朋友们把脸往哪儿搁啊？这会在法国朝廷引起多大的震动！目空一切的理查听到，这个巴勒斯坦与他作对的、几乎使他的声名黯然失色的骑士，竟然为了一个犹太姑娘弄得名誉扫地，而且在作出了重大牺牲之后，仍未能挽回她的生命，他又会多么高兴！” “马尔沃辛，”骑士说，“我感谢你，你触及了我内心深处最使我激动的一根弦！不管发生什么，变节分子的罪名永远不会落到布瓦吉贝尔的头上。不论理查，或者他那些自命不凡的喽罗中的任何一个，敢走进这个比武场，正是我求之不得的！但是他们不敢来，没有人会为了一个遭到唾弃的犹太女子冒生命危险，与我决斗。” “如果真的这样，这对你更好，”会督说。“因为没有一个斗士上场，你便可对这个不幸女子的死不负任何责任，这是大宗师的判决，一切指责都得由他承担，可是在他看来，这种指责只是对他的赞美和歌颂。” “确实，”布瓦吉贝尔说，“如果没有斗士上场，我只是那个壮丽场面的一个摆设，尽管在比武场上我是骑在马上的，但我对接着而来的一切不负任何责任。” “丝毫责任也没有，”马尔沃辛说，“就像游行队伍中全副武装的圣乔治画像一样。” “对，我得恢复我的决心，”傲慢的骑士答道。“她瞧不起我，拒绝了我，辱骂了我，为什么我还要为她牺牲我在别人心目中享有的威望呢？马尔沃辛，我决定参加决斗。” 他讲了这些话，便匆匆走出了屋子，会督跟在他后面，继续监视和鼓励他的决定；因为即使不考虑蒙特菲舍答应在处死不幸的丽贝卡以后，给予他的提升机会，布瓦吉贝尔的名声对他也关系重大，有朝一日他当上骑士团的头头后，他可以指望得到不少好处。然而尽管他在压制他的朋友较好的感情方面，凭他狡猾、冷漠、自私的性格，对一个正处在激烈思想斗争中的人掌握着一切有利条件，为了使布瓦吉贝尔坚定地履行他说服他采取的决定，马尔沃辛还是需要用尽一切手腕的。他必须密切监视他，防止他的逃跑意图死灰复燃，必须隔断他与大宗师的接触，免得他走上与他的上司公开决裂的一步，还必须一再向他重申各种理由，尽量让他明白，他这次出现在比武场上，既不是要加快，也不是要促成丽贝卡的悲剧命运，只是因为这是从贬黜和屈辱中拯救他自己的唯一道路。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2701.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷
