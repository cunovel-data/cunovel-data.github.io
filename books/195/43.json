{"id":6134,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"All hail to the lordlings of high degree, Who live not more happy, though greater than we! Our pastimes to see, Under every green tree, In all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be. Macdonald\\n\\n The new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph\u0027s palfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight\u0027s own war-horse. The astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in the little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less surprised to see Richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue therefore for a prince. He hesitated whether to address the King as the Black Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards him. Richard saw his embarrassment.\\n\\n \"Fear not, Wilfred,\" he said, \"to address Richard Plantagenet as himself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts, although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm English blood.\"\\n\\n \"Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\" said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward, \"my assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer subjects than those who now stand around him.\"\\n\\n \"I cannot doubt it, brave man,\" said Wilfred, \"since thou art of the number---But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain men, and the bloody armour of my Prince?\"\\n\\n \"Treason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,\" said the King; \"but, thanks to these brave men, treason hath met its meed---But, now I bethink me, thou too art a traitor,\" said Richard, smiling; \"a most disobedient traitor; for were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst repose thyself at Saint Botolph\u0027s until thy wound was healed?\"\\n\\n \"It is healed,\" said Ivanhoe; \"it is not of more consequence than the scratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex the hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely journeys and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that of a mere knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and sword may procure him?\"\\n\\n \"And Richard Plantagenet,\" said the King, \"desires no more fame than his good lance and sword may acquire him---and Richard Plantagenet is prouder of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his good arm to speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand armed men.\"\\n\\n \"But your kingdom, my Liege,\" said Ivanhoe, \"your kingdom is threatened with dissolution and civil war---your subjects menaced with every species of evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which it is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this moment narrowly escaped.\"\\n\\n \"Ho! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?\" answered Richard, impatiently; \"I tell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing to repay my follies in kind---For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king a homily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has most reason to upbraid the other?---Yet forgive me, my faithful Wilfred. The time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I explained to thee at Saint Botolph\u0027s, necessary to give my friends and faithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richard\u0027s return is announced, he should be at the head of such a force as enemies shall tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason, without even unsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong enough to move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must have news of Salisbury from the south; and of Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of Multon and Percy in the north. The Chancellor must make sure of London. Too sudden an appearance would subject me to dangers, other than my lance and sword, though backed by the bow of bold Robin, or the quarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may be able to rescue me from.\"\\n\\n Wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master upon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it was unpardonable in him to have sought out. The young knight sighed, therefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having silenced his counsellor, though his heart acknowledged the justice of the charge he had brought against him, went on in conversation with Robin Hood.---\"King of Outlaws,\" he said, \"have you no refreshment to offer to your brother sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me both in exercise and appetite.\"\\n\\n \"In troth,\" replied the Outlaw, \"for I scorn to lie to your Grace, our larder is chiefly supplied with---\" He stopped, and was somewhat embarrassed.\\n\\n \"With venison, I suppose?\" said Richard, gaily; \"better food at need there can be none---and truly, if a king will not remain at home and slay his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it killed to his hand.\"\\n\\n \"If your Grace, then,\" said Robin, \"will again honour with your presence one of Robin Hood\u0027s places of rendezvous, the venison shall not be lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good wine, to relish it withal.\"\\n\\n The Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch, more happy, probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his foresters, than he would have been in again assuming his royal state, and presiding over a splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in society and adventure were the zest of life to Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and it had its highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered and surmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless character, of a knight of romance, was in a great measure realized and revived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of arms, was far more dear to his excited imagination, than that which a course of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government. Accordingly, his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid meteor, which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an unnecessary and portentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by universal darkness; his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards and minstrels, but affording none of those solid benefits to his country on which history loves to pause, and hold up as an example to posterity. But in his present company Richard showed to the greatest imaginable advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of manhood in every rank of life.\\n\\n Beneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the King of England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who now formed his court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough foresters soon lost their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song and the jest were exchanged ---the stories of former deeds were told with advantage; and at length, and while boasting of their successful infraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in presence of their natural guardian. The merry King, nothing heeding his dignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among the jolly band. The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be desirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to disturb its harmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe\u0027s brow clouded with anxiety. \"We are honoured,\" he said to Ivanhoe, apart, \"by the presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he dallied with time, which the circumstances of his kingdom may render precious.\"\\n\\n \"It is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,\" said Wilfred, apart; \"and know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest mood are but toying with the lion\u0027s whelp, which, on slight provocation, uses both fangs and claws.\"\\n\\n \"You have touched the very cause of my fear,\" said the Outlaw; \"my men are rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as good-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how warmly it may be received---it is time this revel were broken off.\"\\n\\n \"It must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,\" said Ivanhoe; \"for each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to prolong it.\"\\n\\n \"Must I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?\" said Robin Hood, pausing for all instant; \"but by Saint Christopher, it shall be so. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.---Here, Scathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a Norman blast on thy bugle, and without an instant\u0027s delay on peril of your life.\"\\n\\n Scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the revellers were startled by the sound of his horn.\\n\\n \"It is the bugle of Malvoisin,\" said the Miller, starting to his feet, and seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his quarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook himself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.\\n\\n Men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet to the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of pleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his armour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on, he laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest displeasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was approaching.\\n\\n \"Thou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,---and I have seen it. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his friend and liegeman.\"\\n\\n In the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in different directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw the company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now completely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his Sovereign.\\n\\n \"For what, good yeoman?\" said Richard, somewhat impatiently. \"Have we not already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions? Thinkest thou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between us? Thou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that time?\"\\n\\n \"Ay, but I have though,\" answered the yeoman, \"if it be an offence to deceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard was none of Malvoisin\u0027s, but blown by my direction, to break off the banquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus dallied with.\"\\n\\n He then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner rather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the King,---like one who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is confident in the rectitude of his motive. The blood rushed in anger to the countenance of Richard; but it was the first transient emotion, and his sense of justice instantly subdued it.\\n\\n \"The King of Sherwood,\" he said, \"grudges his venison and his wine-flask to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!---but when you come to see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art right, however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and away---Wilfred has been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a friend in thy band, who, not content with advising, will needs direct thy motions, and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for thyself?\"\\n\\n \"Such a one,\" said Robin, \"is my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even now absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I will own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom of his councils---but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with one who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master\u0027s service.\"\\n\\n \"Thou art right, good yeoman,\" answered Richard; \"and if I had Ivanhoe, on the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad gravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou thinkest my own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own will as any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.---But come, sirs, let us merrily on to Coningsburgh, and think no more on\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Robin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of the road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and apprize them of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would find the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receive such timely notice of the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of archers, with which he himself proposed to follow on the same route.\\n\\n The wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched Richard\u0027s feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain on account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him. He once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full pardon and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. But Richard\u0027s good intentions towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated by the King\u0027s untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was extorted from the unwilling hands of King John when he succeeded to his heroic brother. As for the rest of Robin Hood\u0027s career, as well as the tale of his treacherous death, they are to be found in those black-letter garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny,\\n\\n \"Now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.\"\\n\\n The Outlaw\u0027s opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe, Gurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the Castle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.\\n\\n There are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are presented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and gentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river, well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which, as its Saxon name implies, was, previous to the Conquest, a royal residence of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably been added by the Normans, but the inner keep bears token of very great antiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court, and forms a complete circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter. The wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge external buttresses which project from the circle, and rise up against the sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it. These massive buttresses are solid when they arise from the foundation, and a good way higher up; but are hollowed out towards the top, and terminate in a sort of turrets communicating with the interior of the keep itself. The distant appearance of this huge building, with these singular accompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the picturesque, as the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary, whose imagination it carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the vicinity of the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of the memorable Hengist; and various monuments, of great antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the neighbouring churchyard.*\\n\\n * Note J. Castle of Coningsburgh.\\n\\n When Coeur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately building, it was not, as at present, surrounded by external fortifications. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering the main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallation than a rude barrier of palisades.\\n\\n A huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced that the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being solemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceased\u0027s birth or quality, for armorial bearings were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry themselves and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the gate was another banner, on which the figure of a white horse, rudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the well-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.\\n\\n All around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased, but all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and consequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be observed in the fullest extent.\\n\\n Numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill on which the castle was situated; and when the King and his attendants entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space within presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the assemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set abroach, to be drained at the freedom of all comers. Groups of every description were to be seen devouring the food and swallowing the liquor thus abandoned to their discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense of his half-year\u0027s hunger and thirst, in one day of gluttony and drunkenness---the more pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his morsel with gust, or curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and the skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also be seen, distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not less so by their keeping together, and looking with great scorn on the whole solemnity, even while condescending to avail themselves of the good cheer which was so liberally supplied.\\n\\n Mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with strolling soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own account at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling mechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers, hedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering prayers, and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and rotes.*\\n\\n * The crowth, or crowd, was a species of violin. The rote a * sort of guitar, or rather hurdy-gurdy, the strings of * which were managed by a wheel, from which the instrument * took its name.\\n\\n One sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric; another, in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh names of his noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting, nor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of their profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons on these occasions were as natural as they were rude. If sorrow was thirsty, there was drink---if hungry, there was food---if it sunk down upon and saddened the heart, here were the means supplied of mirth, or at least of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves of those means of consolation, although, every now and then, as if suddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the men groaned in unison, while the females, of whom many were present, raised up their voices and shrieked for very woe.\\n\\n Such was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was entered by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned not to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually entering and withdrawing, unless so far as was necessary to preserve order; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the Monarch and Ivanhoe, more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were familiar to him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for such their dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a Saxon solemnity, and could not but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. And in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office, this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage of guests, thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of the tower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard, nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence should be required.\\n\\n \\n\\n 高贵的老爷们听我说，\\n\\n 你们地位虽高，却不如我们幸福！\\n\\n 来看看我们的娱乐吧，\\n\\n 在每一棵绿树荫下，\\n\\n 在每一片快活的林子中，我们都欢迎你们光临。\\n\\n 麦克唐纳(注)\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)亚历山大·麦克唐纳（1700—1770？），苏格兰高地诗人，用当地的盖尔语写作，因此在苏格兰以外，知道他的人不多；1751年他出版过一本盖尔语的诗集。\\n\\n 新来的是艾文荷的威尔弗莱德和葛四，前者骑在博多尔夫长老的小马上，后者却骑着骑士自己的战马。艾文荷发现他的主人身上尽是一点点血迹，刚才激战过的小小空地上横着六、七具尸体，不禁大吃一惊。他还发现，理查身边围着这么多人，从外表看都是绿林好汉，因此对君主而言自然是危险的扈从，这也叫他同样吃惊。他犹豫不决，不知是称呼他国王好，还是黑甲骑士好，也不知自己应该采取什么态度。理查看出了他的难处。\\n\\n “不用怕，威尔弗莱德，”他说，“称我金雀花王朝的理查好了；我周围的这些人都有着一颗真正的英国人的心，只是英国人的热血驱使他们偏离了一点正常的轨道。”\\n\\n “艾文荷的威尔弗莱德爵士，”英勇的首领走到前面说道，“我们的君主已说明了一切，我没有必要补充什么了；然而我仍想自豪地说一句，在多灾多难的人民中，谁也不会比现在站在他周围的那些人更忠诚了。”\\n\\n “这是我不能怀疑的，勇敢的壮士，”威尔弗莱德说，“因为你就是其中的一个。但是这些死亡和危险的标志——这些杀死的人和我的国王盔甲上的血迹，是怎么回事呢？”\\n\\n “叛逆来到了朕的身边，艾文荷，”国王说，“多亏这些英勇的健儿，叛逆才受到了应有的报应。不过现在我想起来了，你也是一个叛逆，”理查笑道，“一个不服从命令的叛逆；因为我给你的明确命令，是要你在圣博多尔夫隐修所中养病，直到伤势痊愈为止。”\\n\\n “我已经痊愈了，”艾文荷说，“现在只留下了一个小小的伤口，完全不碍事了。可是为什么——陛下，为什么您要折磨您的忠诚臣仆的心呢？您单枪匹马，长途跋涉，让您尊贵的生命历尽艰险，仿佛它的价值跟一个闯荡江湖的骑士的价值差不多，只是要凭一枝枪，一把剑，走遍天下锄强扶弱而已。”\\n\\n “金雀花王朝的理查除了凭他的枪和剑赢得名声以外，别无他求，”国王说。“金雀花王朝的理查觉得，单凭他的一把宝剑，一身膂力，出生入死取得的胜利，比率领千百名武士鏖战在沙场上，更值得自豪。”\\n\\n “但是您的王国，陛下，”艾文荷说，“您的王国正面临着瓦解和内战的威胁；您的臣民如果失去了他们的君主，便必然遭到各种恶势力的蹂躏，您怎么能一味单枪匹马，不顾危险，像刚才那场险遭不测的厮杀那样呢？”\\n\\n “嗬！嗬！我的王国和我的臣民！”理查不耐烦地答道，“我告诉你，威尔弗莱德爵士，他们中间最优秀的人也只知道像我一样蛮于呢。举例说，我最忠诚的巨仆艾文荷的威尔弗莱德，便不服从我的明确命令，还要教训他的国王，因为他不肯完全听从他的劝告。我们两人究竟谁有理由指责另一个呢？然而我忠诚的威尔弗莱德，请原谅我。这段时间我必须隐姓埋名的道理，我已在圣博多尔夫隐修所向你解释过，这是为了让我的朋友和忠于我的贵族有时间集结他们的军队，这样，理查回国的消息宣布时，他已拥有一支可以令敌人战栗的强大军队，甚至不必拔出我们的剑，便能叫他们低头认罪，放弃他们的叛逆意图。埃斯托特维尔和博亨在二十四小时内，还没有足够的力量进攻约克。我必须等待索尔兹伯里从南方，比彻姆从沃里克郡，马尔顿和帕西从北方给我送来的消息。我的首相必须把伦敦控制在手中。过于仓促的露面势必使我陷入危险，那就不是单靠勇敢的罗宾汉的弓箭，塔克修士的铁头木棍，汪八的号角作后盾，凭我的枪和剑便能立于不败之地了。”\\n\\n 威尔弗莱德垂下了头表示服从，他完全明白，跟这种狂热的骑士精神争论是没有用的，它常常使他的主人陷入危险，尽管那本来是可以轻易避免的，有时它甚至使他采取不可原谅的冒险做法。因此年轻的骑士叹了口气，不再作声。理查很高兴，终于让他的臣子免开尊口了，然而他的内心却承认，他对他的指责是正确的；于是他继续跟罗宾汉谈话。“绿林好汉的国王，”他说道，“你能向你的国王献上一些点心吗？因为这些死鬼害得我筋疲力尽，肚子也饿了。”\\n\\n “说真的，”壮士答道，“本来我还不好意思献给陛下呢，因为我们的干粮主要是……”他住口了，有些为难似的。\\n\\n “我想是鹿脯吧？”理查大喜道，“在肚子饿的时候，没有更好的食物了。如果一个国王不想待在国内，自己动手打猎，那么别人打了送到他手上，我想他是没有理由反对的。”\\n\\n “既然这样，就请陛下再次光临罗宾汉的一个集合地点吧，”罗宾汉说，“在那里非但不愁吃不到鹿脯，还能得到一大杯啤酒，甚至上好的葡萄酒，提高您的食欲呢。”\\n\\n 于是壮士在前面带路，国王兴高采烈跟在后面；这次得以遇到罗宾汉和他的绿林好汉，使他喜出望外，也许比重新登基，坐在王公大臣中间更加快活。新鲜的社会活动和冒险经历，是狮心王理查最大的乐趣，如果又遭逢了艰难险阻，那么对他说来，更是不同寻常，别有风味。在狮心王理查身上，传奇英雄光辉灿烂、不计利害的个性，得到了充分的体现和生动的表现；他耽于幻想，在他心目中，他个人凭武力取得的光荣，比他在国事上运筹帷幄、深谋远虑的决策，更为动人。因此他的统治像明亮而迅速的流星划破长空，光芒四射，但这只是一种多余的、惊人的奇观，顷刻之间便消失在无边的黑暗中了。他的骑士功绩成了民间歌手和行吟诗人的题材，但不能给他的国家带来任何实际利益，为历史提供值得回味思考，可以让后人效法的范例。但在目前这伙人中，理查真是如鱼得水，最大限度地满足了他的幻想。他天生乐观，性格开朗，喜欢接触每个阶层的生活。\\n\\n 在一棵高大的栎树下，招待英国国王的林中宴会一下子便安排好了；他周围的人对他的政府而言是不法之徒，但现在却构成了他的朝廷和卫队。随着酒壶的传递，那些粗犷的森林之子很快便对国王的在场失去了畏惧。唱歌和谈笑此起彼落，从前的事迹给讲得曲折离奇，引人入胜；最后，在夸耀各自的违法活动时，没有人还会想起，坐在他们面前的那个人正是法律的天然保卫者。国王也嘻嘻哈哈，跟这些伙伴一样，丝毫也不顾到他的尊严，与大家一起欢笑、喝酒、逗趣。罗宾汉虽然粗鲁，但天生的警惕心，使他希望这场戏快些结束，免得闹出乱子，尤其是他发现艾文荷的脸色有些担忧，于是偷偷向他说道：“国王的驾临使我们万分荣幸，然而他国事繁忙，过多的浪费时间恐怕不太合适。”\\n\\n “勇敢的罗宾汉，您明白事理，讲得很对，”威尔弗莱德轻声说，“要知道，跟国王说笑，哪怕在他心情最舒畅的时候，也好比跟一头小狮子玩耍，一不小心，它便会张牙舞爪向你扑来。”\\n\\n “您提到的正是我所担心的事，”壮士说。“我那些小伙子天性粗野，不懂规矩，国王虽然待人和气，但性情急躁；我觉得随时都可能发生不愉快的事，惹得国王生气，我看这场狂欢活动应该收场了。”\\n\\n “那只得仰仗您的大力了，勇敢的老乡，”艾文荷说道，“因为我要是想这么做，只能适得其反，他会反而拖延不走。”\\n\\n “难道我这么快就得冒开罪国王，失去他的欢心的危险吗？”罗宾汉说，一边考虑了一下。“不过凭圣克里斯托弗起誓，这是我应该做的。如果我不敢为了他冒这危险，我就不配得到他的恩宠。听着，斯卡洛克，你快跑到那片树丛背后，用你的号角吹一下诺曼人的号音，一刻也不能拖延，否则我一定严惩不贷。”\\n\\n 斯卡洛克立即照办，不到五分钟，那些饮酒作乐的人便听到了他的号\\n\\n “这是马尔沃辛的号角声，”磨坊老板说道，马上一跃而起，拿起了弓箭。修士也丢下酒壶，拿起了铁头木棍。汪八中止了他的说笑，跑去取他的剑和盾牌。所有的人都拿起了武器。\\n\\n 他们从事的危险生涯，使他们随时准备从喝酒转入战斗；然而对理查说来，这种转变只是欢乐的继续。他吩咐给他头盔，铠甲上那些最累赘的东西本来扔在一起，现在也拿来了；葛四给他披戴时，他向威尔弗莱德发出了严厉的命令，不准他抢先厮杀，否则决不饶他。\\n\\n “你已替我厮打了一百次，威尔弗莱德，我都看到了。今天请你站在一边，看理查怎么替他的朋友和巨子厮杀。”\\n\\n 就在这时，罗宾汉派出了几个部下，要他们分头侦察敌人的动向。当他看到酒筵已经收场，他的命令已经生效，于是他走近全身披挂的理查，单膝下跪，请他的陛下恕罪。\\n\\n “为什么，我的好首领？”理查说，有些不耐烦。“我不是已经答应宽恕你们的一切违法行为吗？你以为我的话这么不值钱，可以随口乱讲，又任意收回的吗？可是从那以后，你应该还没有时间犯新的罪吧？”\\n\\n “不，我已经犯了，”首领回答，“我犯了欺君之罪，但这是为了陛下的缘故。您听到的号音不是马尔沃辛的，那是我命令吹的，是为了让宴会停止，免得它占有您更多的宝贵时间。”\\n\\n 然后他站了起来，合抱着双手，神色主要是恭敬，不是畏怯，等待着国王的答复，就像一个人意识到他可能犯了错误，然而相信他的动机是无可非议的。理查有些发怒，脸涨红了，但这只是一刹那工夫，公正的意识立即占了上风。\\n\\n “舍伍德森林之王舍不得给英国国王吃他的鹿脯和美酒！”他说。“好吧，勇敢的罗宾汉！但是等你到快活的伦敦来见我的时候，我保证我这个主人不会像你那么小气。不过你做得对，我的好汉。我们还是骑上马走吧，威尔弗莱德早已等得不耐烦了。告诉我，勇敢的罗宾汉，你的部下中难道从没有过一个人，不仅要对你说三道四，还要直接干预你的行动，如果你不听他的，他便要哭丧着脸苦苦哀求吗？”\\n\\n “我也有这么一个人，”罗宾汉说，“那便是我的副官小约翰(注)，不过他此刻出远门到苏格兰边境去了。我向陛下承认，我有时对他的胡言乱语也很恼火，但再一想，他没有别的动机，只是出于一片忠心，我便不能生气了。”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)这也是罗宾汉故事中的一个重要人物，据说原名叫约翰·奈洛，司各特在另一部小说《十字军英雄记》中写到过他。\\n\\n “你做得对，好庄户人，”理查答道。“如果我有艾文荷站在一边，老是哭丧着脸，皱起眉头，向我直言谏劝，有你在另一边，据说为了我好跟我耍花招，那么我就像基督教世界或异教徒世界中的任何一个国王那样，毫无自由可言了。但是现在，让我们快快活活地前往科宁斯堡，不必再谈这些了。”\\n\\n 罗宾汉告诉他们，他已派出一支小分队，在他们经过的路上进行侦察，一旦发现任何埋伏，马上会通知他们；他相信，他们能安全抵达科宁斯堡，万一有事，他们会得到及时的警报，然后可以马上折回，因为他会率领一队精锐的弓箭手沿着同一路线接应他们。\\n\\n 为国王的安全所作的这些周密而细心的部署，深深感动了理查，他对那位首领为了骗他动身玩弄的小花招，本来可能还有一点嫌怨，现在彻底消除了。他再一次向罗宾汉伸出了手，请他相信他完全宽恕了他，今后还要广施恩泽，因为他已下定决心，限制森林法和其他专制法规的残暴措施，免得它们把许多英国农民逼上绝路，铤而走险。不过理查向勇敢的首领表示的善良意愿，后来由于国王的过早晏驾，未能实现；约翰作为他英勇的哥哥的继承人登基之后，也只是出于无奈，勉强签署了森林宪章(注)。至于罗宾汉一生的其他事迹，以及他遭到暗害致死的故事，都可以在黑体字印制的廉价的民间故事和通俗歌谣中找到，它们\\n\\n 售价便宜，内容却像黄金般珍贵。\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)理查于1199年去世，由其弟约翰（即本书中的约翰亲王）继位，约翰与理查完全不同，阴险多疑，不得人心，1215年被迫接受贵族提出的大宪章，其中对王室的森林作了限制。次年约翰去世，其于亨利三世继位，年仅九岁，又于次年（121年）在大宪章的基础上正式签署了森林宪章。\\n\\n 首领的预见是正确的，国王在艾文荷、葛四和汪八的陪伴下，一路平安，太阳还没落下地平线的时候，科宁斯堡已经在望了。\\n\\n 这个撒克逊古老城堡周围那种优美动人的景色，在英国是很少见到的。平静的唐河潺潺流动，从一片环形盆地上穿过，那里田园和茂盛的树木交织在一起；一片高地从河边升起，古老的城堡便矗立在山丘顶上，四周是坚固的围墙和壕沟。从它的撒克逊名称看来，它早在诺曼人征服英国以前即已存在，曾作过英国几代国王的离宫。外面的围墙大概是诺曼人增建的，但里边的主楼带有十分古老的特征。它位在内院一角的土岗上，构成了整整一个圆圈，直径大约二十五英尺。墙非常厚，四周有六个大扶壁拱卫着，它们突出在圆圈之外，沿着塔楼的各边建造，似乎是为了加固或支撑墙壁。这些厚实的扶壁是实心的，从地基升起，比主楼高出了许多；但它们的顶部却是空心的，形成了塔楼似的东西，可以通往主楼内部。这个雄伟的建筑物，连同那些独特的扶壁，从远处看，外表也是引人入胜的，正如城堡的内部可以满足考古家的兴趣，把他们的想象力带到遥远的七国时代一样。离城堡不远有一个古墓，据说这便是令人怀念的亨吉斯特的陵寝；在附近的墓地还有各种碑碣，都非常古老和奇特。(注)\\n\\n --------\\n\\n (注)见作者附注十。——原注\\n\\n 当狮心王和他的随从来到这简陋而庄严的建筑物时，它还不像现在这样，周围没有那些外堡。当时撒克逊建筑师的全部本领只是把主楼的墙壁造得坚固结实，它的周围也没有城墙，只有一道粗糙的木栅。\\n\\n 城堡顶上升起了一面大黑旗，由此可见，为它故世的主人举行的丧礼还在进行。它没有表明死者家世或身分的符号，因为纹章标记那时在诺曼骑士中还是一种新事物，在撒克逊人中更是根本还没有。但是在大门上空飘扬着另一面旗子，旗上画着一匹简陋的白马，这是亨吉斯特和他的撒克逊武士们的著名标记，它表明了死者的民族和身分。\\n\\n 城堡周围是一片热闹忙乱的景象，因为这类丧宴总是铺张浪费，讲究排场的，不仅与死者沾点亲戚关系的人，连过路的旅客，也会给邀请入席。故世的阿特尔斯坦既是财主，又有地位，遇到这种事，自然会办得格外隆重。\\n\\n 这样，城堡所在的那座小山上，上上下下的人络绎不绝；外面那道屏障的大门敞开着，没人守卫，国王和他的随从进去之后，他们看到的那片空地上的景象，却与正在举办的丧事很不相称。在一个地方，厨子们正忙于烤煮大公牛和肥山羊；在另一个地方，一桶桶啤酒正在钻洞，好让客人自由取用。形形色色的人群都忙于吃喝，狼吞虎咽，消耗着大量的食物和酒。赤膊的撒克逊农奴似乎要靠一天的饱餐和痛饮，解除半年的饥渴；生活较优裕的市民和工匠，津津有味地品尝着各自的食物，或者精细地评判着麦酒的浓度和酿造的技术。客人中也可以看到几个较穷的诺曼绅士，这是不难识别的，他们的下巴都剃得光光的，穿着短外套，而且单独聚集在一起，对整个丧礼露出了不屑一顾的神色，尽管为了这顿丰盛的饮食，他们只得纡尊降贵，前来观礼。\\n\\n 当然，要饭的花子汇集在这儿的，也有二、三十个；还有从巴勒斯坦回来的（至少据他们自己说）散兵游勇；小贩在叫卖他们的货物，流浪的手艺人在寻找雇主；周游四方的朝圣者和术士，撒克逊行吟诗人和威尔士民间歌手，有的在轻轻念祷告，有的用竖琴、小提琴或六弦琴，弹唱着走调的挽歌。一个人用悲戚的声音在为阿特尔斯坦唱赞歌，另一个编了撒克逊谱系诗篇，背诵着他高贵祖先那些诘屈聱牙的名字。这里还有讲笑话的和变戏法的，谁也不觉得他们在这场合卖艺有什么不合适，或者不合礼节。确实，撒克逊人对丧事的观念是粗野的，也是自然的。如果吊丧的人渴了，这里有的是酒，如果饿了，这里有的是食物；如果他们过于伤心，情绪低落，这里有的是提供乐趣、至少是散心解闷的办法。哪怕办丧事的，偶尔也会来凑凑热闹，快活一下，只是他们有时好像突然想起了到这儿来的原因，于是男人便会一起长吁短叹，为数众多的女人也会蓦地扯开嗓子，尖声号哭起来。\\n\\n 理查和他的随从进入科宁斯堡时，院子里的情形便是这样。下等客人经常在进进出出，执事或管家除非出于维持秩序的必要，一般不屑过问；然而国王和艾文荷的堂堂仪表，使他不能不另眼相看，尤其是后者的相貌，他觉得似曾相识，不得不加倍留意。何况从装扮看，他们都是骑士，两个骑士的同时光临，对撒克逊人家的丧礼而言是罕见的，是死者和他的家族的特殊荣誉。于是这位身穿丧服、手持白色权杖的重要家人，立刻挤过五光十色的众多宾客，把理查和艾文荷带到了主楼的人口处。至于葛四和汪八，他们一进院子，便遇到了几个熟人，因此在奉到正式召唤以前，已不想再往前走了。\\n\\n
