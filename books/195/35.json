{"id":6126,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 33","content":"------Flower of warriors, How is\u0027t with Titus Lartius? MARCIUS.--As with a man busied about decrees, Condemning some to death and some to exile, Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other. Coriolanus The captive Abbot\u0027s features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture of offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror. \"Why, how now, my masters?\" said he, with a voice in which all three emotions were blended. \"What order is this among ye? Be ye Turks or Christians, that handle a churchman?---Know ye what it is, \u0027manus imponere in servos Domini\u0027? Ye have plundered my mails---torn my cope of curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!---Another in my place would have been at his \u0027excommunicabo vos\u0027; but I am placible, and if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore my mails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in masses at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no venison until next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of this mad frolic.\" \"Holy Father,\" said the chief Outlaw, \"it grieves me to think that you have met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your fatherly reprehension.\" \"Usage!\" echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan leader; \"it were usage fit for no hound of good race ---much less for a Christian---far less for a priest---and least of all for the Prior of the holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken minstrel, called Allan-a-Dale---\u0027nebulo quidam\u0027---who has menaced me with corporal punishment---nay, with death itself, an I pay not down four hundred crowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already robbed me of---gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value; besides what is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my pouncer-box and silver crisping-tongs.\" \"It is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your reverend bearing,\" replied the Captain. \"It is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,\" said the Prior; \"he swore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up on the highest tree in the greenwood.\" \"Did he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had better comply with his demands---for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to abide by his word when he has so pledged it.\" * * A commissary is said to have received similar consolation * from a certain Commander-in-chief, to whom he complained * that a general officer had used some such threat towards * him as that in the text. \"You do but jest with me,\" said the astounded Prior, with a forced laugh; \"and I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when the mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the morning.\" \"And I am as grave as a father confessor,\" replied the Outlaw; \"you must pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be called to a new election; for your place will know you no more.\" \"Are ye Christians,\" said the Prior, \"and hold this language to a churchman?\" \"Christians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,\" answered the Outlaw. \"Let our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound to this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.\" The Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar\u0027s frock over his green cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning he had acquired by rote in former days, \"Holy father,\" said he, \"\u0027Deus faciat salvam benignitatem vestram\u0027 ---You are welcome to the greenwood.\" \"What profane mummery is this?\" said the Prior. \"Friend, if thou be\u0027st indeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I may escape from these men\u0027s hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a morris-dancer.\" \"Truly, reverend father,\" said the Friar, \"I know but one mode in which thou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew\u0027s day with us, we are taking our tithes.\" \"But not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?\" said the Prior. \"Of church and lay,\" said the Friar; \"and therefore, Sir Prior \u0027facite vobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis\u0027---make yourselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve your turn.\" \"I love a jolly woodsman at heart,\" said the Prior, softening his tone; \"come, ye must not deal too hard with me---I can well of woodcraft, and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings again---Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.\" \"Give him a horn,\" said the Outlaw; \"we will prove the skill he boasts of.\" The Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head. \"Sir Prior,\" he said, \"thou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom thee---we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight\u0027s shield hath it, to set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee---thou art one of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the ancient English bugle notes.---Prior, that last flourish on the recheat hath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old manly blasts of venerie.\" \"Well, friend,\" said the Abbot, peevishly, \"thou art ill to please with thy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my ransom. At a word---since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the devil---what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without having fifty men at my back?\" \"Were it not well,\" said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the Captain, \"that the Prior should name the Jew\u0027s ransom, and the Jew name the Prior\u0027s?\" \"Thou art a mad knave,\" said the Captain, \"but thy plan transcends!---Here, Jew, step forth---Look at that holy Father Aymer, Prior of the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we should hold him?---Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrant thee.\" \"O, assuredly,\" said Isaac. \"I have trafficked with the good fathers, and bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much wool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and drink the sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx. Ah, if an outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by the year and by the month, I would pay much gold and silver to redeem my captivity.\" \"Hound of a Jew!\" exclaimed the Prior, \"no one knows better than thy own cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the finishing of our chancel---\" \"And for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due allowance of Gascon wine,\" interrupted the Jew; \"but that ---that is small matters.\" \"Hear the infidel dog!\" said the churchman; \"he jangles as if our holy community did come under debts for the wines we have a license to drink, \u0027propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum\u0027. The circumcised villain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men listen and rebuke him not!\" \"All this helps nothing,\" said the leader.---\"Isaac, pronounce what he may pay, without flaying both hide and hair.\" \"An six hundred crowns,\" said Isaac, \"the good Prior might well pay to your honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.\" \"Six hundred crowns,\" said the leader, gravely; \"I am contented ---thou hast well spoken, Isaac---six hundred crowns.---It is a sentence, Sir Prior.\" \"A sentence!---a sentence!\" exclaimed the band; \"Solomon had not done it better.\" \"Thou hearest thy doom, Prior,\" said the leader. \"Ye are mad, my masters,\" said the Prior; \"where am I to find such a sum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx, I shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose that I go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows* * Borghs, or borrows, signifies pledges. Hence our word to * borrow, because we pledge ourselves to restore what is * lent. my two priests.\" \"That will be but blind trust,\" said the Outlaw; \"we will retain thee, Prior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a cup of wine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft, thou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.\" \"Or, if so please you,\" said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the outlaws, \"I can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of certain monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will grant me a quittance.\" \"He shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,\" said the Captain; \"and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as well as for thyself.\" \"For myself! ah, courageous sirs,\" said the Jew, \"I am a broken and impoverished man; a beggar\u0027s staff must be my portion through life, supposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.\" \"The Prior shall judge of that matter,\" replied the Captain. ---\"How say you, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?\" \"Can he afford a ransom?\" answered the Prior \"Is he not Isaac of York, rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who were led into Assyrian bondage?---I have seen but little of him myself, but our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report says that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame in any Christian land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that such gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the state, and even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and extortions.\" \"Hold, father,\" said the Jew, \"mitigate and assuage your choler. I pray of your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no one. But when churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come knocking to Isaac\u0027s door, they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil terms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter, and our day shall be truly kept, so God sa\u0027 me?---and Kind Isaac, if ever you served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day comes, and I ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse of Egypt on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil populace against poor strangers!\" \"Prior,\" said the Captain, \"Jew though he be, he hath in this spoken well. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without farther rude terms.\" \"None but \u0027latro famosus\u0027---the interpretation whereof,\" said the Prior, \"will I give at some other time and tide---would place a Christian prelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye require me to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openly that ye will wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns.\" \"A sentence!---a sentence!\" exclaimed the chief Outlaw. \"A sentence!---a sentence!\" shouted his assessors; \"the Christian has shown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than the Jew.\" \"The God of my fathers help me!\" said the Jew; \"will ye bear to the ground an impoverished creature?---I am this day childless, and will ye deprive me of the means of livelihood?\" \"Thou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,\" said Aymer. \"Alas! my lord,\" said Isaac, \"your law permits you not to know how the child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart---O Rebecca! laughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a zecchin, and each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give to know whether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!\" \"Was not thy daughter dark-haired?\" said one of the outlaws; \"and wore she not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?\" \"She did!---she did!\" said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as formerly with fear. \"The blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canst thou tell me aught of her safety?\" \"It was she, then,\" said the yeoman, \"who was carried off by the proud Templar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn my bow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the damsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.\" \"Oh!\" answered the Jew, \"I would to God thou hadst shot, though the arrow had pierced her bosom!---Better the tomb of her fathers than the dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod! Ichabod! the glory hath departed from my house!\" \"Friends,\" said the Chief, looking round, \"the old man is but a Jew, natheless his grief touches me.---Deal uprightly with us, Isaac---will paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether penniless?\" Isaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by dint of inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection, grew pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small surplus. \"Well---go to---what though there be,\" said the Outlaw, \"we will not reckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as well hope to redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as to shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft. ---We will take thee at the same ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower, which hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon this worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of rating a Jew merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt have six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughter\u0027s ransom. Templars love the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of black eyes.---Hasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De Bois-Guilbert, ere worse comes of it. Thou wilt find him, as our scouts have brought notice, at the next Preceptory house of his Order.---Said I well, my merry mates?\" The yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader\u0027s opinion; and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by learning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw himself at the feet of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard against his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The Captain drew himself back, and extricated himself from the Jew\u0027s grasp, not without some marks of contempt. \"Nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no such Eastern prostrations---Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like me.\" \"Ay, Jew,\" said Prior Aymer; \"kneel to God, as represented in the servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due gifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for thyself and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she is of fair and comely countenance,---I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also Brian de Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much---bethink thee how thou mayst deserve my good word with him.\" \"Alas! alas!\" said the Jew, \"on every hand the spoilers arise against me---I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of Egypt.\" \"And what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?\" answered the Prior; \"for what saith holy writ, \u0027verbum Domini projecerunt, et sapientia est nulla in eis\u0027---they have cast forth the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them; \u0027propterea dabo mulieres eorum exteris\u0027---I will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar, as in the present matter; \u0027et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienis\u0027, and their treasures to others---as in the present case to these honest gentlemen.\" Isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into his state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led him aside. \"Advise thee well, Isaac,\" said Locksley, \"what thou wilt do in this matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is vain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his profusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac, with the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags---What! know I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into the vaulted chamber under thy garden at York?\" The Jew grew as pale as death---\"But fear nothing from me,\" continued the yeoman, \"for we are of old acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair daughter Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in thy house till his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him recovered, and with a piece of money?---Usurer as thou art, thou didst never place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it has this day saved thee five hundred crowns.\" \"And thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?\" said Isaac; \"I thought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.\" \"I am Bend-the-Bow,\" said the Captain, \"and Locksley, and have a good name besides all these.\" \"But thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same vaulted apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some merchandises which I will gladly part with to you---one hundred yards of Lincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of Spanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round, and sound---these will I send thee for thy good-will, honest Diccon, an thou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.\" \"Silent as a dormouse,\" said the Outlaw; \"and never trust me but I am grieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it---The Templars lances are too strong for my archery in the open field ---they would scatter us like dust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off, something might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come, shall I treat for thee with the Prior?\" \"In God\u0027s name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my bosom!\" \"Do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,\" said the Outlaw, \"and I will deal with him in thy behalf.\" He then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as his shadow. \"Prior Aymer,\" said the Captain, \"come apart with me under this tree. Men say thou dost love wine, and a lady\u0027s smile, better than beseems thy Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard, too, thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well be that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a purse of gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love oppression or cruelty. ---Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver, if thy intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the freedom of his daughter.\" \"In safety and honour, as when taken from me,\" said the Jew, \"otherwise it is no bargain.\" \"Peace, Isaac,\" said the Outlaw, \"or I give up thine interest. ---What say you to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?\" \"The matter,\" quoth the Prior, \"is of a mixed condition; for, if I do a good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage of a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite will advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the building of our dortour,* * \"Dortour\", or dormitory. I will take it on my conscience to aid him in the matter of his daughter.\" \"For a score of marks to the dortour,\" said the Outlaw,---\"Be still, I say, Isaac!---or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, we will not stand with you.\" \"Nay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow\"---said Isaac, endeavouring to interpose. \"Good Jew---good beast---good earthworm!\" said the yeoman, losing patience; \"an thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance with thy daughter\u0027s life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of every maravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!\" Isaac shrunk together, and was silent. \"And what pledge am I to have for all this?\" said the Prior. \"When Isaac returns successful through your mediation,\" said the Outlaw, \"I swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the money in good silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better have paid twenty such sums.\" \"Well then, Jew,\" said Aymer, \"since I must needs meddle in this matter, let me have the use of thy writing-tablets---though, hold ---rather than use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I find one?\" \"If your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew\u0027s tablets, for the pen I can find a remedy,\" said the yeoman; and, bending his bow, he aimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the advanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way to the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came fluttering down, transfixed with the arrow. \"There, Prior,\" said the Captain, \"are quills enow to supply all the monks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to writing chronicles.\" The Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered them to the Jew, saying, \"This will be thy safe-conduct to the Preceptory of Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to accomplish the delivery of thy daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of advantage and commodity at thine own hand; for, trust me well, the good Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for nought.\" \"Well, Prior,\" said the Outlaw, \"I will detain thee no longer here than to give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy ransom is fixed---I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that ye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint Mary refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang ten years the sooner!\" With a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to Bois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of York of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that sum. \"And now,\" said Prior Aymer, \"I will pray you of restitution of my mules and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which I have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true prisoner.\" \"Touching your brethren, Sir Prior,\" said Locksley, \"they shall have present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses and mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may enable you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means of journeying.---But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else, you must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will not yield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the vanities of this life, the strong temptation to break the rule of his foundation, by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.\" \"Think what you do, my masters,\" said the Prior, \"ere you put your hand on the Church\u0027s patrimony---These things are \u0027inter res sacras\u0027, and I wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical hands.\" \"I will take care of that, reverend Prior,\" said the Hermit of Copmanhurst; \"for I will wear them myself.\" \"Friend, or brother,\" said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his doubts, \"if thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to look how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in this day\u0027s work.\" \"Friend Prior,\" returned the Hermit, \"you are to know that I belong to a little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for the Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the convent.\" \"Thou art utterly irregular,\" said the Prior; \"one of those disorderly men, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause, profane the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at their hands; \u0027lapides pro pane condonantes iis\u0027, giving them stones instead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.\" \"Nay,\" said the Friar, \"an my brain-pan could have been broken by Latin, it had not held so long together.---I say, that easing a world of such misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.\" \"Thou be\u0027st a hedge-priest,\"* * Note I. Hedge-Priests. said the Prior, in great wrath, \"\u0027excommunicabo vos\u0027.\" \"Thou be\u0027st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,\" said the Friar, equally indignant; \"I will pouch up no such affront before my parishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I be a reverend brother to thee. \u0027Ossa ejus perfringam\u0027, I will break your bones, as the Vulgate hath it.\" \"Hola!\" cried the Captain, \"come the reverend brethren to such terms?---Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.---Prior, an thou hast not made thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.---Hermit, let the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.\" The yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their voices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered the more fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior at length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was compromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the Outlaw\u0027s chaplain, and being joined by his attendants, rode off with considerably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so far as worldly matters were concerned, than he had exhibited before this rencounter. It remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom which he was to pay on the Prior\u0027s account, as well as upon his own. He gave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his tribe at York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand crowns, and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note. \"My brother Sheva,\" he said, groaning deeply, \"hath the key of my warehouses.\" \"And of the vaulted chamber,\" whispered Locksley. \"No, no---may Heaven forefend!\" said Isaac; \"evil is the hour that let any one whomsoever into that secret!\" \"It is safe with me,\" said the Outlaw, \"so be that this thy scroll produce the sum therein nominated and set down.---But what now, Isaac? art dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy daughter\u0027s peril out of thy mind?\" The Jew started to his feet---\"No, Diccon, no---I will presently set forth.---Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and will not call evil.\" Yet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting advice:---\"Be liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse for thy daughter\u0027s safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured molten down thy throat.\" Isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey, accompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the same time his guards, through the wood. The Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various proceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he avoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil policy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and influence of the laws. \"Good fruit, Sir Knight,\" said the yeoman, \"will sometimes grow on a sorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and unmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there are, doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise its license with some moderation, and some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to follow such a trade at all.\" \"And to one of those,\" said the Knight, \"I am now, I presume, speaking?\" \"Sir Knight,\" said the Outlaw, \"we have each our secret. You are welcome to form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures touching you, though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as I do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not offended that I preserve my own.\" \"I crave pardon, brave Outlaw,\" said the Knight, \"your reproof is just. But it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on either side.---Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?\" \"There is my hand upon it,\" said Locksley; \"and I will call it the hand of a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.\" \"And there is mine in return,\" said the Knight, \"and I hold it honoured by being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the unlimited power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he performs, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well, gallant Outlaw!\" Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock, mounting upon his strong war-horse, rode off through the forest. 战士中的英华， 我们的泰特斯·拉歇斯怎样啦？ 马歇斯：他正忙得跟法官似的， 一会儿处死这个，一会儿放逐那个， 有的要罚款，有的要赦免或者警告。 《科利奥兰纳斯》(注) -------- (注)莎士比亚的剧本，引文见第一幕第六场。 长老被俘以后，只觉得尊严遭到了凌辱，服饰受到了摧残，身体面临着威胁，几种情绪纠结在一起，使他的神色和举止变得一反常态。 “先生们，这是怎么回事？”他说，声音中流露了那三种情绪。“这算是什么规矩？你们是土耳其人还是基督徒，这么对待一个教士？这是对上帝的仆人使用暴力，你们明白吗？你们抢走了我的行囊，撕破了我的镶边绣花披风，那是哪怕给红衣主教穿也不算丢脸的呢。要是换了别人，他非开除你们的教籍不可；但是我慈悲为怀，只要你们送还我的马匹，释放我的修士们，交回我的行囊，立即付给我一百金币，让我在茹尔沃修道院的祭台上，给你们举行一场赎罪弥撒，由你们许下心愿，在下一个五旬节到来以前不吃鹿肉，我便可以既往不咎，饶恕你们这次疯狂的恶作剧。” “神圣的长老，”首领说道，“我很遗憾，我的部下中有人会这么对待您，以致引起了您的谴责。” “对待！”长者答道，首领的温和语调使他的胆子大了一些。“哪怕对一只良种猎狗也不兴这样呀，何况对一个基督徒，更何况对一个教士；对茹尔沃修道院的长老，那就特别不应该了。这里有一个不敬上帝，只知喝酒的行吟歌手，名叫阿伦阿代尔——这是一个二流子——他甚至威胁说，如果我除了他已经抢走的那些宝贝，那些贵重的金链子和双环戒指以外，不肯再付四百枚金币的赎金，他就要对我实施体罚——不，要处死我；不仅如此，我还有一些珍贵的东西，例如我的香盒和银卷发夹子，在他们粗糙的手里给打断了，损坏了。” “不会这样吧，阿伦阿代尔不会这么对待您这样高贵的教士，”首领说。 “这是真的，就像《尼哥底母福音》(注)那么可靠，”长老说，“他还讲了许多北方的粗话，发誓说要在树林里找一棵最高的树，把我吊死。” -------- (注)基督教的一部没有编人《圣经》正典中的福音书，传说为耶稣的门徒圣尼哥底母所写。 “他真的这么讲过？唉，那么，尊敬的长老，我想，阿伦阿代尔既然这么讲了，您还是照他的要求办好，因为阿伦阿代尔这个人是说得到做得到的。” “您这是跟我开玩笑吧，”长老吃了一惊，这么说，勉强露出了笑容，“我也是喜欢讲笑话的，真的。不过，哈哈哈，玩笑开了整整一夜，到了早晨应该言归正传啦。” “我是像忏悔神父一样认真呢，”首领答道。“长老，您得付一大笔赎金才成，要不，您的修道院就得另选新的住持了，因为您的位置恐怕得另请高明了。” “你们是基督徒吗，怎么能对一位教士这么讲话？”长老说道。 “当然是基督徒啊！不信，您就瞧瞧，我们中间也有神父呢，”首领答道。“来，我们的大胖子教士，给这位长老讲解一下有关这问题的经文。” 那位随军教士还半醉半醒的，在草绿衣衫上披了一件修士袍子，尽量回忆着从前背熟的一些字句。“愿上帝保佑您一切顺利，长老，”他说，“我们欢迎您到森林中来。” “你这是在胡扯什么？”长老说。“朋友，如果你真的是教会的人，你不如告诉我，我怎么才能逃出这些人的手掌，不要装神弄鬼的，跟我磨嘴皮，扮鬼脸。” “说真的，长老，”修士答道，“我知道你只有一个脱身的办法。今天是我们的圣安得烈日，是收什一税的时候(注)。” -------- (注)圣安得烈是耶稣的十二门徒之一，圣安得烈日在十一月三十日，什一税是《旧约》中说的每人应献给耶和华的份额，这两者并无联系，只是塔克修士随口胡诌的。 “但是，兄弟，我想这不是向教会收的吧？”长老说。 “向俗人收，也向教会收，”修士说。“因此，长老，你还是得仰仗不义之财给你帮忙，只有它能够搭救你，别的都不成。” “我打心底里喜欢你们这些绿林好汉，”长老说，口气变得温和了，“得啦，你们不必对我这么凶。我也懂得森林中的玩意儿，号角吹得又响又清楚，能叫每一棵栎树发出回声。算了，你们何必这么难为我呢。” “给他一只号角，”首领说，“我们得考考他，看他是不是吹牛。” 艾默长老吹了一遍号角。首领直摇头。 “长老，”他说，“你吹的调子很动听，但它不能替你赎身：我们不能像一个骑士的盾牌上写的那样，因为你吹得动听就释放你。另外，我还发现，你吹的是法国的柔和音调，它搅乱了苍劲有力的英国号角声。长老，凭你那最后一声花腔，我得判你增加五十枚金币的赎金，因为它把原来雄壮的号音弄得面目全非了。” “得啦，朋友，”长老说，有些不耐烦了，“你是个不好伺候的猎人。我希望你在赎金问题上，还是将就一些的好。一句话，这次算我倒霉，不得不向魔鬼进贡，你们说吧，我得付多少赎金，才不用给五十个人押送，便能在沃特林大道(注)上自由行走？” -------- (注)英国古代的一条交通要道，后来往往用它泛指所有的大路。 一个小头目凑在首领耳边说道：“我看，是不是让长老给犹太佬，犹太佬给长老，互相定一下各人的赎金数目？” “你是个糊涂虫，”首领说，“不过你的主意倒不错！听着，犹太人，走前一步。你瞧瞧那位艾默长老，他是富裕的茹尔沃修道院的院长，你说，我们应该向他要多少赎金？我保证，你了解这修道院的收入。” “哦，当然了解，”以撒说，“我跟那里的神父做过买卖，经手过他们的小麦和大麦，树上的果子，还有不少羊毛。哦，那是一所富饶的大修道院，茹尔沃的那些神父都生活阔绰，地窖里有的是上好的美酒。像我这种无家可归的人，要是有这么一个安身之处，每年每月都有那么多收入，那不论要我拿多少金银来赎身，我都愿意。” “你这只犹太狗！”长老嚷道，“没有人比你知道得更清楚，为了装修圣坛，我们的修道院欠了多少债……” “这也是为了要在上一季度把你们的地窖装满葡萄酒，”犹太人打断他的话道，“不过这都……这都算不得什么。” “别听这不信基督的野狗胡诌！”长老说。“他血口喷人，好像我们修道院是为那些酒欠的债；我们有权喝酒，这是必要的时候御寒用的。这个行过割礼的无赖诬陷神圣的教会，基督徒听了却不加申斥！” “这一切都说明不了什么，”首领说道。“以撒，你讲吧，他付多少钱还不致影响他们的日常开支？” “六百枚金币，”以撒说道，“用这点钱犒赏各位勇士，对这位长老说来算不得什么，不致影响他的舒适生活。” “六百枚金币，”首领说，声音严肃，“很好，这够了；以撒，你讲得对，六百枚金币。这就是我的判决，长老阁下。” “对，这是宣判，宣判！”大伙嚷道，“所罗门也不会判得这么合理。” “你听到宣判了，长老，”首领说道。 “你们疯了，各位朋友，”长老说，“请问，我上哪儿去弄这么一笔钱？哪怕我把我们修道院祭台上的圣器和烛台全都卖了，也凑不到一半数目；何况要办这事，还得我亲自回茹尔沃才成，你们可以留下我的两个教士作人质。” “这靠不住，”首领说，“我们得扣留你，长老，派你的教士去取赎金。你在这里不愁没有酒喝，没有肉吃；如果你喜欢在森林里玩玩，这里景色迷人，比你们北方强多了。” “或者，如果长老愿意，”以撒说，想讨好那些庄户人，“我可以派人前往约克，从他们修道院存在我处的钱中，取出六百枚金币交上，只要长老肯写一张收据给我。” “你要他写，他会写的，以撒，”首领说，“不过你得把艾默长老的和你自己的赎金一起付清。” “我自己的！呀，各位勇士，”犹太人说，“我已经破产，成了穷光蛋；如果要我付五十枚金币，我便只能靠讨饭棒度过一生了。” “这不妨让长老来判断，”首领说。“艾默长老，你怎么说？犹太人付得起一笔赎金吗？” “付得起赎金？”长者答道。一他不是约克的以撒吗？谁不知道他是个大老板，哪怕要他给掳往亚述的以色列十大部族出赎金(注)，他也出得起呢。我自己跟他来往不多，但我们管地窖和库房的教士跟他常打交道，据他们讲，他在约克的住宅里堆满了金银，可以使任何基督教国家相形见细。一切活着的基督徒都不得不感到诧异，我们怎么会容忍这些蝰蛇盘踞在我们的国土上，靠卑鄙的高利贷和巧取豪夺，吸我们的血，甚至把手伸进了神圣的教会。” -------- (注)指公元前722年，亚述国王灭亡以色列王国的事。以色列人本来有十二部族，以色列王国由其中的十大部族组成。以色列王国灭亡后，以色列王和臣民两万七千多人被俘往两河流域。 “别说了，长老，”犹太人答道，“还是请你平心静气想想吧。你知道，我从没强迫别人向我借钱。但是教士和俗人，亲王和长老，骑士和神父来敲以撒家的门，向他借钱的时候，从来不是这么不客气的。那时是：‘以撒老兄，请您在这件事上帮帮忙吧，凭上帝作证，到期我一定归还。’还有：‘仁慈的以撒，您一向助人为乐，这次真像朋友一样解决了我的困难！’可是期限一到，我去讨债时，听到的却是：‘该死的犹太佬’和‘但愿埃及的灾难(注)永远降临在你们的部族中’；总之，恨不得把粗暴无礼的百姓都煽动起来，迫害我们这些可怜的外乡人！” -------- (注)以色列人早期曾遭到埃及法老的奴役，见《旧约·出埃及记》。 “长老，”首领说，“他虽然是犹太人，这句话可讲得不错。因此不必再争吵了，就像他指定你的赎金数目一样，你也指定一下他的数目。” “除了latro famosus(注)——它的意思我可以在以后适当的时候再行奉告——谁也不会对一个基督教高级教士与一个没有受过洗礼的犹太人一视同仁，”长老说道。“但是既然你们要我给这贱人定个价钱，我可以坦率告诉你们，你们至少得向他要一千枚金币，少一个也不成，否则就是便宜了他。” -------- (注)拉丁文：臭名昭著的强盗。这话是对洛克斯利讲的，因此长老故意用了拉丁文，不让他们听懂。 “好，这就是我们的判决，我们的判决！”首领大声宣告。 “对，这是我们的宣判，我们的宣判！”他的陪审官们一致嚷嚷。“基督徒是有良好修养的，他对我们比犹太人大方得多。” “我们祖先的上帝保佑我吧！”犹太人说，“你们忍心逼死一个穷困潦倒的人吗？今天我已经失去了孩子，你们还要剥夺我活命的手段吗？” “犹太佬，你失去了孩子，你的负担也减轻啦，”艾默说。 “哎哟！我的老天爷，”以撒说，“你们的法律使你们不能明白，我们的亲生骨肉怎样与我们的心千丝万缕地联结在一起。啊，丽贝卡！我亲爱的拉雪儿的女儿呀！哪怕那棵树上的每片叶子都是金币，每个金币都是我的，我也宁愿把这全部财富拿出来，只要谁能告诉我，你是不是还活着，没有遭到那个拿撒勒人的毒手！” “你的女儿是黑头发吧？”一个强盗问，“戴一块丝织的面纱，上面有银线绣花的？” “对，是这样，是这样！”老人说，声音有些发抖，但这是由于兴奋，不是像以前那样由于害怕。“但愿雅各赐福给你！你能告诉我，她现在平安无事吗？” “那么这是她，”那个庄稼汉说，“她给骄傲的圣殿骑士带走了，是昨天傍晚从我们的队伍中冲出去的。我曾拉开弓，想射他一箭，但为了那个姑娘，没敢射出，我怕我的箭会射在她的身上。” “啊！”犹太人答道，“我真希望你能射出，哪怕射中她的心脏也好！对她说来，躺在她祖先的坟墓里，还比遭到无耻而野蛮的圣殿骑士的凌辱好一些。以迦博！以迦博！荣耀离开我的家了(注)！” -------- (注)有一次以色列人与非利士人作战失败，死了不少人，一个以色列人非尼哈也战死了，他的妻子正好临产，生下一个孩子，她便给孩子起名叫以迹博，意为“失去荣誉”，说道：“以迦博，荣耀离开以色列了”，见《旧约·撒母耳记上》第4章。 “朋友们，”首领看看周围的人说道，“这老人只是一个犹太人，可是他的不幸使我同情。以撒，要对我们讲老实话，你付了这一千金币赎金，真的一个钱也不剩了吗？” 以撒经这一问，想起了自己的财产；他只因根深蒂固的习惯，对金钱的爱好甚至可以与他的父女之情对抗；现在他变得脸色苍白，吞吞吐吐，但是不能否认，他付了赎金仍有一些剩余。 “好吧，算了，随你还剩多少，”首领说，“我们不想跟你算得太苛刻。你没有钱，要想从布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔手中救出孩子，那是痴心妄想，好比用没有箭头的箭射鹿一样。我们可以答应你，你的赎金与艾默长老的一样，甚至再减少一百金币，这一百金币作为我个人的损失，不算在我们的公账上。这样也免得人家骂我们抬高犹太人的身价，把他与基督教的高级教士一视同仁。以撒，现在你可以留下五百金币，作你女儿的赎金了。圣殿骑士不仅喜欢闪闪发亮的黑眼睛，同样喜欢闪闪发亮的黄金白银。你得趁早把你的金币拿到布瓦吉贝尔耳边去，叮叮当当敲给他听，免得发生更坏的事。根据我的侦察员送来的消息，你可以在附近的圣殿会堂里找到他。我说得合理吗，小伙子们？” 老乡们对首领一向言听计从，现在也作了这样的表示。以撒由于得知他的女儿还活着，还可以用钱赎回，忧虑减轻了一半，赶紧扑在慷慨的首领脚下，把胡须挨到了他的靴子上，想吻他那件绿大褂的衣襟。首领缩回身子，挣脱了犹太人的手，同时不免露出了一点鄙夷的神色。 “别这样，你这家伙，站起来！我是英国人，不喜欢东方人的叩头。应该向上帝跪拜，不是向我这样的罪人。” “对，犹太人，”艾默长老说，“应该向上帝跪拜，向侍候上帝的教士跪拜，他知道，只要你诚心悔改，向圣罗贝尔(注)的神龛献上一份合适的礼物，你就可以为你自己和你的女儿丽贝卡求得上帝的保佑。我怜悯这位少女，知道她生得又漂亮又文静，我曾经在阿什口比武场上见到过她。而且布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔这人，我的话对他还是有些作用的，你考虑吧，要不要我替你讲讲情。” -------- (注)罗贝尔是诺曼底公爵，征眼者威廉的父亲。 “哎哟！不得了！”犹太人说，“劫掠的手从四面八方伸向了我，我成了亚述的掠夺物，成了埃及的掠夺物。” “你这个被诅咒的民族还能指望别的命运不成？”长老答道，“《圣经》上就这么说：‘他们抛弃了上帝的话，他们就失去了智慧。’还说：‘我要把他们的妇人给予外人’——在目前这件事上，就是给予圣殿骑士；又说：‘把他们的财产给予别人’——从目前来说，也就是给予这些高尚的先生。” 以撒长吁短叹的，绞着双手，重又陷入了凄凉和绝望的状态。但是首领把他带到一边。 “我得劝劝你，以撒，”洛克斯利说，“不论你打算怎么办，我的意思是你得跟这位教士交个朋友。他很自负，以撒，又很贪婪；至少他需要钱供他挥霍。你完全有力量满足他的欲望，因为你不要以为我相信你穷苦的鬼话。以撒，我了解你的底细，你的大铁箱里藏着一大袋一大袋的银钱。怎么！难道我不知道苹果树下的那块大石头，从那里可以通往你约克家花园的地下室，不是吗？”犹太人的脸变得死一般苍白了。“但是放心，我不会害你，”庄户人继续道，“因为我们是老朋友啦。你还记得那个生病的乡下佬吗？你的漂亮女儿丽贝卡在约克城把他从镣铐下救了出来，让他住在你家中养病，等身体好了，才打发他走，还资助了他一枚银币，不是吗？你放高利贷，可这次才是一本万利呢，这一枚银币给你今天省下了五百枚金币。” “那么你就是我们称做弯弓迪康的那个人？”以撒说。“难怪我觉得你的口音有些熟呢。” “我是弯弓，”首领说，“也叫洛克斯利，除此以外还有别的名字。” “但是，我的好兄弟，关于那个地下室的事，你误解了。上帝知道，那里其实没什么，只是存放着一些货物，我很乐意分一些给你们，比如一百码草绿色衣料，让你们做紧身上衣，一百根西班牙紫杉做弓，还有一百根弓弦，都是又坚韧又牢固又光滑的；这些我全是为了表示感谢送给你的，正直的迪康；但是那个地下室，请你务必保守秘密，我的好迪康。” “我一定替你保守秘密，”首领说，“不过不要指望我什么，我只是同情你的女儿。我对这事无能为力。圣殿骑士那班人太厉害了，在空旷的平地上我的弓箭手奈何他们不得，会给他们打得七零八落。当时要是我知道，给带走的是丽贝卡，我也许会想想办法，但现在你得靠策略对付他了。好吧，要我为你跟长老谈谈吗？” “看在上帝份上，迪康，想想法子，帮助我找回我的亲生孩子吧！” “可是你别跟我打岔，不要吝啬，这在目前不合适，”首领说，“我会替你跟他好好谈的。” 于是他转身走了，可是犹太人钉住了他，跟影子似的。 “艾默长老，”首领说，“跟我到这棵树下来。听说你爱喝酒，也爱跟女人调情，这与你的身分不太合适，长老；不过，我不想干涉。我还听说，你爱养养猎犬，还喜欢骑马，这都不坏，只是玩这些东西得花钱，由此看来，你是不会嫌弃一袋金币的。但是我从没听说，你喜欢压迫或者残忍的行为。现在这个以撒，他愿意为你的消遣和娱乐提供一些帮助，给你一袋一百枚银币的钱，只要你肯出面调停一下，让你的朋友圣殿骑士释放他的女儿。” “得保证她的平安和贞洁，像她离开我的时候一样，”以撒插口道，“不然，这笔交易就做不成。” “别多嘴，以撤，”首领说，“否则我就不管你的事了。艾默长老，你说我这个主意怎么样？” “这件事有些复杂，”长者答道，“因为一方面这是件好事，可是另一方面，占便宜的是一个犹太人，这又大大违背了我的良心。不过，如果这个以色列人肯捐一笔钱给教堂，让我修建几间禅房，那么我就可以问心无愧，帮助他解决他女儿的事了。” “叫他拿出二十马克金币修理房屋……”首领说，“喂，以撒，别打岔！……或者给祭台捐一对银烛台，这都可以办到。” “不，但是，我的弯弓迪康，”以撤又想插嘴了。 “老兄，你是畜生，你是虫子！”首领说，失去了耐心，“如果你还要把你那些肮脏钱，看得跟你女儿的生命和荣誉一样重，那么我起誓，我非在三天内弄得你倾家荡产不可！” 以撒把话缩回去了，吓得再也不敢作声。 “这一切怎么保证？”长老问。 “等你斡旋成功，以撒平安回来，”首领说，“我凭圣休伯特起誓，一定督促他向你兑付全部金银，分文不少，否则我会找他算账，让他觉得不如拿出二十倍的钱更好。” “那就这么办，犹太人，”艾默说，“既然要我插手这件事，我得用一下你的纸笔——哦，且慢，我宁可斋戒二十四个钟头，也不用你的笔，那叫我上哪儿找笔呢？” “如果长老觉得犹太人的纸还可以将就，那么现成的笔我能找到，”首领说。这时一群大雁正从他们头顶经过，要飞往遥远的霍尔德内斯沼泽，于是他挽起弓，一箭射去，领头的那只雁便带着射中的箭，摇摇晃晃的掉到了地上。 “长老，”首领说，“除非你们要写编年史，这些羽毛尽够茹尔沃修道院的全体修士用上一百年了。” 长老坐了下去，不慌不忙地动手给布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔写信，然后小心翼翼封好信纸，交给犹太人，一边说道：“这可以作你前往圣殿会堂的通行证；照我想，凭这封信，你的女儿多半便可获得释放；不过你还得备上一份厚礼，这得靠你自己了，告诉你，这位布瓦吉贝尔骑士属于这类人，他们是从来不做赔本生意的。” “好啦，长老，”首领说，“我不想多留你了，只要你再写一张收据交给犹太人，就可以走了——我接受他作我的代理人；以后如果我听说，你跟他吵闹，不承认他从你账上付出的这笔钱，那就别怪我不客气，我会把你的修道院烧成平地，哪怕我要为此提前十年上绞架，我也不怕！” 现在长老不像刚才给布瓦吉贝尔写信那么悠闲自在了，垂头丧气地写了收据，说明他为了支付赎金，向约克的以撒预支了六百枚金币，该款已如数领迄，并将从修道院的账目中给予扣除，决不食言。 “我满足了你们的要求，”艾默长老说，“像一个真正的俘虏那样付了赎金，现在得请你们归还我的骡子和马，释放我的随从人员，退回从我身上搜去的双环戒指、珠宝和珍贵服饰等等了。” “关于你的随从人员，长老，”洛克斯利说，“他们马上就会获得自由，再扣留他们是不对的；关于你的马和骡子，它们也应全部奉还，另外还给你一些必要的零花钱，让你可以返回约克城，如果连路费也不给，未免太残忍了。至于那些戒指、珠宝、项链等等，那么你必须理解，我们是心地慈善的，考虑到你是一位看破红尘、德高望重的教士，我们不忍心让你戴上这些戒指、项链和其他无聊的装饰品，受到它们的强烈诱惑，因而破坏教会的清规戒律。” “各位朋友，”长老答道，“在你们把手伸向教会的财物以前，先想想你们在干什么。这些东西都是属于教会的圣物，如果它们落到俗人手中，我不知道这会引起什么报应。” “我们会注意这点的，尊敬的长老，”科普曼赫斯特的隐士插嘴道，“因为我可以自己戴这些东西。” “朋友，也许你是教会的人，”长老答道，对这个解决办法表示不满‘“但我不知道，教会是否真的对你行过授职礼，如果那样，那么请你注意。你今天参加的这种活动，你是得向教会承担责任的。” “长老朋友，”隐士答道，“不妨让你知道，我是属于一个小小的主教管区的，在那里我自己便是主教，我既不受约克主教的管辖，也不必茹尔沃修道院长老和整个修道院为我操心。” “你根本不是一个真正的教士，”长老说，“你属于那种不守规矩的人，这种人不经正式手续便自封为圣职人员，亵读教会的圣礼，危害向他们仔悔的人的灵魂，正如《武甘大圣经》(注)上说的：他们给人的不是食物，是石头。” -------- (注)即《通俗拉丁文圣经》，它通称《武甘大圣经》，曾被教会定为正式拉丁文本，后来才发现它错误甚多，不足为据。 “不对，”修上答道，“你的拉丁文奈何不了我，我的脑袋里有的是。我可以说，对你这种自以为是的教士，没收你的珠宝和装饰品，只是剥夺你的不义之财，是合法的。” “你是个草包教士(注)，”长老说，勃然大怒，“我开除你的教籍。” -------- (注)见作者附注八。——原注 “你自己更像一个流氓和异教徒，”修士同样怒气冲冲地说。“尽管我和你都是教会中人，你居然不顾体面，在我的教徒面前这么侮辱我，我决不会轻饶你。正如《武甘大圣经》上说的，我得打断你的骨头。” “好啦！”首领喊道，“同是教会的人，这么争吵像样吗？修士，请你保持冷静。长老，哪怕你不愿看在上帝份上言归于好，也别再跟修士斗嘴啦。隐士，让长老作为一个付了赎金的人，与我们好好告别吧。” 但是两个愤愤不平的教士，仍在用不连贯的拉丁文互相诋毁，只是长老讲得流利一些，隐士讲得激烈一些罢了。最后老乡们总算把他们分开了，这时长老才静下心来，想起跟这个草包，这个强盗们的随军教士互相谩骂，实在有失尊严，于是带着随从人员，骑马走了，尽管已不像来的时候那么豪华阔绰，但从世俗的观点看来，比他在这次奇遇前的表现，却更符合一个使徒的身分了。 现在犹太人也得为他自己的赎金，以及他代为支付的长老的赎金，提供书面凭证了。于是他给约克城的一个朋友，另一个犹太人，写了一张条子，盖了印，要求他付给来人一千一百枚金币，另外还特别注明了要供应的几种商品。 “我的朋友谢瓦有我货仓的钥匙，”他说，深深叹了口气。 “还有地下室的钥匙吧，”洛克斯利小声道。 “不，不，老天保佑！”以撤说，“让人知道那个秘密，我就要大祸临头啦！” “你放心，我不会泄漏，”首领说，“只要你把信上指定的数目付清，就没事了。喂，以撒，你怎么啦？你死了吗？还愣在那儿干吗？损失了一千金币就急得失魂落魄似的，把女儿的危险也忘记了吗？” 以撒跳起身来就走。“不，迪康，我马上去办。你呀，我不能说你是好人，又不敢、也不愿说你是坏人；再见吧！” 然而在以撒动身以前，首领还是给了他几句临别赠言：“为了你女儿的安全，要大方一些，不要舍不得花钱。相信我，在这件事上如果小气，省下的钱会变成熔化的金银，硬在你的喉咙口，叫你一辈子都过不安稳。” 以撒唉声叹气地默认了这点，便出发了；首领派两个高大的汉子送他离开森林，既是保护他，也是当他的向导。 在这一幕幕情景进行时，黑甲骑士一直饶有趣味地在旁观看，现在他也得向首领告辞了，然而临走前他不能不表示他的惊异，因为他万万没有想到，在这些处于法律以外，不受法律保护的人中间，居然也有一套处理公共事务的方针政策。 “一棵有病的树上，有时也会结出健全的果实，”首领说，“罪恶的时代不见得永远只能产生清一色的罪恶。在被迫走上这条不法道路的人中间，有不少人无疑并不愿做过分越轨的事，也有的人干这营生可能完全是不得已的。” “现在跟我说话的人，可能便是这样吧？”骑士问。 “骑士老弟，”首领答道，“我们每人都有自己的秘密。你可以对我作出自己的判断，我也可以对你作出我的推测，尽管我们的箭可能都没有射中目标，这也没什么。但是正如我并不想要求你公开你的秘密，我也希望你允许我保留我的秘密。” “请原谅，勇敢的首领，”骑士说，“你的责备是公正的。但是也许我们今后再见面的时候，双方都会坦率一些了。现在让我们作为朋友分手吧，好吗？” “很好，我向你伸出我的手，”洛克斯利说，“尽管目前，这是一个强盗的手，但它是一个真正的英国人的手。” “我也向你伸出我的手，”骑士说，“这只手能与你的手握在一起，我认为这是它的光荣。因为一个拥有无限权力可以干坏事的人，不仅应该为他所做的好事，也应该为他所没有做的坏事，得到赞扬。再见吧，英勇的壮士！” 这样，他们在友好中分别了，黑甲骑士随即跳上强壮的战马，向森林中疾驰而去了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2695.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷 Ivanhoe","description":"简介： Ivanhoe is a novel by
