{"id":6130,"no":39,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"Stern was the law which bade its vot\u0027ries leave At human woes with human hearts to grieve; Stern was the law, which at the winning wile Of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile; But sterner still, when high the iron-rod Of tyrant power she shook, and call\u0027d that power of God. The Middle Ages\n The Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca, occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall---a platform, which we have already described as the place of honour, destined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests of an ancient mansion.\n On an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master of the Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his hand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet was placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order, whose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day. The black dresses, bare scalps, and demure looks of these church-men, formed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who attended, either as residing in the Preceptory, or as come thither to attend upon their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom there were four present, occupied seats lower in height, and somewhat drawn back behind that of their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed no such rank in the Order, were placed on benches still lower, and preserving the same distance from the Preceptors as these from the Grand Master. Behind them, but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall, stood the esquires of the Order, in white dresses of an inferior quality.\n The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in the faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring, united with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession, and which, in the presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit upon every brow.\n The remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards, holding partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither, to see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater part of those inferior persons were, in one rank or other, connected with the Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their black dresses. But peasants from the neighbouring country were not refused admittance; for it was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the edifying spectacle of the justice which he administered as public as possible. His large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly, and his countenance appeared elated by the conscious dignity, and imaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A psalm, which he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age had not deprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day; and the solemn sounds, \"Venite exultemus Domino\", so often sung by the Templars before engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged by Lucas most appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed it, over the powers of darkness. The deep prolonged notes, raised by a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant, arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolled on amongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters.\n When the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around the circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was vacant. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left his place, and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the benches occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand extending his long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face; while the other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which, sheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.\n \"Unhappy man!\" said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance of compassion. \"Thou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses him. To this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers of this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!---Seest thou he cannot look upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse from his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the floor?---It may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at and defy the foul enemy. \u0027Semper Leo percutiatur!\u0027\"\n This was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade Mont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the assembly.\n \"Reverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this Holy Order, my brethren and my children!---you also, well-born and pious Esquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross! ---and you also, Christian brethren, of every degree!---Be it known to you, that it is not defect of power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation; for, however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed, with this batoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of this our Holy Order. Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly and religious profession, hath said, in the fifty-ninth capital,*\n * The reader is again referred to the Rules of the Poor * Military Brotherhood of the Temple, which occur in the * Works of St Bernard. L. T.\n that he would not that brethren be called together in council, save at the will and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those more worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office, to judge, as well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of the whole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all such chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath made an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with bows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have therefore summoned to our presence a Jewish woman, by name Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York---a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries; whereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a churl, but of a Knight ---not of a secular Knight, but of one devoted to the service of the Holy Temple---not of a Knight Companion, but of a Preceptor of our Order, first in honour as in place. Our brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now hear me, as a true and zealous champion of the Cross, by whose arm many deeds of valour have been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy places purified from pollution by the blood of those infidels who defiled them. Neither have our brother\u0027s sagacity and prudence been less in repute among his brethren than his valour and discipline; in so much, that knights, both in eastern and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert as one who may well be put in nomination as successor to this batoon, when it shall please Heaven to release us from the toil of bearing it. If we were told that such a man, so honoured, and so honourable, suddenly casting away regard for his character, his vows, his brethren, and his prospects, had associated to himself a Jewish damsel, wandered in this lewd company, through solitary places, defended her person in preference to his own, and, finally, was so utterly blinded and besotted by his folly, as to bring her even to one of our own Preceptories, what should we say but that the noble knight was possessed by some evil demon, or influenced by some wicked spell?---If we could suppose it otherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any earthly consideration, should prevent us from visiting him with punishment, that the evil thing might be removed, even according to the text, \u0027Auferte malum ex vobis\u0027. For various and heinous are the acts of transgression against the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable history.---1st, He hath walked according to his proper will, contrary to capital 33, \u0027Quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedat\u0027.---2d, He hath held communication with an excommunicated person, capital 57, \u0027Ut fratres non participent cum excommunicatis\u0027, and therefore hath a portion in \u0027Anathema Maranatha\u0027.---3d, He hath conversed with strange women, contrary to the capital, \u0027Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis mulieribus\u0027.---4th, He hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be feared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of our renowned Order, \u0027Ut fugiantur oscula\u0027, the soldiers of the Cross are brought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation, were he the right hand and right eye thereof.\"\n He paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger part, who had been inclined to smile at the statute \u0027De osculis fugiendis\u0027, became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand Master was next to propose.\n \"Such,\" he said, \"and so great should indeed be the punishment of a Knight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his Order in such weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan had obtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his eyes too lightly upon a damsel\u0027s beauty, we are then rather to lament than chastise his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance as may purify him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of our indignation upon the accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh occasioned his utter falling away.---Stand forth, therefore, and bear witness, ye who have witnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge of the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be satisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must go on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our brother.\"\n Several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which Bois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the blazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to her safety. The men gave these details with the exaggerations common to vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event, and their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased by the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent person for whose information it had been delivered. Thus the dangers which Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently great, became portentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight to Rebecca\u0027s defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of discretion, but even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference to what she said, even although her language was often severe and upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his haughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.\n The Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner in which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The evidence of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently studied to spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time to time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some temporary alienation of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of the damsel whom he brought along with him. With sighs of penitence, the Preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and her lover within the walls of the Preceptory---\"But my defence,\" he concluded, \"has been made in my confession to our most reverend father the Grand Master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct may have been irregular. Joyfully will I submit to any penance he shall assign me.\"\n \"Thou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,\" said Beaumanoir; \"thy motives were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring brother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong; as he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup instead of the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of accomplishing his purpose. Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our pious founder for matins, and nine for vespers; be those services doubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars permitted the use of flesh; but do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This do for six weeks to come, and thy penance is accomplished.\"\n With a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of Templestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his seat.\n \"Were it not well, brethren,\" said the Grand Master, \"that we examine something into the former life and conversation of this woman, specially that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms and spells, since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted upon by some infernal enticement and delusion?\"\n Herman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other three were Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an ancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the sabre of the Moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his brethren. He arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted him license of speech. \"I would crave to know, most Reverend Father, of our valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these wondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his unhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?\"\n \"Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\" said the Grand Master, \"thou hearest the question which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer. I command thee to reply to him.\"\n Bois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus addressed, and remained silent.\n \"He is possessed by a dumb devil,\" said the Grand Master. \"Avoid thee, Sathanus!---Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee, by this symbol of our Holy Order.\"\n Bois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and indignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would have little availed him. \"Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\" he answered, \"replies not, most Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If his honour be impeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that sword which has often fought for Christendom.\"\n \"We forgive thee, Brother Brian,\" said the Grand Master; \"though that thou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a glorifying of thine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our own worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less of thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven\u0027s leave, we will quell and drive forth from our assembly.\" A glance of disdain flashed from the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made no reply.---\"And now,\" pursued the Grand Master, \"since our Brother of Goodalricke\u0027s question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we our quest, brethren, and with our patron\u0027s assistance, we will search to the bottom this mystery of iniquity.---Let those who have aught to witness of the life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth before us.\" There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when the Grand Master enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a bedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his limbs, by a miraculous balsam.\n The poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar, terrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly cured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on crutches to give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many tears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at York, he was suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring for Isaac the rich Jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to stir from his bed until the remedies applied by Rebecca\u0027s directions, and especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree restored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she had given him a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of money withal, to return to the house of his father, near to Templestowe. \"And may it please your gracious Reverence,\" said the man, \"I cannot think the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a Jewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed, and it never operated a whit less kindly---\"\n \"Peace, slave,\" said the Grand Master, \"and begone! It well suits brutes like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and to be giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the fiend can impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in order to bring into credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of which thou speakest?\"\n The peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a small box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with most of the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary. Beaumanoir, after crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and, learned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the lid,---\"The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.\"\n \"Strange powers of Sathanas.\" said he, \"which can convert Scripture into blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!---Is there no leech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?\"\n Two mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other a barber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials, excepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to be Oriental herbs. But with the true professional hatred to a successful practitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the medicine was beyond their own knowledge, it must necessarily have been compounded from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they themselves, though no conjurors, fully understood every branch of their art, so far as it might be exercised with the good faith of a Christian. When this medical research was ended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the medicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frowned severely at the request. \"What is thy name, fellow?\" said he to the cripple.\n \"Higg, the son of Snell,\" answered the peasant.\n \"Then Higg, son of Snell,\" said the Grand Master, \"I tell thee it is better to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of unbelievers\u0027 medicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil infidels of their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them benevolent gifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.\"\n \"Alack,\" said the peasant, \"an it shall not displease your Reverence, the lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I will tell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that your mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him faithful service.\"\n \"Out with the prating villain!\" said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared to refute this practical application of his general maxim.\n Higg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the fate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even at the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the terror of which withered his very heart within him.\n At this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to unveil herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied patiently, but with dignity,---\"That it was not the wont of the daughters of her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of strangers.\" The sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her reply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. But Beaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity which could interfere with his imagined duty, was a virtue of itself, repeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The guards were about to remove her veil accordingly, when she stood up before the Grand Master and said, \"Nay, but for the love of your own daughters---Alas,\" she said, recollecting herself, \"ye have no daughters!---yet for the remembrance of your mothers---for the love of your sisters, and of female decency, let me not be thus handled in your presence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I will obey you,\" she added, with an expression of patient sorrow in her voice, which had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; \"ye are elders among your people, and at your command I will show the features of an ill-fated maiden.\"\n She withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which bashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a murmur of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their eyes, in silent correspondence, that Brian\u0027s best apology was in the power of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But Higg, the son of Snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the sight of the countenance of his benefactress.\n \"Let me go forth,\" he said to the warders at the door of the hall,---\"let me go forth!---To look at her again will kill me, for I have had a share in murdering her.\"\n \"Peace, poor man,\" said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; \"thou hast done me no harm by speaking the truth---thou canst not aid me by thy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee ---go home and save thyself.\"\n Higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders, who were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them reprehension, and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent, and was permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert Malvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their testimony, were now called forward. Though both were hardened and inflexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as well as her excelling beauty, at first appeared to stagger them; but an expressive glance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their dogged composure; and they delivered, with a precision which would have seemed suspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether fictitious or trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant with suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and the sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. The circumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days, divided into two classes---those which were immaterial, and those which were actually and physically impossible. But both were, in those ignorant and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of guilt.---The first class set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter to herself in an unknown tongue---that the songs she sung by fits were of a strangely sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and his heart throb---that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward for a reply---that her garments were of a strange and mystic form, unlike those of women of good repute---that she had rings impressed with cabalistical devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her veil.\n All these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely listened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that Rebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.\n But there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of the assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however incredible. One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded man, brought with them to the castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said, make certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious words, which he blessed God he understood not, when the iron head of a square cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding was stanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a quarter of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in managing a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This legend was probably founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the wounded Ivanhoe when in the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the more difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to produce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony, he drew from his pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been miraculously extracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full ounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however marvellous.\n His comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the scene betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of precipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his companion, this fellow stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself upon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white swan, under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of Torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the female form.\n Less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient to convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a Jewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too weighty for Rebecca\u0027s youth, though combined with the most exquisite beauty.\n The Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn tone demanded of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of condemnation, which he was about to pronounce.\n \"To invoke your pity,\" said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat tremulous with emotion, \"would, I am aware, be as useless as I should hold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our faiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men (whom may Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would avail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still less would it advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my dress, language, and manners, are those of my people---I had well-nigh said of my country, but alas! we have no country. Nor will I even vindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there listening to the fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant into the victim.---God be judge between him and me! but rather would I submit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me, than listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon me ---friendless, defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own faith, and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn protestations of the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to himself the charge brought against me---but to himself---Yes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not false? as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?\"\n There was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was silent.\n \"Speak,\" she said, \"if thou art a man---if thou art a Christian, speak!---I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by the name thou dost inherit---by the knighthood thou dost vaunt ---by the honour of thy mother---by the tomb and the bones of thy father---I conjure thee to say, are these things true?\"\n \"Answer her, brother,\" said the Grand Master, \"if the Enemy with whom thou dost wrestle will give thee power.\"\n In fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which almost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that at last he replied, looking to Rebecca, ---\"The scroll!---the scroll!\"\n \"Ay,\" said Beaumanoir, \"this is indeed testimony! The victim of her witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.\"\n But Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were from Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment which she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in the Arabian character, \"Demand a Champion!\" The murmuring commentary which ran through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert, gave Rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll unobserved. When the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.\n \"Rebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too powerful. Hast thou aught else to say?\"\n \"There is yet one chance of life left to me,\" said Rebecca, \"even by your own fierce laws. Life has been miserable---miserable, at least, of late---but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me the means of defending it. I deny this charge---I maintain my innocence, and I declare the falsehood of this accusation---I challenge the privilege of trial by combat, and will appear by my champion.\"\n \"And who, Rebecca,\" replied the Grand Master, \"will lay lance in rest for a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?\"\n \"God will raise me up a champion,\" said Rebecca---\"It cannot be that in merry England---the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so many are ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one to fight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by combat---there lies my gage.\"\n She took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before the Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which excited universal surprise and admiration.\n \n 法律是严厉的，它不准你哭，\n 尽管你对人世的苦难悲愤不平，心如刀割；\n 法律是严厉的，它不准你笑，\n 尽管你对骗人的鬼话了大叫旨掌，忍俊不禁；\n 但是暴君的铁腕更加严厉，\n 因为它自称它是秉承上帝的意旨行事。\n 《中世纪》\n 审判无辜的、不幸的丽贝卡的审问台，设在大厅上首较高的平台上——这种平台我们已经描写过，它是荣誉席位，专供古老住宅中最尊贵的主人和来宾使用。\n 平台正中有一个高高的座位，它面对被告，现在圣殿骑士团的大宗师便坐在这里，他穿着全套宽大的白长袍，手中握着带有骑士团标志的神秘权杖。他的脚边设有一张桌子，两个神父坐在桌后，他们的任务便是把当天的审问过程记录成文。教士的黑衣服、光脑壳和矜持表情，与骑士们的军人装束形成了鲜明的对照，这些骑士有的是常驻在会堂中的，也有的是随同大宗师来到这儿的。会督有四人出席，他们的座位比大宗师的略低一些，也靠后一些；地位不如他们的骑士坐在更低一些的长凳上，他们与会督也保持着会督与大宗师的距离。他们背后，但仍在大厅的平台上，站着骑士团的卫士，他们穿的是较低级别的白色大褂。\n 整个会场表现了庄严肃穆的气氛；在骑士们的脸上，除了可以看到慓悍的军人气概以外，还流露出一种虔诚的几乎与教士不相上下的表情，这是他们在大宗师面前必须保持的姿态。\n 大厅的其余部分，也就是平台以外的部分，站满了执戟的卫兵，以及出于好奇，为了观看大宗师和犹太妖女而来的其他侍从人员。这些下等人物，极大部分都在骑士团中担任着一定的职务，因此都穿着黑色制服。但是附近乡村中的农民也允许入内，因为大宗师为他主持的审判感到自豪，要让尽量多的人看到这个场面，从而接受教育。当他环视会场时，他那对蓝色的大眼睛似乎更大了，脸色也显得沾沾自喜，觉得他即将扮演的角色具有伸张正义的、神圣不可侵犯的性质。审问开始时，他与大家一起高唱了赞美诗，他虽然年老，嗓音仍很圆润，不减当年。他们唱的是“来啊，让我们向主高唱”(注)，这首庄严的诗篇是圣殿骑士每逢与尘世的仇敌战斗前经常唱的；卢加斯认为，它适合目前的场合，可以作为战胜黑暗势力的前奏。这深沉而迁缓的调子，经过一百来个习惯于合唱圣诗的男人的共同努力，升向大厅的拱形屋顶，像一片汹涌澎湃的海洋发出的悦耳而威严的涛声，在梁柱之间回荡。\n --------\n (注)这是《旧约·诗篇》第95篇的第一句。\n 歌声沉寂后，大宗师抬起眼睛，不慌不忙地向周围打量了一遍；他看到一个位置空着，它本来应该是布里恩。布瓦吉贝尔坐的，但现在他站在角上，靠近一般骑士坐的一条长凳的末端，用一只手把长袍撩起一些，让它遮住了一部分脸；他的另一只手握着十字剑柄，用鞘尖在栎木地板上慢慢划线条。\n “不幸的人！”大宗师露出同情的目光端详了他一会以后，说道，“康拉德，你瞧，我们这神圣的工作使他多么伤心。一个轻薄的女人，在尘世的恶魔的帮助下，竟能使一个勇敢高尚的骑士落到这步田地！你瞧他不敢看我们，也不敢看她；谁知道他在地上划这些神秘的线条干什么，也许这是魔鬼要他画的吧？魔鬼想用符箓危害我们的生命和安全，可是我们根本不怕魔鬼。‘必须消灭狮子！”’\n 这是对他的心腹随从康拉德·蒙特菲舍一个人讲的。然后大宗师提高嗓门，向全场的人说道：\n “尊敬和英勇的骑士、会督和骑士团的朋友们，我的弟兄们和我的孩子们！还有你们，出身高贵和虔诚的扈从们，期望戴上这神圣的十字架的人们！还有你们，一切等级的基督徒弟兄们！你们应该看到，我们召开这个公审大会，是因为我们有足够的力量根除一切罪恶；我本人固然并不足道，但是我手中的权杖授予了我充分的权力，对涉及我们神圣骑士团的事进行审问和处理。圣伯尔纳对我们在骑士组织和宗教方面的义务作了规定(注)，他在该章程第五十九条中说，本团的弟兄们不必经常举行会议，只在大宗师需要的时候下令召集；这就是授权给我，像授权给我以前的历任大宗师一样，根据具体情况，决定在什么时间和地点，召集一个会堂或所有各个会堂的会议。这也是说，在我们所有的会堂中，我有责任听取弟兄们的意见，并按照我个人的判断作出决定。因此当狼张牙舞爪冲进我们的羊群，带走我们的一名成员时，仁慈的牧人便有责任召集所有的会众，让大家拿起弓箭和投石器捕杀入侵者，因为按照人所共知的我们的章程，狮子是永远应该被镇压的。就这样，我现在把一个犹太女人传上法庭，她名叫丽贝卡，是约克的以撒的女儿——一个因施行妖法和巫术而声名狼藉的女人；她利用这些法术使人丧失理智，头脑糊涂，而且受害的不是一个老百姓，而是一个骑士；不是一个世俗的骑士，而是一个献身给圣殿事业的骑士；也不是一个一般的骑士，而是骑士团中享有崇高声誉和地位的一名会督。我们的兄弟布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔是我们所熟悉的，也是现在听我讲话的各级人士都熟悉的，他作为十字军的一名忠诚而热情的战士，曾凭他的武艺在圣地建立过许多卓越的功勋，并用亵读圣地的邪教徒的血洗净了一个个神圣的场所。这位弟兄的明智和谨慎，也像他的勇敢和教养一样，是有口皆碑的；因此不论在东方和西方，所有的骑士都承认，在上帝允许我放下大宗师这副沉重的担子，回到他的身边去时，布瓦吉贝尔是有资格接替我，继续执掌这根权杖的。如果我们听到这样一个人，这样一个人人尊敬、光荣正直的人，突然抛弃他的品德，他的誓言，他的弟兄和他的前途，与一个犹太女子纠缠在一起，并且在这个淫荡的女人陪伴下，在一些偏僻荒凉的地方游荡，用盾牌保护她，而不是保护自己，最后甚至不顾一切，胡乱行事，把她带进了我们的一个会堂中，那么我们除了觉得，这个高贵的骑士已被邪恶的魔鬼所控制，或者受到了某种妖法的蛊惑以外，还能说什么呢？如果我们不这么设想，那么不论地位、勇敢、崇高的声望和任何世俗的考虑，都不能阻止我们对他进行惩罚，按照经书上的要求，‘把鞭长莠草从我们中间清除出去’。因为在这件值得痛心的事件上，违反我们的章程的行为是多方面的，十分严重的。首先，他按照自己的意愿自由行事，这违背了章程的第三十三条：‘不得自行其是，任意行动。’其次，他与革出教门的人私自来往，这违反了第五十七条：‘不得与排除在教门以外之人来往，’因而也犯了革除教籍的罪。第三，他与异教的妇女结交，违反了不得与异教妇女往来交际的规定。第四，他没有回避，不，也许他甚至希求与妇女亲吻，因而违背了章程的最后一条：‘不得与女人亲吻，’因为这是会把十字军战士带进陷阶的。由于这些严重的、多方面的罪行，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔应该被剪除，驱逐出我们的骑士团，哪怕他是我们的右手和右眼。”\n --------\n (注)请读者再参看圣殿骑士团这个军事组织的章程，它载在圣怕尔纳的《文集》中。——原注\n 他停止了。会场上出现了一片喊喊喳喳的低语声。年轻的那部分人中，有的听到“不准亲吻”时，甚至忍俊不禁，现在却变得严肃了，等着听大宗师接着要讲什么。\n “确实，”他继续道，“一个圣殿骑士在这么重要的几点上，有意识地违背了骑士团的规则，他应该得到的惩罚是不轻的。但是，也许这个骑士只是偶然对一个女子的美貌看了一眼，魔鬼便趁机运用妖术和魔法，主宰了骑士的心灵，那么我们只能感到痛心，不是对他的堕落进行惩罚；我们对他要做的，也只限于促使他改邪归正，苦修赎罪，我们的愤怒的主要锋芒应该转向那个罪恶的工具，也正是它使他几乎走上毁灭的道路涸此现在要由目睹这些不幸事件的人上来作证，我们可以根据他们的陈述，采取相应的态度，并作出判决；确定我们是否可以只限于惩罚这个邪恶的女人，或者必须更进一步，怀着一颗悲痛的心，也对我们的兄弟实行惩罚。”\n 几个证人被叫了出来；他们主要证明，布瓦吉贝尔怎样冒着生命危险，从城堡的大火中搭救丽贝卡，怎样不顾自身的安全，把全部注意力集中在保护她的生命上。这些人提供的细节都极尽夸大之能事，因为庸俗的头脑对任何奇谈怪论天然具有浓厚的兴趣，何况他们发现，要他们提供证词的大人物，对他们的汇报十分满意，这又大大促进了他们天赋的猎奇心理。这样，布瓦吉贝尔经历的危险本来固然也非同寻常，现在更变得骇人听闻了。在他们的渲染下，这位骑士对丽贝卡的保护不仅超出了一般情理，而且显得不可思议，荒谬绝伦；似乎哪怕她对他疾颜厉色，大加申斥，他仍低首下心，恭恭敬敬，这样的描绘用在这个狂妄自大的人身上，简直叫人难以置信。\n 接着，圣殿会堂的会督奉命出场了，他得叙述布瓦吉贝尔和犹太女子到达会堂时的情形。马尔沃辛的证词是经过深思熟虑，无懈可击的。只是为了不致触痛布瓦吉贝尔的感情，他不得不插入一些模棱两可的话，暗示他当时已有些精神错乱，被他带来的那个女人弄得神魂颠倒了。会督叹了口气，表示悔罪，声称他为他允许丽贝卡和她的情人进人会堂，感到后悔莫及。“不过我已向我们最尊敬的大宗师说明了我当时的想法，”他最后说道，“他知道我并无不良的动机，尽管我的行为可能是错误的。我愿意接受他给我的任何处分，决无怨言。”\n “你讲得很好，艾伯特兄弟，”博马诺说。“你的动机是好的，因为你认为这可以使一个犯了错误的兄弟不致一错再错，滑向深渊。但你的行动是错误的，就像一个人要拉住脱缰的马，不是勒紧缰绳，却去踢鞍镫，非但不能达到目的，还会使自己受害。我们虔诚的创始人规定，早祷要念主祷文十三遍，晚祷要念九遍，你的功课应该加倍。圣殿骑士一周可食肉三次，但你必须七天守斋。在今后六周内你都这么做，你的赎罪便完成了。”\n 会督装出诚心服从的表情，向大宗师深深鞠了一躬，便回到了座位上。\n “兄弟们，”大宗师又说道，“我们刚才听到的那些事实，使我们不得不设想，在这不幸的事件中，我们的兄弟是在魔鬼的迷惑和引诱下犯的罪，那么我们是否应该审查一下，这个女人从前的生活和言谈，尤其得判明，她是否可能运用魔法和妖术，你们说对吗？”\n 古达尔利克的赫尔曼是出席的第四个会督——其他三人是康拉德、马尔沃辛和布瓦吉贝尔——这是一个身经百战的老兵，脸上还留着穆斯林军刀造成的伤疤，他在骑士团中地位既高，又深得人心。他站了起来，向大宗师鞠了一躬；对他的自动要求发言，后者立刻同意了。于是他说道：“最尊敬的大宗师，我要求知道，我们勇敢的兄弟布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，对这些骇人的指控有什么要说的，他本人对他与这个犹太女子的不幸交往，有些什么看法？”\n “布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，”大宗师说道，“你听到我们古达尔利克的兄弟向你提出的问题了。我命令你回答他。”\n 布瓦吉贝尔听到大宗师的话，把脸转向了他，但保持着沉默。\n “魔鬼剥夺了他的讲话能力，”大宗师说道，“魔鬼，离开他！布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，讲吧，我已用我们神圣的权标从你身上赶走了魔鬼。”\n 布瓦吉贝尔尽量克制着心头愈来愈高涨的蔑视和愤怒，他完全明白，这种情绪的流露对他毫无好处。他答道：“最尊敬的大宗师，布里恩·布瓦占贝尔不想回答这些荒唐无稽的指责，如果他的荣誉遭到低毁，他会用他的血肉，他为基督教世界南征北战所使用的剑，保卫他自己。”\n “我们宽恕你，布里恩兄弟，”大宗师说，“虽然你在我面前夸耀你的作战业绩，这是吹嘘自己的功劳，它也来自魔鬼，他诱使我们自我崇拜。但是我们原谅你，因为你讲这些话不是你自己要讲，主要是受了魔鬼的指使；只要上帝允许，我们会征服他，把他从我们的会场驱逐出去。”布瓦吉贝尔那双阴鸷凶恶的眼睛迸发了一缕蔑视的目光，但是他没有回答什么。“兄弟们，”大宗师继续道，“由于我们古达尔利克的兄弟提出的问题，已得到了部分的回答，现在我们接着审理；我希望，在我们的守护神的帮助下，能把这件邪恶的案子查个水落石出。凡是对这个犹太女人的生活和言谈能提供任何见证的人，都可以站出来向我们陈述。”\n 大厅下首出现了一阵骚动，当大宗师询问原因时，有人答说，这里有一个老人本来卧床不起，后来多亏女犯人用一种神奇的药膏医治后，才恢复了行走能力。\n 这个可怜的乡下佬，一个撒克逊人，给拉到了审判台前；他吓得索索发抖，不知会受到怎样的惩罚，因为他犯了罪，让一个犹太女子医治了他的瘫痪病。他无疑还没有完全痊愈，出庭作证时仍得拄着拐杖行走。他的证词完全是被迫的，还流了不少眼泪；但他承认，两年前他曾为犹太财主以撒于活，因为他是个木匠，有一天他突然不能下床，但经过丽贝卡的诊治，尤其是使用了一种有香味的、发热的药膏以后，便逐渐恢复，多少可以使用他的双腿了。后来，他说，她还给了他一小盒那种珍贵的油膏，又给了他一枚金币，让他返回他的老家，它便在圣殿会堂附近。“不过，请尊贵的大老爷明察，”他说道，“我认为这闺女不可能是要伤害我，虽然她命不好，是个犹太人。我在用她的药时，总要念主祷文和使徒信经，但它的效果丝毫也没有减少。”\n “住口，奴才，”大宗师喝道，“滚下去，你这畜生活该倒霉，竟敢要魔鬼给你治病，拿魔鬼的钱，还跑到邪教徒家中去打工。告诉你，魔鬼可能故意让你生病，然后给你治病，这样便可以证明他有医病的本领。你讲的那种油膏，带来了没有？”\n 乡下佬把哆嗦的手伸进胸口，摸了一会，掏出了一个小盒子，盖子上有几个希伯来文，对于大多数听众说来，这便足以证明药是从魔鬼那儿来的。博马诺在身上划了个十字，把盒子拿在手上；他懂得好几种东方语言，完全了解盖上那几个字：“犹大部族的狮子是战无不胜的”(注)。于是他说道：“撒旦真是神通广大，居然用《圣经》的话来亵渎上帝，把毒药混入我们必需的食物中！这里有没有医生可以告诉我们这神秘油膏的成分？”\n --------\n (注)这句话见《旧约·创世记》第49章，是雅各临死前预祝犹大的子孙能像狮子一样茁壮成长（犹大是犹太人十二列祖之一），这本来只是一种比喻，与西多会和圣殿骑士团所说的狮子不同。\n 两个自称是医生的人走了出来，一个是修士，另一个是理发匠，他们声称他们对这种东西一无所知，只是它带有没药和樟脑的味道，那是从东方的植物中提炼的。但是出于对成功的同行的嫉妒，他们表示，这种药品既然连他们也不知道，一定是歪门邪道的非法产品；因为他们尽管不懂得魔法，但是能医治百病，只要按照基督徒的真诚信念是可以医治的。医学鉴定结束后，撒克逊农民低声下气的，要求把他认为有效的油膏还他，但大宗师皱紧了眉头，对破子说道：“乡下佬，你叫什么名字？”\n “希格·斯内尔，”农夫回答。\n “那么，希格·斯内尔，”大宗师说道，“我告诉你，宁可卧床不起，也比接受魔鬼的医药让你站起来行走好；宁可用强大的手掠夺邪教徒的钱财，也比接受他们的施舍，或者从他们手里领取工钱好。你去吧，记住照我的话做。”\n “我的天呐！”农民说，“但是请大宗师明鉴，这教训对我来得太迟了．因为我已经残废了；但我会把您老的话转告我的两个兄弟，他们还在替富裕的犹太拉比纳桑·本·以色列做工，我要告诉他们，大人说，宁可抢他的钱，也不可老老实实替他干活。”\n “把这个多嘴的混蛋撵走！”博马诺吆喝道；他一时措手不及，对他的一般格言的这种实际应用，不知怎么驳斥好。\n 希格·斯内尔返回了人群中，但是仍关心他的女恩人的命运，站在那里不想离开，宁可冒再度遭到严厉的法官申斥的危险，尽管这申斥把他吓得六神无主，心里直发怵。\n 审问进行到这个阶段，大宗师命令丽贝卡揭开面纱。现在她第一次汗口了，她耐心地、但是庄重地声明：“犹太民族的女儿单独处在陌生人中间时，不能揭开面纱，这不符合他们的风俗。”她那悦耳的嗓音，那温柔的回答，在群众中引起了怜悯和同情的反应。但是从博马诺看来，扼杀人的一切感情，不让它们干扰他行使的职责，是他应尽的义务，因此他重复了一遍他的命令，要他的受害者揭开面纱。那些卫士甚至蠢蠢欲动，想强制执行，于是她在大宗师面前挺直身子，说道：“不，请您想想自己的女儿……哦，”她想起来了，又道，“您没有女儿！那么想想您的母亲，您的姊妹，想想对待妇女的礼貌吧，不要让这些人当着您的面这么对待我，不应该让粗俗的仆人强行剥开一个少女的面纱。我可以服从您，”她又说，声音中流露了忍受委屈的心情，这甚至使博马诺那颗冷酷的心也有些软了。“在您的人民中您是一个长者，我可以服从您的命令，让您看到一个不幸的少女的面容。”\n 她撩开了面纱，望着人们，脸上羞涩和庄严的神色交织在一起。她超越常人的美貌引起了一阵惊讶的低语声，那些较年轻的骑士互相看看，似乎在用无声的语言说，布里恩最合理的辩解，也许便是她的真实的魅力，而不是她的虚构的巫术。但是希格·斯内尔对这位女恩人的容貌感受是最深刻的，他对站在大厅门口的卫士们说道：“让我到前面去，让我到前面去！我要再看她一眼，哪怕这会使我伤心得死去，也是罪有应得，因为我参与了谋害她的活动。”\n “安静一些，可怜的人，”而贝卡听到了他的叫喊，说道，“你没有害我，你讲的是事实；你的诉说和悲伤都不能帮助我。安静一些，我求你啦，回家去，顾全你自己吧。”\n 卫士们出于同情，想把希格推出门外，他们担心他的哭喊会给他们招来申斥，给他自己招来惩罚。但是他答应不再开口，这才给留下了。这时两个士兵站了出来，他们是经过艾伯特·马尔沃辛疏通过的，了解他们的证词的重要性。但是，尽管他们都是铁石心肠，残忍狠毒，女犯人的可怜样子，以及她的姣好容貌．起先似乎也使他们有些犹豫，只是圣殿会堂会督含有深意的一瞥，才使他们恢复无动于衷的本性。他们提供的情况，有的完全出于虚构，有的无关紧要，可是他们却讲得头头是道，公正一些的法官听了，一定会引起怀疑；这些事本身是真实的，然而通过他们夸大的表达，以及对事实附加的恶意评注，便显得难以置信了。按照今天的看法，他们的证词大致可以分作两类，一类纯属捕风捉影，牵强附会，另一类虽然言之凿凿，实际上是不可能的。但是在那个无知和迷信的时代，它们却常常被当作罪证，信以为真。第一类证词说，丽贝卡时常用一种不可理解的语言喃喃自语；她不时哼一些歌，声音奇怪，特别甜蜜，往往使人心猿意马；有时她还自言自语，仰起了头，好像在等待回答；而且她穿的是奇装异服，与一般正派女人不同，她的戒指上刻着犹太教的神秘花纹，面纱上绣着奇怪的符号。所有这一切都这么平常，这么细小，可是却被郑重其事地听着，仿佛这便是罪证，或者至少提出了一些重大嫌疑，说明丽贝卡与某些神秘力量有着不正当的联系。\n 然而也有一些并不那么含糊暖昧，以致全体或大部分群众都信以为真，听得津津有味，不论它们多么不合情理。一个士兵说，他曾看见她为带进托奎尔斯通城堡的一个伤员治病。“她在伤口上作了一会法，”他说，“一边念念有词——多谢上帝，这些话我听不懂——于是一个包铁的箭头便从伤口中跳了出来，血马上止住了，伤口合拢了，不到一刻钟，那个快死的人便站了起来，走到城楼上，帮助我使用射石机投射石块了。”这则神话的根据，也许便是丽贝卡在城堡中，替负伤的艾文荷治病这件事。但是由于一件物证的出现，这故事的准确性变得更难以驳斥了，原来证人为了用事实证明他口述的话，从口袋里掏出了一个箭头，这便是从伤口中奇迹般跳出来的那个箭头，它足足有一盎司重，这就充分证实了他的证词，不论它显得多么离奇。\n 他的伙伴则证明，他曾在附近的城墙上，亲眼看到丽贝卡和布瓦吉贝尔的那场争吵，当时她站在塔楼顶上，正预备纵身往下跳。这夕家伙也不比他的朋友差，他说，他看到丽贝卡站在塔楼的胸墙上，突然变成了一只洁白的天鹅，绕着托奎尔斯通城堡飞了三圈，然后又落到塔楼上，恢复了女人的形状。\n 这个有力的证明只要一半，就足够把任何一个又穷又丑的老妇人判处死罪了，哪怕她不是犹太人。丽贝卡纵然生得天姿国色，年轻貌美，但具有生为犹太人的致命弱点，这大量证词自然足以把她置于死地了。\n 大宗师收集了各方面的意见，现在用庄严的声调问丽贝卡，对他即将宣布的判决，还有什么话要说。\n 可爱的犹太姑娘由于感情激动，嗓音有些发抖，说道：“我知道，祈求您的怜悯是没有用的，对我说来也不值得。声称为信仰其他宗教的人救死扶伤，并不违背我们两派宗教公认的造物主的意旨，这也徒劳无益；说明这些人 ——愿上帝宽恕他们——指控我的许多事是不可能的，这对我没有多大意义，因为您相信它们是可能的；至于就我的服饰、语言和行为作出解释，更是毫无必要，大家知道它们之所以与你们的不同，只是因为它们属于我的民族——我想说我的祖国，但是可惜，我们没有祖国！我甚至不想为了替自己辩护，指控欺压我的人，这个人正站在那里听着这一切无中生有、向壁虚构的话，它们的目的只是要把一个暴徒变成受害者。让上帝在他和我之间作出裁决吧！但是我宁可在您颠倒黑白的判决下死十次，也不愿接受他的要求，这个魔鬼的门徒企图把我压服，因为我没有朋友，没人保护，又是他的俘虏。然而他是信仰你们的宗教的，他微不足道的一句话，便可以推翻一个受迫害的犹太女子声嘶力竭的抗议。因此我不想为我受到的指责提出反驳；但是对他本人——是的，布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔，我要请问你，这些控告是不是真的？尽管它们要置我于死地，可是难道它们不是荒谬绝伦的诬蔑吗？”\n 她停了，所有的眼睛都转向了布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔。他保持着沉默。\n “讲啊，”她说，“如果你是一个人，如果你是一个基督徒，讲啊！我要求你讲，为了你穿的这身衣服，为了你继承的这个姓，为了你自己夸耀的骑士身分，为了你母亲的荣誉，为了你父亲的坟墓和遗骸，请你老实说，这些事是不是真的？”\n “回答她，兄弟，”大宗师说道，“如果与你搏斗的魔鬼让你开口的话。”\n 事实上，各种矛盾的感情，正在布瓦吉贝尔心头搏斗，使他脸部的肌肉出现了一阵阵痉挛，他几经挣扎，最后才向丽贝卡勉强发出了一个声音：“字条！……字条！”\n “对，”博马诺说，“这确实是证据！她的妖术的受害人只能提出这个真凭实据，毫无疑问，字条上的咒语便是使他开不出口的原因。”\n 但是丽贝卡对布瓦吉贝尔口中勉强挤出的那几个字，却另有解释；她蓦地想起了那张羊皮纸条，她看了一眼它上面的几个阿拉伯字：“要求一个勇士替你决斗！”布瓦吉贝尔的离奇回答，在会场上引起了一片窃窃低语声，这正好给了她阅读字条的机会，她随即偷偷把它撕毁了。低语声平息后，大宗师说道：\n “丽贝卡，我们看到，魔鬼仍在一定程度上控制着这位不幸的骑士，但很清楚，你不能从他口中得到有利的证词。你还有什么别的话要说吗？”\n “哪怕按照你们的残酷法律，我也还有一线活命的希望，”丽贝卡说。“生活是悲惨的，至少我最近的这些日子是悲惨的，但是我不想抛弃上帝赐予我的生命，只要我还没有丧失他给予我的保卫它的办法。我要求凭决斗判定是非的权利(注)，我要委托一位勇士代表我进行决斗。”\n --------\n (注)在中世纪的欧洲，遇到疑难案件，往往用决斗来解决，决斗的胜负被认为是上帝的裁决，这便是所谓决斗断讼法，是“神裁法”的一种。这时当事人如为教士或妇女，可委托勇士代表他们决斗。\n “丽贝卡，”大宗师答道，“谁愿意为一个女巫进行比武？谁肯作一个犹太女子的斗士呢？”\n “上帝会赐给我一名勇士的，”丽贝卡说。“快活的英格兰是好客的，慷慨的，自由的，这里有许多人愿意为了荣誉冒生命危险，这里也不会没有一个人愿意为正义而战斗。但是我要求凭决斗裁定是非，这便够了；这是我的信物。”\n 她从手上脱下一只绣花手套，把它丢在大宗师的脚下，神色那么单纯，又那么庄严，引起了每个人的惊讶和赞赏。\n \n
