{"id":6137,"no":46,"title":"Chapter 44","content":"So! now \u0027tis ended, like an old wife\u0027s story. Webster\n When the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe demanded of the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully and rightfully done his duty in the combat? \"Manfully and rightfully hath it been done,\" said the Grand Master. \"I pronounce the maiden free and guiltless---The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will of the victor.\"\n \"I will not despoil him of his weapons,\" said the Knight of Ivanhoe, \"nor condemn his corpse to shame---he hath fought for Christendom---God\u0027s arm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his obsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust quarrel.---And for the maiden---\"\n He was interrupted by a clattering of horses\u0027 feet, advancing in such numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the Black Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band of men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.\n \"I am too late,\" he said, looking around him. \"I had doomed Bois-Guilbert for mine own property.---Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on thee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?\"\n \"Heaven, my Liege,\" answered Ivanhoe, \"hath taken this proud man for its victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed.\"\n \"Peace be with him,\" said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse, \"if it may be so---he was a gallant knight, and has died in his steel harness full knightly. But we must waste no time ---Bohun, do thine office!\"\n A Knight stepped forward from the King\u0027s attendants, and, laying his hand on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, \"I arrest thee of High Treason.\"\n The Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so many warriors.---He now spoke.\n \"Who dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth of his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by whose authority is this bold outrage offered?\"\n \"I make the arrest,\" replied the Knight---\"I, Henry Bohun, Earl of Essex, Lord High Constable of England.\"\n \"And he arrests Malvoisin,\" said the King, raising his visor, \"by the order of Richard Plantagenet, here present.---Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it is well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.---But for thee, Malvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a week older.\"\n \"I will resist thy doom,\" said the Grand Master.\n \"Proud Templar,\" said the King, \"thou canst not---look up, and behold the Royal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of thy Temple banner!---Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition---Thy hand is in the lion\u0027s mouth.\"\n \"I will appeal to Rome against thee,\" said the Grand Master, \"for usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.\"\n \"Be it so,\" said the King; \"but for thine own sake tax me not with usurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to thy next Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made the scene of treasonable conspiracy against the King of England---Or, if thou wilt, remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.\"\n \"To be a guest in the house where I should command?\" said the Templar; \"never!---Chaplains, raise the Psalm, \u0027Quare fremuerunt Gentes?\u0027---Knights, squires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to follow the banner of \u0027Beau-seant!\u0027\"\n The Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of England\u0027s king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and dismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the watch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not the timidity of the scared flock ---there were dark brows of defiance, and looks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words. They drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks of the knights were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers, like the lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had raised a clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence on the formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade defiance, and shrunk back from their front.\n The Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force, dashed the rowels into his charger\u0027s sides, and galloped backwards and forwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable. Richard alone, as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked, rode slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, \"What, sirs! Among so many gallant knights, will none dare splinter a spear with Richard?---Sirs of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they are not worth the shiver of a broken lance?\"\n \"The Brethren of the Temple,\" said the Grand Master, riding forward in advance of their body, \"fight not on such idle and profane quarrel---and not with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my presence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel, and whether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which thou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To thine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which we leave behind us, and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence thou hast this day given to Christendom.\"\n With these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the signal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an Oriental character, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance. They changed their array from a line to a column of march, and moved off as slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was only the will of their Grand Master, and no fear of the opposing and superior force, which compelled them to withdraw.\n \"By the splendour of Our Lady\u0027s brow!\" said King Richard, \"it is pity of their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they are disciplined and valiant.\"\n The multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of its challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of the squadron left the ground.\n During the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca saw and heard nothing---she was locked in the arms of her aged father, giddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances around her. But one word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered feelings.\n \"Let us go,\" he said, \"my dear daughter, my recovered treasure ---let us go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.\"\n \"Not so,\" said Rebecca, \"O no---no---no---I must not at this moment dare to speak to him---Alas! I should say more than---No, my father, let us instantly leave this evil place.\"\n \"But, my daughter,\" said Isaac, \"to leave him who hath come forth like a strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so he might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a people strange unto him and his---this is service to be thankfully acknowledged.\"\n \"It is---it is---most thankfully---most devoutly acknowledged,\" said Rebecca---\"it shall be still more so---but not now---for the sake of thy beloved Rachel, father, grant my request---not now!\"\n \"Nay, but,\" said Isaac, insisting, \"they will deem us more thankless than mere dogs!\"\n \"But thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and that------\"\n \"True, my best---my wisest Rebecca!---Let us hence---let us hence!---Money he will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine, and, as they say, from prison---and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise out of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us hence!\"\n And hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists, and by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely to the house of the Rabbi Nathan.\n The Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the day, having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was transferred to the Black Knight. They now filled the air with \"Long life to Richard with the Lion\u0027s Heart, and down with the usurping Templars!\"\n \"Notwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,\" said Ivanhoe to the Earl of Essex, \"it was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with him, noble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.\"\n The Earl smiled and shook his head.\n \"Gallant Ivanhoe,\" said Essex, \"dost thou know our Master so well, and yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards York having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met King Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in his own person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with his own single arm. I accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his consent.\"\n \"And what news from York, brave Earl?\" said Ivanhoe; \"will the rebels bide us there?\"\n \"No more than December\u0027s snow will bide July\u0027s sun,\" said the Earl; \"they are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring us the news, but John himself!\"\n \"The traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!\" said Ivanhoe; \"did not Richard order him into confinement?\"\n \"O! he received him,\" answered the Earl, \"as if they had met after a hunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said, \u0027Thou seest, brother, I have some angry men with me---thou wert best go to our mother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until men\u0027s minds are pacified.\u0027\"\n \"And this was all he said?\" enquired Ivanhoe; \"would not any one say that this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?\"\n \"Just,\" replied the Earl, \"as the man may be said to invite death, who undertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound unhealed.\"\n \"I forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,\" said Ivanhoe; \"but, remember, I hazarded but my own life---Richard, the welfare of his kingdom.\"\n \"Those,\" replied Essex, \"who are specially careless of their own welfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others---But let us haste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their principal.\"\n From the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and which are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that Maurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of Philip of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert, the Preceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and Prince John, for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his good-natured brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the two Malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well deserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.\n Briefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the court of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that had been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at York. Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message---but he refused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every hope that he had entertained of restoring a Saxon dynasty in England; for, whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of a civil war, it was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed dominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities and military fame, although his administration was wilfully careless, now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.\n But, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric\u0027s reluctant observation, that his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the marriage of Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual dissent of both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event which, in his ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he could scarce bring himself to believe that two Saxons of royal descent should scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the public weal of the nation. But it was not the less certain: Rowena had always expressed her repugnance to Athelstane, and now Athelstane was no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue his addresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of junction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with each hand. He made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and he found that resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country squires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.\n It seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint Edmund\u0027s, Athelstane\u0027s spirit of revenge, what between the natural indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of his mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the clerical order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in the dungeons of Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For this atrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by himself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust imprisonment they had sustained. With this controversy, and with the means he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric found the mind of his friend Athelstane so fully occupied, that it had no room for another idea. And when Rowena\u0027s name was mentioned the noble Athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that she might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a desperate case therefore. There was obviously no more to be made of Athelstane; or, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended from Saxon times to ours, he was a cock that would not fight.\n There remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers desired to come to, only two obstacles---his own obstinacy, and his dislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way before the endearments of his ward, and the pride which he could not help nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible to the honour of allying his own line to that of Alfred, when the superior claims of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were abandoned for ever. Cedric\u0027s aversion to the Norman race of kings was also much undermined,---first, by consideration of the impossibility of ridding England of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create loyalty in the subject to the king \"de facto\"; and, secondly, by the personal attention of King Richard, who delighted in the blunt humour of Cedric, and, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt with the noble Saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he had given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and his son Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\n The nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were celebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York. The King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on this and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded Saxons, gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just rights, than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of a civil war. The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all the splendour which she of Rome knows how to apply with such brilliant effect.\n Gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master whom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of Wilfred\u0027s dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to expect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.\n But besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were celebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as Saxons, joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that marked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace and harmony betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so completely mingled, that the distinction has become wholly invisible. Cedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion; for as the two nations mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each other, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons were refined from their rusticity. But it was not until the reign of Edward the Third that the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court of London, and that the hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems entirely to have disappeared.\n It was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady Rowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel desired admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley might be without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated, became curious, and ended by commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants to withdraw.\n She entered---a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil, in which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the elegance and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect, unmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate favour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to the feelings, of others. She arose, and would have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again intimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady of Ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena\u0027s resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.\n \"What means this, lady?\" said the surprised bride; \"or why do you offer to me a deference so unusual?\"\n \"Because to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,\" said Rebecca, rising up and resuming the usual quiet dignity of her manner, \"I may lawfully, and without rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I am---forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my country---I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his life against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.\"\n \"Damsel,\" said Rowena, \"Wilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back but in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can serve thee?\"\n \"Nothing,\" said Rebecca, calmly, \"unless you will transmit to him my grateful farewell.\"\n \"You leave England then?\" said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of this extraordinary visit.\n \"I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother high in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada ---thither we go, secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the Moslem exact from our people.\"\n \"And are you not then as well protected in England?\" said Rowena. \"My husband has favour with the King---the King himself is just and generous.\"\n \"Lady,\" said Rebecca, \"I doubt it not---but the people of England are a fierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves, and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such is no safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is an heartless dove---Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two burdens. Not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by hostile neighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can Israel hope to rest during her wanderings.\"\n \"But you, maiden,\" said Rowena---\"you surely can have nothing to fear. She who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,\" she continued, rising with enthusiasm---\"she can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and Norman will contend who shall most do her honour.\"\n \"Thy speech is fair, lady,\" said Rebecca, \"and thy purpose fairer; but it may not be---there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our faith, alike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell---yet, ere I go indulge me one request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it, and let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.\"\n \"They are scarce worthy of being looked upon,\" said Rowena; \"but, expecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.\"\n She took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of beauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek, brow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also, but it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past slowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.\n \"Lady,\" she said, \"the countenance you have deigned to show me will long dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and goodness; and if a tinge of the world\u0027s pride or vanities may mix with an expression so lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some colour of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and bless God that I leave my noble deliverer united with---\"\n She stopped short---her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped them, and answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena ---\"I am well, lady---well. But my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists of Templestowe.---Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my duty, remains undischarged. Accept this casket---startle not at its contents.\"\n Rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet, or neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of immense value.\n \"It is impossible,\" she said, tendering back the casket. \"I dare not accept a gift of such consequence.\"\n \"Yet keep it, lady,\" returned Rebecca.---\"You have power, rank, command, influence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and weakness; the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not influence half so much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the gift is of little value,---and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let me not think you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe. Think ye that I prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty? or that my father values them in comparison to the honour of his only child? Accept them, lady---to me they are valueless. I will never wear jewels more.\"\n \"You are then unhappy!\" said Rowena, struck with the manner in which Rebecca uttered the last words. \"O, remain with us---the counsel of holy men will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to you.\"\n \"No, lady,\" answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her soft voice and beautiful features---\"that---may not be. I may not change the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I dedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.\"\n \"Have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?\" asked Rowena.\n \"No, lady,\" said the Jewess; \"but among our people, since the time of Abraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the sick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will Rebecca be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire after the fate of her whose life he saved.\"\n There was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca\u0027s voice, and a tenderness of accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have expressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.\n \"Farewell,\" she said. \"May He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower down on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us hence will be under weigh ere we can reach the port.\"\n She glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision had passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference to her husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and happily with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the bonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the recollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it would be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection of Rebecca\u0027s beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more frequently than the fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have approved.\n Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced with farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still higher, but for the premature death of the heroic Coeur-de-Lion, before the Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With the life of a generous, but rash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition and his generosity had formed; to whom may be applied, with a slight alteration, the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden---\n His fate was destined to a foreign strand, A petty fortress and an \"humble\" hand; He left the name at which the world grew pale, To point a moral, or adorn a TALE.\n \n 现在它像一则荒唐的故事一样结束了。\n 韦伯斯特(注)\n --------\n (注)约翰·韦伯斯特（约1580—1625），英国剧作家和诗人。\n 最初几分钟的惊异过去之后，艾文荷的威尔弗莱德向大宗师提出，他作为比武的裁判官，是否认为这次决斗是公正的，有效的。\n “是的，这次决斗是公正的，有效的，”大宗师答道。“现在我宣布该女子无罪释放。亡故的骑士的武器和遗体，可听凭胜利者处置。”\n “我不想没收他的武器，”艾文荷骑士说，“也不想侮辱他的尸体，因为他曾为基督教世界战斗过。今天是上帝的手，而不是人的手，把他打倒的。但是作为一个在非正义的争端中死去的人，他的丧礼只能秘密举行。至于这女子……”\n 但是一阵响亮的马蹄声打断了他的话，它由远而近，显得人数众多，来势凶猛，以致连地面都震动了。黑甲骑士最先冲进比武场，他后面是一大队骑兵，还有几个全身披挂的武士。\n “我来得太晚了，”他说，向周围看了一眼。“处死布瓦吉贝尔本来是我的权利。艾文荷，在你还不能骑马的时候，便采取这样的冒险行动，这做得对吗？”\n “陛下，上帝保佑，这个骄傲的人已经死了，”艾文荷答道。“这件事不必您亲自出马，他不配得到这种荣誉。”\n “好吧，如果他能安息，就让他安息吧，”理查说，对尸体端详了好一会。“他是一个勇敢的骑士，也是像骑士一样战死的。但是我们不能浪费时间。博亨，行使你的职责吧广\n 一个骑士从国王的随员中走了出来，把一只手按在艾伯特·马尔沃辛肩上，说道：“你因犯叛国罪被捕了。”\n 大宗师看到这么多武士出现，一时惊得目瞪口呆。现在他开口了：\n “谁敢在圣殿骑士团的会堂内，当着它的大宗师的面，逮捕它的骑士？是谁授予他这种胆大妄为的权利的？”\n “这是我逮捕的，”骑士答道。“我是埃塞克斯伯爵亨利·博亨，英国的警务总监。”\n “他逮捕马尔沃辛，是按照金雀花王朝的理查的命令行事，”国王说，揭开了面甲，“鄙人便是理查。康拉德·蒙特菲舍，你不是我的臣民，这是你的幸运。但是你，马尔沃辛，你得与你的弟兄菲利普一起，在一周内处死。”\n “我不承认你的判决，”大宗师说。\n “狂妄的圣殿骑士，”国王说，“你办不到；抬起头来看看，飘扬在你的城堡上的，已不是你的圣殿旗子，是英国国王的旗子了！放聪明一些，博马诺，不要作无益的反抗。你的手已落进狮子的嘴巴里。”\n “我得向罗马控告你，”大宗师说，“你侵犯了我们的特权，我们是不受世俗权力审问的。”\n “随你的便，”国王说。“但是为你自己着想，还是不要跟我讨价还价的好。解散你的会堂，带着你的仆从离开这里，如果你能找到一个没有参加过反对英国国玉的叛逆阴谋的会堂，你可以投奔那里。不过如果你愿意留下，我们可以接待你，我们的法律是公正的。”\n “在应该由我统治的地方作客人？”圣殿骑士说，“这永远办不到！教士们，唱起圣诗来：‘外邦为什么争闹？’(注)骑士们，扈从们，一切追随圣殿骑士团的人，准备跟随黑白旗出发吧！”\n --------\n (注)见《旧约·诗篇》第2篇，这篇诗是说要尊敬耶和华的受膏者，即教士，不得违抗他们。\n 大宗师讲话时显得那么威严，似乎要与英国国王分庭抗礼，这对那些困惑不解、垂头丧气的部下，起了鼓舞士气的作用。他们聚集在他周围，仿佛一群羊听到狼的嚎叫，围在牧羊狗的身边。但是他们并不像羊群那么惊慌失措，只是脸色阴沉，不甘屈服，目光中流露出他们不敢用言语表达的敌意。他们手执长枪，攒聚在一起，排成了长长的行列，骑士们的白长袍在这些随从们的黑制服旁边，仿佛乌云镶了一条条浅色的边。在场的群众本来吵吵闹闹，大声呵斥他们，现在不再作声，默默望着这伙身强力壮、久经沙场的武夫，后悔刚才不留意得罪了他们，纷纷退到后面去了。\n 埃塞克斯伯爵看到圣殿会堂的人这么严阵以待，立刻踢动坐骑，来回召集部下，准备对付这批强劲的敌人。唯独理查好像对自己挑起的这场危机，还颇为得意，骑着马在圣殿骑士的队伍前缓缓行去，大声喊道：“诸位，怎么样！瞧你们这副雄赳赳、气昂昂的样子，难道没有一个人敢与理查较量吗？圣殿骑士团的先生们！大概你们的夫人只是些黑皮肤女人，因此你们觉得不值得为她们的荣誉厮杀吧？”\n “圣殿的弟兄们，”大宗师把马骑到了他的队伍前面，开口道，“我们不为这种没有意义的、亵读神圣的争吵战斗。英国的理查，没有一个圣殿骑士会在我的面前与你交手。教皇和欧洲各国的君主会对我们的分歧作出裁决，说明你今天的挑衅行为是否符合一个基督教君主的身分。只要不遭到攻击，我们也不会攻击任何人，便离开这里。我们信任你，把骑士团的武器和家产留在这里；我们也相信你的良心，让它来惩罚你今天给予基督教世界的侮辱和损害吧。”\n 说完这些话，没有等待回答，大宗师便作了个出发的手势。他们的号角又发疯似的吹响了，那是一支东方的进行曲，通常是圣殿骑士发动攻势的号音。他们的行列从横队改成了纵队，然后让他们的马用尽可能缓慢的步子离开这里，仿佛表示，他们只是服从大宗师的命令，不是面对优势敌人的压力，心存畏惧，才不得不撤退的。\n “凭圣母的光辉起誓，”理查说道，“这些圣殿骑士受过良好的训练，作战英勇，可惜的是他们并不可靠。”\n 群众现在才对着离开比武场的队伍，发出了微弱的呐喊，像一只胆小的狗，直等它所仇恨的人转身走开之后，才开始吠叫。\n 圣殿骑士撤退时，场上一片混乱，人声嘈杂，但是丽贝卡什么也没看见，什么也没听到，她扑在年迈的父亲怀中嘤嘤吸泣，几乎没有意识到周围的迅速变化。只是以撒的一句话，才把她从凌乱的感觉中唤醒了。\n “我们走吧，”他说，“亲爱的女儿，我失而复得的宝贝……让我们去跪在那个善良的青年面前感谢他吧。”\n “不必这样，”丽贝卡说。“哦，不要这样，不要这样，我不能在这个时候去见他。唉！我要讲的话太多了……不，父亲，让我们立刻离开这个不祥的地方。”\n “但是，我的女儿，”以撒说，“他曾经像一个强壮的人那样，不顾自身的危险，拿起枪和盾牌来搭救你，何况你只是另一个民族——一个与他不同的民族的女儿，他的这种恩德是应该得到感谢的。”\n “是的，是的，应该得到感谢——最大的感谢，”丽贝卡说，“不仅如此……但不是现在……为了你所爱的拉雪儿，父亲，答应我的要求吧……不是现在！”\n “不，”以撒说，仍在坚持，“他们会认为我们忘恩负义，像一只狗！”\n “但是你看到，亲爱的父亲，理查工在这儿，他……”\n “真的，我的最好最聪明的丽贝卡。那么让我们离开吧，离开吧！他可能缺钱用涸为他刚从巴勒斯坦回来，而且据说，刚从监狱出来；如果他需要钱，我与他的兄弟约翰的简单往来便可能成为他的借口，向我勒索钱财。走吧，走吧，让我们离开这里！”\n 现在轮到他催促他的女儿了，他带着她走出比武场，坐上他准备在那儿的车子，把她安全地送往纳桑拉比的家。\n 这位犹太姑娘的命运，曾成为当天人们关心的焦点，现在她悄悄走了，却没人发觉，因为大家的注意力已转移到了黑甲骑士身上。他们这时正在大声呐喊：“狮心王理查万岁！打倒大逆不道的圣殿骑士！”\n “尽管有这些口头上的忠诚，”艾文荷对埃塞克斯伯爵说道，“王上采取了预防措施，把你和你这许多忠诚的部下带到这儿来，还是做得很对的，尊敬的伯爵。”\n 伯爵笑笑，摇了摇头。\n “英勇的艾文荷，”怕爵说，“你对我们的主公是相当了解的，你却以为他会采取这种明智的防范措施！事实是我听到约翰亲王打算在约克起事，这才带领队伍前往那里，半路上遇到了理查王，他跟一个游侠似的，正向这儿赶来，想靠他一个人单枪匹马，解决圣殿骑士和犹太姑娘的纠纷呢。我几乎是违抗了他的命令，才跟他来到这儿的。”\n “勇敢的伯爵，约克那边有什么消息？”艾文荷问。“叛乱分子还不死心吗？”\n “已经像十二月的雪遇到七月的太阳一样瓦解了，”伯爵说。“你猜，是谁赶来报告这消息的？不是别人，正是约翰本人！”\n “这个叛徒——忘恩负义、狂妄自大的喊子！”艾文荷说。“理查没有命令把他送进监牢吗？”\n “哪里！他接见了他，”伯爵答道，“好像打猎以后重又会面一般。他指着我和我的骑兵说道：‘你瞧，兄弟，我身边这些人都火气很大，你还是找我们的母亲吧，并代我向她请安；你就待在她那儿，等这些人的火气消了再说”’\n “他讲的全是这些话吗？”艾文荷问道。“人们岂不要说，这位国王这么不计前愆，无异在号召大家犯上作乱？”\n “你也差不多，”伯爵笑道，“人家会说，这个人重伤还没痊愈，便不顾危险参加决斗，无异在自己找死呢。”\n “你取笑我，我不计较，伯爵，”艾文荷答道，“但是不要忘记，我冒的只是我个人的生命危险，理查冒的险却有关国家的兴亡盛衰呢。”\n “不过，”埃塞克斯说道，“对个人的安危不关心的人，对别人的安危恐怕也是不会放在心上的。但是我们快进城堡去吧，因为理查虽然宽恕了阴谋的主犯，对它的一些从犯还是要惩罚的。”\n 这次事件以后进行的司法侦查，后来记载在《沃杜尔文稿》中，它大致如下：莫里斯·德布拉西逃到海外，投奔了法王腓力二世；菲利普·马尔沃辛和圣殿会堂会督艾伯特·马尔沃辛两兄弟被处死了；可是叛乱的核心人物沃尔德马·菲泽西只是遭到放逐，没有处死；约翰亲王虽然是发动叛乱的主犯，由于哥哥的宽大为怀，没有判罪。不过两位马尔沃辛的处死没有引起任何人的同情，他们作恶多端，残忍暴虐，现在明正典刑是他们罪有应得。\n 那次决斗之后不久，理查召见了撒克逊人塞德里克；为了安定人心，消除由于他的兄弟图谋不轨在几个郡里造成的混乱，他的朝廷当时驻在约克城内。塞德里克大为不满，几次拒绝奉召，但最后还是服从了。事实上，理查的回国，已使他在英国重建撒克逊王朝的一切希望成为泡影；因为很清楚，一旦内战爆发，不论撒克逊人如何奋不顾身，也无法推翻理查不可动摇的统治，这位国王的个人品德和军事声誉已深入人心，尽管他在政治上并无深谋远虑的方针，有时宽大无边，有时又接近专制独裁。\n 再说，塞德里克虽然并不甘心，也不能不看到，他企图通过罗文娜和阿特尔斯坦的联姻，使撒克逊人团结一致的计划，由于违背双方的心意，已到了难以为继的地步。确实，他一心向往的只是撒克逊民族的事业，这种情形不在他的考虑之中。哪怕双方并不情投意合已有了相当充分而明显的表现，他仍不愿相信，撒克逊王族的两支后裔会出于个人动机，不肯为民族的共同利益作出让步，同意他所主张的结合。但事实仍是事实。罗文娜始终表示不愿嫁给阿特尔斯坦，现在阿特尔斯坦也明确而坚定地声明，他决定放弃与罗文娜小姐的婚事。塞德里克诚然天性固执，遇到这些困难也只得低头认输，觉得自己像站在三岔路口拉住了两个人，一个要往左，一个要往右，他却拼命要把他们拉在一起。然而他还是对阿特尔斯坦发动了一次猛烈的最后攻击，可是他发现，这位起死回生的王族后裔，像我们今天的乡下小绅士一样，念念不忘的只是要与教士展开一场生死搏斗。\n 但是阿特尔斯坦在发出要把圣埃德蒙修道院长处死的威胁后，一方面由于他的性情天生懒散忠厚，另一方面也由于他的母亲伊迪丝的谏劝——当时的大多数妇人都对教士十分敬重——他的报复最后只是把修道院长和那些修士在科宁斯堡的地牢里关了三天，让他们尝尝靠面包和清水过活的滋味。为了这次暴行，修道院长威胁说要开除他的教籍，还把他和修士们在这次非法监禁中，因饮食不善而引起的各种肠胃病开列了一张长长的清单。这样，塞德里克发现，这些争执，以及为了对付教士的申诉，不得不采取的对策，已使他的朋友阿特尔斯坦忙得不亦乐乎，哪里还有工夫考虑别的问题。他一提到罗文娜的名字，尊贵的阿特尔斯坦便请他与他一起为她的健康干杯，祝她不久便与他的亲戚威尔弗莱德喜结良缘。由此看来，这件事已毫无指望。显然，要阿特尔斯坦有什么作为只是妄想，或者像汪八一样，借用那句从撒克逊时代一直流传到今天的话说，他只是一只不能打斗的公鸡。\n 这样，在塞德里克和两个情人要达到的目的之间，现在只剩了两道障碍：他自己的固执己见和他对诺曼王朝的憎恨。前一种情绪，在义女的体贴抚慰和儿子的名声在他心头引起的自豪感的影响下，逐渐消失了。再说，既然对忏悔者爱德华的后裔的最大希望已彻底破灭，他不能不意识到，让自己的儿子与阿尔弗烈德大王的后人联姻，这是他的家族的荣誉。同时，他对诺曼族国王的反感这时也大为削弱了——首先，要把新王朝赶出英国是不可能的，这种认识已深入人心，以致大家不得不对事实上的国王表示忠诚；其次，塞德里克的豪爽作风赢得了理查的好感，他对他十分关心，用《沃杜尔文稿》的话说，国王对这位高贵的撒克逊人总是优礼有加，以致他在他的宫中作客还不满七天，已同意他的义女罗文娜和他的儿子艾文荷结为伉俪。\n 我们这位主人公的婚礼，在得到父亲正式批准后，便在庄严的约克大教堂中举行了。国王亲自参加了婚礼，他在这次事件和其他一些事件中，对历经忧患，一直抬不起头的撒克逊人给予的礼遇，使他们看到了自己的前途，觉得他们的合法权利有了保障，这比通过变幻莫测的内战去争取，更加安全和可靠。教堂把这次婚礼办得十分隆重，凡是罗马教会所能提供的光辉仪式，无不应有尽有。\n 葛四穿着漂亮的衣服，作为少东家的扈从，也参加了婚礼，他始终对他忠心耿耿；高尚正直的汪八戴起了新帽子，还挂了一串光彩夺目的银铃铛。他们都与威尔弗莱德共过患难，现在自然也有权指望与他分享美好的前程。\n 但是除了家中这些仆从以外，前来参加这场热闹的婚礼的，还有出身高贵的诺曼人和撒克逊人，他们与身分较低的人在这里一起欢庆节日，这标志着两个人的婚姻已成了两个民族在未来和衷共济的保证；从那个时期起，它们便开始融为一体，不分彼此了。塞德里克一直活到了这种融合接近完成的时候；因为随着两个民族在社会上的混合和互相通婚，诺曼人不再像以前那么瞧不起撒克逊人，撒克逊人的乡愿习气也有了改进。但是直到爱德华三世统治时期，现在称作英语的那种混合语言，才在伦敦的朝廷上普遍使用，诺曼人和撒克逊人之间的敌对情绪也才完全消失。\n 在这幸福的婚礼举行后的次日早上，罗文娜小姐的侍女艾尔吉莎前来禀报，有一个姑娘要面见小姐，并单独与小姐谈话。罗文娜觉得奇怪，有些犹豫，又很想知道是怎么回事，最后命令让姑娘进来；待女走了。\n 姑娘走进了屋子，她显得高贵庄重，戴着一块长长的白面纱，它披到了她的身上，但没有遮没她文雅端庄、雍容华贵的形态，只是使它仿佛笼罩在一层淡淡的云雾中。她的举止是恭敬的，但丝毫不含有畏葸或诌媚的意味。罗文娜一向平易近人，温柔体贴。她站起身来，预备请这位可爱的客人就坐。但陌生的姑娘看了看艾尔吉莎，再次暗示她希望与罗文娜小姐单独谈话。艾尔吉莎刚迈着不大愿意的步子退出房间，艾文荷夫人便吃了一惊，那位漂亮的客人墓地屈下一膝，双手覆额，把头俯到地上，不顾罗文娜的拦阻，吻她衣襟下的花边。\n “小姐，这是什么意思？”新娘惊异地问，“为什么要向我行这不同寻常的大礼？”\n “因为，艾文荷夫人，”丽贝卡说，站起身子，恢复了平时娴雅庄重的神态，“艾文荷的威尔弗莱德对我有救命之恩，我相信我向您表示感谢是应该的，不会受到指责。请原谅我用我们民族的方式向您致敬，我是不幸的犹太人，您的丈夫不顾力量悬殊，在圣殿会堂的比武场上，为我冒了生命危险。”\n “姑娘，”罗文娜说，“你在艾文荷的威尔弗莱德负伤和被俘的时候，不遗余力照料他，为他治伤，他在圣殿会堂的行为只是对您的一点小小报答。请讲吧，你还有什么需要我们帮助的？”\n “没有了，”丽贝卡安详地说，“我只想请您向他转达我的问候和告别。”\n “那么你们要离开英国了？”罗文娜说，这次意外的访问使她再度引起了惊异。\n “是的，在这个月中就要离开英国。我的父亲有一个兄弟在格兰纳达(注)国王穆罕默德·鲍勃第尔那里很得到信任，我们便到那里去；只要照穆斯林的要求付一笔钱，我们便可以在那里安居乐业，得到保障了。”\n --------\n (注)中世纪在西班牙建立的一个伊斯兰王国。\n “那么你们在英国得不到保障吗？”罗文娜说。“我的丈夫是国王所信任的，而且国王本人也是公正而慷慨的。”\n “夫人，我不怀疑这点，”丽贝卡说。“但是英国的人民是好斗的民族，经常与邻国、或者在自己人中间争争吵吵，随时可能把剑刺进别人的心脏。这对于我的民族，不是一个安全的住所。以法莲是胆小的鸽子，以萨迦是辛劳过度的苦工，已给双重负担压得喘不出气(注)。在战争和流血的地方，在周围尽是敌人、内部又分崩离析的国家，以色列人不能指望安居乐业，不再过流离失所的生活。”\n --------\n (注)以法莲是约瑟的儿子，以萨迦是雅各的儿子，均见《旧约·创世记》，这里是泛指以色列人。\n “但是，姑娘，你无疑用不到担心这一切，”罗文娜说，接着又充满热情地说下去，“一个在艾文荷的病床旁照料过他的人，在英国是没有什么可害怕的，撒克逊人和诺曼人都会争着向你献殷勤呢。”\n “您讲得很动人，夫人，”丽贝卡说，“您的心意更加美好，但那是不可能的——我们中间隔着一条鸿沟。我们所受的教育，我们所信的宗教，都不允许我们跨越这条鸿沟。再见；然而在我走以前，请允许我提出一个要求。您用婚纱遮着脸，请您撩开它，让我看看您的脸，大家都夸奖您的美貌呢。”\n “那是不值得看的，”罗文娜说，“但我可以撩开它，同时希望你也这么做。”\n 这样，她撩开了面纱，一部分由于意识到自己的美丽，一部分也由于害羞，她涨红了脸，红晕从额头一直蔓延到了脖颈和胸口。丽贝卡也红了脸，但那只是一瞬间的事，在更崇高的感情的支配下，红晕便逐渐从她脸上消失，像火红的彩云随着太阳的落到地平线下，逐渐改变了颜色。\n “夫人，”她说，“您让我看到的脸，会永远留在我的记忆中。在您的脸上，我看到的是温柔和善良；如果说在这么可爱的一张脸上，也可看到一点世俗的骄傲或虚荣的影子，那么属于尘世的东西带有一点它原来的色彩，这又怎么可以责备呢？我会永远、永远记住您的容貌，感谢上帝让我尊贵的恩人娶到一位……”\n 她突然住口了——她的眼睛噙满了泪水。她匆匆擦掉了它们，对罗文娜的焦急询问答道：“我很好，夫人，很好，但是想到托奎尔斯通和圣殿会堂的比武场，我的心便怦怦直跳。再见。为了表达我的心意，还有一件小小的事没有做。请收下这小盒子，千万不要推辞。”\n 罗文娜打开镶银小盒子，看到了一串钻石项链和一副珠宝耳环，显然那是非常贵重的。\n “这不成，”她说，推回了首饰盒。“我不能接受这么珍贵的礼物。”\n “夫人，请您留下它，”丽贝卡答道。“您有权力、身分、地位和影响；我们有金钱，我们的力量和软弱都来源于此。这些小玩意儿的价值，哪怕增加十倍，也抵不上您一个小小的心愿那么值钱。因此这礼品对您是没有多大价值的，从我说来，我拿出这些东西更算不得什么。请您让我相信，您并不像您的同胞那样，把我的民族想得那么坏。您不会以为，我会把这些闪光的珠宝看得比我的自由更贵重，或者我的父亲会把它们的价值看得比他独生女儿的荣誉更贵重吧？请收下这些东西吧，夫人，——对于我，它们是没有价值的。我再也不会戴珠宝了。”\n “那么你并不愉快！”罗文娜说，听到丽贝卡的最后那句话，有些吃惊。“啊，留在这儿吧，我们的教士会帮助你，让你离开错误的道路，我可以与你结成姊妹。”\n “不，夫人，”丽贝卡答道，她柔和的声音和美丽的脸蛋始终显得那么安详而忧郁，“那是不可能的。我不能改变我祖先的信仰，这不是一件衣服，不适合我要居住的地方的气候，便可以脱掉。夫人，我今后不会不愉快。我把我未来的生命献给了主，只要我照他的旨意做，他会给我安慰的。”\n “那么你是打算进修道院——你们也有修道院吗？”罗文娜问。\n “没有，夫人，”犹太姑娘说道，“但是在我们的人民中，从亚伯拉罕的时代起，便有一些妇女，她们想的只是上帝，她们做的只是对人的善行——照料病人，救济饥饿的人，帮助贫苦的人。丽贝卡将成为这些人中的一个。如果您的丈夫问起他所搭救的这个人的情形，请您这么告诉他。”\n 丽贝卡的声音不禁有些发抖，口气变得温情脉脉，这也许泄露了她所不愿表达的一种心情。于是她赶紧向罗文娜告别。\n “再见，”她说。“上帝同样创造了犹太人和基督徒，愿他把他最好的祝福赐给您吧！我们的船即将启航，我们必须及早赶往港口。”\n 她轻轻走出了屋子，罗文娜望着她的背影，诧异不止，觉得好像做了一场梦。这位撒克逊美女后来把这次奇怪的会见告诉了丈夫，这给他留下了深刻的印象。他与罗文娜度过了漫长而幸福的一生，因为他们从小就心心相印，想起那些阻碍他们结合的经历，只是使他们更加相亲相爱。然而对美丽而高尚的丽贝卡的回忆，有没有时常涌上他的心头，超过了阿尔弗烈德的那位美丽后裔所愿意的程度，那就不得而知了。\n 艾文荷在理查的朝廷上功绩卓著，一再得到国王的嘉奖和恩赏。他本来还可以继续升迁，可惜英勇的狮心王，不久就在利摩日附近的查卢兹城堡前阵亡了(注1)。随着这位国王丰富多采、但是鲁莽而浪漫的一生的结束，他的雄心壮志和宽宏大量所构想的一切计划，也都付之东流了。关于这个人，约翰逊(注2)为瑞典国王查理所写的几行诗，只要稍加改动，便可应用在他的身上：\n 命运注定他要奔走在异国的土地上，\n 为小小的城堡和微末的权力捐献生命；\n 他留下的威名足以令全世界惊骇，\n 它发人深省，又是一篇色彩斑调的故事。\n --------\n (注1)狮心王理查在与法王腓力二世的战斗中，于1199年在法国利摩日附近中箭身亡。\n
