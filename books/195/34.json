{"id":6125,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"Trust me each state must have its policies: Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters; Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk, Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline; For not since Adam wore his verdant apron, Hath man with man in social union dwelt, But laws were made to draw that union closer. Old Play\n The daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn from the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood, and no huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he paced at the head of the antler\u0027d herd.\n The outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves after the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many with hearing and recounting the events of the day, and computing the heaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their Chief.\n The spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing, had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. Yet so strict were the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any part of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the disposal of their leader.\n The place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which Locksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the story, but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a mile of the demolished castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley assumed his seat---a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. He assigned to the Black Knight a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a place upon his left.\n \"Pardon my freedom, noble sirs,\" he said, \"but in these glades I am monarch---they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck but little of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to mortal man.---Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our curtal Friar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.\"---No one had seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. \"Over gods forbode!\" said the outlaw chief, \"I trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a thought too late. Who saw him since the castle was ta\u0027en?\"\n \"I,\" quoth the Miller, \"marked him busy about the door of a cellar, swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of Front-de-Boeuf\u0027s Gascoigne wine.\"\n \"Now, the saints, as many as there be of them,\" said the Captain, \"forefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished by the fall of the castle!---Away, Miller!---take with you enow of men, seek the place where you last saw him---throw water from the moat on the scorching ruins ---I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my curtal Friar.\"\n The numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.\n \"Meanwhile, let us proceed,\" said Locksley; \"for when this bold deed shall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and other allies of Front-de-Boeuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well for our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.---Noble Cedric,\" he said, turning to the Saxon, \"that spoil is divided into two portions; do thou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people who were partakers with us in this adventure.\"\n \"Good yeoman,\" said Cedric, \"my heart is oppressed with sadness. The noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more---the last sprout of the sainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never return!---A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human breath can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me, do but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last mansion. The Lady Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must be escorted by a sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now, have left this place; and I waited---not to share the booty, for, so help me God and Saint Withold! as neither I nor any of mine will touch the value of a liard,---I waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold yeomen, for the life and honour ye have saved.\"\n \"Nay, but,\" said the chief Outlaw, \"we did but half the work at most---take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and followers.\"\n \"I am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,\" answered Cedric.\n \"And some,\" said Wamba, \"have been wise enough to reward themselves; they do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear motley.\"\n \"They are welcome,\" said Locksley; \"our laws bind none but ourselves.\"\n \"But, thou, my poor knave,\" said Cedric, turning about and embracing his Jester, \"how shall I reward thee, who feared not to give thy body to chains and death instead of mine!---All forsook me, when the poor fool was faithful!\"\n A tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke---a mark of feeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.\n \"Nay,\" said the Jester, extricating himself from master\u0027s caress, \"if you pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester must weep for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?---But, uncle, if you would indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.\"\n \"Pardon him!\" exclaimed Cedric; \"I will both pardon and reward him.---Kneel down, Gurth.\"---The swineherd was in an instant at his master\u0027s feet---\"THEOW and ESNE*\n * Thrall and bondsman.\n art thou no longer,\" said Cedric touching him with a wand; \"FOLKFREE and SACLESS*\n * A lawful freeman.\n art thou in town and from town, in the forest as in the field. A hide of land I give to thee in my steads of Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee and thine aye and for ever; and God\u0027s malison on his head who this gainsays!\"\n No longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his feet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground. \"A smith and a file,\" he cried, \"to do away the collar from the neck of a freeman!---Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and doubly will I fight for you!---There is a free spirit in my breast---I am a man changed to myself and all around.---Ha, Fangs!\" he continued,---for that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump upon him, to express his sympathy,---\"knowest thou thy master still?\"\n \"Ay,\" said Wamba, \"Fangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us and thyself.\"\n \"I shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,\" said Gurth; \"and were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not let thee want it.\"\n \"Nay,\" said Wamba, \"never think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf sits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of battle---And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury---Better a fool at a feast than a wise man at a fray.\"\n The tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared, surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her freedom. She herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. Her lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past deliverance---She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that Athelstane was dead. The former assurance filled her with the most sincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter, she might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been contradicted by her guardian Cedric.\n As Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley\u0027s seat, that bold yeoman, with all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand, and bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in few but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to Locksley and her other deliverers.---\"God bless you, brave men,\" she concluded, \"God and Our Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling yourselves in the cause of the oppressed!---If any of you should hunger, remember Rowena has food---if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and brown ale---and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena has forests of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.\"\n \"Thanks, gentle lady,\" said Locksley; \"thanks from my company and myself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the greenwood do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena\u0027s deliverance may be received as an atonement.\"\n Again bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a moment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave, she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood under a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast, and Rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up, however, and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame suffused his handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute; then, stepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before her.\n \"Will the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye---on a captive knight ---on a dishonoured soldier?\"\n \"Sir Knight,\" answered Rowena, \"in enterprises such as yours, the real dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.\"\n \"Conquest, lady, should soften the heart,\" answered De Bracy; \"let me but know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an ill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to serve her in nobler ways.\"\n \"I forgive you, Sir Knight,\" said Rowena, \"as a Christian.\"\n \"That means,\" said Wamba, \"that she does not forgive him at all.\"\n \"But I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has occasioned,\" continued Rowena.\n \"Unloose your hold on the lady\u0027s rein,\" said Cedric, coming up. \"By the bright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to the earth with my javelin---but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de Bracy, for thy share in this foul deed.\"\n \"He threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,\" said De Bracy; \"but when had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?\"\n Then retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.\n Cedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to Rotherwood.\n \"I know,\" he said, \"that ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but war is a changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the champion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the halls of Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the injuries of fortune, and all he has is his deliverer\u0027s---Come, therefore, to Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.\"\n \"Cedric has already made me rich,\" said the Knight,---\"he has taught me the value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave Saxon, and that speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from your halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as will put even thy generosity to the test.\"\n \"It is granted ere spoken out,\" said Cedric, striking his ready hand into the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,---\"it is granted already, were it to affect half my fortune.\"\n \"Gage not thy promise so lightly,\" said the Knight of the Fetterlock; \"yet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile, adieu.\"\n \"I have but to say,\" added the Saxon, \"that, during the funeral rites of the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his castle of Coningsburgh---They will be open to all who choose to partake of the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith, mother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who laboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from Norman chains and Norman steel.\"\n \"Ay, ay,\" said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master, \"rare feeding there will be---pity that the noble Athelstane cannot banquet at his own funeral.---But he,\" continued the Jester, lifting up his eyes gravely, \"is supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour to the cheer.\"\n \"Peace, and move on,\" said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being checked by the recollection of Wamba\u0027s recent services. Rowena waved a graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock ---the Saxon bade God speed him, and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.\n They had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and took the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of a neighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or \"soul-scat\", which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which the body of Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly and slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of Coningsburgh, to be there deposited in the grave of Hengist, from whom the deceased derived his long descent. Many of his vassals had assembled at the news of his death, and followed the bier with all the external marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws arose, and paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which they had so lately rendered to beauty ---the slow chant and mournful step of the priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had fallen in the yesterday\u0027s array. But such recollections dwell not long with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound of the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in the distribution of their spoil.\n \"Valiant knight,\" said Locksley to the Black Champion, \"without whose good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed, will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?\"\n \"I accept the offer,\" said the Knight, \"as frankly as it is given; and I ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own pleasure.\"\n \"He is thine already,\" said Locksley, \"and well for him! else the tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his Free-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around him.---But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my father.\"\n \"De Bracy,\" said the Knight, \"thou art free---depart. He whose prisoner thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But beware of the future, lest a worse thing befall thee. ---Maurice de Bracy, I say BEWARE!\"\n De Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud knight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form to its full height, and exclaimed, \"Peace, ye yelping curs! who open upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay---De Bracy scorns your censure as he would disdain your applause. To your brakes and caves, ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or noble is but spoken within a league of your fox-earths.\"\n This ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of arrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw Chief. Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several which had been taken in the stables of Front-de-Boeuf stood accoutred around, and were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon the saddle, and galloped off through the wood.\n When the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the chief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had recently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.\n \"Noble knight.\" he said to him of the Fetterlock, \"if you disdain not to grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has once worn, this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearing---and if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant knight, ye chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind three mots*\n * The notes upon the bugle were anciently called mots, and * are distinguished in the old treatises on hunting, not by * musical characters, but by written words.\n upon the horn thus, \u0027Wa-sa-hoa!\u0027 and it may well chance ye shall find helpers and rescue.\"\n He then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call which be described, until the knight had caught the notes.\n \"Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,\" said the Knight; \"and better help than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost need.\" And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood rang.\n \"Well blown and clearly,\" said the yeoman; \"beshrew me an thou knowest not as much of woodcraft as of war!---thou hast been a striker of deer in thy day, I warrant.---Comrades, mark these three mots---it is the call of the Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens not to serve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with his own bowstring.\"\n \"Long live our leader!\" shouted the yeomen, \"and long live the Black Knight of the Fetterlock!---May he soon use our service, to prove how readily it will be paid.\"\n Locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he performed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the whole was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for the souls of such as had left no surviving family. The rest was divided amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment of the Chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred, was delivered with great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. The Black Knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a state so lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably governed, and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice and judgment of their leader.\n When each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the treasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the portion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.\n \"I would,\" said the leader, \"we could hear tidings of our joyous chaplain---he was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed, or spoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes of our successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover some of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his a prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to help me to deal with him in due sort---I greatly misdoubt the safety of the bluff priest.\"\n \"I were right sorry for that,\" said the Knight of the Fetterlock, \"for I stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in his cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn some tidings of him.\"\n While they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the arrival of him for whom they feared, as they learned from the stentorian voice of the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.\n \"Make room, my merry-men!\" he exclaimed; \"room for your godly father and his prisoner---Cry welcome once more.---I come, noble leader, like an eagle with my prey in my clutch.\"---And making his way through the ring, amidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph, his huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent down by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who shouted aloud, \"Where is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or if it were but a lay?---By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever out of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!\"\n \"Curtal Priest,\" said the Captain, \"thou hast been at a wet mass this morning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast thou got here?\"\n \"A captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,\" replied the Clerk of Copmanhurst; \"to my bow and to my halberd, I should rather say; and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity. Speak, Jew---have I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?---have I not taught thee thy \u0027credo\u0027, thy \u0027pater\u0027, and thine \u0027Ave Maria\u0027?---Did I not spend the whole night in drinking to thee, and in expounding of mysteries?\"\n \"For the love of God!\" ejaculated the poor Jew, \"will no one take me out of the keeping of this mad---I mean this holy man?\"\n \"How\u0027s this, Jew?\" said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; \"dost thou recant, Jew?---Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thine infidelity, though thou are not so tender as a suckling pig---I would I had one to break my fast upon---thou art not too tough to be roasted! Be conformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. \u0027Ave Maria\u0027!---\"\n \"Nay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,\" said Locksley; \"let us rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.\"\n \"By Saint Dunstan,\" said the Friar, \"I found him where I sought for better ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued there; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an evening\u0027s drought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so much good liquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and was coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to seek when a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong door---Aha! thought I, here is the choicest juice of all in this secret crypt; and the knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left the key in the door ---In therefore I went, and found just nought besides a commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently rendered himself my prisoner, rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh myself after the fatigue of the action, with the unbeliever, with one humming cup of sack, and was proceeding to lead forth my captive, when, crash after crash, as with wild thunder-dint and levin-fire, down toppled the masonry of an outer tower, (marry beshrew their hands that built it not the firmer!) and blocked up the passage. The roar of one falling tower followed another---I gave up thought of life; and deeming it a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in company with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but I took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down the partisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And truly, by the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been sown in good soil; only that, with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole night, and being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughts of sack which I sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is well-nigh dizzied, I trow.---But I was clean exhausted.---Gilbert and Wibbald know in what state they found me ---quite and clean exhausted.\"\n \"We can bear witness,\" said Gilbert; \"for when we had cleared away the ruin, and by Saint Dunstan\u0027s help lighted upon the dungeon stair, we found the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar more than half---exhausted, as he calls it.\"\n \"Ye be knaves! ye lie!\" retorted the offended Friar; \"it was you and your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your morning draught---I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain\u0027s own throat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I have told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.\"\n \"Jew,\" said the Captain, \"is this true? hast thou renounced thine unbelief?\"\n \"May I so find mercy in your eyes,\" said the Jew, \"as I know not one word which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night. Alas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had our holy father Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf listener.\"\n \"Thou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.\" said the Friar; \"I will remind thee of but one word of our conference---thou didst promise to give all thy substance to our holy Order.\"\n \"So help me the Promise, fair sirs,\" said Isaac, even more alarmed than before, \"as no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged beggar\u0027d man---I fear me a childless---have ruth on me, and let me go!\"\n \"Nay,\" said the Friar, \"if thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy Church, thou must do penance.\"\n Accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of it lustily on the Jew\u0027s shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the blow, and thereby transferred the Holy Clerk\u0027s resentment to himself.\n \"By Saint Thomas of Kent,\" said he, \"an I buckle to my gear, I will teach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre thine iron case there!\"\n \"Nay, be not wroth with me,\" said the Knight; \"thou knowest I am thy sworn friend and comrade.\"\n \"I know no such thing,\" answered the Friar; \"and defy thee for a meddling coxcomb!\"\n \"Nay, but,\" said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking his quondam host, \"hast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for I say nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break thy vow of fast and vigil?\"\n \"Truly, friend,\" said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, \"I will bestow a buffet on thee.\"\n \"I accept of no such presents,\" said the Knight; \"I am content to take thy cuff*\n * Note H. Richard Coeur-de-Lion.\n as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner there exacted in his traffic.\"\n \"I will prove that presently,\" said the Friar.\n \"Hola!\" cried the Captain, \"what art thou after, mad Friar? brawling beneath our Trysting-tree?\"\n \"No brawling,\" said the Knight, \"it is but a friendly interchange of courtesy.---Friar, strike an thou darest---I will stand thy blow, if thou wilt stand mine.\"\n \"Thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,\" said the churchman; \"but have at thee---Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath of Gath in his brazen helmet.\"\n The Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full strength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled an ox. But his adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by all the yeomen around; for the Clerk\u0027s cuff was proverbial amongst them, and there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to know its vigour.\n \"Now, Priest,\" said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, \"if I had vantage on my head, I will have none on my hand---stand fast as a true man.\"\n \"\u0027Genam meam dedi vapulatori\u0027---I have given my cheek to the smiter,\" said the Priest; \"an thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow, I will freely bestow on thee the Jew\u0027s ransom.\"\n So spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But who may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such strength and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon the plain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. But he arose neither angry nor crestfallen.\n \"Brother,\" said he to the Knight, \"thou shouldst have used thy strength with more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst broken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops. Nevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will exchange no more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End now all unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard will not change his spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.\"\n \"The Priest,\" said Clement, \"is not half so confident of the Jew\u0027s conversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.\"\n \"Go to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?---what, is there no respect?---all masters and no men?---I tell thee, fellow, I was somewhat totty when I received the good knight\u0027s blow, or I had kept my ground under it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can give as well as take.\"\n \"Peace all!\" said the Captain. \"And thou, Jew, think of thy ransom; thou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in all Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a prisoner of another cast.\"\n \"Were many of Front-de-Boeuf\u0027s men taken?\" demanded the Black Knight.\n \"None of note enough to be put to ransom,\" answered the Captain; \"a set of hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a new master---enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them were not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty---a jolly monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear and wearing apparel.---Here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a pyet.\" And, between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of the outlaw Chief, our old friend, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.\n \n 相信我，每个国家必须有它的政策：\n 王国有敕令．城市有规章，\n 哪怕桀骜不驯的强盗在他们的山林里，\n 也得保持一定的公共纪律；\n 因为自从亚当穿上青草的围裙，\n 人与人就得在一起共同生活，\n 只有法律才能维护社会的稳固。\n 古戏剧\n 曙光照到了栎树林中的空地上。绿油油的枝树还挂满闪光的露珠。牝鹿带着它的孩子钻出茂密的树丛，来到了比较空旷的草地上，公鹿率领着它带角的家族在林中自在倘徉，暂时还不必担心猎人的窥伺和袭击。\n 强盗们全都到了，聚集在哈特山林区的约会树周围；经过攻打城堡的战斗，他们累了，在那里休息和过夜——有的喝酒，有的睡觉，也有不少人在回顾和叙述白天的经历，估计着那一堆堆胜利果实的价值，等待着首领的分配。\n 战利品确实不少，因为尽管许多东西已化为灰烬，大量的金银器皿、贵重的盔甲和豪华的衣饰，还是被那些无所畏惧的强盗抢救了出来，在这样的收获面前，他们是任何危险都吓不倒的。然而团体的纪律是严格的，没有人敢冒大不匙，私自吞没任何一件东西，现在它们全都汇集在这儿，听候首领的处置。\n 集合地点是在一棵老栎树周围，但不是这故事以前提到过的，洛克斯利带葛四和汪人去过的那个地方，而是在一片森林环抱的盆地中央，离他们摧毁的托奎尔斯通城堡不到半英里。洛克斯利坐在大栎树的绿荫下，一个草皮覆盖的土墩上，他的部下集合在他的周围。他让黑甲骑士坐在他的右边，塞德里克坐在他的左边。\n “请原谅我的无礼，尊贵的先生们，”他说，“但是在这些草坪上我是国王，它们是我的王国；要是我在我的国土上，把我的位置让给别人，我那些粗野的臣民就会藐视我的权威。现在，各位，谁看到过我们的随军教士啦？我们那位不修边幅的修士跑哪儿去啦？在基督徒中间，忙碌的一天开始以前，最好先做一次祈祷。”没有人看到科普曼赫斯特的教士。“但愿不要出事！”头领说，“我相信，快活的教士一定找到了酒，舍不得走开了。攻下城堡以后，谁见到过他？”\n “我见到过他，”磨坊掌柜说，“他正忙着要打开地窖的门，还搬出了历书上每个圣徒的名字发誓，说他非得尝尝牛面将军藏的名酒不可。”\n “好吧，但愿那么多的圣徒都能保护他，”首领说，“别让他醉得不省人事，给坍下的城堡压死卜快去，磨坊老板，马上带几个人到你最后看到他的地方，用壕沟里的水浇灭还在燃烧的废墟；哪怕把石头一块块搬开，也得找到我们那位胡闹的修士。”\n 尽管分配战利品是人人关心的事，它即将开始，许多人还是自告奋勇，愿意去执行这任务，他们匆匆走了，由此可见，神父的安全在大家心目中多么重要。\n “现在我们继续开会，”洛克斯利说，“因为这次大胆的行动传到外边，德布拉西的部队，马尔沃辛的部队，还有牛面将军的其他狐群狗党，马上都会出动，攻打我们，为了防备万一，我们得尽快撤出这一带地方。尊贵的塞德里克，”他转身向撒克逊人说，“你手下不少人与我们一起参加了这次军事行动，现在我们把战利品分成两部分，随你挑选你认为合适的一份，用它犒劳你的那些人。”\n “我的好庄户人，”塞德里克说，“现在我心乱如麻，十分沉重。科宁斯堡的尊贵的阿特尔斯坦去世了，神圣的忏悔者已经没有后代！我们的希望也随着他一去不复返了！火种被他的血浇灭了，任何人也不能使它重新燃烧了。我的人，除了现在身边的这几个，都在等我，要把他的遗体运回他家的坟地。罗文娜小姐也急于返回罗瑟伍德，得有足够的力量护送她。因此我早应该离开这儿了，我还待在这儿，不是为了分战利品，因为蒙上帝和圣维索尔特保佑，不论我和我手下的人都不需要这些财富——我留下是为了向你和你的勇敢战士，表示我的谢意，因为是你们挽救了我的生命和荣誉。”\n “不成，”首领说道，“这件事我们至多只有一半功劳，把战利品拿去，你可以用它们犒赏你的乡亲和部下。”\n “我有足够的钱，可以用我的财物犒劳他们，”塞德里克答道。\n “我们有些人相当聪明，”汪八插嘴道，“他们早已犒劳过自己了，他们不会空着双手回去。我们不全是穿彩衣的傻瓜。”\n “那很好，”洛克斯利说，“我们的规矩只约束我们自己人。”\n “啊，我可怜的奴仆，”塞德里克转过身去拥抱小丑，“我应该怎么报答你才好呀，你不顾自己的性命，套上锁链，愿意替我去死；我失去了一切希望，但是你，可怜的孩子，你仍对我那么忠心！”\n 在他讲的时候，泪水涌上了他的眼睛，这个粗鲁的庄主表现的这种感伤情绪，是连阿特尔斯坦的死也没有引起的；他的小丑那种一半出自本能的对他的依恋，深深感动了他，它唤起的不仅仅是悲伤。\n “别这样，”小丑说，挣脱了主人的怀抱，“如果你用眼泪报答我，我只得陪你一道啼哭了，这跟我小丑的身分怎么相称呢？不过，老爷子，如果你真的要让我高兴，那么我求你饶恕了我的伙伴葛四吧，他从你身边溜走了一个星期，只是为了去侍候你的儿子。”\n “饶恕他！”塞德里克大声说道，“我不仅要饶恕他，还要酬谢他呢。跪下吧，葛四，”放猪的马上跪到了主人的脚边。“从现在起你不再是奴隶和家仆，”塞德里克说，用一根棒作为权标按在他的身上，“不论在镇上和镇外，在森林中和田野上，你都是自由民，一个独立的人。我把我沃尔布鲁姆领地上的一块土地授予你，它永远归你所有。谁反对的话，让上帝惩罚他吧！”\n 不再是奴隶，而是自由人和土地的所有人，这使葛四高兴得跳了起来，跳得几乎比他本人还高。\n “铁匠和挫刀，”他嚷道，“把这颈圈从自由人的脖子上拿走！高贵的主人，你的礼物使我的力气增加了一倍，我要加倍地为你战斗！我的身体里有了一个自由的灵魂，对我自己和我周围的一切说来，我都变了。哈，方斯！”他继续道，因为那只忠诚的狗看到它的主人这么高兴，扑到了他身上，表示它的同情，“你还认识你的主人吗？”\n “对，”汪八说道，“方斯和我还认识你，葛四，尽管我们还得套着颈圈；除非你才会忘记我们和你自己。”\n “确实，除非我忘记了自己，我才会忘记你，我的好朋友，”葛四说。“不过，只要你想得到自由，汪八，主人是不会不让你得到它的。”\n “不，”汪八说，“别以为我是在羡慕你，葛四老哥；奴隶坐在大厅里烤火的时候，自由人却得上战场打仗。马姆斯伯里的奥尔德海姆(注)也是那么说的，他说：与其做一个聪明人去打仗，不如做一个傻瓜去喝酒。’”\n --------\n (注)奥尔德海姆（约639—709），英国教士，以学识渊博闻名，一生著作甚多，马姆斯伯里隐修院的创建人。\n 这时传来了一阵马蹄声，罗文娜小姐出现了，几个骑马的人和一大群步行的人跟随着她，大家兴高采烈，为她的获得自由挥动着长枪和铁叉。她自己也穿得雍容华贵，骑在一匹深栗色马上，恢复了原来的庄严神态，只是脸色比平时苍白一些，显示了她这几天的苦难经历。她的可爱容貌虽有些忧郁，但那神色说明，她对未来重又萌发了希望，对最近的得救也充满了衷心的感激。她知道艾文荷安然无恙，她也知道阿特尔斯坦死了。第一个消息使她从心底里感到庆幸，第二个消息也许不能使她完全高兴，但是她意识到，在她和她的监护人塞德里克之间引起分歧的那个问题，终于消失了，她不必再为它耿耿于怀，那么这种如释重负的心情也是可以理解的。\n 罗文娜把马骑向洛克斯利的座位，勇敢的庄户人和他的全体部下马上站起来迎接她，仿佛这种礼貌是他们的本能。她向他们挥手致意，又低低俯下身去，以致那美丽和松散的鬈发一时间几乎碰到了飘拂的马鬃毛；在她讲话时，红晕涌上了她的面颊，她的话简单扼要，表达了对洛克斯利和一切搭救她的人的感激和谢忱，最后她说：“上帝保佑你们，勇士们；你们为被迫害者出生入死的英勇行为，会得到上帝和圣母的酬报！你们中间的任何人在饥饿的时候，别忘记罗文娜这里有食物，在口渴的时候，别忘记她这里有大桶大桶的酒，在诺曼人把你们赶出这些森林的时候，别忘记罗文娜有她自己的森林，搭救她的勇士可以在那里自由来去，没有人会指责他们用箭射死了那里的鹿。”\n “我感谢你，好心的小姐，”洛克斯利说，“也代表我的朋友们感谢你。其实搭救你对我们说来，只是一种补偿。我们这些生活在森林中的人，干过许多越轨的行动，搭救罗文娜小姐可以算作是将功补过。”\n 罗文娜在马上俯首答礼，然后转身离开，但又停了一会，等塞德里克告辞后与她同行；这时她突然发现，俘虏德布拉西就在她的附近。他站在一棵树下，正合抱着双手，在低头沉思；罗文娜本想不让他看到，便走过去。然而他抬起了头，发现她在他面前，于是羞涩的红晕布满了他那张漂亮的脸。他犹豫了一会，然后向前走来，拉住她的马缰绳，跪下了一条腿。\n “罗文娜小姐愿意看一眼被俘的骑士，一个可耻的战士吗？”\n “骑士阁下，”罗文娜答道，“对于你们干的那些勾当说来，失败并不可耻，成功才是可耻的。”\n “小姐，胜利可以使人心肠变软，”德布拉西答道，“我不知道，罗文娜小姐是否能宽恕我一时感情用事犯下的错误，但她不久就会明白，德布拉西是知道怎么用更高尚的方式对待她的。”\n “我原谅你，骑士阁下，”罗文娜说，“作为一个基督徒原谅你。”\n “那是说，她根本没有原谅他，”汪八在旁边插嘴道。\n “但是我决不能宽恕你们的暴行所造成的灾难和祸害，”罗文娜继续道。\n “松开你的手，不要拉住缰绳，”塞德里克走上前来说道。“凭天上明亮的太阳起誓，要不是不值得与你计较，我会用梭镖把你钉死在地上；但是你要记住，莫里斯·德布拉西，你插手的这桩肮脏勾当，迟早会使你得到报应。”\n “恐吓俘虏是威胁他的安全，”德布拉西说，“什么时候撒克逊人才能懂得一点礼貌呢？”\n 于是他退后两步，让罗文娜通过了。\n 塞德里克在离开以前，特地向黑甲骑士表示了他的感谢，真诚地要求他与他一同前往罗瑟伍德。\n “我知道，”他说，“你们漫游各地的骑士指望靠枪尖开拓自己的命运，不把土地和财富放在眼里；但战争是一位变化莫测的情人，哪怕是一个到处流浪的勇士，有时也会需要一个家。你在罗瑟伍德庄园上已赢得了一个家，尊贵的骑士。塞德里克有足够的财富，可以医治命运给你的创伤，他的一切也就是他的搭救者的。因此，请你到罗瑟伍德来吧，不是作为客人，是作为一个儿子或者弟兄到我家中来。”\n “塞德里克已使我变得富裕了，”骑士说，“他让我知道了撒克逊人的高尚品质的价值。我会到罗瑟伍德来的，勇敢的撒克逊人，而且是在不久的将来；但是目前，许多急待进行的事，使我不能立刻前去拜访。也许到那时，我向你要求的恩惠，甚至对你的慷慨也是一种考验呢。”\n “我答应你，不论那是什么，”塞德里克说，立刻把手接到了黑甲骑士戴铁手套的掌心中，“我一定照办，哪怕这要牺牲我的一半家产。”\n “不要轻易许诺，”那位用镣铐作标志的骑士说道，“当然，我希望我要求的恩惠能如愿以偿。现在，再见吧。”\n “我还有一句话，”塞德里克又道，“在高贵的阿特尔斯坦的葬礼期间，我要前往科宁斯堡，作为一个客人暂时住在他的庄园上。它对一切人公开，凡是愿意参加丧宴的都可以去；现在我以故世亲王的母亲，尊贵的伊迪丝的名义邀请你，我相信，为了从诺曼人的铁链和诺曼人的刀枪下拯救阿特尔斯坦而英勇战斗的人，尽管他没有成功，也一定会受到欢迎的。”\n “对，对，”汪八说，他又来到了主人身边，“到时候一定有许多山珍海味，只可惜阿特尔斯坦大人不能亲自品尝了。不过，”小丑继续道，庄严地望着天空，“他现在一定在天上喝酒，吃得津津有味呢。”\n “别乱讲，快走，”塞德里克说，他对这不合时宜的玩笑十分恼火，但想到汪八最近的贡献，克制了愤怒。罗文娜向黑甲骑士挥手告别，撒克逊人也祝他得到上帝的保佑，然后他们走出了森林中的这片草地。\n 他们刚离开不久，一队人突然从树林中徐徐出现，绕过圆形盆地，朝着罗文娜等人的方向走去。原来塞德里克向附近一所修道院许诺了丰厚的布施，或者安魂弥撒费，因此它的教士全部出动了，跟在阿特尔斯坦的柜车后面，用悲哀而迂缓的调子唱着赞美诗；柩车由阿特尔斯坦的侍从们护卫，正要送往他的城堡科宁斯堡，然后埋葬在他的祖先亨吉斯特家族的墓地上。听到他的死讯，他的许多藩臣都来了，他们跟在灵枢后面，至少都保持着忧伤和哀悼的外表。强盗们又都站了起来，向死者表示了简单而自然的敬意，就像刚才向那位美女表示的一样。教士的低沉歌声和哀伤步态，从他们心头唤回了对昨天战斗中倒下的伙伴们的思念。但是对于这些生活在危险和厮杀中的人们，那样的回忆是不可能维持多久的，挽歌的声音还没随着微风飘散，他们又忙于分配战利品了。\n “勇敢的骑士，”洛克斯利向黑甲骑士说道，“没有你的好心和大力帮助，我们这次行动便不可能成功，现在请你从这大量战利品中任意挑选，喜欢什么就拿什么，这也是为我们在这棵约会树下的合作留个纪念。”\n “你们的好意是坦率的，我也坦率地表示接受，”骑士说，“我希望你们把处置莫里斯·德布拉西的权利交给我。”\n “他已经属于你了，”洛克斯利说，“这是他的幸运！否则这个恶霸早给吊在这棵栎树的最高一根树枝上了，他的自由团队中凡是落到我们手中的人，都得像槲果一样，吊在他周围的树枝上，但他是你的俘虏，他安全了，尽管他杀死过我的父亲。”\n “德布拉西，”骑士说道，“你自由了，走吧。俘虏你的人不想用低劣的报复手段对待过去的事。但是今后请你当心，别让更坏的事落到你的身上。莫里斯·德布拉西，听清楚了：当心！”\n 德布拉西向他深深鞠躬，没有说话；他正要离开，老乡们突然爆发了一阵咒骂和冷笑。傲慢的骑士顿时站住了，转过身来，合抱着双手，挺起胸膛嚷道：“住口，你们这些吠叫的恶狗！在围攻鹿的时候，你们却不敢上前，现在叫喊什么。德布拉西不在乎你们的责备，也瞧不起你们的赞美。回你们的狗洞和树林吧，你们这些亡命之徒！不论骑士和贵族谈论什么，你们还是躲在洞里别作声的好。”\n 这不合时宜的挑衅，要不是首领及时而严厉的干预，便可能使德布拉西成为一阵飞箭的目标。当时草坪周围缚着几匹马，这是从牛面将军的马厩中取得的，它们构成了战利品中贵重的一部分，现在德布拉西便抓住一匹马的缰绳，翻身一跃而上，朝树林中飞驰而去了。\n 等这件小事造成的紧张气氛平静之后，首领从脖子上取下了珍贵的号角和肩带，就是他在阿什贝的射箭比赛中赢得的那份奖品。\n “尊贵的骑士，”他对黑甲骑士说道，“如果你肯赏脸，接受一个英国庄稼人赢得的这只号角，我会感到很光荣；希望你把它保存着，作为这次英勇行动的纪念。你作为一个武士，随时可能遇到困难，到那时，如果你是在特伦特河和提兹河之间的任何森林中，你只要在这号角上这么吹三声：‘哇——沙——嗬！’马上会有人来帮助你，搭救你。”\n 然后他对着号角，吹了几次他所描述的那个调子，直到骑士掌握了这些音符为止。\n “多谢你的礼物，勇敢的老乡，”骑士说。“在我最需要的时候，能得到你和你的伙伴的帮助，实在太好了。”于是他也吹起了这调子，号音在整个森林中回荡。\n “吹得很好，很清楚，”庄户人说，“我相信，你不仅熟悉战争，也熟悉森林中的活动！看来你当初一定是打鹿的好猎手。伙计们，别忘记这三声暗号，它表示黑甲骑士在叫你们；凡是听到这声音，不赶快去帮助他的，我非得用他自己的弓弦抽打他，把他赶出我们的队伍不可。”\n “我们的首领万岁！”庄稼汉们喊道，“戴镣铐的黑甲骑士万岁！但愿他不久以后便需要我们的帮助，他就知道我们这些人多么可靠了。”\n 现在洛克斯利开始分配战利品，这事他办得非常公正，令人钦佩。他先从全部物品中分出十分之一，留给教会和作祈祷的费用；其次又分出二份，作为公共的储备，还有一份划归战死者留下的孤儿寡妇，也为没有留下家属的死者举办安魂弥撒等等。其余的一切便由大家按等级和功劳分配；每逢遇到疑难问题，首领总能以充分的理由提出自己的看法质而大家无不心悦诚服。黑甲骑士不免感到诧异，这些人尽管无法无天，在他们内部一切却井井有条，公平合理；他目睹的一切增强了他的信念，觉得这位首领确实是一个是非分明、公正无私的人。\n 每个人都拿到自己的一份以后，划归公有的那份，便由四个身强力壮的小伙子送往一个地方储藏或保管，分给教会的那份仍留在原地没动。\n “我真想打听一下，我们那位快活的随军教士究竟怎么啦，”首领说，“每逢吃肉或者分配战利品的时候，他是从不缺席的；这十分之一的胜利果实，应该由他保管，这是他的职责。说不定他借此机会，去干什么违反教规的勾当了。另外，我们还抓到了一个教士，现在扣押在离此不远的地方，我得找修士帮忙，用合适的办法对付他。我非常担心，我们那个鲁莽的家伙有没有遇到危险。”\n “我也非常焦急呢，”镣铐骑士说，“因为我还欠他一份人情，蒙他在他的小屋中款待我，让我度过了愉快的一夜。我们不如到城堡的废墟中找找他，也许能发现一些线索。”\n 大家正在这么议论时，庄户人中间突然发出了欢呼声，这说明他们所担心的那个人回来了，因为修士的洪亮嗓音是大家所熟悉的，它总是在他的肥大身躯出现之前先行到达。\n “让开，快活的小伙子们！”他喊道，“快给你们的神父和他的俘虏让路。再喊一次欢迎。我来了，尊贵的首领，我像一只鹰，爪子上还带来了一名俘虏。”在一片哄笑声中，他挤过一圈人群，像凯旋而归的将军一般出现在众人面前，一只手提着一把大戟，另一只手拉着一根绳索，绳索的另一头便缚在倒霉的约克的以撒的脖子上，以撒俯下了头，又伤心又害怕，教士却得意扬扬，牵着他大声嚷嚷。“阿伦阿代尔在哪儿？他得把我写进歌谣中，至少也得编成一首短诗。凭圣赫曼吉尔德起誓，每逢有一个歌颂勇士的合适题材出现，总是找不到这个叮叮咚咚的琴师！”\n “修士，别胡闹，”首领说，“你今天不做礼拜，却一早就跑去喝酒。我以圣尼古拉的名义问你，你带来的是什么人？”\n “我刀下的俘虏，我枪下的囚徒，高贵的首领，”科普曼赫斯特的教士回答，“也就是说，向我的弓和朝投诚的一个小子；不过实际是我救了他．免得他继续当魔鬼的俘虏。犹太佬，你说，我有没有替你从撒旦那里赎身？我有没有教你念使徒信经，念主祷文，念万福马利亚？我有没有化了一夜工夫，一边喝酒，一边给你讲解教义？”\n “上帝保佑吧！”可怜的犹太人呼叫道，“没有人能救我，让我脱离这个疯……这个神父吗？”\n “怎么回事，犹太佬？”修士说，露出了威吓的架势，“你反悔了，犹太佬？你可得仔细想想，要是你三心两意，再信邪教，尽管你的肉不像小猪那么嫩，也不见得会老得煮不烂，我非把你一口吞下不可！还是皈依基督吧，以撒，跟着我念，万福马利亚！……”\n “不成，我们不允许亵读神灵，疯修士，”洛克斯利说。“你还是讲讲，你是在哪里弄到这个俘虏的？”\n “凭圣邓斯坦起誓，”修士答道，“我是在寻找更合适的用具时，偶然碰到他的！我走进地窖，想看看有没有什么可以抢救的，因为对我说来，一杯煮热的酒加上香料，这就够了，哪怕皇帝喝的也不过如此；要是让这么多好酒一下子全都煮热，未免太浪费了，于是我抓起一小桶葡萄酒，要找人帮忙打开它，可是那些懒虫，有好差使给他们干，偏偏找不到他们。正在这时，我发现了一扇大铁门，我想：‘哼，原来最好的酒藏在这个秘密的所在，幸好管地窖的混蛋要紧逃命，把钥匙忘在门上了。’于是我走了进去，发现那里啥也没有，只有一堆生锈的锁链和这只犹太狗，他马上向我无条件投降，当了我的俘虏。我跟这个不信基督的家伙蘑菇了半天，实在累了，这才喝了一杯葡萄酒，正打算带着我的俘虏回来，忽然屋子里轰隆轰隆大响起来，震得天摇地动，火光烛天，原来外面的塔楼坍了 ——那些混蛋真该死，不把房子造得牢固一些！——它堵住了过道。塔楼一个接一个倒坍，跟打雷似的。我已经不再抱生还的希望，但想起要与一个犹太佬一起离开这个世界，对我的职业未免是奇耻大辱，于是我举起战斧，想先把他送往地狱，但看到他的满头白发，我又心软了，觉得最好还是放下战斧，用我的宗教武器开导他皈依我们。确实，多亏圣邓斯坦的保佑，我的播种还有些收获；只是为了开导他，我忙了一整夜，什么吃的也没有，只喝了几口葡萄酒提提神，这根本算不得什么，可是我的脑袋不知怎么昏昏沉沉的，一定是我太累了。吉尔伯特和威伯尔特知道，他们找到我时，我是什么样子。我确确实实是累坏了。”\n “我可以证明，”吉尔伯特说，“我们清除了砖瓦，靠圣邓斯坦的帮助，见到地窖的楼梯后，发现那桶葡萄酒已只剩了一半，犹太人吓得半死，修士迷迷糊糊的，甚至超过了半死——用他的话说，那是累坏了。”\n “你们这些混蛋，胡说八道！”修士气急败坏地反驳道，“是你们和你们那些贪嘴的伙伴把葡萄酒喝光的，还说这是你们早上的第一顿酒呢。我是要把它留给首领尝尝的，如果这不是实话，我就是个异教徒。但是这算得什么？犹太人皈依了我们，明白了我讲的一切，即使不像我那么完全明白，至少差不多了。”\n “犹太人，”首领说道，“这是真的吗？你改变了信仰，不再不信基督？”\n “但愿我能得到您的宽恕，”犹太人说，“这位神父在可怕的一夜中对我讲的话，我实在一句也不懂。唉！我当时心里又难过，又悲伤，又害怕，哪里有心思听他的，那时哪怕我们的老祖宗亚伯拉罕来向我说教，也只是对牛弹琴，我一句也不会懂得。”\n “你撒谎，犹太佬，你知道你是在撒谎，”修士说，“我只想提醒你一件事，那是我们谈话时你亲口许的愿，你说你决定把全部财产捐给我们的教会。”\n “我的天，这是从何说起呀，各位老爷，”以撒说，显得比刚才更加惶恐了，“我的嘴从来没有讲过这样的话！哎哟！我又老又穷，已经倾家荡产——恐怕连孩子也没有了；可怜可怜我，放我走吧。”\n “不行，”修士说，“那是你向神圣的教会许的愿，现在想赖账，非得惩罚你不可。”\n 他一边说，一边举起那把大戟，正要把它的柄朝犹太人的肩上狠狠打去，但给黑甲骑士挡开了，这样，修士把一腔怒火发泄到了他身上。\n “凭肯特的圣托马斯起誓，”他嚷道，“要是我穿着盔甲，懒惰的朋友，我非得教训你一顿不可，让你别管闲事，尽管你头上套着那只铁箩筐我也不怕！”\n “嗨晦，别发脾气呀，”骑士说，“要知道，我们是情投意合的好朋友呢。”\n “我不认识你这种朋友，”修士答道，“你是个爱管闲事的花花公子，我非教训你不可。”\n “算了，”骑士说，好像存心要作弄这位以前款待过他的主人，拿他逗乐似的，“你难道忘了，你曾经为了我——当然也是为了那坛酒和那个大馅饼，连斋也不守，经也不念的那回事吗？”\n “告诉你，老弟，”修士说，攥紧了他的大拳头，“我非得请你尝尝我的手劲不可。”\n “但我不想白尝，”骑士答道(注)，“那就算我欠了你一笔账，不过你得让我加倍奉还，给你一巴掌，就像你这位俘虏干的高利贷买卖一样。”\n --------\n (注)见作者附注七。——原注\n “那就当场试试，看究竟谁厉害，”修士说。\n “别胡闹！”首领喝道，“你要干什么，疯修士——要在约会树下打架不成？”\n “不是打架，”骑士说，“这只是礼尚往来的友好较量。修士，你先打吧，我挨你一拳，你也得挨我一巴掌。”\n “你占了便宜，头上戴着那个铁箩筐，”教士说，“不过我不怕你。哪怕你是迦特的歌利亚(注)戴上了钢盔，我也得把你打扁。”\n --------\n (注)《圣经》中提到的大力士，见本书第16章。《撒母耳记上》第17章第4节说：“歌利亚是迦特人……头戴铜盔，身穿铠甲……”\n 修士撩起衣袖，把粗壮的胳臂露出了大半截，使出浑身力气，朝骑士打去，那是可以把一头公牛打翻在地的一拳。但是对方却像一块磐石，一动不动。周围的老乡全都大声喝起彩来，因为教士的拳头在他们中间是有口皆碑的，不论真打还是假打，都有不少人尝过它的味道。\n “修士，”骑士说，拉下了铁臂销，“我的脑袋占了便宜，我不想让我的胳膊也占便宜；现在请你站稳了，摆出真正的人样来。”\n “来，朝着我的面颊狠狠地打——我把整个脸全伸给你啦，”教士说，“只要你能叫我晃动一步，我就把犹太人的赎金全部让给你。”\n 这个粗壮的大汉一边这么说，一边摆好姿势，露出满不在乎的神气。可是谁能对抗命运呢？骑士那一巴掌虽然并无恶意，力量却那么大，修士马上摔了个倒栽葱，扑到了地上，把观看的人全都惊呆了。但他站起身来，既没发怒，也没泄气。\n “老弟，”他对骑士说道，“你力气这么大，可得手下留情呐。要是你把我的牙床骨打断了，叫我咋办，要知道掉了下巴颏就念不成经了。好吧，这是我的手，我们讲和了，今后也不再跟你比力气，这次我认输了。让我们言归于好。现在得给犹太人的赎金定个价钱了，因为豹子身上不会没有斑点，犹太人也永远是犹太人。”\n “我们的教士挨了那一巴掌，才明白犹太人是不会皈依我们的，”克莱门特说。\n “去你的，浑小子，你懂什么皈依不皈依？怎么，连礼貌也不要了，上下尊卑也不顾了？告诉你，小伙子，刚才骑士老弟那一拳打来的时候，我正好有些头晕，要不然我哪能摔倒。要是你再多嘴，我就得让你知道，我的拳头也不是好惹的。”\n “大家安静！”首领说。“犹太人，你考虑一下你的赎金吧；不用我说，想必你也明白，在基督徒社会里，你这个民族总是受到鄙视的，老实说，我们不能容许你待在我们中间。因此，你得考虑愿意付多少钱，现在我要审问另一类型的俘虏了。”\n “牛面将军的人，抓到的多吗？”黑甲骑士问。\n “没有什么头面人物，都够不上付赎金的资格，”首领答道，“那些下贱家伙已给我们打发走了，让他们各自去投奔新主人吧；我们报了仇，得到了好处，这就够了，这些家伙分文不值。我讲的俘虏是一个有名堂的脚色——一个寻欢作乐的教士，照他那身打扮和马上的华丽装饰看，他是骑了马去会他的情妇的。瞧，我们这位长老来了，多么神气活现，跟只喜鹊似的。”两个庄户人把一个教士押到了首领的座位前面，原来这不是别人，正是我们的老朋友，茹尔沃修道院的艾默长老。\n
