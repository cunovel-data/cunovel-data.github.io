{"id":6110,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"At eve, within yon studious nook, I ope my brass-embossed book, Portray\u0027d with many a holy deed Of martyrs crown\u0027d with heavenly meed; Then, as my taper waxes dim, Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn. * * * * * Who but would cast his pomp away, To take my staff and amice grey, And to the world\u0027s tumultuous stage, Prefer the peaceful Hermitage? Warton Notwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his guest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp to harmony. \"Methinks, holy father,\" said he, \"the instrument wants one string, and the rest have been somewhat misused.\" \"Ay, mark\u0027st thou that?\" replied the hermit; \"that shows thee a master of the craft. Wine and wassail,\" he added, gravely casting up his eyes---\"all the fault of wine and wassail!---I told Allan-a-Dale, the northern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touched it after the seventh cup, but he would not be controlled---Friend, I drink to thy successful performance.\" So saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time shaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper. The knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order, and after a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a \"sirvente\" in the language of \"oc\", or a \"lai\" in the language of \"oui\", or a \"virelai\", or a ballad in the vulgar English.* * Note C. Minstrelsy. \"A ballad, a ballad,\" said the hermit, \"against all the \u0027ocs\u0027 and \u0027ouis\u0027 of France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downright English was my patron St Dunstan, and scorned \u0027oc\u0027 and \u0027oui\u0027, as he would have scorned the parings of the devil\u0027s hoof ---downright English alone shall be sung in this cell.\" \"I will assay, then,\" said the knight, \"a ballad composed by a Saxon glee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.\" It speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of the minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under the best instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice which had little compass, and was naturally rough rather than mellow, and, in short, had done all that culture can do in supplying natural deficiencies. His performance, therefore, might have been termed very respectable by abler judges than the hermit, especially as the knight threw into the notes now a degree of spirit, and now of plaintive enthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the verses which he sung. THE CRUSADER\u0027S RETURN. 1. High deeds achieved of knightly fame, From Palestine the champion came; The cross upon his shoulders borne, Battle and blast had dimm\u0027d and torn. Each dint upon his batter\u0027d shield Was token of a foughten field; And thus, beneath his lady\u0027s bower, He sung as fell the twilight hour:--- 2. \"Joy to the fair!---thy knight behold, Return\u0027d from yonder land of gold; No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need, Save his good arms and battle-steed His spurs, to dash against a foe, His lance and sword to lay him low; Such all the trophies of his toil, Such---and the hope of Tekla\u0027s smile! 3. \"Joy to the fair! whose constant knight Her favour fired to feats of might; Unnoted shall she not remain, Where meet the bright and noble train; Minstrel shall sing and herald tell--- \u0027Mark yonder maid of beauty well, \u0027Tis she for whose bright eyes were won The listed field at Askalon! 4. \"\u0027Note well her smile!---it edged the blade Which fifty wives to widows made, When, vain his strength and Mahound\u0027s spell, Iconium\u0027s turban\u0027d Soldan fell. Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glow Half shows, half shades, her neck of snow? Twines not of them one golden thread, But for its sake a Paynim bled.\u0027 5. \"Joy to the fair!---my name unknown, Each deed, and all its praise thine own Then, oh! unbar this churlish gate, The night dew falls, the hour is late. Inured to Syria\u0027s glowing breath, I feel the north breeze chill as death; Let grateful love quell maiden shame, And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.\" During this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a first-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back upon his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and twisting his thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon, balancing his expanded palms, he gently flourished them in time to the music. At one or two favourite cadences, he threw in a little assistance of his own, where the knight\u0027s voice seemed unable to carry the air so high as his worshipful taste approved. When the song was ended, the anchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well sung. \"And yet,\" said he, \"I think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough with the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties. What took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to find his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his serenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a cat in the gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee, to the success of all true lovers---I fear you are none,\" he added, on observing that the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these repeated draughts) qualified his flagon from the water pitcher. \"Why,\" said the knight, \"did you not tell me that this water was from the well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?\" \"Ay, truly,\" said the hermit, \"and many a hundred of pagans did he baptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing should be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well as any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.\" And so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with the following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus, appropriate to an old English ditty.* * It may be proper to remind the reader, that the chorus of * \"derry down\" is supposed to be as ancient, not only as * the times of the Heptarchy, but as those of the Druids, * and to have furnished the chorus to the hymns of those * venerable persons when they went to the wood to gather * mistletoe. THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR. 1. I\u0027ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain, To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain; But ne\u0027er shall you find, should you search till you tire, So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar. 2. Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career, And is brought home at even-song prick\u0027d through with a spear; I confess him in haste---for his lady desires No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar\u0027s. 3. Your monarch?---Pshaw! many a prince has been known To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown, But which of us e\u0027er felt the idle desire To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar! 4. The Friar has walk\u0027d out, and where\u0027er he has gone, The land and its fatness is mark\u0027d for his own; He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires, For every man\u0027s house is the Barefooted Friar\u0027s. 5. He\u0027s expected at noon, and no wight till he comes May profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums For the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire, Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar. 6. He\u0027s expected at night, and the pasty\u0027s made hot, They broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot, And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire, Ere he lack\u0027d a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar. 7. Long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope, The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope; For to gather life\u0027s roses, unscathed by the briar, Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar. \"By my troth,\" said the knight, \"thou hast sung well and lustily, and in high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy Clerk, are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your uncanonical pastimes?\" \"I uncanonical!\" answered the hermit; \"I scorn the charge---I scorn it with my heels!---I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly---Two masses daily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, \u0027aves, credos, paters\u0027------\" \"Excepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,\" said his guest. \"\u0027Exceptis excipiendis\u0027\" replied the hermit, \"as our old abbot taught me to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept every punctilio of mine order.\" \"True, holy father,\" said the knight; \"but the devil is apt to keep an eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring lion.\" \"Let him roar here if he dares,\" said the friar; \"a touch of my cord will make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I never feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint Dunstan, Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert, Saint Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor merits to speed, I defy every devil of them, come cut and long tail.---But to let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects, my friend, until after morning vespers.\" He changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the parties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels were interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage. The occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the adventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we do not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one personage of our drama. 在黄昏寂静的书斋中， 我翻开镶铜精装的古书， 披阅许多圣徒的事迹， 殉难已使他们升入天堂。 随着烛光的逐渐暗淡， 我唱过赞美诗安然入睡。 可谁愿抛弃功名富贵， 拿起牧杖围上灰布披肩， 离开热闹繁华的世界， 蛰居在清静的隐修室中？ 沃顿 隐士的谆谆劝告，客人自然乐于从命，可是调准琴弦却不像喝酒那么容易。 “神父，”他说道，“我看这乐器大概少了一条弦，其余几根好像也损坏了。” “哦，你看出来了？”隐士答道，“那么你还是真正懂得这玩艺的，这都是贪酒的结果，”他抬起眼睛．又一本正经地说，“一切都得怪他大贪酒！我是指我们的苏格兰行吟诗人阿伦阿代尔(注)，我告诉他，喝过七杯酒以后，别碰我的竖琴，否则非把它搞坏不可，但他不听劝告。朋友，我喝一杯，祝你弹唱成功。” -------- (注)阿伦阿代尔，这也是罗宾汉的一个伙伴。他是民间艺人，据说，罗宾汉曾帮助他从一个年老的骑士手中救出他的未婚妻，从此他便追随罗宾汉，本书后半部中也多次提到他。 说完，他又郑重其事地喝干了一杯酒，同时摇摇头，表示对那位苏格兰竖琴手的好酒贪杯不以为然。 这时，骑士已把琴弦多少摄弄好了，先弹了段过门，然后问主人，他是唱诺曼人的曲子，还是法国人的曲子，或者英国的通俗民谣呢？ “唱民谣，唱民谣，”隐士说，“我不要听诺曼人的曲子，也不要听法国人的曲子。骑士先生，我是地地道道的英国人，正如我的保护神圣邓斯坦也是地地道道的英国人，我不爱听诺曼话和法国话，正如他不爱给魔鬼修蹄子一样(注)。在这间屋子里只能唱英国歌。” -------- (注)据英国的民间传说，圣邓斯坦生前当过铁匠（因此被认为是铁匠的保护神），有一次魔鬼去找他修蹄子，给他作弄了一番，从此再也不敢小看这位圣徒。 “那么我试试吧，”骑士说，“这是一支英文谣曲，我在圣地认识的一个撒克逊吟游诗人编的。” 情况立刻清楚了，这位骑士即使不擅长弹唱艺术，至少他的演唱方式说明他是经历过名师指点的。他的音域不太宽广，嗓音也天生较粗，不够圆润，然而他的修养发挥了应有的作用，弥补了一切天然的缺陷，因此他的演唱，哪怕比隐士更高明的评判者，也会觉得无可挑剔，何况骑士在弹唱中有时显得慷慨激昂，有时又变得悲哀凄切，给他的曲调增添了生动的活力。 十字军人远征归来 在激烈的战斗中赢得了荣誉， 勇士从巴勒斯坦回来了； 肩上绣的十字架花纹， 已在战斗和风雨中褪色和破损； 盾牌上留下的每一道刀痕， 都标志着一次腥风血雨的鏖战。 在暮色降临大地的时刻， 他来到姑娘的窗下歌唱： “告诉姑娘一个喜讯！你的骑士 已从那片黄金的土地上回来。 发他没有带回财宝，也不需要财宝， 他有的只是锋利的刀剑和战马， 他向敌人冲锋陷阵的踢马刺， 他使敌人望风披靡的长枪； 这就是他浴血奋战的全部纪念品， 只希望它们能博得美人的一笑！ “告诉美人一个喜讯！她的忠诚骑士 在爱情的鼓舞下建立了丰功伟绩； 从此她的名字将传遍远近各地， 光辉而尊贵的接待随时恭候着她； 诗人歌唱她，典礼官也向世界宣布： ‘仔细瞧瞧那位美丽的少女， 正是为了她那双明亮的眼睛， 骑士才在阿什克伦的比武中赢得了胜利！ “‘仔细瞧瞧她的笑容！它使刀剑锋利无比， 尽管拥有千军万马和穆罕默德的保佑， 包头巾的偶像苏丹却在他的剑下丧生， 他的五十个妻妾顷刻之间成了寡妇！ 瞧瞧她的鬈发，它那么光艳照人， 半掩半映地披在她雪白的脖颈上， 它们中间没有一缕金银丝线， 可是为了它们，异教徒倒在了血泊中。’ “告诉姑娘一个喜讯！我不想扬名天下， 一切功绩和赞美都属于你。 只是在这夜深露冷的时刻， 请你打开这简陋的大门； 在叙利亚的炎热中生活惯了， 北风使我觉得像死一般寒冷。 让感激的爱情消除少女的羞涩， 把幸福赐予带给你荣誉的人吧。” 在这支歌弹唱时，隐士那副神态活像今天一位第一流批评家在欣赏一出新歌剧。他把身子靠后一些，仰起了头，半闭着眼睛，有时交叉双手，摩弄着拇指，似乎正全神贯注在静听，有时又伸开巴掌，随着音乐的节拍轻轻挥舞。遇到一两个他喜爱的乐段，他仿佛觉得骑士的嗓音还不够嘹亮，不足以达到他的欣赏水平所要求的高度，于是不免助他一臂之力，随声哼上几下。演唱结束，隐士便郑重宣布，这是首好歌，唱得也婉转悦耳。 “然而我想，”他说，“我的撒克逊同胞跟诺曼人混得久了，不免沾染了他们的感伤情调。你说，这个正直的骑士为什么要离开家乡？他回来后，除了发现他的情人已倒在别人的怀抱中，他的小夜曲——按照诺曼人的说法——只能像猫在阴沟中叫春一样，得不到反应，还能指望什么呢？不过，骑士老弟，我与你干这一杯，祝一切有情人真正成为眷属。但恐怕你不是其中的一个，”他又说，发觉骑士一再喝酒，头脑已有些迷糊，以致把水罐里的水倒进了酒杯中。 “咦，”骑士说，“你刚才不是告诉我，水罐里装的是你的保护神圣邓斯坦的泉水吗？” “千真万确，”隐士答道，“好几百异教徒在这儿受过洗礼呢，但我从未听说他拿它当酒喝。世界上的任何事物都有固定的用途。圣邓斯坦也像别人一样，了解快活的出家人的特殊需要。” 他一边这么说，一边拿过竖琴来，给客人唱了下面这支歌，那）用原始的歌谣方式演唱的英国民间小调： 赤脚修士之歌 朋友，我可以给你一年或两年时间， 让你从拜占庭到西班牙找遍整个欧洲， 可是哪怕你找得筋疲力尽也无法找到 像赤脚修士这么快活的人。 你的骑士为了心爱的人赴汤蹈火， 晚祷声中带着枪伤回到她的身边， 她却把我匆匆叫去替他作临终忏悔， 因为除了赤脚修士她不要别人作伴。 你的国王分文不值！因为许多君主 情愿用他的龙袍换一身修士衣服， 可是我们中间又有谁会忽发奇想， 要把僧帽去交换一顶王冠！ 我们的修士去游四方，到处为家， 天下的珍馐美味都可以供他享受， 他在哪里都来去自由，无牵无挂， 因为每个人的家都是赤脚修士的家。 他预定中午到达，中午以前 大家已备好丰盛的筵席虚位以待， 因为精美的饮食和炉边的座位， 永远是赤脚修士不可剥夺的权利。 他预定晚上到达，浓冽的麦酒， 热气腾腾的馅饼已在恭候大骂， 主妇宁可让当家人睡在野外， 也不愿赤脚修士没有温暖的床铺。 修士的芒鞋、腰带和长施早已风行无阻， 魔鬼怕它们，教皇信赖它们； 为了采集没刺的玫瑰，享受生活的欢乐， 最好的办法便是当一名赤脚修士。 “说老实话，”骑士说道，“你唱得很好，振奋人心，高度赞扬了你们的修会。不过讲到魔鬼，你不怕他趁你违反教规，寻欢作乐的时候，光顾你的茅庐吗？” “我违反教规！”隐士答道，“这是无中生有的指责，根本不在我的话下！我在教堂中格守清规，按时祈祷。一天晨昏两次弥撒，早上祷告，中午祷告，晚上祷告，念主待文，万福马利亚，使徒信经……” “月光之夜是例外，正好乘机猎取鹿肉，”客人说。 “例外只是例外，”隐士答道，“我们修道院的老院长教导我说，如果自不量力的俗人问我，是不是遵守修会的规则，我可以这么回答他们。” “说得有理，神父，”骑士道，“不过魔鬼总是把眼睛盯住这些例外；你知道，他到处转悠，像一只吼叫的狮子。” “他要吼叫就让它吼叫，”修士说，“我的腰带一碰到他，他就不敢张牙舞爪，好像给圣邓斯坦的钳子夹住了鼻子(注)。我不怕任何人，也不怕魔鬼和他的徒子徒孙。圣邓斯坦，圣杜布里克，圣威尼巴尔德，圣威尼弗莱德，圣斯威伯特，圣威利克，还不能忘记肯特的圣托马斯和我自己的功德——这一切都会保护我，我不怕任何一个魔鬼，不论它是长尾巴的还是短尾巴的。不过告诉你一个秘密，我的朋友，我从来不在晨待以前谈这些问题。” -------- (注)据有关圣邓斯坦的另一个传说，魔鬼曾在夜间骚扰圣邓斯坦，被后者乘其不备，用烧红的铁钳夹住了鼻子。 他改变了话题，于是两人兴高采烈，开怀畅饮，还唱了不少歌，互相应和，正在这时，有人大声打门了。 这使他们的饮酒作乐只得宣告终止；至于谁在打门，那得回头先谈另一些人物的活动了，因为我们也像老阿里奥斯托(注)一样，不能一成不变，老是跟故事中的一两个角色作伴。 -------- (注)阿里奥斯托（1474—1533），意大利人文主义诗人，他的主要作品长篇叙事诗《疯狂的罗兰》情节复杂，人物众多，经常变换场景。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2679.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷 Ivanhoe","description":"简介： Ivanhoe is a novel by Sir Walter Scott.
