{"id":6124,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or, close the wall up with our English dead. --------------- And you, good yeomen, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture---let us swear That you are worth your breeding. King Henry V Cedric, although not greatly confident in Ulrica\u0027s message, omitted not to communicate her promise to the Black Knight and Locksley. They were well pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in the moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily agreed with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought to be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in the hands of the cruel Front-de-Boeuf. \"The royal blood of Alfred is endangered,\" said Cedric. \"The honour of a noble lady is in peril,\" said the Black Knight. \"And, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,\" said the good yeoman, \"were there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave, Wamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.\" \"And so would I,\" said the Friar; \"what, sirs! I trust well that a fool---I mean, d\u0027ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild and master of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of wine as ever a flitch of bacon can---I say, brethren, such a fool shall never want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait, while I can say a mass or flourish a partisan.\" And with that he made his heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his light crook. \"True, Holy Clerk,\" said the Black Knight, \"true as if Saint Dunstan himself had said it.---And now, good Locksley, were it not well that noble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?\" \"Not a jot I,\" returned Cedric; \"I have never been wont to study either how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which the Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the foremost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier in the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.\" \"Since it stands thus with noble Cedric,\" said Locksley, \"I am most willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang me up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show themselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as there are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.\" \"Well said, stout yeoman,\" answered the Black Knight; \"and if I be thought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among these brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight, for so I may surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my experience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.\" The parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the first assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue. When the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the happy event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such a strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from combining their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork which they had lost. This the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding, conscious that the men whom he led, being hasty and untrained volunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon any sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers of the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both defensive and offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of the besiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline and the habitual use of weapons. The knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure to execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be. When the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the besiegers:---\"It avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is descending to the west---and I have that upon my hands which will not permit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel if the horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish our purpose. Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid him commence a discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward as if about to assault it; and you, true English hearts, stand by me, and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the postern on our side is thrown open. Follow me boldly across, and aid me to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle. As many of you as like not this service, or are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the top of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to your ears, and mind you quell with your shot whatever shall appear to man the rampart---Noble Cedric, wilt thou take the direction of those which remain?\" \"Not so, by the soul of Hereward!\" said the Saxon; \"lead I cannot; but may posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the foremost wherever thou shalt point the way---The quarrel is mine, and well it becomes me to be in the van of the battle.\" \"Yet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,\" said the knight, \"thou hast neither hauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and sword.\" \"The better!\" answered Cedric; \"I shall be the lighter to climb these walls. And,---forgive the boast, Sir Knight,---thou shalt this day see the naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye beheld the steel corslet of a Norman.\" \"In the name of God, then,\" said the knight, \"fling open the door, and launch the floating bridge.\" The portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat, and which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle, was now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward, and soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle and outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men abreast to cross the moat. Well aware of the importance of taking the foe by surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw himself upon the bridge, and reached the opposite side. Here he began to thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former drawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat from the barbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of the portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two were instantly shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the moat; the others retreated back into the barbican. The situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous, and would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the archers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon the battlements, distracting the attention of those by whom they were manned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the storm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them. But their situation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every moment. \"Shame on ye all!\" cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; \"do ye call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station under the walls of the castle?---Heave over the coping stones from the battlements, an better may not be---Get pick-axe and levers, and down with that huge pinnacle!\" pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work that projected from the parapet. At this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle of the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout yeoman Locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault. \"Saint George!\" he cried, \"Merry Saint George for England!---To the charge, bold yeomen!---why leave ye the good knight and noble Cedric to storm the pass alone?---make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for thy rosary,---make in, brave yeomen!---the castle is ours, we have friends within---See yonder flag, it is the appointed signal---Torquilstone is ours!---Think of honour, think of spoil---One effort, and the place is ours!\" With that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the breast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy\u0027s direction, was loosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the heads of Cedric and the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the hands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and had loosened the stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his head-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man. The men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the shot of this tremendous archer. \"Do you give ground, base knaves!\" said De Bracy; \"\u0027Mount joye Saint Dennis!\u0027---Give me the lever!\" And, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. All saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided setting foot on the raft. Thrice did Locksley bend his shaft against De Bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knight\u0027s armour of proof. \"Curse on thy Spanish steel-coat!\" said Locksley, \"had English smith forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or sendal.\" He then began to call out, \"Comrades! friends! noble Cedric! bear back, and let the ruin fall.\" His warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty war-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked bridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him. But his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already tottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have accomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his ears:--- \"All is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.\" \"Thou art mad to say so!\" replied the knight. \"It is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain to extinguish it.\" With the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian de Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not so calmly received by his astonished comrade. \"Saints of Paradise!\" said De Bracy; \"what is to be done? I vow to Saint Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold---\" \"Spare thy vow,\" said the Templar, \"and mark me. Lead thy men down, as if to a sally; throw the postern-gate open---There are but two men who occupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the barbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on the outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend ourselves until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair quarter.\" \"It is well thought upon,\" said De Bracy; \"I will play my part ---Templar, thou wilt not fail me?\" \"Hand and glove, I will not!\" said Bois-Guilbert. \"But haste thee, in the name of God!\" De Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the postern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce was this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his way inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leader\u0027s efforts to stop them. \"Dogs!\" said De Bracy, \"will ye let TWO men win our only pass for safety?\" \"He is the devil!\" said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the blows of their sable antagonist. \"And if he be the devil,\" replied De Bracy, \"would you fly from him into the mouth of hell?---the castle burns behind us, villains!---let despair give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this champion myself\" And well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage to which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted champions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows which they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight with his ponderous axe. At length the Norman received a blow, which, though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never more would De Bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor. \"Yield thee, De Bracy,\" said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of mercy,)---\"yield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou art but a dead man.\" \"I will not yield,\" replied De Bracy faintly, \"to an unknown conqueror. Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me---it shall never be said that Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.\" The Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished. \"I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,\" answered the Norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of deep though sullen submission. \"Go to the barbican,\" said the victor, in a tone of authority, \"and there wait my further orders.\" \"Yet first, let me say,\" said De Bracy, \"what it imports thee to know. Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the burning castle without present help.\" \"Wilfred of Ivanhoe!\" exclaimed the Black Knight---\"prisoner, and perish!---The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed---Show me his chamber!\" \"Ascend yonder winding stair,\" said De Bracy; \"it leads to his apartment---Wilt thou not accept my guidance?\" he added, in a submissive voice. \"No. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De Bracy.\" During this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at the head of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had pushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove back the dispirited and despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom some asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled towards the court-yard. De Bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. \"He trusts me not!\" he repeated; \"but have I deserved his trust?\" He then lifted his sword from the floor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the barbican, gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way. As the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the chamber, where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was for some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the smouldering and stifling vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which rolled into the apartment---the cries for water, which were heard even above the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this new danger. \"The castle burns,\" said Rebecca; \"it burns!---What can we do to save ourselves?\" \"Fly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,\" said Ivanhoe, \"for no human aid can avail me.\" \"I will not fly,\" answered Rebecca; \"we will be saved or perish together---And yet, great God!---my father, my father---what will be his fate!\" At this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar presented himself,---a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken and bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his casque. \"I have found thee,\" said he to Rebecca; \"thou shalt prove I will keep my word to share weal and woe with thee---There is but one path to safety, I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to thee---up, and instantly follow me!\"* * The author has some idea that this passage is imitated * from the appearance of Philidaspes, before the divine * Mandane, when the city of Babylon is on fire, and he * proposes to carry her from the flames. But the theft, * if there be one, would be rather too severely punished * by the penance of searching for the original passage * through the interminable volumes of the Grand Cyrus. \"Alone,\" answered Rebecca, \"I will not follow thee. If thou wert born of woman---if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee ---if thy heart be not hard as thy breastplate---save my aged father---save this wounded knight!\" \"A knight,\" answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, \"a knight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the shape of sword or flame---and who recks how or where a Jew meets with his?\" \"Savage warrior,\" said Rebecca, \"rather will I perish in the flames than accept safety from thee!\" \"Thou shalt not choose, Rebecca---once didst thou foil me, but never mortal did so twice.\" So saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with her shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her cries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe thundered against him. \"Hound of the Temple---stain to thine Order---set free the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands thee!---Villain, I will have thy heart\u0027s blood!\" \"I had not found thee, Wilfred,\" said the Black Knight, who at that instant entered the apartment, \"but for thy shouts.\" \"If thou be\u0027st true knight,\" said Wilfred, \"think not of me ---pursue yon ravisher---save the Lady Rowena---look to the noble Cedric!\" \"In their turn,\" answered he of the Fetterlock, \"but thine is first.\" And seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the Templar had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners. One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from window and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the walls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress of the flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce more dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the soldiers of the tyrant Front-de-Boeuf. Most of the garrison resisted to the uttermost---few of them asked quarter---none received it. The air was filled with groans and clashing of arms---the floors were slippery with the blood of despairing and expiring wretches. Through this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while the faithful Gurth, following him closely through the \"melee\", neglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at his master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward\u0027s apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant death. He committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy, and not yet interrupted by the flames. This accomplished, the loyal Cedric hastened in quest of his friend Athelstane, determined, at every risk to himself, to save that last scion of Saxon royalty. But ere Cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had procured liberation for himself and his companion in adversity. When the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the Jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, \"Saint George and the dragon!---Bonny Saint George for merry England!---The castle is won!\" And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging against each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered around the hall. A guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and whose spirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wamba\u0027s clamour, and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar that foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners found no difficulty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from thence into the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of contest. Here sat the fierce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded by several of the garrison both on horse and foot, who had united their strength to that of this renowned leader, in order to secure the last chance of safety and retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge had been lowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who had hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles, no sooner saw the flames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they thronged to the entrance, as well to prevent the escape of the garrison, as to secure their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt down. On the other hand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by the postern were now issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with fury the remnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides at once. Animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with the utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in driving back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca, placed on horseback before one of the Templar\u0027s Saracen slaves, was in the midst of the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the confusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety. Repeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon starting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward, struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same instant once more at her bridle rein. Athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly, beheld the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and doubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in despite of all resistance which could be offered. \"By the soul of Saint Edward,\" he said, \"I will rescue her from yonder over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!\" \"Think what you do!\" cried Wamba; \"hasty hand catches frog for fish---by my bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena---see but her long dark locks!---Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but I will be no follower---no bones of mine shall be broken unless I know for whom.---And you without armour too!---Bethink you, silk bonnet never kept out steel blade. ---Nay, then, if wilful will to water, wilful must drench. ---\u0027Deus vobiscum\u0027, most doughty Athelstane!\"---he concluded, loosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the Saxon\u0027s tunic. To snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose dying grasp had just relinquished it---to rush on the Templar\u0027s band, and to strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior at each blow, was, for Athelstane\u0027s great strength, now animated with unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two yards of Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest tone. \"Turn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to touch---turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!\" \"Dog!\" said the Templar, grinding his teeth, \"I will teach thee to blaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;\" and with these words, half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane. Well said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So trenchant was the Templar\u0027s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had been a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the ill-fated Saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head, levelled him with the earth. \"\u0027Ha! Beau-seant!\u0027\" exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, \"thus be it to the maligners of the Temple-knights!\" Taking advantage of the dismay which was spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, \"Those who would save themselves, follow me!\" he pushed across the drawbridge, dispersing the archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed by his Saracens, and some five or six men-at-arms, who had mounted their horses. The Templar\u0027s retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of arrows shot off at him and his party; but this did not prevent him from galloping round to the barbican, of which, according to his previous plan, he supposed it possible De Bracy might have been in possession. \"De Bracy! De Bracy!\" he shouted, \"art thou there?\" \"I am here,\" replied De Bracy, \"but I am a prisoner.\" \"Can I rescue thee?\" cried Bois-Guilbert. \"No,\" replied De Bracy; \"I have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I will be true prisoner. Save thyself---there are hawks abroad ---put the seas betwixt you and England---I dare not say more.\" \"Well,\" answered the Templar, \"an thou wilt tarry there, remember I have redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks the walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient, and thither will I, like heron to her haunt.\" Having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers. Those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued to fight desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the Templar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any hope of escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the castle, when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff which she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal Sisters, who spin and abridge the thread of human life. Tradition has preserved some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid that scene of fire and of slaughter:--- 1. Whet the bright steel, Sons of the White Dragon! Kindle the torch, Daughter of Hengist! The steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet, It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed; The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber, It steams and glitters blue with sulphur. Whet the steel, the raven croaks! Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling! Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon! Kindle the torch, daughter of Hengist! 2. The black cloud is low over the thane\u0027s castle The eagle screams--he rides on its bosom. Scream not, grey rider of the sable cloud, Thy banquet is prepared! The maidens of Valhalla look forth, The race of Hengist will send them guests. Shake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla! And strike your loud timbrels for joy! Many a haughty step bends to your halls, Many a helmed head. 3. Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle, The black clouds gather round; Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant! The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against them. He, the bright consumer of palaces, Broad waves he his blazing banner, Red, wide and dusky, Over the strife of the valiant: His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers; He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the wound! 4. All must perish! The sword cleaveth the helmet; The strong armour is pierced by the lance; Fire devoureth the dwelling of princes, Engines break down the fences of the battle. All must perish! The race of Hengist is gone--- The name of Horsa is no more! Shrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword! Let your blades drink blood like wine; Feast ye in the banquet of slaughter, By the light of the blazing halls! Strong be your swords while your blood is warm, And spare neither for pity nor fear, For vengeance hath but an hour; Strong hate itself shall expire I also must perish! * * Note G. Ulrica\u0027s Death Song The towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through the adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and rafter; and the combatants were driven from the court-yard. The vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood. The victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in which their own ranks and arms glanced dusky red. The maniac figure of the Saxon Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the conflagration which she had raised. At length, with a terrific crash, the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of the armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not a finger, save to sign the cross. The voice of Locksley was then heard, \"Shout, yeomen!---the den of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the Trysting-tree in the Harthill-walk; for there at break of day will we make just partition among our own bands, together with our worthy allies in this great deed of vengeance.\" 勇敢一些，再一次向缺口冲杀， 不妨踩着我们英国人的尸首登上城墙。 ……还有你们，好庄户人， 你们的身体是靠英国的大地养育的， 让大家看看祖国健儿的身手， 我们起誓，你们是毫无愧色的英国人。 《亨利五世》(注) -------- (注)见莎士比亚的历史剧《亨利五世》第三幕第一场． 塞德里克虽然不太相信乌尔莉加的话，还是没有忘记把她的诺言转告黑甲骑士和洛克斯利。他们很高兴，觉得在城堡内有一个朋友，这是好事，必要的时候，也许她还能给他们的攻城带来一些方便。撒克逊人的看法也立即得到了他们的赞同，大家一致认为，不论情况如何不利，必须立即发动进攻，这是搭救落在残酷的牛面将军手中的俘虏的唯一办法。 “阿尔弗烈德大王的后裔随时有生命危险，”塞德里克说。 “一个高贵的小姐的荣誉也处在千钧一发中，”黑甲骑士说道。 “凭我肩带上的圣克利斯托弗神像起誓，”善良的庄户人说，“哪怕仅仅为了那个可怜的忠诚的汪八，别无其他原因，我也要冒险搭救他，不让他的一根头发受到伤害。” “我也一样，”修士说，“告诉你们，各位，这样一个傻瓜——我是说，诸位，这个小丑已经出师，学会了一套说笑逗限的本领，他可以使你在喝酒的时候，好像有一块腌猪肉在下酒——我说，老弟们，这样一个傻瓜，只要我还能念经，弄枪使棒，他就永远不愁没有一个教士为他祈祷，对他拔刀相助。” 他一边这么说，一边拉起那把分量不轻的战钺，在头顶上抡了一圈，它在他手中显得跟牧童的弯柄杖那么轻。 “不错，神父，”黑甲骑士说，“你的话就像圣邓斯坦亲口讲的一样正确。现在，洛克斯利朋友，这次进攻是不是请尊贵的塞德里克负责指挥？” “这件事我一窍不通，”塞德里克答道，“诺曼人在这片苦难的土地上建立的这些暴力活动的中心，应该怎么攻打，怎么防守，我从没研究过。我可以冲锋陷阵，但我那些正直的乡亲都知道，我不是一个受过训练的军人，不懂得怎么打仗，怎么进攻城堡。” “既然尊贵的塞德里克这么想，”洛克斯利说道，“我很愿意担负起指挥弓箭手的责任；我保证，只要守城的人从城墙上一露脸，他们身上马上会射满箭，就像圣诞节的腌猪腿上撒满丁香子一样；要是做不到这点，你们可以把我吊死在我们的集会树上。” “说得好，勇敢的庄户人，”黑甲骑士答道。“那么我，如果大家信得过我，认为我担当得了这项任务，那些勇敢的小伙子又愿意跟我一起干，相信我是一个真正的英国骑士——因为我确实觉得我称得上这样的人，那么我愿意凭我过去积累的经验，率领他们攻打城堡。” 领导人的任务就这么分配定当，于是展开了第一次进攻，它的结果读者已经知道了。 占领碉堡以后，黑甲骑士派人把这个喜讯通知了洛克斯利，同时要求他严密监视城堡上的动静，防止守城部队集中兵力突然出击，收复他们失去的碉堡。这是骑士最关心的事，因为他明白，他所率领的那支队伍是匆忙组成的，其中都是未经训练的志愿者，武器既不齐备，纪律又较松懈，如果遭到突然袭击，必然手忙脚乱，无法抵挡诺曼骑士的那些老兵，他们装备精良，能攻能守，尽管士气不如进攻者旺盛，但他们受过良好的训练，又久经沙场，能征惯战，自以为有必胜的把握。 骑士利用这段间歇，着手建造一座浮桥，那种长木筏似的东酉，指望不顾敌人的抵抗，靠它通过壕沟。这得花一定工夫，但指挥官们并不后悔，因为这也可以给乌尔莉加从容的时间，实施她的计划，牵制敌人的兵力，这对进攻者不论怎样总是有利的。 木筏制成后，黑甲骑士便向围攻者说：“现在不宜再等待了，朋友们，太阳已经偏西，我负的责任不允许我再拖延，等到明天了。再说，约克来的骑兵随时可能出现，从背后攻打我们，除非我们能迅速完成任务。因此，你们中间得有一个人去通知洛克斯利，让他开始向城堡的另一边射箭，并逐步向前移动，装出即将发动进攻的姿态。你们这些忠诚的英国人，得紧紧跟着我，只等我们这边的后门一打开，马上把木筏直插到壕沟对面去。你们要勇敢地随我冲到对面，帮助我攻打对面城堡的主墙，拿下它的出击口。你们中间凡是不愿干这事的，或者缺乏装备不宜干这事的，都可以到碉堡顶上担任警戒，拉开弓，作好射箭准备，一旦发现对面城头出现守兵，马上用箭把他们歼灭。尊贵的塞德里克，你愿意指挥留在这儿的人吗？” “凭赫里沃德的在天之灵起誓，我不愿留在这儿！”撒克逊人说。“带领队伍我不成，但是如果我不能在你的指挥下冲锋陷阵，哪怕我进了坟墓，也会遭到子孙后代的唾骂。这场纠纷是我引起的，我应该走在战斗的最前面。” “然而你得考虑，尊贵的撒克逊人，”骑士说，“你既没有锁子甲，也没有胸甲，没有任何护身物，只有一顶轻便帽盔，一个小盾牌，一把剑。” “这更好！”塞德里克答道，“我爬城时可以更轻快。再说，骑士老弟，恕我夸口，你今天就能看到，一个撒克逊人不穿盔甲照样可以身先士卒，参加战斗，与一个诺曼人穿上全副盔甲一样勇敢。” “那么好吧，愿上帝保佑我们，”骑士说，“打开门，把浮桥抬出去，直插对岸。” 从碉堡内墙通往壕沟的门立刻打开了，它与城堡主墙的出击口位于一直线上。临时桥梁随即直插过去，横亘在水面上，跨越了碉堡和城堡之间的距离，形成了一条晃动的危险的通道，可以容纳两个人并排越过壕沟。黑甲骑士完全明白对敌人攻其不备的重要性，带着塞德里克飞快地跳上浮桥，直奔对岸，一到那里马上举起战斧，捶打城门，把它打得隆隆直响。圣殿骑士从碉堡撤退时，破坏了原有的吊桥，但仍留下了半截，它附着在城门上端，正好对黑甲骑士和塞德里克起了掩护作用，挡住了从城墙上发出的箭和石块。但是跟在骑士后面的人，却得不到这种掩护，其中两个马上中了箭，还有两个掉进了壕沟，其余的人只得退回碉堡。 现在塞德里克和黑甲骑士的处境确实十分危险，幸亏碉堡顶上的弓箭手不断向对面的城楼射箭，分散了驻守在那里的士兵的注意力，这才使他们的两个首领在矢石交加下，获得了喘息的机会；否则他们恐怕也难免被击中。但是他们的处境仍危如累卵，而且随着每一分钟的过去，危险都在增加。 “你们这些窝囊废！”德布拉西朝他身边的士兵大喝道，“还算是射箭的能手呢，这两只狗躲在城墙脚下，你们居然奈何他们不得？如果没有别的办法，至少可以举起城墙上的石头往下砸。把十字镐和杠杆找来，把墙上这个大尖顶往下扔！”他说，指指城楼胸墙上耸起的一大块石头雕刻。 就在这时，围攻的人看到塔楼一角升起了一面红旗，那就是乌尔莉加向塞德里克讲的信号。第一个发现它的，便是勇敢的庄户人洛克斯利，当时他正赶往碉堡，想亲自察看一下围攻的进展情况。 “圣乔治啊！”他大喊道，“快活的圣乔治保佑英格兰吧！勇敢的朋友们，冲上去！为什么要让好心的骑士和尊贵的塞德里克单独攻打城门？过去，疯修士，显显本领，让大家看到念经的人也能打仗——过去，勇敢的庄稼人！我们一定可以拿下城堡，我们在里边有内应。瞧，那面旗子，它是约定的信号——托奎尔斯通是我们的！为了荣誉，为了战利品，冲过去！再加一把劲，城堡便属于我们了！” 他一边说，一边挽起弓，峻的一箭，射中了城墙上一个守兵的胸口，那人在德布拉西的指挥下，正准备撬起一块大石头，向塞德里克和黑甲骑士头顶砸去。第二个兵从死人手中夺下铁棍，继续撬松那块大石雕，但就在这时，又一支箭穿透了他的帽盔，他随即从城墙上掉进壕沟死了。守兵们害怕了，看来任何盔甲都抵挡不住那个可怕的射手的利箭。 “你们这些孬种，想逃走不成！”德布拉西喊道，“圣但尼斯万岁！把杠杆给我！” 他抓起杠杆，又开始撬已经松动的大石块，它这么重，如果扔下去，不仅足以摧毁残留的吊桥，使躲在它下面的两个进攻者失去藏身之地，而且可以把通过壕沟的浮桥上那些粗糙的木板砸烂。大家都看到了这危险，甚至勇猛的修士也提高警惕，不敢踏上木筏了。洛克斯利拉开弓，向德布拉酉接连射了三箭，但三箭都遇到了骑士的防身铠甲，弹了回来。 “该死的西班牙护身钢甲！”洛克斯利嚷道。“要是英国铁匠铸造的，它早像丝绸一样给这些箭射穿了。”于是他大叫道：“伙伴们！朋友们！尊贵的塞德里克！快退下，让破桥板掉下来。” 他的警告没有人听到，在黑甲骑士使劲捶击城门的声浪中，哪怕二十只军号同时吹响也无济于事。忠诚的葛四确实跳上了浮桥，想提醒塞德里克面临的危险，或者与他同归于尽。但是他的警告也许来得太迟了，那块大石头已经摇摇欲坠，可是这时出现了一个新情况，使德布拉西的计谋未能如愿以偿，原来他耳边突然响起了圣殿骑士说话的声音： “一切都完了，德布拉西，城堡起火了。” “你疯了不成，胡说什么！”骑士答道。 “西边已经烟雾迷漫，一片火光；我尽力扑救，但没有成功。” 严峻冷静是布里恩·布瓦吉贝尔性格的基本特点，现在他便以他特有的沉着传达了这个可怕的消息，然而他的朋友却不能以同样的沉着听取这个消息，马上慌了手脚。 “天上的圣徒啊！”德布拉酉说，“现在怎么办？我起誓，我愿意向利库日的圣尼古拉捐献一个纯金烛台……” “废话！”圣殿骑士说。“照我说的做。你带着你的人下去，装出打算突围的样子，打开边门。门外只有两个人在浮桥上，你把他们推下壕沟，然后冲向碉堡。我会冲出正门，从外面攻打碉堡。只要我们能夺回这个据点，我们便可以守住城堡，万无一失，等待援兵的到来，至少等他们答应我们的条件，与我们讲和。” “这主意不错，”德布拉西说，“我保证办到。圣殿骑士，你不会骗我吧？” “我保证与你配合，决不骗你！”布瓦吉贝尔说。“但是看在上帝分上，你得赶快！” 德布拉西赶紧把他的人召集到一起，冲下城墙，直奔边门，命令立即把它打开。但是门刚开了一条缝，黑甲骑士便凭他惊人的膂力挤了进来，德布拉西和他的部下怎么也阻挡不住，前面两人马上倒下了，其余几个也不顾首领的吆喝，纷纷躲避。 “你们这些狗东西！”德布拉西喝道，“你们就让两个人把我们的唯一出路堵住不成？” “他是魔鬼！”一个久经沙场的老兵回答，在黑甲勇士的战斧前步步后退。 “如果他是魔鬼，难道你就让他把你送进地狱不成？”德布拉西答道。“城堡在我们后面起火了，你们这些混蛋！我们只能从绝望中杀开一条生路，向前突围！让我亲自来对付这个大汉。” 德布拉西那一天的表现确实勇猛无比，不愧是那个可怕的时代中一员身经百战的骁将。边门的入口处有一个拱顶过道，两个凶猛的勇士便在这里肉搏，德布拉西挥舞着剑，黑甲骑士用沉重的战斧厮杀，你来我往，打得难解难分，武器的碰击声在过道里回旋不断。最后，诺曼人挨了一斧头，尽管它的力量给盾牌抵消了一部分，没有使他一命呜呼，但那千钧压力落到了他的帽盔上，还是打得他直挺挺躺在地下了。 “投降吧，德布拉西，”黑甲骑士说，俯下身子，拔出匕首，举在对方的脸甲前，这种匕首是骑士们用来结果敌人性命的，它锋利无比，被称为“仁慈之剑”。“投降吧，莫里斯·德布拉西，只有无条件投降才是你的唯一生路。” “我不能向一个无名无姓的胜利者投降，”德布拉西回答，声音微弱，“把你的名字告诉我，否则就一切听便。我绝不能让人说，莫里斯·德布拉西当了一个无名的乡巴佬的俘虏。” 黑甲骑士凑在战败者的耳边，小声说了句什么。 “我无条件投降，听候处置，”诺曼人回答，那严厉坚定的口吻一下子变得灰心丧气、诚惶诚恐了。 “到碉堡中去，”胜利者用威严的声音说，“在那里等待我的进一步命令。” “然而首先让我告诉你一件你应该知道的事，”德布拉西说。“艾文荷的威尔弗莱德受了伤，关在城堡里，不马上救出，便会死在大火中。” “艾文荷的威尔弗莱德！”黑甲骑士惊叫道，“关在城堡里，死在大火中！如果他的头发烧焦一根，城堡中的每个人都得为他抵命。把他住的房间告诉我！” “从那边盘旋的楼梯上去，便可以到达他的屋子，”德布拉西说。“你要我给你带路吗？”他又用讨好的口气说。 “不用。到碉堡去，在那里等我的命令。我不信任你，德布拉西。” 在这场搏斗和随后的简短谈话进行时，塞德里克看到边门已经大开，马上带领一队人，其中包括高大的修士，冲过浮桥，打退了德布拉西那些垂头丧气、失去斗志的部下，他们有的乞求饶命，有的作了无益的反抗，大部分逃进了院子。德布拉西本人则从地上爬了起来，向他的胜利者投出了伤心的一瞥，便摘下帽盔作为投降的标志，然后向碉堡走去，半路上遇到洛克斯利，向他交出了剑。 随着火势的扩大，它的迹象从犹太姑娘护理和照料艾文荷的那间屋子里，也很快就能看清楚了。他刚睡下不久，便给战斗的喧闹声惊醒。犹太姑娘又在他的再三要求下，站到窗口，一边观察，一边向他报告进攻的情况了。但是烟雾的增加使她透不出气，她的观察中断了一会。最后大量浓烟卷进了屋子，战斗的喧闹声中甚至夹杂着要水喝的呼喊声，这使他们意识到了这新的危险的到来。 “城堡着火了，”丽贝卡说，“它在燃烧！我们怎样才能搭救自己呢？” “快走，丽贝卡，你还是自己逃命吧，”艾文荷说，“因为没有任何力量能救我了。” “我不走，”丽贝卡回答，“我们或者一起获救，或者一起烧死。还有，伟大的上帝啊！我的父亲——我的父亲，他不知怎么样啦？” 正在这时，房门打开了，圣殿骑士出现在门口，他的样子那么可怕，那身镀金铠甲破了，沾满了血迹，头上的羽饰一部分脱落了，一部分烧焦了。“我终于找到了你，”他对丽贝卡说，“你可以证明，我讲话是算数的，我会与你同甘共苦。现在只有一条路是安全的，我历尽艰险才来到这儿，给你带路；起来吧，马上跟我走！” “我一个人不跟你走，”丽贝卡答道。“如果你是妇女生的，如果你还有一点人性，如果你的心还没有硬得像你的胸甲一样，那么你也应搭救我年迈的父亲，还有这个受伤的骑士！” “一个骑士，”圣殿骑士用他特有的冷静答道，“丽贝卡，一个骑士，他应族自己面对他的命运，不论那是以剑或火的形式出现；至于犹太人，谁管得了他遇到什么命运？” “野蛮的武士！”丽贝卡说，“我宁可烧死，也不接受你的拯救！” “这由不得你自己选择，丽贝卡；你拒绝过我一次，但是第二次，你休想再用死来要挟我。” 他这么说着，一把抓起吓得战战兢兢、大喊大叫的少女，挟住她往外就走，不管她如何哭喊，也不管艾文荷如何在他后面大声咒骂和威胁：“你这只圣殿的野狗，你玷污了你们的旗号——放下小姑娘！你是叛贼，布瓦吉贝尔，这是艾文荷在命令你！你是无赖，你得用鲜血偿还这笔债！” 就在这时，黑甲骑士跨进了房间，一边说道：“多亏你的喊叫，我总算找到你了，威尔弗莱德。” “如果你是真正的骑士，不要顾到我，”威尔弗莱德答道，“快去追赶那个强盗——快去搭救罗文娜小姐——快去找尊贵的塞德里克！” “我会去找他们，”黑甲骑士答道，“但救你是首要的。” 他抱起艾文荷，挟着他走出了屋子，显得那么轻松，就像圣殿骑士带走丽贝卡一样。然后他直奔边门，把伤员交给了两个庄户人照料，重又返回堡内，帮助搭救其他俘虏。 这时一个塔楼已笼罩在火光中，烈焰不断冒出窗洞和射击日。但是在城堡的其余部分，厚实的墙壁和拱形屋顶阻止了火势的蔓延，在那些屋子里，人们仍在互相杀戮，这与已经控制了别处的自然力量相比，也许同样可怕；因为围城的人正从一个房间到另一个房间，追杀城堡的守兵，他们对暴虐成性的牛面将军的部下早已恨入骨髓，现在正是报仇泄恨的机会，哪里肯轻饶他们。大多数守兵抵抗到了最后一息，不多的人乞求饶命，但没有一人得到宽恕。空中回荡着惨叫声和武器的碰击声，地上到处是绝望和垂死的人留下的粘滑的血泊。 在这幅混乱的景象中，塞德里克东奔西走地寻找着罗文娜，忠诚的葛四不顾危险，紧跟在他后面，穿过混战的场合时，尽力挡开瞄准他主人的刀枪。尊贵的撒克逊人很幸运，终于找到了义女的房间，这时她已抛弃了一切逃生的希望，在痛苦中把一个耶稣受难十字架抱在胸前，坐在椅上但求快些死去。他把她交给葛四，让他把她安全地带往碉堡，那条路现在已没有敌人，而且还没有给火焰阻断。办完这事后，忠诚的塞德里克又赶紧去寻找他的朋友阿特尔斯坦，决心不顾自身的危险，务必救出英国王室的最后一个苗裔。但是在塞德里克到达他自己禁闭过的那间古老大厅以前，汪八这个精灵鬼已救出了他自己和他的难友。 原来外面的一阵阵喊杀声，说明战斗已进入白热阶段，于是小丑用尽平生的力气，开始大叫：“圣乔治和白龙万岁！强大的圣乔治保佑快活的英格兰！城堡陷落了！”与此同时，他从丢在大厅周围地上的生锈的盔甲中，抓起两三件，把它们敲得砰砰直响，这使他的喊叫更显得惊心动魄。 大厅外面的前室驻守着一队卫兵，他们早已惶惶不安，丧魂落魄，汪八的吵闹更把他们吓得屁滚尿流，顾不上关门，便离开那里，要找圣殿骑士报告战况，声称敌人已进入旧大厅。这样，两个囚徒轻而易举地走出牢房，进了前室，又从那里走进了城堡的院子，这时最后的战斗正在那里进行。凶狠的圣殿骑士坐在马上，周围簇拥着几个骑马和徒步的卫士，这些人跟随着那位著名的将领，打算在他的率领下冲出重围，争取最后的逃生机会。根据他的命令，吊桥放下了，但通道已被包围；因为弓箭手们本来只从对面射击，对城堡进行骚扰，一看到火焰冲天，吊桥又放下了，马上成群结队拥向人口处，这既是为了不让守兵逃跑，也是指望趁城堡还没烧成灰烬之前，进入里面掠夺战利品。另一方面，从边门进来的一支攻城队伍，现在已拥进院子，猛烈攻打残余的守兵，使他们陷入了腹背受敌的困境。 然而这些士兵在绝望的驱使下，又得到了他们那位毫不气馁的领导人以身作则的鼓舞，打得非常顽强，而且他们武器精良，虽然人数寥寥无几，还是不只一次打退了对方的进攻。丽贝卡给圣殿骑士的一个萨拉森奴隶挟持在马背上，处在这一小队人的中央；尽管这场血战已乱成一片，布瓦吉贝尔仍密切注意着她的安全。他不时来到她旁边，不顾自身的安危，把他的三角形钢板盾牌挡在她前面；又不时从她旁边冲出去，一边呐喊，一边向前疾驰，把挡在前面的不少进攻者打翻在地，然后重新回到她的身边。 读者知道，阿特尔斯坦一向行动迂缓懒散，然而他并不胆小，看到圣殿骑士在不遗余力地保护一个妇女，怀疑这便是罗文娜，那个骑士正企图把她抢走，于是不顾可能遇到的一切反抗，冲了过去。 “凭圣爱德华的英灵起誓，”他喊道，“我一定得从那个狂妄自大的骑上手中搭救她，让他死在我的面前！” “想想你在干什么！”汪八喊道，“看看清楚，不要把青蛙当鱼；我敢对大起誓，那不是我们的罗文娜小姐，你瞧她那一络络长长的黑头发！不成，既然你分不清黑白，你可以当你的首领，我却不想跟着你送死；我要死也得知道我是为谁牺牲的。何况你身上没有盔甲！要知道，丝绸帽子是经不起刀枪一击的。不过，既然你执迷不悟要跳水，那就只得让你跳了。愿上帝保佑你吧，不怕死的阿特尔斯坦！”他最后说，放开了他一直抓紧的撒克逊人的袍角。 后者这时已从地上抓起一把狼牙棒，那是躺在它旁边的一个快死的人刚从手中放下的。这样，他举着它，向圣殿骑士一伙人冲去，一边忽左忽右地接连挥舞着它，每一下都打倒了一个守兵，因为阿特尔斯坦力大无穷，此刻又怒不可遏，更显得勇猛异常；不过一会儿工夫，他已来到离布瓦吉贝尔不过两码的地方，用他的洪亮嗓音大喊： “回来，阴险的圣殿骑士！放开她，你不配碰她；回来，你们这群奸淫掳掠、丧尽天良的强盗！” “你这畜生！”圣殿骑士咬牙切齿地答道，“我得教训教训你，让你知道诽谤圣殿骑士是怎么回事。”他一边说，一边调转马头，让它朝着撒克逊人稍稍举起前腿，自己则踩住脚楼，挺直身子，借着马向前扑下的势头，举起刀朝阿特尔斯坦头上狠狠砍来。 “不得了，”汪八喊道，“绸帽子可挡不住钢刀啊！”圣殿骑士的武器那么锋利，不幸的撒克逊人刚举起狼牙棒，想挡开它，狼牙棒那坚韧粗大的柄，已像一条柳枝那么给砍断，于是钢刀落到了阿特尔斯坦的头上，他当即倒在了地上。 “哈！黑白旗万岁！”布瓦吉贝尔喊道，“谁诽谤圣殿骑士，这就是他的下场！”他利用阿特尔斯坦倒下所造成的沮丧气氛，大声叫道：“要活命的人快跟我来！” 随即冲过吊桥，驱散了拦阻他的弓箭手们。跟他一起突围的有他的萨拉森奴隶，还有大约五六个士兵，他们都骑着马。这些人撤退时虽然遭到了密集的矢石的攻击，十分危险，但圣殿骑士依然不顾一切骑马飞驰，绕到碉堡那里，按照原定的计划要找德布拉西，他以为他可能已占领碉堡。 “德布拉西！德布拉西！”他喊道，“你在那儿吗？” 一我在这儿，”德布拉酉答道，一但我已成了俘虏。” “我救得了你吗？”布瓦吉贝尔叫道。 “不必了，”德布拉西回答，“我是自己投降的，无条件投降的。我得做一个诚实的俘虏。你自己逃命吧；注意，鹰隼已逃出笼子。还是让大海把你和英国隔开吧；其余我不便多说了。” “好吧，”圣殿骑士答道，“这是你自己要待在那儿的，记住，我没有失约，没有抛弃朋友。那些鹰隼爱在哪儿就在哪儿，我不管，圣殿会堂的墙壁就足够保护我了，我一到那儿，就像苍鹭回到了窠中。” 这么说完，他便带领他的部下飞驰而去了。 那些没有骑上马的守兵，在圣殿骑士离开后，仍继续与进攻的人作着拼死的搏斗，但这主要是由于得不到宽恕，不是对逃生还抱有希望；大火迅速蔓延到了城堡的各个部分，点燃这场大火的乌尔莉加站在塔楼顶上，那副样子就像古代的复仇女神在高唱战歌，这种歌是撒克逊人皈依基督教以前，他们的吟唱诗人常在战场上引吭高歌的。她没戴帽子，满头白发披散在脑后，眼睛炯炯发亮，报仇泄恨的快感与精神错乱的怒火交织在一起。她举起纺线竿，在头顶挥舞，仿佛她是一个命运女神，掌握和操纵着人的生命之线(注1)。在那场大火和屠杀中，她高唱着粗野的赞歌，它有几节保存在我们的传说中： 白龙的儿子们， 把钢刀磨得快快的！ 亨吉斯特的女儿们， 让火把烧得亮亮的！ 磨快钢刀不是为了在宴会上切肉！ 这是锋利无比的战斗的大刀； 点亮火炬不是为了照明新婚的闺房， 它发出的是蕴藏着怒火的青光。 磨快钢刀吧，乌鸦在啼叫了！ 点亮火把吧，魔鬼在吼叫了！ 白龙的儿子们，把钢刀磨得快快的！ 亨吉斯特的女儿们，让火炬烧得亮亮的！ 乌云覆盖了撒克逊庄主的城堡； 雄鹰驾驭着乌云在啸叫。 不要叫啦，驾驭乌云的灰色骑士， 你的筵席已经摆好！ 瓦尔哈拉(注2)的姊妹们正翘首以待， 准备迎接亨吉斯特的民族送来的客人。 瓦尔哈拉的姊妹们，摇动你们的一绺绺黑发 打响你们欢迎的铃鼓吧！ 许多高贵的脚正迈向你们的大厅， 许多戴帽盔的头颅要在这里安息。 黑暗降临在撒克逊庄主的城堡中， 浓密的乌云笼罩在它的周围； 但勇士的鲜血马上会把一切染红！ 毁灭森林的大火摇动红色的盔缨， 高举明亮的军旗滚滚向前， 它会把豪华的府即吞噬一空， 它会把浴血奋战的勇士 淹没在一片森严的红色海洋中， 它的欢乐来自砍杀的刀剑和破裂的盾牌， 它的喜悦便是吸食伤口中咝咝流出的鲜血！ 一切全得灭亡！ 剑劈开了帽盔， 长枪刺穿了坚固的铠甲， 火焰吞没了王侯的住宅， 兵器摧毁了战斗的防线。 一切全得灭亡！ 亨吉斯特的民族消失了， 霍尔萨的名字不再存在！ 但是战斗的孩子们，不要向命运屈服！ 让你们的刀剑像喝酒一样痛饮鲜血， 在熊熊燃烧的大厅中， 尽情享受屠杀的盛筵吧！ 只要一息尚存就得拼命战斗， 既不怜悯也不畏缩， 因为复仇的机会转瞬即逝， 憎恨本身也难免烟消云散！ 我同样必然死亡！(注3) -------- (注1)希腊神话中的命运女神一共三个，一个纺织生命之线，一个决定生命之线的长短，一个负责切断生命之线，厄弗利德的纺纱便是由此而来。 (注2)北欧神话中接待阵亡的英灵的神殿。 (注3)见作者附注六。——原注 现在烈焰奔腾，什么也阻挡不住了，它像巨大的烽火冲向夜空，把周围遥远广袤的一片乡村照得通明。塔楼挟带着烧红的屋顶和椽子，一个接一个地倒坍，战斗的人被迫退入了院子。战败的一方只剩了不多几人，他们纷纷逃窜，躲进了附近的树林。一群群战胜者汇集在各处，望着这场大火，有些惊异，也有些害怕，火光把他们和他们的武器都照得泛出了暗红的光泽。在很长一段时间内，大家可以看到，撒克逊人乌尔莉加疯疯癫癫地凌空站立着，从她选择的高处挥舞胳臂，发出一阵阵狂笑，仿佛她是一位女王，正在指挥她点燃的这场大火。最后，随着一场骇人的巨响，整个塔楼塌陷了，她也葬身在火窟中，与残害她的暴君同归于尽了。一时间，旁观的战士们吓得不敢作声，沉静统治了一切，几分钟内，他们除了划十字，没有动过一根手指。这时传来了洛克斯利的声音：“欢呼吧，老乡们！恶霸的巢穴覆灭了！请大家带着各自的战利品，前往我们预定的集合地点——哈特山林区约会树；因为天亮以后，我们便要在我们自己的伙伴之间，以及参加这次伟大复仇行动的朋友们之间，进行公正的分配了。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/287/2693.html","bookId":195,"book":{"id":195,"title":"英雄艾文荷
