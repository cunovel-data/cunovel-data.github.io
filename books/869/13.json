{"id":18677,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. THE FIRST ALARM.","content":"One morning Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw went down to spend a long day with the Mitfords. The latter had sent up the boat over-night, and they started the first thing in the morning. For the two or three days previous Jack, the young native, had more than once spoken to Wilfrid of the propriety of the hands keeping near the house, but Wilfrid had failed to obtain from him any specific reasons for the warning. \"Bad men come down from Waikato,\" he said. \"Much talkee talkee among natives.\" \"But what do they talk about, Jack?\" Jack shook his head. \"Jack no hear talkee. Men come to hut and talk with father. Other Maoris on land steal in and talk too, but no talk before Jack; always turn him out or send him on errand. But Jack hear sometimes a word, and think that trouble come. Young master better not go far away by himself, and tell two white men to keep close to hut. Perhaps nothing come, but better to be on guard.\"[Pg 225] \"Very well, Jack; I am obliged to you for the warning. I will tell the Grimstones not to go out to the outlying clearings, but to occupy themselves with what they can find to do near home.\" Jack nodded. \"That best, Master Wilfrid, but no talk too much with me. If my people thought I speak to you then trouble come to Jack.\" Wilfrid nodded, and without saying anything to his father and mother told the Grimstones to keep near the house. \"After you have done shooting of a morning,\" he said, \"instead of bringing your guns into the house as usual take them down with you to the place where you are at work, so that they will be handy in case of necessity. Most likely there is no danger whatever; but I have heard a rumour that some people from Waikato have come into this neighbourhood, and if so no doubt they are trying to get the tribes here to join the Hau-Haus. I do not think that there is much chance of their succeeding, for the natives have always been very friendly, and there has been no dispute about land or any other grievance; but when one knows how suddenly they have risen in other places, it is better to take precautions.\" After breakfast on the morning when his father and mother had started, Wilfrid strolled out on to the verandah, and stood for some little time hesitating what he should do. The Grimstones had just started to look up some cattle in one of the distant clearings, one of the native hands having reported the evening before two of the animals were missing. \"I will go not far till they come back,\" he said to himself. \"The garden wants hoeing. Weeds grow as[Pg 226] fast here as they do at home. That will be just the job for me.\" He was about to turn to enter the house, when he saw four natives emerge from the trees and make towards him. \"Marion,\" he said through the open door, \"get the guns down from the rack, and see that they are capped and ready. There are four natives coming towards the house. I daresay they are friendly, and are probably only on the way down the river to look for work, still as we are alone you cannot be too careful.\" Hearing Marion reply \"All right, Wilfrid!\" the lad leant against the door in a careless attitude, and awaited the coming of the natives. As they approached he saw they were all strangers to him, although he knew most of the natives in the neighbourhood by sight, for these not infrequently came in to barter a pig or a sheep for tobacco, sugar, or other things necessary to them. The natives as they came up gave the usual salutation of good-day, to which Wilfrid replied. \"We are hungry,\" a tall Maori, who by his dress appeared to be a chief, said. \"I will get you something to eat,\" Wilfrid answered. The Maoris would have followed into the house, but he stopped and said sharply, \"We do not allow strangers in the house. Those we know are free to enter and depart as they choose, but I have not seen any of you before. If you will sit down on that bench outside I will bring you food.\" He soon reappeared with a dish of maize and boiled pork, for a supply was generally kept in readiness in case any of the natives should come in.[Pg 227] \"Shuffle about and make a noise,\" he said to Marion as she got the dish from the cupboard. \"They cannot know who are inside, and if they mean mischief—and honestly I do not like their looks—they will be more likely to try it on if they think that I am alone.\" The Maoris took the food in silence, and as they ate it Wilfrid was amused to hear Marion stamping heavily about inside, and occasionally speaking as if to her father. He could see that the men were listening, and they exchanged words in a low tone with each other. Presently the leader of the party said, \"Drink!\" Wilfrid went in and brought out a pitcher of water. \"Gin!\" the chief said shortly. \"I have no gin to give you,\" Wilfrid replied; \"we do not keep spirits.\" The natives rose to their feet. \"We will come in and see,\" the leader said. \"No you won\u0027t!\" Wilfrid said firmly. \"I have given you what food there is in the house, and you are welcome to it; but strangers don\u0027t come into the house unless they are invited.\" The native laid his hand on Wilfrid\u0027s shoulder to push him aside, but four months of chopping and digging had hardened every muscle in the lad\u0027s body. He did not move an inch, but jerked the Maori\u0027s hand off his shoulder. With an exclamation of anger the native drew a heavy knobbed stick from the girdle round his waist, but before he could raise it to strike another figure appeared at the door. Marion held a gun in her hand which she raised to her shoulder. \"drop that,\" she said in a clear ringing voice, \"or I fire!\" Taken by surprise, and seeing the rifle pointed full[Pg 228] at his head, the chief instantly dropped his club. At the same instant Wilfrid sprang to the door, exclaiming \"Go in, Marion!\" and before the natives had recovered from their surprise the door was shut and barred. They had not been deceived by Marion\u0027s attempt to personate a man, and their sharp ears had told them while eating their meal that there was but one person in the house, and that it was a girl. They knew that there was no other about, having watched the house for some time, and had therefore anticipated that the work of murder and plunder would be accomplished without difficulty. The instant the door was closed they bounded away at the top of their speed to the shelter of the bush, expecting every moment to hear the report of a rifle behind them; but the Renshaws had not thought of firing. \"Well done, Marion!\" Wilfrid exclaimed as soon as the door was fastened. \"I was on the point of springing upon him when I heard your voice behind me; I think that I could have tripped him backwards, but if I had done so the others would have been upon me with their clubs. Now, let us close and fasten the shutters, though I do not think we need have any fear of their coming back. In each case we have heard of they have always fallen on the settlers suddenly and killed them before they had time for resistance, and I do not think there is a chance of their trying to attack us now that they know we are ready for them. I expect that they were passing down to some of their people below, and seeing, as they thought, a defenceless hut, thought it would be an easy business to plunder it and knock on the head anyone they[Pg 229] might find here. Now that they have failed they will probably go on their journey again.\" \"I was horribly frightened, Wilfrid,\" Marion said when they joined each other in the sitting-room after making all the fastenings secure. \"You did not look frightened a bit, Marion; and you certainly gave that fellow a tremendous scare. Didn\u0027t he drop his club sharp? And now, what do you think we had better do? The first thing is to get the Grimstones in. Those fellows may have been watching for some time and saw them go out.\" \"But they have got their guns with them, Wilfrid. The natives would surely not think of attacking two men with guns when they have nothing but their clubs.\" \"No, they certainly would not think of doing that, Marion. But the chances are that they have got guns, and that they left them in the bush when they sallied out, as they wanted to look peaceful and take us by surprise.\" \"I did not think of that, Wilfrid. Yes, perhaps they have guns. Well, you know, it has always been agreed that in case of danger three shots should be fired as a warning to those who might be out. If we fire and they hear it they will hurry back.\" \"Yes, but they might be shot as they make their way down to the house; that is what I am afraid of.\" Marion was silent for a minute. \"Do you know where they have gone to, Wilfrid?\" \"They have gone in the first place to the clearing with those two big trees standing in the centre, but I[Pg 230] cannot say where they may go to afterwards, for they had to look for four or five of the cattle that had strayed away.\" \"I can slip out from the window in the men\u0027s room and get into the bush and work round to the clearing, Wilfrid, and fire three shots there; that would bring them to me at once. You see, the natives couldn\u0027t cross the clearing here without your having them under your gun.\" \"No, Marion,\" Wilfrid said decidedly; \"that is not to be thought of. If they saw you going they could work up through the bush on their side to the top of the clearing, and then follow you. No; I think I will fire the three shots. We have talked it over several times, you know, and the Grimstones have been told that if they heard the alarm they must make their way cautiously to the top of the clearing and see what is going on before they venture to make for the house. As soon as I see them I can shout to them to keep to the bush on their left till they get opposite the house. Everything is so still that one can hear a shout a long way, and I feel sure I could make them understand as far off as the end of the clearing. It isn\u0027t as if we were sure that these fellows were still hanging about ready to attack us; the probabilities are all the other way. They would have murdered us if they could have taken us by surprise, but that is a different thing altogether to making an attack now they know we are armed and ready.\" Taking three of the rifles, Wilfrid opened one of the shutters at the back of the house and fired them, with an interval of about five seconds between each shot,[Pg 231] then he stood at the window and watched the upper end of the glade. \"Dear me!\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"I am sorry we fired.\" \"Why?\" Marion asked in surprise. \"Because Mr. Atherton is sure to hear it if he is at home, and will come hurrying over; and if these fellows are still there he may come right into the middle of them.\" \"I do not think he would do that, Wilfrid,\" Marion said, after thinking for a moment or two. \"Mr. Atherton is not like the Grimstones. He has been in all sorts of adventures, and though I am sure he will come to our help as soon as he can, I think he would take every precaution. He would know that the natives will be likely to come from above, and therefore be between him and us, and would come along carefully so as not to be surprised.\" \"I hope so, I am sure,\" Wilfrid said; \"for he is an awfully good fellow. Still, as you say, he is sure to keep his eyes opened, and unless they surprise him I should back him against the four of them.\" In a quarter of an hour they heard a shout from the edge of the clearing. \"There are the Allens!\" Wilfrid exclaimed as he leapt to the door. \"I forgot about them, although of course they are nearer than Mr. Atherton. All right!\" he shouted; \"you can come on.\" The two Allens ran across the open space between the wood and the house. \"What is it, Wilfrid?\" they exclaimed as they came up. \"You fired the alarm-signal, did you not?\" Both were breathless with the speed at which they had run. They had been engaged in felling when they heard[Pg 232] the shot, and had thrown down their axes, run into the hut for their guns, and made for The Glade at the top of their speed. In a few words Wilfrid explained what had happened, and that there was every reason to believe that four hostile neighbours were lurking in the bush on the opposite side of the glade. The Allens at once volunteered to go up to the head of the clearing to warn the Grimstones. Returning to the point where they had left the forest, they made their way among the trees until they reached the upper end of the clearing; then they sat down and listened. In a few minutes they heard the sound of breaking twigs. \"Here come the men,\" the elder Allen said; \"the Maoris would come along noiselessly.\" Two or three minutes later the Grimstones came up at a run, accompanied by their two dogs. \"This way,\" James Allen said. \"What is it, sir?\" Bob Grimstone gasped. \"We were a long way in the woods when we thought we heard three shots. We were not quite sure about it, but we started back as fast as we could come. There is nothing wrong, I hope?\" \"Fortunately nothing has happened,\" James Allen replied; \"but four strange Maoris came up to the house, and would certainly have murdered Mr. Wilfrid and his sister if they had not been prepared for them. Whether they are in the bush now or not I do not know; but we have come up to warn you not to go up the clearing, as, if they are there, they might pick you off as you did so. We must come down under shelter of the trees till we are opposite the house.\" In ten minutes they reached the house. Just as they[Pg 233] did so Mr. Atherton appeared at the edge of the wood which they had just left. \"Thank God you are all safe!\" he said as he strolled up to the house. \"Your three shots gave me a fright; but as I heard no more I was relieved, for the signal told that you had not been taken by surprise, and as there was no more firing it was clear they had drawn off.\" \"But how did you get to that side of the clearing, Mr. Atherton?\" \"I followed the wood till within a few hundred yards of the clearing, as I made sure if there were hostile natives about they would be at the edge of the bush. Then I got down into the river and waded along the edge. The bank in front here was not high enough to hide me, though I stooped as much as I could; but I reckoned that all eyes would be fixed on the house, and it was not likely I should be noticed. And now, what is it all about? I am sure you would not have fired the signal unless there had been good cause for the alarm.\" Wilfrid related what had taken place. \"Well done, Miss Marion!\" Mr. Atherton said when he had finished. \"It was lucky for your brother that you did not go with your father and mother this morning. \"It was lucky,\" Wilfrid agreed; \"but at the same time, if I had been quite alone I should have closed the shutters and door as they came up, and kept indoors. I only ventured to meet them outside because I knew that Marion had a gun ready to hand to me the moment I wanted it.\" \"Yes; but you see there was not time to hand you[Pg 234] the gun, Wilfrid, as it turned out, and you would have been knocked on the head to a certainty if your sister had not come to your rescue.\" \"That I certainly should; and I know that I owe Marion my life. What do you think we had better do now?\" \"I do not think we can do anything, Wilfrid, beyond trying to find out whether the fellows who came here were alone, or were part of a larger party. Where are your natives?\" \"The three men are chopping, and Jack went out with the Grimstones to look for the cattle.\" \"Was he with you when you heard the shots fired, Bob?\" \"He was with us a minute or two before, and was following a track. After we heard the signal we did not think anything more about him, and whether he followed us or went on looking after the cattle I do not know.\" \"If you go to the door, Wilfrid, and give a loud cooey it will bring him in if he is within hearing. You may be sure that he heard the signal, for his ears are keener than those of your men; but he would not rush straight back, but would come cautiously through the woods according to his nature.\" Wilfrid went to the door and gave a loud cooey. A minute later the Maori issued from the bush, nearly opposite the house, and ran in. \"That\u0027s just where the natives took to the bush,\" Wilfrid said. \"Perhaps he will be able to tell us something about them.\" \"I expect he has been scouting,\" Mr. Atherton said,[Pg 235] \"and his coming boldly out from that point is a pretty sure proof that the natives have made off. Well, Jack, so you heard our signal?\" Jack nodded. \"And what have you been doing since?\" Wilfrid asked. \"Jack went through the bush fast till he got near house, then, as the guns were not going off, he knew there could be no attack; but thought black man might be lying in bush, so he crept and crawled. Presently he heard man talk, and then saw four Maori walking fast away from house. He only heard them say as he passed, \u0027No use now; too many Pakehas. Come another day and finish them all.\u0027 Jack was coming straight to house when he heard cooey.\" \"You have seen nothing of your father and the other two men, Jack?\" The Maori boy shook his head. \"They chop wood; perhaps not heard signal.\" \"More likely they heard, but thought it better to stay away,\" Wilfrid said. \"No got guns; they not fighting-men,\" Jack said, as if in excuse. \"There is something in that,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"The Hau-Haus have always proved themselves even more merciless towards the friendly natives than towards the whites; and these men, being unarmed, might, even with the best disposition in the world, be afraid to come to the house. At any rate, I am glad those fellows have made off. You see, they were in a position to shoot any of us if they got the chance, while we were scarce in a position to return the compliment.\"[Pg 236] \"Why not?\" James Allen asked. \"Because, although we could have now no doubt whatever as to their intentions, they have committed no actual assault. They tried their best to push their way into the house, and when Wilfrid opposed them one of them drew his club; but they might say this was only done to frighten him, and that they had no thought of using it. If they had fired a shot, we should of course be justified in killing them; but were we to begin the shooting, the whole tribe they belong to would take it up, and there would be a cry for vengeance; and even if nothing were done at once, we should be marked down to be wiped out at the first opportunity. \"We shall learn in a day or two whether the matter was serious or not,\" Mr. Atherton went on. \"If there is anything like a general defection of the natives in these parts yours will not have been the only place threatened, and we shall hear of attacks on other settlers. If we do not hear of such attacks we can safely put it down that these four fellows were mere haphazard passers, like tramps at home, who were tempted by the fact that the house contained only two persons. In that case we need feel no further anxiety; for as you would be able to recognize them if you met them anywhere, they would not be likely to come near this part of the district again. At any rate I will set off with the boy here and one of the dogs, and will follow up their tracks and see if they have gone well away. I have no doubt they have done so; still, it will be more comfortable to make certain of it.\" \"By the way, Bob,\" Wilfrid said, \"don\u0027t you take[Pg 237] those two dogs out again. I don\u0027t think they would be any good for hunting cattle, and would be much more likely to frighten and hunt them away than to help you to drive them in. At any rate they were bought as guards, and are to remain about the house. Shall I go with you, Mr. Atherton?\" \"No, thank you, Wilfrid; Jack will be enough to help me follow the tracks, for what he heard them say is almost proof that they have gone. I shall go round to my own place when I have followed them fairly off the land, but will come round here to-morrow morning, when we will hold a general council of war. It is no use my coming back again this evening, as your father and the others will not be here before that time. It is possible that they will bring us some news from the Mitfords. If there is any trouble anywhere along the river Mitford is sure to be the first to hear of it. I will send a message back by Jack when he has gone as far as necessary for our purpose.\" Two hours later Jack returned with the news that the Maoris had gone straight on without making a stop. Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw were expected back at about ten o\u0027clock. They were to breakfast early at the Mitfords and to come up with their light canoe. They arrived, however, soon after eight o\u0027clock. \"Is all well?\" Mr. Renshaw shouted as he stepped from the boat. \"All well, father,\" Marion replied, running down to meet them. \"We had a little unpleasantness yesterday, but nothing of consequence. What brings you back so early? You must have started before daylight.\"[Pg 238] \"Bad news came in yesterday evening, and we should have come straight over if it had been possible, but Mr. Mitford would not let us leave till morning. We have been very anxious about you.\" \"What is the news?\" Wilfrid asked. \"The natives murdered two settlers at a farm some four miles from Mr. Mitford\u0027s. Yesterday he received letters both from Poverty Bay and Napier saying that the natives were in a very disturbed state, that Hau-Hau prophets had been going about among them, and that in both districts there had been several murders. Corps of volunteers are being raised at Napier, and they have sent to Wellington for a company of the constabulary. The settlers at Poverty Bay are also making preparations for defence. Mr. Mitford was asked to get all the colonists on this river to arm and prepare for an attack. Of course this news was very alarming in itself, and when two or three hours later the news came in of the murders in our own settlement we were naturally most anxious about you. However, as we could not come over in the dark through the forest, and as Mitford pointed out that the house was well prepared for defence, and that you would certainly be on the alert and had the dogs, who would give you notice of any body of men coming, we consented to remain if he would send us home in the canoe at five o\u0027clock in the morning. And now, what is it that happened here yesterday?\" \"It was nothing very alarming, father. Four natives came up and asked for food, which of course I gave them. Then they wanted gin, and seeing that I was alone tried to push their way into the house[Pg 239] I tried to stop them. The fellow snatched at his club. As he did so Marion appeared at the door with a levelled rifle, and the fellows, who had no guns with them, took to their heels. We gave the alarm-signal, and the Allens and Mr. Atherton came over at once, and the Grimstones ran in from their work. However, the natives had made their way off, and I do not suppose we shall hear any more of them.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Wilfrid,\" his father said. \"If it had been only this affair I should not have thought much about it. The natives are often rude and insolent, and these men might not have meant to do more than help themselves to a bottle of spirits, but taken with these accounts from Napier and Poverty Bay, and with the murders yesterday, I think it is very serious.\" \"Mr. Atherton and the Allens promised to come over at ten o\u0027clock, father, to chat the matter over with you, and hear whether you had brought news of any troubles elsewhere. So we shall have quite a council. And now let us have breakfast. We were just going to sit down when we heard your call, and I am sure you must be as hungry as hunters after your three hours on the water.\" Breakfast was scarcely finished when Mr. Atherton and the Allens arrived, and were made acquainted with the news of the murder of the two settlers on the previous day. \"It is clear,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"that the affair here yesterday was not, as I hoped, a mere incident, such as might happen anywhere if a party of ruffianly fellows arrived at a lonely house which they thought they could rob with impunity. This sad business you tell[Pg 240] us of shows that there is a general movement among the natives, the result, I suppose, of the arrival of some emissary from the Hau-Haus. It is an awkward business. What is Mr. Mitford\u0027s opinion on the subject?\" \"He thinks it will be well that all settlers on the river capable of bearing arms should be enrolled as a volunteer corps, and be in readiness to turn out at a moment\u0027s notice. He is of opinion that all those whose farms lie at a distance from the main body should drive in their animals and bring in such goods as they can carry to his station, as one of the most central. Huts could be got up there, and the animals all kept at night in his large stockaded yard. In case the natives seem inclined to make a regular attack the women and children could be sent down the river in boats or put on board a ship and sent to Napier. Fortunately, there is seldom a week without a craft of some sort putting into the river.\" \"There is no doubt that this would be the safest plan,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"but it would be a serious thing for the settlers to abandon their crops and houses to the natives unless it was certain that the danger was very great.\" \"That is my opinion,\" Mr. Renshaw said. \"I am certainly not disposed to have the results of our labour destroyed without a struggle.\" Wilfrid looked alike surprised and pleased. \"I am glad to hear you say so, father. It would be an awful nuisance and loss to have all our crops destroyed and our house burnt down, and to have to begin the whole thing over again. I don\u0027t see what would have been the use of getting everything ready for defence if we[Pg 241] are all to run away directly there is danger; but I think it would be a good thing to send the animals down to Mr. Mitford\u0027s, as he is good enough to offer to take them. We might send down the three natives to look after them, as of course they will have to go out to graze in the daytime, and keep Jack here. I do not know about the other men, and one doesn\u0027t seem able to trust the natives in the slightest; but I feel sure of Jack, and he would be useful to us in many ways in the house, besides being able to scout in the woods far better than we could do.\" \"I think that you are right, Mr. Renshaw,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"I should propose as an addition that the Allens here and I make this our head-quarters while the scare lasts. We could run up a light shanty with a few hours\u0027 work just behind the house. The Allens could go over to their work during the day and return here at night, and I should wander about the woods with my gun as usual. I do not think we need fear any attack in the daytime. If it comes at all it will be at night or at early morning. The natives will know from the men who were here that you are well armed, and will try to catch you napping. We won\u0027t be any more trouble to you than we can help, and with the addition of our three guns I think we could defend ourselves against any number of natives. What do you think of my proposal, lads?\" The Allens said at once that they thought it was an excellent one, if Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw were willing to have the trouble of them. \"It will be no trouble at all,\" Mrs. Renshaw said, \"and will be a very great comfort. With seven men to[Pg 242] protect us Marion and I shall feel perfectly safe, and it will be in all ways pleasant to have you here with us. I do not see that you need build a hut outside at all. There will be no difficulty in making up beds here and in the kitchen, and then we shall be all together.\" \"But I do not propose that you should cook for us, Mrs. Renshaw. If we had a hut of our own our boys could do that for us. You see, we are coming up here for our own defence as well as yours.\" \"I should not think of such a thing,\" Mrs. Renshaw said decidedly. \"There is no more trouble in cooking for nine than there is for six; and, as I have said, it will be a real pleasure to us to have you stopping here.\" \"Very well. Then in that case, Mrs. Renshaw, we will accept your invitation. I will bring over my belongings to-day and store them in your loft above, and the Allens had better bring over anything they do not want burnt by the natives. I still hope that these outrages are the work of a few ruffians, and that the natives in general will not allow themselves to be persuaded into hostilities against us; still, if the worst comes to the worst, I am convinced that we can hold this house against quite as strong a force as they are likely to bring to attack it. There is one precaution I should advise you to take at once, and that is to lay in a store of water. I daresay you have got some empty molasses and pork casks, that is if you do not burn them as soon as you empty them. If not we must set to work and make a strong wooden tank. In case we were really besieged, it would be fatal to us if we were caught without a supply of water.\"[Pg 243] Fortunately there were three or four empty casks. These were taken down to the river and thoroughly washed, filled with water and rolled up to the house. While this was being done, Wilfrid, with the Grimstones and the natives, had gone out and driven in all the animals from the clearings, and as soon as they were brought in Wilfrid with the natives started to drive them to Mr. Mitford\u0027s. Mr. Atherton went over to his hut, and before night his two natives had brought over all his most valuable property, and the next day his hut was completely stripped. The Allens only brought over a few things. Their furniture was rough and heavy, and they contented themselves by carrying it out into the forest near and hiding it in the undergrowth. Wilfrid returned to The Glade in the evening. He said that many of the settlers had come in, and were erecting shelters of hides, canvas, and wood near Mr. Mitford\u0027s house. The men were all being enrolled. Officers had been appointed, and the natives were likely to meet with a stout resistance if they ventured on hostilities. Mrs. Mitford had sent an earnest invitation to Mrs. Renshaw and Marion to take up their abode with her. Mr. Mitford had approved of their intention of holding the house. He knew its capabilities of defence and thought that, unless taken by surprise, they would be able to hold it. \"It will be a sort of outpost for the colony,\" he said, \"and will add to our safety; for if any strong body of natives were approaching they would probably attack you before coming on here. The instant we hear that you are attacked we will come up to aid you. We[Pg 244] shall be able to muster in all something like fifty mounted men—a strength sufficient to meet any number of natives likely to assemble in these parts.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3165/86850.html","bookId":869,"book":{"id":869,"title":"Maori and Settler","description":"简介： WELL, mother, one thing is certainsomething has got to be done.
