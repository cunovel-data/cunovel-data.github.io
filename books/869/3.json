{"id":18667,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE EMBARKATION.","content":"The Flying Scud was to sail in ten days; and this was ample time for their preparations, for Mrs. Renshaw wisely decided that it was better to buy all that was requisite for starting their new life, in New Zealand. \"We have none of us the least idea what will be required,\" she said. \"It will be far better to pay[Pg 31] somewhat higher prices for what we really do want out there than to cumber ourselves with all sorts of things that may be useless to us. We have already a considerable amount of baggage. There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father\u0027s two double-barrelled guns, which, by the way, I do not think he has ever used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap second-hand, and four revolvers. \"I do not for a moment suppose we shall ever want to use them, but as we may be often left in the house alone I think it would be pleasant to know that we are not altogether defenceless. We had better lay in a good stock of ammunition for all these weapons. Besides the clothes we have we had better get serge dresses and suits for the voyage, and a few strong servicable gowns and suits for rough work out there. Beyond this I do not think that we need spend a penny. We can certainly get everything we shall want for our new life at Wellington, which is a large place.\" On the morning of the day on which they were to embark the Grimstones came up from Reading. All the heavy luggage had been sent on board ship on the previous day, and at twelve o\u0027clock two cabs drove up to the side of the Flying Scud in St. Catherine\u0027s Docks. The one contained Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw, Marion, and a vast quantity of small packets inside. Wilfrid was on the box with the driver, and the roof was piled high with luggage. The other cab contained the two Grimstones and the rest of the luggage. The Renshaws were[Pg 32] already acquainted with the ship in which they were to sail, having paid her a visit four days previously to see their cabins. The parents had a comfortable cabin to themselves. Marion was berthed in a cabin with two other ladies, who, she learned, were sisters, the elder about her own age, and Wilfrid found he would have but one fellow-passenger. The Grimstones were in the steerage forward. The vessel was in a state of bustle, and what to the travellers seemed confusion. Numbers of other passengers were arriving, and the deck was littered with, their luggage until it could be sorted and sent down to their cabins; late cargo was being swung on board and lowered into the hold. On the deck aft were gathered the cabin passengers, with relatives and friends who had come to see them off. An hour later the bell rang as a signal for all visitors to go ashore. There were sad partings both fore and aft as the bell clanged out its impatient signal. \"I am very glad, mother, that we have no friends to say good-bye to us here, and that we got that all over at Reading.\" \"So am I, Wil. I think it much better myself that these partings should be got through before people leave home. It is natural of course that relatives and friends should like to see the last of each other, but I think it is a cruel kindness, and am glad, as you say, that we had no dear friends in London. Those at home have already shown their thoughtfulness and friendship.\" For indeed during the last few days hampers of presents of all kinds had arrived in a steady flow at Eastbourne Terrace. There had been[Pg 33] great feeling of commiseration among all their acquaintances at the misfortune that had befallen the Renshaws; and the manner in which they had at once surrendered everything for the benefit of the shareholders of the bank, and the calmness with which they had borne their reverses, had excited admiration, and scarce a friend or acquaintance but sent substantial tokens of their good-will or sympathy. As soon as it was publicly known that the Renshaws were about to sail for New Zealand, the boys and masters of the grammar-school between them subscribed and sent a handsome double-barrelled gun, a fishing-rod, and all appurtenances, to Wilfrid. Mr. Renshaw received two guns, several fishing-rods, two crates of crockery, and several cases of portable furniture of various kinds, besides many small articles. Mrs. Renshaw was presented with a stove of the best construction and a crate full of utensils of every kind, while Marion had work-boxes and desks sufficient to stock a school, two sets of garden tools, and innumerable nick-nacks likely to be more or less useful to her in her new life. Besides these there were several boxes of books of standard literature. \"Every one is very kind,\" Mrs. Renshaw said as the crates and hampers arrived; \"but if it goes on like this we shall have to charter a ship to ourselves, and how we are to move about there when we get out with all these things I have not the least idea.\" At last the good-byes were all finished, the visitors had left the ship, the hawsers were thrown off, and the vessel began to move slowly towards the dock gates. As soon as she had issued through these she was seized by[Pg 34] a tug, and proceeded in tow down the crowded river. There was a last waving of handkerchiefs and hats to the group of people standing at the entrance to the docks, and then the passengers began to look round and examine each other and the ship. Sailors were hard at workâ€”the last bales and boxes were being lowered into the hold, ropes were being coiled up, and tidiness restored to the deck. Parties of seamen were aloft loosening some of the sails, for the wind was favourable, and the captain had ordered some of the canvas to be set to assist the tug. \"Now, Marion,\" Mrs. Renshaw said, \"we had better go below and tidy up things a bit. Wil, you may as well come down and help me get the trunks stowed away under the berths, and put some hooks in for the brush-bags and other things we have brought; the hooks and gimlet are in my hand-bag.\" Wilfrid assisted to set his mother\u0027s cabin in order, and then went to his own. It was a good-sized cabin, and when the ship was full accommodated four passengers; but the two upper bunks had now been taken down, and there was, Wilfrid thought, ample room for two. On his own bunk were piled his two portmanteaus, a gun-case, a bundle of fishing-rods, and other odds and ends, and a somewhat similar collection of luggage was on that opposite. Wilfred read the name on the labels. \"Atherton,\" he said; \"I wonder what he is like. I do hope he will be a nice fellow.\" Scarcely had the thought passed through his mind when a figure appeared at the cabin door. It was that of a tall stout man, with immensely broad shoulders. His age Wilfrid guessed to be about thirty-five. He[Pg 35] had a pleasant face, and there was a humorous twinkle in his eye as the lad looked round in astonishment at the figure completely blocking up the doorway. \"So you are Renshaw?\" the big man said. \"I congratulate myself and you that your dimensions are not of the largest. My name is Atherton, as I daresay you have seen on my luggage. Suppose we shake hands, Renshaw? It is just as well to make friends at once, as we have got to put up with each other for the next five or six months. Of course you are a little appalled at my size,\" he went on, as he shook hands with the lad. \"Most people are at first, but nobody is so much appalled as I am myself. Still it has its amusing side, you know. I don\u0027t often get into an omnibus, because I do not think it is fair; but if I am driven to do so, and there happen to be five people on each side, the expression of alarm on those ten faces when I appear at the door is a picture, because it is manifestly impossible that they can make room for me on either side.\" \"What do you do, sir?\" Wilfrid asked laughing. \"I ask one of them to change sides. That leaves two places vacant, and as I make a point of paying for two, we get on comfortably enough. It is fortunate there are only two of us in this cabin. If I have the bad luck to travel in a full ship I always wait until the others are in bed before I turn in, and get up in the morning before they are astir; but I think you and I can manage pretty comfortably.\" \"Then you have travelled a good deal, sir?\" Wilfrid said. \"I am always travelling,\" the other replied. \"I am[Pg 36] like the fidgetty Phil of the story-book, who could never keep still. Most men of my size are content to take life quietly, but that is not so with me. For the last twelve or thirteen years I have been always on the move, and I ought to be worn down to a thread paper; but unfortunately, as you see, that is not the effect of travel in my case. I suppose you are going out to settle?\" \"Yes, sir. I have my father, mother, and sister on board.\" \"Lucky fellow!\" Mr. Atherton said; \"I have no relations worth speaking of.\" \"Are you going to settle at last, sir?\" Wilfrid asked. \"No, I am going out to botanize. I have a mania for botany, and New Zealand, you know, is in that respect one of the most remarkable regions in the world, and it has not yet been explored with anything approaching accuracy. It is a grand field for discovery, and there are special points of interest connected with it, as it forms a sort of connecting link between the floras of Australia, Asia, and South America, and has a flora of its own entirely distinct from any of these. Now let me advise you as to the stowing away of your traps. There is a good deal of knack in these things. Have you got your portmanteaus packed so that one contains all the things you are likely to require for say the first month of your voyage, and the other as a reserve to be drawn on occasionally? because, if not, I should advise you to take all the things out and to arrange them in that way. It will take you a little time, perhaps, but will save an immense amount of trouble throughout the voyage.\"[Pg 37] Wilfrid had packed his trunks with things as they came to hand, but he saw the advantage of following his fellow-passenger\u0027s advice, and accordingly opened his portmanteaus and piled the whole of their contents upon his berth. He then repacked them, Mr. Atherton sitting down on his berth and giving his advice as to the trunk in which each article should be placed. The work of rearrangement occupied half-an-hour, and Wilfrid often congratulated himself during the voyage upon the time so spent. When all was complete and the cabin arranged tidily, Wilfrid looked in at the next cabin. This was occupied by two young men of the name of Allen. They were friends of an acquaintance of Mr. Renshaw, who, hearing that they were journeying by the same ship to New Zealand, had brought them down to Eastbourne Terrace and introduced them to Mr. Renshaw and his family. The two were occupied in arranging their things in the cabin. \"Well, Renshaw,\" James, the elder of them, said when he entered, \"I am afraid I cannot congratulate you on your fellow-passenger. We saw him go into your cabin. He is a tremendous man. He would be magnificent if he were not so stout. Why, you will scarce find room to move!\" \"He is a capital fellow,\" Wilfrid said. \"I think we shall get on splendidly together. He is full of fun, and makes all sorts of jokes about his own size. He has travelled a tremendous lot, and is up to everything. He is nothing like so old as you would think, if you have not seen his face. I do not think he is above thirty-five or so. Well, as I see you have just finished, I will go up and see how we are getting on.\"[Pg 38] When Wilfrid reached the deck he found the vessel was off Erith, and was greeted by his sister. \"You silly boy, you have been missing the sight of all the shipping, and of Greenwich Hospital. The idea of stopping below all this time. I should have come to call you up if I had known which was your room.\" \"Cabin, you goose!\" Wilfrid said; \"the idea of talking of rooms on board a ship. I would have come up if I had thought of it; but I was so busy putting things to right and making the acquaintance of the gentleman in the cabin with me that I forgot altogether we were moving down the river.\" \"Which is he, Wilfrid?\" Wilfrid laughed and nodded in the direction of Mr. Atherton, who was standing with his back towards them a short distance away. Marion\u0027s eyes opened wide. \"Oh, Wil, what a big man! He must quite fill up the cabin.\" \"He seems an awfully good fellow, Marion.\" \"I daresay he may be, Wil; but he will certainly take up more than his share of the cabin.\" \"It is awkward, isn\u0027t it, young lady?\" Mr. Atherton said, suddenly turning round on his heel, to Marion\u0027s horror, while Wilfrid flushed scarlet, for he had not the least idea that his words could be heard. \"I have capital hearing, you see,\" Mr. Atherton went on with a laugh, \"and a very useful sense it is sometimes, and has stood me in good service upon many occasions, though I own that it effectually prevents my cherishing any illusion as to my personal appearance. This is your sister, of course, Renshaw; in fact, anyone could[Pg 39] see that at a glance. There is nothing like making acquaintances early on the voyage; the first day is in that respect the most important of all.\" \"Why is that?\" Marion asked. \"Because as a rule the order in which people sit down to table on the first day of the voyage is that in which they sit the whole time. Now, if one happens to sit one\u0027s self down by people who turn out disagreeable it is a very great nuisance, and therefore it is very important to find out a little about one\u0027s fellow-passengers the first day, so as to take a seat next to someone whom you are not likely to quarrel with before you have been a week at sea.\" \"Then they do not arrange places for you, Mr. Atherton?\" \"Oh no; the captain perhaps settles as to who are to sit up by him. If there is anyone of special importance, a governor or vice-governor or any other big-wig, he and his wife, if he has got one, will probably sit next to the captain on one side, if not, he will choose someone who has been specially introduced to him or who has sailed with him before, and the steward, before the party sit down, puts their names on their plates; everyone else shifts for themselves. Renshaw, I shall be glad if you will introduce me to your father and mother, and if we get on well I will go down below and arrange that we get places together. I have been chatting with the first officer, who is a very pleasant fellow; I have sailed with him before. The rule is he sits at the end of the table facing the captain, and my experience is that when the first officer happens to be a good fellow, which is not always the case,[Pg 40] his end of the table is the most pleasant place. There is generally more fun and laughing at that end than there is at the other; for all the people who fancy that they are of importance make a point of getting seats as near as they can to the captain, and important people are not, as a rule, anything like as pleasant as the rest of us.\" Wilfrid walked across the deck with Mr. Atherton to the point where his father and mother were sitting. \"Mother, this is Mr. Atherton, who is in my cabin.\" Mr. Atherton shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw. \"I asked your son to introduce me at once, Mrs. Renshaw, because, as I have been telling him, a good deal of the comfort of the voyage depends upon making a snug little party to sit together at meals. There is nothing I dread more than being put down between two acidulated women, who make a point of showing by their manner every time one sits down that they consider one is taking up a great deal more than one\u0027s share of the seat.\" Mrs. Renshaw smiled. \"I should think people were not often as rude as that.\" \"I can assure you that it is the rule rather than the exception, Mrs. Renshaw. I am not a particularly sensitive man, I think; but I make a point of avoiding crowded railway-carriages, being unable to withstand the expression of blank dismay that comes over the faces of people when I present myself at the door. I have thought sometimes of hiring a little boy of about four years old to go about with me, as the two of us would then only take up a fair share of space. I have been looking to the cabin arrangements, and find[Pg 41] that each seat holds three. Your son and daughter are neither of them bulky, so if they won\u0027t mind sitting a little close they will be conferring a genuine kindness upon me.\" \"We shall not mind at all,\" Wilfrid and Marion exclaimed together, for there was something so pleasant about Mr. Atherton\u0027s manner they felt that he would be a delightful companion. \"Very well, then; we will regard that as settled. Then we five will occupy the seats on one side of the chief officer.\" \"We will get the two Allens opposite,\" Wilfrid put in.\" \"I will look about for three others to make up what I may call our party. Who do you fancy, Mrs. Renshaw? Now look round and fix on somebody, and I will undertake the duty of engineering the business.\" \"There are two girls, sisters, in my cabin,\" Marion said. \"I think they seem nice. They are going out alone to join their father and mother in New Zealand.\" \"In that case, Mrs. Renshaw, I had better leave the matter in your hands.\" \"That will be very simple, Mr. Atherton, as I have already spoken to them,\" and she at once got up and moved across to two girls of about thirteen and seventeen respectively, who were standing together watching the passing ships, and entered into conversation with them. When she proposed that, as they were in the same cabin with Marion, they should sit near each other at table, they gladly agreed, saying, however, that they had been placed under the special care of the captain, and as he had said that he would keep[Pg 42] them under his eye, they were afraid he might want them to sit near him. \"I will speak to the captain myself,\" Mrs. Renshaw said. \"I daresay he will be rather glad to have the responsibility taken off his hands, especially if I propose, which I will if you like, to take you under my general charge.\" \"Oh, we should like that very much,\" the elder of the two girls said. \"It seems so very strange to us being here among so many people without any lady with us. We should be so much obliged to you if you would take us under your wing.\" \"I can quite understand your feelings, my dears, and will speak to the captain directly. I see that he is disengaged. If we were under sail there would not be much chance of getting a word with him; but as the tug has us in charge, I see that he has time to chat to the passengers.\" A few minutes later the captain left the gentleman with whom he was speaking and came along the deck. The Renshaws had made his acquaintance when they first came down to see their cabins. \"How are you, Mrs. Renshaw?\" he said as he came up to her. \"We have fine weather for our start, have we not? It is a great thing starting fair, as it enables people to settle down and make themselves at home.\" \"I have been chatting with the Miss Mitfords, captain; they are in the cabin with my daughter. They tell me that they are under your special charge.\" \"Yes, they are among the number of my responsibilities,\" the captain said smiling.[Pg 43] \"They naturally feel rather lonely on board from having no lady with them, and have expressed their willingness to put themselves under my charge if you will sanction it. It will be pleasant both for them and my daughter, and they can sit down with us at meals, and make a party together to work or read on deck.\" \"I shall be extremely glad, Mrs. Renshaw, if you will accept the responsibility. A captain\u0027s hands are full enough without having to look after women. There are four or five single ladies on board, on all of whom I have promised to keep a watchful eye, and I shall be delighted to be relieved of the responsibility of two of them.\" So the matter was arranged, and going down into the cabin a few minutes before the bell rang for dinner, the party succeeded in getting the places they desired. Mr. Atherton was next to the chief officer. Wilfrid sat next to him, Marion between her brother and Mrs. Renshaw, and Mr. Renshaw next. The two Allens faced Mr. Atherton and Wilfrid; the Miss Mitfords came next, facing Marion and her mother. A Captain Pearson and his wife were next to the Mitfords, while a civil engineer, Mr. Halbrook, occupied the vacant seat next to Mr. Renshaw. Once seated, the Renshaws speedily congratulated themselves on the arrangements that they had made as they saw the hesitating way in which the rest of the passengers took their places, and the looks of inquiry and doubt they cast at those who seated themselves next to them. For a time the meal was a silent one, friends talking together in low voices, but nothing like a general conversation being at[Pg 44]tempted. At the first officers\u0027 end of the table, however, the sound of conversation and laughter began at once. \"Have you room, Miss Renshaw? or do you already begin to regret your bargain?\" \"I have plenty of room, thank you,\" Marion replied. \"I hope that you have enough?\" \"Plenty,\" Mr. Atherton answered. \"I have just been telling your brother that if he finds I am squeezing him he must run his elbow into my ribs. Let me see, Mr. Ryan; it must be three years since we sat together.\" \"Just about that,\" the mate replied with a strong Irish accent. \"You went with us from Japan to Singapore, did you not?\" \"That was it, and a rough bout we had of it in that cyclone in the China Seas. You remember that I saved the ship then?\" \"How was that, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked. The first officer laughed. \"Mr. Atherton always took a deal more credit to himself than we gave him. When the cyclone struck the ship and knocked her right down on her beam-ends, he happened to be sitting up to windward, and he always declared that if it hadn\u0027t been for his weight the ship would never have righted itself.\" There was a general laugh at the mate\u0027s explanation. \"I always plant myself to windward in a gale,\" Mr. Atherton said gravely. \"Shifting ballast is a most useful thing, although they have abolished it in yacht-racing. I was once in a canoe, down by Borneo, when a heavy squall struck us. I was sitting in the bottom[Pg 45] of the boat when we saw it coming, and had just time to get up and sit on the weather gunwale when it struck us. If it had not been for me nothing could have saved the boat from capsizing. As it was it stood up as stiff as a rock, though, I own, I nearly drowned them all when the blow was over, for it stopped as suddenly as it began, and the boat as nearly as possible capsized with my weight. Indeed it would have done so altogether if it hadn\u0027t heeled over so sharply that I was chucked backwards into the sea. Fortunately the helmsman made a grab at me as I went past, and I managed to scramble on board again. Not that I should have sunk for I can float like a cork; but there are a good many sharks cruising about in those waters, and it is safer inside a boat than it is out. You see, Miss Renshaw, there are advantages in being stout. I should not wonder if your brother got just my size one day. My figure was very much like his once.\" \"Oh, I hope not!\" Marion exclaimed. \"That would be dreadful! No; I don\u0027t mean that,\" she went on hurriedly as Mr. Atherton\u0027s face assumed an expression of shocked surprise. \"I mean that, although of course there may be many advantages in being stout, there are advantages in being thin too.\" \"I admit that,\" Mr. Atherton agreed; \"but look at the disadvantages. A stout man escapes being sent trotted about on messages. Nobody would think of asking him to climb a ladder. He is not expected to dance. The thin man is squeezed into any odd corner; and is not treated with half the consideration that is given to a fat man. He worries about trifles, and has[Pg 46] none of the quiet contentment that characterizes stout people. A stout man\u0027s food always agrees with him, or else he would not be stout; while the thin man suffers indigestion, dyspepsia, and perhaps jaundice. You see, my dear young lady, that almost all the advantages are on our side. Of course you will say I could not climb a ladder, but then I do not want to climb a ladder. I could not make the ascent of Matterhorn; but it is much more pleasant to sit at the bottom and see fools do it. I could not very well ride a horse unless it were a dray-horse; but then I have no partiality for horse exercise. Altogether I think I have every reason to be content. I can travel wherever I like, see whatever I want to see, and enjoy most of the good things of life.\" \"And hould your own in a scrimmage,\" Mr. Ryan put in laughing. \"I can answer for that.\" \"If I am pushed to it,\" Mr. Atherton said modestly, \"of course I try to do my best.\" \"Have you seen Mr. Atherton in a scrimmage?\" Tom Allen asked the mate. \"I have; and a sharp one it was while it lasted.\" \"There is no occasion to say anything about it, Ryan,\" Mr. Atherton said hastily. \"But no reason in life why I should not,\" the mate replied. \"What do you say, ladies and gentleman?\" There was a chorus of \"Go on please, do let us hear about it,\" and he continued: \"I don\u0027t give Mr. Atherton the credit of saving our ship in the squall, but it would have gone badly with us if he hadn\u0027t taken part in the row we had. You see, we had a mixed crew on board, for the most part[Pg 47] Chinamen and a few Lascars; for we were three years in the China Seas, and English sailors cannot well stand the heat out there, and besides don\u0027t like remaining in ships stopping there trading. So when, after we arrived at Shanghai, we got orders to stop and trade out there, most of them took their discharge, and we filled up with natives. Coming down from Japan that voyage there was a row. I forget what their pretext was now, but I have no doubt it was an arranged thing, and that they intended to take the ship and run her ashore on some of the islands, take what they fancied out of her, and make off in boats, or perhaps take her into one of those nests of pirates that abound among the islands. \"They felt so certain of overpowering us, for there were only the three officers, the boatswain, and two cabin passengers, that instead of rising by night, when they would no doubt have succeeded, they broke into mutiny at dinner-timeâ€”came aft in a body, clamouring that their food was unfit to eat. Then suddenly drawing weapons from beneath their clothes they rushed up the gangways on to the poop; and as none of us were armed, and had no idea of what was going to take place, they would have cut us down almost without resistance had it not been for our friend here. He was standing just at the top of the poop ladder when they came up, headed by their seraing. Mr. Atherton knocked the scoundrel down with a blow of his fist, and then, catching him by the ankles, whirled him round his head like a club and knocked the fellows down like ninepins as they swarmed up the gangway, armed with knives and creases.[Pg 48] \"The captain, who was down below, had slammed and fastened the door opening on to the waist on seeing the fellows coming aft, and handed up to us through the skylight some loaded muskets, and managed, by standing on the table and taking our hands, to get up himself. Then we opened fire upon them, and in a very few minutes drove them down. We shot six of them. The seraing of course was killed, four of the others had their skulls fairly broken in by the blows that they had received, and five were knocked senseless. We chucked them down the hatchway to the others, had up four or five of the men to work the ship, and kept the rest fastened below until we got to Singapore and handed them over to the authorities. They all got long terms of penal servitude. Anyhow, Mr. Atherton saved our lives and the ship, so I think you will agree with me that he can hold his own in a scrimmage.\" \"It was very hot work,\" Mr. Atherton said with a laugh, \"and I did not get cool again for two or three days afterwards. The idea of using a man as a club was not my own. Belzoni put down a riot among his Arab labourers, when he was excavating ruins somewhere out in Syria, I think it was, by knocking the ringleader down and using him as a club. I had been reading the book not long before, and it flashed across my mind as the seraing went down that he might be utilized. Fists are all very well, but when you have got fellows to deal with armed with knives and other cutting instruments it is better to keep them at a distance if you can.\" \"That was splendid!\" Wilfrid exclaimed. \"How I should like to have seen it!\"[Pg 49] \"It was good for the eyes,\" the mate said; \"and bate Donnybrook entirely. Such a yelling and shouting as the yellow reptiles made you never heard.\" By this time the meal was finished, and the passengers repaired on deck to find that the ship was just passing Sheerness. \"Who would have thought,\" Wilfrid said to his sister as he looked at Mr. Atherton, who had taken his seat in a great Indian reclining chair he had brought for his own use, and was placidly smoking a cigar, \"that that easy, placid, pleasant-looking man could be capable of such a thing as that! Shouldn\u0027t I like to have been there!\" \"So should I,\" Marion agreed; \"though it must have been terrible to look at. He doesn\u0027t look as if anything would put him out. I expect Samson was something like him, only not so stout. He seems to have been very good-tempered except when people wanted to capture him; and was always ready to forgive that horrid woman who tried to betray him to his enemies. Well, everything is very niceâ€”much nicer than I expectedâ€”and I feel sure that we shall enjoy the voyage very much.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3165/86840.html","bookId":869,"book":{"id":869,"title":"Maori and Settler","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š WELL, mother, one thing is certainsomething has got to be done.
