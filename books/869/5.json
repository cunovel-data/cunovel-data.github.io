{"id":18669,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV. A ROW ON SHORE.","content":"While Wilfrid and the Allens were talking they were walking briskly in the direction of their landing-place. They had arrived within a hundred yards of it, when a party of four men who were lying among a pile of timber got up and came across towards them. They were rough-looking fellows, and James Allen said, \"I do not like the look of these chaps. I think they mean mischief. Look out!\" As he spoke the men rushed at them. James Allen gave a loud shout for help and then struck a blow at a man who rushed at him. The fellow staggered backwards, and with a fierce exclamation in Portuguese drew a knife. A moment later Allen received a sharp stab on the shoulder, and was knocked to the ground. The other two after a short struggle had also been overpowered and[Pg 65] borne down, but in their case the robbers had not used their knives. They were feeling in their pockets when the step of a man approaching at full speed was heard. One of the robbers was about to run off, when another exclaimed: \"You coward! It is but one man, which means more booty. Out with your knives and give him a taste of them as he comes up!\" A moment later the man ran up. The leader stepped forward to meet him, knife in hand; but as he struck his wrist was grasped, and a tremendous blow was delivered in his face, hurling him stunned and bleeding to the ground. With a bound the new-comer threw himself upon two of the other men. Grasping them by their throats he shook them as if they had been children, and then dashed their heads together with such tremendous force that when he loosened his grasp both fell insensible on the ground. The other robber took to his heels at the top of his speed. All this had passed so quickly that the struggle was over before Wilfrid and the Allens could get to their feet. \"Not hurt, I hope?\" their rescuer asked anxiously. \"Why, Mr. Atherton, is it you?\" Wilfrid exclaimed. \"You arrived at a lucky moment indeed. No, I am not hurt that I know of, beyond a shake.\" \"Nor I,\" Bob Allen said. \"I have got a stab in my shoulder,\" James Allen answered. \"I don\u0027t know that it is very deep, but I think it is bleeding a good deal, for I feel very shaky. That fellow has got my watch,\" and he pointed to the man who had been first knocked down. \"Look in his hand, Wilfrid. He won\u0027t have had[Pg 66] time to put it in his pocket. If you have lost anything else look in the other fellows\u0027 hands or on the ground close to them.\" He lifted James Allen, who was now scarcely able to stand, carried him to the wood pile, and seated him on a log with his back against another. Then he took off his coat and waistcoat, and tore open his shirt. \"It is nothing serious,\" he said. \"It is a nasty gash and is bleeding freely, but I daresay we can stop that; I have bandaged up plenty of worse wounds in my time.\" He drew the edge of the wound together, and tied his handkerchief and that of Wilfrid tightly round it. \"That will do for the present,\" he said. \"Now I will carry you down to the boat,\" and lifting the young fellow up as though he were a feather he started with him. \"Shall we do anything with these fellows, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked. \"No, leave them as they are; what they deserve is to be thrown into the sea. I daresay their friend will come back to look after them presently.\" In a couple of minutes they arrived at the landing-place, where two men were sitting in a boat. \"But how did you come to be here, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked when they had taken their seats. \"I came to look after you boys, Wilfrid. I got on board about eleven, and on going down to the cabin found you had not returned, so I thought I would smoke another cigar and wait up for you. At twelve o\u0027clock the last party returned, and as I thought you might have some difficulty in getting on board after that, I got into the boat and rowed ashore, and engaged the men[Pg 67] to wait as long as I wanted them. I thought perhaps you had missed your way, and did not feel uneasy about you, for there being three of you together it was scarcely likely you had got into any bad scrape. I was beginning at last to think you had perhaps gone to an hotel for the night, and that it was no use waiting any longer, when I heard your voices coming along the quays. The night is so quiet that I heard your laugh some distance away, and recognized it. I then strolled along to meet you, when I saw those four fellows come out into the moonlight from a shadow in the wood. I guessed that they were up to mischief, and started to run at once, and was within fifty yards of you when I saw the scuffle and caught the glint of the moon on the blade of a knife. Another five or six seconds I was up, and then there was an end of it. Now we are close to the ship. Go up as quietly as you can, and do not make a noise as you go into your cabins. It is no use alarming people. I will carry Jim down.\" \"I can walk now, I think, Mr. Atherton.\" \"You might do, but you won\u0027t, my lad; for if you did you would probably start your wound bleeding afresh. You two had best take your shoes off directly you get on deck.\" James Allen was carried down and laid on his berth. Mr. Atherton went and roused the ship\u0027s doctor, and then lighted the lamp in the cabin. \"What is all this about?\" the surgeon asked as he came in. \"There has been a bit of a scrimmage on shore,\" Mr. Atherton replied; \"and, as you see, Allen has got a deepish slash from the shoulder down to the elbow. It[Pg 68] has been bleeding very freely, and he is faint from loss of blood; but I do not think it is serious at all.\" \"No, it is a deep flesh wound,\" the doctor said, examining him; \"but there is nothing to be in the slightest degree uneasy about. I will get a bandage from my cabin, and some lint, and set it all right in five minutes.\" When the arm was bandaged, Mr. Atherton said: \"Now I must get you to do a little plastering for me doctor.\" \"What! are you wounded, Mr. Atherton?\" the others exclaimed in surprise. \"Nothing to speak of, lads; but both those fellows made a slash at me as I closed with them. I had but just finished their leader and could do no more than strike wildly as I turned upon them.\" As he spoke he was taking off his waistcoat and shirt. \"By Jove, you have had a narrow escape!\" the doctor said; \"and how you take it so coolly I cannot make out. Except as to the bleeding, they are both far more serious than Allen\u0027s.\" One of the wounds was in the left side, about three inches below the arm. The man had evidently struck at the heart, but the quickness with which Mr. Atherton had closed with him had disconcerted his aim; the knife had struck rather far back, and glancing behind the ribs had cut a deep gash under the shoulder-blade. The other wound had been given by a downright blow at the right side, and had laid open the flesh from below the breast down to the hip. \"It is only a case for plaster,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"It is useful to have a casing of fat sometimes. It is[Pg 69] the same thing with a whaleâ€”you have got to drive a harpoon in very deep to get at the vitals. You see this wound in front has bled very little.\" \"You have lost a good deal of blood from the other cut,\" the surgeon said. \"I will draw the edges of the wounds together with a needle and thread, and will then put some bandages on. You will have to keep quiet for some days. Your wounds are much too serious to think of putting plaster on at present.\" \"I have had a good deal more serious wounds than these,\" Mr. Atherton said cheerfully, \"and have had to ride seventy or eighty miles on the following day. However I will promise you not to go ashore to-morrow; and as the captain says he expects to be off the next morning, I shall be able to submit myself to your orders without any great privation.\" \"Why did you not say that you were wounded, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid said reproachfully as they went to their own cabin and prepared to turn in. \"To tell you the truth, Wilfrid, I hardly thought the wounds were as deep as they are. My blood was up, you see, and when that is the case you are scarcely conscious of pain. I felt a sharp shooting sensation on both sides as I grasped those fellows by the throat, and afterwards I knew I was bleeding a bit at the back, for I felt the warmth of the blood down in my shoe; but there was nothing to prevent my carrying young Allen, and one person can carry a wounded man with much more ease to him than two can do, unless of course they have got a stretcher.\" The next morning there was quite a stir in the ship when it was known that two of the passengers were[Pg 70] wounded, and Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw were greatly alarmed when they heard of the risk Wilfrid had run. Neither of the wounded men appeared at breakfast, as the surgeon insisted that both should lie quiet for at least one day. Mr. Renshaw had paid a visit to Mr. Atherton directly he had heard from Wilfrid his story of the fray, and thanked him most warmly for his intervention on behalf of his son. \"Wilfrid said he has very little doubt that they all three would have been stabbed if you had not come up.\" \"I do not say they might not,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"because their resistance had raised the men\u0027s anger; and in this country when a man is angry he generally uses his knife. Besides, dead men raise no alarm. Still they might have contented themselves with robbing them. However, I own that it was lucky I was on the spot.\" \"But it was not a question of luck at all,\" Mr. Renshaw insisted. \"You were there because you had specially gone ashore to look after these foolish young fellows, and your being there was the result of your own thoughtfulness for them, and not in any way of chance.\" \"There is quite a crowd on the quay, Mr. Renshaw,\" the captain said when that gentleman went on deck, \"I suppose they have found stains of blood in the road and conclude that a crime has been committed. Oh, here is our boat putting out from the landing-place. The steward has been on shore to get fresh fruit for breakfast; he will tell us what is going on.\" The steward had gone ashore before the news of the encounter had been spread by the surgeon.[Pg 71] \"What is the excitement about on shore?\" the captain asked him as he stepped on deck. \"Well, sir, as far as I could learn from a chap who spoke a little English, there have been bad doings on shore in the night. Two men were found this morning lying dead there. There is nothing uncommon about that; but they say there are no wounds on them, except that their skulls are stove in, as if they had both been struck by a beam of wood at the back of the head. But besides that there were two or three pools of blood in the road. It seems one man walked back into the town, for there are marks of his feet as if he stepped in the blood before starting in that direction. Then there is a line of blood spots down to the landing-place and down the steps, as if somebody had got into a boat. Nobody seems to make head nor tail of the business.\" \"Well, we must keep this quiet if we can,\" the captain said, turning to Mr. Renshaw. \"If it were known that any of our people were concerned in this affair they might keep us here for three weeks or a month while it is being investigated, or insist upon Mr. Atherton and your son and the Allens remaining behind as witnesses. Mr. Ryan,\" he called to the first-mate, \"just come here a moment. This matter is more serious than we thought. It seems that Mr. Atherton, who, as we have heard, dashed the heads of two of these fellows together, killed them on the spot.\" \"Sure and I thought as much when young Allen was telling me about it,\" the mate said. \"I have seen Mr. Atherton at work before this, and I thought to myself that unless those fellows\u0027 skulls were made of[Pg 72] iron, and thick at that, they must have gone in when he brought them together.\" \"The worst of it is,\" the captain went on, \"they have traced marks of blood down to the landing-stage, and of course have suspicion that someone concerned in the affair took a boat, and either came off to one of the ships or went away in one of the fishing craft. You know what these fellows are; if they find out that anyone on board is mixed up in the matter, they will keep the ship here for a month.\" \"That is true enough, sir. It is mighty lucky we would be if we got away in a month.\" \"The first thing is to see about the boatmen,\" the captain said. \"Of course if they tell the authorities they brought a wounded man on board here late last night there is an end of it; but if they hold their tongues, and we all keep our own council, the thing may not leak out to-day, and we will have our anchor up and get out this evening if we can. You had better tell all the crew that not a word is to be said about the matter, and I will impress the same on the passengers. When they know that a careless word may lead to a month\u0027s detention, you may be sure there will be no talking. But before you speak to them I will go down and see Mr. Atherton, and hear what he says about the boatmen.\" He returned in two or three minutes. \"I hope it will be all right,\" he said. \"Atherton gave them a pound apiece, and told them to hold their tongues. He thinks it is probable they will do so, for they would know well enough that they would, as likely as not, be clapped into prison and kept there while the investigation was going on. So there is a strong hope[Pg 73] that it may not leak out through them. You must stop all leave ashore, Mr. Ryan. Tell the men whose turn it is to go, they shall have their spree at Buenos Ayres. If they were to get drunk it would be as likely as not to slip out.\" \"I will see to it, sir.\" Directly breakfast was over the captain took a boat and went ashore. He had duly impressed upon all the passengers the absolute necessity for silence, and several of these went ashore with him. He returned half an hour later, having been up to the British Consulate. \"The affair is making quite a stir in the town. Not on account of two men being found dead, there is nothing uncommon in that, especially as they have been recognized as two notorious ruffians; but the whole circumstances of the affair puzzle them. \"The doctors who have examined the bodies have arrived pretty well at the truth, and say that both men have been gripped by the throat, for the marks of the fingers are plainly visible, and their heads dashed together. But although this is, as we know, perfectly true, no one believes it; for the doctors themselves admit that it does not appear to them possible that any man would have had the strength requisite to completely batter in the skulls of two others, as has been done in this case. The police are searching the town for the man whose footsteps led in that direction, and as they know all the haunts of these ruffians and their associates it is likely enough that they will find him, especially as his face is sure to bear marks of Atherton\u0027s handiwork. Still, if they do find him, and he tells all he knows of the business,[Pg 74] they will not be much nearer to tracing the actors in it to this ship. It is not probable that he recovered his senses until long after they were on board the boat, and can only say that while engaged in attempting to rob some passers-by he was suddenly knocked down. But even this they are not likely to get out of him first, for he will know that he used a knife, and is not likely to put himself in the way of punishment if he can help it. I came off at once, because I heard at the Consulate that the police are going to search every ship in the harbour to see if they can find some wounded man, or get some clue to the mystery, so I must ask the doctor if his two patients are fit to be dressed and go up on deck.\" The doctor on being consulted said that he should certainly have preferred that they should have remained quiet all day, but he did not know that it would do them any harm to get on deck for a bit. And accordingly in half an hour Mr. Atherton and James Allen came up. The doctor, who had assisted them to dress, accompanied them. \"Now, Mr. Atherton, you had better seat yourself in that great deck-chair of yours with the leg-rest. If you sit there quietly reading when they come on board they are not likely to suspect you of being a desperate character, or to appreciate your inches and width of shoulder. Allen had better sit quiet till they get alongside, and then slip that sling into his pocket and walk up and down talking to one of the ladies, with his thumb in his waistcoat so as to support his arm. He looks pale and shaky; but they are not accustomed to much colour here, and he will pass well enough.\"[Pg 75] As soon as Mr. Atherton had taken his seat Mrs. Renshaw and Marion came up to him. \"How can we thank you enough, Mr. Atherton, for the risks you have run to succour Wilfrid, and for your kind consideration in going on shore to wait for him?\" \"It was nothing, Mrs. Renshaw. I own to enjoying a scrimmage when I can go into one with the feeling of being in the right. You know that I am a very lazy man, but it is just your lazy men who do enjoy exerting themselves occasionally.\" \"It was grand!\" Marion broke in; \"and you ought not to talk as if it was nothing, Mr. Atherton. Wilfrid said that he thought it was all over with him till he saw a big man flying down the road.\" \"A perfect colossus of Rhodes!\" Mr. Atherton laughed. \"It is not a thing to joke about,\" Marion went on earnestly. \"It may seem very little to you, Mr. Atherton, but it is everything to us.\" \"Don\u0027t you know that one always jokes when one is serious, Miss Renshaw? You know that in church any little thing that you would scarcely notice at any other time makes you inclined to laugh. Some day in the far distance, when you become a woman, you will know the truth of the saying, that smiles and tears are very close to each other.\" \"I am getting to be a woman now,\" Marion said with some dignity; for Mr. Atherton always persisted in treating her as if she were a child, which, as she was nearly seventeen, was a standing grievance to her. \"Age does not make a woman, Miss Renshaw. I saw you skipping three days ago with little Kate[Pg 76] Mitford and your brother and young Allen, and you enjoyed it as much as any of them.\" \"We were trying which could keep up the longest,\" Marion said; \"Wilfrid and I against the other two. You were looking on, and I believe you would have liked to have skipped too.\" \"I think I should,\" Mr. Atherton agreed. \"You young people do not skip half as well as we used to when I was a boy; and I should have given you a lesson if I had not been afraid of shaking the ship\u0027s timbers to pieces.\" \"How absurd you are, Mr. Atherton!\" Marion said pettishly. \"Of course you are not thin, but you always talk of yourself as if you were something monstrous.\" Mr. Atherton laughed. His diversion had had the desired effect, and had led them away from the subject of the fight on shore. \"There is a galley putting off from shore with a lot of officials on board,\" the captain said, coming up at this moment. \"They are rowing to the next ship, and I suppose they will visit us next.\" A quarter of an hour later the galley came alongside, and three officials mounted the gangway. The captain went forward to meet them. \"Is there anything I can do for you, gentlemen?\" \"There has been a crime committed on shore,\" the leader of the party said, \"and it is suspected that some of those concerned in the matter are on board one of the ships in the harbour. I have authority to make a strict search on board each.\" \"You are perfectly welcome to do so, sir,\" the cap[Pg 77]tain said. \"One of our officers will show you over the ship.\" \"I must trouble you to show me your list of passengers and crew, and to muster the men on deck. But first I must ask you, Did any of your boats return on board late?\" \"No,\" the captain replied. \"Our last boat was hauled up to the davits at half-past nine. There was a heavy day\u0027s work before the men to-day, and I therefore refused leave on shore.\" The men were ordered to be mustered, and while they were collecting the second-mate went round the ship with the officials, and they saw that no one was below in his berth. The men\u0027s names were called over from the list, and the officials satisfied that all were present and in good health. \"Now for the passengers,\" he said \"I cannot ask them to muster,\" the captain observed, \"but I will walk round with you and point out those on the list. There are some eight or ten on shore. They will doubtless be off to lunch; and if you leave an officer on board he will see that they are by no means the sort of people to take part in such an affair as that which has happened on shore.\" The officials went round the deck, but saw nothing whatever to excite their suspicion. Marion Renshaw was laughing and talking with Mr. Atherton, Miss Mitford walking up and down the poop in conversation with James Allen. After they had finished their investigations, the officials left one of their party to inspect the remaining passengers as they came on board, and to check them off the list. They then again[Pg 78] took their seats in the galley and were rowed to the next ship. By dint of great exertions the cargo was got out by sunset, the sails were at once loosened and the anchor weighed, and before the short twilight had faded away the Flying Scud was making her way with a gentle breeze towards the mouth of the harbour. \"We are well out of that,\" Mr. Atherton said as he looked back at the lights of the city. \"I think you are very well out of it indeed, in more senses than one,\" said the surgeon, who was standing next to him; \"but you have had a wonderfully close shave of it, Mr. Atherton. Another inch and either of those blows might have been fatal. Besides, had you been detained for a month or six weeks, it is as likely as not that, what with the heat and what with the annoyance, your wound would have taken a bad turn. Now, you must let me exercise my authority and order you to your berth immediately. You ought not to have been out of it. Of the two evils, getting up and detention, I chose the least; but I should be glad now if you would go off at once. If you do not, I can assure you I may have you on my hands all the rest of the voyage.\" \"I will obey orders, doctor. The more willingly because for the last hour or two my back has been smarting unmercifully. I do not feel the other wound much.\" \"That is because you have been sitting still. You will find it hurt you when you come to walk. Please go down carefully; a sudden movement might start your wounds again.\"[Pg 79] It was two or three days before Mr. Atherton again appeared on deck. His left arm was bandaged tightly to his body so as to prevent any movement of the shoulder-blade, and he walked stiffly to the deck-chair, which had been piled with cushions in readiness. \"I am glad to be out again, Mrs. Renshaw,\" Mr. Atherton said as she arranged the cushions to suit him. \"Your husband, with Wilfrid and the two Allens, have kept me company, one or other of them, all the time, so I cannot say I have been dull. But it was much hotter below than it is here. However, I know the doctor was right in keeping me below, for the slightest movement gave me a great deal of pain. However, the wounds are going on nicely, and I hope by the time we get to Buenos Ayres I shall be fit for a trip on shore again.\" \"I hardly think so, Mr. Atherton; for if the weather continues as it is nowâ€”it is a nice steady breeze, and we have been running ever since we left Rioâ€”I think we shall be there long before you are fit to go ashore.\" \"I do not particularly care about it,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"Buenos Ayres is not like Rio, but is for the most part quite a modern town, and even in situation has little to recommend it. Besides, we shall be so far off that there will be no running backwards and forwards between the ship and the shore as there was at Rio. Of course it depends a good deal on the amount of the water coming down the river, but vessels sometimes have to anchor twelve miles above the town.\" \"I am sure I have no desire to go ashore,\" Mrs. Renshaw said, \"and after the narrow escape Wilfrid[Pg 80] had at Rio I should be glad if he did not set foot there again until we arrive at the end of the voyage.\" \"He is not likely to get into a scrape again,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"Of course it would have been wiser not to have stopped so late as they did in a town of whose ways they knew nothing; but you may be sure he will be careful another time. Besides, I fancy from what I have heard things are better managed there, and the population are more peaceable and orderly than at Rio. But, indeed, such an adventure as that which befell them might very well have happened to any stranger wandering late at night in the slums of any of our English seaports.\" There was a general feeling of disappointment among the passengers when the Flying Scud dropped anchor in the turbid waters of the La Plata. The shore was some five or six miles away, and was low and uninteresting. The towers and spires of the churches of Buenos Ayres were plainly visible, but of the town itself little could be seen. As soon as the anchor was dropped the captain\u0027s gig was lowered, and he started for shore to make arrangements for landing the cargo. The next morning a steam tug brought out several flats, and the work of unloading commenced. A few passengers went ashore in the tug, but none of the Renshaws left the ship. Two days sufficed for getting out the goods for Buenos Ayres. The passengers who had been staying at hotels on shore came off with the last tug to the ship. Their stay ashore had been a pleasant one, and they liked the town, which, in point of cleanliness and order, they considered to be in advance of Rio. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3165/86842.html","bookId":869,"book":{"id":869,"title":"Maori and Settler","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š WELL, mother, one thing is certainsomething has got to be done.
