{"id":4410,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 俄 巴 底 亚 得 了 耶 和 华 的 默 示 。 论 以 东 ， 说 ， 我 从 耶 和 华 那 里 听 见 信 息 ， 并 有 使 者 被 差 往 列 国 去 ， 说 ， 起 来 吧 ， 一 同 起 来 与 以 东 争 战 。 [kjv] The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. [bbe] The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord has said about Edom: We have had word from the Lord, and a representative has been sent among the nations, saying, Up! and let us make war against her. 1:2 [hgb] 我 使 你 以 东 在 列 国 中 为 最 小 的 ， 被 人 大 大 藐 视 。 [kjv] Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised. [bbe] See, I have made you small among the nations: you are much looked down on. 1:3 [hgb] 住 在 山 穴 中 ， 居 所 在 高 处 的 阿 ， 你 因 狂 傲 自 欺 ， 心 里 说 ， 谁 能 将 我 拉 下 地 去 呢 ？ [kjv] The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? [bbe] You have been tricked by the pride of your heart, O you whose living-place is in the cracks of the rock, whose house is high up; who has said in his heart, Who will make me come down to earth? 1:4 [hgb] 你 虽 如 大 鹰 高 飞 ， 在 星 宿 之 间 搭 窝 ， 我 必 从 那 里 拉 下 你 来 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD. [bbe] Though you go up on high like an eagle, though your house is placed among the stars, I will make you come down from there, says the Lord. 1:5 [hgb] 盗 贼 若 来 在 你 那 里 ， 或 强 盗 夜 间 而 来 ， （ 你 何 竟 被 剪 除 ） 岂 不 偷 窃 直 到 够 了 呢 ？ 摘 葡 萄 的 若 来 到 你 那 里 ， 岂 不 剩 下 些 葡 萄 呢 ？ [kjv] If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes? [bbe] If thieves came, attacking you by night, (how are you cut off!) would they not go on taking till they had enough? if men came cutting your grapes would they take them all? 1:6 [hgb] 以 扫 的 隐 密 处 ， 何 竟 被 搜 寻 ？ 他 隐 藏 的 宝 物 何 竟 被 查 出 ？ [kjv] How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up! [bbe] How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his secret stores looked for! 1:7 [hgb] 与 你 结 盟 的 ， 都 送 你 上 路 ， 直 到 交 界 。 与 你 和 好 的 ， 欺 骗 你 ， 且 胜 过 你 。 与 你 一 同 吃 饭 的 ， 设 下 网 罗 陷 害 你 。 在 你 心 里 毫 无 聪 明 。 [kjv] All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him. [bbe] All the men who were united with you have been false to you, driving you out to the edge of the land: the men who were at peace with you have overcome you; they have taken their heritage in your place. 1:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 到 那 日 ， 我 岂 不 从 以 东 除 灭 智 慧 人 ， 从 以 扫 山 除 灭 聪 明 人 。 [kjv] Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? [bbe] Will I not, in that day, says the Lord, take away the wise men out of Edom, and wisdom out of the mountain of Esau? 1:9 [hgb] 提 幔 哪 ， 你 的 勇 士 必 惊 惶 ， 甚 至 以 扫 山 的 人 ， 都 被 杀 戮 剪 除 。 [kjv] And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. [bbe] And your men of war, O Teman, will be overcome with fear, so that every one of them may be cut off from the mountain of Esau. 1:10 [hgb] 因 你 向 兄 弟 雅 各 行 强 暴 ， 羞 愧 必 遮 盖 你 ， 你 也 必 永 远 断 绝 。 [kjv] For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. [bbe] Because you were the cause of violent death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever. 1:11 [hgb] 当 外 人 掳 掠 雅 各 的 财 物 ， 外 邦 人 进 入 他 的 城 门 ， 为 耶 路 撒 冷 拈 阄 的 日 子 ， 你 竟 站 在 一 旁 ， 像 与 他 们 同 伙 。 [kjv] In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. [bbe] Because you were there watching when men from other lands took away his goods, and strange men came into his doors, and put the fate of Jerusalem to the decision of chance; you were like one of them. 1:12 [hgb] 你 兄 弟 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 瞪 眼 看 着 ， 犹 大 人 被 灭 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 因 此 欢 乐 。 他 们 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 说 狂 傲 的 话 。 [kjv] But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. [bbe] Do not see with pleasure your brother\u0027s evil day, the day of his fate, and do not be glad over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction, or make wide your mouth on the day of trouble. 1:13 [hgb] 我 民 遭 灾 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 进 他 们 的 城 门 。 他 们 遭 灾 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 瞪 眼 看 着 他 们 受 苦 。 他 们 遭 灾 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 伸 手 抢 他 们 的 财 物 。 [kjv] Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; [bbe] Do not go into the doors of my people on the day of their downfall; do not be looking on their trouble with pleasure on the day of their downfall, or put your hands on their goods on the day of their downfall. 1:14 [hgb] 你 不 当 站 在 岔 路 口 ， 剪 除 他 们 中 间 逃 脱 的 。 他 们 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 你 不 当 将 他 们 剩 下 的 人 交 付 仇 敌 。 [kjv] Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. [bbe] And do not take your place at the cross-roads, cutting off those of his people who get away; and do not give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble. 1:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 降 罚 的 日 子 临 近 万 国 。 你 怎 样 行 ， 他 也 必 照 样 向 你 行 。 你 的 报 应 必 归 到 你 头 上 。 [kjv] For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. [bbe] For the day of the Lord is coming quickly on all nations: as you have done it will be done to you; the reward of your acts will come on your head. 1:16 [hgb] 你 们 犹 大 人 在 我 圣 山 怎 样 喝 了 苦 杯 ， 万 国 也 必 照 样 常 常 地 喝 。 且 喝 且 咽 ， 他 们 就 归 于 无 有 。 [kjv] For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. [bbe] For as you have been drinking on my holy mountain, so will all the nations go on drinking without end; they will go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats, and they will be as if they had never been. 1:17 [hgb] 在 锡 安 山 必 有 逃 脱 的 人 ， 那 山 也 必 成 圣 。 雅 各 家 必 得 原 有 的 产 业 。 [kjv] But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. [bbe] But in Mount Zion some will be kept safe, and it will be holy; and the children of Jacob will take their heritage. 1:18 [hgb] 雅 各 家 必 成 为 大 火 ， 约 瑟 家 必 为 火 焰 ， 以 扫 家 必 如 碎 秸 ， 火 必 将 他 烧 着 吞 灭 。 以 扫 家 必 无 余 剩 的 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it. [bbe] And the children of Jacob will be a fire and those of Joseph a flame, and the children of Esau dry stems of grass, burned up by them till all is gone: and there will be no people living in Esau; for the Lord has said it. 1:19 [hgb] 南 地 的 人 必 得 以 扫 山 ， 高 原 的 人 必 得 非 利 士 地 ， 也 得 以 法 莲 地 ， 和 撒 玛 利 亚 地 ， 便 雅 悯 人 必 得 基 列 。 [kjv] And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead. [bbe] And they will take the South, and the lowland, and the country of Ephraim, and Gilead, as their heritage. 1:20 [hgb] 在 迦 南 人 中 被 掳 的 以 色 列 众 人 ， 必 得 地 直 到 撒 勒 法 。 在 西 法 拉 中 被 掳 的 耶 路 撒 冷 人 ， 必 得 南 地 的 城 邑 。 [kjv] And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south. [bbe] And those of the children of Israel who were the first to be taken away as prisoners, will have their heritage among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath; and those who were taken away from Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will have the towns of the South. 1:21 [hgb] 必 有 拯 救 者 上 到 锡 安 山 ， 审 判 以 扫 山 ， 国 度 就 归 耶 和 华 了 。 [kjv] And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD\u0027s. [bbe] And those who have been kept safe will come up from Mount Zion to be judges of the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom will be the Lord\u0027s.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/141/2055.html","bookId":151,"book":{"id":151,"title":"俄巴底亚书 Obadiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 俄 巴 底 亚 得 了 耶 和 华 的 默 示 。 论 以 东 ， 说 ， 我 从 耶 和 华 那 里 听 见 信 息 ， 并 有 使 者 被 差 往 列 国 去 ， 说 ， 起 来 吧 ， 一 同 起 来 与 以 东 争 战 。 [kjv] The vision of Obadiah.
