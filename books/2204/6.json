{"id":101699,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"Get up, Nell.\" \"No. I am not getting off this train until you let me see your chest.\" \"I told you before that I do not like to repeat myself. I will this once because I understand you are American, and thus stubborn. My chest is healed. You will get up now and come with me.\" I looked out the tinted window at the bright lights of the Prague central train station. I was tired, hungry, and a little dizzy from the amount of blood I\u0027d donated. We won\u0027t go into how my body seemed to hum every time Adrian was near. \"My stubborn American butt is not getting up off this seat until you bare your manly chest for me.\" I adopted the most innocent look I could muster. He muttered to himself in a language I didn\u0027t understand, then yanked me to my feet, pulling me close with one hand while opening his shirt with the other. \"OK,\" I said, running a finger down the jagged raised white scar line that was all that remained of the wound. \"You\u0027ve impressed me. The next time you get a sucking chest wound, I won\u0027t worry at all. So now what do we do? And who was Sebastian? Why was he after you? Is it just a Betrayer thing, or did it have something to do with the reason you were in Christian\u0027s castle, which, incidentally, is something you\u0027ve never explained. There\u0027s no time like the present, my mother always says!\" His hand clamped down on mine as I let my fingers do a little walking. \"I can feel your hunger. You will get some food while I arrange for transportation.\" \"You think you can just ignore my questions and I\u0027m going to let you get away with it, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"You don\u0027t scare me,\" I told him as I followed him off the train, more than a little surprised to find that it was true. There was a bond between us that had me worried about him, heartsick because I knew that I couldn\u0027t give him what he wanted - freedom from the curse - but I wasn\u0027t frightened of him anymore. He might break my heart (where had that thought come from?), but he wouldn\u0027t ever harm me. Not intentionally. \"I am more powerful, more determined, and infinitely crueler than you. You should be terrified of me. Do as I say without questioning me further.\" I thinned my lips in annoyance at his high-handed manner, blinking owlishly in the bright overhead station lights. \"What makes you think I\u0027m going to do what you want me to do? What makes you think I\u0027m not going to run to the nearest police station? Or to Melissande? You know, it\u0027s really not fair, you running off without telling her where her nephew is. She\u0027s worried sick about him.\" \"You will not run from me because you know that wherever you hide, I will find you. As for the other - Melissande\u0027s feelings do not matter to me,\" he answered, tugging me toward the lobby of the train station where rows of shops and small food stands lined the walls. Overhead, steel-ribbed glass skylights mirrored the people meandering through the station. I grabbed Adrian\u0027s sleeve as he headed for the ticket windows. \"Hold on a minute, Sparky. You haven\u0027t answered any of my questions.\" His frown was a thing of beauty to behold, magnificent in its black irritation. \"Sparky? First Ryan and now Sparky?\" He shook his head, his eyes a blue so icy I swore there were little icebergs floating around his irises. \"I am centuries old. I have sent more people to their deaths than you can possibly comprehend. You will cease referring to me as Sparky.\" I stood my ground. I knew if I let him get away with one single high-handed inch, he\u0027d drag it out to a mile. \"Answer my questions, and I might consider the request.\" \"I do not have to answer your questions. I am the Betrayer.\" \"You are also the Irritator, but that doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be civil, as well.\" He sighed the sigh of the truly martyred. \"If I promise to answer your questions later, will you feed now?\" \"Yes,\" I said, too aware of the growl of my stomach and the mouthwatering scents of a nearby food booth to deny his offer. \"But you have to promise to answer everything.\" His eyes went even lighter. I pointed a finger at his face. \"And you can just add how you do that to the list of things about which you\u0027re going to spill. I\u0027d love to be able to change my eye color.\" \"Feed,\" he growled before turning toward the ticket sellers. \"Feed. Come. Do what I say. We really are going to have to work at adding some words like \u0027please do this\u0027 and \u0027I would fawn at your feet in humble gratitude if you do that\u0027 to your vocabulary\" I yelled after him. His head shook again, indicating he heard me. I couldn\u0027t help smiling at him as he strode down the long lobby of the train station. Dressed entirely in black, his long wool duster flapping behind him, his hair sweeping down to his collar, he looked like a refugee from an artsy, atmospheric vampire movie. \"Someone\u0027s been reading way too many gothic novels,\" I mused as I lifted my chin to sniff the air, following the most enticing scent to a nearby sausage seller. I scraped together the remains of the money Adrian had given me and bought three sausage rolls. I had consumed one by the time he found me and herded me toward a secluded waiting area. \"We have two hours before the next train,\" he said, pushing me onto a bench. \"You\u0027re always pulling me along somewhere or shoving me down onto something,\" I complained around a mouthful of sausage roll. \"We really need to work on your people skills.\" He sat down beside me, a familiar scowl settled firmly onto his manly brow. \"I am a Dark One, not a person. I do not need people skills.\" It was my turn to sigh. I held out the last sausage roll, which he eyed with malevolent suspicion. \"What\u0027s wrong, don\u0027t like sausage? Or can\u0027t you eat food food?\" \"I can eat human food if I so desire, but it provides me with no sustenance.\" \"Well, that answers a question I\u0027d always wondered about vamps - whether or not they were biologically the same as the non-bloodsuckers. I mean, why have the plumbing if you\u0027re not going to use it?\" \"Plumbing?\" he asked, his scowl deepening. \"Yeah, plumbing.\" I flicked a glance toward his crotch. \"I know you have a belly button, and I figured that you have the usual genital accoutrements unless vamps do that differently, but from what I can tell, you\u0027re A-OK in that department - not that I\u0027ve looked or anything - but then there\u0027s the back door, and, well, I\u0027ve just always wondered. I mean, if you don\u0027t need it, why have it?\" He stared at me like I had suddenly sprouted buttocks on my head. I gave a weak smile. \"None of the vamp books I\u0027ve read have ever addressed that issue, so I thought I\u0027d go to the horse\u0027s mouth, so to speak.\" His eyes lightened to the color of a robin\u0027s egg. \"You are the strangest woman I have ever met.\" \"Strange in a good way, or strange as in ought to be locked up for her own safety?\" \"I haven\u0027t decided yet,\" he answered, leaning back against the wall, his gaze flickering around at the people nearest us. I debated saving the last sausage roll versus making myself a pig in front of Adrian, but decided in the end that if I had to do the blood-donor thing again, I\u0027d need all the nourishment I could get. While I ate I watched the man who in such a short amount of time had become increasingly fascinating to me. Although Adrian\u0027s body appeared relaxed, his hands resting open on his thighs, I could feel the tension in him. His eyes never rested as they constantly surveyed our surroundings. It struck me that although he\u0027d fed from me, he had probably used most of the energy he\u0027d gained from my blood to heal his wound. I knew he\u0027d stayed awake while I slept on the train, and now here he was almost on point, he was so alert. \"Adrian,\" I said, putting my hand on his arm to get his attention. He cocked an eyebrow in question, his eyes going sapphire. I lifted my hand, about to ask him if he was going to be all right, but stopped when his eyes went sky blue. I blinked a couple of times, then put my hand back on his arm. Twin irises of the purest sapphire regarded me with growing confusion. \"This is so cool! Your eyes change color when I touch you. Look!\" I lifted my hand again. Adrian rolled his (summer blue) eyes and started to turn away. I leaned forward and put my hand on his chest, over his heart. His eyes turned navy. \"Hoo! You\u0027re like a giant mood ring! I wonder if I can make different colors show up depending where I touch you.\" Adrian followed my speculative gaze to his fly, jumping up to stand in front of me in an aggressive pose, arms crossed over his chest, legs spread. \"I am not a mood ring! I am not a toy! I am dangerous and feared by all! You are not to treat me in such a flip, irreverent manner - \" I put my hand on his thigh, close to his groin, but not actually touching naughty parts. His eyes turned a dark midnight blue. \"This is so fun!\" I giggled, admittedly a bit less than sane after the very strange twenty-four hours I\u0027d spent. \"I could touch you all day! I wonder what would happen if I were to kiss you...\" \"There will be no more kissing,\" he answered on a growl. \"Kissing leads to the fifth step, and I refuse to go any further.\" \"Why?\" I asked, tipping my head to the side as I gave him a once-over, starting at the mid-calf-high black boots, moving up over the tightly fitting black jeans, the caress of silk across his stomach and chest, to the width of his shoulders as highlighted by the long black duster. I smiled into eyes as black and shiny as onyx. \"You said that if I was this Beloved person, I would be able to save your soul. Considering I can\u0027t charm that curse that binds you, it seems to me that I\u0027m pretty much your get-out-of-jail-free card. So why aren\u0027t you kissing my feet and begging me to save your soul?\" He sighed again and sat down next to me, silent for a few minutes before he said, \"You aren\u0027t my Beloved. You can\u0027t be her. My Beloved does not exist.\" Pain, disappointment, and something very much like regret fought for superiority within me. I put my hand on his, giving his fingers a gentle squeeze. \"You mean she\u0027s dead? I\u0027m so sorry, Adrian. I had no idea. You must have been devastated.\" He looked down to where my fingers gently caressed his, not saying anything, but I saw the sorrow in his eyes. I looked away, but from my peripheral vision I examined the red pattern that twisted around his torso. Even if I wanted to charm the curse, I knew it would be beyond my embryonic skills, skills that had been stunted before they even had a chance to grow. There was no way I could do what he wanted, but now it seemed I didn\u0027t even have to make the choice about whether or not I wanted to bind myself to him in order to salvage his soul. Which was a shame, because despite his fierce appearance and gruesome reputation, I was beginning to believe he was a man well worth saving. \"She did not die.\" \"I\u0027m a little confused,\" I said slowly, still stroking his fingers. \"She didn\u0027t die, but there is no one for you? I saw into you, really deep into you, remember, and you don\u0027t have a soul. If this woman didn\u0027t die, what happened to her?\" \"Nothing,\" he said, his voice rough with emotion. His hand twisted under mine so that our fingers were twined. \"My Beloved does not exist because I am not allowed to have one. To have a Beloved would imply that there is hope for me, and I can assure you from many centuries of experience, hope is one grace that has forsaken me.\" \"You can\u0027t say that,\" I said again, at a loss as to what I could do to relieve the pain shadowing his beautiful eyes. How could I make him believe I was his hope when I myself wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to take on that role? \"Adrian, I really wish I could help you, I honestly do. But as I told you back at the castle, I can\u0027t charm. You saw what happened when I drew that ward - something I truly didn\u0027t know I remembered - but it\u0027s pretty clear to me that my brain does not want me messing around with all that woo-woo stuff. I know you\u0027re hoping I\u0027ll lift the curse, but I can\u0027t. I wish I could, but I can\u0027t.\" \"You have the ability,\" he insisted, his fingers tightening on mine. \"You have the power. I see it in you. You are frightened, but it is a foolish emotion. No,\" he said, forestalling me as I was about to protest his high-handed dictates. \"There is nothing to debate - you must charm the curse. There is no other alternative.\" \"You can\u0027t make me charm the curse,\" I pointed out. \"I don\u0027t remember much from the few times I chatted with my friend\u0027s Wiccan aunt who told me I was gifted with special abilities, but I do clearly remember her saying that I had to want to use my skills in order for them to work. You can\u0027t force me.\" \"I can, and I will. I do not wish to force you to do anything, but about this, I am immovable. It is too important.\" His grip on my fingers was painful, but the agony in his eyes made my heart bleed. Through the touch of our hands I could feel the need within him, the endless torment that filled him with blackness, a torment that he was confident I could end. I shivered at the silent desperation in his eyes, turning my head so I could look away. \"Tell me about what a Beloved does.\" I couldn\u0027t charm the curse without destroying myself in the process, and quite likely him as well, but perhaps there was something I could do to help him. Maybe I could help relieve the suffering and anguish that gripped him so tightly. The time had come for a decision, and suddenly there was no choice to be made. I knew what I had to do - what I was meant to do. \"And before you say it, yeah, I know, you don\u0027t think you\u0027re allowed to have one because you\u0027re the big bad Betrayer and all, but maybe, just maybe I\u0027ve been given the nod to pinch hit for whoever your Beloved was supposed to be, but who isn\u0027t, because of the whole curse thing. If you understand what I mean.\" I could feel him studying me as I watched people at the far end of the waiting area. We were seated in an isolated corner, tucked away from the hustle and bustle that made up life at the train station. \"Once a Beloved has Joined with her Dark One, his soul is redeemed. She becomes his lodestone, his reason for living. He cannot exist without her.\" \"You mean he\u0027s her love slave?\" I couldn\u0027t help but smile at the thought of Adrian being wrapped around anyone\u0027s finger. \"Sounds cool to me! Wanna give it a whirl?\" \"He cannot exist, because to drink blood from anyone but his Beloved is poison,\" he answered with a heated look. \"He is not a slave to her, but the two are bound together for eternity.\" \"So the Beloved becomes immortal as well?\" A wistful desire filled me to be made whole, to be able to use my affected limbs as they were meant to be used, to never have to suffer the stares and quickly averted eyes when the weak muscles on the left side of my face were noticed. Surely such a gift would be worth regular blood donations. My eyes slid to Adrian, who was looking at our entwined fingers. It would certainly be no hardship to have him around me for eternity. I doubted I would ever get tired of looking at him, and the strange tension I felt around him, the promise of something profound, left me yearning for the completion I was sure we\u0027d find together. \"Yes. She is made immortal once the final step of Joining is made.\" \"Hmm.\" The idea was starting to sound better and better with each passing moment. Adrian by my side for eternity, a body without weaknesses, all the time I needed to study the past... oh, yes, the thought of being his Beloved presented a glittering temptation. \"Nell, I will not allow you to become my Beloved.\" \"Maybe you don\u0027t have any choice in the matter,\" I teased, still mentally picturing myself saving his soul, then spending the rest of our lives together bound in peace and harmony. \"I do,\" he answered, his lips a grim line. \"I refuse to bind you to me.\" I pulled my hand from him, pushing down the pain of his rejection. So much for peace and harmony. \"It is not because I do not want you,\" he said stiffly, grabbing my hand and tightening his fingers around mine. I risked a glance at his eyes, and almost recoiled at the anger visible there until I realized it was an anger directed inward. \"You have seen into my mind - you know that I desire you, that my body cries out for you. But I will not bind you to one with whom you can have no future.\" Distraught as he was, I knew that this wasn\u0027t the time to press him for more information, or to argue my point. Besides, I wasn\u0027t absolutely sure I wanted to commit myself to him, especially since I couldn\u0027t give him what he so desperately wanted. \"I feel horribly guilty about running out on Melissande,\" I said, blithely changing the subject. I gently rubbed my thumb over the back of his hand in order to get him to loosen his grip. He dropped my hand like it was made of spiders, turning away to watch the people nearest us. \"You didn\u0027t run out on her. I abducted you.\" \"At first. But you can\u0027t really imagine I would be here now with you if I didn\u0027t want to be.\" His outraged expression gave me the answer to that statement. Before he could go into his \"me Betrayer, you Jane\" routine, I added, \"Yeah, I know, you\u0027re the big, bad wolf and all that, but the fact remains that I\u0027m not a pushover, Adrian. I\u0027m here because I want to be here. I want to help you - within the limits of what I can do. But that doesn\u0027t mean I feel any less guilty about the fact that I was hired to help Melissande find her nephew. And since you have information that she needs, I figured it\u0027d be a fair trade if you gave me the info in exchange for my help.\" He thought about that for a moment. \"Melissande cannot help Damian.\" \"Why don\u0027t we let her be the judge of that?\" He grunted a disagreement, but didn\u0027t outright refuse to talk. \"What do you want to know?\" I settled back on the bench, tucking my hands into my coat sleeves to warm them. Funny how they never felt cold when Adrian was holding them. \"Let\u0027s start at the beginning - what were you doing at Christian\u0027s castle?\" His jaw tightened, and for a minute I didn\u0027t think he was going to answer. With an annoyed grimace, he admitted, \"Looking for the ring.\" \"Ah! The ring.\" I nibbled on my lower lip for a moment or two. \"Um. What ring?\" \"What ring? Melissande persuaded you to help her without mentioning the ring of Asmodeus?\" He shook his head, a disgusted look on his face. \"Foolish woman.\" \"She\u0027s not foolish, she\u0027s concerned. There\u0027s a difference. And yes, she mentioned a ring, but only briefly. I\u0027m sure she would have gone into more detail if we\u0027d had time. This ring - I assume, since you\u0027re looking for it, that it has some sort of power against Asmodeus?\" His hands clenched. \"Yes. It channels his power. Without it, he is crippled, bound to his prison, unable to free himself.\" \"That tells me why he should be looking for it, but not who you... oh.\" Just as the words left my mouth I remembered what Melissande had told me: Adrian the Betrayer was bound to the demon lord Asmodeus. Which meant if his master wanted the ring but was too weak to go hunting for it himself, his tame vampire would be the likeliest person to send on a retrieval mission. \"Asmodeus asked you to look for it?\" \"Yes.\" The word positively dripped ice cubes. I mused for a moment over the fact that his eyes had gone a flat, dulled ice blue. \"OK, got that, but what does this ring have to do with anyone else? Why did you say Melissande was foolish not to have discussed it with me? Wait - does this ring have power that can be used against Asmodeus as well as by him?\" \"Yes.\" The atmosphere surrounding Adrian was so cold, I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to see a polar bear strolling by. \"Ah, gotcha. So if Melissande gets ahold of this ring, she can either trot up to the A-man and offer him a trade - the ring for her nephew - or use it against him and force him to free the kid?\" \"To do either would be to sign both her and Damian\u0027s death warrants.\" His eyelids dropped to half-mast as he gave me a long look. \"The ring is a conduit to great power. Whoever wields it has within his hands the ability to destroy the lord Asmodeus. It would be fatal for one unlearned in the ways of the dark powers to try to use the power against him. Melissande has neither the strength nor the ability to battle Asmodeus.\" I pursed my lips, warmth flooding my belly with the way Adrian\u0027s gaze pounced on the movement. \"I take it you didn\u0027t find this ring at the castle?\" \"No. You did not happen to see it during your search of Dante\u0027s desk?\" \"A ring?\" I thought back to my scant few minutes in the wonderful library, dwelling for a moment on the warded book that yielded the notes and shell earring. Did Adrian know I had searched other places in the room than just the desk? He had recognized that the vase was warded, but perhaps he hadn\u0027t had time to look over the entire library and realize that a less obvious object had been warded as well. \"No, I didn\u0027t see a ring in his desk. How did you know that vase was warded?\" One auburn eyebrow rose in question. \"The vase in the library, the one you tested me with to see if I could recognize the ward. How did you know it was warded? Can you draw them, too?\" He shrugged. \"Anyone can draw a ward, but it takes a skilled Charmer or one learned in ward lore to unmake them.\" \"So you can see the ward as well?\" I pressed, a growing suspicion making it important to know whether he had searched Christian\u0027s books. I slowly slid my right hand from my sleeve, along my hip to the back pocket on my pants, watching Adrian from the corner of my eye. He didn\u0027t seem to notice the movement. \"Not see them, but feel them. When I was near the vase, I felt that it was warded.\" My fingers closed around the thin circle of the earring. \"What... uh... what does this Asmodeus ring look like? Something big and garish? Gold Tolkien-ish band? Red-hot to the touch and leaving scorch marks on whoever touches it?\" He gave me a curious glance. I smiled and looked as innocent as I could. \"Your smile is lopsided,\" he said, apropos of nothing. \"I know.\" I kept my lips curved despite the almost overwhelming desire to grind my teeth at his comment. \"Does the ring have spiders carved on it or something ghoulish like that? Does it leech blood? Is it connected in any way with a giant eye floating above a black tower?\" Adrian looked as if he wanted to roll his eyes, but managed to give me a weary look instead. \"Nothing so dramatic. And you thought I\u0027d been watching too much Buffy.\" \"Hey!\" I said, about to protest the fact that he\u0027d been in my mind again without my permission. \"The ring is about two centimeters in width, and consists of a thin circle of horn bound in gold.\" \"Horn?\" I asked, my stomach doing a lurch as I ran my finger around the approximately two centimeter-wide circular earring in my pocket, the one I had assumed was made of shell. \"What sort of horn?\" He looked away, once again scanning our surroundings. \"Unicorn.\" I laughed, the sound dying a cruel death on my lips as I realized he wasn\u0027t cracking a smile at his joke. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you? Unicorn?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m serious. Have you seen such a ring?\" I shook my head, the fingers of my right hand running around the object in my pocket, searching for a break that would indicate that it was an earring as I originally thought, and not a ring so powerful it could destroy a demon lord. There was no break. Adrian must have picked up on the sudden panic that filled me, because his eyes (medium blue) narrowed as they turned back to me. \"Are you sure you have not seen it?\" I cleared my suddenly tight throat and eased my hand from my pocket. I couldn\u0027t know for certain just what the object I\u0027d picked up was. I\u0027d have to examine it fully at the first opportunity before making a determination about whether it was a ring, or just a facsimile. \"Sure I\u0027m sure.\" When he stared at me a little longer, I added in all honesty, \"If I\u0027d seen a unicorn-horn ring, believe me, I\u0027d have said something.\" \"Mmm.\" He watched me carefully for a few more seconds before returning to his scan of the immediate area. \"What... uh... what would this ring do to a person? It\u0027s not evil, is it? It wouldn\u0027t take them over and make them do bad things?\" \"The ring itself is powerless - it is merely a conduit to the unbound power of Asmodeus. It is entirely up to the person wielding the ring whether or not the power is used for good or evil.\" I slumped in relief against the wall and wondered just what I\u0027d gotten myself into. In the span of slightly more than twenty-four hours I\u0027d slept soundly on a vampire, fed him my blood, all but offered myself as his nooky queen for the rest of eternity, and discovered my back pocket was quite likely to be home to a demon lord\u0027s limitless power. Some days it\u0027s just not worth the effort to stay sane.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-lies-and-vampires-dark-ones-3/page-6.html","bookId":2204,"book":{"id":2204,"title":"Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3)","description":"Storyline: Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3) As far as she can tell, Nell Harris is either going insane or she is in love.
