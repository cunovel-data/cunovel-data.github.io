It was steady and fairly strong.\n \"Sorry I had to do that, but it was necessary.\" After peering over the banister to the floor below to make sure it was empty, I hurried down the stairs, pausing frequently whenever the house made a noise. Breathing a sigh of relief that no one was around, I ran silently down a hall that seemed to stretch the length of the building, listening at doors for conversation or sounds of habitation. Melissande\u0027s voice was audible at one of the doors, along with the low rumble of a male voice. I picked up my pace upon hearing them, stopping only when I reached the back of the house. Another stairway faced me; this one had obviously been meant for servants in the days when people could afford such luxuries.\n \"Down means basement,\" I whispered as I descended the bare wooden stairs as quietly and quickly as possible, stopping to bend over the railing midway down to see if anyone was standing around below. No one was on guard.\n The basement was laid out in old compartment style - one room leading to another, which led to another, and so on the length of the big house. I had no trouble finding the door to the room Adrian was kept in, not just because it was the only door available, but because the wood of the door glowed gold with a confusion of numerous interlocking three-dimensional symbols that made it look as if someone had read too many books on how to create a Celtic knot.\n \"Let\u0027s see if I can unward this thing without blowing out any more circuits in my head,\" I said softly, looking at the door, allowing my vision to slip into a soft focus that let me visualize the pattern of the wards without subjecting them to intense scrutiny. It didn\u0027t take long before the mishmash of curves, lines, and curlicues doubling back on themselves separated into distinct symbols. I breathed a silent prayer as I reached out to the brightest symbol, tracing it in reverse. The ward flared for a moment when I reached the end of it, then dissolved in a shower of silver. Relief trembled in my voice as I touched the next ward. \"One down, five to go.\"\n Only the last one gave me any grief, and that was because it was a powerfully drawn ward that did not take kindly to me unmaking it. It was a circle-shaped ward, and as I undrew one line, the rest of the pattern shifted, knotting itself up again. My hand was shaking with strain by the time I finally wrestled the ward into nothingness, but I thought little of that as I threw open the door to Adrian\u0027s prison.\n I didn\u0027t get two steps into the unlit room before I was thrown backward onto the dirt floor by an enraged, furious vampire. A flash of fang was all I saw before he was at my neck, his teeth sinking deeply, pain hot and sharp mingling with my fear that he had been somehow pushed too far.\n \"Adrian! It\u0027s me!\" My voice was a thin whimper, but it was enough. Adrian pulled his mouth from my neck, his lips crimson with my blood.\n \"Nell?\" His eyes were a cold, flat onyx. \"You\u0027re alive.\"\n \"As are you. I wasn\u0027t sure you were, for a while,\" I said on a sob of happiness. I clutched him tight, reveling in the feel of him in my arms again. \"I thought at first I\u0027d killed you. You\u0027re all right? You\u0027re not hurt? Sebastian and Saer didn\u0027t harm you?\"\n \"They tried,\" he growled, his lips lowering to mine. I tipped my head back to welcome him, but he stopped before he touched me. \"Why didn\u0027t you answer me when I called you? Why did you ignore me?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were trying to reach me,\" I wailed, relief at finding him whole and safe making me weepy. \"I burned out my intercom when I spoke that banish ward. I tried to find you, but...\"\n I rubbed my forehead. Adrian\u0027s lips followed the path my fingers took. \"Do not distress yourself, Hasi. It will come back to you.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry you were worried.\" I tucked a strand of his hair behind his ear. \"I guess I was so focused on finding you, I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be trying to contact me.\"\n His face darkened as he pulled back, hauling me to my feet and dusting off my backside. \"Saer told me you had turned from me, that you were cleaving to him.\"\n \"Oh! I would never cleave to him!\" I threw myself in Adrian\u0027s arms, kissing him for all I was worth, leaving my lips on his as I added, \"You\u0027re the only cleave-worthy man in my life.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer that statement with words, but by the time he had made it clear that he too was in business for some cleaving, we were both breathless.\n \"Saer is a great big poop, and you shouldn\u0027t listen to anything he says,\" I said, panting just a little.\n His lips twisted into a wry smile as he grabbed up his satchel. \"I realize that now. What he said could not be.\"\n \"Right.\"\n I checked the room, creeping to the outer door to listen for sounds from above. It was silent.\n \"Obviously, he was trying to demoralize me.\"\n \"Men who are poops demoralize people all the time,\" I agreed as Adrian pulled me aside, forcing me behind him as we made our way to the next room.\n \"If I had been thinking correctly, I would have known that what he was saying could not be true. He told me you had given him Asmodeus\u0027s ring, and I know you would never do anything so foolish.\"\n I froze as Adrian paused in the doorway, his nostrils flared as if seeking the scent of danger. Satisfied there was none, he gestured me forward, silently making his way through the dimly lit room, noticing only when he reached the door to the next room that I wasn\u0027t with him.\n \"Nell? Come. We must escape now, before they discover you are missing.\"\n I gnawed my lip for a few seconds. Adrian made an exasperated noise, walking back through the room to stand in front of me. \"You can\u0027t be afraid of the dark - you came through this room on your own.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s not that. Uh... about the ring...\"\n He brushed my jaw with his thumb. \"What is wrong, Hasi? I cannot read your thoughts, but I can sense your emotions. Why are you feeling fear?\"\n I didn\u0027t have to tell him. I could just continue to play dumb and not tell him. He\u0027d never have to know.\n I sighed. I couldn\u0027t lie to him, not to Adrian. \"I did give Saer Asmodeus\u0027s ring.\"\n Adrian stared at me in disbelief.\n \"I didn\u0027t betray you,\" I said softly, putting my hand on his chest, my heart crumpling at the pain that flashed in his eyes. \"I thought he was you. No one - including you, I\u0027d like to point out - bothered to mention that you have an identical twin running around. So when I saw Sebastian and Christian in the train station, I gave you the ring to use against them. Only it wasn\u0027t you.\"\n His jaw tightened. His hands fisted. His body language screamed so much anger, I took a step back, even though I didn\u0027t really think he would harm me. \"You had the ring and didn\u0027t tell me?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know it was the ring until...\" The explanation dried up on my lips. I wanted to sink into the ground, sick with what I\u0027d done even though my motives had been good. \"I was going to tell you. I was going to - \"\n \"Allow him to use the ring to destroy us, perhaps?\" came a voice from the doorway.\n Adrian turned around slowly to face the blond man who lounged in the doorway with deceptive nonchalance. Adrian moved to block me with his body. I stepped to the side to look around him.\n \"Sebastian.\" Adrian\u0027s voice was soft, but filled with so much menace it made the hairs on my arms stand on end. \"So you still live.\"\n Sebastian made a courtly bow. \"As you see, Betrayer. Alas that the same will not be said of you come the dawn.\"\n \"The dawn?\" I asked. Adrian promptly moved in front of me again. I pinched his butt and stepped to his opposite side. \"What do you mean, the dawn? You guys don\u0027t like dawn.\"\n \"Your woman is not very intelligent, is she?\" Sebastian said, looking bored.\n \"Hey!\"\n \"You will leave Nell out of this,\" Adrian said in a macho he-man sort of way that simultaneously warmed my heart and made me want to crack him over the head with the Pan statue. \"She has nothing to do with this.\"\n I elbowed Adrian, and slapped his hand when he tried to pull me behind him. \"Like hell I don\u0027t. I\u0027m in this up to my armpits. Now, what exactly did your vague threat mean, Sebastian? What do you guys think you\u0027re going to do to Adrian?\"\n Adrian growled deep in his chest as Sebastian strolled into the room. \"A camarilla has been formed. The decision to destroy the Betrayer once and for all has been agreed upon.\"\n \"Destroy?\" I asked, horror growing at his words. They were going to toss Adrian out in the sunlight? Over my cold, dead body! \"You guys are insane! Utterly and completely - erk!\"\n Sebastian pulled a wickedly curved knife from his boot, casually gesturing with it.\n \"Stay back, Nell\" Adrian said, moving forward to answer the wordless invitation Sebastian offered.\n \"And let you get gored again? No, thank you.\" I grabbed Adrian and hung on. \"Look, this has gone too far. Obviously, Sebastian holds some sort of grudge - \"\n \"Grudge?\" the blond vamp snarled. \"He betrayed me, tricked me, helped bleed me dry until the only thing that stood between death and me was my desire for revenge. He did all that for the glory of his master.\"\n I looked back at Adrian. His eyes were indigo, intent on Sebastian. Although he stood as still as a statue, I knew he was poised to attack the other man. \"You did all that to him?\"\n \"Yes,\" Adrian answered, his eyes meeting mine for a moment, his gaze unabashed and offering no explanation.\n \"Oh.\" I turned back to Sebastian. \"Well, I\u0027m sure Adrian must have had a good reason to do it. He\u0027s not mean normally.\"\n \"A good reason?\" Sebastian asked a bit wildly.\n \"Do you think it\u0027s easy being cursed by a demon lord?\" I asked, hands on my hips. \"Do you think he\u0027s had fun being the Betrayer?\"\n \"Nell - \"\n \"No, Adrian, I want to know. I want Sebastian to tell me what he thinks it\u0027s like to be bound body and soul to a demon lord, forced to destroy your own people. I want to hear from his own lips just how much entertainment he thinks you got from all this.\"\n \"Nell, it does not matter - \"\n \"I want to hear how enjoyable he thinks it is for you to ruin everything and everyone you love. Go ahead, Sebastian. Tell me all about it.\"\n Sebastian stared at me in disbelief for a moment before looking at Adrian. \"This is the woman you would choose?\"\n Adrian\u0027s lips twisted in a wry parody of a smile. \"She does not always see things as we do.\"\n I smacked him on the chest. \"Thank you both so very much! Can we get back to the attempts to kill each other and stop talking about me like I\u0027m not standing right here?\" The second the words left my lips I regretted them. I held up my hand as Sebastian started forward. \"Wait! I didn\u0027t mean that. We can talk this out, I\u0027m sure we can. It\u0027s just a matter of finding a common ground - \"\n \"She will die after your withered corpse has turned to dust and been scattered to the wind,\" Sebastian told Adrian with an evil flick of his knife in my direction.\n Adrian growled and thrust me aside.\n \"What makes you think you can beat us both?\" I yelled, clutching the back of Adrian\u0027s shirt in my attempt to keep him from throwing himself onto the blond vamp. Adrian twisted and turned, trying to dislodge me, but I held on. There was no way I could stop them from trying to kill each other once the fight began, so I had to stop them before they started. \"You\u0027ve gone up against us before, Sebastian, and lost both times. All I have to do is draw a binding ward on you and - \"\n In hindsight, I realize that belittling Sebastian\u0027s abilities and threatening him with a binding ward wasn\u0027t the smartest move, but I was on the verge of exhaustion, both mental and physical, so allowances have to be made.\n Adrian didn\u0027t see it that way, though. When Sebastian switched his target and lunged for me, the wicked blade of his knife gleaming in the bare bulb hanging drunkenly overhead, Adrian sent me flying as he thrust his body between me and Sebastian. I cracked my head on the stone wall, seeing stars for a few seconds. By the time I cleared my head and got to my feet, Adrian - in better shape than the last time he\u0027d met Sebastian - had the blond vamp pinned to the wall by the knife at his throat.\n \"You dare attack my Beloved?\" Adrian snarled, his hand on the knife\u0027s hilt, ready to rip it across Sebastian\u0027s neck. Although Sebastian could survive the neck wound, not even a vampire with excellent regenerative healing skills could repair a severed head.\n \"Adrian,\" I said softly, holding out my hand as I would to an animal in pain while I slowly approached him. His breath came ragged and hard, his eyes ice blue, so pale they were almost white. \"I know you are thinking it\u0027s a good idea to kill Sebastian, but it isn\u0027t. You can\u0027t do this.\"\n A low growling noise emerged from Adrian\u0027s chest. I touched him gently on the arm, slowly moving closer so that my body pressed against his. Sebastian evidently realized how close Adrian was to killing him; rather than striking out, which would have meant his immediate death, he stood still, watching us. Blood snaked out of the wound in his neck, soaking the front of his shirt. I eyed it worriedly. He was losing too much blood too quickly.\n \"Sebastian is not your enemy, not really. He is just as much a victim of Asmodeus as you are,\" I said slowly, brushing my fingers through Adrian\u0027s hair in a gentle caress. \"I know you were forced to betray him. I know you had no choice then, but you have one now, Adrian. If you kill Sebastian, it will stain your soul forever. His death will haunt you for the remainder of your endless years.\"\n Pale blue eyes turned to look at me. I leaned forward, brushing my lips against his. As I did, his emotions swamped me, all his fury and anguish, a sort of madness at the thought that Sebastian would try to harm me. \"His death would haunt me as well. Do not do this, my love. Do not throw away the soul you have struggled for so long to regain.\"\n A great shudder went through him as I pressed my lips to his in a kiss that pleaded more eloquently than words. The madness receded with my touch, the fury that gripped him lessening.\n \"He would kill you if he could.\" Adrian\u0027s voice was low and rough, as if he hadn\u0027t spoken in years, his breath brushing hotly on my lips.\n \"The acts you were forced to carry out have given him reason to hate us,\" I whispered into his mouth, allowing his emotions to fill me. Behind the rage, guilt lay thick and black. \"But that does not mean you must hate as well. Every crime you have committed has been enacted against your will. Do not now commit one out of anger. Please, Adrian, show him mercy where none has been shown to you.\"\n He sucked in a deep breath, his eyes closing for a moment, and when they opened, they were clear again, a deep blue that signaled a return to sanity. He turned to Sebastian, the planes of his face stark. \"When you next think to kill my Beloved, remember that it was she who saved you.\"\n Sebastian had time only to respond in a squawk as Adrian yanked the knife from his throat, tossing the blond vampire\u0027s body across the room. I ran to follow him as he dragged Sebastian to the room in which he had been held captive.\n \"There is no lock. You must ward the door,\" Adrian said as he slammed the door, leaving Sebastian lying on a ragged cot within.\n Panic rose. \"I don\u0027t know how to ward a door!\"\n He frowned. \"Now is not the time for false modesty, Hasi. You drew a binding ward when you claimed you knew no wards. You spoke a banishment charm. I know you do not wish to use the part of your brain that controls your powers, but you must ward this door.\"\n I wrung my hands. \"I\u0027m not being modest. I don\u0027t know how to ward doors. You saw my memories - I was only taught a couple of wards, and those I barely remember. But\" - I stopped wringing and gave the portal a squinty-eyed look - \"I think I remember how the wards were drawn that I unmade. At least I remember the really hard one.\"\n It took me three tries: one incomplete ward that luckily held the door when Sebastian rallied enough strength to try to escape; a quarter-drawn ward that was so bungled, it tied itself into a knot and froze the doorknob; and then at last I completed a full ward.\n \"That\u0027s it,\" I said, breathing easier as Sebastian threw himself in vain against the door. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\n We made it out of the basement, up the stairs, and out the back door that led into a dark alley without anyone the wiser, although I knew it wouldn\u0027t be long before the unconscious muscle-man and the missing Sebastian were noticed.\n \"So, we\u0027re off to London, right?\" I asked as we stood crammed together in a phone booth a few blocks away from the house from which we\u0027d just escaped. \"We go find your brother and get back the ring?\"\n Adrian pulled a black notebook from his satchel, rifling through it. \"Reach in my pocket and find some coins small enough for the phone. We are going after Saer, but first we must seek assistance.\"\n I dug around in the pocket of his wool duster as he found the phone number he was looking for in his book. \"Assistance? What kind of assistance? Shouldn\u0027t we be hot on Saer\u0027s heels? He\u0027s had a couple of hours\u0027 head start on us - \"\n \"I have no money,\" Adrian reminded me. \"I cannot get us to London without money. I have a friend here in Cologne who will help me. Once we have the necessary funds, then we will fly to London.\"\n \"Yeah, but that\u0027s going to take time,\" I pointed out, driven by some inner need to hunt down Saer and get back the ring that I knew would save Adrian.\n \"I wish to leave as much as you do,\" he suddenly exploded, his eyes furious. \"Every molecule in my body is screaming for vengeance, but I cannot give in to it. You seem to think I am the paranormal equivalent of Superman, but I am just a man, Nell. Immortal, yes, but I cannot breach the boundaries of time and space, nor can I manufacture something out of nothing. As much as it galls me to be beholden to another, I must seek assistance in order to continue.\"\n Mortified, I wrapped my arms around him and kissed the wild pulse behind his ear. \"I\u0027m sorry. I have been expecting you to work miracles, haven\u0027t I? Blame it on Buffy. That show has done some serious misleading about vampires.\"\n \"Dark Ones,\" he corrected, his voice gruff now, but gruff with a warmer emotion as he tipped my head up to kiss me.\n \"I think my brain is recovering. I can feel what you\u0027re feeling when I touch you,\" I said just before his lips claimed mine. His mouth teased and tasted, his moan captured between us as I gave in to his demands and parted my lips, allowing his tongue to slip into my mouth, tormenting me with its sweet touch. He was surrounded by a thick veil of desire that had me squirming with a matching fire. I couldn\u0027t merge with him fully, but pressed against him as I was, his tongue invading my mouth, I knew he was as aroused and full of need as I was.\n A man in an overcoat, huddled under an umbrella that streamed silver by the light of the blue-tinted streetlight, rapped impatiently on the glass door of the phone booth. I sucked Adrian\u0027s bottom lip for a moment, then released it. \"I don\u0027t suppose this friend of yours has a room we could use for a little bit?\"\n An odd look flickered across his face as he turned to the phone, dropping in the coins I handed him. \"As a matter of fact, she does.\"\n He spoke briefly into the phone in German so rapid I had a hard time keeping up with it.\n \"OK, I got that your friend has opened her door to us, but what was that about Brussels? Where exactly does she live?\" I asked as we vacated the phone booth.\n Adrian wrapped his arm around my waist, hauling me up close as we hurried through the dark, wet streets of Cologne.\n \"Gigli lives on Br¨¹sseler Platz in the Belgische Viertel, the Belgian Quarter. We can take the tram.\"\n Cuddled up against him, I could feel both his distraction and concern as he constantly scanned the people passing, no doubt watching for Sebastian or Christian. No one tried to stop us as we boarded the train that led to an area of town filled with historic old buildings and expensive apartments.\n \"So, exactly who is this Gigli woman?\"\n \"She\u0027s not a woman, she\u0027s a knocker.\"\n \"She has what?\" I asked, my voice filled with outrage as I stopped dead on the cobblestone street. Vampires don\u0027t use words like knockers! Everyone knows that!\n Adrian tugged me forward. \"Not what, who. Gigli is a knocker.\"\n \"And what\u0027s a knocker when she\u0027s at home?\"\n \"Knockers are Welsh spirits. They used to inhabit mines.\"\n I stopped again, but Adrian was ready for me and hauled me up tight, urging me forward over the slick cobblestones. \"A spirit? You\u0027re taking me to see a spirit? A Welsh spirit?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Spirit as in ghost? You have ghost friends?\"\n \"Spirit as in an incorporeal being now inhabiting a human form.\"\n \"Oh.\" I contemplated that during the time it took for us to turn the corner toward a small square. \"What is a Welsh spirit doing in Germany?\"\n Adrian shrugged. \"She likes the beer.\"\n I ground my teeth. \"Just when I thought I was getting a handle on this whole Dark One/demon lord/imp thing, you go and throw knockers into the mix. I\u0027m going to have to request that you stop, Adrian. I\u0027m about at my limit of how many impossible things I can believe before breakfast.\"\n He flashed a heart-stoppingly roguish grin at me, his dimples just about bringing me to my knees. \"Your middle name wouldn\u0027t be Alice, would it?\" he asked.\n \"No, it\u0027s Diane, and you\u0027re no White Rabbit, so let\u0027s just stop pretending we\u0027re in Wonderland, OK?\"\n He laughed and pointed across the tiny square at our destination. I watched him for a moment, seeing a glimpse of the charming, charismatic man he must have been before the demon lord cursed him and leeched away all the softer emotions. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-lies-and-vampires-dark-ones-3/page-10.html","bookId":2204,"book":{"id":2204,"title":"Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3) \n As far as she can tell, Nell Harris is either going insane or she is in love.
