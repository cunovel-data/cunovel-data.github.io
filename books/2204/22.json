{"id":101715,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Sebastian was waiting for me in front of the door to the conservation room containing the ivory griffin-headed figure that held Asmodeus in bondage.\n \"I knew you would come. Saer doubted it, but I knew you would have to come. I am pleased. Adrian\u0027s death will be that much sweeter, knowing you will witness it.\"\n I smiled at him. \"You know what your problem is?\"\n The gloating light in his eyes faded a little, a faint frown forming as I continued to smile at him. \"My problem, Charmer, is about to be destroyed.\"\n \"Wrong,\" I said softly, making a fist with my ring-bedecked thumb on the outside. Before he could blink, I punched him in the jaw with everything I had. Evidently the ring added a little extra oomph, because Sebastian flew backward two feet and slammed into the door to the storeroom, his head connecting soundly with the solid metal door. For a second his eyes stared at me with utter and complete surprise, then they closed as his body slid down the door with a whump. \"Your problem is that you underestimate just how determined a pissed-off Beloved can be.\"\n I stepped over Sebastian\u0027s prone body, pushing open the door. \"One down, two to go.\"\n This room was about three times as large as the one in the sub-basement that had held Damian, and filled with tall metal shelving units holding a number of packing cases and archival picture boxes. I knew I had the correct room - I could feel Adrian\u0027s presence like a warm, comforting blanket.\n An incredibly angry warm, comforting blanket.\n I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d like to show a morsel of gratitude that I love you so much that I\u0027m willing to die with you rather than spend my life alone ?\n There was no answer, although waves of frustration rolled over me. For some reason, he had refused to merge his mind with mine, no doubt part of his form of protection. I walked past several of the shelves, coming into a section of the room that had been cleared of everything but a table covered in a black and purple cloth, a big, ugly, beigeish statue, and two men, one of whom resembled a pincushion.\n Saer spun around as I cleared the last of the shelves, surprise evident for a moment in his eyes before a nasty smile curled his lips. He made an elaborate bow, one hand holding a wickedly sharp, long sword.\n I ignored him to look at Adrian. He was skewered to the wall by a number of different sizes and types of swords, blood flowing freely down his body to pool around his feet. His eyes were the color of a blue-tinged full moon, but I judged that all in all, he wasn\u0027t in too much danger. The fact that Saer hadn\u0027t pulled the swords out acted as a deterrent to the bleeding, and although I knew the blood loss was going to leave Adrian weakened and ravenous, he didn\u0027t seem wounded to the point of death. \"Hey, sweet cheeks. How are you doing? I mean, other than having all those swords in you?\"\n Adrian glared at me. \"Why did you ignore my command to stay away?\"\n I put my hands on my hips. Two could play at righteous indignation. \"Well, for one thing, we had a plan, and that plan did not include you running off to be a sacrifice. For another, I\u0027m not the command-obeying sort of girl, not when the love of my life is intent on throwing away everything we have just because he\u0027s so noble he couldn\u0027t fart without first asking everyone\u0027s permission.\"\n His eyes grew round with outrage, his irises darkening. \"I am not that noble! If I farted - which I do not, because I do not ingest food - I would do so at will, without consideration of anyone\u0027s feelings. You are the one who is noble. You refuse to admit defeat, and continue trying to save me when you know that nothing can be done.\"\n I looked pointedly at the five swords piercing his torso. \"And which one of us has all the swords sticking in his body?\"\n His scowl was a thing of beauty to behold. \"Hasi, I insist that you leave this room at once.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You will do as I say!\"\n \"Nope. Not this time.\"\n \"Nell, I will not explain it to you again! There is nothing you can do. Leave now!\"\n I leaned forward and, carefully avoiding the swords, kissed the tip of his nose. \"Make me.\"\n \"What?\" I thought his eyes were going to bug out.\n \"I said make me. You can\u0027t, huh? That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, snuggypants. I\u0027m going to help you cream Saer, and then we\u0027ll take care of that curse that I see peeking through the blood.\"\n \"I am so glad to know I have not been forgotten in this charming domestic scene,\" Saer said, a dry edge to his voice. He stood behind me, his arms crossed over his chest, the sword held in one hand.\n \"Oh, sorry, forgot about you for a moment. Torture, Saer? Was that really necessary?\" I glanced over my shoulder to glare at him.\n \"Not in the least.\" His smile grew as he gestured with the sword toward Adrian. \"But it was very enjoyable.\"\n Fury rose within me - my own fury, not Adrian\u0027s. I spun around to face Saer, furious that he could joke about torturing a brother who had spent his entire life bound to pain and anguish. \"You know, I think I\u0027ve had just about enough of you. Say good night, Saer. It\u0027s time for you to get what\u0027s coming to you.\"\n \"And just who do you believe is going to see to my punishment?\" He strolled around me, touching me gently with the tip of his sword. I stood still, twisting the ring on my thumb, wondering if it would protect me if he tried to run me through with the sword. \"You? A third-rate Charmer who can\u0027t even call a charm without weakening herself to the point of insensibility?\"\n Adrian growled. I have never heard another human being growl the way he did. It was animalistic, deep and intense, a warning so effective it raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Out of the corner of my eye I could see him bracing himself, his hands fisted, his eyes pale with anger.\n \"You cannot even draw a ward that will last any amount of time,\" Saer added with a smug look.\n \"I may not be any great shakes at warding or charming on my own, but you know what? As long as I\u0027ve got the ring, I am damn near invincible.\" Saer, making his circuit around me, touched my neck with his sword. I whirled around, batting it out of the way as I held up my hand to show him what I bore. \"You have run out of time, little man. Vigor hausi!\"\n As the words of the draining curse left my lips, I gathered up every ounce of anger, every morsel of fury, every part of my vengeance, and slammed it toward Saer, pulling on Adrian\u0027s darkness to give the curse form.\n A blinding flash erupted between us as the curse whipped against Saer, knocking the sword from his hand, sending him backward a couple of steps, but before I had a chance to gloat, he leaped forward, backhanding me into the wall six feet behind me.\n Wrath like nothing I had ever known filled the room as Adrian roared. I blinked, shaking my head to clear my vision, knowing that something had gone wrong. The curse I\u0027d used was meant to drain Saer of all power. He shouldn\u0027t have been able to not only withstand it, let alone have enough strength to knock me across the room.\n \"So, brother, you are at last driven to action,\" Saer taunted, snatching up his sword and quickly sliding the tip of the cold metal against my neck. Pain stung my neck as the sharp blade cut into my skin. My vision returned enough to allow me to see Adrian standing beyond him, the swords ripped from his body, a bloody curved Saracen\u0027s blade in his hand. \"I wondered if even your Beloved would be able to rouse a sense of honor in you. It has been lacking for so long - \"\n Adrian\u0027s blade flashed. Saer\u0027s head parted company with his body. The body stood for three seconds, then collapsed onto my legs.\n I looked down at the headless ex-vampire, and wondered if now was a good time to scream.\n Hasi, my Beloved one, how badly are you injured?\n I looked at the face that examined me so anxiously, raising up a shaking hand to touch his blood-soaked shirt. \"You cut Saer\u0027s head off?\"\n \"Yes. He was going to kill you. Lift your chin and let me look at your wound.\"\n \"That\u0027s it? You just cut his head off?\" I stared at Adrian for a second, then peered down to where Saer\u0027s body still lay across my shins. His head had rolled to a corner, coming to rest in the pool of Adrian\u0027s spilled blood.\n \"Yes, that\u0027s it. Hasi, if you would just lift your chin, I will be able to see to your injury.\"\n I pulled my gaze back to his dear, adorable face. His eyes were clear blue, concern and love warming them. \"That\u0027s... it? You cut his head off, and wham, bam, no more Saer? No more torment? No more threat of him trying to use Damian? It\u0027s over?\"\n It is over, Nell. You are bleeding. You must allow me to see to you.\n His hand was warm, but insistent on my chin. I lifted it to allow him to see the small cut on my neck. He tsked over it, tearing off a bit of his shirt to tie a makeshift bandage around my neck. I waited until he was done before screaming, \"Why the hell didn\u0027t you kill him centuries ago?\"\n He sat back, frowning that my question had been presented as a bellow. \"I had no reason to kill him until he abducted Damian. And once you became involved, the matter was made more complicated. I knew he would use you against me as he had used Damian. Until I knew the two of you were safe, I could not strike him. Sebastian alone had returned - I had to make sure that Saer had not found Damian before I allowed you to enter the museum.\"\n I pushed him back, kicking my legs until they were Saer-free, accepting the hand Adrian offered to get me to my feet. Adrian\u0027s explanation made sense, but still... \"It\u0027s over. I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s over. I walk in here, you\u0027re playing Adrian-the-pincushion one minute, and whammo! the next you lop off Saer\u0027s head and it\u0027s over.\" I shook my head, reeled to the side, and decided as Adrian grabbed me and pulled me up against his chest that head-shaking was going to be off my list of approved activities for the next few days. \"No. It can\u0027t be over. It can\u0027t end this easily.\"\n Hasi, you seem to have some difficulty accepting the finality of Saer\u0027s death. Did you hurt your head when he struck you? Are you feeling sleepy or sick to your stomach ? Do you see two of me?\n I disengaged myself from him so I could give him a really quality frown. \"I am not witless, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re implying, and don\u0027t deny you are, because I can read you like a billboard! I cracked my head on the wall, but other than a bruise, I\u0027m fine. I just can\u0027t believe that after all this buildup, it\u0027s over with one swoop of a sword. I\u0027ve seen lots and lots of vampire movies, and none of them ever end this easily. No. Something is wrong. He\u0027s going to come back to life or something. Vampires always do. Look at Dracula - he was always reforming himself from scattered dust or a blob of blood or a cursed ring...\"\n I looked down to my hand as I spoke, shrieking when I discovered the ring was gone. \"Where is it? Where\u0027s my ring? Help me find it!\"\n Nell, there is no need -\n \"Eeek!\" I screamed, kicking aside Saer\u0027s lifeless legs to pluck the three pieces of shattered ring from under him. \"It\u0027s broken! Oh, God, I broke the ring! Now what are we going to do?\"\n \"We no longer need it, Nell. Saer is dead. Damian is safe. Sebastian is not a threat to us. We do not need the ring.\"\n \"Yes, we do,\" I whispered, looking up from where the shards lay in my hand. Tears formed and swelled over my lashes as I looked at him, looked at his blood-soaked shirt. Saer had carefully picked spots on Adrian\u0027s body that would cause maximum agony while guaranteeing that his natural restorative powers would keep him from dying. Already the bleeding had slowed to a sluggish dribble, his body beginning the healing process. I touched the cold wetness of his shirt, my fingertip on the apex of a curved red line. \"We need the ring to charm your curse.\"\n He looked at me, his eyes filled with sad acceptance. I have lived almost five centuries bearing the curse, Hasi. If I must live longer bound to Asmodeus, so be it.\n I slipped into his arms, wrapping him in all the love and light and joy he brought me. Inside him, the darkness was still there. His soul was still missing, but at least I knew I could fill the emptiness. But for how long would that be enough? If you are still bound to him, will he not continue to make you do things? Bad things? To your own people?\n He didn\u0027t answer for the longest time, just held me, our beings merged together so our strength was shared. Yes, I will still have to answer his call. But he cannot destroy you. He knows that your death will mean my own.\n I\u0027m not worried about him killing me, I answered, nuzzling the sweet spot behind his ear. I\u0027m worried about what his demands will do to your soul.\n It is almost mine, Hasi. You have reclaimed it for me. It is within my grasp.\n \"No, it\u0027s not,\" I said, pulling away from him, wiping the tears that wetted my cheeks. \"We both know what I\u0027m going to have to do, Adrian. I know you\u0027ve avoided thinking about it, but there is no other way. We can\u0027t have a life together if you are still the Betrayer. I love you, but I will not stand for you spending the rest of our lives causing death and sadness to your own people. I have to do what I meant all along to do with the ring - I have to charm the curse.\"\n \"You will not put yourself at risk for me. You were right in that the ring protected you before, Hasi. To try to charm without it - \"\n \"I know what it means,\" I said, moving around him to face the small ivory statue that sat on the purple and black altar cloth. \"But there is no other choice. Either I lift the curse, or... well, I\u0027m just not going to think about that.\"\n Adrian grabbed my arm, pulling me back to him, his eyes lightening as his anger seeped out. \"And what if you fail? What if you have another stroke, Nell? Am I so horrible that you would rather risk permanent injury or even death to spending your life with me? Am I that much of a monster to you?\"\n Monster? No, I answered, stroking a lock of hair off his brow. Look in my heart, my love. Do you see anything there but the most profound feelings of adoration for you? I love you with everything I am, Adrian. But you know as well as I that our life together will be tainted if you are not freed from your bondage. I don\u0027t want to do this. I\u0027m frightened of what may happen if I try to charm without the ring protecting me. I don\u0027t want to have another stroke.\n Then do not try it, he commanded, holding me so tight I could scarcely breathe. I cannot tolerate even the thought of you coming to harm on my behalf. We will find a way to avoid Asmodeus. We will seek help from those learned in demon lore. There is no need for you to fear the future.\n I drank in his essence for one last moment before stepping back. \"I\u0027m more frightened of what will happen to us if I do not do this. No\" - I put my palm on the cold wetness of his shirt, holding him back - \"this is my decision. I have to do this. So rather than spending the next half hour arguing with me about it, why don\u0027t you just pretend we\u0027ve already hashed it out and I won?\"\n He opened his mouth to protest, but instead acknowledged that I was determined to go forward with my plan. Grudgingly he gave me a gift - his support. \"We will face this together, Hasi. Always together.\"\n I faced Adrian, his hands on me as we stood before the statue, our hearts as tightly bound as our minds. The statue sat inanimate on the table, but from the corner of my eye I could see snakes of power emanating from it, flickering and twisting as if they were alive.\n Ready? I asked Adrian, raising my hand to touch the starting point of the curse bound to his chest.\n I love you, Hasi, he answered, his eyes so full of the proof of his declaration that I almost wavered in my determination to end his torment once and for all. Instead I pressed my finger to the beginning of the curse, jerking back as my arm immediately went numb from cold.\n \"Heed me, Asmodeus, lord of darkness, master of night.\" The cold crept up my arm to my shoulder, toward my head. A sudden warmth stopped the flow as Adrian\u0027s hand on my neck kept the cold from freezing my brain.\n My finger swept around the first of six knots that made up the curse, untangling it as I spoke. \"By my blood, I turn this hex placed upon the man before you. By my bones, your power does now take flight.\"\n Pain and rage crackled along my skin as I moved through the second knot, my hand shaking so hard with cold and fear that I had a hard time keeping my finger on the curse. \"By my heart, I disperse your will through and through.\"\n Light, white-hot and filled with a scream of fury, burst into my head. The horrible sensation I\u0027d felt ten years before gripped me, tearing me apart as the need to stop, to preserve myself, warred with the knowledge that I was the only one who could save Adrian.\n You have already saved me, Hasi. You can never fail me, no matter what the outcome. You have given me love where I have known none. Beyond that, all else pales.\n Adrian\u0027s words, soft and warm, insinuated themselves through the light and pain, lessening both until I could focus my mind again.\n My finger traced through the fourth and fifth knots. \"Where there was pain, now joy remains. Where there was darkness, light will reign.\"\n With a cry that came close to shattering my eardrums, Asmodeus burst forth from the figure, his body mangled and twisted, a personification of evil so horrible I could not bear to look at him. I tried to turn away, but his eyes fixed on me, and as he raised his hand, my body exploded in sheer, unending agony. I arched against Adrian, his presence in my head drowning out in the light that began tearing my brain apart. My body was numb on the outside, the cold gripping it so I could not move, but on the inside, my soul wept blood as Asmodeus\u0027s voice echoed in my head.\n You will die before I release my servant to you.\n Then I will die, I screamed, fighting to make my arm move, to make my finger trace the pattern of the last knot. It wouldn\u0027t move. It was locked, frozen with cold.\n Pain caused my legs to buckle, but I did not fall. I was blinded by the pain and light, but I knew it was Adrian who held me up. It was his hand that was the warmth I felt on my frozen arm, his love that bound us together and gave me the strength to fight on when I wanted to surrender to the pain. On the verge of unconsciousness, and sick with the knowledge that with each passing second more of my brain was being destroyed by my act of charming the curse, I moved my finger through the last intricate swirls and twists of the remaining knot. \"Battered, beaten, torn, and harmed, by my love, this curse I charm.\"\n Die, then! Asmodeus\u0027s vengeance swept over me, ripping me from Adrian\u0027s arms, swinging me up in a maelstrom of pain, fury, and eternal anguish. The light in my head grew until it spilled out of me, turning the world into one unending moment of agony. I sank into it sick with the knowledge that I had failed.\n I can\u0027t move my legs.\n Can you not?\n I can\u0027t move my arms either.\n Ah. Why is that, do you suppose?\n Hmm. Let me think about it. Maybe the large, sweaty vampire draped over me has something to do with it.\n Dark One, Hasi. I am a Dark One, not a vampire. I have explained this to you time and time again, and yet you insist on referring to me in the popular vernacular. Besides, it is honest sweat. You cannot scorn it.\n I opened my eyes and smiled at Adrian, pulling my arm up from where it had been pinned when he collapsed on me after making the sweetest love possible. I trailed my fingers over the lovely contours of his bicep before skimming my hand down his side to pinch the very firm flesh of his behind. \"Even wet with the honest sweat of a job well done - and it was a job very well done, not that you need me to praise your sexual prowess anymore - I adore you.\"\n \"As is right,\" he said smugly, his head dipping to nip the skin of my shoulder.\n \"Ow! The dining car is closed! You had three courses already, you can\u0027t still be hungry.\"\n He growled into my neck. I am always hungry for you, Hasi.\n I grinned and trailed my fingers across the back of his neck, one of his particularly ticklish spots. \"You just like flaunting that soul around, that\u0027s what it is. I have nothing to do with it - you\u0027d probably be just as happy making love to a hole in a tree so long as you could do it with your soul enhancing all the feelings.\"\n \"A hole in a tree!\" he yelled in mock outrage, flashing his fangs at me. \"You forget who you are speaking to! I am powerful! I am feared! I am - \"\n \" - sexy as hell, and you know it.\"\n His lips curled into a self-satisfied smile. \"Woman, you will be punished for such abuse!\"\n He rolled over, pulling me with him as he prepared to render his version of punishment, which always ended up in wild bunny sex.\n \"Are you done yet? It\u0027s been three hours!\" Came a peevish voice from the doorway.\n I eeked and scooted down Adrian\u0027s body until the blankets hid most of me. Adrian glared over my head at the boy standing in the open doorway. \"I have told you before - now that Nell is with us, you must knock before entering our bedroom.\"\n I slithered off Adrian, shimmying over to the far side of the bed, reaching out from under the blankets to feel for the bathrobe Allie had lent me. I had been wearing it when Adrian ripped it from my body. Maybe it had slipped under the bed.\n \"I did knock. You didn\u0027t hear me. She was laughing.\"\n \"Nell has a name. She is my Beloved. You will treat her with respect, and not refer to her as she.\"\n My hand, scrabbling around under the bed, closed around a dry, round object. I froze.\n \"You like her better than me!\" Damian shouted. \"She smells funny! How can you stand to be around her?\"\n Adrian rolled his eyes and sat up in bed. \"We have had this discussion before. You are my son. I love you. I will always love you. But I also love Nell, and if you give her the chance and stop rejecting her advances, she will take you into her heart as well.\"\n \"Oh, yeah, like he\u0027s going to allow me to do that,\" I muttered as I pulled the object out from under the bed.\n \"Are we going to the museum or not?\" Damian demanded, ignoring his father\u0027s request. \"She said we could go. I want to see the mummies.\"\n I stared down at Ginger\u0027s head. His jaw cracked open in a grin. I slapped a hand over his mummified lips to stop the coo of pleasure I knew he was about to make.\n \" Who said you could go to the museum?\" Adrian asked.\n Damian sighed a sigh of such martyrdom that only a ten-year-old could produce it. \"Nell.\"\n \"Thank you. We\u0027ll be out in ten minutes. I suggest you comb your hair and change into clean clothing,\" Adrian said.\n I carefully shoved Ginger\u0027s head back under the bed. Adrian\u0027s arm snaked around my waist, pulling me back until I rested on his chest. \"I am not sad that you returned the mummies to their inanimate state, Hasi, but I must admit that it was more convenient when Damian could look at them without requiring us to escort him to the museum.\"\n \"Uh...\" I said, gnawing on my lip, wondering how I was going to tell him that in the confused two days that followed the charming of his curse - my recovery from going one-on-one with Asmodeus taking most of that time - I might have given him the impression that I had actually performed a curse returning the mummies to their previous state, rather than just thinking about it, which was as far as I\u0027d gone what with the whole joyous reunion with Adrian after finding out I hadn\u0027t really died.\n Adrian\u0027s arms tightened around me. \"Do not worry about Damian, Hasi. He will come to love you as much as I do. It will just take time for him to adapt to the change in our circumstances.\"\n I smiled into his chest, kissing a pert little nipple that taunted me. \"Yeah? Well, until then, I have four words for you.\"\n His breath sucked in as my teeth grazed the tender morsel of nippleness, his hands sweeping down my back to wrap around my behind. \"And those words are?\"\n \"Dark One boarding school.\"\n His laughter filled my heart, filled my soul, filled the night with more happiness than the world could contain. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-lies-and-vampires-dark-ones-3/page-22.html","bookId":2204,"book":{"id":2204,"title":"Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3) \n As far as she can tell, Nell Harris is either going insane or she is in love.
