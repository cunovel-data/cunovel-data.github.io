{"id":101698,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Ow. Stupid rock. My next kidnapper is going to have a Porsche.\"\\n\\n Adrian said nothing, but the hand nearest me tightened into a fist, as if he wanted to strangle something. I had an uncomfortable feeling I knew what. Or rather, who. That worry didn\u0027t stop me from continuing, however. For some reason I didn\u0027t care to examine fully, I had gone from being terrified of Adrian to comfortable. Oddly comfortable. As in very, very strangely comfortable. And all because he was nice to me when he could have been cruel.\\n\\n The fact that he didn\u0027t eat me for dinner also helped improve my overall impression of the Betrayer.\\n\\n I shivered and trudged down the winding road that led from Drahanska Castle to the nearby town of Blansko, where I fervently prayed Adrian had a car stashed. \"My next kidnapper is going to know how to kidnap a girl in style. He won\u0027t drag me off to a dirty, rat-infested hole, starve me, then make me walk miles and miles and miles after the sun has gone down. He\u0027ll kidnap me using his sports car with comfortable heated leather seats, complete with picnic basket filled with goodies. A sexy red sports car.\"\\n\\n There was no response from Adrian other than his jaw tightening.\\n\\n \"A convertible!\"\\n\\n \"For the love of God, woman, what do you want from me?\" he burst out, his eyes flashing an irritated midnight blue. \"I asked you if you wanted me to carry you, but you said you\u0027d rather die first.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I didn\u0027t mean it literally! Death by blisters, what an ignominious way to go.\" I rubbed my arms to keep the circulation going, wincing as I stepped on yet another rock.\\n\\n \"You have absolutely no respect for me, do you?\" he asked, shooting me an annoyed look. \"You have no idea how powerful and dangerous I can be. I am feared and loathed by all of my people, hunted like an animal by those who would destroy me, but you aren\u0027t the least bit in awe of me, are you? You should be terrified of me, and all you do is complain.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m a bit in awe of those fangs,\" I said, trying to make him feel better, although I honestly didn\u0027t know why I cared if his feelings were hurt or not. \"Aren\u0027t they in the way like that? You must have to mumble a lot when you\u0027re in public, so people won\u0027t see them. And don\u0027t your lips get snagged on them? I had braces when I was in my teens, and I tore my lips on them something terrible. I\u0027d offer you some lip balm, but my purse was left behind when you abducted me. I hope the real Christian gives it back. All my money and my passport are in it.\"\\n\\n \"Dark Ones do not wear lip balm,\" he said in an outraged voice.\\n\\n I shrugged and amused myself for a few minutes by trying to make the white puffs of breath that hung briefly in the air before me into a bat shape.\\n\\n \"No,\" Adrian said before I could ask the question. \"I can\u0027t change into a bat.\"\\n\\n I stopped in the middle of the road, a feeble moon casting light down upon us from between suitably dramatic wisps of cloud. \"Stop. Reading. My. Mind!\"\\n\\n His fingers clamped around my wrist as he hauled my protesting feet forward. \"I can\u0027t help it. You\u0027re projecting.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I gasped, outraged. \"I am not! I never project!\"\\n\\n \"You are. You don\u0027t put up the slightest barrier to your thoughts. All I have to do is...\" A warm presence touched my mind. I sucked in a deep breath of icy air at the feel of him merging with my thoughts. It was the most intimate touch I\u0027d ever felt, far more intimate than just the joining of bodies.\\n\\n Smug male satisfaction filled my mind.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" I said, pushing him out of my mind. \"It\u0027s not polite to wander around in someone\u0027s head without them knowing.\"\\n\\n \"You know,\" he grumbled. \"You have to know. You also know you can read me just as easily as I can read you.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you think that?\" I looked at the tall, dark figure next to me. \"I\u0027ve never been any good at guessing what people were thinking, let alone able to read minds.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve marked you,\" he said grimly. \"It\u0027s the first step of Joining.\"\\n\\n \"Marked me? You haven\u0027t even touched me. I know you\u0027re the big bad wolf and all - \"\\n\\n \"The Betrayer,\" he interrupted. \"I am the Betrayer. I am hated and feared - \"\\n\\n \" - by all your people, and hunted down like the dog you are, yadda yadda. Yeah, I know, you told me. I guess that\u0027s why I\u0027m not afraid of you anymore, Adrian the Betrayer. You didn\u0027t hurt me when you could have.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the reason,\" he said shortly. I couldn\u0027t see his face because a cloud had drifted across the moon\u0027s face, but we were coming into town, which meant I should soon be able to see if his expression was as grim as his voice. \"It\u0027s something much worse.\"\\n\\n \"Worse? What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n He refused to answer. Our conversation - sporadic at best - dried up into nothing as we started up a short hill into the town of Blansko.\\n\\n \"Nell,\" he said a little while later as we passed through a dark square. \"You - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, look, a train station! I bet you could hire a car there or something. And they probably have food, too. I\u0027m starving. Come on.\"\\n\\n \"Nell.\" He grabbed my arm in his steel-fingered shackle grip and pulled me up so his mouth was next to my ear. To any of the few people driving through the square, we probably looked like lovers who couldn\u0027t wait to get home. \"You will remember that you are my prisoner. You will keep uppermost in your mind at all times the fact that I\u0027m a dangerous creature of darkness. I am a killer, a betrayer, a man without a soul who will not hesitate to destroy anyone who stands in his way.\"\\n\\n I looked up at his face, visible in the bluish-white glow of a lamppost. A little ripple of fear skimmed down my back at the expression in his eyes. They were ice blue, and utterly hopeless. Without thinking of the folly of what I was doing, I turned so I faced him fully, gently touching the side of his face. Darkness, deep and all-consuming and endless, raged within him, a gaping hole inside him where his soul should have been. I wanted to fill the emptiness, to change the darkness to hope, and love, and happiness. I knew instinctively that I could lift the curse that bound him so tightly, easing the torment that had him within its twisted grip, but to do so would mean I had to open up that part of my mind that I had all but destroyed ten years ago.\\n\\n The part of my mind that had killed an innocent woman.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, my voice a thin ribbon of sound on the cold night air as I lowered my hand. \"I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t ever do that again.\"\\n\\n His eyes went dark as I felt the soft brush of him against my mind. I turned away, as if that would keep him from seeing the truth about me. I had not thought for one moment that he hadn\u0027t noticed the slackness in the left side of my face, or the weakness in my left hand and leg, but he had not asked about it, and I hadn\u0027t offered an explanation.\\n\\n \"What do you hide from me?\"\\n\\n I stilled, clutching my guilt to myself. He turned me so I was facing him. Suspicion filled his face as he narrowed his eyes. \"I cannot read what you hide. What secret do you have that fills you with so much horror?\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath, trying desperately to calm my suddenly racing heart. His thumb brushed over the pulse in my neck in a gesture so gentle, I almost melted at his feet. \"You\u0027re not the only one who has betrayed people,\" I said finally.\\n\\n \"Who...\" he started to say, then stopped abruptly, lifting his head as if scenting the night air. \"Do prdele!\"\\n\\n I glanced around to see what had startled him, but saw nothing. We were in a dark square, the houses facing us dimly lit or dark already, even though it was only a little after nine at night. A few cars had zipped by us, but no walkers passed, and nothing nearby seemed to pose a threat.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Go.\" He shoved me forward. Beyond the square was a pink stone building that I recognized from the drive in with Melissande as the train station.\\n\\n Melissande! I hadn\u0027t thought of her after wondering whether she would know I had been abducted. Surely she would count on my lust for the breastplate, at least, to keep me from walking out on her as it may have seemed I\u0027d done. Had Melissande tracked us? Was I going to be rescued?\\n\\n More importantly, why did I feel a distinct sadness at the thought of leaving Adrian?\\n\\n \"Quickly, go to the train station. Buy two tickets for Prague. The train leaves in less than twenty minutes. I will meet you at the platform.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute!\" I grabbed at a lamppost as he pushed me down the sidewalk.\\n\\n \"You will do as I command,\" he snarled, spinning around to glare in the direction we had just come from.\\n\\n I smacked him on the arm. \"First of all, I don\u0027t take well to commands without an explanation. If you want me to do something, tell me why. And second of all...\" I took a couple of steps back when he whirled toward me, his eyes all but spitting blue flames into the night. The words Id been about to utter, telling him he could stuff his Mr. Macho attitude, died on my lips. \"Uh... I don\u0027t have any money. You hustled me out of the library so fast, my purse was left with Melissande, remember?\" I held up my empty hands.\\n\\n He swore again in Czech, thrusting his hand in his inner jacket pocket before shoving a wad of bills at me. \"Go!\"\\n\\n Before I could protest, he was off, slipping into the shadows as if he\u0027d been made of them.\\n\\n \"Which,\" I said to myself as I peered down the length of the square trying to follow him, \"is just about as apt a simile as I\u0027ll ever find. All right, Nell, what are you going to do?\"\\n\\n I looked down at the money in my hand. I could take it and buy myself a ticket to Prague, where I could throw myself on Melissande\u0027s mercy. I could hire a taxi to take me back to Drahanska Castle, where I could recover my purse. I could trot myself to the nearest police station and report my abduction (leaving out a few key insights into Adrian\u0027s dark nature).\\n\\n \"Or,\" I said on a sigh as I turned for the pink stone building, \"I could buy two tickets to Prague, and spend the rest of the night figuring out why the hell I care the least bit about a bad boy vampire. Assuming he shows up from wherever he\u0027s gone off to, that is.\"\\n\\n I bought two tickets. The ticket seller told me that the train was running a little late, but that it should arrive within the next half hour. Hunger gnawing at my stomach, my first act after paying for the tickets was to plug some change into a candy machine and consume three honey-chocolate bars in swift succession.\\n\\n I think the sugar high must have done something to me, because by the time I was done licking the last of the chocolate from my fingertips, I was pacing the length of the sidewalk outside the train station, periodically pausing to consult the large clock in a minuscule waiting room.\\n\\n \"This is ridiculous. He\u0027s not coming. He\u0027s run off to find himself a quick dinner or something,\" I muttered, not believing it, but feeling better for saying it. \"He\u0027s not going to make the train. You should be happy, Nell. You\u0027re free again. No more bossy vamp pushing you around. You can tell Melissande what happened, get your stuff, and go home.\"\\n\\n Without the breastplate.\\n\\n Without helping Melissande locate her nephew.\\n\\n Without Adrian.\\n\\n \"Right, you can just stop thinking that, for one,\" I lectured myself, peering out into the darkness in hopes of seeing a large, vampire-shaped man running my way. \"He might be nummy, and he might smell good, and he might be filled with so much pain it hurts to even think about it, but he\u0027s a vampire. A night walker. A bloodsucker. And he betrays people, to boot. He\u0027s no good with a capital NO. Who cares if those other vamps he was talking about have found him? Who cares if they beat him up? Who cares if they... aw, hell!\"\\n\\n I ran down the sidewalk, following the path I had taken to get to the station. Try as I might, I couldn\u0027t deny that Adrian and I had some sort of connection, and I couldn\u0027t just stand around if he needed help. I told myself it was so I could worm out of him the information he knew about Damian - I owed it to Melissande to do what I could to help, since I wasn\u0027t going to do what she had brought me here to do - steadfastly ignoring the truth that it was Adrian I really wanted to help.\\n\\n The square we\u0027d stopped in was still dark. \"Well, now what?\" I asked myself as I spun around in a circle. I had no idea what threat he had seen, or even if it was a threat. Maybe I had been right - maybe he had gone off to dine on an unwary person walking their dog.\\n\\n Or maybe the hunters had caught up to their prey?\\n\\n I stood in a dim pool of light, wracked with frustration and indecision. Adrian had said I could read him as well as he could read my mind, but what would result if I tried to use my mental radar to pick up where he was? I started to turn back toward the train station, remembering all too well the horror of what had happened the first and only time I tried to use a part of my brain that lay dormant in most people. Would trying to make contact with him cause another stroke? What if something worse happened?\\n\\n How could I try, knowing it might permanently damage me?\\n\\n How could I ignore the fact that Adrian might need me?\\n\\n \"Fine,\" I snarled to the darkness, one hand on the cold metal of a lamppost as I closed my eyes. \"But if I die from this, I\u0027m coming back as a ghost to haunt him for the rest of his unnatural life.\"\\n\\n I focused my thoughts on Adrian, what he looked like, smelled like, how he felt warm and solid when I was pressed against him, and the gentle touch of his mind on mine.\\n\\n Nell? The word was soft in my head, filled with surprise and, strangely, anger. What are you doing?\\n\\n Rescuing you, I answered grimly, my eyes snapping open as I marched off in the direction I suddenly knew Adrian to be.\\n\\n His derisive snort filled my thoughts. I am a Dark One. I am immortal, one of the most powerful beings of the ages. I do not need the help of a mortal, and certainly not a female mortal.\\n\\n Yeah? Well this female mortal isn\u0027t buying the macho act, so you can just - behind you!\\n\\n I ran down the sidewalk, spinning around a corner and slipping on a patch of black ice as I raced toward the alley where I knew I\u0027d find Adrian. Behind him I could sense another person, someone as powerful as he was.\\n\\n Driven by heedless fear, I dashed across a street, right in front of a car that careened around the corner, its brakes squealing as I made an abortive attempt to avoid colliding with it. Pain burst across my left side as I bounced off the hood, hitting the frozen pavement with enough force to leave me breathless and stunned.\\n\\n \"Ow,\" I gasped, doing an inventory of my arms and legs to see if anything was seriously injured. I had just determined that I had nothing worse than a few bruises when a big shape loomed overhead for a second as it jerked me upright, slamming me backward into the car that sat running a few feet away.\\n\\n \"Where is he?\" a man snarled into my face.\\n\\n I blinked quickly to try to clear my vision. \"What?\"\\n\\n The blond man holding me up by the collar of my coat twisted the material until I was choking. His face was filled with anger, lips drawn back to expose wicked-looking fangs. \"The Betrayer. You reek of him. Where is he? Tell me or you die.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said honestly, sure that Adrian must have left the alley I\u0027d \"seen\" him in.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t an answer the man liked. He snarled something rude in French that I pretended I didn\u0027t understand, his eyes gleaming with fury as he tightened his grip on my coat. I choked, black spots starting to swim before my eyes.\\n\\n \"You lie!\"\\n\\n \"I swear to you, I don\u0027t know where he is,\" I wheezed, trying desperately to get some air past the stranglehold he had on my neck.\\n\\n \"I will not leave you alive to help betray others,\" he hissed. Jerking me forward, he ripped my coat until my neck was bared. I gasped in pain when I sucked in much-needed air, the blackness that had been threatening to overwhelm me, blinding me to the fact that his head was descending toward my neck until I felt his breath on my skin.\\n\\n Every atom in my body was repulsed by the thought of him touching me in such an intimate way. I tried to summon enough strength to fight off the vampire who intended on taking my life, but my arms and legs were strangely slow to respond.\\n\\n Adrian! my mind screamed. I struggled feebly against the blond man as he jerked me closer, his breath hot on my skin, when suddenly he froze. He began to swear, leaving me positive I was going to die at that moment.\\n\\n A rush of air, a familiar scent, and a deep, sexy voice snarling some inventive curses in German saved me. I sagged against the car, one hand massaging my aching throat as I gasped for air, my eyes on the two men who fought in the road. Adrian and the blond man were of the same size, but where the blond was wiry, Adrian was all solid strength. It wasn\u0027t limitless strength, I knew, and I could feel an echo from Adrian\u0027s mind that there was another Dark One nearby.\\n\\n A train\u0027s warning horn sounded twice in the distance.\\n\\n The blond threw a punch that would have decapitated a mortal man. Adrian\u0027s head snapped backed as he staggered sideways, and I knew I had to help him. He was too hungry, too tired from watching over me during the daylight hours, to beat two determined vampires. I looked around the empty road for something I could use as a weapon to disable the blond, but there was nothing.\\n\\n Adrian lashed out at the vamp with his foot, slamming into the other man with enough force to send him flying.\\n\\n Obviously, somewhere down the centuries Adrian had found time to study martial arts. I yanked open the car door in search of a gun, or stake, or whatever vamps used to kill each other with, but found nothing. Snatching the keys from the ignition, I jumped aside when the blond lunged past me, yelling something anatomically impossible as a knife suddenly appeared in his hand, glinting brightly in the light from a nearby building. A flick from his wrist and the knife was flying through the air. Adrian leaped to the side, but not quickly enough. The knife imbedded itself to the hilt in his chest.\\n\\n \"No!\" I screamed, running toward him.\\n\\n \"Now you die, Betrayer,\" the blond man said, swaggering forward.\\n\\n Adrian faced the vamp, his chest rising and falling quickly as he pulled out the knife. The black of his shirt grew even darker as a wet stain spread across it. I knew without touching his mind that he was quickly running out of strength, the wound coming perilously close to nicking his heart.\\n\\n \"You will die and our people will be safe at last,\" the blond vamp snarled.\\n\\n Adrian raised his head, but it wasn\u0027t to glare at the vamp. His gaze touched mine, and I blinked in surprise to see in it regret mingled with sorrow. Within seconds those emotions were gone, and his eyes were brilliant ice-blue chips of determination.\\n\\n \"You have tried to destroy me before, Sebastian, and you failed. You will not succeed this time either.\"\\n\\n Adrian was gathering himself for an attack, an action that I knew in my heart would leave him dead. Without thinking, I threw my hands out and drew the pattern that had been burned into my brain so many years ago, piercing with relative ease the shadow that had lain over part of my psyche.\\n\\n Sebastian\u0027s eyes widened as my hands, remembering something my brain had long forgotten, sketched ancient symbols into the night air. The symbols twisted and curled upon themselves, glowing silver in the air for a moment before fading.\\n\\n Immediately, pain sharp and deep slashed through my head. I clutched my temples, desperately trying to stay on my feet as Adrian stared in surprise for a moment at the glowing symbols. Sebastian cursed and swore as he tried to move, only then realizing what I had done.\\n\\n The stab of pain melted into my brain, leaving me faintly dizzy and weak. Adrian grabbed my hand and jerked me past the impotent, snarling Sebastian.\\n\\n \"I will destroy you, Betrayer! You and your Beloved both will die for the crimes you have committed!\"\\n\\n \"What the hell?\" I asked, staring at my hands as Adrian dragged me down the road, forcing me into a limping gallop alongside him while he muttered about making the train. \"Where did that come from?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a Charmer,\" he answered breathlessly. \"You drew a ward to bind him.\" He glanced at me briefly as we approached the train station. \"You said you could not charm, and yet you drew a powerful ward.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t look at me, I have no idea how I did that,\" I replied, glancing behind us, the pain caused by drawing the ward thankfully a fast-dimming memory. \"The other vamp is still out there.\"\\n\\n A blast from beyond the station warned that the train was about to leave.\\n\\n \"It matters not. Come. We must hurry.\"\\n\\n I raced up the steps, pausing at the top when Adrian almost doubled over, his hand to his chest.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hurt badly, aren\u0027t you? We\u0027ll stop and - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" he gasped, shoving me past him into the station, toward the platform. \"We must leave now. I do not have the strength to fight the two of them together.\" Too much blood has been lost. I must feed.\\n\\n His thought shimmered in my mind as we raced through the station. I jerked the tickets out of my pocket as we burst out onto the platform. The train tooted its horn a couple more times, slowly starting to move. Adrian lunged forward, jerking open one of the doors. I told my aching body it could rest if it got me on that train. Then I said a little prayer and jumped. I fell onto the floor inside, quickly pulling myself out of the way as Adrian threw himself beside me.\\n\\n We lay panting and gasping for a few seconds before he got to his feet, helping me up. I waved the tickets at the conductor, who had given a mildly curious glance at our unorthodox entrance before we collapsed into a seat at the end of the car as my entire body screamed abuse at me, my mind numb with the events of the last twenty-four hours.\\n\\n Adrian sat in the seat facing me, hunched over, his hand to his chest.\\n\\n \"Are you OK?\" I asked. Stupidly. Of course he wasn\u0027t OK, he\u0027d just been stabbed. Even a vampire had to feel a stabbing.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, his breath shallow and fast. \"Your head... I felt your pain. Is it better?\"\\n\\n I touched my temple. \"All gone, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to try warding again.\"\\n\\n The conductor wandered over to check our tickets. I gave them to him, scooting over to sit next to Adrian, casually leaning into him in a way that would hide the blood seeping out of his chest. I didn\u0027t want to think about at what point I\u0027d gone from being captive to protector; I just wanted the conductor gone so I could see how badly Adrian was hurt.\\n\\n After a few questions about where we were going, the man moved off to another car. I waited until a couple with two screaming kids passed us before turning to Adrian. \"How bad is it?\"\\n\\n I pushed his shoulders until he was leaning back at a drunken angle, using my body to shield us in case anyone went down the aisle in the center of the car.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s healing. Leave it.\"\\n\\n \"I told you I don\u0027t take orders without a good reason.\" I brushed his hand aside and unbuttoned the black silk shirt that was glued to his chest, biting my lip at the deep slash in his pectoral muscle. The knife had barely missed hitting his nipple, and, going by my scanty knowledge of anatomy probably had come very close to striking him in the heart. The wound was still bleeding, but sluggishly. \"You can heal yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, his head back. I gave the wound a long look, then stripped off my jacket and pulled my arms from the sweater I was wearing. Beneath it, I squirmed out of the thin cotton camisole, taking it off and re-donning my sweater before turning to him. His face was still, his lashes thick slashes of black on cheeks gone pale with the loss of blood. Using my teeth, I tore a little hole in the bottom of the camisole, ripping off a couple of long strips before folding the remainder of the fabric over into a soft pad.\\n\\n \"This may hurt,\" I murmured as I glanced around the car before pressing the pad to the hole in his chest. His eyes opened to watch me as I slid my hands into his shirt and behind him, strapping the pad down with the strips of fabric. I tried my best to not notice the way the warm flesh of his naked back felt, but I couldn\u0027t resist spreading my fingers along the muscles before withdrawing my hands.\\n\\n \"Why are you doing this?\" he asked, his eyes narrowing as I buttoned his shirt.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really know,\" I answered truthfully. \"I was kind of hoping you\u0027d be able to tell me.\"\\n\\n His eyes closed again as his head sagged into the high back of the seat. \"Every unredeemed Dark One has a Beloved, a woman who can save his soul.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Melissande told me about that.\"\\n\\n \"In order to be redeemed, the two must Join.\"\\n\\n \"You mean sex?\" A warmth started in my belly, spreading out to the rest of my body as the wicked part of my mind indulged in some extremely detailed fantasies concerning him.\\n\\n \"No. Yes. Not wholly. A physical relationship is the fifth step, but there is more to a Joining than just lovemaking.\"\\n\\n \"So you think that because we can do the Vulcan mind meld, I\u0027m your savior, and we\u0027re bound to end up having wild bunny sex together?\"\\n\\n He grimaced with pain.\\n\\n \"All right, I\u0027ll take back the wild bunny sex question since you\u0027re in no shape to even be thinking about that. Just tell me about this fifth step,\" I asked, leaning forward to brush a tendril of hair off the stubble on his cheek.\\n\\n His eyes opened and caught me in a clear blue snare. I looked at his mouth, so near, so tempting. Normally held in a tight line, relaxed his mouth was sensual, the curve of his lower lip singing a sweet siren song that I couldn\u0027t resist. I kissed him gently, feathering light little kisses along his lips, watching in cross-eyed wonder as his eyes darkened to midnight.\\n\\n \"What was that?\" he asked, his breath fanning my face. I shivered at the rough touch of his voice, my mind filled with erotic thoughts that I wasn\u0027t entirely certain were mine.\\n\\n \"A kiss. I think you\u0027re sexy, remember?\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t a kiss,\" he said, his voice low, reverberating within me. \"This is a kiss.\"\\n\\n One hand tangled in my hair as his mouth claimed mine, the hot, sweet lure of his lips melting me into him as his tongue swept its way into my mouth, pushing aside any objections I might have wanted to make about the sinuous way it stroked me. I\u0027ve never been one who found tongues overly stimulating, but the way Adrian tasted me, it was different, erotic. His tongue twined around mine, enticing mine to follow in a sensuous dance. Various and sundry parts of my body tightened and ached as I felt a need in him, a need in myself to taste him. I flicked my tongue over the corners of his mouth, tasting his skin before diving into unknown territory. His mouth was as hot as the rest of him, and oddly enough, just feeling his heat made me shiver. I slid my tongue around the glossy enamel of his teeth, pausing to stroke down the length of an elongated canine tooth.\\n\\n Yeah. I know. How stupid is it to French kiss a vampire and not expect sharp teeth?\\n\\n I jumped as the tip of the tooth pierced my tongue, blinking in surprise as Adrian stilled beneath me. Our mouths were still joined, but I knew I was bleeding. A roar of hunger swept through him, through me, screaming a demand that he couldn\u0027t deny. He suckled hard on my tongue, groaning deep in his throat as he sucked off the bead of blood.\\n\\n I pulled my mouth from his, startled by the overwhelming desire that rocked him, feeling it as if it were my own. He stared at me, his eyes onyx now, and I knew what it was he wanted. Needed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hungry,\" I whispered, the background hum and clatter of the train all but obliterating the words. \"You haven\u0027t... er...\"\\n\\n \"Fed. No. There was no time before, and after, there was only you, and I couldn\u0027t...\" He closed his eyes, his jaw tense. I was draped across him, careful not to put any pressure on his wound, the movement of the train rocking us together beneath the flimsy blanket made up of our coats. This close to him, I didn\u0027t have to open myself up to feel what he felt.\\n\\n \"Why couldn\u0027t you... er... feed off me?\" I asked, turning my head so my lips brushed the bristled line of his jaw.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve already taken three steps of Joining.\" His voice was so raw it sent a shiver of desire down my back. \"Four, if you count this. You could have left me to the hunters, but you didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He touched his chest.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t quite follow you on this whole step thing, but I know you need blood. You\u0027ve lost a lot, and if your tank wasn\u0027t full to begin with, then you\u0027re really running on empty.\"\\n\\n Midnight-blue eyes looked at me, a question in their depths, almost hidden by hopelessness and despair. It wrung my heart, my throat closing with tears as I accepted the pain that howled within him, my body shaking as I took his darkness and fought to make it light.\\n\\n \"Take it,\" I whispered, pulling his head toward me. \"Feed.\"\\n\\n \"Nell.\" His lips brushed against the skin of my throat. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying.\"\\n\\n \"I know what I\u0027m doing,\" I lied, tilting my head back. \"Feed on me, Adrian.\"\\n\\n Beneath my hands, his shoulders shuddered as he fought the red wave of hunger that swept through him. I knew, in a distant part of my mind, that I should be horrified, sickened by what I was offering, by what I craved him to do, but the truth was, I ached to have him feed off me.\\n\\n Not feed... feast. The words echoed in my head just before his teeth pierced my flesh. I gasped and arched back, my eyes open but blind with the overwhelmingly erotic sensation of his mouth moving on my neck, his mind bound so tightly with mine that I could taste my own blood as it slipped down his throat. Within him the endless night that howled so cruelly faded a little, the torment easing as I gave myself up to the moment, trusting that he wouldn\u0027t harm me, locked in an embrace more arousing than anything I\u0027d ever known. My body seemed to catch on fire as his lips caressed my flesh beneath the cover of my coat, his hand spread wide over my breast before it slid down over my belly. The carnal images in his mind drove the fire higher, hotter, until I was sure I was going to explode with the heat.\\n\\n \"Adrian,\" I warned softly, his hair like cool satin as it brush my jaw. \"You can\u0027t. We can\u0027t!\"\\n\\n We can do anything we want, he answered, his fingers undoing the button on my jeans, pushing the zipper down until his hand could delve inside. Let me do this, Nell.\\n\\n \"I... oh, my God, someone will see you,\" I gasped, my hips lurching as his fingers slid along the satin line of my underwear, sliding beneath the delicate material to cup the most intimate part of me.\\n\\n Let me pleasure you, he begged.\\n\\n You pleasure me any more and I may just die. My body moved against him, belying my words. Little flicks of fire touched me where his fingers delved. I tensed, unable to draw a breath, my mind caught between his hunger and my own need, which he was driving higher and higher within me.\\n\\n Now, Beloved. One finger slid into me, triggering an explosion of white heat that seemed to consume the universe. I dug my fingers into his shoulders, trying to merge myself with him so that there would be no him and no me, only us.\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" I gasped what seemed like eons later as he pulled his head from my neck. His hand was withdrawing from me, zipping my jeans as I lay draped across him, my body quivering with little shocks of residual pleasure. \"Now I know why women find vampires so sexy. You\u0027re the most amazing... that was the best... you are absolutely incredible!\"\\n\\n He said nothing, just pulled me down so I fit comfortably against his shoulder, but I felt his slow, sensual smile as it stole across my mind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-lies-and-vampires-dark-ones-3/page-5.html","bookId":2204,"book":{"id":2204,"title":"Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3)","description":"Storyline: Sex, Lies and Vampires (Dark Ones #3) \\n As far as she can tell, Nell Harris is either going insane or she is in love.
