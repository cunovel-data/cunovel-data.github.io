{"id":70050,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"JASMINE DELEVIGNE ADMIRED HER NAKED BODY in the mirror. She was twenty-four years old, with smooth cafe au lait skin, long, slender legs and a new set of perfect silicone breasts, a birthday present from a powerful client. Cupping them lovingly in her hands, Jasmine thought, No. He\u0027s more than a client. He\u0027s my lover. I adore him.\\n\\n It was unlike Jasmine to get attached to the men who paid to share her bed. The daughter of a French businessman and a Persian princess, Jasmine Delevigne didn\u0027t need the money she earned as a hooker. She did it for the thrill. Just knowing that rich, powerful men, men with beautiful wives and even more beautiful mistresses, found her irresistible, so intoxicating that they would pay for the privilege of bedding her, gave Jasmine an incredible high. It was years since she\u0027d dipped into her trust fund. Her Fifth Avenue apartment, her vintage MG convertible, her wardrobe full of couture dresses and thousand-dollar-a-pair shoes; Jasmine\u0027s perfect body had paid for them all. Other people might call her a whore. People like her father, who lavished all his attention on Jasmine\u0027s mother and never noticed his daughter\u0027s efforts to please him. But Jasmine didn\u0027t care what they thought.\\n\\n I\u0027m a feminist. I fuck who I like, when I like, because I like. I answer to no one.\\n\\n She wandered into her dressing room and picked out some underwear. Chocolate-brown, silk La Perla panties and a matching camisole. Classy and feminine. Just how he likes it. It had been weeks since Jasmine had seen him and she was excited. There were others, of course. All her clients were good-looking, successful men, and all of them were good in bed. Jasmine Delevigne was the best, and she only worked with the best. But none of the other men had gotten to her the way that he did.\\n\\n The buzzer rang.\\n\\n He\u0027s early. He wants this as much as I do.\\n\\n Jasmine opened the door coolly, like the princess that she was.\\n\\n \"Hello, darling.\"\\n\\n He grabbed her by the throat. \"Take your fucking clothes off. Now.\"\\n\\n Jasmine\u0027s pupils dilated with excitement. I\u0027ve missed you so much.\\n\\n \"PLEASE! NO!\"\\n\\n Gavin Williams tightened the knots around Grace Brookstein\u0027s wrists. Then he lifted the cane and brought it down hard across the backs of her legs. Two livid red welts joined the others. Gavin Williams smiled.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll ask you again, Grace. Where is the money?\"\\n\\n She was crying. Begging. Lenny Brookstein\u0027s wife, his most treasured possession, was begging him, Gavin Williams, for mercy. But Gavin Williams would show no mercy.\\n\\n Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.\\n\\n He felt himself getting hard. He lifted the cane again.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, sir? Are you okay?\"\\n\\n Gavin Williams\u0027s fantasy evaporated. He was back at his desk at the SIBL, the Science, Industry and Business Library on Madison Avenue. The librarian was standing over him. Stupid, meddlesome bitch. Why couldn\u0027t she mind her own business?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure? You look very flushed. Would you like me to open a window or something?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Gavin snapped. The old woman got the point and returned to her seat.\\n\\n It was ridiculous, being forced to work in a public library. After Harry Bain had summarily dismissed him from the Quorum task force, Gavin\u0027s bureau chief had insisted that he take a paid leave of absence.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re stressed out, Agent Williams. You need some time off. Happens to all of us.\"\\n\\n It happens to weak idiots like you, you mean. Not to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m ready for service.\"\\n\\n \"Take the vacation, Gavin, okay? We\u0027ll call you in a couple of months.\"\\n\\n A couple of months? Gavin knew what was going on. John Merrivale had been conspiring against him. Poisoning the well. They all think I\u0027m crazy. Obsessive. But I\u0027ll show them. When Grace Brookstein leads me to that money, they\u0027ll be eating their words. I\u0027m close. I can feel it.\\n\\n Gavin Williams pulled an antiseptic wipe out of his briefcase and started cleaning the spot where the librarian\u0027s fingers had touched his desk. Then he closed his eyes and tried to recapture his fantasy: Grace Brookstein, at his mercy, tied up like an animal.\\n\\n It was no use. She was gone.\\n\\n \"SIR, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.\"\\n\\n Mitch leaned over the younger detective\u0027s computer screen.\\n\\n \"You asked me to do some digging on Senator Warner. This e-mail just came in from vice squad.\"\\n\\n Mitch read the e-mail.\\n\\n \"No one ever followed this up?\"\\n\\n \"It appears not, sir. Senator Warner\u0027s a big supporter of NYPD causes.\"\\n\\n I\u0027ll bet he is.\\n\\n \"This is all off-the-record. My buddy in vice was doing me a favor. I told him we\u0027d handle it sensitively.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have an address for the girl?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. It\u0027s a pretty swanky address, too.\" The detective clicked to another window. \"Do you think maybe we should send a female officer out there first? We don\u0027t want to spook her.\"\\n\\n JACK WARNER SAT IN THE BACK of his limousine, feeling the adrenaline course through his veins. Being with Jasmine again, touching her, fucking her, gorging himself on her body...it was the best feeling in the world. Knowing that the whole of America idolized him as a Christian conservative, a walking embodiment of righteous ness and family values, only added to the thrill. Jack remembered Fred Farrell\u0027s advice to him, about his gambling.\\n\\n \"I get it. It\u0027s a turn-on. All this risk. But is it as much of a turn-on as being the next president of the United States? That\u0027s what you have to ask yourself, Jack. You could lose everything.\"\\n\\n Ah, yes. But that was the thrill, wasn\u0027t it? Knowing you could lose everything. Fred Farrell knew about the gambling and the extramarital flings. But he didn\u0027t know about Jasmine. Only one person had ever known about Jasmine.\\n\\n And that person was a rotting, worm-eaten corpse by the name of Lenny Brookstein.\\n\\n JASMINE DELEVIGNE POURED TEA FROM A silver pot into two porcelain cups. She handed one of them to the policewoman.\\n\\n The officer, a nerdy, pale young woman with short black hair and thick plastic-framed glasses, looked around the sumptuous apartment and thought, I\u0027m in the wrong business.\\n\\n \"Sugar?\"\\n\\n \"Oh. No, thank you. You have a beautiful place.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. I\u0027ve worked hard for it.\" Jasmine leaned back on the Ralph Lauren suede couch and crossed her long legs demurely. \"So. You want to know about Senator Warner?\"\\n\\n When the female cop had showed up unannounced, asking questions about Jack and his relationship to Leonard Brookstein, Jasmine\u0027s first reaction was panic. Her second was loyalty. Jasmine loved Jack. She couldn\u0027t betray him. But it was her third reaction, self-interest, that eventually won the day. This could be her chance to pry Jack away from his wife at last. He only stayed with Honor because she was necessary to his political ambitions. It stood to reason that if those political ambitions were to die, then so would his marriage.\\n\\n \"How long have the two of you known each other?\"\\n\\n Jasmine took a sip of tea. \"Socially, about five years. We\u0027ve been lovers for three. Cookie?\"\\n\\n This girl\u0027s a piece of work.\\n\\n \"No, thank you. You say \u0027lovers.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. I should probably clarify. Senator Warner is a client of mine. He pays for my services.\" She spoke without a hint of shame. \"Nevertheless, I would characterize our relationship as a love match. We adore each other.\"\\n\\n \"I see. So Senator Warner confides in you?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder, did he ever talk to you about Lenny Brookstein?\"\\n\\n \"He did. Lenny knew about us. He was the only one who knew.\"\\n\\n \"Jack told him?\"\\n\\n \"No! God, no. He found out somehow. Lenny Brookstein was blackmailing Jack. He was a vicious, bullying man and he made Jack\u0027s life hell. When I heard he\u0027d killed himself, I was pleased. It couldn\u0027t have happened to a nicer guy.\"\\n\\n The policewoman sat up, startled by the girl\u0027s bluntness. Jasmine noticed the reaction.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\" She shrugged. \"I could lie about it, but I don\u0027t see the point. I hated Lenny Brookstein. Jack and I both did. He was a manipulator and a fake.\"\\n\\n \"Ms. Delevigne, in your opinion, did Senator Warner hate Lenny Brookstein enough to want to have him killed? Or to kill him himself?\"\\n\\n Jasmine smiled. The policewoman thought, Even her teeth are perfect.\\n\\n \"Did he hate him enough? Absolutely. Lenny was threatening to destroy everything Jack had ever worked for. He would force Jack to swing votes in Quorum\u0027s favor, back when they were rewriting all that hedge fund legislation, you remember?\" The policewoman nodded. \"Every time Lenny would tell Jack, \u0027This is it, one more vote and you\u0027re off the hook.\u0027 But every time he would come back for more, squeezing and squeezing.\" Jasmine shook her head angrily. \"Jack hated Lenny Brookstein with good reason. But he didn\u0027t kill him.\"\\n\\n \"You sound sure of that.\"\\n\\n \"I am sure. Jack was supposed to be out sailing that day, you see. The day of the storm, when Lenny Brookstein went missing.\"\\n\\n The policewoman looked at her notes. \"That\u0027s right. He did go sailing. The Nantucket coast guard rescued him, six miles off Sankaty Head. He returned to the Brookstein estate at around...six o\u0027clock that night.\"\\n\\n \"The coast guard didn\u0027t rescue Jack. At least, not in the way you mean.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry?\" The policewoman frowned. \"I don\u0027t follow.\"\\n\\n \"Jack never took the boat out. He was with me all day, in a beachside cottage in Siasconset. The coast guard covered for him.\"\\n\\n \"You mean the coast guard helped Senator Warner to give a false alibi? They lied?\"\\n\\n Jasmine laughed, a low, sensual vibration that brought her whole body to life. \"Don\u0027t look so shocked. It happens all the time. Senator Warner\u0027s a powerful man. People scratch Jack\u0027s back so that he\u0027ll scratch theirs. I\u0027d have thought, in your profession, you\u0027d be used to that sort of thing. I certainly am in mine.\"\\n\\n Jasmine politely showed the officer to the door. As she left, Jasmine asked her, \"So the police think Lenny Brookstein might have been murdered? I\u0027ve been following the case but I hadn\u0027t heard anything about murder.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a possibility we\u0027re considering.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that means things will come out now? About me and Jack?\" Jasmine cocked her head to one side, hopefully. The policewoman thought, So that\u0027s it. She wants people to know. She\u0027s hoping to force the senator\u0027s hand so he\u0027ll leave his wife.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Ms. Delevigne. That\u0027s not for me to say.\"\\n\\n Jasmine leaned forward conspiratorially. \"My money\u0027s on his mistress. That woman is as hard as nails.\"\\n\\n The policewoman smiled. \"I think you must be mistaken. Mr. Brookstein didn\u0027t have a mistress.\"\\n\\n \"Sure he did. Connie Gray, his sister-in-law. They were lovers till Lenny abandoned her and went crawling back to his wife. Didn\u0027t you know?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-24.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
