{"id":70043,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"AS SHE CLIMBED INTO THE VAN, the warm air hit Grace like a punch.\\n\\n Her fingers and toes throbbed painfully as her circulation began to return. It was good to be off the road, but she knew she could trust no one. How long till the news of her escape became public knowledge? Hours? A day at most. Perhaps it was on the radio already? They would issue a new Photofit...\\n\\n \"Where you headed?\"\\n\\n It was a good question. Where was she headed?\\n\\n Grace looked at the compass on the dashboard. \"North.\"\\n\\n Her \"plan,\" if you could call it that, was to meet up with Davey Buccola in three weeks\u0027 time. They had a rendezvous arranged in Manhattan - Times Square. It was Davey who had convinced Grace not to go after John Merrivale as soon as she got out. \"Don\u0027t risk blowing your cover till we know all there is to know.\" Davey was convinced he was close to proving who had killed Lenny. \"Just a few more weeks. Trust me.\" He\u0027d proposed both the time and the place of their meeting. His theory was that Times Square was so public, so obvious, no one would think to look for Grace there. \"Even if someone were to recognize you, they\u0027ll assume they made a mistake. And hopefully by then, they won\u0027t recognize you. You\u0027ll have had time to work on how you look.\"\\n\\n Grace would have liked to meet sooner, but Davey was adamant. \"Not till I have more to tell you. Till I\u0027m certain. Every meeting\u0027s a risk. We need to make it count.\"\\n\\n In the meantime, Grace would find a safe place to lie low, get her head together and, of course, start working on a decent disguise. She already looked completely different from the woman America remembered from her trial. No one who knew Grace in her glory days as the queen of Wall Street would have recognized her now. The broken nose, the dull complexion, the short, lank hair and pain-deadened eyes; they would all help protect her in the first few hours and days. But ultimately, Grace knew, they wouldn\u0027t be enough. She would have to keep changing, daily, weekly, like a chameleon.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t just her looks that had to evolve. I\u0027ll have to change on the inside, too. Successful con artists, like successful actors, learned how to become someone else. They projected a confidence, a believability, that worked better than any mask or wig or hair dye. Grace had repeated the mantra endlessly in the days leading up to her escape:\\n\\n Grace Brookstein is dead.\\n\\n My name is Lizzie Woolley.\\n\\n I\u0027m a twenty-eight-year-old architect from Wisconsin.\\n\\n \"North, huh?\"\\n\\n The driver\u0027s voice brought Grace back to reality. \"How far north?\"\\n\\n Grace hesitated.\\n\\n \"I only ask because you ain\u0027t got no case or nothing. And you look like you\u0027re dressed for Florida.\" He chuckled. Grace noticed the way he stared at her bare legs. Instinctively she crossed them, pulling her skirt lower.\\n\\n \"I left in a hurry. My...my sister\u0027s been taken ill.\"\\n\\n It was such an obvious lie, Grace blushed. The driver didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"What\u0027s your name, sweetheart?\"\\n\\n \"Lizzie.\"\\n\\n \"Pretty name. You\u0027re a real pretty girl, Lizzie. I guess you already know that, huh?\"\\n\\n Grace pulled at the top of her blouse, looking for another button to do up, but there wasn\u0027t one. This guy was giving her the creeps.\\n\\n Without warning, he swerved to the side of the road, bringing the van to a sudden halt. Grace jumped.\\n\\n \"Sorry. I gotta take a leak.\" Unclicking his seat belt, he jumped out.\\n\\n Grace watched him disappear behind the back of the van. Her mind was racing.\\n\\n Should I get out? Run? No, that was crazy. She needed a ride and she\u0027d gotten one. She\u0027d let him take her fifty miles or so, then get out near a small town somewhere. I can\u0027t afford to get spooked by every guy who hits on me. That\u0027s what men do, right? He\u0027s okay.\\n\\n Two minutes later, the driver returned. He was carrying a thermos and a Tupperware container full of sandwiches. He must have gotten them from the back of the van.\\n\\n \"Hungry?\"\\n\\n Grace\u0027s stomach gave an audible rumble. She was starving.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He turned on the ignition and pulled back onto the road. \"Well, go on, then, Lizzie. Knock yourself out. I already ate, but my wife always packs me extra.\"\\n\\n So he\u0027s married. Instantly, Grace relaxed.\\n\\n \"Thank you. Thank you very much.\"\\n\\n She started to eat.\\n\\n GRACE WOKE UP IN THE BACK of the van with her face pressed to the floor. Her wool skirt had been pushed up around her hips and her panties yanked down around her ankles. The driver was on top of her. His hand was between her legs.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Lizzie. Nice and wide now. Open up for Daddy.\"\\n\\n Grace groaned. She tried to move, but her body felt as if it were made of lead. With the added weight of the driver on top of her, it was impossible. With his free hand he forced his swollen penis inside her.\\n\\n \"No!\" Grace didn\u0027t know if she\u0027d said the word aloud or in her head. It made no difference. The man kept thrusting, deeper, harder. There was nothing frenzied about his movements, though. He was taking things slow. Enjoying himself. Grace felt his hands move upward, clawing under her bra until he found her breasts.\\n\\n \"How about those titties?\" He was whispering in her ear, taunting her. Grace could feel the prickle of his mustache against her cheek. \"You awake now, Lizzie, are you? I feel you stirring down there.\" Another thrust. \"How does it feel, baby? Is it good to get fucked? I\u0027ll bet it is. Well, don\u0027t worry, Lizzie. We got all night.\"\\n\\n He continued to rape her. Unable to move, Grace tried to think. He must have drugged me. The flask. He must have slipped something into the tea. She wondered how late it was and where they were now. Were they still near Bedford, or had hours passed? She couldn\u0027t hear any traffic.\\n\\n We\u0027re probably somewhere secluded. Woodland. Where no one will hear me scream.\\n\\n What would he do when he\u0027d finished with her? Throw her out into the woods? Kill her? Slowly the thick fog in Grace\u0027s head began to clear. In his eagerness to get inside her, the driver had left her clothes on, even her shoes.\\n\\n My shoes...\\n\\n His movements were getting faster now as he built to a climax. Grace gritted her teeth, waiting for him to come, but he suddenly stopped, pulling out of her and flipping her over onto her back like a rag doll. Looking up at his face, into those flat Asian eyes dancing with sadistic pleasure, Grace knew: He\u0027s going to kill me.\\n\\n The rape was just foreplay.\\n\\n \"Open your mouth,\" he ordered her.\\n\\n Grace lifted her legs in the air, spreading them wide then wrapping them around his back, pulling him back inside her. \"Make me.\" She gazed into his eyes, her pupils dilating with excitement.\\n\\n He smiled. \"Well, well, well. So you do like it, little Lizzie. Even better. This is going to be quite an evening.\"\\n\\n He started fucking her again, faster this time. Grace tightened her grip around his waist. Inside her left shoe she began to move her toes till she could feel Cora\u0027s stiletto.\\n\\n \"Yeah! That\u0027s it, baby!\"\\n\\n Grace felt the muscles stiffen across his shoulders and back. He started to ejaculate, then suddenly pulled out of her. Holding his grotesque, twitching penis in one hand, he knelt over her, pulling her mouth open with his other hand. Grace felt the hot spray of his semen on her tongue, down her throat. She gagged. He was laughing, closing his eyes, lost in sexual pleasure. This is it. This is my chance. Arching her back, with one single, fluid movement, Grace pulled off her shoe, grabbed the knife, flicked it open and plunged it between his shoulder blades.\\n\\n For a split second the driver remained kneeling, a look of shock and bewilderment on his face. Then he fell forward, silently, the blade still stuck in his back like the key in a windup toy. It took all of Grace\u0027s strength to wriggle out from under him and remove the knife. Blood spurted from the wound like water from a faucet.\\n\\n Grace rolled him onto his side. He was trying to talk to her, mouthing words, but all Grace could hear was a bloody gurgle. She kicked him hard in the crotch. He already looked incapacitated but you could never be too sure. After rifling his pockets for cash and anything else of value, she hurriedly pulled on her underwear and straightened her clothes, making sure she still had Karen\u0027s \"survival package\" of documents. Then she went around to the front of the van and took the car keys, as well as the thick, lumberjack jacket the man had been wearing when he picked her up.\\n\\n Ready.\\n\\n Walking back to the rear of the van, Grace opened the door. The driver was still alive, but barely. Underneath him the pool of blood was growing bigger, like a deep red puddle. When he saw the knife in Grace\u0027s hand, his eyes widened.\\n\\n \"No!\" he gurgled. \"Please...\"\\n\\n Her intention had been to finish the job. To drive the knife in to his heart, in and in and in and in, like his sick, rapist\u0027s dick, until he was dead. But watching him beg for mercy, hearing him plead so pathetically for his life, Grace changed her mind.\\n\\n Why let him die quickly? He doesn\u0027t deserve it.\\n\\n I\u0027ll leave the bastard where he is. Let him bleed to death, slowly and alone.\\n\\n Grace flipped the blade shut, turned and ran.\\n\\n IT WAS TWO HOURS BEFORE GRACE reached the outskirts of the nearest small town. The road signs proclaimed it to be Richardsville in Putnam County. Dawn was breaking, a faint strand of burnt-orange light forcing its way through the black night sky. At intervals during her long walk, she\u0027d heard the distinct, insectlike whirring of choppers overhead. They\u0027re hunting for me already. She wondered if they\u0027d found the van driver? If they were close? Adrenaline coursed through her bruised body, along with a torrent of other, conflicting emotions: Disgust. Terror. Pain. Rage. She\u0027d been raped. She could still feel the evil man inside her, hurting her, violating her. She had also just killed a man. Thinking about the fear he would feel as the life drained out of him, alone in those dreadful woods, Grace recognized another, unfamiliar emotion in the maelstrom: hatred. She was not sorry for what she\u0027d done. But all her feelings and thoughts were eclipsed by one, overriding sensation: exhaustion.\\n\\n She needed to sleep.\\n\\n The Up All Night Motel looked like something out of the opening credits of a horror movie. Out front, a flickering, cracked neon sign promised LUXURY INDIVIDUAL BATHROOMS and COLOR TV IN EVERY ROOM! Inside, the oldest man Grace had ever seen snored quietly at the reception desk. His gnarled face was crisscrossed with lines and his body looked ancient and shrunken. He reminded Grace of someone. Yoda.\\n\\n \"Excuse me.\"\\n\\n He jerked awake.\\n\\n \"Help ya?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like a room, please.\"\\n\\n Yoda looked Grace up and down. She felt her stomach turn to water. Does he recognize me? She was so nervous she was sure her teeth were chattering, though she could conceivably pass that off as cold. She\u0027d tried to make her voice sound firm and authoritative when she asked for the room, but it came out a frightened quaver. Can he see I\u0027ve been attacked? Can he smell that bastard on me? Maybe I shouldn\u0027t stay here? I should keep moving. But she knew she was too exhausted to go on.\\n\\n The old man, however, seemed more irritated than interested by her presence. After a long pause he grumbled, \"Foller me,\" and led her down a long, cheerless corridor. At the end was a numberless white door. \"This do for ya?\"\\n\\n There was a single bed, made up with cheap, polyester sheets, floral curtains and a coffee-colored carpet splattered with miscellaneous stains. In the far corner, a tiny television was nailed to the wall. Next to it, the door to the \"luxury individual bathroom\" stood open, revealing a luxury individual toilet with no seat or lid and a luxury individual shower with mold growing between the tiles.\\n\\n \"This is fine. How much do I owe you?\"\\n\\n \"How long you stayin\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\" Suddenly conscious of her disheveled appearance and the fact that she had no luggage with her, Grace blurted out, \"I had a fight with my boyfriend. I left in kind of a hurry.\"\\n\\n Yoda shrugged, bored.\\n\\n \"Twenty dollars for tonight.\"\\n\\n Grace pressed a bill into his hand and he left. Locking the door behind him, Grace drew the curtains closed. She took off all her clothes and walked into the bathroom. Only then did she sink to her knees, lean over the toilet and vomit. When her stomach was empty, she stood up and stepped into the shower. Under the weak, lukewarm jets of water, she scrubbed at herself with the used bar of soap until her skin bled. She could still feel the man\u0027s filthy hands on her breasts, his revolting, rapist\u0027s seed on her face, in her mouth. There\u0027d been two bottles of drinking water in the back of the van that she\u0027d used to clean herself up as best she could a few hours ago, so as not to arouse suspicion. On the long walk here she had forced herself to focus on the shower awaiting her, on being clean. But she knew now she would never be clean again.\\n\\n Drying herself off, she retched again, but there was nothing left inside her to throw up. She moved into the bedroom and sank down on the bed. It was warm in the room. Leaning back against the cheap foam pillow, Grace flicked on the TV. Her own face stared back at her. Or rather, her face as it had once been, long, long ago.\\n\\n So it\u0027s public already. At least they\u0027re using an old picture. I\u0027ll have to do something about a disguise first thing in the morning, before they release a new one.\\n\\n The newscaster was talking.\\n\\n \"In breaking news, Grace Brookstein is reported to have absconded from a maximum-security correctional facility in upstate New York. Brookstein, widow of the billionaire con man Leonard Brookstein...\"\\n\\n The report went on but Grace didn\u0027t hear it. She felt more tired than she could ever remember. It had been the longest twenty-four hours of her life. Sleep caressed her like the softest of cashmere blankets. She closed her eyes and let it take her.\\n\\n GAVIN WILLIAMS WAS SCREAMING.\\n\\n \"Are you blind? This is it! The breakthrough we\u0027ve been praying for. Grace will lead us straight to the money!\"\\n\\n Gavin Williams, Harry Bain and John Merrivale were having a working breakfast at Quorum\u0027s old offices. It was the morning after Grace\u0027s escape and the news was all over the TV and newspapers.\\n\\n Harry Bain shook his head. \"I doubt that. Even assuming she knows where it is...\"\\n\\n \"She knows where it is.\"\\n\\n \"Even if she does, she won\u0027t get that far. She\u0027s got the entire NYPD looking for her. My guess is she\u0027ll be back behind bars by nightfall. Either that or some trigger-happy cop will have shot her.\"\\n\\n \"No! We can\u0027t let that happen!\" It was unlike Williams to lose control, but he looked close to tears. \"Grace Brookstein remains the key to this case. We must take control. We must insist the NYPD hand the investigation over to the bureau.\"\\n\\n Harry Bain laughed. \"Oh, yeah. I\u0027ll insist. I\u0027m sure the chief of police will love that.\"\\n\\n Gavin Williams looked to John Merrivale for support. But of course John just stared at his shoes, like the coward that he was. Furious, Williams got up and stormed out.\\n\\n Merrivale said, \"I know it\u0027s not my p-place to say so. But I think perhaps the stress of this case is becoming too much for Agent Williams.\"\\n\\n Harry Bain agreed. \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m having him transferred. Grace Brookstein has become an obsession. It\u0027s clouding his judgment. Her escape is a distraction, and we can\u0027t afford distractions.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n John Merrivale breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t rest completely easily until Grace was captured. Or, better yet, shot. News of her escape had shaken him deeply. But today\u0027s meeting was reassuring. With Gavin Williams out of the picture, it would be even easier to lead Bain and his men in the wrong direction. Eventually they\u0027d run out of energy, or money, or both, and call off the investigation. Then finally he would be free. Free to leave New York, to leave Caroline. A life without chains! In the end it would all be worth it.\\n\\n \"D-do you really think they\u0027ll find her quickly?\"\\n\\n Harry Bain said, \"I\u0027m sure of it. She\u0027s Grace Brookstein, for God\u0027s sake. Where\u0027s she gonna hide?\"\\n\\n IN HER DREAMS GRACE HEARD KNOCKING, faint but rapid and insistent, like a woodpecker in the distance. The noise grew louder, closer. She woke up.\\n\\n There\u0027s someone at the door!\\n\\n Jumping out of bed, she grabbed her switchblade and wrapped the bedsheet around her, stumbling toward the sound in the darkness.\\n\\n \"Who is it?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027S me.\"\\n\\n Yoda. Grace put down the knife and opened the door a crack.\\n\\n \"You stayin\u0027 another night?\"\\n\\n The light from the corridor was blinding. Grace blinked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\\n\\n \"I said, you stayin\u0027 another night? It\u0027s noon. Changeover\u0027s twelve thirty. You ain\u0027t staying, you gotta vacate the room by then.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. No. I\u0027m staying.\"\\n\\n \"Twenty dollars.\"\\n\\n Grace pulled a second bill out of the wad Karen had given her and handed it to the old man. He took it wordlessly, scuttling back to his reception desk like a decrepit beetle.\\n\\n Twelve o\u0027clock! Jesus. I must have been out like a light. Grace opened the curtains, then closed them again. Far too bright. Splashing cold water on her face, she pulled on her clothes - they stank of that bastard but they were all she had. She would buy new ones today. The TV was still on from last night. Grace turned up the volume. This time the news report was on the economy. But a few moments later her face was back on-screen again, this time a mug shot from the day they brought her to Bedford. It still looks nothing like me.\\n\\n The anchorwoman was talking. \"With Grace Brookstein now missing for over seventeen hours, the police appear to have no concrete leads. With me is Detective Mitchell Connors of the NYPD, the man leading the investigation into Brookstein\u0027s escape. Detective, people are already saying that you and your men are running out of ideas. Do you feel that\u0027s a fair statement?\"\\n\\n An attractive blond cop responded by video link.\\n\\n \"No, Nancy, I don\u0027t believe it is. We\u0027re pursuing a number of different avenues. This investigation is only hours old. It\u0027s our belief that the prisoner will be apprehended swiftly and we\u0027re working toward that conclusion.\"\\n\\n Grace studied the cop\u0027s face. Detective Mitchell Connors looked like he\u0027d been sketched by a cartoonist at Marvel Comics, all square jaw and steady, blue-eyed gaze. Physically he reminded Grace of a rougher-around-the-edges version of her brother-in-law Jack Warner. But his expression was nothing like Jack\u0027s. If anything, it was more like Lenny\u0027s. It\u0027s his eyes. He has kind eyes.\\n\\n He was still talking. \"Grace Brookstein and her husband brought extraordinary suffering to thousands of people, particularly here in New York. Believe me, Nancy, no one wants to see this convicted felon back behind bars more than I do. Make no mistake. We will find her.\"\\n\\n Grace switched off the television.\\n\\n Detective Connors might have kind eyes, but he\u0027s my enemy.\\n\\n She mustn\u0027t forget it.\\n\\n THAT AFTERNOON, GRACE WALKED INTO TOWN. It was all she could do to stop her teeth from chattering, knowing that her face was all over the news, that at any moment, someone might recognize her and turn her in to the authorities. But she couldn\u0027t hide out at the motel forever. She needed supplies, and she needed to get out of Richardsville. Karen and Cora had both warned her of the dangers of staying in one place too long.\\n\\n With the van driver\u0027s bulky jacket pulled tightly around her, Grace kept her head down as she walked the aisles of a Walmart. At the checkout, her heart was pounding so violently she thought she might faint. Happily the sullen teenager manning the register seemed more interested in the chip on one of her acrylic nails than in the nervous customer or her purchases.\\n\\n \"Eighty-eight dollazs yer total; cash \u0027r credit?\"\\n\\n \"Cash.\"\\n\\n \"Thangshaveaniceday.\"\\n\\n The girl didn\u0027t even look up.\\n\\n By the time Grace returned to her room at the Up All Night, it was almost four P.M. Locking the door, she emptied her Walmart bags onto the bed: hair dye, scissors, makeup, disinfectant, underwear, a three-pack of Haines T-shirts, jeans, a beanie hat, and a gray carry-all gym bag.\\n\\n She got to work.\\n\\n THE OLD MAN AT THE RECEPTION desk studied the picture in his newspaper. His eyes weren\u0027t what they used to be.\\n\\n Could it be?\\n\\n This girl\u0027s nose was different. And the hair. Still, there was definitely a resemblance. And she had arrived in the middle of the night, with no suitcase. He looked at the paper again. The cop on the TV said to report anything suspicious, no matter how trivial.\\n\\n The old man picked up the phone.\\n\\n GRACE LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE cracked bathroom mirror. Except it wasn\u0027t herself. It was someone else, the first of her four new identities. Lizzie Woolley.\\n\\n Hello, Lizzie.\\n\\n Carefully cleaning up all traces of dye and picking every lock of severed hair off the floor, Grace dropped them into the empty Walmart bag along with the discarded bottle of Nice \u0027n Easy and her old clothes, tied the bag by the handles and stuffed it into her carry-all. She dressed quickly. The clean clothes felt wonderful. For a moment Grace thought back to her old life and smiled. She could never have imagined back then that the day would come when a pair of Walmart jeans would feel like the last word in luxury! She\u0027d already spent two-thirds of the cash Karen and Cora had given her. Pretty soon she would have to make e-mail contact with Karen\u0027s mysterious \"friend\" and ask for more. Cora had assured her that getting cash from Western Union was anonymous and easy. All you had to do was show up at one of their hundreds of thousands of locations, show your (fake) ID and take the money. \"It\u0027s how every illegal immigrant in this country makes rent, honey. It\u0027s their business not to ask questions.\" Even so, Grace hoped she wouldn\u0027t have to do it too often.\\n\\n She\u0027d checked the bus timetable earlier. The next bus to the city left at 6:15 P.M.\\n\\n Plenty of time.\\n\\n THE OLD MAN KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.\\n\\n No answer. Officer McInley, Richardsville\u0027s finest - Richardsville\u0027s only - looked pissed. \"I thought you said she was definitely here?\"\\n\\n Officer McInley knew the minute Old Man Murdoch called that it\u0027d be some stupid-ass wild-goose chase. Grace Brookstein, staying at the Up All Night? Yeah, right. She was probably sharing a room with Kermit the Frog and Herman Munster. Everyone in Richardsville knew that Murdoch had lost his marbles years ago.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s here, all right? Saw her come in wi\u0027 my own two eyes and she ain\u0027t come out again. Muz be sleepin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Unhooking the master key from his belt loop, the old man unlocked the door.\\n\\n \"Miss?\"\\n\\n The room was empty. Not just empty but pristine. The bed was made, the surfaces wiped clean. It looked as if no one had stayed there in weeks.\\n\\n Officer McInley rolled his eyes.\\n\\n \"She wuz here, I tell ya! Last two nights. I swear to God. Musta \u0027scaped out the winda.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\" On a flying monkey. \"Well, if you see her again, you be sure and let us know.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-17.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
