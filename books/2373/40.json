{"id":70066,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"NEW YORK, ONE MONTH LATER\n THE WOMAN IN THE HOSPITAL WAITING room whispered to her daughter.\n \"Is it her?\"\n The daughter shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Normally she wouldn\u0027t have been so hesitant. She was a great one for all the gossip magazines and prided herself on being able to spot a celebrity from fifty yards. Sunglasses and head scarves didn\u0027t fool her. But in this case...The woman did look a bit like her. A lot like her, if you broke down her face feature by feature. The cupid\u0027s-bow lips, the childlike dimple in the chin, the wide-set eyes and the delicate line of the nose. Yet somehow, put them all together, and her face looked...less. Less beautiful, less striking, less special. Combine this effect with the woman\u0027s drab clothes, the gray wool skirt and simple white blouse, and...no. No, it wasn\u0027t her.\n \"Mrs. Richards?\"\n The girl\u0027s mother looked up. \"Yes?\"\n \"You can go in now. Your husband\u0027s awake.\"\n Mother and daughter filed out of the waiting room. As they passed the look-alike woman, both stole surreptitious glances. Close up she looked even smaller. It was almost as if she projected anonymity, the same way that other people, stars, gave off charisma or sex appeal. \"Poor thing,\" said the mother. \"She\u0027s like a little mouse. I wonder who she\u0027s visiting?\"\n GRACE WAS GLAD WHEN THE WOMEN LEFT. It was still only seven in the morning. She\u0027d expected, and hoped, to find the waiting room empty. It was getting harder to be around people. Any people. Soon she would leave America for good. Find somewhere peaceful, a retreat where nobody knew or cared about her past. A monastery perhaps, in Spain or Greece, if they\u0027d have her. They\u0027ll have me. That\u0027s what they do, isn\u0027t it? Offer sanctuary to sinners, to criminals and the poor. I qualify on all three counts. According to her new lawyer, she\u0027d be entitled to federal compensation eventually. \"It could be a considerable sum of money. Not as much as you\u0027ve been used to, perhaps, but certainly seven figures.\"\n Grace wasn\u0027t interested. Whatever the government gave her, she would send directly to Karen Willis and Cora Budds. She owed them her freedom, a debt that no amount of money could hope to repay. Besides, Grace had no use for money. All she wanted was to get away. But she couldn\u0027t leave yet. Not till she knew he was all right. Not till she had a chance to explain.\n She touched the scar on her arm, from where the bullet had sliced into her. She had four similar scars, all on her right side, on her leg, hip and shoulder. Lucky to be alive, that\u0027s what the doctors said. And Grace had smiled and wondered, Am I? Am I lucky? It was amazing how quickly the body could heal. But the spirit was not so resilient.\n Without Lenny, Grace Brookstein no longer knew what she was living for.\n THE STORY OF THE SHOOT-OUT AT Le Cocon, and the sensational killing of John Merrivale and capture of Lenny Brookstein, had gripped the entire world. The Madagascan authorities made a token effort to prevent the Americans from flying Lenny back to the United States, but a personal phone call from the president, along with some promises of substantial U.S. investment in various Madagascan infrastructure projects, swiftly changed their minds.\n Harry Bain briefed the local press. \"Mr. Brookstein is returning to his home country of his own free will for urgent medical treatment. Once he recovers - if he recovers - his future will be determined by the U.S. Justice Department.\" It was Bain who\u0027d gotten hold of the local police and sent reinforcements to Le Cocon that day. Once he finally heard Mitch\u0027s messages, he got right on the phone to the chief of police in Antananarivo and filled him in on everything.\n \"It would have helped if you\u0027d been honest with us about your presence in Madagascar in the first place,\" the police chief said stiffly. \"We could have helped.\" Harry Bain had had to grovel to get him to agree to send men up to the estate. But thank God he had. By the time they got there, Lenny Brookstein had been shot in the stomach and groin. Had Grace aimed a little higher, she would have severed his coronary artery and robbed America of its most sensationalistic and shocking trial since...well, since her own. As it was, after extensive surgery, Lenny survived. Before he knew where he was, the FBI had him heavily sedated and shipped back home on a military plane. It was over before you could say \"human-rights violation,\" never mind \"miscarriage of justice.\"\n For two weeks it was unclear whether Mitch Connors would be so lucky. His life hung in the balance. Grace was terrified that it was a stray bullet of hers that had lodged itself in Mitch\u0027s spine, but the cops assured her it was John Merrivale who had almost killed him. When the police showed up, they screamed at him to drop his weapon but John continued firing indiscriminately, at Grace and at them. They\u0027d had no choice but to take him out.\n At first Grace was happy when she heard John was dead. But as the weeks passed, her happiness faded. What did it matter? What did any of it matter: John\u0027s death, Lenny\u0027s trial (for fraud and murder) and sentence of death by lethal injection, her own presidential pardon? None of it was going to bring her old life back, or help the people who\u0027d been ruined by Quorum. None of it was going to make Mitch Connors get well, or bring Maria Preston, or Andrew, or that poor homeless soul from Nantucket back to life. The whole thing was so utterly, utterly pointless. Justice had become a mere word, letters on a page, empty of meaning. There could be no justice, no closure, no satisfying ending. The whole thing was a farce, a game. Grace herself had been pardoned, not because she was innocent, but because it was too much of an embarrassment for the authorities to admit she\u0027d escaped from custody twice, and that it was she, not they, who had found Lenny and uncovered the truth about the Quorum fraud.\n \"I am convinced that Mrs. Brookstein was as much a victim of her husband\u0027s duplicity as the millions of others who suffered at his hands,\" said the president. And America applauded. \"Of course she was. Poor thing.\" They had their villain now, their pound of flesh. Lenny Brookstein was being sent to Super Max in Colorado, the toughest prison in the land, home to the most dangerous Islamic terrorists and deranged child killers. The play was in its third act, and suddenly there was a vacancy for a convincing tragic heroine. Who better to fill it than Grace? After all, the show must go on.\n A nurse tapped Grace on the shoulder.\n \"Good news. He\u0027s awake. Would you like to go in?\"\n MITCH LOOKED PALE AND THIN. HORRIBLY THIN. Grace tried not to look shocked. He must have lost forty pounds. When he saw her, he smiled.\n \"Hello, stranger.\"\n \"Hello.\"\n There was so much to say, but in that moment Grace couldn\u0027t think of a single word. Instead she took Mitch\u0027s hand in hers and gently stroked it.\n \"They told me you testified against Lenny at the trial.\"\n \"Yes. I didn\u0027t have to go in person. They let me give a statement.\"\n \"He got the death penalty?\"\n She nodded.\n \"So your testimony must have helped.\"\n \"I doubt it. He admitted everything anyway. Once they knew about the murder, the die was cast. I think he wanted people to know how clever he\u0027d been. He didn\u0027t seem upset at the trial. It was almost as if he were enjoying himself.\"\n Mitch shook his head in disbelief. \"He still doesn\u0027t see himself as guilty, does he?\"\n \"Not in the least.\" She paused. \"They\u0027re executing him today, you know. He waived all his rights to appeal.\"\n For a few minutes they were both silent. Then Mitch said, \"I know this is going to sound like a ridiculous question. But do you still have any feelings for him? Knowing, you know, that he\u0027s going to die. Does it upset you?\"\n \"Not really.\" Grace looked thoughtful. \"It\u0027s not so much that I have no feelings for him. It\u0027s more that I have no feelings, period. I\u0027m numb.\"\n Mitch squeezed her hand. \"It takes time, that\u0027s all. You\u0027ve been through so much.\"\n \"To tell you the truth, I don\u0027t know if I want to feel anymore. I want peace.\"\n She stared out the window. It was late May, and spring was in its last glorious flush, the trees on the sidewalk exploding with blossoms, the blue skies alive with birdsong and joy. Grace thought, I\u0027m happy that life goes on, that it\u0027s beautiful. But I can\u0027t be part of it anymore.\n \"Do you know who called me the other day?\"\n Mitch shook his head. \"Who?\"\n \"Honor. The FBI told her about Jack and Jasmine. He\u0027s decided not to seek another term as senator. They\u0027re getting a divorce.\"\n \"She called you to tell you this?\"\n Grace laughed. \"I know. As if we could pick up where we left off. That\u0027s actually what she said to me. \u0027Can\u0027t we be sisters again?\u0027 Connie and Mike moved to Europe, so I guess she feels alone. Lenny said something similar actually, in the garden at Le Cocon. He thought I was going to stay there with him and John. That the three of us could hide out in Madagascar together and live happily ever after. \u0027Like old times,\u0027 that\u0027s what he said.\"\n \"Are you kidding me?\" Mitch\u0027s eyes widened. \"What did you say?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t say anything. I shot him.\" Grace grinned, and Mitch remembered everything he loved about her. She thinks she\u0027s dead inside but she\u0027s not. She\u0027s just hibernating.\n Grace stood up and moved toward the window. Mitch watched her, her graceful dancer\u0027s walk, the fluid ballet of her limbs. While he was the cop and she was the fugitive, he\u0027d forced himself to keep a lid on his feelings. Now that it was all over, he could no longer hold them back. Longing hit him like a punch to the stomach.\n I love her.\n I want her.\n I can make her happy.\n \"What?\" Grace turned around and stared at him accusingly.\n Mitch blushed. Had he spoken aloud? He must have. He propped himself up higher on the pillows. \"I\u0027m in love with you, Grace. I\u0027m sorry if that complicates things. But I am.\"\n Grace\u0027s face softened. She was fond of Mitch, after all. And he had risked his life to try to save hers. There was no reason to be angry with him. But love? No. She couldn\u0027t love again. Not after Lenny. Love was a fantasy. It didn\u0027t exist.\n Mitch said, \"I think we should get married.\"\n Grace laughed out loud. \"Married?\"\n \"Yes. Why not?\"\n Why not? Grace thought about Lenny. About their beautiful wedding on Nantucket, her happiness as a young bride, her hopes and dreams. They hadn\u0027t just been crushed. They\u0027d been incinerated, annihilated, scorched to dust and ashes along with the trusting, happy girl she had once been.\n By nightfall, Lenny would be dead.\n Grace could no more marry again than fly to the moon.\n \"I will never get married again, Mitch. Never.\"\n Hearing her say the words, Mitch knew she meant them.\n \"I\u0027m leaving.\"\n Mitch felt his stomach lurch. Panic gripped him. \"Leaving? What do you mean leaving? Leaving where? Leaving the room?\"\n \"Leaving the country.\"\n \"No you\u0027re not. You can\u0027t!\"\n \"I have to.\"\n \"But why? Where would you go?\"\n Leaning forward, Grace kissed him, just once, on the lips. It was a short kiss, not sexual, but loving, almost maternal. It made Mitch want to cry.\n \"I don\u0027t know where I\u0027ll go. Somewhere quiet and remote. Somewhere where I can live simply and in peace.\"\n \"This is bullshit. You can live simply with me.\" He took her face in his hands, willing her to listen to him, to love him, to let herself believe he loved her. \"I can do simple. You want simple, you should see my apartment. It\u0027s so simple they repossessed my furniture.\"\n Despite herself, Grace smiled. It was a tiny chink in her armor. Mitch jumped on it.\n \"You like that? Hell, if simple\u0027s what you\u0027re into, I\u0027m your guy. I can even do flat broke. Cold Domino\u0027s pizza for breakfast? You got it. With a little more effort I can probably get them to cut off the electricity. We could sit in the dark under a blanket and hum.\"\n \"Stop it.\" Grace giggled.\n Mitch brought her hand to his lips, kissing each of her fingers in turn. \"I tell you what. I\u0027ll forget about marriage if you forget about leaving the country. Just...say you\u0027ll have dinner with me when they let me out of here.\"\n Grace hesitated.\n \"C\u0027mon! One lousy dinner. You owe me that much at least.\"\n It was true. She did owe him.\n \"All right. One dinner. But I can\u0027t promise you anything.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-40.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: \n Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
