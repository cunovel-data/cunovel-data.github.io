{"id":70047,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"DAVEY BUCCOLA PACED HIS HOTEL ROOM like a caged tiger. His suite at the Paramount on Times Square was luxurious. Frette bed linen, sleek modern furniture, $500 cashmere blankets draped casually over the back of the armchair. Davey thought, This\u0027d be an impressive place to bring a woman.\\n\\n Unfortunately, he wasn\u0027t with a woman. He was with a bunch of cops. And they were starting to make him nervous.\\n\\n \"Stand still, please, Mr. Buccola. We need to check your wire.\"\\n\\n Davey lit a cigarette, his third in as many minutes.\\n\\n \"Again?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Again.\" Mitch Connors was in a pissy mood. \"You want to see that two hundred grand, Mr. Buccola, I suggest you cooperate.\"\\n\\n Davey thought, He\u0027s probably nervous, too. Doesn\u0027t want anything to go wrong.\\n\\n Davey felt bad, doing the dirty on Grace Brookstein. He\u0027d always liked her. What\u0027s more, he was convinced she was innocent of the crimes she\u0027d been convicted of. But $200,000...two hundred thousand... He tried to rationalize the decision to himself. He was protecting Grace. This way she would be captured unharmed. He hadn\u0027t told Connors or any of the cops about the information he\u0027d uncovered, either. Later, once Grace was safe, he\u0027d use it to launch an appeal against her conviction and reopen the inquest into Lenny\u0027s death. Either that or sell it. What would Vanity Fair pay for a scoop like this? If he was lucky, he might double his reward money!\\n\\n Of course, deep down, Davey Buccola knew the truth. He was betraying an innocent woman for money, the same way everybody else had betrayed her. It wasn\u0027t $200,000. It was thirty pieces of silver.\\n\\n \"Mr. Buccola. Are you with us?\"\\n\\n Davey looked up, startled. Mitch Connors was shouting at him again.\\n\\n \"We only have an hour. Let\u0027s run through the plan one more time.\"\\n\\n GRACE DIPPED HER DOUGHNUT INTO THE hot black coffee and took a big, satisfying bite.\\n\\n Delicious.\\n\\n She and Lenny used to have the finest chefs on staff at all their homes, ready to prepare lobster Thermidor or whip up a Gruyere souffle at any hour of the day or night. But not until this week had Grace tasted a Dunkin\u0027 Donut. She couldn\u0027t imagine how she\u0027d ever lived without them.\\n\\n The week had been full of new experiences. The familiarity she felt when she first came back to New York had been replaced by a sort of delighted wonder. It was the same city she\u0027d lived in, on and off, for her entire life. And yet it was completely different. This New York, the New York of the ordinary people, of the poor, was like another planet to Grace, with its subway trains, its dirty buses, its doughnut shops, its walk-ups and shared bathrooms and television sets with wire coat hangers jammed into the top. Lenny had always told Grace it was terrible to be poor. \"Poverty is the most degrading, most soul-destroying state into which the human soul can sink.\" Grace disagreed. True, she had never been poor before, but then Lenny had never been to prison. Grace had. She knew what \"soul-destroying\" meant. She knew what it was to be degraded, to be robbed of one\u0027s humanity. Poverty didn\u0027t come close.\\n\\n By all objective standards, the hotel in Queens where Grace had been staying was a dump - dirty, cramped, with depressing mustard-colored walls and linoleum floors. But Grace had come to enjoy the smells of fried onions wafting up from the hot-dog stand outside her window, and the ridiculous arguments between the couple across the hall. It made her feel less alone. As if she were part of something.\\n\\n Getting dressed this morning, preparing for her meeting with Davey, she actually thought, I\u0027ll be sorry to leave here. But she knew she couldn\u0027t stay. For one thing, it wasn\u0027t safe. She had to keep moving. More important, the time had come to begin her mission. Armed with Davey\u0027s information, she could at last begin her journey. Today, her vengeance would take flight.\\n\\n She had dressed simply for their rendezvous. Jeans, sneakers, a black polo-neck sweater and a down jacket, her beanie hat pulled low over her newly darkened hair. The jeans already felt a little tighter on the waist than they had in Richardsville. Grace was gaining weight, a side effect of her newfound doughnut addiction. Swallowing the dregs of her coffee, she looked at her watch. Eleven o\u0027clock.\\n\\n She headed for the subway.\\n\\n MITCH CONNORS HADN\u0027T SLEPT. THE PLAN was simple. Davey had arranged to meet Grace at noon exactly, in front of Toys \"R\" Us on Times Square. At that time of day the New York landmark should be crawling with shoppers looking for a bargain in the winter sales, as well as the usual backpack-laden hordes of tourists. Mitch had positioned two men behind Davey, inside the store, another two at the entrance to the subway and six more scattered throughout the crowd. All ten would be in plainclothes, wired and armed. Mitch wasn\u0027t expecting any trouble, but after the way Grace had dealt with that scumbag Tommy Burns, he wasn\u0027t taking any chances. As soon as Davey saw Grace in the crowd, he would use his hidden mike to alert the cops, who would close in around her. Once she reached Davey and shook his hand, that was the signal to move in and grab her. Easy.\\n\\n Mitch himself would be watching the proceedings from the Paramount Hotel. His face had been all over the news for weeks. If Grace saw him, she\u0027d know something was up.\\n\\n Davey Buccola lit another cigarette. Eleven forty-five. Time to go downstairs. Davey looked on in alarm as one of the cops checked his gun before slipping it back into the holster under his jacket.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that for? You aren\u0027t going to hurt her, are you?\"\\n\\n The cop looked at Davey like something he\u0027d just scraped off of his shoe. He\u0027d given them good information but he was a snitch. Nobody liked a snitch. \"I\u0027m sure Mrs. Brookstein would be touched by your concern. Are you ready?\"\\n\\n Davey nodded. Two hundred grand. My own place.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready. Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n TEN TO TWELVE.\\n\\n \"Do you see her?\"\\n\\n Davey Buccola stamped his feet against the cold. Resisting the urge to put his hand to his ear - he hated wires - he murmured, \"Negative. Not yet.\"\\n\\n Times Square was even more crowded than he\u0027d expected. Toys \"R\" Us was jammed. Half of New York was out of work, but people would rather starve than see their kids go without the latest Hannah Montana doll or Special Agent Oso flashlight. Sad, really, Davey reflected.\\n\\n THE WOMAN OPPOSITE GRACE WAS STARING. Grace felt her stomach flip over.\\n\\n \"Hey.\"\\n\\n The train was crowded, but no one was talking. The woman\u0027s voice rang out like a foghorn.\\n\\n \"Hey! I\u0027m talking to you.\"\\n\\n Grace looked up. She felt the blood rush to her face. She recognizes me. Oh God. She\u0027s going to say something. They\u0027ll turn on me. The whole train will turn on me, they\u0027ll rip me to shreds!\\n\\n \"You done with your paper?\"\\n\\n Paper? Grace looked down. There was a New York Post in her lap. She had no idea how it had gotten there. Wordlessly, she handed it over.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n Suddenly the train jerked to a halt. The lights flickered, then went out. Everybody groaned. The lights came on again. Grace looked at her watch. Five to twelve.\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" the man next to her said genially. \"Wherever you\u0027re going, you\u0027re going to be late.\"\\n\\n A voice came over the address system. \"We apologize for the inconvenience. Due to some electrical problems, we expect a short delay.\"\\n\\n No! Not today. Why today?\\n\\n Grace took a deep breath. She couldn\u0027t draw attention to herself by appearing jittery. Besides, it was okay. They said a short delay. Davey would wait.\\n\\n AS HE STARED OUT OF THE window Mitch\u0027s heart sank.\\n\\n She\u0027s not coming.\\n\\n He\u0027d been so sure this was it. So certain. The clock on the wall taunted him. Ten after twelve. What could have gone wrong? Had Buccola had a change of heart and tipped her off? Had Grace realized she couldn\u0027t trust him? Or maybe it was worse than that. Maybe something had happened to her. An accident. Someone had recognized her and taken the law into his own hands.\\n\\n \"I think I see her.\"\\n\\n Buccola\u0027s voice sounded crackly in Mitch\u0027s earpiece.\\n\\n \"You think? Don\u0027t you know?\"\\n\\n Buccola didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \"Well, where?\" Mitch couldn\u0027t hide his excitement.\\n\\n \"She just came out of the subway. I didn\u0027t get a good look at her face. It might not be her.\"\\n\\n \"Danny, Luca. Did you guys see anything?\"\\n\\n Two of Mitch\u0027s men were right outside the subway, checking out every woman who emerged.\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n Jesus. \"What was she wearing, Davey?\"\\n\\n \"Jeans. Dark coat. A hat...I think. Shit.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I lost her.\"\\n\\n \"You lost her? Well, was she heading toward you? Did she see you?\"\\n\\n \"Forget it. It wasn\u0027t her.\"\\n\\n GRACE DARTED OUT OF THE SUBWAY onto the street. She was late. Very late. Would Davey have waited this long? God, she hoped so. He was taking a big risk agreeing to meet her at all.\\n\\n She pushed forward into the crowds, head down. The multicolored lettering of the Toys \"R\" Us store called to her from across the square. Grace headed toward it, scanning the throng for her friend\u0027s familiar face.\\n\\n OFFICER LUCA BONNETTI WAS DISAPPOINTED. SO much for being part of the big show. Grace Brookstein had obviously made other plans.\\n\\n Still, getting paid to eye up women wasn\u0027t the worst way to spend a morning. A cute brunette in a hurry brushed past him.\\n\\n \"Hey, babe. How you doin\u0027?\"\\n\\n He tapped her on the ass, but she hurried on.\\n\\n \"What is your problem, Bonnetti?\" His partner was mad. \"We\u0027re supposed to be looking for America\u0027s most wanted, not harassing members of the public.\"\\n\\n \"Aw, lighten up, Danny. She was cute. And in case you haven\u0027t figured it out, Lady Brookstein ain\u0027t coming.\"\\n\\n GRACE\u0027S HEART WAS POUNDING. ASSHOLE.\\n\\n After what that bastard van driver had done to her, the thought of a man touching her or even looking at her sexually made her want to scream at the top of her lungs. But she couldn\u0027t scream. She couldn\u0027t stop and yell at the guy to get his stinking hands off of her. She had to be invisible, to melt into the crowd.\\n\\n Where the hell is Davey?\\n\\n Just as she thought the words, she saw him. He was standing a few feet in front of the store. She walked toward him, smiling. Sensing her smile, Davey looked up. That\u0027s when Grace noticed.\\n\\n \"IT\u0027S HER! I SEE HER. SHE\u0027S heading over. Jeans, dark jacket. Beanie.\"\\n\\n Mitch asked the cops in the square, \"Have you got her?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. We see her. Closing in.\"\\n\\n GRACE\u0027S MIND RACED.\\n\\n He said he\u0027d have the file with him. The evidence. Why didn\u0027t he bring it?\\n\\n Something was wrong. It wasn\u0027t just the file. It was Davey\u0027s face. It had guilt written all over it. Just then, two men brushed past Grace, heading toward Toys \"R\" Us. Some sixth sense made her slow her pace.\\n\\n Cops. It\u0027s a setup.\\n\\n There was no time to think. Acting on instinct, she whipped off her hat and stuffed it into her coat pocket. A group of foreign schoolchildren was heading in the opposite direction, back toward the subway. Grace slipped in among them, another small dark fish entering the safety of the shoal.\\n\\n THE MEN CLUTCHED AT THEIR EARPIECES. Up in the hotel room, Mitch Connors was yelling bloody murder.\\n\\n \"Where is she? WHERE IS SHE?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Davey Buccola was confused. \"She was coming right for me and then she...she disappeared.\"\\n\\n Mitch could have wept.\\n\\n \"Spread out, all of you. Keep looking. She\u0027s in that crowd.\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t take it any longer. He ran out of the hotel room and headed for the stairs.\\n\\n FROM THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE Paramount, Mitch had had a bird\u0027s-eye view of the square below. Now, running outside at street level, he could barely see three feet in front of his nose. There were people everywhere, jostling their bulky shopping bags, pushing their kids\u0027 strollers across his path.\\n\\n Jeans, dark jacket, beanie hat. She\u0027s here. She must be.\\n\\n He pushed into the heaving mass of bodies.\\n\\n GRACE WAS ALMOST AT THE SUBWAY. The stone steps beckoned her, promising safety, escape. Just a few more seconds. A few more steps!\\n\\n She glanced to her right. A man in a Yankees cap was looking around him frantically, muttering to himself. One of the cops. How many are there? The man was heading straight for Grace\u0027s group. Now he was stopping their tour guide, asking him something. I have to break away.\\n\\n Suddenly Grace saw the sleazeball who had pawed her earlier. He was still hanging around the entrance to the subway. On closer inspection she could see he was a young Italian, attractive, if you liked assholes. Not that Grace would have cared if he looked like Quasimodo. She walked in his direction.\\n\\n MITCH HELD HIS BREATH. There she is! The crowd moved almost imperceptibly and he saw her, not fifteen feet away from where he was standing. She was tiny, maybe five feet tall, in jeans and a dark coat and she had almost reached the subway. Mitch broke into a run.\\n\\n \"Hey, buddy! Look where you\u0027re going.\"\\n\\n \"Slow down, jerk.\"\\n\\n Mitch ran on blindly, knocking pedestrians off their feet. As Grace reached the steps Mitch made a lunge for her, rugby-tackling her to the ground, facedown. She screamed but it was too late. Blood gushed from her nose. Mitch snapped a pair of handcuffs on her wrists. It was over.\\n\\n \"Grace Brookstein, you\u0027re under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.\" Turning her over, he pulled the beanie hat up to get a better look at her face. \"Oh Jesus.\"\\n\\n A terrified blonde stared back at him.\\n\\n Mitch had never seen her before in his life.\\n\\n LUCA BONNETTI COULDN\u0027T BELIEVE HIS LUCK.\\n\\n \"Hey, sexy. You\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m back.\" The gorgeous brunette stood up on tiptoes, wrapped her arms around his neck and started kissing him passionately. Luca returned the favor. This time he got both hands on her ass.\\n\\n Out of the corner of her eye, Grace saw the cop with the Yankee hat, still talking to the tour guide. He\u0027s probably describing me. If she looked like she were part of a couple, it would throw them off the scent. This bozo could be her cover till she got safely on a train. Then she\u0027d jump off at the next station and lose him.\\n\\n She broke off the kiss and smiled at him. \"Wanna take a ride with me?\"\\n\\n Luca grinned. \"Do I ever!\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s busy.\" Another man, older, with a thick, salt-and-pepper mustache, had appeared out of nowhere and looked daggers at Grace. \"He\u0027s busy.\"\\n\\n Luca Bonnetti protested. \"No, I\u0027m not. Give me a break, Danny, would you?\"\\n\\n \"Give you a break?\" The man turned to Grace. \"Look, lady, we\u0027re NYPD and we\u0027re on a job. So get the hell out of here before I book you for soliciting.\"\\n\\n Grace felt the bile rise up in her throat. He\u0027s one of them. Her legs started to shake. She ran.\\n\\n IT TOOK MITCH A FEW MOMENTS to react.\\n\\n He was apologizing to the young woman whose nose he\u0027d just broken when the girl tore past him, two steps at a time. Turning back to the woman, Mitch started removing her handcuffs when he saw it: a gray woolen beanie hat sticking out of the girl\u0027s coat pocket.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" he yelled. \"Police!\"\\n\\n GRACE WAS ON THE PLATFORM. BEHIND her, she could hear the shouting.\\n\\n \"Police! Let me through!\"\\n\\n The train was packed. Grace tried to force her way into a car but a man pushed her back. \"Use your eyes, lady. There\u0027s no room here. Move down.\"\\n\\n \"Police!\"\\n\\n The shouts were getting louder. Grace looked back over her shoulder. It was him. Detective Connors. She recognized his face from the TV reports.\\n\\n The next car was also full. People had started moving back, waiting for the next train. There was no space on this one. The electric doors whooshed shut. It was too late. The train started to move away.\\n\\n \"Grace Brookstein! Stay where you are. You\u0027re under arrest!\"\\n\\n Grace heard her name. So did everybody else. Suddenly hundreds of pairs of eyes were swiveling around, scanning the platform. Grace Brookstein? Where? Is she here?\\n\\n Mitch Connors was sprinting along the platform, faster than the train. He ran past the first car. Then the second. As he reached the third the crowds parted. Mitch and Grace were face-to-face.\\n\\n Grace looked into Mitch\u0027s eyes and Mitch looked into hers. The hunter and the prey. For a moment something passed between them. Mutual respect. Affection, even. But only for a moment.\\n\\n The train was gaining speed. Safe in the warmth of the carriage, Grace turned away from the window.\\n\\n Mitch Connors stood on the platform and watched her disappear into the dark oblivion of the tunnel.\\n\\n BACK AT THE STATION, LIEUTENANT DUBRAY lost it.\\n\\n \"What the fuck? How could you lose her like that? How?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" Mitch sighed.\\n\\n He tried to look on the bright side. They knew more than they did forty-eight hours ago. They knew Grace was still in New York. They knew she was a brunette now and that she\u0027d gained weight. Tomorrow they\u0027d issue a new Photofit picture to the media.\\n\\n Thanks to Luca Bonnetti, the NYPD\u0027s crack surveillance team had managed to gather one other new piece of information.\\n\\n America\u0027s most wanted woman was a terrific kisser. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-21.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
