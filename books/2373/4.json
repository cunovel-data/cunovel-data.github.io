{"id":70030,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"SENATOR JACK WARNER WOKE UP ON Saturday morning with a crushing hangover. Honor had left early for her yoga class. Downstairs, in the playroom of their idyllic Westchester County farmhouse, Jack Warner could hear his daughters, Bobby and Rose, screaming blue murder at each other.\n What the fuck is Ilse doing?\n The family\u0027s new Dutch au pair gave an excellent blow job, but her nannying skills left much to be desired. So far Jack had resisted Honor\u0027s requests to be allowed to fire Ilse. But this morning, he changed his mind. An uninterrupted Saturday morning in bed was worth much more than a good blow job. In Senator Jack Warner\u0027s world, good blow jobs were easy to come by. Peace and quiet, on the other hand, were priceless.\n Jack Warner first knew he wanted to become president of the United States when he was three years old. It was August 1974. His parents were watching Richard Nixon\u0027s resignation on television.\n \"What\u0027s that man doing?\" little Jack asked his mother. It was his father who answered.\n \"He\u0027s leaving the best job in the world, son. He\u0027s a liar and a fool.\"\n Jack thought about this for a minute.\n \"If he\u0027s a fool, how did he get the best job in the world?\"\n His father laughed. \"That\u0027s a good question!\"\n \"Who\u0027s going to do his job now?\"\n \"Why d\u0027you ask, Jacko?\" Jack\u0027s father pulled him up onto his lap and ruffled his hair affectionately. \"Do you want it?\"\n Yes, thought Jack. If it\u0027s the best job in the world, I rather think I do.\n So far, Jack Warner\u0027s path to the White House had been straight as an arrow. First in his class at Andover? Check. Steady record of volunteer work and public service? Check. Yale undergrad, Harvard Law, partnership in a prestigious New York law firm? Check, check, check. After two brief internships working on senatorial campaigns, Jack Warner ran for Congress, winning the 20th Congressional District seat by a landslide at the astonishingly young age of twenty-nine. Jack Warner never made a friend, took a job, attended a party, or got laid without first thinking, How will this look on my record? On the rare occasions when he slept with a less-than-suitable girl, he made sure that the event took place well away from the prying eyes of any potential voters. But such slipups were rare. Jack made it his business to be in the right place at the right time with the right people. He knew that his appeal lay in his all-American good looks, the air of confidence and down-home goodness that he seemed to project so effortlessly.\n Like everything else in Jack Warner\u0027s life, his marriage to Honor Knowles had been a carefully choreographed political decision.\n Fred Farrell, Jack\u0027s campaign manager, sat him down. \"Our data show you\u0027re still perceived as too young to run for the Senate. We need to \u0027mature\u0027 your image.\"\n Jack was frustrated. \"How? Should I grow a beard? Start wearing vests?\"\n \"Actually the beard\u0027s not a bad idea. But what you really need to do is get married. A couple of kids wouldn\u0027t hurt either. The single women all love you, but you need to work on the family vote.\"\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll ask Karen over the weekend.\"\n Karen Connelly was Jack\u0027s girlfriend of the past ten months and his first really serious love. The only daughter of a respected, political family - Karen\u0027s father, Mitch, had once been White House chief of staff - Karen was also beautiful, intelligent and kind. She adored Jack unconditionally. The two of them had spoken often about starting a family together one day, when Karen finished grad school and Jack\u0027s congressional schedule got less hectic. Evidently \"one day\" was now.\n Fred Farrell frowned. \"I\u0027m not so sure Karen\u0027s the best choice. She\u0027s a sweet girl and all. But for your wife...\"\n Jack bristled. \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with her. Don\u0027t take it personally, Jack. I\u0027m merely saying that ideally I\u0027d prefer someone with a little more \u0027wow\u0027 factor. Not too pretty, of course. That\u0027s a big turnoff for your base.\"\n \"But prettier than Karen?\"\n \"Higher profile than Karen. It wouldn\u0027t hurt if she were independently wealthy, too.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"For the future, dear boy.\" Fred Farrell shook his head despairingly. \"I\u0027m assuming your political ambitions don\u0027t end with the Senate?\"\n \"Of course not.\"\n \"Good. Then start thinking practically. Have you any idea how much a presidential run costs these days?\"\n Jack had a pretty good idea. Many a wealthy man had lost everything pursuing his White House fantasies. Even so, marrying for money seemed distasteful.\n \"Look, I have a girl in mind. Meet her, see what you think. No pressure.\"\n Three months later, Congressman Jack Warner got over his distaste and married society heiress Honor Knowles in a blaze of publicity. The day they left for their honeymoon, Karen Connelly committed suicide, slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Out of respect for Karen\u0027s father, the press never ran the story.\n For Honor Knowles, her whirlwind romance with the most eligible, dashing congressman in the country was easily the most exciting thing that had ever happened to her. Ever since she was a little girl, Honor had felt overlooked. Her elder sister, Constance, was the brains of the family and their mother\u0027s clear favorite. Grace, Honor\u0027s younger sister, was drop-dead beautiful and had been the apple of their father\u0027s eye when he was alive. All of which left Honor pretty much nowhere. The fact that she was bright and attractive in her own right didn\u0027t seem to matter to anyone. I\u0027m the fifth wheel. The backup singer no one ever notices. I\u0027m only popular by association.\n For a handsome man to single her out (and not just any handsome man but Jack Warner, a possible future president!) was so thrilling, so deliciously unexpected, that it never occurred to Honor to question Jack\u0027s motives. Or the speed with which he hustled her down the aisle. Jack, she soon learned, did everything at speed. No sooner had he asked her out on a date than he proposed. No sooner had she accepted than he\u0027d booked the church. No sooner had they gotten back from their honeymoon than he was on her case about getting pregnant.\n \"What\u0027s the rush?\" Honor laughed, stroking his sleek blond head in bed one night. She still had to pinch herself sometimes when she woke up next to Jack. He was so perfect. Not just perfect-looking but perfect on the inside, too. Noble, courageous, visionary. He wanted so many good things for America. \"We\u0027ve only been married five minutes. Can\u0027t we just enjoy being together for a little while, first?\"\n But Jack was insistent. He wanted a family and he wanted it now. On their honeymoon in Tahiti, Honor had been worried. Jack got a phone call from home on their first morning at the resort that had clearly upset him. He canceled their snorkeling trip (\"You go. I have to work.\") and barely spoke to Honor for the remainder of the day. That night, he kept calling out \"Karen!\" in his sleep. When Honor questioned him the next day, he was defensive. \"Jesus, Honor. You\u0027re cross-examining my dreams now?\"\n After that, he was withdrawn and morose the entire week, refusing to talk about what was troubling him and avoiding all of Honor\u0027s attempts at closeness. He didn\u0027t even want to make love. But when they got back to New York, to Honor\u0027s immense relief, the black mood lifted. Suddenly he was all over her again.\n He wouldn\u0027t want to start a family if he didn\u0027t love me, she reasoned. This is his way of saying sorry for Tahiti. And really, why should we wait? What could be sweeter than having a mini-Jack running around?\n Their first daughter, Roberta, was born nine months later, followed within a year by her sister, Rose. Because the pregnancies were so close together, Honor was still carrying weight from Roberta when she conceived Rose. As a result, when Jack took her out for dinner to celebrate their second anniversary, Honor was almost fifty pounds heavier than she had been on her wedding day.\n \"Why don\u0027t you start running again?\" Jack suggested bluntly over the pan-fried scallops. \"You could go with your sister and her trainer. Grace is looking fantastic at the moment. That guy must be doing something right.\"\n It was as if he\u0027d stuck a pin in Honor\u0027s eyeball. Grace. Why did everything always have to come back to Grace?\n When Honor married Jack Warner, she felt like the star of the show for the first time in her life. Growing up, Grace had always stolen her thunder. The worst part was, she\u0027d done it without even trying. Just by walking into a room, Grace owned it, shining with a light so blinding it obliterated Honor\u0027s presence altogether. Honor tried hard to stamp down her feelings of jealousy and resentment. She knew Grace loved her, that she thought of Honor as her best friend. And yet there were times when Honor Knowles fantasized about her sister having an \"accident.\" She pictured Grace falling from the high bars, her perfect little doll\u0027s body contorted and broken on the gym floor. Or a car accident in which Grace\u0027s exquisite, model features were ravaged by flames. The flames of my hatred. The fantasies were shameful, but they felt good.\n When Honor married Jack, she thought, All that\u0027s behind me now. Now that I\u0027m happy and famous, now that someone wonderful loves me, I can be the big sister Grace always wanted me to be.\n It didn\u0027t work out that way. Ironically, it was Honor who had introduced Grace to Lenny Brookstein, at one of Jack\u0027s fund-raisers. Two weeks later, Grace announced they were in love.\n At first, Honor thought she was kidding. When she realized her mistake, she felt sick to her stomach. \"But, Gracie, you\u0027re eighteen years old. He\u0027s old enough to be your grandfather.\"\n \"I know. It\u0027s crazy!\" Grace laughed, that sweet, tinkling laugh that made all men melt like butter on a stove. \"I never thought I could feel this way about someone like Lenny but...I\u0027m so happy, Honor. Truly. And so\u0027s Lenny. Can\u0027t you be happy for us?\"\n \"Darling, I am happy. If it\u0027s what you really want.\"\n But Honor wasn\u0027t happy. She was furious.\n It wasn\u0027t enough for Grace to settle down with some normal, rich investment banker, like Connie had done. Oh no. Madam has to go and ensnare the biggest billionaire in New York. Honor Knowles\u0027s brief moment in the sun was already fading. While she was stuck at home, fat and exhausted like a mother hen, Grace was once more the talk of the town. And now here was Jack, her own beloved husband, comparing her unfavorably to her little sister because she\u0027d gained a few pounds giving birth to his children! It was not to be borne.\n And yet Honor did bear it, stoically and in silence. The same way she bore Jack\u0027s neglect of her and the children, his selfishness, his rampant ambition, and most recently, his infidelities. She lost the weight, every last pound of it. As far as the public was concerned, Senator Warner and his wife had a fairy-tale marriage. Honor was not about to disillusion them. The pretense was all she had left, and she kept it up, smiling at Jack loyally during his speeches, giving magazine interviews about her homemaking tips and Jack\u0027s brilliance as a \"hands-on\" father. Of course, Honor knew full well that the only thing Jack had had his hands on lately were the au pair\u0027s breasts, but she would have died rather than admit it.\n The same went for her loathing of her sister. On the surface, Honor Warner remained close to both her sisters, but particularly to Grace. The two women ate lunch together twice a week, in addition to their regular shopping trips and vacations en famille. But beneath the loving, sisterly fa\u0026ccedil;ade, Honor\u0027s resentment bubbled like scalding magma.\n Jack encouraged his wife to strengthen her ties to the Brooksteins. \"It\u0027s win-win, darling. You get to spend time with Grace. I know how much you love her. And I get some face time with Lenny. If Lenny Brookstein endorses my run for the White House in four years\u0027 time, I\u0027ll be unstoppable.\"\n Honor thought about it. If Jack runs for president, he\u0027ll have to stop chasing tail. It\u0027s too risky. Plus, if he becomes president, with Lenny Brookstein\u0027s money, I\u0027ll be first lady. Not even Grace can trump that.\n Recently, however, Jack\u0027s fervor for his billionaire in-laws had inexplicably cooled. It started with bitchy comments about Grace\u0027s clothes and Lenny\u0027s ever-growing paunch. In the days leading up to the Quorum Ball, it spilled over into something more overt. Jack was drinking heavily. At home, when drunk, he would rant at Honor about Lenny Brookstein\u0027s \"disloyalty,\" his \"arrogance.\"\n \"Fucking prick, who does he think he\u0027s talking to? One of his employees?\" he rambled. \"If Lenny wants his dick sucked, he should ask John Merrivale or that ass-kisser Preston. I\u0027m a fucking United States senator!\"\n Honor had no idea what Jack was talking about. She longed to ask, but she was too afraid. Despite everything, Honor Warner still loved her husband. Deep down she was convinced that if she helped Jack\u0027s career - said the right things, wore the right dress, threw the right parties - he would eventually fall in love with her again.\n She could not know that Jack Warner had never been in love with her in the first place.\n JACK CAME DOWNSTAIRS IN HIS BATHROBE, hunting for some Alka-Seltzer. Roberta, known to her parents as Bobby, flew into his arms like a whirlwind.\n \"Daddy!\" Blond and chubby, like a Renaissance cherub, Bobby had always been a very affectionate child. \"Ilse says if we\u0027re not good, we won\u0027t go to In-tuck-it. That\u0027s not right, is it?\"\n Jack set his daughter back down on the floor.\n \"Don\u0027t pester your father, Roberta,\" said Ilse.\n \"But we like In-tuck-it. Even Rose does, don\u0027t you, Rosie?\"\n Four-year-old Rose was pulling Dior lipsticks out of Mommy\u0027s makeup bag and snapping them in half, rubbing waxy pink mess all over the hardwood floor. Ilse was too busy making eyes at her boss to notice.\n \"Can I help you with anything, Senator Warner?\"\n \"No,\" Jack snapped. Nantucket. I forgot about that. That bastard Brookstein invited us all to his estate last night. Like we\u0027re all such good buddies.\n It had cost Jack Warner\u0027s pride dearly for him to go to Lenny Brookstein for help. He\u0027d never have done it if he hadn\u0027t been desperate. But he was desperate, and Lenny knew it. It had started as a sort of stress relief. A few innocent bets here and there, on the horses or the blackjack tables. But as his losses crept up, so did the size of Jack\u0027s positions. Gambling had unleashed a reckless side to Jack Warner that he had never before been aware of. It was exciting, exhilarating and addictive. Recently, his addiction had started to cost him dearly in financial terms. But the real risk was political. Jack had built his entire career on his reputation as an upstanding, Christian conservative. Compulsive gambling might not be illegal, but it would lose him the family values vote in a heartbeat.\n Fred Farrell gave it to him straight. \"You have to stop this, Jack. Right now. Pay off your debts and wipe the slate clean.\"\n As if it were that easy! Pay off my debts? With what? Honor\u0027s inheritance had all been blown on the house and the children\u0027s education. As a senator, Jack earned $140,000 a year, a fraction of what he used to make as an attorney, and an even smaller fraction of what he now owed - in some cases, to some deeply unsavory characters.\n There was no way around it. He would have to tap his brother-in-law. It would be embarrassing, sure. But once he explained the situation, Lenny would help him out. Lenny\u0027s a long-term thinker. When they make me president, I\u0027ll pay him back a thousandfold. He knows that.\n It turned out Lenny Brookstein did not know it. Instead of writing a check, he\u0027d given Jack a lecture.\n \"I\u0027m sorry for you, Jack, truly I am. But I can\u0027t help. My father was a gambler. Put my poor mother through hell. If it hadn\u0027t been for the enablers, the friends who bailed him out time after time, the nightmare might have ended a lot sooner. As it was, he lost the money that could have paid for Ma\u0027s medical treatment.\"\n Jack tried to keep his cool. \"With all due respect, Lenny, I don\u0027t think I have much in common with your father. I\u0027m a United States senator. I\u0027m good for this money, you know that. It\u0027s just a small cash-flow problem.\"\n Lenny smiled amiably. \"In which case I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll solve it on your own. Now, was there anything else?\"\n Patronizing bastard! It wasn\u0027t just a refusal. It was a dismissal. Jack Warner would not forget the slight as long as he lived. His first thought last night had been to tell Lenny Brookstein to stick his invitation to Nantucket where the \"moon don\u0027t shine.\" But on reflection, perhaps that was a mistake. The truth was, he was still in urgent need of a significant injection of cash. Honor and Grace were close. Maybe if Honor worked on her little sister, Grace could make her besotted husband see sense? Of course, such a policy would mean Jack coming clean to Honor about his gambling debts. Not an appealing prospect. But at the end of the day, what was she going to do? Leave me? I don\u0027t think so.\n Turning to Ilse, he said, \"We\u0027ll leave for Nantucket first thing Monday morning. Please make sure the girls are packed and ready.\"\n Bobby shot her au pair a look of purest triumph. \"See. I told you we were going.\"\n \"Yes, sir. Is there anything...special...you\u0027d like me to pack?\"\n Ilse gave him a lascivious wink. Her meaning could not have been clearer.\n Neither could Jack\u0027s.\n \"No. You won\u0027t be coming with us. As of Monday, you\u0027re fired.\"\n Grabbing the Alka-Seltzer from the kitchen cupboard, he went back upstairs to bed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-4.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: \n Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
