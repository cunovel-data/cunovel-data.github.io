{"id":70040,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"KAREN WILLIS RUBBED HER EYES. IT was two in the morning and Grace Brookstein was climbing into her bed. \"Grace? What is it? Are you sick?\" Grace shook her head. Beneath the blanket, the two of them huddled together for warmth. Karen felt the softness of Grace\u0027s breasts against her back. The smell of her skin, the soft caress of her breath. Instinctively, she slid a hand under Grace\u0027s nightdress, reaching for the silky wetness between her thighs. \"I love you.\" Karen turned to press her lips to Grace\u0027s. For a few glorious seconds, Grace responded, kissing her back. Then she pulled away. \"I\u0027m sorry. I...I can\u0027t.\" Grace felt torn. Part of her was tempted to accept the comfort Karen was offering. After all, Lenny was gone. And Grace loved Karen, too, in a way. But she knew it wasn\u0027t right. She didn\u0027t love Karen in that way. Not really. Even if she had, it would have been wrong to raise her hopes. Especially considering what she was about to tell her. Karen looked anguished. How could she have been so stupid? She\u0027d misread the signals. \"Oh God. Are you angry with me?\" \"No. Not at all. Why would I be?\" \"I would never have made a move if I hadn\u0027t thought...I mean, you came into my bed.\" \"I know. I\u0027m sorry. Look, it was my fault,\" said Grace. \"I needed to talk to you. I need your advice.\" \"My advice?\" \"Uh-huh. I\u0027m going to escape.\" It was the break in the tension Karen needed. She laughed so hard she almost woke Cora. Grace didn\u0027t get it. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" \"Oh, Grace! You can\u0027t be serious!\" \"I\u0027m deadly serious.\" \"Honey, it\u0027s impossible. No one\u0027s ever escaped from Bedford Hills.\" Grace shrugged. \"There\u0027s a first time for everything, right?\" \"Not for this.\" Karen wasn\u0027t laughing anymore. \"You actually mean it, don\u0027t you? You\u0027re out of your mind, Grace. Have you looked outside lately? There are nine barbed-wire fences between us and freedom, all of them electrified. There are guards and dogs and cameras and guns.\" \"I know all that.\" \"Then you\u0027re not thinking clearly. Look, even if you found some way to escape - which you won\u0027t, because it\u0027s impossible - you have one of the most recognizable faces in America. How far do you think you\u0027ll get?\" Grace ran a hand over her broken nose. \"I\u0027m not so recognizable anymore. I don\u0027t look the way I used to. Anyway, I can disguise myself.\" \"When they catch you, they\u0027ll shoot you. No questions asked.\" \"I know that, too. It\u0027s a risk I\u0027m prepared to take.\" Karen stroked Grace\u0027s cheek in the darkness. This was madness. No one escaped from Bedford Hills. If Grace tried it, she\u0027d be killed for sure. Even if, by some miracle, she were captured alive, it still meant Karen would never see her again. Grace would be transferred to solitary. Sent out of state. Locked up in some secret CIA holding pen never to be heard of again. \"Don\u0027t do this, Grace. Please. I don\u0027t want to lose you.\" Grace saw Karen\u0027s eyes well up. Leaning forward, she kissed her full on the mouth. It was a passionate, lingering kiss. A kiss to be remembered by. A kiss good-bye. \"I have to do it, Karen.\" \"No you don\u0027t. Why?\" \"Because Lenny was murdered, okay?\" Karen sat up. \"Whaaat? Says who?\" \"Davey Buccola. He found evidence, stuff that was suppressed at the inquest.\" So Buccola put her up to this. I\u0027ll kill him. \"I have to find out who killed my husband.\" \"But, Grace - \" \"I\u0027m going to find him. And then I\u0027m going to kill him.\" Grace waited for the outrage, the shock, but it never came. Instead Karen put her arms around her and hugged her tightly. Karen remembered Billy, her sister\u0027s boyfriend. How right it had felt when that bullet hit him between the eyes. Despite everything that had happened since, she had never regretted what she\u0027d done. She did not want to lose Grace. But she understood. \"I assume you have a plan?\" \"Actually, that\u0027s what I wanted to talk to you about...\" SISTER AGNES WATCHED GRACE BROOKSTEIN CLEARING away a jigsaw puzzle and offered up a silent prayer to the Lord: Thank You for bringing me this lost soul, Jesus. Thank You for allowing me to be the vessel of Your redeeming grace. Sister Agnes had only been Sister Agnes for five years. Before that, she was Tracey Grainger, a lonely, unpopular teenage girl from Frenchtown, New Jersey. Tracey Grainger had fallen in love with a local boy named Gordon Hicks. Gordon had told her he loved her and Tracey had believed him. When Gordon got her pregnant, then promptly abandoned her, Tracey went home and swallowed as many pills as she could find. The baby did not survive. Neither did Tracey Grainger. The girl who woke up from that overdose in a grimly sterile hospital bed, clutching her stomach and weeping with guilt, was not the same girl whom Gordon Hicks had so peremptorily dumped. She was not the same straight-C student who had disappointed her parents since the day she was born. She was not the same socially awkward, unlovable tenth grader whom no one invited to prom. This girl was an entirely new person. A person loved by God. A person of value. A person whose sins had been forgiven, who would one day become one with Jesus at the right hand of the Father. If anyone believed in the power of redemption, it was Sister Agnes. God had redeemed her. He had saved her life. Now, in His infinite love and mercy, He had redeemed Grace Brookstein, too. And He had allowed her, Sister Agnes, to play a small part in the miracle. Only this morning, Grace told her, \"I feel so fulfilled here, Sister. Working with these children. With you. It\u0027s like I\u0027ve been given a second chance at life.\" What a warm glow of satisfaction those words had given her! Sister Agnes hoped she was not guilty of the mortal sin of pride. She must remember that it was God who had transformed Grace, not her. And yet Sister Agnes couldn\u0027t help but feel that her friendship had contributed to some of the changes in Grace. Grace had changed Sister Agnes, too. A nun\u0027s life could be lonely. Most of the other Sisters of Mercy were old enough to be Sister Agnes\u0027s mother, if not her grandmother. Over the last few months she had come to cherish the easy friendship she seemed to have developed with Grace Brookstein. The shared glances. The smiles. The trust. Grace put the puzzle pieces back into their box then stacked it neatly on the shelf. Sister Agnes smiled warmly. \"Thank you, Grace. I can finish up here. I know you want to get to the library.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Grace cheerfully. \"I\u0027m happy to help. Oh, by the way, that modeling clay that we ordered last week? We need to return it.\" \"Do we? Why?\" \"I opened seven or eight of the crates this morning, and the stuff inside had completely dried out. I tried soaking it in water but it just ended up all slimy. It\u0027ll have to go back.\" What a pain, thought Sister Agnes. It had taken her the better part of a day to stack those crates in the children\u0027s center storeroom with Sister Theresa. Now she\u0027d have to lug the stupid things back out again. \"I e-mailed the delivery company,\" said Grace. \"They\u0027re coming to pick them up on Tuesday at four o\u0027clock.\" \"Tuesday?\" Sister Agnes looked pained. \"Oh, Grace, it was kind of you to arrange it. But I can\u0027t supervise a pickup on Tuesday, I\u0027m afraid. A delegation from the department of corrections will be here for a tour. Sister Theresa and I have our quarterly budget meeting with them afterward. We\u0027ll be out all afternoon.\" \"Oh.\" Grace looked disappointed. Then she suddenly brightened. \"Perhaps I could do it?\" Sister Agnes frowned. \"I don\u0027t know about that, Grace.\" Inmates in A Wing were not supposed to help with pickups or deliveries. The warden considered it a potential security risk. But Grace had come so far in her rehabilitation. Sister Agnes would hate to give her the impression that she wasn\u0027t trusted. Grace said, \"The children have already waited weeks. It seems a shame to delay things even further.\" \"Those crates are heavy, Grace,\" Sister Agnes said awkwardly. \"It\u0027s a two-person job.\" \"Cora can help me.\" \"Cora Budds?\" This idea was going from bad to worse. \"She has kitchen duty on Tuesdays but she\u0027s usually finished by three.\" Grace looked so hopeful, so eager to please. Sister Agnes wavered. What harm can it do? Just this once. \"Well, I suppose...if you\u0027re sure you and Cora can handle it...\" Grace smiled. \"Loading a delivery truck? Yes, Sister. I think we can manage that.\" Her heart was pounding so loudly she was surprised Sister Agnes couldn\u0027t hear it. She was a sweet, kind woman and Grace felt bad deceiving her. But it couldn\u0027t be helped. It was starting. GRACE BROOKSTEIN\u0027S PLANNED ESCAPE ATTEMPT RAPIDLY became the worst-kept secret at Bedford Hills. The idea was simple: The delivery truck would arrive at the children\u0027s center. Grace and Cora Budds would begin loading up the crates of clay. While Cora distracted the driver, Grace would go back into the storeroom, empty one of the crates and hide herself inside it. Cora would complete the loading on her own, making sure that the lid of Grace\u0027s crate was not fully sealed, to allow her some air, and that it was hidden well back among the others. It was the next part of the plan that was the wild card. Everything rested on the security check. Trucks came in and out of Bedford Hills every day, delivering everything from toilet paper to detergent to food. The prison was equipped with state-of-the-art security systems. As well as manual searches, the guards used sniffer dogs and even infrared scanners to spot-check vehicles, in addition to the CCTV cameras that were everywhere at Bedford. Typically, the more thorough searches took place on the way in to the prison. There was less emphasis on what might be going out. But all searches were at the guards\u0027 discretion. If they didn\u0027t like the look of a driver, or a vehicle, or if they just felt like it for whatever reason, they could hold people up for hours, X-raying every square inch of their car or person. Grace hoped that on a cold January night, the guards\u0027 appetite for hauling out crate after crate of children\u0027s modeling clay would be low. But she wouldn\u0027t know until they got to the checkpoint. Once the truck was waved through, if it was waved through, and they drove clear of Bedford, Grace would climb out of the crate and make her way to the rear doors. As soon as the driver stopped at a junction, she would open the door of the truck and jump to freedom. Easy. \"IT\u0027S NOT GOING TO WORK.\" Karen leaned across the table and helped herself to Grace\u0027s watery mashed potatoes. They were at lunch, a few days before the breakout was supposed to take place. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence.\" \"Have you thought about what you\u0027re gonna do if you do make it out of here?\" Grace had thought of little else. When she fantasized about her escape, she pictured herself as the hunter, unmasking Lenny\u0027s killer, wreaking her revenge. But the reality was that she would also be hunted down. If she were going to survive, she\u0027d need food, shelter, money and a disguise. She had no idea how she was going to obtain any of them. \"What about friends on the outside. Is there anybody you can trust? Anyone who\u0027ll cover for you?\" Grace shook her head. \"No. No one.\" There was one person she trusted. Davey Buccola. Davey was working on new information, checking out the alibis for everyone who\u0027d stayed with Grace and Lenny on Nantucket the day Lenny died. If Grace turned to anyone on the outside, it would be him. But she wasn\u0027t about to tell Karen that. \"In that case, we need to fix you up with a survival pack from here.\" \"A survival pack?\" \"Sure. You\u0027ll need a new identity. A few new identities, so you can keep moving. Driver\u0027s licenses, credit cards, some cash. You won\u0027t get very far as Grace Brookstein.\" \"Where am I going to get a driver\u0027s license from, Karen? Or a credit card. It\u0027s impossible.\" \"Said the woman who figures she\u0027s going to escape from Bedford Hills! Don\u0027t sweat the small stuff, Grace. Leave that to me.\" Karen had warned Grace that she would need to let \"a few of the girls\" in on the escape plan in order to get what they needed in such a short space of time. To Grace\u0027s horror, \"a few of the girls\" turned out to be almost every inmate at Bedford. Forging a credit card and a driver\u0027s license was no mean feat. Karen was forced to corral help from all over the prison. Inmates in the warden\u0027s office, the library and the computer room typed, Photoshopped and laminated for days, all of them risking their own paroles and futures for a chance to help Grace and be part of the Great Escape. The only people who didn\u0027t know about the plan were the guards and Lisa Halliday. It was debatable whether Lisa would have snitched on Grace - powerful inmates could attack their rivals with impunity but selling out another prisoner was still considered taboo. Still Karen wasn\u0027t prepared to risk it. Grace was grateful for everyone\u0027s help, but she was nervous. \"Too many people know.\" \"They\u0027re not \u0027 people,\u0027\" Karen told her. \"They\u0027re your friends. You can trust them.\" Trust. It was a word from another life, another planet. TUESDAY MORNING DAWNED GRAY AND COLD. Grace had barely slept. All night long, the voices haunted her: Lenny: Whatever happens, Grace, I love you. John Merrivale: Don\u0027t worry, Grace. Just do what Frank Hammond tells you and you\u0027ll be fine. Karen: When they catch you, they\u0027ll shoot you, no questions asked. Grace didn\u0027t touch her oatmeal at breakfast. \"You need your strength,\" Cora Budds told her. \"Eat somethin\u0027.\" \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ll throw up.\" The big black woman narrowed her eyes. \"I ain\u0027t asking you, Grace. I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you. You better get it together, girl. I\u0027m putting my hide on the line for you today. We all are. Now eat.\" She\u0027s right. I can do this. I have to do it. Grace ate. \"ARE YOU SURE YOU\u0027RE ALL RIGHT, Grace? Perhaps you should go and lie down.\" It was noon at the children\u0027s center. The delegation of senior prison officials was due to arrive at twelve thirty. The morning had been spent tidying up desks and toys, putting up fresh artwork and generally ensuring that the facility looked its very best. If the delegation was impressed, they might raise the budget. Or at least not slash it. Grace had worked diligently as usual, but Sister Agnes was worried about her. Her complexion had been green when she arrived for work this morning. Now it had faded to a sickly off-white. A moment ago, reaching up to a high shelf to rearrange some books, she\u0027d become dizzy and almost fainted. \"I\u0027m fine, Sister.\" \"I don\u0027t think you are fine. The infirmary ought to take a look at you.\" \"No!\" Grace felt her throat go dry with panic. You can\u0027t send me to the infirmary. Not today. What if they keep me all afternoon? She remembered what Cora said to her at breakfast. She had to pull herself together. \"I\u0027m a little dehydrated, that\u0027s all. Perhaps I could have a glass of water?\" Sister Agnes went to fetch the water. While she was gone Grace pinched her cheeks and took some deep, calming breaths. By the time the nun returned, she looked slightly better. From the far corner of the room, Lisa Halliday watched the scene with suspicion. \"What\u0027s up with Lady Brookstein?\" she asked one of the mothers, a young black woman who hadn\u0027t been at Bedford long. \"She\u0027s been acting weird as shit all morning, even by her standards.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t you be if you was gonna bust out of here?\" said the girl. One look at Lisa\u0027s face told her she\u0027d screwed up big-time. But by then it was too late. \"What\u0027d you say?\" \"Nothing. I was just...I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about. It\u0027s just some crazy rumors.\" Lisa Halliday put her face within an inch of the girl\u0027s. \"Tell me.\" \"Please. I...I shouldn\u0027ta said nuthin\u0027. Cora\u0027ll kill me.\" \"Tell me everything or I\u0027ll make sure the warden never lets you see your kid again.\" \"Please, Lisa.\" \"You think I can\u0027t do it?\" The girl thought about her son, Tyrone. He was three years old, as cute and chubby as a puppy. He\u0027d be here in a half hour, snuggling up to her, drawing pictures for her to keep in her cell. She started to talk. HANNAH DENZEL KNITTED HER BEETLE BROWS into one long, angry caterpillar as she led the VIPs down the hall to the children\u0027s center. \"This way, ladies and gentlemen.\" Denny did not like showing \"delegations\" around Bedford Hills. Today\u0027s self-important posse of politicians and police officers was as bad as all the others: the do-gooder prison visitors, the priests, the social workers, the therapists, the nuns, the whole goddamn army of meddlesome outsiders who infested her territory twice a year with their clipboards and recommendations. None of them seemed to realize that these women were vermin. That they were at Bedford Hills to be punished, not saved. It made Denny sick. The group \"oohed\" and \"aahed\" over the children\u0027s center, scattering among the pristine workstations and play areas. Warden McIntosh stood watching them like a proud father. Then his face changed. Grace Brookstein was hovering by one of the bookcases looking pale and ill. Damn it. He\u0027d completely forgotten about Grace. The last thing he needed was to have his most notorious prisoner distracting the group\u0027s attention from the jewel in Bedford\u0027s crown. He whispered in Hannah Denzel\u0027s ear. \"Get her out of here. Quietly. She\u0027s a distraction.\" The prison guard\u0027s cruel eyes lit up. \"Yes, sir.\" This was more like it. Walking over to Grace, she grabbed her roughly by the arm. \"Let\u0027s go, Brookstein. Back to your cell.\" \"My cell? But I-I can\u0027t,\" Grace stammered. \"I\u0027m working.\" \"Not anymore you\u0027re not. Move it.\" Grace opened her mouth to protest but no sound came out. Panic rose up in her throat like vomit. \"Is something the matter?\" Sister Agnes glided over. \"Can I help?\" \"No,\" snapped Denny, pushing Grace toward the door. She resented the Sisters of Mercy\u0027s presence at Bedford Hills. Sister Agnes should back the fuck off to her rosary and leave the inmates to the professionals. \"Warden wants this one on lockdown. And he doesn\u0027t want a scene.\" Grace looked pleadingly at Sister Agnes. Help me! The nun smiled kindly at her friend. \"Don\u0027t look so woebegone, Grace. You could do with a little rest. Enjoy your afternoon off. We\u0027ll still be here tomorrow.\" Yes. And now so will I, thought Grace. She could have wept. IT WAS THREE FORTY-FIVE BEFORE LISA Halliday was able to get out of the children\u0027s center. That slave-driving do-gooder Sister Theresa had given her a list of chores as long as her police record. Sprinting to the warden\u0027s office, she marched up to the reception desk. \"I need to see the warden,\" she panted. \"It\u0027s urgent.\" The receptionist looked at the surly bull dyke in front of her and stiffened. \"Warden McIntosh can\u0027t see anybody today. He has a delegation - \" \"Like I said. It\u0027s urgent.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" the girl repeated. \"He\u0027s not here.\" \"Well, where is he?\" The receptionist\u0027s tone got frostier. \"Out. He\u0027s in meetings all afternoon. Is it something I can help you with?\" \"No,\" Lisa said rudely. \"I want the organ grinder, not the friggin\u0027 monkey.\" She had to see the warden and she had to see him alone. If word got out that she was the fink who\u0027d sold out Grace Brookstein, she\u0027d be finished at Bedford Hills. \"Then there\u0027s nothing I can do.\" Lisa sank her great bulk down onto one of the hard chairs lining the wall. \"Fine. I\u0027ll wait.\" CORA BUDDS LEFT HER JOB IN the kitchen at ten of four and hurried over to the children\u0027s center as arranged. Two mothers were saying good-bye to their kids while a single, bored guard looked on. Cora asked one of the mothers, \"Where\u0027s Grace?\" \"In lockdown. Denny dragged her off hours ago. She didn\u0027t look well.\" Cora thought, I bet she didn\u0027t. That\u0027s it, then. If Grace is in lockdown, the whole plan goes up in smoke. She walked into the storeroom alone. Maybe it\u0027s for the best. GRACE SAT ON HER BUNK, STARING into space. She was too drained to cry. It was over. God knew when she\u0027d have a chance to try again. Maybe not for years. Years in which whoever killed Lenny would be out there, free, happy, unpunished. The thought was unbearable. Mindlessly, she looked at the clock on the wall: 3:55...4:00...4:05...The truck would be there by now. Cora would be loading it, alone, wondering what had happened. At 4:08, Grace heard the jangle of keys in the lock. Karen\u0027s shift must have ended early. At least she\u0027d be pleased the escape plan had failed. The door swung open. \"Get up.\" Denny\u0027s eyes blazed with spite. She\u0027d been brooding all day over Sister Agnes\u0027s words to Grace. Enjoy your afternoon off. As if this were some sort of summer camp! There were no afternoons off at Bedford Hills. \"You missed four hours of work detail this afternoon, you sneaky little bitch. Thought you were on vacation, did you? A free pass?\" Grace said meekly, \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"Good. Because there are no fucking vacations in A Wing. Not while I\u0027m in charge. You can make up those work hours, starting right now. Get your ass over to the children\u0027s center and start scrubbing the floors.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"When you\u0027ve finished, do it again. And you can forget about eating tonight. You stay on that floor, scrubbing, till I come for you, understand?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"MOVE!\" Grace bolted out of the cell and started running down the corridor. Denny watched her go, a slow smile of satisfaction spreading across her face. She had no idea that Grace was running for her life. CORA BUDDS HAD ALMOST FINISHED LOADING the crates. The truck driver grumbled, \"I thought there was gonna be two of yous? I\u0027da brought another guy if I\u0027d known.\" Cora shrugged. \"Life\u0027s a bitch, ain\u0027t it?\" It was already dark in the cramped courtyard backing on to the children\u0027s center storeroom. The temperature was below zero, but the biting wind made it feel even colder. The boxes were small, about two feet square. Looking at them, Cora couldn\u0027t imagine how Grace had ever thought she was gonna squeeze herself inside one. They were also heavy. Their weight, combined with the finger-numbing cold, made the work slow going. \"Sorry I\u0027m late.\" Grace stood shivering in the lamplight. Still in her skirt and thin cotton blouse, she was ridiculously underdressed for the winter evening. The wind sliced into her skin like razor blades. Cora Budds\u0027s eyes widened in surprise but she said nothing. The driver looked pissed. \"Are you kidding me? This is your number two? She couldn\u0027t lift a cup of coffee, never mind a crate of clay.\" \"Sure she can,\" said Cora. \"You can leave it to us now.\" \"Fine by me.\" The driver climbed back into the welcoming warmth of the cab. \"One of you ladies give me the nod when you\u0027re done.\" Back in the storeroom, Cora and Grace worked quickly. Sister Agnes or one of the guards could come back any minute. Cora pulled Grace\u0027s documents out of the pocket in her jumpsuit, stuffing them into Grace\u0027s bra. There were four fake IDs with matching credit cards, a slip of paper with an anonymous Hotmail address on it and a small wad of cash. \"Karen has a friend on the outside who\u0027ll wire you more money with Western Union when you need it. Just e-mail an amount, the zip code you\u0027re in and the initials of the fake ID you\u0027re using, and this person will do the rest. Take this, too.\" She handed Grace a silver stiletto. \"You never know.\" Grace stared at the blade in her palm for a second, hesitating, then slipped it into her shoe. Cora pried open the lid of one of the crates, emptying its contents at lightning speed. Somehow the box looked even smaller when it was empty. Cora said, \"I don\u0027 think it\u0027s possible, Grace. A cat couldn\u0027t fit in there.\" Grace smiled. \"It\u0027s possible. I was a gymnast when I was younger. Watch.\" Cora watched in awe as Grace climbed into the box, ass first, folding her tiny limbs around herself like a double-jointed spider. \"Girl, that looks painful.\" She winced. \"You sure you\u0027re okay?\" \"It\u0027s not exactly first-class travel, but I\u0027ll live. Try the lid. Am I in?\" Cora tried it. Easy. About an inch to spare. She levered it open again. \"You\u0027re in. I\u0027m gonna load the rest of \u0027em now. I\u0027ll put you three rows back, so you\u0027re hidden at the checkpoint, but leave the lid loose so you got some air.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Sit tight till you get through the checkpoint. Once you\u0027re outta here, soon as the truck stops, you jump.\" \"Got it. Thanks, Cora. For everything.\" Good luck, Amazing Grace. Cora Budds replaced the lid and carried Grace out into the darkness. WARDEN MCINTOSH EYED LISA HALLIDAY SUSPICIOUSLY. \"This had better not be some sort of scam.\" \"It ain\u0027t.\" \"Grace Brookstein is in lockdown. She\u0027s been in her cell since lunchtime. Besides, A-Wing prisoners never work on deliveries. Sister Agnes knows the policy.\" \"Sister Agnes don\u0027t know her pussy from her paternoster.\" \"That\u0027s enough!\" the warden snapped. \"I won\u0027t have you disrespecting our voluntary staff.\" \"Look. You don\u0027t wanna check the truck? Fine. Don\u0027t check it. Jus\u0027 don\u0027 say I didn\u0027t warn you.\" Warden McIntosh did not want to check the truck. It had been a long day. He wanted to finish up his paperwork and get home to his wife. But he knew he had no choice. \"All right, Lisa. Leave it with me.\" THE DARKNESS WAS DISORIENTING. GRACE HEARD the rear doors of the truck slam shut. For a moment fear gripped her: I\u0027m trapped! But then she relaxed, forcing herself to take slow, even breaths. It was uncomfortable, coiled inside the crate like a marionette, but she could bear the position. The cold, on the other hand, was debilitating. Limb by limb, Grace felt her body start to go numb. Her head ached violently, as if she\u0027d just sunk her teeth into an ice cube. The engine rumbled to life. We\u0027re moving. Soon, all Grace could hear was the beating of her own heart. She said a silent prayer: Please God, don\u0027t let them check all the boxes. THE THUD WAS SO LOUD, THE driver heard it through his blaring Bruce Springsteen CD. One of the crates must have come loose. \"What the fuck?\" Slamming on the brakes, he climbed out of the cab. Dumb-ass fucking dykes. How hard is it to stack a bunch of boxes? All they had to do was put \u0027em one on top of another. Grace heard the rear door open. Rays from a flashlight seeped through the crack above her head, where Cora had left the lid loose. She held her breath \"Goddamn it.\" Crates scraped noisily across the metal floor of the truck. The next thing Grace knew, her own box was moving. Oh God, no! He\u0027ll see me. But the driver didn\u0027t see her. Instead, pulling Grace\u0027s crate forward, he noticed the loose lid and banged it shut with his fist. Then he lifted another box and piled it on top of Grace\u0027s. The rear door slammed. Grace felt the lurch of the truck as it pulled away. Cold beads of sweat broke out all over Grace\u0027s body. She had no air. I\u0027m going to suffocate.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-14.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
