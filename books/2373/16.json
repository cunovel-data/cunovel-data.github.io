{"id":70042,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"BOOK 2 FIFTEEN DETECTIVE MITCH CONNORS RETURNED TO HIS desk in a pensive mood. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Tall, blond, athletic and altogether too big for his glass-walled office, Mitch Connors looked more like a football pro than a cop. Sinking into his uncomfortable chair (Helen had bought him the damn thing two years ago, for his back pain. It had won a bunch of design awards, apparently, and cost a small fortune, so he couldn\u0027t throw it away, but Mitch had always hated it), he stretched out his legs and tried to think. Do I really want this case? On the one hand, his boss had just handed him what would, in a few short hours, become the biggest, most high-profile investigation in the country. Late last night, Grace Brookstein had pulled off a dramatic escape from a maximum-security prison. It would be Mitch Connors\u0027s job to find her, apprehend her and haul her thieving, designer-clad ass back to jail. His boss said, \"You\u0027re the best, Mitch. I wouldn\u0027t put you on this if you weren\u0027t.\" And Mitch had felt a warm glow. But now he felt something else. Something bad. For the life of him, Mitch couldn\u0027t figure out what it was. He blamed the chair. It was so torturous, no wonder he couldn\u0027t concentrate. Ergonomic, my ass. I figure Helen bought it on purpose to torment me. To pay me back for all the shit I put her through. Then he thought, That\u0027s bullshit, Connors, and you know it. Helen wasn\u0027t like that. She was an angel. Saint Helen of Pittsburgh, patron saint of tolerance. And you drove her away. MITCH CONNORS HAD GROWN UP IN PITTSBURGH. He was born in the well-to-do suburb of Monroeville, where his mom was a local beauty queen. She married Mitch\u0027s dad, an inventor, when she was nineteen. Mitch arrived a year later and the couple\u0027s happiness was complete. For about six months. Mitch\u0027s father was a brilliant inventor...by night. By day, he was a traveling encyclopedia salesman. Mitch used to go on trips with him. The little boy would watch in awe as his dad scammed one housewife after another. \"Do you know the average cost of a college education, ma\u0027am?\" Pete Connors was standing on the front steps of a dilapidated house in Genette, Pennsylvania, wearing a suit and tie and shiny black shoes, his trilby hat held respectfully in one hand. He was a handsome man. Mitch thought he looked like Frank Sinatra. The woman standing at the door in a stained housecoat was fat, depressed and defeated. Hungry kids ran around her feet like rats. \"No, sir. Can\u0027t say I do.\" The door was closing. Pete Connors stepped forward. \"Let me tell you. It\u0027s fifteen hundred dollars. Fifteen hundred dollars. Can you imagine that?\" She couldn\u0027t imagine. \"But what if I were to tell you that for as little as one dollar a week - that\u0027s right, one dollar - you can give your child the gift of that same education right here at home?\" \"I never really thought about - \" \"Of course you didn\u0027t! You\u0027re a busy woman. You have bills, responsibilities. You don\u0027t have time to sit down and read studies like this one.\" At a given signal, Mitch would run forward and hand his father a laminated sheaf of papers with the words Educational Research printed on the front. \"Studies that prove that kids who have an encyclopedia in the house are more than six times more likely to go into white-collar jobs?\" \"Well, I - \" \"How\u0027d you like for this little guy here to grow up and be a lawyer, huh?\" Pete Connors slipped one of the dirty-faced children a boiled candy. \"For as little as one dollar a day, you can make that happen, ma\u0027am.\" He was like a whirlwind. A force of nature. Some women he would bulldoze. Others he would charm and cajole. Others still he would take upstairs to perform some \"secret\" sales technique that Mitch was never allowed to see. It always took around fifteen minutes, and it always worked. \"Those Pennsylvania women!\" Mitch\u0027s dad would joke afterward. \"They\u0027re hungry for knowledge, all right. You ain\u0027t never seen a woman hungrier for knowledge than that one, Mitchy!\" After every sale, they would drive to the nearest small town or rest stop and Pete Connors would buy his son an enormous ice-cream sundae. Mitch would return home to his mother full of excitement and wonder, chocolate sauce smeared all over his face. \"Dad was amazing. You shoulda seen what Dad did! Guess how many we sold, Mom. Go on, guess!\" Mitch could never understand why his mother never wanted to guess. Why she looked at his dad with such bitterness and disappointment. Later - too late - he understood. She could have borne the infidelity. It was the recklessness she couldn\u0027t forgive. Pete Connors was a natural salesman, but he was also a dreamer, who regularly blew his earnings investing in one crackpot invention after another. Mitch remembered some of them. There was the vacuum cleaner you didn\u0027t have to push. That was going to make them millions. Then there was the mini-refrigerator for your car. The running shoes that massaged the ball of your foot. The clothes rack that got out creases. Mitch would watch his father work on each new design during weekends and late into the night. Whenever he finished a prototype, he would \"unveil\" it in the living room in front of Mitch\u0027s mom. \"Whaddaya think, Lucy?\" he\u0027d ask hopefully, his face alight with pride and anticipation, like a little boy\u0027s. The tragedy was, Pete Connors loved his wife. He needed her approval so badly. If she\u0027d given it, just once, perhaps things would\u0027ve turned out differently. But her response was always the same. \"How much d\u0027you blow this time?\" \"Jeez, Lucy. Give me a break, would you? I\u0027m an idea man. You knew that when you married me.\" \"Yeah? Well, here\u0027s an idea for you, Pete. How about we make our mortgage this month?\" Mitch\u0027s mom used to say that the only thing his father could ever economize on was the truth. By Mitch\u0027s sixth birthday, they\u0027d moved out of the Monroeville house. The new place was a condo in Murraysville. Next it was Millvale, an area full of old millworkers\u0027 tenements. By the time Mitch was twelve, they were in the Hill District, Pittsburgh\u0027s Harlem, a boarded-up, drug-riddled hell bordering the prosperous downtown. Too poor to divorce, his parents \"separated.\" Within a month, his mom had a new boyfriend. Eventually they moved to Florida, to a nice house with palm trees in the front yard. Mitch decided to stay with his dad. Pete Connors was excited. \"This is great, Mitchy! It\u0027ll be like old times, just the two of us. We\u0027ll have poker nights. Sleep late on Sundays. Get some pretty girls over here, huh? Shake things up a bit!\" There were girls. Some of them were even pretty, but those ones were paid for. Pete Connors\u0027s Frank Sinatra days were long gone. He looked like what he was, a tired old roue long past his sell-by date. It broke Mitch\u0027s heart. As Mitch grew older, his father began to get jealous of his son\u0027s good looks. At seventeen, Mitch had his mother\u0027s blond hair and blue eyes and his father\u0027s long legs and strong, masculine features. He\u0027d also inherited Pete\u0027s gift of gab. \"I\u0027m just home for the summer, helping out my old man. I\u0027m off to biz school in the fall... \"My car? Oh, yeah, I sold it. My little cousin got sick. Leukemia. She\u0027s only six, poor kid. I wanted to help out with her medical bills.\" Women lapped it up. Helen Brunner was different. She was twenty-five years old, a redheaded, green-eyed goddess, and she worked for a veterans\u0027 charity that provided impoverished ex-servicemen with meals and helped them out at home. Mitch never knew how his father had convinced Helen\u0027s charity that he\u0027d been in the navy. Pete Connors couldn\u0027t even swim. Pictures of boats made him nauseous. In any event, Helen started showing up at the apartment three times a week. Pete was crazy about her. \"I bet she\u0027s a virgin. You can tell. Just thinking about that untouched ginger bush makes me horny.\" Mitch hated it when his dad spoke that way. About any woman, but especially about Helen. It was embarrassing. \"Twenty bucks says I fuck her before you do.\" \"Dad! Don\u0027t be stupid. Neither of us is going to fuck her.\" \"Speak for yourself, kiddo. She wants it. Take it from someone who knows. They all want it.\" Helen Brunner didn\u0027t want it. At least, not from a drunken alleged ex-midshipman old enough to be her father. Mitch, on the other hand...now, he was something else. Helen had been raised a Christian. She believed in abstinence. But Mitch Connors was testing her faith to the limits. Lead me not into temptation. Watching Mitch move around the cramped apartment, feeling his eyes surreptitiously sweep over her body as she did the dishes or made the beds, it seemed to Helen that the Lord had led her right into temptation. Mitch felt the same way. He started to make lists. Reasons not to sleep with Helen: 1. She\u0027s a nice girl. 2. You\u0027ll probably get struck by a thunderbolt halfway through. 3. If God doesn\u0027t smite you dead Dad will. Then one day Helen walked into the laundry room to find Mitch standing in his boxer shorts. Helen said a silent prayer. Deliver me from evil. So did Mitch. Forgive me, Father, for I am about to sin. The sex was incredible. They did it on top of the washing machine, in the shower, on the floor in the living room and, finally, in Pete Connors\u0027s bed. Afterward, Mitch lay slumped back on the pillows, replete with happiness. He tried to feel guilty but he couldn\u0027t. He was in love. Helen sat bolt upright. \"Don\u0027t tell me you want it again?\" Mitch groaned. \"No. I heard something. I think it\u0027s your father!\" Helen was in her clothes in a flash. Rushing into the kitchen, she started scrubbing pots. Mitch, whose lower body suddenly seemed to have developed advanced Parkinson\u0027s, stumbled around the bedroom in blind panic. The front door opened. \"Mitch?\" Shit. There was nothing else for it. Stark naked, Mitch dived into the built-in closet, pulling the door closed behind him. At the back of the closet, against the wall, was a trapdoor leading into a crawl space in the roof. Mitch had barely managed to squeeze his six-foot frame through it when he heard Pete Connors\u0027s footsteps in the bedroom. \"MITCH!\" It was a roar. The old man wasn\u0027t stupid. The combination of Helen\u0027s flushed, guilty face and the rumpled sheets must have given them away. Mitch heard the front door open and close. Helen, sensibly, had made a run for it. How Mitch wished he were with her! The closet door opened. A shaft of light appeared under the trapdoor to the crawl space. Mitch held his breath. There was a pause. Shirts being ruffled on hangers. Then the closet door closed. Thank you, God. I swear I will never screw a woman in my father\u0027s bed ever again. Pete Connors\u0027s footsteps receded. Then, suddenly, they stopped. Mitch\u0027s heart did the same. Hey, c\u0027mon, God! We had a deal! The closet door opened again. Then the door to the crawl space. As Pete Connors looked down at his naked son, an unmistakably fishy waft of sex hit him in the face. \"Hey, Dad. I don\u0027t suppose you know where I could find a towel?\" Two minutes later, Mitch was out on the street. He never saw his father alive again. \"I WANT TO GET MARRIED, MITCH.\" Helen and Mitch had been living together for three years. Now almost twenty-one, Mitch was making good money tending bar. Helen had cut back on her charity work to do three days a week as a trainee librarian, but her heart wasn\u0027t in it. She was pushing thirty and she wanted to have a child. \"Why?\" \"Why? Is that a serious question? Because we\u0027re living in mortal sin, that\u0027s why.\" Mitch grinned. \"I know. Hasn\u0027t it been fun so far?\" \"Mitchell! I\u0027m not kidding around. I want to have a baby. I want to make a commitment, to start a family, to do this right. Isn\u0027t that what you want, too?\" \"Sure it is, baby.\" But the truth was, Mitch didn\u0027t know what he wanted. Growing up watching his parents rip each other apart had put him off the idea of marriage for life. He loved Helen, that wasn\u0027t the problem. Or maybe it was the problem. Being with someone so good, so perfect, made him feel uneasy. He had too much of his father in him. A natural-born scammer, flirting was in Mitch\u0027s blood. Sooner or later I\u0027ll let her down. She\u0027ll learn to hate me, to despise me for my weakness. Helen was the mother ship, but Mitch needed lifeboats: other girls who he could keep as backup should Helen see the light and realize she could do a whole lot better than a barman from Pittsburgh. \"Next year,\" he told her. \"Once Dad\u0027s come around to the idea.\" He said the same thing the following year, and the year after that. Then, in the space of a month, two seismic events took place that were to change Mitch\u0027s life forever. First, Helen left him. Then his father was murdered. TWO WEEKS AFTER HELEN BRUNNER WALKED out on Mitch, Pete Connors was stabbed to death outside his apartment. He lost his life for a fake Rolex watch, a cheap, nine-karat gold wedding ring and twenty-three dollars in cash. Mitch\u0027s mom flew in for the funeral. Lucy Connors looked glamorous and suntanned and not remotely grief-stricken. Then again, why should she? She hugged Mitch tightly. \"You okay, sweetie? No offense, but you look like hell.\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" I\u0027m not fine. I should have been there. I abandoned him, and now he\u0027s dead, and I never got to say I was sorry. I never told him how much I loved him. \"Try not to be too upset. I know it sounds harsh, but if this hadn\u0027t happened, the booze would have gotten him soon enough.\" \"It does sound harsh.\" \"I saw the autopsy report, Mitch. I know what I\u0027m talking about. Your father\u0027s liver was like a pickled walnut.\" \"Jesus, Mom!\" \"I\u0027m sorry, honey, but it\u0027s the truth. Your father didn\u0027t want to live.\" \"Maybe not. But he sure as hell didn\u0027t want some deranged junkie to stick a steak knife in his heart. He didn\u0027t ask for that! He didn\u0027t deserve that.\" Mitch\u0027s mother raised an eyebrow as if to say, That\u0027s a moot point, but she let him finish. \"And what about the police? What the hell have they been doing? They just let whoever killed Dad walk free. Like his life didn\u0027t mean anything at all.\" \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve done all they can, Mitch.\" \"Bullshit.\" It was bullshit. The Pittsburgh police had done the bare minimum, grudgingly completing the paperwork on Pete Connors\u0027s murder without lifting a finger to attempt to track down his killer. Mitch made a bunch of complaints, all of them politely ignored. That\u0027s when it dawned on him. People like my dad don\u0027t matter. In the end, he was no different from those poor housewives he used to scam with promises of a better life and white-collar jobs. There\u0027s no justice for people like that. The underclass. No one cares what happens to them. Two weeks after his father\u0027s funeral, Mitch telephoned Helen. \"I\u0027ve made some decisions.\" \"Uh-huh?\" Her voice sounded weary. \"I\u0027m going to become a cop. A detective.\" It wasn\u0027t what she\u0027d been expecting. \"Oh.\" \"Not here, though. I need to get away from Pittsburgh. Start afresh. I thought maybe New York.\" \"That\u0027s great Mitch. Good luck.\" Helen hung up. Ten seconds later, Mitch called her back. \"I was hoping you\u0027d consider coming with me. We\u0027d get married first, obviously. I thought we could - \" \"When? When would we get married?\" \"As soon as you like. Tomorrow?\" Six weeks later they moved to New York as man and wife. Seven weeks after that, Helen was pregnant. THEY CALLED THEIR LITTLE GIRL CELESTE, because she was a gift from the heavens. Helen delighted in motherhood, wandering around their minuscule Queens apartment cuddling her daughter for hours on end. Mitch loved the baby, too, with her shock of black hair and inquisitive, intelligent gray eyes. But he was working long hours, first training, then out on the streets. Often, by the time he got home, Celeste was asleep in her crib and Helen was passed out on the couch, exhausted. Imperceptibly, as the months and years passed, Mitch found it harder and harder to pierce the cocoon of love enveloping his wife and daughter. He got promoted and moved them to a bigger place, expecting that this would make Helen happy. It didn\u0027t. \"We never see you, Mitch.\" \"Sure you do. Come on, honey, don\u0027t exaggerate.\" \"I\u0027m not exaggerating. The other day I heard Sally-Ann ask Celeste if she had a daddy.\" Mitch said angrily, \"That\u0027s ridiculous. Who\u0027s Sally-Ann anyway?\" Helen gave him a withering look. \"She\u0027s your daughter\u0027s best friend. Sally-Ann Meyer? She and Celeste have been joined at the hip for the last two years, Mitch.\" \"Really?\" \"Really.\" Mitch felt bad. He wanted to spend more time at home. The problem, as he told Helen, was that the bad guys never took a vacation. Muggers, junkies, gang leaders, rapists, every day they walked the streets of the city, preying on the vulnerable, the helpless, the poor. Preying on people like my father. Being a detective was more than Mitch\u0027s job. It was his vocation, the same way that being a mother was Helen\u0027s. And he was great at it. The divorce came like a bolt from the blue. Mitch got home one night expecting to find his supper on the table. Instead he found a sheaf of legal papers. Helen and Celeste were gone. In hindsight, he realized the writing had been on the wall for a long time. Ever since the economy imploded, crime in the city had been steadily rising. Then Quorum collapsed, unemployment in New York spiked and overnight a bad situation got twenty times worse. Mitch Connors was on the front line of a war. He couldn\u0027t just lay down his gun and be home in time for dinner. Well, maybe he could. But he didn\u0027t. By the time he realized the toll his dedication had taken on his marriage, it was too late. THE NYPD HAD BECOME MITCH CONNORS\u0027S LIFE. But that didn\u0027t mean he loved it. Guys joined the force for different reasons, not all of them laudable. Some reveled in the authority that the badge and the gun gave them. Power trippers. They were the worst. Others were looking for a sense of camaraderie. To those guys, the NYPD was like a softball team or a fraternity. It filled a void in their life that marriage, family and civilian friendships couldn\u0027t fill. Mitch Connors understood those guys, but didn\u0027t count himself among their number. He hadn\u0027t become a cop to make friends, or to lord it over his fellow citizens. He\u0027d joined up as a form of atonement for his father\u0027s death. And because he still believed he could make a difference. Whoever killed Mitch\u0027s father had gotten away with it. That was wrong. Guilty people deserved to be punished. As for guilty rich people, educated people like Grace and Lenny Brookstein, they were the worst of all. MITCH STOOD UP, KICKING HELEN\u0027S TORTURE chair out of his way. There was a problem with him taking this case. A downside. Now, what the hell was it? At last it came to him. Of course. The FBI would be involved... It had been two years since the Brooksteins\u0027 audacious fraud first came to light, but as the whole of America knew, the stolen Quorum billions were still missing in action. Harry Bain, the FBI\u0027s debonair assistant director in New York, ran the task force set up to find the Quorum cash, and he\u0027d come up with a big fat zero. Bain\u0027s agents had interviewed Grace Brookstein numerous times in prison, but she\u0027d stuck like glue to her story. According to her, she knew nothing about the money and neither did her dear departed husband. Like most NYPD men, Mitch deeply distrusted the FBI. With Grace Brookstein on the run, it was inevitable that Harry Bain would start poking his Harvard-educated nose into Mitch\u0027s case, asking questions, tampering with witnesses, pulling rank. As Mitch\u0027s boss would so eloquently put it, \"Bain\u0027ll be all over your ass like a bad case of herpes. You better be prepared to fight him off.\" Mitch was prepared. The money is Harry Bain\u0027s problem. Grace Brookstein is mine. Maybe, if he caught Grace and became a national hero, Helen would take him back. Was that what he really wanted? He didn\u0027t know anymore. Maybe he wasn\u0027t cut out for marriage. It was time to get to work.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-16.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
