{"id":70035,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"DONNA SANCHEZ ENJOYED HER WORK AT the city morgue. Her friends and family couldn\u0027t understand it. \"All those dead people. Aren\u0027t you creeped out?\" Their reactions made Donna smile. A heavyset Puerto Rican woman with fat, sausagelike fingers and a round, doughy face, Donna had grown up in a big noisy family before starting a big noisy family of her own. Outside of work, the sound track to Donna Sanchez\u0027s life was screaming children, smashing crockery, beeping car horns, blaring television sets. Donna liked the dead because they were silent. The city morgue on Clarkson Avenue in Brooklyn was white, clean and orderly. It made Donna feel peaceful.\n Of course, she still had bad days. Even after eight years, the sight of small children\u0027s bodies could make Donna choke up. Some of the accident victims were pretty gruesome, too. And the suicides. The first time Donna saw a \"jumper,\" she had nightmares about the mangled corpse for weeks afterward: bones erupting through the skin, skull collapsed like a rotten melon. Normally, drowning victims were among the easiest to deal with. Immersion in cold, deep water tended to delay decomposition. Donna also noticed that many of the water-dead had a happy, almost beatific look on their faces.\n Not today\u0027s body, though. The revolting, waxy hulk lying on the slab had no face. The fish had seen to that. All that was left beneath the ravaged stump of a neck was a great, bloated midsection. The left arm and hand were miraculously intact, but the rest of the limbs had gone, snapped off like crab claws. It was, as Donna\u0027s friends would have said, creepy.\n \"Are they really dragging his poor wife in here?\" Like everyone else at the morgue, Donna Sanchez knew that the cops believed the body was Lenny Brookstein\u0027s. That\u0027s why it had been brought back to New York, almost two hundred miles from where it washed up on the Massachusetts coast. \"No one should have to see their loved one like this.\"\n Duane Tyler, the technician, sneered. A handsome black kid, fresh out of high school, Duane was a born cynic. \"Save your sympathy, Donna. One thing Grace Brookstein ain\u0027t is poor. You know what they saying? This son of a bitch ripped off thousands of people. Ordinary people.\"\n \"I know that\u0027s what they\u0027re saying, Duane. It doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s true. Besides, so what if he did? It\u0027s not his wife\u0027s fault.\"\n Duane Tyler shook his head pityingly. \"Don\u0027t you believe it, girl. You think the wives don\u0027t know? Those rich white bitches? They know. They all know.\"\n HARRY BAIN AND GAVIN WILLIAMS WERE in the district attorney\u0027s office.\n It was common knowledge that Angelo Michele\u0027s parents were two of the many New Yorkers facing ruin because of Lenny Brookstein. Angelo was the best legal brain in New York City, but Harry Bain wondered whether, in this case, his judgment might be clouded. The D.A.\u0027s opening words did not reassure him.\n \"Well, I wanted Brookstein\u0027s head on a plate. Looks like I got the next best thing. His torso on a slab.\"\n \"It might not be him,\" said Harry Bain. \"His wife\u0027s on her way to identify the body. What\u0027s left of it. Then we can autopsy.\"\n \"Good.\"\n It was the job of the FBI task force to find the missing Quorum money. But it was Angelo Michele\u0027s job to prosecute those responsible for the theft. Part of him was pleased they\u0027d found a body. The possibility, however remote, that Lenny Brookstein might have somehow escaped and be living the high life on a private atoll in the South Pacific had been keeping Angelo awake at night for weeks. But another part of him felt robbed. If Lenny Brookstein was dead, he couldn\u0027t be punished. Somebody had to be punished.\n \"Have you got any further with Merrivale or Preston?\"\n \"No.\" Harry Bain frowned. \"Not yet.\" He had personally interviewed the two senior Quorum execs a total of six times, but was no closer to untangling the mystery of how Lenny Brookstein had managed to spirit away such insane amounts of money. Instinct told him that both men knew more than they were telling. But so far, he couldn\u0027t prove it. \"Agent Williams has uncovered something interesting, though.\"\n Angelo Michele looked at Gavin Williams. The man gave him the creeps. He was more like a robot than a human being. When he spoke, it was in a monotone, studiously avoiding eye contact.\n \"It appears that in the week before his death, Leonard Brookstein changed the company structure at Quorum. Effectively, he arbitrarily stripped John Merrivale of his partnership status.\"\n \"Damn it.\" Angelo Michele shook is head.\n Harry Bain cocked his head to one side. \"That\u0027s bad?\"\n \"Sure. If Lenny Brookstein was the only legal partner, it\u0027ll be almost impossible to indict, much less prosecute, the other players. Short of seventy billion showing up sewn into Merrivale\u0027s suit pants, we\u0027re fucked.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t the only partner.\"\n \"But I thought you said...\"\n Gavin Williams sighed, like a grade-school teacher explaining something painfully simple to a seven-year-old. \"I said, Lenny stripped John of his shares. I didn\u0027t say he was the only partner. He didn\u0027t keep that equity. He transferred it.\"\n Angelo Michele\u0027s heart was racing. \"To who, for God\u0027s sake?\"\n Gavin Williams smiled.\n \"To his wife.\"\n DONNA SANCHEZ SAID GENTLY, \"ARE YOU sure you\u0027re ready, Mrs. Brookstein?\"\n Grace nodded. It doesn\u0027t matter. This is all a dream, a nightmare. When she pulls back the sheet, I\u0027ll wake up.\n \"We\u0027ll do this very quickly. Try to focus on the hand. If you recognize the wedding ring, that\u0027s all we need.\"\n Donna pulled back the sheet.\n Grace threw back her head and screamed.\n JOHN MERRIVALE STARED AT THE DOCUMENTS in front of him, rubbing his eyes with exhaustion.\n \"There must be some m-m-mistake.\"\n Harry Bain lit another cigarette. The smoke made John Merrivale feel nauseous. \"No mistake, John. This is Lenny\u0027s signature. And this is Grace\u0027s. You don\u0027t think we had them checked?\"\n The documents were legal instructions, changing Quorum\u0027s ownership structure. They transferred John\u0027s entire equity stake in the fund to Grace. They were dated June 8, the day before the Quorum Ball. Both Lenny and Grace had signed them.\n \"Face it, John. The Brooksteins ripped you off. They were planning to grab what was left of the money and run.\"\n \"No. Lenny wouldn\u0027t d-do that. N-n-not to me.\"\n \"Read it, John! It\u0027s right there in black and white. He did it. They did it, together. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time you stopped protecting them?\"\n John squeezed his eyes shut tight. It was so hard to think. How long have I been in this room? Three hours? Four? He thought about Grace, alone at the morgue. The police had refused to let him go with her. The poor girl would be terrified.\n \"Lenny had a l-legal right to restructure the company any way he chose. Quorum was his business.\"\n Harry Bain looked at him in disbelief. \"You\u0027re saying you don\u0027t mind that Lenny Brookstein robbed you blind?\"\n \"I\u0027m saying he didn\u0027t rob me.\"\n \"But he did. It\u0027s right here in black and white.\"\n \"He m-must have had his reasons then. Lenny\u0027s dead. He\u0027s not here to explain, to d-defend his good name.\"\n \"His good name?\" Harry Bain laughed out loud. \"Lenny Brookstein? The man was a crook, John. So was his wife. That much we know. The question is, what don\u0027t we know? What are you hiding from us?\"\n \"I\u0027m not h-hiding anything.\"\n \"Why are you protecting him?\"\n \"He was my friend.\" My only friend.\n \"He wasn\u0027t your friend. He used you, John. He used you from the beginning. Why do you think a brilliant guy like Lenny needed a schmuck like you on the team, huh? D\u0027you ever ask yourself that question?\"\n All the time.\n \"Because you gave him legitimacy, that\u0027s why. Because you were dumb and adoring and blindly loyal. Like a dog.\"\n John looked up. It was Harry Bain\u0027s face sneering at him, but the voice was Caroline\u0027s. You\u0027re a lapdog, John. You\u0027re pathetic! Stand up and be counted!\n \"No. I wasn\u0027t Lenny\u0027s d-d-dog. It wasn\u0027t like that.\"\n \"No? What were you, then? Because the way I see it you\u0027re either a fucking moron who couldn\u0027t see what was going on right under your nose. Or you knew.\"\n \"No. I d-didn\u0027t know anything.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe you. Where\u0027s the money, John?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Where\u0027d you stash it, huh? You and your good friend Lenny Brookstein. The guy who trusted you so much. Who relied on your advice. Where\u0027d you put the cash?\"\n \"I\u0027ve told you. I don\u0027t - \"\n \"Maybe it\u0027s Andrew Preston we should be talking to. Was Preston the one Lenny really trusted?\"\n \"Of course not. Lenny was always much c-closer to me than to Andrew.\"\n \"So close that he gave your shares to Grace?\"\n A high-pitched whistle in John\u0027s head was getting louder, like a boiling kettle.\n \"Where is it, John? Where\u0027s the money? If you weren\u0027t Lenny\u0027s little dog, prove it.\"\n The whistle was so loud, he thought his eardrums would shatter.\n \"WHERE\u0027S THE FUCKING MONEY, JOHN?\"\n \"I DON\u0027T KNOW!\" Slumped over the table, John Merrivale broke down in sobs. \"For G-God\u0027s sake, what\u0027s the matter with you? I don\u0027t know.\"\n On the other side of the two-way glass, Angelo Michele turned to the psychologist.\n \"What do you think?\"\n \"I think he\u0027s telling the truth. He doesn\u0027t know anything. When he saw that partnership document, it blew him away.\"\n Angelo Michele nodded. I agree.\n I wonder if that automaton Williams is having any more success with Grace?\n \"WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SIGNED these documents?\"\n Grace tried to focus. Still reeling from the shock of seeing Lenny\u0027s body, she found it hard to remember where she was. The gruff, gray-haired man sitting opposite her was from the FBI. He\u0027d arrested her as she left the morgue and driven her somewhere, but she couldn\u0027t remember where, or how long it had taken. Now she was in a white, windowless room. Images of Lenny\u0027s mutilated corpse flashed through her mind like a horror movie. The man kept talking.\n \"They\u0027re dated June eighth.\"\n Lenny\u0027s skin, waxy and white, like the stuff that covers the skin of a newborn baby.\n \"Mrs. Brookstein, these documents prove that you knowingly made yourself a partner in Quorum International LLC, with a view to profiting illicitly from illegal trades, made between 2004 and 2009.\"\n Lenny\u0027s swollen finger, the skin bursting around his wedding ring.\n \"What do you know about the whereabouts of the profits from the following transactions: 2005, Innovation Management\u0027s six-year fund of funds, executed in Grand Cayman?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know anything.\" Grace\u0027s voice was barely a whisper.\n Gavin Williams leaned across the table till his face was millimeters from hers. Grace smelled his sour breath. \"Don\u0027t lie to me, Mrs. Brookstein. You will regret it.\"\n Grace looked up and saw the compassionless void in his eyes. A cold stab of fear ran through her. \"I\u0027m not lying.\"\n \"You were a partner in your husband\u0027s fund.\"\n \"A partner? No. You\u0027re mistaken. I was never a partner. I don\u0027t know anything about business. It was Lenny and John.\"\n \"Do you deny this is your signature?\"\n Angrily, Gavin Williams shoved a piece of paper across the table. Grace recognized her own writing. But she couldn\u0027t for the life of her remember what the document was, when she\u0027d signed it or why. Lenny handled all of that.\n \"I don\u0027t deny anything. I...I\u0027m confused.\"\n Gavin Williams was shouting. \"Two thousand and five, Innovation, Grand Cayman!\"\n \"I want my attorney present.\" Grace was shocked to hear the words come out of her own mouth. I sound like a bad episode of Law \u0026 Order.\n \"What?\"\n \"I...I said I need a lawyer.\"\n Gavin Williams seethed with frustration. He\u0027d hoped that by catching Grace at such a vulnerable moment, he\u0027d be able to bully her into a confession, get her to break down. But if she wanted a lawyer, he could not deny her one. Bitch.\n \"Interview terminated. Turn off the tape.\"\n With a look of disgust, Gavin Williams left the room.\n THE FOLLOWING MORNING, NEWS OF GRACE Brookstein\u0027s arrest and the recovery of Lenny Brookstein\u0027s body was splashed all over the papers.\n Honor Warner shook as she read the report. \"They\u0027ve found Lenny\u0027s body.\"\n \"Yes, I know,\" said Jack, deadpan. \"I can read.\"\n \"How can you be so calm about it? The FBI has arrested Grace. Have you seen the list of charges? The things they\u0027re accusing her of: securities fraud, money laundering...Grace can barely add two plus two! What are we going to do?\"\n Jack smiled. \"Do? We\u0027re not going to do anything.\"\n \"But, Jack...\"\n \"But Jack, what? We\u0027re going to wash our hands of your little sister and walk away.\"\n Honor looked horrified. Jack laughed at her.\n \"Oh, please. Don\u0027t try to pretend to me that you care about Grace. It\u0027s a little late for that, darling. Did you think I couldn\u0027t see through you all these years?\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"You think I don\u0027t know how much you hate your sister? How much you\u0027ve always hated her?\"\n Honor looked away, ashamed. It\u0027s true. I do hate her. But to let her go to jail? She tried another tack. \"All right. Let\u0027s forget about Grace. What about us, Jack? If Grace goes on trial, there\u0027ll be questions. Questions about Lenny\u0027s business affairs, his associates, what happened the day he disappeared. What if the police find out?\"\n \"They won\u0027t.\"\n \"But what if they do?\"\n Jack looked at her coldly. \"Do you want to be first lady, Honor?\"\n Honor did want it. More than anything.\n \"Do you want to see me in the White House?\"\n \"Of course. You know I do.\"\n \"Then stop panicking. Keep your mouth shut and your head down. Lenny\u0027s dead. He can\u0027t hurt us anymore. But Grace could. God knows how much the old man may have told her.\"\n Honor shivered. She hadn\u0027t thought of that.\n \"Your sister going to jail could be the best thing to happen to us. Now pass me the coffee, would you? It\u0027s getting cold.\"\n MICHAEL GRAY WAS HORRIFIED WHEN HE heard the news. Instinctively he put his arms around Connie. \"I\u0027m so sorry, honey. Is there anything I can do?\"\n Connie shook her head. \"What can anyone do, Mike? Obviously, Lenny and Grace were not who we thought they were.\"\n Michael Gray looked surprised. \"You don\u0027t seriously think Grace is guilty of these charges, do you?\"\n Connie shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know what to think anymore. The world\u0027s gone mad.\"\n \"Yes, but money laundering? Grace?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so impossible about that. After all, look at Lenny. We all loved and respected him. But it turns out he was nothing but a thief and a coward.\"\n There was a venom in Connie\u0027s voice that Michael had never heard before. It frightened him.\n \"We all know Grace was obsessed with Lenny. Who knows what she might have done to protect him, or to help him?\"\n MARIA PRESTON TREATED GRACE\u0027S ARREST LIKE an exciting episode in one of her soap operas.\n \"The police are saying that Grace stole John Merrivale\u0027s partnership. That she and Lenny were planning to rip him off as well as the investors and run off with all the money! \u0027Grace Brookstein is the Quorum Fund\u0027s only living partner,\u0027 that\u0027s what it says here. \u0027That makes her legally responsible for all of Quorum\u0027s losses.\u0027 Can you believe that?\"\n Andrew couldn\u0027t believe it. He couldn\u0027t believe any of it. Since that fateful trip to Nantucket, he\u0027d barely slept.\n I\u0027ve been lucky so far. The FBI has bigger fish to fry. But the knock on the door will come eventually. I know it will.\n It wasn\u0027t exposure itself that scared him, or even prison. It was losing Maria. Everything he\u0027d done, he\u0027d done for her. And she thinks the whole thing\u0027s a game!\n \"I think I\u0027ll wear my new Dior to the trial. The fuchsia one.\"\n \"We\u0027re not going to the trial.\"\n \"Not going? But, Andy, everyone will be there.\"\n \"Jesus, Maria, it\u0027s not a fucking Broadway show!\" It was so rare for Andrew to lose his temper, Maria just stared at him. She rather liked this new, macho Andrew. \"Billions of dollars are missing. The feds are all over us like a rash. Everyone at Quorum\u0027s under suspicion.\"\n \"Well, they won\u0027t be anymore,\" said Maria cheerfully, cutting herself another slice of panettone. \"It looks like the FBI has found its sacrificial lamb. Sweet little butter-wouldn\u0027t-melt Gracie is going to jail.\"\n Andrew thought, I hope so, then realized what a terrible thought that was.\n When had he become so callous, so coldhearted?\n I don\u0027t recognize myself anymore. Oh, Maria! What have you done to me?\n \"YOU\u0027RE NOT GOING TO JAIL, GRACE. Let\u0027s get that straight from the get-go. You\u0027re innocent, and you\u0027re going to plead innocent. Okay?\"\n Grace nodded weakly. It was all so confusing.\n Frank Hammond seemed so upbeat. Not like her first lawyer, Kevin McGuire. Kevin was an old friend of Grace\u0027s parents from East Hampton. Grace called him the day she was arrested. She wanted him to rescue her from the bullying agent with the dead eyes, and he had. But once they were alone, he didn\u0027t pull his punches.\n \"As a full partner in Quorum, you\u0027re legally liable for Lenny\u0027s actions, whether you actually made any decisions or not,\" Kevin told her. \"You have to plead guilty.\"\n \"But I never even knew I was a partner.\"\n Kevin McGuire was sympathetic, but firm. Ignorance might be a moral defense, but it wasn\u0027t a legal one. \"You signed the contract, Grace. If you don\u0027t take responsibility, the judge may be even harsher at sentencing.\" He was firm about bail, too. \"My advice is not to seek it.\"\n Grace couldn\u0027t believe it. \"You mean...you want me to stay in jail? But it could be months before the case gets to court.\"\n \"It will be months. And I know it\u0027s tough. But believe me, Grace, you\u0027re safer in there. I don\u0027t think you fully appreciate the anger people feel toward you and Lenny.\"\n He was right. Grace didn\u0027t. Apart from the small crowd who heckled her when she left her apartment to stay with the Merrivales, she\u0027d had little or no direct contact with the outside world since she returned to New York. John refused to let her watch the TV reports, and did not allow newspapers in the house. The day after the coroner officially ruled Lenny\u0027s death a suicide, Kevin McGuire had shown Grace some of the headlines she\u0027d been shielded from.\n BROOKSTEIN TOOK COWARD\u0027S WAY OUT\n \"DESPICABLE\" CON MAN COMMITS SUICIDE, CHEATS JUSTICE\n BROOKSTEINS \"MOST HATED COUPLE IN AMERICA\"\n A week ago, the headlines would have shocked her. Now, having been through the horror of identifying Lenny\u0027s body, Grace doubted anything would have the power to shock her ever again. Instead she felt numb. Dissociated.\n Are they talking about Lenny? About me? How can people hate us? We haven\u0027t done anything wrong.\n As for the idea of Lenny committing suicide, well, that was just ludicrous. Anyone who had ever met him knew that Lenny loved life. He would have clung to life to the bitter end, no matter what. It was an accident, a freak storm. No one could have predicted what happened that day.\n Kevin McGuire kept trying to get her to focus on the present, to acknowledge the fact that she may well be sent to prison. But Kevin didn\u0027t understand. Prison didn\u0027t frighten Grace. It didn\u0027t matter what happened to her. Without Lenny, nothing mattered anymore. The world could hold no joy for Grace, no hope. They may as well lock me up. My life\u0027s already over.\n Once again, it was John Merrivale who had ridden to her rescue and made her see sense. The whole world was accusing Grace of betraying him, of conspiring with Lenny to \"steal\" his stake in Quorum, but John\u0027s loyalty remained unwavering. \"It\u0027s a mistake, Grace, all right? A mistake. I don\u0027t know why Lenny d-did it, but he must have had his reasons.\"\n \"You know he would never have tried to cheat you John. Neither of us would.\"\n \"Of c-course I do, sweetheart. Of course I do.\"\n When John heard the advice Kevin McGuire was giving Grace, he forced her to fire him on the spot.\n \"But Kevin\u0027s an old friend,\" Grace protested.\n \"I daresay. But he\u0027s talking nonsense. P-plead guilty indeed! That\u0027s insanity. We need to get you Frank Hammond. He\u0027s the best.\"\n John was right, as usual. Frank Hammond burst into Grace\u0027s life like a cyclone. From the moment she met him, Grace felt her hope returning. She began to see light at the end of the tunnel. Here, at last, was her champion, a strong man, an advocate, someone who believed her and would fight for her. Just being in Frank Hammond\u0027s presence made Grace feel better.\n She asked shyly, \"What about bail? Do you think there\u0027s any chance...?\"\n \"I\u0027ve already applied. The hearing\u0027s tomorrow. I\u0027m going to get you out of here.\"\n \"You do realize I...I don\u0027t have any money. I can\u0027t pay you.\"\n Grace was embarrassed, but Frank Hammond was unfazed.\n \"Forget it. It\u0027s taken care of. Now I want you to listen to me. Can you do that?\"\n Grace nodded.\n \"Forget about the charges against you. Forget about the trial, forget about what people out there are saying. It\u0027s my job to straighten all that out. Understood?\"\n \"Understood.\" He\u0027s so reassuring. I feel like I\u0027m talking to Lenny.\n \"Your job is to hold on tight to the truth. You did not steal any money. Lenny did not steal any money. The fact that a whole bunch of money has gone missing means that someone must have stolen it. Whoever that person is framed you and your husband. That\u0027s our case.\"\n \"But who would do that?\"\n Frank Hammond smiled, revealing a row of jagged, yellowing, old man\u0027s teeth. Clearly he did not spend any of his astronomical fees at the dentist\u0027s office.\n \"Who would steal seventy billion dollars? Ninety-nine percent of Americans, if they thought they could get away with it.\"\n \"All right, then. Who did steal it?\"\n \"I have no idea. It doesn\u0027t matter. All we need to do is establish reasonable doubt. The D.A. has to prove that you and your husband were responsible.\"\n Grace was silent. After a few moments, she asked, \"Mr. Hammond, do you believe my husband killed himself?\"\n Frank Hammond looked his client directly in the eye. \"No, Mrs. Brookstein. I do not.\"\n From that moment on, Grace knew she could trust Frank Hammond implicitly. He\u0027s going to win the case. He\u0027s going to set me free. And when he does, I\u0027m going to find out who stole that money and clear Lenny\u0027s name. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-9.html","bookId":2373,"book":{"id":2373,"title":"After the Darkness","description":"Storyline: \n Grace Brookstein lived a luxurious lifestyle despite the economic free fall in the US.
