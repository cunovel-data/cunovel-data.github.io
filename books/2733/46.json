{"id":80955,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"“Camden,” I heard Gus groan from behind me. I kept the gun at Javier’s head and looked at him. He was lying back and holding onto his stomach, blood running from his mouth.\n “Stay cool, Gus, I’ll get an ambulance,” I told him.\n “You go get Ellie,” he said, barely getting out the words. “I’ll be fine.”\n I turned and looked at Javier, hoping I could burn him alive with my eyes. “I’m going to go after Ellie. I’m only letting you live so you can get Gus to the hospital. If he dies, it’s on you. And I’m going to be sure that Ellie knows about it.”\n He swallowed hard and for a second I worried that Javier might die before Gus. A strange thing to worry about. I decided to call the ambulance on my way to Travis’s, just to be sure. I couldn’t trust this man for anything, not even to stay alive when I needed him to.\n I got to my feet. “Do you understand?”\n He nodded, breathing hard, his nostrils flaring.\n “On second thought.” I pointed the gun at him and for once he looked like I might pull the trigger. He was actually afraid of me. “I could just kill you now and be done with you and call an ambulance myself.”\n I held it there for a few moments, pointed at him with all the fire inside me, before I lowered the gun and walked over to Gus, kneeling down beside him. His face was white, his eyes dull but he was alert and looking at me. I patted him on the arm and gave it a good squeeze.\n “You’re going to be fine, Gus.” I pulled the cell phone out of his pocket and eyed Javier who was still lying there, propped up against the wall like a rag doll. I nodded at him. “Tell me where Travis lives, Javier.”\n He seemed to grapple with the information, as if he wasn’t going to give it to me and for a second I thought maybe he really would let Ellie go on this suicide mission. But he motioned for me to bring the cell over.\n I handed it to him and with a bloody hand he began to enter an address into the GPS. He handed it back to me as the new coordinates began triangulating. A flashing red dot.\n “You go in there like this, you’re going to get yourself killed before you even step foot on the property,” he sneered. “You can’t do this alone.”\n “You let me worry about me,” I said. I got up, loomed over him. “And if I ever see your face again, I will kill you. You won’t know when it will happen, but it will happen.”\n We stared at each other for a few tense seconds, his yellow, poisonous eyes hating every inch of me. I was sure my look was no different.\n I tore my eyes away and glanced over at Gus. I swallowed hard, praying this wasn’t the last time I’d see him.\n “I’ll see you in a bit, Gus,” I told him. Then I turned on my heel and started running for the GTO. Running for Ellie.\n CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN\n ELLIE\n Once I went back to the hotel and saw that Enrico wasn’t at the desk, I went upstairs and started going down the hallway, calling out for Gus and Camden, hoping they were in one of the hotel rooms. I needed to warn them, to get to them before Javier did. But they weren’t anywhere and when I went back downstairs and asked the front desk lady if she could call them for me, there was no answer on their end.\n They would have seen the device going off with Javier and thought it was me, deviating from the plan. Now there was a whole new plan, one that Gus and Camden were walking straight into. I hoped to god that Javier would keep his word and only kill Camden if I didn’t go through with the assassination. I should have made him promise it.\n That was the only thing that kept me going, kept me putting one foot in front of the other, the fact that if I did everything I was told, they could be saved. And Gus, dear sweet old Gus, he wasn’t an idiot – he was a trained cop and a hell of a lot of other things. He was the wildcard, someone that Javier wouldn’t be expecting when Camden turned up.\n I got out of the shower, trying to calm my breath and keep my limbs from shaking, trying to go ahead and do the things I needed to do to survive and get out of this. I picked out a dress from the closet, the place where Camden had hidden, watching out for me, never obvious but always there. The dress was long, green and glittery like mermaid scales which would have made me feel absolutely beautiful if I was wearing it at any other time but now it was just a cloak for my murder, a means to an end.\n I pinned my hair up and made my makeup look sweet and sexy. I’d definitely act the part tonight. I was no longer afraid. I was determined to carry this out. I would get rid of him and then figure out a way to get myself out of there and back to Camden and Gus somehow. Through hell and high water, they found me. I could find them. I’d been through worse.\n I eyed the necklace hoping it would hold together and keep my secrets hidden. Those dirty angel wings. So Javier thought I was rotten too. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised, he’d been telling me how bad I was all this time.\n At five thirty I went out to the lobby where Enrico was still nowhere to be found. Funny how he disappeared all of a sudden. I wondered if that was because Travis was coming here or perhaps Javier had called all of his troops to deal with Camden and Gus.\n I swallowed hard and started sliding the pendant up and down the chain. No fear. I could do this. This would be done.\n A white limousine pulled up outside and the driver came into the lobby, elegantly dressed with a jaunty cap and dark glasses. He called out, “Eleanor Willis.”\n I paused, waiting a moment, letting the fake name sink on me, before I stood up and gathered my black shawl around me. “That’s me.”\n The driver showed the way to the limo. It had been raining on and off all day and it was just starting to sputter again, the wind driving it into my face. I had put on waterproof mascara, insurance against the weather and against any tears I knew I’d be shedding for whatever reason. I wouldn’t get out of this day without tears or blood.\n The driver pointed to the heavy, dark sky and said, “It will be sunny tomorrow.”\n I gave him a sad smile. I doubted tomorrow would be anything but sunny. I got in the back of the spacious limo, somewhat surprised that Travis wasn’t in the back.\n “Are we meeting Mr. Raines at the restaurant?” I asked.\n He shook his head. “Mr. Raines is having dinner at his house. He is there already tending to his guests. He is having a dinner party.”\n I sat back, stunned. A dinner party? How the fuck was I going to escape from a dinner party? How was Javier going to get me, let alone anyone else?\n And just like that, I’d let the fear back in. Maybe this really was a suicide mission. Maybe it was always planned this way. Ellie Watt, the sacrifice that everyone loved to make.\n My heart cried out for Camden, the only one who never saw me that way. I held my head back, staring at the lights on the roof of the limo, trying to keep the tears back. I stayed like that the entire drive until the limo pulled off the main streets of Veracruz and started to head inland toward a group of low hills, lush with greenery and the heavily gated mansions sprinkled throughout like hard candy.\n Travis’s place was at the end of a very long and narrow cobblestone street lined with flowers that seemed too bright for nature and palm trees that stretched as tall as the eyes could see. It was like entering a tunnel but there was no light at the end of it.\n The limo paused at the extremely large gates where the driver waved something at the man at the booth. The man came out and the rear window went down. He looked in the back, at me, and then nodded. He returned to the booth and the gates opened for us.\n Travis’s house took my breath away. I didn’t want it to, but it did. It was so much more impressive than the one I had to sneak into as a child. It was beyond sprawling, with many wings and beautiful balconies, shinning white and gold under the lights. The dark clouds billowed above it. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the skies opened above it and Satan came fluttering down on black wings.\n The limo climbed up the long, sweeping driveway and stopped in front of the door, where the carpeted steps led up into the hall made of granite and marble. It was like a Hollywood movie premiere and there were beautifully dressed people everywhere. The driver held the door open for me.\n I smiled in thanks and got out, saying, “This is pretty big for a dinner party.”\n “Oh this is only the cocktail pre-party. The dinner party is for very special guests. It comes later. You should feel privileged that Mr. Raines has invited you, Miss Willis.”\n I studied the man, someone’s father or grandfather, who seemed to have no problem working for one the most vile men in the country. Maybe that’s what you had to do here to survive. Maybe these people were no different from me. Trying to turn a blind eye to what they knew was wrong, shielding their hearts, trying to live another day.\n I walked up to the door, getting curious but pleasant glances from Veracruz’s elite. The men admired my breasts, the women envied my dress. A bodyguard, the man I recognized as the bouncer from The Zoo, had a list and was checking names.\n “Your name?” he asked.\n “Eleanor Willis,” I said. “I didn’t bring my passport.”\n “That’s okay, I am just checking.”\n I smiled at him. “Oh good. My friend Connor Malloy might be coming here later.”\n “Is he on the list?”\n I peered over at the list. “He should be.”\n The man scanned it. “Doesn’t have his name here.”\n “Well, I’ll speak to Travis about it. He’ll be an American, tall, black hair, tattoos, glasses. Like a hot muscly nerd.”\n The man nodded absently not really caring. “Check with Travis please.”\n Then he looked at the next person coming up the stairs. I moved past him, chewing on my lip. I had no idea if Camden would show up here, how he’d get away from Javier, how he’d even figure out where I was. But if it did happen, I hoped I would give him just a little bit of help, maybe a few seconds bought.\n Suddenly a woman all in black appeared in front of me, waving a metal detector. “Miss, we need to check you.”\n I nodded my thoughts racing to my necklace. My nipple ring beeped first, prompting another somewhat embarrassing explanation considering this woman was in her late fifties and seemed disgusted by the whole idea. Then the necklace beeped. The woman rang the detector over it again and then lifted it off my collar bone, feeling it underneath.\n I held my breath, trying to seem normal, trying to act like everything wasn’t resting in her hands. It didn’t say poison on the capsule but I still had a feeling it would get bad for me. At the very least she’d confiscate it thinking it some sort of drug and then what did I have. My only hope was that drugs weren’t so taboo at a party in a drug lord’s house.\n But the woman pressed the necklace back into my neck and smiled at it. “Precioso,” she said and let me go.\n I got far enough away from her before I exhaled loudly, letting it all out. That was close. I was in and I was okay but I didn’t know for how much longer. I needed to hold it together.\n Too late for that.\n The crowd parted and Travis Raines appeared in front of me in a tuxedo, his bodyguards on all sides of him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shooting-scars-the-artists-trilogy-2/page-46.html","bookId":2733,"book":{"id":2733,"title":"Shooting Scars (The Artists Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Shooting Scars (The Artists Trilogy #2) \n A Dangerous Kind of Love . . . \n When Ellie Watt offered herself to her thuggish former lover Javier to save Camden\u0027s life, she never imagined the twisted game Javier had planned for her.
