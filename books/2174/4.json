{"id":99286,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027Twenty-two,\u0027 the computer nurse said. \u0027Twenty-one nine... twenty-two... twenty-one nine... twenty-two one... twenty-two two... twenty-two one... twenty-two two... twenty-two three... twenty-two four... twenty-two three... twenty-two four... twenty-two five... twenty- two six... twenty-two five...\u0027 Potter felt the see-saw battle through every nerve. The morula was down at the edge of the death range. It could live or it could die in the next few minutes. Or it could come out of this crippled. Such things happened. When the flaw was too gross, the vat was turned off, flushed out. But Potter felt an identification with this embryo now. He felt he couldn\u0027t afford to lose it. \u0027Mutagen desensitizer,\u0027 he said. Svengaard hesitated. The Krebs cycle was following a slow sine curve that dipped perilously into the death cycle now. He knew why Potter had made his decision, but the carcinogenic peril of it had to be weighed. He wondered if he should argue the step. The embryo hung less than four points from a deadly plunge into dissolution. Chemical mutagens administered at this point could shock it into a spun of growth or destroy it. Even if the mutagen treatment worked, it could leave the embryo susceptible to cancer. \u0027Mutagen desensitizer!\u0027 Potter repeated. \u0027Dosage?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Half minim on fractional-minim feed. I\u0027ll control it from here.\u0027 Svengaard shifted the feeder keys, his eyes on the Krebs-cycle repeater. He\u0027d never heard of applying such drastic treatment this close to the borderline. Mutagens usually were reserved for the partly-flawed Sterrie embryo, a move that sometimes produced dramatic results. It was like shaking a bucket of sand to level the grains. Sometimes the germ plasm presented with a mutagen sought a better level on its own. They\u0027d even produced an occasional viable this way... but never an Optiman. Potter reduced amplification, studied the flow of movement in the embryo. Gently, he depressed the feeder key, searched for Optiman signs. The cellular action remained unsteady, partly blurred. \u0027Krebs cycle twenty-two eight,\u0027 the computer nurse said. Climbing a bit. Potter thought. \u0027Very slow,\u0027 Svengaard said. Potter maintained his vigil within the morula. It was growing, expanding in fits and starts, fighting with all the enormous power contracted in its tiny domain. \u0027Krebs cycle thirty point four,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027I am withdrawing mutagens,\u0027 Potter said. He backed off the microscope to a peripheral cell, desensitized the nucleo-proteins, searched for the flawed configurations. The cell was clean. Potter traced down into the coiled-coil helices of the DNA chains with a dawning wonder. \u0027Krebs cycle thirty-six eight and climbing,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Shall I start the choline and aneurin?\u0027. Potter spoke automatically, his attention fixed on the cell\u0027s gene structure. \u0027Yes, start them.\u0027 He completed the scope tracing, shifted to another peripheral cell. Identical. Another cell - the same. The altered gene pattern held true, but it was a pattern, Potter realized, which hadn\u0027t been seen in humankind since the second century of gene shaping. He thought of calling for a comparison to be sure. The computer would have it, of course. No record was ever lost or thrown away. But he dared not... there was too much at stake in this. He knew he didn\u0027t need the comparison, though. This was a classic form, a classroom norm which he had stared at almost daily all through his medical education. The super-genius pattern that had caused Sven to call in a Central specialist was there, firmed up by the cutting-room adjustments. It was close-coupled, though, with a fully stable fertility pattern. The longevity basics lay locked in the configurations of the gene structure. If this embryo reached maturity and encountered a fertile mate, it could breed healthy, living children without the interference of the genes surgeon. It needed no enzyme prescription to survive. It would outlive ten standard humans without that prescription... and with a few delicate enzymic adjustments might join the ranks of the immortals. The Durant embryo could father a new race - like the live-forevers of Central, but dramatically unlike them. This embryo\u0027s progeny might fit themselves into the rhythms of natural selectivity... completely outside Optiman control. It was the template pattern from which no human could deviate too far and live, yet it was the single thing feared most by Central. Every gene surgeon had this drummed into him during his education, \u0027Natural selectivity is a madness that sends its human victims groping blindly through empty lives.\u0027 Optiman reason and Optiman logic must do the selecting. As though he straddled Time, Potter felt the profound certainty that the Durant embryo, if it matured, would encounter a fertile mate. This embryo had received a gift from outside -a wealth of sperm-arginine, the key to its fertility pattern. In the flood of mutagen which opened the active centers of the DNA, this embryo\u0027s gene patterns had shaken down into a stable form no human dared attempt. Why did I introduce the mutagens just then? Potter wondered. I knew it was the needed thing. How did I know? Was I an instrument of some other force? \u0027Krebs cycle fifty-eight and climbing steadily,\u0027 Svengaard said. Potter longed for the freedom to discuss this problem with Svengaard... but there were the damnable parents and the Security people... watching. Was it possible anyone else had seen enough and knew enough of this pattern to realize what had happened here? he wondered. Why did I introduce the mutagens? \u0027Can you see the pattern yet?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Not yet,\u0027 Potter lied. The embryo was growing rapidly now. Potter studied the proliferation of stable cells. It was beautiful. \u0027Krebs cycle sixty-four seven,\u0027 Svengaard said. I\u0027ve waited too long. Potter thought. The big domes of Central will ask why I waited so long to kill this embryo. I cannot kill it! It\u0027s too beautiful. Central maintained its power by keeping the world at large in ignorance of the ruling fist, by doling out living time in the form of precious enzyme prescriptions to its half-alive slaves. The Folk had a saying: \u0027In this world there are two worlds - one that works not and lives forever; one that lives not and works forever.\u0027 Here in a crystal vat lay a tiny ball of cells, a living creature less than six-tenths of a millimeter in diameter, and it carried the full potential of living out its life beyond Central\u0027s control. This morula had to die. They\u0027ll order it killed. Potter thought. And I will be suspect... finished. And if this thing did get loose in the world, what then? What would happen to gene surgery? Would we go back to correcting the minor defects... the way it was before we started shaping supermen? Supermen! In his mind, he did what no voice could do: he cursed the Optimen. They were enormous power, instant life or death. Many were geniuses. But they were as dependent on the enzymic fractions as any clod of the Sterries or Breeders. There were men as brilliant among the Sterries and Breeders... and among the surgeons. But none of these could live forever, secure in that ultimate brutal power. \u0027Krebs cycle one hundred even,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027We\u0027re over the top now,\u0027 Potter said. He risked a glance at the computer nurse, but she had her back to him, fussing with her board. Without that computer record, it might be possible to conceal what had happened here. With that record open to examination by Security and by the Optimen, it could not be hidden. Svengaard had not seen enough. The forehead lens only approximated the full field of vision. The vat nurses couldn\u0027t even guess at it. Only the computer nurse with her tiny monitor screen might know... and the full record lay in her machine now - a pattern of magnetic waves on strips of tape. \u0027That\u0027s the lowest I\u0027ve ever seen it go without killing the embryo,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027How low?\u0027 Potter asked. \u0027Twenty-one nine,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Twenty\u0027s bottom, of course, but I\u0027ve never heard of an embryo coming back from below twenty-five before, have you. Doctor?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Is it the pattern we want?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027I don\u0027t want to interfere too much yet,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Of course,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Whatever happens, it was inspired surgery.\u0027 Inspired surgery! Potter thought. What would this dolt say if I told him what I have here? A totally viable embryo! A total. Kill it, he\u0027d say. It\u0027ll need no enzyme prescription and it can breed true. It hasn\u0027t a defect.. not one. Kill it, he\u0027d say. He\u0027s a dutiful slave. The whole sorry history of gene shaping could be justified by this one embryo. But the minute they see this tape at Central, the embryo will be destroyed. Eliminate it, they\u0027ll say... because they don\u0027t like to use words too close to kill or death. Potter bent to the scope. How lovely the embryo was in its own terrifying way. He risked another glance at the computer nurse. She turned, mask down, met his gaze, smiled. It was a knowing, secretive smile, the smile of a conspirator. Now, she reached up to mop the perspiration from her face. Her sleeve brushed a switch. A rasping whirring scream came from the computer board. She whirled to it, grated, \u0027Oh, my God!\u0027 Her hands sped over the board, but tape continued to hiss through the transponder plates. She turned, tried to wrestle the transparent cover from the recording console. The big reels whirled madly under the cover plate. \u0027It\u0027s running wild!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027It\u0027s locked on Erase!\u0027 Svengaard yelled. He jumped to her side, tried to get the cover plate off. It jammed in its tracks. Potter watched like a man in a trance as the last of the tape flashed through the heads, began whipping on the take-up reels. \u0027Oh, Doctor, we\u0027ve lost it!\u0027 the computer nurse wailed. Potter focused on the little monitor screen at the computer nurse\u0027s station. Did she watch the operation closely? he asked himself. Sometimes they follow the cut move by move... and computer nurses are a savvy lot. If she watched, she\u0027ll have a good idea what we achieved. At the very least, she\u0027ll suspect. Was that tape erasure really an accident? Do I dare? She turned, met his gaze. \u0027Oh, Doctor, I\u0027m so sorry,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s all right, nurse,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027There\u0027s nothing very special about this embryo now, aside from the fact that it will live.\u0027 \u0027We missed it, eh?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Must\u0027ve been the mutagens.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027But without them it\u0027d have died.\u0027 Potter stared at the nurse. He couldn\u0027t be sure, but he thought he saw a profound relief wash over her features. \u0027I\u0027ll cut a verbal tape of the operation,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027That should be enough on this embryo.\u0027 And he thought. When does a conspiracy begin? Was this such a beginning? There was still so much this conspiracy required. No knowledgeable eye could ever again look at this embryo through the microscope without being a part of the conspiracy... or a traitor. \u0027We still have the protein synthesis tape,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027That\u0027ll give us the chemical factors by reference - and the timing.\u0027 Potter thought about the protein synthesis tape. Was there danger in it? No, it was only a reference for what had been used in the operation... not how anything had been used. \u0027So it will,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027So it will.\u0027 He gestured to the monitor screen. \u0027Operation\u0027s finished. You can cut the direct circuit and escort the parents to the reception room. I\u0027m very sorry we achieved no more than we did, but this\u0027ll be a healthy human.\u0027 \u0027Sterrie?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Too soon to guess,\u0027 Potter said. He looked at the computer nurse. She managed to get the cover off at last and had stopped the tapes. \u0027Any idea how that happened?\u0027 \u0027Probably a solonoid failure,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027This equipment\u0027s quite old,\u0027 the nurse said. \u0027I\u0027ve asked for replacement units several times, but we don\u0027t seem to be very high on the priority lists.\u0027 And there\u0027s a natural reluctance at Central to admit anything can wear out. Potter thought. \u0027Yes,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Well, I daresay you\u0027ll get your replacements now.\u0027 Did anyone else see her trip that switch? Potter wondered. He tried to remember where everyone in the room had been looking, worried that a Security monitor might\u0027ve been watching her. If Security saw that, she\u0027s dead. Potter thought. And so am I. \u0027The technician\u0027s report on repairs will have to be part of the record on this case,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027I presume you\u0027ll- \u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll see to it personally. Doctor,\u0027 she said, Turning away. Potter had the impression that he and the computer nurse had just carried on a silent conversation. He noted that the big screen was now a gray blank, the Durants no longer watching. Should I see them myself? he wondered. If they\u0027re part of the Underground, they could help. Something has to be done about the embryo. Safest to get it out of here entirely... but how? \u0027I\u0027ll take care of the tie-off details,\u0027 Svengaard said. He began checking the vat seals, life systems repeaters, dismantling the meson generator. Someone has to see the parents. Potter thought. \u0027The parents\u0027ll be disappointed,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027They generally know why a specialist is called in... and probably got their hopes up.\u0027 The door from the ready room opened to admit a man Potter recognized as an agent from Central Security. He was a moonfaced blond with features one tended to forget five minutes after leaving him. The man crossed the room to stand in front of Potter. Is this the end for me? Potter wondered. He forced his voice into a steady casual tone, asked, \u0027What about the parents?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re clean,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027No tricky devices - conversation normal... plenty of small talk, but normal.\u0027 \u0027No hint of the other things?\u0027 Potter asked. \u0027Any way they could\u0027ve penetrated Security without instruments?\u0027 \u0027Impossible!\u0027 the man snorted. \u0027Doctor Svengaard believes the father\u0027s overly endowed with male protectiveness and the mother has too much maternalisms,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027The records show you shaped \u0027em,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027It\u0027s possible,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Sometimes you have to concentrate on gross elements of the cut to save the embryo. Little things slip past.\u0027 \u0027Anything slip past on this one today?\u0027 the agent asked. \u0027I understand the tape\u0027s been erased... an accident.\u0027 Does he suspect? Potter asked himself. The extent of his own involvement and personal danger threatened to overwhelm Potter. It took the greatest effort to maintain a casual tone. \u0027Anything\u0027s possible of course,\u0027 Potter said. He shrugged. \u0027But I don t think we have anything unusual here. We lost the Optishape in saving the embryo, but that happens. We can\u0027t win them all.\u0027 \u0027Should we flag the embryo\u0027s record?\u0027 the agent asked. He\u0027s still fishing. Potter told himself. He said, \u0027Suit yourself. I\u0027ll have a verbal tape on the cut pretty soon - probably just as accurate as the visual one. You might wait and analyze that before you decide.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the agent said. Svengaard had the microscope off the vat now. Potter relaxed slightly. No one was going to take a casual, dangerous look at the embryo. \u0027I guess we brought you on a wild goose chase,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Sorry about that, but they did insist on watching.\u0027 \u0027Better ten wild goose chases than one set of parents knowing too much,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027How was the tape erased?\u0027 \u0027Accident,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Worn equipment. We\u0027ll have the technical report for you shortly.\u0027 \u0027Leave the worn equipment thing out of your report,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027I\u0027ll take that verbally. Allgood has to show every report to the Tuyere now.\u0027 Potter permitted himself an understanding nod. \u0027Of course.\u0027 The men who worked out of Central knew about such things. One concealed personally disquieting items from the Optimen. The agent glanced around the cutting room, said, \u0027Someday we won\u0027t have to use all this secrecy. Won\u0027t come any too soon for me.\u0027 He turned away. Potter watched the retreating back, thinking how neatly the agent fitted into the demands of his profession. A superb cut with just one flaw - too neat a fit, too much cold logic, not enough imaginative curiosity and readiness to explore the avenues of chance. If he\u0027d pressed me, he\u0027d have had me. Potter thought. He should\u0027ve been more curious about the accident. But we tend to copy our masters - even in their blind spots. Potter began to have more confidence of success in his impetuous venture. He turned back to help Svengaard with the final details, wondering. How do I know the agent\u0027s satisfied with my explanation. No feeling of disquiet accompanied the question. If know he\u0027s satisfied, but how do I know it? Potter asked himself. He realized then that his mind had been absorbing correlated gene information - the inner workings of the cells and their exterior manifestations - for so many years that this weight of data had fused into a new level of understanding. He was reading the tiny betrayals in gene- type reactions.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-4.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
