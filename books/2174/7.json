He rubbed sweaty palms against his best tunic. Nourse spoke with a rumbling voice, \u0027You are the genetic engineer, Svengaard.\u0027 \u0027Thei Svengaard, yes... Nourse.\u0027 He took a deep breath wondering if they\u0027d caught the hesitation while he remembered to use the Optiman\u0027s name. Nourse smiled. \u0027You assisted recently in the genetic alterations of an embryo from a couple named Durant,\u0027 Nourse said. The chief engineer at the cutting was Potter.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I was the assistant, Nourse.\u0027 \u0027There was an accident during this operation,\u0027 Calapine said. There was a strange musical quality in her voice, and Svengaard recognized she hadn\u0027t asked a question, but had reminded him of a detail to which she wanted him to give his attention. He felt the beginnings of a profound disquiet. \u0027An accident, yes... Calapine,\u0027 he said. \u0027You followed the operation closely?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027Yes, Nourse.\u0027 And Svengaard found his attention swinging to Schruille, who sat there brooding and silent. \u0027Now then,\u0027 Calapine said, \u0027you will be able to tell us what it is Potter has concealed about this genetic alteration.\u0027 Svengaard found that he had lost his voice. He could only shake his head. \u0027He concealed nothing?\u0027 Nourse asked. Ts that what you say?\u0027 Svengaard nodded. \u0027We mean you no harm, Thei Svengaard,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027You may speak.\u0027 Svengaard swallowed, cleared his throat. \u0027I...\u0027 he said. \u0027... the question... I saw nothing... concealed.\u0027 He fell silent, then remembered he was supposed to use her name and said, \u0027Calapine,\u0027 just as Nourse started to speak. Nourse broke off, scowled. Calapine giggled. Nourse said, \u0027Yet you tell us you followed the genetic alteration.\u0027 \u0027I... wasn\u0027t on the microscope with him every second,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Nourse. I... uh... the duties of the assistant - instructions to the computer nurse, keying the feeder tapes and so on.\u0027 \u0027Say now if the computer nurse was a special friend of yours,\u0027 Calapine ordered. \u0027I... she\u0027d...\u0027 Svengaard wet his lips with his tongue. What do they want? \u0027We\u0027d worked together for a number of years, Calapine. I can\u0027t say she was a friend. We worked together.\u0027 \u0027Did you examine the embryo after the operation?\u0027 Nourse asked. Schruille sat up, stared at Svengaard. \u0027No, Nourse,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027My duties were to secure the vat, check life support systems.\u0027 He took a deep breath. Perhaps they were only testing him after all... but such odd questions! \u0027Say now if Potter is a special friend,\u0027 Calapine ordered. \u0027He was one of my teachers, Calapine, someone I\u0027ve worked with on delicate genetic problems.\u0027 \u0027But not in your particular circle,\u0027 Nourse said. Svengaard shook his head. Again, he sensed menace. He didn\u0027t know what to expect - perhaps that the great globe would roll over, crush him, reduce his body to scattered atoms. But no, the Optimen couldn\u0027t do that. He studied the three faces as they became clear through the power curtains, seeking a sign. Clean, sterile faces. He could see the genetic markers in their features - they might be any Sterries of the Folk except for the Optiman aura of mystery. Folk rumor said they were sterile by choice, that they saw breeding as the beginning of death, but the genetic clues of their features spoke otherwise to Svengaard. \u0027Why did you call Potter on this particular problem?\u0027 Nourse asked. Svengaard took a tight, quavering breath, said. \u0027He... the embryo\u0027s genetic configuration... near Opt. Potter is familiar with our hospital. He... I have confidence in him; brilliant sur - genetic engineer.\u0027 \u0027Say now if you are friendly with any other of our pharmacists,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027They... I work with them when they come to our facility,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Calapine,\u0027 Nourse supplied. A trill of laughter shook her. A dark flush spread up from Svengaard\u0027s collar. He began to feel angry. What kind of test was this? Couldn\u0027t they do anything but sit there, mocking, questioning? Anger gave Svengaard command of his voice and he said, \u0027I\u0027m only head of genetic engineering at one facility, Nourse -a lowly district engineer. I handle routine cuttings. When something requires a specialist, I follow orders, call a specialist. Potter was the indicated specialist for this case.\u0027 \u0027One of the specialists,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027One I know and respect,\u0027 Svengaard said. He didn\u0027t bother adding the Optiman\u0027s name. \u0027Say now if you are angry,\u0027 Calapine ordered, and there was that musical quality in her voice. \u0027I\u0027m angry.\u0027 \u0027Say why.\u0027 \u0027Why am I here?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027What kind of interrogation is this? Have I done something wrong? Am I to be censured?\u0027 Nourse bent forward, hands on knees. \u0027You dare question us?\u0027 Svengaard stared at the Optiman. In spite of the tone of the question, the square, heavy- boned face appeared reassuring, calming. \u0027I\u0027ll do anything I can to help you,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Anything. But how can I help or answer you when I don\u0027t know what you want?\u0027 Calapine started to speak, but stopped as Nourse raised a hand. \u0027Our most profound wish is that we could tell you,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027But surely you know we can have no true discourse. How could you understand what we understand? Can a wooden bowl contain sulphuric acid? Trust us. We seek what is best for you.\u0027 A sense of warmth and gratitude permeated Svengaard. Of course he trusted them. They were the genetic apex of humankind. And he reminded himself: \u0027They are the power that loves us and cares for us.\u0027 Svengaard sighed. \u0027What do you wish of me?\u0027 \u0027You have answered all our questions,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Even our non-questions are answered.\u0027 \u0027Now, you will forget everything that has happened here between us,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027You will repeat our conversation to no person.\u0027 Svengaard cleared his throat. To no one... Calapine?\u0027 \u0027No one.\u0027 \u0027Max Allgood has asked that I report to him on-\u0027 \u0027Max must be denied,\u0027 she said. \u0027Fear not, Thei Svengaard. We will protect you.\u0027 \u0027As you command,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Calapine.\u0027 \u0027It is not our wish that you think us ungrateful of your loyalty and services,\u0027 Nourse said, \u0027We are mindful of your good opinion and would not appear cold nor callous in your eyes. Know that our concern is for the larger good of humankind.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Nourse,\u0027 Svengaard said. It was a gratuitous speech, its tone disturbing to Svengaard, but it helped clear his reason. He began to see the direction of their curiosity, to sense their suspicions. Those were his suspicions now. Potter had betrayed his trust, had he? The business with the accidentally destroyed tape had not been an accident. Very well - the criminals would pay. \u0027You may go now,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027With our blessing,\u0027 Calapine said. Svengaard bowed. And he marked that Schruille had not spoken or moved during the entire interview. Svengaard wondered why this fact, of itself, should be a suddenly terrifying thing. His knees trembled as he turned, the acolytes flanking him with their smoking thuribles, and left the hall. The Tuyere watched until the barrier dropped behind Svengaard. \u0027Another one who doesn\u0027t know what Potter achieved,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Are you sure Max doesn\u0027t know?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 she said. \u0027Then we should\u0027ve told him.\u0027 \u0027And told him how we knew?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I know the argument,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Blunt the instrument, spoil the work.\u0027 That Svengaard, he\u0027s one of the reliable ones,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027It is said we walk the sharp edge of a knife,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027When you walk the knife, you must be careful how you place your feet. \u0027What a disgusting idea,\u0027 Calapine said. She turned to Nourse. \u0027Are you still hobbying da Vinci, dearest?\u0027 \u0027His brush stroke,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027A most exacting discipline. I should have it in forty or fifty years. Soon at any rate.\u0027 \u0027Provided you\u0027ve placed each step correctly,\u0027 Schruille said. Presently, Nourse said, \u0027Sometimes, Schruille, you allow cynicism to carry you beyond the bounds of propriety.\u0027 He turned, studied the instrument gauges, sensors, peek-eyes and read-outs across from Calapine on the inner wall of the globe. \u0027It\u0027s reasonably quiet today. Shall we leave the control with Schruille, Cal, and go down for a swim and a pharmacy session.\u0027 \u0027Body tone, body tone,\u0027 Schruille complained. \u0027Have you ever considered doing twenty- five laps of the pool instead of twenty?\u0027 \u0027You say the most astonishing things of late,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Would you have Nourse upset his enzyme balance? I fail completely in my attempts to understand you.\u0027 \u0027Fail to try,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Is there anything we can do for you?\u0027 she asked. \u0027My cycle has plunged me into dreadful monotony,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Is there something you can do about that?\u0027 Nourse looked at Schruille in the prismatic reflector. The man\u0027s voice with its suggestion of a whine had grown increasingly annoying of late. Nourse was beginning to regret that community of tastes and bodily requirements had thrown them together. Perhaps when the Tuyere\u0027s service was done... \u0027Monotony,\u0027 Calapine said. She shrugged. There\u0027s a certain triumph in well-considered monotony,\u0027 Nourse said. That\u0027s Voltaire, I believe.\u0027 \u0027It sounded like the purest Nourse,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027I sometimes find it helpful,\u0027 Calapine said, \u0027to invoke a benign concern for the Folk.\u0027 \u0027Even among ourselves?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027Consider the fate of the poor computer nurse,\u0027 she said. \u0027In the abstract, naturally. Can you not feel sorrow and pity?\u0027 \u0027Pity\u0027s a wasteful emotion,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Sorrow is akin to cynicism.\u0027 He smiled. This will pass. Go to your swim. When the vigor\u0027s on you, think of me... here.\u0027 Nourse and Calapine stood, ordered the carrier beams into position. \u0027Efficiency,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027We must seek more efficiency in our minions. Things must be made to run more smoothly.\u0027 Schruille looked up at them waiting for the beams. He wanted only to be free of the wanton rambling of their voices. They missed the point, insisted on missing it. \u0027Efficiency?\u0027 Calapine asked. \u0027Perhaps you\u0027re right.\u0027 Schruille no longer could contain the emotions at war within him. \u0027Efficiency\u0027s the opposite of craftsmanship,\u0027 he said. Think on that!\u0027 The beams came. Nourse and Calapine slid down and away without answering, leaving Schruille to close the segment. He sat alone at last within the green-blue-red winking of the control center - alone except for the glittering eyes of scanners activated along the upper circle of the globe. He counted eighty-one of them alive and staring at him and at the responses of the globe. Eighty-one of his fellows... or groups of his fellows were out there observing him and his work as he observed the Folk and their work. The scanners imparted a vague uneasiness to Schruille. Before the Tuyere\u0027s service, he could never remember watching the control center or its activities. Too much that was painful and unthinkable occurred here. Were the former masters of the control center curious about how the new trio dispatched its duties? Who were the watchers? Schruille dropped his attention to the instruments. In moments like this he often felt like Chen Tzu-ang\u0027s \u0027Master of Dark Truth\u0027 who saw the whole world in a jade bottle. Here was the jade bottle - this globe. A flick of the power ring on the arm of his throne and he could watch a couple making love in Warsopolis, study the contents of an embryo vat in Greater London or loose hypnotic gas with taming suggestions into a warren of New Peking. The touch of a key and he could analyze the shifting motives of an entire work force in the megalopolis of Roma. Searching within himself, Schruille could not find the impulse to move a single control. He thought back, trying to remember how many scanners had watched the first years of the Tuyere\u0027s service. He was sure it had never exceeded ten or twelve. But now - eighty- one. I should\u0027ve warned them about Svengaard, he thought. I could\u0027ve said that we shouldn\u0027t rely on the assumption there\u0027s a special Providence for fools. Svengaard is a fool who disturbs me. But Nourse and Calapine would have defended Svengaard. He knew it. They\u0027d have insisted the man was reliable, honorable, loyal. They\u0027d wager anything on it. Anything? Schruille wondered. Is there something they might not wager on Svengaard\u0027s loyalty? Schruille could almost hear Nourse pontificating, \u0027Our judgment of Svengaard is the correct one.\u0027 And that, Schruille thought, is what disturbs me. Svengaard worships us...as does Max. But worship is nine-tenths fear. In time, everything becomes fear.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-7.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
