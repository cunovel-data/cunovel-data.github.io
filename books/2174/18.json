{"id":99300,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u0027But these things happen,\u0027 Boumour said. He looked at Sven-gaard, who was preparing a slapshot ampoule from Igan\u0027s kit. \u0027What\u0027re you doing?\u0027 \u0027Giving her a little enzymic stimulation to produce the hormones she needs,\u0027 Svengaard said. He glanced at Harvey, seeing the man\u0027s fears and need for reassurance. \u0027It\u0027s the best thing we can do now, Durant. It should work if her system hasn\u0027t been too upset by all this.\u0027 He waved a hand indicating their flight, the emotional stress, the exertion. \u0027Do whatever you think you should,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027I know it\u0027s your best.\u0027 Svengaard administered the shot, patted Lizbeth\u0027s arm. \u0027Try to rest. Relax. Don\u0027t move around unless it\u0027s necessary.\u0027 Lizbeth nodded. She had been reading Svengaard, seeing his genuine concern for her. His attempt to reassure Harvey had touched her, but there were fears she couldn\u0027t suppress. \u0027Glisson,\u0027 she whispered. Svengaard saw the direction of her thoughts, and said, \u0027I won\u0027t permit him to move you until I\u0027m sure you\u0027re all right. He and his guide will just have to wait.\u0027 \u0027You won\u0027t permit?\u0027 Boumour sneered. As though to punctuate his words, the ground around them rumbled and shook. Dust puffed through the low entrance and, like a magician\u0027s trick, Glisson materialized there as the concealing dust settled. At the first sign of disturbance, Harvey had dropped to the floor beside Lizbeth. He held her shoulders, shielded her with his body. Svengaard still knelt beside the medical kit. Boumour had whirled to stare at Glisson. \u0027Sonics?\u0027 Boumour hissed. \u0027Not sonics,\u0027 Glisson said. The Cyborg\u0027s usually flat voice carried a sing-song twang. \u0027He has no arms,\u0027 Harvey said. They all noticed it then. From the shoulders down where Glisson\u0027s arms had been now dangled only the empty linkages for Cyborg prosthetic attachments. \u0027They have sealed us in here,\u0027 Glisson said. Again, that singsong twang as though something about him had been broken. \u0027As you can see, I am disarmed. Do you not think that amusing? Do you see now why we could never fight them openly? When they wish it, they can destroy anything.. anyone.\u0027 \u0027Igan?\u0027 Boumour whispered. \u0027Igans are easy to destroy,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027I have seen it. Accept the fact.\u0027 \u0027But what\u0027ll we do?\u0027 Harvey demanded. \u0027Do?\u0027 Glisson looked down at him. \u0027We will wait.\u0027 \u0027One of you could stand off an entire Security force to get Potter away,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027But all you can do now is wait?\u0027 \u0027Violence is not my function,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You will see.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027ll they do?\u0027 Lizbeth hissed. \u0027Whatever they wish to do,\u0027 Glisson said. Eighteen \u0027THERE, it is done,\u0027 Calapine said. She looked at Schruille and Nourse in the reflectors. Schruille indicated the kinesthetic analogue relays of the Survey Globe\u0027s inner wall. \u0027Did you observe Svengaard\u0027s emotion?\u0027 \u0027He was properly horrified,\u0027 Calapine said. Schruille pursed his lips, studied her reflection. A session with the pharmacy had restored her composure, but she occupied her throne in a subdued mood. The kaleidoscopic play of lights from the wall gave an unhealthy cast to her skin. There was a definite flush to her features. Nourse glanced up at the observer lights - the span of arctic wall glowed with a dull red intensity, every position occupied. With hardly an exception, the Optiman community watched the developments. \u0027We have a decision to make,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027You look pale, Nourse,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Did you have pharmacy trouble?\u0027 \u0027No more than you.\u0027 He spoke defensively. \u0027A simple enzymic heterodyning. It\u0027s pretty well damped out.\u0027 \u0027I say bring them here now,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027To what purpose?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027We have the pattern of their flight very well fixed. Why let them escape again?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t like the thought of unregistered self-viables - who knows how many - running loose out there,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Are you sure we could take them alive?\u0027 Calapine asked. The Cyborg admits ineffectiveness against us,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Unless that\u0027s a trick,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027And once we have them here we can extract the information we need from their raw brains with the utmost precision.\u0027 Nourse turned, stared at her. He couldn\u0027t understand what had happened to Calapine. She spoke with the callous brutality of a Folk woman. She was like an awakened ghoul, as though violence were her rising bell. What is her setting bell? he wondered. And he was shocked at his own thought. \u0027If they have means of destroying themselves?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027I remind you of the computer nurse and a sad number of our own surgeons who appear to be in league with these criminals. We were powerless to prevent their self-destruction.\u0027 \u0027How callous you are, Nourse,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Callous? I?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027I merely wish to prevent further pain. Let us destroy them ourselves and go on from here.\u0027 \u0027Glisson\u0027s a full Cyborg,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Can you imagine what his memory banks would reveal?\u0027 \u0027I remember the one who escorted Potter,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Let us take no risk. His quietude could be a trick.\u0027 \u0027A contact narcotic in their present cell,\u0027 Schruille said. That\u0027s my suggestion.\u0027 \u0027How do you know it\u0027ll work on the Cyborgs?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027Then they could escape once more,\u0027 Schruille said. He shrugged, \u0027What does it matter?\u0027 \u0027Into another megalopolis,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Is that it?\u0027 \u0027We know the infection\u0027s widespread,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Certainly, there were cells right here in Central. We\u0027ve cleaned out those, but the- \u0027 \u0027I say stop them now!\u0027 Nourse snapped. \u0027I agree with Schruille,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027What\u0027s the risk?\u0027 \u0027The sooner we stop them the sooner we can return to our own pursuits,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027This is our pursuit,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027You like the idea of sterilizing another megalopolis, don\u0027t you, Schruille?\u0027 Nourse sneered. \u0027Which one this time? How about Loovil?\u0027 \u0027Once was enough,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027But likes and dislikes really have nothing to do with it.\u0027 \u0027Let us put it to a vote then,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Because you\u0027re two to one against me, eh?\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027She means a full vote,\u0027 Schruille said. He looked up at the observation lights. \u0027We\u0027ve obviously a full quorum.\u0027 Nourse stared at the indicators knowing he\u0027d been neatly trapped. He dared not protest a full vote - any vote. And his two companions appeared so sure of themselves. - \u0027This is our pursuit.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve allowed the Cyborgs to interfere,\u0027 Nourse said, \u0027because they increased the proportion of viables in the genetic reserve. Did we do this merely to destroy the genetic reserve?\u0027 Schruille indicated a bank of binary pyramids on the Globe\u0027s wall. \u0027If they endanger us, certainly. But the issue is unregistered self-viables, their possible immunity to the contraceptive gas. Where else could they have produced the substitute embryo?\u0027 \u0027If it comes down to it, we don\u0027t need any of them,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Destroy them all?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027All the Folk?\u0027 \u0027And raise a new crop of doppelgangers,\u0027 she said. \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027Duplicates don\u0027t always come true,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Nothing limits us,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Our sun isn\u0027t infinite,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027We\u0027ll solve that when the need arises,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027What problem can defy us? We\u0027re not limited by time.\u0027 \u0027Yet we\u0027re sterile,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Our gametes refuse to unite.\u0027 \u0027And well they do,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027I\u0027d not have it otherwise.\u0027 \u0027All we wish now is a simple vote,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027A simple vote on whether to capture and bring in one tiny band of criminals. Why should that arouse major debate?\u0027 Nourse started to speak, thought better of it. He shook his head, looked from Calapine to Schruille. \u0027Well?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027I think this little band is the real issue,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027One Sterrie surgeon, two Cyborgs and two viables.\u0027 \u0027And Durant was ready to kill the Sterrie,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027No.\u0027 It was Calapine. \u0027He wasn\u0027t ready to erase anyone.\u0027 She found herself suddenly interested in the train of Nourse\u0027s reasoning. It was his logic and reason, after all, which had always attracted her. Schruille, seeing her waver, said, \u0027Calapine!\u0027 \u0027We all saw Durant\u0027s emotion,\u0027 Nourse said. He waved at the instrument wall in front of him. \u0027He would\u0027ve killed no one. He was... educating Svengaard, talking to Svengaard with his hands.\u0027 \u0027As they do between themselves, he and his wife,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Certainly!\u0027 \u0027You say we should raise a new crop of doppelgangers,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Which seed shall we use? The occupants of Seatac, perhaps?\u0027 \u0027We could take the seed cells first,\u0027 Schruille said, and he wondered how he had been put so suddenly on the defensive. \u0027I say let\u0027s vote on it. Bring them here for full interrogation or destroy them.\u0027 \u0027No need, \u0027Nourse said. \u0027I\u0027ve changed my mind. Bring them here... if you can.\u0027 Then it\u0027s settled,\u0027 Schruille said. He rapped the signal into his throne arm. \u0027You see, it\u0027s really very simple.\u0027 \u0027Indeed?\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Then why do Calapine and I find ourselves suddenly reluctant to use violence? Why do we long for the old ways when Max shielded us from ourselves?\u0027 Nineteen THE Hall of Counsel had not seen such a gathering since the debate over legalizing limited Cyborg experiments on their own kind some thirty thousand years before. The Optimen occupied a rainbow splashing of multicolored cushions on the banks of plasmeld benches. Some appeared nude, but most out of awareness of such a gathering\u0027s traditional nature came clothed in garments of their immediately historical whims. There were togas, kilts, gowns and ruffs, three-cornered hats and derbies, G-strings and muu-muus, fabrics and styles reaching back into pre-history. Those who could not jam into the hall watched through half-a-million scanner eyes that glittered around the upper lines of the walls. It was barely daylight over Central, but not an Optiman slept. The Survey Globe had been moved aside and the Tuyere occupied a position on the front bench center at the end of the hall. The prisoners had been brought in on a pneumoflot tumbril by acolytes. They sat on the tumbril\u0027s flat surface immobilized within dull blue plasmeld plastrons that permitted only the shallowest of breaths. As she looked down on them from her bench, seeing the five figures so rigidly repressed, Calapine permitted herself a faint pity for them. The woman - such terror in her eyes. The rage in Harvey Durant\u0027s face. The resigned waiting in Glisson and Boumour. And Svengaard - a look of wary awakening. Yet Calapine felt something was missing here. She couldn\u0027t name the missing thing, felt it only as a negative blankness within herself. Nourse is right, she thought. These five are important. Some Optiman up near the front of the hall had brought a tinkle-player and its little bell music could be heard above the murmurous whispering of the throng in the hall. The sound appeared to grow louder as the Optimen quieted in anticipation. The tinkle-player was stilled in mid-melody. It grew quieter and quieter in the hall. Despite her fear, Lizbeth stared around her in the growing silence. She had never before seen an Optiman in the flesh -only on the screens of the public announcement system. (In her lifetime it\u0027d been mostly the members of the Tuyere, although older Folk mentioned the Kagiss trio preceding them.) They looked so varied and colorful - and so distant. She had the demoralizing feeling that nothing of this moment had happened by chance, that there was a terrifying symmetry in being here, now with this company. They are completely immobilized,\u0027 Schruille said. There\u0027s nothing to fear.\u0027 \u0027Yet they are terrified,\u0027 Nourse said. And he recalled suddenly a moment out of his youth. He\u0027d been taken to an antiquary\u0027s home, one of the Hedonists proudly displaying his plasmeld copies of lost statues. There\u0027d been a giant fish, one headless figure on a horse (very daring, that), a hooded monk and a man and woman clasped in a mutual embrace of terror. The man and woman, he realized now, had been recalled by the faces of Lizbeth and Harvey Durant. They are, in a way, our parents, Nourse thought. We spring from the Folk. Calapine realized abruptly what it was she missed here. There was no Max. He was gone, she knew, and she wondered momentarily what had happened to him. Outgrew his usefulness, she decided. The new Max must not be ready yet. Odd that Max should go just like that, she thought. But the lives of the Folk were like gossamer. One day you saw them; the next day you saw through the place where they had been. I must ask what happened to Max. But she knew she wouldn\u0027t ever get around to that. The answer might require a disgusting word, a concept where even euphemisms would be repellent. \u0027Pay particular attention to the Cyborg Glisson,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Isn\u0027t it strange that our instruments reflect no emotions from him?\u0027 \u0027Perhaps he has no emotions,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Hah!\u0027 Schruille barked. \u0027Very good.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t trust him,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027My grandsire spoke of Cyborg tricks.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s virtually a robot,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Programed to respond with the closest precise answer to preserve his being. His present docility is interesting.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t it our purpose to interrogate them?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027In a moment,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027We will peel them down to the raw brain and open their memories to our examination. First, it is well to study them.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re so callous, Schruille,\u0027 Calapine said. A murmurous agreement spread upward through the hall.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-18.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
