The evidence is quite clear - there\u0027s no turning back.\u0027\n \u0027Then you understand,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Any attempt to force your systems back into the old forms will result in boredom and a gradual descent into apathy.\u0027\n Calapine smiled. \u0027Yes, Glisson. We\u0027d not want that. We\u0027ve been addicted to a new kind of... aliveness that we didn\u0027t know existed.\u0027\n \u0027Then you do understand,\u0027 Glisson said and there was a grudging quality to his voice.\n \u0027We broke the rhythm of life,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027All life is immersed in rhythm, but we got out of step. I suppose that was the outside interference in those embryos - rhythm asserting itself.\u0027\n \u0027Well then,\u0027 Glisson said, \u0027the sooner you can turn things over to us, the sooner things will settle down into- \u0027\n To you?\u0027 Calapine asked scornfully. She looked out into the quick contrasts of the hall\u0027s glaring light. How black and white it all was. \u0027I\u0027d sooner condemn us all,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027But you\u0027re dying!\u0027 \u0027So are you,\u0027 Calapine said.\n Svengaard swallowed. He could see that the old animosities would not be suppressed easily. And he wondered at himself, a second-rater surgeon who had suddenly found himself as a doctor, ministering to people who needed him. Durant had seen that - the need to be needed.\n \u0027I may have a plan we could accept, Calapine,\u0027 Svengaard said.\n To you we will listen,\u0027 Calapine said, and there was affection in her voice. She studied Svengaard as he searched for words, remembering that this man had saved the lives of Nourse and many others.\n We made no plans for the unthinkable, she thought. Is it possible that this nobody who was once a target for kindly sneers can save us? She dared not let herself hope.\n The Cyborgs have techniques for bringing the emotions into a more or less manageable stasis,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Once that\u0027s done, I believe I know a way to dampen the enzymic oscillations in most of you.\u0027\n Calapine swallowed. The scanner-eye lights above her began to flash as the watchers signaled for her to let them into the communications channels. They had questions of course. She had questions of her own, but she didn\u0027t know that she could speak them. She caught a reflection of her own face in one of the prisms, was reminded of the look in Lizbeth\u0027s eyes as the woman had pleaded from the tumbril.\n \u0027I can\u0027t promise infinite life,\u0027 Svengaard said, \u0027but I believe many of you can have many more thousands of years.\u0027\n \u0027Why should we agree to help them?\u0027 Glisson demanded. There was a measuring quality in his voice, a hint of the querulous.\n \u0027You\u0027re failures, too!\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Can\u0027t you see that?\u0027 He realized he had shouted with the full power of his disillusionment.\n \u0027Don\u0027t shout at me!\u0027 Glisson snapped.\n So they do have emotions, Svengaard thought. Pride... anger...\n \u0027Are you still suffering under the delusion that you\u0027re in control of this situation?\u0027 Svengaard asked. He pointed to Calapine. That one woman up there could still exterminate every non-Optiman on earth.\u0027\n \u0027Listen to him, you Cyborg fool,\u0027 Calapine said.\n \u0027Let\u0027s not be too free with that word \u0027fool\u0027,\u0027 Svengaard said. He stared up at Calapine.\n \u0027Watch your tongue, Svengaard,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Our patience is not infinite.\u0027\n \u0027Nor is your gratitude, eh?\u0027 Svengaard said.\n A bitter smile touched her mouth. \u0027We were talking about survival,\u0027 she said.\n Svengaard sighed. He wondered then if the patterns of thought conditions by the illusion of infinite life could ever be truly broken. She had spoken there like the old Tuyere. But her resiliency had surprised him before.\n The outburst had touched Harvey\u0027s fears for Lizbeth. He glared at Svengaard and Glisson, tried to control his terror and rage. This hall awed him with its immensity and its remembered bedlam. The globe towered over him, a monstrous force that could crush them.\n \u0027Survival, then,\u0027 Svengaard said.\n \u0027Let us understand each other,\u0027 Calapine said. There are those among us who will say that your help was merely our due. You are still our captives. There are those who\u0027ll demand you submit and reveal your entire Underground to us.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, let us understand each other,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Who are your prisoners? Myself, a person who was not a member of the Underground and knows little about it. You have Glisson, who knows more, but assuredly not all. You have Boumour, one of your escaped pharmacists, who knows even less than Glisson. You have the Durants, whose knowledge probably goes little beyond their own cell group. What will you gain even if you milk us dry?\u0027\n \u0027Your plan to save us,\u0027 Calapine said.\n \u0027My plan requires co-operation, not coercion,\u0027 Svengaard said.\n \u0027And it will only give us a continuation, not restore us to our original condition, is that it?\u0027 Calapine asked.\n \u0027You should welcome that,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027It would give you a chance to mature, become useful.\u0027 He waved a hand to indicate their surroundings \u0027You\u0027ve frozen yourselves in immaturity here! You\u0027ve played with toys! I\u0027m offering you a chance to live!\u0027\n Is that it? Calapine wondered. Is this new aliveness a byproduct of the knowledge that we must die?\n \u0027I\u0027m not at all sure we\u0027ll co-operate,\u0027 Glisson said.\n Harvey had had enough. He leaped to his feet, glared at Glisson. \u0027You want the human race to die, you robot! You! You\u0027re another dead end!\u0027\n \u0027Prattle!\u0027 Glisson said.\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Calapine said. She began sampling the communications channels. Bits of sentences poured out into the hall:\n \u0027We can restore enzymic balance with our own resources!\u0027... \u0027Eliminate these creatures!\u0027... \u0027What\u0027s his plan? What\u0027s his plan?\u0027... \u0027Begin the sterilization!\u0027...\u0027... his plan?\u0027... \u0027How long do we have if...\u0027... There\u0027s no doubt we can...\u0027\n Calapine silenced the voices with a flick of a switch. \u0027It will be put to a vote,\u0027 she said. \u0027I remind you of that.\u0027\n \u0027You will die, and soon, if we don\u0027t co-operate,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027I want that fully understood.\u0027\n \u0027You know Svengaard\u0027s plan?\u0027 Calapine asked.\n \u0027His thought patterns are transparent,\u0027 Glisson said.\n \u0027I think not,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027I saw him work on Nourse. He manipulated a dispensary to produce a dangerous overdose of aneurin and inostol. Remembering that, I ask myself how many of us will die in the attempt to arrest this process we can all feel within ourselves? Would I have risked such an overdose upon myself? How does this relate to the excitement we feel? Will any of us, having tasted excitement, wish to sink back into a non-emotional... boredom?\u0027 She looked at Svengaard. These are some of my questions.\u0027\n \u0027I know his plan,\u0027 Glisson sneered. \u0027Quell your emotions and implant an enzymic dispensary within each of you.\u0027 A tight grin etched a line of teeth in Glisson\u0027s face. \u0027It\u0027s your only hope. Accepting it, you will have lost to us at last.\u0027\n Calapine glared down at him, shocked.\n Harvey was caught by the carping meanness in Glisson\u0027s voice. His own schism from the Underground had always known the Cyborgs were too calculating and narrow-minded to be trusted with purely human decisions, but he had never before seen the fact so clearly demonstrated.\n \u0027Is that your plan, Svengaard?\u0027 Calapine demanded.\n Harvey jumped up. \u0027No! That\u0027s not his plan!\u0027\n Svengaard nodded to himself. Of course! A fellow human, and a father, would know.\n \u0027You pretend to know what I, a Cyborg, do not know?\u0027 Glisson asked.\n Svengaard looked at Harvey with raised eyebrows.\n \u0027Embryos,\u0027 Harvey said. Svengaard nodded, looked up at Calapine. \u0027I propose to keep you continually implanted with living embryos,\u0027 he said. \u0027Living monitors that will make you adjust to your own needs. You will regain your emotions, your... zest for life, this excitement you prize.\u0027\n \u0027You propose to make us living vats for embryos?\u0027 Calapine asked, wonder in her voice.\n The gestation process can be delayed for hundreds of years,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027With proper hormone adjustment this can be applied even to men, Caesarian delivery, of course, but it need not be painful... or frequent.\u0027\n Calapine weighed his words, wondering why she felt no disgust at the suggestion. Once she had felt disgust at the realization that Lizbeth Durant carried an embryo within her, but Calapine realized now her disgust had been compounded of jealousy. Not all the Optimen would accept this, she knew. Some would hope for a return to the old ways. She looked up at the globe\u0027s telltales. No one had escaped the poisoning excitement, though. They would have to understand that everyone was going to die... sooner or later. Choice of time was all they had.\n We didn\u0027t have immortality after all, she thought, only the illusion. We had that, though... for eons.\n \u0027Calapine,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You\u0027re not going to accept this -this foolish proposal?\u0027\n The mechanical man is outraged at a living solution, she thought. She said, \u0027Boumour, what do you say?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Glisson said, \u0027speak up, Boumour. Point out the illogicality of this... proposal.\u0027\n Boumour turned, studied Glisson, glanced at Svengaard, at the Durants, stared up at Calapine. There was a look of secret wisdom in Boumour\u0027s pinched face. \u0027I can still remember... how it was,\u0027 he said. \u0027I... think it was better... before I... was changed.\u0027\n \u0027Boumour!\u0027 Glisson said.\n Hit him in his pride, Svengaard thought.\n Glisson glared up at Calapine with mechanical intensity. \u0027It\u0027s not yet determined that we\u0027ll help you!\u0027\n \u0027Who needs you?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027You\u0027ve no monopoly on your techniques. You\u0027d save a little time and trouble, that\u0027s all. We can find embryos.\u0027\n Glisson stared from one to the other. \u0027But this isn\u0027t the way it was computed! You\u0027re not supposed to help them!\u0027\n The Cyborg fell silent, eyes glassy.\n \u0027Doctor Svengaard,\u0027 Calapine said, \u0027could you give us elite, viable embryos such as the Durants\u0027? You saw the arginine intrusion. Nourse believes this possible.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s possible,\u0027 Svengaard said. He considered. \u0027Yes, it\u0027s... probable.\u0027\n Calapine looked up at the scanners. \u0027If we accept this offer,\u0027 she said, \u0027we go on living. You feel it? We\u0027re alive now, but we can remember a recent time when we weren\u0027t alive.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll help if we must,\u0027 Glisson said, and there was that carping tone in his voice.\n Only Lizbeth, realizing her own bucolic docility in pregnancy, recognizing the flattening tenor of her emotions, suspected the logical fact which had swayed the Cyborg. Docile people could be controlled. That\u0027s what Glisson was thinking. She could read it in him, understanding him fully for the first time now that she knew he had pride and anger.\n Calapine, reading on the Survey Globe\u0027s wall the mounting pressure of a single question from her Optiman audience, set up the analogues for an answer. It came swiftly for the scanners to see, \u0027This process could provide eight to twelve thousand years of additional life even for the Folk.\u0027\n \u0027Even for the Folk,\u0027 Calapine whispered. They\u0027d discover this, she knew. There could be no more Security now. Even the Survey Globe had been shown to have flaws and limits. Glisson knew it. She could tell this, reading his silent withdrawal down there. Svengaard certainly would realize it. Possibly even the Durants.\n She looked at Svengaard, knowing what she had to do. It would be easy to lose the Folk in this moment, lose them completely.\n \u0027If it is done,\u0027 Calapine said, \u0027it will be done for anyone who wishes it - Folk or Optiman.\u0027\n This is politics, she thought. This is the way the Tuyere \u0027would do it... even Schruille. Especially Schruille. Clever Schruille. Dead Schruille. She could amost hear him chuckling.\n \u0027Can it be done for the Folk?\u0027 Harvey asked.\n \u0027For anyone,\u0027 she said, and she smiled at Glisson, letting him see how she\u0027d won. \u0027I think we can put it to a vote now.\u0027\n Once more, she looked up at the scanners, wondering if she\u0027d gauged her people correctly. Most of them would see What she\u0027d done, of course. But there\u0027d be some clinging to the hope they could restore complete enzymic balance. She knew better. Her body knew. But some might choose to try that dangerous course back to boredom and apathy.\n \u0027Green for acceptance of Doctor Svengaard\u0027s proposal,\u0027 she said. \u0027Gold against.\u0027\n Slowly, then with cumulating speed, the circle of scanner lights changed color - green... green... great washes of it with only here and there a dot or pocket of gold. It was a more overwhelming acceptance than she\u0027d expected and this made her edgy, suspicious. She trusted her voting instincts. Overwhelming acceptance. She consulted the Globe\u0027s instruments, read the presentation of the answer: \u0027The Cyborg can\u0027t be maneuvered through his belief in the omnipotence of logic.\u0027\n Calapine nodded to herself, thinking of her madness. And Life cannot be totally maneuvered against the interests of living, she thought.\n The proposal is accepted,\u0027 she said.\n And she found she didn\u0027t like the sudden pouncing look on Glisson\u0027s face. We\u0027ve overlooked something, she thought. But we\u0027ll find it... once we\u0027re newly adjusted.\n Svengaard turned to look at Harvey Durant, allowed himself a broad grin. This was like the operating room, he thought. One shaped minutiae and the broad pattern followed. It could be done with precision even as it was done down in the cell.\n Harvey weighed Svengaard\u0027s grin, read the emotional betrayals on the man\u0027s face. All the faces around him carried their own exposure in this instant, all open to be read by a courier trained in the Underground. It was a stand-off between the powerful. The Folk might yet have a chance - thousands of years of chance, if Calapine were to be believed - and she believed it herself. The genetic environment had been shaped into a new pattern and he could see it. This was an indefinite pattern, full of indeterminacy. Heisenberg would\u0027ve liked this pattern. The movers themselves had been moved - and changed - by moving.\n \u0027When can Lizbeth and I leave here?\u0027 Harvey asked. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-21.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: \n A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
