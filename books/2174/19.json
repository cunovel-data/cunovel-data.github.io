He found himself filled.with a sudden disquiet.\n Glisson\u0027s Cyborg eyes moved, heavy-lidded, coldly probing, glistening with their lensed alterations that expanded his spectrum of visibility.\n \u0027Do you see it, Durant?\u0027 he asked, his voice chopped into bits by the necessity of short breaths.\n Harvey found his voice. \u0027I... can\u0027t... believe... it\u0027\n They are talking,\u0027 Calapine said, her voice bright. She looked at the Durant male, surprised a look of loathing and pity in his eyes.\n Pity? she wondered.\n A glance at the tiny repeater bracelet on her wrist, confirmed the assessment of the Survey Globe. Pity. Pity! How dare he pity me!\n \u0027Har... vey,\u0027 Lizbeth whispered.\n Frustrated rage contorted Harvey\u0027s face. He moved his eyes, could not quite swing them far enough to see her. \u0027Liz,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027Liz, I love you.\u0027\n \u0027This is a time for hate, not love,\u0027 Glisson said, his detached tone giving the words an air of unreality. \u0027Hate and revenge,\u0027 Glisson said.\n \u0027What are you saying?\u0027 Svengaard asked. He\u0027d listened with mounting amazement to their words. For a time, he\u0027d thought of pleading with the Optimen that he\u0027d been a prisoner, held against his will, but a sixth sense told him the attempt would be useless. He was nothing to these lordly creatures. He was foam in the backwash of a wave at a cliff base. They were the cliff.\n \u0027Look at them as a doctor,\u0027 Glisson said. They are dying.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 Harvey said.\n Lizbeth had pressed her eyes closed against tears. Now, her eyes sprang open and she stared up at the people around her, seeing them through Harvey\u0027s eyes and Glisson\u0027s.\n They are dying,\u0027 she breathed.\n It was there for the trained eye of an Underground courier to read. Mortality on the faces of the immortals! Glisson had seen it, of course, through his Cyborg abilities to see and respond, read-and-reflect.\n The Folk are so disgusting at times,\u0027 Calapine said.\n They can\u0027t be,\u0027 Svengaard said. There was an unreadable tone in his voice and Lizbeth wondered at it. The voice lacked the despair she could have expected.\n \u0027I say they are disgusting!\u0027 Calapine intoned. \u0027No mere pharmacist should contradict me.\u0027\n Boumour stirred out of a profound lethargy. The as-yet alien computer logic within him had recorded the conversation, replayed it, derived corollary meanings. He looked up now as a new and partial Cyborg, read the subtle betrayals in Optiman flesh. The thing was there! Something had gone wrong with the live-forevers. The shock of it left Boumour with a half- formed feeling of emptiness, as though he ought to respond with some emotions for which he no longer had the capacity.\n Their words,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027I find their conversation mostly meaningless. What is it they\u0027re saying, Schruille?\u0027\n \u0027Let us ask them now about the self-viables,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027And the substitute embryo. Don\u0027t forget the substitute embryo.\u0027\n \u0027Look up there in the top row,\u0027 Glisson said. The tall one. See the wrinkles on his face?\u0027\n \u0027He looks so old,\u0027 Lizbeth whispered. She felt a curiously empty feeling. As long as the Optimen were there - unchangeable, eternal - her world contained a foundation that could never tremble. Even as she\u0027d opposed them, she\u0027d felt this. Cyborgs died... eventually. The Folk died. But Optimen went on and on and on...\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027What\u0027s happening to them?\u0027\n \u0027Second row on the left,\u0027 Glisson said. The woman with red hair, See the sunken eyes, the stare?\u0027\n Boumour moved his eyes to see the woman. Flaws in Optician flesh leaped out as his gaze traversed the short arc permitted him.\n \u0027What\u0027re they saying?\u0027 Calapine demanded. \u0027What is this?\u0027 Her voice sounded querulous even to her own ears. She felt fretful, annoyed by vague aches.\n A muttering sound of discontent moved upward through the benches. There were little pockets of giggling and bursts of peevish anger, laughter.\n We\u0027re supposed to interrogate these criminals, Calapine thought. When will it start? Must I begin it?\n She looked at Schruille. He had scrunched down in his seat, glaring at Harvey Durant. She turned to Nourse, encountered a supercilious half-smile on his face, a remote look in his eyes. There was a throbbing at Nourse\u0027s neck she had never noticed before, a mottled patch of red veins stood out on his cheek.\n They leave everything to me, she thought.\n With a fretful movement of her shoulders, she touched her bracelet controls. Lambent purple light washed over the giant globe at the side of the hall. A beam of the light spilled out from the globe\u0027s top as though decanted onto the floor. It reached out toward the prisoners.\n Schruille watched the play of light. Soon the prisoners would be raw, shrieking creatures, he knew, spilling out all their knowledge for the Tuyere\u0027s instruments to analyze. Nothing would remain of them except nerve fibers along which the burning light would spread, drinking memories, experiences, knowledge.\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Nourse said.\n He studied the light. It had stopped its reaching movement toward the prisoners at his command. He felt they were making some gross error known only to himself and he looked around the abruptly silent hall wondering if any of the others could identify the error or speak it. Here was all the secret machinery of their government, everything planned, ordained. Somehow, the inelegant unexpectedness of naked Life had entered here. It was an error. \u0027Why do we wait?\u0027 Calapine asked.\n Nourse tried to remember. He knew he had opposed this action. Why?\n Pain!\n \u0027We must not cause pain,\u0027 he said. \u0027We must give them the chance to speak without duress.\u0027\n They\u0027ve gone mad,\u0027 Lizbeth whispered.\n \u0027And we\u0027ve won,\u0027 Glisson said. Through my eyes, all my fellows can see - we\u0027ve won.\u0027\n They\u0027re going to destroy us,\u0027 Boumour said.\n \u0027But we\u0027ve won,\u0027 Glisson said.\n \u0027How?\u0027 Svengaard asked. And louder: \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027We offered them Potter as bait and gave them a taste of violence,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027We knew they\u0027d look. They had to look.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 Svengaard whispered.\n \u0027Because we\u0027ve changed the environment,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Little things, a pressure here, a shocking Cyborg there. And we gave them a taste for war.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027Instinct,\u0027 Glisson said. The word carried a computed finality, a \u0027sense of inhuman logic from which there was no escape. \u0027War\u0027s an instinct with humans. Battle. Violence. But their systems have been maintained in delicate balance for so many thousands of years. Ah, the price they paid - tranquillity, detachment, boredom. Comes now violence with its demands and their ability to change has atrophied. They\u0027re heterodyning, swaying farther and farther from that line of perpetual life. Soon they\u0027ll die.\u0027\n \u0027War?\u0027 Svengaard had heard the stories of the violence from which the Optimen preserved the Folk. \u0027It can\u0027t be,\u0027 he said. There\u0027s some new disease or-\u0027\n \u0027I have stated the fact as computed to its ultimate decimal of logic,\u0027 Glisson said.\n Calapine screamed. \u0027What\u0027re they saying?\u0027\n She could hear the prisoners\u0027 words distinctly, but their meaning eluded her. They were speaking obscenities. She heard a word, registered it, but the next word replaced it in her awareness without linkage. There was no intelligent sequence. Only obscenities. She rapped Schruille\u0027s arm. \u0027What are they saying?\u0027\n \u0027In a moment we will question them and discover,\u0027 Schruille said.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027The very thing.\u0027\n \u0027How is it possible?\u0027 Svengaard breathed. He could see two couples dancing on the benches high up at the back of the hall. There were couples embracing, making love. Two Optimen began shouting at each other on his right - nose to nose. Svengaard felt that he was watching buildings fall, the earth open and spew forth flames.\n \u0027Watch them!\u0027 Glisson said.\n \u0027Why can\u0027t they just compensate for this... change?\u0027 Svengaard demanded.\n \u0027Their ability to compensate is atrophied,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027And you must understand that compensation itself is a new environment. It creates even greater demands. Look at them! They\u0027re oscillating out of control right now.\u0027\n \u0027Make them shut up!\u0027 Calapine shouted. She leaped to her feet, advanced on the prisoners.\n Harvey watched, fascinated, terrified. There was a disjointed quality in her movement, in every response - except her anger. Rage burned at him from her eyes. A violent trembling swept through his body. \u0027You!\u0027 Calapine said, pointing at Harvey. \u0027Why do you stare at me and mumble? Answer!\u0027\n Harvey found himself frozen in silence, not by his fear of her anger, but by a sudden overwhelming awareness of Calapine\u0027s age. How old was she? Thirty thousand years? Forty thousand? Was she one of the originals - eighty thousand or more years old?\n \u0027Speak up and say what you will,\u0027 Calapine commanded. \u0027I,\n Calapine, order it. Show honor now and perhaps we will be lenient.\u0027\n Harvey stared, mute. She seemed unaware of the growing uproar all round.\n \u0027Durant,\u0027 Glisson said, \u0027you must remember there are subterranean things called instincts which direct destiny with the inexorable flow of a river. This is change. See it around us. Change is the only constant.\n \u0027But she\u0027s dying,\u0027 Harvey said.\n Calapine couldn\u0027t make sense of his words, but she found herself touched by the tone of concern for her in his voice. She consulted her bracelet linkage with the globe. Concern! He was worried about her, about Calapine, not about himself or his futile mate!\n She turned into an oddly enfolding darkness, collapsed full length on the floor with her arms outstretched toward the benches.\n A mirthless chuckle escaped Glisson\u0027s lips.\n \u0027We have to do something for them,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027They have to understand what they\u0027re doing to themselves!\u0027\n Schruille stirred suddenly, looked up at the opposite wall, saw dark patches where scanners had been deactivated, abandoned by the Optimen who couldn\u0027t jam into the hall. He felt an abrupt alarm at the eddies of movement in the crowd all around. Some of the people were leaving - swaying, drifting, running, laughing, giggling....\n But we came to question the prisoners, Schruille thought.\n The hysteria in the hall slowly impressed itself on Schruille\u0027s senses. He looked at Nourse.\n Nourse sat with eyes closed, mumbling to himself. \u0027Boiling oil,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027But that\u0027s too sudden. We need something more subtle, more enduring.\u0027\n Schruille leaned forward. T have a question for the man Harvey Durant.\u0027\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Nourse asked. He opened his eyes, pushed forward, subsided.\n \u0027What did he hope to gain by his actions?\u0027 Schruille asked.\n \u0027Very good,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Answer the question, Harvey Durant.\u0027\n Nourse touched his own bracelet. The purple beam of light inched closer to the prisoners.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t want you to die,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027Not this.\u0027\n \u0027Answer the question!\u0027 Schruille blared.\n Harvey swallowed. \u0027I wanted to- \u0027\n \u0027We wanted to have a family,\u0027 Lizbeth said. She spoke clearly, reasonably. That\u0027s all. We wanted to be a family.\u0027 Tears started in her eyes and she wondered then what her child would have been like. Certainly, none of them were going to survive this madness.\n \u0027What is this?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027What is this family nonsense?\u0027\n \u0027Where did you get the substitute embryo?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027Answer and we may be lenient.\u0027 Again the burning light moved toward the prisoners.\n \u0027We have self-viables immune to the contraceptive gas,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Many of them.\u0027\n \u0027You see?\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027I told you so.\u0027\n \u0027Where are these self-viables?\u0027 Nourse asked. He felt his right hand trembling, looked at it wonderingly.\n \u0027Right under your noses,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Scattered through the population. And don\u0027t ask me to identify them. I don\u0027t know them all. No one does.\u0027\n \u0027None will escape us,\u0027 Schruille said.\n \u0027None!\u0027 Nourse echoed.\n \u0027If we must,\u0027 Schruille said, \u0027we\u0027ll sterilize all but Central and start over.\u0027 \u0027With what will you start over?\u0027 Glisson asked.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Schruille screamed the word at the Cyborg.\n \u0027Where will you find the genetic pool from which to start over?\u0027 Glisson asked. \u0027You are sterile - and terminating.\u0027\n \u0027We need but one cell to duplicate the original,\u0027 Schruille said, his voice sneering.\n Then why haven\u0027t you duplicated yourselves?\u0027 Glisson asked.\n \u0027You dare question us?\u0027 Nourse demanded.\n \u0027I will answer for you then,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You\u0027ve not chosen duplication because the doppelganger is unstable. The trend of the duplicates is downward - extinction.\u0027\n Calapine heard scattered words - \u0027Sterile... terminating\n ... unstable... extinction...\u0027 They were hideous words that crept down into the depths where she lay watching a string of fat sausages parade in glowing order before her awareness. They were like seeds with a lambent radiance moving against a background of oiled black velvet. Sausages. Seeds. She saw them then not precisely as seeds, but as encapsulated life - walled in, shielded, bridging a period unfavorable to life. It made the idea of seeds less repellent to her. They were life... always life.\n \u0027We don\u0027t need the genetic pool,\u0027 Schruille said. Calapine heard his voice clearly, felt she could read his thoughts. Words out of one of the glowing sausages forced themselves upon her: We have our millions in Central. We are enough by ourselves. Feeble, short-lived Folk are a disgusting reminder of our past. They are pets and we no longer need pets.\n \u0027I\u0027ve decided what we can do to these criminals,\u0027 Nourse said. He spoke loudly to force his voice over the growing hubbub in the hall. \u0027We will apply nerve excitation a micron at a time. The pain will be exquisite and can be drawn out for centuries.\u0027\n \u0027But you said you didn\u0027t want to cause pain,\u0027 Schruille shouted.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t I?\u0027 Nourse\u0027s voice sounded worried. I don\u0027t feel -well, Calapine thought. I need a long session in the pharmacy. Pharmacy. The word was a switch that turned on her consciousness. She felt her body stretched out on the floor, pain and wetness at her nose where it had struck the floor in her fall. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-19.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: \n A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
