There was indeed a kind of elation in... violence.\\n\\n \u0027We have no Max now,\u0027 Schruille said.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll waken another doppelganger,\u0027 she said. \u0027Security can function without him for now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027ll waken the doppelganger?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027Igan and Boumour are no longer with us. The pharmacist. Hand, is gone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s keeping Nourse?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Enzymic trouble,\u0027 Schruille said, a note of glee in his voice. \u0027He said something about a necessary realignment of his prescription. Bonellia hormone derivatives, I believe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nourse can awaken the doppelganger,\u0027 she said. She wondered momentarily then why they needed the doppelganger. Oh, yes. Max was gone.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s more to it than merely awakening Max\u0027s duplicate,\u0027 Schruille said. They\u0027re not as good as they once were, you know. The new Max must be educated for his role, fitted into it gently. It could be weeks... months.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then one of us can run Security,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027You think we\u0027re ready for it?\u0027 Schruille asked.\\n\\n There\u0027s a thrill in this sort of decision-making,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t mind saying I\u0027ve been deeply bored during the past several hundred years. But now - now, I feel alive, vital, alert, fascinated.\u0027 She looked up at the glowing banks of scanner eyes, a full band of them, showing their fellow Optimen watching activities in the Survey Room. \u0027And I\u0027m not alone in this.\u0027\\n\\n Schruille glanced up at the glittering arctic circle of the globe\u0027s inner wall. \u0027Aliveness,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027But Max... he is dead.\u0027\\n\\n She remembered then, said, \u0027Any Max can be replaced.\u0027 She looked at Schruille, turning her head to stare past the prism. \u0027You\u0027re very blunt today, Schruille. You\u0027ve spoken of death twice that I recall.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Blunt? I?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027But I didn\u0027t erase Max.\u0027 She laughed aloud. \u0027My own reactions thrill me, Schruille!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And do you find changes in your enzymic demands?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A few. What is that? Times change. It\u0027s part of being. Adjustments must be made.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027d they find a substitute for the Durant embryo?\u0027 she asked, her mind shooting off at a tangent.\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps the new Max can discover,\u0027 Schruille said.\\n\\n \u0027He must.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or you will grow another Max?\u0027 Schruille said.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t mock me, Schruille.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t dare.\u0027\\n\\n Again, she looked directly at him.\\n\\n \u0027What if they produced their own embryo for the substitution?\u0027 Schruille asked.\\n\\n She turned away. \u0027In the name of all that\u0027s proper, how?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Air can be filtered clean of contraceptive gas,\u0027 Schruille said.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re disgusting!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Am I? But haven\u0027t you wondered what Potter concealed?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Potter? We know what he concealed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A person devoted to the preservation of life... such as that is,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027What did he hide in his mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Potter is no more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what did he conceal?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think he knew the source of the... outside interference?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps. And he would know where to find an embryo.\u0027\\n\\n Then the record will show the source, as you said yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been reconsidering.\u0027\\n\\n She stared at him in the prism. \u0027It\u0027s not possible.\u0027\\n\\n That I could reconsider?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what I mean - what you\u0027re thinking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it is possible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It isn\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re being stubborn, Cal. A female should be the last person to deny such a possibility.\\n\\n \u0027Now, you\u0027re being truly disgusting!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We know Potter found a self-viable,\u0027 Schruille pressed. They could have many self-viables - male and female. We know historically the capabilities of such raw union. It\u0027s part of our natural ancestry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re unspeakable,\u0027 she breathed.\\n\\n \u0027You can face the concept of death but not this,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Most interesting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Disgusting!\u0027 she barked.\\n\\n \u0027But possible,\u0027 Schruille said.\\n\\n The substitute embryo wasn\u0027t self-viable!\u0027 she pounced.\\n\\n \u0027All the more reason they\u0027ve been willing to sacrifice it for one that was, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where would they find the vat facilities, the chemicals, the enzymes, the- \u0027 \u0027Where they\u0027ve always been.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n They\u0027ve put the Durant embryo back into its mother,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027We can be certain of this. Would it not be equally logical to leave the embryo there to begin with - never remove it, never isolate the gametes in a vat at all?\u0027\\n\\n Calapine found herself speechless. She sensed a sour taste in her mouth, realized with a feeling of shock that she wanted to vomit. Something\u0027s wrong with my enzyme balance, she thought.\\n\\n She spoke slowly, precisely, \u0027I am reporting to pharmacy at once, Schruille. I do not feel well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By all means,\u0027 Schruille said. He glanced up and around at the watching scanners - a full circle of them.\\n\\n Delicately, Calapine eased herself out of the throne, slid down the beam, to the lock segment. Before letting herself out, she cast a look up at the dais, faintly remembering. Which Max was... erased? she asked herself. We\u0027ve had many of him... a successful model for our Security. She thought of the others. Max after Max after Max, each shunted aside when his appearance began to annoy his masters. They stretched into infinity, images in an endless system of mirrors.\\n\\n What is erasure to such as Max? She wondered. I am an unbroken continuity of existence. But a doppelganger doesn\u0027t remember. A doppelganger breaks the continuity.\\n\\n Unless the cells remember.\\n\\n Memory... cells... embryos...\\n\\n She thought of the embryo within Lizbeth Durant. Disgusting, but simple. So beautifully simple. Her gorge began to rise. Whirling, Calapine dropped down to the Hall of Counsel, ran for the nearest pharmacy outlet. As she ran, she clenched the hand that had slain Max and helped destroy a megalopolis. Seventeen\\n\\n \u0027SHE\u0027S sick, I tell you!\u0027\\n\\n Harvey bent over Igan shaking him out of sleep. They were in a narrow earth-walled room, ceiling of plasmeld beams, a dim yellow glowglobe in one corner. Sleeping pads were spread against the walls, Boumour and Igan on two of them foot to foot, the bound form of Svengaard on another, two of the pads empty.\\n\\n \u0027Come quickly!\u0027 Harvey pleaded. \u0027She\u0027s sick.\u0027\\n\\n Igan groaned, sat up. He glanced at his watch - almost sunset on the surface. They\u0027d crawled in here just before daylight and after a night of laboring on foot up seemingly endless woods trails behind a Forest Patrol guide. Igan still ached from the unaccustomed exercise.\\n\\n Lizbeth sick?\\n\\n She\u0027d had three days since the embryo had been placed within her. The others had healed this rapidly, but they hadn\u0027t been subject to a night of stumbling along rough forest trails\\n\\n \u0027Please hurry,\u0027 Harvey pleaded.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m coming,\u0027 Igan said. And he thought. Listen to his tone change now that he needs me.\\n\\n Boumour sat up opposite him, asked, \u0027Shall I join you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait here for Glisson,\u0027 Igan said.\\n\\n \u0027Did Glisson say where he was going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To arrange for another guide. It\u0027ll be dark soon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t he ever sleep?\u0027 Boumour asked.\\n\\n \u0027Please!\u0027 Harvey begged.\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 Igan snapped. \u0027What\u0027re her symptoms?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vomiting... incoherent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let me get my bag.\u0027 Igan retrieved a thick black case from the floor near his head, glanced across at Svengaard. The man\u0027s breathing still showed the even rhythm of the narcotic they\u0027d administered before collapsing into sleep themselves. Something had to be done about Svengaard. He slowed them down.\\n\\n Harvey pulled at Igan\u0027s sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m coming! I\u0027m coming!\u0027 Igan said. He freed his arm, followed Harvey through a low hole at the end of the room and into a room similar to the one they\u0027d just vacated. Lizbeth lay on a pad beneath a single glowglobe across from them. She groaned.\\n\\n Harvey knelt beside her. \u0027I\u0027m right here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harvey,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Oh, Harvey.\u0027\\n\\n Igan joined them, lifted a pulmonometer-sphagnomometer from his bag. He pressed it against her neck, read the dial. \u0027Where do you hurt?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Ohhhh,\u0027 she moaned.\\n\\n \u0027Please,\u0027 Harvey said, looking at Igan. \u0027Please do something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stand out of the way,\u0027 Igan said.\\n\\n Harvey stood up, backed off two steps. \u0027What is it?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n Igan ignored him, taped an enzymic vampire gauge to Lizbeth\u0027s left wrist, read the dials.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong with her?\u0027 Harvey demanded. Igan undipped his instruments, restored them to his bag. \u0027Nothing\u0027s wrong with her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she\u0027s-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s perfectly normal. Most of the others reacted the same way. It\u0027s realignment of her enzymic demand system.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t there some-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Calm down!\u0027 Igan stood up, faced Harvey. \u0027She barely needs any prescription material. Pretty soon, she can do without altogether. She\u0027s in better health than you are. And she could walk into a pharmacy right now. The prescription flag wouldn\u0027t even identify her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why\u0027s she...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the embryo. It compensates for her needs to protect itself. Does it automatically.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she\u0027s sick!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A bit of glandular maladjustment, nothing else.\u0027 Igan picked up his bag. \u0027It\u0027s all part of the ancient process. The embryo says produce this, produce that. She produces. Puts a certain strain on her system.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t you do anything for her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I can. She\u0027ll be extremely hungry in a little while. We\u0027ll give her something to settle her stomach and then feed her. Provided they can produce some food in this hole.\u0027\\n\\n Lizbeth groaned, \u0027Harvey?\u0027\\n\\n He knelt beside her, clasped her hands. \u0027Yes, dear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I feel terrible.\u0027\\n\\n They\u0027ll give you something in a few minutes.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-16.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
