{"id":99285,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Potter sighed, thinking. How ignorant a man can become on a diet of managed history. He wondered then how his own diet had been adjusted and managed.\\n\\n \u0027Diderot was one of us,\u0027 Potter growled.\\n\\n Svengaard stared at him, shocked to silence by the man\u0027s... blasphemy.\\n\\n \u0027It comes down to this,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Nature doesn\u0027t like being meddled with.\u0027\\n\\n A chime sounded beneath Svengaard\u0027s desk.\\n\\n \u0027Security?\u0027 Potter asked.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the all clear,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027They\u0027re ready for us now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Central\u0027s Security hotshots are all in place,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027You will note that they didn\u0027t stoop to report to you or to me. They watch us too, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve... nothing to hide,\u0027 Svengaard said.\\n\\n \u0027Of course you haven\u0027t,\u0027 Potter said. He moved around the desk, threw an arm across Svengaard\u0027s shoulders. \u0027Come alongi It\u0027s time for us to put on the mask of Archeus. We\u0027re going to give form and organization to a living body. Veritable gods, we are.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard felt himself still lost in confusion. \u0027What\u0027ll they do... to the Durants?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Do? Not a damn\u0027 thing - unless the Durants force it. The Durants won\u0027t even know they\u0027re being watched. But Central\u0027s little boys will know everything that goes on in that lounge. The Durants won\u0027t be able to belch without the gas being subjected to a full and complete analysis. Come along.\u0027\\n\\n But Svengaard held back. \u0027Doctor Potter,\u0027 he asked, \u0027what do you think introduced that arginine chain into the Durant morula?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m closer to you than you think,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027We\u0027re fighting... instability. We\u0027ve upset the biological stability of the inheritance patterns with our false isomers and our enzyme adjustments and our meson beams. We\u0027ve undermined the chemical stability of the molecules in the germ plasm. You\u0027re a doctor. Look at the enzyme prescriptions we all have to take - how profound the adjustment we have to make to stay alive. It wasn\u0027t always that way. And whatever set up that original stability is still in there fighting. That\u0027s what I think.\u0027 Three\\n\\n THE cutting room nurses positioned the vat under the enzyme console, readied the tubes and the computer-feed-analysis board. They worked quietly, efficiently as Potter and Svengaard examined the gauges. The computer nurse racked her tapes and there came a brief whirring-clicking as she tested her board.\\n\\n Potter felt himself filled with the wakeful anxiety that always came over him before surgery. He knew it would give way presently to the charged sureness of action, but he felt snappish at the moment. He glanced at the vat gauges. The Krebs cycle was holding at 86.9, a good sixty points above death level. The vat nurse came over, examined his breather mask. He checked his microphone, \u0027Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was black as hades - the surgeon took the credit for... a joke on all the ladies.\u0027\\n\\n He heard a distinct chuckle from the computer nurse, glanced at her, but she had her back to him and her face already hidden by hood and mask.\\n\\n The vat nurse said, \u0027Microphone working. Doctor.\u0027\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t see her lips moving behind her mask, but her cheeks rippled as she spoke.\\n\\n Svengaard flexed his fingers in their gloves, took a deep breath. It smelled faintly of ammonia. He wondered why Potter always joked with the nurses. It seemed demeaning, somehow.\\n\\n Potter moved across to the vat. His sterile suit crinkled with a familiar snapping hiss as he walked. He glanced up at the wall screen, the replay monitor which showed approximately what the surgeon saw and which was the view watched by the parents. The screen presented him with a view of itself as he turned his forehead pickup lens toward it.\\n\\n Damn\u0027 parents, he thought. They make me feel guilty... all of them.\\n\\n He returned his attention to the crystal vat now bristling with instruments. The pump\u0027s churgling annoyed him.\\n\\n Svengaard moved to the other side of the vat, waiting. The breather mask hid the lower half of his face, but his eyes appeared calm. He radiated a sense of steadiness, reliability.\\n\\n How does he really feel? Potter wondered. And he reminded himself that in an emergency there wasn\u0027t a better cutting-room assistant than Sven.\\n\\n \u0027You can begin increasing the pyruvic acid,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n Svengaard nodded, depressed the feeder key.\\n\\n The computer nurse started her reels turning.\\n\\n They watched the gauges as the Krebs cycle began rising -87.0... 87.3... 87.8... 88.5.... 89.4... 90.5... 91.9...\\n\\n Now, Potter told himself, the irreversible movement of growth has started. Only death can stop it. Tell me when the Krebs cycle reaches one hundred and ten,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n He swung the scope and micromanipulators into place, leaned into the rests. Will I see what Sven saw? he wondered. He knew it wasn\u0027t likely. The lightning from outside had never struck twice in the same place. It came. It did what no human hand could do. It went away.\\n\\n Where? Potter wondered.\\n\\n The inter-ribosomal gaps swam into focus. He scanned them, boosted amplification and went down into the DNA spirals. Yes - there was the situation Sven had described. The Durant Embryo was one of those that could cross over into the more-than-human land of Central... if the surgeon succeeded.\\n\\n The confirmation left Potter oddly shaken. He shifted his attention to the mitochondrial structures, saw the evidence of the arginine intrusion. It squared precisely with Sven\u0027s description, Alpha-helices had begun firming up, revealing the telltale striations at the aneurin shifts. This one was going to resist the surgeon. This was going to be a tough one.\\n\\n Potter straightened.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Svengaard asked.\\n\\n \u0027Pretty much as you described it,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027A straightforward job.\u0027 That was for the watching parents.\\n\\n He wondered then what Security was discovering about the Durants. Would this pair be loaded down with search and probe devices disguised as conventional artifacts? Possibly. But there were rumors of new techniques being introduced by the Parents Underground... and of Cyborgs moving out of the dark shadows which had hidden them for centuries - if there were Cyborgs at all. Potter was not convinced.\\n\\n Svengaard spoke to the computer nurse, \u0027Start backing off the pyruvic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Backing off pyruvic,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Potter swung his attention to the priority rack beside him, checked the presentation - in the first row the pyrimidines, nucleic acids and proteins, then aneurin, riboflavin, pyridoxin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, choline, inositol, sulfhydryl...\\n\\n He cleared his throat, lining up his plan for the attack on the morula\u0027s defenses. \u0027I will attempt to find a pilot cell by masking the cysteine at a single locus,\u0027 he said. \u0027Stand by with sulfhydryl and prepare an intermediary tape for protein synthesis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ready for masking,\u0027 Svengaard said. He nodded to the computer nurse who racked the intermediary tape into position with a smooth sureness.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle?\u0027 Potter asked.\\n\\n \u0027One hundred and ten coming up,\u0027 Svengaard said.\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n \u0027Mark,\u0027 Svengaard said.\\n\\n Again, Potter bent to the scope. \u0027Begin the tape,\u0027 he said. Two minims of sulfhydryl.\u0027\\n\\n Slowly, Potter increased amplification, chose a cell for the masking. The momentary clouding of intrusion cleared away and he searched the surrounding cells for clues that mitosis would take off on his directed tangent. It was slow... slow.\\n\\n He\u0027d just begun and his hands already felt sweaty in their gloves.\\n\\n \u0027Stand by with adenosine triphosphate,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Svengaard presented the feeder tube in the micromanipula-tors, nodded to the vat nurse. ATP already. This was going to be a tough one.\\n\\n \u0027Begin one minim ATP,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n Svengaard depressed the feeder key. The whirring of the computer tapes sounded overly loud.\\n\\n Potter lifted his head momentarily, shook it. \u0027Wrong cell,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll try another one. Same procedure.\u0027 Again, he leaned into the scope and the rests, moved the micromanipula- tors, pushing amplification up a notch at a time. Slowly, he traced his way down into the cellular mass. Gently... Gently... The scope itself could cause irreversible damage in here.\\n\\n Ahhh, he thought, recognizing an active cell deep in the morula. Vat-statis had produced only a relative slowing in here. The cell was the scene of intense chemical activity. He recognized doubled base pairs strung on a convoluted helix of sugar phosphate as they passed his field of vision.\\n\\n His beginning anxiety had passed and he felt the old sure-ness with the often repeated sensation that the morula was an ocean in which he swam, that the cellular interior was his natural habitat.\\n\\n Two minims of sulfhydryl,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n \u0027Sulfhydryl, two minims,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Standing by with ATP.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027ATP,\u0027 Potter said, then, \u0027I\u0027m going to inhibit the exchange reaction in the mitochondrial systems. Start oligomycin and azide.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard proved his worth then by complying without hesitation. The only sign that he recognized the dangers in this procedure was a question, \u0027Shall I have an uncoupling agent ready?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stand by with arsenate in number one,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle going down,\u0027 the computer nurse said. \u0027Eighty-nine point four.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Intrusion effect,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Give me point six minim of azide.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard depressed the key.\\n\\n \u0027Point four minim oligomycin,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Oligomycin, point four,\u0027 Svengaard said. Potter felt that he lived now only through his eyes on the microscope and his hands on the micromanipulators. His existence had moved into the morula, fused with it.\\n\\n His eyes told him that peripheral mitosis had stopped... as it should under these ministrations. \u0027I think we have it,\u0027 he said. He planted a marker on the scope position, shifted focus and went down into the DNA spirals, seeking the hydroxyl deformity, the flaw that would produce a faulty heart valve. Now he was the artist, the master cutter - the pilot cell determined. Now he moved to reshape the delicate chemical factory of the inner structure.\\n\\n \u0027Prepare for the cut,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Svengaard armed the meson generator. \u0027Armed,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle seventy-one,\u0027 the computer nurse said.\\n\\n \u0027First cut,\u0027 Potter said. He let off the single, aimed burst, watched the tumbling chaos that followed. The hydroxyl appendage vanished. Nucleotides reformed.\\n\\n \u0027Hemoprotein P-450,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Stand by to reduce it with NADH.\u0027 He waited, studying the globular proteins that formed before him, watching for biologically active molecules. Now! Instinct and training combined to tell him the precise instant. \u0027Two and a half minims of P-450,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n A corner of turmoil engaged a group of polypeptide chains m the heart of the cell.\\n\\n \u0027Reduce it,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n Svengaard touched the NADH feeder key. He couldn\u0027t see what Potter saw, but the surgeon\u0027s forehead lens reproduced a slightly off-parallax view of the scope field. That plus Potter\u0027s instructions told of the slow spread of change in the cell.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle fifty-eight,\u0027 the computer nurse said.\\n\\n Second cut,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n \u0027Armed,\u0027 Svengaard said.\\n\\n Potter searched out the myxedema-latent isovalthine, found it. \u0027Give me a tape on structure,\u0027 he said. \u0027S-(iso-propylcarboxy-methyl) cystein.\u0027\\n\\n Computer tape hissed through the reels, stopped, resumed at a slow, steady pace. The isovalthine comparison image appeared in the upper right quadrant of Potter\u0027s scope field.\\n\\n He compared the structures, point for point, said. Tape off.\u0027 The comparison image vanished.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle forty-seven,\u0027 the computer nurse said.\\n\\n Potter took a deep, trembling breath. Another twenty-seven points and they\u0027d be in the death range. The Durant embryo would succumb.\\n\\n He swallowed, aimed off the meson burst.\\n\\n Isovalthine tumbled apart.\\n\\n \u0027Ready with cycloserine,\u0027 Svengaard said.\\n\\n Ahhh, good old Sven, Potter thought. You don\u0027t have to tell him every step of the way what to do.\\n\\n \u0027Comparison on D-4-aminoisoxazolidon-3,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n The computer nurse readied the tape, said, \u0027Comparison ready.\u0027\\n\\n The comparison image appeared in Potter\u0027s view field. \u0027Check,\u0027 he said. The image vanished. \u0027One point eight minims.\u0027 He watched the interaction of the enzymic functional groups as Svengaard administered the cycloserine. The amino group showed a nice, open field of affinity. Transfer-RNA fitted readily into its niches.\\n\\n \u0027Krebs cycle thirty-eight point six,\u0027 the computer nurse said.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll have to chance it. Potter thought. This embryo won\u0027t take more adjustment.\\n\\n \u0027Reduce vat stasis to half,\u0027 he said. \u0027Increase ATP. Give me micro-feed on ten minims of pyruvic acid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Reducing stasis,\u0027 Svengaard said. And he thought. This will be close. He keyed the ATP and pyruvic acid feeders.\\n\\n \u0027Give me the Krebs cycle on the half point,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n Thirty-five,\u0027 the nurse said. \u0027Thirty-four point five. Thirty-four. Thirty-three point five.\u0027 Her voice picked up speed with a shocked breathlessness: Thirty-three... thirty-two... thirty- one... thirty... twenty-nine...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Release all stasis,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Present the full amino spectrum with activated histidine. Start pyridoxin - four point two minims.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard\u0027s hands sped over the keys.\\n\\n \u0027Back-feed the protein tape,\u0027 Potter ordered. \u0027Give it the full DNA record on computer automatic.\u0027\\n\\n Tapes hissed through the reels.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s slowing,\u0027 Svengaard said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-3.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
