It was a term that could be applied to bacteria perhaps... or to weeds. One sterilized an area before bringing in lovely flowers. Why do I weep? He tried to remember if he\u0027d ever wept before. Perhaps there was a time when I wept, he thought. But it was so long ago. Ago... ago... ago... time... time... wept... wept. They were words suddenly without meaning. That\u0027s the trouble with endless life, he thought. With too much repetition, everything loses meaning. Schruille studied the green fog in his screens. A few repairsand we\u0027ll be able to send in new Folk. he thought. We\u0027ll re-populate with Folk of a safer cut. He wondered then where they\u0027d find the safer Folk. The globe\u0027s analysis boards revealed that the Seatac problem was only one of many such pockets. Symptoms were everywhere the same. He could see the flaw. It centered on the isolation of one generation from another. Lack of traditions and continuity became an obsession with the Folk... because they seemed to communicate no matter what repressions were tried. Folk sayings would crop up to reveal the deep current beneath. Schruille quoted to himself: \u0027When God first created a dissatisfied man. He put that man outside Central.\u0027 But we created these Folk,\u0027 Schruille thought. How did we create dissatisfied men? He turned then and saw that Calapine and Nourse were weeping. \u0027Why do you weep?\u0027 Schruille demanded. But they remained silent. Fifteen WHERE the last skyway ended, the van took the turn away from the undermountain tube, and held to the wide surface track on the Lester by-way. It led upward through old tunnels to the wilderness reserve and breeder-leave resorts along an almost deserted air-blasted roadbed. There were no slavelights up here, only the moon and the stabbing cyclops beam of the van\u0027s headlight. An occasional omnibus passed them on the downtrack, the passenger seats occupied by silent, moody couples, their breeder-leave ended, heading back to the megalopolis. If any of them focused on the van, it was dismissed as a supply carrier for the resorts. On a banked curve below the Homish Resort Complex, the Cyborg driver made a series of adjustments to his lift controls. Venturis narrowed. Softness went out of the ride. Turbines whined upward to a near destructive keening. The van turned off the roadbed. Within the narrow box that concealed them, Harvey Durant clutched the bench with one hand and Lizbeth with the other as the van lurched and bounced across the eroded mounds of an ancient railroad right of way, crashed through a screen of alders and turned onto a game track that followed the right of way upward through buck brush and rhododendrons. \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Lizbeth wailed. The driver\u0027s voice rasped through the speaker, \u0027We have left the road. There is nothing to fear.\u0027 Nothing to fear, Harvey thought. The idea appeared so ludicrous he had to suppress a chuckle which he realized might be near hysteria. The driver had turned off all exterior lights and was relying now on the moon and his infra-red vision. The Cyborg-boosted vision revealed the trail as a snail track through the brush. The van gulped this track for two kilometers, leaving a dusty, leaf-whirling wake to a point where the game trail intersected a forest patrol road - a cleared track matted with dead sallow and bracken from the passage of the patrol vehicles. Here, it turned right like a great hissing prehistoric monster, labored up a hill, roared down the other side and to the top of another hill where it stopped. Turbines whined down to silence and the van settled onto its skids. The driver emerged, a blocky stub-legged figure with glittering prosthetic arms attached for its present needs. A side panel was ripped off and the Cyborg began unloading cargo, tossing it indiscriminately down through a stand of hemlocki into a deep gully. Within their compartment, Igan lurched to his feet, put his mouth near the speaker- phone, hissed, \u0027Where are we?\u0027 Silence. That was stupid,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027How do you know why he\u0027s stopped?\u0027 Igan ignored the insult. It came after all from a semi-educated dolt. \u0027You can hear him shifting cargo,\u0027 Igan said. He leaned across Harvey, pounded a palm against the compartment\u0027s side. \u0027What\u0027s going on out there?\u0027 \u0027Oh, sit down,\u0027 Harvey said. He put a hand on Igan\u0027s chest, pushed. The surgeon stumbled backward onto the opposite bench. Igan started to bounce back, his face dark, eyes glaring, Boumour restrained him, rumbled, \u0027Serenity, friend Igan.\u0027 Igan settled back. Slowly, a look of patience came over his features. \u0027It\u0027s odd,\u0027 he said, \u0027how one\u0027s emotions have a way of asserting themselves in spite of-\u0027 \u0027That will pass,\u0027 Boumour said, Harvey found Lizbeth\u0027s hand, clutched it, signaled, \u0027Iran\u0027s chest - it\u0027s convex and hard as plasmeld. I felt it under his jacket.\u0027 \u0027You think he\u0027s Cyborg?\u0027 \u0027He breathes normally.\u0027 \u0027And he has emotions. I read fear on him.\u0027 \u0027Yes...but...\u0027 \u0027We will be careful.\u0027 Boumour said, \u0027You should have placed more trust in us, Durant. Doctor Igan had deduced that our driver would not be moving cargo unless certain sounds were safe.\u0027 \u0027How do we know who\u0027s moving cargo?\u0027 Harvey asked. A look of caution fled across Boumour\u0027s massive calm. Harvey read it, smiled. \u0027Harvey!\u0027 Lizbeth said. \u0027You don\u0027t think the-\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s our driver out there,\u0027 Harvey reassured her. \u0027I can smell. the wilderness in the air. There\u0027s been no sound of a struggle. One doesn\u0027t take a Cyborg without a struggle.\u0027 \u0027But where are we?\u0027 she asked. \u0027In the mountains, the wilderness,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027From the feel of the ride, we\u0027re well off the main by-ways.\u0027 Abruptly, their compartment lurched, slid sideways. The single light was extinguished. In the sudden darkness, the wall behind Harvey dropped away. He clutched Lizbeth, whirled, found himself looking out into darkness... moonlight... their driver a blocky shadow against a distant panorama of the megalopolis with its shimmering networks of light. The moon silvered the tops of trees below them and there was a sharp smell of forest duff, resinous, dank, churned up by the van and not yet settled. The wilderness lay silent as though waiting, analyzing the intrusion. \u0027Out,\u0027 the driver said. The Cyborg turned. Harvey saw the features suddenly illuminated by moonlight, said, \u0027Glisson!\u0027 \u0027Greetings, Durant,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Why you?\u0027 Harvey asked. \u0027Why not?\u0027 Glisson asked. \u0027Get out of there now.\u0027 Harvey said: \u0027But my wife isn\u0027t-\u0027 \u0027I know about your wife, Durant. She\u0027s had plenty of time since the treatment. She can walk if she doesn\u0027t exert herself.\u0027 Igan spoke at Harvey\u0027s ear, \u0027She\u0027ll be quite all right. Sit her up gently and help her down.\u0027 \u0027I... feel all right,\u0027 Lizbeth said. \u0027Here.\u0027 She put an arm over Harvey\u0027s shoulder. Together, they slid down to the ground. Igan followed, asked. \u0027Where are we?\u0027 \u0027We are someplace headed for someplace else,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027What is the condition of our prisoner?\u0027 Boumour spoke from within the compartment, \u0027He\u0027s coming around. Help me lift him out.\u0027 \u0027Why\u0027ve we stopped?\u0027 Harvey asked. There is steep climbing ahead,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027We\u0027re dropping the load. A van isn\u0027t built for this work.\u0027 Boumour and Igan shouldered past them carrying Svengaard, propped him against a stump beside the track. \u0027Wait here while I disengage the trailer,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You might be considering whether we should abandon Svengaard.\u0027 Hearing his name, Svengaard opened his eyes, found himself staring out and down at the distant lights of the megalopolis., His jaw ached where Harvey had struck him and there was a throbbing in his head. He felt hungry, thirsty. His hands were\u0027. numb beyond the bindings. A dry smell of evergreen needles filled his nostrils. He sneezed. \u0027Perhaps we should get rid of Svengaard,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027I think not,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027He\u0027s a trained man, a possible ally. We\u0027re going to need trained men.\u0027 Svengaard looked toward the voices. They stood beside the van which was a long silvery shape behind a stubby double cab. A wrenching of metal sounded there. The trailer slid backward on its skids almost two meters before stopping against a mound of dirt. Glisson returned, squatted beside Svengaard. \u0027What is our decision?\u0027 asked the Cyborg. \u0027Kill him or keep him?\u0027 Harvey gulped, felt Lizbeth clutch his arm. \u0027Keep him yet awhile,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027If he causes no more trouble,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027We could always use his parts,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Or try to grow a new Svengaard and retrain it.\u0027 The Cyborg stood. \u0027An immediate decision isn\u0027t necessary. It is a thing to consider.\u0027 Svengaard remained silent, frozen by the emotionless clarity of the man\u0027s speech. A hard, brutal man, he thought. A tough man, prepared for any violence. A killer. \u0027Into the cab with him then,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Everyone into the cab. We must get...\u0027 The Cyborg broke off, stared out toward the megalopolis. Svengaard turned toward the strings of blue-white light glittering far away and cold. A winking golden flare had appeared amidst the lights on his left. Another blazed up beyond it - a giant\u0027s bonfire set against the background of distant, moon-frosted mountains. More yellow flares appeared to the right. A bone-chilling rattle of sonics shook him, jarred a sympathetic metal dissonance from the van. \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Lizbeth hissed. \u0027Quiet!\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Be quiet and observe.\u0027 \u0027Gods of life,\u0027 Lizbeth whispered, \u0027what is it?\u0027 \u0027It is the death of a megalopolis,\u0027 Boumour said. Again, sonics rattled the van. That hurts,\u0027 Lizbeth whimpered. Harvey pulled her close, muttered. Damn them!\u0027 \u0027Up here it hurts,\u0027 Igan said, his voice chillingly formal. \u0027Down there it kills.\u0027 Green fog began emerging from the wilderness some ten kilometers below them. It rolled out and down like a furious downy sea beneath the moon, engulfing everything - hills, the gem-like lights, the yellow flares. \u0027Did you think they would use the death fog?\u0027 Boumour asked. \u0027We knew they would use it,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027Sterilize the area.\u0027 \u0027What is it?\u0027 Harvey demanded. \u0027It comes from the vents where they administered the contraceptive gas,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027One particle on your skin -the end of you.\u0027 Igan moved around, stared down at Svengaard. They are the ones who love us and care for us,\u0027 he mocked. \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Can you not hear?\u0027 Igan asked. \u0027Can you not see? Your friends the Optimen are sterilizing Seatac. Did you have friends there?\u0027 \u0027Friends?\u0027 There was a broken quality to Svengaard\u0027s voice. He turned back to stare at the green fog. The distant lights had all been extinguished. Again, sonics chattered through them, shook the ground, rattled the van. \u0027What do you think of them now?\u0027 Igan asked. Svengaard shook his head, unable to speak. He wondered why he had no sensory fuse system to shut off this scene. He felt chained to awareness through sense organs gone abnormal beyond any previous experience... a permissive aberration. His senses were deceiving him, that was it. This was a special case of self-deception. \u0027Why don\u0027t you answer me?\u0027 Igan asked. \u0027Leave him alone,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027We\u0027ve griefs of our own. Haven\u0027t you any feelings?\u0027 \u0027He sees it and does not believe,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027How could they?\u0027 Lizbeth whispered. \u0027Self-preservation,\u0027 Boumour rumbled. \u0027A trait our friend Svengaard doesn\u0027t seem to have. Perhaps it was cut out of him.\u0027 Svengaard stared at the rolling green cloud. So silent and stealthy it was. The great reach of darkness where once there had been light and the life filled him with a raw awareness of his own mortality. He thought of friends down there - the hospital staff - embryos, his playmate-wife. All destroyed. Svengaard felt emptied, incapable of any emotion - even grief. He could only question. What was their purpose? \u0027Into the cab with him,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027On the floor in the rear.\u0027 Ungentle hands lifted Svengaard - he identified Boumour and Glisson. The driver\u0027s unemotional quality confused Svengaard. He had never before encountered quite that abstract detachment in a human being. They pushed him onto the floor of the van\u0027s cab. The sharp edge of a seat brace dug into his side. Feet came in around him. Someone put a foot on his stomach, recoiled. The turbines came alive. A door was slammed. They glided into motion. Svengaard sank into a kind of stupor. Lizbeth seated above him heaved a deep sigh. Hearing it, Svengaard was roused to a feeling of compassion for her, his first emotion since the shock of seeing the megalopolis die. Why did they do it? he asked himself. Why? In the darkness, Lizbeth gripped Harvey\u0027s hand. She could see in an occasional patch of moonglow the outline of Glisson directly ahead of her. The Cyborg\u0027s minimal movement, the sense of power in every action, filled her with growing disquiet. The scar of her operation itched. She wanted to scratch, but feared calling attention to herself. The Courtier Service had been a long time building its own organization, deceiving both the Cyborgs and the Optimen. They\u0027d done it partly through self-effacement. Now, in her fear, she sank back into that treatment.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-14.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
