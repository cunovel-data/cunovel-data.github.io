{"id":99288,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Allgood stifled a feeling of rage at the interruption. Didn\u0027t the fool know that the Optimen must always appear to lead the interview? The words and images of your report have been seen, analyzed and put away,\u0027 Nourse rumbled. \u0027Now, it is the non-report that we wish.\u0027 Non-report? Allgood asked himself. Does he think we\u0027ve hidden something? \u0027Little Max,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Have you bowed to our necessity and questioned the computer nurse under narcosis?\u0027 Here it comes, Allgood thought. He took a deep breath, said, \u0027She has been questioned, Calapine.\u0027 Igan took his place beside Boumour, said. There\u0027s something I wish to say about that if I- \u0027 \u0027Hold your tongue, pharmacist,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027We talk to Max.\u0027 Igan bowed his head, thought, How dangerous this is! And all because of that fool nurse. She wasn\u0027t even one of us. No Cyborg-of-the-register knows her. A member of no cell or platoon. An accidental, a Sterne, and she puts us in this terrible peril! Allgood saw that Igan\u0027s hands trembled, wondered, What\u0027s driving these surgeons? They can\u0027t be such fools. \u0027Was it not a deliberate thing that nurse did?\u0027 Calapine asked. \u0027Yes, Calapine,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Your agents did not see it, yet we knew it had to be,\u0027 Calapine said. She turned to scan the instruments of the control center, returned her attention to Allgood. \u0027Say now why this was.\u0027 Allgood sighed. \u0027I have no excuses, Calapine. The men have been censured.\u0027 \u0027Say now why the nurse acted thus,\u0027 Calapine ordered. Allgood wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Boumour and Igan. They looked at the floor. He looked back to Calapine, at her face shimmering within the globe. \u0027We were unable to discover her motives, Calapine.\u0027 \u0027Unable?\u0027 Nourse demanded. \u0027She... ahh... ceased to exist during the interrogation, Nourse,\u0027 Allgood said. As the Tuyere stiffened, sitting bolt upright in their thrones, he added, \u0027A flaw in her genetic cutting, so the pharmacists tell me.\u0027 \u0027A profound pity,\u0027 Nourse said, settling back. Igan looked up, blurted, \u0027It could\u0027ve been a deliberate self-erasure, Nourse.\u0027 That damn\u0027 fool! Allgood thought. But Nourse stared now at Igan. \u0027You were present, Igan?\u0027 \u0027Boumour and I administered the narcotics,\u0027 And she died, Igan thought. But we did not kill her. She died and we\u0027ll be blamed for it. Where could she have learned the trick of stopping her own heart? Only Cyborgs are supposed to know and teach it. \u0027Deliberate... self-erasure?\u0027 Nourse asked. Even when considered indirectly, the idea held terrifying implications. \u0027Max!\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Say now if you used excessive... cruelty.\u0027 She leaned forward, wondering why she wanted him to admit barbarity. \u0027She suffered nothing, Calapine;\u0027 Allgood said. Calapine sat back disappointed. Could he be lying? She read her instruments: Calmness. He wasn\u0027t lying. \u0027Pharmacist,\u0027 Nourse said, \u0027explain your opinion.\u0027 \u0027We examined her carefully,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027It couldn\u0027t have been the narcotics. There\u0027s no way...\u0027 \u0027Some of us think it was a genetic flaw,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027There\u0027s disagreement,\u0027 Igan said. He glanced at Allgood, feeling the man\u0027s disapproval. It had to be done, though. The Optimen must be made to know disquiet. When they could be tricked into acting emotionally, they made mistakes. The plan called for them to make mistakes now. They must be put off balance - subtly, delicately. \u0027Your opinion. Max?\u0027 Nourse asked. He watched carefully. They\u0027d been getting poorer models lately, doppelganger degeneration. \u0027We\u0027ve already taken cellular matter, Nourse,\u0027 Allgood said, \u0027and are growing a duplicate. If we get a true copy, well check the question of genetic flaw.\u0027 \u0027It is a pity the doppelganger won\u0027t have the original\u0027s memories,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Pity of pities,\u0027 Calapine said. She looked at Schruille. \u0027Is this not true, Schruille?\u0027 Schruille looked up at her without answering. Did she think she could bait him the way she did the merest This woman had a mate?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027Yes, Nourse,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Fertile union?\u0027 \u0027No, Nourse,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027A Sterrie.\u0027 \u0027Compensate the mate,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Another woman, a bit of leisure. Let him think she was loyal to us.\u0027 Allgood nodded, said, \u0027We are giving him a woman, Nourse, who will keep him under constant surveillance.\u0027 A trill of laughter escaped Calapine. \u0027Why has no one mentioned this Potter, the genetic engineer?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I was coming to him, Calapine,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Has anyone examined the embryo?\u0027 Schruille asked, looking up suddenly. \u0027No, Schruille Allgood said. \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027If this is a concerted action to escape genetic controls, Schruille, we don\u0027t want members of the organization to know we suspect them. Not yet. First, we must learn all about these people - the Durants, their friends. Potter... everyone.\u0027 \u0027But the embryo\u0027s the key to the entire thing,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027What was done to it? What is it?\u0027 \u0027It is bait, Schruille,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Bait?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Schruille, to catch whoever else may be involved.\u0027 \u0027But what was done to it?\u0027 \u0027How can that matter, Schruille, as long as we can... as long as we have complete control over it.\u0027 The embryo is being guarded most adroitly, I hope,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Most adroitly, Nourse.\u0027 \u0027Send the pharmacist Svengaard to us,\u0027 Calapine ordered. \u0027Svengaard... Calapine?\u0027 Allgood asked. \u0027You need not know why,\u0027 she said. \u0027Merely send him.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Calapine.\u0027 She stood up to signify the end of the interview. The acolytes turned around, still swinging their thuribles, prepared now to escort the meres from the hall. But Calapine was not finished. She stared at Allgood, said, \u0027Look at me. Max.\u0027 He looked, recognizing that strange, studying set to her eyes. \u0027Am I not beautiful?\u0027 she asked. Allgood stared at her, the slender figure with its outlines softened by the robe and curtains of power within the globe. She was beautiful as were many Optimen females. But the beauty repelled him with its threatening perfection. She would live indefinitely, already had lived forty or fifty thousand years. But one day his lesser flesh would reject the medical replacements and the enzyme prescriptions. He would die while she went on and on and on. His lesser flesh rejected her. \u0027You are beautiful, Calapine,\u0027 he said. \u0027Your eyes never admit it,\u0027 she said. \u0027What do you want, Cal?\u0027 Nourse asked. \u0027Do you want this... do you want Max?\u0027 \u0027I want his eyes,\u0027 she said. \u0027Just his eyes.\u0027 Nourse looked at Allgood, said, \u0027Women.\u0027 His voice held a note of false camaraderie. Allgood stood astonished. He had never heard that tone from an Optiman before. \u0027I make a point,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Don\u0027t interrupt my words with male jokes. In your heart of hearts. Max, how do you feel about me?\u0027 \u0027Ahhhh,\u0027 Nourse said. He nodded. \u0027I shall say it for you,\u0027 she said as Allgood remained mute. \u0027You worship me. Never forget that. Max. You worship me.\u0027 She looked at Boumour and Igan, dismissed them with a wave of her hand. Allgood lowered his eyes, feeling the truth in her words. He turned, and with the acolytes flanking them, led Igan and Boumour out of the hall. As they emerged onto the steps, the acolytes held back and the barrier dropped. Igan and Boumour turned left, noting a new building at the end of the long esplanade which fronted Administration. They saw its machicolated walls, the openings fitted with colored filters which sent bursts of red, blue and green light upon the surrounding air, and they recognized that it blocked the way they had intended to take out of Central. A building suddenly erected, another Optiman toy. They saw it and planned their steps accordingly with the automatic acceptance that marked them as regulars in the Optiman demesne. The meres and inhabitants of Central seemed to know their way through the arabesques of its roads and streets by an instinct. The place defied cartographers because the Optimen were too subject to change and whim. \u0027Igan!\u0027 It was Allgood calling from behind them. They turned, waited for him to catch up. Allgood planted himself in front of them, hands on hips, said, \u0027Do you worship her, too?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t speak foolishness,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027No,\u0027 Allgood said. His eyes appeared to be sunk in pockets above the high cheekbones. \u0027I belong to no Folk cult, no breeder congregation. How can I worship her?\u0027 \u0027But you do,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027They are the real religion of our world,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027You do not have to belong to a cult or carry a talisman to know this. Calapine merely told you that, if there is a conspiracy, those belonging to it are heretics.\u0027 \u0027Is that what she meant?\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 \u0027And she must know what is done to heretics,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Without a doubt\u0027, Boumour said. Six SVENGAARD had seen this building in the tri-casts and entertainment vids. He\u0027d heard descriptions of the Hall of Counsel -but actually to be standing here at the quarantine wall with the copper sheen of sunset over the hills across from it... he\u0027d never dreamed this could occur. Elevator caps stood out like plasmeld warts on the hillock in front of him. There were other low hills beyond with piled buildings on them that could\u0027ve been mistaken for rock out- croppings. A lone woman passed him on the esplanade pulling a ground-effect cart filled with oddly shaped bundles. Svengaard found himself worried about what the bundles might contain, but he knew he dared not ask or show undue curiosity. The red triangle of a pharmacy outlet glowed on a pillar beside him. He passed it, glanced back at his escort. He had come half way across the continent in the tube with an entire car to himself except for the escort, an agent from T-Security. Deep into Central they\u0027d come, the gray- suited T-Security agent always beside him. Svengaard began climbing the steps. Already, Central was beginning to weigh on him. There was a sense of something disastrous about the place. Even though he suspected the source of the feeling, he couldn\u0027t shake it off. It was all the Folk nonsense you could never quite evade, he\u0027d decided. The Folk were a people for the most part without legends or ancient myths except where such matters touched the Optimen. In the Folk memories. Central and the Optimen were fixed with sinister omens compounded of awesome fear and adulation. Why did they summon me? Svengaard asked himself. The escort refused to say. They were stopped by the wall and waited now, silent, nervous. Even the agent was nervous, Svengaard saw. Why did they summon me? The agent cleared his throat, said, \u0027You have all the protocol straight?\u0027 \u0027I think so,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Once you get into the hall, keep pace with the acolytes who\u0027ll escort you from there. You\u0027ll be interviewed by the Tuyere -Nourse, Schruille and Calapine. Remember to use their names when you address them individually. Use no such words as death or kill or die. Avoid the very concepts if you can. Let them lead the interview. Best not to volunteer anything.\u0027 Svengaard took a trembling breath. Have they brought me here to advance me? he wondered. That must be it. I\u0027ve served my apprenticeship under such men as Potter and Igan. I\u0027m being promoted to Central. \u0027And don\u0027t say \u0027doctor\u0027,\u0027 the escort said. \u0027Doctors are pharmacists or genetic engineers in here.\u0027 \u0027I understand.\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Allgood wants a complete report on the interview afterward,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027Yes, of course,\u0027 Svengaard said. The quarantine barrier lifted. \u0027In you go,\u0027 the agent said. \u0027You\u0027re not coming with me?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027Not invited,\u0027 the agent said. He turned, went down the steps. Svengaard swallowed, entered the silver gloom of the portico, stepped through to find himself in the long hall with an escort of six acolytes, three to a side, swinging thuribles from which pink smoke wafted. He smelled the antiseptics in the smoke. The big red globe at the end of the hall dominated the place. Its open segment showing flashing and winking lights; the moving shapes inside fascinated Svengaard.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-6.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
