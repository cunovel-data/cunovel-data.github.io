{"id":99284,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"It had to be. The Durant embryo, that beautiful thing with its wondrous potential, was now resistant - a genetic unknown... if Potter could succeed where others had failed. Two\\n\\n DR VYASLAV POTTER stopped at the Records Desk on his way into the hospital. He was faintly tired after the long tube-shunt from Central to Seatac Megalopolis, still he told an off- color joke about primitive reproduction to the gray-haired duty nurse. She chuckled as she hunted up Svengaard\u0027s latest report on the Durant embryo. She put the report on the counter and stared at Potter. He glanced at the folder\u0027s cover and looked up to meet the nurse\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n Is it possible? he wondered. But... no: she\u0027s too old. She wouldn\u0027t even make a good playmate. Anyway, the big-dome\u0027s wouldn\u0027t grant us a breeding permit. And he reminded himself:\\n\\n I\u0027m a Zeek... a Flis\u0027K.. The Zeek gene-shaping had gone through a brief popularity in the region of Timbuctu Megalopolis during the early nineties. It produced curly black hair, a skin one shade lighter than milk chocolate, soft brown eyes and a roly-poly face of utmost benignity, all on a tall, strong body. A Zeek. A Vyaslav Potter.\\n\\n It had yet to produce an Optiman, male or female, and never a viable gamete match.\\n\\n Potter had long since given up. He was one of those who\u0027d voted to discontinue the Zeek. He thought of the Optimen with whom he dealt and sneered at himself. There but for the brown eyes... But the sneer no longer gave him a twinge of bitterness.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 he said, smiling at the nurse, \u0027these Durants whose emb I have this morning - I cut them both. Maybe I\u0027ve been in this business too long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, go on with you. Doctor,\u0027 she said with an arch turn of her head. \u0027You\u0027re not even middle-aged. You don\u0027t look a day over a hundred.\u0027\\n\\n He glanced at the folder. \u0027But here are these kids bringing me their emb to cut and I...\u0027He shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to tell them?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I mean that you had them, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I probably won\u0027t even see them,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know how it is. Anyway, sometimes people aren\u0027t happy with their cut... sometimes they wish they\u0027d a little more of this, less of that. They tend to blame the surgeon. They don\u0027t understand, can\u0027t understand the problems we have in the cutting room.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the Durants seem like a very successful cut,\u0027 she said. \u0027Normal, happy... perhaps a little over-worried about their son, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Their genotype is one of the most successful,\u0027 he said. He tapped the record folder with a forefinger. \u0027Here\u0027s the proof: they had a viable with potential.\u0027 He lifted a thumb in the time- honored gesture for Optiman.\\n\\n \u0027You should be very proud of them,\u0027 she said. \u0027My family\u0027s had only fifteen viables in a hundred and eighty-proof: they had a viable with potential.\u0027 He lifted a thumb gesture.\\n\\n He pursed his lips into a moue of commiseration, wondering how he let himself get drawn into these conversations with women, especially with nurses. It was that little seed of hope that never died, he suspected. It was cut from the same stuff that produced the wild rumors, the quack \u0027breeder doctors\u0027 and the black market in \u0027true breed\u0027 nostrums. It was the thing that sold the little figurines of Optiman-Calapine because of the unfounded rumor that she had produced a viable. It was the thing that wore out the big toes of fertility idols from the kisses of the hopeful.\\n\\n His moue of commiseration became a cynical sneer. Hopeful! If they only knew. \u0027Were you aware the Durants are going to watch?\u0027 the nurse asked.\\n\\n His head jerked up and he glared at her. \u0027It\u0027s all over the hospital,\u0027 she said. \u0027Security\u0027s been alerted. The Durants have been scanned and they\u0027re in Lounge Five with closed circuit to the cutting room.\u0027\\n\\n Anger blazed through him. \u0027Damn it to hell! Can\u0027t they do anything right in this stupid place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now, Doctor,\u0027 she said, stiffening into the prime departmental dictator. \u0027There\u0027s no call to lose your temper. The Durants quoted the law. That ties our hands and you know it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stupid damn\u0027 law,\u0027 Potter muttered, but his anger had subsided. The law! he thought. More of the damn\u0027 masquerade. He had to admit, though, that they needed the law. Without Public Law 10927, people might ask the wrong kinds of questions. And no doubt Svengaard had done his bumbling best to try to dissuade the Durants.\\n\\n Potter assumed a rueful grin, said, \u0027Sorry I snapped like that. I\u0027ve had a bad week.\u0027 He sighed. \u0027They just don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is there any other record you wish. Doctor?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n Rapport was gone. Potter saw. \u0027No thanks,\u0027 he said. He took the Durant folder, headed for Svengaard\u0027s office. Just his luck: a pair of watchers. It meant plenty of extra work. Naturally!\\n\\n The Durants couldn\u0027t be content with seeing the tape after the cut. Oh, no. They had to be on the scene. That meant the Durants weren\u0027t as innocent as they might appear - no matter what this hospital\u0027s Security staff said. The public just did not insist anymore. That was supposed to have been cut out of them.\\n\\n The statistical few who defied their genetic shaping now required special attention.\\n\\n And Potter reminded himself, I did the original cut on this pair. There was no mistake.\\n\\n He ran into Svengaard outside the latter\u0027s office, heard the man\u0027s quick resume. Svengaard then began babbling about his Security arrangements.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t give a damn what your Security people say,\u0027 Potter barked. \u0027We\u0027ve new instructions. Central Emergency\u0027s to be called in every case of this kind.\u0027\\n\\n They went into Svengaard\u0027s office. It pretended to wood paneling - a comer room with a view of flowered roof gardens and terraces built of the omnipresent three-phase regenerative plasmeld, the \u0027plasty\u0027 of the Folk patios. Nothing must age or degenerate in this best of all Optiman worlds. Nothing except people.\\n\\n \u0027Central Emergency?\u0027 Svengaard asked.\\n\\n \u0027No exceptions,\u0027 Potter said. He sat in Svengaard\u0027s chair, put his feet on Svengaard\u0027s desk, and brought the little ivory-colored phone box to his stomach with its screen only inches from his face. He punched in Security\u0027s number and his own code identification.\\n\\n Svengaard sat on a corner of the desk across from him, appearing both angry and cowed. They were scanned, I tell you,\u0027 he said. They were carrying no unusual devices. There\u0027s nothing unusual about them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Except they insist on watching,\u0027 Potter said. He jiggled the phone key. \u0027What\u0027s keeping those ignoramuses?\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard said, \u0027But the law-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Damn the law!\u0027 Potter said. \u0027You know as well as I do that we could route the view signal from the cutting room through an editing computer and show the parents anything we want. Has it ever occurred to you to wonder why we don\u0027t do just that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why... they... ah...\u0027 Svengaard shook his head. The question had caught him off balance. Why wasn\u0027t that done? The statistics showed a certain number of parents would insist on watching and...\\n\\n \u0027It was tried,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Somehow, the parents detected the computer\u0027s hand in the tape.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Weren\u0027t the parents questioned and...\u0027 They killed themselves.\u0027 \u0027Killed them- How?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know.\u0027 Svengaard tried to swallow in a dry throat. He began to get a picture of intense excitement just under Security\u0027s surface. He said, \u0027What about the statistical ratio of- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Statistical, my ass!\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n A heavy masculine voice came from the phone: \u0027Who\u0027re you talking to?\u0027\\n\\n Potter focused on the screen, said, \u0027I was talking to Sven. This viable he called me on-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is a viable?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes! It\u0027s a viable with the full potential, but the parents insist on watching the-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll have a full crew on the way by tube in ten minutes,\u0027 said the voice on the phone. \u0027They\u0027re at Friscopolis. Shouldn\u0027t take \u0027em more than a few minutes.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard rubbed wet palms against the sides of his working smock. He couldn\u0027t see that face on the phone, but the voice sounded like Max Allgood, T-Security\u0027s boss.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll delay the cut until your people get here,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027The records are being faxed to you and should be on your desk in a few minutes. There\u0027s another-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that embryo everything we were told?\u0027 asked the man on the phone. \u0027Any flaws?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A latent myxedema, a projective faulty heart valve, but the- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027ll call you after I\u0027ve seen the-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Damn it to hell!\u0027 Potter erupted. \u0027Will you let me get ten words out of my mouth without interrupting?\u0027 He glared into the screen. \u0027There\u0027s something here more important than flaw and the parents.\u0027 Potter glanced up at Svengaard, back to the screen. \u0027Sven reports he saw an outside adjustment of the arginine deficiency.\u0027\\n\\n A low whistle came from the phone, then, \u0027Reliable?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Depend on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did it follow the pattern of the other eight?\u0027\\n\\n Potter glanced up at Svengaard, who nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Sven says yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They won\u0027t like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did Sven see enough to get any... new ideas on it?\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a strong possibility it isn\u0027t significant,\u0027 the man on the phone said. \u0027In a system of increasing determinism- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Potter sneered. \u0027In a system of increasing determinism you get more and more indeterminism. You might as well say in a foofram of increasing haggers-maggle- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s what they believe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So they say. I believe Nature doesn\u0027t like being meddled with.\u0027\\n\\n Potter stared into the screen. For some reason, he recalled his youth, the beginning of his medical studies and the day he\u0027d learned how very close his genotype had been to the Optiman. He found that the old core of hatred had become mildly amused tolerance and cynicism.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see why they put up with you,\u0027 the man on the phone said.\\n\\n \u0027Because I was very close,\u0027 Potter whispered. He wondered then how close the Durant embryo would be. I\u0027ll do my best, he thought. The man on the phone cleared his throat, said, \u0027Yes, well I\u0027ll depend on you to handle things at your end. The embryo ought to provide some verification of the outside inter- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be a total ass!\u0027 Potter snapped. The emb will bear out Sven\u0027s report to the last enzyme. You tend to your job; we\u0027ll do ours.\u0027 He slapped the cut-off, pushed the phone back onto the desk and sat staring at it. Pompous damned... no - he\u0027s what he is because he\u0027s what he is. Comes from living too close to them. Comes from the original cut. Maybe I\u0027d be an ass too if that\u0027s what I had to be.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard tried to swallow in a dry throat. He\u0027d never before heard such an argument or such frank talk from the men who operated out of Central.\\n\\n \u0027Shocked you, eh, Sven?\u0027 Potter asked. He dropped his feet to the floor.\\n\\n Svengaard shrugged. He felt ill-at-ease.\\n\\n Potter studied the man. Svengaard was good within his limits, but he lacked creative imagination. A brilliant surgeon, but without that special quality he was often a dull tool.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a good man, Sven,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027Dependable. That\u0027s what your record says, you know. Dependable. You\u0027ll never be anything else. Weren\u0027t meant to be. In your particular niche, though, you\u0027re it.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard heard only the praise, said, \u0027It\u0027s good to be appreciated, of course, but- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we have work to do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It will be difficult,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027Now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think that outside adjustment was an accidental thing?\u0027 Potter asked.\\n\\n \u0027I - I\u0027d like to believe that\u0027 - Svengaard wet his lips with his tongue - it wasn\u0027t determined, that no agency...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d like to lay it to uncertainty, to Heisenberg,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027The principle of uncertainty, some result of our own meddling - everything an accident in the capricious universe.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard felt stung by a quality of harshness in Potter\u0027s voice, said, \u0027Not precisely. I meant only that I hoped no super causal agency had a hand in-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God? You don\u0027t really mean you\u0027re afraid this is the action of a deity?\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard looked away. \u0027I remember in school,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were lecturing. You said we always have to be ready to face the fact that the reality we see will be shockingly different from anything our theories led us to suspect.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did I say that? Did I really say that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something\u0027s out there, eh? Something beyond our instruments. It\u0027s never heard of Heisenberg. It isn\u0027t uncertain at all. It moves.\u0027 His voice lowered. \u0027It moves directly. It adjusts things.\u0027 He cocked his head to one side. \u0027Ah-hah! The ghost of Heisenberg is confounded!\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard glared at Potter. The man was mocking him. He spoke stiffly, \u0027Heisenberg did point out that we have our limits. If he taught us truly, how can we tell whether the unknown\u0027s an accident or the deliberate intent of God? What\u0027s the use of even asking?\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard spoke defensively, \u0027We appear to manage somehow.\u0027\\n\\n Potter startled him by laughing, head tipped back, body shaking with enjoyment. The laughter subsided and presently Potter said, \u0027Sven, you are a gem. I mean that. If it weren\u0027t for the ones like you, we\u0027d still be back in the muck and mire, running from glaciers and saber-tooth tigers.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard fought to keep anger from his voice, said, \u0027What do they think this arginine adjustment is?\u0027 Potter stared at him, measuring, then, \u0027Damned if I haven\u0027t underestimated you, Sven. Apologies, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard shrugged. Potter was acting oddly today -astonishing reactions, strange eruptions of emotion. \u0027Do you know what they say about this?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027You heard Max on the phone,\u0027 Potter said.\\n\\n So that was Allgood, Svengaard thought.\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, I know,\u0027 Potter growled. \u0027Max has it all wrong. They say gene-shaping inflicts itself on nature - on a nature that can never be reduced to mechanical systems and, therefore, to stationary matter. You can\u0027t stop the movement, see? It\u0027s an extended system phenomenon, energy seeking a level that\u0027s- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Extending system?\u0027 Svengaard asked.\\n\\n Potter looked up at the man\u0027s scowling face. The question focused Potter\u0027s attention abruptly on the differences in thought patterns between those who lived close to Central and those who touched the Optiman world only through reports and second-hand associations.\\n\\n We are so different. Potter thought. Just as the Optimen are different from us and Sven here is different from the Sterries and breeders. We\u0027re cut off from each other... and none of us has a past. Only the Optimen have a past. But each has an individual past... selfishly personal... and ancient.\\n\\n \u0027Extended system,\u0027 Potter said. \u0027From the microcosmos to the macrocosmos, they say all is order and systems. The idea of matter is insubstantial. AU is collisions of energy - some appearing large, swift and spectacular... some small, gentle and slow. But this too is relative. The aspects of energy are infinite. Everything depends on the viewpoint of the observer. For each change of viewpoint, the energy rules change. There exist an infinite number of energy rules, each set dependent on the twin aspects of viewpoint and background. In an extended system, this thing from outside assumed the aspect of a node appearing on a standing wave. That\u0027s what they say.\u0027\\n\\n Svengaard slipped off the desk, stood in a rapture of awe. He felt that he\u0027d had a fleeting glimpse, a wisp of understanding that penetrated every question he might ask about the universe.\\n\\n Could that be what it\u0027s like to work out of Central? he wondered.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a great summation, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Potter demanded. He stood up. \u0027A truly great idea!\u0027 A chuckle shook him. \u0027You know, a guy named Diderot had that idea. It was around 1750 or thereabout. They spoon-feed it to us now. Great wisdom!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe Diderot was... one of them\u0027 Svengaard ventured. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-2.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
