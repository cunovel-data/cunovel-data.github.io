{"id":99294,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"They\u0027ve made themselves the only free individuals in our world,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But individuals don\u0027t evolve. Populations evolve, not individuals. We have no population.\u0027 \u0027But the Folk-\u0027 \u0027Yes, the Folk! Who among us are allowed to mate?\u0027 Igan shook his head. \u0027You\u0027re a gene surgeon, man! Haven\u0027t you identified the pattern yet?\u0027 \u0027Pattern? What pattern? What do you mean?\u0027 Svengaard pushed himself up in the chair, cursed his bindings. His arms and legs felt numb. The Optimen hold to one cardinal rule of mating,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Return to the standard average. They allow a random interchange with the standard average organism to suppress development of unique individuals. Such few unique individuals as occur are not allowed to breed.\u0027 Svengaard shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t believe you,\u0027 he said. But he could feel the beginnings of doubt. His own case - no matter which mate he chose, the breeding permit was denied. He\u0027d examined the genetic matchings himself, had seen configurations he would\u0027ve sworn were viable - but the Optimen said no. \u0027You do believe me,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But look at the long lives they give us,\u0027 Svengaard said. \u0027I can expect almost two hundred years.\u0027 \u0027Medicine does that, not the Optimen,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Delicate careful refinement of the enzymic prescription\u0027s the key. That plus a proscribed life in which emotional upset is held to a minimum. Selected exercises and a diet chosen for your specific needs. It could be done for almost anyone.\u0027 \u0027Indefinite life?\u0027 Svengaard whispered. \u0027No! But long life, much longer than we get now. I\u0027m going on four hundred years, myself - as are several of my contemporaries. Almost four hundred lovely years,\u0027 he said, remembering Calapine\u0027s vicious phrase... and Nourse\u0027s chuckle. \u0027Four hundred - you?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027I agree it\u0027s nothing compared to their many \u0027thousands,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But almost anyone could have these years, except they don\u0027t permit it.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 Svengaard asked. \u0027This way they can offer the bonus years to the selected few,\u0027 Igan said, \u0027a reward for service. Without this rule they have no coin to buy us. You knew this! You\u0027ve been trying to sell yourself to them for this coin all your life.\u0027 Svengaard looked down at his bound hands. Is that my life? he wondered. Fettered hands? Who will buy my fettered hands? \u0027And you should hear Nourse chuckle at my pitiful four hundred years,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Nourse?\u0027 \u0027Yes! Nourse of the Tuyere, Nourse the Cynic, Nourse of the more than forty thousand years! Why do you think Nourse is a Cynic?\u0027 Igan demanded. \u0027There s older Optimen, much older. Most of those aren\u0027t Cynics.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 Svengaard said. He stared at Igan, feeling weak, battered, unable to counter the force of these words and arguments. \u0027I forget you\u0027re not of Central,\u0027 Igan said. They classify themselves by the tiny bit of emotion they\u0027re permitted. They\u0027re Actionists, Emotionals, Cynics, Hedonists and Effetes. They pass through cynicism on their way to hedonism. The Tuyere already\u0027s well occupied in pursuit of personal pleasure. There\u0027s a pattern here, too, and none of it\u0027s good.\u0027 Igan studied Svengaard, weighing the effect of his words. Here was a creature barely above the Polk. He was medieval man. To him. Central and the Optimen were the \u0027primum mobile\u0027 in control of all celestial systems. Beyond Central lay only the empyrean home of the Creator... and for the Svengaards of the world there was little distinction between Optiman and Creator. Both were higher than the moon and totally without fault. \u0027Where can we run?\u0027 Svengaard asked. There\u0027s no place to hide. They control the enzymic prescriptions. The minute one of us walks into a pharmacy for a renewal, that\u0027s the end.\u0027 \u0027We have our sources,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But why would you want me?\u0027 Svengaard asked. He kept his eyes on his bindings. \u0027Because you\u0027re a unique individual,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Because Potter wants you. Because you know of the Durant embryo.\u0027 The Durant embryo, Svengaard thought. What\u0027s the significance of the Durant embryo? It all comes back to that embryo. He looked up, met Igan\u0027s eyes. \u0027You find it difficult to see the Optimen in my description of them,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Yes.\u0027 They\u0027re a plague on the face of the earth,\u0027 Igan said. They\u0027re the earth\u0027s disease!\u0027 Svengaard recoiled from the bitterness of Igan\u0027s voice. \u0027Saul has erased his thousands and David his ten thousands,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But the Optimen erase the future.\u0027 A blocky hulk of a man squeezed past the narrow space beside the table, planted himself with his back to Svengaard. ~ \u0027Well?\u0027 he asked. The voice carried a disturbing tone of urgency, just in that one word. Svengaard tried to see the face, but couldn\u0027t move far enough to the side. There was just that wide belted back in a gray jacket. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027We can spare no more time,\u0027 the newcomer said. Totter has completed his work.\u0027 The result?\u0027 Igan asked. He says successful. He used enzymic injection for quick recovery. The mother will be ready to move soon.\u0027 A thick hand moved over the shoulder to point a thumb at Svengaard. \u0027What do we do with him?\u0027 \u0027Bring him,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027What\u0027s Central doing?\u0027 \u0027Ordered arrest and confinement of every surgeon.\u0027 \u0027So soon? Did they get Dr Hand?\u0027 \u0027Yes, but he took the black door.\u0027 \u0027Stopped his heart,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027The only thing. We can\u0027t let them question one of us. How many does that leave us?\u0027 \u0027Seven.\u0027 \u0027Including Svengaard?\u0027 \u0027Eight then.\u0027 \u0027Well keep Svengaard restrained for the time being,\u0027 Igan said. They\u0027re beginning to pull their special people out of Seatac,\u0027 the big man said. Svengaard could see only half of Igan\u0027s face past the newcomer, but that half showed a deep frown of concentration. The one visible eye looked at Svengaard, disregarded him. \u0027It\u0027s obvious,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Yes - they\u0027re going to destroy the megalopolis.\u0027 \u0027Not destroy, sterilize.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve heard Allgood speak of the Folk?\u0027 \u0027Many times. Vermin in their warrens. Hell step on the entire region without a qualm. Is everything ready to move?\u0027 \u0027Ready enough.\u0027 The driver?\u0027 \u0027Programed for the desired response.\u0027 \u0027Give Svengaard a shot to keep him quiet, then. We won\u0027t have time for him once we\u0027re on the road.\u0027 Svengaard stiffened. The bulky back turned. Svengaard looked up into a pair of glistening eyes, gray, measuring, devoid of emotion. One of the thick hands lifted, carrying a springshot ampoule. The hand touched his neck and there was a jolt. Svengaard stared up at that faceless face while the fuzzy clouds closed around his mind. His throat felt thick, tongue useless. He willed himself to protest, but no sound came. Awareness became a tightening globe centered on a tiny patch of ceiling with slotted openings. The scene condensed, smaller and smaller - a frantic circle like an eye with slotted pupils. He sank into a cushioned well of darkness. Thirteen LIZBETH lay on a bench with Harvey seated beside her, steadying her. There were five people here in a cubed space no bigger than a large packing box. The box had been fitted into the center of a normal load on an overland transporter van. A single glowtube in the comer above her head illuminated the interior with a sickly yellow light. She could see Doctors Igan and Boumour on a rough bench opposite her, their feet stretched across the bound, gagged and unconscious figure of Svengaard on the floor. It was already night outside, Harvey had said. That must mean they\u0027d come a goodly distance, she thought. She felt vaguely nauseated and her abdomen ached around the stitches. The thought of carrying her son within her carried a strange reassurance. There was a sense of fulfillment in it. Potter had said she could likely do without her regular enzymes while she carried the embryo. He\u0027d obviously been thinking the embryo would be removed into a vat when they reached a safe place. But she knew she\u0027d resist that. She wanted to carry her son full term. No woman had done that for thousands of years, but she wanted it. \u0027We\u0027re picking up speed,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027We must be out of the tubes onto the skyway.\u0027 \u0027Will there be checkpoints?\u0027 Boumour asked. \u0027Bound to be.\u0027 Harvey sensed the accuracy of Igan\u0027s assessment. Speed? Yes - their bodies were compensating for heavier pressure on the turns. Air was coming in a bit faster through the scoop ventilator under Lizbeth\u0027s bench. There was a new hardness to the ground-effect suspension, less bounce. The turbines echoed loudly in the narrow box and he could smell unburned hydrocarbons. Checkpoints? Security would use every means to see that no one escaped Seatac. He wondered then what was about to happen to the megalopolis. The surgeons had spoken of poison gas in the ventilators, sonics. Central had many weapons, they said. Harvey put out an arm to hold Lizbeth as they rounded a sharp comer. He didn\u0027t know how he felt about Lizbeth carrying their son within her. It was odd. Not obscene or disgusting... just odd. An instinctive response had come to focus within him and he looked around for dangers from which he could protect her. But there was only this box filled with the smell of stale sweat and oil. \u0027What\u0027s the cargo around us?\u0027 Boumour asked. \u0027Odds and ends,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Machinery parts, some old art works, inconsequential things. We took anything we could pirate to make a seemingly normal load.\u0027 Inconsequentials, Harvey thought. He found himself fascinated by this revelation. Inconsequentials. They carried parts to things that might never be built. Lizbeth\u0027s hand groped out, found his. \u0027Harvey?\u0027 He bent over her. \u0027Yes, dear?\u0027 \u0027I feel.. so... funny.\u0027 Harvey cast a despairing look at the doctors. \u0027She\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Harvey, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027re not going to get through.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s no way to talk,\u0027 Igan said. She looked up, found the gene surgeon studying her across the narrow space of the box. His eyes were a pair of glittering instruments in a slim, supercilious face. Is he a Cyborg, too? she wondered. The cold way the eyes stared at her broke through her control. \u0027I don\u0027t care about myself!\u0027 she hissed. \u0027But what about my son?\u0027 \u0027Best calm yourself, Madame,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027re not going to make it!\u0027 That\u0027s no way to act,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Our driver is the finest Cyborg available.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll never get us past them,\u0027\u0027 she moaned. \u0027You\u0027d best be quiet,\u0027 Igan said. Harvey at last had an object from which to protect his wife. \u0027Don\u0027t talk to her that way!\u0027 he barked. Igan spoke in a long-suffering tone. \u0027Not you, too, Durant. Keep your voice down. You know as well as I do they\u0027ll have listening stations along the skyway. We shouldn\u0027t be speaking now unless it\u0027s absolutely necessary.\u0027 \u0027Nothing can get past them tonight,\u0027 Lizbeth whispered. \u0027Our driver is little more than a shell of flesh around a reflex computer,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027He\u0027s programed for just this task. He\u0027ll get us through if anyone can.\u0027 \u0027If anyone can,\u0027 she whispered. She began to sob - wracking, convulsive movements that shook her whole body. \u0027See what you\u0027ve done!\u0027 Harvey said. Igan sighed, brought up a hand containing a capsule, extended the capsule to Harvey. \u0027Give her this.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Harvey demanded. \u0027Just a sedative.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want a sedative,\u0027 she sobbed. \u0027It\u0027s for your own good, my dear,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Really, this could dislodge the embryo. You should remain calm and quiet this soon after the operation.\u0027 \u0027She doesn\u0027t want it,\u0027 Harvey said. His eyes glared with anger. \u0027She has to take it,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027Not if she doesn\u0027t want it.\u0027 Igan forced his voice into a reasonable tone. \u0027Durant, I\u0027m only trying to save our lives.
