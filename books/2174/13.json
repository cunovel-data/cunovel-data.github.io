I\u0027m tired of being ordered around!\u0027\n \u0027If I\u0027ve offended you, I\u0027m sorry, Durant,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But I must caution you that your present reaction is conditioned by your gene shaping. You\u0027ve excess male protectiveness. Your wife will be all right. This sedative is harmless. She\u0027s hysterical because she has too much maternal drive. These are flaws in your gene shaping, but you\u0027ll both be all right if you remain calm.\u0027\n \u0027Who says we\u0027re flawed?\u0027 Harvey demanded. \u0027I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re a Sterrie who\u0027s never-\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s quite enough, Durant,\u0027 the other doctor said. It was a rumbling, powerful voice.\n Harvey looked at Boumour, noted the pinched-up elfin face on the big body. The surgeon appeared powerful and dangerous, the face strangely inhuman.\n \u0027We cannot fight among ourselves,\u0027 Boumour rumbled. \u0027We may be getting near the checkpoint. They\u0027re sure to have listening devices.\u0027\n \u0027We aren\u0027t flawed,\u0027 Harvey growled.\n \u0027Perhaps you\u0027re right,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027But you\u0027re both reducing our chances of escape. If one of you breaks up at that checkpoint, that\u0027s the end of us.\u0027 He shifted his hand, extended the capsule to Lizbeth. \u0027Please take this, madam. It contains a tranquilizer. Quite harmless, I assure you.\u0027 Hesitantly, Lizbeth took the capsule. It felt cold and gelatinous against her fingers - repulsive. She wanted to hurl the thing at Igan, but Harvey touched her cheek.\n \u0027Maybe you\u0027d better take it,\u0027 he said. \u0027For the baby.\u0027\n She brought up her hand, popped the capsule against the back of her tongue, gulped it. It must be, all right if Harvey agreed. But she didn\u0027t like the hurt, baffled look in his eyes.\n \u0027Now relax,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027It\u0027s fast acting - three or four minutes and you\u0027ll feel quite calm.\u0027 He sat back, glanced down at Svengaard. The trussed figure still appeared to be unconscious, chest rising and falling in an even rhythm.\n For what felt like a long time now, Svengaard had been increasingly aware of hunger and a swooping, turning motion that rolled his body against a hard surface. There was a sensation of swiftness about the motion. He smelled human perspiration, heard the roar of turbines. The sound was beginning to press on his consciousness. There was light, dim and fuzzy through uncooperative eyelids. He felt a gag biting his lips, bindings on hands and feet.\n Svengaard opened his eyes.\n For a moment, he failed to focus, then he found himself staring up at a low ceiling, a tiny glowtube in the corner with a speaker grill beneath it bulging beside a dull ruby call light. The ceiling seemed too close to him and there was a blurred shadow shape to his right - a leg stretched across him. The single light emitted a yellow glow that almost failed to dispel the darkness.\n The ruby light began winking, red fire flashing on and off, on and off.\n \u0027Checkpoint!\u0027 Igan hissed. \u0027Silence everyone!\u0027\n They sensed the van begin to slow. Its air suspension became softer and softer. The turbines whined downscale. They rocked to a stop and the turbines whispered into standby.\n Svengaard\u0027s gaze darted around the enclosure. A rough bench above him to his right... two figures seated on it. A sharp edge of metal protruded from the bench support beside his cheek. Softly, gently, Svengaard moved his head toward the metal projection, felt it touch flesh through the gag. He gave a gentle push of his head upward and the gag pulled down slightly. The projection scratched his cheek, but he ignored it. Another gentle tug and the gag lowered another fraction of a millimeter. He turned his eyes, checking his surroundings, saw Lizbeth\u0027s face above him to the left, her eyes closed, hands in front of her mouth. There was a sense of suspended terror about her.\n Again, Svengaard moved his head.\n There were voices somewhere in a remote distance - sharp sounds of questions, murmurous answers.\n Lizbeth\u0027s hands lowered to reveal her mouth. The lips moved soundlessly.\n The sound of talking had stopped.\n Slowly the van began to move.\n Svengaard twisted his head. The binding of his gag broke free. He coughed it from his mouth, shouted, \u0027Help! Help! I\u0027m a prisoner! Help!\u0027\n Igan and Boumour leaped with shock. Lizbeth screamed, \u0027No! Oh, no!\u0027\n Harvey surged forward, crashed a fist into Svengaard\u0027s jaw, fell on him with one hand over the man\u0027s mouth. They held their positions in an agony of listening as the van continued to gather speed.\n Igan took a trembling breath, looked across into the wild staring eyes of Lizbeth.\n The voice of their driver came through the speaker grill:\n \u0027What is the trouble? Can\u0027t you observe the simplest precautions?\u0027 The dispassionate, accusing quality of the voice chilled Harvey. He wondered about the driver then, why the creature took this tone rather than telling them if they\u0027d been exposed. Svengaard felt limp and unconscious beneath him, Harvey realized. He experienced a wild desire to throttle the surgeon here and now, could almost feel his hands around the man\u0027s throat.\n \u0027Did they hear us?\u0027 Igan whispered.\n \u0027Apparently not,\u0027 the driver rasped. \u0027No sign of pursuit. I presume you\u0027ll not permit another such lapse. Please report on what happened.\u0027\n \u0027Svengaard wakened from the narcotic sooner than we expected.\u0027\n \u0027But he was gagged.\u0027\n \u0027He... managed to get the gag off somehow.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps you should kill him. Obviously, he will not take reconditioning.\u0027\n Harvey pushed himself off Svengaard. Now that the Cyborg had made the suggestion, he no longer felt like killing Svengaard. Who was it up there in the van\u0027s cab? Harvey wondered. Cyborgs tended to sound alike, that computer personality with its altitude of logic so far above the human. This one, though, came through even more remote than usual.\n \u0027We\u0027ll... consider what to do,\u0027 Igan said.\n \u0027Svengaard is again secure?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s been taken care of.\u0027\n \u0027No thanks to you,\u0027 Harvey said, staring at Igan. \u0027You were right over him.\u0027\n Igan\u0027s face paled. He remembered his frozen immobility after that leap of fear. Anger surged through him. What right had this clod to question a surgeon? He spoke stiffly, \u0027I regret that I\u0027m not a man of violence.\u0027\n \u0027Something you\u0027d better lean,\u0027 Harvey said. He felt Lizbeth\u0027s hand on his shoulder, allowed her to guide him back onto their bench. \u0027If you have more of that knock-out stuff, maybe you\u0027d better use another dose of it on him before he wakes up again.\u0027\n Igan suppressed a sharp reply.\n \u0027In the bag under our bench,\u0027 Boumour said. \u0027A reasonable suggestion.\u0027\n Woodenly, Igan groped for a slapshot and administered it to Svengaard.\n Again, the driver\u0027s voice barked through the speaker: \u0027Attention! We must not presume from the lack of immediate and obvious pursuit that they failed to hear the outcry. I am executing Plan Gamma.\u0027\n \u0027Who is that driver?\u0027 Harvey whispered.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t see which one they programed,\u0027 Boumour said. He studied Harvey. That had been an appropriate question. The driver did sound odd, much more so than the usual Cyborg abnormality. They\u0027d said the driver would be a programed reflex computer, a machine designed to give the surest response to achieve their escape. Who did they choose for that program?\n \u0027What\u0027s Plan Gamma?\u0027 Lizbeth whispered.\n \u0027We\u0027re abandoning the prepared escape route,\u0027 Boumour said. He stared at the forward wall of their box. Abandoning the prepared route... which meant they\u0027d be completely dependent now upon the abilities of the Cyborg driver... and whichever scattered cells of the Underground remained and were available. Any one of those cells could\u0027ve been compromised, of course. Boumour\u0027s usually stolid nature began to entertain odd wisps of fear.\n \u0027Driver!\u0027 Harvey called.\n \u0027Silence,\u0027 the driver snapped. \u0027Stick to the original plan,\u0027 Harvey said. They have the medical facilities there if my wife-\u0027\n \u0027Your wife\u0027s safety is not the overriding factor,\u0027 the driver said. \u0027Elements along the prepared route must not be discovered. Do not distract me with your objections. Plan Gamma is being executed.\u0027\n \u0027Easy does it,\u0027 Boumour said as Harvey surged forward supporting himself with a hand on the bench. \u0027What can you do, Durant?\u0027\n Harvey sagged back onto the bench, groped for and found Lizbeth\u0027s hand. She squeezed it, signaled, \u0027Wait. Don\u0027t you read the doctors? They\u0027re frightened too... and worried.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m worried about you,\u0027 Harvey signaled.\n So her safety - and presumably ours - aren\u0027t the overriding concern, Boumour thought. What then is the overriding concern? What program controls our computer-in-flesh?\u0027 Fourteen\n ONLY Nourse of the Tuyere occupied a throne in the Survey Globe, his attention on the rays, the winking lights and gauges, the cascading luminescences that reported affairs of the Folk. A telltale told him it was night outside in this hemisphere - darkness that spread across the land from Seatac to the megalopolis of N\u0027Scotia. He saw the physical darkness as a sign of frightening events to come and wished Schruille and Calapine would return.\n The visual-report screen came alight. Nourse turned to face it as Allgood\u0027s features appeared there. The security boss bowed to Nourse.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Nourse asked.\n \u0027Seatac Checkpoint East reports a van with an odd load of containers has just gone through, Nourse. Its turbines carried masking mutes which we deciphered. The mutes concealed sounds of breathing - five persons hidden in the load. Voices cried out from within as the van pulled away. Acting on your instructions, we put a drop marker onto the van and now have it under observation. What are your orders?\u0027\n It begins, Nourse thought. While I\u0027m alone here it begins.\n Nourse looked to the instruments covering the checkpoints. Seatac East. The van was a moving green pinpoint on a screen. He read the banked binaries describing the incident, compared them with a total-plan motivational analysis. The probability analogues he derived filled him with a sense of doom.\n \u0027The voices have been identified, Nourse,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027The voice prints were-\u0027\n \u0027Svengaard and Lizbeth Durant,\u0027 Nourse said.\n \u0027Where she is, her husband cannot be far away,\u0027 Allgood said.\n Allgood\u0027s logical little announcements began to annoy Nourse. He contained the emotion while noting the man had overlooked the use of the Optiman\u0027s name-in-address. It was a small sign, but significant, especially when Allgood appeared not to notice his own lapse.\n \u0027Which leave us two unidentified,\u0027 Nourse said.\n \u0027We can make an educated guess... Nourse.\u0027\n Nourse glanced at his probability analogues, said. Two of our wayward pharmacists.\u0027\n \u0027One may be Potter, Nourse.\u0027\n Nourse shook his head. \u0027Potter remains in Seatac.\u0027\n \u0027They may have a portable vat, Nourse, and that embryo with them,\u0027 Allgood said, \u0027but we failed to detect appropriate machinery.\u0027\n \u0027You would not hear the machinery being used,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027Or, hearing it, you would not identify it.\u0027\n Nourse looked up to the banks of scanners - every one of them alive - showing the Optimen observing their Survey Globe. Night or day, the watching channels were jammed. They know what I mean, he thought. Are they disgusted, or is this just another interesting aspect of violence?\n As could have been predicted, Allgood said, \u0027I fail to understand Nourse\u0027s meaning.\u0027\n \u0027No need,\u0027 Nourse said. He looked at the face in the screen. So young it appeared, but Nourse had begun to notice a thing:\n There was much youngness in Central, but no youth. Even the Sterrie servants betrayed this fact to the unveiled eye. He felt himself to be like the Sterrie Folk suddenly, watching each other for evidence of aging, hoping by comparison that their own appearance prospered. \u0027What are Nourse\u0027s instructions?\u0027 Allgood asked. \u0027Svengaard\u0027s outcry indicates he\u0027s a prisoner,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027But we must not overlook the possibility this is an elaborate ruse.\u0027 He spoke in a resigned, tired voice. \u0027Shall we destroy the van, Nourse?\u0027\n \u0027Destroy...\u0027 Nourse shuddered. \u0027No, not yet. Keep it under\u0027 surveillance. Put out a general alert. We must discover where they\u0027re headed. Every contact they make must be noted and| marked down for attention.\u0027\n \u0027If they elude us, Nourse, it could-\n \u0027You\u0027ve flagtapped the appropriate enzyme prescriptions?\n \u0027Yes, Nourse.\u0027\n \u0027Then they cannot run far... or long.\u0027\n \u0027As you say, Nourse.\u0027\n \u0027You may go,\u0027 Nourse said.\n He watched the screen long after it had turned blank. Destroy the van? That would be an ending. He felt then that he did not want this game to end - ever. A curious feeling of elation crept through him.\n The globe\u0027s entrance segment swung open below him. Calapine entered followed by Schruille. They rode the climbing beams to their seats on the triangular dais. Neither spoke. They appeared withdrawn, oddly calm. Nourse thought of a controlled storm as he looked at them - the lightning and the thunder contained, that it might not harm their fellows.\n \u0027Is it not time?\u0027 Calapine asked.\n A sigh escaped Nourse.\n Schruille activated the sensor contact with the scanners in the mountains. There was moonlight suddenly in the receiving screens, the sounds of nightbirds, a rustling of dry leaves. Far off across moon-frosted hills lay lines and patches of lights tracing the coast and harbors of the megalopolis and the multilevel skyway networks.\n Calapine stared at the scene, thinking of jewels and casual baubles, the playthings of idleness. She\u0027d not had the inclination in several centuries to indulge in such toys. Why should I think of them now? she wondered. These are not toys, these lights.\n Nourse examined the binary pyramids, the action analogues showing the course of Folk activity within the megalopolis.\n \u0027All is normal... and in readiness,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Normal!\u0027 Schruille said.\n \u0027Which of us?\u0027 Calapine whispered.\n T have seen the necessity longest,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027I will do it.\u0027 He rolled a looping ring in the arm of his throne and as he moved it was appalled by the simplicity of the action. This ring and the powers it controlled had been at hand for eons, an insensitive linkage of machinery. All it took was a simple turning motion, a hand and the will behind the hand.\n Calapine watched the scene in her screens - moonlight on hills, the megalopolis beyond, an animated toy subject to her whims. The last cadre of special personnel had departed she knew. Irreplaceable objects that might be damaged had been removed. All was ready and doomed.\n Winking flares began to appear through the necklaces of light - golden yellow flares. The Tuyere\u0027s screens blurred as sonics vibrated the distant scanners. Lights began going out. Across the entire region, the lights went out - in groups and one by one. A low green fog rolled across the scene, filling in the valleys, overrunning the hills.\n Presently, no lights were visible. Only the green fog remained. It continued to creep out beneath the impersonal moon, moving out and across and through until it remained and nothing more. Schruille watched the stacked numerical analogues, the unemotional reporters which merely counted, submitted deductions of sortings, remainders... zeroes. Nothing showed Folk dying in the tubes and warrens, in the streets... at their labors... at their play.\n Nourse sat weeping. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-13.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: \n A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
