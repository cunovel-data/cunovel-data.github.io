{"id":99297,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Through their hands, Harvey signaled, \u0027Boumour and Igan, I read them now. They\u0027re new Cyborgs. Probably just a first linkage -with implanted computers. They\u0027re just learning the price, shedding their normal human emotional reactions, learning to counterfeit emotion.\u0027 She absorbed this seeing them through Harvey\u0027s deduction. He often read people better than she did. She re-read what she had seen of the two surgeons. \u0027Do you read it?\u0027 he signaled. \u0027You\u0027re right. Yes.\u0027 \u0027It means a total break with Central. They can never go back: \u0027That explains Seatac,\u0027 she signaled. She began to tremble. \u0027And we can\u0027t trust them.\u0027 Harvey said. He pressed her close, soothing her. The van labored up through the foothills skirting open meadows, following ancient tracks, an occasional stream-bed. Shortly before dawn, it swerved left down a firebreak and into a stand of pines and cedars, squeezed its way through a narrow lane there with its blowers kicking up a heavy cloud of forest duff behind. Glisson pulled to a stop behind an old building, moss on its sides, small curtained windows. Pseudo-ducks with a weed patina and grass-grown signs that they hadn\u0027t been animated in years, made a short file near the building - pale moon-figures in the light of a single bulb high up under the building\u0027s eaves. Turbines whined to silence. They could hear then the hum of machinery and looking toward the sound saw the dull silver outlines of a ventilator tower among the trees. A door at the corner of the building opened. A heavy-headed man with a big jaw, stoop- shouldered, emerged blowing his nose in a red handkerchief. He looked old, his face a mask of subservience. Glisson said, \u0027It\u0027s the sign. All is safe here... for the moment.\u0027 He slipped out, approached the old man, coughed. \u0027A lot of sickness around these days,\u0027 the old man said. His voice was as ancient as his face, wheezing, slurring the consonants. \u0027You\u0027re not the only one with troubles,\u0027 Glisson said. The old man straightened, shed the stooped look and subservient manner. \u0027S\u0027pose you\u0027re wanting a hidey hole,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t know if it\u0027s safe here. Don\u0027t even know if I oughta hide you.\u0027 \u0027I will give the orders here,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You will obey.\u0027 The old man studied Glisson a moment, then a look of anger washed over his face. \u0027You damn\u0027 Cyborgs!\u0027 he said. \u0027Hold your tongue,\u0027 Glisson said, his voice flat. \u0027We need food, a safe place to spend the day. I shall require your help in hiding this van. You must know the surrounding terrain. And you will arrange other transportation for us.\u0027 \u0027Best cut it up and bury it,\u0027 the old man said, his voice surly. \u0027Been a hornet\u0027s nest stirred up. Guess you know that.\u0027 \u0027We know,\u0027 Glisson said. He turned, beckoned to the van. \u0027Come along. Bring Svengaard.\u0027 Presently, the others joined him. Boumour and Igan supported Svengaard between them. The bindings on Svengaard\u0027s feet had been released, but he appeared barely able to stand. Lizbeth walked with the bent-over care that said she wasn\u0027t sure her incision had healed despite the enzymic speed-up medication. \u0027We will lodge here during daylight,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027This man will direct you to quarters.\u0027 \u0027What word from Seatac?\u0027 Igan asked. Glisson looked at the old man, said, \u0027Answer.\u0027 The oldster shrugged. \u0027Courier through here couple of hours ago. Said no survivors.\u0027 \u0027Any report on a Dr Potter?\u0027 Svengaard croaked. Glisson whirled, stared at Svengaard. \u0027Dunno,\u0027 the old man said. \u0027What route he take?\u0027 Igan cleared his throat, glanced at Glisson, then at the old man. \u0027Potter? I believe he was in the group coming out by the power tubes.\u0027 The old man flicked a glance at the ventilator tower growing more distinct among the trees by the second as daylight crept across the mountains. \u0027Nobody come through the tubes,\u0027 he said. \u0027They shut off the ventilators and flooded the tubes with that gas first thing.\u0027 He looked at Igan. \u0027Ventilators been going again for about three hours.\u0027 Glisson studied Svengaard, asked. \u0027Why are you interested in Potter?\u0027 Svengaard remained silent. \u0027Answer me!\u0027 Glisson ordered. Svengaard tried to swallow. His throat ached. He felt driven into a comer. Glisson\u0027s words enraged him. Without warning, Svengaard lurched forward dragging Igan and Boumour, lashed out at Glisson, with a foot. The Cyborg dodged with a blurring movement, caught the foot, jerked Svengaard from the two surgeons, whirled, swung Svengaard wide and released him. Svengaard landed on his back, skidded across the ground, stopped. Before he could move, Glisson was standing over him. Svengaard lay there sobbing. \u0027Why are you interested in Potter?\u0027 Glisson demanded. \u0027Go away, go away, go away!\u0027 Svengaard sobbed. Glisson straightened, looked around at Igan and Boumour. \u0027You understand this?\u0027 Igan shrugged. \u0027It\u0027s emotion.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps a shock reaction,\u0027 Boumour said. Through their hands, Harvey signaled Lizbeth, \u0027He\u0027s been in shock, but this means he\u0027s coming out of it. These are medical people! Can\u0027t they read anything?\u0027 \u0027Glisson reads it.\u0027 she answered. \u0027He was testing them.\u0027 Glisson turned around, looked squarely at Harvey. The bold understanding in the Cyborg\u0027s eyes shot a pang of fear through Harvey. \u0027Careful,\u0027 Lizbeth signaled. \u0027He\u0027s suspicious of us.\u0027 \u0027Take Svengaard inside,\u0027 Glisson said. Svengaard looked up at their driver. Glisson, the Durants called him. But the old man from the building had labeled Glisson a Cyborg. Was it possible? Were the halfmen being revived to challenge the Optimen once more? Was that the reason for Seatac\u0027s death? Boumour and Igan lifted him, checked the fetters on his hands. \u0027Let\u0027s have no more foolishness,\u0027 Boumour said. Are they like Glisson? Svengaard asked himself. Are they, too, part man, part machine? And what about the Durants? Svengaard could feel the tear dampness in his eyes. Hysteria, he thought. Coming out of shock. He began to wonder at himself then with an odd feeling of guilt. Why does Potter\u0027s death strike me more deeply than the death of an entire Megalopolis, the extinction of my wife and friends? What did Potter symbolize to me? Boumour and Igan half carried, half walked him into the building, down a narrow hall and into a poorly lighted, gloomy big room with a ceiling that went up to bare beams two stories above. They dropped him onto a dusty couch - bare plastic and hydraulic contour-shapers that adjusted reluctantly. The light came from two glowglobes high up under the beams. It exposed oddments of furniture scattered around the room and mounds of strange shapes covered by slick, glistening fabric. A table to his left, he realized, was made of planks. Wood! A contour cot lay beyond it, and an ancient roll-top desk with a missing drawer, and mismatched chairs. A stained, soot-blackened fireplace, with an iron crane reaching across its mouth like a gibbet, occupied half the wall across from him. The entire room smelled of dampness and rot. The floor creaked as people moved. Wood flooring! Svengaard looked up at tiny windows admitting a sparse gray daylight that grew brighter by the second. Even at its brightest he knew it wouldn\u0027t dispel the gloom of this place. Here was sadness that made him think of people without number - dead, forgotten. Tears rolled down his cheeks. What\u0027s wrong with me? he wondered. There came a sound from the yard of the van\u0027s turbines being ignited. He heard it lift, leave... fade away. Harvey and Lizbeth entered the room. Lizbeth looked at Svengaard, then at Boumour and Igan who had taken up vigil on the cot. With her crouched, protective walk, she crossed to Svengaard, touched his shoulder. She saw his tears, evidence of humanity, and she wished then that he were her doctor. Perhaps there was a way. She decided to ask Harvey. \u0027Please trust us,\u0027 she said, \u0027We won\u0027t harm you. They are the ones who killed your wife and friends, not us.\u0027 Svengaard pulled away. How dare she have pity on me? he thought. But she had reached some chord in him. He could feel himself shattering. Oppressive silence settled over the room. Harvey came up, guided his wife to a chair at the table. \u0027It\u0027s wood,\u0027 she said, touching the surface, wonder in her voice. Then, \u0027Harvey, I\u0027m very hungry.\u0027 They\u0027ll bring food as soon as they\u0027ve disposed of the van,\u0027 he said. She clutched his hand and Svengaard watched, fascinated by the nervous movement of her fingers. Glisson and the old man returned presently, slamming the door behind them. The building creaked with their movement. \u0027We\u0027ll have a forest patrol vehicle for the next stage,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Much safer. There\u0027s a thing you all should know now.\u0027 The Cyborg moved a cold, weighted stare from face to face. \u0027There was a marker on top of the van\u0027s load section which we abandoned last night.\u0027 \u0027Marker?\u0027 Lizbeth said. \u0027A device for tracing us, following us,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Ohhh!\u0027 Lizbeth put a hand over her mouth. \u0027I do not know how closely they were following,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027I was altered for this task and certain of my devices were left behind. They may know where we are right now.\u0027 Harvey shook his head. \u0027But why... ?\u0027 \u0027Why haven\u0027t they moved against us?\u0027 Glisson asked. \u0027It\u0027s obvious. They hope we\u0027ll lead them to the vitals of our organization.\u0027 Something like rage came into the Cyborg\u0027s features. \u0027It may be we can surprise them.\u0027 Sixteen IN the Survey Room, the great globe\u0027s instrumental inner walls lay relatively quiescent. Calapine and Schruille of the Tuyere occupied the triple thrones. The dais turned slowly, allowing them to scan the entire surface. Kaleidoscopic colors from the instruments played a somnolent visible melody across Cala-pine\u0027s features - a wash of greens, reds, purples. She felt tired with a definite emotion of self-pity. There was something wrong with the enzymic analyzers. She felt sure of it, wondering if the Underground had somehow compromised the function of the pharmacy computers. Sehruille was no help. He\u0027d laughed at the suggestion. Allgood\u0027s features appeared on a cell screen before Calapine. She stopped the turning dais as he bowed, said, \u0027I call to report, Calapine.\u0027 She noted the dark circles under his eyes, the drugged awareness in the way he held his head stiffly erect. \u0027You have found them?\u0027 Calapine asked. They\u0027re somewhere in the wilderness area, Calapine,\u0027 All-good said. They have to be in there.\u0027 \u0027Have to be!\u0027 she sneered. \u0027You\u0027re a foolish optimist, Max.\u0027 \u0027We know some of the hiding places they could\u0027ve chosen, Calapine.\u0027 \u0027For every one you know, they\u0027ve nine you don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said. \u0027I have the entire area ringed, Calapine. We\u0027re moving in slowly, cheeking everywhere as we go. They\u0027re there and we\u0027ll find them.\u0027 \u0027He babbles,\u0027 she said, glancing at Schruille. Schruille returned a mirthless smile, looked at Allgood through the prismatic reflector. \u0027Max, you have found the source of the substitute embryo?\u0027 \u0027Not yet, Schruille.\u0027 He stared up at them, his face betraying his obvious confusion at the militancy and violence of his Optimen. \u0027Do you seek in Seatac?\u0027 Calapine demanded. Allgood wet his lips with his tongue. \u0027Out with it!\u0027 she snapped. Ahhh, the fear in his eyes. \u0027We\u0027re searching there, Calapine, but the-\u0027 \u0027You think we were too precipitate?\u0027 she asked. He shook his head. \u0027You\u0027re acting strangely,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Are you afraid of us?\u0027 He hesitated, then, \u0027Yes, Schruille.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Schruille!\u0027 Calapine mimicked. Allgood looked at her, the fear in his eyes tempered by anger. \u0027I\u0027m taking every action I know, Calapine.\u0027 She marked a sudden precision in his manner behind the anger. Her eyes went wide with wonder. Was it possible? She looked at Schruille, wondering if he had seen it. \u0027Max, why did you call us?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027I... to report, Schruille.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve reported nothing.\u0027 Hesitantly, Calapine brought up her instruments for a special probe of Allgood, stared at the result. Horror mingled with rage in her. Cyborg! They had defiled Max! Her Max! There\u0027s only need for you to obey us,\u0027 Schruille said. Allgood nodded, remained silent. \u0027You!\u0027 Calapine hissed. She leaned toward the screen. \u0027You dared! Why? Why, Max?\u0027 Schruille said, \u0027What... ?\u0027 But in the shocked instant of her questions, Allgood had seen that he was discovered. He knew it was his end. could see it in her eyes. \u0027I saw... I found the doppelgangers,\u0027 he stammered. An angry twist of her hand rolled one of the rings on her throne arm. Sonies sent a shock wave chattering across Allgood, blurred his image. His lips moved soundlessly, eyes staring. He collapsed. \u0027Why did you do that?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027He was Cyborg I\u0027 she grated, and pointed to the evidence of the instruments. \u0027Max? Our Max?\u0027 He looked at the instruments, nodded. \u0027My Max,\u0027 she said. \u0027But he worshipped you, loved you.\u0027 \u0027He does nothing now,\u0027 she whispered. She blanked the screen, continued to stare at it. Already, the incident was receding from her mind. \u0027Do you enjoy direct action?\u0027 Schruille asked.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-15.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
