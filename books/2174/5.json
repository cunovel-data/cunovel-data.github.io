{"id":99287,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I can read people! It was a staggering realization. He looked around the room at the nurses helping with the tie-off. When his eyes found the computer nurse, he knew she had deliberately destroyed the record tape. He knew it. Four LIZBETH and Harvey Durant walked hand in hand from the hospital after their interview with the Doctors Potter and Svengaard. They smiled and swung their clasped hands like children off on a picnic - which in a sense they were. The morning\u0027s rain had been shut off and the clouds were being packed off to the east, toward the tall peaks that looked down on Seatac Megalopolis. The overhead sky showed a clear cerulean blue with a goblin sun riding high in it. A mob of people in loose marching order was coming through the park across the way, obviously the exercise period for some factory team or labor group. Their uniformed sameness was broken by flashes of color - an orange scarf on a woman\u0027s head, a yellow sash across a man\u0027s chest, the scarlet of a fertility fetish dangling on a gold loop from a woman\u0027s ear. One man had equipped himself bright green shoes. The pathetic attempts at individuality in a world of gene-stamped sameness stabbed through Lizbeth\u0027s defenses. She turned away lest the scene tear the smile from her lips, asked, \u0027Where\u0027ll we go?\u0027 \u0027Hmmm?\u0027 Harvey held her back, waiting on the walk for the group to pass. Among the marchers, faces turned to stare enviously at Harvey and Lizbeth. All knew why the Durants were here. The hospital, a great pile of plasmeld behind them, the fact that they were man and woman together, the casual dress, the smiles - all said the Durants were on breeder-leave from their appointed labors. Each individual in that mob hoped with a lost desperation for this same escape from the routine that bound them all. Viable gametes, breeder leave - it was the universal dream. Even the known Sterries hoped and patronized the breeder quacks and the manufacturers of doombah fetishes. They have no pasts, Lizbeth thought, focusing abruptly on the common observation of the Folk philosophers. They\u0027re all people without pasts and only the hope for a future to Cling to. Somewhere our past was lost in an ocean of darkness. The Optimen and their gene surgeons have extinguished our past. Even their own breeder-leave lost its special glow in the face of this. The Durants might not be constrained to leap up at the rising bell and hurry apart to their labors, but they were still people without a past... and their future might be lost in an instant. The child being formed in the hospital vat... in some small way it might still be part of them, but the surgeons had changed it. They had cut it off sharply from its past. Lizbeth recalled her own parents, the feeling of estrangement from them, of differences which went deeper than blood. They were only partly my parents, she thought. They knew it... and I knew it. She felt the beginnings of estrangement from her own unformed son then, an emotion that colored present necessities. What\u0027s the use? she wondered. But she knew what the use was - to end forever all this amputation of pasts. The last envious face passed. The mob became moving backs, bits of color. They turned a corner and were gone, cut off. Is it a corner we\u0027ve turned and no coming back? Lizbeth wondered. \u0027Let\u0027s walk to the cross-town shuttle tube,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027Through the park?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027Just think - ten months.\u0027 \u0027And we can take our son home,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027re very lucky.\u0027 \u0027It seems like a long time - ten months,\u0027 Harvey said. Lizbeth answered as they crossed the street and entered the park. \u0027Yes, but we can come see him every week when they shift him to the big vat - and that\u0027s only three months away.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027It\u0027ll be over before we know it. And thank the powers he\u0027s not a specialist or anything else. We can raise him at home. Our work time\u0027ll be reduced.\u0027 \u0027That Doctor Potter\u0027s wonderful,\u0027 she said. As they talked, their clasped hands moved with the subtle pressures and finger shifts of the secret conversation - the No-Spoken-Word hand code that classified them as couriers of the Parents Underground. \u0027They\u0027re still watching us,\u0027 Harvey signaled. \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027Svengaard is out - a slave of the power structure.\u0027 \u0027Obviously. You know, I had no idea the computer nurse was one of us.\u0027 \u0027You saw that, too?\u0027 \u0027Potter was looking at her when she tripped the switch,\u0027 \u0027Do you think the Security people saw her? \u0027Not a chance. They were all concentrated on us.\u0027 \u0027Maybe she\u0027s not one of us,\u0027 Harvey signaled. And he spoke aloud, \u0027Isn\u0027t it a beautiful day. Let\u0027s take the floral path.\u0027 Lizbeth\u0027s finger pressures answered. \u0027You think that nurse is an accidental?\u0027 \u0027Could be. Perhaps she saw what Potter\u0027d accomplished and knew there was only one way to save the embryo.\u0027 \u0027Someone will have to contact her immediately then.\u0027 \u0027Cautiously. She might be unstable, emotional - a breeder neurotic.\u0027 \u0027What about Potter?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll have to get people to him right away. We\u0027ll need his help getting the embryo out of there.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027ll give us nine of Central\u0027s surgeons,\u0027 she said. \u0027If he goes along,\u0027 Harvey signaled. She looked at him with a smile that completely masked her sudden worry. \u0027You have doubts?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s only that I think he was reading me at the same time I read him.\u0027 \u0027Oh, he was,\u0027 she said. \u0027But he was slow and lame about it compared to us.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s how I read him. He was like a first reader, an amateur stumbling along, gaining confidence as he went.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s untrained,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s obvious. I was worried. you\u0027d read something in him that escaped me.\u0027 \u0027I guess you\u0027re right.\u0027 Across the park, dust had shattered the sunlight into countless pillars that stood up through an arboretum. Lizbeth stared at the scene as she answered, Wo doubt of it, darling. He\u0027s a natural, someone who\u0027s stumbled onto the talent accidentally. They do occur, you know - have to. Nothing can keep us from communicating.\u0027 \u0027But they certainly try.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 she signaled. \u0027They were very intent on it there today, probing and scanning us in that lounge. But people who think mechanically will never guess - I mean that our weapons are people and not things.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s their fatal blind spot,\u0027 he agreed. \u0027Central\u0027s carved out the genetic ruts with logic - and logic keeps digging the ruts deeper and deeper. They\u0027re so deep now they can\u0027t see over the edges to the outside.\u0027 \u0027And that wide, wide universe out there calling to us,\u0027 she signaled. Five MAX ALLGOOD, Central\u0027s chief of Tachy-Security, climbed Administration\u0027s plasmeld steps slightly ahead of his two surgeon companions as befitted the director of the Optimen\u0027s swift and terrible hand of power. The morning sun behind the trio sent their shadows darting across the white building\u0027s angles and planes. They were admitted to the silver shadows of the entrance portico where a barrier dropped for the inevitable delay. Quarantine scanners searched and probed them for inimical microbes. Allgood turned with the patience of long experience in this procedure, studied his companions - Boumour and Igan. It amused him that they must drop their titles here. No doctors were admitted to these precints. Here they must be pharmacists. The title \u0027doctor\u0027 carried overtones which spread unrest among the Optimen. They knew about doctors, but only as ministers to the mere humans. A doctor became a euphemism in here, just as no one said death or kill or implied that a machine or structure would wear out. Only new Optimen in their acolyte apprenticeship, or meres of young appearance served in Central, although some of the meres had been preserved by their masters for remarkable lengths of time. Boumour and Igan both passed the test of youthfulness, although Boumour\u0027s face was of that pinched-up elfin type which tended to suggest age before its time. He was a big man with heavy shoulders, powerful. Igan looked lean and fragile beside him, a beaked face with long jaw and tight little mouth. The eyes of both men were Optimen color - blue and penetrating. They were probably near-Opts, both of them. Most Central surgeon- pharmacists were. The pair moved restlessly under Allgood\u0027s gaze, avoiding his eyes. Boumour began talking in a low voice to Igan with one hand on the man\u0027s shoulder moving nervously, kneading. The movement of Boumour\u0027s hand on Igan\u0027s shoulder carried an odd familiarity, a suggestion to Allgood that he had seen something like this somewhere before. He couldn\u0027t place where. The quarantine probing-scanning continued. It seemed to Allgood that it was lasting longer than usual. He turned his attention to the scene across from the building. It was strangely peaceful, at odds with the mood of Central as Allgood knew it. Allgood realized that his access to secret records and even to old books gave him an uncommon knowledge about Central. The Optiman demesne reached across leagues of what had once been the political entities of Canada and northern United States. It occupied a rough circle some seven hundred kilometers in diameter and with two hundred levels below ground. It was a region of multitudinous controls - weather control, gene control, bacterial control, enzyme control... human control... In this little comer, the heart of Administration, the ground had been shaped into an Italian chiaroscuro landscape - blacks and grays with touches of pastels. The Optimen were people who could barber a mountain at a whim: \u0027A little off the top and leave the sideburns.\u0027 Throughout Central, nature had been smoothed over, robbed of her dangerous sharpness. Even when the Optimen staged some natural display, it lacked an element of drama which was a general lack in their lives. Allgood often wondered at this. He had seen pre-Optiman films and recognized the differences. Central\u0027s manicured niceties seemed to him all tied up with the omnipresent red triangles indicating pharmacy outlets where the Optimen might check their enzyme prescriptions. \u0027Are they taking a long time about it or it is just me?\u0027 Boumour asked. His voice carrying a rumbling quality. \u0027Patience,\u0027 Igan said. A mellow tenor there. \u0027Yes,\u0027 Allgood said. \u0027Patience is a man\u0027s best ally.\u0027 Boumour looked up at the Security chief, studying, wondering. Allgood seldom spoke except for effect. He, not the Optimen, was the Conspiracy\u0027s greatest threat. He was body and soul with his masters, a super puppet. Why did he order us to accompany him today? Boumour wondered. Does he know? Will he denounce us? There was a special ugliness about Allgood that fascinated Boumour. The Security chief was a stocky little Folk mere with moon face and darting almond eyes, a dark bush of hair low on his forehead - a Shang-cut by the look of his oven gene markers. Allgood turned towards the quarantine barrier and with a sudden feeling of awakening, Boumour realized the man\u0027s ugliness came from within. It was the ugliness of fear, of created fear and personal fear. The realization gave Boumour an abrupt sensation of relief which he signaled to Igan through finger pressures on the man\u0027s shoulder. Igan pulled away suddenly to stare out across from the building where they stood. Of course Max Allgood fears, he thought. He lives in a mire of fears, named and nameless... just as the Optimen do... poor creatures. The scene across from Central began to impress itself on Igan\u0027s senses. Here, at this moment, it was a day of absolute Spring, planned that way in the lordly heart of Weather Control. Administration\u0027s steps looked down on a lake, round and perfect like an enameled blue plate. On a low hill beyond the lake, plasmeld plinths stood out like white stones: elevator caps reaching down into the locked fastness of the Optimen quarters below - two hundred levels. Far beyond the hill, the sky began to turn dark blue and oily. It was streaked suddenly with red, green and purple fires in a rather flat pattern. Presently, there came a low clap of contained thunder. Across the reaches of Central, some Upper Optiman was staging a tame storm for entertainment. It struck Igan as a pointless display, lacking danger or drama... which ha decided were two words for the same thing. The storm was the first thing Allgood had seen this day to fit his interpretation of Central\u0027s inner rhythms. Things of an ominous nature set the pattern for his view of Central. People vanished into here never to be seen again and only he, Allgood, the chief of Tachy- Security, or a few trusted agents knew their fate. Allgood felt the thunderclap keyed to his mood, a sound that portended absolute power. Under the storm sky now turning acid yellow and dispersing the air of spring, the plinths on the hill above the lake became pagan cenotaphs set out against a ground as purple-green as chamomile. \u0027It\u0027s time,\u0027 Boumour said. Allgood turned to find the quarantine barrier lifted. He led the way into the Hall of Counsel with its shimmering adamantine walls above ranks of empty plasmeld benches. The trio moved through tongues of perfumed vapor that swayed aside as they breasted them. Optiman acolytes wearing green capes fastened at the shoulders with diamond lanulas came from side shadows to pace them. Worked into the green of their robes were shepherd\u0027s pipes of platinum and they swung golden thuribles that wafted clouds of antiseptic pink smoke into the air. Allgood kept his attention on the end of the hall. A giant globe as red as a mandrake stem hung in walking beams there. It was some forty meters in diameter with a section folded back like a segment cut from an orange to reveal the interior. This was the Tuyere\u0027s control center, the tool of strange powers and senses with which they watched and ruled their minions. Lights flashed in there, phosphor greens and the blue cracklings of arcs. Great round gauges spelled out messages and red lights winked response. Numbers flowed on beams through the air and esoteric symbols danced on ribbons of light. Up through the middle, like the core of the fruit, stretched a white column supporting a triangular platform at the globe\u0027s center. At the points of the triangle, each on a golden plasmeld throne, sat the Optimen trio known as the Tuyere - friends, companions, elected rulers for this century and with seventyeight years yet to serve. It was a wink of time in their lives, an annoyance, often disquieting because they must face realities which all other Optimen could treat as euphemisms. The acolytes stopped some twenty paces from the red globe, but continued swinging their thuribles. Allgood moved one pace ahead, motioned Boumour and Igan to halt behind him. The Security chief felt he knew just how far he could go here, that he must go to the limits. They need me, he told himself. But he held no illusions about the dangers in this interview. Allgood looked up into the globe. A dancing lacery of power placed a deceptive transparency over the interior. Through that curtain could be seen shapes, outlines - now clear, now enfolded. \u0027I came,\u0027 Allgood said. Boumour and Igan echoed the greeting, reminding themselves of all the protocol and forms which must be observed here: \u0027Always use the name of the Optiman you address. If you do not know the name, ask it humbly.\u0027 Allgood waited for the Tuyere to answer. Sometimes he felt they had no sense of time, at least of seconds and minutes and perhaps not even of days. It might be true. People of infinite lives might notice the passing seasons as clock ticks. The throne support turned, presenting the Tuyere one by one. They sat in clinging translucent robes, almost nude, flaunting their similarity to the meres. Facing the open segment now was Nourse, a Greek god figure with blocky face, heavy brows, a chest ridged by muscles that rippled as he breathed. How evenly he breathed, with what controlled slowness. The base turned, presented Schruille, the bone slender, unpredictable one with great round eyes, high cheeks and a flat nose above a mouth which seemed always pulled into a thin line of disapproval. Here was a dangerous one. Some said he spoke of things which other Optimen could not. In Allgood\u0027s presence, Schruille had once said \u0027death\u0027, although referring to a butterfly. Again, the base turned - and here was Calapine, her robe girdled with crystal plastrons. She was a thin, high-breasted woman with golden brown hair and chill, insolent eyes, full lips and a long nose above a pointed chin. Allgood had caught her watching him strangely on occasion. At such times he tried not to think about the Optimen who took mere playmates. Nourse spoke to Calapine, looking at her through the prismatic reflector which each throne raised at a shoulder. She answered, but the voices did not carry to the floor of the hall. Allgood watched the interplay for a clue to their mood. It was known among the Folk that Nourse and Calapine had been bedmates for periods that spanned hundreds of mere lifetimes. Nourse had a reputation of strength and predictability, but Calapine was known as a wild one. Mention her name and likely someone would look up and ask, \u0027What\u0027s she done now?\u0027 It was always said with a touch of admiration and fear. All-good knew that fear. He had worked for other ruling trios, but none who had his measure as did these three... especially Calapine. The throne base stopped with Nourse facing the open segment. \u0027You came,\u0027 he rumbled. \u0027Of course you came. The ox knows its owner and the ass its master\u0027s crib.\u0027 So it\u0027s going to be one of those days, Allgood thought. Ridicule! It could only mean they knew how he had stumbled... but didn\u0027t they always? Calapine swiveled her throne to look down at the meres. The Hall of Counsel had been patterned on the Roman Senate with false columns around the edges, banks of benches beneath glittering scanner eyes. Everything focused down onto the figures standing apart from the acolytes. Looking up, Igan reminded himself he had feared and hated these creatures all his life - even while he pitied them. How lucky he\u0027d been to miss the Optiman cut. It\u0027d been close, but he\u0027d been saved. He could remember the hate of his childhood, before it had become tempered by pity. It\u0027d been a clean thing then, sharp and real, blazing against the Givers of Time. \u0027We came as requested to report on the Durants,\u0027 Allgood said. He took two deep breaths to calm his nerves. These sessions were always dangerous, but doubly so since he\u0027d decided on a double game. There was no turning back, though, and no wish to since he\u0027d discovered the doppelgangers of himself they were growing. There could be only one reason they\u0027d duplicate him. Well, they\u0027d learn. Calapine studied Allgood, wondering if it might be time to seek diversion with the ugly Polk male. Perhaps here was an answer to boredom. Both Schruille and Nourse indulged. She seemed to recall having done that before with another Max, but couldn\u0027t remember if it had helped her boredom. \u0027Say what it is we give you, little Max,\u0027 she said. Her woman\u0027s voice, soft and with laughter behind it, terrified him. Allgood swallowed. \u0027You give life, Calapine.\u0027 \u0027Say how many lovely years you have,\u0027 she ordered. Allgood found his throat contained no moisture. \u0027Almost four hundred, Calapine,\u0027 he rasped. Nourse chuckled. \u0027Ahead of you stretch many more lovely years if you serve us well,\u0027 he said. It was the closest to a direct threat Allgood had ever heard from an Optiman. They worked their wills by indirection, by euphemistic subtlety. They worked through meres who could face such concepts as death and killing. Who have they shaped to destroy me? Allgood wondered. \u0027Many little tick-lock years,\u0027 Calapine said. \u0027Enough!\u0027 Schruille growled. He detested these interviews with the underclasses, the way Calapine baited the Folk. He swiveled his throne and now all the Tuyere faced the open segment. Schruille looked at his fingers, the ever youthful skin, and wondered why he had snapped that way. An enzymic imbalance? The thought touched him with disquiet. He generally held his silence during these sessions - as a defense because he tended to get sentimental about the pitiful meres and despise himself for it afterward. Boumour moved up beside Allgood, said, \u0027Does the Tuyere wish now the report on the Durants?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-5.html","bookId":2174,"book":{"id":2174,"title":"The Eyes of Heisenberg","description":"Storyline: A New World in Embryo Public Law 10927 was clear and direct.
