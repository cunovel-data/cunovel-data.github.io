Seven THE place was a pumping station for the sewage reclamation system of Seatac Megalopolis. It lay at the eleven hundred foot level on the spur line that sent by-product irrigation water into Grand Coulee system. A four-storey box of sampling pipes, computer consoles and access cat-walks aglow with force-buoyed lights, it throbbed to the pulse of the giant turbines it controlled. The Durants had come down through the personnel tubes during the evening rush hour, moving in easy random stages that insured they weren\u0027t followed and that they carried no tracer devices. Five inspection tubes had passed them as clean. Still, they were careful to read the faces and actions of the people who jostled past. Most of the people were dull pages, hurried, intent on their business. Occasionally, they exchanged a mutual reading-glance with another courier, or identified sub-officials with the fear goading them on Optiman errands. No one noticed a couple in workman brown, their hands clasped, who emerged onto Catwalk Nine of the pumping station. The Durants paused there to survey their surroundings. They were tired, elated and more than a little awed at having been summoned into the control core of the Parents Underground. The smell of hydrocarbons filled the air around them. Lizbeth sniffed. Her silent conversation through their clasped hands carried overtones of tension. Harvey worked to reassure her. \u0027It\u0027s probably our Glisson we\u0027re to see,\u0027 he said. \u0027There could be other Cyborgs with the same name,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not likely.\u0027 He urged her out onto the catwalk, past a hover light. They took a left branching past two workmen reading Pilot gauges, their faces in odd shadows created by the lights from below. Lizbeth felt the lonely exposure of their position, signaled, \u0027How can we be sure they aren\u0027t watching us here?\u0027 \u0027This must be one of our places,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know.\u0027 \u0027How can it be?\u0027 \u0027Route the scanners through editing computers,\u0027 he said. \u0027The Opts see only what we want them to see then.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s dangerous to feel sure of such things,\u0027 she said. Then, \u0027Why have they summoned us?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll know in a few minutes,\u0027 he said. The walk led through a dust-excluding lock port into a tool bunker, gray walls punctured by outlets for transmission tubes, the inevitable computer controls blinking, ticking, chuckling, whirring. The place smelled of a sweet oil. As the port clanged shut behind the Durants, a figure came from their left and sat on a padded bench across from them. The Durants stared silently, recognizing and repelled by the recognition. The figure\u0027s outline suggested neither man nor woman. It looked planted there in the seat, and as they watched, it pulled thin cables from pockets in its gray coveralls, plugged the cables into the computer wall. Harvey brought his attention up to the square, deeply seamed face and the light gray eyes with their stare of blank directness, that coldly measured observation which was a trademark of the Cyborg. \u0027Glisson,\u0027 Harvey said, \u0027you summoned us?\u0027 \u0027I summoned you,\u0027 the Cyborg said. \u0027It has been many years, Durant. Do you still fear us? I see that you do. You are late.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re unfamiliar with this area,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027We came carefully,\u0027 Lizbeth said. \u0027Then I taught you well,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You were reasonably good pupils.\u0027 Through their clasped hands, Lizbeth signaled \u0027They\u0027re so hard to read, but something\u0027s wrong.\u0027 She averted her eyes from the Cyborg, chilled by the weighted stare. No matter how she tried to think of them as flesh and blood, her mind could never evade the knowledge that such bodies contained miniaturized computers linked directly to the brain, that the arms were not arms but prosthetic tools and weapons. And the voice - always such a clipped-off unemotional quality. \u0027You should not fear us, madam,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Unless you are not Lizbeth Durant.\u0027 Harvey failed to repress the snap of anger, said, \u0027Don\u0027t talk to her that way! You don\u0027t own us.\u0027 \u0027What is the first lesson I taught you after you were recruited?\u0027 Glisson asked. Harvey brought himself under control, forced a rueful smile onto his mouth. To hold our tempers,\u0027 he said. Lizbeth\u0027s hand. continued to tremble in his. That lesson you did not learn well,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027I overlook your fallibility.\u0027 Through their hands, Lizbeth signaled, \u0027It was prepared for violence against us.\u0027 Harvey acknowledged. \u0027First,\u0027 Glisson said, \u0027you will report on the genetic operation.\u0027 There was a pause while the Cyborg changed its jacked connections to the computer wall. \u0027Do not be distracted by my work. I distribute tools - thus\u0027 - it indicated the bunker - \u0027this\u0027 space which appears on their screens as a space filled with tools, will never be investigated.\u0027 A bench slid from the wall to the Durants\u0027 right. \u0027If you are. fatigued, sit,\u0027 Glisson said. The Cyborg indicated its cable linkage to the wall computer. \u0027I sit only that I may carry on the work of this space while we speak.\u0027 The Cyborg smiled, a stiff rictus to signify that the Durants must realize such as Glisson did not feel fatigue. Harvey urged Lizbeth to the bench. She sat as he signaled, \u0027Caution. Glisson\u0027s maneuvering us. Something\u0027s being hidden.\u0027 Glisson turned slightly to face them, said, \u0027A verbal, factual, complete report. Leave out nothing, no matter how trivial it may seem to you. I have limitless capacity for data.\u0027 They began recounting what they had observed of the genetic operation, taking up from each other on cue without a break as good couriers were taught to do. Harvey experienced the odd feeling during the recital that he and Lizbeth became part of the Cyborg\u0027s mechanism. Questions came so mechanically from Glisson\u0027s lips. Their answers felt so clinical. He had to keep reminding himself. This is our son we discuss. Presently, Glisson said. There seems no doubt we\u0027ve another viable immune to the gas. Your evidence virtually completes the picture. We have other data, you know.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t know the surgeon was one of us,\u0027 Lizbeth said. There was a pause while Glisson\u0027s eyes went even blanker than usual. The Durants felt they could almost see the esoteric formulae flitting through Glisson\u0027s thinking-banks. It was said the Cyborgs composed most of their thoughts only in higher math, translating to common language as it suited them. The surgeon was not one of us,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027But he soon will be.\u0027 What strategic formula produced those words, Harvey wondered. \u0027What about the computer tape on the operation?\u0027 he asked. \u0027It\u0027s destroyed,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Even now, your embryo is being removed to a safe place. You will join him soon.\u0027 A mechanical chuckle escaped the Cyborg\u0027s lips. Lizbeth shivered. Harvey felt the tension of her through their hands. He said, Ts our son safe?\u0027 \u0027Safe,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Our plans insure that safety.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 Lizbeth asked. \u0027You will understand soon,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027An ancient and reliable way of safe concealment. Be assured: viables are valuable weapons. We do not risk our valuable weapons.\u0027 Lizbeth signaled, \u0027The cut - ask now.\u0027 Harvey wet his lips with his tongue, said. There are... when a Central surgeon\u0027s called in, usually it means the embryo could be cut to Optiman. Did they... is our son...\u0027 Glisson\u0027s nostrils flared. The face took on a look of hauteur that said such ignorance insulted a Cyborg. The clipped voice said, \u0027We would require a complete tape record, including the enzymic data even to guess. The tape is gone. Only the surgeon knows the result of the operation for certain. We have yet to question him.\u0027 Lizbeth said: \u0027Svengaard or the computer nurse might\u0027ve said something that- \u0027 \u0027Svengaard is a dolt,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027The computer nurse is dead.\u0027 \u0027They killed her?\u0027 Lizbeth whispered. \u0027How she died isn\u0027t important.\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027She served her purpose.\u0027 With his hand, Harvey signaled, \u0027The Cyborgs had something to do with her death\u0027 \u0027I saw,\u0027 she answered. Harvey said, \u0027Are you... will we be allowed to talk to Potter?\u0027 \u0027Potter will be offered full Cyborg status.\u0027 Glisson said. Talking will be his decision... afterward.\u0027 \u0027We want to know about our son!\u0027 Lizbeth flared. Harvey signaled frantically, \u0027Apologize!\u0027 \u0027Madame,\u0027 Glisson said, \u0027let me remind you the so-called Optiman cut is not a state to which we aspire. Remember your vows.\u0027 She squeezed Harvey\u0027s hand to silence his signals, said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry. It was such a shock to learn... the possibility...\u0027 \u0027Your emotional excesses are taken into account as a mitigating circumstance,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027It is well, therefore, that I warn you of a thing to happen. You will hear things about your son which you must not let excite you.\u0027 \u0027What things?\u0027 Lizbeth whispered. \u0027An outside force of unknown origin sometimes interferes with the anticipated course of a genetic operation,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027There is reason to believe this happened with your son.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 Harvey asked. \u0027Mean!\u0027 Glisson sneered. \u0027You ask questions to which there are no answers.\u0027 \u0027What does this... thing do?\u0027 Lizbeth supplied. Glisson looked at her. \u0027It behaves somewhat in the fashion of a charged particle, penetrates the genetic core and alters the structure If this has happened to your son, you may consider it beneficial because it apparently prevents the Optiman cut.\u0027 The Durants digested this. Presently, Harvey said, \u0027Do you require more of us? May we go now?\u0027 \u0027You will remain here,\u0027 Glisson said. They stared. \u0027You will wait for further orders,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027But we\u0027ll be missed,\u0027 Lizbeth said. \u0027Our apartment, they\u0027ll-\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve raised doppelgangers to play your roles long enough for you to escape Seatac,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027You can never go back. You should\u0027ve known this.\u0027 Harvey\u0027s lips moved, then, \u0027Escape? What\u0027s... why are...\u0027 \u0027There is violence,\u0027 Glisson said. \u0027Even now. The death-wish cult will have their day.\u0027 The Cyborg raised its gaze toward the ceiling. \u0027War... blood... killing. It will be as it was before when the skies flamed and the earth ran molten.\u0027 Harvey cleared his throat. Wars... before. Glisson gave the impression that wars had been recent, perhaps only yesterday. And for this Cyborg that might be true. It was said that Glisson\u0027s grandsire had fought in the Optiman-Cyborg war. No one of the Underground Folk knew how many identities Glisson had lived. \u0027Where\u0027ll we go?\u0027 Harvey asked. He signaled Lizbeth not to interrupt. \u0027A place has been prepared,\u0027 Glisson said. The Cyborg arose, unplugged its linkage with the computer panel, said, \u0027You will wait here. Do not attempt to leave. Your needs will be provided for.\u0027 Glisson left by the lock port and it sealed with a heavy thump. \u0027They\u0027re as bad as the Optimen,\u0027 Lizbeth signaled. \u0027The day will come when we\u0027re free of both them and the Opts,\u0027 Harvey said. \u0027It\u0027ll never happen,\u0027 she said. \u0027Don\u0027t say that!\u0027 he ordered. \u0027If only we knew a friendly surgeon,\u0027 she said. \u0027We could take our son and run.\u0027 \u0027That foolishness! How could we service the vat without machinery for-\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve that machinery right inside me,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was... born with it.\u0027 Harvey stared at her, shocked speechless. \u0027I don\u0027t want the Cyborgs or the Opts controlling our son\u0027s life,\u0027 she said, \u0027regulating his mind with hypnotic gas, making duplicates of him for their own purposes, pushing him and leading him and- \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t work yourself into a state.\u0027-he said. \u0027You heard him,\u0027 she said. \u0027Doppelgangers! They can regulate anything - our very being! They can condition us to... to... do anything! For all we know, we\u0027ve been conditioned to be here right now!\u0027 \u0027Liz, you\u0027re being unreasonable.\u0027 \u0027Unreasonable? Look at me! They can take a piece of my skin and grow an identical copy. Me! Identical! How do you know I\u0027m me? How do you know I\u0027m the original me? How do I know?\u0027 He gripped her free arm and for a moment had no words. Presently, he forced himself to relax, shook his head. \u0027You\u0027re you, Liz. You\u0027re not flesh grown from a cell. You\u0027re...all the things we\u0027ve shared... and been... and done together. They couldn\u0027t duplicate memories... not that with a doppelganger.\u0027 She pressed her cheek against the rough fabric of his jacket, wanting the comfort of it, the tactile sensation that told her body he was here and he was real. \u0027They\u0027ll make doppelgangers of our son,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s what they\u0027re planning. You know it.\u0027 \u0027Then we\u0027ll have many sons.\u0027 \u0027For what reason? She looked up at him, her lashes damp with unshed tears. \u0027You heard what Gliswn said. Something from outside adjusted our embryo.
