{"id":13867,"no":12,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 12","content":"\"SIR,\" CAPTAIN NEMO SAID, showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom, \"these are the devices needed to navigate the Nautilus. Here, as in the lounge, I always have them before my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean. You\u0027re familiar with some of them, such as the thermometer, which gives the temperature inside the Nautilus; the barometer, which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather; the humidistat, which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere; the storm glass, whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests; the compass, which steers my course; the sextant, which takes the sun\u0027s altitude and tells me my latitude; chronometers, which allow me to calculate my longitude; and finally, spyglasses for both day and night, enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves.\" \"These are the normal navigational instruments,\" I replied, \"and I\u0027m familiar with their uses. But no doubt these others answer pressing needs unique to the Nautilus. That dial I see there, with the needle moving across it--isn\u0027t it a pressure gauge?\" \"It is indeed a pressure gauge. It\u0027s placed in contact with the water, and it indicates the outside pressure on our hull, which in turn gives me the depth at which my submersible is sitting.\" \"And these are some new breed of sounding line?\" \"They\u0027re thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in the different strata.\" \"And these other instruments, whose functions I can\u0027t even guess?\" \"Here, professor, I need to give you some background information,\" Captain Nemo said. \"So kindly hear me out.\" He fell silent for some moments, then he said: \"There\u0027s a powerful, obedient, swift, and effortless force that can be bent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel. It does everything. It lights me, it warms me, it\u0027s the soul of my mechanical equipment. This force is electricity.\" \"Electricity!\" I exclaimed in some surprise. \"Yes, sir.\" \"But, captain, you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn\u0027t square with the strength of electricity. Until now, its dynamic potential has remained quite limited, capable of producing only small amounts of power!\" \"Professor,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"my electricity isn\u0027t the run-of-the-mill variety, and with your permission, I\u0027ll leave it at that.\" \"I won\u0027t insist, sir, and I\u0027ll rest content with simply being flabbergasted at your results. I would ask one question, however, which you needn\u0027t answer if it\u0027s indiscreet. The electric cells you use to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very quickly. Their zinc component, for example: how do you replace it, since you no longer stay in contact with the shore?\" \"That question deserves an answer,\" Captain Nemo replied. \"First off, I\u0027ll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins of zinc, iron, silver, and gold whose mining would quite certainly be feasible. But I\u0027ve tapped none of these land-based metals, and I wanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources of my electricity.\" \"The sea itself?\" \"Yes, professor, and there was no shortage of such sources. In fact, by establishing a circuit between two wires immersed to different depths, I\u0027d be able to obtain electricity through the diverging temperatures they experience; but I preferred to use a more practical procedure.\" \"And that is?\" \"You\u0027re familiar with the composition of salt water. In 1,000 grams one finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small quantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium bromide, sulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate. Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there in significant proportions. Now then, it\u0027s this sodium that I extract from salt water and with which I compose my electric cells.\" \"Sodium?\" \"Yes, sir. Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes the place of zinc in Bunsen cells. The mercury is never depleted. Only the sodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that. Beyond this, I\u0027ll mention that sodium batteries have been found to generate the greater energy, and their electro-motor strength is twice that of zinc batteries.\" \"Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the conditions in which you\u0027re placed. The sea contains it. Fine. But it still has to be produced, in short, extracted. And how do you accomplish this? Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but if I\u0027m not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric equipment would be greater than the quantity you\u0027d extract. It would come about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium, you\u0027d use up more than you\u0027d make!\" \"Accordingly, professor, I don\u0027t extract it with batteries; quite simply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth.\" \"From the earth?\" I said, my voice going up on the word. \"We\u0027ll say coal from the seafloor, if you prefer,\" Captain Nemo replied. \"And you can mine these veins of underwater coal?\" \"You\u0027ll watch me work them, Professor Aronnax. I ask only a little patience of you, since you\u0027ll have ample time to be patient. Just remember one thing: I owe everything to the ocean; it generates electricity, and electricity gives the Nautilus heat, light, motion, and, in a word, life itself.\" \"But not the air you breathe?\" \"Oh, I could produce the air needed on board, but it would be pointless, since I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I like. However, even though electricity doesn\u0027t supply me with breathable air, it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it under pressure in special tanks; which, if need be, allows me to extend my stay in the lower strata for as long as I want.\" \"Captain,\" I replied, \"I\u0027ll rest content with marveling. You\u0027ve obviously found what all mankind will surely find one day, the true dynamic power of electricity.\" \"I\u0027m not so certain they\u0027ll find it,\" Captain Nemo replied icily. \"But be that as it may, you\u0027re already familiar with the first use I\u0027ve found for this valuable force. It lights us, and with a uniformity and continuity not even possessed by sunlight. Now, look at that clock: it\u0027s electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers. I\u0027ve had it divided into twenty-four hours like Italian clocks, since neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but only this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas! See, right now it\u0027s ten o\u0027clock in the morning.\" \"That\u0027s perfect.\" \"Another use for electricity: that dial hanging before our eyes indicates how fast the Nautilus is going. An electric wire puts it in contact with the patent log; this needle shows me the actual speed of my submersible. And . . . hold on . . . just now we\u0027re proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour.\" \"It\u0027s marvelous,\" I replied, \"and I truly see, captain, how right you are to use this force; it\u0027s sure to take the place of wind, water, and steam.\" \"But that\u0027s not all, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo said, standing up. \"And if you\u0027d care to follow me, we\u0027ll inspect the Nautilus\u0027s stern.\" In essence, I was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat, and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur: the dining room, 5 meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead, in other words, it couldn\u0027t be penetrated by the sea; the library, 5 meters long; the main lounge, 10 meters long, separated from the captain\u0027s stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead; the aforesaid stateroom, 5 meters long; mine, 2.5 meters long; and finally, air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to the stempost. Total: a length of 35 meters. Doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india-rubber seals, which insured complete safety aboard the Nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section. I followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit, and I arrived amidships. There I found a sort of shaft heading upward between two watertight bulkheads. An iron ladder, clamped to the wall, led to the shaft\u0027s upper end. I asked the captain what this ladder was for. \"It goes to the skiff,\" he replied. \"What! You have a skiff?\" I replied in some astonishment. \"Surely. An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used for excursions and fishing trips.\" \"But when you want to set out, don\u0027t you have to return to the surface of the sea?\" \"By no means. The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus\u0027s hull and is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it. It\u0027s completely decked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in place by bolts. This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus\u0027s hull and corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the skiff. I insert myself through this double opening into the longboat. My crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus; I close up the one belonging to the skiff, simply by screwing it into place. I undo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible, and the longboat rises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea. I then open the deck paneling, carefully closed until that point; I up mast and hoist sail--or I take out my oars--and I go for a spin.\" \"But how do you return to the ship?\" \"I don\u0027t, Professor Aronnax; the Nautilus returns to me.\" \"At your command?\" \"At my command. An electric wire connects me to the ship. I fire off a telegram, and that\u0027s that.\" \"Right,\" I said, tipsy from all these wonders, \"nothing to it!\" After passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform, I saw a cabin 2 meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land, enraptured with their meal, were busy devouring it to the last crumb. Then a door opened into the galley, 3 meters long and located between the vessel\u0027s huge storage lockers. There, even more powerful and obedient than gas, electricity did most of the cooking. Arriving under the stoves, wires transmitted to platinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained with perfect consistency. It also heated a distilling mechanism that, via evaporation, supplied excellent drinking water. Next to this galley was a bathroom, conveniently laid out, with faucets supplying hot or cold water at will. After the galley came the crew\u0027s quarters, 5 meters long. But the door was closed and I couldn\u0027t see its accommodations, which might have told me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus. At the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead, separating the crew\u0027s quarters from the engine room. A door opened, and I stood in the compartment where Captain Nemo, indisputably a world-class engineer, had set up his locomotive equipment. Brightly lit, the engine room measured at least 20 meters in length. It was divided, by function, into two parts: the first contained the cells for generating electricity, the second that mechanism transmitting movement to the propeller. Right off, I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was sui generis.* Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it made on me. *Latin: \"in a class by itself.\" Ed. \"That,\" he told me, \"is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of sodium, but it\u0027s only a mild inconvenience. In any event, every morning we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air.\" Meanwhile I examined the Nautilus\u0027s engine with a fascination easy to imagine. \"You observe,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"that I use Bunsen cells, not Ruhmkorff cells. The latter would be ineffectual. One uses fewer Bunsen cells, but they\u0027re big and strong, and experience has proven their superiority. The electricity generated here makes its way to the stern, where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system of levers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller\u0027s shaft. The latter has a diameter of 6 meters, a pitch of 7.5 meters, and can do up to 120 revolutions per minute.\" \"And that gives you?\" \"A speed of fifty miles per hour.\" There lay a mystery, but I didn\u0027t insist on exploring it. How could electricity work with such power? Where did this nearly unlimited energy originate? Was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil? Could its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers?** This was the point I couldn\u0027t grasp. **Author\u0027s Note: And sure enough, there\u0027s now talk of such a discovery, in which a new set of levers generates considerable power. Did its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo? \"Captain Nemo,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll vouch for the results and not try to explain them. I\u0027ve seen the Nautilus at work out in front of the Abraham Lincoln, and I know where I stand on its speed. But it isn\u0027t enough just to move, we have to see where we\u0027re going! We must be able to steer right or left, up or down! How do you reach the lower depths, where you meet an increasing resistance that\u0027s assessed in hundreds of atmospheres? How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean? Finally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you? Am I indiscreet in asking you all these things?\" \"Not at all, professor,\" the captain answered me after a slight hesitation, \"since you\u0027ll never leave this underwater boat. Come into the lounge. It\u0027s actually our work room, and there you\u0027ll learn the full story about the Nautilus!\" “先生，”尼摩船长指着挂在他房中墙壁上的仪表说，‘这些就是诺第留斯号航行所必需的仪表。在这里跟在客厅里一样，我总是注意着它们，这些仪表给我指出我在海洋中间的实际位置和准确方向。其中有些仪表您是知道的，例如温度表，指出诺第留斯号内的温度，风雨表，测出空气的重量和预告天气的变化，温度表，指示空气干温度数；暴风镜，一当镜中的混合物分解时，便预告暴风雨就将来到；罗盘，指引我的航路；六分仪，测太阳的高低，使我知道船所在的纬度，经线仪，使我可以算出船的经度；最后是日间用的望远镜和夜间用的望远镜，当诺第留斯号浮上水面时，我可以侦察天际四周。” “这些是航海家常用的仪器，”我答，“我知道它们的用法。但这里还有其它的仪器，一定是作为诺第留斯号特殊需要而用的。我现在看见的这个表盘，上面有能转动的针，那不是流体压力计吗？” “正是流体压力计。它是跟海水相通的，可以指出外面海水的压力，因此，我便知道我这船所在的深度。”“那些新式的测验器又是做什么用的呢？” “那些是温度测验器，给我报告海底下面各水层的温度。”“还有那些我猜不到用处的仪器呢？” “教授，谈到这里，我就应当给您说明一下，”尼摩船长说，“请您听我说吧.\" 他静默了一会，然后说： “这里有一种强大的顺手的迅速的方便的原动力，它可以有各种用处，船上一切依靠它。所有一切都由它造出来。它给我光，它给我热，它是我船上机械的灵魂。这原动力就是电。” “电！”我惊异得叫起来。 “是的，先生。” “但是，船长，您这只船移动的速度这么快，这跟电的力量不太符合。到目前为止，电力还是很有限的，只能产生相当有限的力量！” “教授，”尼摩船长回答，“我的电不是一般的电，这就是我可以对您说的一句话。” “先生，我不想再追问，我只是对于这样一种效果感到十分奇怪。不过有一个问题我要提出来，如果是不应该问的，那您可以不答复。您用来生产这种出奇原动力的物质当然是很快就要用完的。例如锌，既然您跟地上没有什么联系，用完了，您怎样补充呢?\" “您这个问题可以得到答复。”尼摩船长回答，“首先，我对您说，海底有锌、铁、银、金等矿藏，开发并不是不可能的事。但我并不借助于陆地上的这些金属，我只是要大海本身来供给我生产电力的原料。， “要海来供给？” “是的，教授，我的方怯多着呢。譬如我可以把沉在不同深度下的金属线连结成电路，金属线受到的不同热度就产生电：但我通常采用的，是另一种比较方便而实用的方法。” “是哪种方法呢？” “海水的成份您是知道的。一千克的海水有百分之九十六点五是水，百分之二点七左右是氯化钠，其余就是小量的氯化镁，氯化钾，澳化镁，硫酸镁，硫酸和石炭酸。由此您可以看出，氯化钠在海水中含有相当大的分量。而我从海水中提出来的就是钠，我就是用这些钠制造我所需要的物质。” “钠吗？” “是的，先生。钠跟汞混合，成为一种合金，代替本生①电池中所需要的锌。汞是不会损失的，只有钠才要消耗，但海水本身供给我所需要的钠。此外我还可以告诉您，钠电池应当是最强的，它的电动力比锌电池要强好几倍。” “船长， 我很明白您在这种情形中获得钠的优越性。海水中含有钠6对。不过还要把它制出来，就是说，要把它提出来。您是怎样做的呢？当然您的电池可以做这种工作，不过，如果我没有说错，电动机器消耗的钠的数量，恐怕要超过提出来的钠的数量。那么结果您为生产而消费的钠。实际上比您所能生产的钠数量要多！” “教授，我并不用电池提取，我简单地用陆地上煤炭的热力就是了。， “陆地上的？”我着重地说。 “就说是海底的煤炭吧。”尼摩船长回答。 “您可以在海底开采煤旷吗？” “阿龙纳斯先生，您将会看到我开采。我只请您忍耐些时候，因为您有时间，可以等待一下。我单单请您注意这点：我什么都是取自海洋, 利用海洋发电，供给诺第留斯号热、光、动力，简单一句话。电给诺第留斯号生命。” “但电不能供给您呼吸的空气吧？” “呵！我也可以制造空气供我消费，但没有什么必要，因为我高兴时，我可以随便浮到海面上来。但是，电虽不供给我可以呼吸的空气，它可以发动强大的抽气机，把空气送人特殊的密封室，这样，我可以根据需要停留在海底深处，时间要多久就多久.\" “船长，”我回答，“我只有佩服，您显然是找到了人类将来可能找到的东西，那就是真正的电的力量。” “我不知道他们是不是总有一无能够找到，”尼摩船长冷淡地回答，“不管怎样，您已经看到了我用这种宝贵的原动力所做的第一次实际应用. 就是它，有太阳光所没有的平均性、连续性，给我们照亮。现在，您请看这座钟，它是用电转动的，走得十分准确，可跟最完善、最准确的钟表比赛。我把它分为二十四小时，像意大利制的钟一样；因为在我来说，既没有白天和黑夜，也没有太阳和月亮，只有我能一直把它带到海底去的这种人造光！您看，现在是早晨十点。” “对。” “下面是电的另一种用途。挂在我们面前的这个表盘，是用来指示诺第留斯号的速度的。一根电线把它跟测程器的螺旋桨连接起来，它上面的长针给我指出船行的实际快慢。请看，此刻我们是以每小时十五海里的中等速度行驶着。”。“真了不得。”我答，“船长，我很明白您使用这种原动力的理由，因为这原动力是可以替代风、水和蒸汽。、 “阿龙纳斯先生，我们的活还没有完呢，”尼摩船长站起来说，“请您跟着我来，我们去看看诺第留斯号的后部。” 我现在已经看完了这只潜水艇前头的整个部分，从船中心到船前头，前半部的正确区分如下：长五米的餐厅，一扇隔板，即不能让水渗人的隔板，把它跟图书室隔开；长五举的图书室，长十米的大客厅，第二扇隔板把它跟船长的房间隔开；长五米的船长室；长两米半的我的房间；最后是长六米半的储藏空气的密室，它紧贴着船头。前半部全长是三十五米。防水隔板都开有门，橡胶闭塞器把门关得紧紧的，即使有个把漏洞，也可以保证诺第留斯号的安全。、我跟着尼摩船长，穿过船边的狭窄过道，到了船的中心。在船中心两扇隔板之间有井一般的开口。顺着内壁有一架铁梯子一直通到这口井的上部。我问船长这梯子作什么用。 “它通到小艇。”他回答。 “什么！您还有一只小艇吗？”我有些惊异地说。 “当然喽。一只很好的小艇，轻快，又不怕沉没，可洪游览和钓鱼之用。” “那么您想登上小艇的时候，您必定要浮到水面上去：吗 “并不需要。这小艇系在诺第留斯号船身的上部，放在一个特别用来藏它的凹洞里。小艇全部装有甲板，完全不透水，用结实的螺丝铰钉钉着。铁梯通到诺第留斯号船身上的一个单人小孔，这孔紧接着小艇身上的一个大小相同的孔。我就由这两个孔到小艇上去。一个人用压力螺钉，关上了诺第留斯号的孔门，同时我就关上了小艇的孔门；我松开铰钉，小艇就以很快的速度浮上水面。我于是就打开本来是紧闭着的盖板，竖起桅杆，扯开凤帆或划起桨来，我就在水上漫游了。 “但您怎样回到大船上呢？” “阿龙纳斯先生，不是我回去，而是诺第留斯号回到我1身边来。” “它听您的吩咐？” “它听我的吩咐。一根电线把我跟它连系在一起。我只要打个电报就行了。” “的确，”我说，我被这些奇迹陶醉了，“没有比这更方便的了！” 我走过了通到平台的梯笼间，看见一间长二米的舱房，康塞尔和尼德。兰两人正在那里狼吞虎咽，很快活地吃他们的饭。随后，又有一道门通到长三米的厨房，厨房是在宽大的食品储藏室中间。 在厨房里，一切烹任工作都利用电气，电气比煤气更有效更方便。电线接到炉子下面，把热力传给白金片，热力分配到各处，保持一定的、规律的温度。电又烧热蒸馏器，由。子汽化作用，可以供给人清洁的饮水。挨着厨房，有一个浴室，布置得很舒适，室内的水龙头可以随人的意思供应冷水或热水。 连着厨房的便是船员的工作室，长五米。房门关着，我看不见内部的布置，但是我似乎觉得它是根据驾驶诺第留斯号需要的人数来决定的. 里面，第四道防水板把这个工作室和机器间隔开。门打开了，我走进了一间房子，里面尼摩船长（他无疑是第一流的工程师）装置着各种驾驶船的机器。 这个机器间，照得通明，有二十多米长。内部很自然地分成两部分：第一部分放着生产电力的原料，第二部分装着转动螺旋桨的机器。 我一进去，由于满屋子有一种说不出是什么的气味，感到不习惯。尼摩船长看出我的神情，他说： 这是钠分解出来的气体；就这一点美中不足。我们每天早晨总要把船露出水面通一次凤，清除这种气体。” 这时我以极大的兴趣研究着诺第留斯号的机器设备。“您看，”尼摩船长对我说，“我用的是本生电池的装置，不是兰可夫①电池的装置，后一种电力不强。本生电池的装置虽然简单，但电力很强，经验证明，确实如此。产生出来的电传到后面，使面积很大的电磁铁对杠杆和轮齿组成的特殊机构所起的作用，转动推进器的轮轴，全船于是就走动了。推进器的直径是六米，涡轮的直径是七米半，每秒钟可转一百二十转。， “那您可以达到的最大速度是多少呢?\" “可以有一小时五十海里的高速度。· 其中有一个秘密，但我并不坚持要知道。电怎能发生这么强大的力量呢？这种差不多无限制的力量是从哪里得来的呢？这是从一种新型的变压器所造成的高电压中得来的吗？还是从一种秘密的杠杆机构可以无限制的增强①的转动中得来的呢？这是我不能理解的问题。 “尼摩船长,\"我说，“我看到摆在面前的事实，我不想求得这些事实的说明。我看见了诺第留斯号在林肯号前面行驶的力量，我就知道它的速度了。但只能使它走动是不够的〕我们还要能看见它向哪里走去！我们还要能指挥它向左、向右、向上、向下！您怎样能使它潜人最深的海底，因为水下面的阻力在不断增长，计算起来是有几千几万的大气压呢？您怎样又能使它上升到海面来呢？最后，您又怎样能使它维持在您认为合适的深度里面呢？我问您这些问题是不是太冒昧了?\" “并不冒昧，教授，”他略为迟疑了一下回答我，“因为您是不能离开我这只潜水艇的了。 请你进客厅来。客厅是我们 的真正工作室，在客厅里，您可以知道您对于诺第留斯号应该知道的一切！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/282.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
