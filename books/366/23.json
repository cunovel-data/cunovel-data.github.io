{"id":13878,"no":23,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 23","content":"*Latin: \"troubled dreams.\" Ed.\n THE FOLLOWING DAY, January 10, the Nautilus resumed its travels in midwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at least thirty-five miles per hour. The propeller was going so fast I could neither follow nor count its revolutions.\n I thought about how this marvelous electric force not only gave motion, heat, and light to the Nautilus but even protected it against outside attack, transforming it into a sacred ark no profane hand could touch without being blasted; my wonderment was boundless, and it went from the submersible itself to the engineer who had created it.\n We were traveling due west and on January 11 we doubled Cape Wessel, located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north, the western tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy. The Nautilus easily avoided the Money breakers to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard, positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel, which we went along rigorously.\n On January 13, arriving in the Timor Sea, Captain Nemo raised the island of that name at longitude 122 degrees. This island, whose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues, is governed by rajahs. These aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles, in other words, descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human being can lay claim. Accordingly, their scaly ancestors infest the island\u0027s rivers and are the subjects of special veneration. They are sheltered, nurtured, flattered, pampered, and offered a ritual diet of nubile maidens; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger against these sacred saurians.\n But the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals. Timor Island was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief officer determined his position. I also caught only a glimpse of little Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a well-established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace.\n After our position fix, the Nautilus\u0027s latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest. Our prow pointed to the Indian Ocean. Where would Captain Nemo\u0027s fancies take us? Would he head up to the shores of Asia? Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe? Unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas! So would he go down south? Would he double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and push on to the Antarctic pole? Finally, would he return to the seas of the Pacific, where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily? Time would tell.\n After cruising along the Cartier, Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott reefs, the solid element\u0027s last exertions against the liquid element, we were beyond all sight of shore by January 14. The Nautilus slowed down in an odd manner, and very unpredictable in its ways, it sometimes swam in the midst of the waters, sometimes drifted on their surface.\n During this phase of our voyage, Captain Nemo conducted interesting experiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the sea. Under ordinary conditions, such readings are obtained using some pretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious to say the least, whether they\u0027re thermometric sounding lines, whose glass often shatters under the water\u0027s pressure, or those devices based on the varying resistance of metals to electric currents. The results so obtained can\u0027t be adequately double-checked. By contrast, Captain Nemo would seek the sea\u0027s temperature by going himself into its depths, and when he placed his thermometer in contact with the various layers of liquid, he found the sought-for degree immediately and with certainty.\n And so, by loading up its ballast tanks, or by sinking obliquely with its slanting fins, the Nautilus successively reached depths of 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 10,000 meters, and the ultimate conclusion from these experiments was that, in all latitudes, the sea had a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees centigrade at a depth of 1,000 meters.\n I watched these experiments with the most intense fascination. Captain Nemo brought a real passion to them. I often wondered why he took these observations. Were they for the benefit of his fellow man? It was unlikely, because sooner or later his work would perish with him in some unknown sea! Unless he intended the results of his experiments for me. But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an end, and no such end was in sight.\n Be that as it may, Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different data he had obtained on the relative densities of the water in our globe\u0027s chief seas. From this news I derived some personal enlightenment having nothing to do with science.\n It happened the morning of January 15. The captain, with whom I was strolling on the platform, asked me if I knew how salt water differs in density from sea to sea. I said no, adding that there was a lack of rigorous scientific observations on this subject.\n \"I\u0027ve taken such observations,\" he told me, \"and I can vouch for their reliability.\"\n \"Fine,\" I replied, \"but the Nautilus lives in a separate world, and the secrets of its scientists don\u0027t make their way ashore.\"\n \"You\u0027re right, professor,\" he told me after a few moments of silence. \"This is a separate world. It\u0027s as alien to the earth as the planets accompanying our globe around the sun, and we\u0027ll never become familiar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter. But since fate has linked our two lives, I can reveal the results of my observations to you.\"\n \"I\u0027m all attention, captain.\"\n \"You\u0027re aware, professor, that salt water is denser than fresh water, but this density isn\u0027t uniform. In essence, if I represent the density of fresh water by 1.000, then I find 1.028 for the waters of the Atlantic, 1.026 for the waters of the Pacific, 1.030 for the waters of the Mediterranean--\"\n Aha, I thought, so he ventures into the Mediterranean?\n \"--1.018 for the waters of the Ionian Sea, and 1.029 for the waters of the Adriatic.\"\n Assuredly, the Nautilus didn\u0027t avoid the heavily traveled seas of Europe, and from this insight I concluded that the ship would take us back--perhaps very soon--to more civilized shores. I expected Ned Land to greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction.\n For several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of experiments, on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths, or on their electric properties, coloration, and transparency, and in every instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled only by his graciousness toward me. Then I saw no more of him for some days and again lived on board in seclusion.\n On January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water. Its electric equipment had been turned off, and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves. I assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs, required by the engine\u0027s strenuous mechanical action.\n My companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight. The panels in the lounge were open, and since the Nautilus\u0027s beacon was off, a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters. Covered with heavy clouds, the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean\u0027s upper strata.\n I was observing the state of the sea under these conditions, and even the largest fish were nothing more than ill-defined shadows, when the Nautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight. At first I thought the beacon had gone back on and was casting its electric light into the liquid mass. I was mistaken, and after a hasty examination I discovered my error.\n The Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent strata, which, in this darkness, came off as positively dazzling. This effect was caused by myriads of tiny, luminous animals whose brightness increased when they glided over the metal hull of our submersible. In the midst of these luminous sheets of water, I then glimpsed flashes of light, like those seen inside a blazing furnace from streams of molten lead or from masses of metal brought to a white heat--flashes so intense that certain areas of the light became shadows by comparison, in a fiery setting from which every shadow should seemingly have been banished. No, this was no longer the calm emission of our usual lighting! This light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity! You sensed that it was alive!\n In essence, it was a cluster of countless open-sea infusoria, of noctiluca an eighth of an inch wide, actual globules of transparent jelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle, up to 25,000 of which have been counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water. And the power of their light was increased by those glimmers unique to medusas, starfish, common jellyfish, angel-wing clams, and other phosphorescent zoophytes, which were saturated with grease from organic matter decomposed by the sea, and perhaps with mucus secreted by fish.\n For several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide, and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it, like the fire-dwelling salamanders of myth. In the midst of these flames that didn\u0027t burn, I could see swift, elegant porpoises, the tireless pranksters of the seas, and sailfish three meters long, those shrewd heralds of hurricanes, whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window. Then smaller fish appeared: miscellaneous triggerfish, leather jacks, unicornfish, and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course.\n Some magic lay behind this dazzling sight! Perhaps some atmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon? Perhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves? But only a few meters down, the Nautilus felt no tempest\u0027s fury, and the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters.\n And so it went, some new wonder constantly delighting us. Conseil observed and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and fish. The days passed quickly, and I no longer kept track of them. Ned, as usual, kept looking for changes of pace from our standard fare. Like actual snails, we were at home in our shell, and I can vouch that it\u0027s easy to turn into a full-fledged snail.\n So this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us, and we no longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface of the planet earth, when something happened to remind us of our strange circumstances.\n On January 18 the Nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude 15 degrees south. The weather was threatening, the sea rough and billowy. The wind was blowing a strong gust from the east. The barometer, which had been falling for some days, forecast an approaching struggle of the elements.\n I had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles. Out of habit I waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase. But that day it was replaced by a different phrase, just as incomprehensible. Almost at once I saw Captain Nemo appear, lift his spyglass, and inspect the horizon.\n For some minutes the captain stood motionless, rooted to the spot contained within the field of his lens. Then he lowered his spyglass and exchanged about ten words with his chief officer. The latter seemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain to control. More in command of himself, Captain Nemo remained cool. Furthermore, he seemed to be raising certain objections that his chief officer kept answering with flat assurances. At least that\u0027s what I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture.\n As for me, I stared industriously in the direction under observation but without spotting a thing. Sky and water merged into a perfectly clean horizon line.\n Meanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other, not glancing at me, perhaps not even seeing me. His step was firm but less regular than usual. Sometimes he would stop, cross his arms over his chest, and observe the sea. What could he be looking for over that immense expanse? By then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast!\n The chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly examining the horizon, walking up and down, stamping his foot, in his nervous agitation a sharp contrast to his superior.\n But this mystery would inevitably be cleared up, and soon, because Captain Nemo gave orders to increase speed; at once the engine stepped up its drive power, setting the propeller in swifter rotation.\n Just then the chief officer drew the captain\u0027s attention anew. The latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated. He observed it a good while. As for me, deeply puzzled, I went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long-range telescope I habitually used. Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing, which jutted from the stern of the platform, I got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea.\n But no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands.\n I spun around. Captain Nemo was standing before me, but I almost didn\u0027t recognize him. His facial features were transfigured. Gleaming with dark fire, his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow. His teeth were half bared. His rigid body, clenched fists, and head drawn between his shoulders, all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore. He didn\u0027t move. My spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet.\n Had I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger? Did this incomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret forbidden to guests on the Nautilus?\n No! I wasn\u0027t the subject of his hate because he wasn\u0027t even looking at me; his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point of the horizon.\n Finally Captain Nemo regained his self-control. His facial appearance, so profoundly changed, now resumed its usual calm. He addressed a few words to his chief officer in their strange language, then he turned to me:\n \"Professor Aronnax,\" he told me in a tone of some urgency, \"I ask that you now honor one of the binding agreements between us.\"\n \"Which one, captain?\"\n \"You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see fit to set you free.\"\n \"You\u0027re in command,\" I answered, gaping at him. \"But may I address a question to you?\"\n \"You may not, sir.\"\n After that, I stopped objecting and started obeying, since resistance was useless.\n I went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil, and I informed them of the captain\u0027s decision. I\u0027ll let the reader decide how this news was received by the Canadian. In any case, there was no time for explanations. Four crewmen were waiting at the door, and they led us to the cell where we had spent our first night aboard the Nautilus.\n Ned Land tried to lodge a complaint, but the only answer he got was a door shut in his face.\n \"Will master tell me what this means?\" Conseil asked me.\n I told my companions what had happened. They were as astonished as I was, but no wiser.\n Then I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo\u0027s strange facial seizure kept haunting me. I was incapable of connecting two ideas in logical order, and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses, when I was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from Ned Land:\n \"Well, look here! Lunch is served!\"\n Indeed, the table had been laid. Apparently Captain Nemo had given this order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up speed.\n \"Will master allow me to make him a recommendation?\" Conseil asked me.\n \"Yes, my boy,\" I replied.\n \"Well, master needs to eat his lunch! It\u0027s prudent, because we have no idea what the future holds.\"\n \"You\u0027re right, Conseil.\"\n \"Unfortunately,\" Ned Land said, \"they\u0027ve only given us the standard menu.\"\n \"Ned my friend,\" Conseil answered, \"what would you say if they\u0027d given us no lunch at all?\"\n This dose of sanity cut the harpooner\u0027s complaints clean off.\n We sat down at the table. Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence. I ate very little. Conseil, everlastingly prudent, \"force-fed\" himself; and despite the menu, Ned Land didn\u0027t waste a bite. Then, lunch over, each of us propped himself in a corner.\n Just then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out, leaving us in profound darkness. Ned Land soon dozed off, and to my astonishment, Conseil also fell into a heavy slumber. I was wondering what could have caused this urgent need for sleep, when I felt a dense torpor saturate my brain. I tried to keep my eyes open, but they closed in spite of me. I was in the grip of anguished hallucinations. Obviously some sleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we\u0027d just eaten! So imprisonment wasn\u0027t enough to conceal Captain Nemo\u0027s plans from us-- sleep was needed as well!\n Then I heard the hatches close. The sea\u0027s undulations, which had been creating a gentle rocking motion, now ceased. Had the Nautilus left the surface of the ocean? Was it reentering the motionless strata deep in the sea?\n I tried to fight off this drowsiness. It was impossible. My breathing grew weaker. I felt a mortal chill freeze my dull, nearly paralyzed limbs. Like little domes of lead, my lids fell over my eyes. I couldn\u0027t raise them. A morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, seized my whole being. Then the visions disappeared and left me in utter oblivion.\n 第二天，1月10日,诺第留斯号又在水中航行了，它的速度我可以估计，不会少于每小时三十五海里。它的机轮推动得那么快，我简直不能看出它在运转，也不能加以计算.\n 我想到这神奇的电，除了给诺第留斯号以动力、热力、光明之外，又能保护它不受外界的攻击，使它变为神圣不可侵犯的船，想来侵犯的人决不能不受到电击的，我对它的赞美实在是没有止境，我的赞美立时又从这船转到制造这船的工程师。\n 我们一直往西开行，1月11日，我们走过了韦塞尔角, 角在东经135度和南纬10度, 是卡彭塔里亚海湾的东尖端。海中的礁石仍然很多，但较为零散，在地图上记载得很明确。诺第留斯号很容易躲开在它左舷的摩宜礁石，和右舷的维多利亚暗礁，它们同在东经130度和南纬10度，这时船正沿着这纬度行驶。\n 1月13日，尼摩船长到了帝位海，在东经122度望见了跟海同名的帝文岛①。这岛面积为1，625平方里，由称为，‘拉夜，，的王公们统治。这些王公们自称为鳄鱼的子孙，就是说，他们的祖先是人类可能想到的最古的来源。所以。他们的带鳞甲的祖宗在岛上河流中大量繁殖，是人们特殊尊敬的对象。岛人保护它们，娇养它们，奉承它们，给它们食物，把青年女子作它们的食料，如果有外来客人，敢把手去动这些神圣的晰蝎类，那他就将惹下大祸了。\n 但诺第留斯号跟这些怪难看的动物并没有什么交道可打。帝位岛也只是在中午，船副记录方位的时候，出现了一下。同样，我也只望到了属于这群岛屿的罗地小岛，这岛上砌女人在马来亚市场③上被公认为有名的美人。\n 从这里起，诺第留斯号的方向，在纬度线上弯下来；向西南驶去。船头是向着印度洋。尼摩船长打算带我们到什么地方去呢？他又上溯回到亚洲侮岸去吗？他要走近欧洲海岸吗？他是要躲避有人居住的陆地吧，但从航行方向看，这也是不可能的。那么他要往南去吗？他要先过好望角，然后再过合恩角，向南极走去吗？最后，他又要回到太平洋中来，他的诺第留斯号在太平洋中航行方便自由吗？那只有将来才能使我知道。\n 既经走过了嘉地埃、依比尼亚、西林加巴当、斯各脱暗礁群，这是在海水中浮出的最后礁石了， 1月14 日 我们看不见陆地了。诺第留斯号的速度特别缓慢，好像非常任性，有时在水中走，有时又浮出水面来。\n 在这次航行当中，尼摩船长对于海中不同水层的各种温度，做了些很有兴味的实验。在一般情况下，这些温度的记录是利用相当复杂的器械来进行，但不论是使用温度表来探测（因玻璃管时常被水的压力压碎），或是使用通过电流的金属制成的仪器来探测，所得的结果总还是不很可靠小因为这样取得的结果无法校正。但尼摩船长就不同了，他自己亲身到海底下去探测各水层的温度，他的温度表跟各水层相接触，马上很准确地将得到的度数告诉他。是这惮的：诺第留斯号或者是把所有的储水池装得特别满，或用纵斜机板斜斜下降，就可以陆续达到三千、四千、五千、七千）九千、一万米的深度）这些实验最后肯定的结果是，不论任何纬度下的海水，在一千米下的深度，温度总是四度半，永远不变。\n 我兴趣很浓厚地看他做这种实验。尼摩船长对这种实验有一种真正的热情。我心中时常想，他做这些观察有什·么目的呢？是为人类的利益吗？这很不可能；因为，总有一天，他的工作要跟他一齐在没人知道的海中消灭！除非是他打算把他的实验结果交给我。这就是预先要肯定我的奇怪游历将有结束的期限，可是，这期限，我还没有看到。\n 不管怎样，船长同样又让我知道他所获得的各种数字。这些数字是关于地球上主要海洋海水密度的报告。从他给我的这个通知，我取得了不是关于科学的、而是关于个人的知识\n 这是 1月15日的早上，船长跟我一起在平台上散步，他问我是否知道各处海水的不同密度。我回答不知道，同、时又说，科学对于这个问题还没有做过精确的观察。\n “这些观察我做过了，”他对我说，“而且我可以肯定它们的准确性。”\n “很好，”我答，“不过诺第留斯号是另一个世界，这个性界的学者的‘秘密’不能传到陆地上。”\n “您说得对，教授，”他静默一刻后对我说，“它是另一个世界，它跟陆地不相干，就像陪着地球环绕太阳的各个行星对于地球上一样，从来也没有人知道土星和木垦中的学者们所做的工作。但是，既然偶然的机会把我们二人拉在一起，我可以把我观察所得的结果告诉您。”\n “我静听您的指教，船长。”\n “教授，您知道海水比淡水的密度大，但海水的密度并不是各处完全一律。比方，我拿‘一’作为淡水的密度，那太平洋海水的密度是一又千分之二十八，地中海的海水，一又千分之三十……”“啊：”我想，“他也冒险到地中海去吗？”\n ”爱奥尼亚海水是一又千分之十八，亚德里亚①海水是一又千分之二十九.\":\n 很显然，诺第留斯号并不逃避多人往来的欧洲海面，我因此可以说——或者不久——它要把我们带到比较文明的陆地海中去。我想尼德·兰听到这个特别消息，一定非常满意。在好几天内，我们长时间都在做各种各样的实验，研究不同深度水层的盐分含量，海水的感电作用，海水的染色作用，海水的透明传光作用。在所有这些情况中，尼摩船长处处显示出他的奇特才能，也处处都显示出他对我的好感。以后，在几天内，我看不见他了，我在他船上又像孤独的人一样了.\n l月16日， 诺第留斯号好像昏睡在海面下仅仅几米深的地方。船上的电力机械不走，机轮停着不动，让船随着海水游来游去。我心中想，船上船员恐怕正在作内部修理工作，由于机件的机械运动很激烈，修理是必要的。我的同伴和我，在这时亲眼看到一种很新奇的景象。客厅的嵌板敞开，由于诺第留斯号的探照灯没有点着，水中充满模模糊糊的阴暗。骚动的和遮满密云的天空照在海洋上部水层中的，是一种迷糊不足的光线。\n 我在这种条件下观察海中的情形，最粗大的鱼看来也就像模糊不清的阴影一样，这个时候，诺第留斯号忽然转入完全光明中了。我初时以为是探照灯亮起来，把电力的光辉照在海水中。其实我弄错了，经过很快的观察，我认识到我的看法的错误。\n 诺第留斯号浮游在一层磷光里面，在海水阴暗中，磷火也变得光辉夺目了。这光由无数的发光微生动物所产生，因为它们在金属板的船身上溜过，闪光就更加增强。这时，我在阵阵光明的水层中间，突然看到了这些闪光，好像熔在大火炉中的铅铁流一样，或跟烧到白热的金属块一样；由于对立作用，在这火红光下有些明亮的部分也变成阴影了。在这环境中间所有阴影好像都不应当存在。不！这不是我们通常的燃烧发光体的辐射光！在这光中有一种不平常的精力和运动！这光，人们感到它是生动的！活泼的！\n 是的，这是海中点滴微虫和粟粒夜光虫无穷无尽的集体的结合，是有细微触须的真正透明小胶球，在三十立方厘的水中，它们的数目可以有二万五千。又因为有水母、海盘、章鱼、海枣以及其他发光植虫动物（满浸被海水分解了的有机物体的泡沫，或满浸鱼类所分泌的粘液）特别产生的微光，它们的光更加增强。\n 诺第留斯号在这种光辉的海波中浮游了好几个钟头，我看见粗大的海中动物，像火蛇一样在那里游来游去，我赞美的情绪更高涨了。\n 我看见在那里，在那不发热的火光中间，有许多美观、迅速快走的海猪，这是跑来跑去、不感到疲乏的海中丑角，有许多长三米的剑鱼，它们是大风暴要来的先知者，它们的巨大剑锋时常碰在大厅的玻璃上。然后又出现了那些比较小的鱼类，各种形样的箭鱼，跳跃的鳍鱼，人头形样的狼鱼，以及成千成百的其他鱼类，它们奔跑的时候，在这失明的大气中，画成带子一样的条条的花纹。\n 这种光辉夺目的景象真是迷人心神的魔法！是不是空气中的一些变化使这种现象更为加强呢？是不是海波上面发生了风暴呢？不过在水下几米的深度，诺第留斯号并不感到风暴的怒吼，它和平地在安静的海水中摆来摆去。；\n 我们就是这样行驶着，不断为眼前伪新奇景象所陶醉。康塞尔仍在观察，他把他的植虫类、节肢类、软体类、鱼类等搬出来加以分类。日子过得很快，我简直不能计算了。尼德·兰照他的习惯，总想法子把船上日常的事物变换一下。我们是真正的蜗牛，在我们壳中住惯了，我同时又要肯定，成为一个完全的蜗牛也并不是很难的事。\n 因此，这种生活在我们觉得是很方便，很自然，我们并不想象在地球面上还有另一种不同的生活，就在这个时候，发生了一件事情，使我们觉得我们所处地位的离奇古怪。\n 1月18日，诺第留斯号到了东经105度和南纬15度的地方。天气很坏，海上险恶，多风浪。大凤猛烈地从东方吹来。风雨表好几天以来就下降了，预告不久将有暴风和雨——海水和空气的恶斗。\n 我在船副来测量角度的时候，走到平台上。我等待他照平常的习惯，说每日要说的那句话。可是，那天，这句话被另一句一样不可懂的话所替了。我立即看见尼摩船长出来，眼睛对着望远镜，向天边隙望。\n 在几分钟内，船长站住不动，不离开他目标内的那个点。一会儿，他把镜子放下，跟船副交换了十多句话。船副好像情绪很激动，没有法子抑制的样子。尼摩船长比较有主意，神气很冷静。他好像提出了些反对的意见，船副带着肯定明确的语气回答他。至少，我是从他们的口气和他们的姿势作这样的了解。至于我，也细心地注视他们所指的方向，什么也看不见。夭和水完全清楚地相交在一条水平线上。。\n 但是，尼摩船长在平台的两极端间走来走去，没有留心我，可能没有看见我。他的脚步很坚定，但没有平时一样的规律。他有时停住，两手交叉在胸前，观察大海。他要在这个浩瀚的空间中找些什么呢？诺第留斯号这时距最近的边岸也已经有好几百海里了！\n 船副又拿过望远镜来，固执地搜索着天际，走来走去，不停地跺脚，他神经质的激动跟船长的冷静正成一个对比。\n 此外，这个神秘必须弄清楚，并且要很快弄清楚，因为船上得到尼摩船长的命令，机器增加推动力，机器转动更快了。\n 这个时候，船副重新又要船长小心注意。船长停下脚步来，把望远镜向所指的夭边一点了望。他观察了很久。至于我，心里很是纳闷，也想知道一些，我走下客厅，在厅中拿了我常用的望远镜，回到平台，扶在平台前头的突出部分，装设探照灯的笼间上，我就要打算望一望天际和海边的所有情景了。\n 但我的眼睛还没有挨到镜面上，望远镜就突然被人夺走了。\n 我转过身来，尼摩船长站在我面前，我简直不认识他了，他的面容完全变了。他的眼睛闪着阴沉的火光，从紧促的睫毛中露出来。他的牙齿半露，有些可怕。他直挺的身子，紧握的拳头，缩在两肩肿间的脑袋，证明他有了正从他全身发出来的强烈的仇恨。他站着不动。我的望远镜从他的手中掉下来，滚到他脚边。\n 是我无心引起了他的这种愤怒神气吗？是这个神秘不可解的人物认为我看出了诺第留斯号的客人不应当知道的某些秘密吗？\n 不！这仇恨的对象并不是我，因为他并不看我，因为他的眼睛仍然坚定不移地盯着夭际神秘不可知的那一点。\n 后来尼摩船长又有了主意，镇定下来。他的脸孔本来是变了样的，现在又跟从前一样地安静下来。他用神秘语言对船副说了几句活，然后转身面向着我。\n “阿龙纳斯先生，”他语气相当激动地对我说，“我要您遵守您跟我约定的那一条款。”\n “船长，是哪一条款呢？”\n “您的同伴和您现在都要关起来，直到我认为可以让你们自由的时候为止。”\n “您是主人，”我眼盯着他回答，“我可以向您提一个问题吗？”\n “不，先生。”\n 听了这活，我没有可争论的，只有服从了，因为所有的抗拒都是不可能的。\n 我走到尼德·兰和康塞尔所住的舱房中，告诉他们船长所作的决定。读者可以想象加拿大人得到这消息时是怎样情形。此外，我们也没有时间对这事作解释。四个船员早就等在门口，他们领我们到我们第一夜在诺第留斯号船上住过的那个房间里。\n 尼德·兰想质问，但他一进来，门就关上了，当然也得不到回答。\n “先生可以给我说明这是什么意思吗？”康塞尔问我。\n 我把事情的经过告诉了我的同伴。他们跟我一样惊奇，但也一样得不到解释。\n 同时，我作了无穷无尽的思考，尼摩船长面容上所有的那种奇异疑虑老是在我思想中纠缠着，解脱不开。我简直不能把两个合理的观念结合起来，我迷在最荒谬无理的假设中，这个时候，我被尼德·兰的下面一句话惊醒，从苦心思索中解脱出来了。他说：\n ‘瞧！午餐端来了！”\n 可不是，饭桌上都摆好了。显然是尼摩船长下了开饭的命令，同时他加大诺第留斯号的速度。\n “先生答应我说句劝告的话吗？”康塞尔问我。\n “你可以说，老好人。”我回答。\n “就是请先生快用饭！这样比较妥当些，因为我们不切道会发生些什么事呢.\"\n “你说得对，康塞尔。，\n “很可惜，”尼德·兰说，“人们只 给我吃船上的菜.\"\n “尼德好朋友，”康塞尔回答，“如果午餐完全没有，你又将怎样呢？”\n 这话把鱼叉手所有的恶骂都打断了。\n 我们坐在桌前吃饭，吃饭的时候大家都不大说话。我吃得很少。康塞尔因为一向谨慎，“勉强”吃。尼德。兰虽然不乐意，但嘴一下也没有停。午餐吃完后，我们各自靠着各人的座位。\n 这个时候，照亮这房间的光明球熄灭了，我们在漆一般的黑暗中。尼德·兰不久就睡着了，使我惊异的是，康塞尔也昏沉沉地人睡了。我心中正想他为什么这样迫切需要睡眠的时候，我感觉到自己的头脑也昏沉沉地麻痹起来了。我的两眼，我想睁着，但不由己地闭上了。一种错觉紊绕着我，使我感到不适。很显然，我们吃的饭里面杂了些安眠药。那真是要使我们不知道尼摩船长的计划，关起我们来不够，又要让我们好好安睡呢！\n 我听到嵌板关起来了。使入觉得微微转动的大海波动现在也停止了。那诺第留斯号是离开了洋面吗？它是回到了静止不动的水底下吗？\n 我要抗拒睡眠，两眼睁着。但不可能，我的呼吸逐渐细微了。我觉得一种厉害的冰冷冻住了我的沉重肢体，像瘫痪了的一样。我的眼皮变为真正的铅铁盖，盖住我的眼睛。我再也不能睁开了。一种病态的、满是错觉的昏睡侵占了我整个的身体。、不久，幻影隐没不见，我进入了完全的沉睡中。\n \n
