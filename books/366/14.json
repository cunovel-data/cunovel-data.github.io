{"id":13869,"no":14,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 14","content":"THE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at 3,832,558 square myriameters, hence more than 38,000,000,000 hectares. This liquid mass totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could form a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues, whose weight would be three quintillion metric tons. To appreciate such a number, we should remember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion is to one, in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as ones in a billion! Now then, this liquid mass nearly equals the total amount of water that has poured through all the earth\u0027s rivers for the past 40,000 years!\n During prehistoric times, an era of fire was followed by an era of water. At first there was ocean everywhere. Then, during the Silurian period, the tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves, islands emerged, disappeared beneath temporary floods, rose again, were fused to form continents, and finally the earth\u0027s geography settled into what we have today. Solid matter had wrested from liquid matter some 37,657,000 square miles, hence 12,916,000,000 hectares.\n The outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided into five major parts: the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.\n The Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles and east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of 145 degrees of longitude. It\u0027s the most tranquil of the seas; its currents are wide and slow-moving, its tides moderate, its rainfall abundant. And this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross under these strangest of auspices.\n \"If you don\u0027t mind, professor,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"we\u0027ll determine our exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage. It\u0027s fifteen minutes before noon. I\u0027m going to rise to the surface of the water.\"\n The captain pressed an electric bell three times. The pumps began to expel water from the ballast tanks; on the pressure gauge, a needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus\u0027s upward progress; then the needle stopped.\n \"Here we are,\" the captain said.\n I made my way to the central companionway, which led to the platform. I climbed its metal steps, passed through the open hatches, and arrived topside on the Nautilus.\n The platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves. The Nautilus\u0027s bow and stern boasted that spindle-shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar. I noted the slight overlap of its sheet-iron plates, which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles. So I had a perfectly natural explanation for why, despite the best spyglasses, this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal.\n Near the middle of the platform, the skiff was half set in the ship\u0027s hull, making a slight bulge. Fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height, their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass, one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus, the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way.\n The sea was magnificent, the skies clear. This long aquatic vehicle could barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean. A mild breeze out of the east rippled the surface of the water. Free of all mist, the horizon was ideal for taking sights.\n There was nothing to be seen. Not a reef, not an islet. No more Abraham Lincoln. A deserted immenseness.\n Raising his sextant, Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun, which would give him his latitude. He waited for a few minutes until the orb touched the rim of the horizon. While he was taking his sights, he didn\u0027t move a muscle, and the instrument couldn\u0027t have been steadier in hands made out of marble.\n \"Noon,\" he said. \"Professor, whenever you\u0027re ready. . . .\"\n I took one last look at the sea, a little yellowish near the landing places of Japan, and I went below again to the main lounge.\n There the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to calculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his previous observations of hour angles. Then he told me:\n \"Professor Aronnax, we\u0027re in longitude 137 degrees 15\u0027 west--\"\n \"West of which meridian?\" I asked quickly, hoping the captain\u0027s reply might give me a clue to his nationality.\n \"Sir,\" he answered me, \"I have chronometers variously set to the meridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor, I\u0027ll use the one for Paris.\"\n This reply told me nothing. I bowed, and the commander went on:\n \"We\u0027re in longitude 137 degrees 15\u0027 west of the meridian of Paris, and latitude 30 degrees 7\u0027 north, in other words, about 300 miles from the shores of Japan. At noon on this day of November 8, we hereby begin our voyage of exploration under the waters.\"\n \"May God be with us!\" I replied.\n \"And now, professor,\" the captain added, \"I\u0027ll leave you to your intellectual pursuits. I\u0027ve set our course east-northeast at a depth of fifty meters. Here are some large-scale charts on which you\u0027ll be able to follow that course. The lounge is at your disposal, and with your permission, I\u0027ll take my leave.\"\n Captain Nemo bowed. I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts. They all centered on the Nautilus\u0027s commander. Would I ever learn the nationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none? His sworn hate for humanity, a hate that perhaps was bent on some dreadful revenge--what had provoked it? Was he one of those unappreciated scholars, one of those geniuses \"embittered by the world,\" as Conseil expressed it, a latter-day Galileo, or maybe one of those men of science, like America\u0027s Commander Maury, whose careers were ruined by political revolutions? I couldn\u0027t say yet. As for me, whom fate had just brought aboard his vessel, whose life he had held in the balance: he had received me coolly but hospitably. Only, he never took the hand I extended to him. He never extended his own.\n For an entire hour I was deep in these musings, trying to probe this mystery that fascinated me so. Then my eyes focused on a huge world map displayed on the table, and I put my finger on the very spot where our just-determined longitude and latitude intersected.\n Like the continents, the sea has its rivers. These are exclusive currents that can be identified by their temperature and color, the most remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream. Science has defined the global paths of five chief currents: one in the north Atlantic, a second in the south Atlantic, a third in the north Pacific, a fourth in the south Pacific, and a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean. Also it\u0027s likely that a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up with certain large Asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of water.\n Now then, at the spot indicated on the world map, one of these seagoing rivers was rolling by, the Kuroshio of the Japanese, the Black Current: heated by perpendicular rays from the tropical sun, it leaves the Bay of Bengal, crosses the Strait of Malacca, goes up the shores of Asia, and curves into the north Pacific as far as the Aleutian Islands, carrying along trunks of camphor trees and other local items, the pure indigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting with the ocean\u0027s waves. It was this current the Nautilus was about to cross. I watched it on the map with my eyes, I saw it lose itself in the immenseness of the Pacific, and I felt myself swept along with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway.\n My two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the wonders on display.\n \"Where are we?\" the Canadian exclaimed. \"In the Quebec Museum?\"\n \"Begging master\u0027s pardon,\" Conseil answered, \"but this seems more like the Sommerard artifacts exhibition!\"\n \"My friends,\" I replied, signaling them to enter, \"you\u0027re in neither Canada nor France, but securely aboard the Nautilus, fifty meters below sea level.\"\n \"If master says so, then so be it,\" Conseil answered. \"But in all honesty, this lounge is enough to astonish even someone Flemish like myself.\"\n \"Indulge your astonishment, my friend, and have a look, because there\u0027s plenty of work here for a classifier of your talents.\"\n Conseil needed no encouraging. Bending over the glass cases, the gallant lad was already muttering choice words from the naturalist\u0027s vocabulary: class Gastropoda, family Buccinoidea, genus cowry, species Cypraea madagascariensis, etc.\n Meanwhile Ned Land, less dedicated to conchology, questioned me about my interview with Captain Nemo. Had I discovered who he was, where he came from, where he was heading, how deep he was taking us? In short, a thousand questions I had no time to answer.\n I told him everything I knew--or, rather, everything I didn\u0027t know-- and I asked him what he had seen or heard on his part.\n \"Haven\u0027t seen or heard a thing!\" the Canadian replied. \"I haven\u0027t even spotted the crew of this boat. By any chance, could they be electric too?\"\n \"Electric?\"\n \"Oh ye gods, I\u0027m half tempted to believe it! But back to you, Professor Aronnax,\" Ned Land said, still hanging on to his ideas. \"Can\u0027t you tell me how many men are on board? Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?\"\n \"I\u0027m unable to answer you, Mr. Land. And trust me on this: for the time being, get rid of these notions of taking over the Nautilus or escaping from it. This boat is a masterpiece of modern technology, and I\u0027d be sorry to have missed it! Many people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us, just to walk in the midst of these wonders. So keep calm, and let\u0027s see what\u0027s happening around us.\"\n \"See!\" the harpooner exclaimed. \"There\u0027s nothing to see, nothing we\u0027ll ever see from this sheet-iron prison! We\u0027re simply running around blindfolded--\"\n Ned Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly plunged into darkness, utter darkness. The ceiling lights went out so quickly, my eyes literally ached, just as if we had experienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest sunlight.\n We stood stock-still, not knowing what surprise was waiting for us, whether pleasant or unpleasant. But a sliding sound became audible. You could tell that some panels were shifting over the Nautilus\u0027s sides.\n \"It\u0027s the beginning of the end!\" Ned Land said.\n \". . . order Hydromedusa,\" Conseil muttered.\n Suddenly, through two oblong openings, daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge. The liquid masses came into view, brightly lit by the ship\u0027s electric outpourings. We were separated from the sea by two panes of glass. Initially I shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break; but strong copper bands secured them, giving them nearly infinite resistance.\n The sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around the Nautilus. What a sight! What pen could describe it? Who could portray the effects of this light through these translucent sheets of water, the subtlety of its progressive shadings into the ocean\u0027s upper and lower strata?\n The transparency of salt water has long been recognized. Its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water. The mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency. In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea, you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down, and the penetrating power of the sun\u0027s rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters. But in this fluid setting traveled by the Nautilus, our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves. It was no longer illuminated water, it was liquid light.\n If we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms--nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea, and I could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light. On both sides I had windows opening over these unexplored depths. The darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside, and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium.\n The Nautilus seemed to be standing still. This was due to the lack of landmarks. But streaks of water, parted by the ship\u0027s spur, sometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed.\n In wonderment, we leaned on our elbows before these show windows, and our stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said:\n \"You wanted to see something, Ned my friend; well, now you have something to see!\"\n \"How unusual!\" the Canadian put in, setting aside his tantrums and getaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure. \"A man would go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight!\"\n \"Ah!\" I exclaimed. \"I see our captain\u0027s way of life! He\u0027s found himself a separate world that saves its most astonishing wonders just for him!\"\n \"But where are the fish?\" the Canadian ventured to observe. \"I don\u0027t see any fish!\"\n \"Why would you care, Ned my friend?\" Conseil replied. \"Since you have no knowledge of them.\"\n \"Me? A fisherman!\" Ned Land exclaimed.\n And on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends, since both were knowledgeable about fish, but from totally different standpoints.\n Everyone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in the vertebrate branch. They have been quite aptly defined as: \"cold-blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system, breathing through gills, and designed to live in water.\" They consist of two distinct series: the series of bony fish, in other words, those whose spines have vertebrae made of bone; and cartilaginous fish, in other words, those whose spines have vertebrae made of cartilage.\n Possibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction, but Conseil knew far more about it; and since he and Ned were now fast friends, he just had to show off. So he told the harpooner:\n \"Ned my friend, you\u0027re a slayer of fish, a highly skilled fisherman. You\u0027ve caught a large number of these fascinating animals. But I\u0027ll bet you don\u0027t know how they\u0027re classified.\"\n \"Sure I do,\" the harpooner replied in all seriousness. \"They\u0027re classified into fish we eat and fish we don\u0027t eat!\"\n \"Spoken like a true glutton,\" Conseil replied. \"But tell me, are you familiar with the differences between bony fish and cartilaginous fish?\"\n \"Just maybe, Conseil.\"\n \"And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t the foggiest notion,\" the Canadian replied.\n \"All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend! Bony fish are subdivided into six orders. Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is fully formed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a comb. This order consists of fifteen families, in other words, three-quarters of all known fish. Example: the common perch.\"\n \"Pretty fair eating,\" Ned Land replied.\n \"Secundo,\" Conseil went on, \"the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang under the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren\u0027t attached to the shoulder bone, an order that\u0027s divided into five families and makes up the great majority of freshwater fish. Examples: carp, pike.\"\n \"Ugh!\" the Canadian put in with distinct scorn. \"You can keep the freshwater fish!\"\n \"Tertio,\" Conseil said, \"the subbrachians, whose pelvic fins are attached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder bone. This order contains four families. Examples: flatfish such as sole, turbot, dab, plaice, brill, etc.\"\n \"Excellent, really excellent!\" the harpooner exclaimed, interested in fish only from an edible viewpoint.\n \"Quarto,\" Conseil went on, unabashed, \"the apods, with long bodies that lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy, often glutinous skin, an order consisting of only one family. Examples: common eels and electric eels.\"\n \"So-so, just so-so!\" Ned Land replied.\n \"Quinto,\" Conseil said, \"the lophobranchians, which have fully formed, free-moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged in pairs along their gill arches. This order includes only one family. Examples: seahorses and dragonfish.\"\n \"Bad, very bad!\" the harpooner replied.\n \"Sexto and last,\" Conseil said, \"the plectognaths, whose maxillary bone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms the jaw, and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures that render the jaw immovable, an order lacking true pelvic fins and which consists of two families. Examples: puffers and moonfish.\"\n \"They\u0027re an insult to a frying pan!\" the Canadian exclaimed.\n \"Are you grasping all this, Ned my friend?\" asked the scholarly Conseil.\n \"Not a lick of it, Conseil my friend,\" the harpooner replied. \"But keep going, because you fill me with fascination.\"\n \"As for cartilaginous fish,\" Conseil went on unflappably, \"they consist of only three orders.\"\n \"Good news,\" Ned put in.\n \"Primo, the cyclostomes, whose jaws are fused into a flexible ring and whose gill openings are simply a large number of holes, an order consisting of only one family. Example: the lamprey.\"\n \"An acquired taste,\" Ned Land replied.\n \"Secundo, the selacians, with gills resembling those of the cyclostomes but whose lower jaw is free-moving. This order, which is the most important in the class, consists of two families. Examples: the ray and the shark.\"\n \"What!\" Ned Land exclaimed. \"Rays and man-eaters in the same order? Well, Conseil my friend, on behalf of the rays, I wouldn\u0027t advise you to put them in the same fish tank!\"\n \"Tertio,\" Conseil replied, \"The sturionians, whose gill opening is the usual single slit adorned with a gill cover, an order consisting of four genera. Example: the sturgeon.\"\n \"Ah, Conseil my friend, you saved the best for last, in my opinion anyhow! And that\u0027s all of \u0027em?\"\n \"Yes, my gallant Ned,\" Conseil replied. \"And note well, even when one has grasped all this, one still knows next to nothing, because these families are subdivided into genera, subgenera, species, varieties--\"\n \"All right, Conseil my friend,\" the harpooner said, leaning toward the glass panel, \"here come a couple of your varieties now!\"\n \"Yes! Fish!\" Conseil exclaimed. \"One would think he was in front of an aquarium!\"\n \"No,\" I replied, \"because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage, and these fish are as free as birds in the air!\"\n \"Well, Conseil my friend, identify them! Start naming them!\" Ned Land exclaimed.\n \"Me?\" Conseil replied. \"I\u0027m unable to! That\u0027s my employer\u0027s bailiwick!\"\n And in truth, although the fine lad was a classifying maniac, he was no naturalist, and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna. In short, he was the exact opposite of the Canadian, who knew nothing about classification but could instantly put a name to any fish.\n \"A triggerfish,\" I said.\n \"It\u0027s a Chinese triggerfish,\" Ned Land replied.\n \"Genus Balistes, family Scleroderma, order Plectognatha,\" Conseil muttered.\n Assuredly, Ned and Conseil in combination added up to one outstanding naturalist.\n The Canadian was not mistaken. Cavorting around the Nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies, grainy skins, armed with stings on their dorsal fins, and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails. Nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them: white underneath, gray above, with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves. Around them, rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind, and among these I spotted, much to my glee, a Chinese ray, yellowish on its topside, a dainty pink on its belly, and armed with three stings behind its eyes; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in Lacépède\u0027s day, since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of Japanese drawings.\n For two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus. In the midst of their leaping and cavorting, while they competed with each other in beauty, radiance, and speed, I could distinguish some green wrasse, bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines, white gobies from the genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back, wonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue bodies and silver heads, glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description, several varieties of porgy or gilthead (some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow, some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area, some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands), trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long, Japanese salamanders, serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; etc.\n Our wonderment stayed at an all-time fever pitch. Our exclamations were endless. Ned identified the fish, Conseil classified them, and as for me, I was in ecstasy over the verve of their movements and the beauty of their forms. Never before had I been given the chance to glimpse these animals alive and at large in their native element.\n Given such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China, I won\u0027t mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes. More numerous than birds in the air, these fish raced right up to us, no doubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon.\n Suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge. The sheet-iron panels slid shut. The magical vision disappeared. But for a good while I kept dreaming away, until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments hanging on the wall. The compass still showed our heading as east-northeast, the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five atmospheres (corresponding to a depth of fifty meters), and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour.\n I waited for Captain Nemo. But he didn\u0027t appear. The clock marked the hour of five.\n Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin. As for me, I repaired to my stateroom. There I found dinner ready for me. It consisted of turtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill, a red mullet with white, slightly flaky flesh, whose liver, when separately prepared, makes delicious eating, plus loin of imperial angelfish, whose flavor struck me as even better than salmon.\n I spent the evening in reading, writing, and thinking. Then drowsiness overtook me, I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress, and I fell into a deep slumber, while the Nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing Black Current.\n 地球上海水占的面积共计为三百八十三亿二千五百五十八万平方公里②。海水的体积共有二十二亿五千万立方米，它可以成为一个圆球，这圆球的直径为六十里，重量为三百亿亿吨。想了解上面这个数目，必须设想这个数目对十亿之比，同于十亿对单位之比，即是说，在这个数目中所有的十亿数，等于十亿中所有的单位数。而这个数目的海水也就等于地上所有的河流在四万年中所流下来的水量。\n 在地质学的纪元中，火的时期之后为水的时期。首先，处处都是海洋。“然后，在初期志留纪中，山峰渐渐露出来了，岛屿浮现，又在部分发生的洪水下隐没，重又现出，连接起来，构成大陆，最后，陆地才固定为地理上的各大陆，跟我们今天所看见的一般。固体大陆从流体海水所取得的面积为三千七百万零六百五十七平方英里，即一千二百九十一万六千公亩。\n 地球上各大陆形状不同，把海水分为五大部分，即，北冰洋，南冰洋，印度洋；大西洋和太平洋.\n 太平洋从北至南，是在南北两极之间，从西至东，是在亚洲和美洲之间，共有经度145度的宽广。 太平洋是最平静的海，海潮阔大缓慢，潮水中常，雨量丰富。我的命运要我在最奇异的情况下首先走过的，就是这个海洋。\n “教授，”尼摩船长对我说，“如果您高兴，我们先明确地记下我们现在的方位，决定这次旅行的出发点。现在时间是正午差一刻“我现在叫船浮上水面来。”\n 船长按了三次电铃；抽水机开始把储水他的水排出，气压表上的针从不同的气压度数，指出诺第留斯号的上升运动，后来船停住了。\n 船长说：“我们到了。\n 我走上通到平台去的中央梯子；我踏上一层一层的钢铁梯级，从打开的铁盖板，到了诺第雷斯号的上面部分。\n 平台仅仅浮出水面八十厘米。诺第留斯号前头和后部现出象纺锤形状，正好比一根长雪茄烟。我看到船身上的钢板，彼此稍微的鳞次着，很像地上大爬虫类动物身上所有的鳞甲。所以我很自然地明白了，即使有最好的望远镜，这船总会被认为是一只海中动物。\n 约在平台中间,有那只半藏在船壳中的小艇,好象是一个微微突出的瘤。在平台前后，各装上一个不很高的笼间、向侧边倾斜，一部分装着很厚的凹凸玻璃镜：这两个笼间卜一个作为诺第留斯号领航人之用，另一个装着强力的电灯，光芒四射，探照航路。\n 海上风平浪静，天空清朗无云。长长的船身差不多感不到海洋的阔大波动。一阵轻微的东风吹皱了洋面。夭惭全无烟雾，可以望得很远。\n 我们望不见什么。望不见暗礁，望不见小岛。林肯号不见了；望见的只是一片汪洋的海水。\n 尼摩船长带了他的六分仪，测量太阳的高度，因此可以。知道船所在的纬度。他等待了几分钟，让太阳跟地平线相：齐。当他观察的时候，他的肌肉没有一处颜动，仪器也像握：在铁石的手中一般，绝对平稳。\n “正午，”他说，“教授，您要我们这时出发吗？”\n 我最后看一下海面，因为靠近日本海岸，海面微作努色，然后我回到客厅中来。\n 客厅中，船长在地图上记了方位，按合时计来算经度卜同时他拿从前做的“时角”观察记录来校对。然后他对我说：\n “阿龙纳斯先生，我们是在西经137度15分……”\n “您根据哪种子午线算的呢？”我急急地问，想从船长的回答中知道他的国籍。\n “先生，”他答复我，“我有各种不同的时计，可以根据巴黎、格林威治和华盛顿子午线来计算。但因为您的关系，我以后将根据巴黎子午线计算.\"\n 这个回答使我得不到什么。我点头表示谢意，船长又说：\n “我们在巴黎子午线西经137度15分，北纬30度7分，即是说，距日本海岸约为三百海里。今天11月8日，中午，我们开始作我们的海底探险旅行。”\n “愿上帝保佑我们！”我答。\n \"教授， ”船长又说，“我现在让您做您的研究。我要船在水深五十米下，向东北偏东方行驶。这里有标记分明的地图，您可以看着我们的航行路线。客厅您可以随便使用，我向您告辞了。”\n 尼摩船长对我行个礼，出去了。我一人留下，默默地沉思。所想的都是关于这位诺第留斯号的船长。这个古怪的人，自以为不属于任何国籍，我将永远不知道他是哪一国的人吗？他对于人类的那种仇恨，或者他对于使他有那种仇恨的人，要想法作可怕的报复吗？他是不是像康塞尔说的，“有人给他受过痛苦的”一位被人轻视的学者，一位天才，一位近代的伽利略①呢？或者他是一位科学家，像美国人莫利一般）学术研究事业因为政治上的变动受到挫折呢？这我都还不能说。我是由于偶然的机会被抛在他船上的人，我的生命操在他手中，他冷淡地，但客气地收留了我。不过他从不握我伸出去的手，他也从不将他的手伸出来。\n 整整一个小时，我浸沉在深深的思虑中，总想明了这使我十分感兴味的秘密。后来我的眼光盯着摆在桌上的平面大地图，我就把手指放在上面所指出的经纬度相交的那点.\n 海洋跟大陆一样，也有江河。这些江河是特殊的水流，从它们的温度、它们的颜色，可以辨认出来，其中最显著的是大家所知道的“暖流”。科学决定了在地球上有下面的五条主要水流路线：第一条在大西洋北部，第二条在大西洋南部，第三条在太平洋北部，第四条在太平洋南部，第五条在印度洋南部。很可能在印度洋北部从前有第六条水流存在，那个时候，里海和阿拉伯海还跟亚洲的各大湖连起来，成为一片大海。\n 正是，在平面地图上记下的那个点，展开了上面说的一条暖流，日本人叫做黑水流①，黑水流从孟加拉湾出来，受热带太阳光线的直射，很为温暖，横过马六甲海峡，沿着亚洲海岸前进，人太平洋北部作环弯形，直到阿留地安群岛。它将樟脑树干和各地方的各样土产输送出去，它的暖流的纯靛蓝色跟大洋的水流显然分开。诺第留斯号要走的就是这条水流。我两眼盯着它，我看见它抿没在太平洋的无边水际中；我正感到自己跟水流一齐奔驰的时候，尼德·兰和康塞尔在客厅门口出现了。\n 我的两个老实同伴看见堆在他们眼前的神奇物品，惊怪得发楞了：\n “我们在什么地方呢？我们在什么地方呢？”加拿大人喊，“我们在魁北克博物馆吗？”\n “如果先生认为可以，”康塞尔答，“还不如说这是桑美拉大厦呢！”\n “朋友们，”我回答，我同时做个手势，让他们进来，“你们不是在加拿大，也不是在法兰西，而是在诺第留斯号船上，在海底下五十米。”\n “当然要相信先生的话，因为先生这样肯定了。”康塞尔回答，“老实说，这个客厅，就是让我这个佛兰蒙人看来也要惊奇.\"\n “朋友，你惊奇吧，你好好地看吧，因为对于你这么能干的一个分类者，这里实在有不少的工作可做哩。”\n 我并不需要鼓励康塞尔去做。这个老实人早就弯身在“玻璃柜子上，嘴里已经低声说出生物学家所用的词汇：腹足纲，油螺科，磁贝属，马达加斯加介蛤种，等等……\n 这个时候。尼德·兰——他不是贝类学家——问我关于我跟尼摩船长会谈的情形。他问我，我是否发现他是哪一国人，他从哪里来，到哪里去，把我们拉到多少深的海底去？他问了许多问题，我简直来不及回答他。\n 我将我所知道的全部告诉他，或不如说，将我所不知道的全部告诉他。我又问他，他看到些什么或听到些什么。\n “什么也没有看见，什么也没有听到!\"加拿大人回答，“我甚至于连这船上的人员的影子也没有看见。真的，是不是他们都是电人？”\n “电人！”\n “说真的，我是要这样想呢。可是您，阿龙纳靳先生，”尼德·兰问，他总是不忘记他的那个念头，“您不能告诉我这船上一共有多少人吗？十人，二十人，五十人，一百人吗？”\n “尼德·兰师傅，这我可不能回答您。而且您要相信我，此刻您必须抛弃您那夺取或逃出诺第留斯号的念头。这船是现代工业的杰作，我如果没有看见它，我不知要怎么惋惜呢！许多人，只为能看看这些神奇事物，也就乐意接受我们的处境了。所以您必须保持镇静，我们想法观看我们周围所有的事物。”\n “观看！”鱼叉手喊，“除了这钢板的监牢，我们看不见什么，我们将来也看不见什么！我们就是跑，我们就是盲目行驶……”\n 当尼德·兰说最后这句话的时候，忽然全厅黑了，这是绝对的黑暗。明亮的天花板熄灭了，并且熄灭得十分快，使我的眼睛发生一种疼痛的感觉，跟在相反的情形中，即从漆一般的黑暗中忽见最辉煌的光明所发生的感觉一样。\n 我们都默不作声，动也不敢动，不知道有什么是福是祸的意外事件等着我们。我们听到一种滑走的声音。简直要使人认为是盖板在诺第留斯号的两侧动起来了。\n “现在一切真要完蛋了！”尼德·兰说。\n \"水母目！”康塞尔低声说。\n 忽然，光线穿过两个长方形的孔洞，从容厅的备方面射进。海水受电光的照耀，通体明亮地显现出来。两块玻璃晶片把我们和海水分开。初时我想到这种脆弱的隔板可能碎裂，心中害怕得发抖；但由于有红铜的结实框架顶住，使它差不多有无限的抵抗力。\n 在诺第留斯号周围一海里内的海水，现在都可以清楚’地看见。多么光怪陆离的景象呵！无论多么高明的妙笔也描写不出来！谁能描绘光线穿过透明的水流所产生的新奇景色呢守谁能描绘那光线照在海洋上下两方，渐次递减的柔和光度呢！\n 我们认得海洋的透明性，我们知道海水的清澈超过山间清泉。海水中所含有的矿物质和有机物质，甚至于可队增加它的透明性。在太平洋中的某部分，例如在安的列斯群岛，一百四十五米深的海水可以让人看见水底下面的沙床，十分清澈，而阳光的照射力好像直至三百米的深度方才停止。但是，在诺第留斯号所走过的海水中，电光就在水波：中间照耀。这不是明亮的水，而是流动的光了。\n 如果我们承认爱兰伯①的假设，认为海底是有辉煌的磷光照耀的，那么，大自然一定给海中的居民保留下一种最出奇的景象，我现在看见这种光的无穷变化，就可以想到这景象是多么美丽。客厅每边都有窗户开向这未曾经过探测的深渊。厅中的黑暗愈显出外面的光辉，我们细看，好像这片纯晶体，真就是那大到了不得的养鱼缸的玻璃一样。\n 诺第留斯号好像是不动了，这是因为水中没有标炽盼缘故。可是，时时有那些船头冲角分开的水线纹，在我们眼前迅速地向后掠过。\n 我们简直心醉神迷了，时靠在玻璃窗面前，我们谁都还。没有打破这由于惊怪发怔所引起的静默。此时康塞尔说:\n “尼德·兰朋友，您不是要看吗？现在您看吧!\"\n “真新鲜！真新鲜！”加拿大人说，他忘记了他的愤怒和他的逃走计划，受到一种不可抗拒的诱惑，“我们要从更远更远的地方走来赞美欣赏这景象哩！”\n “啊！”我喊道，“我现在明白这个人的生活了！他自己另外造了一个世界，给他保留下最惊人的神奇！”“可是鱼在哪里呢？”加拿大人说，“我看不到鱼呀！”\n “尼德·兰好朋友，”康塞尔回答，“那没有关系呀，因为\n 您不认识它们哩。”\n “我不认识鱼!我这打鱼的人！”尼德·兰喊道。\n 关于这个问题，他们两个朋友间发生了争论，因为他们都认识，但认识的方式不同。\n 大家知道鱼类是脊推动物门中的第四纲和最后一纲。鱼类的确切定义是：“有双重循环作用的，冷血的，用鳃呼吸的，生活在水中的脊椎动物”。鱼类由不同的两类构成：硬骨鱼类一即脊骨是硬骨脊椎——和软骨鱼类——即脊骨是软骨脊椎。\n 加拿大人也许懂得这种区别，但康塞尔知道的就更多，现在他跟尼德。兰有了友谊，大家很要好，他不能承认自己的知识比尼德·兰差，所以他这样说:\n “尼德·兰老朋友，不错，您是千个打鱼手，一个很能干的渔夫。您曾经捕捉过许多这些很有趣味的动物。不过我可以跟您打赌，您不知道人们怎样把它们分类。”\n “我知道，”鱼叉手很正经地回答，“人们把它们分为可吃的鱼类和不可吃的鱼类！”\n “这是讲究吃喝的人的一种分类法，”康塞尔回答，“请您告诉我，您知道硬骨鱼类和软骨鱼类之间存在的差别吗?\"\n “康塞尔，我可能知道.\"\n “您知道这两大组鱼类的小分类吗\"\n “我想我不至于不知道。”加拿大人回答。\n “尼德·兰老朋友，好吧，请您听我说，情您好好地记下来吧！硬骨鱼类可分为六目。第一目是硬鳍鱼，上鳃是完：整的，能动的，鳃作梳子形。这一目共有十五科，就是说，包。括已经知道的鱼类的四分之三。这目的类型是：普通鲫鱼。”\n “相当好吃的鱼。”尼德。兰回答。\n 康塞尔又说：“第二目是腹鳍鱼，腹鳍是垂在肚腹下面和在胸绪后边，而不是长在肩骨上；这一目分为五科，包括大部分的淡水鱼。这目的类型是：鲤鱼、雄鱼。”\n “呸！”加拿大人带着看不起的神气说，“淡水鱼！”\n “第三目是副鳍鱼，”康塞尔说，”腹鳍是接在胸鳝的下面和挂在肩骨上。这一目共有四科。类型是：蝶鱼、比目鱼、鞋底鱼、大比目鱼等。”\n “美味好吃的鱼！美味好吃的鱼！”鱼叉手喊，他只是从口味的观点来看鱼类。\n “第四目是无腹鳍鱼，”康塞尔兴致丝毫不减地又说，“鱼身很长，没有腹鳍，身上有很厚的带粘性的皮；这一目只。有一科。类型是：鳝鱼、鳗鱼、电鳗鱼。”““味道平常！味道平常!尼德.兰答。\n “第五目是总鳃鱼、康塞尔说，“鳃是完全的和自由的，但由许多小刷子构成，一对一对地排在鳃环节上。这一目只有一科。类型是：海马鱼、龙马鱼。”\n “不好吃！不好吃！”鱼叉手回答。\n 康塞尔说：“最后第六目是固颚鱼，颚骨是固定在齿颚的颚间骨边上，上颚的拱形骨跟头盖骨缝连接在一起，因而！固定不动，这一目没有真正的腹鳍，共有两科。类型是：魄鱼、银鳗。”\n “这些鱼，用锅来煮，锅也丢脸！”加拿大人喊道。\n “尼德·兰老朋友，您明白了吗？”博学的康塞尔问。\n “一点也不明白，康塞尔老朋友，”鱼叉手回答，“请您说下去，因为您对这很感兴趣。”\n “至于软骨鱼类，”康塞尔很冷静地又说，“那就只有三目.\"\n “这更省事了。”尼德·兰说。\n “第一目，圆口鱼，鳃合成为一个转动的圈环，鱼鳃开合有许多小孔，这一目只有一科。类型：人目鳗。”这鱼，我们很喜欢吃。”尼德·兰回答。\n “第二目，峻鱼，它的鳃类似圆口鱼的鳃，但下鳃活动。这一目是软骨鱼类中最重要的，共有两科。类型：鲨鱼、鳃鱼.\"\n “什么!\"尼德·兰喊道，“鲨鱼和鳃鱼是在同一目中，康塞尔老朋友，好哇，为鳃鱼的利益起见，我劝您不要把它们放在一个鱼缸里吧！”\n 康塞尔回答：“第三目：鳍鱼，鳃跟平常的千样，只由一个有盖的孔开会；这一目有四科。类型：磺鱼。”\n “啊！康塞尔好朋友，您把最好吃的放在最后了——至少我的意见是这样。现在您的话完了吗？”\n “是的，完了，尼德·兰好朋友，不过您得注意，就是知道了这些，仍是一无所知，因为科又分为属，属又分为亚属，为种，为变种……”“…\n “好哇，康塞尔好朋友，”鱼叉手俯身到玻璃上说，“这不是各种各样的鱼都走过来了嘛！”\n “真是！鱼呀，”康塞尔喊着，“好像我们是在鱼缸面前呢！”\n “不，”我回答，“因为鱼缸是一个笼子，但这些鱼是像空中的鸟一般自由自在。”\n “好哇，康塞尔好朋友，您现在说说这些鱼的名目吧，说说这些鱼的名目吧！”尼德·，兰说。\n 康塞尔回答：“那我可说不上来。这是我主人的事！，\n “是一条箭鱼。”我于是说了。\n 诚然，康塞尔这个人，狂热的分类家，不是一个生物学家，我想他不一定能分别鲤鱼和鳍鱼的不同。总之他跟加拿大人正相反，加拿大人可以毫不迟疑他说出这些鱼的名字来。\n 尼德·兰回答：“是一条中国箭鱼。”\n 康塞尔于是低声说：“箭鱼属，硬皮科，固颚目。”\n 毫无疑问，尼德·兰和康塞尔，他们俩合起来，会成为一位出色的生物学家。\n 加拿大人并没有弄错。面前是一群箭鱼，压扁的身躯。皱纹的皮肤，背脊上有箭链式的武器，在诺第留斯号周围游来游去，鼓动着它们尾巴两边的四排尖刺。再没有比它们的外表更使人赞赏的了，上边灰色，下面全白，点点的金黄在波浪的漩涡中间闪闪发亮，多么美丽！在箭鱼中间，有鳃鱼，像随凤招展的台布，翻来转去，鳃鱼中我看到了使我很喜欢的那种中国鲤鱼，它上半身黑黄色，肚下淡淡的玫瑰色,眼睛后面带有三根刺；这种鱼是很少有的一种，拉色别德当时甚至于还不敢相信有这种鱼，他只在一本日本的图画书中看见过。\n 在两小时内，整整一大群的水族部队围绕在诺第留斯号周围。在它们的戏耍，它们的跳跃中间，当它们以美丽、光彩和速度来彼此比赛对抗的时候，我分别认出：青色的海婆婆，带有双层黑线的海诽绸鱼，圆团团的尾，白颜色，背上带紫红斑点的虾虎鱼，身上蓝色，头银白色的日本海中的美丽鳍鱼，不用描写，单单名字就可以看出的辉煌的碧琉璃鱼，或带蓝色或带黄色的鳍的条纹鳃鱼，尾上特别有一条黑带的线条鳃鱼，漂亮的裹在六条带中的线带鳃鱼，真正笛子口一般的笛口鱼，间有长至一米的海鹌鹑，日本的火蛇，多刺的鳗鱼，眼睛细小生动，大嘴中长有利牙的六英尺长蛇等等。\n 我们的赞美一直是最高度的。我们不断地发出惊叹声。尼德·兰说出鱼的名字，康塞尔加以分类；我就在这些鱼类伪活泼姿态和美丽的外形面前，感到极大的喜悦，我从没有像现在这样的机会，可以任意观看这些动物，活生生的，自由自在的，在它们本来生长的海水中游来游去。\n 在我昏花的眼面前游过的各种类型的水族，简直就是日本海和中国海的全部标本，我对它们实在不能一一列举出来。这些鱼比空中的鸟还多，可能是受电光的吸引，全部向船边跑过来了。\n 客厅中突然明亮。船边盖板闭起来。使人神迷的光景隐没不见了。可是我很久还似做梦般地想着，一直到我的眼光注意到那些挂在墙板上的机械为止。罗盘仍是指着东北偏东方，气压表正指五气压，表示船在五十米的深处，电力测程器让我们知道船行是每小时十五海里。\n 我等着尼摩船长，但他不出来。大钟正指五点。\n 尼德·兰和康塞尔回到他们的舱房。我也走进我的房间。晚餐早在房中摆好了：其中有最美味的海鳖做的汤，一盘切成薄片的海诽鲤鱼的白肉，鲤鱼肝另做，非常可口，一盘金绸鱼的内片，我觉得味道比鲑鱼肉还好。\n 我夜间看书，写笔记，思考问题。一会儿瞌睡来了，我就躺在海藻叶制的床上，酣美地人睡，这个时候，诺第留斯号正很快地穿过黑潮暖流，迅速地驶去。\n \n
