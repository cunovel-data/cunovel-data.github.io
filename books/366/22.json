{"id":13877,"no":22,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 22","content":"WITHOUT STANDING UP, we stared in the direction of the forest, my hand stopping halfway to my mouth, Ned Land\u0027s completing its assignment.\n \"Stones don\u0027t fall from the sky,\" Conseil said, \"or else they deserve to be called meteorites.\"\n A second well-polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from Conseil\u0027s hand, giving still greater relevance to his observation.\n We all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to answer any attack.\n \"Apes maybe?\" Ned Land exclaimed.\n \"Nearly,\" Conseil replied. \"Savages.\"\n \"Head for the skiff!\" I said, moving toward the sea.\n Indeed, it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty natives, armed with bows and slings, appeared barely a hundred paces off, on the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our right.\n The skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us.\n The savages approached without running, but they favored us with a show of the greatest hostility. It was raining stones and arrows.\n Ned Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind, and despite the impending danger, he clutched his pig on one side, his kangaroos on the other, and scampered off with respectable speed.\n In two minutes we were on the strand. Loading provisions and weapons into the skiff, pushing it to sea, and positioning its two oars were the work of an instant. We hadn\u0027t gone two cable lengths when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up to their waists. I looked to see if their appearance might draw some of the Nautilus\u0027s men onto the platform. But no. Lying well out, that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted.\n Twenty minutes later we boarded ship. The hatches were open. After mooring the skiff, we reentered the Nautilus\u0027s interior.\n I went below to the lounge, from which some chords were wafting. Captain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a musical trance.\n \"Captain!\" I said to him.\n He didn\u0027t hear me.\n \"Captain!\" I went on, touching him with my hand.\n He trembled, and turning around:\n \"Ah, it\u0027s you, professor!\" he said to me. \"Well, did you have a happy hunt? Was your herb gathering a success?\"\n \"Yes, captain,\" I replied, \"but unfortunately we\u0027ve brought back a horde of bipeds whose proximity worries me.\"\n \"What sort of bipeds?\"\n \"Savages.\"\n \"Savages!\" Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone. \"You set foot on one of the shores of this globe, professor, and you\u0027re surprised to find savages there? Where aren\u0027t there savages? And besides, are they any worse than men elsewhere, these people you call savages?\"\n \"But captain--\"\n \"Speaking for myself, sir, I\u0027ve encountered them everywhere.\"\n \"Well then,\" I replied, \"if you don\u0027t want to welcome them aboard the Nautilus, you\u0027d better take some precautions!\"\n \"Easy, professor, no cause for alarm.\"\n \"But there are a large number of these natives.\"\n \"What\u0027s your count?\"\n \"At least a hundred.\"\n \"Professor Aronnax,\" replied Captain Nemo, whose fingers took their places again on the organ keys, \"if every islander in Papua were to gather on that beach, the Nautilus would still have nothing to fear from their attacks!\"\n The captain\u0027s fingers then ran over the instrument\u0027s keyboard, and I noticed that he touched only its black keys, which gave his melodies a basically Scottish color. Soon he had forgotten my presence and was lost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel.\n I climbed onto the platform. Night had already fallen, because in this low latitude the sun sets quickly, without any twilight. I could see Gueboroa Island only dimly. But numerous fires had been kindled on the beach, attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it.\n For several hours I was left to myself, sometimes musing on the islanders-- but no longer fearing them because the captain\u0027s unflappable confidence had won me over--and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at the splendors of this tropical night. My memories took wing toward France, in the wake of those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in a few hours. The moon shone in the midst of the constellations at their zenith. I then remembered that this loyal, good-natured satellite would return to this same place the day after tomorrow, to raise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed. Near midnight, seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves as well as under the waterside trees, I repaired to my cabin and fell into a peaceful sleep.\n The night passed without mishap. No doubt the Papuans had been frightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in the bay, because our hatches stayed open, offering easy access to the Nautilus\u0027s interior.\n At six o\u0027clock in the morning, January 8, I climbed onto the platform. The morning shadows were lifting. The island was soon on view through the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its summits.\n The islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day before, perhaps 500 or 600 of them. Taking advantage of the low tide, some of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within two cable lengths of the Nautilus. I could easily distinguish them. They obviously were true Papuans, men of fine stock, athletic in build, forehead high and broad, nose large but not flat, teeth white. Their woolly, red-tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies, which were black and glistening like those of Nubians. Beneath their pierced, distended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from bone. Generally these savages were naked. I noted some women among them, dressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made of vegetation. Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with crescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white glass. Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them carried from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished stones their slings hurl with such dexterity.\n One of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus, examining it with care. He must have been a \"mado\" of high rank, because he paraded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges and was accented with bright colors.\n I could easily have picked off this islander, he stood at such close range; but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of hostility. Between Europeans and savages, it\u0027s acceptable for Europeans to shoot back but not to attack first.\n During this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near the Nautilus, but they weren\u0027t boisterous. I often heard them repeat the word \"assai,\" and from their gestures I understood they were inviting me to go ashore, an invitation I felt obliged to decline.\n So the skiff didn\u0027t leave shipside that day, much to the displeasure of Mr. Land who couldn\u0027t complete his provisions. The adroit Canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from Gueboroa Island. As for the savages, they went back to shore near eleven o\u0027clock in the morning, when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide. But I saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach. It was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of Papua proper. However, I didn\u0027t see one local dugout canoe.\n Having nothing better to do, I decided to dredge these beautiful, clear waters, which exhibited a profusion of shells, zoophytes, and open-sea plants. Besides, it was the last day the Nautilus would spend in these waterways, if, tomorrow, it still floated off to the open sea as Captain Nemo had promised.\n So I summoned Conseil, who brought me a small, light dragnet similar to those used in oyster fishing.\n \"What about these savages?\" Conseil asked me. \"With all due respect to master, they don\u0027t strike me as very wicked!\"\n \"They\u0027re cannibals even so, my boy.\"\n \"A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man,\" Conseil replied, \"just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable. The one doesn\u0027t exclude the other.\"\n \"Fine, Conseil! And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who decently devour their prisoners. However, I\u0027m opposed to being devoured, even in all decency, so I\u0027ll keep on my guard, especially since the Nautilus\u0027s commander seems to be taking no precautions. And now let\u0027s get to work!\"\n For two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing up any rarities. Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone, harp shells, obelisk snails, and especially the finest hammer shells I had seen to that day. We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers, some pearl oysters, and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship\u0027s pantry.\n But just when I least expected it, I laid my hands on a wonder, a natural deformity I\u0027d have to call it, something very seldom encountered. Conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet, and his gear had come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells, when suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net, pull out a shelled animal, and give a conchological yell, in other words, the most piercing yell a human throat can produce.\n \"Eh? What happened to master?\" Conseil asked, very startled. \"Did master get bitten?\"\n \"No, my boy, but I\u0027d gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find!\"\n \"What find?\"\n \"This shell,\" I said, displaying the subject of my triumph.\n \"But that\u0027s simply an olive shell of the \u0027tent olive\u0027 species, genus Oliva, order Pectinibranchia, class Gastropoda, branch Mollusca--\"\n \"Yes, yes, Conseil! But instead of coiling from right to left, this olive shell rolls from left to right!\"\n \"It can\u0027t be!\" Conseil exclaimed.\n \"Yes, my boy, it\u0027s a left-handed shell!\"\n \"A left-handed shell!\" Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.\n \"Look at its spiral!\"\n \"Oh, master can trust me on this,\" Conseil said, taking the valuable shell in trembling hands, \"but never have I felt such excitement!\"\n And there was good reason to be excited! In fact, as naturalists have ventured to observe, \"dextrality\" is a well-known law of nature. In their rotational and orbital movements, stars and their satellites go from right to left. Man uses his right hand more often than his left, and consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases, locks, watch springs, etc.) are designed to be used in a right-to-left manner. Now then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her shells. They\u0027re right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by chance a shell\u0027s spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight in gold for it.\n So Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure, and I was solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum with it, when an ill-timed stone, hurled by one of the islanders, whizzed over and shattered the valuable object in Conseil\u0027s hands.\n I gave a yell of despair! Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed at a savage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him. I tried to stop him, but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet of amulets dangling from the islander\u0027s arm.\n \"Conseil!\" I shouted. \"Conseil!\"\n \"Eh? What? Didn\u0027t master see that this man-eater initiated the attack?\"\n \"A shell isn\u0027t worth a human life!\" I told him.\n \"Oh, the rascal!\" Conseil exclaimed. \"I\u0027d rather he cracked my shoulder!\"\n Conseil was in dead earnest, but I didn\u0027t subscribe to his views. However, the situation had changed in only a short time and we hadn\u0027t noticed. Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the Nautilus. Hollowed from tree trunks, these dugouts were long, narrow, and well designed for speed, keeping their balance by means of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water. They were maneuvered by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I viewed their advance with definite alarm.\n It was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with Europeans and knew their ships. But this long, iron cylinder lying in the bay, with no masts or funnels--what were they to make of it? Nothing good, because at first they kept it at a respectful distance. However, seeing that it stayed motionless, they regained confidence little by little and tried to become more familiar with it. Now then, it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to prevent. Since our weapons made no sound when they went off, they would have only a moderate effect on these islanders, who reputedly respect nothing but noisy mechanisms. Without thunderclaps, lightning bolts would be much less frightening, although the danger lies in the flash, not the noise.\n Just then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus, and a cloud of arrows burst over us.\n \"Fire and brimstone, it\u0027s hailing!\" Conseil said. \"And poisoned hail perhaps!\"\n \"We\u0027ve got to alert Captain Nemo,\" I said, reentering the hatch.\n I went below to the lounge. I found no one there. I ventured a knock at the door opening into the captain\u0027s stateroom.\n The word \"Enter!\" answered me. I did so and found Captain Nemo busy with calculations in which there was no shortage of X and other algebraic signs.\n \"Am I disturbing you?\" I said out of politeness.\n \"Correct, Professor Aronnax,\" the captain answered me. \"But I imagine you have pressing reasons for looking me up?\"\n \"Very pressing. Native dugout canoes are surrounding us, and in a few minutes we\u0027re sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages.\"\n \"Ah!\" Captain Nemo put in serenely. \"They\u0027ve come in their dugouts?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Well, sir, closing the hatches should do the trick.\"\n \"Precisely, and that\u0027s what I came to tell you--\"\n \"Nothing easier,\" Captain Nemo said.\n And he pressed an electric button, transmitting an order to the crew\u0027s quarters.\n \"There, sir, all under control!\" he told me after a few moments. \"The skiff is in place and the hatches are closed. I don\u0027t imagine you\u0027re worried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells from your frigate couldn\u0027t breach?\"\n \"No, captain, but one danger still remains.\"\n \"What\u0027s that, sir?\"\n \"Tomorrow at about this time, we\u0027ll need to reopen the hatches to renew the Nautilus\u0027s air.\"\n \"No argument, sir, since our craft breathes in the manner favored by cetaceans.\"\n \"But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment, I don\u0027t see how you can prevent them from entering.\"\n \"Then, sir, you assume they\u0027ll board the ship?\"\n \"I\u0027m certain of it.\"\n \"Well, sir, let them come aboard. I see no reason to prevent them. Deep down they\u0027re just poor devils, these Papuans, and I don\u0027t want my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one of these unfortunate people!\"\n On this note I was about to withdraw; but Captain Nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him. He questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting, but seemed not to understand the Canadian\u0027s passionate craving for red meat. Then our conversation skimmed various subjects, and without being more forthcoming, Captain Nemo proved more affable.\n Among other things, we came to talk of the Nautilus\u0027s circumstances, aground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d\u0027Urville had nearly miscarried. Then, pertinent to this:\n \"He was one of your great seamen,\" the captain told me, \"one of your shrewdest navigators, that d\u0027Urville! He was the Frenchman\u0027s Captain Cook. A man wise but unlucky! Braving the ice banks of the South Pole, the coral of Oceania, the cannibals of the Pacific, only to perish wretchedly in a train wreck! If that energetic man was able to think about his life in its last seconds, imagine what his final thoughts must have been!\"\n As he spoke, Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved, an emotion I felt was to his credit.\n Then, chart in hand, we returned to the deeds of the French navigator: his voyages to circumnavigate the globe, his double attempt at the South Pole, which led to his discovery of the Adélie Coast and the Louis-Philippe Peninsula, finally his hydrographic surveys of the chief islands in Oceania.\n \"What your d\u0027Urville did on the surface of the sea,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"I\u0027ve done in the ocean\u0027s interior, but more easily, more completely than he. Constantly tossed about by hurricanes, the Zealous and the new Astrolabe couldn\u0027t compare with the Nautilus, a quiet work room truly at rest in the midst of the waters!\"\n \"Even so, captain,\" I said, \"there is one major similarity between Dumont d\u0027Urville\u0027s sloops of war and the Nautilus.\"\n \"What\u0027s that, sir?\"\n \"Like them, the Nautilus has run aground!\"\n \"The Nautilus is not aground, sir,\" Captain Nemo replied icily. \"The Nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don\u0027t need to undertake the arduous labors, the maneuvers d\u0027Urville had to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war. The Zealous and the new Astrolabe wellnigh perished, but my Nautilus is in no danger. Tomorrow, on the day stated and at the hour stated, the tide will peacefully lift it off, and it will resume its navigating through the seas.\"\n \"Captain,\" I said, \"I don\u0027t doubt--\"\n \"Tomorrow,\" Captain Nemo added, standing up, \"tomorrow at 2:40 in the afternoon, the Nautilus will float off and exit the Torres Strait undamaged.\"\n Pronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone, Captain Nemo gave me a curt bow. This was my dismissal, and I reentered my stateroom.\n There I found Conseil, who wanted to know the upshot of my interview with the captain.\n \"My boy,\" I replied, \"when I expressed the belief that these Papuan natives were a threat to his Nautilus, the captain answered me with great irony. So I\u0027ve just one thing to say to you: have faith in him and sleep in peace.\"\n \"Master has no need for my services?\"\n \"No, my friend. What\u0027s Ned Land up to?\"\n \"Begging master\u0027s indulgence,\" Conseil replied, \"but our friend Ned is concocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder!\"\n I was left to myself; I went to bed but slept pretty poorly. I kept hearing noises from the savages, who were stamping on the platform and letting out deafening yells. The night passed in this way, without the crew ever emerging from their usual inertia. They were no more disturbed by the presence of these man-eaters than soldiers in an armored fortress are troubled by ants running over the armor plate.\n I got up at six o\u0027clock in the morning. The hatches weren\u0027t open. So the air inside hadn\u0027t been renewed; but the air tanks were kept full for any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot a few cubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus\u0027s thin atmosphere.\n I worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo even for an instant. Nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations for departure.\n I still waited for a while, then I made my way to the main lounge. Its timepiece marked 2:30. In ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum elevation, and if Captain Nemo hadn\u0027t made a rash promise, the Nautilus would immediately break free. If not, many months might pass before it could leave its coral bed.\n But some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat\u0027s hull. I heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of that coral base.\n At 2:35 Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge.\n \"We\u0027re about to depart,\" he said.\n \"Ah!\" I put in.\n \"I\u0027ve given orders to open the hatches.\"\n \"What about the Papuans?\"\n \"What about them?\" Captain Nemo replied, with a light shrug of his shoulders.\n \"Won\u0027t they come inside the Nautilus?\"\n \"How will they manage that?\"\n \"By jumping down the hatches you\u0027re about to open.\"\n \"Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo replied serenely, \"the Nautilus\u0027s hatches aren\u0027t to be entered in that fashion even when they\u0027re open.\"\n I gaped at the captain.\n \"You don\u0027t understand?\" he said to me.\n \"Not in the least.\"\n \"Well, come along and you\u0027ll see!\"\n I headed to the central companionway. There, very puzzled, Ned Land and Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches, while a frightful clamor and furious shouts resounded outside.\n The hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating. Twenty horrible faces appeared. But when the first islander laid hands on the companionway railing, he was flung backward by some invisible power, lord knows what! He ran off, howling in terror and wildly prancing around.\n Ten of his companions followed him. All ten met the same fate.\n Conseil was in ecstasy. Carried away by his violent instincts, Ned Land leaped up the companionway. But as soon as his hands seized the railing, he was thrown backward in his turn.\n \"Damnation!\" he exclaimed. \"I\u0027ve been struck by a lightning bolt!\"\n These words explained everything to me. It wasn\u0027t just a railing that led to the platform, it was a metal cable fully charged with the ship\u0027s electricity. Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock-- and such a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown the full current from his equipment into this conducting cable! It could honestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his assailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity.\n Meanwhile, crazed with terror, the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat. As for us, half laughing, we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land, who was swearing like one possessed.\n But just then, lifted off by the tide\u0027s final undulations, the Nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain. Its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty. Gathering speed little by little, the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean, and safe and sound, it left behind the dangerous narrows of the Torres Strait.\n 康塞尔说：\"一块石头不能从天上掉下来，不然的话，就应该叫它为陨石了。”\n 第二块石头，加工的圆形石头，又落下来，把康塞尔手中好吃的一块山鸠腿肉打落了，这证明他的看法更有道理，需要我们注意。\n 我们三人全站起来，把枪扛在肩上，准备立即回答这次·突然的攻击。\n “是一些猿猴吗？”尼德·兰喊。\n “可以说是，”康塞尔回答，“他们是野蛮人①。”\n “回小艇去。”我说，同时向海边走。\n 果然，我们必须向后退走，因为有二十来个土人，拿着弓箭和投石器，从遮住了右方天际的丛林边缘出来，相距不过一百步左右。\n 我们的小艇停在离我们二十米远的海上。\n 这些土人并不快跑，慢慢走来；可是他们做种种表示故意的动作。石块和弓筋像雨点一般打来。尼德·兰不愿意放弃所有的食物，不顾近在眼前的危险，一边拿野猪，一边拿袋鼠，相当快地把食物收拾起来。\n 两分钟后，我们就到了滩上。把食物和武器放在小艇里，将小艇推人海中，安上两支桨，这是一瞬间的事。我们还没有划到二百米远，一百左右的土人大喊大叫，指手画脚地一直走到水深至腰间的海水中。我小心地看，以为这些土人的出现一定要把诺第留斯号船上的一些人引到平台上来观看。可是没有；这只庞大的机器船睡在海面上，完全看不见人的踪影。\n 二十分钟后，我们上了船。嵌板是开着的。把小艇放好后，我们又回到了诺第留斯号的里面来了。\n 我走人客厅，听到有一些乐声发出。尼摩船长在那里，他正弯身向着他的大风琴，沉浸在音乐的极乐情绪中。\n “船长！”我对他说。\n 他好像没有听见。\n “船长！”我叉说，同时用手去碰他。\n 他身上微微发抖，回过身来对我说：\n “啊！是您，教授。很好，你们打猎好吗？你们采得很多的植物吗？”\n “是的，很不错，船长，”我回答，“不过我们很不幸，带来了一样两腿动物，这些动物就在附近，我觉得很不放心。”\n “什么两腿动物哪？，\n “是一些野蛮人呢。”\n “一些野蛮人！”尼摩船长带着讥讽的语气说，“教授，您脚一踏在这地球的陆地上便碰见野蛮人，您觉得奇怪吗？野蛮人，地上尹。一处没有野蛮人呢？而且您叫他们为野蛮人的，一定比其他的人还坏吗？”\n “不过，船长……”\n “在我个人来说，先生，我到处都碰见野蛮人。”\n “那么，”我回答，“如果您不愿意在诺第留斯号船上接待他们的话，我请您注意，想些办法。”\n “您放心吧，教授，这事用不着您担心。”\n “可是土人的人数很多呢。”\n “您估计他们有多少？”\n “至少有一百左右。”\n “阿龙纳斯先生，”尼摩船长回答，他的手指又搁在大风琴的键子上了，“就是巴布亚所有的土人都齐集在这海滩上，诺第留斯号一点也不怕他们的攻击！”\n 船长的指头于是又在风琴键盘上奔驰了，我看他只是按黑键，这使他弹出的和声主要是带苏格兰乐曲的特色。·不久他就忘记了我在他面前，沉浸在一种美梦幻想中，我不敢去惊动他，打搅他。\n 我又回平台上来。黑夜已经来临，因为在这低纬度的地区，太阳落下得很快，并且没有黄昏的时候。我看那格波罗尔岛很是模糊不清。但有许多火光在海滩上闪耀，证明这些土人不想走开，守在那里。\n 我一个人这样在平台上留了好几个钟头，有时想着这些土人——但并不特别怕他们，因为船长的坚定不移的信．心影响着我——有时忘记了他们，欣赏这热带地区的夜间的美丽景象。我的思想飞向法国去了，好像跟着黄道十二宫的星宿一齐去似的，这些星是有好几个钟头照着法国的。月亮在顶上星辰中间辉煌照耀，我于是想到，这座忠实殷勤的地球卫星要在后天回到相同的这个地方来，掀起这些海波，使诺第留斯号脱离它的珊瑚石床。到夜半左右，看见沉黑的海波上一切都很平静，同时海岸的树下也一样没有声息，我就回到我的舱房中，安心地睡去。\n 一夜过去，没有不幸事故发生。巴布亚人可能由于单单看见搁浅在海湾中的大怪物，便不敢前来，因为嵌板仍然开着，他们很容易走进诺第留斯号里面来。\n 早晨六点一一：月8日——我又走上乎台。早晨的阴影散开了。格波罗尔岛从消失的雾气中露出来，首先露出海滩，然后现出山峰。\n 土人守在那里，比昨天的人数更多了，大约有五六百人左右。有些土人乘着低潮，来到珊瑚石尖上，离诺第留斯号约四百米远。我可以清楚地看见他们。他们是真正的巴布亚人，身材高大，体格魁伟，前额宽大高起，鼻子粗大，但不扁平，牙齿洁白。他们像羊毛一般的头发作红颜色，披散在漆黑发亮的、像非洲纽比人一般的身躯上。他们的耳垂子，割开了和拉长了，挂着骨质的耳环。这些土人通常是光着身子，不穿衣服。我看见他们中间有些女人，从腰至膝穿一件真正草叶做的粗糙裙子，上面用一根草带子系起来。有些头领脖子上带着一个弯月形的饰物和红白两色的玻璃编成的项链。差不多全体上人都带了弓、箭和盾，肩上背着象网一类的东西，网中装满他们能巧妙地用投石机投出来的溜圆石块。\n 其中一个头领走到相当接近诺第留斯号的地方，很叙心地考察这只船。他好像是一个高级的“马多”①，因为他披着一条香蕉树叶编的围巾，中边上织成花样，并且染了很鲜明的颜色。\n 我可以很容易击毙这个土人，因为他站在很近的地方；但我认为等待他表示出真正故意的攻击行动之后，再还手才对。\n 在整个低潮期间，这些土人在诺第留斯号周围转来转去；但他们并不大声喧闹。我常常听到他们一再说“阿洗”这句话，从他们的手势来看，我懂得他们是要我到岛上去，但我想对他们这个邀请还是谢绝的好。\n 所以这一天小艇不能离大船了，使得尼德·兰师傅很是失望，他不可能补足他所要的食物了。这个手巧的加拿大人于是利用他的时间，来准备他从格波罗尔岛上带回来舶肉类和面粉。至于那些土人，在早晨十一点左右，当珊瑚石尖顶开始在上涨的潮水下隐没不见时，都回到岸上去了。但我看见他们在海滩上的人数大量增加了。大约他们是从邻近小岛来的，或者就是从巴布亚本岛来的。不过我还没有看到一只上人的独木舟。\n 我因为目前没有什么可做的，就想到要在这些清澈的海水中去捞捞看，好像水里面有丰富的贝壳类、植虫类和海产植物。并且今天又是诺第留斯号在这一带海面停留的最后一天了，因为照尼摩船长的诺言，在明天潮涨的时候，船就要浮出去了。因此我叫康塞尔，他给我拿了一个轻便的小捞器，就像拿来打牡蛎的捞器一般的网。\n \"那些野蛮人呢？”康塞尔问我，“不怕先生见怪，我觉得他们并不十分凶恶！”\n “可是他们要吃人的，老实人。”\n “一个人同时可以是吃人肉的又是老实的，”康塞尔回答“就像一个人同时可以是贪食的又是诚实的一样，彼此中不对立。”\n “对！康塞尔，我同意你的说法，他们是吃人肉的诚实人,他们是老老实实地吃俘虏的肉。不过我不想被他们吞食，即使是老老实实的吞食，我也不愿意。我要时时警戒，十分小心，因为诺第留斯号的船长好像一点不注意，不加防范。现在我们动手捞吧。”\n 在两个钟头内，我们打鱼进行得相当活跃，但没有打到罕见的珍品。打捞器里面装满了驴耳贝、竖琴贝、河贝子，特别又打到了我今天才看见的最好看的糙鱼，我们又打了一些海参，产珍珠的牡蛎和一打左右的小鳖，这些都打来作为船上的食用品。\n 但是，在绝对的无意中，我却找到一件珍奇品，我应该说，找到一件自然变形的珍品，这种东西最不容易碰见。康塞尔把打捞器放下去又捞起来的时候，器中装满很平常的各种贝类，他忽然看见我的胳膊很快伸进网里面去，取出一个贝壳来，发出贝类学家的喊声，即是说，发出人类喉咙可以发出的最尖锐的喊声。\n “哎！先生怎么啦？”康塞尔问，他非常惊怪，“先生被咬了吗？”\n “没有，老实人，我实在愿意用我的一个指头来换取我：的发现呢。”\n “什么发现呢？，\n “就是这个贝壳。”我手指着我的战利品说。\n “但这不过是一个普通的斑红橄榄贝,橄榄贝属，节鳃图，腹足纲，软体类门……”\n “对，康塞尔，但这个橄榄贝纹跟普通的不一样，不是从右往左卷过来，而是从左往右转过去.\"\n “可能吗？”康塞尔喊道。\n “一点不错，老实人，这是一个左卷贝！”\n “一个左卷贝！”康塞尔重复说，他心跳动着。\n “你看一看这贝壳的螺旋纹便明白了。”\n “啊！先生可以相信我，”康塞尔说，用发抖的手拿着这珍贵的贝壳，“我从没有感到像现在这样的一种情绪呢！”\n 这实在是可以使人情绪激动的！正是，像生物学家所观察到的一样，由右向左是自然的法则。天体的行星和它们的卫星公转和自转的运动，都是从右向左转。人类使用右手的机会比使用左手为多，因此，人类的工具和器械、楼梯、锁钥、钟表的法条等，都配合成由右向左来使用的。大自然对于贝类的卷旋螺纹，通常也是按照这个法则。贝类纹基本是右转的，很少有例外，偶然有贝纹是左转的。，爱好的人便以黄金的重阶来收买了。\n 康塞尔和我因此都在欣赏我们所得的宝贝，完全陶醉了，我正欣幸我们的博物馆又可以多一件珍品了；忽然一个土人投来一个石子，不幸地把康塞尔手中的珍品打碎了。\n 我发出了一声绝望的喊声！康塞尔拿起我的枪，对准在十米外挥动投石机的一个土人，就要打。我正要阻止他，但他的枪弹已经放出去了，粉碎了挂在土人胳膊上的护身灵镯。\n “康塞尔！“康塞尔！”我喊。\n “怎么啦！先生没有看见这个土人开始攻击了吗？·\n “一个贝壳不能跟一个人的性命相比！”我对他说）\n “啊！混蛋东西！”康塞尔喊，“他就是打碎我的肩骨，我觉得也比打碎这贝壳好一些！”\n 康塞尔说的是老实话，不过我不赞同他的意见。可是目前的情形已经很不对了，这一点我们还没有觉察到。这时，有二十多只独木舟正围绕着诺第留斯号。这种独木舟是中空的树身做的，很长，很窄。为了便于行驶，配上两条浮在水面的竹制长杆，使舟身可以平衡不倾斜地摆动。独木舟由半光着身体、巧妙使用自由桨板的上人驾驶，我看见他们驶向前来，心中不能不害怕起来。\n 很显然，这些巴布亚人已经跟欧洲人有过来往，他们见过而且能够识别欧洲人的船只。但我们这只躺在湾中的钢铁圆锥，没有桅槁，没有烟突，他们会怎么想呢？他们一定认为这是没有一点好处的坏东西，因为他们首先站在距离相当远的地方，不敢近前。可是，看见船停住不动，他们渐渐恢复了信心，想法子跟船熟识。正是这种要求熟识的行动，人们应加以阻止。我们的武器没有砰砰的声响，对于这些土人只能有一种很平常的效力，因为他们所害怕的是宏大的炮声，雷电的危险虽然在闪光而不在声响。但如果没有隆隆的轰击，也很少有人害怕。\n 这时候，独木舟更逼近诺第留斯号了，一阵一阵的箭落在船身上了。\n “真怪! 下雹子了!\"康塞尔说，“可能是有毒的雹子呢!\"\n “应当通知尼摩船长。”我说，同时我就从嵌板中进来。\n 我走到客厅中，客厅里没有人。我冒昧敲一敲朝着船长房间开的那扇门。\n 一声“请进”回答我；我进去，我见船长正聚精会神地作计算，上面有很多X 未知数和其它的代数符号。\n “我打搅您吧？”我有礼貌他说。\n “不错，阿龙纳斯先生，”船长回答我，“不过我想您来见我, 一定有紧急重大的事情。”\n “对，很紧急，很重大的事，土人的许多独木舟把我们围起来了，几分钟内，我们一定就要受到好几百土人的攻击了.\"\n “啊!\"尼摩船长安静地说，“他们是乘他们的独木舟来的吗?\"\n “是的，先生。\n “好吧，先生，把嵌板关上就够了。”\n “正是，我就是来告诉您……”\n “再没有更容易的了.\"尼摩船长说。\n 他手按一个电钮，把命令传达到船员所在的岗位。\n “命令执行了，先生，”他过一刻后对我说，“小艇放好了，嵌板关上了。我想，这些钢铁墙壁，就是林肯号战舰的炮弹都不能伤损的，你现在不害怕那些土人先生们会冲进来了吧？”\n “不害怕了，船长；但还有一个危险存在。\"\n “先生，什么危险呢？”。\n “就是明天又要打开嵌板来调换诺第留斯号的空气……”\n “那不用说，先生，因为我们的船是跟鲸鱼类一般呼吸的。”\n “可是，如果这个时候，巴布亚人占据了平台，我真不知。道您怎样可以不让他们进来呢。”\n “那么，先生，您以为他们可以走上船来吗？”\n “我想是可以。”\n “好，先生，让他们上来好了。我看不出有什么理由可 以阻止他们。实际上，这些已布亚人是很可怜悯的，我在访问格波罗尔岛的过程中，就是只牺牲一个这样苦命人的生命，我也不愿意！”\n 他说完了这话，我要退出了，但尼摩船长把我留下，要、我坐在他身边。他很关心地问我们登陆游荡的经过，我们打猎的情形，他好像完全不了解加拿大人爱吃肉类的那种需要。然后谈话转到各种问题上，尼摩船长虽然并不比从前更容易流露内心情感，但却露出了比较和蔼可亲的样子。在许多他提到的问题中间，我们谈到诺第留斯号目前所处的地位，因为它正搁浅在杜蒙·居维尔几乎要丢了性命的这个海峡中。一会儿，船长对我说起这件事：\n 他是你们的伟大海员之一，这位居维尔是你们富有智慧的航海家之一！他是你们法国人的库克船长。不幸的学者啊！不怕南极的冰层，不伯大洋洲的珊瑚礁，不怕太平洋的吃人肉的土人，经历了种种危险后，竟在火车失事中多么不值地丢了性命，多么可惜啊! 如果这个精干的人在他生存的最后一刻，可能做些思考的活，您想想他最后的智慧会是什么呢！”①\n 这样说着，尼摩船长好像情绪很激动的样子，我被他的这种情绪感染了。\n 然后，手拿着地图，我们再来看这位法国航海家所做的工作，他的环球航行，他到南极的两次探险，使他发见阿米利和路易·非力两个地方，以及他对于大洋洲主要岛屿所做的水道学的记载资料。\n “你们的居维尔在海面上所做的，尼摩船长对我说，“我在海洋底下做了，做得比他更方便，更完全，浑天仪号和热心女号不断受大风暴所摆动，不能跟诺第留斯号相比，它是安静的工作室，在海水中间真正安然不动呢！”\n “不过，船长，”我说，“杜蒙·居维尔的旧式海船跟诺第留斯号有一点相似的地方。”\n “先生，哪一点呢？”\n “就是诺第留斯号跟它们一样搁浅了！”\n “诺第留斯号并没有搁浅，先生，”尼摩船长冷淡地回答我，“诺第留斯号是歇在侮床上的，居维尔要他的船脱离开礁石，重回海上所必须做的艰苦工程，困难动作，我根本不用做。浑天仪号和热心女号几乎沉没了，但我的诺第留斯号一点也没有危险。明天，在我指定的日子，指定的、时刻，潮水把它平安地浮起来，它又穿洋过海地在水中航行了。”\n “船长，”我说\" 我并不怀疑……”\n “明天，”尼摩船长又说，同时他站起来，“明天，下午两点四十分，诺第留斯号将浮在海上，毫无损伤地离开托列斯海峡.\"\n 用干脆的语气说完了这些话后，尼摩船长轻轻地点点头。这是让我走开的表示，我就回我房中来。\n 我见康塞尔在房中，他想知道我跟船长会谈的结果\n “老实人，”我回答,\"当我觉得他的诺第留斯号是要受巴布亚上人的严重威胁的时候，船长带着十足嘲讽的神气回答了我。所以我只跟你说一点，就是：相信他，安心睡觉。”\n “先生没有事需要我做吗？”\n “没有，老实人。尼德·兰干什么去了?\"\n “请先生原谅我，”康塞尔回答，“尼德好朋友正在做袋：鼠肉饼，这将成为美味的珍品呢！”\n 我又是独自一人了，我睡下，但睡不着。我听到土人所作的声响，他们发出震耳的叫喊，在乎台上不停地用脚踩踏，一夜便这样过去，船上人员仍是照常不动，全不理睬。这些土人在他们面前，他们一点也没有感到不安，就像守在铁甲堡垒中的兵士全不留心在铁甲上奔跑的蚂蚁一样。\n 到六点，我起床来。嵌板并没有打开，所以船内部的。空气有调换，但储藏库中总是装满空气的，于是及时使用它, 把好几立方米的氧放人诺第留斯号的缺氧空气中，我在房中工作，直到中午，一刻也没有看见尼摩船长，好像船没有作任何开行的准备。\n 我又等了些时候，然后到客厅去。大针正指两点半十分钟内，海潮就要达到最高点了。如果尼摩船长没有们狂妄的诺言，那么诺第留斯号立即就要脱离礁石了。不然的话，那在它能离开珊瑚石床之前，恐怕还要这样度过不知多少年月呢。\n 可是，不久就在船身上感到有些作为前奏的抖颤。我听到珊瑚石上石灰质形成的不乎表面在船边上摩擦，沙沙作响了。\n 两点三十五分，尼摩船长出现在客厅中。\n “我们要开行了。”他说。\n “啊！”我喊一声.\n “我下了命令，要打开嵌板。\"\n “那些巴布亚人呢？”\n “哪些巴布亚人？”尼摩船长回答，同时轻轻地耸一耸肩。\n “他们不是要走进诺第留斯号里面来吗？”\n “怎样进来?\"\n “从您叫人打开的嵌板进来。”\n “阿龙纳斯先生，”尼摩船长安静地回答，“人们不能这样随便从嵌板进来，就是它们开着也不能 \"\n 我眼盯着船长。”\n “您不明白吗？”他对我说。\n “一点不明白。”\n “那么，您来吧，您就可以看见了。\n 我向中央铁梯走去。尼德·兰和康塞尔在那里，他们心中很奇怪，正看着船上的人员把嵌板打开，同时疯狂可怕的大声叫唤在外面震天价响。\n 嵌板的外面放下来了。怕人的二十副脸孔现出来了。但第一个土人，那个把手放在铁梯扶手上的，马上被一种神秘不可见的力量推到后面去，他发出怕人的叫喊，做出奇怪的跳跃逃跑。，他的十个同伴陆续前来按扶挡,十个也得到相同的命运，受到打击，向后逃走。\n 康塞尔乐得发狂了。尼德·兰由于他急躁的天性所驱使，跑到楼梯上去。但是，一当他两手抓住扶手的时候，他也被击惯倒。\n “有鬼！有鬼!\"他喊，“我被雷打了！”\n 这句话给我说明了一切。那并不是扶手，那是一根铁索，通过了船上的电流，直达到平台。谁触到它，谁都受到一种厉害的震动，如果尼摩船长把他机器中的整个电流都放到这导体中去，另”这种震动就是致命的力量！人们真可以说，在来攻的敌人和他之间，他张挂了一副电网，谁都不徒通过它而不受到惩罚。\n 巴布亚人害怕得发狂，都向后退走。我们笑着，安慰不幸的尼德。兰，用手摩擦他，他像魔鬼附身一样，大声地咒骂.\n 但在这个时候，诺第留斯号受海水最后的波浪所掀动，就在船长指定的正好是两点四十分的时候，离开了它的珊瑚石床。它的机轮开始以隆重的缓慢姿态搅打海水。一会儿，速度渐渐增大，向大海面奔驰前去，它安全无恙地把托列斯海峡的危险水道抛在后面了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/292.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
