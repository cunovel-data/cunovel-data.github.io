{"id":13858,"no":3,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 3","content":"THREE SECONDS before the arrival of J. B. Hobson\u0027s letter, I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage. Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it.\\n\\n Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest. I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections! But now nothing could hold me back. I forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion, friends, or collections, I accepted the American government\u0027s offer.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" I mused, \"all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France! That fine animal may even let itself be captured in European seas--as a personal favor to me--and I\u0027ll bring back to the Museum of Natural History at least half a meter of its ivory lance!\"\\n\\n But in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in the northern Pacific Ocean; which meant returning to France by way of the Antipodes.\\n\\n \"Conseil!\" I called in an impatient voice.\\n\\n Conseil was my manservant. A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle, habitually hardworking, rarely startled by life\u0027s surprises, very skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his having a name that means \"counsel,\" never giving advice-- not even the unsolicited kind!\\n\\n From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came to a halt. Classifying was everything to him, so he knew nothing else. Well versed in the theory of classification, he was poorly versed in its practical application, and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale! And yet, what a fine, gallant lad!\\n\\n For the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned. Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey. Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid muscles, but hadn\u0027t a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves-- the mental type, I mean.\\n\\n The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty. Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting I had turned forty.\\n\\n But Conseil had one flaw. He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person--to the point where it got tiresome.\\n\\n \"Conseil!\" I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure.\\n\\n To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad. Ordinarily, I never asked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys; but this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely, a hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could sink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell! There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world\u0027s most emotionless man. What would Conseil say?\\n\\n \"Conseil!\" I called a third time.\\n\\n Conseil appeared.\\n\\n \"Did master summon me?\" he said, entering.\\n\\n \"Yes, my boy. Get my things ready, get yours ready. We\u0027re departing in two hours.\"\\n\\n \"As master wishes,\" Conseil replied serenely.\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t a moment to lose. Pack as much into my trunk as you can, my traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don\u0027t bother counting, just squeeze it all in--and hurry!\"\\n\\n \"What about master\u0027s collections?\" Conseil ventured to observe.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll deal with them later.\"\\n\\n \"What! The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus, and master\u0027s other fossil skeletons?\"\\n\\n \"The hotel will keep them for us.\"\\n\\n \"What about master\u0027s live babirusa?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll feed it during our absence. Anyhow, we\u0027ll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France.\"\\n\\n \"Then we aren\u0027t returning to Paris?\" Conseil asked.\\n\\n \"Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ,\" I replied evasively, \"but after we make a detour.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever detour master wishes.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing really! A route slightly less direct, that\u0027s all. We\u0027re leaving on the Abraham Lincoln.\"\\n\\n \"As master thinks best,\" Conseil replied placidly.\\n\\n \"You see, my friend, it\u0027s an issue of the monster, the notorious narwhale. We\u0027re going to rid the seas of it! The author of a two-volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut. It\u0027s a glorious mission but also a dangerous one! We don\u0027t know where it will take us! These beasts can be quite unpredictable! But we\u0027re going just the same! We have a commander who\u0027s game for anything!\"\\n\\n \"What master does, I\u0027ll do,\" Conseil replied.\\n\\n \"But think it over, because I don\u0027t want to hide anything from you. This is one of those voyages from which people don\u0027t always come back!\"\\n\\n \"As master wishes.\"\\n\\n A quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready. Conseil did them in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn\u0027t missed a thing, because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.\\n\\n The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd. I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France. I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.\\n\\n For a fare of twenty francs, the vehicle went down Broadway to Union Square, took Fourth Ave. to its junction with Bowery St., turned into Katrin St. and halted at Pier 34. There the Katrin ferry transferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.\\n\\n Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard. I asked for Commander Farragut. One of the sailors led me to the afterdeck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking officer who extended his hand to me.\\n\\n \"Professor Pierre Aronnax?\" he said to me.\\n\\n \"The same,\" I replied. \"Commander Farragut?\"\\n\\n \"In person. Welcome aboard, professor. Your cabin is waiting for you.\"\\n\\n I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.\\n\\n The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment. It was a high-speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres. Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached an average speed of 18.3 miles per hour, a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.\\n\\n The frigate\u0027s interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern and opened into the officers\u0027 mess.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be quite comfortable here,\" I told Conseil.\\n\\n \"With all due respect to master,\" Conseil replied, \"as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk.\"\\n\\n I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.\\n\\n Just then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last moorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier. And so if I\u0027d been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less, the frigate would have gone without me, and I would have missed out on this unearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition, whose true story might well meet with some skepticism.\\n\\n But Commander Farragut didn\u0027t want to waste a single day, or even a single hour, in making for those seas where the animal had just been sighted. He summoned his engineer.\\n\\n \"Are we up to pressure?\" he asked the man.\\n\\n \"Aye, sir,\" the engineer replied.\\n\\n \"Go ahead, then!\" Commander Farragut called.\\n\\n At this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed-air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves. Long horizontal pistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft. The blades of the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed, and the Abraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator-laden escort of some 100 ferries and tenders.*\\n\\n *Author\u0027s Note: Tenders are small steamboats that assist the big liners.\\n\\n The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from 500,000 throats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing the Abraham\\n\\n Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City.\\n\\n The frigate then went along the New Jersey coast--the wonderful right bank of this river, all loaded down with country homes-- and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons. The Abraham Lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting the American flag, whose thirty-nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail; then, changing speed to take the buoy-marked channel that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook, it hugged this sand-covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time.\\n\\n The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.\\n\\n Three o\u0027clock then sounded. The harbor pilot went down into his dinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward. The furnaces were stoked; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly; the frigate skirted the flat, yellow coast of Long Island; and at eight o\u0027clock in the evening, after the lights of Fire Island had vanished into the northwest, we ran at full steam onto the dark waters of the Atlantic.\\n\\n 在收到何伯逊部长的信之前三秒钟，我还像不愿意去北冰洋旅行一样不愿意去追逐海麒麟。读了这位海军部长的来信，三秒钟之后，我才理解到我的真正志愿，我生平的唯一目的，就是要捕捉这样捣乱的怪物，把它从世界上清除出去。\\n\\n 可是我刚刚长途跋涉回来，很疲倦，非常需要休息。我只想回去，回祖国去，看看朋友，看看我在植物园内的小房子和我收藏的珍贵标本。但现在什么也不能阻止我。我忘记了一切，忘记了疲倦、朋友、珍藏，我毫不犹豫就接受了美国政府的邀请。\\n\\n 而且，我还有这样一个想法，反正条条道路都可以回到欧洲，海麒麟也许客客气气地把我引到法国海岸边！这个有名的动物一也许讨我喜欢——要让我在欧洲海中捉到它，那么，我至少也要拿上半米以上的牙戟带给自然科学博物馆。\\n\\n 不过，目前我必须到太平洋的北部去找这个海麒麟，这。\\n\\n 和我要回法国去，却是背道而驰了。\\n\\n \"康塞尔!”我用不耐烦伪声音叫着。\\n\\n 康塞尔是我的仆人。他一向陪我出去旅行。这诚实的青年是佛兰蒙人，我很喜欢他，他对我也很好。他是一个生牲冷淡、循规蹈矩、一贯热心的人，对于生活中的突然事件并不惊奇，他的两手很灵巧，什么事都做得来，虽然他的名字叫做康塞尔（“劝告”的意思），可是人家不问他的时候，他决不发表意见。\\n\\n 因为跟植物园里学术界人士经常接触，康塞尔渐渐学了些东西〕我可以说他简直是一个专家，他对于生物学的分类十分熟悉，他能像杂技演员爬梯子一样熟练地从门、类、纲、亚纲、目、科、属、亚属、种、变种，一直数到最后的一个类别。可是他的学问只局限在分类学上。分类就是他的生活，除此以外他什么都不知道。他对于分类的理论很有研究，但缺乏实践，我想，他大概连大头鲸和长须鲸都分不出来!总之，他是个忠实正直的人：十年来，直到现在，凡我为科学而去的地方，康塞尔都跟我去。他自己从不想到旅行的长久或疲劳。不管有多远，不管去什么地方，去中国或是去刚果，他总是提起他的行李箱立即出发①他到哪里去都一样，连问也不问。他身体健康，肌肉结实，不在乎疾病，一点也不神经质，就是好像不会用脑子似的，至于思考能力，那就更谈不到了。\\n\\n 这个人二十岁了，他的年龄跟他主人的年龄的比例是十五比二十。请读者原谅我用这种说法来说我现在是四十岁可是康塞尔有1缺点，过份讲究礼貌，他总是用第三人称跟我说话，有时甚至叫人听了厌烦.“康塞尔！”我又叫了一声，我手里忙着准备出发的行装.当然，对于这样一个忠心的仆人我是信任的。通常我从不问他是不是愿意跟我去旅行，但这次旅行有点不同，是一次期限可以无限延长的远征，是凶多吉少的冒险，是追赶能像敲碎核桃壳一样撞沉一艘二级战舰的动物：就是最没有感觉的人，对这问题也得考虑考虑吧！康塞尔会有什么意见呢？\\n\\n “康塞尔!”我第三次叫他。\\n\\n 康塞尔出来了。”\\n\\n “先生，叫我吗？”他进来的时候说。\\n\\n “是我叫你。快给我准备，你自己也赶快准备，我们两小时以后就要出发。”\\n\\n “随您先生的便。”康塞尔安静地回答。\\n\\n “一点时间也不能放过。所有的旅行用具、衣服、衬衣，袜子，都不必点数，”尽量地拿了，放在我的大箱里，快，赶快！”\\n\\n “先生的标本怎么办呢？”康塞尔说。\\n\\n “以后再整理好了。”\\n\\n “先生的那些奇形怪状的动物、植物，大马、大蛇以及其他骨胳，又怎么办呢?\"暂时寄放在旅馆里.\"“先生的那只活野猪呢？，“我们不在的时候，托人喂它。另外还要托人将我们的那群动物运回法国去。，“我们不回巴黎去吗？”康塞尔问。\\n\\n “当然……要回去……”我含糊地回答，“不过要绕一个弯。”\\n\\n “先生，您喜欢绕这个弯？”\\n\\n “呵！那算不了什么！不过是一条不那么直捷的路而已。我们要搭林肯号出发。，“只要先生觉得合适就成了。”康塞尔安然地回答。\\n\\n “朋友，你知道，这是关于那个怪物的问题……那条有名的独角鲸的问题……我们要把它从海上清除出去！……两本人开本的著作《海底的神秘》的作者。不能不跟法拉古司令一同出发。这是光荣的任务，但是……也是危险的任务！我们不晓得要到什么地方去！这怪物可能很任性！但我们仍然要去！我们船上有一位眼光敏锐的舰长！……”\\n\\n “先生怎么做，我就怎么做。”康塞尔回答。\\n\\n “你好好想一想，因为我对你什么也不隐瞒。这次旅行也许是最后一次，说不定口不来哩！”\\n\\n “随您先生的便。”\\n\\n 一刻钟以后，康塞尔把箱子整理好了，我相信什么也不会缺少，因为这个人对衬衣和衣服的分类，跟对鸟类或哺乳类动物的分类一样能干。\\n\\n 旅馆的升降机把我们送到二楼下的大厅中。我步行数级，到了地面一层，在常有一大群人围住的大柜台上，我算清了账目，付了钱。我托人把一捆一捆打好包的动、植物标本运回巴黎（法国），还留下一笔钱，托人喂养我的野猪。\\n\\n 僚塞尔跟着我走出了旅馆，上了一辆马车。\\n\\n 马车从百老汇路直到团结广场，再经过第四号路到包法利街的十字路口，走人加上林街，停在三十四号码头，这一趟车费是二十法郎。码头边，加上林轮渡把我们（人、马和车）送到布洛克林。布洛克林是纽约的一个区，位于东河左岸，走了几分钟，我们便抵达停泊林肯号的码头，林肯号的两座烟囱正喷出浓密的黑烟。\\n\\n 立刻有人把我们的行李搬到达艘大船的甲板上。我赶紧上船，问法拉古司令在什么地方。一个水手领我到船尾楼上见他。这位军官气色很好，他向我伸手，对我说：“彼埃尔，阿龙纳斯先生吗？”\\n\\n “对，”我答，“您是法拉古司令吗？”\\n\\n ①是。欢迎欢迎，教授。您的舱房早等着您了。”\\n\\n 我行个礼，让司令去作开船的准备，另外有人领我到给我预备的舱房。\\n\\n 林肯号是为着它的新目标而特选和装备好的。它是一般速度很快的二级战舰，装有高压蒸汽机，可以使气压增加到七个大气压力。在这个压力下，林肯号的速度平均可以达到每小时十八点三海里，这是很快的速度，但跟那只巨大的鲸鱼类动物搏斗还是不够的。\\n\\n 战舰内部的装备完全合乎这次航海任务的要求。我很满意我所住的舱房，它位于船的后部，房门对着军官们的餐室.“我们这舱房很舒服。”我对康塞尔说。\\n\\n “先生不要见怪，一康塞尔回答，“住在这里跟寄生蟹住在海螺壳中一样舒服。\"我留下康塞尔安顿我们的箱子，独自一个人上了甲板，观看准备开船的操作。这时候，法拉古舰长正要人解开布洛克林码头缆柱上拴住林肯号的最后几根铁索。看来如果我迟到一刻钟，半刻钟，船就会开走，我也就不能参加这次出奇的、神秘的、难以相信的远征了。这次远征的经过，虽然是真实记录，将来可能还会有人怀疑的。法拉古舰长不愿意耽搁一天甚至一小时，他要赶快把船开到那个动物所在的海中。他把船上的工程师叫来了。“蒸汽烧足了吗？”舰长问他。\\n\\n “烧足了，舰长。”工程师答。\\n\\n “开船！”法拉古舰长喊。\\n\\n 开船的命令通过话筒传到机器房，轮机人员接到命令，立即让机轮转动起来。蒸汽涌入半开的机关中；发出呼呼的啸声。一排排横列的活塞发出格格的声响，推动机轴的杠杆。推进器的轮翼不断加大速率，搅动海水，于是林肯号在上百只满载观众前来送别的渡轮和汽艇的行列中，庄严地向前行驶着、布洛克林码头和东河沿岸的整个纽约地区都挤满了好奇的人们。从五千万人胸中发出的欢呼声，震动了天地。\\n\\n 成千上万块手帕在挤得紧紧的群众头上招展，不停地向林肯号敬礼，直到船抵达赫德森河口，纽约城所在的长形半岛的尖端，人群才渐渐散去。、“这时候，大船沿着新西州海岸行驶，河的右岸都是别墅，从炮台中间穿过时，炮台鸣礼炮向大船致敬。林肯号方了向它们答礼，把美国国旗连升三次，那三＋九颗星在后桅。横木上闪闪发光。后来大船改变方向，驶进设有浮标的航道。大船掠过沙洲，洲上有数千观众，对船作最后一次的欢呼。护送大船的渡轮和汽艇老是紧跟着行驶，直到灯船附近，有两道灯光标明纽约航路的出口的地方，它们才离开大船回去。这时正是下午三点。领港人从大船下来，上了他的小。艇，驶到在下风等着他的一艘小快船那边。煤火添起来了，机轮更急地搅动水波，大船沿长岛低低的黄色海岸行驶，在晚间八点的时候，西北方不见了火岛的灯光，船便开足马力，在大西洋黑沉沉的波涛上奔驰了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/273.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
