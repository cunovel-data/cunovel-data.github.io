{"id":13876,"no":21,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 21","content":"STEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me. Ned Land tested the soil with his foot, as if he were laying claim to it. Yet it had been only two months since we had become, as Captain Nemo expressed it, \"passengers on the Nautilus,\" in other words, the literal prisoners of its commander.\n In a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast. The soil was almost entirely madreporic, but certain dry stream beds were strewn with granite rubble, proving that this island was of primordial origin. The entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful forests. Enormous trees, sometimes as high as 200 feet, were linked to each other by garlands of tropical creepers, genuine natural hammocks that swayed in a mild breeze. There were mimosas, banyan trees, beefwood, teakwood, hibiscus, screw pines, palm trees, all mingling in wild profusion; and beneath the shade of their green canopies, at the feet of their gigantic trunks, there grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.\n Meanwhile, ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora, the Canadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional. He spotted a coconut palm, beat down some of its fruit, broke them open, and we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was a protest against our standard fare on the Nautilus.\n \"Excellent!\" Ned Land said.\n \"Exquisite!\" Conseil replied.\n \"And I don\u0027t think,\" the Canadian said, \"that your Nemo would object to us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel?\"\n \"I imagine not,\" I replied, \"but he won\u0027t want to sample them.\"\n \"Too bad for him!\" Conseil said.\n \"And plenty good for us!\" Ned Land shot back. \"There\u0027ll be more left over!\"\n \"A word of caution, Mr. Land,\" I told the harpooner, who was about to ravage another coconut palm. \"Coconuts are admirable things, but before we stuff the skiff with them, it would be wise to find out whether this island offers other substances just as useful. Some fresh vegetables would be well received in the Nautilus\u0027s pantry.\"\n \"Master is right,\" Conseil replied, \"and I propose that we set aside three places in our longboat: one for fruit, another for vegetables, and a third for venison, of which I still haven\u0027t glimpsed the tiniest specimen.\"\n \"Don\u0027t give up so easily, Conseil,\" the Canadian replied.\n \"So let\u0027s continue our excursion,\" I went on, \"but keep a sharp lookout. This island seems uninhabited, but it still might harbor certain individuals who aren\u0027t so finicky about the sort of game they eat!\"\n \"Hee hee!\" Ned put in, with a meaningful movement of his jaws.\n \"Ned! Oh horrors!\" Conseil exclaimed.\n \"Ye gods,\" the Canadian shot back, \"I\u0027m starting to appreciate the charms of cannibalism!\"\n \"Ned, Ned! Don\u0027t say that!\" Conseil answered. \"You a cannibal? Why, I\u0027ll no longer be safe next to you, I who share your cabin! Does this mean I\u0027ll wake up half devoured one fine day?\"\n \"I\u0027m awfully fond of you, Conseil my friend, but not enough to eat you when there\u0027s better food around.\"\n \"Then I daren\u0027t delay,\" Conseil replied. \"The hunt is on! We absolutely must bag some game to placate this man-eater, or one of these mornings master won\u0027t find enough pieces of his manservant to serve him.\"\n While exchanging this chitchat, we entered beneath the dark canopies of the forest, and for two hours we explored it in every direction.\n We couldn\u0027t have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation, and some of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied us with a valuable foodstuff missing on board.\n I mean the breadfruit tree, which is quite abundant on Gueboroa Island, and there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in Malaysia is called \"rima.\"\n This tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high. To the naturalist\u0027s eye, its gracefully rounded crown, formed of big multilobed leaves, was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands east of\n Madagascar. From its mass of greenery, huge globular fruit stood out, a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern. It\u0027s a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat; without needing to be cultivated, it bears fruit eight months out of the year.\n Ned Land was on familiar terms with this fruit. He had already eaten it on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance. So the very sight of it aroused his appetite, and he couldn\u0027t control himself.\n \"Sir,\" he told me, \"I\u0027ll die if I don\u0027t sample a little breadfruit pasta!\"\n \"Sample some, Ned my friend, sample all you like. We\u0027re here to conduct experiments, let\u0027s conduct them.\"\n \"It won\u0027t take a minute,\" the Canadian replied.\n Equipped with a magnifying glass, he lit a fire of deadwood that was soon crackling merrily. Meanwhile Conseil and I selected the finest artocarpus fruit. Some still weren\u0027t ripe enough, and their thick skins covered white, slightly fibrous pulps. But a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous, just begging to be picked.\n This fruit contained no pits. Conseil brought a dozen of them to Ned Land, who cut them into thick slices and placed them over a fire of live coals, all the while repeating:\n \"You\u0027ll see, sir, how tasty this bread is!\"\n \"Especially since we\u0027ve gone without baked goods for so long,\" Conseil said.\n \"It\u0027s more than just bread,\" the Canadian added. \"It\u0027s a dainty pastry. You\u0027ve never eaten any, sir?\"\n \"No, Ned.\"\n \"All right, get ready for something downright delectable! If you don\u0027t come back for seconds, I\u0027m no longer the King of Harpooners!\"\n After a few minutes, the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were completely toasted. On the inside there appeared some white pasta, a sort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke.\n This bread was excellent, I must admit, and I ate it with great pleasure.\n \"Unfortunately,\" I said, \"this pasta won\u0027t stay fresh, so it seems pointless to make a supply for on board.\"\n \"By thunder, sir!\" Ned Land exclaimed. \"There you go, talking like a naturalist, but meantime I\u0027ll be acting like a baker! Conseil, harvest some of this fruit to take with us when we go back.\"\n \"And how will you prepare it?\" I asked the Canadian.\n \"I\u0027ll make a fermented batter from its pulp that\u0027ll keep indefinitely without spoiling. When I want some, I\u0027ll just cook it in the galley on board--it\u0027ll have a slightly tart flavor, but you\u0027ll find it excellent.\"\n \"So, Mr. Ned, I see that this bread is all we need--\"\n \"Not quite, professor,\" the Canadian replied. \"We need some fruit to go with it, or at least some vegetables.\"\n \"Then let\u0027s look for fruit and vegetables.\"\n When our breadfruit harvesting was done, we took to the trail to complete this \"dry-land dinner.\"\n We didn\u0027t search in vain, and near noontime we had an ample supply of bananas. This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens all year round, and Malaysians, who give them the name \"pisang,\" eat them without bothering to cook them. In addition to bananas, we gathered some enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor, some tasty mangoes, and some pineapples of unbelievable size. But this foraging took up a good deal of our time, which, even so, we had no cause to regret.\n Conseil kept Ned under observation. The harpooner walked in the lead, and during his stroll through this forest, he gathered with sure hands some excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions.\n \"So,\" Conseil asked, \"you have everything you need, Ned my friend?\"\n \"Humph!\" the Canadian put in.\n \"What! You\u0027re complaining?\"\n \"All this vegetation doesn\u0027t make a meal,\" Ned replied. \"Just side dishes, dessert. But where\u0027s the soup course? Where\u0027s the roast?\"\n \"Right,\" I said. \"Ned promised us cutlets, which seems highly questionable to me.\"\n \"Sir,\" the Canadian replied, \"our hunting not only isn\u0027t over, it hasn\u0027t even started. Patience! We\u0027re sure to end up bumping into some animal with either feathers or fur, if not in this locality, then in another.\"\n \"And if not today, then tomorrow, because we mustn\u0027t wander too far off,\" Conseil added. \"That\u0027s why I propose that we return to the skiff.\"\n \"What! Already!\" Ned exclaimed.\n \"We ought to be back before nightfall,\" I said.\n \"But what hour is it, then?\" the Canadian asked.\n \"Two o\u0027clock at least,\" Conseil replied.\n \"How time flies on solid ground!\" exclaimed Mr. Ned Land with a sigh of regret.\n \"Off we go!\" Conseil replied.\n So we returned through the forest, and we completed our harvest by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from the crowns of their trees, some small beans that I recognized as the \"abrou\" of the Malaysians, and some high-quality yams.\n We were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff. However, Ned Land still found these provisions inadequate. But fortune smiled on him. Just as we were boarding, he spotted several trees twenty-five to thirty feet high, belonging to the palm species. As valuable as the artocarpus, these trees are justly ranked among the most useful produce in Malaysia.\n They were sago palms, vegetation that grows without being cultivated; like mulberry trees, they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds.\n Ned Land knew how to handle these trees. Taking his ax and wielding it with great vigor, he soon stretched out on the ground two or three sago palms, whose maturity was revealed by the white dust sprinkled over their palm fronds.\n I watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger. He began by removing from each trunk an inch-thick strip of bark that covered a network of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied with a sort of gummy flour. This flour was the starch-like sago, an edible substance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples.\n For the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into pieces, as if he were making firewood; later he would extract the flour by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous ligaments, let it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside molds.\n Finally, at five o\u0027clock in the afternoon, laden with all our treasures, we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the Nautilus. Nobody appeared on our arrival. The enormous sheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted. Our provisions loaded on board, I went below to my stateroom. There I found my supper ready. I ate and then fell asleep.\n The next day, January 6: nothing new on board. Not a sound inside, not a sign of life. The skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it. We decided to return to Gueboroa Island. Ned Land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before, and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest.\n By sunrise we were off. Carried by an inbound current, the longboat reached the island in a matter of moments.\n We disembarked, and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian\u0027s instincts, we followed Ned Land, whose long legs threatened to outpace us.\n Ned Land went westward up the coast; then, fording some stream beds, he reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests. Some kingfishers lurked along the watercourses, but they didn\u0027t let us approach. Their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species, and I concluded that if this island wasn\u0027t inhabited, at least human beings paid it frequent visits.\n After crossing a pretty lush prairie, we arrived on the outskirts of a small wood, enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large number of birds.\n \"Still, they\u0027re merely birds,\" Conseil said.\n \"But some are edible,\" the harpooner replied.\n \"Wrong, Ned my friend,\" Conseil answered, \"because I see only ordinary parrots here.\"\n \"Conseil my friend,\" Ned replied in all seriousness, \"parrots are like pheasant to people with nothing else on their plates.\"\n \"And I might add,\" I said, \"that when these birds are properly cooked, they\u0027re at least worth a stab of the fork.\"\n Indeed, under the dense foliage of this wood, a whole host of parrots fluttered from branch to branch, needing only the proper upbringing to speak human dialects. At present they were cackling in chorus with parakeets of every color, with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be pondering some philosophical problem, while bright red lories passed by like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze, in the midst of kalao parrots raucously on the wing, Papuan lories painted the subtlest shades of azure, and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures, none terribly edible.\n However, one bird unique to these shores, which never passes beyond the boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands, was missing from this collection. But I was given a chance to marvel at it soon enough.\n After crossing through a moderately dense thicket, we again found some plains obstructed by bushes. There I saw some magnificent birds soaring aloft, the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to head into the wind. Their undulating flight, the grace of their aerial curves, and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye. I had no trouble identifying them.\n \"Birds of paradise!\" I exclaimed.\n \"Order Passeriforma, division Clystomora,\" Conseil replied.\n \"Partridge family?\" Ned Land asked.\n \"I doubt it, Mr. Land. Nevertheless, I\u0027m counting on your dexterity to catch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!\"\n \"I\u0027ll give it a try, professor, though I\u0027m handier with a harpoon than a rifle.\"\n Malaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese, have various methods for catching them that we couldn\u0027t use. Sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit. At other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements. They will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink. But in our case, all we could do was fire at them on the wing, which left us little chance of getting one. And in truth, we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain.\n Near eleven o\u0027clock in the morning, we cleared the lower slopes of the mountains that form the island\u0027s center, and we still hadn\u0027t bagged a thing. Hunger spurred us on. The hunters had counted on consuming the proceeds of their hunting, and they had miscalculated. Luckily, and much to his surprise, Conseil pulled off a right-and-left shot and insured our breakfast. He brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove, which were briskly plucked, hung from a spit, and roasted over a blazing fire of deadwood. While these fascinating animals were cooking, Ned prepared some bread from the artocarpus. Then the pigeon and ringdove were devoured to the bones and declared excellent. Nutmeg, on which these birds habitually gorge themselves, sweetens their flesh and makes it delicious eating.\n \"They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles,\" Conseil said.\n \"All right, Ned,\" I asked the Canadian, \"now what do you need?\"\n \"Game with four paws, Professor Aronnax,\" Ned Land replied. \"All these pigeons are only appetizers, snacks. So till I\u0027ve bagged an animal with cutlets, I won\u0027t be happy!\"\n \"Nor I, Ned, until I\u0027ve caught a bird of paradise.\"\n \"Then let\u0027s keep hunting,\" Conseil replied, \"but while heading back to the sea. We\u0027ve arrived at the foothills of these mountains, and I think we\u0027ll do better if we return to the forest regions.\"\n It was good advice and we took it. After an hour\u0027s walk we reached a genuine sago palm forest. A few harmless snakes fled underfoot. Birds of paradise stole off at our approach, and I was in real despair of catching one when Conseil, walking in the lead, stooped suddenly, gave a triumphant shout, and came back to me, carrying a magnificent bird of paradise.\n \"Oh bravo, Conseil!\" I exclaimed.\n \"Master is too kind,\" Conseil replied.\n \"Not at all, my boy. That was a stroke of genius, catching one of these live birds with your bare hands!\"\n \"If master will examine it closely, he\u0027ll see that I deserve no great praise.\"\n \"And why not, Conseil?\"\n \"Because this bird is as drunk as a lord.\"\n \"Drunk?\"\n \"Yes, master, drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that nutmeg tree where I caught it. See, Ned my friend, see the monstrous results of intemperance!\"\n \"Damnation!\" the Canadian shot back. \"Considering the amount of gin I\u0027ve had these past two months, you\u0027ve got nothing to complain about!\"\n Meanwhile I was examining this unusual bird. Conseil was not mistaken. Tipsy from that potent juice, our bird of paradise had been reduced to helplessness. It was unable to fly. It was barely able to walk. But this didn\u0027t alarm me, and I just let it sleep off its nutmeg.\n This bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to Papua and its neighboring islands. It was a \"great emerald,\" one of the rarest birds of paradise. It measured three decimeters long. Its head was comparatively small, and its eyes, placed near the opening of its beak, were also small. But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues: a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, hazel wings with purple tips, pale yellow head and scruff of the neck, emerald throat, the belly and chest maroon to brown. Two strands, made of a horn substance covered with down, rose over its tail, which was lengthened by long, very light feathers of wonderful fineness, and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named \"the sun bird.\"\n How I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris, to make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens, which doesn\u0027t own a single live specimen.\n \"So it must be a rarity or something?\" the Canadian asked, in the tone of a hunter who, from the viewpoint of his art, gives the game a pretty low rating.\n \"A great rarity, my gallant comrade, and above all very hard to capture alive. And even after they\u0027re dead, there\u0027s still a major market for these birds. So the natives have figured out how to create fake ones, like people create fake pearls or diamonds.\"\n \"What!\" Conseil exclaimed. \"They make counterfeit birds of paradise?\"\n \"Yes, Conseil.\"\n \"And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?\"\n \"Perfectly familiar. During the easterly monsoon season, birds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that naturalists call \u0027below-the-wing\u0027 feathers. These feathers are gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor previously mutilated parakeet. Then they paint over the suture, varnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors to museums and collectors in Europe.\"\n \"Good enough!\" Ned Land put in. \"If it isn\u0027t the right bird, it\u0027s still the right feathers, and so long as the merchandise isn\u0027t meant to be eaten, I see no great harm!\"\n But if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of paradise, those of our Canadian huntsman remained unsatisfied. Luckily, near two o\u0027clock Ned Land brought down a magnificent wild pig of the type the natives call \"bari-outang.\" This animal came in the nick of time for us to bag some real quadruped meat, and it was warmly welcomed. Ned Land proved himself quite gloriously with his gunshot. Hit by an electric bullet, the pig dropped dead on the spot.\n The Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it, after removing half a dozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our evening meal. Then the hunt was on again, and once more would be marked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil.\n In essence, beating the bushes, the two friends flushed a herd of kangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws. But these animals didn\u0027t flee so swiftly that our electric capsules couldn\u0027t catch up with them.\n \"Oh, professor!\" shouted Ned Land, whose hunting fever had gone to his brain. \"What excellent game, especially in a stew! What a supply for the Nautilus! Two, three, five down! And just think how we\u0027ll devour all this meat ourselves, while those numbskulls on board won\u0027t get a shred!\"\n In his uncontrollable glee, I think the Canadian might have slaughtered the whole horde, if he hadn\u0027t been so busy talking! But he was content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials, which make up the first order of aplacental mammals, as Conseil just had to tell us.\n These animals were small in stature. They were a species of those \"rabbit kangaroos\" that usually dwell in the hollows of trees and are tremendously fast; but although of moderate dimensions, they at least furnish a meat that\u0027s highly prized.\n We were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting. A gleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island, which he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped. But he was reckoning without events.\n By six o\u0027clock in the evening, we were back on the beach. The skiff was aground in its usual place. The Nautilus, looking like a long reef, emerged from the waves two miles offshore.\n Without further ado, Ned Land got down to the important business of dinner. He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking. Grilling over the coals, those cutlets from the \"bari-outang\" soon gave off a succulent aroma that perfumed the air.\n But I catch myself following in the Canadian\u0027s footsteps. Look at me--in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork! Please grant me a pardon as I\u0027ve already granted one to Mr. Land, and on the same grounds!\n In short, dinner was excellent. Two ringdoves rounded out this extraordinary menu. Sago pasta, bread from the artocarpus, mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the fermented liquor from certain coconuts heightened our glee. I suspect that my two fine companions weren\u0027t quite as clearheaded as one could wish.\n \"What if we don\u0027t return to the Nautilus this evening?\" Conseil said.\n \"What if we never return to it?\" Ned Land added.\n Just then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut short the harpooner\u0027s proposition.\n 几分钟后，我们和岛岸只有枪弹射程的距离了。土地差不多完全是由造礁珊瑚沉积形成的，但有些干涸了的急流河床，间杂有花岗石的残余，说明这岛的形成是在原始的太古时期。整个天际都由令人赞美的森林帘幕遮掩起来。许多高大的树——其中有些树干高达二百英尺——由葛藤把它们彼此连接起来，看来真像和风摇摆着的天然吊床呢。这是合欢树、无花果树、火鸟树、麻栗树、木芙蓉、班达树、棕树,枝叶茂盛的混杂起来.在这些树的青绿窟窿下.在它们的 的齿形树干脚边，丛生许多兰科、豆科、蕨科植物。\n 可是，加拿大人并不注意巴布亚土生植物的美丽品种，他抛开了美丽的，去追求实际有用的。他看见一棵椰子树，打下树上好几个椰子，劈开来，我们喝了里面的汁、吃了里面的肉, 心中感到满意，这正说明了我们对于诺第留斯号船上家常饭食的不满。\n “好吃得很！”尼德·兰说。\n “味道真美！”康塞尔回答。\n “我想，”加拿大人说，“我们把这些果品带回船上去，您那个尼摩不至于反对吧？”\n “我想他不至于反对，”我回答，“不过他一定不吃。”\n “活该他没口福！”康塞尔说。\n “我们倒可以多吃了！”尼德·兰回答，“因为那样剩下来的才更多。”\n “我告诉您一句话，尼德·兰师傅，”我对这个鱼叉手说，他又要打另一棵椰子树了，“椰子是好吃的东西，但不要马上把小艇都装满了椰子，先考察一下岛上是否还出产别的东西，一些又好吃又有用的东西，这才是聪明的办法。譬如新鲜的蔬菜，诺第留斯号船上的厨房一定很欢迎。”\n “先生说得有理，”康塞尔回答，“我提议把我们小艇分成三部分，一部分放水果，一部分放蔬菜，一部分放猎物。可是一直到现在，连野味的影子还没有看见呢.\"\n “康塞尔，对刊·么都不应该失望。”加拿大人回答。\n “那么，我们继续走吧，”我说，“不过眼睛要留神，要四处张望。虽然岛上看来没有人居住，但很可能有些生人，他们对于猪物性质的看法可能跟我们不同！肌\n “嘻：嘻! 尼德·兰发出怪声，摆动着上下两颚的牙床，作出意义明显的表示。\n “尼德·兰，您怎么啦——”康塞尔喊。\n “说真的，”加拿大人回答，“我现在开始懂得人肉味的诱惑力了！”\n “尼德！尼德！您说的什么？”康塞尔问，“您，吃人肉的动物！那我，跟您住在一个舱房，在您身边，简直性命都不安全了!难道我会一天醒来, 身子被咬去了一半吗？”\n “康塞尔好朋友，我很喜欢您：，但不到紧要关头我不吃你.\"\n “这我不敢相信——”康塞尔回答，“快打猎去！我一定要打到一些猎物来满足这吃人肉的人的口腹，不然的话，总有一天早晨，先生只能看见他仆人一块一块的肉来服侍他了。”\n 当我们彼此说笑话，交换一些意见的时候，我们穿人了森林的阴沉的穹窿下，只有两小时的功夫，我们四面八方都走遍了。\n 偶然的意外满足了我们的心愿，使我们找到了许多可食的植物，其中一种是热带地区最有用的产品，它成了我们船上所没有的宝贵食物。我说的是面包树，在格波罗尔岛上，这种树非常多，我特别留心那没有核仁的一种，马来亚语管它叫“利马”。\n 这种树跟别的树不同的地方是它的树干笔直，有四十英尺高。树顶十分美丽，作环形，由耳珠很多的阔大树叶组成，在一个生物学家看来，充分地显示出这是“面包果树”，很运气的是这树在马斯卡林群岛已经移植成功了。在团团的青绿丛中，垂下粗大的球形果子，约一分米大，外表凹凸不平，好像六角形。这是大自然恩赐给不产麦地区的有用植物，不用耕种，一年中有八个月都结面包果供应人们。\n 尼德·兰很熟悉这些面包果。他从前在多次旅行中已经吃过了，他很知道怎样调制这种可吃的东西。所以看见这些果子，马上就引起他的食欲，他再也忍耐不住了。\n “先生，”他跟我说，“如果我不尝一尝这面包树的面条子，真要急死我了！”\n “尝尝吧，尼德·兰好朋友，您随意尝吧。我们是到这里来获得经验的，那我们就试试看吧。”\n “那费不了很多的时间.\"加拿大人回答。\n 他于是拿了火镜，利用阳光，把干树枝点着，火光熊熊燃烧起来了。这个时候，康塞尔和我选了面包树上最好的果子摘下来。有些还没有到足够成熟的程度，厚的表皮上蒙了一层白肉，但很少带纤维。其他的大多数变黄了，有粘性了，只等人去摘了。\n 这些果子并没有核仁。康塞尔拿了十二三个给尼德。兰，他把它们切成厚片，放在红火上，当他切片的时候，总是说：\n “您瞧吧，先生，这面包是多么好吃呢！”\n “特别是我们很久都没有吃面包了！”康塞尔说。\n 加拿大人又说：“甚至于可以说，这并不是平常的面包，而是美味的糕点。先生，您从来没有吃过吗？”\n “没有吃过，尼德。”\n “那么，您快作准备，来尝尝这别有风味的东西吧。如果您吃了不再要的话，那我就不是天字第一号鱼叉手了。·\n 几分钟后，果子向着红火的部分已经完全烤焦了。里面露出白粉条，好像又软又嫩的面包屑，吃起来像百叶菜的味儿。\n 应当承认，这面包很好吃，我很喜欢吃。\n “可惜这样一种好面团不能长久保持新鲜，””我说／孜想用不着拿回船上去作贮藏的食品了。”\n “真的吗，先生！”尼德·兰喊，“您是拿生物学家的身份来说这话；但我要拿制面包人的身份来作事。康塞尔，您去摘取这些果子，我们回去的时候可以带走。”\n “您怎样把这些果子制作起来呢？”我问加拿大人。\n “拿这果子的淀粉泥制成发面团，那就可以长久保存，不至于腐败。当我要食用的时候，到船上厨房里一烤使得，虽然有些酸味，但您一定觉得它很好吃。”\n “尼德·兰师傅，那么，有了这面包，看来我们是不短什么了吧？……”\n “还短些东西，教授，”加拿大人回答，“还短些水果，至少还短些蔬菜！”\n “我们找水果和蔬菜去。”\n 当我们摘完了面包果，我们就去寻找，要把我们的“地上”午餐丰富完备起来。\n 我们的寻找并没有白费功夫，到中午左右，我们得到大量的香蕉。这种热带地方的美昧产物，长年都有，马来亚人叫它们“比桑”，意思是生吃，不必熟煮。跟香蕉一起，我们又得到味道很辛烈的巨大雅克果，很甜的芒果和大到难以相信的菠萝。这次采水果费了我们一大部分时间，但成绩很好，并没有什么可惋惜的。\n 康塞尔总是随着尼德·兰。鱼叉手在前走，当他在树林中走过的时候，他手法熟练，总能采到很好吃的果子，把贮藏的食品更加丰富起来。\n 康塞尔问：“尼德·兰好朋友，我们再也不短什么了吧？”\n “嗯！”加拿大人表示不耐烦地说。\n “怎么！您还不满足吗？”\n “所有这些植物都不能成为正式的整餐，”尼德·兰回答，“那是整餐最后的莱，那是餐后的点心。可是汤在哪儿呢？肉在哪儿呢？”\n “对呀，”我说，“尼德答应我的排骨，看来很成问题了。”\n “先生，”加拿大人回答，“打猎不但没有结束，而是还没有开始呢。耐心些！我们一定可以碰到一些有羽毛的动物，如果这一处没有，另一处一定有……”\n \"如果今天碰不着，明天一定可以碰着，”康塞尔补充说，“因为我们不应走得过远。我要提议回小艇中去了.\"\n “什么！就要回去了！”尼德·兰喊。\n “我们在黑夜到来之前一定要回去.\"我说。\n \"那现在是什么时候呢?\"加拿大人问。\n “至少是午后两点了。”康塞尔回答。\n “在地上过的时间真快呵！”尼德·兰师傅带着惋惜的叹声说。\n “走吧。”康塞尔回答。\n 我们从林中穿回来，我们又得到了新的食品，因为我们临时又采摘了菜棕搁果，这果一定要到树顶上去采，我认出是马来亚人叫做“阿布卢，的小豆，以及上等品质的芋薯。\n 当我们到了小 艇，我们带回的东西实在太多了。可是尼德，兰觉得他的食物还不够。算他走运，他又得了些东西。在我们上小艇的时候，他看见好几棵树，高二十五英尺至三十英尺，属于棕搁一类。这些树跟面包树一样有用，一样宝贵，正是马来亚地方最有用的产物之一。这是西米树，是不用种植就生长起来的植物，像桑树那样，由于自己的嫩枝和种子，不需人工，自然繁殖滋长。\n 尼德·兰知道对付这些树的方法。他拿出斧子，挥动起来，不久就把两三棵西米树砍倒在地下，从洒在叶上的白粉屑来看，这几棵树是很成熟了。\n 我看着他砍树，与其说是拿饿肚人的眼光看，不如说是拿生物学家的眼光看。他把每一根树干剥去一层厚一英寸的表皮，表皮下面是缠绕作一团的结子所组成的长长纤维网，上面就粘着胶质护膜般的细粉。这粉就是西米，就是作为美拉尼西亚居民粮食的主要食物。\n 尼德·兰此刻只是把树干砍成片，像他砍那要烧的劈柴一般，准备将来提取树干上的粉，让粉通过一块薄布，使它跟纤维丝分开，把它晾在太阳下，让水汽干了，然后把它放在模中，让它凝固起来。\n 到了下午五点的时候，我们装上我们所得的财富，离开了这岛的海岸，半小时后，我们的小艇又靠在诺第留斯号旁边了。我们到船上的时候，没有一个人出来。这只巨大钢铁板的圆锥筒好像是没有人管，被抛弃了的一般。我们把食物搬上去之后，我就下到我的房间中。我看见晚餐已经摆在房中。我吃了饭，便睡觉。\n 第二天，1月6日，船上没有什么消息。内部没有一点声响，没有一点生气。小艇仍然停在诺第留斯号旁边，就在我们昨天搁下它的地方。我们决定再到格波罗尔岛上去。尼德。兰希望在打猎方面，今天能比昨天运气好一点，他想到树林的另一部分去看一下。\n 太阳升起来的时候，我们已经在小艇上了。小艇因有向岛岸冲击的海浪推送，不一会就到了岛上。\n 我们下了小艇，走上陆地，我想让加拿大人凭直觉来带路或者好一些，因此，我们跟在尼德·兰后面，他的长腿走得很快，时常把我们抛在远远的后面。\n 尼德·兰沿着海岸向西走了一会儿，涉水渡过一些急流，到了高地平原，边缘上尽是令人赞美的树林。有些翠乌在水流边飞来飞去，但它们不让人接近，见人来就飞走。由于它们的小心警惕，我明白这些飞禽是很知道怎样对付我们这些两足动物的，我于是得到结论，即使这岛上没有居民，至少也是常有生人到岛上来。\n 穿过了一片相当广大的草原，我们来到一座小树林的边缘，林中有许多禽鸟飞舞歌唱，显得生气洋溢。\n “这还不过是一些禽鸟呢。”康塞尔说。\n \"但里面也有可吃的呢!\"鱼叉手回答。\n “没有，尼德好朋友，”康塞尔回答，“因为我看见那里仅有一些鹦鹅.\"\n ，‘康塞尔好朋友，”尼德·兰严肃地回答，“对没有别的东西吃的人来说，鹦鹉就等于山鸡。”\n “再说，，，我说，“这种鸟烹调得好，也很值得动刀叉。”\n 正是这样，在树林的浓密树叶底下，一大群鹦鹉在树枝间飞来飞去，只要细心地教育它们，便可以说人类的语言了。目前它们只是陪着所有各种颜色的雌鹦鹅，叽叽喳喳说个不休：有神气严肃的五彩鹦鹉，好像在思考些哲学问题；有大红色的赤鹦鹉，在飞时作响声的加罗西鹦鹅电间，好像一块随凤飘荡的红纱；有染上最美的天蓝色的巴布亚樱鹅，以及各种各样的美丽可爱的飞禽，但一般来看，都是属于不可食用的一类。\n 但是，这地方特产的一种鸟，它从不走过阿卢群岛和巴布亚群岛的边界，现在在这一群禽鸟中我并没有看到。命运暂时把这鸟保留起来，但不久我就能欣赏它了。\n 穿过了一座不很浓密的丛林，我们又到了一片有许多树丛堆垛着的平原。我看到了好些华丽的鸟飞在空中，它们身上很长的羽毛使它们一定要逆凤才能飞行。它们的波状起伏的飞行，它们在空中的优美曲线，它们鲜艳夺目的色泽，吸引了和迷惑了人们的眼睛。我一点不困难就认出是它们来了。\n “无双鸟，无双鸟！”我喊。\n “燕雀目，直肠亚目。”康塞尔回答。\n ““鹤鹄科吗?\"尼德·兰问。\n “我想不是，尼德·兰师傅。不过我要靠您的好手段，把这种热带出产的最美丽可爱的东西打下一只来！”\n “我试试，教授，虽然我用惯了鱼叉，使枪要差一些.\"\n 这种乌是马来亚人对中国人的一宗重要贸易；马来亚人用种种不同的方法来捕捉这种鸟，但我们都不能使用。他们或者把罗网安放在无双鸟喜欢居住的高树顶上，或者使用强力的雀胶，使它们粘上不能动。他们甚至于把毒药投到这些鸟经常去喝的泉水中。至于我们现在，只有在它们飞翔时进行射击这一种办法。我们很少有机会可以击中它们。果然我们确实白费了一些弹药。\n 到十一点左右，我们已经走过了构成这岛中心的第：层山脉，可是仍然毫无所得。腹中作响，饥饿煎熬着我们。打猎人相信自己打猎一定有成果，可是错了，一点猎物也得不到。很幸运，康塞尔开了两枪，完全出于意外地获得了午餐的猎物。他打下一只白鸽和一只山鸠。急忙把它们拔掉羽毛，挂在叉子上，放在燃点起来的干木头的旺火上烤着。当烤炙这些很有意味的动物的时候，尼德·兰就调理着面包果。一会儿，白鸽和山鸠连骨头都被吃得精光，大家都说很好吃。这些鸟惯常吃很多的肉豆寇，因此它们的肉像加了香料一般，成为一盘又青又好吃的莱。\n “这味道好像吃香菌长大的母鸡的味儿一般。”康塞尔说。\n “尼德，现在我们还短些什么吗？”我问加拿大人。\n “还短一只四足的猎物，阿龙纳斯先生。”尼德·兰回答，“所有这些鸽子、山鸠都不过是零食和小吃。因此，只要我还没有打到有排骨肉的动物，我就决不能满意.\"\n “尼德，如果我没有捕捉到一只无双鸟，我也不能满意。”\n “那么我们继续打猎吧，\"康塞尔回答，“不过要向大海这一边走。我们已经到了山岭的第一层斜坡，我想再回到森林地带要好些。\n 康塞尔很有见识，我们就照他的意见办了。走了一小时，我们到了一座真正是西米树的森林。有些不伤人的蛇在我们脚下逃走了。无双鸟看见我们走近就飞开。当我十分失望，没有办法捉到它们的时候，走在我前面的康塞尔，忽然弯下身子，发出胜利的呼喊，拿着一只十分好看的无双鸟走近我身边来。\n “好！你成功了！康塞尔.\"我喊。\n “先生，不敢当，您过奖了。”康塞尔回答。\n “不，好小伙子，你真是做了一件出奇的事哩。弄到一只洁的无双鸟，把它捉在手里，真了不得！”\n “如果先生细心地考查它一下，那就可以看到我实在没有什么多大的功劳。”\n “康塞尔，为什么呢？”\n “因为这鸟像鹌鹑一般醉了。”\n “醉了吗？”\n “是的，先生，它在豆寇树下吃豆寇吃醉了，我就在树下把它捉到。尼德好朋友，请您看看这贪吃贪喝、过度任性的可怕结果吧！”\n “怪话！”加拿大人回答，“我这两个月来只是喝了一些真尼酒，实在用不着责备我！”\n 我于是检查一下这只奇异的鸟。康塞尔没有搞错。无双乌被豆寇汁迷醉了，使得它瘫软无力。它不能飞，走路也很困难。但我用不着为它担心，让它好好地睡它的酒后觉就是了。\n 这只无双鸟属于巴布亚和邻近群岛出产的八种无双鸟中最美的一种。这是“大翡翠”无双鸟，最罕有的一种。它有三分米长，头比较小，眼睛也不大，就在嘴近边。它的嘴是黄色，脚爪和指甲是褐色，翼是臻子色，翼端是朱红色，头上和颈后是淡黄色，喉间是翡翠色，腹部和胸部是栗子色，因此，它看来像是十分华丽的各种色彩的综合。而且尾巴上耸起两个角形的绒毛绿球，和很细腻的很轻飘的细长羽毛连接，好像拖垂的长带，于是这一切就把这只奇鸟的整个形象完全美化起来了，所以当地上人很诗意地称它为“太阳的鸟”。\n 我很希望能把这只好看的无双鸟带回巴黎去，送给植物园，因为园中还没有一只活的无双鸟。\n “这鸟真是很罕见吗广加拿大人问，用一种不从美术的观点来估计猎物的口气。\n “十分罕见，我老实的同伴，特别是十分难得捉到活的。就是死了，这些鸟仍然是重要的贸易对象。所以上人想法制造假的，像制造珍珠和钻石一样。”\n “怎么!”康塞尔喊，“有人做假无双鸟吗？”\n “是的，康塞尔。”\n “那么，先生知道土人的制造方法吗?\"\n “知道。当东方的季候凤起来的时候，无双鸟便脱掉了它尾巴周围的美丽羽毛，这些脱下的羽毛，生物学家把它们叫做副翼羽毛。假造鸟类的人把这些羽毛收拾起来，很巧妙地把它们装在预先打死、拔了毛的可怜的鹦鹉身上。然后他们把皮毛接合的地方粘起来，粉饰好鸟身，他们就把这些新奇的制作品送到欧洲各地的博物馆和喜爱鸟类的人。，，\n “好广尼德·兰说，“虽然这不是鸟的本体，但总是鸟的羽毛，如果鸟不是拿来食用，我想也没有什么坏处！”\n 我的欲望虽然因为捕得这只无双鸟得到满足，但加拿：大猎人的欲望还没有得到满足。很运气，在两点左右，尼德·兰打到一只肥大的林中野猪，这是土人叫做“巴利奥唐”的一种猪。这猪正好在我们追求真正四足兽肉的时候到来了，所以它很受欢迎，被留下了。尼德·兰对自己打枪的准确，表示很得意。野猪中了电气弹，倒在地上死了。\n 加拿大人从猪身上割下六七块腰窝肉准备晚上烤着吃，他又把它的皮毛剥去，开膛，清出内脏。然后又来打猎，这次打猎又显出了尼德·兰和康塞尔的劳绩.果然，这一对朋友在搜索树丛的时候，赶出了一大群袋鼠，它们伸开有弹性的腿来，一蹦一跳地逃走。这些动物虽然跳、走得快，但还没有逃远，电气弹已经追上它们了。\n “啊！教授，”尼德·兰喊，他打猎的兴致狂热起来了，“多么好吃的猎物，特别是闷煮起来！在诺第留斯号船上，这是多么难得的食物！两只！三只！五只在地上了！我想到我们要吃所有这些肉的时候，船上的那些蠢东西一点肉渣也尝不到，我真高兴：”\n 我想这个加拿大人，在过度欢喜中，如果他不是说了那么多的话，可能他把这整群的袋鼠都屠杀了！他只打了一打左右就停止了。“这类袋鼠是乎腹哺乳类的第一目。”康塞尔说。这些袋鼠身材短小，是兔袋鼠的一种，通常居住在树洞中，跑得非常快。它们身材虽然不大，可是肉很好吃，被当做一种珍品。\n 我们很满意我们打猎的结果。快乐的尼德·兰提议明夭再到这个迷人的岛上来，他要把所有可以吃的四足动物都打尽，一个不留。但他这样打算，井没有想到就要来的意外事件。 ”\n 下午六点，我们回到了海滩。我们的小艇仍然停在原来的地方。诺第留斯号好像一座很长的礁石：在离岸两海里的海面现出来。\n 尼德·兰一点也不耽搁，立即准备晚餐这件大事。“巴利奥唐”野猪的腰窝肉烤在红火上，不久即发出一种很香的气味，空中都充满香味了！……\n 我觉得我也跟加拿大人是同道了。面对着这些新鲜的烤肉，我也大乐起来！请大家原谅我，像我原谅过尼德·兰师傅一样，完全是由于同样的理由!\n 晚餐实在是好吃。加上两只山鸠，这特肆的莱单更丰富，更完美了。西米面条，面包果，一些芒果，六七个菠萝和一种椰子果酿成的饮料，我们吃得快活极了。我并且认为，，我的忠实同伴们的头脑连那必要的清醒都没有了。\n “我们今晚不回诺第留斯号船上好吗？”康塞尔说。\n “我们永远不回去好吗？”尼德·兰说。\n 就在这个时候，一块石头落在我们脚边，立刻把鱼叉手的提议打断。\n \n
