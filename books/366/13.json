{"id":13868,"no":13,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 13","content":"A MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between our lips. The captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan, cross section, and side view of the Nautilus. Then he began his description as follows: \"Here, Professor Aronnax, are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you. It\u0027s a very long cylinder with conical ends. It noticeably takes the shape of a cigar, a shape already adopted in London for several projects of the same kind. The length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters, and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters. So it isn\u0027t quite built on the ten-to-one ratio of your high-speed steamers; but its lines are sufficiently long, and their tapering gradual enough, so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship\u0027s movements. \"These two dimensions allow you to obtain, via a simple calculation, the surface area and volume of the Nautilus. Its surface area totals 1,011.45 square meters, its volume 1,507.2 cubic meters-- which is tantamount to saying that when it\u0027s completely submerged, it displaces 1,500 cubic meters of water, or weighs 1,500 metric tons. \"In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater, I wanted it, when floating on the waves, to lie nine-tenths below the surface and to emerge only one-tenth. Consequently, under these conditions it needed to displace only nine-tenths of its volume, hence 1,356.48 cubic meters; in other words, it was to weigh only that same number of metric tons. So I was obliged not to exceed this weight while building it to the aforesaid dimensions. \"The Nautilus is made up of two hulls, one inside the other; between them, joining them together, are iron T-bars that give this ship the utmost rigidity. In fact, thanks to this cellular arrangement, it has the resistance of a stone block, as if it were completely solid. Its plating can\u0027t give way; it\u0027s self-adhering and not dependent on the tightness of its rivets; and due to the perfect union of its materials, the solidarity of its construction allows it to defy the most violent seas. \"The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel, whose relative density is 7.8 times that of water. The first hull has a thickness of no less than five centimeters and weighs 394.96 metric tons. My second hull, the outer cover, includes a keel fifty centimeters high by twenty-five wide, which by itself weighs 62 metric tons; this hull, the engine, the ballast, the various accessories and accommodations, plus the bulkheads and interior braces, have a combined weight of 961.52 metric tons, which when added to 394.96 metric tons, gives us the desired total of 1,356.48 metric tons. Clear?\" \"Clear,\" I replied. \"So,\" the captain went on, \"when the Nautilus lies on the waves under these conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water. Now then, if I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity to that one-tenth, hence able to hold 150.72 metric tons, and if I fill them with water, the boat then displaces 1,507.2 metric tons-- or it weighs that much--and it would be completely submerged. That\u0027s what comes about, professor. These ballast tanks exist within easy access in the lower reaches of the Nautilus. I open some stopcocks, the tanks fill, the boat sinks, and it\u0027s exactly flush with the surface of the water.\" \"Fine, captain, but now we come to a genuine difficulty. You\u0027re able to lie flush with the surface of the ocean, that I understand. But lower down, while diving beneath that surface, isn\u0027t your submersible going to encounter a pressure, and consequently undergo an upward thrust, that must be assessed at one atmosphere per every thirty feet of water, hence at about one kilogram per each square centimeter?\" \"Precisely, sir.\" \"Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don\u0027t see how you can force it down into the heart of these liquid masses.\" \"Professor,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"static objects mustn\u0027t be confused with dynamic ones, or we\u0027ll be open to serious error. Comparatively little effort is spent in reaching the ocean\u0027s lower regions, because all objects have a tendency to become \u0027sinkers.\u0027 Follow my logic here.\" \"I\u0027m all ears, captain.\" \"When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus needed to be given in order to submerge, I had only to take note of the proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in deeper and deeper strata.\" \"That\u0027s obvious,\" I replied. \"Now then, if water isn\u0027t absolutely incompressible, at least it compresses very little. In fact, according to the most recent calculations, this reduction is only .0000436 per atmosphere, or per every thirty feet of depth. For instance, to go 1,000 meters down, I must take into account the reduction in volume that occurs under a pressure equivalent to that from a 1,000-meter column of water, in other words, under a pressure of 100 atmospheres. In this instance the reduction would be .00436. Consequently, I\u0027d have to increase my weight from 1,507.2 metric tons to 1,513.77. So the added weight would only be 6.57 metric tons.\" \"That\u0027s all?\" \"That\u0027s all, Professor Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to check. Now then, I have supplementary ballast tanks capable of shipping 100 metric tons of water. So I can descend to considerable depths. When I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface, all I have to do is expel that water; and if I desire that the Nautilus emerge above the waves to one-tenth of its total capacity, I empty all the ballast tanks completely.\" This logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection. \"I accept your calculations, captain,\" I replied, \"and I\u0027d be ill-mannered to dispute them, since your daily experience bears them out. But at this juncture, I have a hunch that we\u0027re still left with one real difficulty.\" \"What\u0027s that, sir?\" \"When you\u0027re at a depth of 1,000 meters, the Nautilus\u0027s plating bears a pressure of 100 atmospheres. If at this point you want to empty the supplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your boat and rise to the surface, your pumps must overcome that pressure of 100 atmospheres, which is 100 kilograms per each square centimeter. This demands a strength--\" \"That electricity alone can give me,\" Captain Nemo said swiftly. \"Sir, I repeat: the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite. The Nautilus\u0027s pumps have prodigious strength, as you must have noticed when their waterspouts swept like a torrent over the Abraham Lincoln. Besides, I use my supplementary ballast tanks only to reach an average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, and that with a view to conserving my machinery. Accordingly, when I have a mind to visit the ocean depths two or three vertical leagues beneath the surface, I use maneuvers that are more time-consuming but no less infallible.\" \"What are they, captain?\" I asked. \"Here I\u0027m naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is maneuvered.\" \"I can\u0027t wait to find out.\" \"In order to steer this boat to port or starboard, in short, to make turns on a horizontal plane, I use an ordinary, wide-bladed rudder that\u0027s fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle. But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins, which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation; these fins are flexible, able to assume any position, and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers. If these fins stay parallel with the boat, the latter moves horizontally. If they slant, the Nautilus follows the angle of that slant and, under its propeller\u0027s thrust, either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me, or rises on that diagonal. And similarly, if I want to return more swiftly to the surface, I throw the propeller in gear, and the water\u0027s pressure makes the Nautilus rise vertically, as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies.\" \"Bravo, captain!\" I exclaimed. \"But in the midst of the waters, how can your helmsman follow the course you\u0027ve given him?\" \"My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse, which protrudes from the topside of the Nautilus\u0027s hull and is fitted with biconvex glass.\" \"Is glass capable of resisting such pressures?\" \"Perfectly capable. Though fragile on impact, crystal can still offer considerable resistance. In 1864, during experiments on fishing by electric light in the middle of the North Sea, glass panes less than seven millimeters thick were seen to resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres, all the while letting through strong, heat-generating rays whose warmth was unevenly distributed. Now then, I use glass windows measuring no less than twenty-one centimeters at their centers; in other words, they\u0027ve thirty times the thickness.\" \"Fair enough, captain, but if we\u0027re going to see, we need light to drive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters, I wonder how your helmsman can--\" \"Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile.\" \"Oh, bravo! Bravo three times over, captain! That explains the phosphorescent glow from this so-called narwhale that so puzzled us scientists! Pertinent to this, I\u0027ll ask you if the Nautilus\u0027s running afoul of the Scotia, which caused such a great uproar, was the result of an accidental encounter?\" \"Entirely accidental, sir. I was navigating two meters beneath the surface of the water when the collision occurred. However, I could see that it had no dire consequences.\" \"None, sir. But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln . . . ?\" \"Professor, that troubled me, because it\u0027s one of the best ships in the gallant American navy, but they attacked me and I had to defend myself! All the same, I was content simply to put the frigate in a condition where it could do me no harm; it won\u0027t have any difficulty getting repairs at the nearest port.\" \"Ah, commander,\" I exclaimed with conviction, \"your Nautilus is truly a marvelous boat!\" \"Yes, professor,\" Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement, \"and I love it as if it were my own flesh and blood! Aboard a conventional ship, facing the ocean\u0027s perils, danger lurks everywhere; on the surface of the sea, your chief sensation is the constant feeling of an underlying chasm, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it; but below the waves aboard the Nautilus, your heart never fails you! There are no structural deformities to worry about, because the double hull of this boat has the rigidity of iron; no rigging to be worn out by rolling and pitching on the waves; no sails for the wind to carry off; no boilers for steam to burst open; no fires to fear, because this submersible is made of sheet iron not wood; no coal to run out of, since electricity is its mechanical force; no collisions to fear, because it navigates the watery deep all by itself; no storms to brave, because just a few meters beneath the waves, it finds absolute tranquility! There, sir. There\u0027s the ideal ship! And if it\u0027s true that the engineer has more confidence in a craft than the builder, and the builder more than the captain himself, you can understand the utter abandon with which I place my trust in this Nautilus, since I\u0027m its captain, builder, and engineer all in one!\" Captain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence. The fire in his eyes and the passion in his gestures transfigured him. Yes, he loved his ship the same way a father loves his child! But one question, perhaps indiscreet, naturally popped up, and I couldn\u0027t resist asking it. \"You\u0027re an engineer, then, Captain Nemo?\" \"Yes, professor,\" he answered me. \"I studied in London, Paris, and New York back in the days when I was a resident of the earth\u0027s continents.\" \"But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret?\" \"Each part of it, Professor Aronnax, came from a different spot on the globe and reached me at a cover address. Its keel was forged by Creusot in France, its propeller shaft by Pen \u0026 Co. in London, the sheet-iron plates for its hull by Laird\u0027s in Liverpool, its propeller by Scott\u0027s in Glasgow. Its tanks were manufactured by Cail \u0026 Co. in Paris, its engine by Krupp in Prussia, its spur by the Motala workshops in Sweden, its precision instruments by Hart Bros. in New York, etc.; and each of these suppliers received my specifications under a different name.\" \"But,\" I went on, \"once these parts were manufactured, didn\u0027t they have to be mounted and adjusted?\" \"Professor, I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in midocean. There our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen, in other words, by my gallant companions whom I\u0027ve molded and educated. Then, when the operation was over, we burned every trace of our stay on that islet, which if I could have, I\u0027d have blown up.\" \"From all this, may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune?\" \"An iron ship, Professor Aronnax, runs 1,125 francs per metric ton. Now then, the Nautilus has a burden of 1,500 metric tons. Consequently, it cost 1,687,000 francs, hence 2,000,000 francs including its accommodations, and 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 with all the collections and works of art it contains.\" \"One last question, Captain Nemo.\" \"Ask, professor.\" \"You\u0027re rich, then?\" \"Infinitely rich, sir, and without any trouble, I could pay off the ten-billion-franc French national debt!\" I gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words. Was he playing on my credulity? Time would tell. 一会儿，我们坐在客厅的一张长沙发上，各人嘴里叼着雪茄。船长把一幅详细的图放在我面前，这图是诺第留斯号的平面图、侧面图和投影图。然后他用下面的话来描述这只船的形状： “阿龙纳斯先生，下面就是您乘的这只船的形状和容积。船是很长的圆筒形，两端作圆锥状。很明显，它很像一支雪前烟。这种形式，在伦敦有些船的构造早已采用过了。这个圆筒的长度，从头到尾，正好是七十米，它的横柄，最宽、的地方是八米。所以这船的构造跟普通的远航大汽船不是”完全一样的，它的宽是长的十分之一，它从头至尾是够长、砌，两腰包底又相当圆，因此船行驶时积水容易排走，丝毫不会阻碍它的航行。 “拿上面宽长两个数量计算一下，就可以得到诺第留斯号的面积和体积。面积共为一千零十一平方米四十五厘米，体积共为一千五百点二立方米——就是说，船完全沉入水中时，它的徘水量或体重为一千五百立方米或一千五百吨。 “当我绘制这只在水底航行用的船的图样时，我要求它的吃水部分占十分之九，浮出部分只占十分之一，这样它就可以在水中保持平衡。因此，在这些条件下，它的排水量只能为它体积的十分之九，即一千三百五十六立方米四十八厘米，也就是说，船的体重等于这个数目的吨数。所以我制造这船要根据上面的积量，船的全体重量不能超过这个数目。 \"诺第留斯号由双层船壳造成， 一层是内壳，另一层是外壳，两壳之间，用许多T字形的蹄铁把它们连接起来， 使船身坚硬无比。是的，由于壳与壳之间有这种细胞式的结构，这船像是一大块实铁，中间饱满无隙，可以抵抗一切。它的边缘不可能松动；船身合而为一，是由于结构本身的力量，不是由于铰钉的扣紧；因为材料配置完全适合，构造整齐划一，它可以在海洋中行驶，不怕最汹涌的风浪。 “这两层船壳是用钢板制造的，钢的密度与海水密度的比例是十比七至八。第一层船壳至少有五厘米厚，重量是三百九十四点九六吨。第二层内壳，就是龙骨，有五十厘米高，二十五厘米宽，只重六十二吨。机器，镇船机，各种附属船具和装置品，内部的各样墙板和木材等等的重量和上面的三百九十四点丸六吨蛆在尸袒，就是总重量一千三百五十六点四八吨中的一部分了。这您明白吗？” “明白。\"我答。 “所以，”船长又说，“在这种条件下，当诺第留斯号在海中时，它浮出海面十分之一。但是，如果我装设了容积等于这十分之一的储水池，容水重量为一百五十点七二吨，如果我让水池装满了水，这时船的排水量或重量是一千五百零七吨，那它就完全潜入水中了。教授，事情原来就是这：样。这些储水池实际是存在的，它们在诺第留斯号的下层。我打开储，水池的门，水池就填满了，刚被水面齐顶淹没的船于是往下沉了。· “对，船长，可是这里有实际的困难。这样，您可以使船面跟洋面一致，我可以理解。但是，再向下沉，潜入水面以下，您的潜水机器不是碰到一种压力吗？碰到一种由下而上的浮力吗？这种力是以三十英尺高的水柱压力即一个大”气压力为计算标准的，也就是说，每一平方厘米所受的力约为一公斤。” “对，先生。” “所以，只有您把诺第留斯号全部装满了水，否则，我不明白您是怎样把船潜到海底下去。” “教授，”尼摩船长回答，“不应当把静力学和动力学混：淆起来，不然的话，就要发生严重的错误。到达海洋的下层，实际不用费很大的力量，因为凡物体都有下沉到底的倾向。请您听我的推论吧。” “船长，我静听着您的话。” “要船潜入水底，就必需增加重量，当我决定增加时，我只须注意海水体积在不同深度中的压缩数量就成了。” “当然。”我回答。 “可是，水虽不是绝对不可压缩，但至少是很难压缩。是这样，根据最近的计算，每一大气压（即三十英尺高的水柱压力）下，这种压缩数量是一千万分之四百三十六。比方要到一，千米深的水层，我这时要注意的就是海水在一千米：的压力下，即一百大气压的压力下它的体积的压缩数量。这个数量为十万分之四百三十六。所以我这时应增加到的总重量，不是，一千五百零七点二吨，而是一千五百十三点七七吨。因此，增加的重量数是六点五七吨。” “仅仅这个数目吗？、 “仅仅这个数目，阿龙纳斯先生。并且，很容易用计算来证实。本来我有不少的补充储水池，能容百吨的水量。所以我可以下降至海底很深的地方。当我要上升，跟洋面相齐时，放出这些水就成，当我要诺第留斯号全身十分之一浮出水面时，把全部储水池的水排出去就可以了。” 对于根据数字的这些推理，我当然不能提出反对意见。 “船长，”我回答，“我承认您计算的精确，如果我还要争执，那就显得是无理取闹了，因为经验每天都说明您是对的。但目前我感到有一种实际困难的存在。” “先生，什么困难呢?\" “当您到一千米深的时候，诺第留斯号的外层受着一百大气压的压力。如果在这个时候；”您想排出各补充储水池伪水量，使船轻快，上升到水面，那一定要船上抽水机的力量能超过这一百大气压的压力，这压力每平方厘米是一百公斤。因此，这一种力……” “单单电就可以给我这一种力量！”尼摩船长急着说，“先生，我一再同您说，我的机器的动力差不多是无限的。诺第留斯号的抽水机有异乎寻常的力量，您应当看见过了，上次对林肯号喷出的水柱，像强大的激流一样，猛烈地冲去。另外，只是要到一千五百和二千米的中等深度时，我才使用那些补充储水池，这是为了爱护我的机器，小心使用它。所以，当我忽然想到水面下二、三里深的海洋底下时，我还使用别的驾驶法，虽然时间较长久，但也一样有效。” “船长，什么方法呢？”我问。 “这样一来，我自然得告诉你我是怎样驾驶诺第留斯号的。” “我很想知道。” “驾驶这船，要它向左向右，简单说，要它在水平面上走时，我使用普通的舵，舵上还有宽阔的副舵，装在船尾，用机轮和滑车转动。但我又可以使诺第留斯号在水中上升、，下降，这时我就使用两个纵斜机板，机板装在船的两侧浮标线的中央，它们是活动的，可以随便变换位置，使用动力强大的杠杆，从船内部来操纵它们。纵斜机板的位置如果与船身平行，船便在水平面上行驶，如果它们的位置倾斜了，诺第留斯号在推进器的推动下，就沿着倾斜方向或沿着我所要的对角线沉下去，或沿着这对角线浮上来。并且，我想更快地浮上水面来时，我就催动推进器，水的压力使诺第留斯号直线地浮上来，像一只氢气球迅速升人空中一样。” “真了不得！船长，”我喊道，“但是，领航人怎样能看见您在水底下指示船所应走的路线呢？” “领航人是守在一个装有玻璃的笼间里，这笼间在诺第留斯号船身的上部突出部分，装有各种凹凸玻璃片，保证他可以清楚地看见航路。” “玻璃片能抵抗这样强大的压力吗？， “能抵抗。玻璃虽然经不起冲击，很脆，但有强大的耐压力。1864年在北方海中利用电光做打鱼的实验，我们知道，当时使用的玻璃片只有七毫米厚，可以抵抗十六大气压的压力，同时又可以让强烈发热的光线通过，使它获得不平均的热力的配给.何况我们使用的玻璃片， 中央的厚度至少是二十一厘米，就是说，比上面打鱼用的玻璃片厚三十倍。” “尼摩船长，这个我承认；但是在海中要想看得清清楚楚，一定要有光亮来排除黑暗，请问在海水的漆黑中间……” “在领航人的笼间后面，装有一座光度很强的电光探照灯，半海里以内的海洋都可以照亮。” “啊！了不起，真是了不起！船长。我现在明白那种所谓独角鲸的磷光现象了，它真叫学者们迷离惊叹！我顺便问一下，那哄动一时的诺第留斯号和斯各脱亚号的相撞事件，是一次偶然的结果吗？” “先生，那完全是出乎意外. 我那时正在水面下二米航行，所以发生了冲撞。可是我也看到斯各脱亚号并没有受到很大的损失。” “先生，是的，没有受到重大的损失。但是跟林肯号的相碰呢？……” “教授，关于这事，我对于美国海军部的这艘勇敢的、最好的战舰觉得有些抱歉，不过这是人家来攻击我，我不得不自卫！但我也只做到使这艘战舰不能伤害我，它可以到最近的海港修理好它所受到的损伤，并不很困难。” “啊！船长，”我诚恳地喊道，“您这艘诺第留斯号真正是一艘神奇的船！” “是的，教授，”尼摩船长情绪也很激动地回答，“我爱它，像是爱我最心爱的东西一样！虽然你们的船常受海洋的意外袭击.海上一切都是危险的,荷兰人杨生说的很好他说人们在海上的第一个印象就是怕人的无底深渊的感觉但是在诺底留斯号船上, 人们心中就一点没有什么害怕。用不着害怕船要损毁，因为这只船的双层船壳是刚铁似的坚硬；它没有风浪的翻腾或颠簸可以毁损的缆索一类东西：它没有风可以吹走的帆；它没有蒸汽可以破裂的铁炉；它不会发生可怕的火灾，因为船完全是钢铁制的，不是木头造的；它不用有时会用完的煤炭，因为电是它的机械原动力；因为它在深水独来独往，不会发生可怕的相撞；它又不用冒风暴的危险，因为它在水面几米下便能得到绝对的平静！先生，以上就是这船的优点。它是一只特殊优异，独一无二的船！对于这只船，设计工程师可能比监造建筑师有信心，监造建筑师可能又比船长更有信心，如果真是这样，那您就可以理解到我对我的诺第留斯号为什么完全信赖了，因为我同时是这只船的船长、建筑师和工程师！” 尼摩船长滔滔不绝地雄辩他说着。他眼中的火焰，他手势的激动，使他完全变成另一个人。是的！他爱他的船，像一个父亲爱他的儿子一样！ 但有一个也许是冒昧的问题，自然而然的出现了，我忍不住问他： “尼摩船长，您是这船的设计工程师吗?\" “是的，教授.\"他回答我，“当我还是陆地上的居民的时候，我曾在伦敦，在巴黎，在纽约学习过。”“但是，您怎样能秘密地建造这艘奇异的令人五体投地诺第留斯号呢？”“阿龙纳斯先生，船的每一块材料都是从地球上的不同点，写上假地址送来给我的。船的龙骨是法国克鲁棱工厂造的，推进器大轴是伦敦朋尼公司制的，船壳的钢铁板是利物浦利亚工厂造的，推进器是格拉斯哥斯各脱工厂制的。船上的储水池是巴黎嘉衣公司造的，机器是由普鲁士克虏由工厂制的，船前头的冲角出自瑞典的摩达拉工厂，精确的测验仪器出自纽约的哈提兄弟公司等等，上面的每一制造厂都收到上面署名不同的我的设计图， 按图样制造。 ” \"不过，”我说，“这些制好了的一块一块材料，还得把它们配合起来、装置起来呢?\"“教授，我在大洋中一个荒岛上建立了我的工作场。在岛上，我的工人，就是我所教养成的我的勇敢的同伴，跟我一起，共同把诺第留斯号完全装配好了。然后，工程完了，我放起火来，把我们在这岛上所遗留的痕迹都消灭了，如果可能的话，我还要把这岛都炸毁呢。”“那么，这样看来，我可以相信，这船的建筑费用一定是十分浩大了？”“阿龙纳斯先生，一只钢铁制的船，每吨容量的建筑费为一千一百二十五法郎。可是诺第留斯号的载重吨数是一千五百吨，那么它的建筑费是一百七十丸万法郎，连装备费一共为二百万法郎，连船内所有的美术品和收藏物一共为是五百万法郎①。” “尼摩船长，我要问您最后一个问题。” “请您问吧，教授。” “您是很富有吗？” “无限地富有，我可以一点不为难地偿清法国的几十亿国债①！” 我注视着这位跟我这样说话的古怪人物。难道他以为我可欺而故意吹牛吗？将来我一定有机会知道他这话是真是假。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/283.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The
