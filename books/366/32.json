{"id":13887,"no":32,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 9","content":"The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my room. I expected this visit. He looked very disappointed. \"Well, sir?\" said he. \"Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday.\" \"Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended leaving his vessel.\" \"Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers.\" \"His bankers!\" \"Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his riches are safer than in the chests of the State.\" I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night, hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of Vigo on his own account. \"However,\" said he, \"all is not ended. It is only a blow of the harpoon lost. Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if necessary----\" \"In what direction is the Nautilus going?\" I asked. \"I do not know,\" replied Ned. \"Well, at noon we shall see the point.\" The Canadian returned to Conseil. As soon as I was dressed, I went into the saloon. The compass was not reassuring. The course of the Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.\\n\\n I waited with some impatience till the ship\u0027s place was pricked on the chart. At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our vessel rose to the surface of the ocean. I rushed towards the platform. Ned Land had preceded me. No more land in sight. Nothing but an immense sea. Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The weather was cloudy. A gale of wind was preparing. Ned raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon. He still hoped that behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.\\n\\n At noon the sun showed itself for an instant. The second profited by this brightness to take its height. Then, the sea becoming more billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.\\n\\n An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the Nautilus was marked at 16\" 17\u0027 long., and 33\" 22\u0027 lat., at 150 leagues from the nearest coast. There was no means of flight, and I leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of our situation.\\n\\n For myself, I was not particularly sorry. I felt lightened of the load which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of calmness to my accustomed work. That night, about eleven o\u0027clock, I received a most unexpected visit from Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from my watch of the preceding night. I answered in the negative. \"Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion.\" \"Propose, Captain?\" \"You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under the brightness of the sun. Would it suit you to see them in the darkness of the night?\" \"Most willingly.\" \"I warn you, the way will be tiring. We shall have far to walk, and must climb a mountain. The roads are not well kept.\" \"What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to follow you.\" \"Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses.\" Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any of the ship\u0027s crew were to follow us on this excursion. Captain Nemo had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.\\n\\n In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps were prepared. I called the Captain\u0027s attention to the fact. \"They will be useless,\" he replied.\\n\\n I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my observation, for the Captain\u0027s head had already disappeared in its metal case. I finished harnessing myself. I felt them put an iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a depth of 150 fathoms. Midnight was near. The waters were profoundly dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the Nautilus. What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it lit up the liquid mass, I could not say. In any case, it did light our way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.\\n\\n As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head. The noise redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood the cause. It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of the waves. Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I should be wet through! By the water! in the midst of the water! I could not help laughing at the odd idea. But, indeed, in the thick diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere. Nothing more.\\n\\n After half an hour\u0027s walk the soil became stony. Medusae, microscopic crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent gleam. I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of zoophytes and masses of sea weed. My feet often slipped upon this sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should have fallen more than once. In turning round, I could still see the whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.\\n\\n But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon. The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree. Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the savants of the earth? Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand of man aught to do with this conflagration? Had he fanned this flame? Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange existence? Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence in the deep ocean? All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued me. And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which Captain Nemo dreamed. Our road grew lighter and lighter. The white glimmer came in rays from the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high. But what I saw was simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters. The source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of the mountain.\\n\\n In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic, Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation. He knew this dreary road. Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself. I followed him with unshaken confidence. He seemed to me like a genie of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon. It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the difficult paths of a vast copse.\\n\\n Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by gigantic pines. It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling. Picture to yourself a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a forest swallowed up. The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus, between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea. I went along, climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the fishes, which flew from branch to branch. Pressing onward, I felt no fatigue. I followed my guide, who was never tired. What a spectacle! How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters doubled? We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic bounds and the low growling of an avalanche. To right and left ran long, dark galleries, where sight was lost. Here opened vast glades which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly appear to me.\\n\\n But Captain Nemo was still mounting. I could not stay behind. I followed boldly. My stick gave me good help. A false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness. Now I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of this region. There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed to defy all laws of equilibrium. From between their stony knees trees sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld them. Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a \"curtain,\" inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.\\n\\n At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass. Thus situated, this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the extreme limits of the horizon. I said that the submarine crater threw up lava, but no flames. Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to vapour by contact.\\n\\n Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on another Terra del Greco.\\n\\n There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town-its roofs open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive character of Tuscan architecture. Further on, some remains of a gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets-a perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters. Such was the sight that Captain Nemo brought before my eyes! Where was I? Where was I? I must know at any cost. I tried to speak, but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one word: ATLANTIS What a light shot through my mind! Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato, that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its disappearance amongst the legendary tales. I had it there now before my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its catastrophe. The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were waged.\\n\\n Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs. I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man had walked.\\n\\n Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone. Was he dreaming of those generations long since disappeared? Was he asking them the secret of human destiny? Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who wanted no modern one? What would I not have given to know his thoughts, to share them, to understand them! We remained for an hour at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense. Rapid tremblings ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise, distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic grandeur. At this moment the moon appeared through the mass of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent. It was but a gleam, but what an indescribable effect! The Captain rose, cast one last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.\\n\\n We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed, I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star. The Captain walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light whitened the surface of the ocean.\\n\\n 第二天2月19日早晨，我看见加拿大人走进我房中。\\n\\n 我正等他来，他神色沮丧。\\n\\n “先生，怎样？\"他对我说。\\n\\n “尼德，怎样，昨天机会对我们不利。\"“对！那个鬼怪船长正在我们要逃出他的船的时候，就把船停下来了。\"“尼德，是的，他跟他的银行经理有享呢。”\\n\\n “他的银行经理！\"\\n\\n “或者不如说是跟他的银行有享。我所说银行的意思就是海洋，就是他的财富存放的地方，那比国家的金库更为安全可靠的海洋。”\\n\\n 我于是把昨晚的意外事件告诉加拿大人，暗中希望这样可以使他不要抛弃船长，可是，我的讲述所得的结果，只是尼德很强烈表示出来的悔恨，他惋惜自己没有能亲自到维哥湾的战场上去走一下。他说：“‘好，事情并没有完！这一次只是鱼叉落了空罢了！另一次我们一定成功，如果可能，就是今晚……，，“诺第留斯号是向哪个方向航行？”我问。\\n\\n “我不知道。”尼德回答。\\n\\n “那么，到中午，我们来观测船的方位吧。\"加拿大人回到康塞尔那边去。我一穿好了衣服，就走入客厅中。罗盘指示不很明确。诺第留斯号的航路是西南偏南。我们是背着欧洲行驶。\\n\\n 我等待着把船的方位记在地图上，心中有些着急。十一点左右，储水池空了，船浮上洋面。我跑到平台上，尼德已经先在那里了。\\n\\n 陆地再也望不见，只见一片汪洋大海。天际有几只帆船，一定是到桑罗克角寻找顺风，绕过好望角去的船。天色明沉，恐怕要刮风了。\\n\\n 尼德气得了不得，极力向多雾的天际看望，他还是希望在这浓雾后面，有他所渴望的陆地。\\n\\n 正午，太阳出现了一会儿。船副乘天气暂时清朗的时候，测量了太阳的高度。一会儿，海面更汹涌起来，我们回到船中，嵌板又闭上了。一小时后，我看一下地图，看见图上记出诺第留斯号的方位，是西经16度17分，南纬33度 22分，离最近的海岸还有一百五十里。现在是没办法逃走“电光灯对我们没有用处。”\\n\\n 我觉得他没有听懂，但又不能重复我的问题，因为船长的脑袋已经套在金属球中了。我也套好了我的头，觉得他给了我一根铱铁的手杖。几分钟后，我们做了照例的动作，就踩在大西洋的海底下，在三百米深处。\\n\\n 时间近半夜了。海水深黑，尼摩船长给我指出远处的一团淡红色，像是一阵广泛的微光，在距诺第留斯号二海里左右的地方亮着。这火光是什么，什么物质使它发亮，它为什么和怎样在海水中照耀，那我可不能说。总之，‘包照着，使我们刁”以看见，虽然光线很模糊，但我不久就习惯了这种特殊的阴暗，我明白了，在这种情形下，兰可夫灯是没有什尼摩船长和我，彼此相挨很近，向那上面说的火光一直走上。平铺的地面使人不知不觉地渐渐上升。我们有手杖帮助，大踏步前进。不过，总起来说，我们还是走得慢，因为我的脚时常陷入一种带着海藻和杂有石子的泥泞里面。\\n\\n 正在前进的时候，我在我的头顶上听到一种喊喳的声音。这种声音有时来得更厉害，成为一种连续不停的声响。\\n\\n 我不久就明白了这声音的原因。原来是雨下得很凶，扫“在水波而上发出的声响。我本能地想，身上要淋湿了！在水中间被水淋湿了！我想到这个古怪的思想，不禁好笑起来。\\n\\n 老实说，穿了那很厚的潜水衣，我实在感觉不到水，我只觉得自己是在比地上气围更稠密一些的海水气围中罢了。\\n\\n 走了半小时后，地面上有很多石头。水母、细小甲壳类、磷光植虫类，发出轻微的光线，轻微地照亮了地面。我看到亿万植虫类和海藻群所追怎起来的一堆一堆的石头。\\n\\n 我的脚时常滑在这些粘性的海藻地毯上，如果没有镶铁手杖帮助，我摔下来恐怕不止一次了。我回过头来，总是看见诺第留斯号的淡白灯光，渐远渐模糊了。\\n\\n 上面说的那些石头堆是按照某种规律性在海洋底下安爿：起来的，为什么这样，我可不能解释。我看见一些巨大的沟，没入远方暗彩中，长度使人们不可能估量。还有其它奇特的地方，我简直不能承认它们的存在。我觉得我的沉重的铅铁靴底踏上了骸骨堆成的床垫，发出干脆的声响，那么我现在跑过的这个广大平原是什么呢？我很想问门科长，但他的符号语言，就是说，他的船员们跟他到海底旅行时，拿来做交谈用的符号语言，对我来说，还是一点不懂。\\n\\n 指引我们的淡红光芒陆续加强，并且把天际照得返红了。发光的焦点是在水底下，使我心中奇怪到极点。这是一种电力发散的现象吗？我是面对着一种地上的学者还不知道的自然现象吗？甚至于——我脑子中忽然有这个思想一～在这火团中是有人手参与其间吗？是人手燃烧起来的吗，在这些深水层下面，是不是我要碰到尼摩船长的同伴，朋友，他们像他一样过这种奇异的生活，他现在来访问他们吗？我要在那里遇见流放的侨民，他们对于地上的穷苦感到厌倦，来这海洋底下的最深处找寻，并且找到这种独立自主的生活吗？这些疯狂的、奇特的思想紊绕在我的脑陈，在这种心情中，我不断地承受眼前一系列神奇景象所给予的刺激：那么，我在这大海下面，若是真碰见了尼摩船长新梦想的一座海底城市，又有什么可以惊奇的呢！\\n\\n 我们的道路愈来愈照得亮了。发白的光芒是从一座高约八百英尺的山顶照下来。我现在望见的，不过是从水层形成的晶体所发展出来的单纯反光。那发光焦点，不可理解的光明的泉源，还在山的那一面。\\n\\n 在这大西洋下面罗列起来的石头迷楼中间，尼摩船长一点不迟疑，大步前进。他很熟悉这阴暗的道路。他一定时常来，不可能迷路。我跟着他走，信心很坚定。我觉得他是一位海中的神灵，当他走在我面前的时候，我赞美他的魁梧身材，在天际水平的晶莹背景上作黝黑色显现出来。\\n\\n 时间是清早六点。我们现在到了这山的俞列石栏了，但要走近石栏，必须从广阔的乱石丛林间，很难走的小径中冒险穿行。\\n\\n 对！真是一片死树丛，没有树叶，没有树浆，是受海水作用旷石化了的树。这儿那儿都有巨大的检树耸立其间。\\n\\n 好像一个还没有倒下来的煤矿坑，深深的根把它支起在倒塌的地上，枝叶就跟用黑纸做的剪影一样，清楚地描在海水天花板上。人们想象一座哈尔兹的森林①，可是沉在水下的森林，挂在一座山坡上、情形就有点仿佛了。小路上堵满了海藻和黑角菜，一群甲壳类动物在中间蠕蠕爬动。我慢慢攀上大石头，跨过躺下来的树干，碰断在两树之间摇摆的海番藤，惊吓了在树枝间迅速地游过的鱼，我走向前去。兴致勃勃的，不感觉疲倦。我紧紧跟着我的不疲倦的带路人。\\n\\n 多么美丽的景象！怎样才能把它们说出来呢？怎样描绘海水中间的树木和岩石的形象，怎样描绘它们下面的沉黑杂乱，它们上面的那被海水的反映所增强的红色光辉呢？\\n\\n 我们攀越一片一片的岩石，它们随即一大扇地倒下去，发出了雪山崩倒的隆隆声。左右两旁都有阔大的隙地，好像是人类的手弄过的，我心中在想，我面前会不会忽然出现海底地区的居民呢。\\n\\n 但尼摩船长老是往上走，我不愿落在后面，大胆跟着他。我的手杖给我很大的帮助。在这些深渊旁边凿出来的狭窄小道上，一失足，就会发生危险。我脚步很稳地走，并没有感到头昏心乱。有时我跳过一个裂口，口深不可测，在陆地上的冰海中间，可能使我倒退。有时我在深窟上倒下的动摇的大树干上冒险走过，不看自己脚下，两眼只是欣赏这地区的粗野景色。那里，有一些巨大的岩石，下部切削不平，倾斜地支起来，好像不理会那平衡的定律似的。有些树在这些岩石的膝头中间，像受了很大的压力迸出来的一样，它们彼此支持，相互支撑着。又有一种天然形成的楼阁：削成尖峰的大扇墙垣，像碉堡突出的墙一样，作很大角度的倾斜，如果在陆地面上，恐怕不是地心引力的法则所许可的。\\n\\n 就是我自己，我也感觉不到由于海水的强大密度所发生的那种不同压力，虽然我的沉重衣服，我的铜质头盖，我的铅铁靴底那样累赘，当我走上崎岖不平的斜坡上时，我简直可以说是很轻便地越过，像羚羊和山羊一般快！\\n\\n 我们离开诺第留斯号两小时后，穿过了一条长长的林带，在我们头顶的一百英尺上面，耸立着那座山峰，山峰的投影映在对面的光辉回射的山坡上。一些化石小树摆成皱里去呢？\\n\\n 我想问问他。既然不能问他，我就挡住他，要他停下来。我拉住他的胳膊。但他摇摇头，手指着那山的最后一个”山峰，好像对我这样说：“走！再走！再走！”\\n\\n 我跟着他，最后一次鼓起勇气跑去，几分钟后，我就攀登了那座尖峰，峰高出所有这些大堆岩石约十米左右。\\n\\n 我向我们刚越过的这边看，山高出平原不过七百至八百英尺左右，但从相对的另一边看，它高出大西洋这一部分的海底为上面说的两倍，即一千五六百英尺左右。我的眼睛看得很远，一眼就看见了烘烘的电光所照明的广大空间。是的，这山是一座火山。山峰五十英尺下面，在雨点一般的石头和渣滓中间，一个阔大的喷火口吐出硫磺火石的急流，四散为火的瀑布，没人团团的海水里面。这火山在这样的位置上，像一把巨大的火烛，照着海底下面的平原，一直到远方水平线的尽头。\\n\\n 上面说过，这海底喷火口喷出硫磺火石，但这并不是烈焰。必须有空气中的氧气才有火焰。在水底下火焰是无从燃起的。但火石奔流的本身就有白热化的能力，发出白色的火，跟海水作斗争，两相接触便化成汽了。迅速的海流把所有这些混和的气体都卷下去，火石的急流一直就滚到山脚底下，像维苏威火山①喷出的东西倒在另一个多列·德尔·格里哥海港②中那样。\\n\\n 正是，那边的、我眼底下的、荒废了、沉没了、倒下了的一切，现出是一座破坏了的城市，坍塌的屋顶，倒下的庙字，破损零落的拱门，倒在地下的石柱，人们还能感觉到这些都是多斯加式建筑物的坚固结实的结构。远一点，是宏大水道工程的一些残废基址。这边是堆成一座圆丘的街市高地，带有巴尔台农庙①式的模糊形状。那边是堤岸的遗迹，就像一座古老的海港，在海洋边上，庇护过那些商船和战舰一样。更远一些，有一道一道倒塌下来的墙垣，宽阔无人的大路，整个沉没水底下的庞贝城②，现在尼摩船长把它复活过来，呈现在我眼前了！\\n\\n 我在哪里？我在哪里？我不管一切，一定要知道，我要说话，我要把套起我的脑袋的铜球拉下来。\\n\\n 这时尼摩船长走到我面前，做个手势，要我停祝然后他拿起一小块铅石，向一块黑色的玄武岩石走去，仅仅写下这个名词：大西洋洲我心中豁然开朗了！大西洋城，铁奥庞比③的古代梅罗勃提城，柏拉图＠的大西洋洲，被奥利烟尼⑤、薄非尔③、杨布利克①、唐维尔②、马尔台一伯兰③、韩波尔所否认，他们把这地方的沉没不见，说是完全由于神话传说的故事所造成，但被波昔端尼斯④、蒲林尼、安米恩一麦雪林⑤、铁豆利安⑤、恩格尔①、许列尔③、杜尼福②、贝丰⑤、达维查克②所承认，这个洲，这块陆地，出现在我的眼底了，并且又有它沉没时所受到的灾祸的无可争辩的实物证据！那么，这就是那块沉没的陆地，在欧洲、亚洲、利比亚之外，在海久尔山柱的外面，上面居住着那强大的大西洋种族，最初对他们进行过多次战争的就是古代希腊。\\n\\n 把这些英雄传说时期的事迹记载在个人的著作中的历史家，就是柏拉图本人。他的狄美和克利提亚斯谈话录，可以说，就是由于诗人和立法家梭伦＠的灵感所启发而写出的著作。\\n\\n 一天，梭伦跟萨依斯城③的一些聪明智慧的老人们谈话；根据城中神庙里圣墙上所刻的编年录，这城已经证明有八百年历史了。其中一个老人讲了另一个城的历史，这个城更古老一千年。这个最早的雅典城已经有了九百世纪的年岁，曾经被大西洋人侵入，并且部分被破坏。他说，这些大西洋人据有一个广大的洲，这洲比亚洲和非洲连合起来还大，包括的面积是从纬度12度起，向北至40度止。他们的统治力量一直达到埃及。他们还要把威力伸展到希腊，但是由于希腊人的不屈不挠的顽强抵抗，他们不得不退出。\\n\\n 好几个世纪又过去了。一次天翻地覆的大灾祸发生了，就是发生了洪水，地震。仅仅一天一夜的工夫就把这个大西洋洲完全沉没，只有马德尔、阿梭尔群岛、加纳里群岛、青角群岛，就是这洲上的最高山峰现在还浮出海面①。\\n\\n 以上就是尼摩船长写的那个名词在我心中引起来的历史的回忆。所以，由于最离奇的命运的引导，我脚踩在这个大陆的一座山峰上了！我的手摸到了十万年前古老的和跟地质时期同时的那些遗址了！我走的地方就是最初原始人类曾经走过的地方！我的沉重靴底踩了那些洪荒时期的动物骨骼，而那些树木，现在已化戌矿石，而从前还曾把树荫遮覆过它们呢！\\n\\n 啊！为什么我没有时间！我简直想走下这山的陡峭斜坡去，走遍这必然把非洲和美洲连接起来的广阔大陆，访问那些洪水前期的伟大城市。或者，那边，在我的眼光下，现出那勇武好战的马基摩斯城，那信仰虔诚的欧色比斯城，区人族居民曾经在那里生活过数千百年，他们一定有力量来堆筑一直到现在还可以抵抗水力侵蚀的石头建筑物。或者有一天，有一种火山喷发现象要把这些沉没的废墟重新浮出水面上来！有人指出，在大西洋的这一部分有多数的海底火山，很多船只经过这些受火山熬煎的海底时，感到种种特殊的震动。又有些船听到抑制住没有迸发出来的声音，表示出水火两种元素的深刻激烈的斗争；另有一些船又捡了一些抛出在海面上的火山灰屑。这整个地带，一直至赤道，还是受地心大火的力量，不停地转变，又有谁知道，在一个遥远的时期，由于火山喷出的一切，由于火石的层层累积，陆续增长起来，那喷火山的山峰不出现在大西洋面上！\\n\\n 当我作这些暇想的时候，我正在设法把所有这些伟大景色的细节都装在我记忆中的时候，尼摩船长手扶在辞苔剥落的石碑上，站着不动，呆立出神。他是想着那些过去不见了的人类吗？他是向他们打听人类命运的秘密吗？这个古怪的人是到这个地方来受历史回忆的锻炼吗？他是不愿意过近代人的生活，他到这里来复活古代的生活吗？我什么都可以作，只要我能认识他的思想，和他共有这种思想，明白了解它们！\\n\\n 我们停在那个地方整整有一个钟头，静观那火石光辉下的广阔平原，火石热力有时达到惊人的强度。地心内部的汕腾使山的表面发生迅速的颤动。隆隆的声响受海水清亮的播送，演成壮阔的回响。这时候，月亮通过阵阵海水，出现了一会儿，向这块沉没的大陆投下一些淡白的光芒。\\n\\n 这仅仅是一些微弱光芒，但生出一种难以形容的景象。船长站起来，最后看一下这广阔的平原，然后向我做手势，要我跟池走。\\n\\n 我们很快就走下山岭。过了化石的森林后，我就望见了诺第留斯号的探照灯，像一颗星照在那里。船长一直向船走去，我们抵达船上，正是最早的曙尤照在海洋面上发白的时候。\\n\\n \\n\\n
