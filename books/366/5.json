{"id":13860,"no":5,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 5","content":"FOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by no incident. But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land\u0027s marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in him. Off the Falkland Islands on June 30, the frigate came in contact with a fleet of American whalers, and we learned that they hadn\u0027t seen the narwhale. But one of them, the captain of the Monroe, knew that Ned Land had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln and asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight. Anxious to see Ned Land at work, Commander Farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the Monroe. And the Canadian had such good luck that with a right-and-left shot, he harpooned not one whale but two, striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes\u0027 chase! Assuredly, if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land\u0027s harpoon, I wouldn\u0027t bet on the monster. The frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with prodigious speed. By July 3 we were at the entrance to the Strait of Magellan, abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes. But Commander Farragut was unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead to double Cape Horn. The crew sided with him unanimously. Indeed, were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait? Many of our sailors swore that the monster couldn\u0027t negotiate this passageway simply because \"he\u0027s too big for it!\" Near three o\u0027clock in the afternoon on July 6, fifteen miles south of shore, the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the South American continent, that stray rock Dutch seamen had named Cape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn. Our course was set for the northwest, and the next day our frigate\u0027s propeller finally churned the waters of the Pacific. \"Open your eyes! Open your eyes!\" repeated the sailors of the Abraham Lincoln. And they opened amazingly wide. Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled, it is true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn\u0027t remain at rest for an instant. Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean, and those with nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot at winning the prize. As for me, I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far from the least attentive on board. Snatching only a few minutes for meals and a few hours for sleep, come rain or come shine, I no longer left the ship\u0027s deck. Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings, sometimes leaning against the sternrail, I eagerly scoured that cotton-colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could see! And how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and crew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves. In an instant the frigate\u0027s deck would become densely populated. The cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors and officers. With panting chests and anxious eyes, we each would observe the cetacean\u0027s movements. I stared; I stared until I nearly went blind from a worn-out retina, while Conseil, as stoic as ever, kept repeating to me in a calm tone: \"If master\u0027s eyes would kindly stop bulging, master will see farther!\" But what a waste of energy! The Abraham Lincoln would change course and race after the animal sighted, only to find an ordinary baleen whale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of curses! However, the weather held good. Our voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions. By then it was the bad season in these southernmost regions, because July in this zone corresponds to our January in Europe; but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter. Ned Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism; beyond his spells on watch, he pretended that he never even looked at the surface of the waves, at least while no whales were in sight. And yet the marvelous power of his vision could have performed yeoman service. But this stubborn Canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin. A hundred times I chided him for his unconcern. \"Bah!\" he replied. \"Nothing\u0027s out there, Professor Aronnax, and if there is some animal, what chance would we have of spotting it? Can\u0027t you see we\u0027re just wandering around at random? People say they\u0027ve sighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas-- I\u0027m truly willing to believe it, but two months have already gone by since then, and judging by your narwhale\u0027s personality, it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways! It\u0027s blessed with a terrific gift for getting around. Now, professor, you know even better than I that nature doesn\u0027t violate good sense, and she wouldn\u0027t give some naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it hadn\u0027t a need to use that talent. So if the beast does exist, it\u0027s already long gone!\" I had no reply to this. Obviously we were just groping blindly. But how else could we go about it? All the same, our chances were automatically pretty limited. Yet everyone still felt confident of success, and not a sailor on board would have bet against the narwhale appearing, and soon. On July 20 we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude 105 degrees, and by the 27th of the same month, we had cleared the equator on the 110th meridian. These bearings determined, the frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central Pacific. Commander Farragut felt, and with good reason, that it was best to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or islands, whose neighborhoods the animal always seemed to avoid--\"No doubt,\" our bosun said, \"because there isn\u0027t enough water for him!\" So the frigate kept well out when passing the Tuamotu, Marquesas, and Hawaiian Islands, then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132 degrees and headed for the seas of China. We were finally in the area of the monster\u0027s latest antics! And in all honesty, shipboard conditions became life-threatening. Hearts were pounding hideously, gearing up for futures full of incurable aneurysms. The entire crew suffered from a nervous excitement that it\u0027s beyond me to describe. Nobody ate, nobody slept. Twenty times a day some error in perception, or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees, would cause intolerable anguish, and this emotion, repeated twenty times over, kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow. And this reaction wasn\u0027t long in coming. For three months, during which each day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales sighted, abruptly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to another, stopping suddenly, putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession, at the risk of stripping its gears, and it didn\u0027t leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coasts of America. And we found nothing! Nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves! Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale, or an underwater islet, or a derelict shipwreck, or a runaway reef, or anything the least bit unearthly! So the reaction set in. At first, discouragement took hold of people\u0027s minds, opening the door to disbelief. A new feeling appeared on board, made up of three-tenths shame and seven-tenths fury. The crew called themselves \"out-and-out fools\" for being hoodwinked by a fairy tale, then grew steadily more furious! The mountains of arguments amassed over a year collapsed all at once, and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping, to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed. With typical human fickleness, they jumped from one extreme to the other. Inevitably, the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents. This reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship, from the quarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff; and for certain, if it hadn\u0027t been for Commander Farragut\u0027s characteristic stubbornness, the frigate would ultimately have put back to that cape in the south. But this futile search couldn\u0027t drag on much longer. The Abraham Lincoln had done everything it could to succeed and had no reason to blame itself. Never had the crew of an American naval craft shown more patience and zeal; they weren\u0027t responsible for this failure; there was nothing to do but go home. A request to this effect was presented to the commander. The commander stood his ground. His sailors couldn\u0027t hide their discontent, and their work suffered because of it. I\u0027m unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of intransigence, Commander Farragut, like Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a grace period of just three days more. After this three-day delay, if the monster hadn\u0027t appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward European seas. This promise was given on November 2. It had the immediate effect of reviving the crew\u0027s failing spirits. The ocean was observed with renewed care. Each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience. Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy. A supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale, and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear! Two days passed. The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam. On the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways, a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy. Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake, to the great satisfaction, I must say, of assorted sharks. While the Abraham Lincoln heaved to, its longboats radiated in every direction around it and didn\u0027t leave a single point of the sea unexplored. But the evening of November 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved. At noon the next day, November 5, the agreed-upon delay expired. After a position fix, true to his promise, Commander Farragut would have to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of the Pacific decisively behind. By then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15\u0027 north and longitude 136 degrees 42\u0027 east. The shores of Japan were less than 200 miles to our leeward. Night was coming on. Eight o\u0027clock had just struck. Huge clouds covered the moon\u0027s disk, then in its first quarter. The sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate\u0027s stempost. Just then I was in the bow, leaning over the starboard rail. Conseil, stationed beside me, stared straight ahead. Roosting in the shrouds, the crew examined the horizon, which shrank and darkened little by little. Officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses. Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds. Then all traces of light vanished into the darkness. Observing Conseil, I discovered that, just barely, the gallant lad had fallen under the general influence. At least so I thought. Perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history. \"Come on, Conseil!\" I told him. \"Here\u0027s your last chance to pocket that $2,000.00!\" \"If master will permit my saying so,\" Conseil replied, \"I never expected to win that prize, and the Union government could have promised $100,000.00 and been none the poorer.\" \"You\u0027re right, Conseil, it turned out to be a foolish business after all, and we jumped into it too hastily. What a waste of time, what a futile expense of emotion! Six months ago we could have been back in France--\" \"In master\u0027s little apartment,\" Conseil answered. \"In master\u0027s museum! And by now I would have classified master\u0027s fossils. And master\u0027s babirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo in the Botanical Gardens, and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town!\" \"Quite so, Conseil, and what\u0027s more, I imagine that people will soon be poking fun at us!\" \"To be sure,\" Conseil replied serenely, \"I do think they\u0027ll have fun at master\u0027s expense. And must it be said . . . ?\" \"It must be said, Conseil.\" \"Well then, it will serve master right!\" \"How true!\" \"When one has the honor of being an expert as master is, one mustn\u0027t lay himself open to--\" Conseil didn\u0027t have time to complete the compliment. In the midst of the general silence, a voice became audible. It was Ned Land\u0027s voice, and it shouted: \"Ahoy! There\u0027s the thing in question, abreast of us to leeward!\" 林肯号的航行，在这些天当中，并没有碰到什么意外。 但发生了一件事，这件事使得尼德·兰显出了他惊人的技巧，同时也说明了我们对他的那种信任是应该的。 6月30日，在马露因海面上，林肯号向美国的捕鲸船打听那条独角鲸的消息，这些捕鲸船都说役碰见。但其中一只名叫孟禄号的捕鲸船船长，知道尼德·兰在我们船上。 要请他帮忙，追捕已经发现了的一条鲸鱼。法拉古舰长很想看看尼德·兰的本领，就准许他到孟禄号船上去。我们的加拿大朋友运气真好，不仅是打了一条鲸鱼，而且是打了两条，他投出双叉，一叉直刺人一条鲸鱼的心脏，追赶了几分钟以后，另一条也被捕获了。 毫无疑问，如果我们追赶的那个怪物，真的跟尼德·兰的鱼叉相碰，我决不敢打赌，保证这个怪物无事。 战舰以惊人的速度，沿着美洲东南方的海岸行驶，7月3日，我们到达麦哲伦海峡口上，与童女峡在同一个纬度。但法拉古舰长不愿意通过这曲折的海峡，要从合恩角绕过去。 全体船员一致赞成他的主张。的确，我们哪能在这狭窄的海峡里碰到那条独角鲸呢？大多数水手都肯定怪物不能通过海峡，因为它身体很大，海峡容不下它！ 的海面上，绕过这座孤岛。这是伸在美洲大陆南端的岩石。 从前荷兰水手把自己故乡的名字送给它，称它为合恩角。 现在船向西北开，明天，战舰的机轮就要在太平洋水波中搅动了。 “睁大眼睛！睁大眼睛！”林肯号上的水手们一再他说。 他们都把眼睛睁得大大的。真的，眼睛和望远镜好象被二千美元奖金的远景所眩惑，一刻也不愿休息。白天黑夜，人人都留心洋面，患昼盲症的人因在黑暗中能看得清。 比别人要多百分之五十的机会获得这笔奖金。 我个人是不受金钱引诱的，但我在船上也同样注意观察海面。除了用餐的几分钟，睡眠的几小时，不管日晒也好，雨淋也好，我总不离开甲板。有时伏在船头围板上，有时扶着船尾的栏杆，我目不转晴，死盯着一望无际、白练般的浪涛！有好几次，一条任性的鲸鱼把灰黑的脊背露在波涛上的时候，我跟船上全体职工人员一样马上就激动起来。 战舰的甲板上马上就挤满了人，水手和军官像水流一般地从布棚下涌出来了。人人都心头跳动，眼光闪烁，注视着鲸鱼的行动。我非常注意地看着，看得眼睛发黑，简直要变成瞎子了。但康塞尔总是若无其事的，用安静的语气一再对我说：“如果先生愿意少费些目力，眼睛不要睁得大大，先生也许能看得更清楚一些！” 但是，空欢喜了一场！林肯号转了方向，向发现的动物冲去，原来是一条平常的长须鲸，或一条普通的大头鲸，不多时就在大家的咒骂声中不见了！ 可是天气很好。船在良好的情况中航行，这正是南半球天气恶劣的季节，而这一带的七月却和我们欧洲的一月差不多。不过海是平静的，人们一眼可以看得很远。 尼德。兰总是抱着不肯轻信的态度；除了轮到他在甲板上看守以外，他甚至故意不看洋面——至少在没有发现鲸鱼的时候是这样。他的神奇的眼力有很大的用处，可是在十二小时中有八小时，这位固执的加拿大人只是在舱房中看书或睡觉，我多少次责备他的冷淡和不关心。 “算了吧！”他答，“阿龙纳斯先生，什么都没有，就算海中真有什么怪物，我们可能有机会看见它吗？我们不是漫无计划地瞎捡吗？据说在太平洋的北部海中，又有人看见了这个无法找到的怪物，这我并不否认：但是，自从那次碰见后，两个月已经过去了，要是根据您的这条独角鲸的怪脾气来看，它决不愿意长久停在这一带海上！它移动极快，不可捉摸。并且，教授，您比我更了解，自然造物，决不自相矛盾，它决不使天性迟缓的动物，有快速走动的能力，因为这种能力对·它并无必要。所以，这种动物如果存在的话，它早就跑远了！”听了他这话，我没法回答。很明显，我们确实是盲目地行动着。可是，又有什么办法呢？我们的机会很有限，不过，对于事情的成功，还没有人加以怀疑，船上没有一名水手敢打赌，说没有独角鲸，说它不会出现。 7月20日南回归线正交在经度105度，同月27日我们穿过了在西经110度上的赤道线。此后，船便一直向西行驶，驶进太平洋的中部海中。法拉古舰长想得对，驶到深水的地方，离开这个怪物好像不愿意挨近的大陆和海岛。 这样也许好些，机会也许多些；“可能因为接近陆地的海，对于这个怪物，还不够深！”水手长这样说。战舰添了煤后，穿过帕摩图群岛、马贵斯群岛，夏威夷群岛，在东经：32度越过了北回归线，向中国海开去。 我们终于到了这个怪物最近活动的地方了！老实说。 我们在船上简直不是过生活了。心跳动得太厉害了，说不定将来会得不可治疗的血瘤症。全体船员，神经都极度紧张，那种程度，我简直不能形容。大家不吃饭、不睡觉。由于了望的水手估计错了或看错了而引起的骚动，每天总有一二十次。这种连续不断的骚动，更加强了人们的紧张，以致不能不产生反响。 三个月来（在这三个月当中，真是一天等于一世纪），林肯号跑遍了太平洋北部所有的海面，有时向着看到的鲸鱼冲去，有时忽然离开航线，有时突然掉转船头，有时一下子停住……它不惜弄坏机器，不惜浪费动力，从日本海岸到美洲海岸，没有一处不曾搜索过。但是，什么也没有看见！看见的只是那浩瀚无边的大海！至于什么巨大的独角鲸、潜在水中的海岛，沉没的破船、飞走的暗礁，以及什么神秘的东西，却都没有看见！ 因此，反响发生了。首先是人心失望，给怀疑的心理打开一个缺口。船上产生了另一种情绪，造成这情绪的因素是三分羞愧，七分恼怒。死盯住一个空想，自然是“愚蠢\",但更多的是恼怒！一年来累积起的像磐石一般的理由，一下子完全垮下来了，这时每个人都想好好吃一吃，睡一睡，来弥补因为自己愚蠢而牺牲了的时间。由于天生就的动摇性，容易从一个极端跑到另一个极端。当初最热诚拥护这次远征的人，现在却变成最激烈的反对者了。这次反响从舱底发生，从仓库看守人的岗位传到船参谋部的军官餐厅。毫无疑问，如果不是法拉古舰长特别坚持，这艘船早就掉头往南开了。可是，这种无益的搜索再也不能拖得过久。林肯号已经尽了最大的努力，实在丝毫没有可以责备的地方了。美国海军部派到这只船上的人员，从没有表现过这么大的耐心和热情；失败并不能怪他们；现在除了回航没有什么可做了。关于回航的建议向舰长提出来了。舰民不听，坚持自己的意见。水手们公然表示不满，船上事务当然要受影响。我不敢说船上就会发生叛变，但坚持了一个时期以后，法拉古舰长像从前的哥伦布①一样，请大家再忍耐三天。如果三天期满，怪物还不出现，掌舵的人把舵轮转三次，林肯号就向欧洲海岸进发。这个诺言在11月2日发出，它的效果首先是挽回了全体船员的失败心理。人人又以新的注意力观察洋面。人人都要最后看一下海洋，作为这次远征的纪念。望远镜不停地使用，没有一刻空着。这是对巨大独角鲸的最后挑战。对于这次“出庭”的传票，它决不能找出什么理由置之不理了两天过去了，林肯号以低速度慢慢前进。在可能碰到这个动物的海面上，人们想尽方法引起它的注意或刺激它迟钝的神经。人们把一大块一大块的腊肉拉在船后，——但我应该说，这内使鲨鱼们感到十分满意。林肯号一停下来，许多小船放下去，马上就向战舰周围各方出发，不让一处海面不被搜索到。11月4日晚上到了，这个潜在海底的秘密还是没有揭露出来。 明天，11月5日正午，规定的期限便满期了。中午一过，法拉古舰长就要履行他的诺言，使战舰离开太平洋的北部海面，向东南方开行。 船这时正在北纬31度15分，东经136度42分。日本本上就在高我们不及两百英里左右的下方。黑夜快到了。 船上正敲八点钟。一片片的乌云掩盖了上弦的新月。大海波纹在船后面平静地舒展着。这时候，我倚在船头右舷围板上。康塞尔站在我的旁边，眼睛向前看着。全体船员，爬在缆素梯绳上面，细心考察渐渐缩小和沉黑了的天边。军官们拿着夜间用的望远镜，向渐次黑暗的各方搜索。月亮有时从朵朵的云间吐出一线光芒，使沉黑的海面闪耀着光辉；一会儿又消逝在黑暗中了。 我看着康塞尔，看出他的情绪多少也受了船上一般的影响。至少我是这样感觉。也许，他的神经还是第一次在好奇心的力量下震动了。 “喂，康塞尔，”我跟他说，“现在是获得两千美元奖金的最后一次机会了。” “请先生容许我对这件事说句话，”康塞尔答，“我从不想获得这笔奖金，合众国政府可以答应给十万美元，它也并不因此就穷了。” “你说得对，康塞尔；总之，这是一件愚蠢的事情，我们没怎么考虑就参加进来了。白费了多少时间，消耗了多少精神！要不，六个月以前，我们已经回到法国了……” ‘在先生的小房子里！”康塞尔答道，“在先生的博物馆里！我早已把先生的生物化石分类了！先生的野猪也早就养在植物园的笼中、，吸引着巴黎全城所有好奇的人来参观了!\"“正跟你所说的一样，康塞尔，并且，我想，我们还没有估计到人家会怎样嘲笑我们呢！”“可不是，，，康塞尔安然回答，“我想，人们一定会嘲笑您先生。我该不该说……？”“你说下去，康塞尔。”“好，那就是先生应得的报酬！”“确是这样！”“一个人如果有幸能和先生一样是一位学者，他就决不该冒昧从事……”康塞尔没有说完他的“恭维”话。在全船的沉默当中，大家听到了一个人的声音，那是尼德·兰的声音，他喊着：“看哪！我们寻找了多时的那家伙就在那里，正斜对着我们呢！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/275.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
