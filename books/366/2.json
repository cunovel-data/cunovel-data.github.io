{"id":13857,"no":2,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 2","content":"DURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring, I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore the Nebraska badlands in the United States. In my capacity as Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had been attached to this expedition by the French government. After spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden with valuable collections near the end of March. My departure for France was set for early May. In the meantime, then, I was busy classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures when that incident took place with the Scotia. I was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news of the day, and how could I not have been? I had read and reread every American and European newspaper without being any farther along. This mystery puzzled me. Finding it impossible to form any views, I drifted from one extreme to the other. Something was out there, that much was certain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on the Scotia\u0027s wound. When I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point. The hypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward by people not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated. And indeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could it move about with such prodigious speed? Also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement. So only two possible solutions to the question were left, creating two very distinct groups of supporters: on one side, those favoring a monster of colossal strength; on the other, those favoring an \"underwater boat\" of tremendous motor power. Now then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible, it couldn\u0027t stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World and the Old. That a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable. Where and when had he built it, and how could he have built it in secret? Only some government could own such an engine of destruction, and in these disaster-filled times, when men tax their ingenuity to build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons, it was possible that, unknown to the rest of the world, some nation could have been testing such a fearsome machine. The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo, and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram, which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down. At least I hope it will. But this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments. Since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering, the sincerity of these governments could not be doubted. Besides, how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice? Keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual, and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers. So, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an underwater Monitor was ultimately rejected. And so the monster surfaced again, despite the endless witticisms heaped on it by the popular press, and the human imagination soon got caught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies. After I arrived in New York, several people did me the honor of consulting me on the phenomenon in question. In France I had published a two-volume work, in quarto, entitled The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths. Well received in scholarly circles, this book had established me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field of natural history. My views were in demand. As long as I could deny the reality of the business, I confined myself to a flat \"no comment.\" But soon, pinned to the wall, I had to explain myself straight out. And in this vein, \"the honorable Pierre Aronnax, Professor at the Paris Museum,\" was summoned by The New York Herald to formulate his views no matter what. I complied. Since I could no longer hold my tongue, I let it wag. I discussed the question in its every aspect, both political and scientific, and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article I published in the issue of April 30. \"Therefore,\" I wrote, \"after examining these different hypotheses one by one, we are forced, every other supposition having been refuted, to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal. \"The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us. No soundings have been able to reach them. What goes on in those distant depths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? What is the constitution of these animals? It\u0027s almost beyond conjecture. \"However, the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the form of a choice between two alternatives. \"Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet, or we do not. \"If we do not know every one of them, if nature still keeps ichthyological secrets from us, nothing is more admissible than to accept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera, animals with a basically \u0027cast-iron\u0027 constitution that inhabit strata beyond the reach of our soundings, and which some development or other, an urge or a whim if you prefer, can bring to the upper level of the ocean for long intervals. \"If, on the other hand, we do know every living species, we must look for the animal in question among those marine creatures already cataloged, and in this event I would be inclined to accept the existence of a giant narwhale. \"The common narwhale, or sea unicorn, often reaches a length of sixty feet. Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold, then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons, and you have the animal we\u0027re looking for. It would have the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon, the instrument needed to perforate the Scotia, and the power to pierce a steamer\u0027s hull. \"In essence, the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword, or lance, as certain naturalists have expressed it. It\u0027s a king-sized tooth as hard as steel. Some of these teeth have been found buried in the bodies of baleen whales, which the narwhale attacks with invariable success. Others have been wrenched, not without difficulty, from the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean through, as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel. The museum at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris owns one of these tusks with a length of 2.25 meters and a width at its base of forty-eight centimeters! \"All right then! Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful, launch it at a speed of twenty miles per hour, multiply its mass times its velocity, and you get just the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe. \"So, until information becomes more abundant, I plump for a sea unicorn of colossal dimensions, no longer armed with a mere lance but with an actual spur, like ironclad frigates or those warships called \u0027rams,\u0027 whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously. \"This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away--unless it\u0027s something else entirely, which, despite everything that has been sighted, studied, explored and experienced, is still possible!\" These last words were cowardly of me; but as far as I could, I wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter from the Americans, who when they do laugh, laugh raucously. I had left myself a loophole. Yet deep down, I had accepted the existence of \"the monster.\" My article was hotly debated, causing a fine old uproar. It rallied a number of supporters. Moreover, the solution it proposed allowed for free play of the imagination. The human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures. Now then, the sea is precisely their best medium, the only setting suitable for the breeding and growing of such giants--next to which such land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses are mere dwarves. The liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters or crabs weighing 200 metric tons! Why not? Formerly, in prehistoric days, land animals (quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a gigantic scale. Our Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually made smaller. With its untold depths, couldn\u0027t the sea keep alive such huge specimens of life from another age, this sea that never changes while the land masses undergo almost continuous alteration? Couldn\u0027t the heart of the ocean hide the last-remaining varieties of these titanic species, for whom years are centuries and centuries millennia? But I mustn\u0027t let these fantasies run away with me! Enough of these fairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities. I repeat: opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon, and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent. Yet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved, more practical people, especially in America and England, were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster, to insure the safety of transoceanic travel. The industrial and commercial newspapers dealt with the question chiefly from this viewpoint. The Shipping \u0026 Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd\u0027s List, France\u0027s Packetboat and Maritime \u0026 Colonial Review, all the rags devoted to insurance companies--who threatened to raise their premium rates-- were unanimous on this point. Public opinion being pronounced, the States of the Union were the first in the field. In New York preparations were under way for an expedition designed to chase this narwhale. A high-speed frigate, the Abraham Lincoln, was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as possible. The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut, who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate. But, as it always happens, just when a decision had been made to chase the monster, the monster put in no further appearances. For two months nobody heard a word about it. Not a single ship encountered it. Apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around it. People were constantly babbling about the creature, even via the Atlantic Cable! Accordingly, the wags claimed that this slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the most of it. So the frigate was equipped for a far-off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear, but nobody knew where to steer it. And impatience grew until, on June 2, word came that the Tampico, a steamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai, had sighted the animal again, three weeks before in the northerly seas of the Pacific. This news caused intense excitement. Not even a 24-hour breather was granted to Commander Farragut. His provisions were loaded on board. His coal bunkers were overflowing. Not a crewman was missing from his post. To cast off, he needed only to fire and stoke his furnaces! Half a day\u0027s delay would have been unforgivable! But Commander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth. I received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left its Brooklyn pier;* the letter read as follows: *Author\u0027s Note: A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside for an individual vessel. Pierre Aronnax Professor at the Paris Museum Fifth Avenue Hotel New York Sir: If you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln, the government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France\u0027s representative in this undertaking. Commander Farragut has a cabin at your disposal. Very cordially yours, J. B. HOBSON, Secretary of the Navy. 这些事件发生的时候，我正从美国内布拉斯加州的贫瘠地区做完了科学考察回来。由于我是巴黎自然科学博物馆的副教授，法国政府派我参加这次考察.在内布拉斯加州度过了六个月的时间，三月底，我满载了珍贵的标本回到纽约，我动身回法国的日期定在五月初。所以，我就利用逗留期间，把这次收集来的矿物标本和动、植物标本加以整理，而斯各脱亚号的意外事件就是在这个时候发生的。 我自然也熟悉当时议论纷纷的这个问题，而且我怎能不知道呢？我把美国和欧洲的各种报刊读了又读，但没有获得进一步的了解。因为这个怪物，我作了种种猜测。由于自己拿不定主意，我始终摇摆于极端不同的见解之间。 这是一件真实的事，那是无可置疑的；怀疑这事的人，请他们去摸一摸斯各脱亚号的裂口好了。 当我到纽约的时候，这问题正闹得热火朝天。有些不学无术的人曾经说那是浮动的小岛，是不可捉摸的暗礁，不过，这种假设,现在完全被推翻了。理由是：，除非这暗礁在腹部有一架机器，不然的话，它怎能这样快地一会儿到达这里一会儿又到那里呢?同样地，说它是一只浮动的船壳或是一只巨大的破船，这假设也不能成立，理由仍然是因为它转移得那么快。归根结底，这问题只可能有下面两种解释，因此人们分成了抱着不同主张的两派：一派说这是一个力大无穷的怪物，另一派说这是一艘动力十分强大的“潜水艇”。 后面那种假设虽然很可以成立，但到欧美两洲调查之后，便站不住了。如果说私人可以有这样一种机器，实在是不大可能的事。在什么地方，什么时候。他造了这个东西?他又怎能保守秘密而不泄露呢？ 只有一国政府可以拥有这种破坏性的机器，在人们绞尽脑汁要增强武器威力的不幸时代，一个国家瞒着其他国家制造这种武器是可能的。机枪之后有水雷，水雷之后有潜水冲击机，然后一又是各种互相克制的武器，至少我自己心中是这样想的。 但是这个“潜水艇”的假设，由于各国欧府的声明又站不住了、因为这是有关公共利益的问题，既然海洋交通受到了破坏，各国政府的真诚，当然不容有所怀疑。并且，怎么能说这只“潜水艇”的建造竟可以逃避公众的耳目呢？在这种情形下，就是拿个人来说，要想保守秘密，也十分困难，对于一国政府，它的行动经常受到敌对国家的注意，那当然更是不可能的了。 、所以，根据在英国，在法国，在俄国，在普鲁士,在西班吁，在意大利，在美国，甚至于在土耳其所做的调查，“潜水艇”的假设，也终于不能不放弃。 这个怪物尽管当时一些报刊对它不断加以嘲笑，但它又出现在波涛上了，于是人们的想象就从鱼类这一方面打主意而造出种种最荒诞不经的传说来。 当我到纽约的时候，有些人特地来问我对这件怪事的意见占我以前在法国出版过一部八开本的书，共两册，书名为：《海底的神秘》。这部书特别受到学术界的赏识，使我成为自然科学中这一个相当奥秘的部门的专家。因此人们才询问我的意见。但我只要能够否认这事的真实性，我总是作否定的答复。但不久我被逼只得明确地表示我的意见。 况且《纽约先锋论坛报》已经约了“巴黎自然科学博物馆教。授，可敬的彼埃尔·阿龙纳斯先生”，请他发表对这个问题砌意见。 我发表了我的意见。我因为不能沉默，才不得不悦几句诸。我从政治上和学术上来讨论这个问题的各个方面。 现在我将我发表在4月30日《论坛报》上的一篇材料很丰富的文章的结论，节录几段在下面：“我一个一个研究了各种不同的假设和所有不可能成立的猜想，不得不承认实在有一种力量惊人的海洋动物的存在。“海洋深不可测的底层，我们完全不了解。探测器也不徙达到。最下层的深渊里是怎样的情形呢？海底二万二千梅里或一万五千海里的地方有些什么生物和可能有些什么生物呢？这些动物的身体构造是怎样的呢？我们实在很难推测。“可是，摆在我面前的问题可以用‘两刀论法’的公式来解决。“生活在地球上的各色各样的生物，或者我们认识，或者我们不认识。”““如果我们不认识所有的生物，而大自然又继续对我们保守某些鱼类学上的秘密，那么我们就不得不承认在探测器不可及的水层里还有鱼类鲸类的新品种，它们有一个‘不浮的’器官，因为在海底下呆久了，在偶然的情况下，由于一时高兴，或者任性，就突然浮到海面上来。这说法还是比较今人情服的。“反过来，如果我们的确认识了地球上所有的生物，那么我们就必须从已经加以分类的海洋生物中找出我们讨论的这个动物；在这种情形下，我就要承认有一种巨大的独角鲸的存在。“普通常见的独角鲸，或海麒麟，身长常常达到六十英尺，现在如果把这长度增加五倍，甚至十倍，同时让这条鲸、鱼类动物有和它身材戊比例的力量，再加强它的攻击武器，这样就是现在海上的那个动物了。也就是说它有山农号军官们所测定的长度那么长，它的角，可以刺穿斯各脱亚号、它的力量可以冲破一只汽船的船壳。“诚然，这条独角鲸，如某些生物学家所说，是具有一把：骨质的剑或一把骨质的乾，那么这一定是一根像钢铁一样：坚硬的长牙，有人曾经在鲸鱼身上发现过独角鲸的牙齿，。独角鲸用牙齿攻击鲸鱼总是成功的。有人也曾经从船底上拨出过——好容易才找出来——独角鲸的牙齿，它钻通船底就好像利锥穿透木桶那样。“巴黎医学院陈列馆就藏有一枚这种牙齿，长两米二十五厘米，底宽四十八厘米!“好吧！现在假定那武器还要厉害十倍，那动物的力量还要大十倍，如果它的前进速度是每小时二十英里，那么拿它的体重去乘它的速度平方，就能求出憧坏斯各脱亚号的那股冲击力。“因此，在还没有得到更多的材料之前，我认为这是一只海麒麟，这只海麒麟身躯非常巨大，身上的武装不是剑戟，而是真正的冲角，像铁甲船或战舰上所装有的那样，它同时又具备有战舰的重量和动力。“这样便说明了这种神秘不可解的现象。——或者相反地，不管人们所见到的、所感到的是怎样，实际上什么都不是；那也是可能的。” 最后几句话只能说明我没有主见，看问题摇摆不定；这是为了在一。定程度上保全我教授的身份，同时不愿意让美国人笑话，因为美国人笑起来，是笑得很厉害的。我于是自下这一条退路。其实我是承认这个“怪物\"的存在的。我的文章引起了热烈的讨论，产生了很大的反响。很有一部分人拥护它。而且丈中提出的结论可以让人随便去设想，没有什么限制。人们总是对那些神奇怪诞的幻想感倒兴趣。、而海洋正是这些幻想的最好泉源，因为只有海才是巨大动物可以繁殖和成长的环境，陆上的动物，大象或犀牛之类。跟它们比较起来，简直渺小得很。一片汪洋大海里：既然有我们所知道的最巨大的哺乳类动物，说不定也有硕大无比的软体动物和看起来叫人害怕的甲壳动物，如一百米长的大虾，或二百吨重的螃蟹！为什么不能有呢？“从前，跟地质学纪年同时代的陆上动物，四足兽，四手兽，爬虫类，鸟类，都是按照巨大的模型创造的。造物者甩高大的模型把它们造出来，经过漫长的岁月，这模型渐渐缩小了。在深不可测的海洋底下（因为海洋是永不更改；而地壳几乎是不断变化着的），为什么不能保存从前另一时代的巨大生物的品种呢？海洋内部，为什么不能藏有那些巨大生物的最后变种，以一世纪为一年，以一千年为一世纪的那些巨大品种呢？我又让自己浸沉在种种空想中了.现在要停止这些空想，因为，在我看来，时间已经把这些空想变成为可怕的现实。我再说一次，当时对于这件怪事的性质有这一种意见，就是大家都一致承认有一种神奇东西的存在，而这种东西和怪诞的大海蛇并没有丝毫共同之点。可是，尽管有一些人把这事看成是一个待解决的纯粹科学问题，但另一些比较注意实利的人，特别在美国和英国，这类人很多，他们主张把海洋上这个可怕的怪物清除掠，使海上交通的安全获得保障。特别是工商界的报刊，都从这个观点来研究这个问题。《航业商情杂志》,\u003c\u003c来依特公司航海杂志》、《邮船杂志》、《海洋殖民杂志》以及为保险公司宣传公司要提高保险费的那些报纸，对于清除怪物这一点，都一致表示同意。公众的意见一提出来，北美合众国首先发表了声明，要在纽约作准备，组织清除独角鲸的远征队。一艘装有冲角的高速度的二级战舰林肯号定于最近的期间驶出海面。各造船厂都给法拉古司令宫以种种便利，帮助他早一天把这艘二级战舰装备起来。事情往往就是这样，等人们决定要追赶这怪物的时候。怪物再也不出现了。在两个月的时间内，谁都没有得到怪物的消息，也没有海船碰见它。好像这条海麒麟已经得到了人们准备进攻它的情报。因为大家说得大多了，甚至于用大西洋的海底电线来说！所以，喜欢说笑话的人说，这个精灵的东西一定在中途偷听了电报，现在它启己有了防备。不再随便出来。因此，这艘用作远征而且装有强大打鱼机的二级战舰,现在不知道向哪里开才好。大家越来越不耐烦了，忽然，7月2日，旧金山轮船公司从加利福尼亚开往上海的一只汽船唐比葛号，三星期前在太平洋北部的海面上又看见了这：个东西。这消息引起了极大的骚动。大家要法拉古司令宫立即出发，二十四小时的迟延都不许可。船中日用品全装上去了，舱底也载满了煤。船上各部门的人员一个也不少，都到齐了。现在只等升火，加热，解缆了：大家不容许这船再有：半天的延期：再说，法拉古司令宫本人也巴不得马上就出发！在株肯号离开布洛克袜码头之前三小时，我收到一封信，信的内容如下：。“递交纽约第五号路旅馆，巴黎自然科学博物馆教授阿龙纳斯先生。先生：如果您同意加入林肯号远征队，合众国政府很愿意看到这次远征有您代表法国参加。法拉古司令官已留下船上一个舱房供您使用。海军部长何伯逊敬启。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/272.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
