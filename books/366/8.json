{"id":13863,"no":8,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 8","content":"THIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning speed. My companions and I had no time to collect ourselves. I don\u0027t know how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison, but as for me, I was shivering all over. With whom were we dealing? Surely with some new breed of pirates, exploiting the sea after their own fashion. The narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by profound darkness. Saturated with the outside light, my eyes couldn\u0027t make out a thing. I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an iron ladder. Forcibly seized, Ned Land and Conseil were behind me. At the foot of the ladder, a door opened and instantly closed behind us with a loud clang. We were alone. Where? I couldn\u0027t say, could barely even imagine. All was darkness, but such utter darkness that after several minutes, my eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that drift through even the blackest nights. Meanwhile, furious at these goings on, Ned Land gave free rein to his indignation. \"Damnation!\" he exclaimed. \"These people are about as hospitable as the savages of New Caledonia! All that\u0027s lacking is for them to be cannibals! I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they were, but believe you me, they won\u0027t eat me without my kicking up a protest!\" \"Calm yourself, Ned my friend,\" Conseil replied serenely. \"Don\u0027t flare up so quickly! We aren\u0027t in a kettle yet!\" \"In a kettle, no,\" the Canadian shot back, \"but in an oven for sure. It\u0027s dark enough for one. Luckily my Bowie knife hasn\u0027t left me, and I can still see well enough to put it to use.* The first one of these bandits who lays a hand on me--\" *Author\u0027s Note: A Bowie knife is a wide-bladed dagger that Americans are forever carrying around. \"Don\u0027t be so irritable, Ned,\" I then told the harpooner, \"and don\u0027t ruin things for us with pointless violence. Who knows whether they might be listening to us? Instead, let\u0027s try to find out where we are!\" I started moving, groping my way. After five steps I encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate. Then, turning around, I bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set. The floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick, hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps. Its naked walls didn\u0027t reveal any trace of a door or window. Going around the opposite way, Conseil met up with me, and we returned to the middle of this cabin, which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide. As for its height, not even Ned Land, with his great stature, was able to determine it. Half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing, when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding light. Our prison lit up all at once; in other words, it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first I couldn\u0027t stand the brightness of it. From its glare and whiteness, I recognized the electric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon. After involuntarily closing my eyes, I reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving out of the cabin\u0027s ceiling. \"Finally! It\u0027s light enough to see!\" Ned Land exclaimed, knife in hand, staying on the defensive. \"Yes,\" I replied, then ventured the opposite view. \"But as for our situation, we\u0027re still in the dark.\" \"Master must learn patience,\" said the emotionless Conseil. This sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its tiniest details. It contained only a table and five stools. Its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed. Not a sound reached our ears. Everything seemed dead inside this boat. Was it in motion, or stationary on the surface of the ocean, or sinking into the depths? I couldn\u0027t tell. But this luminous globe hadn\u0027t been turned on without good reason. Consequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an appearance. If you want to consign people to oblivion, you don\u0027t light up their dungeons. I was not mistaken. Unlocking noises became audible, a door opened, and two men appeared. One was short and stocky, powerfully muscled, broad shouldered, robust of limbs, the head squat, the hair black and luxuriant, the mustache heavy, the eyes bright and penetrating, and his whole personality stamped with that southern-blooded zest that, in France, typifies the people of Provence. The philosopher Diderot has very aptly claimed that a man\u0027s bearing is the clue to his character, and this stocky little man was certainly a living proof of this claim. You could sense that his everyday conversation must have been packed with such vivid figures of speech as personification, symbolism, and misplaced modifiers. But I was never in a position to verify this because, around me, he used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect. The second stranger deserves a more detailed description. A disciple of such character-judging anatomists as Gratiolet or Engel could have read this man\u0027s features like an open book. Without hesitation, I identified his dominant qualities-- self-confidence, since his head reared like a nobleman\u0027s above the arc formed by the lines of his shoulders, and his black eyes gazed with icy assurance; calmness, since his skin, pale rather than ruddy, indicated tranquility of blood; energy, shown by the swiftly knitting muscles of his brow; and finally courage, since his deep breathing denoted tremendous reserves of vitality. I might add that this was a man of great pride, that his calm, firm gaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane, and that the harmony of his facial expressions and bodily movements resulted in an overall effect of unquestionable candor-- according to the findings of physiognomists, those analysts of facial character. I felt \"involuntarily reassured\" in his presence, and this boded well for our interview. Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could not precisely state. He was tall, his forehead broad, his nose straight, his mouth clearly etched, his teeth magnificent, his hands refined, tapered, and to use a word from palmistry, highly \"psychic,\" in other words, worthy of serving a lofty and passionate spirit. This man was certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I had ever encountered. One unusual detail: his eyes were spaced a little far from each other and could instantly take in nearly a quarter of the horizon. This ability-- as I later verified--was strengthened by a range of vision even greater than Ned Land\u0027s. When this stranger focused his gaze on an object, his eyebrow lines gathered into a frown, his heavy eyelids closed around his pupils to contract his huge field of vision, and he looked! What a look--as if he could magnify objects shrinking into the distance; as if he could probe your very soul; as if he could pierce those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and scan the deepest seas . . . ! Wearing caps made of sea-otter fur, and shod in sealskin fishing boots, these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some unique fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of movement. The taller of the two--apparently the leader on board--examined us with the greatest care but without pronouncing a word. Then, turning to his companion, he conversed with him in a language I didn\u0027t recognize. It was a sonorous, harmonious, flexible dialect whose vowels seemed to undergo a highly varied accentuation. The other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three utterly incomprehensible words. Then he seemed to question me directly with a long stare. I replied in clear French that I wasn\u0027t familiar with his language; but he didn\u0027t seem to understand me, and the situation grew rather baffling. \"Still, master should tell our story,\" Conseil said to me. \"Perhaps these gentlemen will grasp a few words of it!\" I tried again, telling the tale of our adventures, clearly articulating my every syllable, and not leaving out a single detail. I stated our names and titles; then, in order, I introduced Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil, and Mr. Ned Land, harpooner. The man with calm, gentle eyes listened to me serenely, even courteously, and paid remarkable attention. But nothing in his facial expression indicated that he understood my story. When I finished, he didn\u0027t pronounce a single word. One resource still left was to speak English. Perhaps they would be familiar with this nearly universal language. But I only knew it, as I did the German language, well enough to read it fluently, not well enough to speak it correctly. Here, however, our overriding need was to make ourselves understood. \"Come on, it\u0027s your turn,\" I told the harpooner. \"Over to you, Mr. Land. Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken by an Anglo-Saxon, and try for a more favorable result than mine.\" Ned needed no persuading and started our story all over again, most of which I could follow. Its content was the same, but the form differed. Carried away by his volatile temperament, the Canadian put great animation into it. He complained vehemently about being imprisoned in defiance of his civil rights, asked by virtue of which law he was hereby detained, invoked writs of habeas corpus, threatened to press charges against anyone holding him in illegal custody, ranted, gesticulated, shouted, and finally conveyed by an expressive gesture that we were dying of hunger. This was perfectly true, but we had nearly forgotten the fact. Much to his amazement, the harpooner seemed no more intelligible than I had been. Our visitors didn\u0027t bat an eye. Apparently they were engineers who understood the languages of neither the French physicist Arago nor the English physicist Faraday. Thoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources, I no longer knew what tactic to pursue, when Conseil told me: \"If master will authorize me, I\u0027ll tell the whole business in German.\" \"What! You know German?\" I exclaimed. \"Like most Flemish people, with all due respect to master.\" \"On the contrary, my respect is due you. Go to it, my boy.\" And Conseil, in his serene voice, described for the third time the various vicissitudes of our story. But despite our narrator\u0027s fine accent and stylish turns of phrase, the German language met with no success. Finally, as a last resort, I hauled out everything I could remember from my early schooldays, and I tried to narrate our adventures in Latin. Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent me to the scullery, but somehow I managed to pull through. With the same negative result. This last attempt ultimately misfiring, the two strangers exchanged a few words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew, not even favoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are used in every country in the world. The door closed again. \"This is outrageous!\" Ned Land shouted, exploding for the twentieth time. \"I ask you! We speak French, English, German, and Latin to these rogues, and neither of them has the decency to even answer back!\" \"Calm down, Ned,\" I told the seething harpooner. \"Anger won\u0027t get us anywhere.\" \"But professor,\" our irascible companion went on, \"can\u0027t you see that we could die of hunger in this iron cage?\" \"Bah!\" Conseil put in philosophically. \"We can hold out a good while yet!\" \"My friends,\" I said, \"we mustn\u0027t despair. We\u0027ve gotten out of tighter spots. So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your views on the commander and crew of this boat.\" \"My views are fully formed,\" Ned Land shot back. \"They\u0027re rogues!\" \"Oh good! And from what country?\" \"Roguedom!\" \"My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn\u0027t clearly marked on maps of the world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is hard to make out! Neither English, French, nor German, that\u0027s all we can say. But I\u0027m tempted to think that the commander and his chief officer were born in the low latitudes. There must be southern blood in them. But as to whether they\u0027re Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East Indians, their physical characteristics don\u0027t give me enough to go on. And as for their speech, it\u0027s utterly incomprehensible.\" \"That\u0027s the nuisance in not knowing every language,\" Conseil replied, \"or the drawback in not having one universal language!\" \"Which would all go out the window!\" Ned Land replied. \"Don\u0027t you see, these people have a language all to themselves, a language they\u0027ve invented just to cause despair in decent people who ask for a little dinner! Why, in every country on earth, when you open your mouth, snap your jaws, smack your lips and teeth, isn\u0027t that the world\u0027s most understandable message? From Quebec to the Tuamotu Islands, from Paris to the Antipodes, doesn\u0027t it mean: I\u0027m hungry, give me a bite to eat!\" \"Oh,\" Conseil put in, \"there are some people so unintelligent by nature . . .\" As he was saying these words, the door opened. A steward entered.* He brought us some clothes, jackets and sailor\u0027s pants, made out of a fabric whose nature I didn\u0027t recognize. I hurried to change into them, and my companions followed suit. *Author\u0027s Note: A steward is a waiter on board a steamer. Meanwhile our silent steward, perhaps a deaf-mute, set the table and laid three place settings. \"There\u0027s something serious afoot,\" Conseil said, \"and it bodes well.\" \"Bah!\" replied the rancorous harpooner. \"What the devil do you suppose they eat around here? Turtle livers, loin of shark, dogfish steaks?\" \"We\u0027ll soon find out!\" Conseil said. Overlaid with silver dish covers, various platters had been neatly positioned on the table cloth, and we sat down to eat. Assuredly, we were dealing with civilized people, and if it hadn\u0027t been for this electric light flooding over us, I would have thought we were in the dining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool, or the Grand Hotel in Paris. However, I feel compelled to mention that bread and wine were totally absent. The water was fresh and clear, but it was still water--which wasn\u0027t what Ned Land had in mind. Among the foods we were served, I was able to identify various daintily dressed fish; but I couldn\u0027t make up my mind about certain otherwise excellent dishes, and I couldn\u0027t even tell whether their contents belonged to the vegetable or the animal kingdom. As for the tableware, it was elegant and in perfect taste. Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, and plate, bore on its reverse a letter encircled by a Latin motto, and here is its exact duplicate: MOBILIS IN MOBILI N Moving within the moving element! It was a highly appropriate motto for this underwater machine, so long as the preposition in is translated as within and not upon. The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of that mystifying individual in command beneath the seas! Ned and Conseil had no time for such musings. They were wolfing down their food, and without further ado I did the same. By now I felt reassured about our fate, and it seemed obvious that our hosts didn\u0027t intend to let us die of starvation. But all earthly things come to an end, all things must pass, even the hunger of people who haven\u0027t eaten for fifteen hours. Our appetites appeased, we felt an urgent need for sleep. A natural reaction after that interminable night of fighting for our lives. \"Ye gods, I\u0027ll sleep soundly,\" Conseil said. \"Me, I\u0027m out like a light!\" Ned Land replied. My two companions lay down on the cabin\u0027s carpeting and were soon deep in slumber. As for me, I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep. Too many thoughts had piled up in my mind, too many insoluble questions had arisen, too many images were keeping my eyelids open! Where were we? What strange power was carrying us along? I felt--or at least I thought I did--the submersible sinking toward the sea\u0027s lower strata. Intense nightmares besieged me. In these mysterious marine sanctuaries, I envisioned hosts of unknown animals, and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs: living, breathing, just as fearsome . . . ! Then my mind grew calmer, my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness, and I soon fell into an uneasy slumber. 像闪电一般炔，他们粗暴地把我们架进这只潜水船中。 我的伙伴和我，简直连辨明方向的时间都没有。他们走进这浮动的监牢中，心中会有什么感觉，我可不知道：但我自己却不禁打了个寒战，感觉皮肤都冰凉了。我们跟谁打交道呢？无疑地是跟一些新型的横行海上的海盗打交道。 我们一进去，上面狭小的盖板立即关上了，四周是漆黑的一团。从光亮的地方，突然进入黑暗中，我的眼睛什么也看不见。我感到我的光脚是紧紧地踩在一架铁梯上。尼德·兰和康塞尔，被人们抓得紧紧的，跟在我后面。铁梯下面一扇门打开了，我们走进去以后，门就立即关上，发出很响亮的声音。 关在里面的，现在单单剩下我们了。在什么地方呢？ 我说不出来，甚至也猜不出来。只见一片漆黑，竟黑到这么一种程度：在几分钟后，就是通常在最黑暗的夜间浮来浮去的那种模糊光线，我的眼睛也一点没碰到。 尼德·兰对人家给我们的这种款待方式非常愤慨，池尽情地发泄他的愤怒。 “混蛋!“他喊，“这儿的人待客不亚于喀里多尼亚人①！他们只差吃人肉罢了！我才不奇怪呢，不过我要声明，我不会不反抗就让他们吃我!\"“安静些，尼德·兰好朋友，安静些，”康塞尔平心静气他说，“没到时候，您用不着冒火。我们还没有被放在烤盘里呢！” “对，还没有放在烤盘里，”加拿大人答，“但是毫无疑伺，我们已经在烤炉里了。这么黑。哼！好在我的尖板刀还带在身边，用得着它的时候，我是会看得清楚的。这些盗，看他们谁敢先来向我下手吧……” “尼德·兰，您不用发脾气，”我于是对鱼叉手说，“暴躁：没有什么用，只会把事情搞坏了，谁知道有没有人在偷听我们说话呢！我们倒不如先想法知道我们是在什么地方。”我摸索着慢慢地走。走了五步，我碰到一堵铁墙，墙是用螺丝钉铆住的铁板。然后，我转回来，撞上一张木头桌子，桌子边放有几张方板凳。这间监狱的地板上铺着很厚的麻垫子，走起来没有一点脚步声。光光的墙壁摸不出有问窗的痕迹。康塞尔从相反的方向走过来，碰着我；我们回到这舱房的中间，这舱房大约长二十英尺，宽十英尺。至于高度，尼德·兰身材虽高，也没有能衡量出来。 半个钟头过去了，我们的情形一点没有改变，就在这时候，我们眼前的黑暗忽然转变为极度的光明。我们的牢狱突然明亮了，就是说，房中突然充满了十分强烈的发光体，我起初简直受不了这种光亮。看见这雪白、强烈的光，我认出，这就是发生在潜水艇周围，很美丽的磷光似的电光。我自然而然地闭了一下眼睛，一会儿又睁开，我看见光线是从装在舱顶上的一个半透明的半球体中发出来的。 “好了！我们能看清楚了广尼德·兰喊，手拿着刀，作防卫的姿势。“是的，我们能看清楚了，”我答，同时提出相反的意见，“不过我们的处境还是跟刚才一般黑暗。” “愿先生耐心些。”冷静的康塞尔说。 舱房的突然明亮正好使我可以仔细地看一下里面的环境。房中只有一张桌子和五张凳子。看不见门户，想是闭得很紧密。没有什么声响传到我们耳边来。在这艇的内部似乎是死一般的沉寂。它是走着呢，在海面上呢，还是在海底下呢？我没有法子猜测。 不过那个光明的球总不会无缘无故地亮起来。我估计船上就会有人来。如果人家忘记了我们，人家便不会使这所黑牢亮起来。 我果然没有想错。不久就听到门闩响，门开了，两个人走进来。 一个是身材短小，筋肉发达，两肩宽阔，躯体壮健，坚强的头颅，蓬蓬的黑发，浓浓的胡须，犀利的眼光，他的风度带有法国普罗丈斯省人所特有的那种南方人的气概。狄德罗①认为人的手势是富于譬喻的，真是说的对，现在这个短小的人正是这句活的活证据。可以感觉到，在他惯用的语言中，一定是充满了修辞学中的各种譬喻词汇。当然我并役有机会证实这事，因为他对我讲的是一种特异的、听不懂的话。 第二个来人更值得详细地加以描写。格拉第奥列②或恩格尔③的门徒一看他的容貌，可能就知道他是怎样一个人。用不着迟疑，我立刻看出这个人的主要特点：第一，自信，因为他的头高傲地摆在两肩形成的弧线中，他那漆黑的眼睛冷静地注视着人；第二，镇定，因为他的肤色，苍白不红，表示他血脉的安定；第三，强毅，这从他眼眶筋肉的迅速收缩看出来；最后，勇敢，因为他的深呼吸就表明了他的胁活力强。 我还要说，这个人的样子很高傲，他坚定的眼光好像反映出他高深的思艺。从他整个形貌来看。丛他的举止和表情的一致性来看，根据相面先生的说法，无疑地，他是个但白直率的人。 我看见这个人在面前，心中自然而然地觉得很安定，我预料我们的会谈将很顺利。 这个人究竟是三十五岁还是五十岁，我可不能确定。 他的身材高大，他的前额宽阔，鼻子笔直，嘴唇平正，牙齿齐整，两手细长，用手相学家的话来说，特别“精灵\"，就是说。正好配得上他富有情感的心灵。这人可能是我从来没有碰见过的最完美的人型。更有一个细微的特征，他的两个眼睛，彼此隔开略远一些，可以把整个一方景色同时收入眼帘中。这一特点——我在以后证实了——使他的眼力比尼德·兰的还要高强。当这个人注视着一件东西的时候，他紧喳起眉毛，微微合起他宽大的眼皮，这样，眼皮正好圈着眼珠，使得视野的范围缩小，他注视着！好厉害的眼光！远方缩小的物件都被他放大！他一眼便看透您的心事！在我们看来是很模糊的海波，他一目便能了然！他一眼便能看出海底深处的＝切情形！这两个陌生人，头上戴着水獭皮的便帽，脚上蹬着海豹皮的水靴，身上穿着特殊织物的衣服，腰身不紧，动作起来方便自如。两人中高大的一位——他显然是这船上的首脑——注意地打量着我们，一句话也不说。然后转身跟他的同伴谈了一会，他说的话我听不懂。这是一种响亮、和谐、婉转的语言，其中母音的声调好像变化很多。他的同伴一边点头一边回答，讲了几句完全听不懂的话。然后他的眼光回过来，好像直接问我。我拿法国话回答他，说我不懂他的诸；但他似乎不懂我说的什么，这情形真叫我相当为难。“先生就讲讲我们的经过情形好了，”康塞尔对我说，“这两位先生也许可能听懂几句！” 我重新讲述我们遭遇的经过，每个音节都念得清楚，一点细节都没有遗漏。我说出我们的姓名和身份，然后我正式介绍我们：阿龙纳斯教授，他的仆人康塞尔，鱼叉手尼德·兰师傅。 这个眼睛又温和又镇定的人，安详地、而且礼貌地、非常注意地听我说话。但他的面容没有露出一点迹象足以表明他听懂了我说的经过。当我说完了之后，他一句话也不说。 现在只有说英国活试试看。或者他可能听懂这种现在很通行的语言。我懂英语和德语，看书没有问题，可是谈话却还不行。但是，无论如何，总要想办法使人家听得懂。 “来吧，您来吧，我对鱼叉手说，”尼德·兰师傅，现在轮到您了，请您尽量从肚子里把英国人说的地道的英语拿出来。您想法比我说得更清楚一点。” 尼德·兰一点不推托，把我讲过的话又讲了一遍，他讲的我差不多都听得懂。内容是一样的，但形式不同了。加拿大人，由于他的性格，说话时很激动。他愤愤地埋怨人家蔑视人权，把我们关在这里，质问人家凭什么法律扣留我们，他引证了“人身保障法”的条文，说要控诉非法羁禁他的人，他全身激动，指手画脚，大声叫喊，最后，他用富于表情的手势，让对方明白，我们饿得要命。 这却是真话，但我们差不多完全忘记自己饿了。 鱼叉手很吃惊，因为他的话跟我说的一样，好像也没有为对方所了解。来看我们的这两个人，连眉头也没有皱一皱。很明显，他们既不懂得阿拉哥的语言，也不懂得法拉第①的语言。 我们所有的语言资本都拿出来了，可是并没有解决问题，我很为难，不知道怎么办才好，这时康塞尔对我说：“如果先生允许的活，我现在用德语来讲一讲。” “什么！你会说德语？”我喊。 “这不至于使先生不高兴吧，我像普通佛兰德人一样，会说德语。” “正相反，你会说德语，我很高兴。说吧，好小伙子.\"康塞尔拿他很镇定的语调，将我们的经过情形作了第三次的叙述。可是，不管讲述人怎样把话说得婉转漂亮，音调怎样和谐动听，德语也无济干事。最后，实在没有别的办法了，我极力想起我早年所学过的语言，我拿拉丁话来讲述我们的遭遇和经过。西赛罗①听了，可能要塞住耳朵，把我赶到厨房里去，可是，我也勉强对付着说完了。但结果还是白费。我们最后一次的尝试又失败了，这两个陌生人用那不可懂的语言彼此说了几句诸，他们就走开了，甚至于世界各国通用的使人安心的手势也没对我们做一下。门又关起来了。“这简直是太无耻了！”尼德·兰喊，他是第二十次发怒了。“怎么！我们给他们说法语、英语、德语、拉丁语，可是这些混蛋就没有一个人懂得礼貌，连理也不理！” “尼德·兰，安静些，”我对愤怒的鱼叉手说，“发脾气解决不了问题。” “但是，教授先生，”我们好动火的同伴答，“难道我们就这样饿死在这铁笼子里吗？” “算了吧!“康塞尔说，“只要心中放宽一些，我们还可以支持得很久！” “朋友们，不要失望，”我说，“我们现在是走在很坏的道路上。你们给我耐心等待一下，先说说你们对于这船的船长和船员的看法吧。” “我的看法就是这样，”尼德·兰答，“这些人是混“老实的尼德·兰，这个国家在地图上还没有绘出来哩，我承认这两个人的国籍实在很难断定！他们不是英国人，不是法国人，不是德国人，这是可以肯定的了。我倒想说这个船长和他的助手是生长在低纬度地带的人。他们身上带有南方人的特点。他们可能是西班牙人、土耳其人、阿拉伯人或印度人吗？但是他们的身型还不容许我下断语。至于他们的语言，那是完全无法懂得的。” “这就是不懂得各种语言的苦恼了，”康塞尔答，“也可以说世界上没有统一的语言真不方便！” “这有什么用呢！”尼德·兰答，“你们没有看见吗？这些人有他们自己的语言，这种语言好像是为了叫好人没法向他们讨饭吃才创造的！但是，在地球上所有的国家，张张嘴，动动牙床，咬咬齿和唇，这意思难道还不明白吗？在魁北克和在帕摩图一样，在巴黎和跟巴黎对面的城市一样，这不就是说我饿了，给我东西吃吗！” “呵！”康塞尔说，“真有那么不聪明的人！” 当他说这话的时候，房门开了，进来一个侍者，他给我们送来衣服，海上穿的上衣和短裤，衣服的质料我简直不认得。我赶快拿来穿上，我的同伴跟我一样，穿上了衣服。 这时候，侍者一可能是哑巴，也可能是聋子——把三份餐具放在桌上。 千这才像话，看来不是坏事。”康塞尔说。 “算了吧！”心中忿恨的鱼叉手说，“这里有什么可吃的？至多是甲鱼肝、鲨鱼片,海狗排罢了！” “我们看吧！”康塞尔说。 食品用银制的罩子盖着，两边对称地在桌布上摆好了，我们在饭桌前坐下。很显然，我们是跟有文化和有礼貌的人打交道，如果没有那照耀着我们的电光，我简直要以为自己不是在利物浦阿德费旅馆里，就是在巴黎的大饭店里。 可是我得声明一句，面包和酒完全没有。饮水很新鲜、很清凉，但不过是水，水不是尼德·兰爱喝的。在端来给我们吃的肉类中间，有几种我认得是烹调得很精致的鱼：但有几盘很好吃的菜，我说不出名日来，甚至于它们是植物是动物，我都不敢说。至于桌上的食具，更是精美，无可指摘。每一件东西，匙子、叉子、刀、盘，上面都有一个字母，字母周围有一句题词，我们照原来的样式抄在下面：MOBILLSiNMOBILD，动中之动①！这句题词只要把原来的IN字译成“中”字而不译成“上”字，就正好用在这只潜水船上。“N”可能是在海底下发号施令的那位神秘人物的姓名开头的一个字母！ 尼德·兰和康塞尔跟我不一样，并没有想得这么多。 他们在尽量地吃，我立刻也跟他们一样做。此外，我对，于我们的命运也放心了，据我看来事情很清楚，我们的主人决没有意思让我们俄死.可是，什么事都是有始有终的，都要过去的，就是饿眷肚子，十五小时没吃东西这样的事也不是例外的。现在矜们的肚子装满了，又迫切地感到需要睡觉了。我们跟死亡连续斗争了一夜，现在想睡觉也是很自然的。 “说真的，我真想好好地睡一觉。”康塞尔说。 “我也想睡一睡！”尼德·兰答。 我的两个同伴躺在舱房的地毯上，不久就呼呼地酣睡了。 至于我个人，虽然感到有睡觉的需要，可是却不那么容易睡得着。很多的思虑涌上心头，很多不可解决的问题塞满了我的脑子，很多的想象要我的眼睛睁开来!我们在哪儿？把我们带走的是什么奇异的力量？我感到——不如说我以为感到——这船正向海底最深的地方下沉。许多恶梦把我纠缠住了。我在这神秘的避难所里面，窥见一大群没人知道的动物，这只潜水艇似乎是它们的同类，它跟它们一样活着，一样动着，一样可怕！……之后，我的脑子安静下来，我蒙蒙咙陇地幻想着，不久也就沉沉地人睡了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/278.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里
