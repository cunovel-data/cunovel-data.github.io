{"id":13865,"no":10,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 10","content":"IT WAS THE ship\u0027s commander who had just spoken. At these words Ned Land stood up quickly. Nearly strangled, the steward staggered out at a signal from his superior; but such was the commander\u0027s authority aboard his vessel, not one gesture gave away the resentment that this man must have felt toward the Canadian. In silence we waited for the outcome of this scene; Conseil, in spite of himself, seemed almost fascinated, I was stunned. Arms crossed, leaning against a corner of the table, the commander studied us with great care. Was he reluctant to speak further? Did he regret those words he had just pronounced in French? You would have thought so. After a few moments of silence, which none of us would have dreamed of interrupting: \"Gentlemen,\" he said in a calm, penetrating voice, \"I speak French, English, German, and Latin with equal fluency. Hence I could have answered you as early as our initial interview, but first I wanted to make your acquaintance and then think things over. Your four versions of the same narrative, perfectly consistent by and large, established your personal identities for me. I now know that sheer chance has placed in my presence Professor Pierre Aronnax, specialist in natural history at the Paris Museum and entrusted with a scientific mission abroad, his manservant Conseil, and Ned Land, a harpooner of Canadian origin aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a frigate in the national navy of the United States of America.\" I bowed in agreement. The commander hadn\u0027t put a question to me. So no answer was called for. This man expressed himself with perfect ease and without a trace of an accent. His phrasing was clear, his words well chosen, his facility in elocution remarkable. And yet, to me, he didn\u0027t have \"the feel\" of a fellow countryman. He went on with the conversation as follows: \"No doubt, sir, you\u0027ve felt that I waited rather too long before paying you this second visit. After discovering your identities, I wanted to weigh carefully what policy to pursue toward you. I had great difficulty deciding. Some extremely inconvenient circumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who has cut himself off from humanity. Your coming has disrupted my whole existence.\" \"Unintentionally,\" I said. \"Unintentionally?\" the stranger replied, raising his voice a little. \"Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln hunted me on every sea? Was it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that frigate? Was it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship\u0027s hull? Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land hit me with his harpoon?\" I detected a controlled irritation in these words. But there was a perfectly natural reply to these charges, and I made it. \"Sir,\" I said, \"you\u0027re surely unaware of the discussions that have taken place in Europe and America with yourself as the subject. You don\u0027t realize that various accidents, caused by collisions with your underwater machine, have aroused public passions on those two continents. I\u0027ll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we\u0027ve tried to explain this inexplicable phenomenon, whose secret is yours alone. But please understand that the Abraham Lincoln chased you over the Pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful marine monster, which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost.\" A half smile curled the commander\u0027s lips; then, in a calmer tone: \"Professor Aronnax,\" he replied, \"do you dare claim that your frigate wouldn\u0027t have chased and cannonaded an underwater boat as readily as a monster?\" This question baffled me, since Commander Farragut would certainly have shown no such hesitation. He would have seen it as his sworn duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly as a gigantic narwhale. \"So you understand, sir,\" the stranger went on, \"that I have a right to treat you as my enemy.\" I kept quiet, with good reason. What was the use of debating such a proposition, when superior force can wipe out the best arguments? \"It took me a good while to decide,\" the commander went on. \"Nothing obliged me to grant you hospitality. If I were to part company with you, I\u0027d have no personal interest in ever seeing you again. I could put you back on the platform of this ship that has served as your refuge. I could sink under the sea, and I could forget you ever existed. Wouldn\u0027t that be my right?\" \"Perhaps it would be the right of a savage,\" I replied. \"But not that of a civilized man.\" \"Professor,\" the commander replied swiftly, \"I\u0027m not what you term a civilized man! I\u0027ve severed all ties with society, for reasons that I alone have the right to appreciate. Therefore I obey none of its regulations, and I insist that you never invoke them in front of me!\" This was plain speaking. A flash of anger and scorn lit up the stranger\u0027s eyes, and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man\u0027s life. Not only had he placed himself beyond human laws, he had rendered himself independent, out of all reach, free in the strictest sense of the word! For who would dare chase him to the depths of the sea when he thwarted all attacks on the surface? What ship could withstand a collision with his underwater Monitor? What armor plate, no matter how heavy, could bear the thrusts of his spur? No man among men could call him to account for his actions. God, if he believed in Him, his conscience if he had one-- these were the only judges to whom he was answerable. These thoughts swiftly crossed my mind while this strange individual fell silent, like someone completely self-absorbed. I regarded him with a mixture of fear and fascination, in the same way, no doubt, that Oedipus regarded the Sphinx. After a fairly long silence, the commander went on with our conversation. \"So I had difficulty deciding,\" he said. \"But I concluded that my personal interests could be reconciled with that natural compassion to which every human being has a right. Since fate has brought you here, you\u0027ll stay aboard my vessel. You\u0027ll be free here, and in exchange for that freedom, moreover totally related to it, I\u0027ll lay on you just one condition. Your word that you\u0027ll submit to it will be sufficient.\" \"Go on, sir,\" I replied. \"I assume this condition is one an honest man can accept?\" \"Yes, sir. Just this. It\u0027s possible that certain unforeseen events may force me to confine you to your cabins for some hours, or even for some days as the case may be. Since I prefer never to use violence, I expect from you in such a case, even more than in any other, your unquestioning obedience. By acting in this way, I shield you from complicity, I absolve you of all responsibility, since I myself make it impossible for you to see what you aren\u0027t meant to see. Do you accept this condition?\" So things happened on board that were quite odd to say the least, things never to be seen by people not placing themselves beyond society\u0027s laws! Among all the surprises the future had in store for me, this would not be the mildest. \"We accept,\" I replied. \"Only, I\u0027ll ask your permission, sir, to address a question to you, just one.\" \"Go ahead, sir.\" \"You said we\u0027d be free aboard your vessel?\" \"Completely.\" \"Then I would ask what you mean by this freedom.\" \"Why, the freedom to come, go, see, and even closely observe everything happening here--except under certain rare circumstances-- in short, the freedom we ourselves enjoy, my companions and I.\" It was obvious that we did not understand each other. \"Pardon me, sir,\" I went on, \"but that\u0027s merely the freedom that every prisoner has, the freedom to pace his cell! That\u0027s not enough for us.\" \"Nevertheless, it will have to do!\" \"What! We must give up seeing our homeland, friends, and relatives ever again?\" \"Yes, sir. But giving up that intolerable earthly yoke that some men call freedom is perhaps less painful than you think!\" \"By thunder!\" Ned Land shouted. \"I\u0027ll never promise I won\u0027t try getting out of here!\" \"I didn\u0027t ask for such a promise, Mr. Land,\" the commander replied coldly. \"Sir,\" I replied, flaring up in spite of myself, \"you\u0027re taking unfair advantage of us! This is sheer cruelty!\" \"No, sir, it\u0027s an act of mercy! You\u0027re my prisoners of war! I\u0027ve cared for you when, with a single word, I could plunge you back into the ocean depths! You attacked me! You\u0027ve just stumbled on a secret no living man must probe, the secret of my entire existence! Do you think I\u0027ll send you back to a world that must know nothing more of me? Never! By keeping you on board, it isn\u0027t you whom I care for, it\u0027s me!\" These words indicated that the commander pursued a policy impervious to arguments. \"Then, sir,\" I went on, \"you give us, quite simply, a choice between life and death?\" \"Quite simply.\" \"My friends,\" I said, \"to a question couched in these terms, our answer can be taken for granted. But no solemn promises bind us to the commander of this vessel.\" \"None, sir,\" the stranger replied. Then, in a gentler voice, he went on: \"Now, allow me to finish what I have to tell you. I\u0027ve heard of you, Professor Aronnax. You, if not your companions, won\u0027t perhaps complain too much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together. Among the books that make up my favorite reading, you\u0027ll find the work you\u0027ve published on the great ocean depths. I\u0027ve pored over it. You\u0027ve taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go. But you don\u0027t know everything because you haven\u0027t seen everything. Let me tell you, professor, you won\u0027t regret the time you spend aboard my vessel. You\u0027re going to voyage through a land of wonders. Stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind. It will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before your eyes. I\u0027m going to make another underwater tour of the world-- perhaps my last, who knows?--and I\u0027ll review everything I\u0027ve studied in the depths of these seas that I\u0027ve crossed so often, and you can be my fellow student. Starting this very day, you\u0027ll enter a new element, you\u0027ll see what no human being has ever seen before-- since my men and I no longer count--and thanks to me, you\u0027re going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet.\" I can\u0027t deny it; the commander\u0027s words had a tremendous effect on me. He had caught me on my weak side, and I momentarily forgot that not even this sublime experience was worth the loss of my freedom. Besides, I counted on the future to resolve this important question. So I was content to reply: \"Sir, even though you\u0027ve cut yourself off from humanity, I can see that you haven\u0027t disowned all human feeling. We\u0027re castaways whom you\u0027ve charitably taken aboard, we\u0027ll never forget that. Speaking for myself, I don\u0027t rule out that the interests of science could override even the need for freedom, which promises me that, in exchange, our encounter will provide great rewards.\" I thought the commander would offer me his hand, to seal our agreement. He did nothing of the sort. I regretted that. \"One last question,\" I said, just as this inexplicable being seemed ready to withdraw. \"Ask it, professor.\" \"By what name am I to call you?\" \"Sir,\" the commander replied, \"to you, I\u0027m simply Captain Nemo;* to me, you and your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus.\" *Latin: nemo means \"no one.\" Ed. Captain Nemo called out. A steward appeared. The captain gave him his orders in that strange language I couldn\u0027t even identify. Then, turning to the Canadian and Conseil: \"A meal is waiting for you in your cabin,\" he told them. \"Kindly follow this man.\" \"That\u0027s an offer I can\u0027t refuse!\" the harpooner replied. After being confined for over thirty hours, he and Conseil were finally out of this cell. \"And now, Professor Aronnax, our own breakfast is ready. Allow me to lead the way.\" \"Yours to command, captain.\" I followed Captain Nemo, and as soon as I passed through the doorway, I went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled a gangway on a ship. After a stretch of some ten meters, a second door opened before me. I then entered a dining room, decorated and furnished in austere good taste. Inlaid with ebony trim, tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room, and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware, porcelain, and glass of incalculable value. There silver-plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling, whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs. In the center of this room stood a table, richly spread. Captain Nemo indicated the place I was to occupy. \"Be seated,\" he told me, \"and eat like the famished man you must be.\" Our breakfast consisted of several dishes whose contents were all supplied by the sea, and some foods whose nature and derivation were unknown to me. They were good, I admit, but with a peculiar flavor to which I would soon grow accustomed. These various food items seemed to be rich in phosphorous, and I thought that they, too, must have been of marine origin. Captain Nemo stared at me. I had asked him nothing, but he read my thoughts, and on his own he answered the questions I was itching to address him. \"Most of these dishes are new to you,\" he told me. \"But you can consume them without fear. They\u0027re healthy and nourishing. I renounced terrestrial foods long ago, and I\u0027m none the worse for it. My crew are strong and full of energy, and they eat what I eat.\" \"So,\" I said, \"all these foods are products of the sea?\" \"Yes, professor, the sea supplies all my needs. Sometimes I cast my nets in our wake, and I pull them up ready to burst. Sometimes I go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man\u0027s reach, and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests. Like the flocks of old Proteus, King Neptune\u0027s shepherd, my herds graze without fear on the ocean\u0027s immense prairies. There I own vast properties that I harvest myself, and which are forever sown by the hand of the Creator of All Things.\" I stared at Captain Nemo in definite astonishment, and I answered him: \"Sir, I understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish for your table; I understand less how you can chase aquatic game in your underwater forests; but how a piece of red meat, no matter how small, can figure in your menu, that I don\u0027t understand at all.\" \"Nor I, sir,\" Captain Nemo answered me. \"I never touch the flesh of land animals.\" \"Nevertheless, this . . . ,\" I went on, pointing to a dish where some slices of loin were still left. \"What you believe to be red meat, professor, is nothing other than loin of sea turtle. Similarly, here are some dolphin livers you might mistake for stewed pork. My chef is a skillful food processor who excels at pickling and preserving these various exhibits from the ocean. Feel free to sample all of these foods. Here are some preserves of sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled in the entire world, here\u0027s cream from milk furnished by the udders of cetaceans, and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea; and finally, allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone, equal to that from the tastiest fruits.\" So I sampled away, more as a curiosity seeker than an epicure, while Captain Nemo delighted me with his incredible anecdotes. \"But this sea, Professor Aronnax,\" he told me, \"this prodigious, inexhaustible wet nurse of a sea not only feeds me, she dresses me as well. That fabric covering you was woven from the masses of filaments that anchor certain seashells; as the ancients were wont to do, it was dyed with purple ink from the murex snail and shaded with violet tints that I extract from a marine slug, the Mediterranean sea hare. The perfumes you\u0027ll find on the washstand in your cabin were produced from the oozings of marine plants. Your mattress was made from the ocean\u0027s softest eelgrass. Your quill pen will be whalebone, your ink a juice secreted by cuttlefish or squid. Everything comes to me from the sea, just as someday everything will return to it!\" \"You love the sea, captain.\" \"Yes, I love it! The sea is the be all and end all! It covers seven-tenths of the planet earth. Its breath is clean and healthy. It\u0027s an immense wilderness where a man is never lonely, because he feels life astir on every side. The sea is simply the vehicle for a prodigious, unearthly mode of existence; it\u0027s simply movement and love; it\u0027s living infinity, as one of your poets put it. And in essence, professor, nature is here made manifest by all three of her kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal. The last of these is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups, three classes of articulates, five classes of mollusks, and three vertebrate classes: mammals, reptiles, and those countless legions of fish, an infinite order of animals totaling more than 13,000 species, of which only one-tenth belong to fresh water. The sea is a vast pool of nature. Our globe began with the sea, so to speak, and who can say we won\u0027t end with it! Here lies supreme tranquility. The sea doesn\u0027t belong to tyrants. On its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live! Live in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I recognize no superiors! Here I\u0027m free!\" Captain Nemo suddenly fell silent in the midst of this enthusiastic outpouring. Had he let himself get carried away, past the bounds of his habitual reserve? Had he said too much? For a few moments he strolled up and down, all aquiver. Then his nerves grew calmer, his facial features recovered their usual icy composure, and turning to me: \"Now, professor,\" he said, \"if you\u0027d like to inspect the Nautilus, I\u0027m yours to command.\" 说这诺的人正是这船的船长。 尼德·兰听到这些话，立刻站了起来。侍者被掐得半死不活，看见他的主人一招手，便蹒跚地走出去了，一点也没有流露他对加拿大人的愤恨，这说明了船长在船上有很高的威信。康塞尔不禁有点奇怪，我也吓得发愣，我们默默等待这事的结局。 船长交叉着两手，靠着桌子的一角，注意地观察我们。他不说话，是因为有顾虑吗？他后悔刚才不该用法语说那些话吗？我们不妨这样设想。 我们谁也不想打破沉默，过了一会儿，他才用很镇定。很感动人的声调说： “先生们，我会说法语、英语、德语和拉丁语。我本来可以在我们初次会见的时候回答你们，不过我想先认识你们，然后再考虑。你们把事实经过复述了四遍，内容完全相同，这使我肯定了你们的身份，我现在知道，偶然的机会使得我碰见了负有出国作科学考察使命的巴黎博物馆生物学教授彼埃尔·阿龙纳斯先生，他的仆人康塞尔以及北美合众国海军部林肯号战舰上的鱼叉手、加拿大人尼德·兰。” 我点点头，表示同意。船长向我提的不是问题，我没有必要回答。这人说法语一点不费力，没有任何土音。他用的句子很正确，词汇很恰当，说的话流畅通达。可是我总感。觉不出他是我的法国同胞。 他继续说下去，他这样说： “先生，我现在才再一次来访问你们，你们一定认为我耽搁得大久了。所以这样，是因为我知道了你们的身份以后，要仔细考虑一下应该怎样对待你们，我很迟疑不决。最为难的是你们在跟一个与人类不相往来的人打交道。你们打乱了我的生活……” “这不是故意的。”我说。 “不是故意的吗？”这个人把声音提高了一点回答,\"林肯号在海面上到处追逐我，难道是无意的吗？你们上这艘战舰，难道不是故意的吗？你们用炮弹轰我的船，难道不是故意的吗？尼德·兰师傅用鱼叉打我的船，难道也不是故意的吗?\"“我看得出在这些话里面，含有一种隐忍不发的愤怒。但对于他提出的这些责问，我有个很有道理的回答，我就说： “先生，您一定不知道关于您的问题在美洲和欧洲所引起的争论。您不知道由于您的潜水艇的冲撞所发生的各种意外事件，已经哄动了两个大陆。现在我不想告诉您，人们为了解释那唯有您才知道其中奥妙的神秘现象所做的无数假设。，但您要知道，林肯号一直追逐您到太平洋北部海面。仍然认为是追打一种海怪，非把它从海洋中清除掉不可呢。” 船长的唇上浮现出微笑，然后语气比较温和地回答： “阿龙纳斯先生，您敢肯定你们的战舰不是去追击潜水艇而只是追击海怪吗？” 这个问题使我很难回答，因为，法拉古舰长肯定是不会迟疑的，他一定相信，消灭这类潜水艇和打击巨大的独角鲸，同样是他的职责。 “先生，您要知道，”这个人又说，“我是有权利把你们当作敌人看待的。” 我故意不回答。因为碰到蛮不讲理的时候,再来讨论这类题目还有什么意义呢？ “我犹豫了很久，”船长又说，“我没有任何义务接待你们。如果我要撇开你们，我就不想再来看你们了。我会把际们重新放在曾经作为你们避难所的这只船的平台上，就当你们没有存在一样，只管潜入海中。难道我没有这样的权利吗？” “这也许是野蛮人的权利，”我答，“而不是文明人的权利.\" “教授先生，”船长很激动地回答，“我不是你们所说的文明人，为了我个人才能感觉到的理由，我跟整个人类社会断绝了关系。所以我不服从人类社会的法规。希望您以后不要再在我面前提这些东西了。” 这话说得十分干脆。这人眼中闪出愤怒和轻蔑的光芒，我看得出这个人的生活中一定有过一段不平凡的经历。他不单把自己放在人类的法律之外，而且使自己绝对的独立、自由，不受任何约束！既然人家在海面上和他交手都被他打败了，谁还敢到海底下去追赶他呢？什么船能吃得消他这艘潜水艇的冲击呢？不管钢板多么厚的铁甲舰，哪一艘能吃得消它的冲角的一撞呢？没有一个人能质问他所做的事。如果他相信上帝，如果他还有良心，那么只有上帝。只有良心，是他可以依据的唯一公断人了。 以上的这些感想在我心中很快地闪过去，这个奇怪的人当时默不作声，潜心思索，好像什么也不理会了。我既害怕又好奇地注视着他，像俄狄浦斯①注视人面狮身怪一样。 经过长久的沉默以后，船长又开口了，他说： “因此，我迟疑不决，但是我认为，我的利益是能够与人类天生的那种同情心相一致的。既然命运把你们送到这里来，你们就留在我的船上吧。你们在船上是自由的，但为了换得这种自由——毕竟是相对的自由，我要你们答应我一个条件，你们只要口头上答应就可以了。” “先生，您说吧，”我答，“我想这条件一定是一个正直的人可以接受的条件。” “是的，先生，条件是这样。可能因为某种意外的事件，我不得不把你们关在你们住的舱房里，关上几小时，或是关上几天。我决不愿使用暴力，我希望你们在这种情况下，在任何其它情况下也一样，要绝对服从。这样做，一切都由我负责，与你们丝毫无关，因为我不要你们看见你们所不应度看的。你们能接受这条件吗？\" 这样看来，船上一定有很离奇古怪的事，这事是服从社会法律的人不应该看的！那么，在我将来可能碰到的惊奇事件当中，这一定是非同小可的一件。 “我们接受，”我答，“但是，先生，我要求您允许我向您提一个问题，仅仅是一个。” “说吧，先生。” “您刚才说我们在船上可以自由，是不是？” “完全自由。” “我要问您，您所说的是怎样的自由？” “就是往来行动、耳闻目见的自由，甚至于有观察船上、一切的自由——某些特殊情况除外——就是跟我们（我的 同伴和我）享有同样的自由。” 显然的，我们彼此都没有领会对方的意思。我于是又说： “请原谅，先生，这种自由不过是国徒可以在监狱中走动的自由！这种自由对于我们并不够。” “可是，对这种自由你们应当感到满足了。” “什么! 我们将永不能再见我们的祖国，我们的朋友，我们的亲人吗！？” “是的，先生，这不过是使您不再受那世俗的束缚罢了。这种束缚，人们还以为是自由，抛弃了它，不至于像你们所想象的那么难受吧！” “好家伙!\"尼德·兰喊道，“我决不能保证我以后不想法逃走!\" “尼德·兰师傅，我井没有要您保证。”船长冷淡地回答。 “先生，”我说，我不由自主地生气了，“您倚势欺人！太蛮横了！” “不，先生，这不是蛮横，这是仁慈！你们是我在战斗以后的俘虏！那时，我只要说一句话就能把你们送到海底下去，但是我留下你们！你们攻击过我！你们盗窃了世上任何人都不应该知道的一种秘密，就是我一生的秘密！您以为我会把你们送回那再不应该看见我的陆地上去吗？那永不能！现在我所以要把你们留在这儿，并不是为了你们，实在是为我自己！” 从这些话可以看出，船长是非常固执的，任何理由都改变不了他的成见. “先生，”我又说，“这样看来，您只是让我们在生死之间抉择罢了。” “正是这样.\" “对于这样提出的问题，我的朋友们就没有什么话可说了。”我说，”但我要声明，我们现在对于这只船上的主人并不受任何诺言的约束。” “先生，您并不受任何诺言的约束。”这个神秘的人回答。 随后，他用比较温和的口气说： “现在，请允许我说完我要跟您说的话。阿龙纳斯先生，我了解您。其实, 您也许不至于和您的同伴一样，会抱怨这个偶然把你们跟我的命运连结在一起的机会吧！在我喜欢研究的书籍中，您可以找到您发表的那本关于海底秘密的著作。我时常阅读这本书。地上的学问可以使您达到的，在您的著作中已经达到了。但您还不是什么都懂，还不是什么都看见过。教授，让我跟您说，您决不至懊悔您在我船上度过的时光。您以后将到神奇的世界中游历。震惊、奇怪，将是您心情中惯有的状态。，那不断呈现在您眼前的奇异景象会使您百看不厌。我在下一次周游海底世界的时候，（也许这是最后一次，谁知道？）又要在我跑过许多次的海底下看见我曾经研究过的一切事物，那时您将变为我这一次科学研究的同伴。从这一天起，您将进入一个新元素的世界，您将看见世界上除了我和我的同伴之外任何人都没有看到过的东西，由于我，我们的星球将把它最后的秘密玄给您。” 我不能否认船长的这些话对我发生了很大的影响，正好说中了我的心事；我暂时忘记了观看这些伟大的东西并不能抵偿我们失去了的自由！我甚至于想搁下自由的问题，留待以后再作打算。所以我只是这样回答他： “先生,您虽然跟人类世界不相往来，但我想您还没有公开否认人的情感。我们是被您好心收留在您船上的受难者，我们忘不了您的好意。至于我，如果因为科学的关系可以把自由忘记的话，那我很知道，我们两人的相遇可能给我巨大的补偿。\" 我想，船长是一定要跟我握手，借此表示我们的意见是一致的。但他并不这样做。我真替他惋惜。 “最后一个问题。”当这个神秘的人物想退出去的时候，我对他说。 “教授先生，您说吧。” “我应当怎样称呼您呢？” “先生，”船长回答，“在您来说，我不过是尼摩①船长，在我来说，您和您的同伴不过是诺第留斯②号的乘客。” 尼摩船长喊人，一个侍者进来。船长用我听不懂的那种语言吩咐了几句。然后他转身对加拿大人和康塞尔说： “在你们的舱房里，正等着你们进餐呢，请你们跟着这个人去.\" “这个，我不拒绝！”鱼叉手回答。 于是康塞尔和他走出关了他们三十多小时的这间小房子。 “阿龙纳斯先生，现在我们的午餐已经准备好了，让我给您引路。” “船长，我当然听您的吩咐。” 我跟在船长后面走，一出房门，便走上一条有电光照耀。的走廊，像是船上的过道。约走了十多米以后，第二道门在我们面前打开。 我于是走进了餐厅，餐厅内的摆设和家具都十分讲究小餐厅的两端摆着镶嵌乌木花饰的高大橡木餐橱，在架子的隔板上，有价值不可估量的闪闪发光的陶器、瓷器、玻璃制品。金银制的餐具在由天花板倾泻的光线下显得辉煌夺目，天花板上绘有精美的图画，使光线更加柔和而悦目。 餐厅的中间摆着一桌丰盛的菜。尼摩船长指给我坐的位于。他对我说： “请坐，请吃，您已经好久不吃东西了，请不要客气。” 午餐有好几道菜，全是海里的东西，其中有些荤菜，我简直不知道它们的性质和出处。我承认这些食品都很好，虽然有一种特殊味道，但我也吃得惯。这些式样不同的菜看来都富于磷质，所以我想这一定全是海中的产物。 尼摩船长看着我。我并没有问他，但他猜到了我的心事，他就主动地答复我急于要向他提出的问题。他说： “这些菜大部分您以前都没见过。但您可以放心大胆地吃，不必害怕。这些菜很卫生，而且富有营养。很久以夹，我就不吃陆地上的食物了，我的身体也并不见得差。我砌船员——个个都身强力壮——他们和我一样都吃这种食品. “那么，”我说，“所有的食品都是海产吗？” “是的，教授，大海供应我一切必需品。有时我抛下拖网，等网满得都要断了就把它拉上来。有时我到那看来人没法去的大海中间打猎，我追逐那些居住在我的海底森林中的野味。我的牛羊家畜，像尼普顿①的老牧人的一样，无忧无虑地在那广阔的海底牧场上吃草。我在海底有一笔巨大的产业，这产业是由造物主亲手播种的。” 我有点惊异，看着尼摩船长，我这样回答他： “先生，我完全相信您的鱼网能供应这桌上的许多鱼类，我也了解您如何在您的海底森林中打猎，但是我一点不明白在您的菜单上，如何能有肉类——尽管很少？” “先生，”尼摩船长回答，“我从来也不吃陆上动物的肉。” “不过，这是什么呢？”我手指着一个盘子里还剩下的几块肉说。 “教授，您以为这是牛肉吗？其实它不过是海鳖的里臀。这盘是海豚的肝，您或者要以为是炖猪肉。我的厨师是一位很精干的炊事员，他善于保藏海中各种不同的产物。猜尝一尝这些菜。这是一盘罐头海参，马来亚人说这是世界上美味无比的食物。这是奶油糕，所用的奶是从鲸鱼类的奶头上挤出来的，糖是从北极海中的一种大海藻里提炼：出来的。最后我请您尝这秋牡丹的果子酱，它的味道并不亚于最蜜甜的果子酱。” 我一一尝过了，与其说是由于贪食，不如说是由于好奇；同时尼摩船长讲他那不可思议的、似真似假的故事，使我听得心醉神迷。他说： “阿龙纳斯先生，这海, 这奇妙的、取之不尽的生命泉源，不仅仅给我吃的，并且还给我穿的。现在您身上穿的衣料是由一种贝壳类的足丝织成的，染上古人喜欢的绊红色。又调配上我从地中海海兔类中取出的紫色。您在舱房中梳洗台上看到的香料，是从海产植物提炼出来的。您睡的床是侮中最软和的大叶海藻做的。您使的笔是鲸鱼的触须，墨水是墨鱼或乌贼分泌的汁。现在海给我一切，正像将来一切都要归还它一样！” “船长，您爱海吧？” “是的，我爱海！海是包罗万象的！海占地球面积的十分之七。海的气息纯洁而卫生。在这汪洋浩瀚的大海中，人们不是孤独的，园为他们感到在自己周围处处都有生命在颤动；海之为物是超越的、神妙的生存之乘舆；海是动，海是爱，正像你们法国一位大诗人所说的③，它是长存的生命。的确，教授，自然界在海中也同样有动物、植物、矿物三类。动物在海中可以大量地繁殖，主要的有腔肠动物四类，节肢动物三类，软体动物五类，脊椎动物三类，即哺乳类，爬虫类和成群无数的鱼类。鱼类是动物中无穷无尽的一目…共有一万三千多种，其中只有十分之一是在淡水中。海是大自然的仓库。可以说，地球是从海开始的，谁知道将来地球不是归给于海呢！海中有无比和平的环境。海不属于压迫者。在海面上，他们还可以使用他们的暴力，在那里互相攻打，在那里互相吞噬，把陆地上的各种恐怖手段都搬到那里。但在海平面三十英尺以下，他们的权力便达不到了，他们的气焰便熄灭了，他们的成势便消失了！啊！先生，您要生活，就生活在海中吧！只是在海中才有独立！在海中敌不承认有什么主子：在海中我是完全自由的！” 尼摩船长正说得兴高采烈的时候，他忽然停住不作声了。他是超出了他惯常的沉默，还是说得过多了呢？霎时间，他踱来踱去，情绪很激动。过了一会儿，他的神经安静下来，他的面容又现出惯常的冷淡神气，他转身对我说： “现在，教授，如果您愿意参观我们的诺第留斯号，我愿意为您效劳，我领您看去。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/280.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
