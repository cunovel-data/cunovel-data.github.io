{"id":13901,"no":46,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 23","content":"Thus ends the voyage under the seas. What passed during that night-how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom-how Ned Land, Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.\n But when I returned to consciousness, I was lying in a fisherman\u0027s hut, on the Loffoden Isles. My two companions, safe and sound, were near me holding my hands. We embraced each other heartily. At that moment we could not think of returning to France. The means of communication between the north of Norway and the south are rare. And I am therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from Cape North.\n And, among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, I revise my record of these adventures once more. Not a fact has been omitted, not a detail exaggerated. It is a faithful narrative of this incredible expedition in an element inaccessible to man, but to which Progress will one day open a road.\n Shall I be believed? I do not know. And it matters little, after all. What I now affirm is, that I have a right to speak of these seas, under which, in less than ten months, I have crossed 20,000 leagues in that submarine tour of the world, which has revealed so many wonders. But what has become of the Nautilus? Did it resist the pressure of the maelstrom? Does Captain Nemo still live? And does he still follow under the ocean those frightful retaliations? Or, did he stop after the last hecatomb? Will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the history of his life? Shall I ever know the name of this man? Will the missing vessel tell us by its nationality that of Captain Nemo? I hope so. And I also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the sea at its most terrible gulf, and that the Nautilus has survived where so many other vessels have been lost! If it be so--if Captain Nemo still inhabits the ocean, his adopted country, may hatred be appeased in that savage heart! May the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance! May the judge disappear, and the philosopher continue the peaceful exploration of the sea! If his destiny be strange, it is also sublime. Have I not understood it myself? Have I not lived ten months of this unnatural life? And to the question asked by Ecclesiastes three thousand years ago, \"That which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?\" two men alone of all now living have the right to give an answer---CAPTAIN NEMO AND MYSELF.\n 下面就是我们这次海底旅行的结论。那天夜间的经过，小艇怎样逃出北冰洋大风暴的可怕漩涡，尼德·兰、康塞尔和我，我们怎样脱离这个无底深渊，我可不能说。但当我醒过来的时候，我躺在罗夫丹群岛上一个渔人的木头房子里面。我的两个同伴，安全无事，在我身边，双手紧紧按着我。我们热情地互相拥抱。\n 这时候，我们不能打算立即回法国去。挪威北部和南部的交通工具是很稀少的。所以我没有办法，只能等待半个月开行一次，往来北角的汽船经过这边才能走。\n 因此，就是在这些收留我们的善良老实的人们中间，我把这次新奇惊险的纪事重新翻阅一下。这些纪事是完全正确的。没有漏记一件事实，也没有夸张一处细节。它是那不可设想为真的、在人迹不能到的海底下作的这次新奇探险的忠实记录，当然，有一天学术进步，这海底是要变为可以自由通行的。\n 人们相信我的记录吗？那我可不知道。信不信，到底也没有什么关系。我现在可以肯定的是，我有权利和理由来讲这些海洋，在不到十个月的时间中，我在这些海洋底下走过了两万里，来讲这次穿过太平洋，印度洋、红海、地中海、大西洋、南北两极海洋，给我现出无限神奇的海底环球旅行！\n 可是，诺第留斯号怎样了？它抵住了北冰洋大风暴的压力吗？尼摩船长还活着吗？他在海洋底下继续执行他的可怕报复吗？或者他在上一次的大屠杀后，就停止了报复吗？海波有一天能把写有他整个生活历史的手稿带到人间来吗？到底我可能知道这个人的真名字吗？那只隐没不见的潜水船可以表明它的国籍，同时把尼摩船长的国籍也告诉我们吗？\n 我希望能这样。我同时又希望，他的强有力的潜水船战胜了那海洋中最可怕的深渊，诺第留斯号在无数的船只都沉没了的海上独能存在！如果事实是这样，如果尼摩船长老是居住在他所选择的祖国海洋中，但愿所有的仇恨都在这颗倔强的心中平息！但愿海底无限神奇的潜心静观熄灭他心中的复仇情绪！但愿他这个裁判执行人潜没无踪！\n 但愿他这个高明的学者继续作和平的探海工作！固然他的命运是离奇古怪，但他也是崇高伟大的。＝我自己不是了解他吗？我不是也亲自过了十个月的这种超自然的生活吗？\n 所以，对于六千年前《传道书》①中提出的这个问题：“谁能有一天测透这深渊的最深处呢？”现在，世上所有的人们中间，有两个人有权利来回答这问题了。这两个人就是尼麾船长和我。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209/316.html","bookId":366,"book":{"id":366,"title":"海底两万里 Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea","description":"简介： 主要讲述鹦鹉螺号（Nautilus，或音译为诺第留斯号）的故事。1866年，当时海上发现了一只被断定为独角鲸的大怪物，阿龙纳斯受邀参加追捕，在追捕过程中不幸落水，泅到怪物的脊背上。发现这怪物并非什么独角鲸，而是一艘构造奇妙的潜水艇。潜水艇是船长尼摩在大洋中的一座...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/110129/1-1101291004170-L.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/209","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
