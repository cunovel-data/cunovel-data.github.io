{"id":42389,"no":5,"title":"Chapter III—In Quest Of Fortune.","content":"James had so persuaded himself that the sea was his vocation, and was so convinced of the pleasures and advantages it would bring, that it had not occurred to him that his mother would object. \"What made you think of the sea, James?\" his mother asked with a troubled face. \"It was the books I read last year, at the black salter\u0027s. Oh, mother, did you ever read Marryatt\u0027s novels, and \u0027Sinbad the Sailor\u0027?\" \"I have read \u0027Sinbad the Sailor,\u0027 but you know that is a fairy story, my son.\" \"It may be, but Marryatt\u0027s stories are not. It must be splendid to travel across the mighty ocean, and see foreign countries.\" \"A sailor doesn\u0027t have the chance to see much. You have no idea of the hardships of his life.\" \"I am used to hardships, and I am not afraid of hard work. But you seem disappointed, mother. What have you thought of for me?\" \"I have hoped, James, that you might become a learned man, perhaps a college professor. Surely that would be better than to be a common sailor.\" \"But I wouldn\u0027t stay a common sailor, mother. I would be a captain some time.\" I suppose there is no doubt that, had James followed the sea, he would have risen to the command of a ship, but the idea did not seem to dazzle his mother. \"If you go to sea I shall lose you,\" said his mother. \"A sailor can spend very little time with his family. Think carefully, my son. I believe your present fancy will be short-lived, and you will some day wonder that you ever entertained it.\" Such, however, was not the boy\u0027s idea at the time. His mother might have reason on her side, but it takes more than reason to dissipate a boy\u0027s passion for the sea. \"You speak of my becoming a scholar, mother,\" he said, \"but there doesn\u0027t seem much chance of it. I see nothing but work as a carpenter, or on the farm.\" \"You don\u0027t know what God may have in store for you, my son. As you say, there seems no way open at present for you to become a scholar; but if you entertain the desire the way will be open. Success comes to him who is in earnest.\" \"What, then, do you want me to do, mother! Do you wish me to stay at home?\" \"No, for there seems little for you to do here. Go to Cleveland, if you like, and seek some respectable employment. If, after a time, you find your longing for the sea unconquered, it will be time to look out for a berth on board ship.\" James, in spite of his earnest longing to go to sea, was a reasonable boy, and he did not object to his mother\u0027s plan. The next morning he tied his slender stock of clothing in a small bundle, bade a tearful good-bye to his mother, whose loving glances followed him far along his road, and with hope and enthusiasm trudged over a hard road to Cleveland, that beautiful city, whither, nearly forty years afterward, he was to be carried in funereal state, amid the tears of countless thousands. In that city where his active life began, it was to finish. A long walk was before him, for Cleveland was seventeen miles away. He stopped to rest at intervals, and it was not until the sun had set and darkness enveloped the town that he entered it with weary feet. He betook himself to a cheap boarding-place whither he had been directed, and soon retired to bed. His fatigue brought him a good night\u0027s sleep, and he woke refreshed and cheered to look about him and decide upon his future plans. Cleveland does not compare in size with New York, Philadelphia, or Boston, and thirty-five years ago it was much smaller than now. But compared with James\u0027 native place, and the villages near him, it was an impressive place. There were large business blocks, and handsome churches, and paved streets, and a general city-like appearance which interested James greatly. On the whole, even if he had to give up going to sea, he thought he might enjoy himself in such a lively place as this. But of course he must find employment. So he went into a store and inquired if they wanted a boy. \"What can you do?\" asked the storekeeper, looking at the boy with his countrified air and rustic suit. \"I can read, write, and cipher,\" answered James. \"Indeed!\" said the storekeeper smiling. \"All our boys can do that. Is that all you can do?\" James might have answered that he could chop wood, work at carpentering, plant and harvest, but he knew very well that these accomplishments would be but little service to him here. Indeed, he was rather puzzled to know what he could do that would earn him a living in a smart town life Cleveland. However, he didn\u0027t much expect to find his first application successful, so he entered another store and preferred his request. \"You won\u0027t suit us,\" was the brusque reply. \"You come from the country, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You look like it. Well, I will give you a piece of advice.\" \"What is that, sir?\" \"Go back there. You are better suited to country than the city. I daresay you would make a very good hand on a farm. We need different sort of boys here.\" This was discouraging. James didn\u0027t know why he would not do for a city store or office. He was strong enough, and he thought he knew enough, for he had not at present much idea of what was taught at seminaries of a higher grade than the district schools he had been accustomed to attend. \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"I\u0027ve done what mother asked me to do. I\u0027ve tried to get a place here, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a place for me. After all, I don\u0027t know but I\u0027d better go to Ohio.\" Cleveland was not of course a sea-port, but it had considerable lake trade, and had a line of piers. James found his way to the wharves, and his eye lighted up as he saw the sloops and schooners which were engaged in inland trade. He had never seen a real ship, or those schooners and sloops would have had less attraction for him. In particular his attention was drawn to one schooner, not over-clean or attractive, but with a sea-faring look, as if it had been storm-tossed and buffeted. Half a dozen sailors were on board, but they were grimed and dirty, and looked like habitual drinkers—probably James would not have fancied becoming like one of these, but he gave little thought to their appearance. He only thought how delightful it would be to have such a floating home. \"Is the captain on board?\" the boy ventured to ask. \"He\u0027s down below,\" growled the sailor whom he addressed. \"Will he soon come up?\" He was answered in the affirmative. So James lingered until the man he inquired for came up. He was a brutal-looking man, as common in appearance as any of the sailors whom he commanded, and the boy was amazed at his bearing. Surely that man was not his ideal of a ship-captain. He thought of him as a sort of prince, but there was nothing princely about the miserable, bloated wretch before him. Still he preferred his application. \"Do you want a new hand?\" asked James. His answer was a volley of oaths and curses that made James turn pale, for he had never uttered an oath in his life, and had never listened to anything so disgusting as the tirade to which he was forced to listen. The Canal Boy The Canal Boy He sensibly concluded that nothing was to be gained by continuing the conversation with such a man. He left the schooner\u0027s deck with a feeling of discomfiture. He had never suspected that sailors talked or acted like the men he saw. Still he clung to the idea that all sailors were not like this captain. Perhaps again the rebuff he received was in consequence of his rustic appearance. The captain might be prejudiced against him, just as the shop-keepers had been, though the latter certainly had not expressed themselves in such rude and profane language. He might not be fit for a sailor yet, but he could prepare himself. He bethought himself of a cousin of his, by name Amos Letcher, who had not indeed arrived at the exalted position of captain of a schooner, but was content with the humbler position of captain of a canal-boat on the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal. This seemed to James a lucky thought. \"I will go to Amos Letcher,\" he said to himself. \"Perhaps he can find me a situation on a canal-boat, and that will be the next thing to being on board a ship.\" This thought put fresh courage into the boy, and he straightway inquired for the Evening Star, which was the name of the boat commanded by his cousin.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2970/81778.html","bookId":374,"book":{"id":374,"title":"From Canal Boy to President","description":"简介： The present series of volumes has been undertaken with the view of supplying the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined with a plain and concise mode of narration.
