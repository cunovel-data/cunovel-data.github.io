{"id":42399,"no":15,"title":"Chapter XIII—Ames Leaves Geauga Seminary","content":"While teaching his first school James \"boarded round\" among the families who sent pupils to his school. It was not so pleasant as having a permanent home, but it afforded him opportunities of reaching and influencing his scholars which otherwise he could not have enjoyed. With his cheerful temperament and genial manners, he could hardly fail to be an acquisition to any family with whom he found a home. He was ready enough to join in making the evenings pass pleasantly, and doubtless he had ways of giving instruction indirectly, and inspiring a love of learning similar to that which he himself possessed. He returned to school with a small sum of money in his pocket, which was of essential service to him in his economical way of living. But he brought also an experience in imparting knowledge to others which was still greater value. An eminent teacher has said that we never fully know anything till we have tried to impart it to others. James remained at the Geauga Seminary for three years. Every winter he taught school, and with success. In one of these winter sessions, we are told by Rev. William M. Thayer, in his biography of Garfield, that he was applied to by an ambitious student to instruct him in geometry. There was one difficulty in the way, and that a formidable one. He was entirely unacquainted with geometry himself. But, he reflected, here is an excellent opportunity for me to acquire a new branch of knowledge. Accordingly he procured a text-book, studied it faithfully at night, keeping sufficiently far ahead of his pupil to qualify him to be his guide and instructor, and the pupil never dreamed that his teacher, like himself, was traversing unfamiliar ground. It was early in his course at Geauga that he made the acquaintance of one who was to prove his closest and dearest friend—the young lady who in after years was to become his wife. Lucretia Rudolph was the daughter of a farmer in the neighborhood—\"a quiet, thoughtful girl, of singularly sweet and refined disposition, fond of study and reading, and possessing a warm heart, and a mind capable of steady growth.\" Probably James was first attracted to her by intellectual sympathy and a community of tastes; but as time passed he discerned in her something higher and better than mere intellectual aspiration; and who shall say in the light that has been thrown by recent events on the character of Lucretia Garfield, that he was not wholly right? Though we are anticipating the record, it may be in place to say here that the acquaintance formed here was renewed and ripened at Hiram College, to which in time both transferred themselves. There as pupil-teacher James Garfield became in one branch the instructor of his future wife, and it was while there that the two became engaged. It was a long engagement. James had to wait the traditional \"seven years\" for his wife, but the world knows how well he was repaid for his long waiting. \"Did you know Mrs. Garfield?\" asked a reporter of the Chicago Inter-Ocean of Mr. Philo Chamberlain, of Cleveland. \"Yes, indeed,\" was the reply. \"My wife knows her intimately. They used to teach school together in Cleveland. Mrs. Garfield is a splendid lady. She wasn\u0027t what you would call a brilliant teacher, but she was an unusually good one, very industrious, and the children made rapid progress in their studies under her. And then she was studious, too. Why, she acquired three languages while she was in school, both as a student and a teacher, and she spoke them well, I am told. They were married shortly after he came back from Williams, and I forgot to tell you a nice little thing about the time when he paid Dr. Robinson back the money he had spent on him. When Dr. Robinson refused to take the interest, which amounted to a snug little sum, Garfield said: \u0027Well, Doctor, that is one big point in my favor, as now I can get married.\u0027 It seems that they had been engaged for a long time, but had to wait till he could get something to marry on. And I tell you it isn\u0027t every young man that will let the payment of a self-imposed debt stand between him and getting married to the girl he loves.\" Without anticipating too far events we have not yet reached, it may be said that Lucretia Garfield\u0027s education and culture made her not the wife only, but the sympathetic friend and intellectual helper of her husband. Her early studies were of service to her in enabling her partially to prepare for college her two oldest boys. She assisted her husband also in his literary plans, without losing the domestic character of a good wife, and the refining graces of a true woman. But let us not forget that James is still a boy in his teens. He had many hardships to encounter, and many experiences to go through before he could set up a home of his own. He had studied three years, but his education had only begun. The Geauga Seminary was only an academy, and hardly the equal of the best academies to be found at the East. He began to feel that he had about exhausted its facilities, and to look higher. He had not far to look. During the year 1851 the Disciples, the religious body to which young Garfield had attached himself, opened a collegiate school at Hiram, in Portage County, which they called an eclectic school. Now it ranks as a college, but at the time James entered it, it had not assumed so ambitious a title. It was not far away, and James\u0027 attention was naturally drawn to it. There was an advantage also in its location. Hiram was a small country village, where the expenses of living were small, and, as we know, our young student\u0027s purse was but scantily filled. Nevertheless, so limited were his means that it was a perplexing problem how he would be able to pay his way. He consulted his mother, and, as was always the case, found that she sympathized fully in his purpose of obtaining a higher education. Pecuniary help, however, she could not give, nor had he at this time any rich friends upon whom he could call for the pittance he required. But James was not easily daunted. He had gone to Geauga Seminary with but seventeen dollars in his pocket; he had remained there three years, maintaining himself by work at his old trade of carpenter and teaching, and had graduated owing nothing. He had become self-reliant, and felt that what he had done at Chester he could do at Hiram. So one fine morning he set out, with a light heart and a pocket equally light, for the infant institution from which he hoped so much. The Board of Trustees were in session, as we learn from the account given by one of their number, when James arrived and sought an audience. After a little delay, the doorkeeper was instructed to bring him in. James was nineteen at this time. He was no longer as homespun in appearance as when he sat upon a log with Dr. Robinson, in the seclusion of the woods, and asked his advice about a career. Nevertheless, he was still awkward. He had grown rapidly, was of slender build, and had no advantages of dress to recommend him. One who saw him in after-life, with his noble, imposing presence, would hardly recognize any similarity between him and the raw country youth who stood awkwardly before the Board of Trustees, to plead his cause. It happens not unfrequently that a lanky youth develops into a fine-looking man. Charles Sumner, at the age of twenty, stood six feet two inches in his stockings, and weighed but one hundred and twenty pounds! Yet in after-life he was a man of noble presence. But all this while we are leaving James in suspense before the men whose decision is to affect his life so powerfully. \"Well, young man,\" asked the Principal, \"what can we do for you?\" \"Gentlemen,\" said James, earnestly, \"I want an education, and would like the privilege of making the fires and sweeping the floors of the building to pay part of my expenses.\" There was in his bearing and countenance an earnestness and an intelligence which impressed the members of the board. \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Frederic Williams, one of the trustees, \"I think we had better try this young man.\" Another member, turning to Garfield, said: \"How do we know, young man, that the work will be done as we may desire?\" \"Try me,\" was the answer; \"try me two weeks, and if it is not done to your entire satisfaction, I will retire without a word.\" \"That seems satisfactory,\" said the member who had asked the question. \"What studies do you wish to pursue?\" asked one gentleman. \"I want to prepare for college. I shall wish to study Latin, Greek, mathematics, and anything else that may be needed.\" \"Have you studied any of these already?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where?\" \"At the Geauga Seminary. I can refer you to the teachers there. I have studied under them for three years, and they know all about me.\" \"What is your name?\" \"James A. Garfield.\" \"There is something in that young man,\" said one of the trustees to Mr. Williams. \"He seems thoroughly in earnest, and I believe will be a hard worker.\" \"I agree with you,\" was the reply. James was informed that his petition was granted, and he at once made arrangements for his residence at Hiram. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2970/81788.html","bookId":374,"book":{"id":374,"title":"From Canal Boy to President","description":"简介： The present series of volumes has been undertaken with the view of supplying the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined with a plain and concise mode of narration.
