{"id":42398,"no":14,"title":"Chapter XII—Who Shall Be Master?","content":"With as much dignity as was possible under the circumstances, James stepped to the teacher\u0027s desk and rang the bell. This was hardly necessary, for out of curiosity all the scholars had promptly followed the young teacher into the school-room and taken their seats. After the introductory exercises, James made a brief address to the scholars: \"I don\u0027t need any introduction to you,\" he said, \"for you all know me. I see before me many who have been my playfellows and associates, but to-day a new relation is established between us. I am here as your teacher, regularly appointed by the committee, and it is my duty to assist you as far as I can to increase your knowledge. I should hardly feel competent to do so if I had not lately attended Geauga Seminary, and thus improved my own education. I hope you will consider me a friend, not only as I have been, but as one who is interested in promoting your best interests. One thing more,\" he added, \"it is not only my duty to teach you, but to maintain good order, and this I mean to do. In school I wish you to look upon me as your teacher, but outside I shall join you in your sports, and be as much a boy as any of you. We will now proceed to our daily lessons.\" This speech was delivered with self-possession, and favorably impressed all who heard it, even the boys who meant to make trouble, but they could not give up their contemplated fun. Nevertheless, by tacit agreement, they preserved perfect propriety for the present. They were not ready for the explosion. The boy teacher was encouraged by the unexpected quiet. \"After all,\" he thought, \"everything is likely to go smoothly. I need not have troubled myself so much.\" He knew the usual routine at the opening of a school term. The names of the children were to be taken, they were to be divided into classes, and lessons were to be assigned. Feeling more confidence in himself, James went about this work in business fashion, and when recess came, the comments made by the pupils in the playground were generally favorable. \"He\u0027s going to make a good teacher,\" said one of the girls, \"as good as any we\u0027ve had, and he\u0027s so young too.\" \"He goes to work as if he knew how,\" said another. \"I didn\u0027t think Jimmy Garfield had so much in him.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s smart!\" said another. \"Just think of brother Ben trying to keep school, and he\u0027s just as old as James.\" Meanwhile Tom Bassett and Bill Stackpole had a private conference together. \"What do you think of Jim\u0027s speech, Bill?\" asked Tom. \"Oh, it sounded well enough, but I\u0027ll bet he was trembling in his boots all the while he was talkin\u0027.\" \"Maybe so, but he seemed cool enough.\" \"Oh, that was all put on. Did you hear what he said about keepin\u0027 order?\" \"Yes, he kinder looked at you an\u0027 me when he was talkin\u0027.\" \"I guess he heard about our turnin\u0027 out the last teacher.\" \"Of course. I tell you, it took some cheek to come here and order \u0027round us boys that has known him all his life.\" \"That\u0027s so. Do you think he\u0027s goin\u0027 to maintain order, as he calls it?\" \"You just wait till afternoon. He\u0027ll know better then.\" James did not go out to recess the first day. He had some things to do affecting the organization of the school, and so he remained at his desk. Several of the pupils came up to consult him on one point or another, and he received them all with that pleasant manner which throughout his life was characteristic of him. To one and another he gave a hint or a suggestion, based upon his knowledge of their character and abilities. One of the boys said: \"Do you think I\u0027d better study grammar, Jimmy—I mean Mr. Garfield?\" James smiled. He knew the slip was unintentional. Of course it would not do for him to allow himself to be addressed in school by a pupil as Jimmy. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"unless you think you know all about it already.\" \"I don\u0027t know the first thing about it.\" \"Then, of course, you ought to study it. Why shouldn\u0027t you?\" \"But I can\u0027t make nothin\u0027 out of it. I can\u0027t understand it nohow.\" \"Then you need somebody to explain it to you.\" \"It\u0027s awful stupid.\" \"I don\u0027t think you will find it so when you come to know more about it. I shall be ready to explain it. I think I can make you understand it.\" Another had a sum he could not do. So James found the recess pass quickly away, and again the horde of scholars poured into the school-room. It was not till afternoon that the conflict came. Tom Bassett belonged to the first class in geography. James called out the class. All came out except Tom, who lounged carelessly in his seat. \"Thomas, don\u0027t you belong to this class?\" asked the young teacher. \"I reckon I do.\" \"Then why don\u0027t you come out to recite?\" \"Oh, I feel lazy,\" answered Tom, with a significant smile, as if to inquire, \"What are you goin\u0027 to do about it?\" James thought to himself with a thrill of unpleasant excitement, \"It\u0027s coming. In ten minutes I shall know whether Tom Bassett or I is to rule this school.\" His manner was calm, however, as he said, \"That is no excuse. I can\u0027t accept it. As your teacher I order you to join your class.\" \"Can\u0027t you wait till to-morrow?\" asked Tom, with a grin, which was reflected on the faces of several other pupils. \"I think I understand you,\" said James, with outward calmness. \"You defy my authority.\" \"You\u0027re only a boy like me,\" said Tom; \"I don\u0027t see why I should obey you.\" \"If you were teacher, and I pupil, I should obey you,\" said James, \"and I expect the same of you.\" \"Oh, go on with the recitation!\" said Tom, lazily. \"Never mind me!\" James felt that he could afford to wait no longer Turning to the class, he said, \"I shall have to delay you for a minute.\" He walked deliberately up to the seat where Tom Bassett was sitting. Tom squared off in the expectation of an assault; but, with the speed of lightning, the young teacher grasped him by the collar, and, with a strength that surprised himself, dragged him from his seat, in spite of his struggles, till he reached the place where the class was standing. By this time Bill Stackpole felt called upon to help his partner in rebellion. \"You let him alone!\" he said, menacingly, stepping forward. \"One at a time!\" said James, coolly. \"I will be ready for you in a minute.\" He saw that there was only one thing to do. He dragged Tom to the door, and forcibly ejected him, saying, \"When you get ready to obey me you can come back.\" He had scarcely turned when Bill Stackpole was upon him. With a quick motion of the foot James tripped him up, and, still retaining his grasp on his collar, said, \"Will you go or stay?\" Bill was less resolute than Tom. \"I guess I\u0027ll stay,\" he said; then picked himself up and resumed his place in the class. Apparently calm, James returned to his desk, and commenced hearing the class recite. The next morning, on his way to school, James overtook Tom Bassett, who eyed him with evident embarrassment. Tom\u0027s father had sent him back to school, and Tom did not dare disobey. \"Good morning, Tom,\" said James, pleasantly. \"Mornin\u0027!\" muttered Tom. \"I hope you are going to school?\" \"Father says I must.\" \"I am glad of that, too. By the way, Tom, I think I shall have to get some of the scholars to help me with some of the smaller pupils. I should like to get you to hear the lowest class in arithmetic to-day.\" \"You want me to help you teach?\" exclaimed Tom, in amazement. \"Yes; it will give me more time for the higher classes.\" \"And you don\u0027t bear no malice on account of yesterday?\" \"Oh, no; we are too good friends to mind such a trifle.\" \"Then,\" said Tom, impulsively, \"you won\u0027t have no more trouble with me. I\u0027ll help you all I can.\" There was general surprise felt when the young teacher and his rebellious scholar were seen approaching the school-house, evidently on the most friendly terms. There was still greater surprise when, during the forenoon, James requested Tom to hear the class already mentioned. At recess Tom proclaimed his intention to lick any boy that was impudent to the teacher, and the new Garfield administration seemed to be established on a firm basis. This incident, which is based upon an actual resort to war measures on the part of the young teacher, is given to illustrate the strength as well as the amiability of Garfield\u0027s character. It was absolutely necessary that he should show his ability to govern.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2970/81787.html","bookId":374,"book":{"id":374,"title":"From Canal Boy to President","description":"简介： The present series of volumes has been undertaken with the view of supplying the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined with a plain and concise mode of narration.
