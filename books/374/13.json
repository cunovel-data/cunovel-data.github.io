{"id":42397,"no":13,"title":"Chapter XI—Ledge Hill School","content":"Ever since he began to study at Geauga Seminary James had looked forward to earning a little money by keeping school himself; not an advanced school, of course, but an ordinary school, such as was kept in the country districts in the winter. He felt no hesitation as to his competence. The qualifications required by the school committees were by no means large, and so far there was no difficulty. There was one obstacle, however: James was still a boy himself—a large boy, to be sure, but he had a youthful face, and the chances were that he would have a number of pupils older than himself. Could he keep order? Would the rough country boys submit to the authority of one like themselves, whatever might be his reputation as a scholar? This was a point to consider anxiously. However, James had pluck, and he was ready to try the experiment. He would have been glad to secure a school so far away that he could go there as a stranger, and be received as a young man. But no such opportunity offered. There was another opening nearer home. A teacher was wanted for the Ledge Hill district in Orange, and the committee-man bethought himself of James Garfield. So one day he knocked at Mrs. Garfield\u0027s door. \"Is James at home?\" he asked. James heard the question, and came forward to meet his visitor. \"Good-morning,\" he said, pleasantly; \"did you want to see me?\" \"Are you calculating to keep school this winter\" asked his visitor. \"If I can get a school to keep,\" was the reply. \"That\u0027s the business I came about. We want a schoolmaster for the Ledge Hill School. How would you like to try it?\" \"The Ledge Hill School!\" repeated James, in some dismay. \"Why, all the boys know me there.\" \"Of course they do. Then they won\u0027t need to be introduced.\" \"Will they obey me? That\u0027s what I was thinking of. There are some pretty hard cases in that school.\" \"That\u0027s where you are right.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t like to try it and fail,\" said James, doubtfully. \"You won\u0027t if you\u0027ll follow my advice,\" said the committee-man. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Thrash the first boy that gives you any trouble. Don\u0027t half do it; but give him a sound flogging, so that he will understand who\u0027s master. You\u0027re strong enough; you can do it.\" James extended his muscular arm with a smile. He knew he was strong. He was a large boy, and his training had been such as to develop his muscles. \"You know the boys that will go to school. Is there any one that can master you?\" asked his visitor. \"No, I don\u0027t think there is,\" answered James, with a smile. \"Then you\u0027ll do. Let \u0027em know you are not afraid of them the first day. That\u0027s the best advice I can give you.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t like to get into a fight with a pupil,\" said James, slowly. \"You\u0027ll have to run the risk of it unless you teach a girls\u0027 school. I guess you wouldn\u0027t have any trouble there.\" \"Not of that kind, probably. What wages do you pay?\" \"Twelve dollars a month and board. Of course, you\u0027ll board round.\" Twelve dollars a month would not be considered very high wages now, but to James it was a consideration. He had earned as much in other ways, but he was quite anxious to try his luck as a teacher. That might be his future vocation, not teaching a district school, of course, but this would be the first round of the ladder that might lead to a college professorship. The first step is the most difficult, but it must be taken, and the Ledge Hill School, difficult as it probably would be, was to be the first step for the future President of Hiram College. All these considerations James rapidly revolved in his mind, and then he came to a decision. \"When does the school commence?\" he asked. \"Next Monday.\" \"I accept your offer. I\u0027ll be on hand in time.\" The news quickly reached the Ledge Hill district that \"Jim Garfield,\" as he was popularly called, was to be their next teacher. \"Have you heard about the new master?\" asked Tom Bassett, one of the hard cases, of a friend. \"No. Who is it?\" \"Jim Garfield.\" The other whistled. \"You don\u0027t mean it?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"How did you hear?\" \"Mr. ——,\" naming the committee-man, \"told me.\" \"Then it must be so. We\u0027ll have a high old time if that\u0027s so.\" \"So we will,\" chuckled the other. \"I\u0027m anxious for school to begin.\" \"He\u0027s only a boy like us.\" \"That\u0027s so.\" \"He knows enough for a teacher; but knowing isn\u0027t everything.\" \"You\u0027re right. We can\u0027t be expected to mind a boy like ourselves that we\u0027ve known all our lives.\" \"Of course not.\" \"I like Jim well enough. He\u0027s a tip-top feller; but, all the same, he aint goin\u0027 to boss me round.\" \"Nor me, either.\" This conversation between Tom Bassett and Bill Stackpole (for obvious reasons I use assumed names) augured ill for the success of the young teacher. They determined to make it hot for him, and have all the fun they wanted. They thought they knew James Garfield, but they made a mistake. They knew that he was of a peaceable disposition and not fond of quarreling, and although they also knew that he was strong and athletic, they decided that he would not long be able to maintain his position. If they had been able to read the doubts and fears that agitated the mind of their future preceptor, they would have felt confirmed in their belief. The fact was, James shrank from the ordeal that awaited him. \"If I were only going among strangers,\" he said to his mother, \"I wouldn\u0027t mind it so much; but all these boys and girls have known me ever since I was a small boy and went barefoot.\" \"Does your heart fail you, my son?\" asked his mother, who sympathized with him, yet saw that it was a trial which must come. \"I can\u0027t exactly say that, but I dread to begin.\" \"We must expect to encounter difficulties and perplexities, James. None of our lives run all smoothly. Shall we conquer them or let them conquer us?\" The boy\u0027s spirit was aroused. \"Say no more, mother,\" he replied. \"I will undertake the school, and if success is any way possible, I will succeed. I have been shrinking from it, but I won\u0027t shrink any longer.\" \"That is the spirit that succeeds, James.\" James laughed, and in answer quoted Campbell\u0027s stirring lines with proper emphasis: \"I will victor exult, or in death be laid low, With my face to the field and my feet to the foe.\" So the time passed till the eventful day dawned on which James was to assume charge of his first school. He was examined, and adjudged to be qualified to teach; but that he anticipated in advance. The building is still standing in which James taught his first school. It is used for quite another purpose now, being occupied as a carriage-house by the thrifty farmer who owns the ground upon which it stands. The place where the teacher\u0027s desk stood, behind which the boy stood as preceptor, is now occupied by two stalls for carriage-horses. The benches which once contained the children he taught have been removed to make room for the family carriage, and the play-ground is now a barnyard. The building sits upon a commanding eminence known as Ledge Hill, and overlooks a long valley winding between two lines of hills. This description is furnished by the same correspondent of the Boston Herald to whom I am already indebted for Henry Boynton\u0027s reminiscences contained in the last chapter. When James came in sight, and slowly ascended the hill in sight of the motley crew of boys and girls who were assembled in front of the school-house on the first morning of the term, it was one of the most trying moments of his life. He knew instinctively that the boys were anticipating the fun in store for them in the inevitable conflict which awaited him, and he felt constrained and nervous. He managed, however, to pass through the crowd, wearing a pleasant smile and greeting his scholars with a bow. There was trouble coming, he was convinced, but he did not choose to betray any apprehension. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2970/81786.html","bookId":374,"book":{"id":374,"title":"From Canal Boy to President","description":"简介： The present series of volumes has been undertaken with the view of supplying the want of a class of books for children, of a vigorous, manly tone, combined with a plain and concise mode of narration.
