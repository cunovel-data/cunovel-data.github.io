The body was starting to rock and shiver as it fought against the sheet like a butterfly too weak to battle its way out of its cocoon. I have to help, I have to do something!\\n\\n But wait, did she? It . . . he was alive or coming back to life . . . and that was nuts. She’d never seen any of the Mummy movies, but isn’t this how bad things went down? Stupid person stumbles into a cave or tomb or something, and finds a stone coffin and thinks, Whoa, I think we’ll just open this puppy and see what’s what.\\n\\n “And then the stupid person gets killed,” she whispered. Or the mummy ate his tongue and ripped out his eyes or something. For a split second, she thought, Run, run fast, just go! Leave and roll the slider back into place and shut up the death house and stick her fingers in her ears—la-la-la-la, I can’t hear you—and pretend she hadn’t seen a darned thing. No one would ever know. Of course, when they came back at the spring thaw to bury the bodies, they’d notice that the burlap was all torn up. They’d see the blood. But she didn’t have to fess up. Because here was the thing: how did she know that this wasn’t what happened to some kids when they became people-eaters? Not everyone was done turning, or turned in the same way. So what if ? What if the second she ripped open that sheet, that person—who might not be a person anymore—grabbed her and . . .\\n\\n By her side, Mina pawed at her shoulder and let out an anxious whimper.\\n\\n Listen to Mina, the little voice from deep in the closet of her mind said. She would know if this is trouble. Come on, you’ve got to do something, Ellie, and you’ve got to do it quick, or he’ll die.\\n\\n “But he’s already dead,” she said, only meekly, the way you offered an answer in class you weren’t quite sure of. Unless he really isn’t. It could’ve been a mistake. Hannah doesn’t know everything. And that calmed her down, enough to stop her thoughts from skittering out of control like boots on slick ice. Mina knows it’s okay. She wants me to help. Mina always knows.\\n\\n The heck with it. Swallowing back her heart, she patted her hands over the dome of his head. Of all the places she could cut, this was probably the best way not to hurt him. Not hurt him? She tented up a handful of sheet, stabbed with her knife, worked a horizontal slit. He’s dead, or he was dead . . .\\n\\n She could hear him now: a low, muffled groaning that went on and\\n\\n mo ns ters on. Through the slit she’d made, Ellie could see black hair and now the broad plain of his forehead. Slipping in her fingers, she jerked the cotton sheet hard, grunting as the fabric first resisted then gave. His face appeared. His skin was very white, almost like a grub’s. Bluishgray smudges brushed the hollow beneath his eyes, which were still closed. His lips were dusky blue, like dead worms after a bad rain. His mouth was open, and he was gasping, his chest heaving against the sheet, the wiry cords standing in his neck.\\n\\n “Chris! Chris!” She was crying again, ripping the sheet apart and crying, screaming his name. He was naked—as in no clothes at all, a fact her mind only dimly registered, like the flicker of something you passed on the road in a really fast car. His chest strained to suck in air. She could see the way the skin actually bowed between his ribs.\\n\\n But what really riveted her to the spot, made her actually start back with a little shriek, was the blood: scarlet roses unfurling where Hannah had placed the wound wood after blessing it.\\n\\n That can’t work. She saw that the wounds weren’t raw or ragged anymore either but dimpled with half-formed scar tissue. It’s just a charm, it’s only wood.\\n\\n Chris was shuddering, all over, as if he’d stuck his finger into an electrical socket. She battled the sheet away from his hips and then his jittering legs. Chris had many injuries: nicks and smaller rips, a gash on each palm, punctures in his thighs. The killing blow, the real monster rip that sealed the deal, drove straight down, a through-andthrough that had shredded first his diaphragm, which Hannah said helped you breathe, and then his liver, which was nothing more than a big bloody sac, easily torn by a broken rib. Or, in Chris’s case, obliterated by the weight of the door and that iron spike. No way to stop the bleeding either, not from something this bad. Chris had lasted as long as he had only because he was young and strong.\\n\\n But now there’s blood . That terrible wound glistened like the red eye of a loon in high summer—and yet there was also a rim of very pink flesh, like the new skin of a baby. It’s all just voodoo; there’s no such thing as magic, there’s no such thing.\\n\\n “Chris!” Ellie grabbed his face and realized with a shock that as he got more air, his skin was growing even warmer, his cheeks going hectic with fresh color. “Chris, can you hear me? Are you—”\\n\\n All at once, his eyes flew open. At the same instant, Chris’s hands shot out, fanning a thin spray of new blood, and hooked her shoulders. It happened so fast her shriek was only halfway to her mouth when he spoke.\\n\\n “Help.” The word rode on a ferocious gasp. Chris’s eyes, the centers black and huge, bored into hers—and for Ellie, it was like staring into the mouth of nothing and everything at once.\\n\\n “P-please,” he gasped again. “H-help me.”\\n\\n 28\\n\\n Tom might have been a couple cans shy of a six-pack right about then, but he knew the gun wasn’t hers. No cross-trigger safety, for one thing, and Alex’s had been a Glock 22, standard police issue with a fifteen-round mag. Besides, Alex had been a prisoner. No way the Chuckies would let her keep her father’s weapon.\\n\\n This gun was smaller, a Glock 19, but with an extended magazine. He eyeballed it as nineteen rounds altogether. Yet he had no way of checking for sure, or even jacking back the slide to shuck a chambered round. A thin scrim of ice coated the weapon, like the petrified sugar glaze over a stale doughnut.\\n\\n It got wet. His own battered hands were stiff with cold, and he was starting to shiver all over. Wincing, he clamped his right hand under his left arm to warm it as he lurched back to the dead Chucky. Bracing his butt against boulders, he shrugged back into his parka, but his torn hands were shaking so badly he couldn’t work the zipper and finally gave up. Had to warm his hands first. Fumbling up his gloves, he studied the rise directly east. No question about it: that Glock was in the fall line, either carried here all by itself or stripped from its owner as the avalanche roared downslope. So . . . this Glock had belonged to a Chucky? That stood to reason. There had been seven plowing up the rise, and he’d already found one. The Chuckies had only just breached the hillside when Luke and Weller forced him to leave. So, prepared or not, unless you were a real monkey or a trained Army Ranger like Weller and knew your way around ropes and rocks, reaching Alex would have taken precious time the Chuckies might not have had to spare. So wasn’t it much more likely that none had survived, and other dead waited, entombed under his feet? Of course. He’d found a ski pole. That dead kid had an Eagle and now here was a Glock. Probably rifles under the snow and skis and all sorts of goodies. Only time and the spring melt would tell, unless he came back with a shovel and excavated the entire flat. A futile effort. He knew that. Didn’t mean he wouldn’t do it, but . . .\\n\\n The ice. He slid a thumb over the Glock’s grip, felt the smooth glide of his glove. Spied a tiny frozen teardrop hanging from the trigger’s tip. The ice is wrong.\\n\\n Squatting over the Chucky, he laboriously worked the Eagle from its hip holster. To his utter lack of surprise, the massive gun was locked up tight; he couldn’t budge even the safety. “But there’s no ice on it,” he muttered, hefting the Eagle, a heavy sucker, in his left hand. So the gun probably hadn’t gotten sopping wet. “What the hell does that mean?”\\n\\n Before the avalanche, the water had been belowground, in the mine, and rising. There was plenty of ice now, not only a skin of it over the new lake itself but also frozen into beards over the rocks along the shore. But the only ice down here was a brittle surface crust, and what you’d expect from snow exposed to sun and wind.\\n\\n Laying the Eagle on the dead boy’s stomach but still clutching the Glock, he pushed up on his thighs. No ice on the Eagle meant no water, nothing to explain how the Glock got wet. Unless Alex got her hands on a weapon. The thought was a golden blaze, and crazy, too, just another loony-tunes item in a long afternoon of insanity, but he couldn’t help it. That would explain it, because that would mean . . .\\n\\n “Oh Jesus.” He felt a knot loosening in his chest. His eyes sprang hot. Hold it together. Don’t get ahead of yourself. But it might have been hers, right? Alex had been in that tunnel, working her way to the surface. If anyone could’ve found a way to get a weapon, it would be Alex, and what if, what if . . .\\n\\n “Alex.” Closing his eyes, he folded his hands, pressing the weapon to the hard thrum of his heart. “Alex, oh God, did you make it? Did you get out?” Or did they take you? Is that how you lost the gun? He hated that thought because then, more likely than not, she really was here, now, beneath the snow, waiting for him to find her.\\n\\n The only answers he got were virtually none at all: only that wind, laced with decay, sighing down from the lake.\\n\\n And then, a minute grate of stone at his back. Just a tick, to his left. Say . . . eight o’clock. A tiny tock as rock butted rock, a sound that did not belong but that he heard even past the pulse and pound of his rampaging blood because, after all this time, he was still a soldier. So he knew.\\n\\n Something was storming over the snow, and coming fast.\\n\\n 29\\n\\n She had to get him out of here, and fast. But how? Thrusting her bare hands under her armpits, Ellie winced against the sting. Now that her initial burst of shock had dribbled away, She was starting to feel the cold. Shucking out of her coat, she’d draped that over his chest, then stripped burlap from all the other bodies and piled the shrouds over Chris to keep him as warm as she could. On the pallet and under his burlap blankets, Chris was quiet now, eyes closed again, but he was panting, his breath chuffing in wavering gray clouds.\\n\\n There were really only two things she could do: leave Chris and ride for help, or take him back herself. The first was easiest. Leave Mina to guard him, race back to Bella, and gallop all the way to the farmhouse. Maybe an hour, and maybe a lot less if she got poky old Bella to really book. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monsters-ashes-trilogy-3/page-19.html","bookId":2566,"book":{"id":2566,"title":"Monsters (Ashes Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: Monsters (Ashes Trilogy #3) \\n The Changed are on the move.
