The mailman is standing by the desk with a large envelope, alone. \"Can I help you?\" I ask. He nods, \"Thank God. Where is everyone?\" Shaking his head, he thrusts the parcel at me and hands me a pen. \"I was about to leave, but this needs a signature.\" \"Thanks for waiting for me. I know you didn\u0027t have to and I really appreciate it.\" I smile at him and his gruff curtness seems to melt despite my appearance. I\u0027m sure I look like I\u0027m crazy - windblown hair frizzed out along with a cherry glow across the bridge of my nose - but he doesn\u0027t seem to notice. It must be part of having a mail route in the Hamptons. He nods once and says, \"Sure thing. Have a good day.\" He leaves me standing alone in the lobby with a fat envelope. I\u0027ve been wondering why there only seems to be three people working here. I\u0027ve been assuming that I just keep missing the others, especially since Cole said the NYC crew was sent out here, but aside from the first few days, they seem to have disappeared. I glance down at the letter in my hands. It is from J. H. Hashre, esq., and stamped TIME SENSITIVE MATERIALS ENCLOSED with an \"open by\" date of today. What is this? Looking at the envelope, I think about opening it, but it is addressed to Cole, not the studio. As I walk through the building, I flip on lights looking for him. Regina isn\u0027t around. She must have finished her work and went to dinner. I stop in the shooting room and look around. Memories of earlier in the day flood my mind. His hands on me, his lips. I want more of that - more of him. \"Miss Lamore,\" Cole\u0027s deep voice echoes through the space. He stands across the way on the other side of the shooting room in an adjoining hallway. \"This came for you. It looks important. Thought you\u0027d want it.\" I cross the room and place it in his hand. When he looks down at it, he stiffens. \"Thank you.\" He turns to leave, but I grab his arm. Cole stops and looks down at my hand on his skin. \"Tell me,\" I demand, my voice firm. I fold my arms over my chest and look at the side of his face. \"Tell me how you could do those things, say those things, and then walk away like it meant nothing?\" His eyes meet mine, \"Because we don\u0027t belong together, Miss Lamore. Because it would be a horrible mistake to do more, to say more, than I already foolishly said. There\u0027s no future here,\" he gestures between us, \"nothing to pursue. I apologize for not controlling my tongue. There\u0027s no excuse for it.\" Each word feels like a barb in my heart. \"I see.\" My voice quivers slightly. I don\u0027t understand. How is it a mistake? I have no idea, but from the look in Cole\u0027s eyes I can tell there is no way to convince him otherwise. I lower my head and look at the floor, at his bare feet. Cole seems like he can\u0027t wait to get away from me. He shifts his weight from foot to foot, looking anywhere - everywhere - but at me. Finally, I say, \"Maybe I should work somewhere else?\" That catches his attention. His brow pinches together, \"Did Sottero talk to you?\" \"No, Cole. She didn\u0027t. I just thought that maybe it would be too awkward to stay here, that I should - \" He shakes his head, \"Anna, I won\u0027t be here much longer. It\u0027s only a few more weeks.\" He taps the envelope against his thigh and I glance down at it. \"I promise that it won\u0027t happen again. Regina can show you a lot of what you need to know, and as for your skills - I think you\u0027ll be perfect for this position. I really hope you\u0027ll stay.\" As he speaks his voice softens. \"Cole, I don\u0027t understand why you want me to work here. There are more qualified people, honestly. And the staff...\" He looks up at me confused, \"What about the staff?\" \"Where are they? I thought you had more people. When we were in the city, you said they were out here, but now that we\u0027re out here, there\u0027s just Regina.\" His gaze falls to the floor and he breathes in deeply. Shaking his head he says, \"There are some things going on, some things that require me to make changes. I made them. And I only kept the best.\" \"Cole,\" I whisper his name and see him respond to my voice. I want to touch him, to push his hair back and open that letter than hangs in his hand like a lump of lead. That has something to do with this, I can sense it. But, before I can say anything else, he turns away. \"There\u0027s a shoot in the morning,\" he says. \"Better get some rest.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-15.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
