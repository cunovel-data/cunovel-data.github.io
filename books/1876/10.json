The other two people staying here are already asleep. Before Cole leaves me to find my room, he says, \"That shoot will be first thing tomorrow. If you have body jewelry, wear it.\" He doesn\u0027t look at me as he speaks. Instead, he walks over to the front desk and picks up a pile of mail, and sifts through it. My heart hammers. I nod and silently walk off to my room with my heart in my throat. Sleep finally comes, but my dreams make me restless. I dream about Cole as a young man. I see the haunted expression in his eyes - the fact that he knows there is no such thing as forgiveness. He learned that lesson too well. There is no way he will ever forget. The dream fades to Edward. His eyes are a void of black. Bleeding twin trails of ink spill down his pale cheeks. He says, \"You destroyed me.\" He reaches for my throat, his fingers moving toward my eye with a black nail in his fist. I know that will make my eyes bleed black like his, that my heart will never heal. I know I\u0027m dreaming, but I scream anyway. I wake, frightened, and trembling. The sun is barely over the horizon. I swing my legs over the side of my bed and rub my eyes. I breathe deeply trying to push away the nightmare. There\u0027s a knock on my door. \"Come in,\" I say. When I look up, Cole is standing in the doorway. I\u0027m wearing cotton shorts and a thin cami. They\u0027re dorm pajamas, which means they\u0027re guy safe. At least that\u0027s what Emma and I used to say. Stubble lines his cheeks. A white tee shirt clings to his torso. Dark jeans hug his narrow hips, and he\u0027s barefoot. Cole seems to have something against shoes. His eyes are red like he hasn\u0027t slept. \"You all right? I heard you scream.\" \"Yeah. Fine.\" I don\u0027t elaborate. I look up at him and push the rat\u0027s nest that is my hair out of my face. \"What time are we shooting? Tell me it\u0027s not in fifteen minutes.\" I\u0027m only half joking. Cole\u0027s a morning person. Apparently that\u0027s still true even though he\u0027s only had a few hours of sleep. He smiles, \"No, not in fifteen.\" He looks at his watch and back up at me. \"Why don\u0027t we try for nine? You can get a few more hours rest.\" I laugh and push off the bed, shaking my head. \"It\u0027ll take me that long to get ready. And I have to tell you that I didn\u0027t bring anything with me that might be even a little suitable for this shoot. Do you have props or something I could look at?\" \"No nudes, Miss Lamore?\" he asks leaning against the door frame, and folds his arms over his chest. A dark brow rises on his face. His eyes lock on mine. My stomach flutters. A soft smile lines my lips and I shake my head, \"I thought I should see what my options are. I hear lace photographs well,\" I tease, knowing it will annoy him. Anything about wedding photography seems to get under his skin. \"Damn wedding photographers and their lace,\" he laughs softly. The sound is stunning. I wish he were like this all the time, but it\u0027s the Cole that vanishes like smoke. I think that\u0027s the real Cole, the one he hides from everyone at all cost. He pushes off the door frame, and shakes his head, \"Come on. I\u0027ll show you where the wardrobe is located. Use whatever you want. They literally finished the sets last night and installed the lights. We\u0027ll christen the new studio and then get back to work.\" An hour later Cole is gone and I\u0027m still looking through boxes. I find some jeweled dangling earrings that I can use. They have a hook, but I grab some wire and wire cutters. I plan on modifying their intended use, slightly, if I have to. Other than that, I don\u0027t see anything else. Regina walks in and flips on the lights, \"Hey boss. Can I help you find something?\" Quickly, I decide to tell her what we\u0027re doing. It makes it seem less risque, even though telling her about the shoot makes me blush. Regina is very professional. She doesn\u0027t react. Instead she helps. She digs through a few boxes, showing me more necklaces and outfits from Le Femme. She hands me a panty and I press the thin lace between my fingers, \"This is beautiful, but I wanted something different.\" \"How different?\" she asks. I shrug at her and put the panties back. I laugh nervously and look at her. \"I have no idea what I\u0027m looking for. Or what I want. I just need it to be sultry, cover me a little bit, and be something that screams, Anna.\" I shake my head. \"None of this stuff seems to do all that.\" Regina nods, listening. Grinning at me, she says, \"I have something.\" She looks over her shoulder like she\u0027s doing something that she shouldn\u0027t and reaches for a box on the top shelf. I look inside when she pulls it down. It\u0027s filled with tiny crystals. Many are clear, like tiny diamonds, but some are vibrant colors. She pulls a paper from the plastic sleeve on the top of the box. \"I got these thinking we could use them - to do this.\" \"What is it?\" I ask and unfold the paper. My cheeks flush when I see it, but I can\u0027t look away. My jaw drops. \"Vajazzling. At least that\u0027s what the article calls it.\" She shrugs. \"I guess you can do anything from pouring the crystals over your body, to applying them in a pattern.\" She points at the paper to a woman bared from the waist down. The patch of hair between her legs is gone and in its place there is an intricate design of a butterfly. The sparkles disappear between her legs. \"That one is really pretty,\" she says pointing to the butterfly. \"Of course, that only works if you already have a Brazilian.\" I scan the paper, reading it. A smile creeps slowly across my face. As a matter of fact, I do. \"This is perfect. Thanks Regina.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-10.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
