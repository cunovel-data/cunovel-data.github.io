{"id":83048,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"During the shoot my brain is all over the place. I can\u0027t focus. The little dog yips every time I go to fix the pose. Posing dogs is like trying to teach a Frisbee to walk. \"Regina, please reset the dog,\" I say, pressing my temples with my fingers. For a split second I imagine myself fanning a brides train and the happy couple smiling back at me. Then I look down at Mitsy who thinks biting constitutes talking. She nips at Regina as she repositions the dog by her master\u0027s hand. The pose is perfect. I chose the white set and have the client laying face-down on satin sheets. She\u0027s propped up on one elbow slightly. The pose shows off her curves without being too revealing. It\u0027s the kind of pose that looks seductive. It works perfectly for her. Everything is white on white, with layered textures. Linens, lace, throws and silk pillows are strewn through the set. It\u0027s completely perfect. Even the little dog helps pull the shot together. His snow white fur adds just the right about softness, but the little beast won\u0027t sit still. Regina picks up Mitsy. The little dog bares her tiny teeth and is very unhappy to be placed back on the bed. Regina runs off the set and I shoot. Working fast is new to me. Normally, I take all the time I need. When I think I have the shot, we move on. The final piece is going to be a high key black and white. Everything is pale from the client\u0027s skin to the dog\u0027s fur. She wears nothing but a white thong. Her implants make her look like she is twenty, even though those years of her life are at least a decade behind her. She holds the dog in her arms, its fur concealing helping conceal her breasts. The dog is happy in her arms and the owner looks straight back into the camera, staring at the lens. The finished product will be striking. Later that night, Cole arrives and thumbs through the unprocessed shots with me. When he gets to the end of the shoot he stops and looks at the poses with the dog in her arms more carefully. He leans in close to the screen with me sitting in front of the computer. He taps a pen to his lips, \"Open it.\" I double click the image and it opens in an editing program. \"Show me what you plan to do.\" My hand moves on the tablet, clicking settings and altering the image to black and white. I adjust a few settings, run a few of Cole\u0027s actions to smooth her skin, and then pump up the contrast. \"What do you think? The dog threw me for a loop. I didn\u0027t know what to do with it, and the stupid thing wouldn\u0027t sit still.\" He leans over my shoulder, his gaze on the screen. He puts a hand on my shoulder. It feels warm and strong. His scent fills my head and I think back to last night, to laying in his bed and sleeping right next to him. \"I think this is amazing. I mean, people ask us to do and shoot all sorts of things, but this - damn Anna...\" he strokes his chin, staring at the screen. \"You even made the dog look sexy.\" He laughs and looks down at me. I beam, \"Thanks, Cole. That means a lot to me.\" The weight of his hand suddenly feels like something more. My skin tingles and I want him to touch me, to stroke my face with his hand. Cole watches me with that expression that I can\u0027t read. He pats my shoulder before stepping away, \"No problem. I knew you had a talent for this before I even met you. Some people just have it. You\u0027re one of them. You\u0027re lucky, Lamore.\" \"Yeah, well, not so much. Actually, me and luck are strangers. Maybe even enemies,\" I joke. I put things away for the night and shut down the editing program, the screen glows dimly before its light goes out as the computer powers down. I reach for the scattered pens and papers on my desk, and shove them into a drawer. \"If I saw Luck on the subway, she\u0027d probably mug me. Nothing lucky has ever happened to me.\" Cole has that smirk on his face as he listens. He slides his hands into his pockets and tilts his head, \"Oh, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d say that. Luck\u0027s the kind of thing most people notice in hindsight. It\u0027s hard to see it in the moment.\" I stop what I\u0027m doing and turn to look at him. He\u0027s oozing with boyish charm. Everything from the way he stands to the curve of his mouth makes my heart race. I shake my head, trying to evade his charms. Why am I tormenting myself by hanging around him? \"And at this moment, am I lucky? Is there something happening that I can\u0027t see?\" I pull a folder to my chest and wait for him to answer. \"Maybe,\" he says, voice soft and sensual. My eyebrow lifts. I stand there for a moment at a loss for what to say. I hug the folder tighter. His eyes drift toward my hands before he turns away, nodding his head toward the door. \"Come on, Lamore. Dinner. Now.\" I place the folder down and follow him out. As my hand flips off the lights, I wonder when I became so obedient and discover that I don\u0027t care. If it means being around Cole, and seeing him happy, I\u0027ll jump when he snaps his fingers. At least a little. It goes against every fiber of my being to let someone else be in charge, but with Cole, it feels comfortable.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-19.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
