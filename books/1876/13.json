She listens and doesn\u0027t say anything for a long time. When she finally speaks, she seems confused, \"Edward seems to think you guys are still together.\" I slam my head back onto the seat and look up at the ceiling. \"No, Em. We broke up a while ago. He took it really hard.\" Silence fills the air as the little car bobs and weaves through traffic. After a few moments I ask, \"I guess he\u0027s not doing too well?\" She shakes her head, \"Apparently not. He said you needed space, but that you guys were fine. He\u0027s always been a bit of an idealist, but this is a little weird - even for him.\" She tilts her head to the side as she changes lanes, saying, \"Then again, it\u0027s not like I\u0027m usually friends with his girlfriends. You know how people can act one way with one person and totally different around another. It seems like my brother\u0027s got a little of that going on. \"But he\u0027s not what\u0027s bothering you. Why are you so bent out of shape? I mean, did anything happen with Cole before now?\" I shake my head, staring out the window. \"Not really. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s bothering me so much. It\u0027s not like Cole promised me anything. I just hoped that - \" I swallow my words. I don\u0027t know what happened, but I intend to find out. Things can\u0027t stay like this between us. I don\u0027t want to push Cole, and I don\u0027t want to take something he isn\u0027t willing to give. I just wish I knew why. There\u0027s something between us, something preventing him from acting on his feelings. I feel it stuck there like a chasm that will swallow us whole. Silence fills the car. Emma finally says, \"You really like him, don\u0027t you?\" I nod. She laughs, \"When you first met him, I thought you hated his guts. You did a 180 pretty fast, Anna. Even for you.\" \"Even for me? What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Nothing bad,\" Emma says. \"Don\u0027t take it like that. There are two types of people that flip that fast. The first group is the flakes, the people who don\u0027t know what the hell they want. That\u0027s not you. You\u0027re in the second group - the people who know exactly what they want, but they can\u0027t find it.\" \"The thing is, I think I have found it. Cole isn\u0027t like anyone I\u0027ve ever known.\" He\u0027s passionate, driven, powerful. \"He\u0027s kind of old for you, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Thanks for stating the obvious, Em.\" I snap. \"Sorry,\" I say pushing my hair out of my face. I look over at her. \"Do you think that\u0027s why he\u0027s acting the way he is? Because I\u0027m too young?\" \"Anna, if I ever have a clue why a guy does anything I\u0027ll die of shock.\" She darts between cars as we drive toward the city. She glances at me before jerking the wheel back, \"One thing is certain - he thinks you\u0027re hot and is too chicken to act on it. You can either forget the whole thing happened or corner him and get your answer.\" That sounded like a bad idea. Cornering Cole. I shiver thinking about it. We drive in silence when it finally dawns on me that Emma drove two hours to see me and didn\u0027t call first. I glance at her, just noticing that she seems happy, but is trying to hide it. A lopsided smile spreads across my lips, \"You\u0027re awesome, you know that?\" She laughs, \"Yup! But what\u0027d I do?\" \"Something major had to happen for you to come all the way out, without a phone call...\" I smile at her, waiting for her to tell me. When she grins, I know I\u0027m right. \"I got a job! It\u0027s mine, Anna.\" \"That\u0027s great! Is it the one you wanted, over at the paper?\" Emma\u0027s giddy now. She nods, \"Yup! All I have to do is finish the internship, graduate, and it\u0027s onto the lowest branch of the newspaper totem pole.\" She squeals and I can\u0027t help but feel excited for her. \"It\u0027s perfect, Anna. And oh my God! You should have seen me at the interview. I nailed it! Like, totally nailed it! I\u0027ll be working alongside Stacy James - \" \"No way,\" I say leaning forward. Nodding enthusiastically, she slaps her hands on the steering wheel and squeals, \"I know, right? He\u0027ll oversee the internship and I\u0027ll start getting my own stories in a few months. It\u0027s totally perfect!\" \"I\u0027m so happy for you, Em. I know how much you wanted this. You\u0027re gonna rock it. Just imagine, your own newspaper article with a little square picture of your head. It\u0027ll be retweeted worldwide and you\u0027ll become an overnight sensation.\" She snorts, \"That\u0027s why I was coming to get you! I knew you\u0027d be the perfect person to celebrate with!\" She glances at me, \"I have a beach bag filled with towels, bikinis, and trashy romance books. My original plan was to lounge on your beach, but I think some time away from Cole will help your brain work better. We need a Cole-free zone. Why don\u0027t we detour to Jones Beach and hang out for a while? You can relax and I can celebrate.\" Leaning my head back against the seat, I say, \"That sounds completely perfect.\" Emma cuts across six lanes of traffic and I think I\u0027m going to die. We make it onto the exit ramp for the beach and we both start laughing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-13.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
