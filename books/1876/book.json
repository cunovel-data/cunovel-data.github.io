{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
