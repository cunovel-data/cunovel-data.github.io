I\u0027m sitting in my new room, on my bed, with my head against the wall. It\u0027s a little guest room off the main hall.\\n\\n A girl wraps her knuckles on my door and pushes it open. \"Hello?\" she says. A massive amount of red hair peers around the door with a strikingly pretty pale face at the center. Impossibly green eyes blink at me. \"Are you Anna?\"\\n\\n I nod and scoot the edge of my bed. \"Yes. Can I help you?\"\\n\\n She walks into the room. \"I\u0027m Regina Davenport. I\u0027m Mr. Stevens\u0027 assistant. I heard you\u0027re the new intern, well, the only intern.\"\\n\\n Confused, I ask, \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n She laughs, \"I\u0027m sorry. I thought it was common knowledge. Every year Le Femme takes in one intern, and every year that intern quits before it\u0027s over. Sottero usually scoops them up and it pisses Mr. Stevens off to no end. We\u0027ve never seen him on speaking terms with someone interning after this long.\"\\n\\n My mouth is hanging open, \"It\u0027s only been a week.\"\\n\\n Her eyebrows lift, \"Yeah, like I said, a long time in internland.\" She hesitates and then asks shyly, \"Is it true? Do you really get to run this if you finish the internship? I mean, it seems like a sweet deal, assuming you can tolerate Stevens...\"\\n\\n I nod slowly. \"He chases off the other interns? How?\"\\n\\n Regina looks back toward the door like she shouldn\u0027t be talking, but she\u0027s the only person I\u0027ve seen today that is within a few years of me. I know we\u0027ll be working together if I stay here and so does she. She grins, \"He\u0027s just difficult to get along with. He\u0027s got his own ideas about things and if yours don\u0027t line up, well, there\u0027s no future for you here. But he offered you this, so he must respect you an awful lot.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what to say, so I nod. She says, \"He\u0027s looking for you. He said something about some artwork to show you. I told him I\u0027d check, that I thought you were sleeping. What would you like me to tell him?\"\\n\\n She\u0027s protecting me from him. I don\u0027t really understand why. I don\u0027t even know her. A thought occurs to me and I blurt out, \"You\u0027re trying to make sure that I don\u0027t burn out?\"\\n\\n She smiles like she\u0027s guilty and nods. \"A girl\u0027s gotta make a living, Miss Lamore. And it\u0027s so much prettier out here than in Manhattan. No commuting. Can you imagine?\"\\n\\n I finally understand, \"You\u0027d be the assistant who stays out here, with me?\"\\n\\n She nods, smiling, hope flowing from her eyes. \"That\u0027s the plan, Ma\u0027am. So, what should I say?\"\\n\\n \"Tell him I\u0027ll be right there. And Regina...\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me, Ma\u0027am. I\u0027m younger than you. And if you talk to me like I\u0027m an old person, I\u0027ll truly lose my mind.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-6.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
