{"id":83038,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"We stay in his apartment for the night. I sleep rather restlessly in his guest room. The place smells like Cole. I can\u0027t stop thinking about him, but I finally pass out not wanting to consider what I offered earlier in the evening. He lets me sleep late and I emerge from the shower around noon. We go into the Manhattan office and work until sunset, editing the remaining images from last week\u0027s shoot. Neither of us says much. When we leave, he holds the door to his Porsche open and I slide in. I feel his eyes on the side of my face as we drive back to the new studio. Cole is silent. His fingers are wrapped around the steering wheel tightly. It\u0027s like nothing happened last night, like he didn\u0027t agree to do something completely sexy with me. I lean my head back and stare out the window. I don\u0027t turn to look at him. It\u0027s late by the time we hit the open stretch of highway back to the beach house. I wonder about him. I wonder who he really is, what he really sees. He does such a good job of hiding everything that I realize I have no clue. There\u0027s a passionate side to Cole, but there\u0027s something softer and more vulnerable, too. \"What are you thinking?\" he finally asks, glancing between me and the road. I shrug, like I\u0027m not thinking anything, like I\u0027m not obsessing about him and wondering about his past. \"Just wondering about stuff,\" I mutter the half-truth to cover the lie, then add, \"Nothing really.\" \"You have that far off look in your eyes. I\u0027ve been around you long enough to figure out what that means, so spill Lamore. What has your brain in a knot?\" He smiles softly at me. I glance over at him wondering if I\u0027m so transparent all the time, or if he just reads me better than others. I sigh and shake my head, \"It\u0027s none of my business, but I saw something I wasn\u0027t supposed to see when I grabbed your bail money.\" I shrug like it\u0027s no big deal, and glance at him out of the corner of my eye. \"It was a picture of you in an army uniform and a beat up Tiffany\u0027s box. It looked like it\u0027d been run over.\" He says nothing and stares at the empty road, concentrating as if it were rush hour. I\u0027m looking at my hands, running my thumb over the thumbnail on my other hand. My voice is soft, \"You looked so young and afraid. And the ring, I guess there\u0027s a heartbreaking story there?\" His shoulders tense. Cole works his jaw and swallows hard as I finish speaking. I think he\u0027s angry, but I can\u0027t tell. I look at my hands and say, \"I didn\u0027t mean to look. I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have said anything.\" He doesn\u0027t glance at me anymore. His eyes take on a vacant stare like he\u0027s remembering something he wants to forget. \"It\u0027s fine. I\u0027d forgotten it was in there. The rest of those pictures were burned.\" He doesn\u0027t acknowledge the Tiffany ring. Burned? There\u0027s a story there, a part of him that I want to know. I can\u0027t not ask. Carefully, I say, \"Why\u0027d you enlist? I mean, most families would have disowned a kid over something like that.\" Now he glances at me. His eyes are cold as stone and I visibly flinch. \"What makes you think mine didn\u0027t?\" His words are filled with scorn for someone else, but some of it drips onto me. I falter. My mouth hangs open. \"But, you\u0027re the only heir - \" I sputter, shocked, not believing what he\u0027s implying. A sole heir wouldn\u0027t be disowned. That\u0027s extraordinarily bad. I can\u0027t even imagine what he\u0027d done. Enlisting doesn\u0027t seem big enough to warrant such a reaction, but as I look at him, I know I can\u0027t ask. I seriously doubt my mother would have been disowned if there were no cousins, if there were no one else to claim my mother\u0027s birthright. Hedging, he says, \"You seem to know some things, for a girl who hates rich people so much.\" I laugh, but there\u0027s no joy in it, \"Yeah, well, let\u0027s just say life wasn\u0027t kind to my parents. I saw things from the wrong side and it took its toll on me.\" Suddenly I stop talking. That\u0027s my darkest secret. It fills me with anger and shame to even bring it up - anger at my Grandmother for treating her daughter so cruelly, shame that I\u0027m not more like my mom. She has backbone that I\u0027ll never possess. I look out the window, but I still see Cole out of the corner of my eye, watching me. \"I understand,\" he says and glances at me again. \"Things struck a little closer to home for me and it didn\u0027t matter that I was the sole heir. I enlisted to prove a point. They disowned me prove a point.\" He\u0027s staring out the windshield. His voice is cold. He doesn\u0027t look at me. Gripping the steering wheel of the Porsche, his knuckles turn white. I feel like I\u0027ve picked open old wounds for both of us and desperately wish I could take it back. The pain in his eyes floods me and I want to take it away. That distant look, the feeling that he\u0027s not good enough - that he\u0027ll never be good enough - is plastered across his face. Turning, I stare at him with my jaw hanging open. There\u0027s a word that\u0027s lodged itself in my throat, something I was going to say - but I\u0027ve forgotten what it was. It can\u0027t be true. He couldn\u0027t have been disinherited. Cole Stevens didn\u0027t have his family\u0027s millions? But, he\u0027s said it all along - he made Le Femme, it was his blood, sweat, and tears. Oh my God. Staring, mouth still agape, I don\u0027t know what to say. I want to tell him that I understand, but I don\u0027t get it the way my mother does. I don\u0027t know what it feels like to have everything one day and nothing the next. His parents blindsided him. They chose money over love. They rejected their only child. I finally say, \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know.\" Shrugging, he says, \"It\u0027s not your fault, so there\u0027s no reason to apologize. And no one knows. It was part of our agreement.\" He laughs and shakes his head like it\u0027s some cruel joke. \"I was allowed to keep my name - my fucking name - if I didn\u0027t tell anyone that I\u0027d lost my inheritance. Even that wasn\u0027t mine. Anyway, it\u0027s a long story, but the short version is that you should never piss off a Stevens\u0027. They have long memories and will tear you apart when you least expect it.\" The savageness in his voice startles me. \"But,\" I say softly, \"you\u0027re a Stevens.\" You\u0027re not like them. You can\u0027t be, I think. His eyes are on the road, staring into the inky night. \"I know.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-9.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams.
