{"id":83037,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"When we arrive at a tall building, it\u0027s late. He pulls up in front, gets out and walks around to my door. Before I can move, he has it open and pulls me up to my feet. Cole tosses the keys to a valet and we walk inside.\n The doorman nods, \"Mr. Stevens.\" Cole nods and passes him, his hand in mine tugging me along.\n The elevator door opens before I know it and Cole leads me inside. When the doors close, my heart is pounding. I stare at him, remembering his hands on me... remembering the dream. I swallow hard.\n Cole keeps his distance. I know where we\u0027re going even though he doesn\u0027t tell me. I figured it out somewhere on the highway back into the city. He is taking me to see those paintings, the ones he mentioned before. My stomach twists as he gazes at me. The elevator stops and the doors open. We\u0027re in the penthouse. His home.\n Cole steps through, but I can\u0027t move. Fear snakes up my legs and binds me to the floor. Everything from the scent to the colors has my heart racing faster. It\u0027s Cole. This place is his haven, his security blanket. I don\u0027t belong here.\n Before I can do something stupid, he sighs and walks back toward me. He holds out his hand, \"Come on, Anna. I won\u0027t bite.\"\n My eyes slide over his face and I put my hand in his. I don\u0027t like this. Being in his home is demolishing the remaining ill conceptions I have of him like a buffalo in a china shop. Everything just shatters. There is no cold sterile modern furniture. Everything is plush and warm, decorated in deep blues, browns, and blacks. It\u0027s not one of the museum homes of the wealthy, it\u0027s Cole\u0027s home and he lives here.\n He flips on lights as we walk through. They illuminate the walls creating a subtle golden glow. Cole stops in the kitchen and goes to the cabinets, pulling out wine glasses. I don\u0027t say anything. I feel nervous and I don\u0027t know why. Part of me is scared that I\u0027ll agree with him and change my mind. The other part senses something about him, about Cole, that makes me nervous.\n He hands me a glass of wine. \"I don\u0027t know about you, but this is unusual for me.\" I know what he means. This situation makes him nervous. Since I feel the same way, I take the glass.\n I follow him into a room at the back of the apartment. When I see the bed, I realize it\u0027s his bedroom and stop. It feels like I\u0027m being strangled. My grip on the glass is so tight it could shatter. I raise the wine to my lips and sip, hoping it will calm whatever has me on edge. I enter the room behind Cole, but I don\u0027t see the art he wants to show me. The walls are barren like he hasn\u0027t decorated this part of the apartment. A large poster bed made from dark wood is in the center of the room. I look at it, thinking things about Cole that I shouldn\u0027t. Tearing my gaze away from the bed, I look down at the dark wood floor and glance around. There is a row of windows and a balcony that overlooks a perfect skyline.\n I\u0027m not sure where he\u0027s going, but Cole continues walking in front of me and crosses the room. My heart rate steadies, but there\u0027s still something intimate about this. I inhale a little too deeply and notice it\u0027s Cole\u0027s cologne that I like after I\u0027ve already done it. Guilt flames my cheeks and I pretend that I didn\u0027t do it.\n Cole passes straight through the room without comment, and pulls open the closet doors. A light pops on. It\u0027s a huge walk-in with clothing lining both walls and a chair. Oak drawers and shelves line the lower part of the walls. The room smells like Cole. I don\u0027t cross the threshold. I stop and watch him.\n Cole crosses the wardrobe in three strides, and reaches for a knob at the back of the closet and pulls open a door. There\u0027s a tiny darkened closet back there filled with large rectangle-shaped sheets. Those must be the paintings. I don\u0027t understand why they are hidden in his closet if he values them.\n He looks back at me. As if reading my mind, he says, \"They\u0027re hidden for a reason. What I\u0027m showing you is rarely seen. I\u0027m curious what you think - and terrified.\" He swallows hard, his sapphire eyes on my face. He stands there for a moment, suspended like he can\u0027t decide if he wants to show me or not.\n My voice is small. I step toward him asking, \"Why would it matter what I think? I\u0027m nobody.\" Condensation is beading on my glass. I wipe a trail through it with my thumb. I don\u0027t look up at him. I don\u0027t want to see his face when he answers.\n There\u0027s a pause before he says, \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re entirely wrong.\"\n I lift my eyes and see him watching me. Cole\u0027s blue gaze makes my stomach feel like it\u0027s in a free fall. His lips part like he\u0027s going to say more, but he doesn\u0027t. I wish he would. I wish he felt comfortable saying his secrets to me, but I suppose this is a secret. The paintings are something he doesn\u0027t show people and I\u0027m standing here waiting to see them. A warm glow spreads through me until I remember the circumstances of my being here. It was to prove a point, and nothing more. I clutch my glass harder.\n Instead of saying more, Cole reaches into the shadows and pulls out a large painting that\u0027s draped with a white sheet. Moving closer, I walk into his dressing room holding my breath. Goosebumps line my arms. The hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I\u0027m nervous. My stomach is twisting and I don\u0027t know why.\n Cole\u0027s voice is too soft. He hands me the painting and says, \"Here.\" I take it from him.\n \"Cole,\" I stand there frozen. For some reason this doesn\u0027t feel like he\u0027s just trying to prove a point. I can\u0027t pull the sheet off. It feels like I\u0027m seeing something forbidden.\n After a moment, Cole glances at me, \"Just look at it, Anna.\"\n I swallow hard and pull the sheet. The drape falls to the floor and I don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m seeing. I feel Cole behind me, but he\u0027s silent. My eyes take in the piece of art in my hands. The stretched canvas is too big to hold for long, so I set it down. It has no frame, just a black edge. My gaze follows the blue lines across the painting. It\u0027s the curves of a woman\u0027s body, her neck, her arms, her waist, her breasts, but I can\u0027t see her. She\u0027s lost in shadow. It\u0027s a sensual showcasing of her curves in shadow and light. I\u0027m mute, staring at it. While the piece is stunning, that isn\u0027t what rendered me speechless. I can\u0027t admit why I\u0027m drawn to it.\n I swallow the lump in my throat as I stare. I move closer, trying to understand how it was created. It looks like a photograph printed on canvas that was painted, but the light is so unusual. It almost looks like watercolors, soft and pure.\n I find my voice and ask, \"How was this done? Why does your light source look like that?\"\n \"I promise I\u0027ll tell you,\" Cole says, \"But tell me what you think.\"\n I swallow hard. I feel the longing in this piece. I can\u0027t stop staring at it. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" I breathe. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. The light is so pale it looks like she\u0027s been painted, but it\u0027s not a painting - is it? It\u0027s a photograph, or at least it started that way.\" I reach out to touch it and stop myself.\n \"Go ahead,\" he says, allowing me to commit a cardinal sin. My fingers slide across the smooth canvas. I can\u0027t fathom how he made it. \"What else?\" I feel his gaze on the side of my face. Every time my heart beats, I feel it. I feel everything. It\u0027s like I\u0027m inside Cole\u0027s body, touching his soul. It makes me shiver. I don\u0027t have words for it.\n Finally I say something. \"She\u0027s different from your Le Femme models. This woman is unedited, imperfect.\" I notice that first. The majority of my time at Le Femme has been spent editing away cellulite and smoothing skin. I stare at the unedited piece. \"But that imperfection makes her real. It makes me wonder who she is and why she feels so lost. The way the light falls across her naked body, the way she was moving, reminds me of - \" I bite my tongue. It was a silly thought, a memory from an old story.\n \"Reminds you of what?\" his voice is too sweet, too fragile, to not answer. I look over my shoulder at him and then lower my lashes, not able to look him in the eye when I say it.\n \"It reminds me of Bathsheba bathing on the roof in the moonlight, unaware of her effect on the king. She has no idea how beautiful she is, what she does to him, how she makes him feel... It\u0027s beautiful and tragic. Like this...\" I turn and look up at him. Stubble lines his cheeks making his eyes appear bluer than this morning. I repress a shiver and turn back to the piece. \"When did you make this?\"\n \"A lifetime ago.\"\n I press my lips together when I realize this piece fits my description of art. I don\u0027t want to admit it, but he\u0027s right. It is evocative. I close my eyes, realizing what I said, that I just proved his point for him. When I open my eyes I whisper, \"I\u0027m not a hypocrite. They can\u0027t all be like this. Every image can\u0027t portray emotions like that, Cole. It\u0027s not possible.\"\n As I start speaking, he turns away and takes the next painting from the closet. He pulls the drape off and I gasp and turn away from it when I realize what I\u0027m looking at. He sets the painting down and says, \"You promised you\u0027d look. Anna, this isn\u0027t something you\u0027ve never seen before. Look at it and tell me what you see... why you looked away.\"\n \"Cole, she\u0027s! That\u0027s!\" I\u0027m sputtering like an idiot. The image was beautiful, but I feel my face growing hotter and hotter. I can\u0027t look at it.\n \"It\u0027s what? I don\u0027t understand you,\" he says, baffled. Cole steps in front of me and looks at the piece and back at my face. \"How can you look at the first one and not this one?\"\n Suddenly, I don\u0027t know. They should be the same. But they\u0027re not. This one shows a woman with her back arched, her breasts thrust upward, her hand just below her navel. It\u0027s sexy, all lines, and curves, and shadows. A pale light source defines her curves in a creamy violet. The rest of her body is lost in inky shadows.\n Nervously, I look at it again, \"Because they\u0027re not the same.\"\n \"They are. I made them the same way. How are they different? I don\u0027t understand you. Is it evocative? Can you feel a strong emotion when you look at it?\" His voice is soft. I remember that he doesn\u0027t show these to anyone, but I still can\u0027t hide my shock.\n \"That\u0027s not the point,\" my face is flushed and his eyes on me make it worse. Suddenly I feel like the room is too small and Cole is too close. I want to back out, but I can\u0027t.\n \"Anna?\" he asks, almost pleading with me.\n Looking at him, my voice catches in my throat. He looks so vulnerable, like a single word could crush him. The expression in his eyes makes me answer, \"The first one was beautiful and sensual. This one is too graphic, too bold. You can\u0027t do that. You can\u0027t take pictures of women doing that. It\u0027s not right.\"\n He glances at the painting and back at me, \"Doing what?\" He\u0027s serious. I look past him at the painting and blush. \"Anna,\" he says, \"Is it possible that your mind is much dirtier than the images you\u0027re seeing? Is there any chance that you think things happened there that didn\u0027t?\"\n Maybe. I hesitate. \"She\u0027s not... touching herself?\" I ask timidly. That\u0027s what I thought when I looked at it. The arch of her back, the way her breasts are thrust upward, and I can\u0027t see her other hand.\n He laughs, \"No. She was laying on a cold floor. It made her arch her back like that.\" He\u0027s watching me, his eyes study my face. He\u0027s not arrogant now. Uncertainty sits well on him, if anything it makes him sexier. Seeing this confident man care about what I think makes me wonder why.\n He interrupts my thoughts, \"Anna, I wish you could see what I see.\" The tone of Cole\u0027s voice is soft, wistful.\n I can\u0027t be quiet. I glance at him out of the corner of my eye. \"What do you see in that piece?\" Now I want to know. If it\u0027s not what I thought, then I want to know what he thinks it is. I force myself to look at the piece of art again. It makes my stomach twist. The way her body is laying, the arch of her back, the tension in her arms - she looks like she\u0027s in ecstasy. I can\u0027t ignore it. The evocative nature of the image is too powerful.\n Shaking my head, I breathe, \"No one has ever touched me so that my body moved like that.\" Once the words are out, I wish they weren\u0027t.\n Cole steps closer to me. His eyes are on the side of my face, drinking it in like he can\u0027t get enough. I can tell that he wants to say something - that he wants to answer me - but he doesn\u0027t. My heart races as he watches me. I can\u0027t breathe. He\u0027s too close. This is too intimate. It feels like I\u0027m coming unglued and I don\u0027t know what to do, what to say. The effect he has on me is powerful, and I\u0027m having trouble hiding it. If my heart pounds any harder, I swear to God, he\u0027ll hear it.\n Cole tucks his chin. He puts his glass of wine down somewhere. His arms fold over his chest. That beautiful dark shiny hair falls over his eyes, making it impossible to see them in the dim glow. I wish I could read his face, his eyes, the same way he reads mine. I wish I was inside his head when he made this painting. Did he really see something else? Was it really not a depiction of ecstasy? And if it was, was it wrong? Was it pornographic? At this very moment, I don\u0027t feel like it is. It feels like sublime beauty, like the last canvas he showed me.\n Finally, he answers my previous question and turns from me. His voice is deep, seductive, \"I see shadows and light, curves and lines. Beauty mingled with power. Femininity and softness. I see desire. I see someone who doesn\u0027t know if her body is good enough. The position of her hand makes me think that. It sits on her stomach as if she\u0027s hiding something. As if she has secrets I\u0027ll never know...\"\n Silence engulfs us and we both stare at his work, neither of us brave enough to speak. My body is covered in goose-bumps. I don\u0027t know what to think. I\u0027m caught in the middle. My mind registers things like this as trash, or they are supposed to be, but after seeing it - after hearing Cole speak about it - how can I think that? It was my mouth that said the requirement for something to be art was the ability to evoke emotion, and here I am stunned into silence by something I wouldn\u0027t have considered art yesterday.\n Damn. I\u0027m a hypocrite. I don\u0027t like it. It feels like I\u0027ve been blindsided, but Cole doesn\u0027t stop. He doesn\u0027t let me catch my breath.\n Instead, he takes another canvas from its resting place and pulls the sheet off. When the drape hits the floor my toes curl inside my shoes. I can\u0027t breathe. It\u0027s another nude, another woman bathed in golden light. Long dark hair falls to her hips in curls. Her arms are stretched over her head, thrusting her chest out. The light catches the curve of the bottom of her breast, the softness of her jaw, the fullness of her hips - and there are glittering jewels hanging from her nipples.\n Staring at it, I\u0027m hyperaware of every inch of my body. My eyes fixate on her breasts, on those dangling jewels. It feels like someone sucked all the air out of the room. Heat engulfs me. I shouldn\u0027t be looking, but I can\u0027t stop. This kind of thing is too sensual, and it\u0027s too beautiful. I can\u0027t look away. I can\u0027t understand why I don\u0027t feel offended, and realize that it\u0027s because this is art that reflects Cole\u0027s heart. I\u0027m seeing part of him when I look at these pieces. This woman meant something to him. She had to.\n Glancing at him, I wonder who she is - this faceless woman who is concealed in shadows and hidden at the back of his closet - locked away from the world. It\u0027s part of a life he hides, a part of Cole Stevens that remains a secret.\n \"Who is she?\" I ask finally.\n Cole shakes his head once. Dark hair sways over downcast eyes. He doesn\u0027t look up. He doesn\u0027t answer. I don\u0027t know if he won\u0027t or he can\u0027t. This isn\u0027t a random model. The images feel too intense for that.\n Trying to be less personal, I ask, \"How did you make these? The light is so soft. So stunning. I can\u0027t figure out how you did it - \"\n Cole unfolds his arms, resuming the role of teacher. The softness in his eyes seeps back to the place he hides it in his heart. \"It\u0027s painting with light. It uses the camera, but the exposure is much longer. The model sits in a pitch black room. I set the camera on the tripod and release the shutter. Then I literally paint the model with a colored light. I move the light over her and it\u0027s kind of like a paintbrush, highlighting the areas I want and leaving the rest in darkness. It makes a soft color-wash over her skin.\"\n I blink twice and turn my head back toward the print. \"But I don\u0027t see you in these.\" For that to happen, the exposure had to be pretty long - like minutes, not seconds. I\u0027m astounded that he thought to do this. I\u0027ve never seen it before. At least, I\u0027ve never seen this concept with boudoir portraits. Cole is watching me as my mind races with questions. He knows I\u0027ll latch onto the technical aspect and appears eager to discuss it with me.\n \"How long is the exposure?\"\n \"Several minutes,\" the toe of his shoe picks a spot on the floor. Arms folded over his chest, he says, \"You won\u0027t see me unless I stand still for a moment, but I\u0027m there - moving through the shadows, spilling light across her body like rain pouring from the sky.\"\n Something occurs to me while he speaks. Turning to Cole, I say, \"This is the kind of work you want me shooting, isn\u0027t it? The Le Femme studio you\u0027re putting out East isn\u0027t like the one in the city. You want it to be something else - something like this.\" I already know the answer, but it doesn\u0027t stop the shock from spreading across my face. When he asked me to run the Long Island studio and said it was boudoir photography, I totally freaked out thinking he wanted something else.\n But this. This intimidates the crap out of me. I don\u0027t know how to do this. I don\u0027t know how to make powerful images like these.\n \"Yes,\" he nods. \"Or something similar. I want you shooting art. I want your images to be evocative and powerful; seductive and feminine.\"\n I look at the canvas and don\u0027t turn my face back toward him. For a moment, I say nothing. A crazy thought is bouncing around in my mind and it won\u0027t shut up. Seeing these, seeing this part of Cole, is shocking. I don\u0027t know why, but I assumed he wasn\u0027t capable of this. I just stand there, mute until he asks again and this time I nod. At this moment, I recognize that my perception has changed. I can feel it shattering, cracking apart like shards of ice, and falling away.\n His art has changed me - Cole changed me.\n My mind resists accepting it. My body feels like I\u0027m being strangled. I can\u0027t do this. I don\u0027t know how. Cole\u0027s passion spills across the canvas more powerfully than anything I\u0027ve ever seen. It\u0027s feminine and beautiful and powerful. It\u0027s everything I want to do, everything I want to be. Wedding photography is something that most women will need at some point. It is a single chance to show them that they are beautiful, but this - what Cole is offering gives me the chance to do that but even more so. I see it. It\u0027s crystal clear. And I realize that I want to learn how. My mind is at war with itself. The prudent side is assaulting my rationale trying to poke holes in it. I can\u0027t tell who\u0027s winning, but my mouth shocks the hell out of both of them when I speak and say the crazy idea that\u0027s forming in my head.\n Glancing at Cole, I say with complete certainty, \"I want one.\"\n \"What?\" Cole turns toward me. He blinks and opens his eyes wider like that might disprove what he heard me say.\n That was the thought that was trapped inside my mind. As soon as I felt my previous conceptualizations crack, I knew that I\u0027d want to learn everything about this. I\u0027m intrigued and terrified.\n My heart thumps when I say it and my palms grow hotter. \"I need to know what it feels like on the other end of the lens. I can learn the practical part with models, but this - \" I shake my head, \"it\u0027s not about knowledge, it\u0027s about feeling. It captures the client\u0027s beauty in a powerful way. The only way for me to know how the client feels is to actually be the woman in the portrait.\" My gaze locks on his. His sapphire eyes search mine, his brow pinched with shock. \"Shoot me, Cole.\"\n He seems shy, like the idea hadn\u0027t crossed his mind. He doesn\u0027t look away when he says, \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea.\" His lips part like he wants to say more, but he doesn\u0027t.\n \"Cole,\" I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to say. I just know that this is important. I can\u0027t understand this wholly if I don\u0027t. \"Please. It\u0027s a shoot. We\u0027re both grown-ups here. We can manage this.\" Well, I was hoping we could. I shrug like it\u0027s no big deal, \"Besides, you said you only do one-nighters and I\u0027m not that kind of girl.\"\n He works his jaw and looks up at me from under his brow. \"I never said I only do one-nighters. I offered you a one-nighter.\"\n \"And I said no,\" I reply absently, no longer looking at him. \"So there\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\n I\u0027m staring at the paintings. The thought of a shoot like this has butterflies swirling in my stomach. I walk past Cole and pull out more canvases, looking at more of Cole\u0027s work. He watches me, silently. The paintings aren\u0027t what I thought they\u0027d be. If light could be liquefied and poured into a paint can, that is what Cole made - something sensual, beautiful, and completely sexy.\n \"I can admit I was wrong,\" I say turning toward him. \"This is art. I see it now. You showed me something I didn\u0027t think was possible and there\u0027s no way in hell I can shoot this kind of stuff without submerging myself in it.\n \"There\u0027s a reason why Sottero wanted me, Cole. There\u0027s a reason why I\u0027m at the top of my class. I don\u0027t do things half way. If I see something I want to do, I learn everything about it, and I\u0027m taking you up on your offer. I\u0027ll run the Long Island branch of Le Femme. I\u0027ll shoot this kind of stuff, but you have to shoot me first. It\u0027s nonnegotiable.\"\n He blinks at me and shakes his head, \"God, Anna. I - \" He runs his hands through his hair and sighs. I know I\u0027ve won. I know he\u0027ll do it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-8.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams.
