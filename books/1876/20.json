{"id":83049,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Somehow a routine develops. I work out East, Cole works in the city. We have dinner together and then head back to his place where we talk until one of us passes out. I\u0027ve woken up in his bed more times in the past three weeks than I\u0027ve slept in my own. I wonder what this is, what he\u0027s doing, but I\u0027m too afraid to ask. I\u0027m just glad to have him in any capacity at all. One night after dinner, I\u0027m laying on his bed staring at the ceiling. I feel Cole\u0027s eyes on me - they are always on me - but I don\u0027t turn to look at him. His gaze lingers, sliding over my breasts, watching me breathe as my chest slowly rises and falls. His fingers slip the buttons through the holes on his shirt. I let him look. I like it and wish he\u0027d do more. The man has self-control like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. \"Cole,\" I ask, still looking at the ceiling. \"Mmmm?\" he says, his eyes still searing into my body as he peels the shirt off his chest and tosses it in the hamper. He stands there bare skinned, in nothing but jeans. I\u0027m dying to look at him, but I don\u0027t. He hesitates like he knows I want to look before grabbing a tee shirt from the dresser. I want to ask him how he does it, how he can lay next to me night after night and not touch me. My fingers twist the sheets. \"Are you seeing anyone?\" Maybe that was it. Maybe he has a sex friend and I\u0027m his other friend. The one that he sleeps with. Jealousy flames through me at the thought. I want to be the sex friend. Hell, I want to be his only friend. \"Why would you ask that?\" he stops and looks at me bewildered. I shrug, \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s just... \" Suddenly he\u0027s much closer. He\u0027s standing next to the bed looking down at me. I keep my gaze on the ceiling. \"Just what?\" he asks, like this is normal. I lower my gaze and look at my hands. The question is caught in my throat. I don\u0027t look at him. \"You want more?\" I feel his eyes on my face, but I can\u0027t look up. My heart is pounding, wondering if I just ruined whatever we had. \"There isn\u0027t more than this. This is the best of what I can offer you. The rest is too...,\" he shakes his head, \"It\u0027s just not possible.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-20.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden. And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy? What if he\u0027s right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers? Cole\u0027s more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she\u0027s been missing.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2.jpg","author":"H.M.
