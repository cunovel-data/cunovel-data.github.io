{"id":83041,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"By the time I pull on my robe, Cole is nowhere to be found. I walk to my room and shower, washing off the rest of the adhesive that clings to my skin. I want to know why Cole ran. How could he say he\u0027s falling in love with me, and then refuse to touch me? For a moment, I feel sick, like maybe he didn\u0027t want me, that he just said those things to touch me - but that isn\u0027t like him. I\u0027ve seen him shoot other women. Cole isn\u0027t that guy. He doesn\u0027t give or take affection lightly. The water pelts me in the face and I realize that I can\u0027t rationalize what happened. I can\u0027t make it go away. By the time I get dressed, it\u0027s midafternoon. I pull my hair into a high ponytail and go to search for Regina. As mortifying as it is, I have to smooth things over with her. When I find her, she\u0027s in the storage area sorting through old backdrops. Her red hair is draped over her shoulders as she hunches over boxes, unpacking them one by one. Regina glances up at me as I enter the doorway and quickly averts her eyes. Before I can say anything she straightens and blurts out, \"I had no idea you two were intimate. I thought it was a shoot.\" She drops the fabric that was clutched between her fingers. The look on her face tells me that she\u0027s equally as horrified. I lift my hand to silence her, \"It was a shoot, but - \" I shrug like I don\u0027t know what happened \"things took an interesting turn. I would have told you, you know. If we were...\" I trail off. The knot in my throat is strangling me. If we were what, Anna? There\u0027s nothing between me and Cole, save a few kisses. In the back of my mind, I hear his voice - that hushed tone confessing that he\u0027s falling in love with me. I can\u0027t ignore it. Regina watches me for a moment. She doesn\u0027t seem to know what to say. \"It\u0027s not my place to ask or know about anything like that. You don\u0027t need to tell me anything, Miss Lamore. I just hope that I didn\u0027t make you so uncomfortable that I lose my job.\" Regina\u0027s face flushes as she says it. The woman could have avoided me for days and never asked, but she\u0027s too blunt for that. I smile. I like her straight-forwardness. Shaking my head I say, \"Your job isn\u0027t affected by my stupidity. I promise.\" She smiles at me and I nod. When I turn to leave, she says, \"For what it\u0027s worth, I haven\u0027t seen Mr. Stevens with anyone for some time. You must have really turned his head.\" I stop and look back at her, \"What do you mean?\" She hunches over the box and goes back to work. I can tell she doesn\u0027t want to say more, but she does, \"Let\u0027s just say that his playboy ways are something of an illusion.\" I don\u0027t know what to say, so I nod. Regina goes back to work. I walk away feeling more confused than before. I wander out of the studio, planning on going for a ride on my motorcycle to clear my head when I notice Cole\u0027s car is gone. No Porsche. I close my eyes and shake my head. What did I do? Sighing deeply, I walk over to the bike and lean against it. It has to be me, right? I mean, Cole was in the moment and then something made him run. It was like he was sprayed with ice water. He didn\u0027t even stick around to give me an explanation. I can\u0027t figure him out and its driving me nuts. I wonder if that little shoot just destroyed our relationship. I wish I could take it back. I wish I hadn\u0027t done it. Tears sting my eyes, but I refuse to cry. I rub my eye with the back of my hand when a voice makes me jump. \"It\u0027s beach time baby! I figured why wait until you invite me. I mean, how hard could it be to find this place?\" Emma is standing there with her head tilted to the side and a wry smile on her face. \"Emma,\" I turn toward her and feel the tears break free. \"Whoa!\" she says when I wrap my arms around her and start sobbing in her ear. She pats my back, \"What\u0027s wrong? What happened?\" I shake my head, too upset to talk. Sniffling I say, \"Let\u0027s just get out of here. Tell me you drove, because I can\u0027t see straight to drive us.\" She nods, taking me to her car on the other side of the house. When we\u0027re inside, I bite back the sobs that want to keep coming as tears stream down my cheeks. \"What the hell happened?\" she asks, looking over at me. \"I thought everything happened, but it turned out to be nothing. Emma, take me away from here.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-12.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together.

And Anna didn\u0027t feel that way about him, at least she didn\u0027t think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that\u0027s all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend. But what if Cole\u0027s the right guy?
