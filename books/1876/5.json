{"id":83034,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"By the time I\u0027m driving East on my bike, I\u0027m in a horrible mood. Edward wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer. He is convinced that we belong together, that destiny will reunite us. I ended up being harsher than I wanted. I took his beautiful roses, shoved them back into his arms, and pushed him out the door. I literally threw him out. He gave me his love and I tossed him out like trash.\n I wish there was traffic, something to distract me during the drive, but the roads are fairly empty. When l I hit the end of the highway and it turns into rural roads, it\u0027s barren. There isn\u0027t another vehicle in sight.\n I follow Cole\u0027s directions and stop at a beach-front home that has been converted into his studio. Outside there is the Le Femme sign, but the colors are different - hot pink and black. His New York City studio is pale blue and gray. I wonder why this one is different, but don\u0027t pay it much attention. Different locations can have different colors. Besides, what do I know? Le Femme is his business, not mine, and if he thinks it makes sense to rebrand his studio, that has nothing to do with me.\n Parking the bike on the side of the house, I get off and stretch. The air is balmy and warm. The sound of the ocean fills my ears. Seeing Cole after this morning\u0027s event with Edward is too much. My emotions are in overdrive and I can\u0027t contain them. It feels like my eyes will betray me and gush tears at any moment.\n No, I can\u0027t see Cole. Not yet. So, I set my helmet on the bike and walk toward the water. The sound of the ocean lapping into the shore calms me. Cole is so lucky to have this place. I\u0027d live here year-round if I had a place like this. It is isolated, but part of a smaller town outside of the Hamptons hamlet, or whatever you call them. Townships? Anyway, it is perfect. The town itself feels like a piece of Americana New England. It is picturesque. Add in the house and it\u0027s a dream. I sit down on the sand, and watch the waves crash into the shore. The wind whips my hair, separating tiny strands that float on their own. My mind clears after a few moments and I feel a little better.\n \"It\u0027s beautiful, isn\u0027t it?\" his voice flows over my shoulder, sending a chill down my spine. I turn, sucking in a deep breath. Cole\u0027s staring at the surf like there might be mermaids in there.\n \"Sublimely so,\" I answer softly. I wonder how Cole can act like nothing happened last night, but he does. It makes me wonder if I misread him, if he was really just offering me a guest room.\n \"Ah, and that\u0027s the most bewitching kind of beauty. Isn\u0027t it?\" Cole is standing barefoot a few paces from me.\n He offers his hand, but I don\u0027t take it. \"Come on, Lamore. Let me show you around.\" He puts his hands back in his pockets and gazes at the ocean once more before turning back toward the house. He walks away from me before I can get up. I jump up and follow him inside.\n The exterior of the studio looks like a little a Cape Cod style house complete with gray shingles and white trim. It\u0027s perfect. We pass through glass sliding doors that lead to the beach.\n Cole says, \"The studio has several rooms. There is a guest section with full bedding. Each room has a private bath.\" And it does. As we peek in the empty rooms, Cole shows me the upscale finishes with marble tiles and white fixtures. It\u0027s so soft and feminine. I wish I had a bathroom like this. It\u0027s completely perfect. Cole forgot nothing.\n He looks down at me and says, \"The staff gets these two rooms, and the others are for clients who need to stay overnight. Some will want to fly in or need the session in the evening. The assistant will oversee all this, so you don\u0027t have to worry about it.\" Before I can ask anything, he\u0027s walking again. I stop gazing at the room and follow him.\n Cole leads me into a room that still smells of paint, \"This is the shooting room. The electricians fell behind, so it isn\u0027t ready yet. That slows things down a little bit. The lights will be there and there. Additional units can be placed at these intervals.\" He shows me the room, and is talking layout, but I don\u0027t understand what he\u0027s shooting.\n The set-up is similar to his city studio, but it\u0027s different - smaller and more posh. The sets have more details, more color. One set is solid pink like strawberry soda. It has a lightness, and feels girlie and seductive at the same time.\n I walk through it, and touch the velvet blankets, and then the flocked paper on the walls. It makes my jaw drop. I notice things as we walk around. After seeing the shooting room, Cole shows me the office where I\u0027ll be working and which computer is mine. Everything is pink and black. The decor doesn\u0027t match his other studio. His branding is glaringly different, like he\u0027s trying to do something different out here, but for the life of me, I can\u0027t tell what.\n Finally, I ask, \"So what is this place, Stevens? It has your studio\u0027s name, but none of your branding. What gives?\"\n He leans on the reception desk and folds his arms across his chest, \"It\u0027s a new division of Le Femme, a division that I\u0027m putting you in charge of.\" He watches me from under dark lashes, waiting for my reaction.\n \"What?\" I breathe, turning to him. Is he serious? He can\u0027t be. I\u0027m an intern, which makes his suggestion insane.\n \"I\u0027m trying something new. This was the reason I wanted you to take the internship with me and not Sottero. I\u0027ve been keeping track of you for a while, watching you turn into the perfect artist to work here.\"\n My eyebrow creeps up my face as he speaks. I don\u0027t ignore the fact that he\u0027s been watching me, but I can\u0027t get over the obvious. \"But, I\u0027m an intern,\" I sputter.\n He looks at me like I\u0027m insane. \"So?\" he shrugs. \"And that\u0027s bad because - ?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m too young to be entrusted with something like this.\"\n A dark brow lifts. He shakes his head, \"Says who? You? You\u0027re telling me that you wouldn\u0027t want this? That you couldn\u0027t do it?\"\n My eyes narrow. I wonder what game he\u0027s playing, if this has something to do with last night or if he just wants to make me cry. I feel too emotional today. I can\u0027t handle his teasing, not after everything that\u0027s happened. \"Don\u0027t jerk me around just because you can. We weren\u0027t all born with a silver spoon in our mouths. A job like this would matter to me--\"\n He cuts me off, \"You don\u0027t even know what the job is.\" He\u0027s smug, \"So don\u0027t go pulling the silver spoon crap. And for your information, this studio came from my own blood, sweat, and tears and no one else\u0027s. Both studios did.\"\n I laugh. My arms fold over my chest defensively. \"Yeah, right. The trust fund baby must have had a hard time getting everything set up.\" There\u0027s a bite to my voice when I speak again. It says don\u0027t screw with me and I know Cole senses it. \"Every single thing you have was handed to you because of your name or your fortune. Don\u0027t tell me about blood, sweat, and tears. Those are things that you don\u0027t understand. The rich are cold conniving snakes, playing games for eternity, trying to outwit everyone around them, but in the end they lose - they always lose - because they find out they never had anyone who didn\u0027t love them for their money.\" By the time I\u0027m done, my body is close to shaking. For some reason this feels incredibly personal. Steadying myself, I realize that it\u0027s because of my Grandmother and the effect she\u0027s had on my family.\n Cole\u0027s brow inches higher and higher as I speak. \"So, you think you have me all figured out?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" I want to tell him that I have him figured out, that he\u0027s just like the rest of them, but I know it\u0027s not true. There\u0027s a piece that doesn\u0027t fit. Trying to figure out Cole is like having a puzzle with several pieces missing. I have an idea of what\u0027s there, but without those pieces, I\u0027ll never see the whole picture.\n He\u0027s silent, watching me fume. Finally, he says, \"What do you want, Anna?\"\n I want you to want me. I want your arms around my waist, your hand on my cheek. I want to feel you against me. I want you... I don\u0027t say any of it.\n I breathe hard, and look away. \"Just tell me what you want from me. I\u0027ve been jerked around enough for one lifetime.\"\n He watches me like he\u0027s assessing something. His expression is unreadable. He glances down and says, \"Fair enough.\" Our gazes meet when he looks up. \"I want you to run this studio. My intention is to spend the summer with you, teaching you how. In the fall, I\u0027ll return to the city and we\u0027ll catch up a few times a year when we go over fiscal information. Like I said, I\u0027ve been keeping tabs on you for a while. You have the skills needed to do this.\"\n I eye him. He keeps skipping something, a pertinent detail. I still don\u0027t know what he\u0027s shooting out here, so I ask, \"What type of studio is this?\"\n \"Boudoir.\"\n \"Cole!\" I\u0027m yelling and I don\u0027t know why. It\u0027s my dream job, but instead of shooting brides, I\u0027ll be shooting naked women. Tears sting my eyes, but I blink them back. I turn toward him and he slides off the desk. I slam my hands into his chest. \"How could you do this to me? You offered everything I want and everything I said I\u0027d never do!\" It isn\u0027t something that should leave me in tears, but I am balling. Tears race down my cheeks and I can\u0027t stop them.\n Cole\u0027s fingers wrap around my hands, keeping my palms from shoving him again, \"Why are you crying? I thought you\u0027d be happy. You like it out here. Your family is nearby. You won\u0027t be alone. And the studio...\"\n I try to yank my hands away, but he doesn\u0027t let me. I feel the rhythm of his heart beating in his chest. I look up at him, \"The studio is perfect. It\u0027s beautiful, but I want to shoot brides, not boobs. I can\u0027t do this! I can\u0027t!\"\n I threw everything away. Ditching Sottero screwed me. I can see the beginning and end of my career in this building. Although I don\u0027t mind shooting models, I don\u0027t want to do this forever. Le Femme is supposed to be a stepping stone. Cole is supposed to teach me. I know he has skills that Sottero doesn\u0027t.\n \"Listen,\" he snaps at me, tightening his grip on my hands. It makes my panic throttle down. \"I don\u0027t think I was wrong. You can do this. You have the skills. You just have your head stuck in this fantasy of being a wedding photographer. Why? Why does it matter so much that you shoot brides?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s the most romantic moment of their lives. It\u0027s the most important.\"\n \"And this isn\u0027t?\"\n \"No! It\u0027s not! These are please fuck me pictures. These aren\u0027t even art. Cole, the fact that you - \"\n He drops my hands like I\u0027ve burnt him and shakes his head. He turns away from me and runs his hands through his hair. \"Anna!\" His voice booms. When he turns back his blue eyes are livid. I\u0027ve insulted him. His jaw twitches like he wants to say things that he bites back. Finally he says, \"If you can see this is art - if you see that this is romantic and important - will you do it? Will you try?\"\n \"There is no way that I\u0027ll ever say that.\"\n He laughs and shakes his head, \"You are such a pain in the ass. Just say yes or no. If you can see that it\u0027s art will you do it?\"\n His laughter disarms me a little bit. I nod and fold my arms over my chest. \"Yes. Now please prove to me that you haven\u0027t fucked up my life beyond repair. Show me the artistic boobies so I can go beg Sottero for a second chance next year.\"\n Cole growls, leaning close to my face, \"The only person you\u0027ll ever beg for anything will be me.\"\n My heart is pounding. I can\u0027t breathe. I want to punch him. I want to kiss him. This arrogant bastard thinks that I\u0027ll believe anything he says, and he says he made this place for me. I can\u0027t let him get under my skin like this, but he\u0027s already there.\n I lean closer to him and breathe, \"I\u0027ll never beg you for a single thing.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-5.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams.
