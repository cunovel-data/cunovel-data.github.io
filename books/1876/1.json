{"id":83030,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\"I wasn\u0027t really sleeping well either,\" Cole says sympathetically. He has no idea what he\u0027s doing to me. I\u0027m breathless, embarrassed by things he can\u0027t possibly know, but it still makes my cheeks burn.\n My emotions are jumbled. I look up at him. He\u0027s too old. I\u0027m too young. He\u0027s from money. I hate money. I glance at Cole again. Damn. I still want him. That stirring, whatever put the idea into my head didn\u0027t leave when I woke up, and having him that close is like setting a magnet on a compass. My emotions are spinning like a top.\n It\u0027s after 2:00am, but I feel wound tight. Pushing off, the couch I tell him, \"I\u0027m getting a drink. You want one?\"\n Smiling, he teases, \"Sure, but are you legal?\"\n My cotton shorts cling to my hips as I walk away. I laugh over my shoulder, \"Legal to do things you couldn\u0027t imagine, old man.\" I have no idea why I said that, but it makes me feel better. Cole remains in the den, but by the time I come back with drinks, he\u0027s sitting on my bed, also known as the couch.\n He was sleeping on the floor next to me. The den doors were closed and my parents left us alone to make babies all night.\n I hand him a glass with whiskey at the bottom and a can of Coke. I have a glass of wine. When he takes his glass, I clink them together, \"Cheers.\"\n He nods, pours the Coke into his glass, and puts his feet up on the table and looks at me, \"What are we drinking to?\"\n I say the first thing that flies into my head, \"To your appreciation for women, but not women\u0027s clothes. Unless you count Le Femme\u0027s panties. You don\u0027t wear those, do you?\" I laugh and sip my wine.\n \"Only on my head. That one with the apple makes a really cool mask,\" he laughs and I spew a sip of wine, trying to stifle a laugh. \"That\u0027s second grade underpants humor, Lamore. Seriously, underpants jokes make you laugh?\"\n I\u0027m covering my mouth so I don\u0027t spew again and try to swallow the wine left in my mouth. Nearly choking, I laugh, \"Combined with the image of you dressed as a super hero, sporting tights, with a panty-mask on your face, yes.\"\n Cole grins at me.\n I rest my head against the back of the couch. Cole\u0027s sits next to me, his bare chest is distracting. He\u0027s wearing his jeans, and is barefoot. I watch his chest rise and fall out of the corner of my eye. Damn dream. I shrug like he doesn\u0027t affect me. I don\u0027t want him to.\n Changing topics I say, \"I\u0027d like to see your paintings, the ones you told me about the other day.\"\n \"Oh,\" and then he\u0027s quite. His eyes look into his glass like it has answers that he doesn\u0027t.\n \"I take it that you don\u0027t show that stuff to people too often?\"\n He shakes his head, \"No, not really.\" He\u0027s silent for a moment, then says, \"If you really want to see them, I\u0027ll show you. I owe it to you for tonight.\"\n \"Psh,\" I say swatting him in the shoulder, \"You owe me nothing. It\u0027s not like I would have left you sitting there.\" I stare at the ceiling, not thinking. Well, not wanting to.\n \"You\u0027re a rare breed, Lamore.\" He finishes his drink, sets it down, and threads his fingers behind his head.\n \"You have no idea,\" I glance at my wine glass and set it down. I rub my eyes with my hands.\n He watches me before saying, \"You say that like it\u0027s a bad thing.\"\n \"That\u0027s because most of the time it is.\" I look at him.\n Cole\u0027s sitting next to me, stretched out, completely at ease. At least he appears that way. Everything about him says he\u0027s comfortable in his own skin, that he likes who he is and what he\u0027s become. He glances at me out of the corner of his eye, \"How? How is that bad?\"\n \"It just is. I\u0027m a moron magnet. Being me attracts every loser in a twenty mile radius. The guy seems nice at first, but each and every one of them is totally messed up. Or maybe it\u0027s me. Maybe I\u0027m the one who\u0027s messed up.\" These were thoughts that had been banging around in my brain. Without Emma to talk to, they stayed there. Cole rattled me and has made me feel ten times more alive in the past day than anyone else ever has.\n Cole laughs initially, but when he realizes I was serious, he says, \"Anna, you can\u0027t be serious. It\u0027s not you.\"\n I pull a pillow across my chest, \"How would you know? You just met me. And it\u0027s not like you know me that way. You can\u0027t be sure it\u0027s not me.\" My voice softens as I speak.\n \"It\u0027s not you,\" he repeats. Tension lines his shoulders. It wasn\u0027t there a moment ago, but it seems hard to miss now.\n \"Sorry,\" I say. \"I\u0027m making you uncomfortable. I didn\u0027t mean to - \"\n When he turns to face me, my breath catches in my throat. His eyes are so soft, so sincere, that I can\u0027t look away. He takes the pillow that I crushed against my chest and I feel exposed.\n He says certainly, \"You\u0027re not making me feel uncomfortable.\" He places the pillow on the floor. When he turns back to me, he asks, \"Do you know how I can tell that it\u0027s not you?\" I shake my head. My heart races faster. His eyes search my face like he can\u0027t believe that I don\u0027t see that I\u0027m not the reason morons flock to my side. \"You\u0027re naturally inquisitive. You question everything, to the point of exasperation,\" he smiles at me like it\u0027s an endearing trait. \"Anna, people who question things usually know themselves pretty well. They want to know why things work and they try to fix them when they don\u0027t. If he was doing that - if he was trying to take care of you - you wouldn\u0027t be asking me this right now, you\u0027d be asking him.\"\n Blinking hard, I look away. I pull my knees into my chest, and wrap my hands around my ankles. \"He\u0027s tried to do what I want.\" I realize where this conversation is going. I\u0027m not sure if I want to talk about it with him. I barely know Cole, but after today, things have changed. The fact that he blindly trusts me wasn\u0027t missed. And it\u0027s so easy to talk to him.\n \"And?\" Cole prompts.\n \"And he offered to do what I want, but it\u0027s not the same. It\u0027s like the difference between really wanting a cookie and just thinking it\u0027s so-so.\" I\u0027m staring at my feet. When he doesn\u0027t\u0027 answer, I look up at him. He\u0027s smiling at me with a strange expression on his face. \"What?\"\n \"Cookies? Really? We\u0027re using a cookie metaphor in sex conversation?\" he smiles at me, and nudges my shoulder with his. \"Come on. Talk to me. You know my darkest secret. You can tell me yours.\"\n I smile softly, \"How\u0027d you know it was about sex?\" I cringe as I say it, my cheeks growing hotter.\n \"Why else would you be beat-red right now? And I\u0027m onto your diversions. Cookies, Skittles - do you always chose food when you\u0027re trying to skip over something important?\" I smile shyly at him, but don\u0027t respond. I can\u0027t say it. I want to, the question is sitting on my tongue, but I can\u0027t. \"Come on Lamore,\" he urges, bumping my shoulder again\n \"Fine,\" I say nervously. \"I\u0027ll just ask, but don\u0027t laugh at me. This is a girl question, and you\u0027re not a girl.\"\n \"Obviously,\" he grins.\n I bump his shoulder back and then say, \"Do you think a relationship has a chance if one partner is too bland for the other?\"\n \"Bland?\" he asks like he doesn\u0027t know what I mean.\n I nod, \"Yeah, like he likes things kinky and I like things vanilla.\" I have no idea why I switched our roles. Edward was vanilla, and I wanted to be the kink goddess. I didn\u0027t realize I was wringing my fingers until Cole patted my hand.\n \"Stop,\" he releases my fingers when I look up at him. \"It doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t work out, but there will also be a rift there for him. You won\u0027t feel it, but he\u0027s not going to feel satisfied as frequently. That\u0027s an issue in any relationship. And it\u0027s not something that\u0027s your fault. It\u0027s just the way it is.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027d change? That he could be more... vanilla?\" There is desperation in my voice, like I know the answer before he even says it. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I already know that things are destined to fail with Edward. I just don\u0027t want to write off a good man for something that seems so selfish, especially if he is satisfied. At the same time, dealing with bland sex for a lifetime is something that doesn\u0027t hold much appeal.\n Cole looks aside, and shakes his head. \"Sorry, but no. People like that tend to be passionate and they want to show it. It surfaces in other areas of their lives, too. A person who speaks, acts, and breathes passionately isn\u0027t going to become a subdued lover. It\u0027s not who they are... \"\n Staring at his eyes, I speak without thinking, \"A person like you.\"\n Cole is passionate. He knows what I\u0027m talking about. While he was telling me what he thought, I realize that he\u0027s talking about himself. My face flushes when I realize what I\u0027ve said. His eyes fixate on my lips until I look away.\n He grins at me, \"A person exactly like me. Listen, Anna - \" he reaches for my hand. When he brushes his fingers against it, I look up at him. He doesn\u0027t touch me for long. It\u0027s little things here and there. I look up at him, and he says, \"I think I\u0027m just telling you what you already know.\"\n His voice is soft, his eyes don\u0027t quite meet mine. Cole rubs his thumb against the back of my hand. I can\u0027t stop staring at it. My heart is pounding. I can\u0027t control how he makes me feel.\n \"Don\u0027t change for anyone. In the end, it\u0027s not worth it,\" he says and then grins again. \"Besides, depriving the world of Anna Lamore would be a sin. I\u0027d have to seriously punch this dude in the face.\"\n His words are so unexpected that I snort-laugh. It is one big honk. My hands fly to my mouth to hide it, but my face turns beet red anyway. Cole laughs, his eyes bright blue and shining. The warmth in his voice fills me up inside. The rich tones flow so easily, so confidently. I want what he has. I want to feel comfortable in my own skin.\n When our eyes lock, I wonder what he\u0027s thinking, what he sees when he looks at me. Previously, he\u0027s said I was a child, but his gaze now says otherwise. The intensity of his eyes makes me hot. A current runs through the center of my body. I can\u0027t look away. Cole leans closer until I feel his breath wash across my lips. Every inch of me is vibrating. I want him to touch me, to feel his palm against my face and taste his beautiful lips.\n My gaze drifts to his mouth. He blinks slowly, once, and I know he\u0027s going to pull away. Before he has the chance, I pretend that nothing happened, that I don\u0027t feel the attraction. I lean into his chest before he can say anything and rest my head against his shoulder.\n Surprise fills me when Cole\u0027s arms wrap around me, pulling me tight. We stay like that for a long time, each of us too afraid to move. This is the first time I know how much of an effect Cole Stevens has on me. It shakes me to my core. The dream blindsided me, and there\u0027s no stopping it.\n My body has reacted to him from day one, but I refused to acknowledge it.\n After a few moments, we pull apart. Cole lowers himself to the floor and I close my eyes and lean back on my pillow. I twist the blankets between my fingers. My heart thumps in my chest like I\u0027m startled. I am startled. I like him. I have a thing for Cole. Every muscle inside me cords tightly, my while fingers tug at the afghan in near panic. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-1.html","bookId":1876,"book":{"id":1876,"title":"Secrets Vol 2 Ella Steele (Secrets #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna\u0027s dreams.
