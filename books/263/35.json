{"id":7979,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS.","content":"OM WAITED patiently while the captain gave some directions to his subordinates. At length the robber made him a sign to draw near. “Now, youngster,” he said, “you may say what you wish.” Tom looked significantly at two of the band who were within hearing. “I should like to speak to you in private,” he said. The captain frowned slightly, and was on the point of refusing, but curiosity overcame him. “Very well,” he said. “Follow me.” They went a few rods away. “Now,” he said, “speak.” “What I have to say,” Tom begun, “is about those bonds.” “You wish to plead for your friend?” interrupted the captain. “If that is all, I will tell you to begin with, that it is of no use. I shall not give them up.” “You have made a mistake,” said Tom quietly. “In the first place, that man is not my friend.” “You were traveling together.” “That is true, but I only met him in San Francisco. I was following him to find out the very thing you helped me to discover to-day.” “What is that?” “Whether he had those papers.” “What have you to do with the papers?” demanded the captain, in surprise. “I will tell you, sir. For the want of these papers a New York merchant failed who owed me ten thousand dollars.” “Whew! I begin to see.” “This man—he calls himself Morton, but his real name is Lincoln—was Mr. Armstrong’s clerk. He appropriated these securities, worth about eighty thousand dollars, and fled. It was supposed, but not known, that he had come to California. I agreed to follow him and ascertain.” “It is rather strange that you, a boy, should have undertaken such a task. It is a man’s work.” “There was no one else to do it. I offered my services, and was accepted. I arrived in San Francisco three months since. I only met this man a few days ago.” “How did you know him?” “Mr. Armstrong gave me his description.” “Very good. Having found him, you followed him. What good did you think it would do? Supposing he had the papers, how did you expect to get hold of them?” “That I didn’t know. I had no plan,” Tom confessed frankly. “But if I were with him, some opportunity might offer. I set out in the hope of that.” “Does he have any suspicion of your motives in accompanying him?” “No, I am sure he does not. Perhaps if he knew my real name he would. But he thinks I am merely going to the mines in search of fortune.” “You did not know positively that he had these bonds?” “Not till you took them from him.” The robber paused for a moment’s reflection, then he fixed his eyes upon Tom. “Now, tell me,” he said abruptly, “what object you have in telling me all this?” “I want you to help me,” answered our hero boldly. The captain laughed. “Oho! you want me to give you these papers. My young friend, I gave you credit for more sense. Do you take me for a philanthropist?” “No,” said Tom, smiling. “I never should make such a mistake.” “Go on, then.” “I will make it worth your while to give me these bonds,” said Tom, with emphasis. “You! How can that be? I have taken all your money, except the few dollars I had the consideration to leave you. Of what other funds have you command?” “I represent Mr. Armstrong,” said Tom. “It is important that he should recover these securities. I am authorized to offer a large sum for them.” “But why should I let them go, when I can obtain their whole value.” “You can’t,” said Tom boldly. “Why not?” “For the same reason that they have been useless to the clerk who took them. They cannot be negotiated.” “Are you sure of that?” “I am. The authorities have an accurate list of them all. Information has also been sent to the different institutions and corporations represented. Whoever undertakes to raise money on them is liable to arrest.” “Are you sure of all this?” demanded the robber thoughtfully. “I am.” “You may be right. In fact, I have sufficient knowledge of business to believe that you are. I was not always what I am now. Years since I was engaged in business in St. Louis. I was unfortunate as so many are. I got into difficulties and made my way out here. Finally, getting desperate, I organized this band, and begun to prey upon the community.” He spoke slowly, and as if talking to himself. Tom listened with surprise and interest. He saw that even robber-captains have a human side, and are not altogether bad. “Do you like this kind of life?” asked our hero. The robber shrugged his shoulders. “A man must live,” he said. “I would rather be a prosperous merchant, but I must be satisfied with the mode of life that fortune has opened to me. But that is not to the point,” he said, changing his tone. “You said you had something for my advantage to propose. What is it?” “I will tell you. Give me up those bonds, give me the means of returning with them to New York, and you shall have ten thousand dollars as a reward.” “You speak confidently, but there are difficulties. How do I know that you will keep faith with me—a social outlaw? Once out of my clutches you will play me false.” “I shall keep my promise,” said Tom proudly. “I pledge you my word.” “But you may not be able to keep it. Show me your authority to make this bargain.” Tom drew a paper from his pocket-book—a paper of which we have not hitherto spoken—signed by Mr. Armstrong, empowering him to make such terms as he found necessary to secure the papers. “I should have made this offer to Morton,” he said in conclusion, “but the papers are no longer in his possession. I make them to you.” “I don’t see how I’m to receive the money, even if I consent. There is a reward offered for my arrest.” “I wish you could have gone to New York with me,” said Tom. “You could retain the papers until you were sure of the reward. I suppose that would be impossible.” The captain looked thoughtful. “This a matter of importance,” he said. “I will take a night to think it over. We will speak again on the subject to-morrow. Meanwhile keep your mouth shut.” “I will,” said Tom. He walked back to the house with his companion But he did not share the captivity of his fellow travelers. He was allowed to sleep and eat with the robbers, and to have his freedom. “He’s only a boy,” said the captain by way of explanation. “No need to shut him up.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3018/83458.html","bookId":263,"book":{"id":263,"title":"Tom Temple\u0027s Career","description":"简介： Some people might object to turning even a part of their dwellings into a business office, but then it saved rent, and Mr. Middleton was one of the saving kind.
