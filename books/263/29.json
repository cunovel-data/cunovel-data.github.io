{"id":7973,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX THE ABSCONDING CLERK.","content":"HE TWO customers did not notice Tom’s earnest look, nor his start of surprise, but asked to look at a miner’s outfit. Tom waited upon them, and listened eagerly, hoping to hear something that might confirm his suspicions. “Gates,” said the shorter of the two whom Tom suspected, “here’s something that will suit you.” “I don’t know but you are right, Morton,” was the response. “So his name is Morton,” thought Tom, with momentary disappointment. “But of course he would change his name,” he immediately reflected. “He must be Samuel Lincoln. The description tallies in every particular.” “Are you going to the mines?” he asked, feeling that the inquiry would create no suspicion. “Yes,” said Gates. “We are going to make our fortunes.” “Then you’d better take me along,” said Tom. “That’s exactly what I am after.” Gates laughed. “Do you want to go as private secretary?” he asked jestingly. “I don’t think my friend will want one, and I am sure I don’t.” “I can think of another position I would like,” said Tom. “What is that?” “Treasurer.” “Good!” said Gates, laughing. “I see you are sharp. But I’ll tell you what, young man, we are too sharp to employ you in that capacity. You might take a notion to leave us without warning.” “I see you don’t know me,” said Tom. “I am poor but honest.” “I’ve heard of that before,” said Gates. “There’s a good deal of humbug about that.” “Seriously, gentlemen,” said Tom, “I am anxious to go out to the gold-fields, and am able to pay my expenses there, but I haven’t any friends that are going. Would you mind my going along with you?” “Oh, come and welcome, if you’ll pay your own expenses,” said Gates. “What do you say, Morton?” “I don’t mind,” said Morton. “He won’t trouble us.” “Thank you,” said Tom. “When are you going to start?” “Day after to-morrow.” “I will be ready. Where shall I join you?” “We are stopping at the Hotel of California.” “I will come round there to-morrow night.” “All right. You will find us.” When this conversation was taking place Mr. Burton was out. After the strangers had retired he entered. “Mr. Burton,” said Tom, “I am going to surprise you.” “Not unpleasantly, I hope.” “I leave that to you to decide. I am going to leave your employment.” “Going to leave me! Have you received a better offer? If you have, I will advance your wages to the same point. I should be very sorry to lose you.” “I am glad to hear you say that, Mr. Burton, but I have received no better offer, nor am I dissatisfied with my wages.” “Then why do you wish to leave me?” demanded his employer in surprise. “I am going to the mines.” “Better think twice of that, Tom. Here you have a certainty and a comfortable living. There you will encounter hardship and privation, while the prospect of profitable returns for your labor is very uncertain.” “I know all that, sir, but I have a special object.” “What is it?” “I will tell you, sir, in confidence. I came to California in search of a clerk who ran away from New York with a large sum of money and securities.” “You—a boy of your age?” exclaimed Mr. Burton in astonishment. “Yes, sir.” “Who would employ so young a detective?” “I came at my own expense and on my own account. You will understand better when I tell you that this clerk caused the failure of a merchant who owed me ten thousand dollars. If the securities can be recovered he will be able to pay me dollar for dollar.” “This is a strange story, Tom.” “It is perfectly true, sir.” “What made you think the clerk was in California?” “I was not certain, but there were rumors that he had come here.” “Rumors are not very safe to rely upon.” “I know that, sir, but it seemed very probable, and I was willing to take the risk.” “I infer that you think you may find this clerk at the mines.” “Yes, sir. I know he is going out there.” “How do you know it?” asked Burton in fresh surprise. “Because he was in this store to-night, and said so in my presence.” “The absconding clerk was here to-night?” “Yes, sir. I recognized him at once from the description, though he had changed his name, and I had never met him. I learned that he was going to the mines with a companion, and I asked leave to join the party.” “Of course he has no idea who you are?” said Mr. Burton. “No, he never saw me, and had no ground of suspicion. But he might recognize my name, and so I am going to change it. I shall call myself Tom Lincoln.” “Why Lincoln?” “That is his real name.” “Won’t it lead him to suspect you?” “I think not. There are a good many Lincolns at the East. But I presume he will be a little startled when he first hears the name, and in fact that is the reason why I adopt it. I want to be perfectly sure that he is the man I am after.” “Tom, you appear to me to be shrewd enough to be a detective. I wish you success with all my heart. I am sorry to have you leave me, but of course I feel that I ought not to wish to detain you. When do you want to go?” “I shall have to make some preparations,” said Tom. “I should like to leave you at twelve to-morrow. I hope you won’t be troubled to fill my place.” “There’s a young fellow—a distant relation of my wife—who is anxious to obtain a position. I would rather have you, but if you insist upon leaving me, I will at any rate give him a trial. I will send for him to-morrow morning.” “That’s all right then,” said Tom with satisfaction. “I will ask you to give me a recommendation under the name of Lincoln, as it may come handy some day.” “I will do that with pleasure, Tom. How are you provided with money?” “I have nearly two hundred dollars, thanks to the hundred you gave me.” “That sum you richly deserved. I may as well say now that if you should fail in your project and return to San Francisco, you have only to come to me and I will find something for you to do.” “Thank you,” said Tom warmly. “I will remember that and your constant kindness to me.” “He’s a fine fellow,” thought Burton, “and as sharp as a steel-trap. I’m very sorry to lose him.” But Tom felt less regret. He had a boyish love of adventure, and he was about to play for a high stake. The mission which he had undertaken was one which required all his shrewdness to carry out successfully. Tom realized this, but he was resolved to do his best. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3018/83452.html","bookId":263,"book":{"id":263,"title":"Tom Temple\u0027s Career","description":"简介： Some people might object to turning even a part of their dwellings into a business office, but then it saved rent, and Mr. Middleton was one of the saving kind.
