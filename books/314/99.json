{"id":21073,"no":99,"title":"Chapter 99","content":"The first poon smacks into the belly of the chopper as they are coming in low over the Valley. Y.T. feels it rather than hears it; she knows that sweet impact so well that she can sense it like one of those supersensitive seismo-thingies that detects earthquakes on the other side of the planet. Then half a dozen other poons strike in quick succession, and she has to force herself not to lean over and look out the window. Of course. The chopper\u0027s belly is a solid wall of Soviet steel. It\u0027ll hold poons like glue. If they just keep flying low enough to poon -- which they have to, to keep the chopper under the Mafia\u0027s radar.\\n\\n She can hear the radio crackling up front. \"Take it up, Sasha, you\u0027re picking up some parasites.\"\\n\\n She looks out the window. The other chopper, the little aluminum corporate number, is flying alongside them, a little bit higher in the air, and all the people inside of it are peering out the windows, watching the pavement underneath them. Except for Raven. Raven is still goggled into the Metaverse. Shit. The pilot\u0027s pulling the chopper to a higher altitude.\\n\\n \"Okay, Sasha. You lost \u0027em,\" the radio says. \"But you still got a couple of them poon things hanging off your belly, so make sure you don\u0027t snag \u0027em on anything. The cables are stronger than steel.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s all Y.T. needs. She opens the door and jumps out of the chopper. At least that\u0027s how it looks to the people inside. Actually she grabs a handhold on her way down and ends up dangling from the swinging, open door, looking inward toward the belly of the chopper. A couple of poons are stuck to it; thirty feet below, she can see the handles dangling on the ends of their lines, fluttering in the airstream. Looking into the open door she can\u0027t hear Rife but she can see him, sitting there next to the pilot, motioning: Down, take it down!\\n\\n Which is what she figured. This hostage thing works two ways. She\u0027s no good to Rife unless he\u0027s got her, and she\u0027s in one piece.\\n\\n The chopper starts losing altitude again, heading back down toward the twin stripe of loglo that marks out the avenue beneath them. Y.T. gets swinging back and forth on the door a little, finally swings in far enough that she can hook one of the poon cables with her foot. This next bit is going to hurt like hell. But the tough fabric of the coverall should prevent her from losing too much skin. And the sight of Tony lunging at her, trying to grab her sleeve, reinforces her own natural tendency not to think about it too hard. She lets go of the chopper\u0027s door with one of her hands, grabs the poon cable, winds it around the outside of her glove a couple of times, then lets go with the other hand.\\n\\n She was right. It does hurt like hell. As she swings down under the belly of the chopper, out of Tony\u0027s grasp, something pops inside her hand -- probably one of those dinky little bones. But she gets the poon cable wrapped around her body the same way Raven did when he rappeled off the ship with her, and manages a controlled, burning slide down to the end. Down to the handle, that is. She hooks it onto her belt so she can\u0027t fall and then thrashes around for what seems like a whole minute until she\u0027s not tangled up in the cable anymore, just dangling by the waist, twisting around and around between the chopper and the street, out of control. Then she gets the handle in both hands and unhooks it from her belt so she\u0027s hanging by the arms again, which was the whole point of the exercise. As she rotates, she sees the other chopper above her and off to the side, glimpses the faces watching her, knows that all of this is being relayed, over the radio, to Rife.\\n\\n Sure enough. The chopper cuts to about half its former speed, loses some altitude.\\n\\n She clicks another control and reels out the line all the way to the end, dropping twenty feet in one thrill-packed moment. Now she\u0027s flying along, ten or fifteen feet above the highway, doing maybe forty-five miles an hour. The loglo signs shoot past her on either side like meteors. Other than a swarm of Kouriers, traffic is light. The RARE chopper comes thwacking in, dangerously close, and she looks up at it, just for an instant, and sees Raven looking at her through the window. He\u0027s pulled his goggles up on his forehead, just for a second. He\u0027s got a certain look on his face, and she realizes that he\u0027s not pissed at her at all. He loves her.\\n\\n She lets go of the handle and goes into free fall.\\n\\n At the same time, she jerks the manual release on her cervical collar and goes into full Michelin Man mode as tiny gas cartridges detonate in several strategic locations around her bod. The biggest one goes off like an M-80 at the nape of her neck, unfurling the coverall\u0027s collar into a cylindrical gasbag that shoots straight up and encases her entire head. Other airbags go off around her torso and her pelvis, paying lots of attention to that spinal column. Her joints are already protected by the armorgel.\\n\\n Which is not to say that it doesn\u0027t hurt when she lands. She can\u0027t see anything because of the airbag around her head, of course. But she feels herself bouncing at least ten times. She skids for a quarter of a mile and apparently caroms off several cars along the way; she can hear their tires squealing. Finally, she goes butt first through someone\u0027s windshield and ends up sprawled across their front seat; they veer into a Jersey barrier. The airbag deflates as soon as everything stops moving, and she claws it away from her face.\\n\\n Her ears are ringing or something. She can\u0027t hear anything. Maybe she busted her eardrums when the airbags went off.\\n\\n But there\u0027s also the question of the big chopper, which has a talent for making noise. She drags herself out onto the hood of the car, feeling little hunks of safety glass beneath her carving parallel scratches into the paint job. Rife\u0027s big Soviet chopper is right there, hovering about twenty feet above the avenue, and by the time she sees it, it has already accumulated a dozen more poons. Her eyes follow the cables down to street level, and she sees Kouriers straining at the lines; this time, they\u0027re not letting go.\\n\\n Rife gets suspicious, and the chopper gains altitude, lifting the Kouriers off their planks. But a passing double-bottom semi sheds a small army of Kouriers -- there must be a hundred of them pooned onto the poor thing -- and within a few seconds, all their MagnaPoons are airborne and at least half of them stick to the armor plating on the first try. The chopper lurches downward until all of the Kouriers are on the ground again. Twenty more Kouriers come flying in and nail it; those that can\u0027t, grab onto someone else\u0027s handle and add their weight. The chopper tries several times to rise, but it may as well be tethered to the asphalt by this point.\\n\\n It starts to come down. The Kouriers fan out away from it so that the chopper comes down in the middle of a radial burst of poon cables.\\n\\n Tony, the security guy, climbs down out of the open door, moving slowly, high-stepping his way through the web of cables but somehow retaining his balance and his dignity. He walks away from the chopper until he is out from under the rotor blades, then pulls an Uzi out from under his windbreaker and fires a short air burst.\\n\\n \"Get the fuck away from our chopper!\" he is shouting.\\n\\n The Kouriers, by and large, do. They\u0027re not stupid. And Y.T. is now walking around safe on the pavement, the mission is accomplished, the Code is finished, there\u0027s no reason to hassle these chopper dudes anymore. They detach their poons from the belly of the chopper and reel in the cables.\\n\\n Tony looks around and sees Y.T. She\u0027s walking directly toward the chopper. Her sprained body moves awkwardly.\\n\\n \"Get back in the chopper, you lucky bitch!\" he says.\\n\\n Y.T. picks up a loose poon handle that no one has bothered to reel in yet. She hits the button that turns off the electromagnet and its head drops off the chopper\u0027s armor. She reels it in until about four feet of slack is there between the reel and the head.\\n\\n \"There was this dude named Ahab that I read about,\" she says, whirling the poon around her head. \"He got his poon cable all wrapped up around the thing he was trying to poon. It was a big mistake.\"\\n\\n She lets the poon fly. It passes up through the plane of the rotor blades, near the Center, and she can see the unbreakable cable start to wind itself around the delicate parts of the rotor\u0027s axle, like a garrote around a ballerina\u0027s neck. Through the chopper\u0027s windshield she can see Sasha reacting, flipping switches frantically, pulling levers, his mouth making a long string of Russian curses. The poon\u0027s handle gets snapped out of her hand, and she sees it get whipped into the center like it\u0027s a black hole.\\n\\n \"I guess he just didn\u0027t know when to let go, like some people,\" she says. Then she turns around and walks away from the chopper. Behind her, she can hear large pieces of metal going the wrong way, running into one another at high speed. Rife has figured it out a long time ago. He\u0027s already running down the middle of the highway with a submachine gun in one hand, looking for a car to commandeer. Above, the RARE chopper hovers and watches; Rife looks up to it and motions forward with one hand, shouting, \"Go to LAX! Go to LAX!\"\\n\\n The chopper makes one last orbit over the scene, watching as Sasha puts the ruined gunship into cold shutdown, watching furious Kouriers overwhelming and disarming Tony and Frank and the President, watching as Rife stands in the middle of the left lane and forces a CosaNostra Pizza car to a stop, forces the driver out. But Raven isn\u0027t watching any of these things. He\u0027s looking out the window at Y.T. And as the chopper finally tilts forward and accelerates into the night, he grins at her and gives her the thumbs up. Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird. With that, the relationship is over, hopefully for all time.\\n\\n Y.T. borrows a plank from an awed skater and pushes herself across the street to the nearest Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly and starts trying to call Mom for a ride home.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/764.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
