{"id":21062,"no":88,"title":"Chapter 88","content":"It\u0027s all in the eyes. Along with picking handcuffs, vaulting Jersey barriers, and fending off perverts, it is one of the quintessential Kourier skills: walking around in a place where you don\u0027t belong without attracting suspicion. And you do it by not looking at anyone. Keep those eyes straight ahead no matter what, don\u0027t open them too wide, don\u0027t look tense. That, and the fact that she just came in here with a guy that everyone is scared of, gets her back through the containership to the reception area. \"I need to use a Street terminal,\" she says to the reception guy. \"Can you charge it to my room?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" the reception guy says. He doesn\u0027t have to ask which room she\u0027s in. He\u0027s all smiles, all respect. Not the kind of thing you get very often when you\u0027re a Kourier. She could really get to like this relationship with Raven, if it weren\u0027t for the fact that he\u0027s a homicidal mutant.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/753.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
