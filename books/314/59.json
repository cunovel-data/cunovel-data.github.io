{"id":21033,"no":59,"title":"Chapter 59","content":"Any ped can get into Griffith Park without being noticed. And Y.T. figures that despite the barriers across the road, the Falabala camp isn\u0027t too well protected, if you\u0027ve got off-road capability. For a skate ninja on a brand-new plank in a brand-new pair of Knight Visions (hey, you have to spend money to make money) there will be no problem. Just find a high embankment that ramps down into the canyon, skirt the edge until you see those campfires down below. And then lean down that hill. Trust gravity.\n She realizes halfway down that her blue-and-orange coverall, fly as it may be, is going to be a real attention getter in the middle of the night in the Falabala zone, so she reaches up to her collar, feels a hard disk sewn into the fabric, presses it between thumb and finger until it clicks. Her coverall darkens, the colors shimmer through the electropigment like an oil slick, and then it\u0027s black.\n On her first visit she didn\u0027t check this place out all that carefully because she hoped she\u0027d never come back. So the embankment turns out to be taller and steeper than Y.T. remembered. Maybe a little more of a cliff, drop-off, or abyss than she thought. Only thing that makes her think so is that she seems to be doing a lot of free-fall work here. Major plummeting. Big time ballistic styling. That\u0027s cool, it\u0027s all part of the job, she tells herself. The smartwheels are good for it. The tree trunks are bluish black, standing out not so well against a blackish blue background. The only other thing she can see is the red laser light of the digital speedometer down on the front of her plank, which is not showing any real information. The numbers have vibrated themselves into a cloud of gritty red light as the radar speed sensor tries to lock onto something.\n She turns the speedometer off. Running totally black now. Precipitating her way toward the sweet \u0027crete of the creek bottom like a black angel who has just had the shroud lines of her celestial parachute severed by the Almighty. And when the wheels finally meet the pavement, it just about drives her knees up through her jawbone. She finishes the whole gravitational transaction with not much altitude and a nasty head of dark velocity.\n Mental note: Next time just jump off a fucking bridge. That way there\u0027s no question of getting an invisible cholla shoved up your nose.\n She whips around a corner, heeled over so far she could lick the yellow line, and her Knight Visions reveal all in a blaze of multispectral radiation. On infrared, the Falabala encampment is a turbulating aurora of pink fog punctuated by the white-hot bursts of campfires. All of it rests on dim bluish pavement, which means, in the false-color scheme of things, that it\u0027s cold. Behind everything is the jagged horizon line of that funky improvised barrier technology that the Falabalas are so good at. A barrier that has been completely spumed, snubbed, and confounded by Y.T., who dropped out of the sky into the middle of the camp like a Stealth fighter with an inferiority complex. Once you\u0027re into the actual encampment, people don\u0027t really notice or care who you are. A couple people see her, watch her slide on by, don\u0027t get all hairy about it. They probably get a lot of Kouriers coming through here. A lot of dippy, gullible, Kool-Aid drinking couriers. And these people aren\u0027t hip enough to tell Y.T. apart from that breed. But that\u0027s okay, she\u0027ll pass for now, as long as they don\u0027t check out the detailing on her new plank.\n The campfires provide enough plain old regular visible light to show this sorry affair for what it is: a bunch of demented Boy Scouts, a jamboree without merit badges or hygiene. With the IR supered on top of the visible, she can also see vague, spectral red faces out in the shadows where her unassisted eyes would only see darkness. These new Knight Visions cost her a big wad of her Mob drug-running money. Just the kind of thing Mom had in mind when she insisted Y.T. get a part-time job.\n Some of the people who were here last time are gone now, and there\u0027s a few new ones she doesn\u0027t recognize. There\u0027s a couple of people actually wearing duct-tape straitjackets. That\u0027s a fashion statement reserved for the ones who are totally out of control, rolling and thrashing around on the ground. And there\u0027s a few more who are spazzing out, but not as bad, and one or two who are just plain messed up, like plain old derelicts that you might see at the Snooze \u0027n\u0027 Cruise.\n \"Hey, look!\" someone says. \"It\u0027s our friend the Kourier! Welcome, friend!\" She\u0027s got her Liquid Knuckles uncapped, available, and shaken well before use. She\u0027s got high-voltage, high-fashion metallic cuffs around her wrists in case someone tries to grab her by same. And a bundy stunner up her sleeve. Only the most tubular throwbacks carry guns. Guns take a long time to work (you have to wait for the victim to bleed to death), but paradoxically they end up killing people pretty often. But nobody hassles you after you\u0027ve hit them with a bundy stunner. At least that\u0027s what the ads say.\n So it\u0027s not like she exactly feels vulnerable or anything. But still, she\u0027d like to pick her target. So she maintains escape velocity until she\u0027s found the woman who seemed friendly -- the bald chick in the torn-up Chanel knockoff -- and then zeroes in on her.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/724.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
