{"id":21045,"no":71,"title":"Chapter 71","content":"Earth is still where he left it, zoomed in to show a magnified view of the Raft. In the light of last night\u0027s chat with Chuck Wrightson, it\u0027s not hard to find the hunk of raft that was staked out by the Orthos when the Enterprise swung by TROKK a few weeks back. There\u0027s a couple of big-assed Soviet freighters tied together, a swarm of small boats around them. Most of the Raft is dead brown and organic, but this section is all white fiberglass: pleasure craft looted from the comfortable retirees of TROKK. Thousands of them. Now the Raft is off Port Sherman, so, Hiro figures that\u0027s where the high priests of Asherah are hanging out. In a few days, they\u0027ll be in Eureka, then San Francisco, then L.A. -- a floating land link, tying the Orthos\u0027 operations on the Raft to the closest available point on the mainland. He turns away from the Raft, skims across the ocean to Port Sherman to do a bit of reconnoitering there. Down along the waterfront, there\u0027s a nice crescent of cheap motels with yellow logos. Hiro rifles through them, looking for Russian names. That\u0027s easy. There\u0027s a Spectrum 2000 right in the middle of the waterfront. As the name implies, each one has a whole range of rooms, from human coin lockers in the lobby all the way to luxury suites on the top. And a whole range of rooms has been rented out by a bunch of people with names ending in -off and -ovski and other dead Slavic giveaways. The foot soldiers sleep in the lobby, laid out straight and narrow in coin lockers next to their AK-47s, and the priests and generals live in nice rooms higher up. Hiro pauses to wonder what a Pentecostal Russian Orthodox priest does with a Magic Fingers. The suite on the very top is being rented out by a gentleman by the name of Gurov. Mr.KGB himself. Too much of a wimp to hang out on the actual Raft, apparently. How\u0027d he get from the Raft to Port Sherman? If it involves crossing a couple of hundred miles of North Pacific, it must be a decent-sized vessel. There are half a dozen marinas in Port Sherman. At the moment, most of them are clogged with small brown boats. It looks like a post-typhoon situation, where a few hundred square miles of ocean have been swept clean of sampans that have piled up against the nearest hard place. Except this is slightly more organized than that The Refus are coming ashore already. If they\u0027re smart, and aggressive, they probably know that they can walk to California from here. That explains why the piers are clogged with trashy little boats. But one of them still looks like a private marina. It\u0027s got a dozen or so clean white vessels, lined up neatly in their slips, no riffraff. And the resolution of this image is good enough that Hiro can see the pier speckled with little doughnuts: probably rings of sandbags. That\u0027d be the only way to keep your private moorage private when the Raft was hovering offshore. The numbers, flags, and other identifying goodies are harder to make out. The satellite has a hard time picking that stuff out. Hiro checks to see whether CIC has a stringer in Port Sherman. They have to, because the Raft is here, and CIC hopes to make a big business out of selling Raft intelligence to all the anxious waterfronters between Skagway and Tierra del Fuego. Indeed. There are a few people hanging out in this town, uploading the latest Port Sherman intel. And one of them is just a punter with a video camera who goes around shooting pictures of everything. Hiro reviews this stuff in fast-forward. A lot of it is shot from the stringer\u0027s hotel window: hours and hours of coverage of the stream of shitty little brown boats laboring their way up the harbor, tying up to the edge of the mini-Raft that\u0027s forming in front of Port Sherman. But it\u0027s semi-organized, in that some apparently self-appointed water cops are buzzing around in a speedboat, aiming guns at people, shouting through a megaphone. And that explains why, no matter how tangled the mess in the harbor becomes, there\u0027s always a clear lane down the middle of the fjord, headed out to sea. And the terminus of that clear lane is the nice pier with the big boats. There are two big vessels there. One is a large fishing boat flying a flag bearing the emblem of the Orthos, which is just a cross and a flame. It is obvious TROKK loot; the name on the stern is KODIAK QUEEN, and the Orthos haven\u0027t bothered to change it yet. The other large boat is a small cruise vessel, made to carry rich people comfortably to nice places. It has a green flag and appears to be connected with Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong. Hiro does a little more poking around in the streets of Port Sherman and finds out that there is a pretty good-sized Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong franchulate here. In typical Hong Kong style, it is more of a spray of small buildings and rooms all over town. But it\u0027s a dense spray. Dense enough that Hong Kong has several full-time employees here, including a proconsul. Hiro pulls up the guy\u0027s picture so he\u0027ll recognize him: a crusty-looking Chinese-American gent in his fifties. So it\u0027s not an automated, unmanned franchulate like you normally see in the Lower 48.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/736.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
