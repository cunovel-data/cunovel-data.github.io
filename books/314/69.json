{"id":21043,"no":69,"title":"Chapter 69","content":"Y.T. has been to some unusual places in her career. She has the visas of some three dozen countries laminated onto her chest. And on top of the real countries she has picked up and/or delivered to such charming little vacation spots as the Terminal Island Sacrifice Zone and the encampment in Griffith Park. But the weirdest job of all is this new one: someone wants her to deliver some stuff to the United States of America. Says so right there on the job order.\\n\\n It\u0027s not much of a delivery, just a legal-size envelope.\\n\\n \"You sure you don\u0027t just want to mail this?\" she asks the guy when she picks it up. It\u0027s one of these creepy office parks out in the Burbs. Like a Burbclave for worthless businesses that have offices and phones and stuff but don\u0027t actually seem to do anything.\\n\\n It\u0027s a sarcastic question, of course. The mail doesn\u0027t work, except in Fedland. All the mailboxes have been unbolted and used to decorate the apartments of nostalgia freaks. But it\u0027s also kind of a joke, because the destination is, in fact, a building in the middle of Fedland. So the joke is: If you want to deal with the Feds, why not use their fucked-up mail system? Aren\u0027t you afraid that by dealing with anything as incredibly cool as a Kourier you will be tainted in their eyes?\\n\\n \"Well, uh, the mail doesn\u0027t come out here, does it?\" the guy says.\\n\\n No point in describing the office. No point in even allowing the office to even register on her eyeballs and take up valuable memory space in her brain. Fluorescent lights and partitions with carpet glued to them. I prefer my carpet on the floor, thank you. A color scheme. Ergonomic shit. Chicks with lipstick. Xerox smell. Everything\u0027s pretty new, she figures.\\n\\n The legal envelope is resting on the guy\u0027s desk. Not much point in describing him, either. Traces of a southern or Texan accent. The bottom edge of the envelope is parallel to the edge of the desk, one-quarter inch away from it, perfectly centered between the left and right sides. Like he had a doctor come in here and put it on the desk with tweezers. It is addressed to: ROOM 968A, MAIL STOP MS-1569835, BUILDING LA-6, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\\n\\n \"You want a return address on this?\" she says.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not necessary.\"\\n\\n \"If I can\u0027t deliver it, there\u0027s no way I can get it back to you, because these places all look the same to me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not important,\" he says. \"When do you think you\u0027ll get it there?\"\\n\\n \"Two hours max.\"\\n\\n \"Why so long?\"\\n\\n \"Customs, man. The Feds haven\u0027t modernized their system like everyone else.\" Which is why most Kouriers will do anything to avoid delivering to Fedland. But it\u0027s a slow day today, Y.T. hasn\u0027t been called in to do any secret missions for the Mafia yet, and maybe she can catch Mom on her lunch break.\\n\\n \"And your name is?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t give out our names.\"\\n\\n \"I need to know who\u0027s delivering this.\"\\n\\n \"Why? You said it wasn\u0027t important.\"\\n\\n The guy gets really flustered. \"Okay,\" he says. \"Forget it. Just deliver it, please.\"\\n\\n Okay, be that way, she mentally says. She mentally says a number of other things, too. The man is an obvious pervert. It\u0027s so plain, so open: \"And your name is?\" Give me a break, man.\\n\\n Names are unimportant. Everyone knows Kouriers are interchangeable parts. It\u0027s just that some happen to be a lot faster and better.\\n\\n So she skates out of the office. It\u0027s all very anonymous. No Corporate logos anywhere. So as she\u0027s waiting for the elevator, she calls RadiKS, tries to find out who initiated this call.\\n\\n The answer comes back a few minutes later, as she\u0027s riding out of the office park, pooned onto a nice Mercedes: Rife Advanced Research Enterprises. RARE. One of these high-tech outfits. Probably trying to get a government contract. Probably trying to sell sphygmomanometers to the Feds or something like that. Oh well, she just delivers \u0027em. She gets the impression that this Mercedes is sandbagging -- driving real slow so she\u0027ll poon something else -- so she poons something else, an outgoing delivery truck. Judging from the way it\u0027s riding high on its springs, it must be empty, so it\u0027ll probably move along pretty fast.\\n\\n Ten seconds later, predictably, the Mercedes blasts by in the left lane, so she poons that and rides it nice and hard for a couple of miles.\\n\\n Getting into Fedland is a drag. Most Fedsters drive tiny, plastic and aluminum cars that are hard to poon. But eventually she nails one, a little jellybean with glued-on windows and a three-cylinder engine, and that takes her up to the United States border.\\n\\n The smaller this country gets, the more paranoid they become. Nowadays, the customs people are just impossible. She has to sign a ten-page document -- and they actually make her read it. They say it should take at least half an hour for her just to read the thing.\\n\\n \"But I read it two weeks ago.\"\\n\\n \"It might have changed,\" the guard says, \"so you have to read it again.\"\\n\\n Basically, it just certifies that Y.T. is not a terrorist, Communist (whatever that is), homosexual, national-symbol desecrator, pornography merchant, welfare parasite, racially insensitive, carrier of any infectious disease, or advocate of any ideology tending to impugn traditional family values. Most of it is just definitions of all the words used on the first page.\\n\\n So Y.T. sits in the little room for half an hour, doing housekeeping work -- going over her stuff, changing batteries in all her little devices, cleaning her nails, having her skateboard run its self-maintenance procedures. Then she signs the fucking document and hands it over to the guy. And then she\u0027s in Fedland. It\u0027s not hard finding the place. Typical Fed building -- a million steps. Like it\u0027s built on top of a mountain of steps. Columns. A lot more guys in this one than usual. Chunky guys with slippery hair. Must be some kind of cop building. The guard at the front door is a cop all the way, wants to give her a big hassle about carrying her skateboard into the place. Like they\u0027ve got a safe place out front to keep skateboards.\\n\\n The cop guy is completely hard to deal with. But that\u0027s okay, so is Y.T.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the envelope,\" she says. \"You can take it up to the ninth floor yourself on your coffee break. Too bad you have to take the stairs.\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" he says, totally exasperated, \"this is EBGOC. This is, like, the headquarters. EBGOC central. You got that? Everything that happens within a mile is being videotaped. People don\u0027t spit on the pavement within sight of this building. They don\u0027t even say bad words. Nobody\u0027s going to steal your skateboard.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s even worse. They\u0027ll steal it. Then they\u0027ll say they didn\u0027t steal it, they confiscated it. I know you Feds, you\u0027re always confiscating shit.\"\\n\\n The guy sighs. Then his eyes go out of focus and he shuts up for a minute. Y.T. can tell he\u0027s getting a message over the little earphone that\u0027s plugged into his ear, the mark of the true Fed.\\n\\n \"Go on in,\" he says. \"But you gotta sign.\"\\n\\n \"Naturally,\" Y.T. says.\\n\\n The cop hands her the sign-in sheet, which is actually a notebook computer with an electronic pen. She writes \"Y.T.\" on the screen, it\u0027s converted to a digital bitmap, automatically time stamped, and sent off to the big computer at Fed Central. She knows she\u0027s not going to make it through the metal detector without stripping naked, so she just vaults the cop\u0027s table -- what\u0027s he going to do, shoot her? -- and heads on into the building, skateboard under her arm.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" he says, weakly.\\n\\n \"What, you got lots of EBGOC agents in here being mugged and raped by female Kouriers?\" she says, stomping the elevator button ferociously.\\n\\n Elevator takes forever. She loses her patience and just climbs the stairs like all the other Feds. The guy is right, it\u0027s definitely Cop Central here on the ninth floor. Every creepy guy in sunglasses and slippery hair you\u0027ve ever seen, they\u0027re all here, all with little fleshtone helices of wire trailing down from their ears. There\u0027s even some female Feds. They look even scarier than the guys. The things that a woman can do to her hair to make herself look professional -- Jeeezus! Why not just wear a motorcycle helmet? At least then you can take it off.\\n\\n Except none of the Feds, male or female, is wearing sun-glasses. They look naked without them. Might as well be walking around with no pants on. Seeing these Feds without their mirror specs is like blundering into the boys\u0027 locker room.\\n\\n She finds Room 968A easily enough. Most of the floor is just a big pool of desks. All the actual, numbered rooms are around the edges, with frosted glass doors. Each of the creepy guys seems to have a desk of his own, some of them loiter near their desks, the rest of them are doing a lot of hall-jogging and impromptu conferencing at other creepy guys\u0027 desks. Their white shirts are painfully clean. Not as many shoulder holsters as she would expect; all the gun-carrying Feds are probably out in what used to be Alabama or Chicago trying to confiscate back bits of United States territory from what is now a Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly or a toxic-waste dump.\\n\\n She goes on into Room 968A. It\u0027s an office. Four Fed guys are in here, the same as the others except most of them are a tad older, in their forties and fifties.\\n\\n \"Got a delivery for this room,\" Y.T. says.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re Y.T.?\" says the head Fed, who\u0027s sitting behind the desk.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not supposed to know my name,\" Y.T. says. \"How did you know my name?\"\\n\\n \"I recognized you,\" the head Fed says. \"I know your mother.\" Y.T. does not believe him. But these Feds have all kinds of ways of finding out stuff.\\n\\n \"Do you have any relatives in Afghanistan?\" she says.\\n\\n The guys all look back and forth at each other, like, did you understand the chick? But it\u0027s not a sentence that is intended to be understood. Actually, Y.T. has all kinds of voice recognition ware in her coverall and in her plank. When she says, \"Do you have any relatives in Afghanistan?\" that\u0027s like a code phrase, it tells all of her spook gear to get ready, shake itself down, check itself out, prick up its electronic ears.\\n\\n \"You want this envelope or not?\" she says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take it,\" the head Fed says, standing up and holding out one hand.\\n\\n Y.T. walks into the middle of the room and hands him the envelope. But instead of taking it, he lunges out at the last minute and grabs her forearm.\\n\\n She sees an open handcuff in his other hand. He brings it out and snaps it down on her wrist so it tightens and locks shut over the cuff of her coverall.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to do this, Y.T., but I have to place you under arrest,\" he\u0027s saying.\\n\\n \"What the fuck are you doing?\" Y.T. is saying. She\u0027s holding her free arm back away from the desk so he can\u0027t cuff her wrists together, but one of the other Feds grabs her by the free wrist, so now she\u0027s stretched out like a tightrope between the two big Feds.\\n\\n \"You guys are dead,\" she says.\\n\\n All the guys smile, like they enjoy a chick with some spunk.\\n\\n \"You guys are dead,\" she says a second time.\\n\\n This is the key phrase that all of her ware is waiting to hear. When she says it the second time, all the self-defense stuff comes on, which means that among other things, a few thousand volts of radio-frequency electrical power suddenly flood through the outsides of her cuffs.\\n\\n The head Fed behind the desk blurts out a grunt from way down in his stomach. He flies back away from her, his entire right side jerking spastically, trips over his own chair, and sprawls back into the wall, smacking his head on the marble windowsill. The jerk who\u0027s yanking on her other arm stretches out like he\u0027s on an invisible rack, accidentally slapping one of the other guys in the face, giving that guy a nice dose of juice to the head. Both of them hit the floor like a sack of rabid cats. There\u0027s only one of these guys left, and he\u0027s reaching under his jacket for something. She takes one step toward him, swings her arm around, and the end of the loose manacle strokes him in the neck. Just a caress, but it might as well be a two-handed blow from Satan\u0027s electric ax handle. That funky juice runs all up and down his spine, and suddenly, he\u0027s sprawled across a couple of shitty old wooden chairs and his pistol is rotating on the floor like the spinner in a children\u0027s game.\\n\\n She flexes her wrist in a particular way, and the bundy stunner drops down her sleeve and into her hand. The manacle swinging from the other hand will have a similar effect on that side. She also pulls out the can of Liquid Knuckles, pops the lid, sets the spray nozzle on wide angle.\\n\\n One of the Fed creeps is nice enough to open the office door for her. He comes into the room with his gun already drawn, backed up by half a dozen other guys who\u0027ve flocked here from the office pool, and she just lets them have it with the Liquid Knuckles. Whoosh, it\u0027s like bug spray. The sound of bodies hitting the floor is like a bass drum roll. She finds that her skateboard has no problem rolling across their prone bodies, and then she\u0027s out into the office pool. These guys are converging from all sides, there\u0027s an incredible number of them, she just keeps holding that button down, pointed straight ahead, digging at the floor with her foot, building up speed. The Liquid Knuckles acts like a chemical flying wedge, she\u0027s skating out of there on a carpet of bodies. Some of the Feds are agile enough to dart in from behind and try to get her that way, but she\u0027s ready with the bundy stunner, which turns their nervous systems into coils of hot barbed wire for a few minutes but isn\u0027t supposed to have any other effects.\\n\\n She\u0027s made it about three-quarters of the way across the office when the Liquid Knuckles runs out. But it still works for a second or two because people are afraid of it, keep diving out of the way even though there\u0027s nothing coming out. Then a couple of them figure it out, make the mistake of trying to grab her by the wrists. She gets one of them with the bundy stunner and the other with the electric manacle. Then boom through the door and she\u0027s out into the stairwell, leaving four dozen casualties in her wake. Serves them right, they didn\u0027t even try to arrest her in a gentlemanly way.\\n\\n To a man on foot, stairs are a hindrance. But to the smartwheels, they just look like a forty-five-degree angle ramp. It\u0027s a little choppy, especially when she\u0027s down to about the second floor and is going way too fast, but it\u0027s definitely doable.\\n\\n A lucky thing: One of the first-floor cops is just opening the stairwell door, no doubt alerted by the symphony of alarm bells and buzzers that has begun to merge into a solid wall of hysterical sound. She blows by the guy; he puts one arm out in an attempt to stop her, sort of belts her across the waist in the process, throws her balance off, but this is a very forgiving skateboard, it\u0027s smart enough to slow down for her a little bit when her center of mass gets into the wrong place. Pretty soon it\u0027s back under her, she\u0027s banking radically through the elevator lobby, aiming dead center for the arch of the metal detector, through which the bright outdoor light of freedom is shining. Her old buddy the cop is up on his feet, and he reacts fast enough to spread-eagle himself across the metal detector. Y.T. acts like she\u0027s heading right for him, then kicks the board sideways at the last minute, punches one of the toe switches, coils her legs underneath her, and jumps into the air. She flies right over his little table while the plank is rolling underneath it, and a second later she lands on it, wobbles once, gets her balance back. She\u0027s in the lobby, headed for the doors.\\n\\n It\u0027s an old building. Most of the doors are metal. But there\u0027s a couple of revolving doors, too, just big sheets of glass.\\n\\n Early thrashers used to inadvertently skate into walls of glass from time to time, which was a problem. It turned into a bigger problem when the whole Kourier thing got started and thrashers started spending a lot more time trying to go fast through office-type environments where glass walls are considered quite the concept. Which is why on an expensive skateboard, like this one definitely is, you can get, as an extra added safety feature, the RadiKS Narrow Cone Tuned Shock Wave Projector. It works on real short notice, which is good, but you can only use it once (it draws its power from an explosive charge), and then you have to take your plank into the shop to have it replaced.\\n\\n It\u0027s an emergency thing. Strictly a panic button. But that\u0027s cool. Y.T. makes sure she\u0027s aimed directly at the glass revolving doors, then hits the appropriate toe switch.\\n\\n It\u0027s -- my God -- like you stretched a tarp across a stadium to turn it into a giant tom-tom and then crashed a 747 into it. She can feel her internal organs move several inches. Her heart trades places with her liver. The bottoms of her feet feel numb and tingly. And she\u0027s not even standing in the path of the shock wave.\\n\\n The safety glass in the revolving doors doesn\u0027t just crack and fall to the floor, like she imagined it would. It is blown out of its moorings. It gushes out of the building and down the front steps. She follows, an instant later.\\n\\n The ridiculous cascade of white marble steps on the front of the building just gives her more ramp time. By the time she reaches the sidewalk, she\u0027s easily got enough speed to coast all the way to Mexico. As she\u0027s swinging out across the broad avenue, aiming her crosshairs at the customs post a quarter mile away, which she is going to have to jump over, something tells her to look up.\\n\\n Because after all, the building she just escaped from is towering above her, many stories full of Fed creeps, and all the alarms are going off. Most of the windows can\u0027t be opened, all they can do is look out. But there are people on the roof. Mostly the roof is a forest of antennas. If it\u0027s a forest, these guys are the creepy little gnomes who live in the trees. They are ready for action, they have their sunglasses on, they have weapons, they\u0027re all looking at her.\\n\\n But only one guy\u0027s taking aim. And the thing he\u0027s aiming at her is huge. The barrel is the size of a baseball bat. She can see the muzzle flash poke out of it, wreathed in a sudden doughnut of white smoke. It\u0027s not pointed right at her; it\u0027s aimed in front of her.\\n\\n The stun bunny lands on the street, dead ahead, bounces up in the air, and detonates at an altitude of twenty feet.\\n\\n The next quarter of a second: There\u0027s no bright flash to blind her, and so she can actually see the shock wave spreading outward in a perfect sphere, hard and palpable as a ball of ice. Where the sphere contacts the street, it makes a circular wave front, making pebbles bounce, flipping old McDonald\u0027s containers that have long been smashed flat, and coaxing fine, flourlike dust out of all the tiny crevices in the pavement, so that it sweeps across the road toward her like a microscopic blizzard. Above it, the shock wave hangs in the air, rushing toward her at the speed of sound, a lens of air that flattens and refracts everything on the other side. She\u0027s passing through it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/734.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
