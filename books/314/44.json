They cruise up the middle of Beachwood Canyon, headed straight for the Hollywood sign.\\n\\n Da5id\u0027s house has been transfigured by light. It\u0027s at the end of its own little road, at the summit of a hill. The road has been blocked off by a squat froglike Jeep-thing from General Jim\u0027s, saturated red and blue light sweeping and pulsing out of it. Another helicopter is above the house, supported on a swirling column of radiance. Soldiers creep up and down the property, carrying hand-held searchlights.\\n\\n \"We took the precaution of securing the area,\" Major Clem says.\\n\\n At the fringes of all this light, Hiro can see the dead organic colors of the hillside. The soldiers are trying to push it back with their searchlights, trying to bum it away. He is about to bury himself in it, become a single muddy pixel in some airline passenger\u0027s window. Plunging into the biomass.\\n\\n Da5id\u0027s laptop is on the floor next to the table where he liked to work. It is surrounded by medical debris. In the middle of this, Hiro finds Da5id\u0027s goggles, which either fell off when he hit the floor, or were stripped off by the paramedics.\\n\\n Hiro picks up the goggles. As he brings them up toward his eyes, he sees the image: a wall of black-and-white static. Da5id\u0027s computer has snow-crashed. He closes his eyes and drops the goggles. You can\u0027t get hurt by looking at a bitmap. Or can you?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/709.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
