{"id":21036,"no":62,"title":"Chapter 62","content":"Earth materializes, rotating majestically in front of his face. Hiro reaches out and grabs it. He twists it around so he\u0027s looking at Oregon. Tells it to get rid of the clouds, and it does, giving him a crystalline view of the mountains and the seashore.\\n\\n Right out there, a couple of hundred miles off the Oregon coast, is a sort of granulated furuncle growing on the face of the water. Festering is not too strong a word. It\u0027s a couple of hundred miles south of Astoria now, moving south. Which explains why Juanita went to Astoria a couple of days ago: she wanted to get close to the Raft. Why is anyone\u0027s guess.\\n\\n Hiro looks up, focuses his gaze on Earth, zooms in for a look. As he gets closer, the imagery he\u0027s looking at shifts from the long-range pictures coming in from the geosynchronous satellites to the good stuff being spewed into the CIC computer from a whole fleet of low-flying spy birds. The view he\u0027s looking at is a mosaic of images shot no more than a few hours ago.\\n\\n It\u0027s several miles across. Its shape constantly changes, but at the time these pictures were shot, it had kind of a fat kidney shape; that is, it is trying to be a V, pointed southward like a flock of geese, but there\u0027s so much noise in the system, it\u0027s so amorphous and disorganized, that a kidney is the closest it can come.\\n\\n At the center is a pair of enormous vessels: the Enterprise and an oil tanker, lashed together side by side. These two behemoths are walled in by several other major vessels, an assortment of container ships and other freight carriers. The Core.\\n\\n Everything else is pretty tiny. There is the occasional hijacked yacht or decommissioned fishing trawler. But most of the boats in the Raft are just that: boats. Small pleasure craft, sampans, junks, dhows, dinghys, life rafts, houseboats, makeshift structures built on air-filled oil drums and slabs of styrofoam. A good fifty percent of it isn\u0027t real boat material at all, just a garble of ropes, cables, planks, nets, and other debris tied together on top of whatever kind of flotsam was handy.\\n\\n And L. Bob Rife is sitting in the middle of it. Hiro doesn\u0027t quite know what he\u0027s doing, and he doesn\u0027t know how Juanita is connected. But it\u0027s time to go there and find out.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/727.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
