{"id":21035,"no":61,"title":"Chapter 61","content":"Y.T. pumps herself up out of the canyon so fast that when she flies out into traffic, she\u0027s going about as fast as it is. As soon as she gets a solid poon on a nocturnal lettuce tanker, she gets on the phone to Mom.\n \"Mom, listen. No, Mom, never mind the roaring noise. Yes, I am riding my skateboard in traffic. But listen to me for a second, Mom -- \"\n She has to hang up on the old bitch. It\u0027s impossible to talk to her. Then she tries to make a voice linkup with Hiro. That takes a couple of minutes to go through.\n \"Hello! Hello! Hello!\" she\u0027s shouting. Then she hears the honk of a car horn. Coming out of the telephone.\n \"Hello?\"\n \"It\u0027s Y.T.\"\n \"How are you doing?\" This guy always seems a little too laid back in his personal dealings. She doesn\u0027t really want to talk about how she\u0027s doing. She hears another honking horn in the background, behind Hiro\u0027s voice.\n \"Where the hell are you, Hiro?\"\n \"Walking down a street in L.A.\"\n \"How can you be goggled in if you\u0027re walking down a street?\" Then the terrible reality sinks in: \"Oh, my God, you didn\u0027t turn into a gargoyle, did you?\"\n \"Well,\" Hiro says. He is hesitant, embarrassed, like it hadn\u0027t occurred to him yet that this was what he was doing. \"It\u0027s not exactly like being a gargoyle. Remember when you gave me shit about spending all my money on computer stuff?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"I decided I wasn\u0027t spending enough. So I got a beltpack machine. Smallest ever made, I\u0027m walking down the street with this thing strapped to my belly. It\u0027s really cool.\"\n \"You\u0027re a gargoyle.\"\n \"Yeah, but it\u0027s not like having all this clunky shit strapped all over your body ... \u0027\n \"You\u0027re a gargoyle. Listen, I talked to one of these wholesalers.\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"She says she used to be a hacker. She saw something strange on her computer. Then she got sick for a while and joined this cult and ended up on the Raft.\"\n \"The Raft. Do tell,\" he says.\n \"On the Enterprise. They take their blood, Hiro. Suck it out of their bodies. They infect people by injecting them with the blood of sick hackers. And when their veins get all tracked out like a junkie\u0027s, they cut them loose and put them to work on the mainland running the wholesale operation.\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" he says. \"That\u0027s good stuff.\"\n \"She says she saw some static on her computer screen and it made her sick. You know anything about that?\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s true.\"\n \"It\u0027s true?\"\n \"Yeah. But you don\u0027t have to worry about it. It only affects hackers.\"\n For a minute she can\u0027t even speak, she\u0027s so pissed. \"My mother is a programmer for the Feds. You asshole. Why didn\u0027t you warn me?\"\n Half an hour later, she\u0027s there. Doesn\u0027t bother to change back into her WASP disguise this time, just bursts into the house in basic, bad black. Drops her plank on the floor on the way in. Grabs one of Mom\u0027s curios off the shelf -- it\u0027s a heavy crystal award -- clear plastic, actually -- that she got a couple years ago for sucking up to her Fed boss and passing all her polygraph tests -- and goes into the den.\n Mom\u0027s there. As usual. Working on her computer. But she\u0027s not looking at the screen right now, she\u0027s got some notes on her lap that she\u0027s going through. Just as Mom is looking up at her, Y.T. winds up and throws the crystal award. It goes right over Mom\u0027s shoulder, glances off the computer table, flies right through the picture tube. Awesome results. Y.T. always wanted to do that. She pauses to admire her work for a few seconds while Mom just flames off all kinds of weird emotion. What are you doing in that uniform? Didn\u0027t I tell you not to ride your skateboard on a real street? You\u0027re not supposed to throw things in the house. That\u0027s my prized possession. Why did you break the computer? Government property. Just what is going on here, anyway?\n Y.T. can tell that this is going to continue for a couple of minutes, so she goes to the kitchen, splashes some water on her face, gets a glass of juice, just letting Mom follow her around and ventilate over her shoulder pads. Finally Mom winds down, defeated by Y.T.\u0027s strategy of silence.\n \"I just saved your fucking life, Mom,\" Y.T. says. \"You could at least offer me an Oreo.\"\n \"What on earth are you talking about?\"\n \"It\u0027s like, if you -- people of a certain age -- would make some effort to just stay in touch with sort of basic, modern-day events, then your kids wouldn\u0027t have to take these drastic measures.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/726.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
