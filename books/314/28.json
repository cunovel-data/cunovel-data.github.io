All a part of the aesthetic. When the music stops, their set is over. For the first time, Hiro can hear the exaltation of the crowd. It\u0027s a blast of high-pitched noise that he feels in his head, ringing his ears.\\n\\n But there\u0027s a low thudding sound, too, like someone pummeling a bass drum, and for a minute he thinks maybe it\u0027s a truck rolling by on the overpass above them. But it\u0027s too steady for that, it doesn\u0027t die away.\\n\\n It\u0027s behind him. Other people have noticed it, turned to look toward the sound, are scurrying out of the way. Hiro sidesteps, turning to see what it is.\\n\\n Big and black, to begin with. It does not seem as though such a large man could perch on a motorcycle, even a big chortling Harley like this one.\\n\\n Correction. It\u0027s a Harley with some kind of a sidecar added a sleek black projectile hanging off to the right, supported on its own wheel. But no one is sitting in the sidecar.\\n\\n It does not seem as though a man could be this bulky without being fat. But he\u0027s not fat at all, he\u0027s wearing tight stretchy clothes -- like leather, but not quite -- that show bones and muscles, but nothing else.\\n\\n He is riding the Harley so slowly that he would certainly fall over if not for the sidecar. Occasionally he gooses it forward with a flick of the fingers on his clutch hand.\\n\\n Maybe one reason he looks so big -- other than the fact that he really *is* big -- is the fact that he appears totally neckless. His head starts out wide and just keeps getting wider until it merges with his shoulders. At first Hiro thinks it must be some kind of avant-garde helmet. But when the man rolls past him, this great shroud moves and flutters and Hiro sees that it is just his hair, a thick mane of black hair tossed back over his shoulders, trailing down his back almost to his waist.\\n\\n As he is marveling at this, he realizes that the man has turned his head to look back at him. Or to look in his general direction, anyway. It\u0027s impossible to tell exactly what he\u0027s looking at because of his goggles, a smooth convex shell over the eyes, interrupted by a narrow horizontal slit.\\n\\n He is looking at Hiro. He gives him the same fuck-you smile that he sported earlier tonight, when Hiro was standing in the entryway to The Black Sun, and he was in a public terminal somewhere.\\n\\n This is the guy. Raven. This is the guy that Juanita is looking for. The guy Lagos told him not to mess with. And Hiro has seen him before, outside the entrance to The Black Sun. This is the guy who gave the Snow Crash card to Da5id.\\n\\n The tattoo on his forehead consists of three words, written in block letters:\\n\\n POOR IMPULSE CONTROL.\\n\\n Hiro startles and actually jumps into the air as Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns launch into their opening number, \"Radiation Burn.\" It is a tornado of mostly high-pitched noise and distortion, like being flung bodily through a wall of fishhooks.\\n\\n These days, most states are franchulates or Burbclaves, much too small to have anything like a jail, or even a judicial system. So when someone does something bad, they try to find quick and dirty punishments, like flogging, confiscation of property, public humiliation, or, in the case of people who have a high potential of going on to hurt others, a warning tattoo on a prominent body part POOR IMPULSE CONTROL. Apparently, this guy went to such a place and lost his temper real bad.\\n\\n For an instant, a glowing red gridwork is plotted against the side of Raven\u0027s face. It rapidly shrinks, all sides converging inward toward the right pupil. Raven shakes his head, turns to look for the source of the laser light, but it\u0027s already gone. Lagos has already got his retinal scan.\\n\\n That\u0027s why Lagos is here. He\u0027s not interested in Hiro or Vitaly Chernobyl. He\u0027s interested in Raven. And somehow, Lagos knew that he was going to be here. And Lagos is somewhere nearby, right now, videotaping the guy, probing the contents of his pockets with radar, recording his pulse and respiration.\\n\\n Hiro picks up his personal phone. \"Y.T.,\" he says, and it dials Y.T.\u0027s number. It rings for a long time before she picks it up. It\u0027s almost impossible to hear anything over the sound of the concert.\\n\\n \"What the fuck do you want?\"\\n\\n \"Y.T., I\u0027m sorry about this. But something\u0027s going on. Something big time. I\u0027m keeping one eye on a big biker named Raven.\"\\n\\n \"The problem with you hackers is you never stop working.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what a hacker is,\" Hiro says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on this Raven guy, too,\" she says, \"sometime when I am working.\"\\n\\n Then she hangs up.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/693.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
