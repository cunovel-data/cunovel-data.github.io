{"id":21028,"no":54,"title":"Chapter 54","content":"They are approaching the waterfront. Dozens of long, skinny, single-story warehouses run parallel down toward the water. They all share the same access road at this end. Smaller roads run between them, down toward where the piers used to be. Abandoned tractor-trailers are scattered around from place to place. Ng pulls his van off the access road, into a little nook that is partly concealed between an old red-brick power station and a stack of rusted-out shipping containers. He gets it turned around so it\u0027s pointed out of here, kind of like he is expecting to leave rapidly.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s money in the storage compartment in front of you,\" Ng says.\\n\\n Y.T. opens the glove compartment, as anyone else would call it, and finds a thick bundle of worn-out, dirty, trillion-dollar bills. Ed Meeses.\\n\\n \"Jeez, couldn\u0027t you get any Gippers? This is kind of bulky.\"\\n\\n \"This is more the kind of thing that a Kourier would pay with.\"\\n\\n \"Because we\u0027re all pond scum, right?\"\\n\\n \"No comment.\"\\n\\n \"What is this, a quadrillion dollars?\"\\n\\n \"One-and-a-half quadrillion. Inflation, you know.\"\\n\\n \"What do I do?\"\\n\\n \"Fourth warehouse on the left,\" Ng says. \"When you get the tube, throw it up in the air,\"\\n\\n \"Then what?\"\\n\\n \"Everything else will be taken care of.\"\\n\\n Y.T. has her doubts about that. But if she gets in trouble, well, she can always whip out those dog tags.\\n\\n While Y.T. climbs down out of the van with her skateboard, Ng makes new sounds with his mouth. She hears a gliding and clunking noise resonating through the frame of the van, machinery coming to life. Turning back to look, she sees that a steel cocoon on the roof of the van has opened up. There is a miniature helicopter underneath it, all folded up. Its rotor blades spread themselves apart, like a butterfly unfolding. Its name is painted on its side: WHIRLWIND REAPER.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/719.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
