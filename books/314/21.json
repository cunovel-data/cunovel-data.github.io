{"id":20995,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"Hiro stares at the miniature TV in the upper left corner of the card. It zooms toward him until it\u0027s about the size of a twelve-inch low-def television set at arm\u0027s length. Then the video image begins to play. It\u0027s very poor eight-millimeter film footage of a high school football game in the sixties. No soundtrack. \"What is this game?\" The Librarian says, \"Odessa, Texas, USA. L. Bob Rife is a fullback, number eight in the dark uniform.\" \"This is more detail than I need. Can you summarize some of these things?\" \"No. But I can list the contents briefly. The stack contains eleven high school football games. Rife was on the second-string Texas all-state team in his senior year. Then he proceeded to Rice on an academic scholarship and walked onto the football team, so there are also fourteen tapes of college games. Rife majored in communications.\" \"Logically enough, considering what he became.\" \"He became a television sports reporter in the Houston market, so there are fifty hours of footage from this period -- mostly outtakes, of course. After two years in this line of work, Rife went into business with his great-uncle, a financier with roots in the oil business. The stack contains a few newspaper stories to that effect, which, as I note from reading them, are all textually related -- implying that they came from the same source.\" \"A press release.\" \"Then there are no stories for five years.\" \"He was up to something.\" \"Then we begin to see more stories, mostly from the Religion sections of Houston newspapers, detailing Rife\u0027s contributions to various organizations.\" \"That sounded like summary to me. I thought you couldn\u0027t summarize.\" \"I can\u0027t really. I was quoting a summary that Dr. Lagos made to Juanita Marquez recently, in my presence, when they were reviewing the same data.\" \"Go on.\" \"Rife contributed $500 to the Highlands Church of the Baptism by Fire, Reverend Wayne Bedford, head minister; $2,500 to the Pentecostal Youth League of Bayside, Reverend Wayne Bedford, president; $150,000 to the Pentecostal Church of the New Trinity, Reverend Wayne Bedford, founder and patriarch; $2.3 million to Rife Bible College, Reverend Wayne Bedford, President and chairman of the theology department; $20 million to the archaeology department of Rife Bible College, plus $45 million to the astronomy department and $100 million to the computer science department.\" \"Did these donations take place before hyperinflation?\" \"Yes, sir. They were, as the expression goes, real money.\" \"That Wayne Bedford guy -- is this the same Reverend Wayne who runs the Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates?\" \"The same.\" \"Are you telling me that Rife owns the Reverend Wayne?\" \"He owns a majority share in Pearlygate Associates, which is the multinational that runs the Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates chain.\" \"Okay, let\u0027s keep sifting through this,\" Hiro says. Hiro peeps out over his goggles to confirm that Vitaly is still nowhere near the concert. Then he dives back in and continues to go over the video and the news stories that Lagos has compiled. During the same years that Rife makes his contributions to the Reverend Wayne, he\u0027s showing up with increasing frequency in the business section, first in the local papers and later in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. There is a big flurry of publicity -- obvious PR plants -- after the Nipponese tried to use their old-boy network to shut him out of the telecommunications market there, and he took it to the American public, spending $10 million of his own money on a campaign to convince Americans that the Nipponese were duplicitous schemers. A triumphal cover on The Economist after the Nipponese finally knuckled under and let him corner the fiber-optics market in that country and, by extension, most of East Asia. Finally, then, the lifestyle pieces start coming in. L. Bob Rife has let his publicist know that he wants to show a more human side. There is a personality journalism program that does a puff piece on Rife after he buys a new yacht, surplus, from the U.S. Government. L. Bob Rife, last of the nineteenth-century monopolists, is shown consulting with his decorator in the captain\u0027s quarters. It looks nice as it is, considering that Rife bought this ship from the Navy, but it\u0027s not Texan enough for him. He wants it gutted and rebuilt. Then, shots of Rife maneuvering his steerlike body through the narrow passages and steep staircase of the ship\u0027s interior -- typical boring gray steel Navy scape, which, he assures the interviewer, he is going to have spruced up considerably. \"Y\u0027know, there\u0027s a story that when Rockefeller bought himself a yacht, he bought a pretty small one, like a seventy-footer or something. Small by the standards of the day. And when someone asked him why he went and bought himself such a dinky little yacht, he just looked at the guy and said, \u0027What do you think l am, a Vanderbilt?\u0027 Haw! Well, anyway, welcome aboard my yacht.\" L. Bob Rife says this while standing on a huge open-air platform elevator along with the interviewer and the whole camera crew. The elevator is going up. In the background is the Pacific Ocean. As Rife is speaking the last part of the line, suddenly the elevator rises up to the top and the camera turns around, and we are looking out across the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise, formerly of the U.S. Navy, now the personal yacht of L. Bob Rife, who beat out both General Jim\u0027s Defense System and Admiral Bob\u0027s Global Security in a furious bidding war. L. Bob Rife proceeds to admire the vast, flat open spaces of the carrier\u0027s flight deck, likening it to certain parts of Texas. He suggests that it would be amusing to cover part of it with dirt and raise cattle there. Another profile, this one shot for a business network, apparently made somewhat later: Back on the Enterprise, where the captain\u0027s office has been massively reworked. L. Bob Rife, Lord of Bandwidth, is sitting behind his desk, having his mustache waxed. Not in the sense that women have their legs waxed. He\u0027s having the curl smoothed out and restored. The waxer is a very short Asian woman who does it so delicately that it doesn\u0027t even interfere with his talking, mostly about his efforts to extend his cable TV network throughout Korea and into China and link it up with his big fiber-optic trunk line that runs across Siberia and over the Urals. \"Yeah, you know, a monopolist\u0027s work is never done. No such thing as a perfect monopoly. Seems like you can never get that last one-tenth of one percent.\" \"Isn\u0027t the government still strong in Korea? You must have more trouble with regulations there.\" L. Bob Rife laughs. \"Y\u0027know, watching government regulators trying to keep up with the world is my favorite sport. Remember when they busted up Ma Bell?\" \"Just barely.\" The reporter is a woman in her twenties. \"You know what it was, right?\" \"Voice communications monopoly.\" \"Right. They were in the same business as me. The information business. Moving phone conversations around on little tiny copper wires, one at a time. Government busted them up -- at the same time when I was starting cable TV franchises in thirty states. Haw! Can you believe that? It\u0027s like if they figured out a way to regulate horses at the same time the Model T and the airplane were being introduced.\" \"But a cable TV system isn\u0027t the same as a phone system.\" \"At that stage it wasn\u0027t, cause it was just a local system. But once you get local systems all over the world, all you got to do is hook \u0027em together and it\u0027s a global network. Just as big as the phone system. Except this one carries information ten thousand times faster. It carries images, sound, data, you name it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/686.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
