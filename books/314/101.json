{"id":21075,"no":101,"title":"Chapter 101","content":"Hiro goes over the lip of the amphitheater doing a couple of hundred miles per hour and soars out into space, in free fall, above the heads of a quarter of a million wildly cheering hackers.\n They all know Hiro. He\u0027s the guy with the swords. He\u0027s a friend of Da5id\u0027s. And as his own personal contribution to the benefit, he\u0027s apparently decided to stage a sword fight with some kind of hulking, scary-looking daemon on a motorcycle. Don\u0027t touch that dial, it\u0027s going to be a hell of a show.\n He lands on the stage and bounces to a halt next to his motorcycle. The bike still works, but it\u0027s worthless down here. Raven is ten meters away, grinning at him.\n \"Bombs away,\" Raven says. He pulls the glowing blue lozenge out of his sidecar with one hand and drops it on the center of the amphitheater. It breaks open like the shell of an egg and light shines out of it. The light begins to grow and take shape.\n The crowd goes wild.\n Hiro runs toward the egg. Raven cuts him off. Raven can\u0027t move around on his feet now because he\u0027s lost a leg. But he can still control the bike. He\u0027s got his long knife out now, and the two blades come together above the egg, which has become the vortex of a blinding, deafening tornado of light and sound. Colored shapes, foreshortened by their immense speed, shoot from the center of it and take positions above their heads, building a three-dimensional picture.\n The hackers are going nuts. Hiro knows that the Hacker Quadrant in The Black Sun is, at this moment, emptying itself out. They are all cramming through the exit and running down the Street toward the plaza, coming to see Hiro\u0027s fantastic show of light, sound, swords, and sorcery.\n Raven tries to shove Hiro back. It would work in Reality because Raven has such overpowering strength. But avatars are equally strong, unless you hack them up in just the right way. So Raven gives a mighty push and then pulls his knife back so that he can take a cut at Hiro\u0027s neck when Hiro flies away from him; but Hiro doesn\u0027t fly away. He waits for the opening and then takes Raven\u0027s sword hand off. Then, just in case, he takes Raven\u0027s other hand off. The crowd screams in delight.\n \"How do I stop this thing?\" Hiro says.\n \"Beats me. I just deliver \u0027em,\" Raven says.\n \"Do you have any concept of what you just did?\"\n \"Yeah. Realized my lifelong ambition,\" Raven says, a huge relaxed grin spreading across his face. \"I nuked America.\"\n Hiro cuts his head off. The crowd of doomed hackers rises to its feet and shrieks.\n Then they go silent as Hiro abruptly disappears. He has switched over to his small, invisible avatar. He is hovering in the air now above the shattered remains of the egg; gravity takes him right down into the center of it. As he falls, he is muttering to himself: \"SnowScan.\" It\u0027s the piece of software he wrote while he was killing time on the liferaft. The one that searches for Snow Crash.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/766.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
