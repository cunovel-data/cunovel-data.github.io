{"id":21052,"no":78,"title":"Chapter 78","content":"He leads her down passageways and up steep steel stairways and out onto the deck. It\u0027s getting close to twilight, the control tower of the Enterprise looms hard and black against a deep gray sky that\u0027s getting dark and gloomy so fast that it seems darker, now, than it will at midnight. But for now, none of the lights are on and that\u0027s all there is, black steel and slate sky.\n She follows him down the deck of the ship to the stem. From here it\u0027s a thirty-foot drop to the water, they are looking out across the prosperous, clean white neighborhood of the Russian people, separated from the squalid dark tangle of the Raft per se by a wide canal patrolled by gun-toting blackrobes. There\u0027s no stairway or rope ladder here, but there is a thick rope hanging from the railing. The big Aleut guy hauls up a chunk of rope and drapes it under one arm and over one leg in a quick motion. Then he throws one arm around Y.T.\u0027s waist, gathering her in the crook of his arm, leans back, and falls off the ship.\n She absolutely refuses to scream. She feels the rope stop his body, feels his arm squeeze her so tight she chokes for a moment, and then she\u0027s hanging there, hanging in the crook of his arm.\n She\u0027s got her arms down to her side, defiant. But just for the hell of it, she leans into him, wraps her arms around his neck, puts her head on his shoulder, and hangs on tight. He rappels them down the rope, and soon they are standing on the sanitized, prosperous Russian version of the Raft.\n \"What\u0027s your name anyway?\" she says.\n \"Dmitri Ravinoff,\" he says. \"Better known as Raven.\"\n Oh, shit.\n The connections between boats are tangled and unpredictable. To get from point A to point B, you have to wander all over the place. But Raven knows where he\u0027s going. Occasionally, he reaches out, grabs her hand, but he doesn\u0027t yank her around even though she\u0027s going a lot slower than he is. Every so often, he looks back at her with a grin, like, I could hurt you, but I won\u0027t.\n They come to a place where the Russian neighborhood is joined to the rest of the Raft by a wide plank bridge guarded by Uzi dudes. Raven ignores them, takes Y.T.\u0027s hand again, and walks right across the bridge with her. Y.T. hardly has time to think through the implications of this before it hits her, she looks around, sees all these gaunt Asians, staring back at her like she\u0027s a five-course meal, and realizes: I\u0027m on the Raft. Actually on the Raft.\n \"These are Hong Kong Vietnamese,\" Raven says. \"Started out in Vietnam, came to Hong Kong as boat people after the war there -- so they\u0027ve been living on sampans for a couple of generations now. Don\u0027t be scared, this isn\u0027t dangerous for you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I can find my way back here,\" Y.T. says.\n \"Relax,\" he says. \"I\u0027ve never lost a girlfriend.\"\n \"Have you ever had a girlfriend?\"\n Raven throws back his head and laughs. \"A lot, in the old days. Not as many in the past few years.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? The old days? Is that when you got your tattoo?\"\n \"Yeah. I\u0027m an alcoholic. Used to get in a lot of trouble. Been sober for eight years.\"\n \"Then how come everyone\u0027s scared of you?\"\n Raven turns to her, smiles broadly, shrugs. \"Oh, because I\u0027m an incredibly ruthless, efficient, cold-blooded killer, you know.\"\n Y.T. laughs. So does Raven.\n \"What\u0027s your job?\" Y.T. asks.\n \"I\u0027m a harpooner,\" he says.\n \"Like in Moby Dick?\" Y.T. likes this idea. She read that book in school. Most of the people in her class, even the power tools, thought that the book was totally entrenched. But she liked all the stuff about harpooning.\n \"Nah. Compared to me, those Moby Dicksters were faggots.\"\n \"What kind of stuff do you harpoon?\"\n \"You name it.\"\n From there on out, she just looks at him. Or at inanimate objects. Because otherwise she wouldn\u0027t see anything except thousands of dark eyes staring back at her. In that way, it\u0027s a big change from being a slop-slinger for the repressed.\n Part of it is just because she\u0027s so different. But part of it is that there\u0027s no privacy on the Raft, you make your way around by hopping from one boat to the next. But each boat is home to about three dozen people, so it\u0027s like you are constantly walking through people\u0027s living rooms. And bathrooms. And bedrooms. Naturally, they look.\n They tromp across a makeshift platform built on oil drums. A couple of Vietnamese dudes are there arguing or haggling over something looks like a slab of fish. The one who\u0027s turned toward them sees them coming. His eyes flicker across Y.T. without pausing, fix on Raven, and go wide. He steps back. The guy he\u0027s talking to, who has his back to them, turns around and literally jumps into the air, letting out a suppressed grunt. Both of them back well out of Raven\u0027s path.\n And then she figures out something important: These people aren\u0027t looking at her. They\u0027re not even giving her a second glance. They\u0027re all looking at Raven. And it\u0027s not just a case of celebrity watching or something like that. All of these Raft dudes, these tough scary homeboys of the sea, are scared shitless of this guy.\n And she\u0027s on a date with him.\n And it\u0027s just started.\n Suddenly, walking through another Vietnamese living room, Y.T. has a flashback to the most excruciating conversation she ever had, which was a year ago when her mother tried to give her advice on what to do if a boy got fresh with her. Yeah, Mom, right. I\u0027ll keep that in mind. Yeah, I\u0027ll be sure to remember that. Y.T. knew that advice was worthless, and this goes to show she was right.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/743.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
