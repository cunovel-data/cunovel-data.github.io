{"id":20996,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"A naked PR plant, a half-hour television commercial with no purpose whatsoever other than to let L. Bob Rife tell his side of a particular issue. It seems that a number of Rife\u0027s programmers, the people who made his systems run, got together and formed a union -- unheard of, for hackers -- and filed a suit against Rife, claiming that he had placed audio and video bugs in their homes, in fact placed all of them under twenty-four-hour surveillance, and harassed and threatened some programmers who were making what he called \"unacceptable lifestyle choices.\" For example, when one of his programmers and her husband engaged in oral sex in their own bedroom one night, the next morning she was called into Rife\u0027s office, where he called her a slut and a sodomite and told her to clean out her desk. The bad publicity from this so annoyed Rife that he felt the need to blow a few million on some more PR.\n \"I deal in information,\" he says to the smarmy, toadying pseudojournalist who \"interviews\" him. He\u0027s sitting in his office in Houston, looking slicker than normal. \"All television going out to Consumers throughout the world goes through me. Most of the information transmitted to and from the CIC database passes through my networks. The Metaverse -- -the entire Street -- exists by virtue of a network that I own and control.\n \"But that means, if you\u0027ll just follow my reasoning for a bit, that when I have a programmer working under me who is working with that information, he is wielding enormous power. Information is going into his brain. And it\u0027s staying there. It travels with him when he goes home at night. It gets all tangled up into his dreams, for Christ\u0027s sake. He talks to his wife about it. And, goddamn it, he doesn\u0027t have any right to that information. If I was running a car factory, I wouldn\u0027t let workers drive the cars home or borrow tools. But that\u0027s what I do at five o\u0027clock each day, all over the world, when my hackers go home from work.\n \"When they used to hang rustlers in the old days, the last thing they would do is piss their pants. That was the ultimate sign, you see, that they had lost control over their own bodies, that they were about to die. See, it\u0027s the first function of any organization to control its own sphincters. We\u0027re not even doing that. So we\u0027re working on refining our management techniques so that we can control that information no matter where it is -- on our hard disks or even inside the programmers\u0027 heads. Now, I can\u0027t say more because I got competition to worry about. But it is my fervent hope that in five or ten years, this kind of thing won\u0027t even be an issue.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/687.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
