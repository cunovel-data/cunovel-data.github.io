{"id":21046,"no":72,"title":"Chapter 72","content":"When she first woke up, she was still in her RadiKS coverall, mummified in gaffer\u0027s tape, lying on the floor of a shitty old Ford van blasting across the middle of nowhere. This did not put her into a very favorable mood. The stun bunny left her with a persistent nosebleed and an eternal throbbing headache, and every time the van hit a chuckhole, her head bounced on the Corrugated steel floor.\n First she was just pissed. Then she started having brief moments of fear -- wanting to go home. After eight hours in the back of the van, there was no doubt in her mind that she wanted to go home. The only thing that kept her from giving up was curiosity. As far as she could tell from this admittedly poor vantage point, this didn\u0027t look like a Fed operation.\n The van pulled off the highway, onto a frontage road, and into a parking lot. The rear doors of the van opened up, and a couple of women climbed in. Through the open doors, Y.T. could see the Gothic arch logo of a Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates.\n \"Oh, you poor baby,\" one of the women said. The other woman just gasped in horror at her condition. One of them just cradled her head and stroked her hair, letting her sip sweet Kool-Aid from a Dixie cup, while the other tenderly, slowly took the gaffer\u0027s tape off.\n Her shoes had already been removed when she woke up in the back of the van, and no one offered her another pair. And everything had been removed from her coverall. All the good stuff was gone. But they hadn\u0027t gone underneath the coverall. She still had the dog tags. And one other thing, a thing between her legs called a dentata. There\u0027s no way they could have found that.\n She has always known that the dog tags were probably a fake thing anyway. Uncle Enzo doesn\u0027t just go around giving his war souvenirs to fifteen-year-old chicks. But they still might have an effect on someone.\n The two women are named Maria and Bonnie. They are with her all the time. Not only with her, but touching her. Lots of hugs, squeezes, hand-holding, and tousled hair. The first time she goes to the bathroom, Bonnie goes with her, opening the stall door and actually standing in there with her. Y.T. thinks that Bonnie is worried that she\u0027s going to pass out on the toilet or something. But the next time she has to pee, Maria goes with her. She gets no privacy at all. The only problem is she can\u0027t deny that she likes it, in a way. The ride in the van hurt. It really hurt bad. She never felt so lonely in her life. And now she\u0027s barefoot and defenseless in an unfamiliar place and they\u0027re giving her what she needs.\n After she had a few minutes to freshen up -- whatever that means -- inside the Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates, she and Marla and Bonnie climbed into a big stretch van with no windows. The floor was carpeted but there were no seats inside, everyone sat on the floor. The van was jammed when they opened the rear doors. Twenty people were packed into it, all energetic, beaming youths. It looked impossible; Y.T. shrank away from it, backing right into Marla and Bonnie. But a cheerful roar came up from the van people, white teeth flashing in the dimness, and people began to scrunch out a tiny space for them.\n She spent most of the next two days packed into the van between Bonnie and Maria, holding hands with them constantly, so she couldn\u0027t even pick her nose without permission. They sang happy songs until her brain turned to tapioca. They played wacky games.\n A couple of times every hour, someone in the van would start to babble, just like the Falabalas. Just like the Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates people. The babbling would spread throughout the van like a contagious disease, and soon everyone would be doing it.\n Everyone except for Y.T. She couldn\u0027t seem to get the hang of it. It just seemed embarrassingly stupid to her. So she just faked it.\n Three times a day, they had a chance to eat and eliminate. It always happened in Burbclaves. Y.T. could feel them pulling off the interstate, finding their way down twisty development lanes, courts, ways, and circles. A garage door would rise electrically, the van would pull in, the door would shut behind them. They would go into a suburban house, except stripped of furniture and other family touches, and sit on the floor in empty bedrooms -- one for boys, one for girls -- and eat cake and cookies. This always happened in a totally empty room in a house, but there was always different decor: in one place, flowery countryish wallpaper and a lingering smell of rancid Glade. In another, bluish wallpaper featuring hockey players, football players, basketball players. In another, just plain white walls with old crayon marks on them. Sitting in these empty rooms, Y.T. would study the old furniture scrapes on the floors, the dents in the sheetrock, and muse over them like an archaeologist, wondering about the long departed families who had once lived here. But toward the end of the ride, she wasn\u0027t paying attention anymore.\n In the van, she could hear nothing but singing and chanting, see nothing but the jammed-together faces of her companions. When they stopped for gas, they did it in giant truck stops out in the middle of nowhere, pulling up to the most distant pump island so that no one was near them. And they never stopped driving. They just got relayed from one driver to the next.\n Finally, they got to a coast. Y.T. could smell it. They spent a few minutes waiting, engine idling, and then the van bumped over some kind of a threshold, climbed a few ramps, stopped, set its parking brake. The driver got out and left them all alone in the van for the first time. Y.T. felt glad that the trip was over.\n Then everything started to rumble, like an engine noise but a lot bigger. She didn\u0027t feel any movement until a few minutes later, when she realized that everything was rocking gently. The van was parked on a ship, and the ship was headed out to sea.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/737.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
