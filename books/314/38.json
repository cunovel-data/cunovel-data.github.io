{"id":21012,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 38","content":"The Compton Nova Sicilia franchise is a grisly scene. It is a jamboree of Young Mafia. These youths are even duller than the ones from the all-Mormon Deseret Burbclave. The boys are wearing tedious black suits. The girls are encrusted with pointless femininity. Girls can\u0027t even be in the Young Mafia, they have to be in the Girls\u0027 Auxiliary and serve macaroons on silver plates. \"Girls\" is too fine a word for these organisms, too high up the evolutionary scale. They aren\u0027t even chicks. She\u0027s going way too fast, so she kicks the board around sideways, plants pads, leans into it, skids to a halt, roiling up a wave of dust and grit that dulls the glossy shoes of several Young Mafia who are milling out front, nibbling dinky Italo-treats and playing grown-up. It condenses on the white lace stockings of the Young Mafia proto-chicks. She falls off the board, appearing to catch her balance at the last moment. She stomps on the edge of the plank with one foot, and it bounces four feet into the air, spinning rapidly around its long axis, up into her armpit, where she clamps it tight under one arm. The spokes of the smartwheels all retract so that the wheels are barely larger than their hubs. She slaps the MagnaPoon into a handy socket on the bottom of the plank so that her gear is all in one handy package. \"Y.T.,\" she says. \"Young, fast, and female. Where the fuck\u0027s Enzo?\" The boys decide to get all \"mature\" on Y.T. Males of this age are preoccupied with snapping each other\u0027s underwear and drinking until they are in a coma. But around a female, they do the \"mature\" thing. It is hilarious. One of them steps forward slightly, interposing himself between Y.T. and the nearest protochick. \"Welcome to Nova Sicilia,\" he says. \"Can I assist you in some way?\" Y.T. sighs deeply. She is a fully independent businessperson, and these people are trying to do a peer thing on her. \"Delivery for one Enzo? Y\u0027know, I can\u0027t wait to get out of this neighborhood.\" \"It\u0027s a good neighborhood, now,\" the YoMa says. \"You should stick around for a few minutes. Maybe you could learn some manners.\" \"You should try surfing the Ventura at rush hour. Maybe you could learn your limitations.\u0027 The YoMa laughs like, okay, if that\u0027s how you want it. He gestures toward the door. \"The man you want to talk to is in there. Whether he wants to talk to you or not, I\u0027m not sure.\" \"He fucking asked for me,\" Y.T. says. \"He came across the country to be with us,\" the guy says, \"and he seems pretty happy with us.\" All the other YoMas mumble and nod supportively. \"Then why are you standing outside?\" Y.T. asks, going inside. Inside the franchise, things are startlingly relaxed. Uncle Enzo is in there, looking just like he does in the pictures, except bigger than Y.T. expected. He is sitting at a desk playing cards with some other guys in funeral garb. He is smoking a cigar and nursing an espresso. Can\u0027t get too much stimulation, apparently. There\u0027s a whole Uncle Enzo portable support system in here. A traveling espresso machine has been set up on another desk. A cabinet sits next to it, doors open to reveal a big foil bag of Italian Roast Water-Process Decaf and a box of Havana cigars. There\u0027s also a gargoyle in one corner, patched into a bigger-than-normal laptop, mumbling to himself. Y.T. lifts her arm, allows the plank to fall into her hand. She slaps it down on top of an empty desk and approaches Uncle Enzo, unslinging the delivery from her shoulder. \"Gino, please,\" Uncle Enzo says, nodding at the delivery. Gino steps forward to take it from her. \"Need your signature on that,\" Y.T. says. For some reason she does not refer to him as \"pal\" or \"bub.\" She\u0027s momentarily distracted by Gino. Suddenly, Uncle Enzo has come rather close to her, caught her right hand in his left hand. Her Kourier gloves have an opening on the back of the hand just big enough for his lips. He plants a kiss on Y.T.\u0027s hand. It\u0027s warm and wet. Not slobbery and gross, not antiseptic and dry either. Interesting. The guy has confidence going for him. Christ, he\u0027s slick. Nice lips. Sort of firm muscular lips, not gelatinous and blubbery like fifteen-year-old lips can be. Uncle Enzo has a very faint citrus-and-aged-tobacco smell to him. Fully smelling it would involve standing pretty close to him. He is towering over her, standing at a respectable distance now, glinting at her through crinkly old-guy eyes. Seems pretty nice. \"I can\u0027t tell you how much I\u0027ve been looking forward to meeting you, Y.T.,\" he says. \"Hi,\" she says. Her voice sounds chirpier than she likes it to be. So she adds, \"What\u0027s in that bag that\u0027s so fucking valuable, anyway?\" \"Absolutely nothing,\" Uncle Enzo says. His smile is not exactly smug. More embarrassed, like what an awkward way to meet someone. \"It all has to do with imageering,\" be says, spreading one hand dismissively. \"There are not many ways for a man like me to meet with a young girl that do not generate incorrect images in the media. It\u0027s stupid. But we pay attention to these things.\" \"So, what did you want to meet with me about? Got a delivery for me to make?\" All the guys in the room laugh. The sound startles Y.T. a little, reminds her that she is performing in front of a crowd. Her eyes flick away from Uncle Enzo for a moment. Uncle Enzo notices this. His smile gets infinitesimally narrower, and he hesitates for a moment. In that moment, all the other guys in the room stand up and head for the exit. \"You may not believe me,\" he says, \"but I simply wanted to thank you for delivering that pizza a few weeks ago.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t I believe you?\" she asks. She is amazed to hear nice, sweet things coming out of her mouth. So is Uncle Enzo. \"I\u0027m sure you of all people can come up with a reason.\" \"So,\" she says, \"you having a nice day with all the Young Mafia?\" Uncle Enzo gives her a look that says, watch it, child. A second after she gets scared, she starts laughing, because it\u0027s a put-on, he\u0027s just giving her a hard time. He smiles, indicating that it\u0027s okay for her to laugh. Y.T. can\u0027t remember when she\u0027s been so involved in a conversation. Why can\u0027t all people be like Uncle Enzo? \"Let me see,\" Uncle Enzo says, looking at the ceiling, scanning his memory banks. \"I know a few things about you. That you are fifteen years old, you live in a Burbclave in the Valley with your mother.\" \"I know a few things about you, too,\" Y.T. hazards. Uncle Enzo laughs. \"Not nearly as much as you think, I promise. Tell me, what does your mother think of your career?\" Nice of him to use the word \"career.\" \"She\u0027s not totally aware of it -- or doesn\u0027t want to know.\" \"You\u0027re probably wrong,\" Uncle Enzo says. He says it cheerfully enough, not trying to cut her down or anything. \"You might be shocked at how well-informed she is. This is my experience, anyway. What does your mother do for a living?\" \"She works for the Feds.\" Uncle Enzo finds that richly amusing. \"And her daughter is delivering pizzas for Nova Sicilia. What does she do for the Feds?\" \"Some kind of thing where she can\u0027t really tell me in case I blab it. She has to take a lot of polygraph tests.\" Uncle Enzo seems to understand this very well. \"Yes, a lot of Fed jobs are that way.\" There is an opportune silence. \"It kind of freaks me out,\" Y.T. says. \"The fact that she works for the Feds?\" \"The polygraph tests. They put a thing around her arm -- to measure the blood pressure.\" \"A sphygmomanometer,\" Uncle Enzo says crisply. \"It leaves a bruise around her arm. For some reason, that kind of bothers me.\" \"It should bother you.\" \"And the house is bugged. So when I\u0027m home -- no matter what I\u0027m doing -- someone else is probably listening.\" \"Well, I can certainly relate to that,\" Uncle Enzo says. They both laugh. \"I\u0027m going to ask you a question that I\u0027ve always wanted to ask a Kourier,\" Uncle Enzo says. \"I always watch you people through the windows of my limousine. In fact, when a Kourier poons me, I always tell Peter, my driver, not to give them a hard time. My question is, you are covered from head to toe in protective padding. So why don\u0027t you wear a helmet?\" \"The suit\u0027s got a cervical airbag that blows up when you fall off the board, so you can bounce on your head. Besides, helmets feel weird. They say it doesn\u0027t affect your hearing, but it does.\" \"You use your hearing quite a bit in your line of work?\" \"Definitely, yeah.\" Uncle Enzo is nodding. \"That\u0027s what I suspected. We felt the same way, the boys in my unit in Vietnam.\" \"I heard you went to Vietnam, but -- \" She stops, sensing danger. \"You thought it was hype. No, I went there. Could have stayed out, if I\u0027d wanted. But I volunteered.\" \"You volunteered to go to Vietnam?\" Uncle Enzo laughs. \"Yes, I did. The only boy in my family to do so.\" \"Why?\" \"I thought it would be safer than Brooklyn.\" Y.T. laughs. \"A bad joke,\" he says. \"I volunteered because my father didn\u0027t want me to. And I wanted to piss him off.\" \"Really?\" \"Definitely. I spent years and years finding ways to piss him off. Dated black girls. Grew my hair long. Smoked marijuana. But the capstone, my ultimate achievement -- even better than having my ear pierced -- was volunteering for service in Vietnam. But I had to take extreme measures even then.\" Y.T.\u0027s eyes dart back and forth between Uncle Enzo\u0027s creased and leathery earlobes. In the left one she just barely sees a tiny diamond stud. \"What do you mean, extreme measures?\" \"Everyone knew who I was. Word gets around, you know. If I had volunteered for the regular Army, I would have ended up stateside, filling out forms -- maybe even at Fort Hamilton, right there in Bensonhurst. To prevent that, I volunteered for Special Forces, did everything I could to get into a front-line unit.\" He laughs. \"And it worked. Anyway, I\u0027m rambling like an old man. I was trying to make a point about helmets.\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Our job was to go through the jungle making trouble for some slippery gentlemen carrying guns bigger than they were. Stealthy guys. And we depended on our hearing, too -- just like you do. And you know what? We never wore helmets.\" \"Same reason?\" \"Exactly. Even though they didn\u0027t cover the ears, really, they did something to your sense of hearing. I still think I owe my life to going bareheaded.\" \"That\u0027s really cool. That\u0027s really interesting.\" \"You\u0027d think they would have solved the problem by now.\" \"Yeah,\" Y.T. volunteers, \"some things never change, I guess.\" Uncle Enzo throws back his head and belly laughs. Usually, Y.T. finds this kind of thing pretty annoying, but Uncle Enzo just seems like he\u0027s having a good time, not putting her down. Y.T. wants to ask him how he went from the ultimate rebellion to running the family beeswax. She doesn\u0027t. But Uncle Enzo senses that it is the next, natural subject of the conversation. \"Sometimes I wonder who\u0027ll come after me,\" he says. \"Oh, we have plenty of excellent people in the next generation. But after that -- well, I don\u0027t know. I guess all old people feel like the world is coming to an end.\" \"You got millions of those Young Mafia types,\" Y.T. says. \"All destined to wear blazers and shuffle papers in suburbia. You don\u0027t respect those people very much, Y.T., because you\u0027re young and arrogant. But I don\u0027t respect them much either, because I\u0027m old and wise.\" This is a fairly shocking thing for Uncle Enzo to be saying, but Y.T. doesn\u0027t feel shocked. It just seems like a reasonable statement coming from her reasonable pal, Uncle Enzo. \"None of them would ever volunteer to go get his legs shot off in the jungle, just to piss off his old man. They lack a certain fiber. They are lifeless and beaten down.\" \"That\u0027s sad,\" Y.T. says. It feels better to say this than to trash them, which was her first inclination. \"Well,\" says Uncle Enzo. It is the \"well\" that begins the end of a conversation. \"I was going to send you some roses, but you wouldn\u0027t really be interested in that, would you?\" \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t mind,\" she says, sounding pathetically weak to herself. \"Here\u0027s something better, since we are comrades in arms,\" he says. He loosens his tie and collar, reaches down into his shirt, pulls out an amazingly cheap steel chain with a couple of stamped silver tags dangling from it. \"These are my old dog tags,\" he says. \"Been carrying them around for years, just for the hell of it. I would be amused if you would wear them.\" Trying to keep her knees steady, she puts the dog tags on. They dangle down onto her coverall. \"Better put them inside,\" Uncle Enzo says. She drops them down into the secret place between her breasts. They are still warm from Uncle Enzo. \"Thanks.\" \"It\u0027s just for fun,\" he says, \"but if you ever get into trouble, and you show those dog tags to whoever it is that\u0027s giving you a bad time, then things will probably change very quickly.\" \"Thanks, Uncle Enzo.\" \"Take care of yourself. Be good to your mother. She loves you.\" As she steps out of the Nova Sicilia franchulate, a guy is waiting for her. He smiles, not without irony, and makes just a hint of a bow, sort of to get her attention. It\u0027s pretty ridiculous, but after being with Uncle Enzo for a while, she\u0027s definitely into it. So she doesn\u0027t laugh in his face or anything, just looks the other way and blows him off. \"Y.T. Got a job for ya,\" he says. \"I\u0027m busy,\" she says, \"got other deliveries to make.\" \"You lie like a mattress,\" he says appreciatively. \"Y\u0027know that gargoyle in there? He\u0027s patched in to the RadiKS computer even as we speak. So we all know for a fact you don\u0027t got no jobs to do.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t take jobs from a customer,\" Y.T. says. \"We\u0027re centrally dispatched. You have to go through the 1-800 number.\" \"Jeez, what kind of a fucking dickhead do you think lam?\" the guy says. Y.T. stops walking, turns, finally looks at the guy. He\u0027s tall, lean. Black suit, black hair. And he\u0027s got a gnarly-looking glass eye. \"What happened to your eye?\" she says. \"Ice pick, Bayonne, 1985,\" he says. \"Any other questions?\" \"Sorry, man, I was just asking.\" \"Now back to business. Because I don\u0027t have my head totally up my asshole, like you seem to assume, I am aware that all Kouriers are centrally dispatched through the 1-800 number. Now, we don\u0027t like 1-800 numbers and central dispatching. It\u0027s just a thing with us. We like to go person-to-person, the old-fashioned way. Like, on my momma\u0027s birthday, I don\u0027t pick up the phone and dial 1-800-CALL-MOM. I go there in person and give her a kiss on the cheek, okay? Now in this case, we want you in particular.\" \"How come?\" \"Because we just love to deal with difficult little chicks who ask too many fucking questions. So our gargoyle has already patched himself in to the computer that RadiKS uses to dispatch Kouriers.\" The man with the glass eye turns, rotating his head way, way around like an owl, and nods in the direction of the gargoyle. A second later, Y.T.\u0027s personal phone rings. \"Fucking pick it up,\" he says. \"What?\" she says into the phone. A computer voice tells her that she is supposed to make a pickup in Griffith Park and deliver it to a Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates franchise in Van Nuys. \"If you want something delivered from point A to point B, why don\u0027t you just drive it down there yourselves?\" Y.T. asks. \"Put it in one of those black Lincoln Town Cars and just get it done.\" \"Because in this case, the something doesn\u0027t exactly belong to us, and the people at point A and point B, well, we aren\u0027t necessarily on the best of terms, mutually speaking.\" \"You want me to steal something,\" Y.T. says. The man with the glass eye is pained, wounded. \"No, no, no. Kid, listen. We\u0027re the fucking Mafia. We want to steal something, we already know how to do that, okay? We don\u0027t need a fifteen-year-old girl\u0027s help to get something stolen. What we are doing here is more of a covert operation.\" \"A spy thing.\" Intel. \"Yeah. A spy thing,\" the man says, his tone of voice suggesting that he is trying to humor someone. \"And the only way to get this operation to work is if we have a Kourier who can cooperate with us a little bit.\" \"So all that stuff with Uncle Enzo was fake,\" Y.T. says. \"You\u0027re just trying to get all friendly with a Kourier.\" \"Oh, ho, listen to this,\" says the man with the glass eye, genuinely amused. \"Yeah, like we have to go all the way to the top to impress a fifteen-year-old. Look, kid, there\u0027s a million Kouriers out there we could bribe to do this. We\u0027re going with you, again, because you have a personal relationship with our outfit.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" \"Exactly what you would normally do at this juncture,\" the man says. \"Go to Griffith Park and make the pickup.\" \"That\u0027s it?\" \"Yeah. Then make the delivery. But do us a favor and take I-5, okay?\" \"That\u0027s not the best way to do it -- \" \"Do it anyway.\" \"Okay.\" \"Now come on, we\u0027ll give you an escort out of this hellhole.\" Sometimes, if the wind is going the right way, and you get into the pocket of air behind a speeding eighteen-wheeler, you don\u0027t even have to poon it. The vacuum, like a mighty hoover, sucks you in. You can stay there all day. But if you screw up, you suddenly find yourself alone and powerless in the left lane of a highway with a convoy of semis right behind you. Just as bad, if you give in to its power, it will suck you right into its mudflaps, you will become axle dressing, and no one will ever know. This is called the Magic Hoover Poon. It reminds Y.T. of the way her life has been since the fateful night of the Hiro Protagonist pizza adventure. Her poon cannot miss as she slingshots her way up the San Diego Freeway. She can get a solid yank off even the lightest, trashiest plastic-and-aluminum Chinese econobox. People don\u0027t fuck with her. She has established her space on the pavement. She is going to get so much business now. She will have to sub a lot of work out to Roadkill. And sometimes, just to make important business arrangements, they will have to check into a motel somewhere -- which is exactly what real business people do. Lately, Y.T. has been trying to teach Roadkill how to give her a massage. But Roadkill can never get past her shoulder blades before he loses it and starts being Mr.Macho. Which anyway is kind of sweet. And anyway, you take what you can get. This is not the most direct route to Griffith Park by a longshot, but this is what the Mafia wants her to do: Take 405 all the way up into the Valley, and then approach from that direction, which is the direction she\u0027d normally come from. They\u0027re so paranoid. So professional. LAX goes by on her left. On her right, she gets a glimpse of the U-Stor-It where that dweeb, her partner, is probably goggled into his computer. She weaves through complex traffic flows around Hughes Airport, which is now a private outpost of Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong. Continues past the Santa Monica Airport, which just got bought out by Admiral Bob\u0027s Global Security. Cuts through the middle of Fedland, where her mother goes to work every day. Fedland used to be the VA Hospital and a bunch of other Federal buildings; now it has condensed into a kidney-shaped lozenge that wraps around 405. It has a barrier around it, a perimeter fence put up by stringing chain link fabric, concertina wire, heaps of rubble, and Jersey barriers from one building to the next. All of the buildings in Fedland are big and ugly. Human beings mill around their plinths, wearing wool clothing the color of damp granite. They are scrawny and dark underneath the white majesty of the buildings. On the far side of the Fedland barrier, off to the right, she can see UCLA, which is now being jointly run by the Japanese and Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong and a few big American corporations. People say that over there to the left, in Pacific Palisades, is a big building above the ocean where the Central Intelligence Corporation has its West Coast headquarters. Soon -- like maybe tomorrow -- she\u0027ll go up there, find that building, maybe just cruise past it and wave. She has great stuff to tell Hiro now. Great intel on Uncle Enzo. People would pay millions for it. But in her heart, she\u0027s already feeling the pangs of conscience. She knows that she cannot kiss and tell on the Mafia. Not because she\u0027s afraid of them. Because they trust her. They were nice to her. And who knows, it might turn into something. A better career than she could get with CIC. Not many cars are taking the off-ramp into Fedland. Her mother does it every morning, as do a bunch of other Feds. But all Feds go to work early and stay late. It\u0027s a loyalty thing with them. The Feds have a fetish for loyalty -- since they don\u0027t make a lot of money or get a lot of respect, you have to prove you\u0027re personally committed and that you don\u0027t care about those trappings. Case in point: Y.T. has been pooned onto the same cab all the way from LAX. It\u0027s got an Arab in the back seat. His burnous flutters in the wind from the open window; the air conditioning doesn\u0027t work, an L.A. cabbie doesn\u0027t make enough money to buy Chill -- Freon -- on the underground market. This is typical: only the Feds would make a visitor take a dirty, un-air conditioned cab. Sure enough, the cab pulls onto the ramp marked UNITED STATES. Y.T. disengages and slaps her poon onto a Valley-bound delivery truck. On top of the huge Federal Building, a bunch of Feds with walkie-talkies and dark glasses and FEDS windbreakers lurk, aiming long lenses into the windshields of the vehicles coming up Wilshire Boulevard If this were nighttime, she\u0027d probably see a laser scanner playing over the bar-code license plate of the taxi as it veers onto the U.S. exit. Y.T.\u0027s mom has told her all about these guys. They are the Executive Branch General Operational Command, EBGOC. The FBI, Federal Marshalls, Secret Service, and Special Forces all claim some separate identity still, like the Army, Navy, and Air Force used to, but they\u0027re all under the command of EBGOC, they all do the same things, and they are more or less interchangeable. Outside of Fedland, everyone just knows them as the Feds. EBGOC claims the right to go anywhere, anytime, within the original borders of the United States of America, without a warrant or even a good excuse. But they only really feel at home here, in Fedland, staring down the barrel of a telephoto lens, shotgun microphone, or sniper rifle. The longer the better. Down below them, the taxicab with the Arab in the back slows down to sublight speed and winds its way down a twisting slalom course of Jersey barriers with .50-caliber machine gun nests strategically placed here and there. It comes to a stop in front of an STD device, straddling an open pit where EBGOC boys stand with dogs and high-powered spotlights to look up its skirt for bombs or NBCI (nuclear-biological-chemical-informational) agents in the undercarriage. Meanwhile, the driver gets out and pops the hood and trunk so that more Feds can inspect them; another Fed leans against the window next to the Arab and grills him through the window. They say that in D.C., all the museums and the monuments have been concessioned out and turned into a tourist park that now generates about 10 percent of the Government\u0027s revenue. The Feds could run the concession themselves and probably keep more of the gross, but that\u0027s not the point. It\u0027s a philosophical thing. A back-to-basics thing. Government should govern. It\u0027s not in the entertainment industry, is it? Leave entertaining to Industry weirdos -- people who majored in tap dancing. Feds aren\u0027t like that. Feds are serious people. Poli-sci majors. Student council presidents. Debate club chairpersons. The kinds of people who have the grit to wear a dark wool suit and a tightly buttoned collar even when the temperature has greenhoused up to a hundred and ten degrees and the humidity is thick enough to stall a jumbo jet. The kinds of people who feel most at home on the dark side of a one-way mirror. Sometimes, to prove their manhood, boys of about Y.T.\u0027s age will drive to the eastern end of the Hollywood Hills, into Griffith Park, pick the road of their choosing, and simply drive through it. Making it through there unscathed is a lot like counting coup on a High Plains battlefield; simply having come that close to danger makes you more of a man. By definition, all they ever see are the through streets. If you are driving into Griffith Park for some highjinks and you see a NO OUTLET sign, you know that it is time to shift your dad\u0027s Accord into reverse and drive it backward all the way back home, revving the engine way past the end of the tachometer. Naturally, as soon as Y.T. enters the park, following the road she was told to follow, she sees a NO OUTLET sign. Y.T.\u0027s not the first Kourier to take a job like this, and so she has heard about the place she is going. It is a narrow canyon, accessed only by this one road, and down in the bottom of the canyon a new gang lives. Everyone calls them the Falabalas, because that\u0027s how they talk to each other. They have their own language and it sounds like babble. Right now, the important thing is not to think about how stupid this is. Making the right decision is, priority-wise, down there along with getting enough niacin and writing a thank-you letter to grandma for the nice pearl earrings. The only important thing is not to back down. A row of machine-gun nests marks the border of Falabala territory. It seems like overkill to Y.T. But then she\u0027s never been in a conflict with the Mafia, either. She plays it cool, idles toward the barrier at maybe ten miles an hour. This is where she\u0027ll freak out and get scared if she\u0027s going to. She is holding aloft a color-faxed RadiKS document, featuring the cybernetic radish logo, proclaiming that she really is here to pick up an important delivery, honest. It\u0027ll never work with these guys. But it does. A big gnarled-up coil of razor ribbon is pulled out of her way, just like that, and she glides through without slowing down. And that\u0027s when she knows that it\u0027s going to be fine. These people are just doing business here, just like anyone else. She doesn\u0027t have to skate far into the canyon. Thank God. She goes around a few turns, into kind of an open flat area surrounded by trees, and finds herself in what looks like an open-air insane asylum. Or a Moonie festival or something. A couple of dozen people are here. None of them have been taking care of themselves at all. They are all wearing the ragged remains of what used to be pretty decent clothing. Half a dozen of them are kneeling on the pavement with their hands clenched tightly together, mumbling to unseen entities. On the trunk lid of a dead car, they\u0027ve set up an old junked computer terminal, just a dark monitor screen with a big spider-web crack in it, like someone bounced a coffee mug off the glass. A fat man with red suspenders dangling around his knees is sliding his hands up and down the keyboard, whacking the keys randomly, talking out loud in a meaningless babble. A couple of the others stand behind him, peeking over his shoulder and around his body, and sometimes they try to horn in on it, but he shoves them out of the way. There\u0027s also a crowd of people clapping their hands, swaying their bodies, and singing \"The Happy Wanderer.\" They\u0027re really into it, too. Y.T. hasn\u0027t seen such childlike glee on anyone\u0027s face since the first time she let Roadkill take her clothes off. But this is a different kind of childlike glee that does not look right on a bunch of thirty-something people with dirty hair. And finally, there is a guy that Y.T. dubs the High Priest. He\u0027s wearing a formerly white lab coat, bearing the logo of some company in the Bay Area. He\u0027s sacked out in the back of a dead station wagon, but when Y.T. enters the area he jumps up and runs toward her in a way that she can\u0027t help but find a little threatening. But compared to these others, he seems almost like a regular, healthy, fit, demented bush-dwelling psychotic. \"You\u0027re here to pick up a suitcase, right?\" \"I\u0027m here to pick up something. I don\u0027t know what it is,\" she says. He goes over to one of the dead cars, unlocks the hood, pulls out an aluminum briefcase. It looks exactly like the one that Squeaky took out of the BMW last night. \"Here\u0027s your delivery,\" he says, striding toward her. She backs away from him instinctively. \"I understand, I understand,\" he says. \"I\u0027m a scary creep.\" He puts it on the ground, puts his foot on it, gives it a shove. It slides across the pavement to Y.T., bouncing off the occasional rock. \"There\u0027s no big hurry on this delivery,\" he says. \u0027Would you like to stay and have a drink? We\u0027ve got Kool-Aid.\" \"I\u0027d love to,\" Y.T. says, \"but my diabetes is acting up real bad.\" \"Well, then you can just stay and be a guest of our community.
