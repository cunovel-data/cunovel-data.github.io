{"id":21005,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"The limousines stop, and Nipponese people start to climb out. Dark-clad, unfunky, they stand around awkwardly in the middle of the party/riot, like a handful of broken nails suspended in a colorful jello mold. Finally, Hiro makes bold enough to go up and look into one of the windows to find out if this is who he thinks it is. Can\u0027t see through the smoked glass. He bends down, puts his face right near the window, trying to make it real obvious. Still no response. Finally, he knocks on the window. Silence. He looks up at the entourage. They are all watching him. But when he looks up they glance away, suddenly remember to drag on their cigarettes or rub their eyebrows. There is only one source of light inside the limousine that\u0027s bright enough to be visible through the smoked glass, and that is the distinctive inflated rectangle of a television screen. What the hell. This is America, Hiro is half American, and there\u0027s no reason to take this politeness thing to an unhealthy extreme. He hauls the door open and looks into the back of the limousine. Sushi K is sitting there, wedged in between a couple of other young Nipponese men, programmers on his imageering team. His hairdo is turned off, so it just looks like an orange Afro. He is wearing a partly assembled stage costume, apparently expecting to be performing tonight. Looks like he\u0027s taking Hiro up on his offer. He\u0027s watching a well-known television program called Eye Spy. It is produced by CIC and syndicated through one of the major studios. It is reality television: CIC picks out one of their agents who is involved in a wet operation -- doing some actual cloak-and-dagger work and has him put on a gargoyle rig so that everything he sees and hears is transmitted back to the home base in Langley. This material is then edited into a weekly hour-long program. Hiro never watches it. Now that he works for CIC, he finds it kind of annoying. But he hears a lot of gossip about the show, and he knows that tonight they are showing the second-to-last episode in a five-part arc. CIC has smuggled a guy onto the Raft, where he is trying to infiltrate one of its many colorful and sadistic pirate bands: the Bruce Lee organization. Hiro enters the limousine and gets a look at the TV just in time to see Bruce Lee himself, as seen from the point of view of the hapless gargoyle spy, approaching down some dank corridor on a Raft ghost ship. Condensation is dripping from the blade of Bruce Lee\u0027s samurai sword. \"Bruce Lee\u0027s men have trapped the spy in an old Korean factory ship in the Core,\" one of Sushi K\u0027s henchmen says, a rapid hissing explanation. \"They are looking for him now.\" Suddenly, Bruce Lee is pinioned under a brilliant spotlight that makes his trademark diamond grin flash like the arm of a galaxy. In the middle of the screen, a pair of cross hairs swing into place, centered on Bruce Lee\u0027s forehead. Apparently, the spy has decided he must fight his way out of this mess and is bringing some powerful CIC weapons system to bear on Bruce Lee\u0027s skull. But then a blur comes in from the side, a mysterious dark shape blocking our view of Bruce Lee. The cross hairs are now centered on -- what, exactly? We\u0027ll have to wait until next week to find out. Hiro sits down across from Sushi K and the programmers, next to the television set, so that he can get a TV\u0027s-eye view of the man. \"I\u0027m Hiro Protagonist. You got my message, I take it.\" \"Fabul\" Sushi K cries, using the Nipponese abbreviation of the all-purpose Hollywood adjective \"fabulous.\" He continues, \"Hiro-san, I am deeply indebted to you for this once-in-a-lifetime chance to perform my small works before such an audience.\" He says the whole thing in Nipponese except for \"once-in-a-lifetime chance.\" \"I must humbly apologize for arranging the whole thing so hastily and haphazardly,\" Hiro says. \"It pains me deeply that you should feel the need to apologize when you have given me an opportunity that any Nipponese rapper would give anything for -- to perform my humble works before actual homeboys from the ghettos of L.A.\" \"I am profoundly embarrassed to reveal that these fans are not exactly ghetto homeboys, as I must have carelessly led you to believe. They are thrashers. Skateboarders who like both rap music and heavy metal.\" \"Ah. This is fine, then,\" Sushi K says. But his tone of voice suggests that it\u0027s not really fine at all. \"But there are representatives of the Crips here,\" Hiro says, thinking very, very fast even by his standards, \"and if your performance is well received, as I\u0027m quite certain it will be, they will spread the word throughout their community.\" Sushi K rolls down the window. The decibel level quintuples in an instant. He stares at the crowd, five thousand potential market shares, young people with funkiness on their minds. They\u0027ve never heard any music before that wasn\u0027t perfect. It\u0027s either studio-perfect digital sound from their CD players or performance-perfect fuzz-grunge from the best people in the business, the groups that have come to L.A. to make a name for themselves and have actually survived the gladiatorial combat environment of the clubs. Sushi K\u0027s face lights up with a combination of joy and terror. Now he actually has to go up there and do it. In front of the seething biomass. Hiro goes out and paves the way for him. That\u0027s easy enough. Then he bails. He\u0027s done his bit. No point in wasting time on this puny Sushi K thing when Raven is out there, representing a much larger source of income. So he wanders back out toward the periphery. \"Yo! Dude with the swords,\" someone says. Hiro turns around, sees a green-jacketed Enforcer motioning to him. It\u0027s the short, powerful guy with the headset, the guy in charge of the security detail. \"Squeaky,\" he says, extending his hand. \"Hiro,\" Hiro says, shaking it, and handing over his business card. No particular reason to be coy with these guys. \"What can I do for you, Squeaky?\" Squeaky reads the card. He has a kind of exaggerated politeness that is kind of like a military man. He\u0027s calm, mature, rolemodelesque, like a high school football coach. \"You in charge of this thing?\" \"To the extent anyone is.\" \"Mr.Protagonist, we got a call a few minutes ago from a friend of yours named Y.T.\" \"What\u0027s wrong? Is she okay?\" \"Oh, yes, sir, she\u0027s just fine. But you know that bug you were talking to earlier?\" Hiro\u0027s never heard the term \"bug\" used this way, but he reckons that Squeaky is referring to the gargoyle, Lagos. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, there\u0027s a situation involving that gentleman that Y.T. sort of tipped us off to. We thought you might want to have a look.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"Uh, why don\u0027t you come with me. You know, some things are easier to show than to explain verbally.\" As Squeaky turns, Sushi K\u0027s first rap song begins. His voice sounds tight and tense. I\u0027m Sushi K and I\u0027m here to say I like to rap in a different way Look out Number One in every city Sushi K rap has all most pretty My special talking of remarkable words Is not the stereotyped bucktooth nerd My hair is big as a galaxy Cause I attain greater technology Hiro follows Squeaky away from the crowd, into the dimly lit area on the edge of the shantytown. Up above them on the overpass embankment, he can dimly make out phosphorescent shapes -- green-jacketed Enforcers orbiting some strange attractor. \"Watch your step,\" Squeaky says as they begin to climb up the embankment. \"It\u0027s slippery in places.\" I like to rap about sweetened romance My fond ambition is of your pants So here is of special remarkable way Of this fellow raps named Sushi K The Nipponese talking phenomenon Like samurai sword his sharpened tongue Who raps the East Asia and the Pacific Prosperity Sphere, to be specific It\u0027s a typical loose slope of dirt and stones that looks like it would wash away in the first rainfall. Sage and cactus and tumble-weeds here and there, all looking scraggly and half-dead from air pollution. It\u0027s hard to see anything clearly, because Sushi K is jumping around down below them on the stage, the brilliant orange rays of his sunburst hairdo are sweeping back and forth across the embankment at a speed that seems to be supersonic, washing grainy, gritty light over the weeds and the rocks and throwing everything into weird, discolored, high-contrast freeze frames. Sarariman on subway listen For Sushi K like nuclear fission Fire-breathing lizard Gojiro He my always big-time hero His mutant rap burn down whole block Start investing now Sushi K stock It on Nikkei stock exchange Waxes; other rappers wane Best investment, make my day Corporation Sushi K Squeaky is walking straight uphill, paralleling a fresh motorcycle track that has cut deeply into the loose yellow soil. It consists of a deep, wide track with a narrower one that runs parallel, a couple of feet to the right. The track gets deeper the farther up they go. Deeper and darker. It looks less and less like a motorcycle rut in loose dirt and more like a drainage ditch for some sinister black effluent. Coming to America now Rappers trying to start a row Say \"Stay in Japan, please, listen! We can\u0027t handle competition!\" U.S. rappers booing and hissin\u0027 Ask for rap protectionism They afraid of Sushi K Cause their audience go away He got chill financial backin\u0027 Give those U.S. rappers a smackin\u0027 Sushi K concert machine Fast efficient super clean Run like clockwork in a watch Kick old rappers in the crotch One of The Enforcers up the hill is carrying a flashlight. As he moves, it sweeps across the ground at a flat angle, briefly illuminating the ground like a searchlight. For an instant, the light shines into the motorcycle rut, and Hiro perceives that it has become a river of bright red, oxygenated blood. He learn English total immersion English/Japanese be mergin\u0027 Into super combination So can have fans in every nation Hong Kong they speak English, too Yearn of rappers just like you Anglophones who live down under Sooner later start to wonder When they get they own rap star Tired of rappers from afar Lagos is lying on the ground, sprawled across the tire track. He has been slit open like a salmon, with a single smooth-edged cut that begins at his anus and runs up his belly, through the middle of his sternum, all the way up to the point of his jaw. It\u0027s not just a superficial slash. It appears to go all the way to his spine in some places. The black nylon straps that hold his computer system to his body have been neatly cut where they cross the midline, and half of the stuff has fallen off into the dust. So I will get big radio traffic When you look at demographic Sushi K research statistic Make big future look ballistic Speed of Sushi K growth stock Put U.S. rappers into shock Jason Breckenridge wears a terracotta blazer. It is the color of Sicily. Jason Breckinridge has never been to Sicily. He may get to go there someday, as a premium. In order to get the free cruise to Sicily, Jason has to accumulate 10,000 Goombata Points. He begins this quest in a favorable position. By opening up his own Nova Sicilia franchise, he started out with an automatic 3,333 points in the Goombata Point bank. Add to that a one-time-only Citizenship Bonus of 500 points and the balance is starting to look pretty good. The number is stored in the big computer in Brooklyn. Jason grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, one of the most highly franchised regions in the country. He attended the University of Illinois business school, racking up a CPA of 2.9567, and did a senior thesis called \"The Interaction of the Ethnographic, Financial, and Paramilitary Dimensions of Competition in Certain Markets.\" This was a case study of turf struggle between Nova Sicilia and Narcolombia franchises in his old neighborhood in Aurora. Enrique Cortazar ran the failing Narcolombia franchise upon which Jason had hinged his argument. Jason interviewed him several times over the phone, briefly, but never saw Mr.Cortazar face to face. Mr.Cortazar celebrated Jason\u0027s graduation by firebombing the Breckinridges\u0027 Omni Horizon van in a parking lot and then firing eleven clips of automatic rifle ammunition through the front wall of their house. Fortunately, Mr.Caruso, who ran the local string of Nova Sicilia franchulates that was in the process of beating the pants off of Enrique Cortazar, got wind of these attacks before they happened, probably by intercepting signal intelligence from Mr.Cortazar\u0027s fleet of poorly secured cellular phones and CB radios. He was able to warn Jason\u0027s family in time, so that when all of those bullets flew through their house in the middle of the night, they were enjoying complimentary champagne in an Old Sicilia Inn five miles down Highway 96. Naturally, when the B-school held its end-of-the-year job fair, Jason made a point of swinging by the Nova Sicilia booth to thank Mr.Caruso for saving everyone in his family from certain death. \"Hey, y\u0027know, it was just, like a neighbor kinds thing, y\u0027know, Jasie boy?\" Mr.Caruso said, whacking Jason across the shoulder blades and squeezing his deltoids, which were the size of cantaloupes. Jason did not hit the steroids as hard as he had when he was fifteen, but he was still in great shape. Mr.Caruso was from New York. He had one of the most popular booths at the job fair. It was being held in a big exhibition space in the Union. The hall had been done up with an imaginary street pattern. Two \"highways\" divided it up into quadrants, and all the franchise companies and nationalities had their booths along the highways. Burbclaves and other companies had booths hidden among the suburban \"streets\" within the quadrants. Mr.Caruso\u0027s Nova Sicilia booth was right at the intersection of the two highways. Dozens of scrubby B-school grads were lined up there waiting to interview, but Mr.Caruso noticed Jason standing in line and went right up and plucked him out of line and grabbed his deltoids. All the other B-school grads stared at Jason enviously. That made Jason feel good, really special. That was the feeling he got about Nova Sicilia: personalized attention. \"Well, I was going to interview here, of course, and at Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong, because I\u0027m real interested in high tech,\" Jason said, in response to Mr.Caruso\u0027s fatherly questioning. Mr.Caruso gave him an especially hard squeeze. His voice said that he was painfully surprised, but that he didn\u0027t necessarily think any less of Jason for it, not yet anyway. \"Hong Kong? What would a smart white kid like you want with a fuckin\u0027 Nip operation?\" \"Well, technically they\u0027re not Nips -- which is short for Nipponese,\" Jason said. \"Hong Kong is a predominantly Cantonese -- \" \"They\u0027re all Nips,\" Mr.Caruso said, \"and y\u0027know why I say that? Not because I\u0027m a fuckin\u0027 racist, because I\u0027m not. Because to them -- to those people, y\u0027know, the Nips -- we\u0027re all foreign devils. That\u0027s what they call us. Foreign devils. How d\u0027ya like that?\" Jason just laughed appreciatively. \"After all the good things we did for them. But here in America, Jasie boy, we\u0027re all foreign devils, ain\u0027t we? We all came from someplace -- \u0027cept for the fuckin\u0027 Indians. You ain\u0027t gonna interview over at the Lakota Nation, are ya?\" \"No, sir, Mr.Caruso,\" Jason said. \"Good thinkin\u0027. I agree with that. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 away from my main point, which is that since we all have our own unique ethnic and cultural identities, we have to get a job with an organization that uniquely respects and seeks to preserve those distinctive identities -- forging them together into a functionin\u0027 whole, y\u0027know?\" \"Yes, I see your point, Mr.Caruso,\" Jason said. By this point, Mr.Caruso had led him some distance away and was strolling with him down one of the metaphorical Highways o\u0027 Opportunity. \"Now, can you think of some business organizations that fill that fuckin\u0027 bill, Jasie boy?\" \"Well. \" \"Not fuckin\u0027 Hong Kong. That\u0027s for white people who want to be Japs but can\u0027t, didja know that? You don\u0027t wants be a Jap, do ya?\" \"Ha ha. No, sir, Mr.Caruso.\" \"Y\u0027know what I heard?\" Mr.Caruso let go of Jason, turned, and stood close to him, chest to chest, his cigar zinging past Jason\u0027s ear like a flaming arrow as he gesticulated. This was a confidential portion of the chat, a little anecdote between the two men. \"In Japan, if you screw up? You gotta cut off one a your fingers. Chop. Just like that. Honest to God. You don\u0027t believe me?\" \"I believe you. But that\u0027s not all of Japan, sir, Just in the Yakuza. The Japanese Mafia.\" Mr.Caruso threw back his head and laughed, put his arm around Jason\u0027s shoulders again. \"Y\u0027know, I like you, Jason, I really do,\" he said. \"The Japanese Mafia. Tell me something, Jason, you ever hear anyone describe our thing as \u0027The Sicilian Yakuza\u0027? Huh?\" Jason laughed. \"No, sir.\" \"Y\u0027know why that is? Y\u0027know?\" Mr.Caruso had come to the serious, meaningful part of his speech. \"Why is that, sir?\" Mr.Caruso wheeled Jason around so that both of them were staring down the length of the highway to the tall effigy of Uncle Enzo, standing above the intersection like the Statue of Liberty. \"Cause there\u0027s only one, son. Only one. And you could be a part of it,\" \"But it\u0027s so competitive -- \" \"What? Listen to this! You got a three-point grade average! You\u0027re gonna kick butt, son!\" Mr.Caruso, like any other franchisee, had access to Turfnet, the multiple listing service that Nova Sicilia used to keep track of what it called \"opportunity zones.\" He took Jason back to the booth -- right past all of those poor dorks waiting in line, Jason really liked that -- and signed onto the network, All Jason had to do was pick out a region. \"I have an uncle who owns a car dealership in southern California,\" Jason said, \"and I know that\u0027s a rapidly expanding area, and -- \" \"Plenty of opportunity zones!\" Mr.Caruso said, pounding away on the keyboard with a flourish. He wheeled the monitor around to show Jason a map of the L.A. area blazing with red splotches that represented unclaimed turf sectors, \"Take your pick, Jasie boy!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/696.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
