{"id":21029,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 55","content":"It\u0027s pretty obvious which warehouse we are looking for here. Fourth one on the left, the road that runs down toward the waterfront is blocked off by several shipping containers -- the big steel boxes you see on the backs of eighteen-wheelers. They are arranged in a herringbone pattern, so that in order to get past them you have to slalom back and forth half a dozen times, passing through a narrow mazelike channel between high walls of steel. Guys with guns are perched on top, looking down at Y.T. as she guides her plank through the obstacle course. By the time she makes it out into the clear, she\u0027s been heavily checked out. There is the occasional light-bulb-on-a-wire strung around, and even a couple of strings of Christmas-tree lights. These are switched on, just to make her feel a little more welcome. She can\u0027t see anything, just lights making colored halos amid a generalized cloud of dust and fog. In front of her, access to the waterfront is blocked off by another maze of shipping containers. One of them has a graffiti sign: THE UKOD SEZ: TRY SOME COUNTDOWN TODAY! \"What\u0027s the UKOD?\" she says, just to break the ice a little. \"Undisputed King of the Ozone Destroyers,\" says a man\u0027s voice. He is just in the act of jumping down from the loading dock of the warehouse to her left. Back inside the warehouse, Y.T. can see electric lights and glowing cigarettes. \"That\u0027s what we call Emilio.\" \"Oh, right,\" Y.T. says. \"The Freon guy. I\u0027m not here for Chill.\" \"Well,\" says the guy, a tall rangy dude in his forties, much too skinny to be forty years old. He yanks the butt of a cigarette from his mouth and throws it away like a dart. \"What\u0027ll it be, then?\" \"What does Snow Crash cost?\" \"One point seven five Gippers,\" the guy says. \"I thought it was one point five,\" Y.T. says. The guy shakes his head. \"Inflation, you know. Still, it\u0027s a bargain. Hell, that plank you\u0027re on is probably worth a hundred Gippers.\" \"You can\u0027t even buy these for dollars,\" Y.T. says, getting her back up. \"Look, all I\u0027ve got is one-and-a-half quadrillion dollars.\" She pulls the bundle out of her pocket. The guy laughs, shakes his head, hollers back to his colleagues inside the warehouse. \"You guys, we got a chick here who wants to pay in Meeses.\" \"Better get rid of \u0027em fast, honey,\" says a sharper, nastier voice, \"or get yourself a wheelbarrow.\" It\u0027s an even older guy with a bald head, curly hair on the sides, and a paunch. He\u0027s standing up on the loading dock. \"If you\u0027re not going to take it, just say so,\" Y.T. says. All of this chatter has nothing to do with business. \"We don\u0027t get chicks back here very often,\" the fat bald old guy says. Y.T. knows that this must be the UKOD himself. \"So we\u0027ll give you a discount for being spunky. Turn around.\" \"Fuck you,\" Y.T. says. She\u0027s not going to turn around for this guy. Everyone within earshot laughs. \"Okay, do it,\" the UKOD says. The tall skinny guy goes back over to the loading dock and hauls an aluminum briefcase down, sets it on top of a steel drum in the middle of the road so that it\u0027s at about waist height. \"Pay first,\" he says. She hands him the Meeses. He examines the bundle, sneers, throws it back into the warehouse with a sudden backhand motion. All the guys inside laugh some more. He opens up the briefcase, revealing the little computer keyboard. He shoves his ID card into the slot, types on it for a couple of seconds. He unsnaps a tube from the top of the briefcase, places it into the socket in the bottom part. The machine draws it inside, does something, spits it back out. He hands the tube to Y.T. The red numbers on top are counting down from ten. \u0027When it gets down to one, hold it up to your nose and start inhaling,\" the guy says. She\u0027s already backing away from him. \"You got a problem, little girl?\" he says. \"Not yet,\" she says. Then she throws the tube up in the air as hard as she can. The chop of the rotor blades comes out of nowhere. The Whirlwind Reaper blurs over their heads; everyone crouches for an instant as surprise buckles their knees. The tube does not come back to earth. \"You fucking bitch,\" the skinny guy says. \"That was a really cool plan,\" the UKOD says, \"but the part I can\u0027t figure out is, why would a nice, smart girl like you participate in a suicide mission?\" The sun comes out. About half a dozen suns, actually, all around them up in the air, so that there are no shadows. The faces of the skinny man and the UKOD look flat and featureless under this blinding illumination. Y.T. is the only person who can see worth a damn because her Knight Visions have compensated for it; the men wince and sag beneath the light. Y.T. turns to look behind herself. One of the miniature suns is hanging above the maze of shipping containers, casting light into all its crannies, blinding the gunmen who stand guard there. The scene flashes too light and too dark as her goggles\u0027 electronics try to make up their mind. But in the midst of this whole visual tangle she gets one image printed indelibly on her retina: the gunmen going down like a treeline in a hurricane, and for just an instant, a line of dark angular things silhouetted above the maze as they crest it like a cybernetic tsunami. Rat Things. They have evaded the whole maze by leaping over it in long, flat parabolas. Along the way, some of them have slammed right through the bodies of men holding guns, like NFL fullbacks plowing full speed through nerdy sideline photographers. Then, as they land on the road in front of the maze, there is an instant burst of dust with frantic white sparks dancing around at the bottom, and while all this is happening, Y.T. doesn\u0027t hear, she feels one of the Rat Things impacting on the body of the tall skinny guy, hears his ribs crackling like a ball of cellophane. Hell is already breaking loose inside the warehouse, but her eyes are trying to follow the action, watching the sparks-and-dust contrails of more Rat Things drawing themselves down the length of the road in an instant and then going airborne to the top of the next barrier. Three seconds have passed since she threw the tube into the air. She is turning back to look inside the warehouse. But someone\u0027s on top of the warehouse, catching her eye for a second. It\u0027s another gunman, a sniper, stepping out from behind an air-conditioning unit, just getting used to the light, raising his weapon to his shoulder. Y.T. winces as a red laser beam from his rifle sweeps across her eyes once, twice as he zeroes his sights on her forehead. Behind him she sees the Whirlwind Reaper, its rotors making a disk under the brilliant light, a disk that is foreshortened into a narrow ellipse and then into a steady silver line. Then it flies right past the sniper. The chopper pulls up into a hard turn, searching for additional prey, and something falls beneath it in a powerless trajectory, she thinks that it has dropped a bomb. But it\u0027s the head of the sniper, spinning rapidly, throwing out a fine pink helix under the light. The little chopper\u0027s rotor blade must have caught him in the nape of the neck. One part of her is dispassionately watching the head bounce and spin in the dust, and the other part of her is screaming her lungs out. She hears a crack, the first loud noise so far. She turns to follow the sound, looking in the direction of a water tower that looms above this area, providing a fine vantage point for a sniper. But then her attention is drawn by the pencil-thin blue-white exhaust of a tiny rocket that lances up into the sky from Ng\u0027s van. It doesn\u0027t do anything; it just goes up to a certain height and hovers, sitting on its exhaust. She doesn\u0027t care, she\u0027s kicking her way down the road now on her plank, trying to get something between her and that water tower. There is a second cracking noise. Before this sound even reaches her ears, the rocket darts horizontally like a minnow, makes one or two minor cuts to correct its course, zeroes in on that sniper\u0027s perch, up in the water tower\u0027s access ladder. There is a great nasty explosion without any flame or light, like the loud pointless booms that you get sometimes at fireworks shows. For a moment, she can hear the clamor of shrapnel ringing through the ironwork of the water tower. Just before she kicks her way back into the maze, a dustline whips past her, snapping rocks and fragments of broken glass into her face. It shoots into the maze. She hears it Ping-Pong all the way through, kicking off the steel walls in order to change direction. It\u0027s a Rat Thing clearing the way for her. How sweet!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/720.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
