{"id":21003,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"Raven makes a couple of broad, lazy sweeps along the perimeter of the crowd, going very slowly, looking in all directions. He is annoyingly calm and unhurried.\\n\\n Then he cuts farther out into the darkness, away from the crowd. He does a little more looking around, checking out the perimeter of the shantytown. And finally, he swings the big Harley around in a trajectory that brings him back to the big important Crip. The guy with the sapphire tie clip and the personal security detail.\\n\\n Hiro begins weaving through the crowd in that direction, trying not to be too obvious about it. This looks like it\u0027s going to be interesting.\\n\\n As Raven approaches, the bodyguards converge on the head Crip, form a loose protective ring around him. As he comes nearer, all of them back away a step or two, as though the man is surrounded by an invisible force field. He finally comes to a stop, deigns to put his feet on the ground. He flicks a few switches on the handlebars before he steps away from his Harley. Then, anticipating what\u0027s next, he stands with his feet apart and his arms up.\\n\\n One Crip approaches from each side. They don\u0027t look real happy about this particular duty, they keep casting sidelong glances at the motorcycle. The head Crip keeps goading them forward with his voice, shooing them toward Raven with his hands. Each one of them has a hand-held metal-detecting wand. They swirl the wands around his body and find nothing at all, not even the tiniest speck of metal, not even coins in his pocket. The man is 100 percent organic. So if nothing else, Lagos\u0027s warning about Raven\u0027s knife has turned out to be bullshit.\\n\\n These two Crips walk rapidly back to the main group. Raven begins to follow them. But the head Crip takes a step back, holds both of his hands up in a \"stop\" motion. Raven stops, stands there, the grin returning to his face.\\n\\n The head Crip turns away and gestures back toward his black BMW. The rear door of the BMW opens up and a man gets out, a younger, smaller black man in round wire-rims, wearing jeans and big white athletic shoes and typical studentish gear.\\n\\n The student walks slowly toward Raven, pulling something from his pocket. It\u0027s a hand-held device, but much too bulky to be a calculator. It\u0027s got a keypad on the top and a sort of window on one end, which the student keeps aiming toward Raven. There\u0027s an LED readout above the keypad and a red flashing light underneath that. The student is wearing a pair of headphones that are jacked into a socket on the butt of the device.\\n\\n For starters, the student aims the window at the ground, then at the sky, then at Raven, keeping his eye on the flashing red light and the LED readout. It has the feel of some kind of religious rite, accepting digital input from the sky spirit and then the ground spirit and then from the black biker angel.\\n\\n Then he begins to walk slowly toward Raven, one step at a time. Hiro can see the red light flashing intermittently, not following any particular pattern or rhythm.\\n\\n The student gets to within a yard of Raven and then orbits him a couple of times, always keeping the device aimed inward. When he\u0027s finished, he steps back briskly, turns, and aims it toward the motorcycle. When the device is aimed at the motorcycle, the red light flashes much more quickly.\\n\\n The student walks up to the head Crip, pulling off his headphones, and has a short conversation with him. The Crip listens to the student but keeps his eyes fixed on Raven, nods his head a few times, finally pats the student on his shoulder and sends him back to the BMW.\\n\\n It was a Geiger counter.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/694.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
