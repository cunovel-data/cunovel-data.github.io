{"id":21011,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"Y.T. reckons she is going to spend all afternoon being a ramp turd. The surf is always up on the Harbor Freeway, which gets her from Downtown into Compton, but the off-ramps into that neighborhood are so rarely used that three-foot tumbleweeds grow in their potholes. And she\u0027s definitely not going to travel into Compton under her own power. She wants to poon something big and fast. She can\u0027t use the standard trick of ordering a pizza to her destination and then pooning the delivery boy as he roars past, because none of the pizza chains deliver to this neighborhood. So she\u0027ll have to stop at the off-ramp and wait hours and hours for a ride. A ramp turd.\\n\\n She does not want to do this delivery at all. But the franchisee wants her to do it bad. Really bad. The amount of money he has offered her is so high, it\u0027s stupid. The package must be full of some kind of intense new drug.\\n\\n But that\u0027s not as weird as what happens next. She is cruising down the Harbor Freeway, approaching the desired off-ramp, having pooned a southbound semi. A quarter-mile from the off-ramp, a bullet-pocked black Oldsmobile cruises past her, right-turn signal flashing. He\u0027s going to exit. It\u0027s too good to be true. She poons the Oldsmobile.\\n\\n As she cruises down the ramp behind this flatulent sedan, she checks out the driver in his rearview mirror. It is the franchisee himself, the one who is paying her a totally stupid amount of money to do this job.\\n\\n By this point, she\u0027s more afraid of him than she is of Compton.\\n\\n He must be a psycho. He must be in love with her. This is all a twisted psycho love plot.\\n\\n But it\u0027s a little late now. She stays with him, looking for a way out of this burning and rotting neighborhood.\\n\\n They are approaching a big, nasty-looking Mafia roadblock. He guns the gas pedal, headed straight for death. She can see the destination franchise ahead. At the last second, he whips the car around and squeals sideways to a halt.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t have been more helpful. She unpoons as he\u0027s giving her this last little kick of energy and sails through the checkpoint at a safe and sane speed. The guards keep their guns pointed at the sky, swivel their heads to look at her butt as she rolls past them.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/702.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
