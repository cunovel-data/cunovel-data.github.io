{"id":21064,"no":90,"title":"Chapter 90","content":"When her partner is off doing something in Reality, his avatar goes kind of slack. The body sits there like an inflatable love doll, and the face continues to go through all kinds of stretching exercises. She does not know what he\u0027s doing, but it looks like it must be exciting, because most of the time he\u0027s either extremely surprised or scared shitless.\\n\\n Shortly after he gets done talking to the Librarian dude about the aircraft carrier, she begins to hear deep rumbling noises -- Reality noises -- from outside. Sounds like a cross between a machine gun and a buzz saw. Whenever she hears that noise, Hiro\u0027s face gets this astonished look like: I\u0027m about to die. Someone is tapping her on the shoulder. Some suit who has an early morning appointment in the Metaverse, figures that whatever this Kourier is doing can\u0027t be all that important. She ignores it for a minute.\\n\\n Then Hiro\u0027s office goes out of focus, jumps up in the air like it is painted on a window shade, and she\u0027s looking into the face of a guy. An Asian guy. A creep. A wirehead. One of the scary antenna dudes.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she says, \"what do you want?\"\\n\\n He grabs her by the arm and hauls her out of the booth. There\u0027s another one with him, and he grabs her other arm. They all start walking out of there.\\n\\n \"Let go my fucking arm,\" she says. \"I\u0027ll go with you. It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s not the first time she\u0027s been thrown out of a building full of suits. This time it\u0027s a little different, though. This time, the bouncers are a couple of life-sized plastic action figures from Toys R Us.\\n\\n And it\u0027s not just that these guys probably don\u0027t speak English. They just don\u0027t act normal. She actually manages to twist one of her arms loose and the guy doesn\u0027t smack her or anything, just turns rigidly toward her and paws at her mechanically until he\u0027s got her by the arm again. No change in his face. His eyes stare like busted headlights. His mouth is open enough to let him breathe through it, but the lips never move, never change expression.\\n\\n They are in a complex of ship cabins and sliced-open containers that acts as the lobby of the hotel. The wireheads drag her out the door, over the blunt cross hairs of the helipad. Just in time, too, because a chopper happens to be coming in for a landing. The safety procedures in this place suck -- they could have got their heads chopped off. It is the slick corporate chopper with the RARE logo that she saw earlier.\\n\\n The wireheads try to drag her over a gangplank thingy that leads them across open water to the next ship. She manages to get turned around backward, grabs the railings with both hands, hooks her ankles into the stanchions, and hangs on. One of them grabs her around the waist from behind and tries to yank her body loose while the other one stands in front of her and pries her fingers loose, one at a time.\\n\\n Several guys are piling out of the RARE chopper. They are wearing coveralls with gear stuck into the pockets, and she sees at least one stethoscope. They haul big fiberglass cases out of the chopper, with red crosses painted on their sides, and run into the containership. Y.T. knows that this is not being done for the benefit of some fat businessman who stroked a lobe over his stewed prunes. They are going in there to reanimate her boyfriend. Raven pumped full of speed: just what the world needs right now.\\n\\n They drag her across the deck of the next ship. From there they take a stairway thingy up to the next ship after that, which is very big. She thinks it\u0027s an oil tanker. She can look across its broad deck, through a tangle of pipes, rust seeping through white paint, and see the Enterprise on the other side. That\u0027s where they\u0027re going.\\n\\n There\u0027s no direct connection. A crane on the deck of the Enterprise has swung itself over to dangle a small wire cage over the tanker, just a few feet off the deck -- it bobs up and down and glides back and forth over a fairly large area as the two ships rock in different ways and it swings like a pendulum at the end of its cable. It has a door on one side, which is hanging open.\\n\\n They sort of toss her into it head first, keeping her arms pinned to her sides so she can\u0027t push it away from her, and then they spend a few seconds folding her legs in behind her. It\u0027s obvious by now that talking doesn\u0027t work, so she just fights silently. She manages to give one of them a good stomp to the bridge of the nose, and both feels and hears the bone break, but the man doesn\u0027t react in any way, other than snapping his head back on impact. She\u0027s so busy watching him, waiting to see when he\u0027s going to figure out that his nose is broken and that she\u0027s responsible for it, that she stops kicking and flailing long enough to get all shoved into the cage. Then the door snaps shut.\\n\\n An experienced raccoon could get the latch open. This cage isn\u0027t made to hold people. But by the time she gets her body worked around to the point where she can reach it, she\u0027s twenty feet above the deck, looking down on a lead of black water between the tanker and the Enterprise. Down below, she can see an abandoned zodiac caroming back and forth between the steel walls.\\n\\n Not everything is exactly right on the Enterprise. Something is burning somewhere. People are firing guns. She\u0027s not entirely sure she wants to be there. As long as she is high up in the air, she reconnoiters the ship and confirms that there is no way off, no handy gangplanks or stairway thingies.\\n\\n She is being lowered toward the Enterprise. The cage is careening back and forth, skimming just over the deck on its cable, and when it finally touches the deck, it skids for a few feet before coming to a halt. She pops the latch and climbs out of there. Now what?\\n\\n There\u0027s a bullseye painted on the deck, a few helicopters parked around the edges and lashed down. And there is one helicopter, a mammoth twin-engine jet number, kind of a flying bathtub festooned with guns and missiles, sitting right in the middle of the bullseye, all of its lights on, engine whining, rotors spinning desultorily. A small cluster of men is standing next to it.\\n\\n Y.T. walks toward it. She hates this. She knows this is exactly what she\u0027s supposed to do. But there really is no other choice. She wishes, profoundly, that she had her plank with her. The deck of this aircraft carrier is some of the best skating territory she has ever seen. She has seen, in movies, that carriers have big steam catapults for throwing airplanes into the sky. Think of what it would be like to ride a steam catapult on your plank!\\n\\n As she is walking toward the helicopter, one of the men standing by it detaches himself from the group and walks toward her.\\n\\n He\u0027s big, with a body like a fifty-five-gallon drum, and a mustache that turns up at the corners. And as he comes toward her he is laughing in a satisfied way, which pisses her off.\\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t you look like a forlorn lil thang!\" he says. \"Shit, honey, you look like a drowned rat that got dried out again.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" she says. \"You look like chiseled Spam.\"\\n\\n \"Very funny,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Then how come you\u0027re not laughing? Afraid it\u0027s true?\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" he says, \"I don\u0027t have time for this fucking adolescent banter. I grew up and got old \u0027pecifically to get away from this.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that you don\u0027t have time,\" she says. \"It\u0027s that you\u0027re not very good at it.\"\\n\\n \"You know who I am?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know. You know who I am?\"\\n\\n \"Y.T. A fifteen-year-old Kourier.\"\\n\\n \"And personal buddy of Uncle Enzo,\" she says, whipping off the string of dog tags and tossing them. He holds out one hand, startled, and the chain whips around his fingers. He holds them up and reads them.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" he says, \"this is quite a little memento.\" He throws them back at her. \"I know you\u0027re buddies with Uncle Enzo. Otherwise I just woulda dunked you instead a bringing you here to my spread. And I frankly don\u0027t give a shit,\" he says, \"because by the time this day is through, either Uncle Enzo will be out of a job, or else I\u0027ll be, as you said, chiseled Spam. But I figure that the Big Wop will be a lot less likely to throw a Stinger through the turbine of my chopper there if he knows his little chiquita is on board.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not like that,\" Y.T. says. \"It\u0027s not a relationship where fucking is part of it.\" But she is chagrined to learn that the dog tags, after all this time, did not have any magical effect on the bad guys.\\n\\n Rife turns around and starts walking back to the chopper. After a few steps, he turns back and looks at her, just standing there, trying not to cry. \"You coming?\" he says.\\n\\n She looks at the chopper. A ticket off the Raft.\\n\\n \"Can I leave a note for Raven?\"\\n\\n \"Far as Raven is concerned, I think you already made your point -- haw haw haw. Come on, girl, we\u0027re wasting jet fuel over there -- that ain\u0027t good for the goddamn environment.\"\\n\\n She follows him to the chopper, climbs on board. It\u0027s warm and light inside here, with nice seats. Like coming in off a hard February day of thrashing the grittier highways and settling into a padded easy chair.\\n\\n \"Had the interior redone,\" Rife says. \"This is a big old Sov gunship and it wasn\u0027t made for comfort. But that\u0027s the price you pay for all that armor plating.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s two other guys in here. One is about fifty, sort of gaunt, big pores, wire-rimmed bifocals, carrying a laptop. A techie. The other is a bulky African-American with a gun. \"Y.T.,\" says the always polite L. Bob Rife, \"meet Frank Frost, my tech director, and Tony Michaels, my security chief.\"\\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am,\" says Tony.\\n\\n \"Howdy,\" says Frank.\\n\\n \"Suck my toes,\" says Y.T.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t step on that, please,\" Frank says.\\n\\n Y.T. looks down. Climbing into the empty seat nearest the door, she has stepped on a package resting on the floor. It\u0027s about the dimensions of a phone book, but irregular, very heavy, swaddled in bubble pack and clear plastic. She can see glimpses of what\u0027s inside. Light reddish brown in color. Covered with chicken scratches. Hard as a rock.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Y.T. says. \"Homemade bread from Mom?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an ancient artifact,\" Frank says, all pissed off. Rife chuckles, pleased and relieved that Y.T. is now insulting someone else.\\n\\n Another man duck-walks across the flight deck, in mortal fear of the whirling rotor blades, and climbs in. He\u0027s about sixty, with a dirigible of white hair that was not ruffled in any way by the downdraft.\\n\\n \"Hello, everyone,\" he says cheerfully. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve met all of you. Just got here this morning and now I\u0027m on my way back again!\"\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" Tony says.\\n\\n The new guy looks crestfallen. \"Greg Ritchie,\" he says.\\n\\n Then, when no one seems to react, he jogs their memory. \"President of the United States.\"\\n\\n \"Oh! Sorry. Nice to meet you, Mr.President,\" Tony says, extending his hand. \"Tony Michaels.\"\\n\\n \"Frank Frost,\" Frank says, extending his hand and looking bored.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind me,\" Y.T. says, when Ritchie looks her way. \"I\u0027m a hostage.\"\\n\\n \"Torque this baby,\" Rife says to the pilot. \"Let\u0027s go to L.A. We got a Mission to Control.\"\\n\\n The pilot has an angular face that, after her experiences on the Raft, Y.T. recognizes as typically Russian. He starts clicking with his controls. The engines whine louder and the thwacking of the chopper blades picks up. Y.T. feels, but does not hear, a couple of small explosions. Everyone else feels it, too, but only Tony reacts; he crouches down on the floor of the chopper, pulls a gun out from under his jacket, and opens the door on his side. Meanwhile, the engines sigh back down in pitch and the rotor coasts back down to an idle. Y.T. can see him out the window. It\u0027s Hiro. He\u0027s all covered with smoke and blood, and he\u0027s holding a pistol in one hand. He\u0027s just fired a couple of shots in the air, to get their attention, and now he backs behind one of the parked choppers, taking cover.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a dead man,\" Rife shouts. \"You\u0027re stuck on the Raft, asshole. I got a million Myrmidons here. You gonna kill \u0027em all?\"\\n\\n \"Swords don\u0027t run out of ammo,\" Hiro shouts.\\n\\n \"Well, what do you want?\"\\n\\n \"I want the tablet. You give me the tablet, then you can take off and let your million wireheads kill me. You don\u0027t give me the tablet, I\u0027m gonna empty this clip into the windshield of your chopper.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bulletproof! Haw!\" Rife says.\\n\\n \"No it isn\u0027t,\" Hiro says, \"as the rebels in Afghanistan found out.\"\\n\\n \"He is right,\" the pilot says.\\n\\n \"Fucking Soviet piece of shit! They put all that steel in its belly and then made the windshield out of glass?\"\\n\\n \"Give me the tablet,\" Hiro says, \"or I\u0027m taking it.\"\\n\\n \"No you ain\u0027t,\" Rife says, \u0027cause I got Tinkerbell here.\"\\n\\n At the last minute, Y.T. tries to duck down and hide, so he won\u0027t see her. She\u0027s ashamed. But Hiro locks eyes with her for just a moment, and she can see the defeat come into his face.\\n\\n She makes a dive for the door and gets halfway out, under the downblast of the rotors. Tony grabs her coverall\u0027s collar and hauls her back inside. He shoves her down on her belly and puts one knee in the small of her back to hold her there. Meanwhile, the engine is powering up again, and out the open door she can see the steel horizon of the carrier\u0027s deck drop from view.\\n\\n After all this time, she fucked up the plan. She owes Hiro a refund.\\n\\n Or maybe not.\\n\\n She puts the heel of one hand against the edge of the clay tablet and shoves as hard as she can. It slides across the floor, teeters on the threshold, and spins out of the chopper.\\n\\n Another delivery made, another satisfied customer.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/755.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
