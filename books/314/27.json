{"id":21001,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"This is a non sequitur that has been nibbling on the edges of Hiro\u0027s mind for the last ten minutes: Laser light has a particular kind of gritty intensity, a molecular purity reflecting its origins. Your eye notices this, somehow knows that it\u0027s unnatural. It stands out anywhere, but especially under a dirty overpass in the middle of the night. Hiro keeps getting flashes of it in his peripheral vision, keeps glancing over to track down its source. It\u0027s obvious to him, but no one else seems to notice.\n Someone in this overpass, somewhere, is bouncing a laser beam off Hiro\u0027s face. It\u0027s annoying. Without being too obvious about it, he changes his course slightly, wanders over to a point downwind of a trash fire that\u0027s burning in a steel drum. Now he\u0027s standing in the middle of a plume of diluted smoke that he can smell but can\u0027t quite see.\n But the next time the laser darts into his face, it scatters off a million tiny, ashy particulates and reveals itself as a pure geometric line in space, pointing straight back to its source.\n It\u0027s a gargoyle, standing in the dimness next to a shanty. Just in case he\u0027s not already conspicuous enough, he\u0027s wearing a suit. Hiro starts walking toward him. Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider, these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society. They are a boon to Hiro because they embody the worst stereotype of the CIC stringer. They draw all of the attention. The payoff for this self-imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.\n The CIC brass can\u0027t stand these guys because they upload staggering quantities of useless information to the database, on the off chance that some of it will eventually be useful. It\u0027s like writing down the license number of every car you see on your way to work each morning, just in case one of them will be involved in a hit-and-run accident. Even the CIC database can only hold so much garbage. So, usually, these habitual gargoyles get kicked out of CIC before too long.\n This guy hasn\u0027t been kicked out yet. And to judge from the quality of his equipment -- which is very expensive -- he\u0027s been at it for a while. So he must be pretty good.\n If so, what\u0027s he doing hanging around this place?\n \"Hiro Protagonist,\" the gargoyle says as Hiro finally tracks him down in the darkness beside a shanty. \"CIC stringer for eleven months. Specializing in the Industry. Former hacker, security guard, pizza deliverer, concert promoter.\" He sort of mumbles it, not wanting Hiro to waste his time reciting a bunch of known facts.\n The laser that kept jabbing Hiro in the eye was shot out of this guy\u0027s computer, from a peripheral device that sits above his goggles in the middle of his forehead. A long-range retinal scanner. If you turn toward him with your eyes open, the laser shoots out, penetrates your iris, tenderest of sphincters, and scans your retina. The results are shot back to CIC, which has a database of several tens of millions of scanned retinas. Within a few seconds, if you\u0027re in the database already, the owner finds out who you are. If you\u0027re not already in the database, well, you are now.\n Of course, the user has to have access privileges. And once he gets your identity, he has to have more access privileges to find out personal information about you. This guy, apparently, has a lot of access privileges. A lot more than Hiro.\n \"Name\u0027s Lagos,\" the gargoyle says.\n So this is the guy. Hiro considers asking him what the hell he\u0027s doing here. He\u0027d love to take him out for a drink, talk to him about how the Librarian was coded. But he\u0027s pissed off. Lagos is being rude to him (gargoyles are rude by definition).\n \"You here on the Raven thing? Or just that fuzz-grunge tip you\u0027ve been working on for the last, uh, thirty-six days approximately?\" Lagos says.\n Gargoyles are no fun to talk to. They never finish a sentence. They are adrift in a laser-drawn world, scanning retinas in all directions, doing background checks on everyone within a thousand yards, seeing everything in visual light, infrared, millimeter. wave radar, and ultrasound all at once. You think they\u0027re talking to you, but they\u0027re actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes flying overhead. For all he knows, Lagos is standing there measuring the length of Hiro\u0027s cock through his trousers while they pretend to make conversation.\n \"You\u0027re the guy who\u0027s working with Juanita, right?\" Hiro says.\n \"Or she\u0027s working with me. Or something like that\"\n \"She said she wanted me to meet you.\"\n For several seconds Lagos is frozen. He\u0027s ransacking more data. Hiro wants to throw a bucket of water on him.\n \"Makes sense,\" he says. \"You\u0027re as familiar with the Metaverse as anyone. Freelance hacker -- that\u0027s exactly right.\"\n \"Exactly right for what? No one wants freelance hackers anymore.\"\n \"The corporate assembly-line hackers are suckers for infection. They\u0027re going to go down by the thousands, just like Sennacherib\u0027s army before the walls of Jerusalem,\" Lagos says.\n \"Infection? Sennacherib?\"\n \"And you can defend yourself in Reality, too -- that\u0027ll be good if you ever go up against Raven. Remember, his knives are as sharp as a molecule. They\u0027ll go through a bulletproof jacket like lingerie.\"\n \"Raven?\"\n \"You\u0027ll probably see him tonight. Don\u0027t mess with him.\"\n \"Okay,\" Hiro says. \"I\u0027ll look out for him.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I said,\" Lagos says. \"I said, don\u0027t mess with him.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"It\u0027s a dangerous world,\" Lagos says. \"Getting more dangerous all the time. So we don\u0027t want to upset the balance of terror. Just think about the Cold War.\"\n \"Yup.\" All Hiro wants to do now is walk away and never see this guy again, but he won\u0027t wind up the conversation.\n \"You\u0027re a hacker. That means you have deep structures to worry about, too.\"\n \"Deep structures?\"\n \"Neurolinguistic pathways in your brain. Remember the first time you learned binary code?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"You were forming pathways in your brain. Deep structures. Your nerves grow new connections as you use them -- the axons split and push their way between the dividing glial cells -- your bioware selfmodifies -- the software becomes part of the hardware. So now you\u0027re vulnerable -- all hackers are vulnerable -- to a nam-shub. We have to look out for each other.\"\n \"What\u0027s a nam-shub? Why am I vulnerable to it?\"\n \"Just don\u0027t stare into any bitmaps. Anyone try to show you a raw bitmap lately? Like, in the Metaverse?\"\n Interesting. \"Not to me personally, but now that you mention it, this Brandy came up to my friend -- \"\n \"A cult prostitute of Asherah. Trying to spread the disease. Which is synonymous with evil. Sound melodramatic? Not really. You know, to the Mesopotamians, there was no independent concept of evil. Just disease and ill health. Evil was a synonym for disease. So what does that tell you?\"\n Hiro walks away, the same way he walks away from psychotic street people who follow him down the street.\n \"It tells you that evil is a virus!\" Lagos calls after him. \"Don\u0027t let the nam-shub into your operating system!\"\n Juanita\u0027s working with this alien?\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/692.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
