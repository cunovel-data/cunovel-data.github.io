{"id":21040,"no":66,"title":"Chapter 66","content":"Y.T.\u0027s mom works in Fedland. She has parked her little car in her own little numbered slot, for which the Feds require her to pay about ten percent of her salary (if she doesn\u0027t like it she can take a taxi or walk) and walked up several levels of a blindingly lit reinforced-concrete helix in which most of the spaces -- the good spaces closer to the surface -- are reserved for people other than her, but empty. She always walks up the center of the ramp, between the rows of parked cars, so that the EBGOC boys won\u0027t think she\u0027s lurking, loitering, skulking, malingering, or smoking. Reaching the subterranean entrance of her building, she has taken all metal objects from her pockets and removed what little jewelry she\u0027s wearing and dumped them into a dirty plastic bowl and walked through the detector. Flashed her badge. Signed her name and noted down the digital time. Submitted to a frisking from an EBGOC girl. Annoying, but it sure beats a cavity search. They have a right to do a cavity search if they want. She got cavity searched every day for a month once, right after she had spoken up at a meeting and suggested that her supervisor might be on the wrong track with a major programming project. It was punitive and vicious, she knew it was, but she always wanted to give something back to her country, and whenever you work for the Feds you just accept the fact that there\u0027s going to be some politicking. And that as a low-level person you\u0027re going to bear the brunt. And later on, you climb the GS ladder, don\u0027t have to put up with as much shit. Far be it from her to quarrel with her supervisor. Her supervisor, Marietta, doesn\u0027t have an especially stellar CS level, but she does have access. She has connections. Marietta knows people who know people. Marietta has attended cocktail parties that were also attended by some people who, well, your eyes would bug out. She has passed the frisking with flying colors. Put the metal stuff back into her pockets. Climbed up half a dozen flights of stairs to her floor. The elevators here still work, but some very highly placed people in Fedland have let it be known -- nothing official, but they have ways of letting this stuff out -- that it is a duty to conserve energy. And the Feds are real serious about duty. Duty, loyalty, responsibility. The collagen that binds us into the United States of America. So the stairwells are filled with sweaty wool and clacking leather. If you took the elevator, no one would actually say anything, but it would be noticed. Noticed and written down and taken into account. People would look at you, glance you up and down, like, what happened, sprain your ankle? Taking the stairs is no problem. Feds don\u0027t smoke. Feds generally don\u0027t overeat. The health plan is very specific, contains major incentives, get too heavy or wheezy and, no one says anything about it -- which would be rude -- but you feel a definite pressure, a sense of not fitting in, as you walk across the sea of desks, eyes glance up to follow you, estimating the mass of your saddlebags, eyes darting back and forth between desks as, by consensus, your co-workers say to themselves, I wonder how much he or she is driving up our health plan premiums? So Y.T.\u0027s mom has clacked up the stairs in her black pumps and gone into her office, actually a large room with computer workstations placed across it in a grid. Used to be divided up by partitions, but the EBGOC boys didn\u0027t like it, said what would happen if there had to be an evacuation? All those partitions would impede the free flow of unhinged panic. So no more partitions. Just workstations and chairs. Not even any desktops. Desktops encourage the use of paper, which is archaic and reflects inadequate team spirit. What is so special about your work that you have to write it down on a piece of paper that only you get to see? That you have to lock it away inside a desk? When you\u0027re working for the Feds, everything you do is the property of the United States of America. You do your work on the computer. The computer keeps a copy of everything, so that if you get sick or something, it\u0027s all there where your co-workers and supervisors can get access to it. If you want to write little notes or make phone doodles, you\u0027re perfectly free to do that at home, in your spare time. And there\u0027s the question of interchangeability. Fed workers, like military people, are intended to be interchangeable parts. What happens if your workstation should break down? You\u0027re going to sit there and twiddle your thumbs until it gets fixed? No siree, you\u0027re going to move to a spare workstation and get to work on that. And you don\u0027t have that flexibility if you\u0027ve got half a ton of personal stuff cached inside of a desk, strewn around a desktop. So there is no paper in a Fed office. All the workstations are the same. You come in in the morning, pick one at random, sit down, and get to work. You could try to favor a particular station, try to sit there every day, but it would be noticed. Generally you pick the unoccupied workstation that\u0027s closest to the door. That way, whoever came in earliest sits closest, whoever came in latest is way in the back, for the rest of the day it\u0027s obvious at a glance who\u0027s on the ball in this office and who is -- as they whisper to each other in the bathrooms -- having problems. Not that it\u0027s any big secret, who comes in first. When you sign on to a workstation in the morning, it\u0027s not like the central computer doesn\u0027t notice that fact. The central computer notices just about everything. Keeps track of every key you hit on the keyboard, all day long, what time you hit it, down to the microsecond, whether it was the right key or the wrong key, how many mistakes you make and when you make them. You\u0027re only required to be at your workstation from eight to five, with a half-hour lunch break and two ten-minute coffee breaks, but if you stuck to that schedule it would definitely be noticed, which is why Y.T.\u0027s mom is sliding into the first unoccupied workstation and signing on to her machine at quarter to seven. Half a dozen other people are already here, signed on to workstations closer to the entrance, but this isn\u0027t bad. She can look forward to a reasonably stable career if she can keep up this sort of performance. The Feds still operate in Flatland. None of this three-dimensional stuff, no goggles, no stereo sound. The computers are all basic flat-screen two-dimensional numbers. Windows appear on the desktop, with little text documents inside. All part of the austerity program. Soon to reap major benefits. She signs on and checks her mail. No personal mail, just a couple of mass-distributed pronouncements from Marietta. NEW TP POOL REGULATIONS I\u0027ve been asked to distribute the new regulations regarding office pool displays. The enclosed memo is a new subchapter of the EBGOC Procedure Manual, replacing the old subchapter entitled PHYSICAL PLANT/CALIFORNIA/LOS ANGELES/BUILDINGS/OFFICE AREAS/PHYSICAL LAYOUT REGULATIONS/EMPLOYEE INPUT/GROUP ACTIVITIES. The old subchapter was a flat prohibition on the use of office space or time for \"pool\" activities of any kind, whether permanent (e.g., coffee pool) or one-time (e.g., birthday parties). This prohibition still applies, but a single, one-time exception has now been made for any office that wishes to pursue a joint bathroom-tissue strategy. By way of introduction, let me just make a few general comments on this subject. The problem of distributing bathroom tissue to workers presents inherent challenges for any office management system due to the inherent unpredictability of usage -- not every facility usage transaction necessitates the use of bathroom tissue, and when it is used, the amount needed (number of squares) may vary quite widely from person to person and, for a given person, from one transaction to the next. This does not even take into account the occasional use of bathroom tissue for unpredictable/creative purposes such as applying/removing cosmetics, beverage-spill management, etc For this reason, rather than trying to package bathroom tissue in small one-transaction packets (as is done with premoistened towelettes, for example), which can be wasteful in some cases and limiting in other cases, it has been traditional to package this product in bulk distribution units whose size exceeds the maximum amount of squares that an individual could conceivably use in a single transaction (barring force majeure). This reduces to a minimum the number of transactions in which the distribution unit is depleted (the roll runs out) during the transaction, a situation that can lead to emotional stress for the affected employee. However, it does present the manager with some challenges in that the distribution unit is rather bulky and must be repeatedly used by a number of different individuals if it is not to be wasted. Since the implementation of Phase XVII of the Austerity Program, employees have been allowed to bring their own bathroom tissue from home. This approach is somewhat bulky and redundant, as every worker usually brings their own roll. Some offices have attempted to meet this challenge by instituting bathroom-tissue pools. Without overgeneralizing, it may be stated that an inherent and irreducible feature of any bathroom-tissue pool implemented at the office level, in an environment (i.e., building) in which comfort stations are distributed on a per-floor basis (i.e., in which several offices share a single facility) is that provision must be made within the confines of the individual office for temporary stationing of bathroom tissue distribution units (i.e., rolls). This follows from the fact that if the BTDUs (rolls) are stationed, while inactive, outside of the purview of the controlling office (i.e., the office that has collectively purchased the BTDU) -- that is, if the BTDUS are stored, for example, in a lobby area or within the facility in which they are actually utilized, they will be subject to pilferage and \"shrinkage\" as unauthorized persons consume them, either as part of a conscious effort to pilfer or out of an honest misunderstanding, i.e., a belief that the BTDUs are being provided free of charge by the operating agency (in this case the United States Government), or as the result of necessity, as in the case of a beverage spill that is encroaching on sensitive electronic equipment and whose management will thus brook no delay. This fact has led certain offices (which shall go unnamed -- you know who you are, guys) to establish makeshift BTDU depots that also serve as pool-contribution collection points. Usually, these depots take the form of a table, near the door closest to the facility, on which the BTDUs are stacked or otherwise deployed, with a bowl or some other receptacle in which participants may place their contributions, and typically with a sign or other attention-getting device (such as a stuffed animal or cartoon) requesting donations. A quick glance at the current regulations will show that placement of such a display/depot violates the procedure manual. However, in the interests of employee hygiene, morale, and group spirit-building, my higher-ups have agreed to make a one-time exception in the regulations for this purpose. As with any part of the procedure manual, new or old, it is your responsibility to be thoroughly familiar with this material. Estimated reading time for this document is 15.62 minutes (and don\u0027t think we won\u0027t check). Please make note of the major points made in this document, as follows: 1) BTDU depot/displays are now allowed, on a trial basis, with the new policy to be reviewed in six months. 2) These must be operated on a voluntary, pool-type basis, as described in the subchapter on employee pools. (Note: This means keeping books and tallying all financial transactions.) 3) BTDUs must be brought in by the employees (not shipped through the mailroom) and are subject to all the usual search-and-seizure regulations. 4) Scented BTDUs are prohibited as they may cause allergic reactions, wheezing, etc. in some persons. 5) Cash pool donations, as with all monetary transactions within the U.S. Government, must use official U.S. currency -- no yen or Kongbucks! Naturally, this will lead to a bulk problem if people try to use the donation bucket as a dumping ground for bundles of old billion. and trillion-dollar bills. The Buildings and Grounds people are worried about waste-disposal problems and the potential fire hazard that may ensue if large piles of billions and trillions begin to mount up. Therefore, a key feature of the new regulation is that the donation bucket must be emptied every day -- more often if an excessive build-up situation is seen to develop. In this vein, the B \u0026 C people would also like me to point out that many of you who have excess U.S. currency to get rid of have been trying to kill two birds with one stone by using old billions as bathroom tissue. While creative, this approach has two drawbacks: 1) It clogs the plumbing, and 2) It constitutes defacement of U.S. currency, which is a federal crime. DON\u0027T DO IT. Join your office bathroom-tissue pool instead. It\u0027s easy, it\u0027s hygienic, and it\u0027s legal. Happy pooling! Marietta. Y.T.\u0027s mom pulls up the new memo, checks the time, and starts reading it. The estimated reading time is 15.62 minutes. Later, when Marietta does her end-of-day statistical roundup, sitting in her private office at 9:00 P.M., she will see the name of each employee and next to it, the amount of time spent reading this memo, and her reaction, based on the time spent, will go something like this: Less than 10 min.: Time for an employee conference and possible attitude counseling. 10-14 min.: Keep an eye on this employee; may be developing slipshod attitude. 14-15.61 min.: Employee is an efficient worker, may sometimes miss important details. Exactly 15.62 min.: Smartass. Needs attitude counseling. 15.63-16 min.: Asswipe. Not to be trusted. 16-18 min.: Employee is a methodical worker, may sometimes get hung up on minor details. More than 18 min.: Check the security videotape, see just what this employee was up to (e.g., possible unauthorized restroom break). Y.T.\u0027s mom decides to spend between fourteen and fifteen minutes reading the memo. It\u0027s better for younger workers to spend too long, to show that they\u0027re careful, not cocky. It\u0027s better for older workers to go a little fast, to show good management potential. She\u0027s pushing forty. She scans through the memo, hitting the Page Down button at reasonably regular intervals, occasionally paging back up to pretend to reread some earlier section. The computer is going to notice all this. It approves of rereading. It\u0027s a small thing, but over a decade or so this stuff really shows up on your work-habits summary. Having got that out of the way, she dives into work. She is an applications programmer for the Feds. In the old days, she would have written computer programs for a living. Nowadays, she writes fragments of computer programs. These programs are designed by Marietta and Marietta\u0027s superiors in massive week-long meetings on the top floor. Once they get the design down, they start breaking up the problem into tinier and tinier segments, assigning them to group managers, who break them down even more and feed little bits of work to the individual programmers. In order to keep the work done by the individual coders from colliding, it all has to be done according to a set of rules and regulations even bigger and more fluid than the Government procedure manual. So the first thing that Y.T.\u0027s mother does, having read the new subchapter on bathroom tissue pools, is to sign onto a subsystem of the main computer system that handles the particular programming project she\u0027s working on. She doesn\u0027t know what the project is -- that\u0027s classified -- or what it\u0027s called. It\u0027s just her project. She shares it with a few hundred other programmers, she\u0027s not sure exactly who. And every day when she signs on to it, there\u0027s a stack of memos waiting for her, containing new regulations and changes to the rules that they all have to follow when writing code for the project. These regulations make the business with the bathroom tissue seem as simple and elegant as the Ten Commandments. So she spends until about eleven A.M. reading, rereading, and understanding the new changes in the Project. There are many of these, because this is a Monday morning and Marietta and her higher-ups spent the whole weekend closeted on the top floor, having a catfight about this Project, changing everything. Then she starts going back over all the code she has previously written for the Project and making a list of all the stuff that will have to be rewritten in order to make it compatible with the new specifications. Basically, she\u0027s going to have to rewrite all of her material from the ground up. For the third time in as many months. But hey, it\u0027s a job. About eleven-thirty, she looks up, startled, to see that half a dozen people are standing around her workstation. There\u0027s Marietta. And a proctor. And some male Feds. And Leon the polygraph man. \"I just had mine on Thursday,\" she says. \"Time for another one,\" Marietta says. \"Come on, let\u0027s get this show on the road.\" \"Hands out where I can see them,\" the proctor says. Y.T.\u0027s mom stands up, hands to her sides, and starts walking. She walks straight out of the office. None of the other people look up. Not supposed to. Insensitive to co-workers\u0027 needs. Makes the testee feel awkward and singled out, when in fact the polygraph is just part of the whole Fed way of life. She can hear the snapping footsteps of the proctor behind her, walking two paces behind, watching, keeping her eyes on those hands so they can\u0027t be doing anything, like popping a Valium or something else that might throw off the test. She stops in front of the bathroom door. The proctor walks in front of her, holds it open, and she walks in, followed by the proctor. The last stall on the left is oversized, big enough for two people. Y.T.\u0027s mom goes in, followed by the proctor, who closes and locks the door. Y.T.\u0027s morn pulls down her panty hose, pulls up her skirt, squats over a pan, pees. The proctor watches every drop go into the pan, picks it up, empties it into a test tube that is already labeled with her name and today\u0027s date. Then it\u0027s back out to the lobby, followed again by the proctor. You\u0027re allowed to use the elevators on your way to the polygraph room, so you won\u0027t be out of breath and sweaty when you get there. It used to be just a plain office with a chair and some instruments on a table. Then they got the new, fancy polygraph system. Now it\u0027s like going in for some kind of high-tech medical scan. The room is completely rebuilt, no vestige of its original function, the window covered over, everything smooth and beige and smelling like a hospital. There\u0027s only one chair, in the middle. Y.T.\u0027s mom goes and sits down in it, puts her arms on the arms of the chair, nestles her fingertips and palms into the little depressions that await. The neoprene fist of the blood-pressure cuff gropes blindly, finds her arm, and seizes it. Meanwhile, the room lights are dimming, the door is closing, she\u0027s all alone. The crown of thorns closes over her head, she feels the pricks of the electrodes through her scalp, senses the cool air flowing down over her shoulders from the superconducting quantum-interference devices that serve as radar into her brain. Somewhere on the other side of the wall, she knows, half a dozen personnel techs are sitting in a control room, looking at a big-screen blow-up of her pupils. Then she feels a burning prick in her forearm and knows she\u0027s been injected with something. Which means it\u0027s not a normal polygraph exam. Today she\u0027s in for something special. The burning spreads throughout her body, her heart thumps, eyes water. She\u0027s been shot up with caffeine to make her hyper, make her talkative. So much for getting any work done today. Sometimes these things go for twelve hours. \"What is your name?\" a voice says. It\u0027s an unnaturally calm and liquid voice. Computer generated. That way, everything it says to her is impartial, stripped of emotional content, she has no way to pick up any cues as to how the interrogation is going. The caffeine, and the other things that they inject her with, screw up her sense of time also. She hates these things, but it happens to everyone from time to time, and when you go to work for the Feds, you sign on the dotted line and give permission for it. In a way, it\u0027s a mark of pride and honor. Everyone who works for the Feds has their heart in it. Because if they didn\u0027t, it would come out plain as day when it is their turn to sit in this chair. The questions go on and on. Mostly nonsense questions. \"Have you ever been to Scotland? Is white bread more expensive than wheat bread?\" This is just to get her settled down, get all systems running smoothly. They throw out all the stuff they get from the first hour of the interrogation, because it\u0027s lost in the noise. She can feel herself relaxing into it. They say that after a few polygraphs, you learn to relax, the whole thing goes quicker. The chair holds her in place, the caffeine keeps her from getting drowsy, the sensory deprivation clears out her mind. \"What is your daughter\u0027s nickname?\" \"How do you refer to your daughter?\" \"I call her by her nickname. Y.T. She kind of insists on it.\" \"Does Y.T. have a job?\" \"Yes. She works as Kourier. She works for RadiKS.\" \"How much money does Y.T. make as a Kourier?\" \"I don\u0027t know. A few bucks here and there.\" \"How often does she purchase new equipment for her job?\" \"I\u0027m not aware. I don\u0027t really keep track of that.\" \"Has Y.T. done anything unusual lately?\" \"That depends on what you mean.\" She knows she\u0027s equivocating. \"She\u0027s always doing things that some people might label as unusual.\" That doesn\u0027t sound too good, sounds like an endorsement of nonconformity. \"I guess what I\u0027m saying is, she\u0027s always doing unusual things.\" \"Has Y.T. broken anything in the house recently?\" \"Yes.\" She gives up. The Feds already know this, her house is bugged and tapped, it\u0027s a wonder it doesn\u0027t short out the electrical grid, all the extra stuff wired into it. \"She broke my computer.\" \"Did she give an explanation for why she broke the computer?\" \"Yes. Sort of. I mean, if nonsense counts as an explanation.\" \"What was her explanation?\" \"She was afraid -- this is so ridiculous -- she was afraid I was going to catch a virus from it.\" \"Was Y.T. also afraid of catching this virus?\" \"No. She said that only programmers could catch it.\" Why are they asking her all of these questions? They have all of this stuff on tape. \"Did you believe Y.T.\u0027s explanation of why she broke the computer?\" That\u0027s it. That\u0027s what they\u0027re after. They want to know the only thing they can\u0027t directly tap -- what\u0027s going on in her mind. They want to know whether she believes Y.T.\u0027s virus story. And she knows she\u0027s making a mistake just thinking these thoughts. Because those supercooled SQUIDs around her head are picking it up. They can\u0027t tell what she\u0027s thinking. But they can tell that something\u0027s going on in her brain, that she\u0027s using parts of her brain right now that she didn\u0027t use when they were asking the nonsense questions. In other words, they can tell that she is analyzing the situation, trying to figure them out. And she wouldn\u0027t be doing that unless she wanted to hide something. \"What is it you want to know?\" she says. \"Why don\u0027t you just come out and ask me directly? Let\u0027s talk about this face to face. Just sit down together in a room like adults and talk about it.\" She feels another sharp prick in her arm, feels numbness and coldness spreading all across her body over an interval of a couple of seconds as the drug mixes with her bloodstream. It\u0027s getting harder to follow the conversation. \"What is your name?\" the voice says.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/731.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
