{"id":21009,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"Once they get to a certain part of town, following the T-Bone and Raven show becomes a matter of connect-the-ambulances. Every couple of blocks there is a cluster of cops and medica, lights sparkling, radios coughing. All they have to do is go from one to the next.\n At the first one, there is a dead Crip lying on the pavement. A six-foot-wide blood slick runs from his body, diagonally down the street to a storm drain. The ambulance people are standing around, smoking and drinking coffee from go cups, waiting for The Enforcers to get finished measuring and photographing so that they can haul the corpse to the morgue. There are no IV lines set up, no bits of medical trash strewn around the area, no open doc boxes; they didn\u0027t even try.\n They proceed around a couple of corners to the next constellation of flashing lights. Here, the ambulance drivers are inflating a cast around the leg of a MetaCop.\n \"Run over by the motorcycle,\" Squeaky says, shaking his head with the traditional Enforcer\u0027s disdain for their pathetic junior relations, the MetaCops.\n Finally, he patches the radio feed into the dashboard so they can all hear it. The motorcyclist\u0027s trail is now cold, and it sounds like most of the local cops are dealing with aftermath problems. But a citizen has just called in to complain that a man on a motorcycle, and several other persons, are trashing a field of hops on her block.\n \"Three blocks from here,\" Squeaky says to the driver.\n \"Hops?\" Hiro says.\n \"I know the place. Local microbrewery,\" Squeaky says. \"They grow their own hops. Contract it out to some urban gardeners. Chinese peasants who do the grunt work for \u0027em.\"\n When they arrive, the first authority figures on the scene, it is obvious why Raven decided to let himself get chased into a hop field: It is great cover. The hops are heavy, flowering vines that grow on trellises lashed together out of long something. Poppies. The trellises are eight feet high; you can\u0027t see a thing.\n They all get out of the car.\n \"T-Bone?\" Squeaky hollers.\n They hear someone yelling in English from the middle of the field. \"Over here!\" But he isn\u0027t responding to Squeaky.\n They walk into the hop field. Carefully. There is an enveloping smell, a resiny odor not unlike marijuana, the sharp smell that comes off an expensive beer. Squeaky motions for Hiro to stay behind him.\n In other circumstances, Hiro would do so. He is half Japanese, and under certain circumstances, totally respectful of authority.\n This is not one of those circumstances. If Raven comes anywhere near Hiro, Hiro is going to be talking to him with his katana. And if it comes to that, Hiro doesn\u0027t want Squeaky anywhere near him, because he could lose a limb on the backswing.\n \"Yo, T-Bone!\" Squeaky yells. \"It\u0027s The Enforcers, and we\u0027re pissed! Get the fuck out of there, man. Let\u0027s go home!\"\n T-Bone, or Hiro assumes it is T-Bone, responds only by firing a short burst from a machine pistol. The muzzle flash lights up the hop vines like a strobe light. Hiro aims one shoulder at the ground, buries himself in soft earth and foliage for a few seconds.\n \"Fuck!\" T-Bone says. It is a disappointed fuck, but a fuck with a heavy undertone of overwhelming frustration and not a little fear.\n Hiro gets up into a conservative squat, looks around. Squeaky and the other Enforcer are nowhere to be seen.\n Hiro forces his way through one of the trellises and into a row that is closer to the action.\n The other Enforcer -- the driver -- is in the same row, about ten meters away, his back turned to Hiro. He glances over his shoulder in Hiro\u0027s direction, then looks in the other direction and sees someone else -- Hiro can\u0027t quite see who, because The Enforcer is in the way.\n \"What the fuck,\" The Enforcer says.\n Then he jumps a little, as though startled, and something happens to the back of his jacket.\n \"Who is it?\" Hiro says.\n The Enforcer doesn\u0027t say anything. He is trying to turn back around, but something prevents it. Something is shaking the vines around him.\n The Enforcer shudders, careens sideways from foot to foot. \"Got to get loose,\" he says, speaking loudly to no one in particular. He breaks into a trot, running away from Hiro. The other person who was in the row is gone now. The Enforcer is running in a strange stiff upright gait with his arms down to his sides. His bright green windbreaker isn\u0027t hanging correctly.\n Hiro runs after him. The Enforcer is trotting toward the end of the row, where the lights of the street are visible.\n The Enforcer exits the field a couple of seconds ahead of him, and, when Hiro gets to the curb, is in the middle of the road, illuminated mostly by flashing blue light from a giant overhead video screen. He is turning around and around with strange little stomping footsteps, not keeping his balance very well. He is saying, \"Aaah, aaah\" in a low, calm voice that gurgles as though he badly needs to clear his throat.\n As The Enforcer revolves, Hiro perceives that he has been impaled on an eight-foot-long bamboo spear. Half sticks out the front, half out the back. The back half is dark with blood and black fecal clumps, the front half is greenish-yellow and clean. The Enforcer can only see the front half and his hands are playing up and down it, trying to verify what his eyes are seeing. Then the back half whacks into a parked car, spraying a narrow fan of head cheese across the waxed and polished trunk lid. The car\u0027s alarm goes off. The Enforcer hears the sound and turns around to see what it is.\n When Hiro last sees him, he is running down the center of the pulsating neon street toward the center of Chinatown, wailing a terrible, random song that clashes with the bleating of the car alarm. Hiro feels even at this moment that something has been torn open in the world and that he is dangling above the gap, staring into a place where he does not want to be. Lost in the biomass.\n Hiro draws his katana.\n \"Squeaky!\" Hiro hollers. \"He\u0027s throwing spears! He\u0027s pretty good at it! Your driver is hit!\"\n \"Got it!\" Squeaky hollers.\n Hiro goes back into the closest row. He hears a sound off to the right and uses the katana to cut his way through into that row. This is not a nice place to be at the moment, but it is safer than standing in the street under the plutonic light of the video screen.\n Down the row is a man. Hiro recognizes him by the strange shape of his head, which just gets wider until it reaches his shoulders. He is holding a freshly cut bamboo pole in one hand, torn from the trellis.\n Raven strokes one end of it with his other hand, and a chunk falls off. Something flickers in that hand, the blade of a knife apparently. He has just cut off the end of the pole at an acute angle to make it into a spear. He throws it fluidly. The motion is calm and beautiful. The spear disappears because it is coming straight at Hiro.\n Hiro does not have time to adopt the proper stance, but this is fine since he has already adopted it. Whenever he has a katana in his hands he adopts it automatically, otherwise he fears that he may lose his balance and carelessly lop off one of his extremities. Feet parallel and pointed straight ahead, right foot in front of the left foot, katana held down at groin level like an extension of the phallus. Hiro raises the tip and slaps at the spear with the side of the blade, diverting it just enough; it goes into a slow sideways spin, the point missing Hiro just barely and entangling itself in a vine on Hiro\u0027s right. The butt end swings around and gets hung up on the left, tearing out a number of vines as it comes to a stop. It is heavy, and traveling very fast. Raven is gone.\n Mental note: Whether or not Raven intended to take on a bunch of Crips and Enforcers singlehandedly tonight, he didn\u0027t even bother to pack a gun.\n Another burst of gunfire sounds from several rows over.\n Hiro has been standing here for rather a long time, thinking about what just happened. He cuts through the next row of vines and heads in the direction of the muzzle flash, running his mouth: \"Don\u0027t shoot this way, T-Bone, I\u0027m on your side, man.\"\n \"Motherfucker threw a stick into my chest, man!\" T-Bone complains.\n When you\u0027re wearing armor, getting hit by a spear just isn\u0027t such a big deal anymore.\n \"Maybe you should just forget it,\" Hiro says. He is having to cut his way through a lot of rows to reach T-Bone, but as long as T-Bone keeps talking, Hiro can find him.\n \"I\u0027m a Crip. We don\u0027t forget nothing,\" T-Bone says. \"Is that you?\"\n \"No,\" Hiro says. \"I\u0027m not there yet.\"\n A very brief burst of gunfire, rapidly cut off. Suddenly, no one is talking. Hiro cuts his way into the next row and almost steps on T-Bone\u0027s hand, which has been amputated at the wrist. Its finger is still tangled in the trigger guard of a MAC-10.\n The remainder of T-Bone is two rows away. Hiro stops and watches through the vines.\n Raven is one of the largest men Hiro has seen outside of a professional sporting event. T-Bone is backing away from him down the row. Raven, moving with long confident strides, catches up with T-Bone and swings one hand up into T-Bone\u0027s body; Hiro doesn\u0027t have to see the knife to know it is there.\n It looks as though T-Bone is going to get out of this with nothing worse than a sewn-on hand and some rehab work, because you can\u0027t stab a person to death that way, not if he is wearing armor.\n T-Bone screams.\n He is bouncing up and down on Raven\u0027s hand. The knife has gone all the way through the bulletproof fabric and now Raven is trying to gut T-Bone the same way he did Lagos. But his knife -- whatever the hell it is -- won\u0027t cut through the fabric that way. It is sharp enough to penetrate -- which should be impossible -- but not sharp enough to slash.\n Raven pulls it out, drops to one knee, and swings his knife hand around in a long ellipse between T-Bone\u0027s thighs. Then he jumps over T-Bone\u0027s collapsing body and runs.\n Hiro gets the sense that T-Bone is a dead man, so he follows Raven. His intention is not to hunt the man down, but rather to maintain a very clear picture of where he is.\n He has to cut through a number of rows. He rapidly loses Raven. He considers running as fast as he can in the opposite direction.\n Then he hears the deep, lung-stretching rumble of a motorcycle engine. Hiro runs for the nearest street exit, just hoping to catch a glimpse.\n He does, though it is a quick one, not a hell of a lot better than the graphic in the cop car. Raven turns to look at Hiro, just as he is blowing out of there. He\u0027s right under a streetlight, so Hiro gets a clear look at his face for the first time. He is Asian. He has a wispy mustache that trails down past his chin.\n Another Crip comes running out into the street half a second after Hiro, as Raven is pulling away. He slows for a moment to take stock of the situation, then charges the motorcycle like a linebacker. He is crying out as he does so, a war cry.\n Squeaky emerges about the same time as the Crip, starts chasing both of them down the street.\n Raven seems to be unaware of the Crip running behind him, but in hindsight it seems apparent that he has been watching his approach in the rearview mirror of the motorcycle. As the Crip comes in range, Raven\u0027s hand lets go of the throttle for a moment, snaps back as if he is throwing away a piece of litter. His fist strikes the middle of the Crip\u0027s face like a frozen ham shot out of a cannon. The Crip\u0027s head snaps back, his feet are lifted off the ground, he does most of a backflip and strikes the pavement, hitting first with the nape of his neck, both arms slamming out straight onto the road as he does so. It looks a lot like a controlled fall, though if so, it has to be more reflex than anything.\n Squeaky decelerates, turns, and kneels down next to the fallen Crip, ignoring Raven.\n Hiro watches the large, radioactive, spear-throwing killer drug lord ride his motorcycle into Chinatown. Which is the same as riding it into China, as far as chasing him down is concerned.\n He runs up to the Crip, who is lying crucified in the center of the street. The lower half of the Crip\u0027s face is pretty hard to make out. His eyes are half open, and he looks quite relaxed. He speaks quietly. \"He\u0027s a fucking Indian or something.\"\n Interesting idea. But Hiro still thinks he\u0027s Asian.\n \"What the fuck did you think you were doing, asshole?\" Squeaky says. He sounds so pissed that Hiro steps away from him.\n \"That fucker ripped us off -- the suitcase burned,\" the Crip mumbles through a mashed jaw.\n \"So why didn\u0027t you just write it off? Are you crazy, fucking with Raven like that?\"\n \"He ripped us off. Nobody does that and lives.\"\n \"Well, Raven just did,\" Squeaky says. Finally, he\u0027s calming down a little. He rocks back on his heels, looks up at Hiro.\n \"T-Bone and your driver are not likely to be alive,\" Hiro says. \"This guy better not move -- he could have a neck fracture.\"\n \"He\u0027s lucky I don\u0027t fracture his fucking neck,\" Squeaky says. The ambulance people get there fast enough to slap an inflatable cervical collar around the Crip\u0027s neck before he gets ambitious enough to stand up. They haul him away within a few minutes.\n Hiro goes back into the hops and finds T-Bone. T-Bone is dead, slumped in a kneeling position against a trellis. The stab wound through his bulletproof vest probably would have been fatal, but Raven wasn\u0027t satisfied with that. He went down low and slashed up and down the insides of T-Bone\u0027s thighs, which are now laid open all the way to the bone. In doing so, he put great lengthwise rents into both of T-Bone\u0027s femoral arteries, and his entire blood supply dropped out of him. Like slicing the bottom off a styrofoam cup.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/700.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
