{"id":20994,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"After Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev. They weren\u0027t homesick. They needed such environments in order to practice their art.\n The L.A. River was a natural site. And there were plenty of nice overpasses. All they had to do was follow skateboarders to the secret places they had long since discovered. Thrashers and nuclear fuzz-grunge collectives thrive in the same environment. That\u0027s where Vitaly and Hiro are going right now.\n Vitaly has a really old VW Vanagon, the kind with a pop-top that turns it into a makeshift camper. He used to live in it, staying on the street or in various Snooze \u0027n\u0027 Cruise franchises, until he met up with Hiro Protagonist. Now, the ownership of the Vanagon is subject to dispute, because Vitaly owes Hiro more money than it is technically worth. So they share it.\n They drive the Vanagon around to the other side of the U-Stor-It, honking the horn and flashing the lights in order to shoo a hundred little kids away from the loading dock. It\u0027s not a playground, kids.\n They pick their way down a broad corridor, excusing themselves every inch of the way as they step over little Mayan encampments and Buddhist shrines and white trash stoned on Vertigo, Apple Pie, Fuzzy Buzzy, Narthex, Mustard, and the like. The floor needs sweeping: used syringes, crack vials, charred spoons, pipe stems. There are also many little tubes, about thumb sized, transparent plastic with a red cap on one end. They might be crack vials, but the caps are still on them, and pipeheads wouldn\u0027t be so fastidious as to replace the lid on an empty vial. It must be something new Hiro hasn\u0027t heard of before, the McDonald\u0027s styrofoam burger box of drug containers.\n They push through a fire door into another section of the U-Stor-It, which looks the same as the last one (everything looks the same in America, there are no transitions now). Vitaly owns the third locker on the right, a puny 5-by-lO that he is actually using for its intended purpose: storage.\n Vitaly steps up to the door and commences trying to remember the combination to the padlock, which involves a certain amount of random guessing. Finally, the lock snaps and pops open. Vitaly shoots the bolt and swings the door open, sweeping a clean half-circle through the drug paraphernalia. Most of the 5-by-1O is occupied by a couple of large four-wheeled flatbed handcarts piled high with speakers and amps.\n Hiro and Vitaly wheel the carts down to the loading dock, put the stuff into the Vanagon, and then return the empty carts to the 5-by-10. Technically, the carts are community property, but no one believes that.\n The drive to the scene of the concert is long, made longer by the fact that Vitaly, rejecting the technocentric L.A. view of the universe in which Speed is God, likes to stay on the surface and drive at about thirty-five miles per hour. Traffic is not great, either. So Hiro jacks his computer into the cigarette lighter and goggles into the Metaverse.\n He is no longer connected to the network by a fiber-optic cable, and so all his communication with the outside world has to take place via radio waves, which are much slower and less reliable. Going into The Black Sun would not be practical -- it would look and sound terrible, and the other patrons would look at him as if he were some kind of black-and-white person. But there\u0027s no problem with going into his office, because that\u0027s generated within the guts of his computer, which is sitting on his lap; he doesn\u0027t need any communication with the outside world for that.\n He materializes in his office, in his nice little house in the old hacker neighborhood just off the Street. It is all quite Nipponese: tatami mats cover the floor. His desk is a great, ruddy slab of rough-sawn mahogany. Silvery cloud-light filters through rice-paper walls. A panel in front of him slides open to reveal a garden, complete with babbling brook and steelhead trout jumping out from time to time to grab flies. Technically speaking, the pond should be full of carp, but Hiro is American enough to think of carp as inedible dinosaurs that sit on the bottom and eat sewage.\n There is something new: A globe about the size of a grapefruit, a perfectly detailed rendition of Planet Earth, hanging in space at arm\u0027s length in front of his eyes. Hiro has heard about this but never seen it. It is a piece of CIC software called, simply, Earth. It is the user interface that CIC uses to keep track of every bit of spatial information that it owns -- all the maps, weather data, architectural plans, and satellite surveillance stuff.\n Hiro has been thinking that in a few years, if he does really well in the intel biz, maybe he will make enough money to subscribe to Earth and get this thing in his office. Now it is suddenly here, free of charge. The only explanation he can come up with is that Juanita must have given it to him.\n But first things first. The Babel/Infopocalypse card is still in his avatar\u0027s pocket. He takes it out.\n One of the rice-paper panels that make up the walls of his office slides open. On the other side of it, Hiro can see a large, dimly lit room that wasn\u0027t there before; apparently Juanita came in and made a major addition to his house as well. A man walks into the office.\n The Librarian daemon looks like a pleasant, fiftyish, silverhaired, bearded man with bright blue eyes, wearing a V-neck sweater over a work shirt, with a coarsely woven, tweedy-looking wool tie. The tie is loosened, the sleeves pushed up. Even though he\u0027s just a piece of software, he has reason to be cheerful; he can move through the nearly infinite stacks of information in the Library with the agility of a spider dancing across a vast web of cross-references. The Librarian is the only piece of CIC software that costs even more than Earth; the only thing he can\u0027t do is think.\n \"Yes, sir,\" the Librarian says. He is eager without being obnoxiously chipper, he clasps his hands behind his back, rocks forward slightly on the balls of his feet, raises his eyebrows expectantly over his half-glasses.\n \"Babel\u0027s a city in Babylon, right?\"\n \"It was a legendary city,\" the Librarian says. \"Babel is a Biblical term for Babylon. The word is Semitic; Bab means gate and El means Cod, so Babel means \u0027Gate of God.\u0027 But it is probably also somewhat onomatopoeic, imitating someone who speaks in an incomprehensible tongue. The Bible is full of puns.\"\n \"They built a tower to Heaven and God knocked it down.\"\n \"This is an anthology of common misconceptions. God did not do anything to the Tower itself. \u0027And the LORD said, \"Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another\u0027s speech.\" So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth.\u0027 Genesis 11:6-9, Revised Standard Version.\"\n \"So the tower wasn\u0027t knocked down. It just went on hiatus.\"\n \"Correct. It was not knocked down.\"\n \"But that\u0027s bogus?\u0027\n \"Bogus?\"\n \"Provably false. Juanita believes that nothing is provably true or provably false in the Bible. Because if it\u0027s provably false, then the Bible is a lie, and if it\u0027s provably true, then the existence of God is proven and there\u0027s no room for faith. The Babel story is provably false, because if they built a tower to Heaven and God didn\u0027t knock it down, then it would still be around somewhere, or at least a visible remnant of it.\"\n \"In assuming that it was very tall, you are relying on an obsolete reading. The tower is described, literally, as \u0027its top with the heavens.\u0027 For many centuries, this was interpreted to mean that its top was so high that it was in the heavens. But in the last century or so, as actual Babylonian ziggurats have been excavated, astrological diagrams -- pictures of the heavens -- have been found inscribed into their tops.\"\n \"Oh. Okay, so the real story is that a tower was built with heavenly diagrams carved into its top. Which is far more plausible than a tower that reaches to the heavens.\"\n \"More than plausible,\" the Librarian reminds him. \"Such structures have actually been found.\"\n \"Anyway, you\u0027re saying that when God got angry and came down on them, the tower itself wasn\u0027t affected. But they had to stop building the tower because of an informational disaster -- they couldn\u0027t talk to each other.\"\n \"\u0027Disaster\u0027 is an astrological term meaning \u0027bad star,\" the Librarian points out. \"Sorry -- but due to my internal structure, I\u0027m a sucker for non sequiturs.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay, really,\" Hiro says. \"You\u0027re a pretty decent piece of ware. Who wrote you, anyway?\"\n \"For the most part I write myself,\" the Librarian says. \"That is, I have the innate ability to learn from experience. But this ability was originally coded into me by my creator.\"\n \"Who wrote you? Maybe I know him,\" Hiro says. \"I know a lot of hackers.\"\n \"I was not coded by a professional hacker, per se, but by a researcher at the Library of Congress who taught himself how to code,\" the Librarian says. \"He devoted himself to the common problem of sifting through vast amounts of irrelevant detail in order to find significant gems of information. His name was Dr. Emanuel Lagos.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard the name,\" Hiro says. \"So he was kind of a metalibrarian. That\u0027s funny, I guessed he was one of those old CIA spooks who hangs around in the CIC.\"\n \"He never worked with the CIA.\"\n \"Okay. Let\u0027s get some work done. Look up every piece of free information in the Library that contains L. Bob Rife and arrange it in chronological order. The emphasis here is on free.\"\n \"Television and newspapers, yes, sir. One moment, sir,\" the Librarian says. He turns around and exits on crepe soles. Hiro turns his attention to Earth.\n The level of detail is fantastic. The resolution, the clarity, just the look of it, tells Hiro, or anyone else who knows computers, that this piece of software is some heavy shit.\n It\u0027s not just continents and oceans. It looks exactly like the earth would look from a point in geosynchronous orbit directly above L.A.. complete with weather systems -- vast spinning galaxies of clouds, hovering just above the surface of the globe, casting gray shadows on the oceans -- and polar ice caps, fading and fragmenting into the sea. Half of the globe is illuminated by sunlight, and half is dark. The terminator -- the line between night and day -- has just swept across L.A. and is now creeping across the Pacific, off to the west.\n Everything is going in slow motion. Hiro can see the clouds change shape if he watches them long enough. Looks like a clear night on the East Coast.\n Something catches his attention, moving rapidly over the surface of the globe. He thinks it must be a gnat. But there are no gnats in the Metaverse. He tries to focus on it. The computer, bouncing low-powered lasers off his cornea, senses this change in emphasis, and then Hiro gasps as he seems to plunge downward toward the globe, like a space-walking astronaut who has just fallen out of his orbital groove. When he finally gets it under control, he\u0027s just a few hundred miles above the earth, looking down at a solid bank of clouds, and he can see the gnat gliding along below him. It\u0027s a low-flying CIC satellite, swinging north to south in a polar orbit.\n \"Your information, sir,\" the Librarian says.\n Hiro startles and glances up. Earth swings down and out of his field of view and there is the Librarian, standing in front of the desk, holding out a hypercard. Like any librarian in Reality, this daemon can move around without audible footfalls.\n \"Can you make a little more noise when you walk? I\u0027m easily startled,\" Hiro says.\n \"It is done, sir. My apologies.\"\n Hiro reaches out for the hypercard. The Librarian takes half a step forward and leans toward him. This time, his foot makes a soft noise on the tatami mat, and Hiro can hear the white noise of his trousers sliding over his leg.\n Hiro takes the hypercard and looks at it. The front is labeled\n Results of Library Search on:\n Rife, Lawrence Robert\n He flips the card over. The back is divided into several dozen fingernail-sized icons. Some of them are little snapshots of the front pages of newspapers. Many of them are colorful, glowing rectangles: miniature television screens showing live video. \"That\u0027s impossible,\" Hiro says. \"I\u0027m sitting in a VW van, okay? I\u0027m jacked in over a cellular link. You couldn\u0027t have moved that much video into my system that fast.\"\n \"It was not necessary to move anything,\" the Librarian says.\n \"All existing video on L. Bob Rife was collected by Dr. Lagos and placed in the Babel/Infopocalypse stack, which you have in your system.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/685.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
