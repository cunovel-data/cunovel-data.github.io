{"id":21047,"no":73,"title":"Chapter 73","content":"It\u0027s a real ocean-going ship. An old, shitty, rusty one that probably cost about five bucks at the ship junkyard. But it carries cars, and it goes through the water, and it doesn\u0027t sink. The ship is just like the van, except bigger, with more people. But they eat the same stuff, sing the same songs, and sleep just as rarely as ever. By now, Y.T. finds it perversely comforting. She knows that she\u0027s with a lot of other people like her, and that she\u0027s safe. She knows the routine. She knows where she belongs. And so finally they come to the Raft. No one has told Y.T. this is where they\u0027re going, but by now it\u0027s obvious. She ought to be scared. But they wouldn\u0027t be going to the Raft if it was as bad as everyone says. When it starts coming into view, she half expects them to converge on her with gaffer\u0027s tape again. But then she figures out it\u0027s not necessary. She hasn\u0027t been causing trouble. She\u0027s been accepted here, they trust her. It gives her a feeling of pride, in a way. And she won\u0027t cause trouble on the Raft because all she can do is escape from their part of it onto the Raft per se. As such. The real Raft. The Raft of a hundred Hong Kong B-movies and blood-soaked Nipponese comic books. It doesn\u0027t take much imagination to think of what happens to lone fifteen-year-old blond American girls on the Raft, and these people know it. Sometimes, she worries about her mother, then she hardens her heart and thinks maybe the whole thing will be good for her. Shake her up a little. Which is what she needs. After Dad left, she just folded up into herself like an origami bird thrown into a fire. There is kind of an outer cloud of small boats surrounding the Raft for a distance of a few miles. Almost all of them are fishing boats. Some of them carry men with guns, but they don\u0027t fuck around with this ferry The ferry swings through this outer zone, making a broad turn, finally zeroing in on a white neighborhood on one flank of the Raft. Literally white. All the boats here are clean and new. There\u0027s a couple of big rusty boats with Russian lettering on the side, and the ferry pulls up alongside one of them, ropes are thrown across, then augmented with nets, gang-planks, webs of old discarded tires. This Raft thing does not look like good skating territory at all. She wonders if any of the other people on board this ferry are skaters. Doesn\u0027t seem likely. Really, they are not her kind of people at all. She has always been a dirty scum dog of the highways, not one of these happy singalong types. Maybe the Raft is just the place for her. They take her down into one of the Russian ships and give her the grossest job of all time: cutting up fish. She does not want a job, has not asked for one. But that\u0027s what she gets. Still, no one really talks to her, no one bothers to explain anything, and that makes her reluctant to ask. She has just run into a massive cultural shock wave, because most of the people on this ship are old and fat and Russian and don\u0027t speak English. For a couple of days, she spends a lot of time sleeping on the job, being prodded awake by the hefty Russian dames who work in this place. She also does some eating. Some of the fish that comes through this place looks pretty rank, but there\u0027s a fair amount of salmon. The only way she knows this is from having sushi at the mall -- salmon is the orange-red stuff. So she makes some sushi of her own, munches down on some fresh salmon meat, and it\u0027s good. It clears her head a little. Once she gets over the shock of it and settles into a routine, she starts looking around her, watching the other fish-cutting dames, and realizes that this is just like life must be for about 99 percent of the people in the world. You\u0027re in this place. There\u0027s other people all around you, but they don\u0027t understand you and you don\u0027t understand them, but people do a lot of pointless babbling anyway. In order to stay alive, you have to spend all day every day doing stupid meaningless work. And the only way to get out of it is to quit, cut loose, take a flyer, and go off into the wicked world, where you will be swallowed up and never heard from again. She\u0027s not especially good at cutting up fish. The big stout Russian chicks -- stomping, slab-faced babushkas -- keep giving her a hassle. They keep hovering, watching her cut with this look on their face like they can\u0027t believe what a dork she is. Then they try to show her how to do it the right way, but still she\u0027s not so good at it. It\u0027s hard, and her hands are cold and stiff all the time. After a couple of frustrating days, they give her a new job, farther down the production line: they turn her into a cafeteria dame. Like one of the slop-slingers in the high school lunchroom. She works in the galley of one of the big Russian ships, hauling vats of cooked fish stew out to the buffet line, ladling it out into bowls, shoving it across the counter at an unending line consisting of religious fanatics, religious fanatics, and more religious fanatics. Except this time around, there seem to be a lot more Asians and hardly any Americans at all. They have a new species here too: people with antennas coming out of their heads. The antennas look like the ones on cop walkie-talkies: short, blunt, black rubber whips. They rise up from behind the ear. The first time she sees one of these people, she figures it must be some kind of new Walkman, and she wants to ask the guy where he got it, what he\u0027s listening to. But he\u0027s a strange guy, stranger than all of the others, with a permanent thousand-yard stare and a bad case of the mumbles, and he ends up giving her the creeps so bad that she just shoves an extra-large dose of stew in his face and hurries him on down the line. From time to time, she actually recognizes one of the people who were in her van. But they don\u0027t seem to recognize her; they just look right through her. Glassy-eyed. Like they\u0027ve been brainwashed. Like Y.T. was brainwashed. She can\u0027t believe it has taken her this long to figure out what they were doing to her. And that just makes her more pissed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/738.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
