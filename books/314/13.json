{"id":20987,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"At half an hour on the dot, she hears the back door being unlocked. The lights come on. Her Knight Visions save her from wracking eyeball pains. The manager thunks down a couple of steps, glares at her, glares at her for rather a long time. The manager, clearly, is tempted. That momentary glimpse of flesh has been ricocheting around in his brain for half an hour. He is wracking his mind with vast cosmological dilemmas. Y.T., hopes that he does not try anything, because the dentata\u0027s effects can be unpredictable.\\n\\n \"Make up your fucking mind,\" she says.\\n\\n It works. This fresh burst of culture shock rattles the jeek out of his ethical conundrum. He gives Y.T. a disapproving glower -- she, after all, forced him to be attracted to her, forced him to get horny, made his head swim -- she didn\u0027t have to get arrested, did she? -- and so on top of everything else he\u0027s angry with her. As if he has a right to be.\\n\\n This is the gender that invented the polio vaccine?\\n\\n He turns, goes back up the steps, kills the light, locks the door.\\n\\n She notes the time, sets her alarm watch for five minutes from now -- the only North American who actually knows how to set the alarm on her digital wristwatch -- pulls her shiv kit from one of the narrow pockets on her sleeve. She also hauls out a light-stick and snaps it so she can see \u0027sup. She finds one piece of narrow, flat spring steel, slides it up into the manacle\u0027s innards, depresses the spring-loaded pawl. The cuff, formerly a one-way ratchet that could only get tighter, springs loose from the cold-water pipe.\\n\\n She could take it off her wrist, but she has decided she likes the look of it. She cuffs the loose manacle onto her wrist, right next to the other one, forming a double bracelet. The kind of thing her mom used to do, back when she was a punk.\\n\\n The steel door is locked, but Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly safety regs mandate an emergency exit from the basement in case of fire. Here, it\u0027s a basement window with mondo bars and a big red multilingual fire alarm bolted onto it. The red looks black in the green glow of the lightstick. She reads the instructions that are in English, runs through it once or twice in her mind, then waits for the alarm to go off. She whiles away the time by reading the instructions in all the other languages, wondering which is which. It all looks like Taxilinga to Y.T.\\n\\n The window is almost too grungy to see through, but she sees something black walking past it. Hiro.\\n\\n About ten seconds later, her wristwatch goes off. She punches the emergency exit. The bell rings. The bars are trickier than she thought -- good thing it\u0027s not a real fire -- but eventually she gets them open. She throws her plank outside onto the parking lot, drags her body through just as she bears the rear door being unlocked. By the time the three-ringer has found that all-important light switch, she is banking a sharp turn into the front lot -- which has turned into a jeek festival.\\n\\n Every jeek in Southern Cal is here, it seems, driving their giant, wrecked taxicabs with alien livestock in the back seat, reeking of incense and sloshing neon-hued Airwicks! They have set up a giant eight-tubed hookah on the trunk of one of the cabs and are slurping up great mountain-man lungfuls of choking smoke.\\n\\n And they\u0027re all staring at Hiro Protagonist, who is just staring back at them. Everyone in the parking lot looks completely astounded.\\n\\n He must have made his approach from the rear -- didn\u0027t realize that the front lot was full of jeeks. Whatever he was planning isn\u0027t going to work. The plan is screwed.\\n\\n The manager comes running around from the back of the Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly, sounding a bloodcurdling Taxilinga tocsin. He\u0027s got missile lock on Y.T.\u0027s ass. But the jeeks around the hookah don\u0027t care about Y.T. They\u0027ve got missile lock on Hiro. They carefully hang the ornate silver nozzles on a rack built into the neck of the mega-bong. Then they start moving toward him, reaching into the folds of their robes, the inner pockets of their windbreakers.\\n\\n Y.T. is distracted by a sharp hissing noise. Her eyes glance back at Hiro, and she sees that he has withdrawn a three-foot, curved sword from a scabbard, which she did not notice before. He has dropped into a squat. The blade of the sword glitters painfully under the killer security lights of the Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly. How sweet!\\n\\n It would be an understatement to say that the hookah boys are taken aback. But they are not scared so much as they are confused. Almost undoubtedly, most of them have guns. So why is this guy trying to bother them with a sword?\\n\\n She remembers that one of the multiple professions on Hiro\u0027s business card is Greatest sword fighter in the world. Can he really take out a whole clan of armed jeeks?\\n\\n The manager\u0027s hand clenches her upper arm -- like this is really going to stop her. She reaches across her body with the other hand and lets him have it with a brief squirt of Liquid Knuckles. He makes a muffled, distant grunt, his head snaps back, he lets go of her arm and staggers back wildly until he sprawls against another taxi, jamming the heels of both hands into his eye sockets. Wait a Sec. There\u0027s nobody in that particular taxi. But she can see a two-foot-long macrame keychain dangling from the ignition.\\n\\n She tosses her plank through the window of the taxi, dives in after it (she\u0027s small, opening the door is optional), climbs in behind the driver\u0027s seat, sinking into a deep nest of wooden beads and air fresheners, grinds the motor, and takes off. Backward. Headed for the rear parking lot. The car was pointed outward, in taxicab style, ready for a quick getaway, which would be fine if she were by herself -- but there is Hiro to think of. The radio is screaming, alive with hollered bursts of Taxilinga. She backs all the way around behind the Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly. The back lot is strangely quiet and empty.\\n\\n She shifts into drive and blasts back the way she came. The jeeks haven\u0027t quite had time to react, were expecting her to come out the other way. She screams it to a halt right next to Hiro, who has already had the presence of mind to put his sword back in its scabbard. He dives in the passenger-side window. Then she stops paying attention to him. She\u0027s got other stuff to look at, such as whether she\u0027s going to get broadsided as she pulls out onto the road.\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t get broadsided, though a car has to squeal around her. She guns it out onto the highway. It responds as only an ancient taxicab will.\\n\\n The only problem being that half a dozen other ancient taxicabs are now following them.\\n\\n Something is pressing against Y.T.\u0027s left thigh. She looks down. It is a remarkably huge revolver in a net bag hanging on the door panel. She has to find someplace to pull into. If she could find a Nova Sicilia franchulate, that would do it -- the Mafia owes her one. Or a New South Africa, which she hates. But the New South Africans hate jeeks even more.\\n\\n Scratch that, Hiro is black, or at least part black. Can\u0027t take him into New South Africa. And because Y.T. is a Cauc, they can\u0027t go to Metazania.\\n\\n \"Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong,\" Hiro says. \"Half mile ahead on the right\"\\n\\n \"Nice thinkin\u0027 -- but they won\u0027t let you in with your swords, will they?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he says, \"because I\u0027m a Citizen.\"\\n\\n Then she sees it. The sign stands out because it is a rare one. Don\u0027t see many of these. It is a green-and-blue sign, soothing and calm in a glare-torn franchise ghetto. It says:\\n\\n MR. LEE\u0027S GREATER HONG KONG\\n\\n Explosive noise from in back. Her head smacks into the whiplash arrestor. Another taxi rear-ended them.\\n\\n And she screams into the parking lot of Mr. Lee\u0027s doing seventy-five. The security system doesn\u0027t even have time to rez her visa and drop the STD, so it\u0027s Severe Tire Damage all the way, those bald radials are left behind on the spikes. Sparking along on four naked rims, she shrieks to a stop on the lawngrid, which doubles as carbon dioxide-eating turf and impervious parking lot.\\n\\n She and Hiro climb out of the car.\\n\\n Hiro is grinning wildly, pinioned in the crossfire of a dozen red laser beams scanning him from every direction at once. The Hong Kong robot security system is checking him out. Her, too; she looks down to see the lasers scribbling across her chest.\\n\\n \"Welcome to Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong, Mr.Protagonist,\" the security system says through a PA. speaker. \"And welcome to your guest, Ms. Y.T.\"\\n\\n The other taxis have stopped in formation along the curb.\\n\\n Several of them overshot the Hong Kong franchise and had to back up a block or so. A barrage of doors thunking shut. Some of them don\u0027t bother, just leave the engines running and the doors wide open. Three jeeks linger on the sidewalk, eyeing the tire shreds impaled on spikes: long streaks of neoprene sprouting steel and fiberglass hairs, like ruined toupees. One of them has a revolver in his hand, pointed straight down at the sidewalk.\\n\\n Four more jeeks run up to join them. Y.T. counts two more revolvers and a pump shotgun. Any more of these guys and they\u0027ll be able to form a government.\\n\\n They step carefully over the spikes and onto the lush Hong Kong lawngrid. As they do, the lasers appear once more. The jeeks turn all red and grainy for a second.\\n\\n Then something different happens. Lights come on. The security system wants better illumination on these people.\\n\\n Hong Kong franchulates are famous for their lawngrids -- who ever heard of a lawn you could park on? -- and for their antennas. They all look like NASA research facilities with their antennas. Some of them are satellite uplinks, pointed at the sky. But some of them, tiny little antennas, are pointed at the ground, at the lawngrid.\\n\\n Y.T. does not really get this, but these small antennas are millimeter-wave radar transceivers. Like any other radar, they are good at picking up metallic objects. Unlike the radar in an air traffic control center, they can rez fine details. The rez of a system is only as fine as its wavelength; since the wavelength of this radar is about a millimeter, it can see the fillings in your teeth, the grommets in your Converse high-tops, the rivets in your Levi\u0027s. It can calculate the value of your pocket change.\\n\\n Seeing guns is not a problem. This thing can even tell if the guns are loaded, and with what sort of ammunition. That is an important function, because guns are illegal in Mr. Lee\u0027s Greater Hong Kong.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/678.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
