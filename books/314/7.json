{"id":20981,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"White Columns, like most Burbclaves, has no jail, no police station. So unsightly. Property values. Think of the liability exposure. MetaCops has a franchise just down the road that serves as headquarters. As for a jail, some place to habeas the occasional stray corpus, any half-decent franchise strip has one.\n They are cruising in the Mobile Unit. Y.T.\u0027s hands are cuffed together in front of her. One hand is still half-encased in rubbery goo, smelling so intensely of vinyl fumes that both MetaCops have rolled down their windows. Six feet of loose fibers trail into her lap, across the floor of the Unit, out the door, and drag on the pavement The MetaCops are taking it easy, cruising down the middle lane, not above issuing a speeding ticket here and there as long as they\u0027re in their jurisdiction. Motorists around them drive slowly and sanely, appalled by the thought of having to pull over and listen to half an hour of disclaimers, advisements, and tangled justifications from the likes of these. The occasional CosaNostra delivery boy whips past them in the left lane, orange lights aflame, and they pretend not to notice.\n \"What\u0027s it gonna be, the Hoosegow or The Clink?\" the first MetaCop says. From the way he is talking, he must be talking to the other MetaCop.\n \"The Hoosegow, please,\" Y.T. says.\n \"The Clink!\" the other MetaCop says, turning around, sneering at her through the antiballistic glass, wallowing in power.\n The whole interior of the car lights up as they drive past a Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly. Loiter in the parking lot of a Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly and you\u0027d get a suntan. Then WorldBeat Security would come and arrest you. All that security-inducing light makes the Visa and MasterCard stickers on the driver\u0027s-side window glow for a moment.\n \"Y.T. is card-carrying,\" Y.T. says. \"What does it cost to get off?\"\n \"How come you keep calling yourself Whitey?\" the second MetaCop says. Like many people of color, he has misconstrued her name.\n \"Not whitey. Y.T.,\" The first MetaCop says.\n \"That\u0027s what Y.T. is called,\" Y.T. says.\n \"That\u0027s what I said,\" the second MetaCop says. \"Whitey.\"\n \"Y.T.,\" the first one says, accenting the T so brutally that he throws a glittering burst of saliva against the windshield. \"Let me guess -- Yolanda Truman?\"\n \"Yvonne Thomas?\"\n \"What\u0027s it stand for?\"\n \"Nothing?\"\n Actually, it stands for Yours Truly, but if they can\u0027t figure that out, fuck \u0027em.\n \"You can\u0027t afford it,\" the first MetaCop says. \"You\u0027re going up against TMAWH here.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have to officially get off. I could just escape.\"\n \"This is a class Unit. We don\u0027t support escapes,\" the first MetaCop says.\n \"Tell you what,\" the second one says. \"You pay us a trillion bucks and we\u0027ll take you to a Hoosegow. Then you can bargain with them.\"\n \"Half a trillion,\" Y.T. says.\n \"Seven hundred and fifty billion,\" the MetaCop says. \"Final. Shit, you\u0027re wearing cuffs, you can\u0027t be bargaining with us.\"\n Y.T. unzips a pocket on the thigh of her coverall, pulls out the card with her clean hand, runs it through a slot on the back of the front seat, puts it back in her pocket.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/672.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
