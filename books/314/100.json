{"id":21074,"no":100,"title":"Chapter 100","content":"Hiro loses Raven a few miles outside of Downtown, but it doesn\u0027t matter by this point; he goes straight to the plaza and then starts to orbit the rim of the amphitheater at high speed, a one-man picket fence. Raven makes his approach within a few seconds. Hiro breaks out of his orbit and heads straight for him, and they come together like a couple of medieval jousters. Hiro loses his left arm and Raven drops a leg. The limbs topple to the ground. Hiro drops his katana and uses his remaining arm to draw his one-handed sword -- a better match for Raven\u0027s long knife anyway. He cuts Raven off just as he\u0027s about to plummet over the lip of the amphitheater and forces him aside; Raven\u0027s momentum takes him half a mile away in half a second. Hiro chases him down by following a series of educated guesses -- he knows this territory like Raven knows the currents of the Aleutians -- and then they are blasting through the narrow streets of the Metaverse\u0027s financial district, waving long knives at each other, slicing and dicing hundreds of pinstriped avatars who happen to get in their way. But they never seem to hit each other. The speeds are just too great, the targets too small. Hiro\u0027s been lucky so far -- he has got Raven caught up in the thrill of competition, made him spoil for a fight. But Raven doesn\u0027t need this. He can get back to the amphitheater pretty easily without bothering to kill Hiro first. And finally, he realizes it. He sheathes his knife and dives into an alley between skyscrapers. Hiro follows him, but by the time he\u0027s gotten into that same alley, Raven\u0027s gone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/765.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
