{"id":21044,"no":70,"title":"Chapter 70","content":"As Hiro crests the pass on his motorcycle at five in the morning, the town of Port Sherman, Oregon, is suddenly laid out before him: a flash of yellow loglo wrapped into a vast U-shaped valley that was ground out of the rock, a long time ago, by a big tongue of ice in an epochal period of geological cunnilingus. There is just a light dusting of gold around the edges where it fades into the rain forest, thickening and intensifying as it approaches the harbor -- a long narrow fjordlike notch cut into the straight coastline of Oregon, a deep cold trench of black water heading straight out to Japan. Hiro\u0027s back on the Rim again. Feels good after that night ride through the sticks. Too many rednecks, too many mounties. Even from ten miles away and a mile above, it\u0027s not a pretty sight. Farther away from the central harbor district, Hiro can make out a few speckles of red, which is a little better than the yellow. He wishes he could see something in green or blue or purple, but there don\u0027t seem to be any neighborhoods done up in those gourmet colors. But then this isn\u0027t exactly a gourmet job. He rides half a mile off the road, sits down on a flat rock in an open space -- ambush-proof, more or less -- and goggles into the Metaverse. \"Librarian?\" \"Yes, sir?\" \"Inanna.\" \"A figure from Sumerian mythology. Later cultures knew her as Ishtar, or Esther.\" \"Good goddess or bad goddess?\" \"Good. A beloved goddess.\" \"Did she have any dealings with Enki or Asherah?\" \"Mostly with Enki. She and Enki were on good and bad terms at different times. Inanna was known as the queen of all the great me.\" \"I thought the me belonged to Enki.\" \"They did. But Inanna went to the Abzu -- the watery fortress in the city of Eridu where Enki stored up the me -- and got Enki to give her all the me. This is how the me were released into civilization.\" \"Watery fortress, huh?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How did Enki feel about this?\" \"He gave them to her willingly, apparently because he was drunk, and besotted with Inanna\u0027s physical charms. When he sobered up, he tried to chase her down and get them back, but she outsmarted him.\" \"Let\u0027s get semiotic,\" Hiro mumbles. \"The Raft is L. Bob Rife\u0027s watery fortress. That\u0027s where he stores up all of his stuff. All of his me. Juanita went to Astoria, which was as close as you could get to the Raft a couple of days ago. I think she\u0027s trying to pull an Inanna.\" \"In another popular Sumerian myth,\" the Librarian says, \"Inanna descends into the nether world.\" \"Go on,\" Hiro says. \"She gathers together all of her me and enters the land of no return.\" \"Great.\" \"She passes through the nether world and reaches the temple that is ruled over by Ereshkigal, goddess of Death. She is traveling under false pretenses, which are easily penetrated by the all-seeing Ereshkigal. But Ereshkigal allows her to enter the temple. As Inanna enters, her robes and jewels and me are stripped from her and she is brought, stark naked, before Ereshkigal and the seven judges of the underworld. The judges \u0027fastened their eyes upon her, the eyes of death; at their word, the word which tortures the spirit, Inanna was turned into a corpse, a piece of rotting meat, and was hung from a hook on the wall.\u0027 Kramer.\" \"Wonderful. Why the hell would she do something like that?\" \"As Diane Wolkstein puts it, \u0027Inanna gave up all she had accomplished in life until she was stripped naked, with nothing remaining but her will to be reborn ... because of her journey to the underworld, she took on the powers and mysteries of death and rebirth.\u0027\" \"Oh. So I guess there\u0027s more to the story?\" \"Inanna\u0027s messenger waits for three days, and when she fails to return from the nether world, goes to the gods asking for their help. None of the gods is willing to help except for Enki.\" \"So our buddy, Enki, the hacker god, has to bail her ass out of Hell.\" \"Enki creates two people and sends them into the netherworid to rescue Inanna. Through their magic, Inanna is brought back to life. She returns from the netherworld, followed by a host of the dead.\" \"Juanita went to the Raft three days ago,\" Hiro says. \"It\u0027s time to get hacking.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/735.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
