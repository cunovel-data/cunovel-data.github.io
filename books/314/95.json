{"id":21069,"no":95,"title":"Chapter 95","content":"Raven\u0027s already on the motorcycle. If Hiro chases him on foot, he might catch him before he reaches the Street.\n But he might not. In that case, Raven would be on his way to Downtown at tens of thousands of miles per hour while Hiro was still trying to get back to his own motorcycle. At those speeds, once Hiro has lost sight of Raven, he\u0027s lost him forever.\n Raven starts his bike, begins maneuvering carefully through the tangle, headed for the exit. Hiro takes off as fast as his invisible legs can carry him, headed straight for the wall.\n He punches through a couple of seconds later, runs back to the Street. His tiny little invisible avatar can\u0027t operate the motorcycle, so he returns to his normal look, hops on his bike, and gets it turned around. Looking back, he sees Raven riding out toward the Street, the logic bomb glowing a soft blue, like heavy water in a reactor. He doesn\u0027t even see Hiro yet.\n Now\u0027s his chance. He draws his katana, aims his bike at Raven, pumps it up to sixty or so miles an hour. No point in coming in too fast; the only way to kill Raven\u0027s avatar is to take its head off. Running it over with the motorcycle won\u0027t have any effect.\n A security daemon is running toward Raven, waving his arms. Raven looks up, sees Hiro bearing down on him, and bursts forward. The sword cuts air behind Raven\u0027s head.\n It\u0027s too late. Raven must be gone now -- but turning himself around, Hiro can see him in the middle of the Street. He slammed into one of the stanchions that holds up the monorail track -- a perennial irritation to high-speed motorcyclists.\n \"Shit!\" both of them say simultaneously.\n Raven gets turned toward Downtown and twists his throttle just as Hiro is pulling in behind him on the Street, doing the same. Within a couple of seconds, they\u0027re both headed for Downtown at something like fifty thousand miles an hour. Hiro\u0027s half a mile behind Raven but can see him clearly: the streetlights have merged into a smooth twin streak of yellow, and Raven blazes in the middle, a storm of cheap color and big pixels.\n \"If I can take his head off, they\u0027re finished,\" Hiro says.\n \"Gotcha,\" Juanita says. \"Because if you kill Raven, he gets kicked out of the system. And he can\u0027t sign back on until the Graveyard Daemons dispose of his avatar.\"\n \"And I control the Graveyard Daemons. So all I have to do is kill the bastard once.\"\n \"Once they get their choppers back to land, they\u0027ll have better access to the net -- they can have someone else go into the Metaverse and take over for him,\" Juanita warns.\n \"Wrong. Because Uncle Enzo and Mr. Lee are waiting for them on land. They have to do it during the next hour, or never.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/760.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
