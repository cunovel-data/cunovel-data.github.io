{"id":21037,"no":63,"title":"Chapter 63","content":"Lagerquist is standing right on the edge of Mark Norman\u0027s 24/7 Motorcycle Mall, waiting, when the man with the swords comes into view, striding down the sidewalk. A pedestrian is a peculiar sight in L.A., considerably more peculiar than a man with swords. But a welcome one. Anyone who drives out to a motorcycle dealership already has a car, by definition, so it\u0027s hard to give them a really hard sell. A pedestrian should be cake. \"Scott Wilson Lagerquist!\" the guy yells from fifty feet away and closing. \"How you doing?\" \"Fabulous!\" Scott says. A little off guard, maybe. Can\u0027t remember this guy\u0027s name, which is a problem. Where has he seen this guy before? \"It\u0027s great to see you!\" Scott says, running forward and pumping the guy\u0027s hand. \"I haven\u0027t seen you since, uh -- \" \"Is Pinky here today?\" the guy says. \"Pinky?\" \"Yeah. Mark. Mark Norman. Pinky was his nickname back in college. I guess he probably doesn\u0027t like to be called that now that he\u0027s running, what, half a dozen dealerships, three McDonaldses, and a Holiday Inn, huh?\" \"I didn\u0027t know that Mr.Norman was into fast food also.\" \"Yeah. He\u0027s got three franchises down around Long Beach. Owns them through a limited partnership, actually. Is he here today?\" \"No, he\u0027s on vacation.\" \"Oh, yeah. In Corsica. The Ajaccio Hyatt. Room 543. That\u0027s right, I completely forgot about that.\" \"Well, were you just stopping by to say hi, or -- \" \"Nah. I was going to buy a motorcycle.\" \"Oh. What kind of motorcycle were you looking for?\" \"One of the new Yamahas? With the new generation smartwheels?\" Scott grins manfully, trying to put the best face on the awful fact that he is about to reveal. \"I know exactly the one you mean. But I\u0027m sorry to tell you that we don\u0027t actually have one in stock today.\" \"You don\u0027t?\" \"We don\u0027t. It\u0027s a brand-new model. Nobody has them.\" \"You sure? Because you ordered one.\" \"We did?\" \"Yeah. A month ago.\" Suddenly the guy cranes his neck, looks over Scott\u0027s shoulder down the boulevard. \"Well, speak of the devil. Here it comes.\" A Yamaha semi is pulling into the truck entrance with a new shipment of motorcycles in the back. \"It\u0027s on that truck,\" the guy says. \"If you can give me one of your cards, I\u0027ll jot down the vehicle identification number on back so you can pull it off the truck for me.\" \"This was a special order made by Mr.Norman?\" \"He claimed he was just ordering it as a display model, you know. But it sort of has my name on it.\" \"Yes, sir. I understand totally.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/728.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
