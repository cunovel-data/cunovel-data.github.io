{"id":20991,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"Right in front of the Hong Kong franchise, Y.T. notices a black Town Car that has been sitting there for a while. She doesn\u0027t have to see the plates to know it\u0027s Mafia. Only the Mafia drives cars like that. The windows are blackened, but she knows someone\u0027s in there keeping an eye on her. How do they do it? You see these Town Cars everywhere, but you never see them move, never see them get anyplace. She\u0027s not even sure they have engines in them.\n \"Okay. Sorry,\" Hiro says. \"I keep my own thing going, but we have a partnership for any intel you can dig up. Fifty-fifty split.\"\n \"Deal,\" she says, climbing onto her plank.\n \"Call me anytime. You have my card.\"\n \"Hey, that reminds me. Your card said you\u0027re into the three Ms of software.\"\n \"Yeah. Music, movies, and microcode.\"\n \"You heard of Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns?\"\n \"No. Is that a band?\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s the greatest band. You should check it out, homeboy, it\u0027s going to be the next big thing.\"\n She coasts out onto the road and poons an Audi with Blooming Greens license plates. It ought to take her home. Mom\u0027s probably in bed, pretending to sleep, being worried.\n Half a block from the entrance to Blooming Greens, she unpoons the Audi and coasts into a McDonald\u0027s. She goes into the ladies\u0027. It has a hung ceiling. She stands on the seat of the third toilet, pushes up one of the ceiling tiles, moves it aside. A cotton sleeve tumbles out, bearing a delicate floral print. She pulls on it and hauls down the whole ensemble, the blouse, the pleated skirt, underwear from Vicky\u0027s, the leather shoes, the necklace and earrings, even a fucking purse. She takes off her RadiKS coverall, wads it up, sticks it into the ceiling, replaces the loose tile. Then she puts on the ensemble. Now she looks just like she did when she had breakfast with Mom this morning. She carries her plank down the street to Blooming Greens, where it\u0027s legal to carry them but not to put them on the \u0027crete. She flashes her passport at the border post, walks a quarter of a mile down crisp new sidewalks, and up to the house where the porch light is on.\n Mom\u0027s sitting in the den, in front of her computer, as usual. Mom works for the Feds. Feds don\u0027t make much money, but they have to work hard, to show their loyalty.\n Y.T. goes in and looks at her mother, who has slumped down in her chair, put her hands around her face almost like she\u0027s vogueing, put bare stockinged feet up. She wears these awful cheap Fed stockings that are like scouring cloth, and when she walks, her thighs rub together underneath her skirt and make a rasping noise. There is a heavy-duty Ziploc bag on the table, full of water that used to be ice a couple of hours ago. Y.T. looks at Mom\u0027s left arm. She has rolled up her sleeve to expose the fresh bruise, just above her elbow, where they put the blood-pressure cuff. Weekly Fed polygraph test.\n \"Is that you?\" Mom shouts, not realizing that Y.T.\u0027s in the room.\n Y.T. retreats into the kitchen so she won\u0027t surprise her mother. \"Yeah, Mom,\" she shouts back. \"How was your day?\"\n \"I\u0027m tired,\" Mom says. It\u0027s what she always says.\n Y.T. pinches a beer from the fridge and starts running a hot bath. It makes a roaring sound that relaxes her, like the white-noise generator on Mom\u0027s nightstand.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/682.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
