{"id":21059,"no":85,"title":"Chapter 85","content":"Y.T. waits so long that she thinks the sun must have come up by now, but she knows it can\u0027t really be more than a couple of hours. In a way, it doesn\u0027t even matter. Nothing ever changes: the music plays, the cartoon videotape rewinds itself and starts up again, men come in and drink and try not to get caught staring at her. She might as well be shackled to the table anyway; there\u0027s no way she could ever find her way back home from here. So she waits.\n Suddenly, Raven\u0027s standing in front of her. He\u0027s wearing different clothes, wet slippery clothing made out of animal skins or something. His face is red and wet from being outside.\n \"You get your job all done?\"\n \"Sort of,\" Raven says. \"I did enough.\"\n \"What do you mean, enough?\"\n \"I mean I don\u0027t like being called out of a date to do bullshit work,\" Raven says. \"So I got things in order out there and my attitude is, let his gnomes worry about the details.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ve been having a great time here.\"\n \"Sorry, baby. Let\u0027s get out of here,\" he says, speaking with the intense, strained tones of a man with an erection.\n \"Let\u0027s go to the Core,\" he says, once they get into the cool air above deck.\n \"What\u0027s there?\"\n \"Everything,\" he says. \"The people who run this whole place. Most of these people\" -- he waves his hand out over the Raft -- \"can\u0027t go there. I can. Want to see it?\"\n \"Sure, why not,\" she says, hating herself for sounding like such a sap. But what else is she going to say?\n He starts leading her down a long moonlit series of gangplanks, in toward the big ships in the middle of the Raft. You could almost skate here, but you\u0027d have to be really good.\n \"Why are you different from the other people?\" Y.T. says. She kind of blurts it out without doing a whole lot of thinking first. But it seems like a good question.\n He laughs. \"I\u0027m an Aleut. I\u0027m different in a lot of ways -- \"\n \"No. I mean your brain works in a different way,\" Y.T. says. \"You\u0027re not wacked out. You know what I mean? You haven\u0027t mentioned the Word all night.\"\n \"We have a thing we do in kayaks. It\u0027s like surfing,\" Raven says.\n \"Really? I surf, too -- in traffic,\" Y.T. says.\n \"We don\u0027t do this for fun,\" Raven says. \"It\u0027s part of how we live. We get from island to island by surfing on waves.\"\n \"Same here,\" Y.T. says, \"except we go from one franchulate to the next by surfing on cars.\"\n \"See, the world is full of things more powerful than us. But if you know how to catch a ride, you can go places,\" Raven says.\n \"Right. I\u0027m totally hip to what you\u0027re saying.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing with the Orthos. I agree with some of their religion. But not all of it. But their movement has a lot of power. They have a lot of people and money and ships.\"\n \"And you\u0027re surfing on it.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"That\u0027s cool, I can relate. What are you trying to do? I mean, what\u0027s your real goal?\"\n They\u0027re crossing a big broad platform. Suddenly he\u0027s right behind her, his arms are around her body, and he draws her back into him. Her toes are just barely touching the ground. She can feel his cool nose against her temple and his hot breath coming into one ear. It sends a tingle straight down to her toes.\n \"Short-term goal or long-term goal?\" Raven whispers.\n \"Um -- long term.\"\n \"I used to have this plan -- I was going to nuke America.\"\n \"Oh. Well, that\u0027d be kind of harsh,\" she says.\n \"Maybe. Depends on what kind of a mood I\u0027m in. Other than that, no long-term goals.\" Every time he whispers something, another breath tickles her ear.\n \"How about medium-term then?\u0027\n \"In a few hours, the Raft comes apart,\" Raven says. \u0027We\u0027re headed for California. Looking for a decent place to live. Some people might try to stop us. It\u0027s my job to help the people make it safe and sound up onto the shore. So you might say I\u0027m going to war.\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a shame,\" she mumbles.\n \"So it\u0027s hard to think of anything besides the here and now.\"\n \"Yeah, I know.\"\n \"I rented a nice room to spend my last night in,\" Raven says. \"It\u0027s got clean sheets.\"\n Not for long, she thinks.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/750.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
