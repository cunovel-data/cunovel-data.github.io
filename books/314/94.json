{"id":21068,"no":94,"title":"Chapter 94","content":"From Hiro\u0027s front yard to L. Bob Rife\u0027s black cube at Port 127 is halfway around the Metaverse, a distance of 32,768 kilometers. The only hard part, really, is getting out of Downtown. He can ride his bike straight through the avatars as usual, but the Street is also cluttered with vehicles, animercials, commercial displays, public plazas, and other bits of solid-looking software that get in his way. Not to mention a few distractions. Off to his right, about a kilometer away from The Black Sun, is a deep hole in the hyperManhattan skyline. It is an open plaza about a mile wide, a park of sorts where avatars can gather for concerts and conventions and festivals. Most of it is occupied by a deep-dish amphitheater that is capable of seating close to a million avatars at once. Down at the bottom is a huge circular stage. Normally, the stage is occupied by major rock groups. Tonight, it is occupied by the grandest and most brilliant computer hallucinations that the human mind can invent. A three-dimensional marquee hangs above it, announcing tonight\u0027s event: a benefit graphics concert staged on behalf of Da5id Meier, who is still hospitalized with an inexplicable disease. The amphitheater is half filled with hackers. Once he gets out of Downtown, Hiro twists his throttle up to the max and covers the remaining thirty-two thousand and some kilometers in the space of about ten minutes. Over his head, the express trains are whooshing down the track at a metaphorical speed of ten thousand miles per hour, he passes them like they\u0027re standing still. This only works because he\u0027s riding in an absolutely straight line. He\u0027s got a routine coded into his motorcycle software that makes it follow the monorail track automatically so that he doesn\u0027t even have to worry about steering it. Meanwhile, Juanita\u0027s standing next to him in Reality. She\u0027s got another pair of goggles; she can see all the same things that Hiro sees. \"Rife\u0027s got a mobile uplink on his corporate chopper, just like the one on commercial airliners, so he can patch into the Metaverse when he\u0027s in the air. As long as he\u0027s airborne, that\u0027s his only link to the Metaverse. We may be able to hack our way into that one link and block it or something ... \" \"That low-level communications stuff is too full of medicine for us to mess with it in this decade,\" Hiro says, braking his motorcycle to a stop. \"Holy shit. It\u0027s just like Y.T. described it.\" He\u0027s in front of Port 127. Rife\u0027s black cube is there, just as Y.T. described it. There\u0027s no door. Hiro starts walking away from the Street, toward the cube. It reflects no light at all, so he can\u0027t tell whether it\u0027s ten feet or ten miles away from him until the security daemons begin to materialize. There are half a dozen of them, all big sturdy avatars in blue coveralls, sort of quasi-military looking, but without rank. They don\u0027t need rank because they\u0027re all running the same program. They materialize around him in a neat semicircle with a radius of about ten feet, blocking Hiro\u0027s way to the cube. Hiro mumbles a word under his breath and vanishes -- he slips into his invisible avatar. It would be very interesting to bang around and see how these security daemons deal with it, but right now he has to get moving before they get a chance to adjust. They don\u0027t, at least not very well. Hiro runs between two of the security daemons and heads for the wall of the cube. He finally gets there, slamming into it, coming to a dead stop. The security daemons have all turned around and are chasing him. They can figure out where he is -- the computer tells them that much -- but they can\u0027t do much to him. Like the bouncer daemons in The Black Sun, which Hiro helped write, they shove people around by applying basic rules of avatar physics. When Hiro is invisible, there is very little for them to shove. But if they are well written, they may have more subtle ways of messing him up, so he\u0027s not wasting any time. He pokes his katana through the side of the cube and follows it through the wall and out the other side. This is a hack. It is really based on a very old hack, a loophole that he found years ago when he was trying to graft the sword-fighting rules onto the existing Metaverse software. His blade doesn\u0027t have the power to cut a hole in the wall -- this would mean permanently changing the shape of someone else\u0027s building -- but it does have the power to penetrate things. Avatars do not have that power. That is the whole purpose of a wall in the Metaverse; it is a structure that does not allow avatars to penetrate it. But like anything else in the Metaverse, this rule is nothing but a protocol, a convention that different computers agree to follow. In theory, it cannot be ignored. But in practice, it depends upon the ability of different computers to swap information very precisely, at high speed, and at just the right times. And when you are connected to the system over a satellite uplink, as Hiro is, out here on the Raft, there is a delay as the signals bounce up to the satellite and back down. That delay can be taken advantage of, if you move quickly and don\u0027t look back. Hiro passes right through the wall on the tail end of his all-penetrating katana. Rifeland is a vast, brightly lit space occupied by elementary shapes done up in primary colors. It is like being inside an educational toy designed to teach solid geometry to three-year-olds: cubes, spheres, tetrahedrons, polyhedrons, connected with a web of cylinders and lines and helices. But in this case, it has gone way, way out of control, as if every Tinkertoy set and Lego block ever made had been slapped together according to some long-forgotten scheme. Hiro\u0027s been around the Metaverse long enough to know that despite the bright cheery appearance of this thing, it is, in fact, as simple and utilitarian as an Army camp. This is a model of a system. A big complicated system. The shapes probably represent computers, or central nodes in Rife\u0027s worldwide network, or Pearly Gates franchises, or any other kind of local and regional offices that Rife has going around the world. By clambering over this structure and going into those bright shapes, Hiro could probably uncover some of the code that makes Rife\u0027s network operate. He could, perhaps, try to hack it up, as Juanita suggested. But there is no point in messing with something he doesn\u0027t understand. He might waste hours fooling around with some piece of code only to find out that it was the software to control the automatic toilet flushers at Rife Bible College. So Hiro keeps moving, keeps looking up at the tangle of shapes, trying to find a pattern. He knows, now, that he has found his way into the boiler room of the entire Metaverse. But he has no idea what he\u0027s looking for. This system, he realizes, really consists of several separate networks all tangled together in the same space. There\u0027s an extremely complicated tangle of fine red lines, millions of them, running back and forth between thousands of small red balls. Just as a wild guess, Hiro figures that this may represent Rife\u0027s fiber-optics network, with its innumerable local offices and nodes spread all over the world. There are a number of less complicated networks in other colors, which might represent coaxial lines, such as they used to use for cable television, or even voice phone lines. And there is a crude, heavily built, blocky network all done up in blue. It consists of a small number -- fewer than a dozen -- of big blue cubes. They are connected to each other, but to nothing else, by massive blue tubes; the tubes are transparent, and inside of them, Hiro can see bundles of smaller connections in various colors. It has taken Hiro a while to see all of this, because the blue cubes are nearly obscured; they are all surrounded by little red balls and other small nodes, like trees being overwhelmed with kudzu. It appears to be an older, preexisting network of some kind, with its own internal channels, mostly primitive ones like voice phone. Rife has patched into it, heavily, with his own, higher-tech systems. Hiro maneuvers until he can get a closer look at one of the blue cubes, peering through the clutter of lines that has grown around it. The blue cube has a big white star on each of its six faces. \"It\u0027s the Government of the United States,\" Juanita says. \"Where hackers go to die,\" Hiro says. The largest, and yet the least efficient, producer of computer software in the world. Hiro and Y.T. have eaten a lot of junk food together in different joints all over L.A. -- doughnuts, burritos, pizza, sushi, you name it -- and all Y.T. ever talks about is her mother and the terrible job that she has with the Feds. The regimentation. The lie-detector tests. The fact that for all the work she does, she really has no idea what it is that the government is really working on. It\u0027s always been a mystery to Hiro, too, but then, that\u0027s how the government is. It was invented to do stuff that private enterprise doesn\u0027t bother with, which means that there\u0027s probably no reason for it; you never know what they\u0027re doing or why. Hackers have traditionally looked upon the government\u0027s coding sweatshops with horror and just tried to forget that all of that shit ever existed. But they have thousands of programmers. The programmers work twelve hours a day out of some twisted sense of personal loyalty. Their software-engineering techniques, while cruel and ugly, are very sophisticated. They must have been up to something. \"Juanita?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Don\u0027t ask me why I think this. But I think that the government has been undertaking a big software development project for L. Bob Rife.\" \"Makes sense,\" she says. \"He has such a love-hate relationship with his programmers -- he needs them, but he won\u0027t trust them. The government\u0027s the only organization he would trust to write something important. I wonder what it is?\" \"Hold on,\" Hiro says. \"Hold on.\" He is now a stone\u0027s throw away from a big blue cube sitting at ground level. All the other blue cubes sort of feed into it. There is a motorcycle parked next to the cube, rendered in color, but just one notch above black and white: big jaggedy pixels and a limited color palette. It has a sidecar. Raven\u0027s standing next to it. He is carrying something in his arms. It is another simple geometric construction, a long smooth blue ellipsoid a couple of feet in length. From the way he\u0027s moving, Hiro thinks that Raven has just removed it from the blue cube; he carries it over to the motorcycle and nestles it into the sidecar. \"The Big One,\" Hiro says. \"It\u0027s exactly what we were afraid of,\" Juanita says. \"Rife\u0027s revenge.\" \"Headed for the amphitheater. Where all the hackers are gathered in one place. Rife\u0027s going to infect all of them at once. He\u0027s going to burn their minds.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/759.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
