{"id":20984,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Her name is Juanita Marquez. Hiro has known her ever since they were freshmen together at Berkeley, and they were in the same lab section in a freshman physics class. The first time he saw her, he formed an impression that did not change for many years: She was a dour, bookish, geeky type who dressed like she was interviewing for a job as an accountant at a funeral parlor. At the same time, she had a flamethrower tongue that she would turn on people at the oddest times, usually in some grandiose, earth-scorching retaliation for a slight or breach of etiquette that none of the other freshmen had even perceived. It wasn\u0027t until a number of years later, when they both wound up working at Black Sun Systems, Inc., that he put the other half of the equation together. At the time, both of them were working on avatars. He was working on bodies, she was working on faces. She was the face department, because nobody thought that faces were all that important -- they were just flesh-toned busts on top of the avatars. She was just in the process of proving them all desperately wrong. But at this phase, the all-male society of bit-heads that made up the power structure of Black Sun Systems said that the face problem was trivial and superficial. It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists. That first impression, back at the age of seventeen, was nothing more than that -- the gut reaction of a post-adolescent Army brat who had been on his own for about three weeks. His mind was good, but he only understood one or two things in the whole world -- samurai movies and the Macintosh -- and he understood them far, far too well. It was a worldview with no room for someone like Juanita. There is a certain kind of small town that grows like a boil on the ass of every Army base in the world. In a long series of such places, Hiro Protagonist was speed-raised like a mutant hothouse orchid flourishing under the glow of a thousand Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly security spotlights. Hiro\u0027s father had joined the army in 1944, at the age of sixteen, and spent a year in the Pacific, most of it as a prisoner of war. Hiro was born when his father was in his late middle age. By that time, Dad could long since have quit and taken his pension, but he wouldn\u0027t have known what to do with himself outside of the service, and so he stayed in until they finally kicked him out in the late eighties. By the time Hiro made it out to Berkeley, he had lived in Wrightstown, New Jersey; Tacoma, Washington; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Hinesville, Georgia; Killeen, Texas; Grafenwehr, Germany; Seoul, Korea; Ogden, Kansas; and Watertown, New York. All of these places were basically the same, with the same franchise ghettos, the same strip joints, and even the same people -- he kept running into school chums he\u0027d known years before, other Army brats who happened to wind up at the same base at the same time. Their skins were different colors but they all belonged to the same ethnic group: Military. Black kids didn\u0027t talk like black kids. Asian kids didn\u0027t bust their asses to excel in school. White kids, by and large, didn\u0027t have any problem getting along with the black and Asian kids. And girls knew their place. They all had the same moms with the same generous buttocks in stretchy slacks and the same frosted-and-curling-ironed hairdos, and they were all basically sweet and endearing and conforming and, if they happened to be smart, they went out of their way to hide it. So the first time Hiro saw Juanita, or any other girl like her, his perspectives were bent all out of shape. She had long, glossy black hair that had never been subjected to any chemical process other than regular shampooing. She didn\u0027t wear blue stuff on her eyelids. Her clothing was dark, tailored, restrained. And she didn\u0027t take shit from anyone, not even her professors, which seemed shrewish and threatening to him at the time. When he saw her again after an absence of several years -- a period spent mostly in Japan, working among real grown-ups from a higher social class than he was used to, people of substance who wore real clothes and did real things with their lives -- he was startled to realize that Juanita was an elegant, stylish knockout. He thought at first that she had undergone some kind of radical changes since their first year in college. But then he went back to visit his father in one of those Army towns and ran into the high school prom queen. She had grown up shockingly fast into an overweight dame with loud hair and loud clothes who speed-read the tabloids at the check-out line in the commissary because she didn\u0027t have the spare money to buy them, who popped her gum and had two kids that she didn\u0027t have the energy or the foresight to discipline. Seeing this woman at the commissary, he finally went through a belated, dim-witted epiphany, not a brilliant light shining down from heaven, more like the brown glimmer of a half-dead flashlight from the top of a stepladder: Juanita hadn\u0027t really changed much at all since those days, just grown into herself. It was he who had changed. Radically. He came into her office once, strictly on a business matter. Until this point, they had seen each other around the office a lot but acted like they had never met before. But when he came into her office that day, she told him to close the door behind him, and she blacked out the screen on her computer and started twiddling a pencil between her hands and eyed him like a plate of day-old sushi. Behind her on the wall was an amateurish painting of an old lady, set in an ornate antique frame. It was the only decoration in Juanita\u0027s office. All the other hackers had color photographs of the space shuttle lifting off, or posters of the starship Enterprise. \"It\u0027s my late grandmother, may God have mercy on her soul,\" she said, watching him look at the painting. \"My role model.\" \"Why? Was she a programmer?\" She just looked at him over the rotating pencil like, how slow can a mammal be and still have respiratory functions? But instead of lowering the boom on him, she just gave a simple answer: \"No.\" Then she gave a more complicated answer. \"When I was fifteen years old, I missed a period. My boyfriend and I were using a diaphragm, but I knew it was fallible. I was good at math, I had the failure rate memorized, burnt into my subconscious. Or maybe it was my conscious, I can never keep them straight. Anyway, I was terrified. Our family dog started treating me differently -- supposedly, they can smell a pregnant woman. Or a pregnant bitch, for that matter.\" By this point, Hiro\u0027s face was frozen in a wary, astonished position that Juanita later made extensive use of in her work. Because, as she was talking to him, she was watching his face, analyzing the way the little muscles in his forehead pulled his brows up and made his eyes change shape. \"My mother was clueless. My boyfriend was worse than clue-less -- in fact, I ditched him on the spot, because it made me realize what an alien the guy was -- like many members of your species.\" By this, she was referring to males. \"Anyway, my grandmother came to visit,\" she continued, glancing back over her shoulder at the painting. \"I avoided her until we all sat down for dinner. And then she figured out the whole situation in, maybe, ten minutes, just by watching my face across the dinner table. I didn\u0027t say more than ten words -- \u0027Pass the tortillas.\u0027 I don\u0027t know how my face conveyed that information, or what kind of internal wiring in my grandmother\u0027s mind enabled her to accomplish this incredible feat. To condense fact from the vapor of nuance.\" Condense fact from the vapor of nuance. Hiro has never forgotten the sound of her speaking those words, the feeling that came over him as he realized for the first time how smart Juanita was. She continued. \"I didn\u0027t even really appreciate all of this until about ten years later, as a grad student, trying to build a user interface that would convey a lot of data very quickly, for one of these baby-killer grants.\" This was her term for anything related to the Defense Department. \"I was coming up with all kinds of elaborate technical fixes like trying to implant electrodes directly into the brain. Then I remembered my grandmother and realized, my God, the human mind can absorb and process an incredible amount of information -- if it comes in the right format. The right interface. If you put the right face on it. Want some coffee?\" Then he had an alarming thought: What had he been like back in college? How much of an asshole had he been? Had he left Juanita with a bad impression? Another young man would have worried about it in silence, but Hiro has never been restrained by thinking about things too hard, and so he asked her out for dinner and, after having a couple of drinks (she drank club sodas), just popped the question: Do you think I\u0027m an asshole? She laughed. He smiled, believing that he had come up with a good, endearing, flirtatious bit of patter. He did not realize until a couple of years later that this question was, in effect, the cornerstone of their relationship. Did Juanita think that Hiro was an asshole? He always had some reason to think that the answer was yes, but nine times out of ten she insisted the answer was no. It made for some great arguments and some great sex, some dramatic fallings out and some passionate reconciliations, but in the end the wildness was just too much for them -- they were exhausted by work -- and they backed away from each other. He was emotionally worn out from wondering what she really thought of him, and confused by the fact that he cared so deeply about her opinion. And she, maybe, was begining to think that if Hiro was so convinced in his own mind that he was unworthy of her, maybe he knew something she didn\u0027t. Hiro would have chalked it all up to class differences, except that her parents lived in a house in Mexicali with a dirt floor, and his father made more money than many college professors. But the class idea still held sway in his mind, because class is more than income -- it has to do with knowing where you stand in a web of social relationships. Juanita and her folks knew where they stood with a certitude that bordered on dementia. Hiro never knew. His father was a sergeant major, his mother was a Korean woman whose people had been mine slaves in Nippon, and Hiro didn\u0027t know whether he was black or Asian or just plain Army, whether he was rich or poor, educated or ignorant, talented or lucky. He didn\u0027t even have a part of the country to call home until he moved to California, which is about as specific as saying that you live in the Northern Hemisphere. In the end, it was probably his general disorientation that did them in. After the breakup, Hiro went out with a long succession of essentially bimbos who (unlike Juanita) were impressed that he worked for a high-tech Silicon Valley firm. More recently, he has had to go searching for women who are even easier to impress. Juanita went celibate for a while and then started going out with Da5id and eventually got married to him. Da5id had no doubts whatsoever about his standing in the world. His folks were Russian Jews from Brooklyn and had lived in the same brownstone for seventy years after coming from a village in Latvia where they had lived for five hundred years; with a Torah on his lap, he could trace his bloodlines all the way back to Adam and Eve. He was an only child who had always been first in his class in everything, and when he got his master\u0027s in computer science from Stanford, he went out and started his own company with about as much fuss as Hiro\u0027s dad used to exhibit in renting out a new P.O. box when they moved. Then he got rich, and now he runs The Black Sun. Da5id has always been certain of everything. Even when he\u0027s totally wrong. Which is why Hiro quit his job at Black Sun Systems, despite the promise of future riches, and why Juanita divorced Da5id two years after she married him. Hiro did not attend Juanita and Da5id\u0027s wedding -- he was languishing in jail, into which he had been thrown a few hours before the rehearsal. He had been found in Golden Gate Park, lovesick, wearing nothing but a thong, taking long pulls from a jumbo bottle of Courvoisier and practicing kendo attacks with a genuine samurai sword, floating across the grass on powerfully muscled thighs to slice other picnickers\u0027 hurtling Frisbees and baseballs in twain. Catching a long fly ball with the edge of your blade, neatly halving it like a grapefruit, is not an insignificant feat. The only drawback is that the owners of the baseball may misinterpret your intentions and summon the police. He got out of it by paying for all the baseballs and Frisbees, but since that episode, he has never even bothered to ask Juanita whether or not she thinks he\u0027s an asshole. Even Hiro knows the answer now. Since then, they\u0027ve gone very different ways. In the early years of The Black Sun project, the only way the hackers ever got paid was by issuing stock to themselves. Hiro tended to sell his off almost as quickly as he got it. Juanita didn\u0027t. Now she\u0027s rich, and he isn\u0027t. It would be easy to say that Hiro is a stupid investor and Juanita a smart one, but the facts are a little more complicated than that: Juanita put her eggs in one basket, keeping all her money in Black Sun stock, as it turns out, she made a lot of money that way, but she could have gone broke, too. And Hiro didn\u0027t have a lot of choice in some ways. When his father got sick, the Army and the V.A. took care of most of his medical bills, but they ran into a lot of expenses anyway, and Hiro\u0027s mother -- who could barely speak English -- wasn\u0027t equipped to make or handle money on her own. When Hiro\u0027s father died, he cashed in all of his Black Sun stock to put Mom in a nice community in Korea. She loves it there. Goes golfing every day. He could have kept his money in The Black Sun and made ten million dollars about a year later when it went public, but his mother would have been a street person. So when his mother visits him in the Metaverse, looking tan and happy in her golfing duds, Hiro views that as his personal fortune. It won\u0027t pay the rent, but that\u0027s okay -- when you live in a shithole, there\u0027s always the Metaverse, and in the Metaverse, Hiro Protagonist is a warrior prince. His tongue is stinging; he realizes that, back in Reality, he has forgotten to swallow his beer. It\u0027s ironic that Juanita has come into this place in a low-tech, black-and-white avatar. She was the one who figured out a way to make avatars show something close to real emotion. That is a fact Hiro has never forgotten, because she did most of her work when they were together, and whenever an avatar looks surprised or angry or passionate in the Metaverse, he sees an echo of himself or Juanita -- the Adam and Eve of the Metaverse. Makes it hard to forget. Shortly after Juanita and Da5id got divorced, The Black Sun really took off. And once they got done counting their money, marketing the spinoffs, soaking up the adulation of others in the hacker community, they all came to the realization that what made this place a success was not the collision-avoidance algorithms or the bouncer daemons or any of that other stuff. It was Juanita\u0027s faces. Just ask the businessmen in the Nipponese Quadrant. They come here to talk turkey with suits from around the world, and they consider it just as good as a face-to-face. They more or less ignore what is being said -- a lot gets lost in translation, after all. They pay attention to the facial expressions and body language of the people they are talking to. And that\u0027s how they know what\u0027s going on inside a person\u0027s head-by condensing fact from the vapor of nuance. Juanita refused to analyze this process, insisted that it was something ineffable, something you couldn\u0027t explain with words. A radical, rosary-toting Catholic, she has no problem with that kind of thing. But the bitheads didn\u0027t like it. Said it was irrational mysticism. So she quit and took a job with some Nipponese company. They don\u0027t have any problem with irrational mysticism as long as it makes money. But Juanita never comes to The Black Sun anymore. Partly, she\u0027s pissed at Da5id and the other hackers who never appreciated her work. But she has also decided that the whole thing is bogus. That no matter how good it is, the Metaverse is distorting the way people talk to each other, and she wants no such distortion in her relationships. Da5id notices Hiro, indicates with a flick of his eyes that this is not a good time. Normally, such subtle gestures are lost in the system\u0027s noise, but Da5id has a very good personal computer, and Juanita helped design his avatar -- so the message comes through like a shot fired into the ceiling. Hiro turns away, saunters around the big circular bar in a slow orbit. Most of the sixty-four bar stools are filled with lower-level Industry people, getting together in twos and threes, doing what they do best: gossip and intrigue. \"So I get together with the director for a story conference. He\u0027s got this beach house -- \" \"Incredible?\" \"Don\u0027t get me started.\" \"I heard. Debi was there for a party when Frank and Mitzi owned it.\" \"Anyway, there\u0027s this scene, early, where the main character wakes up in a dumpster. The idea is to show how, you know, despondent he is -- \" \"That crazy energy -- \" \"Exactly.\" \"Fabulous.\" \"I like it. Well, he wants to replace it with a scene where the guy is out in the desert with a bazooka, blowing up old cars in an abandoned junkyard.\" \"You\u0027re kidding!\" \"So we\u0027re sitting there on his fucking patio over the beach and he\u0027s going, like, whoom! whoom! imitating this goddamn bazooka. He\u0027s thrilled by the idea. I mean, this is a man who wants to put a bazooka in a movie. So I think I talked him out of it.\" \"Nice scene. But you\u0027re right. A bazooka doesn\u0027t do the same thing as a dumpster.\" Hiro pauses long enough to get this down, then keeps walking. He mumbles \"Bigboard\" again, recalls the magic map, pinpoints his own location, and then reads off the name of this nearby screenwriter. Later on, he can do a search of industry publications to find out what script this guy is working on, hence the name of this mystery director with a fetish for bazookas. Since this whole conversation has come to him via his computer, he\u0027s just taken an audio tape of the whole thing. Later, he can process it to disguise the voices, then upload it to the Library, cross-referenced under the director\u0027s name. A hundred struggling screenwriters will call this conversation up, listen to it over and over until they\u0027ve got it memorized, paying Hiro for the privilege, and within a few weeks, bazooka scripts will flood the director\u0027s office. Whoom! The Rock Star Quadrant is almost too bright to look at. Rock star avatars have the hairdos that rock stars can only wear in their dreams. Hiro scans it briefly to see if any of his friends are in there, but it\u0027s mostly parasites and has-beens. Most of the people Hiro knows are will-bes or wannabes. The Movie Star Quadrant is easier to look at. Actors love to come here because in The Black Sun, they always look as good as they do in the movies. And unlike a bar or club in Reality, they can get into this place without physically having to leave their mansion, hotel suite, ski lodge, private airline cabin, or whatever. They can strut their stuff and visit with their friends without any exposure to kidnappers, paparazzi, script-flingers, assassins, ex-spouses, autograph brokers, process servers, psycho fans, marriage proposals, or gossip columnists. He gets up off the bar stool and resumes his slow orbit, scanning the Nipponese Quadrant. It\u0027s a lot of guys in suits, as usual. Some of them are talking to gringos from the Industry. And a large part of the quadrant, in the back corner, has been screened off by a temporary partition. Bigboard again. Hiro figures out which tables are behind the partition, starts reading off the names. The only one he recognizes immediately is an American: L. Bob Rife, the cable television monopolist. A very big name to the Industry, though he\u0027s rarely seen. He seems to be meeting with a whole raft of big Nipponese honchos. Hiro has his computer memorize their names so that, later, he can check them against the CIC database and find out who they are. It has the look of a big and important meeting. \"Secret Agent Hiro! How are you doing?\" Hiro turns around. Juanita is right behind him, standing out in her black-and-white avatar, looking good anyway. \"How are you?\" she asks. \"Fine. How are you?\" \"Great. I hope you don\u0027t mind talking to me in this ugly fax-of-life avatar.\" \"Juanita, I would rather look at a fax of you than most other women in the flesh.\" \"Thanks, you sly bastard. It\u0027s been a long time since we\u0027ve talked!\" she observes, as though there\u0027s something remarkable about this. Something\u0027s going on. \"I hope you\u0027re not going to mess around with Snow Crash,\" she says. \"Da5id won\u0027t listen to me.\" \"What am I, a model of self-restraint? I\u0027m exactly the kind of guy who would mess around with it.\" \"I know you better than that. You\u0027re impulsive. But you\u0027re very clever. You have those sword-fighting reflexes.\" \"What does that have to do with drug abuse?\u0027 \"It means you can see bad things coming and deflect them. It\u0027s an instinct, not a learned thing. As soon as you turned around and saw me, that look came over your face, like, what\u0027s going on? What the hell is Juanita up to?\" \"I didn\u0027t think you talked to people in the Metaverse.\" \"I do if I want to get through to someone in a hurry,\" she says. \"And I\u0027ll always talk to you.\" \"Why me?\" \"You know. Because of us. Remember? Because of our relationship -- when I was writing this thing -- you and I are the only two people who can ever have an honest conversation in the Metaverse.\" \"You\u0027re just the same mystical crank you always were,\" he says, smiling so as to make this a charming statement. \"You can\u0027t imagine how mystical and cranky l am now, Hiro.\" \"How mystical and cranky are you?\" She eyes him warily. Exactly the same way she did when he came into her office years ago. It comes into his mind to wonder why she is always so alert in his presence. In college, he used to think that she was afraid of his intellect, but he\u0027s known for years that this is the last of her worries. At Black Sun Systems, he figured that it was just typical female guardedness -- Juanita was afraid he was trying to get her into the sack. But this, too, is pretty much out of the question. At this late date in his romantic career, he is just canny enough to come up with a new theory: She\u0027s being careful because she likes him. She likes him in spite of herself. He is exactly the kind of tempting but utterly wrong romantic choice that a smart girl like Juanita must learn to avoid. That\u0027s definitely it. There\u0027s something to be said for getting older. By way of answering his question, she says, \"I have an associate I\u0027d like you to meet. A gentleman and a scholar named Lagos. He\u0027s a fascinating guy to talk to.\" \"Is he your boyfriend?\" She thinks this one over rather than lashing out instantaneously. \"My behavior at The Black Sun to the contrary, I don\u0027t fuck every male I work with. And even if I did, Lagos is out of the question.\" \"Not your type?\" \"Not by a long shot.\" \"What is your type, anyway?\" \"Old, rich, unimaginative blonds with steady careers.\" This one almost slips by him. Then he catches it. \"Well, I could dye my hair. And I\u0027ll get old eventually.\" She actually laughs. It\u0027s a tension-releasing kind of outburst. \"Believe me, Hiro, I\u0027m the last person you want to be involved with at this point.\" \"Is this part of your church thing?\" he asks. Juanita has been using her excess money to start her own branch of the Catholic church -- she considers herself a missionary to the intelligent atheists of the world. \"Don\u0027t be condescending,\" she says. \"That\u0027s exactly the attitude I\u0027m fighting. Religion is not for simpletons.\" \"Sorry. This is unfair, you know -- you can read every expression on my face, and I\u0027m looking at you through a fucking blizzard.\" \"It\u0027s definitely related to religion,\" she says. \"But this is so complex, and your background in that area is so deficient, I don\u0027t know where to begin.\" \"Hey, I went to church every week in high school. I sang in the choir.\" \"I know. That\u0027s exactly the problem. Ninety-nine percent of everything that goes on in most Christian churches has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual religion. Intelligent people all notice this sooner or later, and they conclude that the entire one hundred percent is bullshit, which is why atheism is connected with being intelligent in people\u0027s minds.\" \"So none of that stuff I learned in church has anything to do with what you\u0027re talking about?\" Juanita thinks for a while, eyeing him. Then she pulls a hypercard out of her pocket. \"Here. Take this.\" As Hiro pulls it from her hand, the hypercard changes from a jittery two-dimensional figment into a realistic, cream-colored, finely textured piece of stationery. Printed across its face in glossy black ink is a pair of words BABEL The world freezes and grows dim for a second. The Black Sun loses its smooth animation and begins to move in fuzzy stop-action. Clearly, his computer has just taken a major hit; all of its circuits are busy processing a huge bolus of data -- the contents of the hypercard -- and don\u0027t have time to redraw the image of The Black Sun in its full, breathtaking fidelity. \"Holy shit!\" he says, when The Black Sun pops back into full animation again. \"What the hell is in this card? You must have half of the Library in here!\" \"And a librarian to boot,\" Juanita says, \"to help you sort through it. And lots of MPEG of L. Bob Rife -- which accounts for most of the bytes.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll try to have a look at it,\" he says dubiously. \"Do. Unlike Da5id, you\u0027re just smart enough to benefit from this. And in the meantime, stay away from Raven. And stay away from Snow Crash. Okay?\" \"Who\u0027s Raven?\" he asks. But Juanita is already on her way out the door. The fancy avatars all turn around to watch her as she goes past them; the movie stars give her drop-dead looks, and the hackers purse their lips and stare reverently.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/675.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
