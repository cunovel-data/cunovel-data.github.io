{"id":20986,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"About the second or third thing they learned how to do when studying to become Kouriers was how to shiv open a pair of handcuffs. Handcuffs are not intended as long-term restraint devices, millions of Clink franchisees to the contrary. And the longtime status of skateboarders as an oppressed ethnic group means that by now all of them are escape artists of some degree. First things first. Y.T. has many a thing hanging off her uniform. The uniform has a hundred pockets, big flat pockets for deliveries and eensy narrow pockets for gear, pockets sewn into sleeves, thighs, shins. The equipment stuck into these multifarious pockets tends to be small, tricky, lightweight pens, markers, penlights, penknives, lock picks, bar-code scanners, flares, screwdrivers, Liquid Knuckles, bundy stunners, and lightsticks. A calculator is stuck upside-down to her right thigh, doubling as a taxi meter and a stopwatch. On the other thigh is a personal phone. As the manager is locking the door upstairs, it begins to ring. Y.T. offhooks it with her free hand. It is her mother. \"Hi, Mom. Fine, how are you? I\u0027m at Tracy\u0027s house. Yeah, we went to the Metaverse. We were just fooling around at this arcade on the Street. Pretty bumpin\u0027. Yes, I used a nice avatar. Nab, Tracy\u0027s mom said she\u0027d give me a ride home later. But we might stop off at the Joyride on Victory for a while, okay? Okay, well, sleep tight, Mom. I will. I love you, too. See you later.\" She punches the flash button, killing the chat with Mom and giving her a fresh dial tone in the space of about half a second. \"Roadkill,\" she says. The telephone remembers and dials Roadkill\u0027s number. Roaring sounds. This is the sound of air peeling over the microphone of Roadkill\u0027s personal phone at some terrifying velocity. Also the competing whooshes of many vehicles\u0027 tires on pavement, broken by chuckhole percussion; sounds like the crumbling Ventura. \"Yo, Y.T.,\" Roadkill says, \" \u0027sup?\" \"\u0027Sup with you?\" \"Surfing the Tura. \u0027Sup with you?\" \"Maxing The Clink.\" \"Whoa! Who popped you?\" \"MetaCops. Affixed me to the gate of White Columns with a loogie gun.\" \"Whoa, how very! When you leaving?\" \"Soon. Can you swing by and give me a hand?\" \"What do you mean?\" Men. \"You know, give me a hand. You\u0027re my boyfriend,\" she says, speaking very simply and plainly. \"If I get popped, you\u0027re supposed to come around and help bust me out.\" Isn\u0027t everyone supposed to know this stuff? Don\u0027t parents teach their kids anything anymore? \"Well, uh, where are you?\" \"Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly number 501,762.\" \"I\u0027m on my way to Bernie with a super-ultra.\" As in San Bernardino. As in super-ultra-high-priority delivery. As in, you\u0027re out of luck. \"Okay, thanks for nothing.\" \"Awwww,\" he begins. \"Surfing safety,\" Y.T. says, in the traditional sarcastic sign off. \"Keep breathing,\" Roadkill says. The roaring noise snaps off. What a jerk. Next date, he\u0027s really going to have to grovel. But in the meantime, there\u0027s one other person who owes her one. The only problem is that he might be a spaz. But it\u0027s worth a try. \"Hello?\" he says into his personal phone. He\u0027s breathing hard and a couple of sirens are dueling in the background. \"Hiro Protagonist?\" \"Yeah, who\u0027s this?\" \"Y.T. Where are you?\" \"In the parking lot of a Safeway on Oahu,\" he says. And he\u0027s telling the truth; in the background she can hear the shopping carts performing their clashy, anal copulations. \"I\u0027m kind of busy now, Whitey -- but what can I do for you?\" \"It\u0027s Y.T., \" she says, \"and you can help bust me out of The Clink.\" She gives him the details. \"How long ago did he put you there?\" \"Ten minutes.\" \"Okay, the three-ring binder for Clink franchises states that the manager is supposed to check on the detainee half an hour after admission.\" \"How do you know this stuff?\" she says accusingly. \"Use your imagination. As soon as the manager pulls his halfhour check, wait for another five minutes, and then make your move. I\u0027ll try to give you a hand. Okay?\" \"Got it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/677.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
