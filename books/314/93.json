He doesn\u0027t say it like he\u0027s pissed. He just wants her to be quiet. Because what she did doesn\u0027t make any difference now that all those wireheads have piled on top of Hiro.\n Y.T. looks out the window. They are buzzing across the Pacific, keeping pretty low down so that the water skims quickly beneath them. She doesn\u0027t know how fast they\u0027re going, but it looks to be pretty damn fast. She always thought the ocean was supposed to be blue, but in fact it\u0027s the most boring gray color she\u0027s ever seen. And there\u0027s miles and miles of it.\n After a few minutes, another chopper catches up with them and begins flying alongside, pretty close, in formation. It\u0027s the RARE chopper, the one full of medics.\n Through its cabin window, she can see Raven sitting in one of the seats. At first she thinks he\u0027s still unconscious because he\u0027s kind of hunched over, not moving.\n Then he lifts his head and she sees that he\u0027s goggled in to the Metaverse. He reaches up with one hand and pulls the goggles up onto his forehead for a moment, squints out the window, and sees her watching him. Their eyes meet and her heart starts flopping around weakly, like a bunny in a Ziploc bag. He grins and waves.\n Y.T. sits back in her seat and pulls the shade down over the window.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/758.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
