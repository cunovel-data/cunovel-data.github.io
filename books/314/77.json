{"id":21051,"no":77,"title":"Chapter 77","content":"Once it starts coming clear to her, again, that these people are all twisted freaks, she starts to notice other things about them. For example, the whole time, no one ever looks her in the eye. Especially the men. No sex at all in these guys, they\u0027ve got it pushed so far down inside of them. She can understand why they don\u0027t look at the fat babushkas. But she\u0027s a fifteen-year-old American chick, and she is used to getting the occasional look. Not here.\n Until she looks up from her big vat of fish one day and finds that she is looking into some guy\u0027s chest. And when she follows his chest upward to his neck, and his neck all the way up to his face, she sees dark eyes staring right back at her, right over the top of the counter.\n He\u0027s got something written on his forehead: POOR IMPULSE CONTROL. Which is kind of scary. Sexy, too. It gives him a certain measure of romance that none of these other people have. She was expecting the Raft to be dark and dangerous, and instead it\u0027s just like working where her mother works. This guy is the first person she\u0027s seen around this place who really looks like he belongs on the Raft.\n And he\u0027s got the look down, too. Incredibly rank style. Although he has a long wispy mustache that doesn\u0027t do much for his face. Doesn\u0027t bring out his features well at all.\n \"Do you take the nasty stuff? One fish head or two?\" she says, dangling the ladle picturesquely. She always talks trash to people because none of them can understand what she\u0027s saying.\n \"I\u0027ll take whatever you\u0027re offering,\" the guy says. In English. Sort of a crisp accent.\n \"I\u0027m not offering anything,\" she says, \"but if you want to stand there and browse, that\u0027s cool.\"\n He stands there and browses for a while. Long enough that people farther back in line stand up on tiptoe to see what the problem is. But when they see that the problem is this particular individual, they get down off their toes real fast, hunch down, sort of blend in to the mass of fishy-smelling wool.\n \"What\u0027s for dessert today?\" the guy asks. \"Got anything sweet for me?\"\n \"We don\u0027t believe in dessert,\" Y.T. says. \"It\u0027s a fucking sin, remember?\"\n \"Depends on your cultural orientation.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? What culture are you oriented to?\"\n \"I am an Aleut.\"\n \"Oh. I\u0027ve never heard of that.\"\n \"That\u0027s because we\u0027ve been fucked over,\" the big scary Aleut says, \"worse than any other people in history.\"\n \"Sorry to hear that,\" Y.T. says. \"So, uh, do you want me to serve up some fish, or are you gonna stay hungry?\"\n The big Aleut stares at her for a while. Then he jerks his head sideways and says, \"Come on. Let\u0027s get the fuck out of here.\"\n \"What, and skip out on this cool job?\"\n He grins ridiculously. \"I can find you a better job.\"\n \"In this job, do I get to leave my clothes on?\"\n \"Come on. We\u0027re going now,\" he says, those eyes burning into her. She tries to ignore a sudden warm tense feeling down between her legs.\n She starts following him down the cafeteria line, heading for a gap where she can exit into the dining area. The head babushka bitch comes stomping out from in back, hollers at her in some incomprehensible language.\n Y.T. turns to look back. She feels a pair of big hands sliding up her sides, coming up into her armpits, and she pulls her arms to her sides, trying to stop it. But it\u0027s no good, the hands come all the way up and keep lifting, keep rising into the air, bringing her with them. The big guy hoists her right up over the counter like she\u0027s a three-year-old and sets her down next to him. Y.T. turns back around to see the head babushka bitch, but she is frozen in a mixture of surprise, fear, and sexual outrage. But in the end, fear wins out, she averts her eyes, turns away, and goes to replace Y.T. at vat position number nine.\n \"Thanks for the lift,\" Y.T. says, her voice wowing and fluttering ridiculously.\n \"Uh, didn\u0027t you want to eat something?\"\n \"I was thinking of going out anyway,\" he says.\n \"Going out? Where do you go out on the Raft?\"\n \"Come on, I\u0027ll show you.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/742.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
