{"id":21013,"no":39,"title":"Chapter 39","content":"A couple of minutes later, she\u0027s pooning her way up 1-5, headed up into Valley-land. She\u0027s a little freaked-out, her timing is off, she\u0027s taking it easy. A tune keeps running through her head: \"The Happy Wanderer.\" It\u0027s driving her crazy.\n A large black blur keeps pulling alongside her. It would be a tempting target, so large and ferrous, if it were going a little faster. But she can make better time than this barge, even when she\u0027s taking it slow.\n The driver\u0027s side window of the black car rolls down. It\u0027s the guy. Jason. He\u0027s sticking his whole head out the window to look back at her, driving blind. The wind at fifty miles per hour does not ruffle his firmly gelled razor cut.\n He smiles. He has an imploring look about him, the same look that Roadkill gets. He points suggestively at his rear quarter-panel.\n What the hell. The last time she pooned this guy, he took her exactly where she was going. Y.T. detaches from the Acura she\u0027s been hitched to for the last half mile, swings it over to Jason\u0027s fat Olds. And Jason takes her off the freeway and onto Victory Boulevard, headed for Van Nuys, which is exactly right.\n But after a couple of miles, he swings the wheel sharply right and screeches into the parking lot of a ghost mall, which is wrong. Right now, nothing\u0027s parked in the lot but an eighteen-wheeler, motor running, SALDUCCI BROS. MOVING \u0026 STORAGE painted on the sides.\n \"Come on,\" Jason says, getting out of his Oldsmobile. \"You don\u0027t want to waste any time.\"\n \"Screw you, asshole,\" she says, reeling in her poon, looking back toward the boulevard for some promising westbound traffic. Whatever this guy has in mind, it is probably unprofessional.\n \"Young lady,\" says another voice, an older and more arresting sort of voice, \"it\u0027s fine if you don\u0027t like Jason. But your pal, Uncle Enzo, needs your help.\"\n A door on the back of the semi has opened up. A man in a black suit is standing there. Behind him, the interior of the semi is brightly lit up. Halogen light glares off the man\u0027s slick hairdo.\n Even with the backlighting, she can tell it is the man with the glass eye.\n \"What do you want?\" she says.\n \"What I want,\" he says, looking her up and down, \"and what I need are different things. Right now I\u0027m working, see, which means that what I want is not important. What I need is for you to get into this truck along with your skateboard and that suitcase.\"\n Then he adds, \"Am I getting through to you?\" He asks the question almost rhetorically, like he presumes the answer is no.\n \"He\u0027s for real,\" Jason says, as though Y.T. must be hanging on his opinion.\n \"Well, there you have it,\" the man with the glass eye says. Y.T. is supposed to be on her way to a Reverend Wayne\u0027s Pearly Gates franchise. If she screws up this delivery, that means she\u0027s double-crossing God, who may or may not exist, and in any case who is capable of forgiveness. The Mafia definitely exists and hews to a higher standard of obedience.\n She hands her stuff -- the plank and the aluminum case -- up to the man with the glass eye, then vaults up into the back of the semi, ignoring his proffered hand. He recoils, holds up his hand, looks at it to see if there\u0027s something wrong with it. By the time her feet leave the ground, the truck is already moving. By the time the door is pulled shut behind her, they have already pulled onto the boulevard.\n \"Just gotta run a few tests on this delivery of yours,\" the man with the glass eye says.\n \"Ever think of introducing yourself?\" Y.T. says.\n \"Nah,\" he says, \"people always forget names. You can just think of me as that one guy, y\u0027know?\"\n Y.T. is not really listening. She is checking out the inside of the truck. The trailer of this rig consists of a single long skinny room. Y.T. has just come in through its only entrance. At this end of the room, a couple of Mafia guys are lounging around, the way they always do.\n Most of the room is taken up by electronics. Big electronics.\n \"Going to just do some computer stuff, y\u0027know,\" he says, handing the briefcase over to a computer guy. Y.T. knows he\u0027s a computer guy because he has long hair in a ponytail and he\u0027s wearing jeans and he seems gentle.\n \"Hey, if anything happens to that, my ass is grass,\" Y.T. says. She\u0027s trying to sound tough and brave, but it\u0027s a hollow act in these circumstances.\n The man with the glass eye is, like, shocked. \"What do you think I am, some kind of incredibly stupid dickhead?\" he says. \"Shit, that\u0027s just what I need, trying to explain to Uncle Enzo how I managed to get his little bunny rabbit shot in the kneecaps.\"\n \"It\u0027s a noninvasive procedure,\" the computer guy says in a placid, liquid voice. The computer guy rotates the case around in his hand a few times, just to get a feel for it. Then he slides it into a large open-ended cylinder that is resting on the top of a table. The walls of the cylinder are a couple of inches thick. Frost appears to be growing on this thing. Mystery gases continuously slide off of it, like teaspoons of milk dropped into turbulent water. The gases plunge out across the table and drop to the floor, where they make a little carpet of fog that flows and blooms around their shoes. When the computer guy has it in place, he yanks his hand back from the cold.\n Then he puts on a pair of computer goggles.\n That\u0027s all there is to it. He just sits there for a few minutes. Y.T. is not a computer person, but she knows that somewhere behind the cabinets and doors in the back of this truck there is a big computer doing a lot of things right now.\n \"It\u0027s like a CAT scanner,\" the man with the glass eye says, using the same hushed tone of voice as a sportscaster in a golfing tournament. \"But it reads everything, you know,\" he says, rotating his hands impatiently in all-encompassing circles.\n \"How much does it cost?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"What\u0027s it called?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t really have a name yet.\"\n \"Well, who makes it?\"\n \"We made the goddamn thing,\" the man with the glass eye says. \"Just, like in the last couple weeks.\"\n \"What for?\"\n \"You\u0027re asking too many questions. Look. You\u0027re a cute kid. I mean, you\u0027re a hell of a chick. You\u0027re a knockout. But don\u0027t go thinking you\u0027re too important at this stage.\"\n At this stage. Hmm.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/704.html","bookId":314,"book":{"id":314,"title":"雪崩 Snow Crash","description":"简介： Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson\u0027s third novel, published in 1992.
