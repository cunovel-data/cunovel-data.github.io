{"id":1586,"title":"Silent Blade (Kinsmen #1)","description":"Storyline: Silent Blade (Kinsmen #1) \\n Old hatreds die hard. Old love dies harder. \\n On Meli Galdes\u0027 home planet, the struggle for power is a bloody, full-contact sport--in business and on the battlefield. For years her lethal skills have been a valuable asset in advancing her family\u0027s interests. She\u0027s more than earned her right to retire, but her kinsmen have one last favor to ask. \\n Kill the man who ruined her life. \\n Celino Carvanna\u0027s razor-sharp business acumen--and skills with a blade--won him the freedom to do as he pleases. There\u0027s only one thing he can\u0027t seem to control--his reaction to the mysterious woman who tantalizes his senses. Her eyes alone set his blood simmering, stirring ridiculous adolescent fantasies about breasts and honey. With a few words she dissects his soul. Who is she? And how does she slide so easily under his well-guarded skin? \\n It\u0027s almost too easy to draw Celino within the kill zone. Meli plans to revel in him. Drink him in. Wring every drop of pleasure out of every moment. \\n And when she\u0027s sure he belongs to her, she will finally repay a decade\u0027s worth of pain--in a single, brutal dose of reality.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/silent-blade-kinsmen-1.jpg","author":"Ilona Andrews","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
