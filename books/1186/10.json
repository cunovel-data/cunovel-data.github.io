{"id":13036,"no":10,"title":"IN RELATION TO MYSTERIES","content":"The relation of the three unusual incidents following these introductory words are only simple statements of facts for each reader to solve in his own way. Concerning them I have no theory whatever, and avow emphatically an entire disbelief in their sometimes alleged supernatural origin. That, for the present at least, they are inexplicable must be admitted, but that they will always remain within the realm of mysteries beyond the power of solution is very doubtful. Up to the present time many accepted, 188 or rather seeming, mysteries, which, with the assistance of ages, have crystallized into form, have been permitted to pass unchallenged, but the time has arrived when the old fields, now almost sacred groves, where superstition has taken root and blossomed, are about to be explored. The almost omnipotent search-light of science is turning its rays into the dark nooks and corners of complacent ignorance, greatly to the discomfiture of many old theories and beliefs, whose foundations are as unsubstantial as dreams. Until the possibly far-off culmination of the great scientific epoch, new mysteries known only to the laboratories of Nature will continue to be born. But those who have watched the progress of scientific achievement, through the last half of the Nineteenth Century, must believe that, within the 189 next like period, the visible manifestations of secrets coming from the bosom of Nature (of which the outer shell now only is seen) will have been ascertained to belong to a previously undiscovered series of natural phenomena. We know as a certain fact of the existence of a natural element of power called electricity, but what is it, and whence does it come? To the ignorant it performs miracles in an apparently supernatural way, while to the intelligent it is regarded as a subtle natural force coming from the universal laboratory of boundless nature and as unending as time itself. In electricity, as in many other manifestations of the forces of nature, we see only results, and know little or nothing of the first cause. The time, however, let us hope, is not far off when origins will be as easily demonstrable as is now the seeing of effects we cannot understand. 190 Present indications point to the early solution of all superstitions, many of which for centuries have construed some of the simplest happenings, which could not upon any known principles be explained, into demonstrations flowing from supernatural sources. Superstition must certainly fall before the great and impartial sweep of modern research. In at least one direction, the battle will be of long duration, but at the end of the conflict, the vicious old fabric coined out of ages of falsehood as old as our civilization, sustained by centuries of superstitious ignorance and countless unspeakable cruelties and crimes, will totter from its foundation in the limitless sphere of human credulity, and fall, let us hope, to its final decay. The destruction of that inveterate enemy of intellectual progress and the human race, will be the culminating 191 triumph of scientific achievement and the crowning glory of human effort in the interest of a more exalted conception of the Deity, better morals, and a higher plane of civilization. From my birth to and including a part of the year 1846, I lived with my grandparents in the town of Pomfret, Vermont. The inhabitants of that old rural community during my time were, I believe without exception, descendants from the early English colonists of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. They were an orderly, law-abiding, industrious, and honest people, intensely patriotic, believing in the fruits of the Revolution, in many of the battles of which they and their immediate ancestors had taken part. Up to the period of my early days they were still engaged in the continuous difficult task of creating homes for their families and in building a new 192 state, and had but little time to bestow upon books or mental culture of any sort. Their lives were laborious and beset with many hardships. Indeed, it may be truly said of them that, from an academic or bookish standpoint, they were educated and enlightened only to a limited extent. Each household had its cupboard of books brought from “below,” and they retained in their memories an interesting stock of historic traditions and patriotic anecdotes, many of which were connected with the early history of a majority of the families of this community. The frequent recital of these served to keep alive the patriotic spirit, and to impress upon the minds of the rising generation the importance and value of the heroic services performed by their ancestors. As a rule, this little New England town unit, composed of strong, hardy 193 unlettered men and women, was exceptionally free from natural stupidity and the usual répertoire of rural superstitions, but they had a few which were dear to many of the good old New England housewives of my particular period. Among them was a belief in the misfortunes likely to attend new undertakings begun on Friday; they had a perfect reliance in the ill ending of any enterprise connected with the number thirteen; and it was rank heresy for any one not to believe in the ill-omened, grief-stricken howls of the family dog. That this latter belief was not without a certain reasonable shadow of foundation, I am about to show in the relation of a series of remarkable incidents, which are of a sort that up to this time have not been explained.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1673/49311.html","bookId":1186,"book":{"id":1186,"title":"Better Than Men","description":"简介： The title chosen for the following sketches, written for the purpose of presenting certain prominent characteristics of the lower animals worthy of the attention of the human animal, stands for rather a serious proposition which may be questioned by...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1673","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:34 AM"}}
