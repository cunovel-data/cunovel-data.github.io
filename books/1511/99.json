If not, then are they trying to use me to provoke someone?\" But unfortunately for Guillotine, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t trust his words at all. He spoke, once he got off the golem train and stepped into a new area. \"Shin Woo, can\u0027t you try trusting in people some more?\" \"It\u0027s not between people; it\u0027s between a skeleton and a golem. The genre\u0027s completely different, so what\u0027s the point?\" \"...\" Even as Lee Shin Woo spoke, he activated the administrative seal naturally, like flowing water, and came into ownership of the abandoned golems on standby in the production facility. He\u0027d already become quite familiar with the process, as he\u0027d done this several times already. [In honor of Steelworker.] [I will protect you with my life.] \"Yeah, yeah. Oh, it\u0027s a level 5 one!\" [I am an Iron Golem. I will protect you, Steelworker.] [I will protect you as well.] \"It\u0027s not just one!\" As he\u0027d roamed the Empire, Lee Shin Woo had a rough idea as to the value of golems. Firstly, level 3 Stone Golems were pretty much worthless to him, while the level 4 Bronze Golems were normally quite strong. However, they were pretty pointless once he surpassed the level 2 danger zones. However, it\u0027s different when referring to the Iron Golems, which were level 5 elites. They\u0027re definitely the \u0027bully\u0027 of the level 2 danger zones! They would probably be useful, even in the level 3 danger zones with their level of durability and power. \"But I haven\u0027t found any golems that are a level higher than them...\" \"They\u0027re probably in those rooms that they didn\u0027t let us in, right?\" \"There might be some of those golems in the level 3 danger zones already.\" \"Yeah, there\u0027s a high chance of that.\" The two chattered on whilst Lee Shin Woo lead the golems outside. There were five golems standing by in the underground facilities, with another five outside as well; so in total, there were 10 Iron Golems by their side. [Waiting for your orders, Steelworker.] [It\u0027s an honor to be guarding you, Steelworker.] [Command us.] \"They\u0027re quite loyal...\" \"Mm, so Arema Steelworker doesn\u0027t really care about the level 5 Iron Golems, huh...\" \"Huh? That\u0027s what this means?\" \"Look. There are Iron Golems right outside the train underground even without us going above ground, so they didn\u0027t bother picking them up. That means that these Iron Golems hold no value to Arema Steelworker.\" The fact that Arema Steelworker sent them on their way on the train, despite knowing that there were Iron Golems there meant that he considered these Iron Golems trash \u0027yet to be disposed of\u0027. However, Arema treasured the level 6 golems. Lee Shin Woo and Jin were able to roughly estimate the level of the golems in the areas where they weren\u0027t permitted to enter. He didn\u0027t care about the level 5 golems, but he did care about the level 6 ones. There was one thing that suggested as such. \"He has no way of creating cores. If he were able to create cores, he would\u0027ve collected the level 5 golems, and even the level 4s and taken them apart. And would\u0027ve created more level 6s, but the fact that he didn\u0027t means that...\" \"Ah, you\u0027re probably right.\" The Iron Golems\u0027 cores were high-class, and were very similar to the Original Core. Honestly, Lee Shin Woo was confident that he would be able to make an Original Bone Core with just four or five of them. However, Arema Steelworker was leaving those Iron Golems alone. \"...I wonder what Arema Steelworker is thinking about? What does he intend to do? Why did he send us here?\" \"I wonder. ...I suppose that\u0027s for us to find out.\" If there were one thing he was sure about, it would be that Arema Steelworker made a huge mistake; he hadn\u0027t taken into account Lee Shin Woo\u0027s latent potential and had thoughtlessly revealed his secrets. It didn\u0027t take long for Lee Shin Woo to come to that conclusion. \"You guys go back. If we keep going like this, we should be able to reach the level 2 danger zone without any danger.\" [As you command, Steelworker.] [I will follow your command, by working together with my comrades.] Though he\u0027d just gotten command over the group of golems, Lee Shin Woo sent the golems away in the next moment. To be exact, he\u0027d sent them to the designated gathering place for his troops in the level 2 danger zone. \"Go to the meeting place as soon as possible, but if you think there\u0027s any danger to your cores, run away and take a detour immediately. If you can\u0027t escape, collect your comrades\u0027 cores and keep them with you. Remember that.\" [I understand!] [Thank you for taking us into consideration, Steelworker.] Once they grouped up with the other golems, their mission would be to roam around the Empire, collecting information and hunting monsters. If they don\u0027t overdo it, such that they don\u0027t incur casualties and cut down the number of undead, they would help in gradually, very gradually purifying the Empire. If they worked together, they would at worst be as effective as 1 hero. \"Unlike the Pauls, the Golems can\u0027t grow.\" \"But the bones that they collect can be used to reinforce the Pauls, right? Moreover, there\u0027s something else I\u0027m thinking about, too.\" Lee Shin Woo sent the golems, which departed for their long journey, off with a delighted smile. Lee Shin Woo had frantically picked up the Iron Golems while Arema Steelworker had thrown them away and considered them useless. From the outside, it clearly seemed like a completely one-sided superior and subordinate relationship, but it was strange, as it felt like if it were Lee Shin Woo, it might be different. \"Then, shall we get going, secretly?\" \"How? You don\u0027t have Shadow Sprint anymore.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s right.\" At the beginning, Lee Shin Woo thought he\u0027d be able to change skills as he wanted like how he could so naturally change mana as he wished, but he couldn\u0027t. If it were that easy, they wouldn\u0027t be skills. If it had a particular element to it, then he might\u0027ve been able to recreate it, but the \u0027Shadow\u0027 element didn\u0027t exist in this world. \"Whenever I try, I just keep making Shadow Horns. Damn it...\" \"It can\u0027t be helped. If we need to, we can just run away. Let\u0027s go.\" \"Sseup...\" Like with all of the golem production facilities, their destination was in the highlands, northwest a ways away from the center of the Empire. When they looked down, they saw the satellite city that Guillotine had told them about, Kadinan. He inwardly thought that this city might\u0027ve been cleared out by the other heroes, but considering the abundance of mana he felt, it meant that the undead were still stationed inside the city. \"Is the lord about level 6? Level 6...\" \"Don\u0027t smack your lips. Yeah we\u0027re going to charge in, but now\u0027s not the time, right?\" \"You\u0027re right. First, we...\" He didn\u0027t know if it was done on purpose, but the golem testing facility was quite a ways off from the production facility. Kadinan was at the center, and the testing facility was at a place that they could only reach by departing from the highlands and going all the way around. Kadinan was like a basin, and the testing facility and the highlands all felt like a part of the enclosing mountain range. \"It\u0027s really strange. How did they make this kind of natural environment underground...\" \"You know, if the Emperor\u0027s this good at magic, to the point that he\u0027s able to do something like this, then isn\u0027t it pretty much guaranteed we\u0027d lose?\" \"...It\u0027s not the result of some transient magic. Let\u0027s go with the idea that he\u0027s stockpiled power over many years.\" They chattered on like usual, but as they travelled, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s expression stiffened unexpectedly. \"They\u0027ve way too many patrols.\" \"We\u0027ve already gone past a lot of patrols thus far. What\u0027s wrong with you all of a sudden?\" \"No, I\u0027m saying... that there\u0027re way too many people patrolling around our destination.\" \"...\" He\u0027d thought it unusual, but it seemed like they already took notice of them. Lee Shin Woo was dumbfounded. Did Guillotine look down on him? If not, then was he not truly aware of what was going on around here? Either way, it didn\u0027t matter. Lee Shin Woo was starting to become curious as to what lay at his destination. [Hey you, stay there.] It wasn\u0027t very long before Lee Shin Woo was discovered by one of the patrolling Skeleton Knights. Since he didn\u0027t even have Shadow Sprint, it was impossible for him to move without being discovered. However, both Lee Shin Woo and Jin looked relaxed. [Woah!? W-What a nice horse!] \"My thanks for the compliment. Are you a knight under the lord\u0027s command?\" Nine times out of ten, someone who doesn\u0027t recognize him would say something like this. [T-That\u0027s correct. If it\u0027s not too much trouble, may I ask where you came from...?] Even after dying, knights and aristocrats were idiots and still respected ranks of power! Regardless of how suspicious he might\u0027ve looked, he wouldn\u0027t be able to treat him so thoughtlessly! Moreover, Lee Shin Woo was currently garbed in luxurious armor (he purposely kept his helmet open so that others could see that he was undead) and spoke gallantly (for someone who can\u0027t even breathe, Jin acted as if he could and drew out his breaths). The knight couldn\u0027t help but wonder about his identity! \"I am one of Marquis Satepen\u0027s men.\" [One of Marquis Satepen\u0027s men!?] Marquis Satepen was the lord with the highest standing amongst the lords that controlled the level 2 danger zone cities! He had retired to the countryside after passing his land over to his son, and he was sure of the family\u0027s power and position; Lee Shin Woo had cleaved his skull and absorbed his bone, so he was able to nigh-perfectly imitate him, but he was purposefully posing as his knight instead! \"You know of these unruly and strange individuals moving around throughout the Empire, yes? The Marquis was quite worried about this, so he sent me and some other knights throughout the Empire. Thus, it is my duty to capture and torture these flies, and report back to the Marquis.\" [As expected... As expected of Marquis Satepen! A noble loyal to the Empire, even after passing his position to his son!] \"Thus... What are you all doing within? I have already discovered quite a few knights patrolling around.\" [T-That\u0027s...] The Skeleton Knight was flustered and stepped back. He had already accepted that Lee Shin Woo was Satepen\u0027s vassal! But if he was too forceful, the knight may become angry with him, so Lee Shin Woo purposefully made his voice less forceful. \"As a mere knight, I have no plans of interfering with the lord\u0027s work. We are all loyal to the Empire, are we not? I just asked out of concern, so there is no need to be alarmed.\" [Ha, haha. Thank you for your consideration. Ah, what is your name...?] \"You can call me Seta.\" [Sir Seta, it wasn\u0027t something that I couldn\u0027t tell you, as you\u0027re under orders from Marquis Satepen. To be honest, the lord received an imperial command.] \"Hoh.\" He even told him about the imperial command; seriously, dumbasses like this are the best! [This is what the Emperor commanded. Rebels will definitely appear here, so if anyone suspicious comes, then we should report immediately. Then, one of the 12 generals will come and personally execute the rebels...!] \"Is that so?\" Lee Shin Woo completely understood now. For some reason, the Emperor was sure that Arema Steelworker would appear here, and Arema Steelworker was also aware of the Emperor\u0027s motives. \u0027If I thoughtlessly entered, then around the time I exited the dungeon, one of the 12 generals would be there to meet me.\u0027 Was Arema\u0027s plan to get rid of him? No, if it was, he would\u0027ve just told Guillotine to kill him. In other words... it was a test. It was a test for Lee Shin Woo, as well as his group (Arema trusted that a group backing him existed), so Arema could gauge their abilities. \u0027There could be something else as well, but this is probably it for now.\u0027 He could just figure out the rest starting now. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and spoke. \"So you were following the imperial command. If it is not too much trouble, may I help as well? I will go and talk to the lord personally.\" [Ooooh, it would be a great help [1] to us if you were to assist us, Sir Seta! I will personally guide you to the lord!] The deeply touched knight yelled! Jin, who had heard it all, inwardly cried out. \u0027What the hell are you doing!?\u0027 \u0027I mean, if we just barge in, one of the 12 generals will show up soon. Even so, we can\u0027t just go back. I\u0027m too curious as to what’s going on in there.\u0027 \u0027So!?\u0027 \u0027So henceforth, we\u0027re beginning operation [Operation: Bro [2], why are you there?\u0027]!\u0027 \u0027...You.\u0027 There were so many parts about that statement he wanted to retort about, but Jin decided to concentrate on only the one he was truly confident about. The two \u0027operation\u0027 words were overlapping! [3] [1] T/N: In Korean, he says something along the lines of saying that he\u0027s similar to a force of a thousand. It\u0027s just a saying that emphasizes how helpful he would be. [2] T/N: Hyung, or big brother. As it\u0027s comical, \u0027bro\u0027 is the more contextually correct English translation. [3] T/N: The first operation uses the Korean word, while the second uses the English pronunciation spelled out in Korean.
