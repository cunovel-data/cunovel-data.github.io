Well, I\u0027m not exactly giving it to you, but lending it to you.\"\n It was a level 9 artifact, so just giving it to her wouldn\u0027t have a good effect on her karma.\n He could barely even lend it to her, as the item\u0027s level was much too high, but... by using his Dark Shadow and Wild Card skills, he was able to make up for her deficiencies.\n \"What?! Mr. Shin Woo, this is the best item I\u0027ve ever seen! How could you hand it out so casually?!\" \n \"I pretty much have no way of using it right now, so I decided to give it to Jin Jin, who can use it effectively.\"\n Pleine, who was watching from the side, widened her eyes and tried to stop him, but Lee Shin Woo just shrugged.\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo was well aware of how amazing the Phoenix\u0027s Feather was... It didn\u0027t matter that it was more geared towards women. If he were to absorb it, he could adjust it to a form that suited him.\n \u0027But that\u0027s the problem. I can\u0027t.\u0027\n With a little more study, his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, or Bone Armory skills may evolve to even greater heights. However, that wasn\u0027t happening anytime soon. These skills wouldn\u0027t be able to alter an artifact that the level 9 divine bird, the Garuda, dropped.\n \"Still... Do I even have the right to accept this? I-I\u0027m scared. If something happens to me and I can\u0027t return it, then... Especially this special active skill! You can only use it once, but if I were to waste it...!\"\n \"That ability\u0027s why I\u0027m giving you this item. Think about it. The Sun God\u0027s Blessing is ultimately the Garuda\u0027s blessing. But I killed the Garuda, so will that blessing actually benefit me? I don\u0027t think so.\"\n This was the truth. Though the Garuda had rotted away (literally), it was still a level 9 divine bird. Even till the bitter end, it was suspicious and wary of Lee Shin Woo, so there was a chance those feelings were stored within this artifact. It wouldn\u0027t be much of an issue with Lee Shin Woo\u0027s abilities, but it was still kind of awkward for him.\n \"The best case scenario is if nothing happens to you, but... it\u0027d be a weight off my shoulders if you were to use this skill to survive if you find yourself in danger. So, don\u0027t feel so burdened and just wear it.\"\n \"However...\"\n As expected, Ye Jin Jin still felt burdened from his request, even though he\u0027d gone so far to assure her. Well, it made sense. To Lee Shin Woo, a revival ability wasn\u0027t really a big deal, but to Ye Jin Jin, it must be. The artifact\u0027s other abilities were quite considerable as well.\n He supposed it couldn\u0027t be helped. Lee Shin Woo decided to give her some \u0027extra service\u0027. He beckoned her with his finger and Ye Jin Jin came over to him, albeit confused. Then, he whispered a few words into her ear. It was super effective!\n \"Huah... I-I understand!\"\n \"Good girl.\"\n Shortly after, she distanced herself from him. However, her face was flushed beet red as she quietly nodded her head. She had barely accepted the Phoenix\u0027s Feather. Her reaction caused him to smile in satisfaction, and those who had watched their interaction narrowed their eyes. Of course, he didn\u0027t let that bother him at all.\n \"But there\u0027s no way that you can just wear this cheat item. It\u0027s impossible, so long as you don\u0027t possess the level 6 high rank fire element like me. I can temporarily trick the item by using my Wild Card skill, but it won\u0027t last so it won\u0027t work with me alone.\"\n [...Is that where I come in?]\n \"Hoh. You got so smart from just one level up, our little Zenon.\"\n He hadn\u0027t even called him, but Zenon came forward. Once he\u0027d become a level 8 Shining Salamander, he retained his appearance as a fire lizard. However, his body was a lot smaller than before, as he had shed his skin. He had much smoother curves than before and gave off a sense of elegance. As he thought, the higher level the spirit, the more attractive they became.\n [I can control that artifact. That girl... Ye Jin Jin, right? I can help her use the artifact. Moreover, if I were to help her, Ye Jin Jin will be able to unleash even greater flames, and she won\u0027t have any problems being your representative.]\n \"90 points. You\u0027re just a little bit off.\"\n [I\u0027ll stay by her side and protect her. At the same time, I\u0027ll relay information on the surface to you. And... you\u0027re hoping that I grow with her, right?]\n \"Bingo. 100 points. You\u0027ve just obtained the light element, so you need time to try out your new abilities and grow. If you stay by her side, then you can go wild without people suspecting a thing.\"\n As expected, forming a contract with a spirit would cause the spirit to adopt some of the contractor\u0027s qualities. Zenon had said exactly what Lee Shin Woo had wanted and went inside of the Phoenix\u0027s Feather. The Phoenix\u0027s Feather, which had unrestrainedly expelled flames everywhere, calmed down and looked like a normal red dress now.\n He passed the dress over to Ye Jin Jin without hesitation. Ye Jin Jin accepted it with much difficulty and felt the dress over. Then, she carefully voiced her appreciation.\n \"When I look at it up close, it looks quite splendid. It might be difficult to talk to someone wearing this everyday!\"\n \"Who cares? It\u0027s better for a hero to stand out anyway. You\u0027re pretty and have a nice body, so it’ll look nice on you. Don\u0027t worry.\"\n \"Hehehe...\"\n He added in some compliments here and there, making her feel happy. \u0027If she met a silver-tongued bastard, then she\u0027d be completely fooled by him...\u0027 he thought. But when he thought about it again, Lee Shin Woo realized he was that silver-tongued bastard.\n \"Ye Jin Jin, Zenon, and Bisher Moon (who\u0027s still in the Empire working); you guys will be responsible for the surface. Rem will support you too. I made sure to check, but the Emperor doesn\u0027t know that I\u0027ve taken control of the golem network. We should be able to acquire information regarding the movements of his forces, the 12 Generals, and his plans. Mostly everything, aside from the Emperor himself.\"\n \"Understood!\"\n [I trust that you haven\u0027t changed your mind. I\u0027ll definitely make a world where all spirits can live in peace.]\n What a trustworthy response. Although Ye Jin Jin currently needed the Phoenix\u0027s Feather and Zenon to do much of anything right now, if she were to be \u0027Lawrence and \u0027Kay\u0027s representative\u0027, then... the amount of karma and Perium she gained would skyrocket.\n Thus, she\u0027d quickly become level 7. She might even reach level 8 before the underground heroes. That’s how far his influence reached!\n \"Mm. I\u0027ll lend you one more thing.\"\n No matter how offensively capable the Phoenix\u0027s Feather was, it was still a defensive item, so Lee Shin Woo decided to let her borrow a weapon too. It was a javelin created by transforming the level 7 Fire Dragon\u0027s Scale Greatsword!\n In exchange for its special options, it gained the ability to amplify the fire element when thrown.\n \"This is an amazing item!? Can I really have it?\"\n \"Yeah. You can have this one. If it breaks, I can fix it from afar.\"\n Although he had to use one of his 10 Bone Armory slots for it, both his Rule of Bone and Bone Armory skills had grown significantly; even if she were on the surface and he were underground, he could still maintain the weapon for her and even reinforce it.\n \"Wow. Wow...!\"\n [Mm. I should be able to reinforce and withdraw the weapon with my control if it\u0027s a weapon with such powerful flames.]\n It wasn\u0027t much for Lee Shin Woo, but to Ye Jin Jin, it was an \u0027unbreakable\u0027 divine spear. And thus, he had successfully created a hero on the spot. The Emperor must be astonished right now!\n He also wanted to transfer the Evileye General\u0027s Evileye to her, but he couldn\u0027t as of yet. If his Bone Reinforcement advanced a little bit more, and if he studied how to interfere with bone and other matter a bit more, then he should be able to do it, but he couldn\u0027t yet.\n \"And Sinea.\"\n [Y-Yeah? Do I have to stay on the surface too?]\n \"Stay in the Spirits\u0027 Spring for me. We need someone to lead the spirits in the Spirits\u0027 Spring in Zenon\u0027s stead. Since we\u0027ve formed an official contract, you can always call for me, no matter where I am, so don\u0027t feel so lonely...\"\n [Euuu.]\n Sinea had stuck to Lee Shin Woo all the time lately as if she thought that being by his side was only natural. Was that why her eyes were brimming with tears?\n But the Elder Dryad Princess knew full well that she shouldn\u0027t be stubborn. In the end, she nodded her head and said.\n [Make sure you dote on me later.]\n \"You got it.\"\n \"...Dote on her, huh.\"\n \"How do you think he\u0027ll dote on her?\"\n He ignored the other\u0027s reactions again and Lee Shin Woo ordered to go their separate ways. Ye Jin Jin nodded her head and bought medicine with all the money she\u0027d accumulated thus far. She took all of it at once, wore the Phoenix\u0027s Feather, with Zenon inside, placed the Javelin Lee Shin Woo had created for her on her back and then left.\n \"...Then, shall we get going?\"\n \"In the end, it\u0027s just us two going back.\"\n Pleine, who was wondering what the rest would have to say, widened her eyes.\n \"Oh my. Are you really not going to shop for anything? Moreover, the two of you should have some plans moving forward. Are you not going to tell me what they are?\"\n \"I told you. Watch and enjoy.\"\n Lee Shin Woo winked at her and activated the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. Lee Shin Woo took out some of the accumulated bones from his inventory and used all the mana he\u0027d saved up to create a gate... Pleine watched on vacantly, but when they took one step into the gate she said to their backs...\n \"You don\u0027t need to feel sorry for me.\"\n \"Alright.\"\n \"Since I knew this would happen. I\u0027m actually quite happy that this day came much faster than I\u0027d expected.\"\n \"I appreciate it.\"\n Jin tilted his head from beside Lee Shin Woo. Did he not understand yet? It might be for the best if he didn\u0027t understand till the very end.\n \"So you don\u0027t need to avoid me out of guilt. Do you understand? I told you in advance.\"\n \"Yes, yes.\"\n \"Thank you. While you\u0027re at it... My stupid little sister might trouble you, but be kind to her for my sake.\"\n \"I\u0027ll think about it.\"\n Lee Shin Woo was a stern man. Pleine was pouting, saying that \u0027he wasn\u0027t a simple skeleton\u0027, but Lee Shin Woo, who was half-way through the gate, turned his head back and asked.\n \"Is my body really not your type?\"\n \"Oh my.\"\n Did he even say that ever since they first met? Pleine narrowed her eyes and replied.\n \"That was a lie. You see, I\u0027m not the type of girl that judges people based on their bodies. You\u0027re flirting with me, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"I\u0027d always wanted to tell you this.\"\n Lee Shin Woo smiled refreshingly and told her his true feelings.\n \"I really wasn\u0027t flirting with you. And your face is pretty, but you\u0027re really not my type. See you later!\"\n \"What...!\"\n Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d successfully carried out his revenge, waved his hand at the shaking Pleine and left the secret shop. For some reason, Jin, who wasn\u0027t even a part of their conversation, was laughing along side of him.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-233","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
