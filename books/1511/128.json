New Golem Maker - 9\u003e [Dark Elemental Bone] [A bone gem with all the unnecessary elements removed, and contains the essence of pure darkness mana. It is a never before seen treasure that can contain a much larger quantity of magic than its appearance might suggest.] \"Nice. A lot more was removed than I expected, but now I\u0027m done processing the raw materials.\" \"The cores are ready too.\" Lee Shin Woo and Kratia had spent a few days after returning to base processing the materials, and would finally be able to start producing golems. Looking back on it, it seemed like it had taken so long to get to this point, but it had actually taken less than a month. He hadn\u0027t been able to hunt much, but there had been so much to do, going from here to there, so it was obvious that it felt like it had been so long. \"Pauls, you did well. Form your groups and go out hunting again. Ah, and don\u0027t forget to report if you find a mine.\" [Whenever you call us, we will come.] Shino Rendu, who had become more dependable than when he was human, said his goodbyes and left with the Pauls. Almost 1,000 troops had left in an instant, so it looked like the base was completely empty, but there were still hundreds of golems left. \"You guys go too. You know what to do if you meet a Steelworker, right?\" [Only you are our master.] He said his farewells to the golems which had their minds tampered with by Rem. He left behind 10 golems in order to manage the winery and produce the wine. As they continue to do their job, they\u0027ll make big and small mistakes, and eventually become specialists in making wine. Ah, the Silver Golems were on standby for now. [Paul Zero, you\u0027re not done yet?] \"Now\u0027s the important part, so just keep watch.\" [Ooh, then I\u0027ll come by to play when you\u0027re finished!] The Dryads, who didn\u0027t know that Lee Shin Woo was leaving the winery as soon as he was finished, returned to the vineyard. Lee Shin Woo and Kratia then began to produce golems in earnest. They called it making golems, but they already had everything mapped out, so all they had to do was follow the plans in order and make the golems. Normally, just inserting the raw materials and the core in separate facilities was enough to manufacture a golem, but he needed to try doing it once manually. \"Ah, there\u0027s a partial flaw. Kratia, wait a sec.\" \"Guu, as I thought, it was a problem with the knee joint... I\u0027ll fix it right away. Wait just a sec.\" \"No. Let\u0027s get rid of this and instead, use the magic in the raw materials to fuse it.\" During the manufacturing process the two engaged in a conversation that Jin couldn\u0027t understand once more. However, he decided that he wouldn\u0027t leave this time. Since he wanted to at least be there when Lee Shin Woo created his first golem. Fortunately, the errors in their plans weren\u0027t too big, so they could progress without much issue. There used to only be a core at the center of the worktable, but in no time, there was a body attached to it, and then limbs as well, which was quite the spectacle. \"Done. The legs are moving.\" \"But is the core\u0027s AI ok like this? You don\u0027t need to imprint anything else?\" \"We have the darkness mana. Look.\" Perhaps because the Dark Elemental Bone\u0027s very birth was affected by Lee Shin Woo, it naturally absorbed Lee Shin Woo\u0027s darkness magic. It looked as though the golem would be fully loyal to Lee Shin Woo before it was even finished... Kratia just sulked a little bit. \"But I\u0027m making it with you too.\" \"Then come back after you\u0027ve learned how to use darkness magic.\" \"Kuuuuu.\" From the very beginning, Kratia had been interested in manufacturing golems, not taking ownership of them. Honestly, in the process of studying the magic applied to golems, she had increased her knowledge of magic theory beyond her imagination, so she did achieve her objective, but... \"It feels weird. It\u0027s like the feeling a mother has when her baby, that was born through a joint effort between parents, only follows the father around, rather than the mother.\" \"Did you have a kid in your original world...?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t! I\u0027m talking about our kid, ours!\" \"!?\" The process went smoothly. It felt like it wouldn\u0027t go this smoothly when Arema Steelworker made golems. The speed at which the golem\u0027s magic, which had fused with the darkness magic, circulated incredibly fast, and the connection between the core and its body was quite solid. \"It\u0027d probably be hard to use the magic in a different way.\" \"It doesn\u0027t have that ability, and it wouldn\u0027t be efficient. Since these are weapons for combat.\" \"Then... I think it\u0027s done. Shin Woo, the assembly\u0027s done.\" They\u0027d only started building the golem less than an hour ago, yet there was a 4 meter tall humanoid golem laying atop the worktable. Though it was a similar height to the level 5 Iron Golem, its abilities were incomparable. At least in terms of design. \"Will it really move...?\" \"It\u0027ll definitely move. I\u0027m more worried about whether this thing is a level 6 or not.\" \"We used a level 6 core, so it should be. ...The raw materials and the process were perfect, so it could be an elite as well.\" He couldn\u0027t help but shake. Lee Shin Woo had only focused on a singular goal: creating a golem. However, if they actually succeeded in creating a golem, then their status would change in an instant. That\u0027s because he would be able to control hundreds of level 6 elite golems, entities that made even the other heroes nervous. Lee Shin Woo softly closed and opened his eyes. His heart was pounding, and he wanted to sigh, yet he couldn\u0027t as he didn\u0027t have any respiratory organs. Not having any means of breathing never hurt so much. \"Shin Woo. ...Try activating it.\" \"...Alright. I\u0027m doing it.\" In the end, he steeled himself and placed his hand atop the core. Of course, the core was protected by an especially durable material, but if Lee Shin Woo were to just let out his magic, it would reach the core immediately. That\u0027s how impressive the mana conductivity of the material was. \"Activate.\" He unconsciously spoke a word that was strictly unnecessary, and emitted darkness magic from his fingertips. A skeleton and a golem... normally, these two entities couldn\u0027t easily be linked, but the darkness magic made it almost too natural. [Activating...] His powerful will was transmitted along with his magic, and the core seemed to prioritize its absorption; the core, which emitted a gentle light, vibrated like a heart suddenly pounding, and emitted darkness magic everywhere, filling each and every part of the golem\u0027s body. [Checking to see if all parts can be activated...] There was an operating \u0027organ\u0027 located within its brain, and its arms could attack in a variety of ways with magic while its feet had boosters that could increase its speed through magic. Once that process was complete, a gentle green light radiated from the dark green, translucent golem. Despite being an inanimate object, it seemed to give off vigor that it didn\u0027t have before. [...Activating.] The golem spoke in a mechanical voice, and simultaneously, the golem\u0027s body bizarrely wriggled. This was the process of the core regulating all of the body\u0027s magic. And eventually, it slowly, very slowly stood up. [Recognizing situation...] The golem turned its head slowly and looked around. Because its upper body was 2 meters by itself, it had to look down to see Lee Shin Woo and Kratia. It was so overwhelming that Kratia instinctively grabbed her orb, and Lee Shin Woo kept Rem on standby. However, that was honestly quite pointless. The moment it had turned its head and seen Lee Shin Woo, it felt like the darkness magic he had released formed a deep link between them... and the golem spoke thusly. [Master has been recognized.] The moment Lee Shin Woo heard that, it felt as though the tension had left his body. Kratia staggered and even fell towards Lee Shin Woo, but fortunately, Jin caught her. \"...And who am I?\" Lee Shin Woo tried his very best to not act excited and asked. The golem\u0027s response came immediately. [You are my master. Master, please give me a name so you can differentiate me from the others.] Lee Shin Woo clenched his fists. Kratia just remained vacant and was just waiting for him. In a calm voice, Lee Shin Woo gave him a name. \"Rem Two... No, let\u0027s go with Erem.\" [Recognized.] Regardless of whether it was Rem Two or Erem, his naming sense didn\u0027t involve an \u0027s\u0027. However, Erem happily accepted its name. \u0027But was it normal to give golems a name?\u0027, he thought and tilted his head. Then, a message appeared before Lee Shin Woo. [You have created the elite Lv6 Dark Emerald Bone Golem, Erem.] [You have succeeded in creating a unique golem by stealing techniques from various places. These Dark Emerald Bone Golems, which were created with darkness magic as their foundation, not only possess high strength and can emit powerful magic, but have a high elemental resistance as well. But their greatest strength is their ability to draw in this world\u0027s darkness magic and store it in their bodies. Through that, there is a chance that they can become even stronger.] [One problem with these golems however, is that they have no value as commercial products. They will be absolutely loyal to you, as you possess darkness magic.] [You have acquired the title, \u0027Puppet Master\u0027. All stats have increased by 5. The Command skill\u0027s effect is increased, and the power of the darkness element increases slightly.] He had somewhat expected this to happen. How could he not get a title, when he had just created a golem. However, something that he hadn\u0027t expected was added on. [Your strength stat has surpassed 1,000! You have acquired the title, \u0027He Who Dreams of Giants\u0027. Strength has increased by 10. Your body is evolving so that you can exhibit greater strength.] \"Huh!?\" It seems as though the five stat bonus from Puppet Master had caused his strength to surpass 1,000 and got him a new title! When his magic had surpassed 1,000, his body had changed as well, so it was happening this time too. \"Shin Woo?\" \"Wait just a sec.\" Although it was a title related to his future growth, his body didn\u0027t change dramatically, but his body had certainly gotten stronger so that he could exhibit more of his strength. The feeling of his body being heavier and sharper wasn\u0027t bad. He was wearing armor, so one couldn\u0027t see what was underneath, but Lee Shin Woo could feel the changes. \u0027But Kratia told me that you would only get a title like this once.\u0027 He remembered clearly. At the time, she said that the first stat (strength, agility, health, or magic) to surpass 1,000 would come with a title, and that title would determine their level 5 \u0027job\u0027, and the direction of their growth. Therefore, he looked back at Kratia, but it looked like she had no idea what was going on... in the end, he decided not to say anything and move on. \u0027This is probably due to the Joker karma.\u0027 \"Well, I just got a title from making the golem. Did you get it too?\" Lee Shin Woo feigned ignorance and asked. Kratia tilted her head and obediently answered. \"Yeah, \u0027One Who Walks the Path of New Magic\u0027.\" \"Nice. I\u0027m sure we succeeded, so shall we finish making all of the golems? From Erem to Erem 277!\" \"So you really are going through with that name...\" They had succeeded in making the prototype, so there was no reason to hesitate anymore. Lee Shin Woo and Kratia activated the manufacturing equipment that had been standing by, meticulously scanned Erem, set the fine controls on the equipment, and added the materials. \"The initial activation will require my mana, so it\u0027s still a problem that I have to put my hand atop each and every one of them...\" \"Shin Woo, I\u0027m activating it!\" \"Yeah, go ahead!\" \"Roger!\" Kratia\u0027s eyes shined and activated the manufacturing process for all the equipment. The Dark Emerald Bones and the cores that were piled together like a mountain were placed into the devices one by one, radiated a blinding light here and there, and began the fusion to form the golems. Lee Shin Woo was anticipating the moment that Erem Two was finished and gathered his darkness mana. Unfortunately, no one knew that Lee Shin Woo was making an army that could threaten a part of the Empire.
