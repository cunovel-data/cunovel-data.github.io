Lightning Tooth - 2\u003e The way the golems went about with their bombardment made him think back to the Ratman launching its nails. By human standards, they were forcefully discharging the rocks attached to their arms and using the surrounding rocks to replenish their losses. \"Seems like if you take a wrong step here, it\u0027ll be the end for you.\" Lee Shin Woo muttered, as he dodged the raining rock shells and drove his axe into a golem\u0027s body. If he had come here by himself, he wouldn\u0027t die, but he would’ve had to put in a lot of effort to clear out all of them. But that ‘end’ had now become an impossible proposition. Compared to Jin\u0027s level, no, even compared to his own level, whilst riding on Jin\u0027s back the golem\u0027s bombardment was incredibly slow. Even if they shot the rocks point blank, they would be able to dodge them quite easily. \"So it seems like if there\u0027s a large difference between agility, then ranged attacks almost become completely ineffectual...\" [Ceasing... operation...] While he was fighting against the golems, he suddenly realized how important agility was. The Acid Ghoul was able to intercept his shot without much difficulty because of its agility as well. So long as it doesn\u0027t swerve along the way, and one can read the trajectory of the shot, one could avoid it without much difficulty; when he considered that the one dodging the projectile had more of an advantage than the one doing the shooting, if one wanted to kill someone with a long range attack, then he concluded that they would have to be much faster than their opponent. Fast enough that they can\u0027t read the trajectory of the shot, and fast enough that they can\u0027t grasp the timing of the shot. \"If we were to say something like this on our home worlds, we would\u0027ve been subject to ridicule.\" \"Is that something you should be saying? I\u0027m the one dodging all of the shells coming from everywhere!\" The first condition for surviving in this world was to accept that they had become a member of this world, and their preexisting common sense was invalid and couldn\u0027t be applied to this world. Based on that criteria, the two of them had passed those conditions with flying colors. \"Ah, there aren\u0027t any more.\" Had they crushed all of the golems? Once he\u0027d taken care of the golems that had first responded to him and looked up, there weren\u0027t any more rocks in the entire area. Once broken, they were neither golems nor boulders anymore, and it seemed only natural that only the considerably large boulders were golems. \"What should we do now? Should we go across from there?\" \"The region that these guys are in charge of seems to be strictly divided.\" If Lee Shin Woo walked for around a minute, he could reach an area with normal rock formations. But if he stepped one foot in, those rocks would immediately emerge as golems. Even now, that area wasn\u0027t very far off. It certainly felt strange, the golems seemingly being measured and divided, as only the golems of a fixed area had responded to them. It felt like someone had decided that \u0027you guys are in charge from here up to here.\u0027 \"For starters, are these guys really formed naturally?\" \"That\u0027s what we have to figure out now.\" Even with the shells flying towards him unceasingly, he could still fight, but the same couldn\u0027t be said about the loot; he had to leave them behind. He lead Jin around the whole area, and collected the sprawled cores and Perium off the floor. [You have acquired 3,200 Perium.] [You have acquired a Autonomous Defensive Type Bone Core.] \"Though they\u0027re level 3, they don\u0027t leave much Perium behind unless they\u0027re elites.\" \"Where do you even use that?\" \"Well, I completely understand where you\u0027re coming from since you\u0027ve never gone to the secret shop before.\" He\u0027d acquired 3,000 Perium from the golem, but it was only a third of what he\u0027d gotten from the similarly leveled elite Great Slime. Of course, it was difficult to find even one Great Slime, but the Stone Golems were comparatively easy to find, as they were spread across the plateau area, so they made up for their quality with quantity. After he\u0027d raked in all of the Perium from the entire area, he checked how much total Perium he\u0027d collected. [Total Perium - 445,870] \"Hoo.\" Was this what it feels like to be amazed at how much has changed in such a short period of time? It felt like just a few days ago he had unhesitatingly told Pleine his story in exchange for a 20,000 Perium discount, but now, he had already amassed 445,870 Perium. Of course, there were a few special circumstances that helped in that. \"Shin Woo, there\u0027s something over here.\" \"Ah.\" [Lv2 Stone Gloves] It looked like it was armor. The gloves looked like they were made of stupidly tough rock, and he wondered whether this would actually be effective in fending off his opponent\u0027s attacks; but on the contrary, he had his suspicions that these would actually cause more harm to his hands. At the very least, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t really want to equip them. [You have acquired Lv2 Stone Gloves. Through Bone Reinforcement, the item is changing. Your compatibility with the item is high, causing a special change.] However, the moment Lee Shin Woo touched the gloves, something strange happened. It was a message he had never seen before, and what\u0027s worse, it was a message he hadn\u0027t even seen when his Melting Bone Double Axe had risen in level! [You have acquired Lv3 Fossil Gloves (+5).] \"...\" But when he saw the outcome of that change, his (nonexistent) eyes naturally narrowed. Rocks and bone had come together, and had become a fossil; he wanted to tackle the Bone Reinforcement ability itself. \"But fossils aren\u0027t technically bones...\" \"Why do you need scientific knowledge all of a sudden?\" \"Nah, it\u0027s fine. It\u0027s good for me, anyway.\" Even if teeth or nails were regarded as bones, he just decided to let it go. Lee Shin Woo decided not to nitpick on each and every aspect of his ability. In any case, not only had his item leveled up, it had also been reinforced to +5, so he was satisfied. ...Though he still didn\u0027t have any intention of equipping them. \"Good, then there\u0027s only one other option.\" \"You\u0027re doing it again?\" Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t answer Jin\u0027s question, and quietly raised the Fossil Gloves (+5). In his other hand, he held not his axe, but his sword, the Bone of Thunder Lasting (+8). It wasn\u0027t an item he would equip, so he didn\u0027t consider it to be a stupid gamble. While trying his very best to ignore the other option of using the equipment to reinforce his own bones...! Something happened the moment Lee Shin Woo was about to use his Bone Reinforcement. One of the bone cores he still hadn\u0027t stored into his inventory seemed to shine brightly, and a message appeared in front of him. [If you consume a bone core and then attempt reinforcement, the success rate increases. If you use the bone core as a material for an equipment\u0027s reinforcement, it will increase even further. It is possible to use several at once in the reinforcement.] \"Huh...!?\" When he thought about it, he remembered reading that normally monsters\u0027 cores are used to produce weapons, or manufacture medicine. However, it turned out that the core itself had the power to reinforce equipment. Perhaps the equipment reinforcement permit also functioned by using the power of a core? Just a little while ago, he felt like he had wanted to \u0027try it out\u0027, but now that he\u0027d read that message, he trusted that the success rate would increase significantly by using the cores, though he had no basis for that. Lee Shin Woo put aside the Fossil Gloves for now, grabbed a bone core in one hand, and used Bone Reinforcement! [Bone Reinforcement has succeeded.] [Bone of Thunder Lasting +9] [Lv3] [Durability: 1,120/1,120] [Attack Power: 300 - 400] [Options: Strength +21, Agility +21, Power of Bursting Thunder skill +19%] \"Oh, Ooooh...!\" It had really succeeded with just one try! Lee Shin Woo was moved and embraced his weapon. However, Jin spoke calmly by his side. \"Shin Woo, on the ground.\" \"Huh? ...No...\" It was at that time that Lee Shin Woo finally realized that every single one of the bone cores he\u0027d gathered in one place had disappeared. There were a few inside his inventory that were still safe, but the rest disappeared. There were more than ten of them there, and the moment he used his reinforcement, they had resonated without his consent! \"...\" He gained new knowledge again. If he used bone cores to reinforce his equipment, the cores would resonate as they pleased! It had increased...! Fortunately, the price came cheap. It was such a relief that he hadn\u0027t attempted to reinforce his equipment while he had 100 bone cores laid out! Especially since, if he hadn\u0027t gathered the bone cores and attempted the reinforcement, he didn\u0027t know how long he\u0027d be stuck without being able to succeed. So this was fine. It was fine. \"Shin Woo, are you crying?\" \"I\u0027m not crying.\" He replied bitterly, removed the final remaining level 3 equipment reinforcement permit from his inventory, and raised it. Even if he inspected his Bone of Thunder Lasting one more time, it was still at +9. He grit his teeth and used the reinforcement permit. Then, radiant light spewed out of the weapon and a tremendous amount of mana surged. This dense mana seemed to be able to change the very material of the weapon, and heated up the air. [The Lv3 Bone of Thunder Lasting has evolved into the Lv4 Lightning Tooth!] [Lightning Tooth] [Lv4] [Durability: 1,500/1,500] [Attack Power : 450 - 480] [Element: Lightning Lv4] [Options: Strength +25, Agility +25, Power of Bursting Thunder +20%] \"This is...\" Seeing his completely transformed weapon, Lee Shin Woo interjected. It was a completely different weapon from the level 4 weapon, Thunder Lasting, that he\u0027d acquired from the zombie turned hero. By coming into his possession, it had deteriorated into bone in the past, but at least, the current Lightning Tooth didn\u0027t seem inferior to the Thunder Lasting; there was no mistake that it was actually much stronger than Thunder Lasting. That\u0027s because two tremendous powers had collided, ultimately harmonizing, and the outcome was its evolution. \"Wow, even if you compare it to the axe, the energy coming off that thing\u0027s no joke.\" \"You have considerable talent in mana as well, huh. You\u0027re right. They\u0027re both level 4, but this weapon\u0027s exceptional and is incomparable to the axe. It\u0027s not an exaggeration to say that this bone contains God\u0027s power.\" \"At any rate, it\u0027s a bone, huh...\" The blade consisted of a bone gleaming in blue light, and was longer, and sharper than before; the fact that there was a slight power of lightning within had surfaced, and began to spark. He was excited thinking about what would happen if he held this weapon and used an intermediate level of Bursting Thunder. Thus, Lee Shin Woo was spurred on to train his Bursting Thunder even more diligently than before. \u0027Acid and lightning. Flames... Then, this makes me want to use the other elements a bit.\u0027 If he only had one element out of three, that would be plenty to represent him as a hero, yet he was still greedy for more even though he had three. He still hadn\u0027t realized at this point that he possessed abilities that would more than shock his senior heroes. - Gugugugugu However, when Lee Shin Woo was fascinated with the power of his weapon, the once silent plateau area suddenly vibrated. What\u0027s worse, the vibrations gradually became worse! Did the golems wake up? If that\u0027s not it, was it a natural earthquake? Both of those were wrong. The golems were still quietly staying in their places, and it obviously wasn\u0027t an earthquake. Then, what was it? [Goooooooooooh!] \"Mm, as I thought.\" Lee Shin Woo heard the faint cry from afar, nodded his head, and spoke, as if he had expertly anticipated it. Around now, it started to feel like a traditional event. He quickly put the Fossil Gloves and his sword into his inventory, and cleanly used up the two remaining bone cores to reinforce his bones. His health increased by 1, so now he only needed 1 more stat point before he leveled up. \"What the hell is this? It\u0027s like there\u0027s a huge monster on the move, but I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s actually coming!\" \"Calm down, Jin. Since I already know what it is.\" \"You can\u0027t even see it yet, so how do you know?\" \"I just know.\" Around the time Lee Shin Woo calmly answered Jin, who was even more flustered than when he had fought the Acid Ghoul, the enemy revealed itself beyond the horizon. It was rushing towards them, yet the golems didn\u0027t stand up and attack it. It seems like it wasn\u0027t considered a trespasser. \"What kind of monster could it be!? Don\u0027t we need to run away!?\" \"There\u0027s no way to completely get away from it once it\u0027s picked its \u0027target\u0027. ...Though it\u0027s level may be different, I have experience fighting them, so wait for now.\" Of course, he didn\u0027t really have any memories of fighting it from the front. This time too, he didn\u0027t plan on fighting it face-to-face. There were a multitude of ways to kill an enemy besides slicing off their head. Around that time, Jin was able to confirm the identity of their enemy with his own two eyes, and spoke in vivid horror. \"Lv5...!? Can we win!?\" \"...Even if we can\u0027t, we have to fight. That\u0027s what the Empire\u0027s all about.\" \"That\u0027s...\" Lee Shin Woo comforted the confused Jin and checked his opponent. It had less than a couple hundred meters to go, and the appearance of a monster filled his eyes, one which he was familiar with to the point that it felt slightly tedious.
