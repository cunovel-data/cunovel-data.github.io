We Got a New Colleague! - 6\u003e Everyone shut their eyes tightly at the blinding light. The undead curse, which had built and built over dozens of years, had been converted into the highest level of light by Dark Shadow; a light so powerful that it couldn\u0027t be classified as either intermediate or high rank. [Keuk!] [Gyaahk!] It didn\u0027t matter how much you trained your body if you were to face it. Only Lee Shin Woo, who had reached peak darkness mastery, could deal with it somewhat. Fortunately, it didn\u0027t target his party. With the help of the Proof of Death, he\u0027d changed the cannon\u0027s trajectory; it possessed enough light to topple a country, and that very light went towards the capital in a gentle curve. He\u0027d converted all of the accumulated energy into light, and he would return it to its creator... It was a plausible ending. [The Heaven Defying Flag Bearer (+5) has been destroyed. Your Bone Reinforcement is not at a high enough level yet to absorb it. Repairing it is possible.] \"Of course it\u0027d be destroyed.\" While he vacantly watched the arc of light, he heard the sound of the hundred meter tall bone cannon begin to break apart and simultaneously received that message. Lee Shin Woo had expected this to happen and merely smiled bitterly. He hadn\u0027t let out a tester or anything; he\u0027d discharged all of cannon\u0027s accumulated energy at once. It would be stranger if it hadn\u0027t broken after releasing all that energy. Once the cannon was finished releasing all its energy, it broke into pieces and fell to the ground. Lee Shin Woo picked up the pieces of the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer and placed them into his inventory. When he\u0027d reached level 8, his inventory had expanded, so he was able to store all of the pieces. \"Shin Woo, you always go above and beyond my imagination when solving problems. It\u0027s thrilling. Though I don\u0027t miss it.\" \"You don\u0027t need to miss it.\" Kratia, who had just watched from start to finish, came over to him with a vacant expression and said. Lee Shin Woo pushed her aside, as she looked kind of out of it. While doing so, Kratia spoke unexpectedly. \"I think I gleaned something from that. There\u0027s something beyond what I was seeking.\" \"Oh, really?\" \"It was an element. If an element is brought to its maximum potential, it then evolves into more of a concept than an amalgamation of mana, right?\" \"R-Right... You really pieced that together from just watching that beam?\" \"Thanks, Shin Woo. You gave me some hints and a clear view of it right in front of me.\" As expected, geniuses were different. Lee Shin Woo had barely come to that realization after acquiring an innate element, yet Kratia, who was a human without Bone Reinforcement, was able to figure something out from watching his Dark Shadow first hand. He was astonished by her findings. \"...Given time and a budget, I should be able to do it too.\" \"There\u0027s plenty of time in the future.\" \"I\u0027m not talking about the time I have left.\" Because the shot was so powerful, the light remained in the air, as if it were a mirage. Kratia pointed to the mirage, no, the capital it was aimed at and said. \"Your battle\u0027s already begun. We don\u0027t have much time left here.\" \"Ah, so that\u0027s what you were talking about.\" He couldn\u0027t help but nod. If the Emperor just sat back and did nothing after getting attacked by that barrage of light, then he wouldn\u0027t be an Emperor; he\u0027d be an idiot. The final battle was approaching. Even though Kratia was a genius, she wouldn\u0027t be able to obtain an innate element in that short period of time. There was an absolute limit to one\u0027s level. \"If only you could use Bone Reinforcement on me too...\" \"I\u0027ll use it on you later if I can. For now, let\u0027s clean up and talk about how we\u0027re going to take down that pissed off Emperor... Huh?\" In any case, they\u0027d taken care of the foremost problem, so Lee Shin Woo had planned on taking care of Arema Steelworker himself. But he was shocked when he turned around. Even Wild Card couldn\u0027t predict this situation. [K-Keoheok...!] [K-Kuhaaaah...!] Chi Paul\u0027s sharp nails were penetrating through Arema\u0027s face and stomach. Lee Shin Woo could tell that its nails were piercing through Arema\u0027s core. He wasn\u0027t the only one. The other Chi Pauls were inflicting severe wounds to the other golems as well. Dana was helping them, sure, but how did they manage this in such a short period of time? Lee Shin Woo briefly felt it to be strange, but he understood when he saw the Chi Pauls crying bloody tears. [Kahaaahk!] [My eyes... My eyes hurt.] [It\u0027ll get better. Lord Paul Zero is watching us. So, concentrate on your revenge!] The light that had just recently flooded the city. Dana, as well as Arema Steelworker and his golems were unable to endure the light. However, the Chi Pauls were able to endure purely through their desire for revenge and used this opportunity to strike. \u0027An ability, which borders on an authority, that allows them to ignore everything else in the pursuit of their revenge... It\u0027s like the Joker karma. There was meaning behind their class after all.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo felt like he\u0027d understood just how frightening the \u0027Avenger\u0027 class was. He remembered how badly they wanted to take revenge on Arema and thought, \u0027perhaps this was the most desirable outcome\u0027 while also thinking of fatalism, something that didn\u0027t suit him at all. [It\u0027s... It\u0027s not over yet.] [We can\u0027t let you go so easily.] This would be the start of their true revenge. The Chi Pauls used their flames to melt the golems bit by bit, cut them apart, and eat them. They ate the clumps of iron with such voracity that they would soon finish their entire bodies. [W-What are you... What are you doing!? Stop... Stop...!] [Keuk. Kuhaah...!] Arema Steelworker cried out. Although his core had been pierced, he endured, perhaps because his core contained his human soul. But in the face of these level 8 enemies, there was nothing he could do; he merely screamed and was forced to just spectate as his golem body was devoured. \"They won\u0027t get heavy metal poisoning?\" \"That\u0027s really not a problem at this point, you think?\" Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and muttered. Jin then sighed and retorted. Kratia tried her best to look away, while Dana said \u0027M-My eyes!\u0027, unexpectedly letting out a cute voice while turning round and round in the air. \"...Heot!\" And Prince awoke at the best time. Did she even know how many times she\u0027d avoided death while she lay unconscious? She looked around, and soon pointed at Lee Shin Woo and yelled. \"My junior! Give me back my junior!\" \"You really are a pain... Mm, you think it\u0027s time?\" \"It\u0027ll probably be ok. ...Probably.\" \"What the hell are you talking about!?\" Prince gritted her teeth and yelled, seeing how familiarly the Heaven Defying General and Kratia were conversing. Lee Shin Woo took off his helmet and instantaneously changed his undead face into his human one. Prince shut her mouth. \"...Huh?\" \"Well, this is how it is, Senior. I\u0027ll explain it soon, so please be patient.\" \"Huh? ...Huh?\" Prince couldn\u0027t understand what was going on and tilted her head. Kratia thought she might struggle like Seira did, so she grabbed onto her. Fortunately, she didn\u0027t struggle. She was shocked, unable to accept what was going on, and after trying to process everything... she lost consciousness and fell to the floor once more. \"Kratia, did you hit her too hard?\" \"I admit, I was trying to hurt her. ...But I think she fainted for a different reason this time.\" \"You admit it!?\" \"With her personality, it makes sense... Ugh, she\u0027s definitely the type you don\u0027t want as your friend.\" \"Jin, how dare you talk behind her back while she\u0027s unconscious...\" \"Since she knows you\u0027re undead now, introduce me properly when she wakes up.\" The heroes conversed warmly, washing away a tiny bit of their exhaustion. Then, Chi Paul screamed in joy at fulfilling its revenge. [Kuooooooooh!] \"...I guess I got to go.\" \"Are you going to do to them what you did to me?\" \"It won\u0027t be as extreme as what I did to you. Then, I\u0027ll get going.\" The blinding light had subsided somewhat, so Dana approached him and asked. Lee Shin Woo just grinned and replied, and then went towards the Chi Pauls, who had completely devoured all of the golems without leaving a single speck of them. They looked quite menacing, such that they couldn\u0027t show themselves to outsiders, but once they saw Lee Shin Woo, they politely prostrated themselves and didn\u0027t forget to show their respect. [Thank you... Thank you so much!] [I will devote my entire being to you Lord Paul Zero, for giving me a new life and an opportunity to fulfill my revenge!] [If you still have a use for us hideous, leftover monsters, then please use us whenever you see fit!] \"How could you call yourselves monsters? You guys are family to me.\" Lee Shin Woo acted and Jin retched from behind him, but like always, he ignored her. He raised both his hands and covered the Chi Pauls with his darkness, which contained the power of Wild Card. He wasn\u0027t creating an Immortal or anything; he was just trying to make them grow into a different, more favorable direction. \"Your revenge has been fulfilled. You\u0027ve already indulged in it, so now digest it and make it your own. Then, not me, but all of you need to decide where you go next.\" [Our revenge isn\u0027t finished yet. We cannot rest until the Undead Emperor, as well as the Magic Emperor, who sent Arema down here, are killed. Please command us until then!] \"Alright. Then, follow me.\" [Yes, sir!] The darkness completely covered the Chimeras, and their bodies, which had become monstrous, melted away within the darkness. Lee Shin Woo spoke as if it were incredibly easy, but it actually wasn\u0027t so. In the process of obtaining their revenge, the Chimeras\u0027 forms had become twisted, and Lee Shin Woo was trying to change their appearance to match their karma; he was doing something ridiculous again! \"This\u0027ll hurt. Bear with it.\" [This doesn\u0027t even tickle...!] They had eaten both human and metallic bodies, and were unable to properly digest them, so Lee Shin Woo just extracted their souls. He then infused his mana into their bodies, which were a complete mess from mixing everything together, and transformed them into their most natural shape. After that, he returned their souls to their bodies and then tweaked them to suit them. Because he\u0027d acquired so much knowledge pertaining to golems, and had managed to create a few species, it wasn\u0027t very difficult for him. If God were to hear about this, she\u0027d be shocked! \"...Alright, I\u0027m finished. That was simple.\" \"Hoooo...\" Ultimately, their bodies looked no different from a human\u0027s. But they were golems on the inside, so they were definitely not human. Perhaps he\u0027d succeeded in creating the perfect \u0027Android\u0027 that everyone dreamed of. Though there was one part of them that wasn\u0027t robotic: their soul! [Lv8 Android Zero Avenger Chi Paul] [You have combined the info of countless golems and managed to create an android, a being which cannot be distinguished from a regular human. All stats have increased by 20.] In the end, it turned out exactly as he\u0027d expected. While the other Chimera Avenger remained at level 7 (or leveled up from level 6), Chi Paul, who\u0027d devoured Arema Steelworker, had reached level 8! \"A-Ah.\" Chi Paul, which had originally been made up of several souls and bodies, had finally become a singular being. Its consciousness, which felt as though it were obscured by a thick mist, had cleared up completely without a single cloud in sight. It felt as though it had woken up from a dream and had returned to reality. Chi Paul just vacantly stared at its creator. The naked handsome man was instantly garbed in armor that resembled Lee Shin Woo\u0027s. But contrary to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s armor, Chi Paul\u0027s armor was a dazzling mix of red and gold. Perhaps it was a symbol of its strength. \"Father.\" \"Huh?\" \"Father!\" \"Huh!?\" Chi Paul called him father and kneeled before him, and the other Chi Pauls followed suit. Lee Shin Woo had suddenly become the father of all these grown men, so he was startled and took a step back. However, the Chi Pauls were relentless. \"Thank you, Father!\" \"Father!\" \"I\u0027m your son, Father!\" \"Uh...\" How the hell did it turn out like this? These disgusting guys looked at him with such bright eyes, so Lee Shin Woo wondered whether he should forbid them from calling him \u0027father\u0027 for the time being or not. But he ultimately decided against it. He was weak to his allies! \"Yeah. I\u0027m your father.\" On that day, he\u0027d gained so much, and lost something trivial. The undead curse, as well as the fate of the Underground Empire, had taken one step forward towards their mutual end.
