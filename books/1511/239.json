It doesn\u0027t matter to meâ€¦ As long as you don\u0027t hold me back.\"\\n\\n Once she saw Prince and Kratia, Seira Von Retadane shrugged her shoulders and said. She was being genuine, but she still managed to piss Prince off.\\n\\n \"Hold you back!? Didn\u0027t you see me use that really strong spell back then? You ever heard of the Fire Demon?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I saw it. It was indeed a powerful spell, but I\u0027m not sure you\u0027ll be able to protect yourself with it. A magician is most powerful when protected by several of their allies. However, there aren\u0027t that many of us, and we\u0027re attempting to infiltrate a city where we don\u0027t know how many enemies there are or where they are. I do believe you\u0027re not cut out for this.\"\\n\\n \"But...!\"\\n\\n \"And please call me Retadane.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh.\"\\n\\n Retadane pointed out her flaws, being correct from start to finish, and Prince became weak. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and added.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to move covertly, but I\u0027ll take care of it. Since I have just the skill for it.\" \\n\\n \"As expected of my Junior! You do the things that Retadane can\u0027t do so naturally! It makes me shiver in excitement!\" \\n\\n \"That sounds incredibly unpleasant. You\u0027re spiteful towards me for some reason, while you\u0027re really possessive of Lee Shin Woo. ...Though I don\u0027t have any complaints if you can deal with the issue of stealth.\"\\n\\n It seemed only natural that she acted this way if he took into consideration that she was a level 8 hero with the highest seniority, but... To Lee Shin Woo, who knew about all the forces involved with Bayran and the inside story on Retadane, he felt like her actions were foolish, or even a bit cute.\\n\\n \u0027She must be hoping that Seagald doesn\u0027t come.\u0027\\n\\n He briefly organized his thoughts and then asked Retadane. This was to put the decision he\u0027d made beforehand into motion.\\n\\n \"Retadane, do you have a reason for going to Bayran?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Now that you mention it, I wanted to talk about that.\"\\n\\n Retadane then pulled out a piece of paper from her chest. As he suspected, it was a Bayran Inner Map.\\n\\n \"Ooooooooh!\"\\n\\n \"Hm.\"\\n\\n \"I got this from the Vulture General. You should remember seeing it when I was distributing the loot. It seems like it\u0027s only given to the one who inflicted the most damage to him. In this case, me.\"\\n\\n As expected, that\u0027s why the map had automatically come to him when he\u0027d killed the Beast General. Lee Shin Woo thoroughly looked over the map. While he was analyzing the map and mentally comparing it to the other maps he owned, she continued to speak.\\n\\n \"I wondered why this came off of one of the 12 Generals, and also suspected that it might be a trap... I came to the conclusion that I needed to see for myself. After that, I investigated for two months and prepared my skills and equipment... When I was about to leave, Lee Shin Woo mentioned Bayran.\"\\n\\n \"So what, you think it was fate?\"\\n\\n Retadane explained calmly, but it seemed like Prince found something unpleasant about it, as she pouted suddenly. Then, Retadane nodded her head seriously.\\n\\n \"Yes. The fact that Lee Shin Woo was headed to Bayran too means that God is leading us there. I feel like there\u0027s something important in Bayran. Something that\u0027s related to our purification of the Underground Empire.\"\\n\\n \"...Oh, that\u0027s what you were talking about?\"\\n\\n \"What else is there?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, nothing. Never mind.\"\\n\\n Retadane ignored Prince\u0027s clearly suspicious signs (Kratia softly hit the back of Prince\u0027s head instead and Lee Shin Woo inwardly applauded) and went deeper into her motives.\\n\\n \"Moreover... Moreover, I know this place well.\"\\n\\n \"You know this place well... Perhaps...?\"\\n\\n \"No. My family wasn\u0027t responsible for this area. It\u0027s just that... this place was created for a special reason.\"\\n\\n \"A special reason...\"\\n\\n \"Yes. ...This city was created for spirits.\"\\n\\n For a moment, Lee Shin Woo stopped moving. Retadane retained her bitter expression.\\n\\n \"The citizens of the Empire loved spirits. They believed that spirits were God\u0027s representatives and that their forms were far more developed than humans\u0027. Thus, Elementalists, who could commune with spirits and borrow their power, were treated very well.\"\\n\\n \"...I see.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s only natural. Since only those who loved spirits and the spirits themselves were sent underground. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Kratia\u0027s eyes shined.\\n\\n \"Most magicians reject Elementalists. Since their power often goes against a magician\u0027s reason. Like Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t have to add that last part.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s strange that the Empire, which had progressed their magic engineering so far, would love spirits so much.\"\\n\\n \"There were, of course, some people within the Empire that hated spirits as well.\" \\n\\n Retadane confirmed Kratia\u0027s theory with a nod of her head.\\n\\n \"Bayran was created to protect the spirits and the Elementalists from such individuals. It\u0027s connected directly to the capital, the lake is clean and beautiful, and there are several mountains around it. It\u0027s a place well-suited for the spirits. The palace\u0027s Elementalist Order used Bayran as a branch office as well.\"\\n\\n \"And what about protecting the spirits?\"\\n\\n \"If the spirits are scattered, then there\u0027s a chance that they\u0027ll be hunted down by humans, but if they\u0027re all in one place, then even the entire Knight Order would be no match for them. The Empire wanted to create a place where the spirits could stay and relax. ...Though it was a failure.\"\\n\\n \"A failure, huh.\"\\n\\n Perhaps joining up with Retadane had been a good idea. Since there was no other way to obtain such detailed information about the Empire, aside from someone who had actually lived during that time!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo inwardly nodded in satisfaction at granny Retadane\u0027s story as she was just getting to the climax of the story.\\n\\n \"They wanted to create a special dungeon called the \u0027Spirits\u0027 Spring\u0027 within Bayran. They sought to create a space where only spirits and those the spirits permitted could enter, but... In the process, something went wrong. The palace\u0027s Elementalist Leader, Princess Dana Von Etliber was put in charge of creating the Spirits\u0027 Spring... and was also put in charge of Bayran as well.\"\\n\\n \"Dana Von Etliber.\"\\n\\n He could tell how this was going to end. Lee Shin Woo had heard this story and this person\u0027s name before. Lee Shin Woo narrowed his eyes and Retadane continued calmly. He briefly felt an indescribable sadness and fury from her expression, but Lee Shin Woo wanted to believe that it was just a delusion. He wanted to believe it was, but...\\n\\n \"She is also one of the 12 Generals, called the Spirit General. To this day, she\u0027s probably still in Bayran.\"\\n\\n \"!?\"\\n\\n Kratia and Prince\u0027s eyes widened. Lee Shin Woo just sighed.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know whether or not the other 12 Generals will come, but there\u0027s already one of them there.\"\\n\\n \"Plus, it should be filled with several corrupted spirits as well. Even so, I will find her. I was scared thus far, but... I believe now is the time to go looking for her. Lee Shin Woo, could you please help me? Are you prepared to fight against the 12 Generals?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. After all, it\u0027s our duty to take down the 12 Generals.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Just keep thinking like that. ...You\u0027re quite reliable. Please make sure I don\u0027t lose my way.\"\\n\\n It seemed like she was trying her best to not show any signs, but Lee Shin Woo could hear the loneliness within her voice. Retadane, who was likely the daughter of a duke, must\u0027ve been close with the princess. \\n\\n He thought she was just a crazy woman who was only interested in killing the undead, but looking at her now, perhaps her hatred towards the undead wasn\u0027t so simple... He felt that pointless feeling slightly, very slightly.\\n\\n \"With this party, killing the 12 Generals is... No, it\u0027s a piece of cake. We\u0027ve only gathered elites!\"\\n\\n \"If we exclude you, Prince.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you exclude me!? I\u0027ve gotten a lot stronger too! I\u0027ve really gotten a lot stronger!\"\\n\\n \"Taking on one of the 12 Generals isn\u0027t an issue. I already told you. That there wouldn\u0027t be just one or two of them there. ...If you\u0027re not confident, then you can turn around now.\"\\n\\n Prince was pissed as she hung onto Kratia and questioned Retadane, but Lee Shin Woo replied calmly. Hearing that, Prince straightened her back, as if ice had been poured onto it, and responded confidently, even while pouting.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all ready. I\u0027m just shaking a bit! Since I\u0027m so excited!\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re fine. I came prepared too, so I have something to show you.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo then took out three pieces of paper. The three women tilted their heads, but one of them stiffened at the sight of the papers.\\n\\n \"These are...\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re all Bayran Inner Maps...\"\\n\\n \"Lee Shin Woo, where did you get these?\"\\n\\n \"I got each of them from a different member of the 12 Generals.\"\\n\\n \"What!?\"\\n\\n Kratia remained calm, as it wasn\u0027t news to her. Prince\u0027s pupils shook. Seira Von Retadane didn\u0027t even respond; she just looked stiff. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t give them a chance to respond and continued. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure how Bayran was when you last saw it, but the imperial troops have made a lot of changes to it. And if we put all the maps together, then...\"\\n\\n \"Wait, it\u0027s filled with traps everywhere! Such vicious traps at that!\"\\n\\n \"The worst part about it is that there may be more maps than just these four. There are twelve generals, per their title. But the chance of that is low. Of course, there may be some fakes among the maps, but... with this many of them, we should be able to pick the safest route by comparing them, no?\"\\n\\n He was originally going to do this, but he didn\u0027t say that and just looked at Retadane. She was still looking at the maps with a stiff expression, but once she realized that he was waiting for her response, she quietly agreed.\\n\\n \"My knowledge will be helpful in your analysis. But we\u0027ll need some time to prepare. We should stay here before we infiltrate the city. I\u0027m sorry everyone, but could you prepare the camp?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n She probably had much she wanted to ask him and much she wanted to tell him, but she generously let it go. Whereas Prince looked like she wanted to ask Lee Shin Woo a hundred questions, but Kratia immediately stopped her.\\n\\n \"You knew, didn\u0027t you!? That my Junior took down some of the other 12 Generals alone!\"\\n\\n \"Of course. Since I was with him each time. So technically he didn\u0027t take them down alone. We took them down together.\"\\n\\n \"Aaaaaaaah!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had not only killed a few of the 12 Generals in an unknown place without her knowledge, but Lee Shin Woo and Kratia had taken them out, just the two of them (though Jin was actually with them as well!). Upon this realization, Prince screamed and was hit by Kratia again.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me...?\"\\n\\n \"I knew you\u0027d worry about me. I\u0027m sorry, Senior. We didn\u0027t fight them because we wanted to. We had the misfortune of running into them, so we had no choice but to fight them to survive.\"\\n\\n \"Ahhhhhh!\"\\n\\n It was a lie, of course, but Lee Shin Woo\u0027s acting was enough to trick her. Retadane, who was standing beside them and perusing the maps, nodded slightly. She probably attributed that to why \u0027Lee Shin Woo was so strong\u0027.\\n\\n \"...In any case, I\u0027ve gotten a lot stronger too. You don\u0027t need to do something so dangerous alone anymore. Just follow me!\"\\n\\n \"Ok, Senior. Then please help me set up this tent.\"\\n\\n \"Leave it to me!\"\\n\\n He really loved idiots; they were so easy to manipulate... Lee Shin Woo watched Prince busily move around to set up the tent and smiled. Beside him, Kratia and Jin were speechless, but as always, Lee Shin Woo just ignored them.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-239","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
