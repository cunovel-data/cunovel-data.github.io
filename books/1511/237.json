Bayran Infiltration - 1\u003e\\n\\n \"Bayran.\"\\n\\n Bayran was located in the level 4 danger zone and was an extremely large city, which led directly to the capital. He knew he needed to go there eventually. But to think that Arema Steelworker was going over there... This was obviously no coincidence.\\n\\n \"Arema Steelworker, huh.\"\\n\\n [That\u0027s correct. You already knew that their movements were unusual following our last great battle. We\u0027ve also seen the Emperor\u0027s forces and the Anti-Skull fight in a few small skirmishes, but...]\\n\\n \"Did they make any suspicious moves after that?\"\\n\\n [Yes. Arema Steelworker and some golems, which emitted a strong energy, appeared where you said they would, and we\u0027ve confirmed that they\u0027re moving in a particular direction. It\u0027s the route to Bayran.]\\n\\n \"...As I thought. Good work. It\u0027s important info. But you mentioned that their movements weren\u0027t particularly hidden?\"\\n\\n [Yes. ...They moved so conspicuously that I suspect it was on purpose. Please take that into consideration.]\\n\\n He could trust in the Chimeras\u0027 and their hostility towards Arema Steelworker, but something smelled off with their info...\\n\\n Why was Arema Steelworker acting now, when he had been so quiet thus far? According to the information he\u0027d procured on the surface, Arema Steelworker wasn\u0027t the type to take risks against the Undead Emperor. Moreover, he\u0027s showing himself and going to Bayran? That was way too suspicious.\\n\\n \u0027That guy\u0027s objective might be the heroes instead.\u0027\\n\\n Everything was progressing as the Magic Emperor wished. However, all of the heroes were currently underground and attempting to overthrow the Undead Emperor. A few of the 12 Generals had been killed, and killing the Undead Emperor had become an actual possibility. Perhaps Arema Steelworker was wary of the heroes interrupting his plan.\\n\\n If not, then perhaps he was trying to eliminate them in case they posed a threat to the surface... No, that was unlikely. Since Arema Steelworker should have in-depth knowledge regarding the underground barrier.\\n\\n \u0027If it\u0027s none of those options, then there\u0027s only one possibility left... He may be trying to kill the Heaven Defying General.\u0027\\n\\n Paul Zero, or the Heaven Defying General was considered the \u0027hottest potato\u0027 underground. They didn\u0027t know where the Heaven Defying General would pop up and he was bizarre, as he acted outside the scope of normal undead behavior. No one could tell whether the Heaven Defying General was really an undead or not.\\n\\n ...Thus, there was a high likelihood of Arema Steelworker being wary of him. Arema Steelworker\u0027s conspicuous movements must be to draw the Heaven Defying General to Bayran and annihilate his forces.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s assume this information has been leaked to the other heroes... He may be trying to get the Heaven Defying General and the heroes to meet.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo quickly organized his thoughts. And then, he smiled bitterly at the Chi Pauls, who were awaiting his orders, and said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to Bayran. I have another mission for you.\"\\n\\n [But my lord!]\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a trap, I know. He\u0027s probably trying to get us, the imperial troops, and the heroes to fight against each other. Going with a large force is a bad idea.\"\\n\\n [That\u0027s true, but my lord, I\u0027m concerned for your safety!]\\n\\n They claimed they were concerned for his safety, but they couldn\u0027t hide their thirst for vengeance that dwelled within their blazing goblin fire. If anyone other than their master, Lee Shin Woo, had ordered them not to go, then they might have fought back. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and explained.\\n\\n \"If I bring you all with me, then they\u0027ll know I\u0027m the Heaven Defying General. Also, you don\u0027t have to be concerned for my safety. Even if he attacks me with all four of the Four Heavenly Commanders, I can win all by myself. Of course, he could have something hidden up his sleeve, but the moment we face off head-to-head, he\u0027ll be no match for me. I\u0027m sure of it. You see, I have a secret weapon of my own.\"\\n\\n [A weapon...?]\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Once he\u0027d ascertained Arema Steelworker\u0027s true identity, he\u0027d given Bisher Moon a single order through Rem.\\n\\n Bisher Moon had fulfilled his duty and gotten Lee Shin Woo what he\u0027d wanted. Fortunately, Bisher had passed it on to him before Lee Shin Woo had to leave the surface. So long as he had \u0027that\u0027, there was no chance that he\u0027d lose to Arema Steelworker.\\n\\n \u0027Though I wasn\u0027t able to create a new seal that surpassed Arema Steelworker\u0027s...\u0027\\n\\n The end justifies the means. What\u0027s important was that Arema Steelworker\u0027s golem army posed absolutely no threat to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t even consider him a target anymore. He was worried about the other 12 Generals interfering, especially...\\n\\n \u0027Seagald Von Retadane...\u0027\\n\\n One of the 12 Generals, who possessed the title of Annihilation Flame Sword God. He was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders. The undead who commanded the organization, Anti-Skull.\\n\\n How would he, who researched till the bitter end so that his people didn\u0027t turn into the undead, have turned out? Would he be deluded, just like the Undead Emperor? If not, then would he be independent and free-willed like Lee Shin Woo?\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps my greatest foe will be him...\u0027\\n\\n Would Seagald have missed Arema Steelworker\u0027s movements? Unlikely. He\u0027d even encountered Lee Shin Woo\u0027s troops, who had moved as secretly as possible. They had been quiet until now, but if they decided to act in earnest, then their mobility and information gathering wouldn\u0027t lose to any of the other factions. \\n\\n \"I suppose I won\u0027t know anything for sure until I meet him in person.\"\\n\\n \"Meet who?\"\\n\\n \"Anyone. This might be as big of a mess as the one on the surface.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to make the mess, Shin Woo. Just like what you\u0027ve done up till now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just preparing myself thoroughly.\"\\n\\n Prepare yourself for the worst, ready yourself for every variable, and then make your move. This line of thinking had become even better ever since he\u0027d gained the Wild Card skill. If Jin could read his mind, then she\u0027d say \u0027so in the other words, you\u0027re going to make a mess of things from now on too.\u0027 and despair, but fortunately, she didn\u0027t possess a mind reading skill.\\n\\n \u0027I wanted to go only after I\u0027d gathered a few more maps.\u0027\\n\\n He possessed three Bayran Inner Maps. These maps were dropped by the 12 Generals. Unfortunately, each of the three maps\u0027 contents were different.\\n\\n If he had two more maps, or even just one more, then he would be able to compare the differences among them and create a singular map, but... It couldn\u0027t be helped. He didn\u0027t have any more. Lee Shin Woo had no other choice but to arrive on site and rely on his Wild Card skill!\\n\\n \"Hoo... Mm?\"\\n\\n [Lord Paul Zero...!]\\n\\n \"Good grief.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and sighed. However, Chi Paul was looking straight at him. His gaze was so intense that it felt like lasers would shoot out of them.\\n\\n \"...Fine. Let\u0027s go. You have to try and get your revenge, don\u0027t you.\"\\n\\n [Really!?]\\n\\n Their very essence was made up of vengeance. He couldn\u0027t stop them from coming, especially when they wanted to meet the target of their revenge so badly.\\n\\n Above all, Lee Shin Woo felt slightly guilty towards all of his undead subordinates. He thought that if his subordinates had free-will, then he\u0027d respect it. However, that had turned out to be a lie.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to pretend to be a human. I told you before, but we can\u0027t go together. So we\u0027ll space ourselves out, exchange opinions from afar, and then act.\"\\n\\n [Understood!]\\n\\n Chi Paul was a level 7 elite. Ever since he had been in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s service, he had been a level 7 elite. However, he had grown immensely, and through this recent round of Bone Reinforcement, his stats were almost at 9,000.\\n\\n Moreover, four of the other Chi Pauls had gotten to level 7 through their recent reinforcement, so they were more than enough to take on one of the 12 Generals. If he used them well, then they would definitely be a lot of help to him.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s nice to be back underground. After all, I can call guys like this without hesitation.\u0027\\n\\n Now that he thought about it, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s actions on the surface had been a \u0027one-man show\u0027. Even his most trustworthy ally, the Pope, hadn\u0027t stepped foot onto the battlefield and was the type to show his true worth when dealing with other people.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo wondered how Ye Jin Jin was doing on the surface, but soon grinned and organized his thoughts.\\n\\n \"Then, get ready to leave. I\u0027ll do a final check over the data.\"\\n\\n [Yes sir!]\\n\\n Was there really any need to look over the data? Lee Shin Woo wanted to pay his respects to his seniors before the battle, and it was also meant to act as a pick-off throw. He then accessed the chatting channel.\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: Seniors, have you all been well?]\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: I feel like I\u0027m going to die.]\\n\\n [Erian Ruparte: I feel for you. We just got out of a dungeon. You have good timing, Lee Shin Woo.]\\n\\n The first person to greet him was Lloyd. He\u0027d gone through a lot, but Lee Shin Woo could say that Lloyd was, without question, the most hero-like of the heroes. After his duel with Lee Shin Woo, Lloyd had matured mentally a little bit, and had become a hero that would really suit a comic book.\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027m glad you\u0027re alright. I just cleared a dungeon myself. It\u0027s nice that there are so many dungeons in the level 4 danger zone.]\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: But there\u0027s danger lurking everywhere. You never know when you\u0027ll meet one of the 12 Generals.]\\n\\n [Prince Altania: I agree 100%.]\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: ...Senior Prince, there\u0027s no reason to deliberately follow Kratia\u0027s speech pattern, is there?]\\n\\n [Prince Altania: I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just that, hanging out with her for so long has made me talk a lot less!]\\n\\n She didn\u0027t seem to talk any less than before, but he just grinned and went with the flow. \\n\\n He felt at peace somewhere in his heart, as he was able to talk with his comrades after such a long time. It was a relationship filled with lies and deceit, but he felt warmth from the relationship regardless. Perhaps this was proof that he was changing.\\n\\n [Erian Rupate: I was concerned since you hadn\u0027t kept in contact for so long. Though I know that you\u0027re the type of person who works well alone.]\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: I apologize. I knew I needed to get a lot stronger, so... I was completely absorbed in my endeavors.]\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: It\u0027s fine, since you\u0027re ok. ...You see, I have high expectations for you. I was able to grow because of you, so I hope you always stay as you are... Why am I suddenly saying something so embarrassing!?]\\n\\n [Prince Altania: So you can feel embarrassment, huh. You really have grown.]\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: Prince, you...!]\\n\\n Will there come a day where he tells them the truth? If not, then would it be better if he never told some of them, since he can assume a perfect human form...\\n\\n He briefly pondered on the multiple scenarios that popped up in his head and just grinned. Lee Shin Woo realized that he considered the other heroes as comrades, or allies. Back then (when he had first come to the Underground Empire), he would\u0027ve held his stomach in laughter.\\n\\n Of course, this had only become possible because he had become so strong than none of them could pose a threat to him.\\n\\n \u0027But still, allies huh...\u0027\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t a bad feeling. That was even more surprising, but Lee Shin Woo decided to accept that newfound feeling. Perhaps this was natural growth that came about due to his level up.\\n\\n [Prince Altania: In any case, Kratia suggested that we meet up. You must have it rough being alone, Junior, so I\u0027ll come personally to...]\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027m going to Bayran right now. It\u0027s a large city within the level 4 danger zone. Is there anyone currently in that area?]\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: Bayran...]\\n\\n [Prince Altania: Eut. That\u0027s...]\\n\\n They muttered, but none of the other heroes said yes. It was exactly as he\u0027d expected. It would be dangerous anyway, as there was a chance that the other 12 Generals, or undead forces would be there, so he was just going to warn them that they shouldn\u0027t approach.\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: Yes, it\u0027s dangerous. And it\u0027ll get even more dangerous from here on out. I recommend that you do not approach Bayran unless I ask you for help. You too, Senior Prince.]\\n\\n That\u0027s right. This was his way of keeping his seniors out of danger, but...\\n\\n [Seira Von Retadane: I\u0027m already on my way there. ...What a coincidence, Lee Shin Woo. Would you like to meet up?]\\n\\n \"...Huh?\"\\n\\n A coincidence? He was pretty sure he should be the one saying that.\\n\\n The person he\u0027d least wanted to associate himself with had taken the bait.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-237","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
