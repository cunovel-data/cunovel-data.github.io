I\u0027m truly, truly thankful that you\u0027ve loved and supported \u0027Stop, Friendly Fire\u0027 for so long. Ah... I feel truly moved for being able to write another afterword like this. I\u0027ve made many mistakes, had many thoughts, and failed many times. It was truly a long 1 year. No, perhaps I was trapped in an illusion after \u0027Everyone is a Returnee\u0027. One always has to honor their original intention, but it doesn\u0027t always work out that way. I\u0027ve made several wrong choices and sometimes, I\u0027ve hated my own work. As an author, that\u0027s the worst, and it also disqualifies me as a pro. Nonetheless, I find it fun to write. I have nothing else but writing. This work, \u0027Stop, Friendly Fire\u0027 made me realize that. Whenever Shin Woo did something ridiculous, I would snicker. I thought about what heroine I\u0027d like to make this time around, and when I made the decision to make Jin, a skeleton horse, the heroine, all the other authors aside from me went crazy. That\u0027s right. To be honest, Jin became the heroine as soon as I added her in. You all didn\u0027t believe me, but I really went with it. As a result... No, let\u0027s not talk about it. Before this one, I went through two different novels, which were really different for me in a lot of ways, but... To be honest, it was just as difficult while writing them. I felt weak as I was writing them, and I had my doubts, like \u0027Is this right?\u0027, so I wasn\u0027t able to write for a month (You must be asking, \u0027Then why didn\u0027t you stop writing it?\u0027 To be honest, it was all stuff I\u0027d had stocked up already!) But because there were readers who loved and supported me and had their laughs when they read about Shin Woo, I was able to put my love into Shin Woo and the rest of the cast. I was determined to write even better. Because of that, I was able to complete this story. I\u0027m not sure how you feel about this, but I don\u0027t think I could\u0027ve written a different ending. It\u0027s an honor if you like the ending. Thank you very much for all the readers who stuck with me to the very end. I was able to keep going because of you. I was given the courage to try something new. My next work will be a bit more bold than before. I\u0027ve never written something like it before. The pace is a bit slower and the system\u0027s gone too. It\u0027s the type of story that I want to write. The type of story where the laughs come naturally while I write it. When I let various things go, I found that my hands move themselves. I want to write it, so I\u0027m writing it. But the characteristic of the work... Mm, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s going to be published on Munpia. In any case, I\u0027ll see you again in mid-January, so please wait for me. Once again, I sincerely thank you. Then I\u0027ll get going now. Finally, I\u0027ll be leaving you with an illustration that Mr. Gyudon drew for me. The guy\u0027s this good looking.
