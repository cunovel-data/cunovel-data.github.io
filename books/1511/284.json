War\u0027s Scenario - 2\u003e\n [Lloyd H.K.: Shin Woo, Silene is...!]\n [Lee Shin Woo: Senior, I get it already, so please don\u0027t cry and take your time.]\n [Erian Ruparte: We\u0027ve been anxious lately since Retadane disappeared, but... Lee Shin Woo. I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re the one who\u0027s suffering the most...]\n [Lee Shin Woo: No, it\u0027s fine, so please go ahead and explain.]\n Wait, why would he suffer from Seira\u0027s death? He urged them to get to the main point whilst tilting his head. Then, Erian continued, as if she understood what he was thinking.\n [Erian Ruparte: Anyway... We\u0027ve been really anxious lately, but all of a sudden, Silene Viesa came into the channel.]\n [Lee Shin Woo: He did, did he?]\n Lee Shin Woo checked, confirming that Silene was still accessing the chatting channel. However, he wasn\u0027t talking, likely because he was in a situation where he couldn\u0027t.\n That meant he wasn\u0027t dead yet... He was really surprised since he expected Silene to be dead already, but he pretended like he wasn\u0027t.\n \u0027Wait a sec. This is... What is this? Ha, that\u0027s hilarious.\u0027\n More importantly... He didn\u0027t want to believe it, but he felt like something was off with the chatting channel. It wasn\u0027t the normal chatting channel! Contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who was feeling a bit anxious, Erian calmly continued with her explanation.\n [Erian Ruparte: But I think he encountered one of the 12 Generals. I don\u0027t know which one he met, but... I believe he\u0027s been captured. He\u0027s been imprisoned.]\n [Lee Shin Woo: One of the 12 Generals, huh...]\n ...Lee Shin Woo thought about which of the 12 Generals it could be.\n [Lloyd H.K.: Those damn undead. To think they\u0027d take Silene hostage...!]\n [Lee Shin Woo: I see. So he\u0027s been captured alive. I wonder why they\u0027ve taken such a merciful approach? How shocking...]\n It was so obvious what was going on; Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Acting ability couldn\u0027t handle their stupidity and he let his insincerity slip. Erian noticed, seemingly more anxious than before, and yelled desperately.\n [Erian Ruparte: We know how shocking it must\u0027ve been to lose Seira. However... Lee Shin Woo, we would appreciate it if you helped us. We can\u0027t just leave him out to die! He\u0027s your junior, someone who greatly respected you!]\n Who lost who exactly? He was shocked because of who? Their delusions had run this rampant during the time that Lee Shin Woo and Seira were out of touch...? Lee Shin Woo was astounded and remained silent, but then Lloyd continued where Erian had left off with a loud voice.\n [Lloyd H.K.: If we work together, we can take down one of the 12 Generals. We have to hurry. It\u0027ll get even harder if he calls for reinforcements. Shin Woo... Help us.]\n [Erian Ruparte: Lee Shin Woo.]\n Both seniors asked seriously. Lee Shin Woo closed his eyes in thought. He already knew what to say to these incorrigible idiots, but he wanted to organize his thoughts before doing so.\n [Lloyd H.K.: Shin Woo, if we work together, then we should be able to save our comrade from certain danger...]\n [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027m sorry, but...]\n They were about to try persuading him once more, but then Lee Shin Woo firmly said...\n [Lee Shin Woo: I can\u0027t go right now. I\u0027m sorry, but it looks like you\u0027ll have to give up on Silene. Please don\u0027t go anywhere. ...I\u0027m sure you already know about the underground\u0027s sun, yes?]\n [Lloyd H.K.: Lee Shin Woo!]\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t even reply and just left the chatting channel. He then checked his Mana Radar and sighed deeply. He\u0027d hoped that he was wrong.\n Then, Seira and the rest of his party trickled in. He only called Seira, so why were all of them here? He tilted his head and asked.\n \"Seira, I want to ask you something.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"Can a person use the chatting channel to affect another\u0027s mana? In other words, is it possible to use darkness mana to find the other heroes\u0027 location or info?\"\n In response, Seira sported a strange expression. It was as if she was saying \u0027I never even thought of that\u0027. She looked straight at him and said.\n \"What\u0027s with you all of a sudden? You know that the chatting channel is a part of God\u0027s domain.\"\n \"Yeah. I thought so too, but I sensed darkness mana within the chatting channel. Isn\u0027t that strange?\"\n That\u0027s right. That was the main source of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s uneasiness. What\u0027s worse, he felt an attempt at a \u0027forced connection\u0027 in order to figure out his location.\n He\u0027d led that mana to an entirely different location, but it wouldn\u0027t have been possible had it not been for his maxed out Darkness Element and Dark Shadow.\n \"The chatting channel is a domain comprised of God\u0027s mana, so how could another person\u0027s mana interfere with it? That\u0027s extremely hard to believe... But if you sensed it, then you\u0027re probably right. It seems like you were able to control your mana as you please within the chatting channel too.\"\n Seira was well-versed in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s abilities. She\u0027d felt it was strange and thought about it, furrowing her eyebrows, and then said.\n \"This has never happened before. If it did, I wasn\u0027t aware of it.\"\n \"I could\u0027ve asked Ethan Cruz if he were still alive.\"\n \"That really makes me feel sorry for myself.\"\n He ignored Seira\u0027s sarcastic remark and heard Kratia\u0027s cautious voice.\n \"...Shin Woo, the fact that they\u0027ve intruded upon God\u0027s power means that...\"\n \"Yeah. If we make a mistake, then no new heroes will be summoned... So, we have to end it. I don\u0027t think I have to worry about you two, but just in case, Jin, Kratia, don\u0027t go into the chatting channel.\"\n While he was at it, he sent Prince a private message telling her not to enter the chatting channel. Fortunately, he wasn\u0027t too late and she obeyed his warning.\n [Prince Altania: Silene Viesa? He\u0027s already dead to me.]\n \"As expected of a veteran hero.\"\n Prince was busy exploring dungeons on the surface, so she didn\u0027t have the time to come down and save Silene. It was quite fortunate actually. Silene Viesa was likewise already dead to Lee Shin Woo as well.\n If Silene Viesa had brought the darkness mana within him by entering the chatting channel, then he was playing in the palm of their enemies\u0027 hands. It was already too late to even consider saving him.\n Did Erian and Lloyd not realize this? They probably didn\u0027t. They were unsure if they could even take down the weakest of the 12 Generals, yet they wanted to save him? It was all just hot air.\n [Prince Altania: Lloyd\u0027ll probably trust in his abilities and try saving him himself... He\u0027s probably cursing at us too.]\n \"I\u0027d be happy if that\u0027s all that happens.\"\n [Prince Altania: We weren\u0027t originally good friends, so it\u0027s not surprising. Still... Junior... Lloyd\u0027s in danger, isn\u0027t he?]\n \"...Yes.\"\n Lee Shin Woo replied honestly. The battle had already begun. Their foes had succeeded in hacking into Silene\u0027s hero abilities and were attempting to track down the other heroes, so... it didn\u0027t matter whether the two heroes went to save him or not, they were in danger.\n \"They\u0027re in incredible danger, as they have no way of stopping the enemy from tracking them down. Of course, they won\u0027t be caught immediately, as they\u0027re still quite far away.\"\n [Prince Altania: But if the Archmage himself goes, then...]\n \"...I threw them off their trail too, but it shouldn\u0027t slow down someone skilled enough to hack into the chatting channel for very long.\"\n [Prince Altania: ...]\n Prince was dead quiet. Lee Shin Woo could easily tell how she was feeling and smiled bitterly.\n \"Why\u0027re you being so honorable now? It\u0027s not like you.\"\n [Prince Altania: You\u0027re one to talk! Even I have a sense of shame, ok? I know how much you\u0027ve helped me and I know that I\u0027m leaving all the tough stuff to you (the fight between the surface and underground).]\n He\u0027s glad she knew. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and said.\n \"So what are you getting at?\"\n [Prince Altania: ...Well... Junior, can\u0027t you save Lloyd for me? Is it too much? Is it impossible?]\n \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re actually asking me that.\"\n [Prince Altania: You told me to ask! You told me!]\n \"I\u0027m shocked. There\u0027s a limit to how brazen you can be.\"\n [Prince Altania: Hey!]\n It really was fun playing around with her... Err, it was fun talking to her. He felt the stress from those idiots, Lloyd and Erian, wash away and took a deep breath. And then he said...\n \"I\u0027ll try. Don\u0027t hate me if it doesn\u0027t work. Since I\u0027ll bring you Lloyd\u0027s bone.\"\n [Prince Altania: What\u0027s the point of bringing me his bone!? I don\u0027t like bones you know!?]\n \"I\u0027m being really generous here. I guess you don\u0027t know me that well.\"\n [Prince Altania: ...Junior.]\n Despite his small talk, Prince\u0027s voice died down. Since she knew just what she was asking of him.\n [Prince Altania: Thanks. Aside from the bone issue... Thanks for everything.]\n \"So just relax and clear the dungeons, Senior.\"\n [Prince Altania: Don\u0027t die. You\u0027re not allowed to die.]\n \"I don\u0027t die even when I\u0027m killed, so don\u0027t worry about me.\"\n After he was finished, he stood up. Everything was looking at him, but they already knew what he was going to say. If he was going now, then that meant...\n \"Total war? I really wanted to combine the Annihilation Flame Bone Core and the Titan before then.\"\n \"We haven\u0027t practiced enough... Sseup, I guess it can\u0027t be helped.\"\n \"Would you like me to bring the others from the surface? They\u0027re all waiting for your order, Hero.\"\n \"I\u0027m ready to cry whenever you need me. Crying for you is... I guess I\u0027ll tell you at the end.\"\n They all seemed much livelier than before, especially Seira, whose change was surprising. It was as though Seagald\u0027s death had released her from a heart demon [1], as she acted her age now. But unfortunately...\n \"Sorry to rain on your parade, but it\u0027s not yet time. I only called Seira, remember? Go back to work. Especially you, Kratia. I\u0027m leaving the Titan to you.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Think about it. Why is the capital only now trying to find where the heroes are? There\u0027s no way they\u0027d focus on the heroes. Think about it. They\u0027ve basically taken no damage from the heroes. They took the most damage from either Anti-Skull or the Heaven Defying General. Of course, the Heaven Defying General is actually a hero, but they don\u0027t know that.\"\n \"Then why...?\"\n \"They\u0027re trying to clean up. In other words, they\u0027re trying to reduce the number of variables. Thus, the Archmage, not the Emperor has come forward.\"\n That\u0027s right. Lee Shin Woo had already figured out that the Archmage had messed with the chatting channel.\n How did he do it? It was simple. He had used darkness mana within the chatting channel, so Lee Shin Woo was not only able to hide his location but could also trace the Archmage\u0027s mana back to its source (and found Silene Viesa\u0027s location as well), as well as locate Lloyd and Erian on the side!\n \"So I checked with the Mana Radar and ta-da! The Archmage was there.\"\n \"I see. Our enemies are trying to kill the heroes to reduce the number of unknowns.\"\n \"So, as a result, you not only figured out that the Archmage is outside of the capital, but what his motives and location are as well...?\"\n \"Exactly.\"\n Since he knew the Archmage\u0027s plan and location, he was now in the driver\u0027s seat. All he needed to do was wait for the right opportunity!\n \"You\u0027re not going to save Lloyd. You\u0027re using him to lure the Archmage out of the palace so that you can kill him... Am I right?\"\n \"Yep.\"\n \"...\"\n \"You\u0027re... the same as ever. You don\u0027t need to be so thorough. You don\u0027t have to be so cautious...\"\n Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders. To be honest, he had already sent his Erem brigade to the coordinates and planned to use Fire Shadow to get there when it was time. But he didn\u0027t really need to tell them that.\n \"Then, I\u0027ll get going.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you say you would wait for the right time?\"\n \"Ah, that\u0027s not it.\"\n Lee Shin Woo used one of the permits to God\u0027s secret shop and smiled bitterly.\n \"I was just wondering if the secret shop was affected like the chatting channel. I\u0027ll be quick.\"\n \"...The secret shop.\"\n \u0027This\u0027ll probably be my last trip to the secret shop\u0027, he thought and was about to activate the permit, but then... someone grabbed onto his hand. It was none other than Seira.\n She sported a complicated expression, but she was definitely holding onto his hand. She briefly hesitated but soon mustered up her courage.\n \"...May I come with you?\"\n [1] E/N: A thought that was weighing her down mentally.
