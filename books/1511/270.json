Arranging the Stage - 4\u003e\n First, Lee Shin Woo split up the Vampires into three groups and sent them off to three different Anti-Skull bases. He stated that he\u0027d go to the last remaining base, but he was actually planning to send the Pauls to take care of it.\n [Three days. In three days, we\u0027ll regroup here and then... go to the capital.]\n \"B-But Lord Arema, what about the thorn wall...\"\n [Hoo. You\u0027ll see when we get there. ...Prepare yourself for death. For the Emperor!]\n \"F-For the Emperor!\"\n And so, Lee Shin Woo expertly fooled them and sent them away. After that, he cemented his alibi. To be exact, he planned on sneaking into the capital alone as Arema and then barely coming out alive.\n \"Shin Woo, are you really going to go to the capital?\"\n \"Think about it. This is a good opportunity for me to take a look around the capital without them suspecting that it was the Heaven Defying General or the heroes.\"\n Because he\u0027d taken out Arema last, the palace didn\u0027t know what had happened to the Metal God General and his forces.\n He would cause chaos as Arema Steelworker and paint a target on the Vampires\u0027 backs; then, he\u0027d take what he came for and leave.\n \"I need to find out exactly where the train leads (in the capital) and see how it performs; and if I can, I\u0027d like to go into the inner depths of the capital.\"\n \"But do you really have to take such a big risk? Can\u0027t you just take out the Vampires after you kill Seagald and his forces?\"\n \"I may still be able to use the Emperor. But if I was the one to take them out, then the Emperor would know that I\u0027m not the real Arema Steelworker through his Lightning Bind. I want to avoid that. If at all possible, I want the Vampires to fight someone else and die. Well, if it doesn\u0027t work out, I can always call the Pauls and make it look like an accident.\"\n Why wasn\u0027t he discarding the Emperor at this point in time? Jin couldn\u0027t understand why, so she just waited for Lee Shin Woo to continue. Lee Shin Woo grinned and went on to the crux of the matter.\n \"Moreover... It\u0027d be nice if the Emperor kills Seagald, but if he doesn\u0027t, then what happens? When I think about that, I feel like I have to take matters into my own hands.\"\n \"Oh, come on. He\u0027s level 9; you really think he\u0027d lose track of him?\"\n \"Sure, he\u0027s level 9, but all this time, he hadn\u0027t even noticed that Seagald was on the surface. Even I missed him once. Can he not use his full power unless he takes matters into his own hands?\"\n Lee Shin Woo spoke boldly, but he\u0027d actually encountered the Emperor once before and even escaped unscathed, so he wasn\u0027t talking out of his ass. To be brutally honest, he felt like the Lightning Bind element was kind of a wishy-washy ability!\n \"Lightning Bind. An ability that forcefully creates a link between you and another. It allows him to bind his enemies, coerce his subordinates, or even allow him to transfer his consciousness to another, allowing him to see from afar... In many ways, it\u0027s a good ability, but there\u0027s one problem with it: it doesn\u0027t have any inherent combat power.\"\n \"But it seems strong enough to me.\"\n \"If you compare it to Seagald\u0027s Annihilation Flame or my Dark Shadow, then it\u0027s undoubtedly weaker in a pure combat sense. Should I say that it\u0027s unsuited for battle, or that it\u0027s disadvantageous in a real battle?\"\n He had a sudden thought. Perhaps the Emperor had obtained Lightning Bind because he wanted to control the Empire safely from the shadows. Though there weren\u0027t many cases of this, innate elements were largely influenced by one\u0027s karma.\n He had not only exiled both the powerful 2nd prince and the Elementalists underground, but he laid traps in the capital, which were activated by his mana. Plus, he never acted on his own and just commanded his troops to act in his place... He couldn\u0027t help but think that the Magic Emperor was nothing more than a coward!\n \"Still, didn\u0027t you say that he\u0027s the one who created the barrier? Now he knows, there\u0027s no way that he\u0027ll lose Seagald.\"\n \"I\u0027m just preparing for the \u0027what if\u0027. Let\u0027s think about what happens if the Emperor loses Seagald. Then what\u0027ll Seagald do?\"\n \"If I were Seagald, then I\u0027d hide. Isn\u0027t it the basics of the basics to regroup when you\u0027re at a disadvantage?\"\n Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head at Jin\u0027s remark.\n \"When something goes wrong, you have two options: to \u0027regroup\u0027 or to \u0027push forward\u0027. Seagald will probably pick the latter this time since the former requires time.\"\n One can only afford to relax and take care of themselves in a battle if they\u0027re willing to sacrifice time. But...\n \"Think about it. The surface\u0027s Magic Emperor is gunning for him, and the Heaven Defying General is waiting for him underground. Let\u0027s assume that Seagald\u0027s goal is to turn the Undead Emperor, Jissehanu into Anti-Skull and invade the surface. When he realizes that his enemies have multiplied, would he think that buying time is the right decision?\"\n \"Oh. Ohhhh...\"\n Jin didn\u0027t really understand, but she acted like she did and nodded her head. Lee Shin Woo sighed softly and continued.\n \"So, his only choice would be to move forward with his plan. He\u0027d be forced to proceed with his plan, even though he\u0027s surrounded on both sides. He\u0027d then go straight for the capital, to Jissehanu.\"\n \"...You.\"\n \"Yep. At that time, I\u0027ll force the Vampires, the Imperial Army, and Anti-Skull to fight against each other, and... in the midst of all that, I\u0027ll achieve my own goal. Which is to kill Seagald.\"\n In other words, everything he\u0027d done was to kill Seagald.\n He predicted what Seagald\u0027s next move would be and prepared accordingly. Plus, he blocked off all of his retreat paths and forced him into the jaws of death. Eliminating the Anti-Skull bases was part of that strategy. Indeed, it was just a small part of his strategy.\n \"Shin Woo, you... what the hell did you do in the past?\"\n \"I was a businessman.\"\n \"Is \u0027businessman\u0027 some kind of secret code for some sort of hit squad?\"\n \"Hahahaha.\"\n Jin couldn\u0027t understand his entire explanation, but she knew one thing: what happened when you made Lee Shin Woo your enemy. The moment Lee Shin Woo had manipulated the Magic Emperor into pursuing Seagald was the moment that signed Seagald\u0027s death warrant...!\n \"I\u0027m going to scout the capital, simultaneously chip away at the Imperial Army and the Vampires\u0027 forces, and kill Seagald. These are my goals for this operation.\"\n \"So that\u0027s what\u0027ll act as the bridgehead for the final battle, huh...\"\n \"Haha. ...This could actually be the final battle.\"\n \"What are you talking about? You\u0027re not going to the capital to fight the Emperor, are you!?\"\n Jin freaked out and yelled. However, Lee Shin Woo just shook his head, saying that \u0027she got it all wrong\u0027, but didn\u0027t give her a proper explanation. Since he knew that she wouldn\u0027t understand anything he said at the moment.\n \"Eeek...\"\n \"Try to understand. We don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll go according to plan... I\u0027ll explain it to you once things have become a bit more clear.\"\n \"Tch.\"\n Jin was pissed that Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t willing to reveal his plan to even her, his partner, but she didn\u0027t show it, as a skeleton horse wouldn\u0027t look cute no matter how much it pouted. Instead...\n \"If you want to get out of that mess, then you\u0027ll have to train some more. Let\u0027s get back to training.\"\n \"Ugh... Fine...!\"\n Lee Shin Woo thought back to the past few days and dry heaved.\n During their training, he couldn\u0027t tell the difference between heaven and earth, or the difference between himself and Jin. But at the end of their training, he did manage to level up his Assimilation skill to level 8. However, when Jin realized this, she increased the difficulty of their training even further!\n How harsh must that training have been if his Combat Sense skill, which grew at a snail\u0027s pace, leveled up to level 8? It was harder to stay atop Jin\u0027s back than fighting against the enemy!\n He steeled himself, promising himself that he\u0027d get through this training, but that resolve of his was torn to shreds just 20 minutes into their training.\n \"Uaaaaaaaaah!\"\n \"Not yet! Your reaction to that turn was too slow! If you can\u0027t handle the speed, then you won\u0027t be able to fight properly! Tense up your muscles and react!\"\n \"You\u0027ve never even ridden a horse before, so how the hell do you even know that?\"\n \"Next. Accelerate, turn vertically, and ascend!\"\n \"Uaaaaaaaaaah!\"\n Lee Shin Woo was the one who\u0027d given her wings, but she had managed to use those wings to fly in a manner he hadn\u0027t even imagined! Is this what he got for opening Pandora\u0027s Box...!\n \"Uaaaaaaaah.\"\n \"Uooooooooh!\"\n Lee Shin Woo choked down his tears and clung onto Jin\u0027s back. Unfortunately, he didn\u0027t know that him doing that caused Jin to only get worse!\n A little bit later, Lee Shin Woo finished his training with Jin and found Kratia. She was mentally exhausted, so when she looked at him, she only slightly opening her eyes and said quietly.\n \"Shin Woo, who were you fighting?\"\n \"Myself.\"\n \"Just forgive them already. You still have a lot to do, Shin Woo.\"\n \"I want to forgive her too, but Jin won\u0027t forgive me.\"\n \"...\"\n Kratia figured that Jin\u0027s goal was a lot different than what Lee Shin Woo thought, and wondered whether she should tell him or not. But it was true that Lee Shin Woo and Jin\u0027s skills were improving, so she decided to keep her mouth shut.\n \"I\u0027d like to improve the Titan before you go to the capital.\"\n \"It\u0027s not as easy as it sounds.\"\n \"If you bring the perfected Titan Core with you, then there\u0027ll be less for me to worry about.\"\n \"So you were worried about me.\"\n \"We\u0027re partners after all.\"\n In a way, improving the Titan Core would prove to be much more difficult than improving the Huginn\u0027s Eye.\n While he knew what areas of the Huginn\u0027s Eye he wanted to improve and focus on, he was still at the drawing board for the Titan Core; he didn\u0027t know how to combine the Titan Core and the Demon Heart.\n \"It\u0027s simple. We just use it on the outside.\"\n \"Wait, you want to use this precious mana metal to make armor?\"\n \"...We\u0027ll definitely be able to get it to level 9.\"\n \"I can already fight against level 9s. This thing can\u0027t just be any normal level 9. It has to be an ultimate weapon that will allow me to overcome any unforeseen situations.\"\n Lee Shin Woo wanted to imbue the Titan Core with the Demon Heart\u0027s properties. The Demon Heart that was the result of the Evil Eye overlapping again and again. At this point, it was the very definition of being \u0027overlapped\u0027.\n If that ability was transferred to the Titan, then what would happen? He would not only be able to overlap his Dark Flame, but also his other flames; no, if things went well, then he may be able to surpass that and stack all of his abilities together, sublimating them into something new!\n \"Though I honestly feel like it\u0027s just a pipe dream.\"\n \"In any case, let\u0027s begin. We studied the Shining Flame yesterday, right? Let\u0027s study the Dark Flame today.\"\n In order to figure out how to harmonize different elements together in the Titan Core, Lee Shin Woo started with helping Kratia understand how each of these elements worked.\n It was time well spent, as they not only gained a greater understanding of the Demon Heart and the Titan Core, but also increased Kratia\u0027s control over her own element at an exponential rate. No... her skills improved even moreso.\n \"...Shin Woo.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n \"For what?\"\n Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and manifested his Dark Flame. Kratia created an ice crystal, touched the Dark Flame with it, and smiled.\n Not yet. The Emperor still hadn\u0027t contacted him yet.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-270","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
