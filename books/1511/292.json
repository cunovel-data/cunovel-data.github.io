The Final Stage - 2\u003e\n \"Your Majesty, please listen to the people.\"\n \"Mm.\"\n The Light General, Sorura Von Lilaine said so coldly that it felt like he\u0027d fall onto the frozen floor. There was even a curtain within this gloomy, dark room, and the secluded Emperor began to murmur to himself.\n She\u0027d always been cold, but after returning to the surface, she became much more passionate; her voice felt akin to a hot, sharp edge. He knew why. It must be because his loyal subordinate, Arema Steelworker, had died.\n To think these two had been in a relationship. Moreover, he didn\u0027t think Arema would go so far as to sacrifice himself to save her. To be honest, him dying was only beneficial to him, as Arema\u0027s body had gone missing, but he wasn\u0027t going to tell her that.\n \u0027I was suspicious that Seagald had stolen Arema\u0027s body, forcing him to follow him, but... If that were true, then this woman wouldn\u0027t have come back alive. He either died, or he was taken by them.\u0027\n The Emperor pondered, but Sorura cut him off like a sharp blade.\n \"This is the limit. We can\u0027t hold it off anymore. We have to do something. Your Majesty, you are personally needed... Or you need to send all of the remaining 12 Generals and the remainder of the elite troops.\"\n \"Mmmm...\"\n The Emperor groaned quietly. To be honest, the current situation... wasn\u0027t good for him. Originally, the Emperor was going to wait for the undead curse to spread to the surface; when his people discovered the existence of the curse and became antsy, he would only then intervene.\n He never had any intention of dealing with the source of the curse. Once he\u0027d taken care of the curse, he\u0027d then create a barrier. It was inevitable that the undead and their energy would seep out of the barrier once more, so the people would come to rely on him once more.\n \"The situation\u0027s... not good.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s not. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re already aware. Since your eyes see everything on the surface.\"\n \"Lilaine, are you mocking me?\"\n \"Your Majesty, please leave everything to them.\"\n A new voice said. It was a tuxedo-wearing man, with both hands together and on standby near the curtain.\n It was the Spirit Sword General, Kuroin Von Begner. He was the most loyal subject of the Empire and was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders, the Empire\u0027s strongest. He cut his opponents down with his sword, which was hidden in shadow. Thus, he was called the Spirit Sword General and had only become stronger by turning into a Vampire.\n \"I\u0027m referring to the alliance of religious orders, led by the woman who claims to be Kay\u0027s disciple. Force those unsightly fools into your service, and let them and the ignorant people fight against the underground\u0027s undead. It\u0027s a good chance to shut them all up.\"\n \"...Hoo, Kuroin. That\u0027s impossible.\"\n Unfortunately, Kuroin wasn\u0027t very intelligent. Did his overzealous loyalty damage his brain? Though he didn\u0027t particularly like Sorura, he agreed with her nonetheless.\n \"The people are far too discontent. Moreover, they have someone they can rely on. It might work if they and the undead destroyed each other, but if they were to win, then...\"\n The people would wholeheartedly support the religious orders. No, they were already close to doing so. The \u0027limit\u0027 that Sorura had mentioned was referring to this.\n If the Emperor waited any longer, and he left saving the Empire to Izuna and the religious orders, then... it was entirely possible for them to take his people and form an entirely new nation.\n \"This is all because of him (Retadane). If he hadn\u0027t caused such a commotion on the surface, then...!\"\n This must\u0027ve been his goal! Putting the Emperor into a situation where he was forced to intervene or mobilize all of his forces! That\u0027s just how much Seagald had wanted revenge.\n He felt goosebumps, even though Seagald was a lower level than him. It felt as though there was always a sword beneath his neck. Even now, the Emperor felt uneasy, as he didn\u0027t know when Seagald would come for him.\n \"If I go, then... It would be the perfect spot to assassinate me.\"\n \"Even so, we have no other option. Your Majesty, you just told us yourself that you had to intervene.\"\n \"Keuuuum.\"\n The Emperor toiled over his choices. Honestly, he\u0027d rather stay here and hide. With double or even triple the soldiers stationed to protect him!\n However, that was an unattainable dream. \u0027If\u0027, \u0027By some chance\u0027. Those two hypotheticals were just wishful thinking.\n \"Seagald Von Retadane. He\u0027s probably still alive.\"\n \"I, too, would like to kill him right away. He can\u0027t hide forever. But we can\u0027t catch him from in here. We have to go out to do so. And we have to go out to kill him as well.\"\n \"...\"\n Sorura remarked, as if ignoring the Emperor\u0027s opinions, yet the Emperor couldn\u0027t bring himself to say anything. Not only was it the truth, but she was also the last remaining light magician in the Empire.\n She was crucial to stopping Seagald. She, too, knew this fact all too well.\n \"Your Majesty, you don\u0027t have to worry about a weakling like him.\"\n \"...\"\n Jirold Von Enard anguished once more. He knew his hand had been forced. The Emperor thought about how he could get what he wanted without being coerced. Ultimately, he came to a simple conclusion.\n \"You go, Kuroin. Kuroin Von Begner.\"\n It was best to not move exactly as your enemy wished. That policy had always kept the Emperor alive time and time again.\n \"Your Majesty?\"\n \"You\u0027ll be my stand-in. I can\u0027t just leave here. So I\u0027ll leave everything to you. Take the rest of the 12 Generals with you, besides the Light General, and all the elite troops as well. You must perform better than Izuna and her forces.\"\n For a second, the Emperor\u0027s loyal clansman, Kuroin Von Begner couldn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. But he wasn\u0027t hearing things. The Emperor had opened the curtain and stared at him seriously. He was confused, but he quickly got on one knee and bowed to him in spite of this.\n \"I-I understand. I will break Seagald Von Retadane and Jissehanu, and bring them to you no matter what.\"\n \"You won\u0027t be able to beat Jissehanu. However, he won\u0027t likely be on the front lines. Kill Seagald Von Retadane. He\u0027s the one keeping the underground afloat, so if you kill him, then Jissehanu will retreat back underground.\"\n \"...Understood!\"\n Jirold placed his hand atop Kuroin Von Begner\u0027s shoulder. The Emperor\u0027s Lightning Bind flowed from his hand into Kuroin\u0027s body, further strengthening him. This act served two purposes: helping him, as well as forcing his loyalty and preventing insubordination.\n \"Sorura Von Lilaine.\"\n \"Yes, Your Majesty?\"\n The Light General looked at the Emperor with unconcealed contempt, yet the Emperor shamelessly gave her an order regardless.\n \"You will replace Kuroin as my protector. If, and I mean if, Seagald comes for me during the chaos of the battle, then the only one who can detect him early enough and respond is a light user.\"\n \"...Are you forcing me to stay behind?\"\n \"I am essential to the survival of the Empire. If any harm befalls me, then you won\u0027t be safe either.\"\n Sorura gritted her teeth and shook. The Emperor acknowledged her anger but wasn\u0027t going to try to understand it.\n \"Moreover, there\u0027s a high chance that Seagald comes for me. Light General, if you truly want revenge on him, then it\u0027s best that you stay by my side.\"\n \"Do you really think he can sneak in when you have so many magic traps set up...?\"\n \"He went around the Empire eluding even my sight. Do you really think he can\u0027t do something more?\"\n The sound of her teeth grinding could be heard once more. However, the Emperor trusted that she, as one of his clansmen, as well as one affected by Lightning Bind, wouldn\u0027t be able to refuse his command!\n \"...I understand. I will do as you say. You disgust me though, so I\u0027ll stay this far away from you.\"\n \"Light General, it\u0027s an honor that the Emperor requires your services, yet you dare to...\"\n \"Get lost already.\"\n \"...Ugh!\"\n In response to her rage, her body radiated light mana; Kuroin wouldn\u0027t dare approach her and just shrunk back.\n Though he\u0027d been strengthened by the Emperor, it didn\u0027t matter. It might be different for the Emperor himself, but Kuroin had no way of overcoming the Light General\u0027s light. Sorura snorted and said.\n \"You\u0027re my stand-in too. Kill all the undead. Make sure they can never tread upon our soil ever again.\"\n \"...Hmph, I like the sound of that. Then, Your Majesty, I\u0027ll come back after fulfilling your orders.\"\n \"My loyal friend... if you succeed, then I promise to give you a suitable reward.\"\n \"It\u0027s an honor!\"\n The Spirit Sword General deeply bowed his head, paid his respects to the Emperor once more, and quietly left. The Emperor merely stared at the recently emptied space, but soon closed his eyes and turned his attention to the shaking Sorura.\n \"I\u0027ll give you a chance to get your revenge. I promise you.\"\n \"I would\u0027ve liked it better if that chance... came quicker.\"\n Sorura said hatefully and seething with rage, and then turned around. The Emperor\u0027s gaze was automatically fixed onto her back.\n Her elegantly curved body, having no signs of age, her captivating, flowing hair, and her scent, all of which remained unchanged even after becoming a Vampire, aroused him. However, he wasn\u0027t stupid enough to go after a woman who\u0027d just lost her lover and was filled with malice. Yes, a rose had thorns, but these thorns were filled with poison.\n \"Where are you going?\"\n \"I was given an unexpected mission, so I have to go and prepare. ...Surely you can stay here by yourself for a short while?\"\n \"Of course I can. Return after you\u0027ve prepared yourself. 2 hours should be enough, right?\"\n \"Hmph.\"\n She snorted, as if she could see right through him, and left. He wanted to force her onto her knees with his Lightning Bind oh so badly, but for some reason, it didn\u0027t work on her. Perhaps it was due to her element. There were so many facets of her that were displeasing to him.\n \u0027I should dispose of her once Retadane\u0027s been dealt with. I can just nurture another light user.\u0027\n Sorura, who\u0027d left the Emperor\u0027s dark room, dusted her body off as if something dirty had gotten onto her. She then rushed over to her residence. Within her bedroom, which only she could enter, a single small bird awaited her.\n [How did it go?]\n No, it was a golem in the shape of a bird. Moreover, a young woman\u0027s voice came from the golem!\n Sorura, as if she\u0027d done this a few times already, walked over to the bird, or Rem, and... smiled elatedly and said.\n \"The Emperor\u0027s doing exactly as you said he would. I\u0027m ready... to open the gate whenever.\"\n [That\u0027s perfect. We\u0027ll take care of the rest.]\n \"I\u0027ll leave the rest to you. ...Hero Izuna.\"\n [Of course.]\n Her voice, coming from the golem, was a bit delicate, but it was unmistakably the vigorous voice of a young woman.\n [Since I\u0027m fighting for the one I love as well.]\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-292","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
