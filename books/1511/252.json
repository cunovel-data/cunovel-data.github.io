Uooooh!\"\n \"Oh, granny\u0027s got a nice voice!\"\n He was really worried about Prince and Kratia too, but with Jin and Arema fighting against the Annihilation Flame Sword God, he should have enough time. Moreover, Kratia had harmonized with her orb, temporarily boosting her abilities above their limit, so she wouldn\u0027t die, regardless of how the situation progressed.\n \"Uuuuaaaaaaah!\"\n \u0027I have to focus on saving this old lady now.\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo observed the disparate energy deep within her and his expression soured. He\u0027d learned three innate elements, so he\u0027d thought it would be easy to save her, but things were a lot different from what he\u0027d expected.\n \"Seagald, you bastard.\"\n Seagald hadn\u0027t killed his sister just because he was a crazy bastard.\n He inflicted a grievous injury onto Seira and had simultaneously infused Annihilation Flame into her. The Annihilation Flame and the undead curse, which would transform one into the undead depending on how close they were to death, had overlapped and had become something else entirely. And that was...\n \u0027Anti-Skull...?\u0027\n That\u0027s right. He thought he\u0027d felt this energy before, but it was similar to Seagald Von Retadane\u0027s mana. In other words, this was a ceremony that turned someone into a member of Anti-Skull. Seagald had attempted to kill his sister and induct her into Anti-Skull!\n He said something about \u0027losing her way\u0027 or that he\u0027d \u0027show her the right path\u0027, but how could Anti-Skull be the right path!? He was willing to go so far as to kill his own little sister to ensure that she was on his side!?\n \u0027As I thought, all these undead bastards are crazy! ...But wait a sec.\u0027\n But as the different energies interfered with each other, Lee Shin Woo came to another realization. The Annihilation Flame element had eliminated a portion of the undead curse\u0027s mana and had changed its inherent properties, creating something entirely new... It was similar to his Pauls\u0027 mana. He felt as though he was struck by lightning when he came to a realization.\n \u0027Was the reason they came into contact with the Pauls to perfect the Anti-Skull experiment...? So I\u0027m the reason Anti-Skull was perfected?\u0027\n His Pauls had told him that they\u0027d met with Seagald, yet they had left unscathed. If that\u0027s the case, then why did they come into contact with Pauls that weren\u0027t under the direct command of the Heaven Defying General? It made sense if they were used as data to perfect the Anti-Skull test.\n If that\u0027s the case, then was the reason Seagald chose now to act because he\u0027d gotten inspiration from the way Lee Shin Woo created the Pauls and managed to complete the Anti-Skull test? So he\u0027d led his own little sister to Bayran, and had even led the other forces here to cause chaos!\n \"Guuuuu. Huaaaaaaah!\"\n \"If you were smart enough to make that call, then you should\u0027ve just told your little sister how to live. You may have copied my methods, but at the end of the day, you\u0027re still undead...!\"\n Once he understood Seira\u0027s condition, he attempted to reverse her condition with each of his innate elements one-by-one.\n He tried Dark Shadow first. It would\u0027ve been easy if he could sever cause-and-effect, reversing her death, but... He\u0027d somewhat expected this himself, but he wasn\u0027t at the level where he could do that yet. It was similar to bringing a dead person back to life. If he could do this, then he would\u0027ve given Jin a human body already.\n He tried his Dark Flame next. He wanted to \u0027steal\u0027 the curse that ate away at her, but because of what Seagald had done, her mana, the undead curse, and Seagald\u0027s Annihilation Flame element were mixing together and becoming something else entirely. Unless he stole all of her mana, there was nothing he could do.\n If he were to steal all of her mana, she would vanish without a trace. The Shining Flame was also out of the question using the same logic.\n \u0027What about light? Eh, this won\u0027t work either. Seagald\u0027s Annihilation Flame element devoured Seira\u0027s light and actually became stronger. He prepared this specifically for Seira... Though my darkness should work.\u0027\n So long as the curse was, at its core, based on the darkness element, it had no choice but to be controlled by it. Lee Shin Woo had already achieved peak darkness mastery, and if he linked himself with Seira\u0027s mana, which filled her body to the brim and was bursting, then he could cause her mana to change in a completely different direction!\n ...But it would still change her into an undead. He would stop her from becoming a part of Anti-Skull, but would in-turn turn her into an undead like the Pauls.\n \u0027Then... What other options do I have? Sacrifice?\u0027\n In the past, when he\u0027d saved Ye Jin Jin, he\u0027d gained a skill called Sacrifice due to his karma. It was a skill that allowed him to kill himself to save someone on the brink of death.\n He\u0027d accumulated 164 lives as if they were mileage, so he decided to test out the skill. But then...\n [The target is changing due to a status ailment. Thus, you cannot target them with this skill.]\n \"How can you call this a status ailment!? You said I could save someone on the brink of death! She\u0027s clearly dying! So does it only work when they\u0027re dying from something physical!? A case like that\u0027d be hard to find. What a shitty skill!\"\n \"Uuuaaah!\"\n As expected of Anti-Skull\u0027s leader. Lee Shin Woo had mastered several abilities, yet even he was hard-pressed to deal with this.\n Then again, it was because Seagald was this skilled that he was able to free the undead from the curse and turn them into Anti-Skull in the first place! He was so skilled that it pissed Lee Shin Woo off!\n \u0027...Alright. Let\u0027s give up on saving her. Granny, you lived a long life.\u0027\n He boldly decided to give up on her. Plus, he didn\u0027t really cherish her enough to risk his life to save her. He just thought that it\u0027d be better to save her. But because it wouldn\u0027t work, he had to give up on it!\n But if he just left her like this, she would definitely become a powerful ally to Seagald in the future (for a level 8, she didn\u0027t seem like much, but she might get stronger as an undead), so rather than let that happen, it would be better to kill her here and now.\n And if it were possible, then...\n \"Sseup. What should I do with you...\"\n \"Uuuaaaah.\"\n Even now, Seira was doing her best to resist the transformation, but her screams were getting louder and louder. The Annihilation Flame element, which was attempting to remake her, the undead curse, which had undergone a special evolution that made it more offensive, and her own mana, which wasn\u0027t capable of mounting a proper resistance and was being influenced by the two...\n \u0027Why did he have to pierce her heart, not only infusing his Annihilation Flame element into her, but also contaminating all of her veins and arteries. ...This bastard. He even anticipated my intervention.\u0027\n Moreover, Seira was the hero that had operated in the Underground Empire the longest, so she had accumulated the most of the undead curse within her body. All those factors worked together to cause the worst possible outcome.\n In any case, she wouldn\u0027t last long. Her body wouldn\u0027t survive, so he had to make a decision fast. ...In the end, he only really had one option.\n \u0027I guess I have no choice. I have to do it.\u0027\n \"Geuk. Gureureureuuuuu...!\"\n Lee Shin Woo extended his hand with a truly regretful expression and placed it upon her chest wound. His hand emitted a deep darkness and was absorbed into her wound; at the same time, he took hold of her seizing body.\n Eventually, the darkness spread, taking hold over their surroundings as well! Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t aware of this, but time slowed within this space.\n \"Alright. Let\u0027s talk first. It won\u0027t be too late to make a decision afterwards.\"\n Because of the shock to her mind and body, it was impossible to hold a proper conversation with her. However, if he were to connect them together with his darkness element, then he would be able to talk to her mentally, like how he talked to Jin or his subordinates.\n [Undead! Get away from me this instant!]\n He succeeded in his attempt. She didn\u0027t scream; rather, he could feel her intent. Although it wasn\u0027t very kind to him.\n [You\u0027re no longer alive, either. You\u0027ll become an undead soon. You\u0027ll be together with your older brother. Aren\u0027t you happy?]\n [I don\u0027t want to... I don\u0027t want to! I don\u0027t want to become an undead!]\n Why was it that he decided to tease someone endlessly whenever he could? Because of his unnecessary jab, Seira\u0027s seizures intensified noticeably!\n [I\u0027d rather die than become an undead! Kill me! I said kill me!]\n [Then who\u0027ll save the Empire? You were always preaching about God or what not; are you going to abandon your calling as a hero?]\n [Lee Shin Woo will... He\u0027ll save the Empire.]\n Lee Shin Woo hesitated. He hadn\u0027t even imagined that she\u0027d bring him up. Is it because she didn\u0027t need to hesitate and could just speak her mind? Like always, she continued with a lengthy speech.\n [I regret not being able to take down the Emperor and my older brother with my own hands, but he should be able to stop them.]\n [He\u0027s still only level 8.]\n [He\u0027s different from me, and the other heroes. Unlike me, who indiscriminately hates the undead due to the undead curse, he considers even the undead as chess pieces. He\u0027ll do everything in his power to completely destroy the Underground Empire...!]\n No way. She\u0027d unexpectedly assessed him perfectly!? Lee Shin Woo had no intention of dating her or something as frivolous as that, but he didn\u0027t think she had such a favorable opinion of him!\n [An undead\u0027s existence is wrong. And the Underground Empire is even worse, as they\u0027re attempting to use their strength to take over the surface as well. It was my fate to stop them from leaving the underground, but... It\u0027s fine now since Lee Shin Woo is there. So just kill me, Undead.]\n [It seems like you know a part of the truth. If you know why they\u0027re trying to invade the surface, then why didn\u0027t you join them?]\n [I hate the surface too, but...!]\n [Ooh, as I thought.]\n Lee Shin Woo was actually having a lot of fun right now. Seira, who had hidden all of her feelings before, was pouring her heart and soul out to Lee Shin Woo. He just regretted that he didn\u0027t have a bowl of popcorn with him.\n [I hate them. The Emperor who banished us underground and the God who abandoned us! But if, in the process of escaping to the surface, it means that we have to hurt innocent people on the surface and he has to put his little sister\u0027s close friend and his fiance into such a miserable state, then... I\u0027d rather bury the Empire and its empty greed, so that humanity can live on!] \n [Fiance...? Ah, the princess was Seagald\u0027s fiance, huh. I understand.]\n Lee Shin Woo decided to reflect on his statement of Seira being an insane woman. She was definitely insane, but she was still a hero who had her own thoughts and feelings. ...Was there some hope here?\n [If that\u0027s the case, then you don\u0027t hate the undead. You hate the undead curse, and the Undead Emperor\u0027s forces, who seek to invade the surface. Why do you hate even me, who is against them and seeks to destroy the undead curse? Think calmly. Can\u0027t we become friends?]\n [The undead curse... Ah, now that I\u0027ve become neither dead nor alive, I can say this clearly. ...That I can never join hands with the undead!]\n [Seriously, why not?]\n Seira seized once more. Her own mana, light, the undead curse, and the Annihilation Flame element mixed together, causing a reaction between them and blazed violently. If Lee Shin Woo\u0027s darkness element hadn\u0027t blended into it and hadn\u0027t kept her stable, then she would\u0027ve already turned into a member of Anti-Skull.\n [There are no undead free of the undead curse! Even my older brother, who searched for a way to resist it for dozens of years, stabbed my chest! My older brother, who could wield the light better than anyone else, was unable to avoid the effects of the curse, so no one can escape its effects! We have to bury everything, so that nothing comes out. That\u0027s the only way the world can continue on!]\n [Is that really what you think?]\n [Yes! So now, please... If you\u0027re truly cooperating with Lee Shin Woo, then... If you\u0027re even acting as though you are, then just kill me! I said, kill me!]\n [Unfortunately...]\n Lee Shin Woo unleashed even more darkness, forcing a connection between them, and for the first time, the Annihilation Flame element began to wane. The undead curse, which had mutated and was eating away at her, instantaneously lost its strength, and Seira\u0027s own light mana and Lee Shin Woo\u0027s darkness mixed together and became murky.\n This was the start of their \u0027contract\u0027.\n [I can\u0027t just let you go like this, Senior.]\n [What... L-Lee Shin Woo?]\n It hadn\u0027t lasted very long, but their face-to-face talk had at least come to an end.\n Lee Shin Woo made his decision. He would make this troublesome granny into his ally... Into an undead.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-252","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
