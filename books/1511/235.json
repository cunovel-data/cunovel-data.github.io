Magic has increased by 100.]\\n\\n [Light is one of the two great elements that govern the world. It is the power that signals the beginning, accelerates the growth and development of all creation, and is the power that allows you to reach an unreachable domain. Light dispels the darkness and possesses the power of severing relationships.]\\n\\n [It is incredibly difficult to grasp the nature of the light element, and is not an element easily wielded. This power, which can be acquired only by severing everything, is often referred to as divine power by priests. As true divinity is something only gods can wield, the light element is not true divinity.]\\n\\n \"Ah, so this is how I get the light element, huh.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo perused the message a few times and was deeply moved. He hadn\u0027t shown any signs, but he\u0027d been trying very hard to obtain the light element.\\n\\n He\u0027d used his Bone Winged Serpent staff to reverse darkness into light, studied his Light Resistance, recollected Seira Von Retadane\u0027s powerful light and had tried to copy the mana pattern she\u0027d used, to no avail. To put it bluntly, it wouldn\u0027t be an exaggeration to say that he\u0027d dumped all his free time into acquiring the light element.\\n\\n \"The fact that I did all that, but still didn\u0027t get it must mean that I don\u0027t have much affinity with the light element.\"\\n\\n That was only natural. The Light element wasn\u0027t normally obtainable by the undead, so it made sense that his compatibility with the element was at an all time low. Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t aware of this, but whenever the Garuda used the light element or its Shining Flame, which was mixed with the light element, it took damage, as it had degenerated into an undead.\\n\\n Regardless, the Garuda was able to wield the high rank light element with ease, and as a result of absorbing its bone (he still had his share, the Garuda\u0027s Sphenoid Bone, but in the process of reinforcing Jin with the Wing Bone, the Sphenoid Bone had awakened as well), he was able to acquire the High Rank Light element as well.\\n\\n If God hadn\u0027t bestowed him with Light Resistance, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t have been able to obtain the light element. Jin was in the same boat.\\n\\n \u0027Dark Flame is nice and all, but Bone Reinforcement\u0027s the best for permanent growth.\u0027\\n\\n Rather than researching the element by himself, it was a far more effective approach to absorb a divine bird\u0027s bone, which could wield the light element at an already high level.\\n\\n Of course, he kept in mind that there was a chance that he wouldn\u0027t obtain the light element from Bone Reinforcement either, but he got lucky. Since he\u0027d been yearning for the light element ever since he\u0027d acquired the darkness element, he felt like he\u0027d just completed a high rank quest.\\n\\n \u0027It makes sense that I got the element, but it\u0027s really surprising that Jin did as well. It might\u0027ve been the best time for her to level up. If not, maybe my Joker karma affected her?\u0027\\n\\n Normally, humans (all of mankind, excluding monsters) couldn\u0027t wield the elements themselves. Even if they could, it would be the result of processing natural mana, or through a special skill or spell. Which meant that they would have to go one step higher from the middle. However, Jin had acquired the light element regardless!\\n\\n There were several reasons as to why she did. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Joker karma could\u0027ve affected her, or perhaps Jin gained a deeper understanding of magic and her limits were released as she leveled up. If not, then perhaps Jin was considered a monster, rather than a human being now.\\n\\n He had one more idea, but if he said it, Jin would definitely hit him, so he just thought about it. Since Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t be able to look at Jin for a while!\\n\\n \u0027Now that I think about it, the Emperor used a high rank element with ease. Maybe the difference between man and monster becomes meaningless when one passes level 8.\u0027\\n\\n When he had reached level 8, Lee Shin Woo had reached the peak of the darkness element. And because of his innate skills, he could \u0027define\u0027 himself however he wished, so it felt like he was right.\\n\\n He accepted it and nodded his head. Lee Shin Woo looked at Jin, who was flying with her steel-covered wings and tried using his light element again. It had been so hard getting it, yet once he did, it was so simple to use.\\n\\n But he could already control cause and effect through his Shining Flame and other innate skills, so Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t feel that the light element, which \u0027severed relationships\u0027, was very appealing to him.\\n\\n \"Though I suppose it\u0027s useful in healing, growth and development, or attacking at an incredibly fast speed.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo glimpsed to the side again. Jin, who\u0027d become accustomed to flying with only her wings, used light mana as an auxiliary propulsion system... she was trying to fly even faster with those \u0027boosters\u0027 of hers and managed to top her previous max speed.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t able to control her speed 100%, so she collided with objects here and there. He decided to ignore the fact that her doing so was causing the underground cave to reach its limit.\\n\\n \"Uaaaaah! It\u0027s too fasssssst!\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, Jin. I can\u0027t understand you at all.\"\\n\\n Befitting the skill God had bestowed upon her, Jin had truly become a Child of Light. She could reach light speed now! He was so jealous! But it wasn\u0027t in his character to just stay jealous.\\n\\n \"Yeah. There should be several innate elements that are derived from the light element.\"\\n\\n After all, Lee Shin Woo possessed the Beginner Shining Flame already. Of course, this was created from the divine bird\u0027s karma, so Lee Shin Woo could only advance it to the intermediate level.\\n\\n However, Lee Shin Woo knew that there had to be a high rank derivative of the light element or even a fusion innate element. The message that described the light element had been extremely suspicious. It would allow him to reach an unreachable domain... This must not be referring to learning the light element itself, but what lays beyond it!\\n\\n \u0027Now that I think about it, when I was first affected by the light element, my Holy Resistance reacted, resulting in the creation of Light Resistance. Which means...\u0027\\n\\n Perhaps the holy element was an innate element that was derived from the light element...? No, it might even be a fusion element with the darkness element. With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo felt his heart pound (he was still in his human form).\\n\\n But he couldn\u0027t try it out right now. Just because he knew that he could combine the two elements and create an innate element didn\u0027t mean that he could just be like \u0027how about I give it a go?\u0027 and combine them so easily.\\n\\n Innate elements required, above all, karma that suited them. The resulting change in the element would follow. So, Lee Shin Woo was merely at the starting line now.\\n\\n \"If for no other reason...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo raised the remaining sphenoid bone. It was fine if he didn\u0027t get much from it. If the Shining Flame was reinforced, then... that would be fine.\\n\\n [Absorbing the Lv9 Garuda\u0027s Sphenoid Bone. Strength and Health have increased by 130, Agility by 200, and Magic by 250. The High Rank Light element has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 60. The Beginner Shining Flame element has become Lv5 and Magic has increased by 20. The Soul Seeing Eyes skill has become Lv5 and all stats have increased by 10. The Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills have become Lv8, and Magic has increased by 40. You have learned the special passive skill, Manatization. Health and Magic has increased by 20.]\\n\\n ...He thought, but he gained something else entirely. Manatization. Lee Shin Woo had a feeling as to what it was when he obtained the skill.\\n\\n When he thought back to the Garuda\u0027s body, he knew the answer. It had made half its body into mana. That ability had become a skill.\\n\\n \u0027A level 9 indeed. An unimaginable skill just pops up out of nowhere.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo closed his eyes and thought. He was already somewhat capable of turning his body into mana. As a result of reaching the peak of the darkness element, he could temporarily turn his body into darkness.\\n\\n However, this skill, Manatization, was similar but also fundamentally different.\\n\\n \u0027This skill is... permanent.\u0027\\n\\n The Garuda was almost half spirit. It had attempted to transcend the limitations of its physical body and soul by turning its body into mana.\\n\\n In lieu of that though, the Manatization skill would transform his body into mana. To be more specific, it would replace all his stats: Strength, Agility, and Health, etc. with Magic.\\n\\n Could he call it artificially becoming a spirit? Was it a natural development for him... No, he supposed it was only one of the many possibilities of maximum growth for one who understands the principle behind magic.\\n\\n \u0027But this skill... There are a lot of things I\u0027m concerned about.\u0027\\n\\n Of course, turning his body into mana wasn\u0027t without its weaknesses. The spirits\u0027 physical strength wasn\u0027t very good.\\n\\n There was no going back once he decided to change his body into mana, and training the Manatization skill meant that he would be picking one of the two roads in front of him, without the ability to go back.\\n\\n ...For everyone besides Lee Shin Woo that is.\\n\\n \"I gained quite the ability here.\"\\n\\n Cold sweat trailed down his back. He could already \u0027define\u0027 his existence however he wished, and change it whenever he needed to!\\n\\n In other words, even if he trains the Manatization skill and changes all his body into mana, he could immediately change his body back whenever he wanted! To be blunter, he, who had focused most of his stats in Magic, had become able to redistribute his stats at will!\\n\\n \"...Training Manatization might be better than training to get the holy element.\"\\n\\n Even he thought this was a cheat skill. Combining his ability as a Joker and the Manatization skill was far too dangerous!\\n\\n But that\u0027s precisely why he was drawn to it. If Lee Shin Woo switched between his mana body (in other words, an evil spirit) and his physical body, then he could respond with the appropriate form during battle. Perhaps that was, in its own way, a \u0027perfect form\u0027...\\n\\n \"Moreover, maybe I can solve my skill issue with this.\"\\n\\n Changing his body into mana meant that he would be changing his bones into mana as well.\\n\\n If he could cause a fundamental change in his bones by training his Manatization, then wouldn\u0027t it fundamentally change his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory? Perhaps he could raise them to an even higher level!\\n\\n This was only speculation for now, but Lee Shin Woo realized that his Manatization was the key to evolving his skills. if he were to train this skill, which changed everything he was into mana, then he would ultimately transcend matter and magic!\\n\\n \"Lord Garuda, thank you so much. If I get to level 10, then it\u0027s all because of you!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo genuinely thanked the dead Garuda. If it knew, it would probably be really pissed, but fortunately, there weren\u0027t any problems on that front, since its soul had been burnt away as well.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-235","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
