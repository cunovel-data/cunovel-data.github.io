Hunting Hero - 1\u003e He stared intensely, but there really weren\u0027t any monsters at the entrance, not even one. Lee Shin Woo thought the Zombie Hero, who went into the dungeon before him, had probably cleared all the monsters. But he didn\u0027t know what monsters it had fought for its body to have become such a mess. \"Jjik, Jjijik\" \"Ah, finally.\" He had been absent-mindedly running through the dungeon, without the appearance of a single monster for 10 minutes, and finally met a monster after he had traversed what he felt was halfway through the dungeon. If you took a common house rat from Earth and made it five times bigger, how disgusting and big would those rats be! Then, he remembered that the dungeon\u0027s name was the rural rat nest. \"Jjiiiiiiiiiiiiik!\" \"Heup...\" From the outside, they looked weaker than the Skeleton Soldiers, but he didn\u0027t know what kind of abilities the monsters of this world were hiding! Lee Shin Woo exerted strength into his hand gripping the sword and cautiously took a step forward. At that moment, the Rural Rat exposed its brutally shining front teeth and lunged at him! Lee Shin Woo instinctually took a defensive stance and pointed his blade at his enemy. It was such a solid stance that if a skeleton who knew Weapon Defense saw his form, it would\u0027ve been satisfied with it. [You have defeated a Lv1 Rural Rat.] [You have received 5 Perium.] [You have acquired a Rural Rat\u0027s rib bone.] \"...\" It was embarrassing to say that it was a single strike. He had exerted strength into his sword and positioned it so that it would hold back the rat\u0027s charge, but the rat had charged into his sword by itself and died. Of course, it was also due to the fact that it was a fine sword, but just by looking at the amount of Perium dropped, he came to an obvious conclusion. The Rural Rat was ridiculously weak, even compared to the Skeleton Soldiers! His tension loosened tiredly, and he felt despondent. Despite that, he instinctually picked up its rib bone and used his Bone Reinforcement. [Would you like to use the Rural Rat\u0027s rib bone to strengthen your own bones? You can reinforce your rib bones.] \"Reinforce.\" [Your rib bones have been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Rural Rat\u0027s memories and experiences.] [Jjik! Jjijijik, Jjiiiik! - Rural Rat] Lee Shin Woo momentarily stood there and felt conflicted. What would be the point of exploring this dungeon now...? However, he soon got a hold of himself and hit his own cheek. An unpleasant sound rang out at the clash of bones. \"If I can increase my stats by just one from these guys\u0027 bones, then it would still probably be best that I procure them all. Yeah, now that I\u0027ve made up my mind, I\u0027ll clear out all the dungeons nearby.\" It\u0027d be troublesome if he got arrogant just because he got a little stronger. The fact that he could grow this much despite not knowing magic or how to fight was all because of Bone Reinforcement! He soon decided to calmly and orderly proceed and stepped deeper into the dungeon. It seems that his senior hero hadn\u0027t stepped foot from this point onwards as more and more rats gradually popped out. Of course, he cleaned them up in a single strike, but he gradually had to put more force into his sword, so it seemed as though the rats\u0027 health was gradually getting higher. [You have reinforced your ribs. Your health has increased by 1. Proficiency in the Beginner Stealth skill has increased by 3%.] [The Beginner Stealth skill has become Lv3.] [Jjijijijik, jjiiik? - Rural rat] Was it because he became level 2? That\u0027s why the level 1 Rural Rat bones would barely increase his stats... However, just like how larvae are good at rolling, the Rural Rat species\u0027 proficiency in the Stealth skill wasn\u0027t bad. Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized. All monsters have their own worth! \u0027I can only lighten my footsteps a little bit for now, but if I develop this skill, it should be really helpful when I need to run away from the battlefield.\u0027 In other words, it would be best to use it in tandem with the Avenger skill. By killing the seemingly unimpressive rats, he had gained a skill with such amazing growth potential, so if he turned back after his first rat kill, he would\u0027ve been really disappointed. \"Jjijik... Jjiiiiiiik!\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m trespassing, so why don\u0027t you try screaming a little louder?\" \"Jjiiiiiiik!\" Rats appeared everywhere and after taking care of them without much difficulty, he greedily absorbed their bones. After walking for a while, Lee Shin Woo realized that the path was getting increasingly narrow. Conversely, there were more and more rats pouring out, and stirring about, making it difficult for him. \"Jjiiiik!\" \"Jjijijijik!\" \"Yes, yes.\" He was well aware of how this dungeon roughly intended to instill the trespasser with terror, but unfortunately, he was able to cut down all the rats that crossed paths with his sword. Lee Shin Woo felt like the path was becoming just a tad bit stuffy. Moreover, as he traversed deeper into the dungeon, his body was becoming more accustomed to the Bursting Thunder skill, so he was actually thankful if they changed up the conditions or the environment. With that in mind, he swung his sword, tip facing the ground, upward, and the Bone of Thunder Lasting surged up from the ground to the sky like lightning, brutally slicing through all the rats in the entire area. \"Jjiiik! (No!)\" \"Jjik!! (It\u0027s in front...!)\" The Rural Rats\u0027 death rattles filled the narrow passage. While he reinforced his bones with theirs, he had finally mastered their language, and he was naturally able to interpret the meaning behind their cries; he only felt a bit uncomfortable. Their desperate behavior only confirmed that there was something deeper within, but he had absolutely no idea what it was. If it was a similar environment to the dungeons he had heard about in webnovels or manhwa, then there should be a boss within but... \u0027They\u0027re showing way too much loyalty for it to be just a simple boss.\u0027 The overly dense population of rats in this area were fully showing their loyalty. Whenever he swung his sword, the rats filling the passage would all die by themselves, so around now, it was no longer skill training, but arm swinging training instead. Ultimately, he had no choice but to unleash a different skill. When it was overflowing with a mob of Rural Rats, he had the perfect \u0027escape from crisis\u0027 skill to deal with them. \"Tsk... Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!\" [Using Shriek of the Dead. The enemies in the entire area have fallen into a frenzied state.] [The Beginner Shriek of the Dead skill has become Lv3.] \"Jjik, Jjijik!?\" \"Jjiiiiiiik!\" The effect was astounding! The moment the Rural Rats, who had all rushed at him with the intent to kill, heard the shriek, they were startled, and soon, fought in a fratricidal war! When he saw the dirty blood and flesh splatter everywhere, Lee Shin Woo suddenly trembled. \u0027This skill really isn\u0027t good for my mental health. However, if I train it, it might become more amazing than any other skill...\u0027 He suddenly realized that Shriek of the Dead was obviously more effective the more enemies it targeted. How many enemies had been targeted for the skill to level up immediately!? \"Jjik...\" \"Jjijik, Jjik...\" \"Well done. Now, rest in peace.\" He waited for the commotion to calm down before he cleaned up the horrific area. After that, he gathered the rib bones without resting and inspected himself while using Bone Reinforcement. Despite spending close to a whole day concentrating all his efforts into killing rats and absorbing their bones, his health had only risen by 5; but in its stead, his Beginner Stealth had become level 4. Although he could definitely see himself walking, his movements were light, like the movements of a rat, though it was strange to even himself. \"I\u0027ve gotten a bit more familiar with Bursting Thunder, as well as my body and the sword... Good.\" Since the skill was so amazing, he felt like he couldn\u0027t even unleash a quarter of the power within Bursting Thunder, but he could roughly imitate the appearance of the technique. For some reason, after swinging his sword in the air a few times, he nodded his head and looked ahead. There was clearly a disparate iron gate located there. \u0027I feel mana coming from the gate itself. Since the mana within can\u0027t come out, does it have the ability to imprison whatever\u0027s inside so that it can\u0027t come out? He didn\u0027t have any idea how the dungeon was created, but when he looked at the gate, he thought that perhaps the dungeons were originally set up by God to protect humans from the monsters. Of course, now that all the humans who were supposed to be protected by the dungeons had become undead, they probably don\u0027t have much meaning anymore but... He laughed bitterly and placed his hand on the gate. At that moment, a message appeared in front of him. [Once you enter the boss room, you cannot exit until either you die, or the boss dies. Will you still enter?] \"Yeah.\" He thought that perhaps the secret shop sold an item related to escaping the dungeon, but he thought he didn\u0027t need it right now. He wasn\u0027t being arrogant; this resulted from his extremely calm decision. [Lv2 Rural Rat Queen] [Lv2 Ratman] The instant he entered the boss room, the first thing he saw were those two entities. Are the bosses normally a level higher than the dungeon? He couldn\u0027t tell yet. A rat that was incomparable in size to the normal Rural Rats; the Rat Queen was stuck in a corner of the vast clearing, and the one standing in front of it was... Yeah, the rat standing on two feet was the Ratman. It was a rat commonly called a Were-Rat. Compared to mere Rural Rats, he felt a qualitatively different strength coming from it. \"Kihik... Kihiiiiiiik! (You cannot touch the queen!)\" \"Kihek, Kihek, Kihek...!\" Indeed. It seems like this dungeon was a small kingdom. A kingdom where all the rats serve the queen! By the time Lee Shin Woo had grasped the identity and location of his enemies, his enemies had also started the battle. The Ratman charged at him with surprising speed. At the same time, the Rat Queen began acting aggressively, and that, surprisingly, was \u0027childbirth\u0027! \"Jjjik!\" \"Jjijijik!\" [Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier] [Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier] [Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier] \"Oh...\" When Lee Shin Woo saw the just birthed elite monsters following behind the Ratman and lunging at him, he exclaimed at the realization. The Ratman guarded the queen against trespassers, and the queen would birth soldiers in order to help the Ratman drive back their enemy. Honestly, for a level 1 dungeon, they had such an amazing combination that he had no choice but to recognize them. He had expected an incredibly large rat at best. \"Heup!\" However, at best they were enemies that appeared with strength befitting of a boss, but unfortunately, he had fought against the Zombie Hero at the entrance of the dungeon and won, growing to level 2. So now, a Ratman wasn\u0027t a strong opponent for Lee Shin Woo anymore. That\u0027s because no matter how fast it moved, he could read its movements. \"Kahahk!?\" Lee Shin Woo used his Sprint and charged towards the Ratman whose nails were gleaming and was rushing towards him. The Ratman locked onto him and swung its nails, but at that moment, Lee Shin Woo aimed for its chest and stabbed. It was the stab he was most confident in. [Critical Hit!] \"Kyaaaaahk!\" \"Jjik, jjiiiik!\" Lee Shin Woo, as it were the natural course of action, pierced through the Ratman\u0027s chest. Was that all? He had simultaneously utilized Sprint causing the Ratman to be unable to endure the powerful force, pushing it directly back and causing it to roll to the floor. Its dirty blood scattered about through the air. Two of the Rural Rat Elites that had followed behind the Ratman collided with each other and rolled onto the floor. Lee Shin Woo had the energy to spare and he finished off the remaining, puzzled elite. [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] [You have acquired 15 Perium.] [You have acquired the Rural Rat Elite Soldier\u0027s rib bone.] When he set aside the Perium amount and looked at them objectively, the Rural Rat Elite Soldiers were stronger than the Skeleton Soldiers. Of course, even so, they would still die in one strike from Lee Shin Woo! Lee Shin Woo collected its rib bone for now and turned his attention. Even though blood was pouring out of its chest, the Ratman bravely stood its ground. He saw the queen, who was astonished by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s ability, continue to birth rats at an even quicker rate. \"Jjik, Jjiiiiik...! (I\u0027ll protect the queen no matter what...!)\" \"You left behind such a magnificent line, so you shouldn\u0027t have any more regrets.\" Lee Shin Woo\u0027s red eyes sparkled and after checking the now standing Ratman\u0027s appearance, he prepared his Sprint skill. If he hadn\u0027t gained the Bone of Thunder Lasting, the fight would have gone longer, but it seemed like he\u0027d be able to end it in one more strike with the strength of his sword. \"Jjiik...!\" At that moment, something surprising happened. The Ratman raised both its hands and it seemed as though it was preparing to scratch him, but the next moment, all its nails popped out and flew towards Lee Shin Woo. There were ten in total and considering either the force behind the nails or the mana within them, it certainly wasn\u0027t an ordinary attack! \"Ugh!?\" Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t think an original attack method like that existed and hurriedly swung his sword to parry the nails. He couldn\u0027t block a few of them as they lodged into various parts of his body, and though it was painful, he had fortunately blocked it from reaching any vital areas. If he hadn\u0027t learned Bursting Thunder, no, if he didn\u0027t have any experience in learning Weapon Defense before, he would\u0027ve died once from this skill. \"Kiiiiiiiiik! (Kill him!)\" \"Jjiik!\" \"Jjijiik!\" During the brief instant that he blocked the nails, the Ratman led five Rural Rat Elite Soldiers and pounced on Lee Shin Woo. Though blood was flowing down both the Ratman\u0027s hands, it was staking its life to fulfill its vow, and moving to kill Lee Shin Woo. \"Tch... Sprint!\" Lee Shin Woo also didn\u0027t stay still. He immediately took the nails that limited his movement out, grit his teeth, and used his Sprint, charging towards the front. The Elite Soldiers tried to obstruct his vision by throwing their bodies at him first, but that wouldn\u0027t be able to hinder his movement now. [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] \"Jjik!\" \"Jjiik!\" \"Kuhwaaaahk!\" \"Huaaaahp!\" The sound of the rats\u0027 screams, the Ratman\u0027s shriek, as well as Lee Shin Woo\u0027s battle cry mixed into one. In the corner, the Rat Queen was birthing Elite Soldiers even faster in order to take care of the trespasser. However, by the time the next batch of births was complete, the situation had already been completely cleaned up. \"Kik... Kihi... (My... queen...!)\" [You have hunted the Lv2 Ratman.] [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] With one sword strike, Lee Shin Woo killed the three monsters, including the Ratman, and nimbly swung his sword again, killing the other Elite Soldiers attacking him. The strength was truly like lightning falling from the sky and striking the earth. [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] [You have hunted a Lv1 Rural Rat Elite Soldier.] \"Ggiiik...! (How...!)\" The Rat Queen spoke in a disbelieving voice. Lee Shin Woo was still intact and collected the bones and the Perium on the ground in one go. Honestly, he wanted to reinforce himself with the Ratman\u0027s finger bone first, but right now, he needed to check something first. It was the ability within the Rural Rat Elite Soldiers\u0027 rib bones. \"Bone Reinforcement.\" [You have reinforced your rib bones. Your proficiency in Stealth has increased by 5%.] [Jjjijijijijijijik! - Rural Rat Elite Soldier] \"...So that\u0027s how it is.\" The crack in his ribs from the Ratman\u0027s nail throw was quickly healed. Was that all? His Stealth proficiency had increased by as much as 5%. He had predicted this, but it was much more effective than a normal Rural Rat! Lee Shin Woo\u0027s eyes, which were gazing at the Rural Rat Queen, gleamed drearily. \"I\u0027m curious how long you can keep giving birth now.\" \"Jjik, Jjiik...!\" The Rural Rat Queen faced the wicked skeleton and was struck with horror. Of course, all she could do was give birth, and just like he wanted, she gave him reinforcement materials... No, she had no choice but to birth Elite Soldiers.
