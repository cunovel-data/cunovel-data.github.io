It was collecting the loot from the battle. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s party safely got out of Bayran and then gathered with the android Chi Pauls, the Chi Pauls that had already withdrawn from the city, and the Giants; he praised them for their hard work and then reinforced them with the bones that were gathered. [Thank you very much, Lord Paul Zero!] \"There\u0027s not much time left. Are you all ready?\" [We all saw the light that you unleashed, Lord Paul Zero. We\u0027re prepared to sacrifice everything for you at any time!] [Glory to the Titan!] \"Alright, good. Those who haven\u0027t been reinforced yet, come forward!\" He first reinforced them, fully healing them and strengthening them. Then, they hid within one of their nearby bases and got back on track. \"What a huge army! No matter how I look at it, those Giants don\u0027t fit at all...!\" \"Haha. They\u0027re just a portion of my army. Ah, some of my forces are also on the surface. This is a secret, but Jin Jin already knows about me and is doing something for me on the surface.\" \"Even Ye Jin Jin!? I\u0027m the senior here, but I\u0027ve never been to the surface before...!\" \"All the citizens of the Underground Empire yearn to go the surface, yet you so easily...\" He\u0027d managed to collect the thorn wall, the loot, as well as the forces he\u0027d brought with him. By the time he was finished with all that, Lee Shin Woo was about to activate the Heaven Door\u0027s Key but remembered that he had some things to do before going to the Metal Army\u0027s base. Therefore, he decided to visit the wine factory first, which was near the level 3 danger zone. Plus, most of the materials that Kratia had studied had been left there, and above all, he needed to check on the progress of the wine. \"Junior, you\u0027re good at cooking food with oil.\" \"Well, this is how it turns out when a man cooks.\" \"...One more bowl.\" Once the long, exhausting battle was over, Lee Shin Woo cooked meat fried rice over high heat (he called it high heat, but he was actually using his Lv7 High Rank Fire element) for his companions, who yearned for food more than anything else. The best way to prepare delicious food when one couldn\u0027t cook well was to use delicious ingredients and prepare them in the simplest way! Of course, everyone liked his food. \"It\u0027s quite delicious, Hero. There\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t do.\" \"There\u0027re things Shin Woo can\u0027t do. Like fighting head-to-head.\" \"Jin, aren\u0027t you being too hard on me lately? Ah, we have soup too.\" He also prepared a soup using a variety of vegetables from the surface; the soup\u0027s base tasted like something between soybean paste and soy sauce, and he let it come to a roaring boil. Because he prepared it so simply, it tasted good. It was quite mild compared to the rich fried rice, yet it was nonetheless filled with flavor, making the two dishes a good match. \"This soup is delicious! Why didn\u0027t you cook before, if you were so good at it?\" \"I couldn\u0027t eat before, so I didn\u0027t really want to cook for other people.\" \"You\u0027re really honest... Ah, give me another bowl too!\" But now, he could enjoy food. He tried his best to ignore Jin\u0027s betrayed look and ate some more fried rice. Right now, he felt like he had made the right call to pursue a human body. However, Jin wasn\u0027t the only one staring at him. He turned around, looked at the almost completely still woman, and tilted his head. \"What, you\u0027re not eating? You can eat too, you know.\" \"How can you be so... nonchalant about all this...\" She, the Elder Banshee Princess, Seira Von Retadane\u0027s hands shook in rage. But she couldn\u0027t just throw away her bowl of food, so she placed it onto the floor, pointed her finger at Lee Shin Woo, and said. \"We have something else to talk about! Because of you, I turned into this...! Plus, I turned into an undead! How can you be so calm and eat as if nothing happened when Lee Shin Woo has been hiding the fact that he\u0027s been undead this entire time!? How is that even possible? How can you eat his food without a care in the world!?\" \"I already knew a while back, so it doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"Mm... I know he\u0027s not a bad guy, so there\u0027s no helping it. Moreover, he\u0027s my junior! Plus, he doesn\u0027t smell like he\u0027s dead! From the outside... oh, I guess it\u0027s the same on the inside too. He\u0027s completely human; more importantly, he\u0027s on my side!\" Kratia answered immediately. Prince, with her lips smeared with oily rice, also came to his defense, though she was extremely biased. Whereas, Jin, who was likewise an undead hero like Lee Shin Woo, said nothing. The Immortal Princess Dana, who had been eating her third bowl of fried rice, looked at her close friend and former fiance\u0027s younger sister and laughed. \"Seira, you\u0027ve been freed of the undead curse. You shouldn\u0027t waste your time being dissatisfied and throwing a tantrum. If it wasn\u0027t for the Hero, then you wouldn\u0027t be able to eat this delicious food. I\u0027m in the same boat as well.\" \"Dana...!\" Although the two\u0027s species were completely different, one being an Immortal while the other was a Banshee, as well as one being alive and the other undead, their situation was the same. They were given another chance at life by Lee Shin Woo. And on the same day at that. \"It\u0027s a blessing, Seira. You\u0027re happy you\u0027re alive, right? Being able to move forward; it\u0027s such a precious thing. Moreover, didn\u0027t the Hero say that it didn\u0027t matter what we looked like? What matters is that we\u0027re here, alive.\" \"But thus far he\u0027s completely...\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter if he\u0027s deceived you. You know why he had to lie to you, Seira.\" \"I... I still can\u0027t accept this. This isn\u0027t what I chose. This is contract fraud.\" \"Tch. She found out.\" He figured she\u0027d be happy that he saved her, but it seems like she was still going through puberty. Lee Shin Woo was about to say something, but Dana winked at him. She was telling him to leave it to her. \"The Hero was willing to go that far to save you and give you another chance. At the time, you couldn\u0027t make a rational decision, could you? Why don\u0027t you first think about why he saved you when he normally cuts down his enemies without mercy.\" \"...Dana.\" \"I know, Seira. There\u0027s too much that happened all at once for you to accept it. Mulling things over is a good thing. But Seira, let\u0027s take it slow, step by step and think about things together. There\u0027s no need to rush. We can be together from now on. ...Ah, but there is one thing.\" Dana\u0027s motherly speech caused even Seira\u0027s expression to soften. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo realized that not just anyone could be a princess. During that time, Dana\u0027s attitude changed. Her emotions had intensified, signaling to him that she was instinctively gathering various types of elemental mana. \"One thing we can\u0027t take slow is our revenge. To be honest, I really don\u0027t care what happens to the surface from now on, but I must take my revenge on my father, who bound me for so many years and made me like this; as well as his forces and my fiance who abandoned me.\" \"Dana.\" \"Can you help me, Seira? Could you trust me and the Hero, and help us?\" He\u0027d already formed an official contract with her, so he didn\u0027t need to check what she was thinking. But even knowing that, Dana still gave Seira the chance to make her own decision. As she said, she was starting small; she was trying to resolve Seira\u0027s countless contradictions and aspirations one-by-one. Did she succeed? Seira soon sighed and shook her head. \"Stop speaking nonsense, Dana. I know already. That I already made my choice... At this point, I\u0027m just spitting on my own face.\" She\u0027s right. She was just wasting time. However, she picked up the bowl of fried rice and soup again, so Lee Shin Woo decided not to intervene. Dana looked satisfied with herself as she backed off. \"Hoo, hoo. If you already know, then there\u0027s nothing more I have to say.\" \"But I do have a question. Why are acting so close to Lee Shin Woo? I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027ve only known him for a few hours, so why are you acting like that? Did he brainwash you?\" \"Oh my.\" Dana\u0027s eyes lit up. Jin, who sensed something unusual going on, kicked Lee Shin Woo, but he was actually innocent this time. He\u0027d already formed an official contract with her, and there was no need to enter a relationship with her, so why would he be attracted to her!? \"He hasn\u0027t brainwashed me, Seira. I just felt fated to be with him, that\u0027s all. Think about it, Seira. It would be strange if I hadn\u0027t fallen for him; a brave hero saving me from all that pain and suffering.\" \"That kind of pure and beautiful love only shows up in fairytales; it doesn\u0027t often work out that way. Moreover, why are you calling him Hero? There\u0027s a limit to being old-fashioned.\" \"Hoo. You were always so pessimistic, Seira. That\u0027s why men didn\u0027t approach you.\" \"What... That goes for you as well!\" \"I already had a fiance before I was even born, so I couldn\u0027t even dream of love!\" Ah, it was going so well, but they started arguing over an unexpected topic! The level 8 Banshee and Immortal were looking at each other so seriously! Lee Shin Woo stood up in a fluster. \"If you\u0027re done eating, then should I bring out the dessert? I\u0027ve cooled some wine jelly, so I\u0027ll just bring it right up!\" \"...Not yet. I\u0027ll soon finish eating, so please wait a little longer.\" However, Seira herself stopped Lee Shin Woo. She glared at Dana, as if deeply unsatisfied (for her, it was quite the rare expression) and then began to eat some fried rice. The fact that she was eating her food meant that she accepted the situation. He thought she\u0027d throw a tantrum before calming down, but things had surprisingly gone better than expected. Lee Shin Woo sat back down, and Seira looked at him with a satisfied, yet lukewarm expression, as though something was bland; her skin was paler now that she was an undead, making her lips more alluring than before. She pouted and said. \"The fried rice and soup were delicious.\" \"...I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" \"Eut...\" While Seira was eating, Lee Shin Woo finished his work in the wine factory and called the Dryads, who were hiding due to the shock from unexpected visitors. He introduced them to Dana and as expected, they were really happy to see her. \"There really were living spirits left in the Underground Empire! Ah, what a joyous occasion...\" [It\u0027s nice to meet you, Princess.] [It\u0027s the famous princess. She\u0027s not human, but she\u0027s still alive!] [I smell Paul Zero from her. She must\u0027ve formed a contract with Paul Zero!] [So that\u0027s why she\u0027s still alive! She smells good.] [Want to play with us? Want to imitate Paul Zero?] Dana brightened up immediately. The others\u0027 mood brightened as well. Jin followed Dana and began conversing with the Dryads as well. He\u0027d wondered how this would go a while back, but it seemed like it had all worked out. Lee Shin Woo sighed in relief and drew in her empty bowl from behind. It was shining as if he didn\u0027t even need to wash it. Lee Shin Woo took it and stared at her. Then, Seira added in an unnecessary explanation. \"...In the Empire, eating everything off your plate is the greatest compliment to the chef. It\u0027s not because I was hungry.\" \"So that\u0027s why everyone ate everything.\" \"B-But... Didn\u0027t you used to speak politely to me?\" \"We\u0027ve formed a master-servant contract, so wouldn\u0027t me speaking politely be kind of weird? And it\u0027s not my style anyway.\" \"I see.\" He played along with Prince because it was fun. Lee Shin Woo took the bowl and threw it into his inventory. Seira watched vacantly as he did so and added. \"My inventory\u0027s disappeared. How unfortunate; I wanted to brew a cup of tea for you in exchange for the meal.\" \"Eh, I can just buy you a teapot and some tea leaves later.\" \"...Is that so? Thank you.\" Seira thanked him and nodded her head. He thought that\u0027d be it, so he turned around, but she grabbed onto him once more. \"Now... I don\u0027t have to cling to the Retadane name anymore. It\u0027s all because of you.\" \"Man, you really have to pin everything on me?\" \"...So, you can call me Seira now.\" \"Huh?\" \"I\u0027m going to try living as Banshee Seira from now on. ...That\u0027s all.\" Seira turned around and left. He watched her, dumbfounded, and Jin, who\u0027d come back secretly, kicked him once more. He couldn\u0027t tell why she\u0027d done that at all.
