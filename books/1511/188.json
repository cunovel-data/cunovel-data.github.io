What Remains of the Battle - 4\u003e\\n\\n [Through your plotting, your swindling, your troops, and your comrades, you have achieved the feat of annihilating an undead army. Of the surviving heroes, you have achieved the greatest feat. You have acquired the title, \u0027Shadow Hero\u0027. All stats have increased by 15. You can now more skillfully hide whatever you wish.]\\n\\n [The Thorn Shadow skill has become Lv2. Strength, Agility, and Magic have increased by 5.]\\n\\n [The High Rank Command skill has become Lv7 and all stats have increased by 5.]\\n\\n \"Retadane!\"\\n\\n \"Keuk!?\"\\n\\n Once he\u0027d confirmed that all the 12 generals\u0027 troops were annihilated, Lee Shin Woo stopped Retadane from attacking his Paul Zero Corps. He had stayed near her because he knew that she\u0027d act this way.\\n\\n \"Please get out of my way.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t fight anymore. You\u0027re exhausted.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re our enemies.\"\\n\\n \"If we don\u0027t attack them first, there\u0027s a chance that they won\u0027t become our enemies! At the very least, you agreed that we wouldn\u0027t fight them today.\"\\n\\n \"I changed my mind. I can\u0027t let them go. The undead are... our enemies...!\"\\n\\n Even while gasping for breath, Retadane\u0027s red eyes shined sharply, and Lee Shin Woo could clearly feel the swelling killing intent within them. It felt like she would attack Lee Shin Woo as well, if he tried to stop her. Lee Shin Woo was sure that she wasn\u0027t in her right mind right now.\\n\\n \"Please... get out of my way...!\"\\n\\n When they had talked before, she hadn\u0027t said something so reckless. But when she saw the undead nearby, she blanked out and became unruly. There was no difference between her and a brainless undead right now.\\n\\n \"Lee Shin Woo, get out of my way!\"\\n\\n \"Please calm down!\"\\n\\n Her flail came flying at him, but Lee Shin Woo blocked it with a shield he\u0027d summoned beforehand. Although it looked normal from the outside, the Titan\u0027s Fortress (which was now level 7) had changed slightly from the Titan’s Pride. While it didn\u0027t lack in the defense department, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t have an answer for the force behind Retadane\u0027s flail.\\n\\n \u0027I ordered them to retreat already, so I should just keep her busy until they\u0027ve all left. Anyway... this woman\u0027s really strong.\u0027\\n\\n Retadane was level 8, so his Rebellion skill was in effect. Despite the skill buffing his stats, it was difficult for him to block her attacks.\\n\\n The fact that he was being pushed back, despite him reinforcing his body with both the Rebellion and the Rule of Bone skills, meant that Retadane possessed a special ability that reinforced her physical abilities, adding onto the increased effectiveness of her status as a level 8. If not for the other undead, this woman would\u0027ve been able to defeat both of the generals by herself.\\n\\n \"How!? You\u0027ve only just hit level 7...!\"\\n\\n However, Retadane was even more agitated than Lee Shin Woo. A level 7 hero, not one of the 12 generals, was blocking her strike head on; she didn\u0027t even think that was possible. Moreover, she was also using a skill that increased the force of her blows, so she was even more surprised.\\n\\n \"Have you calmed down?\"\\n\\n \"...Keuk.\"\\n\\n Retadane\u0027s blind hatred and rage subsided slightly, perhaps due to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s shocking strength. She realized that if she were to attack the Heaven Defying General (with her weary body), she would die. \\n\\n \"Thank you for stopping me... Lee Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n [Seira.]\\n\\n Once Seira withdrew her flail and stepped back, one of the undead amidst the Heaven Defying General\u0027s retreating undead, wearing jet-black armor, came forward. Because he had taken off his helmet, Retadane could recognize him.\\n\\n \"...Shino Rendu.\"\\n\\n [It\u0027s been a long time, Seira. I really missed you.]\\n\\n \"To think you\u0027d fall so far and follow the orders of an undead. You\u0027re a disgrace.\"\\n\\n [...]\\n\\n Amongst the countless species of undead, Shino Rendu was a high rank undead who almost completely retained his living appearance. Because of that, his contorted face stood out even more. Retadane had caused a commotion, attracting the other heroes, and they could see Shino Rendu as well.\\n\\n [I still have my own free will. I still hate the Emperor and I want to annihilate the 12 generals as well. The one I follow wants that as well. ...So can we really not fight on the same side?]\\n\\n \"We cannot. God demands but one thing from us: exterminating the undead. You\u0027re no exception.\"\\n\\n [Seira...]\\n\\n \"My name is Retadane.\"\\n\\n [...Retadane. Why can\u0027t we understand each other when we both want to save the Empire? Don\u0027t be so biased. Look me in the eye.]\\n\\n \"Your premise is wrong.\"\\n\\n Although Shino Rendu clearly relayed his feelings to her, Retadane\u0027s voice remained frigid. No, it actually seemed colder than before.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to save the Empire. So, I\u0027m the only one who can understand myself. You assuming that you know what I want makes me sick.\"\\n\\n [...]\\n\\n \"You\u0027re my enemy the next time we meet.\"\\n\\n Retadane declared coldly and turned around. It was for no other reason, but the fact that she wouldn\u0027t be able to restrain her hatred for the undead if she looked at him any longer. Shino Rendu recognized this fact; he smiled dejectedly and had no choice but to retreat.\\n\\n \"Shino!\"\\n\\n But before he left, Lloyd called his name. Shino Rendu stopped. Lloyd hesitated for a while, but ultimately... spoke.\\n\\n \"Thanks... for helping us today.\"\\n\\n [Lloyd. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re safe.]\\n\\n \"...I don\u0027t know. Everything that happened today... it\u0027s too difficult for me to make a decision on my own, but I\u0027m glad I was able to meet you again. ...I\u0027m being honest.\"\\n\\n [...Me too.]\\n\\n \"...Ah.\"\\n\\n Shino Rendu smiled sadly and replied. Then, he went back into the Paul Zero Corps and could no longer be seen. Prince belatedly opened her mouth, but it was already too late. He was gone. Retadane looked at the two and said coldly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll only hurt more.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re probably right, Retadane. ...Even so, I couldn\u0027t just sit by and do nothing.\"\\n\\n \"...I pity you.\"\\n\\n Even Lee Shin Woo, who was good at reading people, didn\u0027t know why Retadane had said that. Of course, unlike Shino Rendu, Lee Shin Woo had no plans on overstepping and going through her emotional walls.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter what feelings they had for one another, so long as they worked together. If he could control her, then there was definitely a chance that they could work together.\\n\\n \"Looking at it now, his army\u0027s tremendous... It\u0027s incomparable to the Beast General\u0027s or the Vulture General\u0027s armies. Just his subordinates are that strong, so how strong is the Heaven Defying General? He\u0027s at least level 8.\"\\n\\n \"His army’s not uniform at all. It\u0027s like he\u0027s gathered them from all over the place. Each and every one of them possess considerable strength.\"\\n\\n The heroes watched in shock and awe as the undead collected the loot and quickly retreated. Lee Shin Woo kept an eye on Retadane (as she could go crazy again) so that his army could retreat safely. Fortunately, nothing went wrong.\\n\\n [Master, I\u0027m finished verifying. There were a few people watching us, but they won\u0027t come and attack you.]\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a relief. I have to remain inconspicuous no matter what and hide...\u0027\\n\\n By the time he could barely see his troops, Rem gave his report whilst looking down from the sky.\\n\\n He had caused mayhem. Even if someone were to see him, it wouldn\u0027t be a problem. According to Rem, there were three people currently watching this place, along with the heroes and the Heaven Defying General. Lee Shin Woo could tell where these people came from.\\n\\n \u0027The Empire, Steelworker, and... Anti-Skull.\u0027\\n\\n This battle was a sort of \u0027trigger\u0027. All of these factions felt a sense of foreboding, yet they hadn\u0027t been able to easily initiate the conflict. However, this was the signal for that battle to begin. Each faction knew about each other by now, so they couldn\u0027t remain hidden any longer.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo felt the current that he and the other heroes were riding. If he wanted to survive this irresistible wave, then...\\n\\n \"I think we should stay out of the limelight for now. Since it\u0027d be easy for us to draw attention right now.\"\\n\\n \"I agree. There are too many enemies.\"\\n\\n Perhaps Retadane had noticed them, as she spoke with a comparatively calm voice.\\n\\n \"However, before that... let\u0027s divvy up the loot.\"\\n\\n The battle was on a large-scale, so the resulting loot was considerable. Everyone was given loot based on their karma. However, the 12 generals still left behind the best loot!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t get much from the Vulture General, aside from some Perium, but Kratia gained his bone.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, I got a present for you.\"\\n\\n \"I love you.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n Kratia discreetly gave him the bone and Lee Shin Woo gave her an appropriate amount of Perium in return. Then, he executed Bone Reinforcement without the other heroes knowing.\\n\\n [Consuming the Lv7 Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle\u0027s parietal bone to reinforce your parietal bone! Agility has increased by 20, Health by 30, and Magic by 10. The Intermediate Assimilation skill has become Lv10 and evolves to the high rank level. Agility and Magic have increased by 20.]\\n\\n [With this... Everyone has become bald. Ah, Your Majesty... - Bureuche Von Golden Eagle]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo ignored the Vulture General\u0027s \u0027salty\u0027 memories while checking the increase in his stats and skill proficiency from absorbing the bone.\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo]\\n\\n [Breathing Bone Joker]\\n\\n [Shadow Hero; 14 others]\\n\\n [Lv - 7 (Status effectiveness 250%)]\\n\\n [Strength - 2,149 Agility 2,091 Health - 2,222 Magic - 4,408]\\n\\n [Passive skills - Acting Lv19, Invisible Heart Lv4/Lv159, Rebellion Lv4, Mana Acceleration Lv4, Thorn Shadow Lv2, High Rank Bursting Thunder Lv5, High Rank Mana Bone Lv4, High Rank Command Lv7, High Rank Assimilation Lv1, High Rank Combat Sense Lv4, Lucky Strike Lv2]\\n\\n [Active skills - Disguise Lv7, Instigate Lv8, Bone Reinforcement Lv12, Rule of Bone Lv11, Bone Armory Lv10, High Rank Regeneration Lv3, Sacrifice Lv1, Emergency Evasion Lv6, High Rank Lightning Sprint Lv4, Lightning Shadow Lv4]\\n\\n [Elements - High Rank Fire Lv3, Intermediate Ice Lv8, High Rank Wind Lv1, High Rank Acid Lv2, High Rank Lightning Lv4, High Rank Darkness Lv4, Absorption Lv8]\\n\\n [Resistances - Holy: MAX, Darkness: MAX, Light: MAX, High Rank Wind Lv1, High Rank Acid Lv2, Intermediate Ice Lv7, High Rank Fire Lv2, High Rank Lightning Lv2]\\n\\n With this, he possessed a total of 10,870 stats. Not only had he been rewarded for killing two of the 12 generals, but he\u0027d also absorbed several powerful individuals\u0027 bones. And in the process, his skills had leveled up as well, causing his stats to increase so much.\\n\\n The other heroes would feel weak if they knew about his stats, but Lee Shin Woo felt like he wasn\u0027t there yet. There were so many powerful individuals in the Empire, so he needed to get to level 8 as soon as possible.\\n\\n \u0027I need 1,930 stats until I reach level 8... If I absorb the bones my boys collected, then my stats will increase even further, but for the time being, it\u0027ll be difficult to take down another one of the 12 generals, so I need to move as discreetly as possible... So it won\u0027t be easy. Sseup.\u0027\\n\\n This was why he didn\u0027t want to make any big moves until he was ready, but Ethan Cruz had caused a slight setback in his plans. He\u0027d gotten everything he could from Ethan Cruz, so he supposed that he should consider himself fortunate.\\n\\n \"...Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n \"...Ah, yes?\"\\n\\n He was so focused that he didn\u0027t react to Retadane\u0027s call in time and replied a bit absentmindedly. Retadane, looking a bit sheepish (it seems like she was aware of how much trouble she\u0027d caused him), then said.\\n\\n \"We should talk about what happened here... Would you like to have a cup of tea with us?\"\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-188","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
