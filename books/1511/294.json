The Final Stage - 4\u003e She was the Spirit Princess, the Spirit General, and the Spirits\u0027 Springs\u0027 contractor. The Immortal (a never before seen species), Dana, suddenly raised her head. She\u0027d gotten the signal. Ever since she\u0027d come here, she\u0027d been waiting for that signal. \"The Hero is calling us. It\u0027s time.\" [Zenon\u0027s gone to the front.] [Yeah, I feel like Paul Zero\u0027s calling us.] The Spirits\u0027 Spring spirits had prepared for battle as well. No, perhaps they had waited for this moment over any other. Their hatred and anger towards those who\u0027d abandoned and imprisoned them! They had nurtured their anger and hatred until it was ready to explode! \"Are you all ready? You remember what he said, yes?\" [We know.] [I\u0027d like to kill all the humans, but... I know that we can\u0027t.] As the spirits were abandoned by humans, their anger was indiscriminately directed at all of mankind. But if they weren\u0027t careful, then they would bring ruin to humanity. Lee Shin Woo had used their anger to goad them on and had turned their anger towards someone else. He limited their targets and had reset their goals. As a result... [In order for our descendants to live on the surface, we must...] [Side with the humans.] [We\u0027ll act like we\u0027re on their side.] [We\u0027ll give the humans who embrace us another chance.] [If they accept us, that is.] [But we can\u0027t forgive the Emperor and his associates.] The spirits, all pumped up, each had something to say. Yeah, that was plenty. Dana smiled and turned around. Sinea flew beside her. [When\u0027s our turn? When can we meet Paul Zero again?] \"We have to wait a little longer. When the humans begin to despair and start praying for their salvation... that\u0027s where we come in. To disavow the Emperor and all that\u0027s under his control.\" [As expected of Paul Zero. He\u0027s trying to change everything with one single battle.] \"But still, the Empire\u0027s vast. Though this battle will determine the fate of the Empire, if the battle takes place in an isolated location, it will be difficult to overturn the common perception that has developed over many years with just one battle.\" [Yeah.] Sinea agreed and gazed at the spirits that filled the Spirits\u0027 Spring to the brim. Right now, they were divided into two groups. One group would participate in the battle between the humans and the undead in order to restore the spirits\u0027 status and the other... \"The rest of the Imperial Army\u0027s elites will be in this battle. Miss Jin Jin made it that way. Therefore, the forces protecting the cities (the soldiers and the knights commanding them) are minimal.\" [That\u0027s probably true, but... those soldiers won\u0027t attack us, right? Not only are the soldiers citizens of the Empire, but attacking them will cause the people to hate us more, no?] \"You\u0027re right. That\u0027s why the golems are going to attack the Imperial Army.\" [...?] Seeing Sinea\u0027s head tilt, Dana smiled faintly and continued. \"The Hero, through Rem, has already taken control of all the golems within the Empire. With the addition of his innate elements, even the Emperor cannot retake control over the golems. Those golems, which are spread all across the Empire, will attack the Imperial Army all at once... How do you think the people will react?\" [They\u0027ll lose all faith in the Emperor! ...But so many people will die!] \"It\u0027s ultimately all just an act. Our true goal isn\u0027t the soldiers, who\u0027re just following orders, but the vested rights of the ruling class. The golems were ordered to execute the corrupt nobles and knights only. And after killing them, the golems will act like they\u0027re turning against the people as well, but then...\" [That\u0027s where we come in?] \"Exactly. We\u0027ll destroy the golems and save the people. If we maximize the Spirits\u0027 Springs\u0027 mobility and the golems match our movements, then it\u0027s certainly possible. It\u0027ll be quite the show.\" [You\u0027re actually calling it a show...] It was just a poor show. However, it would still fool the people. When the golems drew near, the appearance of the spirits, who would appear like lightning and rush to their aid... Contrary to the Emperor or the nobles, who were afraid of the spirits\u0027 power and ostracized them, the people were taught that the spirits were wrongful existences. The nobles that had abandoned them and the spirits that had saved them; it was clear which side they\u0027d choose. Even more so once the Emperor and the nobles that had abandoned the spirits were out of the picture. [But Dana, you must know that even if things go according to plan, that...] \"...There\u0027s nothing we can do about the resulting casualties; they truly are \u0027unavoidable casualties\u0027. If we took into account the lives of each and every soldier, then we wouldn\u0027t be here right now. The Hero is also aware of this fact.\" [Wow, Paul Zero will really go to Hell when he dies.] \"Hoo, hoo. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll follow him down to Hell and assist him.] [Dana, you still don\u0027t know Paul Zero well enough yet. One day, Paul Zero will control Hell too.] \"Oh my, it\u0027d be well worth assisting him then.\" [Haha.] The two women smiled meaningfully and turned towards the spirits. Their power then simultaneously took control of the spirits. \"Everyone, get ready! The stage that the Hero has prepared for us... It requires our very best acting!\" [Chin up, everyone! This is the first step towards our future!] Whereas, Shino Rendu was speaking to his own troops, though its purpose was different. Countless Pauls were following him! ...And there were countless more undead following behind them, trying to kill them! [Is that the fastest you can go!? If you\u0027re that slow, then those undead bastards will catch us!] [No, sir! We can run even faster!] Obviously, the Pauls were undead, so their stamina was limitless. To be more specific, of the two domains that governed one\u0027s body... defense and stamina, stamina was essentially limitless. This was why it was so difficult to face an undead in combat. If the undead weren\u0027t able to catch them now, then they would never be able to catch the Pauls in their game of tag. Honestly, this short play of theirs had gone on for two hours already. Thousands of Pauls were being chased by tens of thousands of undead... What\u0027s worse, their pursuers\u0027 numbers were continuously increasing! [We\u0027ll kill all of the underground\u0027s undead. We\u0027ll erase all proof of the curse\u0027s existence! Us! That\u0027s our job. That\u0027s what Paul Zero ordered us to do!] [For Paul Zero!] [His great goal of purifying the entire Empire... All of our efforts have been for this!] [Lord Paul Zero, we\u0027re right here!] They uttered such nonsense that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were his troops or a part of his fan club; regardless, the Pauls continued to run diligently! They looked quite funny, but the result was by no means a joke. Looking back, Shino Rendu was shocked. \u0027To think that I would be able to do something like this... No, this is also Lord Paul Zero\u0027s will. He really is amazing. No one could\u0027ve ever imagined it. To think he\u0027d both be the one who caused the war that would decide the continent\u0027s fate, as well as the one who would end it...!\u0027 Through this battle, Lee Shin Woo was attempting to eliminate all of his enemies on the surface and underground, and simultaneously eliminate all sources of the curse. That was also the reason that he\u0027d ordered the Pauls to \u0027lure\u0027 so many of the undead over. [Not yet. We haven\u0027t gone east yet. Draw out all of the undead hiding about. Bring out all of the undead that are snooping around the city walls!] [Uoooooooh! You cowards! The Heaven Defying General is calling you! He told us that he\u0027d take you to the surface!] [Follow us. You poor souls who\u0027ve lost your egos! We will bring you true salvation!] [G-Guooooh...!] [Kuaaaaaah!] Obviously, this was happening all across the Underground Empire. Shino Rendu was but one of the brigades luring the undead; there were also a small handful of elites with exceptional aggro abilities that lured thousands of undead towards them. Lee Shin Woo had meticulously divided the Underground Empire into parts and had sent his Pauls off into different locations. He\u0027d ordered his Pauls to lure the undead to the surface. Several of the Heaven Defying General\u0027s corps were currently fulfilling this order of his! Though their locations and their destinations differed, the result would be the same. They would lead the undead to the surface! Before proceeding with this mission, Lee Shin Woo had dug several passageways to the surface. He had set up these regional passageways so that they would gather in one single location! The golems had been helping him with this for months now! \u0027Leading all the underground\u0027s undead to the surface. And bringing them peace once they get there...\u0027 All would dance upon his stage. What was the difference between them and Shino Rendu? At the very least, Shino Rendu knew what his role in all this was, and he had been prepared for his role beforehand. \u0027It\u0027s ironic. They had dreamt of returning to the surface, but they\u0027ll be killed after getting a taste of it.\u0027 The relationship between Seira Von Retadane and Shino Rendu was also ironic. When they were still alive, nothing he said got through to her, yet after dying, they became true comrades. \u0027Though she rejected me outright, and our goals are a lot different from when we were still heroes... Ha, thinking about this now is pointless...\u0027 He was getting emotional; it was unlike him. His personal feelings weren\u0027t anything compared to Paul Zero\u0027s orders. Only by following his orders could he obtain that sweet revenge he\u0027d been waiting for! Shino Rendu smiled bitterly, urged his skeleton horse to run faster, and yelled to his troops in a booming voice. [This is where it all starts! Once we get to the surface, we have to act like we\u0027re on the same side as them. Remember what Lord Paul Zero told us! We\u0027re going to push them. To peaceful salvation...!] [Lord Paul Zero\u0027s salvation...!] [And thus, peace will be restored to the Empire...!] Mm, it really was a religion. A true pseudo religion. One where the believers had to sacrifice themselves...! Shino Rendu, who wasn\u0027t aware that he was one of them, just smiled bitterly. But then... before they had even moved out, the hero Lloyd was screaming. \"Lee Shin Woo went to the imperial palace by himself!? ...What are you even talking about!? Didn\u0027t you say we were going to fight against the Imperial Army now!?\" \"Oh, so you didn\u0027t know yet. My bad.\" Whereas, Kratia, who was responsible for explaining the battle to them, expressionlessly struck her forehead, and began explaining whilst retaining her expressionless face. \"We\u0027re going to follow him slowly. While Shin Woo keeps the Emperor busy, we need to drag out all the forces within the capital and lure them underground.\" \"Will that even work!?\" \"It will.\" Kratia, with the Mana Radar that Lee Shin Woo had entrusted to her (as he said he didn\u0027t need it anymore), discerned that a huge amount of undead were moving and smiled slightly. \"You\u0027ll see soon enough.\" Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-294","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
