New Party Member - 3\u003e Lee Shin Woo and his party returned to the surface, and his first order of business was to take measures (e.g. disguise Ye Jin Jin) to establish her as Lawrence\u0027s representative. And it had proceeded quite smoothly. \"My name is Izuna. I\u0027m Mr. Lawrence\u0027s attendant and representative.\" \"Hmm, what\u0027s Mr. Lawrence doing right now...?\" \"He\u0027s left everything to me, so if you have business with him, then you can just tell me instead.\" \"Hoh, he\u0027s left everything to you, huh. You two seem quite close... My my, I feel left out.\" \"I will proceed with Mr. Lawrence\u0027s contracts as scheduled. Please take care of me.\" Just a few days ago, Lee Shin Woo thought of her as an idiot, but when he saw the sight before him, he was honestly a bit shocked. He\u0027d trained her quite thoroughly, but he hadn\u0027t expected her to act so perfectly! \u0027This is the strength of a woman in love. She\u0027s working so hard to be of help to you. She really is amazing.\u0027 \u0027Why are you being so sarcastic? Just compliment her.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m just so touched; her love transcends life and death.\u0027 \u0027You know, that\u0027s the very definition of sarcasm.\u0027 From what he\u0027d remembered, Jin and Ye Jin Jin had been really close, but for some reason, Jin was in a bad mood once they met on the surface. By the time he\u0027d replied to Jin\u0027s complaints and raised his head, the merchants that had come to the Lawrence shop had all left. Ye Jin Jin was dressed formally without any frills, wore light makeup, and her hair was tied tightly. She, who looked like a skilled merchant that had popped straight out of a novel, stared at him with unease. \"W-was that ok, Mr. Shin Woo?\" \"Yeah. It was perfect, Izuna.\" \"When it\u0027s just the two of us, please call me Jin Jin.\" Ye Jin Jin blushed and requested carefully; as Jin had said, she looked like the very definition of a woman in love. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and when he was about to reply, a skeleton horse\u0027s head came through the window. \"I\u0027m here too, Jin Jin.\" \"Heok, I-I\u0027m sorry! That\u0027s not what I meant...\" As expected, something did go on between them, considering the bad blood between them... He wondered whether he should arbitrate this matter or not, but for some reason, he felt like he\u0027d make it even worse if he acted hastily, so he gave up on it. \"Just keep acting like that from now on. You may be my representative, but you won\u0027t have to worry about the business itself. Just fool the guys that come over and you\u0027ll be fine.\" \"B-But still, you should give me something to do.\" \"I mean, there\u0027s nothing for you to really do... I\u0027ve found some places nearby that are around your level, so go around and work hard when you have the time.\" \"O-Ok!\" She replied so enthusiastically that it felt as though she\u0027d go hunt a dragon if Lee Shin Woo told her to. Even though he felt uneasy as he looked at her, he passed over the materials he\u0027d prepared through the golem network. [Paul Zero, I\u0027ve planted all the trees!] \"Ooh.\" Around that time, he\u0027d even given the Elder Dryad Princess, Sinea, some work to do. He\u0027d wanted her to plant the branch she\u0027d brought with her near his residence, but she said she\u0027d make this entire area hers so that she could use her powers however she wished. [If I plant another branch someplace else, then I can go back and forth.] \"You even have the ability to make a gate!?\" [There\u0027re some downsides though. It costs a lot of mana, and if the branch gets damaged in any way, then I get hurt as well.] Although it was an unignorable downside, it was quite the reliable teleportation ability, when he took into account how much she\u0027d have to do on the surface from now on. [I\u0027ll rush over if something happens to you, Paul Zero. Here.] \"Thanks.\" Sinea passed him a tree branch, which emitted the exact same energy as the previously planted branch. If he needed her, he could probably just plant the branch in the ground to summon her. The power of the spirits was formidable indeed. \"You\u0027re not going with the spirit?\" \"Sinea will use this spot as a base camp and search for other spirits. Plus, spirits won\u0027t show up where I\u0027m going anyway.\" [I\u0027m saddened by the fact that I can\u0027t be together with you, even after following you up here...] For the time being, Lee Shin Woo had to act as the mercenary, Kay and clear unconquered dungeons for the Sun God religion. Bringing a level 7 wood spirit there would be extremely conspicuous. Moreover, he used the fire element when masquerading as Kay, so their compatibility was terrible, which was another reason he couldn\u0027t bring her along. \"Alright. Then, I\u0027m heading off to a dungeon.\" \"Ok. I\u0027ll get it done, no matter what...!\" [Paul Zero, if you ever want to see me, just use the branch to contact me!] Lee Shin Woo parted with the greatly disappointed girl and spirit and left his residence. But when he got atop Jin and went towards their designated location, a shadow shrouded in darkness appeared. [I\u0027ll go to the capital, Master. I apologize for not being able to stay by your side and protect you.] \"I\u0027m counting on you. But be careful so you don\u0027t die.\" [I\u0027m receiving the power of the moon so close up, so I won\u0027t die. ...I\u0027ll prepare everything until you reach the capital, Master.] \"Alright. Go ahead.\" [Yes, sir.] Their final party member, Bisher Moon was responsible for \u0027getting things done\u0027. [1] Anything he couldn\u0027t ask Ye Jin Jin or Sinea to do with the golem network\u0027s information, he made Bisher do. He\u0027d given Bisher Moon the most dangerous task of all: entering the capital. Even Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t enter the capital without any prep, so he sent Bisher Moon to the capital to make a foothold for him, as he was proficient in darkness magic and had formidable combat abilities. \u0027To be frank, he\u0027s more of a substitute, but... He said it himself, that he wouldn\u0027t die, so he should be fine.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t really confident that Bisher Moon would be able to accomplish anything there, but... more importantly, Rem\u0027s golem network was approaching the capital, so he wouldn\u0027t end up empty handed regardless. If all went well, then his position in the Magic Empire would be set, with the help of the Sun God religion and Bisher Moon... Lee Shin Woo stopped deluding himself and raised his head. Now it was really time for him to conquer a dungeon. \"It\u0027s time to act once more, if for no other reason.\" Time flew by and 2 more weeks passed with Lee Shin Woo acting as the Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay. During that time, the Sun God religion\u0027s plan had indeed borne fruit. His name had spread far and wide, like a fire spreading across a field of grass. His initial dungeon conquest wasn\u0027t very effective, like using a fire move on a water type pokemon. But due to the Sun God religion\u0027s positive publicity, as well as him conquering two or three dungeons, something no one had ever done before, it became super effective, like a fire move being used against a grass and bug type. \"You\u0027ve conquered two level 5 dungeons and three level 6 dungeons... I trusted in your abilities, but you truly are amazing. Due to your efforts, several cities have been saved.\" \"Still, I think we\u0027re fanning the flames a bit too much.\" The Pope held a bottle of Kerr Century Elemental 451 in one hand and held a glass of the wine in the other. He tightly gripped the glass and sighed. He could see several people in the streets yelling the Sun God hero, Kay\u0027s name. \"Sir Kay saw us!\" \"The Sun God\u0027s hero! The Sun God is watching over him!\" \"Bless you, Sir Kay! Glory to the Sun God!\" \"Kay! Kay! Kay! Kay!\" There were tens of thousands of people crowding around his lodgings; so many of them chanted his name that their voices overlapped unpleasantly, making it sound like an anthem of sorts. Lee Shin Woo was freaked out and went back inside as if running away from it. He\u0027d come to this city a week ago. The city had prepared for the worst, due to level 6 dungeon countercurrent, but Lee Shin Woo happened to be there. After he\u0027d informed them of the Sun God religion\u0027s intent, he quickly cleared the dungeon and then left the aftermath to the Sun God religion\u0027s promotional unit. He then went on to the next dungeon, but once he came back, things had intensified. \"I can understand if you consider the fact that they\u0027re all alive because of me, but... it\u0027s like a religion.\" \"It is a religion. The Sun God must be so proud of you.\" \"It seems like they\u0027re worshipping me, not the Sun God.\" \"You don\u0027t need to worry about that. Since their faith in you will soon become their faith in the Sun God. It\u0027s becoming like that in other areas as well.\" All that the weakened Sun God religion had left was their believers and their worn-out honor! They would be able to sway public opinion with those two elements and the Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay. As the Pope had told him, Kay\u0027s actions would help increase their influence, which in turn, would create new religious belief. It was only possible because it was the Sun God religion. \"...So how is it going on the inside (of the religious order)?\" \"Hoo. Hoo.\" Lee Shin Woo said whilst narrowing his eyes, and the Pope laughed meaningfully and gave a thumbs up. He wanted to smack him, but he managed to stop himself. \"The best decision I\u0027ve ever made was picking you.\" \"You should be facing resistance from the other religious orders, as you\u0027re charging ahead so quickly. The Emperor won\u0027t look at this favorably either.\" \"We\u0027re looking after the people. Although we\u0027re spicing it up a bit, who\u0027s going to stop us? Even if they try to stop you now, the people will fight back. They won\u0027t do something as stupid as fighting against their own people.\" \"Moreover,\" the Pope said and then added. \"You\u0027ve been recognized as a Saint by our order, but it\u0027s ultimately just an honorary position. You can move more freely because you\u0027re not officially a part of our order. In other words, no one can stop you using religious rules, obligations, or duties as an excuse.\" \"But it\u0027s because I\u0027m unofficially a part of the Sun God religion that the order\u0027s fame keeps growing.\" \"Exactly. Moreover, you\u0027re a Saint recognized by the Pope himself, so no one has higher authority than you.\" To think he got all the advantages but didn\u0027t have to take any responsibility. His honorary position differed significantly from his own understanding of honorary positions, but he didn\u0027t have any complaints. \"But that\u0027s too much. Do you think I can return to Kuroa\u0027s Glory some time tomorrow?\" \"Ah, now that you mention it, it\u0027s tomorrow.\" The Pope said nonchalantly and stretched out a hand towards Lee Shin Woo. His hand was now freed of the wine bottle, as it was empty and rolling on the floor. \"Before the auction\u0027s over, sell me another bottle of wine at the special price.\" \"That\u0027s all for today, folks! Please tune in for the next episode!\" He was tired in a variety of ways, but he had to put in even more energy tomorrow. Since tomorrow was the day of the wine auction.
