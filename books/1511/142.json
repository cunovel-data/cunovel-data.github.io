Level 7 - 4\u003e Once Lee Shin Woo reached level 7, he was able to more easily control the surrounding mana through his mana breathing ability. \"Shin Woo, you\u0027ve finally become a catalyst!\" \"Nah. I\u0027m not at that level yet...\" Kratia insisted that Lee Shin Woo\u0027s body had become a catalyst and was even happier about it than him, but Lee Shin Woo calmly denied her assertion. Of course, his level up had drastically increased his control over mana, and he was somewhat able to draw and use the ambient mana around him. But after testing it out a few times, he realized that he wasn\u0027t able to replicate Kratia\u0027s Catalyst Magic yet. \"But you\u0027ll get there eventually. Let\u0027s study together.\" \"Nah, I\u0027m not the studying type. I\u0027ll try to figure it out in the field.\" \"Tch...\" Kratia\u0027s eyes became really sullen. She was so mature when they had first met, yet she seemed to act younger and younger as time went on. Was that just his misunderstanding? It was probably proof that she was opening up to him, but it honestly made him feel a bit uncomfortable. \"Well, we\u0027ll be going now.\" \"See you later. I\u0027ll make sure to give you updates.\" \"I\u0027m counting on you.\" Lee Shin Woo touched Huginn\u0027s Eye for the last time, but he received a message that his Bone Reinforcement skill wasn\u0027t at a high enough level yet to absorb it. He\u0027d checked when he first stole the artifact and carried it out of the facility, but despite his level, as well as Bone Reinforcement\u0027s level increasing, it was still beyond his reach. \"Is it a higher rank than the Bone Gate...?\" \"Your compatibility must not be great. If there comes a day that you can absorb this, then...\" \"I\u0027ll leave it with you until that day comes.\" \"Ok.\" Finally, Lee Shin Woo gave Kratia a soft embrace and left the base with Jin. Rem came along with them of course. \"Shin Woo, you haven\u0027t equipped your gear.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s right. I\u0027d forgotten that my gear was unsummoned as my body changed from the level up.\" In the process of leveling up, his gear was released. Right now, Lee Shin Woo’s face had returned to that of a skeleton, but it was much whiter than when he had been a level 6, and even looked a bit transparent. It was proof that he was becoming more like mana. He would elicit a response like \u0027H-He\u0027s strong!\u0027 from anyone now, as he looked like such a powerful skeleton. Lee Shin Woo was fine traveling like this, but Jin urged him to wear his gear, so he summoned and equipped it. It seemed like his equipment had improved as well, perhaps because Bone Armory had gone up to level 9. \"You don\u0027t need to go to the shop this time?\" \"Mm, I\u0027d like to sell my wine, but...\" That wasn\u0027t all. He didn\u0027t know this was how it would turn out, but because he killed tens of thousands of monsters, and level 7 elites as well, he\u0027d amassed a fortune of 100 million Perium. He wanted to chat with Pleine and go shopping, but... \"God told me something before I left her garden last time. That I should try saving my secret shop permits.\" \"Ah, I think she told me that too. So how many do you have?\" Jin did his job as a hero, same as Lee Shin Woo, but because all of his permits were passed onto him, Lee Shin Woo currently possessed 18 permits. It wasn\u0027t exactly unexpected, but it was still a ridiculous amount. \"But Shin Woo, you can share the effects of the permits with people in a contract with you. If that\u0027s the case, then if all the other heroes were to form their own partnerships, then wouldn\u0027t they be able to amass permits really quickly?\" \"It seems like it\u0027s not that easy to form a contract as we did.\" \"Yeah, I suppose so...\" He hadn\u0027t really known before, but Lee Shin Woo was able to form contracts because of his darkness mana. Moreover, if the two parties don\u0027t trust each other completely, then it\u0027ll be difficult to form a contract between them; even Prince, who likes Lloyd so much, hadn\u0027t gone beyond just friendship, so it was understandable. \"Now that I think about it, I wonder if Prince leveled up.\" \"You\u0027re about to go into the chatting channel again, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027d also like to see how everyone is doing. Plus, I want to make sure that Prince didn\u0027t say some weird stuff about me. Oh, and I\u0027m counting on you to take us to our destination.\" \"You asshole...\" Lee Shin Woo had reached level 7, but Jin was still level 6. Thus, rather than rushing into the level 4 danger zones, they decided to clear the level 3 danger zones that they hadn\u0027t gone to yet. And if it were at all possible, untrodden land that hadn\u0027t been found by the heroes yet. His main priority was to avoid Ethan Cruz at all cost. \u0027I know now. Ethan Cruz is level 8.\u0027 He hadn\u0027t been entirely sure when he had watched him from afar, but he\u0027d figured it out after meeting with the level 8 Archmage. He could sense something in common amongst the Archmage, Arema Steelworker, and Ethan Cruz. Their domination over magic. \u0027When I leveled up, I just barely learned how to subjugate the ambient mana around me, but... those guys are doing it passively.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo recalled Ethan\u0027s black aura and shook. Level ups raised the level of one\u0027s \u0027existence\u0027, and thus, one could more naturally control mana. Everyone had this in common, regardless of what their karma was. \u0027Hoo, I still have a long way to go. I have to work even harder...!\u0027 Lee Shin Woo not only understood this but also possessed the power to dominate mana as a level 7. If a level 8 were to hear about this, then they would pass out while screaming, but unfortunately, only Lee Shin Woo was unaware of what exactly he had achieved. Although he possessed the ability to dominate mana like Ethan Cruz and had figured out that Ethan was level 8, he gave himself a rough assessment, which was so like Lee Shin Woo. \u0027But why is he killing other heroes if he\u0027s level 8? Damn it, he should just go straight to the capital...\u0027 They had a level 8 hero on their side, so why did they have to be wary of him? That fact pissed him off, and he entered the chatting channel. However. [Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.] [Ye Jin Jin: Oh, you\u0027re here! Mr. Shin Woo, I have a lot of questions for you! A lot!] [Yasunori Akira: I heard, Lee Shin Woo!] [Lloyd H.K.: How did you already...] [Mentes Orun: It\u0027s all luck. Luck I say.] [Silene Viesa: Senior! You\u0027re so cool!] [Ethan Cruz: Ooh, I was waiting for you. Our super rookie, Lee Shin Woo!] The moment he entered the chatting channel, he was bombarded by voice messages, which completely rid him of any list of to-dos, Ethan Cruz, or the issue with the Archmage. [Lloyd H.K.: You... We all heard. You temporarily teamed up with Prince. Plus...] Lee Shin Woo realized at that moment. Prince had told them everything in such a short period of time. Of course, she had promised not to tell anyone about his abilities, but there was no provision stating that she couldn\u0027t say anything about his level! Damn it! [Ye Jin Jin: I heard that Kratia is really beautiful and her chest is really big! Why didn\u0027t you tell me that you made a new \u0027friend\u0027? No, wait, where are you right now? Are you with her right now?] No matter how he thought about it, he had no choice but to think of her as a necrophiliac, as she continuously bombarded him with questions. [Yasunori Akira: Level 7... You\u0027re really level 7? Hoo, I\u0027d thought that you would level up quickly, but this is... it\u0027s quite surprising.] [Lloyd H.K.: To think you\u0027re level 7. Even I just got there... There\u0027s no way Prince is lying, but you\u0027re really...] [Erian Ruparte: How exactly did you... Even then, you were a lower level than me...] There were some who were shocked by his level and didn\u0027t know how to respond as well. [Mentes Orun: Did you receive a growth acceleration skill from God? I heard that there was a hero like that before, but I didn\u0027t think that you\u0027d have one too. I\u0027m happy. And I\u0027m truly thankful, Junior.] [Silene Viesa: You\u0027re so cool, Senior! I heard that you killed an elite monster that was a higher level than you! She said it seemed like you were used to it... You really are cool! I really look up to you!] They didn\u0027t even think to ask about how he had reached level 7, and there were some who were just happy about his level up. [Ethan Cruz: You really... You really surprised me. My heart\u0027s pounding. Haha, you\u0027re a really cool junior.] Ethan was like a venomous snake that was licking its lips (at least, that\u0027s what Lee Shin Woo felt). Lee Shin Woo sighed and spoke. He had to somehow smooth out this situation. [Lee Shin Woo: A lot happened in a short period of time, so...] [Lloyd H.K.: A lot happened? \u0027A lot happening\u0027 doesn\u0027t explain this, you rascal.] [Yasunori Akira: You must\u0027ve risked your life. Probably... a countless number of times. I thought you were a calm and cautious guy, but you\u0027re actually more reckless than anyone. But you won and survived, so I can\u0027t really criticize you...] [Erian Ruparte: I\u0027d like to ask you something. Perhaps... At that time, when I told you to run away from one of the 12 general\u0027s troops, did you...] [Lee Shin Woo: ...Haha.] [Erian Ruparte: As I thought. I feel embarrassed that I assumed you were at my level. Could you please forgive me?] Lee Shin Woo replied as humbly as he could to move on, but it was impossible. Everyone thought Lee Shin Woo was a monster who went around risking his life! What was most infuriating was that there was nothing wrong with what they were saying. This is why he had tried hiding his level! No, there was no way he would have been able to hide his level forever, so he knew that he would have to reveal it someday. Because his Disguise skill had leveled up a fair bit, he thought it\u0027d be ok to tell them, but someone else revealing his level was different from he himself doing it! [Lee Shin Woo: I was just really lucky. As you said, Senior Yasunori, I risked my life several times. Senior Prince also helped quite a bit as well.] [Prince Altania: Hmph, of course I did. There\u0027s no way you could\u0027ve done it without me.] She chose to shamelessly appear at that moment. Lee Shin Woo promised that he\u0027d spank her later when they met again. [Lee Shin Woo: Senior, were you able to get to level 7?] [Prince Altania: Of course I did. Who do you think I am? From now on, call me Archmage Prince. Kratia\u0027s no match for me now.] [Lee Shin Woo: Of course, Archmage Prince.] It seemed like she\u0027d completely recovered from the damage she\u0027d sustained from encountering the Archmage. Even though there was a part of her that was cocky, that cockiness allowed her to bounce back quickly. As expected, she was indeed a hero. [Ethan Cruz: Anyhow, now... Lloyd, it might be time for us to take on one of the 12 generals.] At that moment, the chatting channel froze. Only Lee Shin Woo could tell what his true intentions were, and soon, the other heroes responded explosively. [Lloyd H.K.: Are you sure, Senior!?] [Ethan Cruz: Yeah. You reached level 7 just a little while ago, and both Prince and Lee Shin Woo have become level 7, so... We still need to be careful, but we should go looking for one of the weak ones who doesn\u0027t have that many troops.] [Lloyd H.K.: Senior, I\u0027d like to participate!] [Prince Altania: The 12 generals... I-I\u0027d like to participate as well!] [Mentes Orun: Ethan, you...] [Ethan Cruz: Will you fight with us, Mentes?] [Mentes Orun: ...Tch.] It wasn\u0027t a good development. Of course, Lee Shin Woo also wanted to take down the 12 generals, but this was all part of Ethan\u0027s plan, so everything was taking a turn for the worst. Only he could tell exactly what Ethan was planning. Indeed, Ethan was definitely planning on \u0027harvesting\u0027 them now. He\u0027d already experienced this before, so he knew exactly what he was thinking. [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027d like to participate as well, Senior. I\u0027ll tell Kratia as well.] [Ethan Cruz: What a reassuring response. It\u0027ll be some time before we stand on the battlefield, as we still need to locate one of the 12 generals, but during that time, make sure you get used to your new level!] However, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t show any signs of him seeing through Ethan\u0027s plan and naturally accepted his request. At the same time, he lightly tapped Jin and said. \"The plan\u0027s changed. Mm, let\u0027s change directions. I\u0027ll tell you where.\" \"What are we going to do there?\" \"Mm, I was going to start doing this after you got to level 7 too, but... the circumstances have changed.\" The reddish black goblin fire within his eye sockets shined dismally. He was originally going to avoid Ethan until he knew he could beat him, but he couldn\u0027t just eat out of the palm of his hand. Therefore, he had no choice but to take him on. \"If I want to beat a Hero Hunter, then... I need to take down some heroes too.\" Lee Shin Woo said and marked several dots on Jin\u0027s minimap. There they would find undead heroes that weren\u0027t under Ethan Cruz\u0027s command. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t put it off any longer. He would now begin God’s quest in earnest.
