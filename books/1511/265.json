The reason being quite simple.\\n\\n \"We need to find out where the Lich\u0027s life vessel is, but it\u0027s more important that we find out where Seagald is hiding and report it to the Emperor.\"\\n\\n \"Whenever you\u0027re doing something evil, you\u0027re smarter than everyone else, Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, people will misunderstand. Call it a way of survival. You think I\u0027m doing this to save myself? I\u0027m doing this so we can all survive.\"\\n\\n \"You should\u0027ve just kept acting as Paul Zero.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll misunderstand. Ah, I feel a headache coming, so don\u0027t explain it. It\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n Aside from that, they decided what tasks they needed to complete in order to attain victory in the final battle. He decided to focus on improving the Titan (which now used the Demon Heart), creating cores and golems, and repairing the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer, which had broken to pieces in the previous battle.\\n\\n Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo was forced to leave all that to Kratia. But Kratia looked happy to be undertaking that massive workload instead.\\n\\n \"Junior, if Kratia\u0027s busy doing other stuff, then what do I do, since I was learning magic from her? Hmm? Pop some popcorn?\"\\n\\n Most seniors wouldn\u0027t pass this kind of responsibility to their juniors, but that was precisely Prince\u0027s charm; she didn\u0027t even recognize those norms and did away with them.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo patted her head in satisfaction. She acted as if she hated it, but she was actually quite pleased; her image as a senior was completely broken at this point. Seeing that, Kratia looked at her as if she were hopeless and said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got the basics down, so practice by yourself from now on. A real battle would be best.\"\\n\\n \"A real battle, huh... Ah, Senior. Would you like to go to the surface instead?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, really? I can go up to the surface? Really?\"\\n\\n Prince\u0027s eyes widened at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s suggestion. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and explained.\\n\\n \"The only thing we can do here is invade the capital. It\u0027s dangerous outside, so it\u0027s difficult to move freely, right?\"\\n\\n \"If I\u0027m not traveling with you, then yeah... You\u0027re right. I wonder how Lloyd and Erian are doing.\"\\n\\n \"Now that you mention it, you\u0027re right. If they\u0027re hiding in a dungeon, they\u0027ll remain safe, but if they leave... I guess I should explain it to them too.\"\\n\\n The biggest pain in the ass was the heroes not currently present. It was obvious that it would get bloody underground, and if Lee Shin Woo just left the other heroes be, they might die all of a sudden.\\n\\n That\u0027s not all. While Lloyd was level 7 and was thus barely qualified to participate in the final battle, Erian would cling to Lloyd like glue... though he at least needed to know how things were going.\\n\\n And if they wanted to fight together in the final battle, then... it would be best to stop them.\\n\\n \"Then can\u0027t you just send those two to the surface too, Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n \"I thought about that, but I feel like it\u0027s not such a good idea...\"\\n\\n \"What a coincidence. I agree.\"\\n\\n Aside from the fact that Erian was an elf, a species unseen on the surface, Lloyd was the model hero who\u0027d show up in fairytales. If he sent him to the surface, then he\u0027d cause a lot of trouble for him 100%. He might even die faster there than if he were here.\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll leave them be for now. I\u0027ll explain things to them later. Senior Prince, please think about it. If you decide to go to the surface, then I can have Jin Jin help or I can help you do things on your own. I\u0027ve identified several dungeons, and going to the surface is best if you\u0027re looking for rapid growth.\"\\n\\n \"Junior...!\"\\n\\n \"But if you catch the Emperor\u0027s attention, then you will die. He\u0027s level 9.\"\\n\\n \"Junior!\"\\n\\n Prince was tearing up but ultimately decided to go to the surface. If she wanted to get used to the new Fire Demon summoning spell that she\u0027d developed with Kratia and grow, then going to the surface was the best option. There was honestly only one viable option for her.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not planning on invading the capital without me, are you? Right? You saw how strong my Fire Demon was, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. I promise I\u0027ll go with you when the time comes, so please don\u0027t die. More importantly, how many of the 12 Generals are left?\"\\n\\n \"I have an idea. But first, Lee Shin Woo, could you please tell us about all the members of the 12 Generals you\u0027ve killed thus far?\"\\n\\n This time it was Seira. Lee Shin Woo thought back and went down the list one-by-one. Seira and the others were absolutely speechless.\\n\\n \"To think you killed five of them yourself... I had my suspicions, but you really were the one who killed the Beast General! I thought it was strange that the loot was so sparse!\"\\n\\n \"Of course. You should be thankful that I let you finish off the Vulture General. Though I was busy rescuing Lloyd and taking care of Ethan Cruz. Do you guys even realize how close you all were to turning undead then?\"\\n\\n \"Junior, are you some sort of fairytale protagonist? You do all the dirty work and protect everyone. ...That\u0027s pretty cool!\"\\n\\n Seira had ended up killing the Vulture General, but if Lee Shin Woo and Kratia hadn\u0027t prepared their countermeasures so thoroughly, then the fight would\u0027ve been a lot tougher.\\n\\n Normally, Seira shouldn\u0027t have had any trouble taking down a level 7 General by herself, but at the time, she\u0027d been affected by madness, so he didn\u0027t know how it would have actually turned out.\\n\\n \"And as you know, the Spirit General\u0027s on our side now.\"\\n\\n \"Hoo, hoo.\"\\n\\n \"That means that you actually defeated 7 of the 12 Generals... Moreover, you were able to defeat my brother... Seagald and the Archmage as well.\"\\n\\n She looked like she couldn\u0027t believe what she was saying. As humans grew, their karma became personalized to them, which causes them to have certain affinities and weaknesses.\\n\\n The 12 Generals\u0027 abilities varied, so even if you managed to defeat one of them, it also meant that you would likely struggle against another. But it sounded like Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t lose in a one-on-one confrontation with any one of them.\\n\\n \"...And now that I think about it, you\u0027re actually undead, not human.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, don\u0027t forget about the horse.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised that the Mercenary King, Metafel, had reached level 8. If you include him as well, then you\u0027ve defeated three level 8 Generals, and have taken one on as your subordinate.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t finish off Arema myself, but I guess that\u0027s about right.\"\\n\\n Moreover, Lee Shin Woo had begun hunting the 12 Generals ever since he was level 6. Lee Shin Woo explained that he had acquired the Heaven Defying General title himself, and after explaining his achievements, the group had no choice but to acknowledge it.\\n\\n Higher level foes were stronger than you; that was a basic principle in this world. Yet, Lee Shin Woo had ignored that basic principle, so there was no title that fit him better than Heaven Defying!\\n\\n \"But I heard the Emperor appoints the 12 Generals himself? I heard the Emperor could bolster the 12 Generals\u0027 ranks by appointing candidates.\"\\n\\n \"I believe it\u0027s a type of darkness magic that uses the source of darkness. He forcibly bestows the title onto them, which strengthens their karma. That\u0027s how he makes them even stronger. However, there\u0027s a limit to this as well.\"\\n\\n Seira briefly explained how the 12 Generals were appointed (the Magic Emperor used his own magic to appoint his own 12 Generals. In other words, he couldn\u0027t bolster the 12 Generals\u0027 ranks as much as he wanted) and then continued onto the main topic.\\n\\n \"Normally, level 7 or level 8 individuals don\u0027t come out of thin air. The reason the heroes here are so powerful is because they were picked based on their inherent talent. And the fact that so many of your subordinates are level 7 or higher... is something that even I cannot explain, though it likely has something to do with your ability, Lee Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n \"So? There\u0027s no one like that in the capital?\"\\n\\n \"There should be some level 7s in the capital, but I\u0027m absolutely sure that there aren\u0027t any level 8s there. If they had other level 8s, then there wouldn\u0027t have been any level 7 Generals in the first place.\"\\n\\n That made sense. Since the 12 Generals were the Empire\u0027s twelve strongest. Seira continued on.\\n\\n \"Those level 7s are weaker than the original 12 Generals, so even if they were to replace them, they would ultimately be much weaker than the generals you\u0027ve killed thus far. In other words, they aren\u0027t a threat.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a chance that the 12 General candidates grew... Ah, never mind.\"\\n\\n The only reason Metafel Rerdan was able to grow was because he was an Elite Ghoul with the ability to eat others. That, as well as other miracles intertwined, allowing him to reach level 8, but the chance that that would happen to the others was extremely low.\\n\\n \"We only need to worry about the level 8 12 Generals. The others aren\u0027t worth talking about, so you can just ignore them.\"\\n\\n \"I see. First, the Archmage survived...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure what Seagald\u0027s position is, but I do know that at that moment, he\u0027s not on the Emperor\u0027s side. If that\u0027s the case, then there\u0027s only one person left. The last of the Empire\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders, the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman.\"\\n\\n \"Duke Tariman...\"\\n\\n Dana murmured. Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brow, as he felt like he\u0027d heard that name before... He remembered. It was from a memory fragment he gained long ago.\\n\\n \"The owner of the first memories I absorbed... In other words, a level 1 skeleton learned spearmanship from Leofield.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds right. Since he created the spearmanship that the army uses. It\u0027s not an exaggeration to say that the entire army uses his spearmanship.\"\\n\\n Technically, he had learned the basics of how to fight from Leofield. Lee Shin Woo grinned at the strange connection, but Dana sported a serious expression and said.\\n\\n \"But his own spearmanship is far greater than the soldiers\u0027, Hero.\"\\n\\n Was she scared just remembering him? Dana was shaking.\\n\\n \"He specializes in mass murder and was monstrous enough to be able to overwhelm the Annihilation Flame Sword God in a one-on-one confrontation. He\u0027s definitely human, but he\u0027s big enough that he makes you wonder whether he has Giants\u0027 blood mixed in his veins or not. ...And this is the most important part. He\u0027s a complete musclehead, so you can\u0027t reason with him. He might even be dumber than most undead.\"\\n\\n \"Dana, you only compare two things when they\u0027re somewhat similar. That man doesn\u0027t even have a brain. He doesn\u0027t listen to anyone aside from the Emperor... He\u0027s just a combat machine.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s still one of the Four Heavenly Commanders, huh.\"\\n\\n \"Since he\u0027s extremely strong. His spearmanship, which is reinforced by his almost fully mastered wind element, can cut through anything. The other Four Heavenly Commanders avoided fighting him head-on. If I had to pick one person in the Empire who\u0027s mastered martial arts, then I\u0027d have to pick between Seagald Von Retadane and Leofield Von Tariman... But I\u0027d ultimately pick Leofield.\"\\n\\n \"You must be wary of this man. He\u0027s one of the few people that can ruin your plans with just pure strength alone.\"\\n\\n Seira and Dana were in agreement and voiced their concerns regarding the last of the Four Heavenly Commanders. However, Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders after listening to them.\\n\\n \"I feel like I\u0027ll be able to kill him quite easily.\"\\n\\n \"Avoid fighting him head-on at all costs! I know how great your combat skills and your other abilities are, but you cannot beat him in close combat, Hero! You should instead attack him from a distance; throw those exploding weapons at him. No, he might just cut through those explosions...\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the issue here... It\u0027s fine. Just keep explaining the capital\u0027s forces and its facilities.\"\\n\\n Dana stared at Lee Shin Woo as if she were worried about him, but the other women beside her, including Seira, looked at her in displeasure, so she was forced to back off immediately.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was more afraid of this situation than the Heaven Sundering General. But he didn\u0027t say anything so he could make it out of this alive.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-265","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
