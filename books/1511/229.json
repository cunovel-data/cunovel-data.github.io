Sun God\u0027s Hero - 6\u003e\\n\\n Temporarily sealing off the leak went smoothly, as some of the members of the God of Life religion were skilled in sealing magic.\\n\\n Plus, the priests of the other religions supported them with their own skills and magic, so they were able to plug up the hole and prevent the undead curse from leaking. Lee Shin Woo was surprised to see that and was especially surprised at their ability to seal a portion of the curse into a small container with said sealing techniques.\\n\\n \"What a nice ability.\"\\n\\n \"It would\u0027ve been nice if we were a tad bit stronger, but this is our limit. But at the very least, we were able to strengthen the seal with the help of your magic, Sir Kay. Thank you very much.\"\\n\\n The priests of the God of Life religion didn\u0027t respect the Pope, yet they were well-behaved in front of Lee Shin Woo. At this point, they were almost revering him, but Lee Shin Woo decided not to let it bother him. Since his title as the Sun God\u0027s hero wouldn\u0027t be enough to unite all of the surface\u0027s forces in their fight against the undead. However, this was a good enough position to do start on that.\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t forget what happened today. This awful mana... You must not make light of this energy of death. This isn\u0027t something that can be solved by a few sacrifices. We all have to work together.\"\\n\\n \"I agree with Kay. I believe the Sun God sent Kay to us in order to deal with this threat. Please lend us your strength. I promise that each religion will be rewarded appropriately for their deeds.\"\\n\\n The Pope\u0027s attitude wasn\u0027t much different from Lee Shin Woo\u0027s, but there were differences in core areas. His words were swaying all those present, and it was also coaxing the leaders of the three religious orders as well; the three religious leaders nodded their heads.\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Pope. You don\u0027t even need to ask. We trust Sir Kay.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a bit strange to say that we trust him. It\u0027s more precise to say that there\u0027s no reason for someone with such strength to lie to us.\"\\n\\n Hey, wait. It wasn\u0027t just reverence, but a full blown religion! Lee Shin Woo was surprised and went into a cold sweat, as the situation had progressed so smoothly.\\n\\n Yet, the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, bit her lower lip and gazed at Lee Shin Woo. However, she looked at him warmly. Her type (the one who couldn\u0027t hide what they were thinking) was so easy to trick! Of course, Lee Shin Woo was the swindler!\\n\\n \u0027If I can coax her, then I should be able to acquire some information on the other 12 Generals.\u0027\\n\\n Of course, Rem was providing him with general information on them through the golem network, but it would be different to hear it from one of the 12 Generals themselves.\\n\\n Moreover, if things went well, he could learn more about the Magic Emperor as well. If he could, he\u0027d like to know more about the Emperor prior to meeting him.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re thinking about something evil again, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No I\u0027m not.\u0027\\n\\n Initiating a sexual relationship would be best, but... Jin\u0027s gaze was scary, so he decided against it.\\n\\n Looking at her now, he felt like he could control her if he just picked up one of her weaknesses. His relationship with her would go in a different direction from the religious members, which was worsened by the fact that she didn\u0027t think of him as human.\\n\\n \"Then, let\u0027s go back. You\u0027ll be really busy from here on out.\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s to stop the coming catastrophe, then... We\u0027ll do whatever it takes.\"\\n\\n \"...Kuheuk.\"\\n\\n They sealed the hole and were on their way back to the capital. The religions had broken down all barriers and became close. They didn\u0027t speak to the Evileye General or her troops, as if they\u0027d made a promise prior (what\u0027s worse, the soldiers were too weak to even enter the dungeon).\\n\\n They wouldn\u0027t allow the Emperor\u0027s forces to get in their way. Although they wouldn\u0027t be able to exclude the Emperor\u0027s forces in such an important matter, they would only allow them to join once the Emperor had acknowledged his mistake.\\n\\n ...And in the process, the Evileye General would be subject to ridicule. To be honest, they had already considered her a corpse. At that point, Lee Shin Woo quietly spoke to the Pope.\\n\\n \"Pope. Could you please leave her to me?\"\\n\\n \"You... I know you don\u0027t have a lover, but are you really going to go after one of the 12 Generals? I know she\u0027s good-looking and all, but everything else is a trap.\"\\n\\n \"Sir Kay, there\u0027s no need for one such as yourself to desire such a dirty woman! A dog of the royal family is not fit to be by the side of one who can wield a god\u0027s power...!\"\\n\\n \"...Haha.\"\\n\\n The Pope reacting like that wasn\u0027t anything new, but Maria Eldaletz had, at some point, come over and was pissed. Her, the Evileye General, and every other strong young woman he\u0027d met were all the same: they couldn\u0027t hide their feelings. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not why I\u0027m approaching her. You never know what one will do when they\u0027re at risk of death. If possible, I want her to help us. We should be able to help each other out.\"\\n\\n \"...I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ve told you before, but I\u0027d like to say it again. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re not enemies.\"\\n\\n \"As expected of you, Sir Kay. You had such a plan ready...!\"\\n\\n Ah, this won\u0027t do. The Shining Flame\u0027s buff was way too strong, so they took it positively, regardless of what he said! They should be glaring at him instead!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo felt burdened by them and did his best to avoid their gaze. When he locked eyes with the Evileye General, she shrieked and turned her head away from him. Mm, her mental state was so fragile right now that it\u0027d break if he just gave her a slight nudge.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get away from the General following us and then talk.\u0027\\n\\n That would be simple with the use of his Wild Card and Disguise skills. Lee Shin Woo had successfully relayed his message, and the Evileye General, who was at a loss, had cried and accepted his offer. After that, the party reached the capital and the various factions split and went their separate ways.\\n\\n \"Mr. Shin Woo, you came back safely!\"\\n\\n [Paul Zero! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re safe. You\u0027re even stronger than before?]\\n\\n \"Of course I am. Ah... Sorry, but I think things will be even more hectic than before, so stop with the cute act for now. You can do it all you want later. I\u0027d like to hear your report first.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo, having safely returned to his residence within the capital, was met by Sinea and Ye Jin Jin rushing towards him. However, he somewhat cold-heartedly restrained them, and then learned of what had happened while he was away.\\n\\n Transferring the newly born spirits to the Spirits\u0027 Spring was going smoothly due to Sinea and the other spirits\u0027 efforts, but there was a problem with his shop. He had expected this, but someone was openly sabotaging his shop.\\n\\n Not only were there several people messing with his shop, but the key members of the Empire were discreetly aiding the Lawrence shop\u0027s competitors. But because Bisher Moon had mobilized his workers and taken certain precautions, they were able to weather the storm.\\n\\n \"But you should have nothing to worry about soon. Public opinion will side with us, and above all, the other religions will support the Lawrence shop as well.\"\\n\\n \"How did that happen!?\"\\n\\n \"To put it simply... You could see it as all the forces, aside from the Emperor\u0027s, have joined a single team. Since the undead curse isn\u0027t just a threat to us heroes.\"\\n\\n [That\u0027s not simple at all, Paul Zero!]\\n\\n \"Mr. Shin Woo. You\u0027re so amazing...!\"\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t even told him about the innate elements that he\u0027d acquired, yet Sinea and Ye Jin Jin\u0027s eyes were already sparkling. At this point, Lee Shin Woo barely realized that something was off, and as a result of his self-diagnosis, he confirmed that something was indeed wrong.\\n\\n When he leveled up, he gained the innate skill, Wild Card, which was always active. But it turns out that it not only buffed all of his skills, abilities, etc... but also had a hugely positive effect on all of his words and actions! In other words, it had evolved into a cheat skill!\\n\\n \u0027The skill really fits me and my \u0027level\u0027 as a Joker has increased, but still, what the hell is this? It seems like my \u0027level\u0027 as a human has gone down.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo felt a bit down and shook his head, but then, Jin retorted, who was the only one that had remained calm. Since this is something that he needed to hear, he was here too.\\n\\n \"But Shin Woo, do you really need to rely on the shop anymore?\"\\n\\n If Lee Shin Woo added his Dark Shadow to his Disguise skill, then he could reduce Jin\u0027s body to less than half. To be honest, he could do even more, now that he\u0027d acquired Wild Card and Dark Shadow, but he was keeping that for later. Lee Shin Woo needed to prepare himself too.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I don\u0027t really need it since I\u0027ve cemented my position as the hero Kay. But in the future, the Lawrence shop will probably be more beneficial to us than Kay\u0027s name.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"Mm. I\u0027m talking about after we\u0027ve eliminated the curse and have dealt with the trouble on the surface. ...It\u0027d probably be difficult for us to return to our original worlds. So, we have no choice but to continue to live on the surface. You get me thus far, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n The reason Lee Shin Woo was preventing the undead curse from spreading to the surface was not only because he didn\u0027t want his enemies to increase, but mostly because he didn\u0027t want to live in a world filled with death. That would be a stagnant world, unable to move forward! Ye Jin Jin probably thought the same.\\n\\n \"But if we just protect the world, we lose out. I\u0027m protecting this shop so that we have a way to enter the world without using force. Since money and status are the best for living happily in peace. And the shop lets us gain both.\"\\n\\n \"You were thinking that far ahead? ...Then, you must\u0027ve planned for me to be your representative a long time ago.\"\\n\\n Ye Jin Jin seemed to be misunderstanding something and blushed in happiness. Of course, there was no way Lee Shin Woo thought that far ahead. Disguising himself as a merchant and figuring out the surface had gone a lot better than expected, so he\u0027d changed his objective. That\u0027s all!\\n\\n But for some reason Ye Jin Jin was really touched, so he decided to just let her think whatever she wanted.\\n\\n \"In any case, we can just leave the shop as is. So... what about the Red Moon?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re currently fighting against our Moon Shadow.\"\\n\\n That made sense. If Bisher Moon were inside the capital then there was no way he wouldn\u0027t know about Lee Shin Woo\u0027s return. He had felt it was strange that Bisher hadn\u0027t come to see him, but it seemed like he was busy fighting off the Red Moon.\\n\\n \"By the way... Mr. Shin Woo, if we don\u0027t have to worry about the shop from now on, can I fight against the Red Moon too? If we have to move only at night, I can do that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll allow it once you\u0027ve reached level 7. ...Anyway, I plan on going back down soon, so will you be ok?\"\\n\\n \"I thought about it, but there\u0027s a lot more I can do up here than down there. If you\u0027re not here, then I\u0027ll be here in your stead.\"\\n\\n Ye Jin Jin had made her decision. Since she was drinking plenty of medicine because of his trickery, she would soon become strong enough to move around safely without fear.\\n\\n It might be tough on her, as her stats had increased while her skills had not, but her stats should supplement her long-range spear throwing, and if need be, her ability to run away...\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n \"Huh? What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Mm... It\u0027s nothing. Really, it\u0027s nothing.\"\\n\\n The Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel\u0027s eyes would be a good fit for Ye Jin Jin, but it was a little too late to be changing his strategy. After all, he\u0027d decided to use her to gain information on the Emperor.\\n\\n Moreover, Lee Shin Woo had no taste in deliberately killing someone weaker than him, especially when they had no intention of harming him. If she were a monster, he would\u0027ve killed her without any hesitation...\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go to the secret shop later and see if there\u0027re any similar abilities or artifacts... Oh, right.\"\\n\\n At that moment, someone softly knocked on his mansion\u0027s front door. Could he really not become a noble? Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and stood up.\\n\\n \"We have a visitor. A really important one at that.\"\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-229","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
