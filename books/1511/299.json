The Final Stage - 9\u003e\n While the two Emperors staked their lives on their brotherly spat, Lee Shin Woo released the magic circle, allowing him access to the passageway that led to the cave where the source of darkness was stored!\n What\u0027s surprising was that neither Jissehanu nor Jirold had noticed him doing so! His Annihilation Flame was plenty overpowered!\n \"It\u0027s quite narrow.\"\n \"It really is. It\u0027s way too narrow.\"\n \"...Hey, you sound excited.\"\n \"Nope, not at all. I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n The two entered the cave. The cave was incredibly dark and was narrow enough that a person would find it difficult to pass through; therefore, Lee Shin Woo and Jin were forced to stick right next to each other.\n Lately, Jin became noticeably excited whenever they engaged in \u0027skinship\u0027. Because she was currently in a form that closely resembled her human self, he couldn\u0027t help but feel anxious. But he supposed that that wasn\u0027t really important right now.\n \"This is all Evil Eye (ore).\"\n \"So that\u0027s why you\u0027re picking all of the ore and feeding it to your Titan Core. That\u0027s all well and good, but weren\u0027t you the one who said we should hurry?\"\n Not only were the cave walls lined with ore that was suffused with thick darkness magic, but they were all connected to the center of the cave... In other words, they were connected to the source of darkness. And if one were to enter this cave without permission, then the one in charge of this cave... The Emperor, would know they were here.\n But because Lee Shin Woo had maxed out his darkness element, he could completely ignore it and feed all the Evil Eye to his Titan Core. It was all too easy for him to hide his activities from the Emperor.\n \"The Titan\u0027s all I can rely on if we find ourselves in a pinch. So long as I have this, we won\u0027t lose.\"\n \"Yeah, yeah, I got it. I wasn\u0027t complaining. Let\u0027s just get going.\"\n Lee Shin Woo had already explained the new Titan to Jin already. When she\u0027d first heard about it, she was worried that it might not even move properly, but Lee Shin Woo had been so excited that she decided to accept it, albeit bitterly.\n \u0027Moreover, he said he needs me to operate the Titan, so... Mm, will it really work? I\u0027m a little happy that he brought me all the way here. ...Err, I guess this really isn\u0027t the time. I really have gone crazy.\u0027\n Jin knew how \u0027severe\u0027 her condition was. This was all Lee Shin Woo\u0027s fault; he\u0027s the one who\u0027d told her that \u0027she could become human again\u0027! So, it wasn\u0027t her fault at all!\n Jin thought to herself, whilst changing her expression again and again. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo became speechless. However, he didn\u0027t point it out. He was busy enough picking the Evil Eye ore from the surroundings and feeding it to the core.\n But good things couldn\u0027t last forever. Everything has an end, and the cave had an end to it as well.\n There was a small clearing at the end of the cave, large enough for them to take a breather, as well as a small bead at the center, which was small enough to fit in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s hand.\n [Lv10 Source of Darkness - Lich Emperor\u0027s Life Vessel]\n \"Holy shit...\"\n \"Is it because there\u0027s a ton of mana in there, even for you? Can you really handle this?\"\n \"To think I\u0027d get in so easily... It doesn\u0027t make any sense. I thought there would be a level 10 Steve here or something!\"\n \"You didn\u0027t come here to screw around, did you!? Did you!?\"\n At this point, she couldn\u0027t tell whether Lee Shin Woo was happy or sad about this! After retorting, she sensed something approaching, so she raised her arm and protected him.\n Her arm was instantaneously covered in dozens of layers of armor! Right after, she caught something, causing the layers of armor to shatter into thousands of pieces. It was a thick spear.\n [As I thought.]\n Followed by a weighty and serious voice resounding throughout the cave. It was a voice he\u0027d heard just a little while ago.\n [My intuition was right all along. To think you\u0027d try to destroy the Empire. It seems like... you\u0027re not the real Archmage. I guess I\u0027ll never be able to look him in the eye.]\n \"...Bro, why are you coming out from there?\"\n He was so astonished that he couldn\u0027t help but retort. He briefly wondered whether he was seeing things or not.\n [Lv8 Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman - Elite Death Knight]\n That\u0027s right. The Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman, blocked their path as if he were protecting the source of darkness.\n [My intuition\u0027s always been good. It\u0027s as if the wind spirits are whispering in my ears whenever there\u0027s danger... Whenever I sensed danger, all I needed to do was follow those whispers.]\n Obviously, there were no such spirits around Leofield.\n [It was the same this time too. Even though there was no mistaking that it was the Emperor speaking and commanding the troops, I felt a sense of déjà vu. Something felt strange; I was sure of it. However, I could not \u0027test\u0027 His Majesty as one of his loyal retainers. I didn\u0027t know what to do, but then... the wind led me here. Just now!]\n He then thrust his spear towards them once more. But this time, Lee Shin Woo blocked it himself. Leofield\u0027s spear and his Death God\u0027s Shining Bone Sword clashed, causing his sword to creak. Yet, he was able to push him back with his blade. Truly a formidable spirit and strength.\n \"The wind led you here...? As I thought, you have an innate element of your own.\"\n To think there was a guy who\u0027d gone with the flow of the second act at the very last minute (everyone having innate elements). Lee Shin Woo was absolutely speechless. He had been so relieved that the Undead Emperor hadn\u0027t had an innate element, yet here he was, facing off against Leofield who had one!\n Following Seagald\u0027s Annihilation Flame and the Archmage\u0027s Dark Space, it was a space-type innate element!\n \u0027Maybe an innate element is a foothold.\u0027\n \u0027God herself wields the time element, so maybe combining time and space is a realm above the gods?\u0027. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s mind briefly focused on that very question. However, the Heaven Sundering General, who\u0027d reached the peak of martial arts, noticed this and thrust his spear to finish him during his lapse of attention.\n Leofield\u0027s spear was surrounded by a wind that could cut through space itself! This thrust was backed by his trained, transcendent body, and his magic!\n \"Anyway... I think you\u0027re misunderstanding something.\"\n [Keuk!?]\n Lee Shin Woo easily repelled Leofield\u0027s thrust. He used his Assimilation skill with Jin, who was standing right beside him, to add her Agility to his own. ...Actually, it wasn\u0027t all because of his Assimilation skill.\n [The Manatization skill has become Lv9, and Health and Magic have increased by 40.]\n And thus, his stats had reached 25,493. He only needed 107 more stat points to reach level 9.\n [What...!? Just a little while ago, you didn\u0027t have such strength...!?]\n \"I made it. Or should I say, I switched it with my overwhelming magic stat.\"\n Lee Shin Woo extended his hand, grabbed onto the spear (which was facing his sword), and forcefully pulled. With Manatization, he had converted his 10,000 or so Magic into Strength, which resulted in... such power that he felt like he could squash an entire mountain, allowing him to easily steal Leofield\u0027s spear away from him.\n [Kuhahk!?]\n \"There.\"\n Leofield\u0027s eyes widened, but Lee Shin Woo just gripped the spear, unconcerned.\n The artifact, which was created by using the most precious metal in the Empire, infused with the Archmage\u0027s magic, and had achieved so many feats with the Heaven Sundering General, as well as transcending its limitations and growing... was futilely crumpled up within Lee Shin Woo\u0027s hand.\n [This can\u0027t be...]\n \"The reason I let you live was because you\u0027re needed on the surface to make the battle look realistic. What am I supposed to do with you now, you blockhead?\"\n [You, you\u0027re not...]\n \"Yep. I\u0027m not afraid of you one bit. Sorry, but you can\u0027t beat me. I guess you could call it a dog\u0027s death.\"\n In the past, Dana and Seira had warned him again and again about the dangers of the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman. Of course, at the time, Lee Shin Woo had just laughed it off.\n And just a short while ago, he could somewhat understand what they were talking about. He was sure that if he were exposed, then it would all be because of this guy. So, he was definitely one scary bastard.\n However, he wasn\u0027t worried about his power; only his intuition. Lee Shin Woo wanted everything to go perfectly, so he\u0027d been wary of him! At the very least, he needed to not be exposed until he had tricked the Emperor!\n [I\u0027ll die a dog\u0027s death, you say...!?]\n \"Yep.\"\n His \u0027play\u0027 was already a success. So even if Leofield were to block his path, if Lee Shin Woo were to use his full power, then... He actually found it quite hilarious that Leofield would be so willing to attack him when he couldn\u0027t even gauge the difference in their strength.\n He wasn\u0027t even level 9, yet he wanted to defeat him? He had mastered three elements, wielded six innate elements, and even had Manatization as well. What a joke.\n \"I don\u0027t even need to use the Titan to beat you. If you wanted to even give me a bit of a hard time, then you should\u0027ve come for me before I killed Seagald. If you came then, you might\u0027ve had a chance. Yeah, you might\u0027ve even taken two of my lives.\"\n [That cannot be. My spear was tempered so that it can be used to protect His Majesty at all times...]\n \"Sorry, but I don\u0027t have time. You\u0027ve really wasted a lot of my time already.\"\n Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t going to listen anymore. At any rate, the target was huge and the space was large. He launched a Shining Bone Sword; piercing through Leofield\u0027s body. Obviously, one of the Heavenly Commanders wouldn\u0027t fall from just one attack. Because of that, he launched twenty more of them, which he\u0027d prepared earlier. It was simple, so long as he used the darkness element\u0027s link ability.\n Then, the Heaven Sundering General obviously disappeared without a trace.\n [You have hunted a member of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman! All contributing heroes gain 50,000,000 Perium and all stats are increased by 100! You have acquired 15 permits to God\u0027s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills has increased significantly!]\n [Through God\u0027s grace, the Invisible Heart skill\u0027s maximum level has increased by 6. The Invisible Heart skill\u0027s level cannot be raised any higher.]\n [You have not yet met the conditions for a level up. You must prove that you are worthy of the karma that you have chosen.]\n Ah, as he thought. He\u0027d definitely reached the 25,600 stat benchmark, yet he hadn\u0027t leveled up! This was the first time he\u0027d ever experienced this, so he was a bit perplexed, but he could understand why it happened.\n He\u0027d been gaining stats so quickly! On the contrary, he was more surprised that he hadn\u0027t gone through any obstacles when leveling up in the past. But it was ok. He could still win with ease.\n \"You... just now...\"\n \"Ah, you mean killing him? It was easy since I stole his weapon and attacked while he was confused.\"\n \"Is it really that simple?\"\n \"That\u0027s the truth, so how else can I explain? I already told you how to take advantage of your opponent\u0027s openings, right?\"\n \"You...\"\n If he were acting whilst fighting, then no one would be able to distinguish between his truth or lies. Then again, it was because he had the proper abilities to support his acting that made it so flawless.\n Because he was far stronger than the Heaven Sundering General, his bluffs were more effective than usual. The Heaven Sundering General could do nothing but lay down and die. Truthfully, his dramatic actions had confused the Heaven Sundering General and prevented him from moving; and he was soon able to strike him down.\n Even so, Jin wasn\u0027t able to comprehend what he\u0027d done, even though she had been watching from right beside him. She was shocked by the sequence of events spanning a few seconds, as well as how naturally and quickly he\u0027d killed the Heaven Sundering General.\n \"Shin Woo, you\u0027re really...\"\n \"You can talk all you want later. Let\u0027s focus on what\u0027s in front of us.\"\n Lee Shin Woo focused on the burst of mana that he felt from outside. As expected, the Heaven Sundering General dying inside here had let Jissehanu know that there was an intruder. Thus, he tried to get over here immediately, but Jirold had seized that opportunity and counterattacked, turning the tides.\n This wasn\u0027t good. If Jirold managed to kill Jissehanu, then he\u0027d appear right in front of them!\n \"Hey, can\u0027t you just use the Titan to kill both Jirold and Jissehanu...?\"\n \"You never know! What if, after killing them, a level 10 Steve shows up!\"\n \"You really like Steve, don\u0027t you!?\"\n Jin threw a fit, yet she readied herself to protect him anyway. In the midst of this, Lee Shin Woo finally placed his hand on the life vessel. Then, a huge, a truly huge amount of mana flooded his body.\n \"Ugh...\"\n Lee Shin Woo could feel it.\n That this wasn\u0027t something he could just absorb.\n That he was totally screwed.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-299","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
