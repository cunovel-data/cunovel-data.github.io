The Call of Death - 6\u003e\\n\\n Two minutes had passed since they began to fight in earnest. The Beast General, who had transformed into a Thorn Werewolf, was taking hit after hit from the two heroes.\\n\\n \"Disappear!\"\\n\\n \"Huoooooh!\"\\n\\n [Thorn... Kuaaahk! To think you\u0027d cut through my technique!]\\n\\n Although he could continuously attack and mend himself by controlling his bones, the two heroes\u0027 attacks would break his bones as soon as he made the attempt! Retadane and Lee Shin Woo attacked as one, resembling that of a lightning storm.\\n\\n [You bastards are... Kuahk! I am...! Kuahk! I\u0027ll kill you with my own hands... Kehehk!]\\n\\n \"Huooooh!\"\\n\\n \"How dare you turn my seniors into undead? I\u0027ll never forgive you!\"\\n\\n \u0027Yes, what lively acting.\u0027\\n\\n Retadane gripped her flail, attacking like a berserker, and just let out a strange battle cry. Lee Shin Woo supported her, as her strikes left her with a lot of openings, and together, they pushed the Beast General back. He continued to act as though he were a hero with a strong sense of duty. Seeing that, Jin nonchalantly accepted it and pretty much knew what Lee Shin Woo was doing.\\n\\n \"Senior, I\u0027ll go a bit faster!\"\\n\\n \"Alright... Let\u0027s make sure we kill him here and now!\"\\n\\n What\u0027s worse, their attacks intensified the more time went on, and the explanation for that was simple. Although they had never worked together before, they had seen each other\u0027s techniques and movements throughout the battle and were able to more precisely work together because of it! The fact that they were able to move as one in that short period of time showed just how talented the two of them were.\\n\\n [Die!]\\n\\n The Beast General realized that at this rate the situation would turn unfavorable for him, so he punched anxiously. His bone thorn covered bone fist instantly swelled in size and approached Retadane!\\n\\n \"Oh no you don\u0027t!\"\\n\\n However, she didn\u0027t back off an inch and took his attack head on. Her flail, infused with her light magic, clashed against his fist, causing an explosion!\\n\\n The light was so intense that it would blind a high level hero, albeit for a short period of time, and simultaneously, the light spread. However, Lee Shin Woo could make decisions and move without sight, so he boldly ran into the diffused light and swung his sword.\\n\\n \"Heup!\"\\n\\n [Keuk!?]\\n\\n Although the Beast General\u0027s multi-layered bone armor blocked the majority of his strike, a lightning bolt was discharged from the blade, striking the Beast General\u0027s main body. An attack befitting the name of Breath of the Lightning God. However...\\n\\n \u0027...Huh?\u0027\\n\\n The moment his attack worked, Lee Shin Woo felt cold and stood still. It was because he couldn\u0027t feel any resistance whatsoever. The Beast General had used the force of his blow to push himself backwards and retreat.\\n\\n To escape? No way. Even if he tried to run, he wouldn\u0027t be able to get away from Retadane and Lee Shin Woo on such a crowded battlefield. He was probably just trying to buy a bit of time. Yeah... about 2 seconds worth.\\n\\n [That really hurt... Let me return the favor!]\\n\\n With those two seconds he\u0027d bought, Jilun Pelta used his most powerful skill. The bone thorns all over his body dropped to the floor, as if he were connecting to the planet itself.\\n\\n [This is the power of the Beast General! Witness, and die!]\\n\\n Immediately after, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of five meter long sharp, sharp bone thorns sprouted from the ground simultaneously. He had surrounded them perfectly, so that none could escape!\\n\\n They weren\u0027t simple thorns either. Each and every thorn contained a high concentration of darkness magic; they were wicked thorns that threatened to pull one in, stab them, or bind them. This was the Beast General\u0027s (who had become a Thorn Wolf) most powerful technique and magic. And he called it...\\n\\n [This is my Garden of Thorns...!]\\n\\n \"Tch!\"\\n\\n If Retadane were level 7, then she might\u0027ve died right here. Without even considering their power, the speed at which the thorns moved was much too fast, and their area of effect was much too wide!\\n\\n However, once she had become level 8, she had become able to perceive and dominate the mana around her, so the moment she sensed a bizarre mana coming from under her, she created a light shield and was able to protect herself.\\n\\n Light magic was the magic of severing. The moment the thorns touched the shield, their link to the Beast General was severed; they then returned to pure mana and dispersed into the air. The thorns that hadn\u0027t touched the shield attempted to surround her, but those were also taken care of soon after.\\n\\n [Kuaht!?]\\n\\n Her light magic affected Jilun Pelta\u0027s main body as well, causing him to stumble. For just a moment, his eyes were filled with fright. Lee Shin Woo realized that light magic was the most frightening type of magic for all undead, no, to all beings that existed. On the other hand, Retadane seemed relaxed.\\n\\n \"Did you really think you\u0027d be able to hurt me with that?\"\\n\\n [Retadane, your power\u0027s not a good match for mine. Well, that\u0027s fine. I took one down, so no matter how much you struggle, you won\u0027t be able to best me... Huh?]\\n\\n That\u0027s right. This attack wasn\u0027t meant to kill Retadane. It was done to escape this unfavorable 2-on-1 situation and take down the one he assumed to be weaker, the level 7 Lee Shin Woo!\\n\\n When a hero died, they would be resurrected as an undead, so now it would be a 2-on-1 in his favor. At least, that\u0027s what he had been expecting. He looked at Lee Shin Woo and...\\n\\n [He\u0027s not there...?]\\n\\n \"...I guess he was able to get out in one piece.\"\\n\\n No matter how great her light magic was, Retadane wasn\u0027t skilled enough to cover both herself and Lee Shin Woo in that short period of time. Because of that, she was nervous that she might\u0027ve lost a comrade, but now that she got a chance to look around, Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t there anymore.\\n\\n \u0027He was definitely influencing the mana around him with his breathing before... I don\u0027t know how that\u0027s even possible with a level 7 body, but it\u0027s not surprising that he was able to sense the incoming attack and avoid it.\u0027\\n\\n Indeed, it was possible for one to avoid the Beast General\u0027s attack, but in here, there was only so long one could do so. He had probably assumed as such and had retreated.\\n\\n It was a really smart decision. The giant thorns covered the battlefield, as though it were field magic, and the effects of the Garden of Thorns were still active. If he had hung around, then he would\u0027ve been caught by the giant thorns and gotten in her way, but the fact that he\u0027d left at the right time was also helpful to her.\\n\\n \u0027It kind of bothers me that I\u0027m taking all the credit when we fought him together, but... I suppose I just need to pay him back for all that he did.\u0027\\n\\n Around that time, Retadane finished organizing her thoughts and gripped her flail. Her light magic completely encased the iron mace, and its size doubled. She had been using her mana during the battle, but she had enough to overcome the Beast General, who had been battered and used much of his magic to use his most powerful technique.\\n\\n \"You look tired, Jilun Pelta.\"\\n\\n [You do too... You were only able to hit me with that crude iron mace because of that man. You didn\u0027t know? What do you plan on doing now that that man has run away?]\\n\\n \"Hoo. ...I\u0027ll show you.\"\\n\\n Retadane completely ignored Jilun Pelta\u0027s foolish taunt, and closed in on him. The Beast General was inwardly screaming, as he was afraid of her light magic, but on the outside, he sported a calm expression while somehow being able to block her attack. But then...\\n\\n Kwajik!\\n\\n [...Huh?]\\n\\n \"...?\"\\n\\n It was truly instantaneous... It happened even faster than the activation of the Beast General\u0027s Garden of Thorns. Jilun Pelta and Retadane didn\u0027t know how it happened. Although they didn\u0027t know the cause of it, they were definitely able to see the result...\\n\\n Why? All the thorns that comprised the Garden of Thorns simultaneously struck Jilun Pelta. The sight of dozens, hundreds, even thousands of thorns defying their master was truly a gallant and horrendous sight.\\n\\n [What... happened...?]\\n\\n Jilun Pelta\u0027s body shook. He attempted to control the thorns and extract them from his body, but for some reason, it didn\u0027t work. It was truly bizarre. He was definitely the one who created these thorns, so why were they disobeying him? Why were they attacking not his enemies, but him? Moreover...\\n\\n [Why are they even stronger than before...?]\\n\\n \"Keuk!?\"\\n\\n Retadane briefly felt a chill in the air, and quickly backed off. It was a wise decision. The bone thorns that had stabbed the Beast General blew up all at once! The vibration shook heaven and earth, causing Retdane to lose her balance and fall.\\n\\n It was such a loud \u0027BOOM\u0027 that anyone on the battlefield would\u0027ve been able to hear it. And what followed was... a short and clear message that conveyed the truth.\\n\\n [You have hunted a member of the 12 generals, the Lv7 Beast General, Jilun Pelta! All contributing heroes acquire 30,000,000 Perium, and all stats are increased by 100. You have acquired 10 permits to God\u0027s secret shop. Proficiency in all combat related skills has increased dramatically!]\\n\\n \"How is this possible?\"\\n\\n It was the most clear evidence that Jilun Pelta was dead. However, despite her succeeding in taking down one of the 12 generals for the first time since becoming a hero, she wasn\u0027t overcome with happiness, but fear.\\n\\n \"What just happened...?\"\\n\\n The Beast General had been ambushed by his own thorns, and then there was the following explosion of top of it. She hadn\u0027t done any of that. That meant that someone else had killed the Beast General without her noticing, even though she had come to him.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t stop the irrational fear and the curiosity she had. They probably weren\u0027t a hero. There wasn\u0027t anyone amongst the heroes who could do such a thing. It would be impossible for even Ethan Cruz to pull off.\\n\\n Then who was it? Who would\u0027ve been able to secretly blow up the Beast General, and why would someone who wasn\u0027t a hero do such a thing?\\n\\n \"...Could it be?\"\\n\\n At that moment, she felt a name come to mind. A name she heard recently and quite often. One that attacks other undead, who leads a formidable corps, and possesses boundless strength...\\n\\n \"The Heaven Defying General.\"\\n\\n She muttered silently and shook. It was an assumption without a shred of evidence, but the moment she voiced it, she was sure that it was them. The Heaven Defying General must\u0027ve caught whiff of the battle and intervened!\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m scared. I\u0027m really scared... But.\u0027\\n\\n It didn\u0027t change the fact that she would kill them, so long as they were undead. No matter how strong they were, what their character was, or even if she had some sort of deep relationship with them in the past!\\n\\n \"No matter what.\"\\n\\n She gritted her teeth and forced her weary body to stand. Now wasn\u0027t the time to being spacing out. First, she would have to collect the Beast General\u0027s loot, and then rejoin the battle.\\n\\n Retadane ran over to the center of the explosion site. Because so much mana had been exploded, no other monsters appeared. Were they instinctively afraid? If that\u0027s the case, then they weren\u0027t much different from her. Retadane sneered and checked the loot.\\n\\n The Beast General had dropped a level 5 artifact, and tens of millions of Perium, but aside from that, nothing else was there.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-181","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
