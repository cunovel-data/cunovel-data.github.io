Heaven Door\u0027s Key - 1\u003e\\n\\n It had been a long time since he\u0027d last visited the secret shop. Beyond the counter, Pleine placed a spoon inside her bowl, which was filled with huge chunks of meat, and then looked at Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n \"Guten Abend! I was just about to eat. Would you like to eat with me?\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t do that. Since I was tortured by the other heroes.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s right. I forgot... Wait, Mr. Shin Woo, you\u0027re a human right now!?\"\\n\\n After they\u0027d gone through their normal routine (it wouldn\u0027t feel normal without it), Pleine noticed Lee Shin Woo\u0027s appearance and was astonished.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo finally realized that he\u0027d been maintaining his human form all this time, so he deactivated his Disguise skill. Pleine sighed in relief, which was kind of funny.\\n\\n \"I had a suspicion that you could do it, but it really is impressive. Can you eat in that form...?\"\\n\\n \"Please keep this a secret from Jin, but I think I\u0027ll be able to if I level up more.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Disguise skill had infinite potential. To be more specific, the word \u0027Disguise\u0027 didn\u0027t accurately describe the transformation; he could feel the skill\u0027s latent potential.\\n\\n He had a feeling that he, a skeleton, would be able to pass off as a human sometime in the future with his Disguise skill. But he couldn\u0027t really tell anyone, as he wasn\u0027t 100% sure. If he gave someone false hope and it didn\u0027t work, then Jin would feel even more hopeless.\\n\\n \"Well, if it doesn\u0027t work, there are always other options. Anyway, the other heroes motivated me, so I\u0027ve been thinking about a lot of things.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so strange watching you do something you\u0027ve never learned before. What did you do in your original world, Mr. Shin Woo? I heard that magic didn\u0027t exist in that world.\"\\n\\n \"I was just a normal salaryman.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. I understand.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo replied honestly, but Pleine shook her head as if she didn\u0027t believe him. Then, she clapped her hands and changed topics.\\n\\n \"More importantly, congratulations on your consecutive wins against the 12 generals. It seems like you\u0027ve taken care of Ethan Cruz and the other traitors, so let me thank you personally.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But for the time being, the Empire\u0027s going to be in chaos, so it\u0027ll take some time before we can take care of another one of the 12 generals.\"\\n\\n \"You went wild, so I guess it can\u0027t be helped. But it\u0027s not all bad. You knew it was going to happen, didn\u0027t you? It\u0027s good that the heroes were the ones who prompted it.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo silently nodded his head. Yeah, he didn\u0027t know what the other heroes thought, but he believed this battle came out ok.\\n\\n Especially because they forced the Empire, as well as its opposing factions to act... Although it\u0027d become more dangerous from here on out, there were now more pieces he could use on the board.\\n\\n \"But the problem\u0027s whether or not the heroes can adapt to this quickly changing environment...\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re amazing, Shin Woo. You talk about it like it\u0027s someone else\u0027s business. ...Actually, it really isn\u0027t your problem.\"\\n\\n The remaining task was to level up the other heroes ASAP. Those who participated in the battle needed to be strong enough to battle one of the 12 generals one-on-one, and the lowest level newbie heroes, Ye Jin Jin and Silene Viesa, needed to be able to easily take on the highest rank undead, aside from the 12 generals. That would be ideal.\\n\\n Whereas Retadane, who was the strongest amongst them, had huge emotional issues. Fixing that would be his most difficult task...\\n\\n \"Now that I think about it, your little sister came out unscathed. Though her Berserker vibe kind of scared me.\"\\n\\n \"...Ah, you found out?\"\\n\\n \"So you were sisters.\"\\n\\n \"You tricked me!? How cowardly!\"\\n\\n Pleine, who realized she\u0027d been tricked, complained loudly, but Lee Shin Woo realized that he\u0027d been correct, muttered to himself, and nodded his head.\\n\\n He\u0027d had his suspicions when he\u0027d first met Seira Von Retadane, but he hadn\u0027t been able to ask her himself. But since he was close to Pleine, it was easy to get it out of her.\\n\\n \"Keuk, how did you find out? None of the other heroes who\u0027ve met her found out.\"\\n\\n \"You two are alike. I could tell right away.\"\\n\\n \"...We\u0027re alike? That\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard that since I was born. Everyone else said that we were completely different from each other.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo spoke, and her expression became odd. Was she happy that she and her younger sister looked alike? He smiled while watching her, but she suddenly frowned.\\n\\n \"Being compared to her feels really unpleasant. There are things that even you can\u0027t say, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\\n\\n \"!?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s prettier, me or her? Please answer honestly.\"\\n\\n \"P-Pleine.\"\\n\\n \"Good. It doesn\u0027t seem like you\u0027re lying. I\u0027ll forgive this time.\"\\n\\n He felt like his body would break from the pressure of her gaze alone. Of course, he honestly thought Pleine was prettier, but Seira\u0027s body was more his type. However, he wasn\u0027t stupid enough to say that out loud.\\n\\n \"Now then, would you like to see our products? A level 7 bone hasn\u0027t come in yet, but would you at least like to see our gear?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, I didn\u0027t come here to buy anything today. I came here for some advice.\"\\n\\n \"Advice...? Hoo, hoo. If you really wanted to see me so badly, then you could\u0027ve just said so. To be honest, you\u0027re not good enough for me, but if you change your body, then I think you\u0027ll be my type! Good luck!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting mad.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo spoke after she\u0027d politely apologized. He wanted to know more about the secret shop permits.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve gathered 131 secret shop permits.\"\\n\\n \"Come again?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve gathered 131 secret shop permits. Ah, I got the message when I gathered 100 of them though.\"\\n\\n \"Hahaha.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d received that message when he was in the middle of a fight. That\u0027s why he hadn\u0027t looked at it in detail and just passed over it, but after he was done with the fighting, the first thing he checked was what he could do with those 100 hard earned permits.\\n\\n \"The message told me to ask the secret shop.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry? Ask the secret shop? Why is it telling you to come here?\"\\n\\n \"As I thought, this is the first time you\u0027ve heard it too...\"\\n\\n Perhaps Lee Shin Woo was the first one to gather 100 secret shop permits since the secret shop\u0027s inception. He looked at Pleine\u0027s stupefied expression and was sure.\\n\\n Moreover, \u0027ask the secret shop\u0027? When he gathered 10 secret shop permits, he received a message, asking him if he wanted to go to God\u0027s garden. In comparison, this seemed a lot less thought out.\\n\\n \"Uah, you really... Mm. In that case... But still.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s gone crazy.\"\\n\\n Either it wasn\u0027t ready yet, or something would be created. That\u0027s what Lee Shin Woo thought would happen, and he was correct. After all, what more proof did he need? Pleine was flustered and communicating with God. Did she finish speaking with God? She soon got a hold of herself, looked at Lee Shin Woo, and grumbled.\\n\\n \"...You should\u0027ve told me earlier, you damn hag.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that blasphemous? Won\u0027t you get weaker or something?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Shin Woo, we\u0027ve come to a conclusion.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, ok.\"\\n\\n Pleine ignored Lee Shin Woo\u0027s question and moved on.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s never been done before, but... Mm, I think it\u0027ll work. If it\u0027s you and your partner. It can be used by the two of you. Yes, probably.\"\\n\\n \"So what is it?\"\\n\\n \"Hoo... I\u0027ll tell you after I\u0027m done eating.\"\\n\\n Before she continued, Pleine touched the stew on the counter with one finger and heated it. Then, she scarfed it down right before his very eyes. She was really going at it, yet Lee Shin Woo still felt some dignity from it, which surprised him even more.\\n\\n \"Hoo. Hoooo....\"\\n\\n She had finished eating within a minute. Was it too hot? Her eyes were slightly teary. If she knew that was going to happen, then she shouldn\u0027t have heated it again.\\n\\n \"Now I\u0027ll tell you. By using 100 secret shop permits, you gain permission to go to the surface. Of course, it\u0027s not a one-way trip, but a round-trip. It doesn\u0027t sound like a bad idea to take a breather at the surface since the Underground Empire\u0027s in chaos right now.\"\\n\\n \"...What!?\"\\n\\n \"I said you could go to the surface. You\u0027re the first hero to do so. And you\u0027ll probably be the last.\"\\n\\n He had somewhat anticipated this. However, he didn\u0027t think it\u0027d actually be possible. Lee Shin Woo continued to stare at her, dumbfounded, but that wouldn\u0027t make her explain any further. There were several things that concerned him, but he would have to figure that all out on his own.\\n\\n \"What will you do, Mr. Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n \"...If I can, I\u0027d like to go there immediately. Let\u0027s go now.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. Then let\u0027s call over your partner, Jin Taylor, first. It\u0027s quite easy because of your deep connection.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Wooâ€™s tone was serious as he gave the okay. However, Pleine replied nonchalantly, as if she\u0027d expected him to say that, and flicked her hand. He heard a refreshing sound, and right after, Jin appeared right next to him.\\n\\n \"Huh? What\u0027s going on? Why am I here?\"\\n\\n \"If you have some unfinished business in the Underground Empire, then please tell me now. You can leave right away if that\u0027s what you want.\"\\n\\n \"Leave? To where? What\u0027s going on, Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n \"Apparently, we\u0027re going to the surface. I\u0027ll explain the details later.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was having trouble processing all this, so he couldn\u0027t explain it to Jin right now. For the time being, he needed to listen to Pleine. He briefly used his head. The Paul Zero Corps would be in a safe location and everything else...\\n\\n \"Could I bring a small bird with me? It\u0027s a golem.\"\\n\\n \"A golem? Ah, that one\u0027s connected to you as well, Mr. Shin Woo. Alright. It\u0027ll cost you 30 more secret shop permits for the round trip.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you just steal them!?\"\\n\\n \"Hoo. It\u0027s not something under my control. I\u0027ll summon it for free, so don\u0027t hate me so much.\"\\n\\n Soon, Rem was summoned into the secret shop as well. Rem wasn\u0027t flustered at all and just perched atop Lee Shin Woo\u0027s shoulder, a severe contrast to Jin\u0027s reaction to the summon.\\n\\n \"Then, you\u0027re all set now, right? I\u0027ll start right away.\"\\n\\n \"Please.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo rode atop Jin after Rem had perched on his shoulder. He had barely adapted to the Underground Empire yet he was going to the surface now. He didn\u0027t know what would happen, so he prepared himself to be ready for a fight at any moment. Riding atop Jin was one of those preparations.\\n\\n \"Hoo... I\u0027m starting!\"\\n\\n Pleine left the counter and stretched her hands towards the empty floor. Lee Shin Woo felt all his secret shop permits flow into Pleine. The more that flowed into her, the brighter the light shined from underneath them, until it formed an extremely powerful holy magic circle...\\n\\n [The Lv8 Bone Gate is activating.]\\n\\n \"...Huh?\"\\n\\n At that moment, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s bone ring flew off. Pleine, who was performing the ritual, as well as Lee Shin Woo were surprised and watched. Then, the bone ring swelled in size and stuck to the luminescent floor. And...\\n\\n [The Bone Gate is absorbing the magic circle.]\\n\\n [The Bone Gate has evolved to Lv9.]\\n\\n A miracle happened, one that even God hadn\u0027t expected.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-191","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
