Then, he and his party left the wine factory and traveled to the Metal Army\u0027s base.\\n\\n If he hadn\u0027t acquired the administrator seal and been to their base before, then he wouldn\u0027t have been able to lead them into the chaos; and if that happened, he would\u0027ve had to work that much harder to lower the Imperial Army and the Anti-Skull\u0027s forces.\\n\\n \"Moreover, it\u0027s because of that that we got ourselves such a nice facility.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s really not the way a human being thinks.\"\\n\\n \"Wow. I didn\u0027t know you could use golems like this...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really satisfied.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s quite vast. To think they built and operated a hidden facility like this...\"\\n\\n They had taken the golem train and arrived at the Metal Army\u0027s base. While the younger generation of heroes looked around, as if fascinated, Seira and Dana were absolutely speechless.\\n\\n Of course, they realized by now that Arema Steelworker was a spy from the surface, but they hadn\u0027t expected such an expansive facility being run under the entire Empire in the past; even when the Underground Empire was still thriving.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because of this that they were able to move so covertly.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised you were able to recreate that seal or what not, Hero. It\u0027s not easy to do, even for a magician.\"\\n\\n The Empire had the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, but even he wasn\u0027t able to find this base. This base had existed for far too long for him to blame it on them becoming undead. Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \"Now that you mention it, I feel like it\u0027s because of my innate ability. Ah, using Bone Reinforcement on the golems helped too, since it lets me look at them closely.\"\\n\\n \"I see. It\u0027s a combination of your talent and your disposition.\"\\n\\n \"Makes sense. Let\u0027s take a look, starting from the outside.\"\\n\\n They passed the golem train terminal and first encountered a long, outside corridor. There were a few huge rooms and warehouses, but all of them were empty.\\n\\n He assumed that they were originally filled with his troops: level 6 golems. They were, of course, in his Chi Pauls\u0027 bellies now.\\n\\n \"But this shouldn\u0027t be all there is.\"\\n\\n \"They should have a golem manufacturing facility somewhere.\"\\n\\n He was well aware of this, as he\u0027d killed some of them. There were, of course, golems that had been created dozens of years ago, but there had also been golems with recent production numbers among them.\\n\\n While spying on the Underground Empire, Arema Steelworker had also been increasing his forces. His party had finished looking through the outer corridors, and then went towards the inner facilities, which couldn\u0027t be accessed without the Steelworker seal; they were really excited, and...\\n\\n \"Ooooooh!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s over there.\"\\n\\n Kratia\u0027s yell resounded as if sounding fanfare. The party soon entered a huge room filled with devices and mysterious crystals. Above all, both walls were adorned with vaults filled with level 6 Original Cores. Once she saw the cores, she couldn\u0027t contain her excitement.\\n\\n \"Kratia, is this...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n Kratia nodded her head enthusiastically as if deeply moved. Whenever she was introduced to a new, unknown magical technique, she tended to get really excited.\\n\\n \"A manufacturing facility that produces a large quantity of Original Cores... It really did exist. The surface\u0027s magic engineering is amazing!\"\\n\\n \"Kratia, you seem a bit different.\"\\n\\n \"Uooooh!\"\\n\\n Kratia completely ignored Prince and uttered a sound, as if she were a human power plant, and rushed over to the magical device and began to observe it.\\n\\n He would feel bad if he interrupted her since she was concentrating so hard. Lee Shin Woo decided to leave this entire facility to Kratia and looked through the other facilities. He looked through the golems\u0027 weapon storehouse, the material storehouse, the golem production facility, as well as the repair facility... Even Lee Shin Woo had gotten excited from looking through these storehouses that remained intact for dozens of years.\\n\\n \"I should be able to expand the golem squad significantly!\"\\n\\n \"Oh God.\"\\n\\n \"God\u0027ll like it too. Probably.\"\\n\\n By the time he\u0027d gone through about 80% of the inner facilities, Lee Shin Woo found one of the things he was looking for. It was the golem terminal that remotely controlled the railroad.\\n\\n \"Jin, do you remember what that Steelworker bastard told us last time? It was when we still had to get their permission to use the golem trains.\"\\n\\n \"Did they even say anything important regarding the trains?\"\\n\\n \"They did. It was incredibly important info at that. They definitely told us that they had a line that went directly to the capital.\"\\n\\n \"The capital!? Oh my god!\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a line that goes directly to the capital!?\"\\n\\n Dana and Seira, who\u0027d both been quietly listening in, yelled in astonishment. They should know exactly what this meant! Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and added.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty sure it was Guillotine. He said that \u0027In the process of escaping the capital, we completely destroyed the passageway and the road was closed.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"He must\u0027ve been lying.\"\\n\\n \"He was lying.\"\\n\\n They had been fighting like prepubescent girls before, but now they were agreeing with each other. Lee Shin Woo felt that their relationship was really entertaining and nodded his head.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s obviously a lie. If that line was discovered, then whether they closed the road or not wouldn\u0027t have mattered; the Imperial Army would\u0027ve gotten through. At the time, I didn\u0027t know what high level individuals could do, so I assumed they were telling the truth and let it go, but now that I\u0027m level 8, I know. Their line was never discovered after escaping the capital. And that\u0027s why they were able to continue using this base.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible... It\u0027s preposterous...\"\\n\\n \"Arema Steelworker. He truly was looking down on the Underground Empire. It frustrates me that we never even knew about this. We were playing in the palm of his hand...\"\\n\\n Dana and Seira were in sync as if they\u0027d made arrangements beforehand. The more pissed they were, the more aggressively they would fight. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and said.\\n\\n \"In any case, that\u0027s why, at the time, I hadn\u0027t used the line to go to the capital. But now\u0027s different. I thought there\u0027d be a facility that controlled access to the line inside... Hoo. It was really here.\"\\n\\n \"You thought this far ahead? Ah, as expected of a hero hand-picked by God...\"\\n\\n Dana looked at Lee Shin Woo as if she were a love struck girl. In response, Seira looked at Dana with a sullen expression and said.\\n\\n \"I wanted to say this before, but there are a lot more heroes picked by God than just Lee Shin Woo, Dana.\"\\n\\n \"But what were you all doing while the Hero was doing all this?\"\\n\\n \"Ugh. We were... We were also...\"\\n\\n \"I know! Popcorn! This is where we eat popcorn, right?\"\\n\\n \"Prince, you\u0027re really...\"\\n\\n While they were noisily chatting in the background, Lee Shin Woo carefully looked at the device. Without the Steelworker seal, he couldn\u0027t even approach it; it was set up that way. What\u0027s worse, it couldn\u0027t be controlled without Arema Steelworker\u0027s seal.\\n\\n \u0027But that won\u0027t stop me anymore.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was level 8 and he had the Wild Card skill now. Even if he didn\u0027t absorb Arema Steelworker, he was skilled enough to create the right seal, so long as he knew how the device\u0027s locking mechanism worked!\\n\\n Honestly, he could make it even easier and just use his Shining Flame to erase the lock\u0027s cause-and-effect or his Dark flame to steal ownership of the device. He could also use his Dark Shadow to reverse its locked state and open it and had several other methods available to him as well, but he decided to just make the seal.\\n\\n \"Alright. It really is open.\"\\n\\n \"We can go to the capital!? Directly!?\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the case, then... Then, now that the capital\u0027s defense mechanisms are gone, then we can just take this train and...\"\\n\\n \"Yep. We can just ignore their monsters and attack their life points directly.\" [1]\\n\\n Of course, he didn\u0027t mean that they would go right away. He still had lots he needed to prepare. But now he had a reliable way of traveling to the capital whenever he wanted.\\n\\n \"The final battle... truly is near.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not going to be the final battle. Since some of the undead curse has spread to the surface already. Moreover, the Magic Emperor\u0027s no joke, so we can only relax and live in peace once he\u0027s out of the picture.\"\\n\\n \"The undead curse is affecting the surface...\"\\n\\n Dana, who was quietly listening to him, scowled. Lee Shin Woo glanced at her, and once he noticed his gaze, she lightly sighed and said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if you know this or not, but killing my father... Killing the Emperor won\u0027t completely eliminate the curse.\"\\n\\n \"Huh? What do you mean... Ah, are you talking about that source or what not?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, exactly.\"\\n\\n Seira had told him about it before. The reason they were able to mine Evil Eye was because the source of darkness, which had revived the Empire, had been close by.\\n\\n The ore that had been affected by said darkness was already so powerful, so how insanely powerful would the source itself be? It was scary just thinking about it.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t they equip that to the cannon and fire it? They would\u0027ve been able to break through the barrier that way, right?\"\\n\\n \"But that would\u0027ve destroyed both the underground and the surface. That\u0027s just how powerful the source is. And the Emperor already used that to create the undead curse.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for explaining it in a way that I could understand right away.\"\\n\\n \"It was truly foolish. He didn\u0027t even think about the consequences and just went ahead with it. He used the source of darkness as the base of the undead curse, so the curse itself doesn\u0027t weaken. Once the Emperor is killed, something must be done about the source for the curse to fade away.\"\\n\\n \"...Hmm.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo felt like he\u0027d be able to do something about the source of darkness with his abilities. But he was concerned about something: what if the Emperor decided to use the source against him?\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t do that unless he was crazy, but he was already crazy, so there was still a chance he\u0027d use it!\\n\\n \"Is that source or whatever always next to the Emperor?\"\\n\\n \"Processing it is possible, but it\u0027s difficult to move it, even for the Emperor himself. It\u0027s probably exactly where I remember it.\"\\n\\n \"...I see. Well, I guess it\u0027ll just work out.\"\\n\\n He would first get the Emperor and the Lich away from the source. He would kill the Emperor after taking care of the source. Since he had Seira and Dana on his side, both of which had detailed information on the capital, it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult.\\n\\n \"But the question\u0027s how we take care of the two Liches.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s first think about where their life vessels may be hidden within the capital.\"\\n\\n \"No need...\"\\n\\n The party debated over the final battle, but then, the door opened and a small ice magician entered. Her hands were full of blueprints, which looked pretty cute.\\n\\n \"Since I found out a way to improve the Huginn\u0027s Eye.\"\\n\\n Kratia declared confidently. Huginn\u0027s Eye? That level 8 artifact that they used to sense golems or the undead? He briefly tilted his head, but his eyes soon widened.\\n\\n When the culmination of the surface\u0027s magic engineering met with another world\u0027s magic, the story (the day before the final battle) would truly commence...!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Yu-Gi-Oh! or possibly some other TCG reference.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-263","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
