Paul Zero, don\u0027t leave me.] [Bye, Paul Zero!] When Lee Shin Woo declared that he would leave immediately, the Dryads\u0027 reactions were quite the sight. There were those who grabbed his hands, and there were those who acted like they were parting with their lover, as tears streamed down their cheeks. Their initial reactions of him being a skeleton and being astonished were nonexistent at this point. This is usually what happens. While a first impression seemed like it was of utmost importance, they had ultimately forgotten all about it. \"I said I\u0027d come back.\" [You have to come back!] [Since we want to repay you for introducing us to such lovely trees!] \"Yeah. I promise to come see you again.\" Though he had established his relationship with them through a false name, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought that perhaps his relationship with the Dryads was actually more \"truthful\" than his relationship with the heroes he conversed with in the chatting channel. [Paul Zero, whenever you need our help, just give us a call.] Sinea, as the representative of the Dryads, stepped forward, softly embraced Lee Shin Woo, and said her farewells. He softly tapped Sinea\u0027s shoulder with his bone hand. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll do that. I promise.\" [Take this.] She said, and simultaneously passed Lee Shin Woo a small grapevine branch. As it possessed Sinea\u0027s magic, who had been reborn as a Dryad Princess, he thought it might become the material for an artifact, but fortunately him grabbing the branch didn\u0027t transform it into bone. [If you break this branch, I\u0027ll come to your side, no matter where you are.] \"...Thanks.\" He felt like his lie had worked almost too well, but Lee Shin Woo obediently took the branch. Sinea looked relieved when she saw Lee Shin Woo pocket (into his inventory) the branch and then kissed his forehead... his frontal bone, and whispered so that only he could hear her. [An undead who\u0027s not undead; without the energy of death. I hope that one day I can return to you your true appearance that has been hidden by the appearance of a skeleton.] \"...\" Lee Shin Woo was slightly surprised, but his reply didn\u0027t really give that away. It seemed like his silence was enough for her, as Sinea smiled softly and stepped back. She had instantly gained a commanding appearance upon absorbing the spirit stone and being reborn as a Dryad Princess. \u0027Good for you.\u0027 \u0027Ah, knock it off.\u0027 Jin was jealous that Lee Shin Woo monopolized all of the Dryads\u0027 attention, and left the orchard whilst inwardly quarreling with him. Of course, they weren\u0027t going above ground immediately. They were using the railway to travel to the winery and leave through that exit instead. And by doing so, Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t have to worry about the Dryads for some time. They had everything they would need underground already, so as long as nobody disturbed them, they should be able to stockpile energy and grow from within. Moreover, their leader, Princess Sinea, had promised to aid him unconditionally, so he couldn\u0027t ask for a better result. If he was a human, he probably would\u0027ve sighed refreshingly right now, but it was quite unfortunate that he couldn\u0027t. \"In any case, we\u0027re finished with this.\" \"When I\u0027m with you, everything becomes so hectic that I can\u0027t even remember what we were originally trying to do.\" Jin pointed out, and that resonated with Lee Shin Woo a bit. When he thought about it, he hadn\u0027t originally set out to save the Dryads. He\u0027d just gone to the forest using the knowledge of Vitas\u0027 troops to level up his Acid Resistance. However, even when he thought about it himself, he couldn\u0027t really give a good reason as to how the situation had become like this. He could only say that he had acted according to his instincts and this was the result that followed! \"But you were able to rest a little because of the Dryads, as we\u0027ve been fighting all this time. Plus, you were able to see some beautiful women too.\" \"If this constitutes \u0027taking a break\u0027, then how much do we have to move around for it to be called \u0027hectic\u0027? ...Besides, all those beautiful women were flirting with you!\" \"Haha.\" It seemed like Jin had accumulated a lot of stress from acting like a normal horse in front of the Dryads. Moreover, they had spent almost two months training their Acid Resistance skills, so they had managed to escape the throes of death. Maybe he\u0027d achieve the feat of being the first undead that died from overworking himself. \"I got it. You used your curse absorption on them, and you\u0027ve been working really hard lately, so let\u0027s take our time for now.\" \"That\u0027s not what I wanted to say, but... you said it, not me, so no take backs.\" \"Alright. We won\u0027t do anything regarding resistances or dungeons for now.\" \"...Hmm.\" Jin sounded quite satisfied! However, as soon as Lee Shin Woo relayed his next destination to Jin through Assimilation, he soon uttered in a stiff voice. \"Hey. This is where that senior who turned into an undead is.\" \"Yep.\" Lee Shin Woo\u0027s destination was an area that was somewhere between a danger level 2 zone and a danger level 3 zone. It was also the location where Shino Rendu had died and been reborn as an undead! It had been some time since, so he wanted to see if Metafel had left as well. \"You said we wouldn\u0027t do anything regarding resistances or dungeons!\" \"While we\u0027re taking it slow and sightseeing, I wanted to see how our senior is doing.\" \"And hunting him.\" \"Why do you have to say it like that? I just want to inherit my senior\u0027s will. If I can, his abilities as well.\" \"You cruel bastard...\" Though Lee Shin Woo responded sarcastically, he didn\u0027t actually feel all too good about this. There was no way he could be happy about fighting against his undead-turned senior when he had never treated him badly. Although he was both a swindler and an actor, he wasn\u0027t a psychopath. \u0027...Even so, it\u0027s not something I can avoid. And it\u0027s not something I should avoid.\u0027 Especially because it was highly likely that Shino Rendu had encountered the Mercenary King, Metafel in his final moments. If those memories are intact, he had to acquire them no matter what. He didn\u0027t have time to waste on pointless affection. \"You\u0027ll go, right?\" \"Fine, you asshole.\" \"I wasn\u0027t joking when I said we should go slowly. You don\u0027t need to go full speed.\" \"What\u0027s the occasion?\" Jin inclined his head, looking for the direction the sun rose, even though no such sun existed in the Underground Empire. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo just shrugged his shoulders. \"Since we\u0027ve been growing too rapidly thus far. We need the time to examine and get used to our abilities.\" \"That really doesn\u0027t sound like something you would say...\" Even though Jin snorted in astonishment, he did as Lee Shin Woo said and began moving slowly. Though he was still moving so quickly that others couldn\u0027t even see him, this speed was walking slowly for Jin. \u0027Good. Right now my abilities are...\u0027 Lee Shin Woo had become comfortable on Jin\u0027s back, as if it were the living room of his house, and examined both his stats and skills. Thus far, he\u0027d encountered similar enemies and fought similar battles in the Forest of the Dryads, and had concentrated on using his skills. If he didn\u0027t meditate over his skills and adapt to them at times like this, he might destroy himself [2] from using those skills over and over again. \u0027I\u0027ll forget about Acid Resistance for a while. The same goes for the Acid element as well... However, the method I figured out at the end of my training wasn\u0027t bad.\u0027 Since he was thinking about it, he decided to summon some weapons into the air. If he excluded the armor set he was wearing right now, he could summon four pieces of equipment. All of the summoned weapons were the Lightning Tooth. When he fought in the Forest of the Dryads, the axe was the most appropriate weapon as it was of the Acid element, but in normal situations, the Lightning Tooth was the best, as it emitted powerful lightning. On the other hand, the Drake Horn Lance was... obviously an impressive weapon, but it bothered him that it didn\u0027t possess its own element. \"You\u0027re not going to throw those somewhere, are you?\" \"Don\u0027t worry. Just look forward.\" Magic. The mysterious energy that inhabited all existence. It could possess an infinite number of properties depending on the wielder. However, one such property of magic was that those properties couldn\u0027t be maintained for very long when magic is poured into something from the outside. \u0027However, that rule isn\u0027t applied to my bones, which are both my equipment, as well as my body.\u0027 To be more exact, Lee Shin Woo made it so that rule didn\u0027t apply. It sounded easy, but it required a substantial amount of willpower, as well as concentration. As he split his magic into four different streams and inserted that mana into his weapons, he absorbed the outside surrounding mana within him, replenishing his magic. It wasn\u0027t easy, but if he was able to do this naturally, his combat ability would increase as well. \u0027Rather than trying to explode the weapons with the infused mana, I need to become proficient in collecting that mana back and using it.\u0027 If he did so, his Bone Armory wouldn\u0027t be just a simple storage house, but an extension of his body. And if it did become an extension of his body, Lee Shin Woo could gain \u0027power that couldn\u0027t be measured strictly through levels\u0027! \u0027Now that I think about it, my stats are already at a total of 3,093. I only need to raise my stats by 107 to get to level 6...\u0027 He\u0027d bragged that he could get to level 6 in just a month when he was still level 4, and ever since he\u0027d reached level 5 to now, he\u0027d made the best choice he could in most situations, so it would be strange if Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t grown by this much. Unfortunately, there was a huge gap between Lee Shin Woo and Jin now. When they had first met, Jin had been a higher level than Lee Shin Woo, but now, there was a difference of about 500 stats between them. Still, at the very least, Jin possessed the Child of Light skill, which increased his agility stat gain by three times, so the disparity hadn\u0027t grown any larger than this. \u0027The number of skills we have are way too different.\u0027 Jin only had a few skills he could use (Steel Heart being the main one) and concentrated on those few skills, whereas Lee Shin Woo trained the variety of skills he\u0027d gained from Bone Reinforcement as much as possible. Most low rank skills wouldn\u0027t increase one\u0027s stats very much even when they leveled up, but when they reached the intermediate level, even the most lousy looking skills would increase one\u0027s stats by at least 5, so there was no way there wouldn\u0027t be a gap between the two. \u0027It doesn\u0027t seem like Jin can obtain as many skills as me, even if I reinforce him with the same amount of bones as me... It can\u0027t be helped. This might be the directions of our respective karmas.\u0027 There was only a fixed number of bones that Jin could absorb, so there was a difference in the amount of bones the two could absorb; it would probably be better if he gave up on equalizing their stats. Of course, it wasn\u0027t like Jin wouldn\u0027t be helpful if his level dropped below Lee Shin Woo\u0027s. Jin\u0027s sprint related skills, his body designed for running, and above all, the imbalance of his high agility stat with his other stats that resulted in his speed, would certainly increase Lee Shin Woo\u0027s strength. \"Shin Woo. Shin Woo!\" \"Yeah?\" \"Look over there.\" Lee Shin Woo, who was thinking far into their future, was awoken by Jin\u0027s voice. Because of their connection, Lee Shin Woo immediately knew what Jin was pointing at. It was a city. The amount of death energy being released from the city confirmed that it hadn\u0027t been purified by the other heroes. \"What do you think? Should we stop by?\" \"...Yeah. I suppose we could stop by and then continue.\" It should be ok, as it had nothing to do with resistances or dungeons. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and followed Jin\u0027s offer. Both Lee Shin Woo and Jin were unaware of this, but Jin had been considerably corrupted by Lee Shin Woo. Exactly three hours later, they managed to purify the city. Anyone hearing that they\u0027d purified a level 2 danger zone city within three hours would be shocked, but unfortunately, the two skeleton heroes had already forgotten what it meant to be \u0027normal\u0027.
