What Remains of the Battle - 6\u003e\n Had they formed a sense of camaraderie due to the battle? At first, Lee Shin Woo thought he\u0027d be lucky if they didn\u0027t fight amongst themselves, but their rest and discourse went on far longer than he\u0027d expected.\n This was the heroes\u0027 first experience fighting the 12 generals, defeating them, and being betrayed by their comrades. The only other person besides Lee Shin Woo who could relax, say \u0027let\u0027s meet next time\u0027, and depart was Kratia.\n \"I feel like my third year was the hardest.\"\n \"If I hadn\u0027t met Prince, then I wouldn\u0027t have lasted so long.\"\n \"You must\u0027ve had it rough, Lloyd. You had to put up with this stubborn boy for so long...\"\n \"Junior, hit her for me.\"\n And they even began to reminisce their past. Although they often spoke in the chatting channel, the heroes couldn\u0027t see each other\u0027s faces and speak face-to-face. So, they would quickly go from one topic to the next and remained seated. After all, they didn\u0027t know when they would see each other again.\n Most of the talking was done by either Lloyd or Prince, but if Lee Shin Woo, Retadane, or even Kratia replied, then they would talk for even longer.\n \"What are you guys going to do for dinner?\"\n \"I\u0027m not really hungry...\"\n \"We should rest, rather than forcing ourselves to eat. We killed two of the 12 generals and our stats have increased significantly, so we should prioritize rest to adapt to our strengthened bodies.\"\n Night had come. Ultimately, they decided to rest their exhausted bodies tonight and then go their separate ways. The heroes created tents with their magical devices. He\u0027d seen it often when he travelled with Kratia, but he found it entertaining that the tent matched one\u0027s personality, whether it be the materials or its size.\n \"Shin Woo, are you sure you\u0027re going to be ok?\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027m the least tired. If I get too tired, then I\u0027ll call for you.\"\n \"...I feel ashamed as your senior, but thank you. If you\u0027re tired, wake me up. If for no other reason than for everyone\u0027s safety.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n Lee Shin Woo volunteered for the night watch so that his seniors could get a good nightâ€™s sleep. It was a battlefield where they had killed two of the 12 generals and slaughtered their armies, leaving nothing behind, but it was for that very reason that they had to keep one eye open.\n Of course, he had no plans on waking Lloyd. There was no point in waking up the exhausted heroes. It also didn\u0027t seem like the other heroes, whose minds and bodies were in tatters, would even be able to take the night watch anyway.\n \"This body\u0027s the best.\"\n \"...It\u0027d be tough without an advantage like this.\"\n Once they confirmed that the heroes were deeply asleep, Jin spoke. While Lee Shin Woo spoke with the heroes, Jin seemed displeased, as he repeated what he said sarcastically and tapped his body.\n \"You can make me as exhausted as you want, and I don\u0027t care if I have to sleep again. I just want to be human again...\"\n \"Haha. Yeah, I suppose it was too stimulating today, right?\"\n Lee Shin Woo thought, \u0027what a kid\u0027, but then he heard Jin begin to cry. He could understand how he was feeling. Although he was ok with Kratia, there were too many living people around him today.\n He\u0027d tried to forget about it, but he couldn\u0027t ignore it when so many of them were right in front of him. There were things they just couldn\u0027t do that the heroes could... like eating or sleeping. Lee Shin Woo wondered how he should comfort Jin.\n \"You can smell things too. I\u0027ll put some tea in your body later.\"\n \"I\u0027d rather not get wet, so don\u0027t. It doesn\u0027t help.\"\n \"You just don\u0027t know how to enjoy tea.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you know how. It looked like you were really enjoying yourself with Retadane. Why don\u0027t you actually date her?\"\n \"There\u0027s no point, so don\u0027t say stuff like that.\"\n Lee Shin Woo and Jin continued to talk, and before they knew it, it was already dawn. He planned on waiting until the no longer exhausted heroes woke on their own, but Kratia\u0027s tent opened. She walked out while rubbing her eyes. For some reason, he saw Prince fast asleep within Kratia\u0027s tent.\n Kratia quickly closed her tent, came out, and sat next to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo asked her with a slightly tense voice.\n \"...I didn\u0027t know you guys were in a relationship.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to hit you, Shin Woo. And then I\u0027ll pout.\"\n \"It was just a joke. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Of course, he had already known that they were sharing a tent. Prince had made her own tent, but Lee Shin Woo had seen her immediately walk over to Kratia\u0027s tent.\n He didn\u0027t know what they\u0027d talked about, as they had set up a soundproof barrier around their tent, but he assumed that she had a lot to talk about with a female friend.\n \"Shin Woo, I\u0027m going to be travelling with Prince from now on.\"\n \"Huh!?\"\n That\u0027s why he was so surprised by Kratia\u0027s sudden news. He couldn\u0027t understand how things had gotten so far. What the hell did they talk about in there?\n \"Prince\u0027s level and stats are weaker than mine. In her past life, she could use an innate spell through a contract, and that followed her here, which only makes it seem like she\u0027s strong, but if we can bring out her true potential, then she\u0027ll become a lot stronger. She\u0027s just wasting her magic and talent right now. I thought this before, but I became sure of it today.\"\n \"Mm, I see.\"\n Honestly, Lee Shin Woo had been disappointed by Prince as well. He had been presumptuous, assuming that every magic-related hero would be able to cast unbelievable magic like Kratia.\n \"She\u0027s identified the problem, but she thought it\u0027d be fine until now. Just to be clear, her male disguise is related to that innate spell. It\u0027s a spell that\u0027s been passed down through her family. It\u0027s really complicated.\"\n \"Seems like she has her own troubling circumstances that I don\u0027t want to know about.\"\n \"Yeah, we talked all night. And I had to analyze the spell.\"\n He\u0027d thought that they were just chatting it up while drinking tea, but it was actually a counseling session. Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t just imagining it; Kratia looked a lot more tired than usual.\n \"So I\u0027ve decided to take her on as my student. I regret not being able to travel with you, but... I\u0027ll keep studying what you\u0027ve given me, so don\u0027t worry.\"\n \"I\u0027m not worried about that. I trust you. Anyway, is Senior Prince ok with that arrangement? It\u0027s great that she wants to improve her magic, but she\u0027ll be far away from Senior Lloyd...\"\n Although she\u0027d ripped Lloyd (his words) to shreds yesterday, Lee Shin Woo was well aware of how powerful love was. While he wanted to root for her, he couldn\u0027t help but be worried about the distance between Prince and Lloyd.\n \"Mm, I think she\u0027s changed her mind because of you, Shin Woo.\"\n \"But I warned her so that she wouldn\u0027t change her mind?\"\n \"...I think I get it. You\u0027re saying this is all your fault, right?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Yeah!?\"\n Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he couldn\u0027t understand what she was saying. Jin, who was quietly listening to the side, spoke quietly and nodded his head. He despaired, as Jin understood Kratia better than he did.\n When they were about finished, Lloyd woke up, followed by the other heroes. It seems like Prince was the only one still sleeping.\n \"Shin Woo, are you really ok!? I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be up all night. I appreciate you looking out for us, but you need to take care of yourself a bit better!\"\n \"I know this place quite well. I can easily find a place to rest, so please don\u0027t worry about me.\"\n \"Ugh...\"\n \"You were thinking of us, I see. ...Thank you. I\u0027ll make breakfast. Ruparte, could you please help me?\"\n \"Mm, alright...\"\n As they had starved yesterday, breakfast was quite fancy. Lee Shin Woo was able to excuse himself from the meal since he needed to keep watch and watched on as the heroes ravenously ate their meals. There was no men or women here. They were all pigs.\n \"Prince, that idiot. Is he not hungry? I\u0027ll go wake him up.\"\n \"Prince is awake and getting ready.\"\n \"Getting ready...?\"\n Because Lloyd was finished first, he decided to wake up Prince, but Kratia quickly told him not to. Lee Shin Woo had a feeling he knew what was going on, and when the tent opened, they could see Prince. Seeing her, Lloyd dropped the chicken drumstick in his hand.\n \"You... Wait... What...?\"\n \"It\u0027s me.\"\n Prince curtly replied and walked out of the tent. Although she was wearing the same old robes, the curvature of her body underneath them had changed. It was as Lee Shin Woo expected.\n Her face had become softer and her lustrous silver hair hung below her shoulders. Only her red eyes remained the same, but because they fit with her other physical features, they only made her look more beautiful than before. Lee Shin Woo had hypothesized that \u0027heroes were picked by their looks\u0027 and this just further proved his point.\n Then, Lloyd blushed and yelled.\n \"Are you into cross-dressing as a girl!?\"\n \"I\u0027m not cross-dressing as a girl. I was cross-dressing as a guy, you idiot!\"\n \"What!?\"\n Lloyd had known her the longest and hadn\u0027t figured it out all this time, so he really was an idiot. Whereas, Retadane looked disinterested, not caring whether she was originally a man or a woman, and Erian looked as though she understood.\n \"So that\u0027s why you were...\"\n \"Wait a sec. I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s surprised? What\u0027s going on!?\"\n \"It\u0027s not one of his abilities, but whenever I see that kind of reaction from him, he seems like a true hero.\"\n \"Shin Woo, you\u0027re saying \u0027hero\u0027 like it\u0027s a bad thing.\"\n Lee Shin Woo asked Kratia, who was beside him eating corn, how things had turned out this way, and she explained that \u0027they would be fixing the root of her innate spell\u0027. After her simple explanation, she went back to eating her corn. So, that\u0027s why Prince didn\u0027t need to maintain her spell any longer.\n \"You dimwit. You hadn\u0027t noticed?\"\n \"Ah... My bad. I didn\u0027t think there could be a woman with a personality like yours...\"\n \"Kratia, tie this guy up for me. I want to burn him.\"\n \"Why!?\"\n \"Ok, since it\u0027s my student\u0027s request.\"\n \"What!?\"\n There was a commotion in the morning, but it ended with Lloyd being burned at the stake. It was almost time for them to go their separate ways. Erian enthusiastically carried Lloyd, who was unable to say anything, while Prince looked much livelier than before, as though she were relieved of a burden and stood behind Kratia.\n \"I hope the next time we meet, we\u0027re all a lot stronger than before. Lee Shin Woo, I may contact you often in the future regarding the Heaven Defying General. I\u0027ll be counting on you.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be level 7 the next time we meet. No matter what. And Prince... Are you really ok with sending the two of us off alone?\"\n \"Hmph, I found what\u0027s most important to me right now, so it can\u0027t be helped.\"\n \"What a splendid expression... I\u0027ll be rooting for you.\"\n Retadane left first. Erian departed in the opposite direction while carrying Lloyd. Kratia and Prince looked disappointed, but ultimately said their farewells and left.\n As the last one there, Lee Shin Woo briefly closed his eyes and stayed still. He sighed and then spoke. He knew what he needed to do. But first...\n \"I need to go visit the secret shop.\"\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-190","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
