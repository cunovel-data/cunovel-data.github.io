When they thought about how they could take down Metafel, who had evolved into a level 8 Eater, they naturally came to the conclusion that they needed to create \u0027something so strong that Metafel wouldn\u0027t be able to beat it\u0027. But when it came down to it, their only option was to use the golem core. Although the core was defective, as it could only discharge energy for a few minutes, it didn\u0027t change the fact that it was a level 8 item. \"Are you really done analyzing it? Can we really make a golem out of it?\" [I have found out everything that I could. You should be able to create a golem, Master.] \"...Alright, then let\u0027s bet it all on the golem.\" But before they began manufacturing the golem, Rem taught them why they hadn\u0027t been able to analyze the core fully. [This core cannot be placed in an artificial container. It will not activate. It lacks the ability to receive orders from an outside source and act upon them. The only function it does have is to increase a golem\u0027s abilities.] \"...Huh?\" \"Aren\u0027t cores designed to allow someone to control them?\" \"Did I damage a key function when I turned it into bone? No, there\u0027s no way.\" At this point, the two were halfway panicking and began interrogating Rem. However, Rem corrected their very basic misunderstanding. [This core was created quite differently from the Empire\u0027s... or more specifically, Arema Steelworker\u0027s golem manufacturing technique. If not for you bestowing me with a unique authority, which allows me to have a deep understanding of \u0027all golems\u0027, rather than just a specific type of golem, then I would not have been able to figure it out, Master.] \"I gave you that ability, huh. I don\u0027t even remember giving you that ability...\" \"The only horse here is Jin, Kek!\" [1] Kratia made such a lame joke, despite there being no time to waste, causing Jin to kick her with his hind legs. Lee Shin Woo ignored their little spat and Rem continued with its analysis. [Of course, I wasn\u0027t able to find out everything myself, but I was able to figure out its functionality. This core stores an overwhelming amount of heat, and for a moment, explodes and circulates it in a unique pattern. This is the way the heat circulates.] Rem extended its sharp beak and drew as if carving onto the ground. That drawing included the protective layer that covered the core, or in other words, the golem\u0027s main body. But once Lee Shin Woo saw the circulating heat that flowed through its body, which originated from the golem core, he instinctively exclaimed. \"This... it\u0027s the same mana pattern that flows through the Giants!\" [That\u0027s correct. The circulation of this explosive heat greatly increases the size of the body. As a result, it will increase one\u0027s size to that of a Giants, while also increasing their strength significantly.] \"...Hmm, I see.\" For years, the Giants had used a special pattern to circulate their interior mana to increase the size of their bodies. However, that wasn\u0027t actually suitable for the living Giants; instead, it was the mana circulation pattern applied to a golem\u0027s body. In other words, the golem\u0027s body was akin to a drawn magic circle, with the heat released by the core as its fuel. Obviously, this magic circle was most effective when the core was spewing out heat, not when used with a Giant\u0027s mana. This was also the reason that the core strengthened nearby Giants. \"So that\u0027s how it works. It was originally designed for a large golem. This mana pattern would allow a golem to temporarily become a Titan and is the peak of magic engineering...\" \"If that\u0027s the case, then perhaps the Giants engraved the mana patterns into their bodies so that they wouldn\u0027t trouble the Titans when they repaired the golem.\" \"No, they probably just wanted to become as large as the Titans.\" Those Giants were anxiously awaiting the Titan\u0027s resurrection, were repeatedly bowing their heads from a distance, and were furtively taking glances at them. Considering the fact that they didn\u0027t even react to Kratia, who was a living being, it was clear how much faith they had in the Titan. \"Then what about the golem\u0027s ego? How does the gigantified golem move?\" [The core\u0027s remaining function should explain that.] Rem drew an oval-shaped object in the center of the golem, slightly larger than the core and situated in a similar location. When compared to the size of the core, it seemed like the size that a human being could easily go in and out through. However, that was just the start. Rem ignored the core and the oval-shaped object for now and drew several lines that originated from the oval-shaped object, which traveled throughout the golem. It was as if Rem was drawing blood vessels. The core and this oval-shaped object seemed to be the heart of the golem. This was... \"Huh? Hey wait, is this...\" [That\u0027s correct.] Anyone would\u0027ve noticed by now, even if they weren\u0027t Lee Shin Woo. Rem retained its calm tone and continued speaking. [The core gigantifies the golem\u0027s body, and the golem\u0027s body is used as a medium to synchronize the core with the user.] \"...\" [Synchronization doesn\u0027t simply mean that your movements are synchronized. The heat that\u0027s quickly circulating through the golem\u0027s body amplifies the user\u0027s mana as well and spreads that mana throughout the golem\u0027s body. In other words, while the core is active, the user essentially becomes a gigantic golem.] \"...Ha.\" He was quite familiar with this. Of course, the operating principle was different from start to finish, but Lee Shin Woo was quite familiar with the end result. To think he\u0027d be able to become a giant hero! Becoming incredibly strong for a limited duration... that was exactly like Ultraman! \"This is the first time I\u0027ve thought that it was great that I came to this world.\" \"Shin Woo, you look really excited.‚Äù \"No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m really serious. It looks like there\u0027s no way to fight that level 8 monster and come out of this unscathed other than to make this golem. So let\u0027s make it right away.\" \"But you can\u0027t make this with just anything, right?\" \"Well, that goes without saying.\" The core\u0027s explosive heat and the mana circulation technique together allow the golem\u0027s main body to gigantify instantaneously. However, if the materials themselves can\u0027t withstand that immense heat and magic, then they wouldn\u0027t be able to make the golem in the first place. \"Do you know what this golem was made of in the past?\" [I\u0027m not too sure. However, if we look at the condition of the outer body once it has finished releasing its heat, then we can figure out what materials we need for its construction.] Rem drew another drawing. It looked just like the core, but the outer body covering it was... Mm... was incredibly small. This would be exaggerating a bit, but it was like it was being wrapped in cellophane. [The golem\u0027s main body must consist of materials that have been compressed to the very limit. That way, the moment the heat is released, the user\u0027s entire body will be covered while synchronizing with the golem, and immediately after, the golem will expand. It was probably designed to fit a human.] \"Compressed to its very limit...\" [However, there\u0027s an even more stringent condition: the endlessly released heat. The core, which has completely expelled all its heat, must absorb a huge quantity of heat over an extremely long period of time. Obviously, the main body also absorbs some of the core\u0027s heat. Normal materials would break at this stage from the core\u0027s heat.] \"Of course, since it\u0027s releasing an extreme heat, the golem\u0027s body has to endure that heat as well.\" Rem nodded its tiny bird head. [That\u0027s correct. Therefore, if I were to guess which material would best work, then...\" \"The sunlight stone.\" [Indeed. However, I believe it would be impossible with just a normal sunlight stone or a Solar Fossil. They are not durable enough nor do they have the required level of heat. Plus, they will not survive the processing required to use as materials for the main body.] He wondered, did they have a way to compress the sunlight stone to the very limit and process it for use on the main body in the past? Perhaps they possessed a material that was even greater than the sunlight stone; it may have been bestowed upon them by God herself. However, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s party didn\u0027t have anything of the sort. He had no choice but to go with what he had. Plus, they needed to do it as quickly as possible, before the Eater broke free of his spatial prison. \"Rem, can you and Kratia map out the main body? If we want to go from this candy paper like golem to a truly imposing golem, then we\u0027ll need a thorough mana plan.\" [Of course.] \"I\u0027ll try my best.\" \"Good, then I\u0027ll...\" Lee Shin Woo took out all of his Solar Fossils from his inventory. He hectically fed the Solar Fossils to the core and despite it being fully functional now, he still had one hundred Solar Fossils left. And more importantly, he still had the Solar Fossil that came from the giant sunlight stone that illuminated the Kadinan facility. \"Good, then shall we?\" Lee Shin Woo decided to bet it all on the giant Solar Fossil. It not only radiated the most heat, but it was also the most durable. If he used all the Solar Fossils to reinforce this one, then it might be good enough to use as the golem\u0027s main body. Lee Shin Woo steeled himself and began reinforcing the Solar Fossil. [Consuming a Solar Fossil to reinforce the Giant Solar Fossil! The Giant Solar Fossil is reinforced.] [Giant Solar Fossil (0.2%)] \"...Mm.\" Was it just him, or did seeing 0.2% feel really bad? If using one Solar Fossil reinforced it by 0.2%, then it was obvious what using 100 of them would yield. Of course, nothing might even happen if he reached that 100%, but once the percentage showed up, he felt an obsessive feeling of wanting to reach 100%. [It feels like it has gotten hotter than before, Master. Moreover, it has become tougher as well. It truly is an ore... a fossil designed to manufacture this golem.] \"...Yeah, I should just use them all, shouldn\u0027t I?\" Lee Shin Woo was invigorated by Rem\u0027s cheer and continued reinforcing the Giant Solar Fossil. Should he say it was a relief? Around the middle, there were some Solar Fossils that increased the percentage by 0.3%. Even so, it wouldn\u0027t make much of a difference, so... after he used up all of his Solar Fossils, the Giant Solar Fossil\u0027s reinforcement was only 23.6% complete. \"...Do you think this will work?\" [I don\u0027t think that will work. The heat and the durability aren\u0027t sufficient...] As expected, Rem didn\u0027t know how to beat around the bush. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo hated Rem for its bluntness, but he couldn\u0027t take his anger out on someone who was innocent, so Lee Shin Woo sifted through his inventory, looking for a way to reinforce his Giant Solar Fossil. However, he came up empty. He couldn\u0027t reinforce the Giant Solar Fossil anymore. But did that mean he should give up here? Like hell. [I-If it\u0027s for the Titan, then I can even give up this rotten body of mine!] [Paul Zero, please use my body to give the Titan a new one!] \"No, it\u0027s ok. I appreciate it though.\" No matter how similar their mana patterns were, they wouldn\u0027t be of any help to the Titan. The relationship between the Giants and the Titans was extremely one-sided! As he thought, he only had one choice left. \"Damn it. Now that it\u0027s come to this, I have to leave...\" \"Shin Woo?\" \"Kratia, keep working. But... Chi Paul, Shino Rendu, Bisher Moon... and Ellata and Arogan.\" Lee Shin Woo had called for all of his level 7 elites, as well as Shino Rendu. Unfortunately, the rest of his troops wouldn\u0027t be helpful against Metafel, so he left the rest of his troops at the deepest part of the Giants\u0027 domain. They would just help Metafel if they were found. \"You guys... if Metafel gets in while I\u0027m gone, stop him. Just buying some time is plenty, so don\u0027t risk your lives.\" [...Understood.] [That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been waiting for.] [I trust you, Sir Paul Zero.] [I will.] All of their replies were reassuring, but when he recollected the sight of Metafel as he ran away, he couldn\u0027t help but feel worried. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and looked at each and every one of them. [...Sir Paul Zero.] Especially at Shino Rendu, who was the only one who hadn\u0027t reached level 7. He used most of the bones that they\u0027d gotten from the battle on him, but he still hadn\u0027t reached level 7. \"...Shino, you can\u0027t die. You won\u0027t be satisfied with exacting revenge on just Metafel, right?\" [Of course not.] Shino replied reassuringly and then added. [I\u0027ve abandoned my goal of killing Metafel by myself. Instead, when you\u0027ve defeated him, I\u0027d like to hit him at least once by your side. For that, I cannot die.] \"Good. That\u0027s it. You can\u0027t die.\" He couldn\u0027t lose his precious investment, now could he? With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo replied, and Shino Rendu responded with an absolutely refreshing smile. Lee Shin Woo smiled back, turned around, and activated the heroes\u0027 authority. That was, of course, entering the secret shop. [1] T/N: This joke doesn\u0027t make sense in English. The word \u0027to say\u0027 can also mean \u0027horse\u0027, so his sentence could be interpreted as \u0027I gave you that horse\u0027.
