Hero Hunter - 5\u003e [Lloyd H.K.: The monsters\u0027 movements in the level 4 danger zone are a bit strange.] Lloyd said, and Lee Shin Woo realized that it was about time. [Lloyd H.K.: It\u0027s like they\u0027re being chased by something, and it\u0027s becoming more difficult to hunt, as more and more monsters are grouping together.] [Prince Altania: They\u0027re just scared of you.] [Yasunori Akira: It\u0027s not like that over here. Maybe it\u0027s just localized.] Of course it was localized. Since it\u0027d only been two days since Lee Shin Woo had entered the level 4 danger zone. [Lloyd H.K.: It\u0027s still too much, even if we write it off as localized movement. There\u0027s definitely something incredibly powerful moving around over here. It might even be one of the 12 generals...] [Ethan Cruz: Want me to go over there?] [Lloyd H.K.: No, it\u0027s not a big enough issue for you to... Mm, could you please come over here?] [Ethan Cruz: Of course.] As he left the chatting channel, Lee Shin Woo felt like he was breaking into a cold sweat. He and Jin had hunted such a large quantity of monsters that it seemed like they\u0027d been discovered. He\u0027d killed thousands of monsters a few times already, so the other monsters found out. Then, unfortunately, those monsters left in droves to avoid them. The undead monsters! In order to escape them! \"I thought I\u0027d be able to go wild in the level 4 danger zone, as there are so many high level monsters here, but...\" \"The other heroes aren\u0027t hunting the high level monsters like we are...\" Unfortunately, after his fight in the training facility, he had learned how to fight against a large quantity of enemies, so Lee Shin Woo had become fond of fearlessly charging into enemies, regardless of how many there were. Though it was a level 4 danger zone, Lee Shin Woo and Jin trusted in their immortal bodies and slaughtered the monsters, as they only needed to be wary of the level 7 monsters, as even the level 6 monsters were no match for them. That\u0027s why Jin\u0027s stats had increased by more than 100 in just two days. \"If we just keep at this for another 2 weeks, you should be able reach level 7...\" \"Isn\u0027t that damn Necromancer coming? Let\u0027s avoid him and just do what we need to.\" Jin obediently accepted Bone Reinforcement, and Lee Shin Woo hunted diligently, like a mother bird bringing worms for its newborn, yet they\u0027d lost such a good opportunity because of Ethan Cruz! \"Damn it, I guess it can\u0027t be helped...\" Of course, they hadn\u0027t just been killing monsters. They\u0027d found a hidden undead hero and had given him eternal peace. The undead hero had been only level 6, but he had possessed an incredible proficiency in combat, so once he absorbed the bone following his defeat, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s High Rank Bursting Thunder skill leveled up by 1, and his Intermediate Shadow Horn skill by 3. It was quite a significant development. \"He seemed like a good senior, so I really wanted to keep him alive...\" \"Why do they awaken when they hear your voice...?\" \"I want to know that too. Rem, do you know?\" [I can only affect golems for now...] Yeah, of course that\u0027s how it was. Lee Shin Woo sighed and patted Jin. When he\u0027d heard about Ethan in the chatting channel, they avoided the monsters and ran away. They were preparing for the inevitable fight against him, but they weren\u0027t ready. Not yet at least. \"We\u0027ll find another one soon.\" \"We\u0027re in the flatlands right now, though... Which means it\u0027s in a dungeon.\" \"Let\u0027s go in carefully, so that we\u0027re not discovered by the flying monsters.\" \"Ok.\" It had been two days since they\u0027d entered the level 4 danger zone, and they already looked quite dignified. Then again, they risked their lives more so than any other hero in order to explore the area, so it seemed obvious that they would accumulate that much experience. \"I hope we find someone that we can actually talk to this time... Mm.\" Lee Shin Woo found the entrance to the dungeon and opened it. He opened it so naturally, like flowing water. There was a considerable amount of magic and monsters within the dungeons in the high level areas. And that\u0027s exactly what all the undead want! Thus, if they were noticed the moment they opened the dungeon, then they might experience a barrage of undead monster attacks. To be honest, his seniors had suggested that he \u0027be careful when entering dungeons\u0027 when he had entered the level 3 danger zone, but whenever the undead swarmed him, he\u0027d say \u0027Hut, nice\u0027 and just kill them, so he hadn’t worried about it. \"Nice, it\u0027s clear.\" Lee Shin Woo skillfully opened the dungeon before the monsters could swarm them, and entered with Jin. The opening of the dungeon closed instantly. They had finished things perfectly. [Level 6 Elite Dungeon - You have acquired the permit for Mole Heaven. All stats are increased by 30 within the dungeon. The dungeon\u0027s information is added to your minimap. All actions are buffed within the dungeon.] \"This is our first time in a level 6 elite dungeon. Will we be ok?\" \"If it were a level 7 elite dungeon, I might be concerned, but a level 6 elite dungeon should be fine. Our problem\u0027s the senior who\u0027s inside...\" The dungeon was so silent that they felt uneasy. Which meant that all of the monsters had been killed already. So it was highly likely that the hero was safe when he had first entered the dungeon. Yet, he still died. Most likely to an elite monster, or the boss... \"He was so meticulous in clearing, so much so that I don\u0027t feel any presences in the entire area. Yet he still died, which means that the dungeon boss must be no joke.\" He might even have to fight against the undead hero and the boss simultaneously, and tightly gripped the Breath of the Lightning God. The six fully charged Breath of the Lightning Gods were summoned behind him and shook. Jin wondered whether anyone could survive the barrage of the Lightning God... or Lee Shin Woo\u0027s secret name for it, Lightning God’s Breath, but Jin didn\u0027t say it out loud. \"Let\u0027s go slowly, shall we?\" \"Ok.\" Lee Shin Woo silently blew up the Breath of the Lightning God that had been in his hand. The thundercloud spread out in every direction instantaneously, and he continuously inhaled and exhaled through his Mana Breath, causing the environment to remain filled with lightning energy. He was forcing his surroundings to become tinged in lightning energy through his authority! \"Good. It\u0027s become more stable.\" \"It always feels like my Lightning Resistance will level up...\" [I as well.] This was one of techniques he\u0027d learned once he\u0027d reached level 7. Immediately changing the environment into one advantageous to him was a high level technique that wouldn\u0027t lose out to a level 8. It was only possible because of the balance among the Bone Armory, Rule of Bone, and Mana Bone skills. \u0027Though I can do the same thing with Mana Breath, without any explosions...\u0027 However, not only did that approach take much longer, but the energy emitted from the Breath of the Lightning God doing it this way was more powerful as well. Because his mana recovery rate was much greater than before, he could now re-summon the Breath of the Lightning God without much difficulty and fully charge it as well, so this method was much better for him. \"But even so... Jin?\" \"We\u0027re using Assimilation to its max right now. I feel like what I feel, you feel too.\" \"Mm.\" After Lee Shin Woo had re-summoned another Breath of the Lightning God, infused mana into it, and was fully prepared for battle, he noticed that their situation hadn\u0027t changed and felt embarrassed. Of course, this level 6 elite dungeon had several side roads here and there, and as it was Mole Heaven, there were several big holes as well. It was also a considerably large dungeon, but even taking all of that into account, there were too few presences. At Jin\u0027s level, his crawl was as fast as a train, but even at that speed, there was nothing that they found! \"Where\u0027s that senior? Is he really here? Maybe this is an empty dungeon that someone already cleared.\" \"He\u0027s definitely in here, but... there\u0027s only one undead senior inside of an empty dungeon...? If I were to make sense of this, then... Lee Shin Woo\u0027s goblin fire burnt gently and gripped his Breath of the Lightning God more tightly. Jin, inspired by Lee Shin Woo’s fighting spirit, followed suit and became cautious. They went deeper into the dungeon, exploring every nook and cranny, and in the end, they arrived near the boss room. \"He\u0027s not here...\" \"Shin Woo, are you ok?\" Lee Shin Woo finally came to the conclusion that there weren\u0027t any monsters within the dungeon. He had been suspicious when he hadn\u0027t felt any living energy within the dungeon, but he hadn\u0027t expected the boss to be dead as well, and felt dejected. \"They really did go to heaven.\" \"You\u0027re terrible. So what are you going to do now? ...Are you going to go in?\" At the very least, Jin could tell that Lee Shin Woo was wary of the senior inside. Lee Shin Woo just nodded his head... at Jin\u0027s question. \"We\u0027ve come this far, so we can\u0027t just turn back. If they\u0027re one of Ethan\u0027s agents, then all the more reason for us to take him down.\" \"...Yeah, if need be, we can just kill him I guess.\" \"Nah, I\u0027m not going to kill him.\" Lee Shin Woo was sure that Jin hadn\u0027t forgotten about their encounter with the Archmage the other day, and his resulting death. He softly gave Jin a dutch rub and then... placed his hand atop Jin\u0027s head. \"Let\u0027s go, Jin.\" \"Alright.\" Dozens of lightning arrows appeared in the air. It was the Breath of the Lightning God\u0027s option, Thunder Arrow. It was quite an efficient skill, as it only consumed a small amount of mana to consume a large quantity of controllable arrows. \"Heup!\" Lee Shin Woo controlled the thunder arrows telekinetically, and shot them at the boss room door. The arrows battered the door together, and although they didn\u0027t break through the giant stone gate, the arrows managed to weaken the sides, allowing them to enter. There was a calm-looking skeleton within. [I didn\u0027t think an undead would come into the dungeon.] The skeleton\u0027s bones had turned black, and wore a robe adorned with luxurious gemstones above them. And in the place of eyes, he had green gems... emeralds embedded. It really looked like a Lich that came out of a game. Whether it was fortunate or not he couldn\u0027t tell, but it wasn\u0027t a Lich. If he destroyed its main body, it would die. [You seem to be quite a high level... Are you as powerful as one of the 12 generals?] \"Nope.\" Considering the fact that he could talk to it, the skeleton had definitely retained its intellect. Even though it retained its intellect, he had no proof that it was still sane, so Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t drop his combat readiness. But it wasn\u0027t like he could attack it right away. First off, he would have to show his respect to his senior. \"I\u0027m someone who opposes them.\" [Opposing the 12 generals? It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve heard something so funny. An undead that opposes the Empire... Are you perhaps connected with Ethan Cruz? No, if you were working together with Ethan, then you wouldn\u0027t have been able to find this place...] The undead raised its staff, embedded with a large emerald, and aimed it at Lee Shin Woo while speaking cautiously. [Are you a hero?] \"...It seems like you\u0027re still self-aware.\" Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t met an undead hero until now that had been self-aware (that they were a hero) and acted accordingly before he could even convince them. He\u0027d thought that perhaps a case like this would come up in the future, but... He couldn\u0027t feel relaxed yet. At least now he had a chance to figure out how to approach this situation. [Then, you too?] \"I\u0027m Paul Zero. ...If you\u0027re not hostile, then I\u0027d like to talk to you. How about it?\" Lee Shin Woo withdrew his Breath of the Lightning God and spoke (though of course, the second he saw something strange, he was prepared to counterattack). The skeleton likewise withdrew its staff. He was definitely a lot different from the undead he\u0027d met until now. No... perhaps it was different from any of the undead he had met. [Well, well. This is quite surprising for me as well. Alright. Let\u0027s talk... Oh, right. My name.] It stroked its face with its free hand and replied. [...My name is Lee Man Bok.] A familiar name popped up!
