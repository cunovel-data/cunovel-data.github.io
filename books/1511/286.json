War\u0027s Scenario - 4\u003e God carefully took a sip of the tea with her thin, pale pink lips and sighed in satisfaction, as if enjoying the tea\u0027s scent. She then said... [I\u0027ll get straight to the point. This is all your fault.] \"That sounds like a load of bullshit, but let\u0027s hear what you have to say.\" Lee Shin Woo gently opened his eyes and glared at her. She pushed her red hair to one side and shrugged her shoulders. [It\u0027s true. At first, I could only influence the world [1], or as you understand it, the surface and the underground together, so much. And I\u0027ve been dividing that limited influence to summon the heroes, give them power, and develop them. Do you understand me thus far?] \"So why is your influence on the world limited in the first place? Gods are absolute beings, aren\u0027t they?\" He\u0027d asked something similar before, and he was ignored back then. But he believed that now God would acknowledge him. God seemingly thought to herself regarding that, and then nodded her head and spoke. [Yeah, I guess it\u0027s time for you to know... If someone possessing a high \u0027level\u0027, presence, or magic moves, then that\u0027s enough to shake the world. One person\u0027s karma changing affects other people\u0027s karma as well.] \"Of course. That\u0027s how this world works after all.\" This was especially true for this world, such that he could see it with his own two eyes. Moreover, Lee Shin Woo had experienced it with his own body, hadn\u0027t he? By switching between his form with limited immortality and his human form, he\u0027d learned that when obtaining a terribly great karma, there was an equally heavy cost associated with it. At the time, he\u0027d thought that God was just toying with him, but that wasn\u0027t the case. While it was a great risk, her bestowing immortality upon him was meant to reduce the side effects of bearing this kind of karma to its minimum. ...Of course, her not telling him in advance was just to mess with him. However, he understood her true intentions and nodded his head. God looked a bit moved. [You\u0027re beginning to transcend humanity too. You see, most humans would be confused around now.] \"But that\u0027s the essence of karma, isn\u0027t it?\" [Understanding it shows the difference between a transcendent and a mortal. By forming connections with others, your karma became distorted and developed in a completely different direction, so that may be why you were able to pick up on the essence of karma so quickly.] God then lowered her empty cup. She tapped on the cup and it refilled with tea. She had restored Lee Shin Woo\u0027s special mixture of tea and brandy. She gulped it down in one go and sighed. She then asked Lee Shin Woo. [Do you understand what I just did?] \"Time?\" [Right. It\u0027s time. To be exact, it\u0027s creation using Time Magic. Recreating something that is gone. It\u0027s quite simple for me, but if used in the world, then it would be too much for it to bear and a city may vanish right then and there. That\u0027s what karma is. And that\u0027s the main reason why I haven\u0027t been able to intervene so much.] \"Mmm.\" Lee Shin Woo tilted his head. While Lee Shin Woo had understood the result, he couldn\u0027t understand the process. But the result did tell him something. For example, if Lee Shin Woo were to use the very same Time Magic for creation, then he was confident that he wouldn\u0027t cause the same adverse effects. Why, you ask...? \"Can\u0027t you just trick it? It seems pretty simple to me.\" [Ah, the world. You\u0027ve already been doing that. I\u0027ve seen you twist order around, such that it\u0027s unclear who the true owner of your karma is. I was really shocked. But that\u0027s impossible for me to do. Since I can\u0027t use that innate element.] If God were both omnipotent and omniscient, then she\u0027d be able to do everything Lee Shin Woo could do. However, she thought innate elements were special and claimed that even she could not fool the world. But if that\u0027s the case, then why... \"...Are innate elements powers of the gods?\" Yeah, he naturally came to that conclusion. Had he become a god at some point? But he soon rejected that notion, as he felt he was still lacking in several areas to be called a god. \"Moreover, there are way too many people in the world who wield innate elements. Aside from me, there\u0027s the Dark Flame Ghosts, the Garuda, Seagald, the Magic Emperor... the Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, should be able to too. And based on the energy tampering with the chatting channel, the Archmage must be able to too.\" [Mm. They don\u0027t become gods per se, but you could say that they\u0027ve met the conditions to transcend karma itself. That\u0027s actually why I\u0027m concerned. Like you said, there have been way too many individuals with innate elements. You\u0027re an exceptional irregular, but the events hundreds of years ago had too much of an effect... I should\u0027ve stopped it myself, but why didn\u0027t I? There was definitely a way to minimize the chaos and stop it. But by allowing the humans to take matters into their own hands, I ended up having to intervene more than before. I was so foolish...] \"...Let\u0027s get back on topic now, shall we?\" As one ages, they gain a specialty. It was talking about one thing, and then suddenly going on a tangent. Before it was too late, Lee Shin Woo slapped his cheek and spoke. Then, God went \u0027oh my\u0027 and nodded her head. [Anyway, that\u0027s why my influence is limited. If you were in my place, then you wouldn\u0027t even have to worry about this and could just kill Jissehanu or Jirold yourself. Dark Shadow. That thing\u0027s really overpowered. Remember. You may think that Annihilation Flame or what not is overpowered, but it\u0027s not. It\u0027s Dark Shadow. Got it?] God was being jealous! While sweating buckets, Lee Shin Woo tried to steer the conversation back on track. \"So the surface\u0027s Emperor is called Jirold, huh? It really suits him.\" [I don\u0027t know what his public name is, but his name is definitely Jirold. But what were we talking about again? ...Ah, that\u0027s right. First, give me another cup of tea.] \"You could just restore it like last time.\" [But it feels different. That\u0027s karma for you.] Perhaps there was something he still didn\u0027t know about karma. He poured her another cup of tea while pouting. She took it satisfyingly and returned to their original conversation. [I should tell you how I bestow power upon the heroes. First, the summon. I summon those fated to die in another world and send out someone dying from this world. This is the basics of summoning. It\u0027s done to reduce the summoning\u0027s adverse effects on the world as much as possible. And the power I bestow. I told you this at the beginning, so I don\u0027t need to go over it again, do I? This is my \u0027influence\u0027. It was all going according to plan up to here, but... the problem started afterwards.] \"The secret shop?\" [The secret shop maintains balance by accepting Perium for its goods. Of course, there were some issues with it as well, but there are some issues that can be dealt with because most of you heroes are otherworlders and not from this world. It seems like bestowing power upon otherworlders, rather than the original inhabitants of this world, has a much less adverse effect on the world. Well, what do you think? It\u0027s quite a delicate balance, isn\u0027t it? You get how much I love this world, right?] \"Then what\u0027s the problem?\" Was Ms. Goddess over here always such a chatterbox? If not, then was it because of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s actions thus far? Either way, he wouldn\u0027t be happy, so he just urged her to continue. God continued her explanation whilst grumbling. [The quest rewards.] \"Ah, I see... Especially the 12 General quests, right?\" [Yep, exactly.] God scratched her head as if she felt like this was a pain in the ass. [The reason the 12 General quests were set up that way was because I thought beating them was just that difficult and that they wouldn\u0027t be defeated so frequently. At the time, I didn\u0027t think a hero would show up that would kill seven of the 12 Generals by himself.] \"Ah, as I thought. I kind of get it. It all happened because I was too good, right?\" [Yeah, you bugged player.] If Lee Shin Woo were to liken the situation to a game, then it would be something like \u0027when all the goods are pushed onto one side, then the game\u0027s balance breaks\u0027. With the emergence of an irregular like Lee Shin Woo, God\u0027s delicately balanced influence broke. [It\u0027s quite ironic, but the situation\u0027s less severe than it could\u0027ve been; all because of your Joker karma. If you didn\u0027t have it, then the hero system would\u0027ve failed a long time ago. You don\u0027t seem to be aware of it, but you\u0027ve already halfway transcended the world. Meaning you\u0027re not recognized as one of the inhabitants of this world. Of course, that probably doesn\u0027t matter to you.] \"Since I just need to trick it.\" Lee Shin Woo replied plainly. To be honest, he already knew that. As his Joker karma grew stronger, he felt more and more isolated from this world\u0027s rules. Even God acknowledged that as well. But who cared? If he stayed on this world, then it would become his home. Lee Shin Woo was already prepared to kick back and live peacefully on this world. [Anyway, most of my power went to you, which made the problem even worse. Not only am I less and less able to interfere with what happens in this world, but the power I\u0027ve already used is also starting to weaken as well. And he just happened to take advantage of this opportunity...] \"The Archmage.\" [That\u0027s right. It would\u0027ve been impossible with normal mana, but that bastard has learned an innate element.] At first, Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t 100% sure it was the Archmage that had invaded the chatting channel. Since the mana pattern he\u0027d remembered differed from the one within the chatting channel. So then why wasn\u0027t Lee Shin Woo able to confirm that it was the Archmage, even though he was familiar with his mana? It was simple. As Lee Shin Woo had suspected, the Archmage was using some sort of mana he wasn\u0027t familiar with... In other words, he was using an innate element! He didn\u0027t even want to think about it, but... there was a high chance that he\u0027d awakened an innate element from his battle with Lee Shin Woo and Seagald. \u0027You\u0027re just an undead, yet you\u0027re growing!?\u0027, thought Lee Shin Woo; though he wasn\u0027t one to talk! [In any case! You can\u0027t use the chatting channel anymore. That\u0027s not all. The other heroes probably won\u0027t be able to go to the secret shop anymore. He seems aware of how dangerous it would be to invade the secret shop though, as he hasn\u0027t dared to enter, so I don\u0027t have to worry about Pleine.] \"Wow.\" [Do you get it? I can\u0027t summon new heroes or provide you with supplies anymore. ...Everything\u0027s on you now. You have to do it. If you fail, then it really is the end. ...If that happens, then I\u0027ll have to intervene and start everything anew.] Of course, he\u0027d roughly expected this, but he felt somewhat odd hearing it from her. Lee Shin Woo contemplated on what she\u0027d said and then asked. \"Does that mean the world will end?\" [...If you\u0027re playing a game with your character, Hero AAAA, but you find you can\u0027t beat it, then what do you do? You erase that character and try again with Hero DDDD.] \"Be more creative with your names.\" [...So I ask of you, Hero AAAA. It\u0027s really tiring to make a new game from scratch... and it\u0027s really sad too.] She genuinely bowed before him. He couldn\u0027t even imagine her doing this, considering how their first meeting went. Hero AAAA... Err, Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and stood up. If he failed, he would die too. There was no need to answer her. \"Ah, one more question.\" [What is it? Oh, Pleine\u0027s a virgin. Isn\u0027t that hilarious?] \"Thanks, I really wanted to know that. No, not that.\" [Seira\u0027s a virgin too.] \"I knew that already. So what exactly is Invisible Heart?\" God\u0027s eyes widened slightly. But she didn\u0027t seem surprised. Perhaps she was waiting for him to ask her that. She soon narrowed her eyes and smiled. [Even if I were to tell you, you wouldn\u0027t understand. But if it\u0027s you, you may be able to figure it out by yourself soon enough.] \"You\u0027re really no help at all, you old bag.\" [Then, take care, Lee Shin Woo. It\u0027s been such a long time since I\u0027ve played around with someone who could understand my \u0027level\u0027. Come back and play with me again.] The next moment, Lee Shin Woo had returned to the secret shop. Pleine and Seira were watching him with eyes wide open, as he\u0027d disappeared and suddenly reappeared. He remembered what God had said and in embarrassment, turned his head around. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mr. Shin Woo?\" \"Never mind. It\u0027s nothing. Nothing at all.\" Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t handle the awkwardness any longer, so he was thankful that the Erems had suddenly sent him the report that he\u0027d been waiting for. [1] T/N: The word she uses can mean either the world or above ground/surface in Korean. That\u0027s why she clarifies it.
