You have acquired 10,000 Perium. Proficiency in combat-related skills has increased. You can now use your own private chatting channel.]\n If heroes clear out a city of the undead, they receive a reward personally bestowed by God. He\u0027d seen everything else before, but the private chatting channel was a surprise. Of course, it was questionable how much he would use it in the future.\n If a hero performs exceptionally in the task known as \u0027purification\u0027, they may be awarded a Hero token; however, Lee Shin Woo had already obtained the Joker karma, so he couldn\u0027t obtain it a second time. No, perhaps the purification process was much too wicked, such that he wouldn\u0027t have been able to attain it, even if he didn\u0027t possess the Joker karma.\n [You have gathered more than 10 permits to God\u0027s secret shop. You may exchange 10 permits to God\u0027s secret shop for 1 permit to God\u0027s garden.]\n However, there was an additional message that appeared before him. It was the first time he\u0027d seen a message like this. Lee Shin Woo stared vacantly at the message for some time, and then silently opened the chatting channel. He had decided that this was something that he should know about beforehand.\n [Mr. Lee Shin Woo has entered.]\n [Ye Jin Jin: I\u0027m glad you\u0027re safe!]\n [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027m glad you\u0027re safe as well. Seniors, have any of you gone into God\u0027s garden before?]\n [Prince Altania: You crazy bastard. How the hell did you collect ten permits to God\u0027s secret shop?]\n [Ye Jin Jin: You shouldn\u0027t talk like that! That makes it sound like Mr. Shin Woo is crazy!]\n [Lloyd H.K.: He is crazy. How did you collect ten of them already?]\n As expected, it seemed as though his seniors knew about it. If it was something they hadn\u0027t heard about before, he wouldn\u0027t have gotten any information out of them; instead, they would\u0027ve pestered him like crazy and it would\u0027ve been a real pain in the ass. It was a relief that that wasn\u0027t the case. He quickly asked them a question.\n [Lee Shin Woo: I was just lucky enough to get them. What should I do with them?]\n [Yasunori Akira: A small blessing. That\u0027s what we call it. Even I haven\u0027t gotten one before.]\n [Ethan Cruz: God\u0027s garden is a kind of temple. Though it\u0027s a bit pricey to get in, God will personally bestow upon you her divine grace, which is well worth the cost.]\n [Lloyd H.K.: We\u0027ve heard about it from Ethan [1], but we\u0027ve never actually gone there before. Since we need to continuously go into the secret shop, we couldn\u0027t just continue gathering them.]\n [Erian Ruparte: Lee Shin Woo, I\u0027m envious of your talent and passion. I thought you were out of the ordinary ever since you rescued Jin Jin, but...]\n [Lee Shin Woo: It was all because of her. You see, I received a lot of permits for God\u0027s secret shop from saving her.]\n [Prince Altania: Ah, maybe I should do some manual labor too. At this rate, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll fall behind a newbie. That would be such a disgrace.]\n He wanted to say, \u0027You might\u0027ve already fallen behind Kratia already\u0027, but Lee Shin Woo barely kept himself from saying it. And his seniors\u0027 advice continued on.\n [Seira Von Retadane: We have to periodically go to the secret shop since we can\u0027t just fill our inventories with food. Lee Shin Woo, you\u0027re probably well aware of this, but you cannot afford to be too greedy. Please enter God\u0027s garden only after you have enough permits to spare or after you have acquired a quest that\u0027s easy to complete.]\n [Lee Shin Woo: Thank you, senior. I\u0027ll keep that in mind.]\n [Prince Altania: As I thought, Seira\u0027s been to God\u0027s garden before. It\u0027s really clear advice.]\n [Seira Von Retadane: Please call me Retadane.]\n In any case, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t need to eat, so essentially, it would only be beneficial for him to go to God\u0027s garden. He thanked and said goodbye to his seniors who always gave him good advice, and left the chatting channel. But then...\n [Ethan Cruz: I have high expectations of you, Lee Shin Woo. Perhaps we\u0027ll meet soon.]\n [Lee Shin Woo: I\u0027ll work hard.]\n [Lloyd H.K.: For Ethan to say something like that...]\n [Prince Altania: Senior, you can\u0027t say stuff like that. I\u0027m close to level 7, you know? Once I get to level 7, I\u0027ll go through all the dungeons I know about, and get to level 8 in a flash! Ah, Lloyd, if you ask me sincerely, I can help you out.]\n [Ethan Cruz: Prince, you\u0027re extremely talented as well. I just didn\u0027t say it since it seemed so obvious, you rascal.]\n Lee Shin Woo stepped away from the exchange of well-wishes between seniors and juniors and left the chatting channel. But unexpectedly, at that moment, he saw two messages appear simultaneously.\n [Mr. Ethan Cruz is requesting a private chat.]\n [Ms. Ye Jin Jin is requesting a private chat.]\n Was this message appearing because he\u0027d unlocked the private chatting channel function? Lee Shin Woo accepted Ethan\u0027s request first. In no time, he heard Ethan\u0027s voice in his ear.\n [It wasn\u0027t lip service. Lee Shin Woo, you\u0027ll become a big shot in no time.]\n \"Um... thank you.\"\n [It\u0027s important to know just how much you\u0027re worth. I hope I didn\u0027t see wrong. It\u0027s nice to be humble, but remember that you can\u0027t afford to fool yourself. Be aware of how special you are and proceed steadily.]\n Why was this guy saying such burdensome things? He should\u0027ve just refused, just like Arema Steelworker had done with the golems, but Ethan eventually went on to the main topic.\n [I\u0027m a high level right now, so I don\u0027t really need them, but there are a few dungeons that only I know about.]\n \"Pardon me...?\"\n Even an idiot would understand what Ethan Cruz was saying. However, that made him all the more suspicious of him.\n \"Did you want to tell me about these dungeons...?\"\n [Exactly.]\n Obviously, the higher level the dungeon, the more difficult it is to find. These dungeons are hidden in more unusual places and trick adventurers. That\u0027s why heroes go crazy whenever they find a dungeon. However, he knows about a few dungeons? And was only going to tell Lee Shin Woo about them?\n \"There are other heroes, so are you really ok with telling me?\"\n [Ah, Lee Shin Woo. I just told you, didn\u0027t I? I told you that you\u0027d become big. ...You\u0027ll be different from useless bums like the Prince.]\n \"...I see.\"\n [I\u0027m glad you\u0027re quick on the uptake. Now then, I\u0027ll activate the minimap sharing function.]\n Sharing the minimap. This feature would share one\u0027s location with another person. Apparently, it was the feature that was unlocked following the private chat function, so it felt strange to Ethan Cruz that Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t unlocked it yet.\n \"It feels like the image has been stuck into my head.\"\n [You roughly know what direction you need to go in, right?]\n \"Yes, thank you.\"\n It felt similar to opening the world map in a game, marking one\u0027s destination, and moving towards said destination. To put it simply, a navigation system for a car. If he closed his eyes, an arrow would appear in his head that would indicate which direction he should go in.\n All of the dungeons Ethan had told him about were situated in the same area. They were quite far off, but if he used the train, he could get there quickly, and even if he didn\u0027t have access to the train, he could get there riding Jin at top speed in only three weeks; if he just walked there, he could get there in a year.\n [I hope you grow quickly. Since you can\u0027t invade the capital all by yourself.]\n \"Thank you... very much. I hope I\u0027ll be able to stand side by side with you one day.\"\n [Superb.]\n That ended their private chat. Immediately after, Lee Shin Woo stopped acting and thought about it. What the hell is this piece of shit planning?\n \"Are there heroes who kill other heroes to grow...? Then does God just sit by and allow that to happen?\"\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"There\u0027s an asshole, one of our seniors who\u0027s trying to lead me somewhere. 100%.\"\n He knew since he was in the same line of business (swindler). Ethan Cruz was 100% a son of a bitch. But compared to Lee Shin Woo, Ethan\u0027s means were quite sloppy.\n For example, all of the dungeons he\u0027d informed him about were in the same direction. A prominent figure like Ethan Cruz... no, a hero who\u0027s been at this for a long time wouldn\u0027t have just stayed in one place like that, so does it make any sense that all of the dungeons he\u0027d told him about were in the same place? It was definitely a trick clearly aimed to lead Lee Shin Woo to a special area.\n \"Couldn\u0027t it just be that he found a ton of dungeons that weren\u0027t fit for his level after leveling up a lot and moved to another area? It\u0027s not good to be so distrustful of people, Shin Woo.\"\n \"No, my \u0027s.o.b. radar\u0027 is going crazy right now. I thought it was strange that I became a rising star or whatever just by introducing myself in the chatting channel.\"\n \"But you are a rising star... Even from my point of view, you\u0027re so talented that it\u0027s strange.\"\n \"You know pretty much everything about me, but the problem is that the other heroes don\u0027t.\"\n Ethan Cruz\u0027s objective was so clear, but he didn\u0027t know what his motive was. What good was it to kill another hero? Rather, he should get a penalty from God, so why...?\n \u0027Mm... I guess I could just meet with God and ask her myself.\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo thought, and around the time he felt relaxed, he got another private chat request. Of course, it came from Ye Jin Jin. As soon as he accepted, he heard a lively girl\u0027s voice in his ear.\n [Ye Jin Jin: I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027m disturbing you! But I have something that I really needed to tell you.]\n \"It\u0027s because I got another private chat request.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: Who!? Is it Ms. Retadane? It shouldn\u0027t be Erian [2]...]\n \"Ethan Cruz.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: That senior...!? Ah, that\u0027s right. I recently unlocked a new function. I\u0027m here right now.]\n \"Here...?\"\n He waited, figuring that she might have unlocked the sharing function, and as he expected, the minimap sharing function activated. Of course, he could\u0027ve refused, but didn\u0027t; funnily enough, she was in the complete opposite direction to the point Ethan Cruz had marked.\n [Ye Jin Jin: I\u0027ll work hard to catch up to your level, so let\u0027s hunt together in a party later!]\n \"Yeah, sure...\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: Then I\u0027ll get going now! I\u0027ll get back to hunting!]\n Lee Shin Woo listened to the cheerful Ye Jin Jin until the very end and couldn\u0027t help but suddenly recall what his seniors had told him. \u0027Take it easy on the romance...?\u0027 There\u0027s no smoke without fire, but perhaps... no.\n \u0027No way.\u0027\n If one likes a skeleton, then they were either really screwed up in the head, or became a skeleton themselves. Now that he thought about it, both of them were pretty much the same.\n Lee Shin Woo unhesitatingly interpreted Ye Jin Jin\u0027s feelings for him as just trust. Or perhaps respect. If it was either of those, there was nothing wrong with her. It was fine to have those kind of feelings for a skeleton.\n \"Shin Woo! What the hell did you do!?\"\n Then, Kratia came flying by and landed in front of them. Beyond her, the Pauls were moving diligently to collect the bones. Lee Shin Woo marveled at the fact that they did it without him ordering them to do so. These guys were truly starting to show promise!\n \"I just used a skill. It doesn\u0027t work on allies, so don\u0027t worry.\"\n \"If you just let me see you use that skill... No, wait a sec.\"\n Kratia was soon greeted with a sight that was much more surprising than the Shriek of the Dead. She had discovered the three Iron Golems that stood side by side around Lee Shin Woo, as if guarding him. There was no way she, with her magical abilities, wouldn\u0027t be able to figure out what kind of relationship Lee Shin Woo had with the golems.\n \"You, this... Perhaps...?\"\n \"Yep.\"\n \"Let\u0027s increase the duration of the contract!\"\n As soon as Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and acknowledged her, Kratia\u0027s eyes brightened, as though there were stars in her eyes. It was the most beautiful and lively face he\u0027d seen since meeting her. However, Lee Shin Woo replied sharply and firmly, like a slap to the face.\n \"Don\u0027t want to.\"\n \"Ugh...!\"\n Lee Shin Woo, who had already achieved his objective, didn\u0027t really need to hang out with her any longer. But Kratia, who had witnessed yet another miracle from Lee Shin Woo, couldn\u0027t let him go so easily; Lee Shin Woo ultimately agreed to increase their contract by just three more days.\n In exchange, all of the bones of the undead that she killed would go to him, and... they forged another alliance.\n \n \n [1] T/N: He never actually uses Ethan\u0027s first name to address him, but using \u0027senior\u0027 here wouldn\u0027t work.\n [2] T/N: Uses the Korean term \"unni\" to describe Erian here. Women use this term to refer to women older than them that they\u0027re close to or their real sisters. In this case, it\u0027s the former.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-63","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
