That all the undead in the Underground Empire have stagnated. Even if they raise their levels, their \u0027existence\u0027 won\u0027t change...\" There was no doubt about it, so when she said the unthinkable, he fumbled with his words. \"But don\u0027t the undead have a clear sense of identity? Like the Archmage. Compared to most humans, he\u0027s much more...\" \"Mr. Shin Woo, an undead\u0027s sense of identity or their intellect has no bearing on their true identity. It doesn\u0027t matter how rational or knowledgeable they are; having a clear goal doesn\u0027t matter either. Because the undead are irrevocably tied to the past, they cannot see the future. And they cannot even act in the present. That is their \u0027identity\u0027, which they cannot escape from.\" Lee Shin Woo was struck by a dull shock. He could understand it mentally. That\u0027s exactly what individuality and identity meant. No matter how skilled one was, they couldn\u0027t go against their natural instincts. And to the undead, that instinct was \u0027stagnation\u0027. The undead didn\u0027t want to change. They wanted to stay in the same place and repeat things over and over again. Lee Shin Woo could understand. At least, he thought he could understand, but... he really didn\u0027t get it. \"How... How can that be? The Undead Emperor is level 9. The Archmage is not only level 8 like me, but understands mana much better than I do. What\u0027s worse, he knows spatial magic, so he can get through the barrier whenever he wants...\" \"It\u0027s because they\u0027ve become undead. They must\u0027ve stayed underground for far too long. They have become unable to go to the surface.\" \"...\" \"They forever remember the day that they were banished, and they hate everything on the surface. They want to tear the Magic Emperor to pieces, but... Despite that, they wish to remain underground. You must accept it, even if it doesn\u0027t make sense. It\u0027s their natural instinct, just like eating is necessary for humans to survive.\" How pitiful. Lee Shin Woo briefly thought that they did nothing wrong. They researched a way to get out, and made themselves into the undead, yet... As a result, they were unable to escape and were trapped underground. How ironic. \"Come to think of it, God told me that I had to kill the Emperor to stop the \u0027spread of the undead curse\u0027. She didn\u0027t say, \u0027they might come to the surface, so stop them\u0027.\" \"Yes. For her part, she didn\u0027t lie to you about that from the very beginning. It was also something she couldn\u0027t hide from you.\" It was so obvious that he\u0027d forgotten at some point. He\u0027d stopped thinking at a crucial moment. No, he\u0027d thought that the fearsome undead weren\u0027t affected by logic and could do whatever they wanted. \u0027I can understand why the Magic Emperor wasn\u0027t worried. He should\u0027ve gotten a report from Arema Steelworker on the Undead Emperor\u0027s movements, so he would be sure that the Undead Emperor isn\u0027t going to invade the surface. That must be why the surface dispatched heroes at first, but then stopped soon after.\u0027 He\u0027d finally solved the puzzle. There were still some mysteries he hadn\u0027t solved yet, but he could just look into those in the Underground Empire. Like the actual goal of General Seagald\u0027s Anti-Skull... \u0027What a pain in the ass. That guy\u0027s goal might be different from what I first suspected...\u0027 \"Mr. Shin Woo. You\u0027re not thinking something strange, are you? Something like, \u0027I\u0027ll send all of the undead to the surface myself.\u0027\" \"Oh, nice idea.\" \"Mr. Shin Woo!?\" \"I\u0027m just joking around.\" Pleine was startled and yelled. Lee Shin Woo grinned and tried to calm her down, but it didn\u0027t work. She must have some deep-rooted feelings. \"When God made you into an undead, she granted you a little bit of divinity to erase the undead\u0027s \u0027identity\u0027. It was a desperate attempt on her part, but it worked a lot better than she could have hoped. But to think you\u0027d be able to do the same with other undead...\" \"Ah, as I thought.\" Lee Shin Woo was talented in using the darkness element, and was even able to make the Pauls his subordinates when he was at a low level, making them freer than before. They prioritized his orders, but they had no other restraints. In other words, they weren\u0027t stagnant like the other undead in the Empire. They were freed from the past and were capable of moving forward. \"So I thought you might take the Empire\u0027s side and lead them to the surface...\" \"Putting the deceased on the proper path, huh... That sounds pretty cool.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t be putting them on the proper path, but on the path to ruin!\" It was a joke, of course. To repeat, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t want to live in a world filled with death. But this plan showed him some actors that he could control on his stage. Since ancient times, there was nothing better than a foreign enemy to unite the people. If he controlled the situation properly, then he could lead it in a favorable direction for him. His vague plans, which he\u0027d formed upon coming to the surface and acting as Kay, were being adjusted in his head. \"...Haha. It\u0027s become quite interesting.\" \"Haha. Your ominous smile is making me shake all over.\" When he was level 7, he may have had some special abilities, but he was still at a much \u0027lower level\u0027 than Pleine. But by reaching level 8, his existence had fundamentally changed. As a result, he became almost on par with God\u0027s representative, Pleine. She still beat him in terms of pure magic and power, but he was ahead of her in terms of his authority. It seemed like Lee Shin Woo was still unaware of this, but Pleine had noticed. \u0027No matter how talented he is, or whether he was bestowed divinity or not, I didn\u0027t expect him to max out one of his elements already. It\u0027s much more surprising than learning a high rank element! But what is his element? I can\u0027t tell with just the energy it\u0027s emitting...!\u0027 Of course, she didn\u0027t say all that. She didn\u0027t want Lee Shin Woo to be biased or conceited about his own abilities. He would continue to grow at a rapid pace, and if she said something now and affected that growth, then she wouldn\u0027t be able to take it back. \"Alright, I get it. In the end, my job hasn\u0027t changed much.\" \"If you\u0027re willing, I\u0027d like to hear what the job of yours entails... You won\u0027t tell me, will you?\" \"You can just watch and enjoy, Pleine.\" \"Will I really be able to enjoy it...\" \"Jin Jin, come over here.\" \"Y-Yes!\" Was she intimidated by the sight of them talking so intimately? After they\u0027d deepened their relationship, she acted close to him too, but she walked over stiffly, as if she\u0027d forgotten all about that. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and asked. \"Are you still far from level 7?\" \"Ah, no. Iâ€™m not close if you look at my combat experience, but I achieved a lot of feats in the Underground Empire, so I gained a lot of stats. And as you know, I used a lot of the money I got from working as Lawrence\u0027s representative to buy medicine...\" \"You bought it and...?\" \"I need about 1,000 stats to reach level 7.\" \"So you\u0027re still not there yet... But it\u0027s a relief. You\u0027re farther along than I thought.\" She had grown a lot, considering the fact that she had been at the tail end of level 5 when she came up to the surface. If the other heroes knew about this, then they would\u0027ve wrung her neck. She had grown faster than he did when he was at her level. However... \u0027Hoo. She\u0027s my own creation, so this much is expected.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo knew how diligently she\u0027d been working. If she had just taken what he had given her for free, then she wouldn\u0027t have grown so much. To achieve a feat, one needed to be proactive, no matter how little it was. If she hadn\u0027t tried so hard, then she wouldn\u0027t have achieved it. And she probably hadn\u0027t been lax on her skill training either. She\u0027d \u0027ground her bones\u0027 [1] to catch up to Lee Shin Woo, if even a little. But Lee Shin Woo was made up of nothing but bones, so it wasn\u0027t enough! \"...You\u0027ve nurtured another hero quite well.\" Pleine, who was listening to their conversation from the side, was astonished. But Lee Shin Woo shook his head, as if displeased. \"In case I had to leave Jin Jin on the surface alone, I wanted to get her to level 7. But that damn Emperor came looking for me and messed up my plans. So going back there isn\u0027t such a good idea, and though it\u0027s not ideal, I have no choice but to proceed like this...\" \"Why isn\u0027t it a good idea?\" \"In a sense, me \u0027dying\u0027 is good for me.\" Lee Shin Woo explained the current situation, as well as what he would do in the future to Ye Jin Jin, who was tilting her head, and the rest of his party. \"The Emperor destroyed the Lawrence mansion, fully prepared to take a hit to his reputation. My fame went up significantly, and the fear and animosity towards the undead curse increased as well. The person at the center of all that was killed, so everyone will direct their anger towards the Emperor.\" \"That\u0027s true.\" The Emperor said he was prepared for all that. He added that the people had no choice but to rely on the Emperor. And he was right. As long as things continued as they were, that is. \"But what would happen if I came out and said \u0027Actually, I\u0027m alive.\u0027? Of course, the people would be happy, but that forces me into a fight against the Emperor. Since I \u0027came back to life\u0027, the Emperor will consider me his mortal enemy, and it\u0027ll become hard to move around afterwards, so... It\u0027d become really, really tough on me.\" \"But you said that it couldn\u0027t go on like this.\" \"Yeah. So I\u0027ll set up Kay\u0027s replacement. That\u0027s you.\" Hearing that, Ye Jin Jin looked extremely confused. \"But I\u0027m already Lawrence\u0027s representative...\" \"Lawrence will come forward. Lawrence, angered by his friend\u0027s death, will do everything in his power to keep his friend\u0027s wishes alive. Together with you, who is both Lawrence\u0027s and Kay\u0027s representative. If we tell people that you\u0027re not just business savvy, but you were trained by Kay, have great power, and can wield flames, then wouldn\u0027t that make quite the story?\" \"...It\u0027s such a great story that I feel like a story depicting the love triangle between Kay, Lawrence, and Izuna (Ye Jin Jin\u0027s false name) will come out.\" \"Exactly. It\u0027ll draw people\u0027s attention. If that happens, then those who supported me will support you and Lawrence. You see, if they harm you, the successor to Kay\u0027s name and beliefs, then the Empire will break down completely.\" Honestly, that crazy Vampire Emperor may damn the risks and try to kill Ye Jin Jin anyway. So, he would need to set up some countermeasures just in case. \"It seems like the perfect plan. However, Mr. Shin Woo... Aren\u0027t there actually two huge problems with that plan?\" Ye Jin Jin, who was deeply absorbed by what he was saying (acting in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s stead felt romantic to her), pointed out some flaws in his plan, as if she felt really bad for doing so. \"First off, Lawrence is one of your names, Mr. Shin Woo. But you\u0027re going back to the Underground Empire, aren\u0027t you?\" \"From now on, Bisher Moon will become Lawrence. Not only has Lawrence never officially appeared, but through my influence, Bisher has become able to disguise himself freely, so he can play the part of Lawrence. Moreover, he can more freely connect the Lawrence shop and Moon Shadow together, so there\u0027s no better choice.\" \"Now that you mention it... But even you can\u0027t fix the second problem, Mr. Shin Woo.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"It\u0027s me. Me!\" Lee Shin Woo looked oblivious and Ye Jin Jin ultimately looked at him with a half-crying face and yelled. \"I\u0027m not as strong as you and I can\u0027t wield flames! You even told me to get to level 7, but I couldn\u0027t even do that. Mm, even though I tried my best. I really did my best...!\" \"That\u0027s ok.\" \"That\u0027s ok!?\" Lee Shin Woo took out an artifact from his chest, and once he did, it drew everyone\u0027s attention. They had no choice but to pay attention to it. [Phoenix\u0027s Feather] [Lv9] [Durability: So long as one ember remains, it self-repairs itself] [Defense: 2,500 - 3,500] [Element: Fire Lv8] [Options: All stats increase by 100, Magic increases by an additional 100, you take no fire damage, you take no critical damage, automatic health recovery, and level 8 fire is added to every one of the wielder\u0027s attacks] [Special passive skill: Sun God\u0027s Breath - By storing enough fire mana, the wielder can concentrate the flames and discharge it whenever they wish.] [Special active skill: Sun God\u0027s Blessing - When the wielder dies, the wielder can defy death once through the use of the flames that burn away cause and effect and return to life. The one who revives through this effect receives the Sun God\u0027s blessing.] The soft dress boasted greater defensive capabilities than any of the armor within his possession. Plus, it increased one\u0027s stats by a crazy amount, and it would even add an element to one\u0027s attacks, increasing one\u0027s offensive abilities. It was the whole package, excelling in both offense and defense. It was the greatest inheritance left behind by the divine bird, the Garuda... What\u0027s worse, it was the first time God\u0027s representative, Pleine, had ever seen a level 9 piece of equipment. [1] T/N: Ground one\u0027s bones is a Korean idiom. It means to feel unbearable pain and/or work incredibly hard.
