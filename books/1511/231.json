But that wasn\u0027t the case with you. I formed several hypotheses, but none of them fit. Of them, there was only one remaining possibility: that you came from a place beyond my gaze. And that means you either came from another world or the underground...\"\\n\\n \"Hoh, what an interesting deduction.\"\\n\\n \"You may think that you\u0027re the only hero here, but God has brought several heroes here from other worlds.\"\\n\\n No, he already knew that. After all, there were two other heroes on the surface right now!\\n\\n \"But unfortunately, God\u0027s summoning magic is too conspicuous. After the golem network was created, I would find and kill any hero summoned on the surface, unless one of God\u0027s apostles secretly descended into the world.\"\\n\\n Wait a sec... The surface, not the underground? This is the first time he\u0027d heard about it. So God had sent heroes to the surface rather than the underground in the past? Why? In order to defeat the Magic Emperor, who assumed complete control over the Empire?\\n\\n Of course, just looking at the Emperor gave him some idea. The Underground Empire wasn\u0027t the only problem. Both the surface and the underground had their fair share of problems!\\n\\n \"Hoo.\"\\n\\n The Emperor noticed that Lee Shin Woo was beginning to listen, sported a disgusting smile fit for a middle-aged man, and continued.\\n\\n \"God can no longer send heroes to the surface. Thus, you came from underground. Moreover, the barrier doesn\u0027t allow the living to pass through it, so you must be undead. But if you were one of the underground\u0027s undead, then you wouldn\u0027t have been able to leave...\"\\n\\n \"Mm...\"\\n\\n Wait a sec. What he was saying was largely contradictory. On the outside, Lee Shin Woo acted calm, but he was actually quite shocked.\\n\\n \u0027The hell is this guy saying?\u0027\\n\\n Let\u0027s say that the Emperor was talking about the barrier under the assumption that Lee Shin Woo came from the underground.\\n\\n But what did he mean after that? If he were one of the underground\u0027s undead, then he couldn\u0027t have come out? Why not? They had gone through the trouble of turning themselves into the undead to pass through the barrier, so why couldn\u0027t they leave?\\n\\n But the Emperor spoke firmly and voiced his conclusion as if he were putting an end to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s many questions.\\n\\n \"So I thought about it. If God wanted to nurture a hero without being noticed by me, then she would call them underground and transform them into an undead so that they could go through the barrier! Am I right? Undead hero!\"\\n\\n \"...Phew.\"\\n\\n \"Hoo. Not so relaxed now, hmm.\"\\n\\n Of course he wouldn\u0027t be. Since it was so laughable! That probably wasn\u0027t God\u0027s plan when she made him an undead! He\u0027d gotten it all wrong, yet he\u0027d still come to the right conclusion: that he was an undead hero. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t suppress his admiration.\\n\\n Whereas, the Emperor, who couldn\u0027t know what he was thinking, raised a hand towards Lee Shin Woo and stretched out his fingers (Lightning Bind, which restrained Lee Shin Woo\u0027s movements, got even tighter). Then, he smiled in satisfaction.\\n\\n \"You fooled me with that disguise ability of yours... I acknowledge it. It\u0027s impressive enough that even I cannot replicate it, but you were much too rash and arrogant. That\u0027s why you failed.\"\\n\\n \"...I\u0027d like to ask one last thing. How do you plan on killing me? I don\u0027t know what you think of me, but I\u0027m the one who killed that divine bird. You won\u0027t be able to kill me through trivial means.\"\\n\\n \"Hoo. You\u0027re still bluffing, even though you can\u0027t even move a finger due to my Lightning Bind.\"\\n\\n The Emperor smiled and refuted him. He must\u0027ve thought what Lee Shin Woo was saying was ridiculous.\\n\\n \"It was called a divine bird long ago. But it was weakened by my barrier, the parasites, and the undead curse. You think I don\u0027t know? That you could barely beat it by sacrificing all the Sun God religion\u0027s paladins and priests?\"\\n\\n \"Mm.\"\\n\\n As he thought. On the way back to the capital, Lee Shin Woo and the Pope had conversed discreetly. If his abilities were revealed, then the Emperor would be more wary of him than necessary, so they would spread rumors that not only was the divine bird weakened but that the Sun God religion had sacrificed its paladins and priests to defeat it.\\n\\n Of course, he didn\u0027t doubt the Pope\u0027s abilities, but those rumors had reached the Emperor in just one day. Not only that, the Emperor completely fell for it. Did the Evileye General not properly report to him?\\n\\n No, the Emperor probably thought that she was exaggerating his abilities to save herself, and may not have completely trusted in her report.\\n\\n \u0027Then that means... That innate element, Lightning Bind, was nothing more than the ability to connect himself with someone else whenever he wanted. This means he can\u0027t read one\u0027s mind, see the past, or get notified if something doesn\u0027t make sense in his domain.\u0027\\n\\n Its power was incredible, yes, but compared to his other innate elements, which could affect cause and effect, Lee Shin Woo felt like it was weaker. Was Lee Shin Woo the only one who thought that way? Perhaps the Emperor hadn\u0027t even completely mastered the darkness element.\\n\\n \u0027It looks perfect, but this guy\u0027s information network is full of holes. It\u0027s fine, now that I know.\u0027\\n\\n Then again, the only thing he could interfere with was the status quo, so he\u0027d so diligently created golems and spread them across the Empire. Moreover, it seemed like the Emperor wasn\u0027t yet aware that Rem had taken control of those golems, so he couldn\u0027t help but laugh.\\n\\n No one other than Lee Shin Woo could\u0027ve thought up something like this. With this, however, Lee Shin Woo was already above the Emperor. What the Emperor said next was proof of this.\\n\\n \"Shall I tell you what the biggest reason you were discovered was? Someone with the strength to match a divine bird couldn\u0027t have been so easily ensnared by my ability. You\u0027re the hero who defeated the divine bird one-on-one when you couldn\u0027t even resist my ability and are just waiting for death? Haha, what a funny lie.\"\\n\\n \"If I die here, then it\u0027ll become rough on you. You shouldn\u0027t look down on the feelings of so many people.\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t a threat. He wasn\u0027t trying to buy time either. He didn\u0027t need to anymore anyway. He was just curious. Rumors of the dungeon and the undead curse were spreading throughout the capital, so if Lee Shin Woo were to die, everyone would suspect and hate the Emperor. So what was he thinking?\\n\\n \"That\u0027s only temporary. Didn\u0027t I tell you before? As time passes, the people have no choice but to fall back on the palace, on the absolute Emperor. Without you, the religious order cannot lead people. You... must be sacrificed to maintain public order.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n Another simple answer. This so-called Emperor placed way too much confidence in his power. He was speechless that a guy like this would be brazen enough to utter the word \u0027arrogant\u0027.\\n\\n Of course, he possessed such absolute power, which enabled him to control the Empire. Moreover, he\u0027d become a Vampire and thus immortal, so he could understand why the Emperor felt like he had nothing to fear... But it seemed like he still hadn\u0027t realized it. That nothing lasts forever in the world.\\n\\n \"If I had my way, I would\u0027ve destroyed Lawrence as well, but there\u0027s no way a mere merchant can take your place. There should be no problem with just leaving him be.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t look down on Lawrence.\"\\n\\n Since I\u0027m Lawrence.\\n\\n \"Haha. I don\u0027t look down on people. I make my decisions objectively. And if I\u0027m acting confident, then there\u0027s only one reason for that. ...It\u0027s because I am the Emperor who rules over all creation!\"\\n\\n Having said his piece, the Emperor tightly clenched his hand. The large quantity of mana enclosing Lee Shin Woo... No, the entire mansion converged onto Lee Shin Woo and exploded!\\n\\n And as a result, the Emperor... or the Evileye General was affected as well. She was dead the moment she\u0027d picked Lee Shin Woo over the Emperor.\\n\\n - Saaa\\n\\n The magic explosion muffled all sound, and the entire mansion was vaporized. In its place, the darkness of the capital flooded in and filled the area to the brim.\\n\\n The only thing that proved that the Evileye General had been here was her skull... and soon, even that melted into the air and disappeared.\\n\\n [The Wild Card skill has become Lv2. All stats have increased by 30.]\\n\\n [The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv5. Magic has increased by 20.]\\n\\n [The Acting skill has become Lv21. Your acting can even fool magic.]\\n\\n [You have acquired the Lv7 Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel\u0027s skull.]\\n\\n \"So in order to fool the Emperor, you\u0027re hosting a hero get-together here?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo smiled at Pleine, who had pushed her head forward over the counter and looked speechless.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a while. It\u0027s nice to see you, Pleine. Haha.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to see you too... Wait a sec! That\u0027s not what I want to say!\"\\n\\n \"Wow. That scary shop lady\u0027s talking so proudly...!\"\\n\\n [Was I able to enter because we formed an official contract? It\u0027s a really interesting space.]\\n\\n [So Lee Shin Woo, who is that woman!? I sense divinity from her!]\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s entire party was in the secret shop right now. To be more specific, Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d sensed the Emperor\u0027s visit, had sent everyone else to the secret shop. Then, he\u0027d spoken with the Emperor and come to the secret shop after.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe you acted in front of the Emperor and managed to fool him.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s my karma. Ah, and because he was using the Evileye General\u0027s body, he couldn\u0027t control his magic perfectly, which is one of the reasons that I could deal with him so easily. That Lightning Bind element or whatnot didn\u0027t seem like it was at a very high level either.\"\\n\\n And what were his countless reasons? He had several ways of dealing with the situation, but he\u0027d chosen Wild Card and Dark Shadow this time around. The Emperor said it, didn\u0027t he? That there was no way someone powerful enough to fight the divine bird head-to-head wouldn\u0027t be able to resist his Lightning Bind.\\n\\n He was right. The Emperor believed that he was restraining Lee Shin Woo with his Lightning Bind, but what he was actually restraining was Lee Shin Woo\u0027s armor. If Lee Shin Woo had completely understood the Emperor\u0027s innate element, then his armor wouldn\u0027t have been restrained by his opponent\u0027s magic either.\\n\\n \"The next step was easy. When he unleashed that magic explosion, I used Dark Shadow to twist cause and effect, focusing the explosive power onto the Evileye General. I hid my body within the darkness, took the Evileye General\u0027s bone, and then came here, to the secret shop.\"\\n\\n When one reaches the peak of the darkness element, doing something like this became possible. Lee Shin Woo waved his hand as if he were bragging. His hand softly melted into the darkness, flickered, and then returned to its original form. Seeing that, Pleine shook even more.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s worse, you came without any permits! You shouldn\u0027t just come in here whenever you want with the Heaven Door\u0027s Key!\"\\n\\n \"Well, it couldn\u0027t be helped. Since I don\u0027t have any permits left...\"\\n\\n When he came to the surface, the Heaven Door\u0027s Key had eaten all of his permits, and he hadn\u0027t gained any on the surface. If Ye Jin Jin didn\u0027t have any permits left, then he would\u0027ve had to use the Heaven Door\u0027s Key to get them here, but if he did, the Emperor would\u0027ve known.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going to stay for very long, so just look the other way this time. If I had been properly rewarded for my actions on the surface, then I would\u0027ve had permits to spare.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, nothing makes sense anymore...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo looked at the grief-stricken shop owner and grinned. Then, he suddenly thought of something. The one thing the Emperor had said that had bothered him.\\n\\n \"Pleine, I\u0027d like to ask you something.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t promise you that I\u0027ll answer it, but go ahead.\"\\n\\n \"Why hasn\u0027t the Undead Emperor gone to the surface when he can supposedly go through the barrier by being undead?\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n Pleine\u0027s eyes became empty. Lee Shin Woo spoke even more forcefully.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you tell me at least this much? I deserve to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"...You should already know the answer to that question, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n Pleine responded with a bitter smile. Immediately after, she said something so simple and clear... the despondent truth.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because the undead cannot move forward.\"\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-231","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
