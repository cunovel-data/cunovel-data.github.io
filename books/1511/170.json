Heaven Defying General - 2\u003e\n Metafel had left behind other loot aside from the bones, like a red, flame tinged greatsword. The blade was both wide and long and looked quite crude, but its sharpness and its sinister aura could instill fear upon any who looked upon it.\n [Eater\u0027s Flame Greatsword]\n [Lv6]\n [Durability: 2,350/2,350]\n [Attack Power: 1,400 - 1,950]\n [Element: Fire Lv6]\n [Options: Strength + 70, Magic + 40]\n [Special Passive Skill: Fire Eater - Absorbs all fire-related energy.]\n [Special Active Skill: Countercurrent - Once it reaches the maximum capacity, the fire energy is concentrated in a single point, amplified, and discharged.]\n \u0027Why did an Eater, who didn\u0027t use fire, drop a level 6 fire artifact,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo wondered, but once he looked through the artifact\u0027s skills, he understood.\n Fire Eater. Lee Shin Woo recalled Metafel, unable to give up on eating the flames until the very end. His regrets and his will were instilled in this artifact, so it seemed obvious that the item would be so extraordinary.\n \"I got a weapon I can use when I\u0027m a Titan.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to see you use it, but we\u0027ll have to wait another 60 days before you can.\"\n \"I\u0027m scared that you\u0027ll get to level 8 within those 60 days, Shin Woo. Aren\u0027t your stats close to 9,000 now?\"\n \"Even if I become level 8, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that the Titan\u0027s a powerful weapon. And if we can remodel it, then...\"\n \"I\u0027m most scared of the fact that you didn\u0027t deny that you would hit level 8 within those 60 days!\"\n Lee Shin Woo grinned and calmly absorbed the greatsword. His strength and magic went up, and the Eater\u0027s Flame Greatsword was recorded in his Bone Armory.\n He thought his Bone Armory would level up with this, but it seemed like that was still out of his reach. As expected, leveling a skill to level 10 must be special. He pondered that thought, turned around, and declared.\n \"Let\u0027s get out of this mountain range now. There\u0027s no reason for us to stay here any longer.\"\n [Yes sir!]\n The ice curse had been released. As time passed, the ice would slowly melt, and the mana\u0027s spatial distortions would gradually go away as well. ...And if that happened, the Archmage would wonder why Metafel hadn\u0027t returned, despite how the situation had changed, and he would probably come here himself.\n \u0027Even if I could summon the Titan again, I think he\u0027s still out of my league.\u0027\n He didn\u0027t know if he could escape the effects of the Archmage\u0027s spatial magic, even with the Titan. Plus, he couldn\u0027t picture himself landing a telling blow on him either.\n Moreover, he wouldn\u0027t kill him by just crushing his body. Since the container, which held his life force, was hidden away somewhere in the Empire! When Lee Shin Woo considered the fact that he\u0027d have to look for said container, he realized that beating the Archmage was still a ways away.\n \u0027If I want to take him down, then I\u0027ll have to be really prepared. I\u0027ll ask my seniors about it later.\u0027\n Of course, that relied on them overcoming the coming danger first. He lined up his troops, left Perlin Elta, and finally, left the gradually melting glacial mountains.\n [We\u0027re finally leaving this place...]\n [Arogan.]\n The Giants regretted leaving the mountains, which served as their base while they were dead, but... their meaning of existing lay in Lee Shin Woo, not in the past nor in legends. They knew that if they remained here, all they would feel is misfortune and unhappiness.\n [Don\u0027t look so sad. We\u0027ve become able to step forward into the future! Everyone, raise your weapons! Take out the rocks!]\n [Hoo... Huaaaaaahp!]\n They put all their regrets into their fists, broke apart the mountains, and followed behind Lee Shin Woo. As expected, the Giants\u0027 strength was truly extraordinary. Their fists shook the ground and the sound of their punches rang through the air. The crumbling snow-covered mountain, the warming snowy fields... Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo felt completely refreshed.\n \"Wait, why are you breaking it?\"\n \"They\u0027re erasing all traces of us being here. It\u0027s best to make it so that the enemy\u0027s both unsure of what happened, as well as making it seem worse than what it really is.\"\n \"The Giants sure are energetic.\"\n Jin was shocked and Lee Shin Woo explained the situation. In the midst of that, Kratia was the only one to watch the Giants as they broke the mountains and her eyes shined. It seemed like she\u0027d found the next object to study after the Huginn\u0027s Eye. The magic had lasted for hundreds of years and had transformed them into Giants, so it made sense that she was so interested in them.\n \"If we pick up the right materials, then I think we can make another Titan Golem by using that unique mana pattern.\"\n \"Wait, we just went through all that trouble to restore the Titan, so what do you mean \u0027make another one\u0027... More importantly, how\u0027s the Huginn\u0027s Eye?\"\n \"Mm, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve made much progress yet. I brought it with me, so you want to take a look?\"\n Kratia brought out the Huginn\u0027s Eye from inside her robes. He didn\u0027t really feel like it had changed visually. However, she explained that she had a lot of success limiting the item to just golems.\n \"That\u0027s not all. I can limit it to living people too, and I can limit to the undead as well. Honestly, I just got there after studying how to limit its targets.\"\n \"If it\u0027s limited to the undead, then too many people will appear on it.\"\n \"I feel like I might be able to limit it to high rank undead, level 7 or higher if everything goes well. If that happens, then I suppose I\u0027ll have to worry about expanding its search range.\"\n \"What!?\"\n To think they\u0027d be able to limit its search function to only high rank level 7 or higher undead. Aside from Lee Shin Woo and his Paul Zero Corps, then that only left the 12 generals or Steves!\n Lee Shin Woo knew that the Huginn\u0027s Eye could differentiate between species, but hadn\u0027t known that it could differentiate between levels as well. Lee Shin Woo was shocked, but Kratia explained that if she could reproduce the heroes\u0027 ability to estimate stats, as well as an ability to gauge the density of mana, then it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult. Wouldn\u0027t that be bordering on God\u0027s domain!?\n [The information network is functioning properly as well. If you remodel me, then I should be able to modify the artifact myself.]\n \"Oooh!\"\n If that happens, then it would be much more effective than following Arema Steelworker\u0027s movements. Moreover, if he were able to divide it and observe based on the situation, then...!\n \"That\u0027s really cool...\"\n \"I think I can guess what you\u0027re imagining right now, Shin Woo...\"\n \"In any case, we\u0027re still researching on that front, and we\u0027ve made good progress on limiting its range to golems. It\u0027s paramount that we figure out how to use the excess energy to increase the search range, but even if it\u0027s a level 8 item, I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll work just yet. So I\u0027ll add some more materials and remodel it later.\"\n In the process of restoring the Titan Golem, it seemed like the responsibility of manufacturing the artifact had fallen onto Kratia, as she responded so confidently. She was so trustworthy!\n If he could, he would\u0027ve expressed his happiness to Kratia, but if he did, then Jin, who was preoccupied with Kratia, would get pissed at Lee Shin Woo, so he decided against it.\n \"Then, I\u0027ll leave that to you. Since we\u0027ll probably get a chance to use it in the field soon.\"\n \"You still haven\u0027t contacted that senior?\"\n \"Now that you mention it, I think it\u0027s time I checked.\"\n \"But Shin Woo, are you going to keep bringing them with you?\"\n Jin asked. He thought that Lee Shin Woo would\u0027ve sent his troops away once they left the mountain range, but Lee Shin Woo instructed Jin to move slow enough that they could keep up.\n \"Mm, well...\"\n \"I\u0027d really like to start running now...\"\n \"Just wait a little while longer. I\u0027m thinking right now.\"\n \"What about...?\"\n As if waiting for him to ask, Lee Shin Woo spoke.\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking about this, but I confirmed my suspicions when I accepted a portion of Metafel\u0027s troops and the Giants. ...I can\u0027t keep these guys hidden anymore.\"\n \"...Yeah, that\u0027s true.\"\n Metafel\u0027s defected troops numbered 3,000, and each and every Giant really stood out. Because they weren\u0027t golems, the Giants had to live with their large size, as they had no means of miniaturizing their bodies.\n \"I made these guys move around in small teams thus far as an investment, but I have too many troops for that to be a viable option anymore. Even so, I can\u0027t just keep them holed up in a safe base. If I don\u0027t use them, then I\u0027ll be losing out on my investment.\"\n \"So...?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to keep using a few teams of elites like I\u0027ve been doing, and gather the rest of them into a huge army.\"\n That was quite a rational decision... No, it was actually just a decision he was forced into, as his army had grown too much. Lee Shin Woo knew that this would happen eventually and that\u0027s why he sought an item like Huginn\u0027s Eye.\n \"What if they\u0027re found by a hero?\"\n \"Normally, heroes wouldn\u0027t choose to fight against these guys.\"\n \"Shin Woo, so you realized that you\u0027re not a normal hero yourself...\"\n If it were Lee Shin Woo, he would\u0027ve agonized over the amount of level 7 elites, but he\u0027d charge in and sow chaos; then, once he\u0027d profited from that, he\u0027d retreat. Lee Shin Woo sweat at Jin\u0027s words but continued.\n \"The problem\u0027s the 12 generals. Because of them, I hid my forces for as long as I could, but... when you think about it the other way, you could bait the 12 generals by commanding such a huge army.\"\n \"Shin Woo, only you could think about it like that.\"\n \"You already killed two of the 12 generals. The other heroes are just cowards.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s right.\"\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s goblin fire intensified. This is what he would look like when he was talking about something serious.\n \"I think that time\u0027s coming soon. When Paul Zero meets with the heroes.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to try?\"\n \"Yeah. Since I\u0027ll have to do it eventually anyway.\"\n He was still bothered by what Lee Man Bok had told him, but even so, he had to at least try. There was nothing good about maintaining this three-way stalemate for Lee Shin Woo.\n \"But Lee Man Bok\u0027s concerns had merit, so I\u0027ll have to approach them as cordially as possible.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"As reinforcements.\"\n \"!?\"\n If an undead suddenly showed up in front of the heroes, who enjoyed such peaceful days, and said \u0027can I hang out with you too?\u0027, they would definitely look at him with suspicion.\n But if they were struggling against one of the 12 generals, and his righteous undead army suddenly appeared to save them, then... There wouldn\u0027t be any heroes who would go \u0027kill them too!\u0027 without thinking, would there? Even if there were, wouldn\u0027t the heroes focus on killing one of the 12 generals first?\n \"If we fight on the same battlefield and on the same side, then it\u0027ll be difficult for them to attack us. And that\u0027s how we\u0027ll gradually change their perception of us.\"\n \"But how are you going to make such a convenient situation for yourself?\"\n \"Normally, it would be hard, but we have Ethan Cruz, now don\u0027t we?\"\n \"...\"\n Jin was speechless at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s statement. Kratia silently applauded. They couldn\u0027t even imagine how many problems he hoped to deal with using Ethan Cruz.\n \"We already know how Ethan Cruz thinks. Who knows, he might\u0027ve allied himself with one of the 12 generals already. If that\u0027s the case, then all the more reason for him to put the heroes into a difficult situation. But think about it. That\u0027s when we appear! And what happens when the Paul Zero Corps comes in to save the day?\"\n \"Shin Woo... have you ever lost before?\"\n \"I have. When I was negotiating with God and got stuck in an undead body.\"\n \"...\"\n Honestly, that wasn\u0027t really a negotiation, but more like stubbornness. Lee Shin Woo thought back to that time, calmly assessed himself, and nodded his head.\n Back then, he\u0027d tried his best to remain level-headed, but he had died, he came face to face with God, and he would have to fight against the Empire ruled by the dead as a hero; all these factors overlapped, so he hadn\u0027t been able to stay calm. Thus, he thought he did pretty well back then, all things considered.\n \"It\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re not an enemy, Shin Woo...\"\n \"I feel bad for Ethan Cruz.\"\n While Jin and Kratia muttered in the outfield, Lee Shin Woo had made his decision and announced.\n \"So, let\u0027s practice moving as a corps.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"We\u0027re going to attack a level 3 danger zone. Wouldn\u0027t it be cool if we split the army into two and attacked two at the same time?\"\n \"...\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you just split them into five and attack, making them into a cute star or something?\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a good idea.\"\n \"...\"\n It was almost time for the \u0027Paul Zero Corps\u0027 to spread their name far and wide throughout the Empire.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-170","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
