War\u0027s Scenario - 6\u003e Once Lee Shin Woo had realized that the Lich had invaded the chatting channel, he had first split the Erems into \u0027two squads\u0027 and mobilized them. [We\u0027ve found him, Master.] \"As I expected. Hurray for the Mana Radar.\" First was the area where Silene and the Archmage were located. It was a small city situated near the level 4 danger zone, Bayran. He sent the Erems, satisfying the condition for Fire Shadow, and then waited for the right moment. He could, of course, defeat the Archmage without all this preparation. An innate element? Lee Shin Woo knew, as someone who often used innate elements, that someone who\u0027d just awakened an innate element couldn\u0027t contend with someone who possessed five. If the Archmage had simultaneously reached level 9 as well, then it would be a different story. However, he wasn\u0027t there yet. Not at all. [But security is strict.] \"Ok, I\u0027ll go personally.\" Then why had he sent the Erems ahead of him? This could be explained by the second preceding battle. Lee Shin Woo and Seagald were ahead in terms of pure power, and the Archmage\u0027s space element had been sealed, leading to his head being split apart. However, he was a Lich, a being that could revive itself several times. As long as his life vessel remains intact, he could regain his physical body and revive himself any number of times. This was really a case of the pot calling the kettle black, as he possessed a revival ability of his own (Invisible Heart), but it was so cowardly! If Lee Shin Woo just went and killed him, then it\u0027d be such a waste of a good opportunity; the Lich was outside of the capital, but if he killed him, then he\u0027d just revive himself! [Please be careful, Master. They are powerful.] \"They won\u0027t be able to notice me. Don\u0027t worry.\" Lee Shin Woo had split the Erems into two, sending the other squad \u0027to a different location\u0027. Where, you ask...? [Security\u0027s tight. It\u0027s perfect.] [The Lord Archmage commanded us to be wary of Seagald Von Retadane\u0027s mana response.] [With this artifact, the \u0027Anti-Skull Mana Detector\u0027, which was personally created by the Archmage himself, we should be able to find him, even if he completely erases his presence and reappears!] He had sent them to a secret facility within the capital which housed the container for the Archmage\u0027s soul, or life vessel. \u0027I thought he was an idiot, like any undead, for leaving the capital, but it looks like he\u0027s not. But to think they\u0027ve created an artifact specifically for Seagald. It seems like they really were worried about him. ...Though I\u0027m not sure if that thing can actually detect the Annihilation Flame or not.\u0027 The Mana Radar\u0027s top priority was to locate the Archmage and the Emperor\u0027s life vessel. And once he\u0027d created the Mana Radar, he checked the locations of their life vessels, but it\u0027s not like he could be like... \u0027let\u0027s go destroy their souls now!\u0027. The Archmage\u0027s life vessel was stored in an extremely vital building within the capital, and Seldin would stay around it when he had nothing better to do. On the other hand, the Emperor\u0027s life vessel was located in the deepest part of the palace. In other words, it was near impossible for anyone to steal their life vessels undetected! \u0027If I didn\u0027t have Annihilation Flame, that is...\u0027 At first, he thought he had no other option but to fight head-on and destroy the Archmage\u0027s life vessel before he had a chance to recover. In terms of destroying the life vessel, charging headfirst or fighting them head-on wasn\u0027t much different. But with Seagald\u0027s Annihilation Flame, he had another option. It was unlikely to work with the Emperor\u0027s life vessel, but he was confident that he could steal the Archmage\u0027s life vessel in his absence! \u0027Why didn\u0027t the Archmage hide his life vessel in the palace too?\u0027 He thought of several reasons. One, the Archmage wasn\u0027t entirely loyal to the Emperor, or two, it could be dangerous to store two life vessels in the same location... If it was neither of the two, then perhaps two life vessels couldn\u0027t be placed near each other. \u0027From what I\u0027m seeing, that seems like the most likely option here.\u0027 This black crystal, which was protected by countless undead, shook its surroundings and emitted an uncanny energy. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head. He\u0027d always been curious as to how a life vessel was made, but he could make a guess after looking at it. It mostly consisted of the space and darkness elements, as well as layers upon layers of unknown magic. The life vessel required careful storage and another life vessel couldn\u0027t be placed in its direct vicinity. \u0027And it looks like that crystal took a piece of the source of darkness too... That\u0027s what comes from just taking a little bit of it? If that\u0027s the case, then what exactly is the darkness that lay beneath the palace... Hey, wait a sec.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo thought, but then tilted his head. The source of darkness was beneath the palace. And the Emperor\u0027s life vessel was beneath the palace as well. If that\u0027s the case, then... did that damn Emperor use the source of darkness itself as his life vessel!? When he actually saw the Archmage\u0027s life vessel, what had once seemed a delusion had turned out to be a reality! \u0027Hey, that means that killing the Emperor and purifying the Empire are one in the same.\u0027 It didn\u0027t matter anyway; in the end, he needed to do both. Lee Shin Woo thought about the steep obstacle he\u0027d have to face within the palace and sighed deeply. He soon refocused on his current situation. If he wasted anymore time here then Lloyd and Erian would die. Honestly, he really didn\u0027t care what happened to them, but he didn\u0027t really want to see Prince cry. \u0027First, let\u0027s make a backup.\u0027 The Archmage\u0027s life vessel was stored very carefully; just because he\u0027d found the life vessel didn\u0027t mean that it was smooth sailing from now on. Not only were several level 7 elite undead standing guard (though many of them had been annihilated by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s light blast), but there were also dozens of space-type traps that activated upon the entrance of an intruder. And by touching the life vessel, several more traps would activate. Lastly, once the life vessel disappeared, another trap would be activated. And even with all that, the Archmage usually remained close to his life vessel, so he really was careful. [The Intermediate Annihilation Flame Element has become Lv2 and Magic has increased by 20.] \u0027I\u0027m good, except for that last trap.\u0027 But Lee Shin Woo\u0027s power, or more specifically, Annihilation Flame, allowed him to ignore most of the traps. By erasing his presence, the traps didn\u0027t have anyone to target. There was an error in the activation process, so the traps didn\u0027t even activate. It was simple. \u0027...Good. I switched it out!\u0027 As for the final trap, which activated upon the life vessel\u0027s disappearance, Lee Shin Woo switched the real life vessel with a fake created with his Disguise skill, preventing the trap from triggering. In the short period of time in which he switched the two, Lee Shin Woo had also used his Shining Flame on the magic circle (which made up the trap), and erased cause-and-effect. And by adding in his Acting skill, he was able to do it with ease! Though he was forced to use a significant amount of mana for this brief distortion, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s level wasn\u0027t just for show! He was able to replace the real life vessel with a fake one before his mana bottomed out. \u0027The fake won\u0027t last for very long.\u0027 But it didn\u0027t need to last that long. He had the Archmage\u0027s life vessel in his grasp and planned to go straight to the Archmage with it in tow. [Artifact, all clear.] [Treasure, all clear.] [I want to fight.] [I want to eat meat.] He took a peek at the undead, who stood guard without even knowing what he\u0027d done, grinned, and left the facility. \u0027Annihilation Flame\u0027s totally overpowered. It seems better than Dark Shadow.\u0027 He sent a message to the other Erem and then activated Fire Shadow, allowing him to instantaneously travel to a far off location... where the Archmage was oppressing the heroes. With a single glance, he saw his seniors, the undead heroes he hadn\u0027t killed yet, with his juniors, as well as the Archmage, who looked down at them in satisfaction from midair. Lee Shin Woo felt he\u0027d hit his limit with Annihilation Flame, so he chose to reveal himself then and there. His intro had enough impact to cause the Archmage to freeze completely! \"And time begins to move once more...\" [H-How? How do you have my heart!?] \"That\u0027s not what\u0027s important. The fact is that I have your heart in my hands.\" Lee Shin Woo smiled at the Archmage and squeezed the crystal. But surprisingly, the once frantic Archmage had regained his composure. [But you didn\u0027t break it. You came all this way and brought it to me without breaking it.] \"Hoh.\" At that moment, Lee Shin Woo was truly surprised. Lee Shin Woo could tell that the Lich was trying to use his mana on the life vessel. It was the space element. He was using the fusion element of darkness and space, the Dark Space element, on the crystal. The power of space flowed through the darkness; an element that allowed him unlimited control over anything consisting of darkness... It was truly a formidable ability. Especially when he considered that it was difficult to use the space element effectively against another level 9. While this could be replicated with a maxed out darkness element, Dark Space set itself apart; the darkness encroached space, and the ability to control said space was maximized. Perhaps Dark Space was the element most compatible with the darkness element. [Your biggest mistake was your arrogance. You should\u0027ve known that I\u0027d have awakened a new power upon seeing yours!] \"Oooooh!\" The life vessel was already in the Lich\u0027s hand! Lee Shin Woo was astonished and applauded him. The next moment, a black flame ignited over the Archmage\u0027s palm. Now, the life vessel had returned to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s hand. It was quite obvious, but he had used his maxed out darkness element, Dark Shadow, and Dark Flame together. Of course, the Archmage didn\u0027t really understand what had happened. Regardless of how great his innate element was, there was no way that he could overcome Lee Shin Woo, who possessed five of them...! [...?] \"It was nice. I\u0027ll give you an 8.\" Darkness blazed upon his palm and devoured the life vessel. The reason he hadn\u0027t destroyed the life vessel and come straight here was because of the off chance that the Lich would explode, taking Lloyd and Erian with him. [Fully destroying and absorbing the Lv8 Archmage Feotane Von Seldin\u0027s Life Vessel through Bone Reinforcement. You have completely absorbed the magic source, and Magic has increased by 230.] [The soul is returning to its owner.] Once all traces of the life vessel disappeared, Lee Shin Woo felt a full amount of mana welling with him. It wasn\u0027t like Lee Shin Woo\u0027s mana, which he\u0027d acquired through Bone Reinforcement or through adapting to his circumstances, but purely the Archmage\u0027s own mana, one who\u0027d followed the path of a magician his entire life. He couldn\u0027t even begin to describe the satisfaction and the joy he felt! \"Ah, I guess I can\u0027t take in an entire soul, even with my abilities.\" [G-Gugaaaaaahk!] With the life vessel\u0027s destruction, the Archmage\u0027s soul was forcefully ejected and returned to him. However, the Archmage wasn\u0027t able to withstand the pain. He screamed and started rolling around in the air. He\u0027d lost control of his mana and spread it out everywhere, but it was all stained by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s darkness and eliminated. Destroying his life vessel, the return of his soul, as well as the Lich\u0027s anguish from its return were... all great experiences in killing Liches. It would help when he killed the Emperor! \"You made one mistake, Lich.\" [Guaaaaaah!] Lee Shin Woo quickly stabbed the Lich with the Death God\u0027s Shining Bone Sword and then said with a somber expression. \"You met me.\" While the Archmage\u0027s magic was high, his actual defensive capabilities were quite low, so the Shining Bone Sword cut him to pieces. Fortunately, his bone showed up properly this time.
