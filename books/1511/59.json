New Relationship - 4\u003e\\n\\n The city, several dozens of years following the fall of the Empire, looked truly wretched. It had only been dozens of years since, yet the sturdy bricks and cement, and the houses formed of a material foreign to them had mostly fallen apart.\\n\\n The undead curse not only transformed living beings into the undead, but also withered away and killed anything that was still alive, so it was only natural that the city was in this state. It truly was a curse that killed the world itself. Whenever he looked at it this way, he realized how frightening the curse actually was.\\n\\n \"The other cities we\u0027ve gone to weren\u0027t like this.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because those cities were small. And they were on the outskirts... Since there wasn\u0027t much in those cities, it didn\u0027t look as bad.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was definitely right. The cities they\u0027d passed by until now didn\u0027t have an assortment of goods, but this unknown city, possessed huge walls, a commercial district, as well as a slum area.\\n\\n There were streets leading to the houses, a city hall, as well as traces of various people in different places trading with each other. It wasn\u0027t just leftover goods; there were also traces of people.\\n\\n [The weather\u0027s great. It seems like it\u0027ll rain soon.]\\n\\n [Ha. Did you hear that the Lord is coming to visit this street today?]\\n\\n The only undead they\u0027d met before entering the city had been an undead battalion in the middle of patrolling, but after entering the city, their surroundings were littered with undead.\\n\\n It might\u0027ve seemed obvious, but just because it was a danger level 2 zone didn\u0027t mean that there were high level undead everywhere. Rather, most of them were level 1 undead. They didn\u0027t really have any special features and the only piece of information that appeared was [Lv1 Skeleton]. If they were still human, they probably would\u0027ve shown up as [Lv1 Human].\\n\\n [Haha, that costs 3 Perium. I can\u0027t give you a discount.]\\n\\n [That\u0027s too expensive. Then throw in that small one, too.]\\n\\n \"...How is this possible?\"\\n\\n Jin had forgotten that they were travelling incognito and spoke stiffly. Lee Shin Woo could understand how he was feeling. That\u0027s because the skeletons were haggling over a valueless rock.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re repeating what they did when they were still alive. The lower leveled the undead, the more the rely on their instincts...\"\\n\\n \"... I was looking forward to it a little bit.\"\\n\\n Jin, who realized that speaking a little louder wouldn\u0027t release Stealth, spoke bitterly.\\n\\n \"I may just be speaking nonsense as the skeletons you\u0027ve made into your subordinates abandoned their still \u0027alive\u0027 general and decided to follow you as their Captain, but in any case...\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re acting based on their own will.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n One couldn\u0027t say the Pauls\u0027 conditions were normal either. But despite being tricked by Lee Shin Woo, they definitely understood that they had become skeletons and moved accordingly. Just that was enough to make them look \u0027normal\u0027.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve restored their egos and have even given them a name; I really am like their savior.\"\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying.\"\\n\\n Jin denied him right away. At the beginning, he wondered why Lee Shin Woo had set the skeletons free, but he\u0027d ultimately turned them into his subordinates once they seemed like they would be useful!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s fickleness was truly frightening. The only thing he was sure of was that Lee Shin Woo would always be true to himself. It felt a bit awkward thinking about it any further, so he decided to change topics.\\n\\n \"...Is killing them the only way to save them?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t misunderstand. They\u0027re already dead. Even if you talk to them, they probably don\u0027t even remember their names.\"\\n\\n \"Then what about us? We\u0027re undead, too.\"\\n\\n \"We can say our names. That means we\u0027re not dead.\"\\n\\n It sounded quite simple, but there was a much more complicated meaning within that statement. Whenever Lee Shin Woo would say something like this, Jin would admire him a bit, but he didn\u0027t really want to accept that Lee Shin Woo had more knowledge or wisdom than him when he was already stronger than him as well, so he didn\u0027t say it out loud.\\n\\n \"There\u0027re a lot of level 1s here, but it\u0027s not a danger level 2 zone for nothing. The closer we get to the center of the city, the more tightly-guarded it\u0027ll be, so focus on your connection with me.\"\\n\\n \"Mine\u0027s at Beginner Lv7, so it won\u0027t be tough for me.\"\\n\\n Of course, Jin didn\u0027t have the ability to learn Stealth, but while going through a few small towns, they discovered a rural rat nest dungeon; Lee Shin Woo gave Jin all of the rat bones, and as a result, he was barely able to learn Stealth. Both of them knew the same skill, so it was easy to raise the effectiveness of his skill through their connection.\\n\\n [Through the connection from the Horseback Riding skill, the Stealth skillâ€™s effectiveness increases. In special situations, the skill proficiency rapidly increases.]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo and Jin took the opportunity and escaped the notice of the two skeletons, who were stuck in the past, and slowly went around the city like ghosts. The shadows cast by the ruined buildings easily concealed them, and they observed the city, as if they were memorizing every facet of it.\\n\\n \"We shouldn\u0027t even worry about the level 2 ones, right?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re at least level 3 elites over here. We don\u0027t need to count them if they\u0027re not even level 3 elites.\"\\n\\n No matter how strong they were, they wouldn\u0027t be able to handle overwhelming numbers. That\u0027s how Lee Shin Woo had thought in the past. However, that was something that only applied to Earth. Even if thousands of level 3 golems came rushing at him right now, he was confident that he could take them all on without even breaking a single bone.\\n\\n There was the fact that there was an overwhelming disparity between their stats, but also because undead possessed the special characteristic of never physically tiring.\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s also the same for skeletons, as well.\u0027\\n\\n But that also meant that there was a high possibility that he would be helpless against a higher leveled undead. Those were the ones that Lee Shin Woo had to find and kill first.\\n\\n Of course, it wouldn\u0027t have been too difficult for them to just straight up attack them since they had the level 6 magician, Kratia, but since she would reduce their contribution, they had moved quickly.\\n\\n \u0027Honestly, I wanted to take my time and look around, as this is the first city that seems big enough to be called a city.\u0027\\n\\n They had pretty much finished up clearing the outskirts of the Empire, so now it was time to deal with the danger level 2 zones. It wasn\u0027t a bad idea to go through the cities and ascertain their levels while they still had the assistance of a level 6 magician. Though of course, each city would have their own specific circumstances...\\n\\n \u0027There are a lot of knights. There\u0027re at least ten skeleton knights above the walls, and there are five knights that periodically go on a patrol. And there are thirty of them on standby in shifts inside of their private barracks...\u0027\\n\\n If a hero were acting alone, they would likely feel terrified at around this time. Because they only had one life, they wouldn\u0027t have been able to boldly infiltrate the city like Lee Shin Woo, and they wouldn\u0027t even dream of attacking the city by themselves.\\n\\n \u0027It would definitely be impossible for a level 4 hero, and even if they were level 5... It would only be possible with a few level 5 heroes.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized why heroes preferred going through dungeons. The cities were huge and difficult to kill undead popped out in various areas. On the other hand, monsters popped out regularly in the dungeon, and would provide a more definite reward, so it was the much more attractive option.\\n\\n [Shino Rendu: Even though it\u0027s a danger level 2 zone, it would still take more than a year to fully clear it with a few people. Take down the high priority targets first, and then look for the right opportunity to take down the rest. Remember, Lee Shin Woo. Your life is most important.]\\n\\n Shino Rendu was the most hot-blooded amongst his seniors and even he spoke like that. So he could understand why his seniors grew so slowly. He could even understand why they cheered whenever they discovered a dungeon...\\n\\n \"Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo heard Jin\u0027s voice and then froze too. When he, who had been lost in thought, raised his head, he understood why Jin\u0027s voice was so stiff.\\n\\n In an area slightly askew to the city\u0027s center square, and in front of an imposing mansion above a sloping road, there was giant monster roaming around... No, it was a golem. It wasn\u0027t just a normal golem either. It boasted a height of around 4 meters, and its imposingness seemed unshakable...!\\n\\n [Lv5 Iron Golem - I0918 (Elite)]\\n\\n \"A level 5 golem...!?\"\\n\\n As he thought, after the Bronze Golem was the Iron Golem, the one he was most worried about. It had only gone from level 4 to level 5, yet why did it suddenly seem so upgraded; when he thought about it, the difference between level 4 and 5 was like the difference between the heaven and the earth, so he could roughly understand too.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, you haven\u0027t seen it yet, huh. The golem\u0027s not the problem.\"\\n\\n \"No, it is a problem. Why is the golem living in a place outside of where it was produced... no.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was speaking and then stopped, groaning at his stupidity. Why were the golems created from the very beginning? It was probably to protect the Empire.\\n\\n Of course, after the fall of the Empire, the several golems didn\u0027t have a place to go and were abandoned, but until then, the manufactured golems were probably sent to various regions in the Empire! And that golem was one of them.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something controlling that golem.\"\\n\\n \"Something controlling it!?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was shocked. And despite yelling in shock, his Stealth wasn\u0027t released; that fact shocked him even more! What\u0027s worse, at that moment, his skill leveled up!\\n\\n [The Low Rank Stealth skill has become level 10, and evolved into the Intermediate level. You do not possess the talent to covertly kill your opponent, but you do possess the ability to move secretly and quickly. You have learned the Intermediate Shadow Sprint skill. Agility and Magic have increased by 10. The higher the skill level, the lighter the shadow.]\\n\\n \u0027I lost Combat Sprint and gained Shadow Sprint....\u0027\\n\\n How ironic. Moreover, he could use this skill in tandem with his connection with Jin to draw out its full ability, making it a truly effective skill. Lee Shin Woo was satisfied by the result that came out from his negligence and smiled. Jin called out to him with a cold voice.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re done checking out your skill, then could you start checking that guy now?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, my bad.\"\\n\\n He scratched his hairless head and looked at the area that Jin had pointed at. It was the mansion\u0027s balcony, and he could see the undead that stood at the balcony. It was a level 5 undead, and it was none other than the lord, the [Skeleton Commander]! And gripped within its emaciated finger bones, there was...\\n\\n \u0027A core...?\u0027\\n\\n It felt as though he\u0027d received a blunt impact to his head. That\u0027s right. They couldn\u0027t control the golem\u0027s mana on the outside, so they would instead control the core that produced their mana! Lee Shin Woo had never enlisted the aid of an object to help him radiate his mana, so he\u0027d never thought about it before.\\n\\n \u0027But is that the only option available?\u0027\\n\\n If the core could change even an undead\u0027s mana to that of a golem\u0027s, then wouldn\u0027t there be no reason that he, who had absorbed the golems\u0027 magic knowledge and everything, couldn\u0027t do the same?\\n\\n Hadn\u0027t he been thinking about this too complicatedly? Guillotine Steelworker might have caused him to tunnel vision on his statement, that none other than the golems could create that seal, and had approached the matter in a much more complicated way than needed. It was time to start fresh.\\n\\n \"I feel like I\u0027ll be able to know for sure after killing that guy and examining the core...\"\\n\\n \"Hold on, Shin Woo. The Shriek of the Dead doesn\u0027t work on golems.\"\\n\\n \"...Yeah, that\u0027s a good point.\"\\n\\n They could only see one outside, but considering how they could feel the same quality of mana within the mansion, there weren\u0027t just one or two golems. They didn\u0027t know if they could take care of the golems quickly, and if they factored in the concentration of knights nearby the mansion, it would be best to retreat.\\n\\n \"...Yeah, I got it. Let\u0027s give up on killing the lord first. Let\u0027s start at another place. Just not here.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a good idea.\"\\n\\n There were several sections of this city that they hadn\u0027t checked yet. Lee Shin Woo and Jin completely backed off from the lord\u0027s mansion in order to perfectly conquer the city without injury.\\n\\n Forty minutes later, horrific screams resounded through the city. The battle had just begun.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-59","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
