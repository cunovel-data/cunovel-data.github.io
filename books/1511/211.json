Fake Hero Saga - 4\u003e\\n\\n \u0027Haa...\u0027\\n\\n Jin didn\u0027t seem like he was in a good mood all throughout their trip to the capital. Was it because Lee Shin Woo had made him draw their wagon, so that his cover (as a normal horse) wouldn\u0027t be blown? No, it wasn\u0027t that simple. Jin was definitely dissatisfied with his partner.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was absolutely sure that he hadn\u0027t figured out about his complete human transformation, but he was also reluctant to ask Jin what was wrong, so he just shut his mouth for the time being.\\n\\n \"The weather\u0027s great!\"\\n\\n [It really is. It\u0027s so clear, as if it\u0027s wishing us happiness in the future. I guess there are some things worth seeing on the surface.]\\n\\n Whereas Sinea and Ye Jin Jin couldn\u0027t be happier, sitting opposite to Lee Shin Woo in the wagon. What was he hiding? He was with Sinea on the first day, and Ye Jin Jin on the second... They were so boisterous, so much so that it seemed like they\u0027d go to heaven, due to the \u0027entertainment\u0027 he\u0027d provided with the date. Lee Shin Woo had asked them to restrain themselves; apparently this was them \u0027restrained\u0027.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be so loud.\"\\n\\n \"Ok!\"\\n\\n [Ok. Hoo. Hoo.]\\n\\n Those girls knew, of course, how Jin was feeling; more than Lee Shin Woo anyway. That\u0027s why they tried their very best to not show how happy they were, but there was no way for them to hide the happiness and joy they felt.\\n\\n Their reactions reminded him of his friend when he had first started dating his girlfriend. No, now that he thought about it, they were reacting similarly to his friend.\\n\\n \"Mr. Shin Woo, that cloud looks like your eye socket!\"\\n\\n [Hoo, no matter how I look at it, it looks more like his sacrum than his eye socket.]\\n\\n \"Do you guys always look at my bones so closely on a regular basis...?\"\\n\\n \u0027...Keuk.\u0027\\n\\n And whenever they engaged in more intimate skinship, he could hear Jin\u0027s hit points going down.\\n\\n \u0027Be honest. What did you do to them? Did you by any chance...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you. They\u0027ve been working hard, so I complimented them a little bit... After that, I guess we had a date. It was a commercial service. A service.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A date is a service...\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo could hear Jin\u0027s voice through the Assimilation skill and responded naturally. There was absolutely nothing wrong with his attitude. Of course, Jin didn\u0027t trust him right away, as he\u0027d travelled with this Joker for so long, but... he didn\u0027t have any evidence to pursue it with. So...\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m your partner... You shouldn\u0027t lie to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you, I\u0027m not lying to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really...?\u0027\\n\\n So Jin stopped his attempts at breaking Lee Shin Woo\u0027s unbreakable mask, and tried to hit at his conscience instead.\\n\\n \u0027Of course. You\u0027re my partner. My only partner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027...Your only partner.\u0027\\n\\n However, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t have a conscience, so it was completely ineffective. Unfortunately, Jin didn\u0027t know that, so he decided to accept his explanation.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I guess it makes sense, since those girls\u0027 mental state hasn\u0027t been normal since the beginning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re the worst. You looked like you were being friendly to Ye Jin Jin!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This and that are two different things. Yeah, I was being friendly, but she\u0027s still crazy.\u0027\\n\\n Of course, just because Jin had accepted his explanation didn\u0027t mean he was completely over it. Since Ye Jin Jin and Sinea were still clinging onto Lee Shin Woo, and he was still drawing the wagon!\\n\\n \"It feels kind of lonely since we left. I wanted to stay in Kuroa\u0027s Glory for about ten more days.\"\\n\\n \"Our shop doesn\u0027t have any holidays. If you want to take a break, then apply for a vacation. Of course, it\u0027d be unpaid leave.\"\\n\\n In the past, Lee Shin Woo had worked in a vicious enterprise that exploited him, and he was carrying on that tradition for the Lawrence shop. After all, this is how you got rid of bad habits.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care if I\u0027m not paid, but it\u0027s meaningless if I\u0027m the only one resting. I wanted to go sightseeing with you, Mr. Shin Woo...\"\\n\\n [Hoo. Once we get to the capital, Paul Zero will be working hard again. I\u0027d rather time just stopped right now.]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had invested a day into Sinea and a day into Ye Jin Jin, so he couldn\u0027t rest anymore. Of course, he didn\u0027t forget to play board games with Jin in his free time. Honestly speaking, he was more comfortable with Jin than with them (the business targets).\\n\\n \"Ah, I can kind of see the capital\u0027s walls. Shin Woo, what are you going to do about the paladins that are following us?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be working on behalf of the Sun God religion, while I\u0027ll be staying at the Lawrence shop, so there\u0027s no reason to go in together. Moreover, if I stay too close to the Sun God religion, then it\u0027ll be hard for people to approach Lawrence to negotiate with Kay.\"\\n\\n \"As expected of you, Mr. Shin Woo. To think that far ahead...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t planning on ruining his alliance with the Sun God religion, but he also wasn\u0027t going to avoid the influential individuals in the capital. If he could gain information, assistance, or form personal connections by meeting with them, then he had no reason not to.\\n\\n \u0027The Sun God religion had more power than I had initially assumed. Since my name was spread to about half of the Empire by just clearing five dungeons... It goes without saying that my name was spread to Kuroa\u0027s Glory and the adjacent capital. The nobles in the capital might be tense.\u0027\\n\\n Normally, an individual recognized as a saint by a religious order isn\u0027t someone often seen. A saint had to possess power that displayed the god\u0027s distinct characteristic, such that everyone in the religious order would acknowledge them. At the same time, they had to have a meek personality that obeyed their orders.\\n\\n Plus, Lee Shin Woo had enough power to clear a level 6 dungeon by himself, which had made a strong impression on not only the other religious orders, but the nobles in the capital as well. Furthermore, he was Lawrence\u0027s sponsor, the same Lawrence that had had such a successful auction!\\n\\n According to a report he\u0027d gotten through the golem network, people were selling books in the capital detailing the peddler Lawrence and the hero Kay\u0027s friendship and successes. With this, he wouldn\u0027t have to worry about people recognizing either Lawrence or Kay. But for some reason, he was a bit concerned about the contents of the book. He would get Ye Jin Jin to buy it for him later and check it for himself.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, my position in the capital will be set once I clear the unconquered level 7 dungeon. I\u0027ll have as much power as a high rank noble, and in a way, an image that surpasses that of a [Hero].\u0027\\n\\n If he wasn\u0027t going to engage in an all-out war with the surface, then he had to take this opportunity to create a foothold in the capital. He had, of course, given Bisher Moon that mission, but there were things one could do in the light that couldn\u0027t be done in the darkness.\\n\\n \"B-But you can\u0027t succumb to temptation, even if they offer their daughter to you or something.\"\\n\\n \"Even though the Sun God religion has acknowledged me as a saint, I\u0027m still originally a mercenary. The nobles won\u0027t give up their daughters so easily. But they might send me a prostitute disguised as a young lady of the house or their daughter.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t! I\u0027ll take care of all of that!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah.\"\\n\\n Ye Jin Jin acted so innocent, but said something so bold. Lee Shin Woo stroked her head and grinned. Of course, her concern was unnecessary. If need be, he could dispel his human transformation. With that, all his worldly desires would disappear, and he would become a Sage!\\n\\n Being able to control his sexual desires when speaking with other humans or negotiating with them was a huge advance. One\u0027s base desires would cause one\u0027s judgment to go askew, and it was especially difficult to control oneself when faced with an intelligent and attractive individual.\\n\\n However, Lee Shin Woo was now capable of switching to his \u0027Sage Mode\u0027 at will, so during a negotiation, he could dominate the other side!\\n\\n \u0027In that sense, Bisher Moon was the right choice to move in the shadows... Though he didn\u0027t know just how much he\u0027d accomplished here.\u0027\\n\\n He got his answer 30 minutes later. Once the front gate guards noticed his wagon, their eyes shined and they immediately welcomed him.\\n\\n \"Ah, you must be the party of the Sun God\u0027s hero and the Lawrence shop. We\u0027ve been waiting for you. Please, come inside.\"\\n\\n \"Your store branch in the capital has been completed. If you\u0027re going that way, then I can take you there myself.\"\\n\\n \"...I\u0027d appreciate it.\"\\n\\n He thought that perhaps Bisher Moon had done something to the guards to take advantage of the nobles, but once the lid was open, he found that it was the complete opposite.\\n\\n Just in case, he checked the guards\u0027 stats, but there was nothing suspicious about them; they were 100% human. While he was puzzled, one of the guards guiding them approached him and whispered.\\n\\n \"Lord Bisher said he\u0027d meet with you in the evening.\"\\n\\n \"...Can you tell him I got his message?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n As he thought, this human was under Bisher Moon\u0027s control! He didn\u0027t know if he commissioned them, or if one of his subordinates had infiltrated the guards, but he was amazing either way!\\n\\n As a regular business employee, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t know what Bisher had done to acquire such power in the capital.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll know after I hear it straight from him.\"\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps he did stuff like this in the past, before he became a hero,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo thought vaguely. At the end of the road, he could see an indistinct castle.\\n\\n It seemed completely hidden, but he could feel it. The existence of the Emperor within those walls, as well as magic greater than that of the Archmage. At that moment, he was sure of it. He was a lower level than him, but for some reason, he was able to roughly measure him.\\n\\n \u0027Level 9.\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027d expected this, but it felt different in person.\\n\\n Did the Emperor sense his presence as well? Even if he did, he would probably regard him as the Sun God\u0027s hero. There was also a chance he hadn\u0027t sensed him at all. Lee Shin Woo was confident that his mana control wouldn\u0027t lose to anyone.\\n\\n \u0027As I thought, it\u0027d be difficult to face a level 9. Is the Undead Emperor also level 9? He probably is... Ultimately, if I want to achieve my goals, then I need to take those two down.\u0027\\n\\n His magic had increased significantly and he\u0027d collected bones from the level 6 dungeons, which had increased his stats by a little. So, his current stat total was 12,392. He needed a little over 400 stats to reach level 8.\\n\\n But even if he reached level 8, he didn\u0027t think he could defeat the Emperor. Even if he used all his strength, using the Bone Armory, the Thorn Shadow, or even the fully charged level 8 Titan Bone Golem, he didn\u0027t think he would be able to win.\\n\\n That\u0027s just how overwhelming a level 9 was. Just by sensing the Emperor\u0027s existence from afar caused him to instinctively feel tense!\\n\\n \u0027So that\u0027s why he\u0027s so confidently emitting his magic. ...He doesn\u0027t know that I\u0027ll use that against him.\u0027\\n\\n Could he find his weakness and make use of it with just that exposure of mana?\\n\\n Yes, indeed. As long as Lee Shin Woo was the one fighting him at least.\\n\\n \"Now then, let\u0027s go see the place that Bisher Moon has prepared for us.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, Shin Woo\u0027s making that face again. Whenever he makes that face, someone dies...\"\\n\\n \"...Mr. Shin Woo, you\u0027re so cool.\"\\n\\n [It\u0027s perfect.]\\n\\n \"Why do all the girls involved with you have such perverted fetishes? Or does the world have some sort of proclivity towards the name \u0027Lee Shin Woo\u0027...?\"\\n\\n [I-I can feel the Emperor\u0027s mana... Can we go undiscovered? We probably won\u0027t be, but...]\\n\\n And thus, his party (they were all in the same situation but had different thoughts) successfully entered the capital. They\u0027d gotten in quietly without a hitch, but in the end their presence would be unavoidable... Everyone will know.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-211","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
