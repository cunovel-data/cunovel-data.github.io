Sun God\u0027s Hero - 7 [End of Volume 10]\u003e\\n\\n The Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel, entered his residence discreetly, as if she didn\u0027t want to be seen, and instead of giving Lee Shin Woo a friendly greeting, she said...\\n\\n \"Honestly, the best way you can help me is by letting me kill you.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be able to kill me, even if you brought all of the 12 Generals. You\u0027re well aware of this, so you came alone, no?\"\\n\\n \"...Yes.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo grinned at the Evileye General, who\u0027d suffered a total loss. She had been watching him while hiding out of sight... Her eyes were so sharp that they resembled that of a killer\u0027s, but it wasn\u0027t surprising anymore, so he just ignored it. \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s start with the situation you\u0027re in. I\u0027ve heard. Apparently, you\u0027re in a bit of a pickle, right?\"\\n\\n \"Who do you think is responsible for all this... Keuk. Anyway, you\u0027re right. I\u0027m being watched. Me, one of the 12 Generals. You have no idea how hard it was to sneak over here unnoticed!\"\\n\\n Did she really come unnoticed? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, expanded his senses, and scanned the surrounding area. Nothing bad would happen even if she had been discovered, but... as she said, no one had followed her, as per her title of as one of the 12 Generals.\\n\\n At this point, she was almost crying, and Lee Shin Woo smiled softly.\\n\\n \"It must\u0027ve been tough on you. So, who can you trade for your life?\"\\n\\n \"I... originally held the lowest seat amongst the 12 Generals. As you well know, I possess a special ability, so I was assigned to every important battle. But because I didn\u0027t have enough strength to protect myself, I wasn\u0027t able to go very far. My subordinates suffered the same fate, and they\u0027re not in the best position right now...\"\\n\\n In other words, there was no one she could even sell out. This part made her swell with emotion, as her eyes brimmed with tears.\\n\\n Coercing her didn\u0027t seem like the best course of action, as she would be just more intimidated than before. Therefore, Lee Shin Woo decided to increase their level of intimacy first.\\n\\n \"Then let\u0027s talk. How much I can help you depends on what information you can give me.\"\\n\\n \"Keuk...!\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no rush. Why don\u0027t you drink a cup of tea?\"\\n\\n The Evileye General felt slightly immoral for selling out her country, but... Lee Shin Woo\u0027s tea was so warm that it made her forget the situation she was in, and ended up relying upon that warmth.\\n\\n Even if she was the lowest seat, she was still one of the 12 Generals. She ended up telling him one or two things that he couldn\u0027t find out through the golem network. Moreover, this new info mixed with his old info, giving him more insight. And there was something particularly interesting amongst the information...\\n\\n \"Hmm, so the Emperor hasn\u0027t made an official appearance in years.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. The only ones who can see him are the 12 Generals and a small handful of high rank bureaucrats. But we can only see him at a certain time and at a certain place. I\u0027ve never met him in the daytime.\"\\n\\n \"...Hmm.\"\\n\\n Learning about the Emperor\u0027s appearance was huge. Information regarding the Emperor was top secret... and Lee Shin Woo felt like he was really suspicious.\\n\\n \"Of course, His Majesty is a remarkable individual, so we have no idea what he wants or what he\u0027s thinking about... But those who slander his name are coming up with all kinds of false rumors. For example...\"\\n\\n \"For example, the Emperor\u0027s a Vampire. Something like that?\"\\n\\n \"Gah!\"\\n\\n The Evileye General stiffened. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and continued.\\n\\n \"He only operates at night, so anyone would think he\u0027s a Vampire. So what is he for real?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll pay if His Majesty finds out that you\u0027ve put him in the same boat as the undead! He\u0027s a human. His complexion and even his mana are completely human as well...!\"\\n\\n \"Despite that, the rumors that he\u0027s a Vampire won\u0027t cease. Aren\u0027t you at least a little suspicious?\"\\n\\n \"Ugh.\"\\n\\n The Evileye General stiffened once more. She was sensitive to any unfavorable remark made about the Emperor, as if she had been brainwashed.\\n\\n At that moment, an alarm rang in his head. The feeling got even stronger, so he scanned his surroundings, but there was no one here \u0027besides the Evileye General\u0027. \\n\\n \"That\u0027s... They just don\u0027t know how great His Majesty truly is, and aren\u0027t aware of what\u0027s in store for them. His Majesty is an Archmage and has realized something we haven\u0027t, so we cannot judge him...\"\\n\\n Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo had already considered the Emperor a Vampire, or considered other possibilities that might apply. \\n\\n Before, when he\u0027d gotten the report from Bisher Moon regarding the Red Moon, he had been surprised by how bold the Vampire had been, but... if the Emperor himself was also a Vampire, everything mades sense.\\n\\n \u0027If that\u0027s the case, then God wasn\u0027t referring to the Undead Emperor, but to the...\u0027\\n\\n She\u0027s said that the Emperor had sought immortality. What if she was referring to the Magic Emperor, not the undead one? Perhaps part of the reason for the rapid progress of golem development was for that very purpose. \\n\\n And if that\u0027s true, then it explains the Emperor\u0027s current appearance, the immense magic he sensed from the far-off palace, and the Red Moon, which controls the capital at night. Lee Shin Woo thought and scoffed.\\n\\n \u0027Their goals are completely different, but their means are similar. This is no laughing matter. As expected of brothers...\u0027\\n\\n The Crown Prince had banished the 2nd prince hundreds of years ago, so he\u0027d thought that perhaps the current Magic and Undead Emperors were different, but with what he knew now, he discarded all such thoughts.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was sure that the surface and underground were ruled by the Crown Prince and the 2nd prince respectively. Nothing else would explain their lunacy and obsession. \\n\\n \u0027But if that\u0027s true, then... Does the Emperor not care if the others become undead? Is that why he just left the death energy as is? But what if the undead underground were to invade the surface? It didn\u0027t make sense that he wouldn\u0027t have something prepared. It seemed fine for now, as the undead curse was the only thing surfacing, while the undead themselves seemed to have no intention of invading...\\n\\n But Lee Shin Woo was confused about something. The undead had overcome their greatest obstacle by becoming the undead, so why hadn\u0027t the Undead Emperor ordered his forces to invade the surface yet? What exactly was stopping him?\\n\\n Was it Arema Steelworker? Seagald Von Retadane? Though they were forces independent of the Emperor\u0027s, they only held one of the 12 General positions a piece. On the other hand, the Emperor possessed the Archmage, as well as the remaining 12 Generals, so it made absolutely no sense that he couldn\u0027t come up to the surface because of them.\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s not like I can go and ask the Archmage, \u0027Hey, why aren\u0027t you guys going to the surface?\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n \"Why aren\u0027t you asking anything else? Did you get everything you wanted... If not, then are you thinking about something that she can\u0027t answer?\"\\n\\n At that moment, the Evileye General (who sat in front of him) said something out of the blue. The mood, which Lee Shin Woo had been controlling, had changed.\\n\\n \"...What?\"\\n\\n This time, Lee Shin Woo was surprised. Her body and voice hadn\u0027t changed, yet... the quality of her magic had changed! Moreover, Lee Shin Woo was somewhat familiar with that magic. He narrowed his eyes and voiced his assumption.\\n\\n \"Darkness magic... The Emperor?\"\\n\\n \"If you were that curious about me, then you should\u0027ve come to see me yourself. You see, I hate incompetent individuals like the owner of this body, but I like people overflowing with talent like yourself. Indeed, whenever, wherever.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo raised his head and looked straight at the Evileye General. He sensed darkness mana deep within the recesses of her eyes. It was an unseverable relationship that he must have made beforehand.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had experienced this before; by giving one\u0027s name, an unbreakable link would be formed. And this link was formed between the Evileye General and the Emperor. \\n\\n \"Ha, so the Evileye General was disposable from the very beginning.\"\\n\\n \"She had a chance. But she wasted it. The contract is absolute, but she didn\u0027t realize that. How unfortunate.\"\\n\\n The Magic Emperor spoke brazenly with the Evileye General\u0027s face and voice and shook his head. Lee Shin Woo snorted and simultaneously analyzed his mana. He came to an immediate conclusion. It was an innate element.\\n\\n Darkness and... probably the lightning element. It would be simple to call it the \u0027Dark Lightning\u0027 element, but the dark lightning he felt from the Emperor wasn\u0027t so simple. Lightning\u0027s speed, power, and conductivity... It felt like he\u0027d developed it in a completely different direction. And it was probably what was allowing the Emperor to perform such a feat.\\n\\n \"Do you all get such unique abilities when you reach level 9?\"\\n\\n \"Hoh. You saw through my Lightning Bind with one glance. I suppose that makes sense. Since you managed to kill the divine bird that was on par with me...\"\\n\\n \"Now that we\u0027re at it, let me ask you something. How did you imprison it?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t ask because he was really curious. When he absorbed the Garuda\u0027s bone, he\u0027d know then. But he wanted to ask a good question to buy him some more time. \\n\\n \"Oh, I thought you\u0027d ask me about that.\"\\n\\n Was it because he was sure that he was stronger than him? The Emperor answered happily. Perhaps the Emperor was still underestimating him, he who had defeated the divine bird that had escaped its imprisonment.\\n\\n \"Its innate element responds when it recognizes external stimuli. If that\u0027s the case, then you make it so that it can\u0027t recognize it. If you prevent it from moving, then the next step is simple. You must\u0027ve felt it, but my power, Lighting Bind, is quite powerful in that regard. Since you didn\u0027t even notice that you\u0027d been affected yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t been able to move his body ever since the Emperor had shown up.\\n\\n It would probably be easy to dispel with his innate elements, whether it be his Dark Shadow, Dark Flame, or his Shining Flame, but he was deliberately not doing so. If he did, the Emperor would just restrain him again.\\n\\n This space was already filled with the Emperor\u0027s magic. It might be different if he had been facing another level 8, but it would be difficult for even him to take control of a level 9\u0027s mana.\\n\\n \"Did you spread your mana all over the Empire?\"\\n\\n \"All the materials used to create the capital\u0027s buildings and roads are subject to the palace\u0027s approval. Each of those materials is saturated with mana, mana which I can change into my own whenever I wish. No one managed to figure it out, so don\u0027t be so frustrated, Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay.\"\\n\\n Even Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t see through this elaborate trap. The Wild Card skill had its limitations. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t break through the barrier set up over hundreds of years and see through the Emperor\u0027s mana. \\n\\n Was this a level 9\u0027s power? Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized how wide the world was due to the Emperor\u0027s ability and unfathomable method of controlling the capital. He\u0027d heard from Kratia that a magician\u0027s power would increase several times over within their workshop, but this bastard had turned the entire capital into his workshop...\\n\\n \"Do you have anything else you\u0027d like to ask? As a parting gift, I\u0027ll answer any questions you have.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you ignoring the undead curse? At this rate, the undead curse will spread to the Empire.\"\\n\\n \"Ho. You\u0027re not going to ask if I\u0027m a Vampire or what not?\"\\n\\n \"Since there\u0027s no point.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo declared. He didn\u0027t know how the Emperor took it, but he grinned and replied.\\n\\n \"You must think it\u0027s so urgent, but that curse is still too weak. More people need to die to unite the Empire.\"\\n\\n \"...Hmm.\"\\n\\n Did he not get a report from Arema Steelworker regarding the undead curse? The true power of the curse lies in its ability to kill the world itself, not just living beings!\\n\\n No. The Emperor, with his high rank innate darkness element, should be able to absorb all of the curse\u0027s energy. If that\u0027s the case, then he could understand why he was speaking so peacefully.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. Everything is going according to plan. Humanity has been subject to danger a few times before, but each and every time we work together and overcome said danger. And every time, humanity dwindles in size and then repopulates itself. This is the way the world works. ...However, there\u0027s one problem this time.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s you. I was confident that with our golems, which are spread across the Empire, that we would know about all dangers and preempt them, but... I didn\u0027t know about you, one who possesses enough power to clear a level 8 dungeon by yourself, beforehand. And because of that, my plan has gone a bit awry.\"\\n\\n The Evileye General\u0027s face became wrinkled. It didn\u0027t fit a young woman\u0027s face, but for some reason, he didn\u0027t feel like it was strange. It must\u0027ve been because of the mood.\\n\\n \"I thought long and hard before I came to see you, but I couldn\u0027t understand. I struggled and looked at all the possibilities, but there was only one answer I came to... Though I couldn\u0027t believe it myself.\"\\n\\n Then, the Emperor looked straight at Lee Shin Woo. The words that came next... Lee Shin Woo would probably never forget them.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a hero, but also an undead. God sent you like that, right? To spy on the surface and the underground!\"\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-230","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
