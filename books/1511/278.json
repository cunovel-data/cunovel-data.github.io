Underground\u0027s Sun - 2\u003e Because of the giant artifact that had once lain in Bayran, the Heaven Rending Cannon... No, now the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer, all of the capital\u0027s defenses were destroyed, and all those level 5 or lower were killed by the light blast right then and there. It was the capital, so it was only right that normal level 1 or 2 citizens had resided there, but now, there was absolutely no trace of them. And thus, the capital had received a blessing of light and had become a true city of death. The blast of light had substantially weakened the undead curse as well, and even the Imperial Army, which consisted of level 6s or higher, was weakened. [You unleashed that horror upon us, yet you insist that you\u0027re fighting for the Emperor? Shut your mouth, you traitor. That dirty light of yours will never shine upon the underground ever again!] [I already told you, that wasn\u0027t me...! I wanted to free you from your shackles. I never intended to eliminate everything in the process!] [I told you to shut your mouth!] The Archmage and Emperor were rightfully angry. Even the Undead Emperor, who had been content to quietly build his forces, decided to take this chance to wipe out any forces underground beside his own. And to uphold this order, the Lich was prepared to do everything and anything necessary. As Kratia had said, that blast was the signal for the final battle. The moment the Heaven Defying Flag Bearer was shot, the battle had already started! ...But it had turned out a bit different from her expectations. [Ah, don\u0027t you hear the cries of our dearly departed citizens? That light of yours (which severs all links) is like dust; it\u0027s still in the air! Seagald... Seagalddddd!] [Keuk...!] That\u0027s right. The Emperor had decided to kill Seagald, the one they assumed had shot the light blast at the capital, first, not the heroes who had come here under God\u0027s will, or the forces from the surface, or even the spy, Arema Steelworker! Only Seagald, who had formed his own independent force and specialized in light, even after undeath, had the ability to assault the capital. At least, that\u0027s what the Lich and the Emperor thought. [You fool. You foolish Lich...! Think about it. You know how much us Retadanes loved and treasured the people! There\u0027s no way I\u0027d do something like that!] [You won\u0027t fool me! Even His Majesty is aware that only you are capable of wielding such light! Your sword is blazing with the same light, and you\u0027re shooting at me with the very same light!] The situation was really in his favor. If Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t experienced converting the accumulated darkness within the cannon into light through Dark Shadow himself, then even he wouldn\u0027t be able to believe that he\u0027d performed such a miracle either. Yet, the Lich hadn\u0027t noticed the presence of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Shining Flame, despite taking a direct hit. Therefore, the Lich couldn\u0027t sense Lee Shin Woo\u0027s light element. And thus, all suspicion was pushed onto Seagald, who had come to Bayran for the express purpose of using said cannon! [Keuk, you\u0027ve been deluded for so many years. That\u0027s why I opposed the undead curse... Can you even hear me? Are you even looking at me? Feotane Von Seldin! Where did your intellect go; is it along with that soul of yours!?] [Ha! Seagald, you talk too much, even when your tongue\u0027s rotted away!] The Archmage was no pushover, but Lee Shin Woo (as Arema) was also supporting him right now. He rode his golem horse, which he didn\u0027t have before, and rushed forward. Seagald grit his teeth. This wasn\u0027t the same slow-witted Arema! [Arema, what did you do!? Tell me, what did the Heaven Defying General (who used you like a mere underling) do!? Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s strange that he\u0027s the only one not here? You\u0027re being used as well! It\u0027s not too late, I can still...] [I told you to shut that filthy mouth of yours!] Lee Shin Woo accumulated as much mana as he could at the end of his fist, and used the very same technique Arema had used against Seagald: the Metal God technique! This technique, which suppressed the opponent\u0027s mana, was impossible to block, even with the use of the Annihilation Flame. Moreover, the Lich supported him from behind, using his Spatial Magic at just the right time...! [Keuk!] Seagald was able to protect his last good arm by using a ton of mana, but the cost was great. Though a level 8\u0027s mana reserves were high, they weren\u0027t infinite. He looked at the sky, as if lamenting his situation, and then grit his teeth and yelled. [Feotane... Please get a hold of yourself!] [My head\u0027s just fine!] [You\u0027re still talking, Seagald!?] [Keuk, Aremaaaaaaaaa!] Metal and fire mixed together and melted, and when both of them were gone, Seagald was engulfed in the Archmage\u0027s Spatial Magic. Lee Shin Woo moved away preemptively to allow way for Feotaneâ€™s magic; he then moved back in instantaneously and threw his fist. If it hit, it would definitely inflict some damage. [Critical Hit!] [Kuhahk!] It was as though a sharp drill had pierced through his body and soul, ignoring Seagald\u0027s authorities, and causing severe pain! Was this the power of the metal element? Was this also a part of an innate element? Seagald felt an unfamiliar fear creep up on him, rather than the pain. Of course, it wasn\u0027t Arema\u0027s ability, but the skill Lee Shin Woo received as a reward for destroying a part of the capital with the cannon, the special passive skill, Soul Strike! However, there was no way Seagald would know that. [Hoo, now are you prepared to face me?] [Arema...!] Was this really Arema!? Seagald was astonished as he parried \u0027Arema\u0027s\u0027 metal element reinforced strikes. Before, he was a bit... weaker. He was a show-off; a spy that came from the surface that relied upon his tough body and his status as one of the Four Heavenly Commanders. What\u0027s worse, Arema was much weaker just a few days ago when they had last fought! But then how was he attacking with such agility and precision now!? Seagald then voiced such doubts. [Are you really Arema...?] [Ha. Seems like you\u0027re the one who needs to get a hold of himself, Seagald.] [Anti-Skull. You tried to escape the true blessing of death with such a crude method. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve become like this!] [Grr...!] Normally, the Metal God General and the Archmage had absolutely no affinity, yet they were cooperating so well now, whether it be their condemnation of him or their attacks! He couldn\u0027t get away, due to the never-ending barrage of physical strikes and magical attacks. Even if he dominated the ambient mana and tried to fight back, the combination of the Lich\u0027s Spatial Magic and the metal element\u0027s ability to freeze his mana made it difficult to do so. Was it because they were both level 8? They knew exactly how to fight against him. Even he wouldn\u0027t be able to last against the two Heavenly Commanders\u0027 attacks forever. \"Push them back. Kill all those who seek to spread that filthy curse to the surface!\" \"Kuooooooh!\" \"The sun\u0027s hot...! Light General, please hurry and use the Dark Red Solar Eclipse!\" \"You filthy, lifeless corpses!\" Moreover, there was a level 8 behind him commanding the Vampires and slaughtering Anti-Skull, so Seagald was really feeling the pressure. Now that all their bases had been destroyed, everything would be over once his subordinates died. [...But ultimately...] In the midst of the intense battle, Seagald was barely, just barely able to retreat using his Annihilation Flame. He then looked at the sky and muttered... [We\u0027re just in time.] [Mm...? It doesn\u0027t matter, die!] Lee Shin Woo felt like the air was hotter than before, but decided to not worry about that for now. The issue was that Seagald was in a strange stance. In most cases, when an enemy gets into a special position, it means they\u0027re trying to do something! It didn\u0027t matter what he was trying to do; Lee Shin Woo knew it would be all over if he killed him, so he concentrated all his magic into his fist and struck. [Keuk... This isn\u0027t enough to bring me down!] [Ugh!] However, Seagald let it hit him. In an instant, part of his lower body disappeared. Although he\u0027d lost an arm and a leg, Seagald kept his balance and moved through the air! His spirit truly befitted that of a Heavenly Commander. [Kahahk...!] [If possible, I didn\u0027t want to hurt you, but you\u0027re a Lich, so I suppose it doesn\u0027t matter. Try and understand.] Seagald had taken a direct hit from Lee Shin Woo\u0027s attack but had simultaneously mustered up as much fire as he could and burned the Lich\u0027s body. Even spatial element mana couldn\u0027t erase the Annihilation Flame, and it went exactly as Seagald had wanted, completely burning the Lich. Lee Shin Woo furrowed his brow, as he couldn\u0027t understand what Seagald was doing. But then, Seagald extracted something from the Lich\u0027s stomach. [So it was here.] [Kahahk...! Were you aiming for that from the very beginning...!] [I can\u0027t control it with my power alone. Do you remember, Archmage? When we were still on good terms, we managed it together. The two pieces of the controller will now become one...!] [Kuhahk... What rubbish...!] He didn\u0027t know what this controller was for, but he knew he was trying to do something with it, so Lee Shin Woo stopped him with metal element mana and then attempted to kill him. But then, Seagald disappeared. In the process, he had probably lost another piece of his body, but... He wasn\u0027t dead. [Kuah!] [Ugh!] And thus, the powerful energy Lee Shin Woo had emitted destroyed the Archmage\u0027s body! There was nothing more frustrating than killing one\u0027s ally! \u0027He really is fast!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s why I told you to practice with me, didn\u0027t I!?\u0027 \u0027I thought it would be enough to catch him!\u0027 Lee Shin Woo realized that Seagald had utilized Fire Shadow and immediately used his darkness to try to find and then destroy him. However, he soon opened his eyes wide open. He couldn\u0027t find any traces of him. That wasn\u0027t possible. He couldn\u0027t find him with his mastered darkness element? Even if he\u0027d used his Annihilation Flame to erase his presence, Lee Shin Woo should\u0027ve been able to find him. So if that didn\u0027t work, then either Seagald had finally died, or... [He moved somewhere where there isn\u0027t even a speck of darkness.] Had Seagald mastered the light element? No, there was no way. Lee Shin Woo had done so with the darkness element, but it wasn\u0027t as easy as it sounded. At the very least, Seagald\u0027s light didn\u0027t seem so absolute. [Kuaaaaaahk!] [L-Light General...!] [M-My skin! My eyes!] But then... the Vampires fighting against Anti-Skull began to scream simultaneously! The Light General, having noticed that their skin quickly began to burn, realized one thing and yelled. \"Arema, look up!\" [...No way.] He quickly looked up, and the sight caused him to go off character. But he thought they\u0027d left him off the hook considering the circumstances. The artificial sun, which radiated light all across the Underground Empire, was coming towards them. ...With Seagald Von Retadane smack dab in the middle of it.
