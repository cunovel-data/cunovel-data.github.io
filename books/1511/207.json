New Party Member - 8 [End of Volume 9]\u003e\\n\\n \"How stupid.\"\\n\\n Jin, who\u0027d learned the truth, said and went silent. He probably had so much on his mind that he couldn\u0027t say anything more. Lee Shin Woo also had mixed feelings on the subject, so he didn\u0027t say anything either. Soon, Jin spoke, as if he were muttering.\\n\\n \"If the Emperor\u0027s true goal was turning them into the undead and he succeeded, then... Why are we fighting them? Did even God abandon them?\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s to protect the world. If the undead curse spreads to the surface, then the world is as good as dead.\"\\n\\n Since Lee Shin Woo was undead himself, he didn\u0027t want to label them like this. But strictly speaking, the undead consumed the world\u0027s resources, without creating anything in return.\\n\\n That was their biggest flaw. If all the beings that lived on this world became undead, then the only course the world could take is ruin. It was only natural that God sought to eliminate the Undead Empire\u0027s curse.\\n\\n \"But the Undead Empire\u0027s so pitiful.\"\\n\\n \"The hell are you talking about? Everyone\u0027s trying their hardest to live. What are you going to do, let the underground inhabitants go to the surface? If you do that, then the underground and the surface will go to war. It\u0027s been so long since the underground was isolated from the surface. Even if the underground takes their revenge on the surface, the surface dwellers will be the only ones who\u0027ll suffer.\"\\n\\n \"Then why do you look so unwell? You don\u0027t sympathize with the underground citizens, nor do you hate the surface dwellers, so why...\"\\n\\n \"I feel bad for the heroes.\"\\n\\n \"Huh...?\"\\n\\n As expected, Jin hadn\u0027t gotten that far yet. Jin looked bewildered and Lee Shin Woo explained kindly.\\n\\n \"The heroes don\u0027t know anything and are being manipulated by God. They don\u0027t know what happened to the people underground, why they became undead, or how the surface is faring. That\u0027s pitiful enough, but even if they eliminate the undead curse, all that\u0027s left for them is despair.\"\\n\\n \"Why despair... Ah!\"\\n\\n Jin realized belatedly and was shocked.\\n\\n \"The barrier that prevents the living from passing through... I see! So the heroes can\u0027t leave the Underground Empire either!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. God\u0027s using the heroes to do her dirty work, but once they\u0027ve eliminated the curse, she plans on burying them underground.\"\\n\\n \"How could she... Wait a sec. What if they collect 100 permits; if they get that many, they can see the surface. Wasn\u0027t her intent to let them escape to the surface?\"\\n\\n \"No, absolutely not.\"\\n\\n God\u0027s power seemed absolute, but Lee Shin Woo knew that God, and by extension, Pleine, were just bluffing.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve never thought about why we\u0027re the only ones given the mission of collecting the secret shop permits? Even though there were dozens of heroes (seniors) before us.\"\\n\\n \"Just us... Isn\u0027t it because, other than you, it\u0027s impossible to gather that many permits?\"\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027d be really tough, but it\u0027s not undoable. You can also get quests from God. If God had told our seniors that they could go the surface if they gathered 100 permits, then they probably would have tried.\"\\n\\n However, God had never given them that option. She had only given that option to Lee Shin Woo by surreptitiously saying \u0027save the permits\u0027. Why did she do that? Lee Shin Woo realized why she\u0027d done that early on.\\n\\n \"If the other heroes were to gather 100 permits, it\u0027d be meaningless.\"\\n\\n \"Meaningless... What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"There were several clues. Lee Man Bok hated God, and Pleine showed some signs as well.\"\\n\\n Ah, and now that he thought about it, he\u0027d heard it before he had brought Jin to the secret shop to leave for the surface. Lee Shin Woo remembered that time and kindly told Jin what Pleine had told him.\\n\\n \"She said if it were just me and you, it should be possible, but she also said I\u0027d be the \u0027first and the last\u0027. Why would I be the last? That\u0027s because the other heroes can\u0027t pass through the gate.\"\\n\\n \"Ah...!?\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Pleine had borrowed God\u0027s power to create a gate that led to the surface, and while that gate looked like it could be used by the other heroes, it actually couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n Although she seemed omnipotent, even God couldn\u0027t do anything about the barrier that divided the surface and the underground. So it made sense that Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who \u0027weren\u0027t alive\u0027, could use the gate. Looks can be deceiving. Rem also wasn\u0027t alive, so it could go through without any problems.\\n\\n It made sense that the other heroes hadn\u0027t heard of gathering 100 permits in order to go to the surface before. No matter how many permits they saved, God didn\u0027t have a way of sending them to the surface!\\n\\n \"But the Bone Gate absorbed God\u0027s power and evolved into a level 9 artifact. It blew God\u0027s expectations out of the water and possessed power greater than that of the chaos element barrier. God probably wanted us to do something about the barrier from the surface, but the problem had already been solved. So, there wouldn\u0027t have been any problem if we went straight back underground when we first arrived on the surface.\"\\n\\n \"It sounds really stupid.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It does sound stupid, even while I\u0027m saying it.\"\\n\\n Of course, the fact that Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Heaven Door\u0027s Key could transport Ye Jin Jin to the surface was enough proof.\\n\\n However, that was merely the outcome. The fact that the Heaven Door\u0027s Key had even been born was strictly luck. Its creation hadn\u0027t been God\u0027s intention, but a result of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s karma. It wouldn\u0027t have even been enough if all the heroes traveled around the Underground Empire and went on a \u0027three steps, one bow\u0027 [1] pilgrimage to Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n \"If we put everything together, we find that... God\u0027s a bitch.\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was flustered by Jin\u0027s extreme bluntness and agreed with him. Although it wasn\u0027t his intention, he ended up defending her a little bit.\\n\\n \"But I feel like God wasn\u0027t pleased with her choices either. Whether she decided that things couldn\u0027t go on as they were, or that she pitied the heroes... It doesn\u0027t matter. After all, she turned you and me into the undead.\"\\n\\n \"Did she make it so that we could go to the surface after we\u0027ve completed our mission? Sure. But we\u0027re undead! Moreover, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that the other heroes can\u0027t escape!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, so she didn\u0027t have a clear goal or plan in place. She probably just... hoped? We\u0027re both heroes and also entities that can enter the outside world; she was hoping that we would do something about that barrier.\"\\n\\n \"She should\u0027ve been more clear!\"\\n\\n \"Well, we did deal with it though.\"\\n\\n From the very beginning, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t think God was looking far into the future. As he said, she probably just hoped they\u0027d deal with it; that\u0027s why they were in this situation.\\n\\n And realistically speaking, they had dealt with it. Lee Shin Woo thought \u0027you sure are lucky that it turned out as you wanted\u0027. If he just dealt with the undead curse, then everything would be... Lee Shin Woo knew that that was probably what God was thinking, and it had played exactly as she wanted.\\n\\n \"So she put us into this situation because of some unclear expectations...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not like I don\u0027t sympathize with her at all though. Whatever the rule that\u0027s imposed on her, God definitely can\u0027t directly influence the world. And it\u0027s true that this world is really suffocating.\"\\n\\n \"I still can\u0027t forgive her. I want to beat the crap out of her.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t plan on forgiving that damn woman either.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly, and Jin asked him a question as if he\u0027d just thought of something.\\n\\n \"But you said that living beings couldn\u0027t go to the surface, even with God\u0027s power. Then how did Pleine go to the surface?\"\\n\\n \"You know that Pleine possesses an extraordinary power, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it the same reason that she can\u0027t directly intervene with matters regarding the Underground Empire?\"\\n\\n \"Ah!\"\\n\\n If Pleine were here, then she\u0027d say something along the lines of \u0027stop being a hero, lay down a mat, and watch the store for me.\u0027. Jin immediately agreed with his easy to understand explanation.\\n\\n \"In other words, Pleine is also...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. She\u0027s either a god herself or a being like one. That\u0027s what I think. If I had to call her something, then... I\u0027d call her an angel.\"\\n\\n \"An angel? That really doesn\u0027t fit her.\"\\n\\n Pleine was Seira\u0027s older sister but was also a human at the time of the Empire\u0027s demise. At the time, something had happened that allowed her to keep her appearance. Even so, it was quite laughable. There was one brother and two sisters (Seagald, Seira, and Pleine), yet one of them was an angel, another was a hero, and the last one was an undead.\\n\\n \u0027Pleine must not know what to think. Since her brother and her sister have been reduced to that...\u0027\\n\\n Then, Lee Shin Woo felt really curious. Pleine obviously knew, but did Retadane know the real reason as to why the Emperor had created the undead curse?\\n\\n If he just took into account her desire to eliminate all the undead, then it might seem like she didn\u0027t know, but there was still a chance that she knew, yet she acted like that anyway. If it\u0027s the latter, then he had to recognize how strong willed she was.\\n\\n [Paul Zero, are you ok?]\\n\\n \"Yeah. I feel great since you led me here.\"\\n\\n [Mm. I actually have a lot on my mind...]\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll protect you no matter what.\"\\n\\n [...Yeah. I trust you, Paul Zero!]\\n\\n Now that he thought about it, there was another puzzle he\u0027d solved. There was an order that every golem in the Magic Empire’s golem network shared that was to be their top priority: \u0027spirits - search and destroy\u0027. Of course, once he\u0027d discovered it, he discreetly canceled that order.\\n\\n When he\u0027d first discovered the order, Lee Shin Woo wondered why the Empire was going out of its way to look for and eliminate spirits. But it made sense if the Magic Empire always hated the spirits.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t enough that they slaughtered and chased out the spirits, they were still actively trying to find and eliminate spirits. He was speechless. Perhaps that was why the golems were so spread out across the Magic Empire... Wait a sec.\\n\\n \"Wait... Golems?\"\\n\\n \"Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n At that moment, a light bulb went off in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s head. It was just a hypothesis, but when he combined everything he\u0027d experienced and the memories he\u0027d acquired from the golems, then everything made sense.\\n\\n \"The living can\u0027t go through the barrier.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, so what?\"\\n\\n \"...But the golems can go through. Since they\u0027re not living.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s why Pleine said it was ok when you asked if you could bring Rem along.\"\\n\\n The magic engineering involved in controlling golems was advanced on the surface. It was probably much greater than that of the Underground Empire\u0027s. \\n\\n And one day, one of the Underground Empire\u0027s 12 generals, Arema Steelworker, appeared out of nowhere, and greatly advanced their golem manufacturing technique.\\n\\n \"Arema Steelworker... He didn\u0027t betray the Emperor.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you suddenly talking about him? Wait a sec, a golem?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Arema Steelworker\u0027s a golem. He was probably a golem the moment he showed up in the Underground Empire. He coaxed the (Undead) Emperor, who wanted to leave, to help him develop golems, but he actually took full control over the golems...\"\\n\\n All the information he\u0027d acquired on Arema Steelworker fell into place. Everything he\u0027d done in the past, which he couldn\u0027t understand before, made sense when he took into account the circumstances on the surface.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a spy that came from the surface. Perhaps he was sent to watch over, or even kill the (Undead) Emperor... He didn\u0027t betray the Emperor, he was always his enemy.\"\\n\\n He voluntarily placed his soul into a golem and entered the Underground Empire. Why? So that he could leave when he\u0027d completed his mission! And he fooled the Emperor, who was studying golems so that he could pass through the barrier, and increased the size of his forces. Did he not get good results from his research into placing souls into golems? It\u0027s not that he couldn\u0027t, it\u0027s that he didn\u0027t!\\n\\n And even now, he received orders from the surface and was staying underground. Arema Steelworker’s true purpose wasn\u0027t to live quietly or to annihilate the undead. He was watching the Undead Emperor, and making sure that they couldn\u0027t leave the underground.\\n\\n \"Wait a sec. Then... This might get interesting.\"\\n\\n \"Uwah, Shin Woo, your expression\u0027s turned really evil... Turn back into an expressionless skeleton. Hey, turn back.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo completely ignored Jin, summoned Rem, and gave him an order.\\n\\n Five minutes later, Lee Shin Woo got his answer, and thought \u0027I won\u0027.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] E/N: An example of a 3 step 1 bow ceremony.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-207","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
