Heaven Defying General - 5\u003e\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth at the frustration welling up within him.\\n\\n \"That bastard, did he lie to me...?\"\\n\\n \"They might\u0027ve gotten two calls for help at the same time, so they might be confused.\"\\n\\n Kratia said persuasively. Lee Shin Woo accepted it, nodded his head, and said.\\n\\n \"...Yeah, they\u0027ll probably be here soon. Let\u0027s just get everything that\u0027s hidden here.\"\\n\\n \"Over here, Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n They were in the midst of looking for any hidden artifacts or Perium within the castle while using Rem as covertly as possible to keep watch.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all been useless stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but it was still a strong reaction. Ah, this is it.\"\\n\\n They found a discretely hidden storage house within the castle. Upon analyzing and opening it, they found a huge quantity of Perium inside. To be exact, it contained 25 million Perium. It was a significant sum of money, but Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t excited in the least from such a \u0027small\u0027 sum. He asked her if she wanted him to split it into three parts and give her 8.4 million, but Kratia just shook her head.\\n\\n \"Kratia, are you studying Perium?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t started on that yet. Moreover, Perium didn\u0027t exist in my original world.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n Apparently, levels and skills existed in Kratia\u0027s original world surprisingly. If that\u0027s the case, then did that mean that this world was more developed than her own world? If not, then was the reverse true? Kratia replied simply to the inquisitive Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n \"Surplus, incalculable karma comes in the form of Perium. In other words, you would receive karma in a different form in a different world. It\u0027s not better or worse than any other worlds\u0027 karma.\"\\n\\n \"Surplus karma, huh...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo stored the Perium and muttered. Surplus karma. It was through this surplus karma that Shino Rendu gained new equipment. In other words, Perium responded to Shino Rendu\u0027s new karma and had the ability to change. If Lee Shin Woo was able to control the direction it changes in, then...\\n\\n [Master.]\\n\\n While Lee Shin Woo was thinking about how he would approach Perium, Rem reported to him. It was information regarding the long-awaited enemy forces.\\n\\n [I see a giant flying monster from afar. It\u0027s moving incredibly fast and there was an undead riding on top of it.]\\n\\n \"Oooooh!\"\\n\\n A Monster Rider had appeared! Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t seen any monster riders, aside from some goblins riding atop wolves, so there was no way he wouldn\u0027t be excited at the news.\\n\\n \"Jin!\"\\n\\n \"No matter how hopeful you sound, I\u0027m not going to sprout wings.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t make them? After all, you made springs out of steel.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t!\"\\n\\n Well, even if he could make wings out of steel, Jin wouldn\u0027t be able to fly in the sky. After all, Steel Wing was an attack move in Pokemon.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve given me pretty much all of the flying monster bones thus far, yet nothing has happened. Give it up already.\"\\n\\n \"Tch... Rem, how\u0027s it going over there?\"\\n\\n [It\u0027s strange. There\u0027s only one coming over here. It seems like a scout. What would you like me to do?]\\n\\n It was easy to forget, but Rem was a level 6 elite. Although it was focused on support skills that relied on stealth, Lee Shin Woo had reinforced it with thousands of bones, so it now possessed combat abilities befitting its level. Taking down a scout wouldn\u0027t be an issue for Rem.\\n\\n \"A scout... Alright, take it down.\"\\n\\n [Understood.]\\n\\n Nothing good would come of their opponent getting info on them before they even fought. Lee Shin Woo ordered Rem to take it down, following which Rem charged forward, piercing through the monster\u0027s body while maintaining its stealth.\\n\\n [Kuhahk!?]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo watched as the flying monster\u0027s corpse, as well as the undead riding atop it, fell from the sky and shot one of his floating swords at it. He\u0027d hit the mark, of course.\\n\\n \"What will they do now? Will they send more scouts, or will they just attack us right away? How exciting.\"\\n\\n They probably didn\u0027t know that Lee Shin Woo had already been aware of their scout and that he\u0027d intercepted it. Lee Shin Woo imagined the Vulture General\u0027s flustered expression and grinned, and then leisurely collected the flying monster and the scout\u0027s corpses.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to give me that bone, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"You never know. Take it. Think of it as taking a tonic.\"\\n\\n \"I told you, I\u0027m not going to sprout wings...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo gave Jin both the flying monster\u0027s bone, as well as the scout\u0027s bone. He was acting like a test-taker who sent in his application to Seoul University, despite knowing that he wouldn\u0027t get in. [1]\\n\\n However.\\n\\n \"Huh...?\"\\n\\n \"What is it? Are your shoulder joints feeling itchy?\"\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s not it.\"\\n\\n Jin said and looked embarrassed. Lee Shin Woo looked on in anticipation, as though he was absolutely sure that it had worked this time, but unfortunately, it hadn\u0027t worked out this time either.\\n\\n \"Stop deluding yourself and just focus on the coming battle, you dumbass.\"\\n\\n \"Damn it, I guess it didn\u0027t work this time either...\"\\n\\n 30 minutes passed. Lee Shin Woo stationed the Giants in front of the catapults, and the level 7 elite, Ellata, was prepared to shoot herself into the air with her ability to manipulate the earth.\\n\\n [Arogan, you\u0027re ready, right?]\\n\\n [Of course I am... They\u0027re really making us wait...]\\n\\n They\u0027d even formed a plan that involved shooting Arogan into the air. Once he was there, he would taunt the enemy forces, acting like a magnet to pull a large number of them down to the ground.\\n\\n [Master, they\u0027ve arrived.]\\n\\n [We\u0027ve come as you\u0027ve commanded, Sir Paul Zero!]\\n\\n The Pauls arrived after completing their mission. Lee Shin Woo ordered them to prepare for aerial warfare as well. If need be, Lee Shin Woo would Instigate their flying mounts to control them.\\n\\n \u0027The Vulture General, huh. Is he going to be level 7 or level 8? If he\u0027s level 7, then there\u0027s nothing to be afraid of. But if he\u0027s level 8, then we\u0027ll probably struggle a bit... Even so, it doesn\u0027t feel like we\u0027ll lose. Even if the unexpected happens, we should win with our current forces.\u0027\\n\\n Of course, he wasn\u0027t reckless and prepared everything that he could for the coming battle. The seven fully charged Breath of the Lightning Gods sparked, as though waiting for the moment that Lee Shin Woo would shoot them out.\\n\\n \"Ugh, my Lightning Resistance is going up again.\"\\n\\n \"But seriously, when are they going to be here?\"\\n\\n Despite their scout being dead for close to an hour now, he didn\u0027t see anyone in the sky. There was no way that the scout was so far from the main force that it would take them an hour to get there, and it would make sense if there was another scout or a follow-up squad sent in after, yet the sky was empty.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re not traveling underground while acting as though they\u0027re coming from the air, are they?\"\\n\\n \"I looked just in case, but I don\u0027t see any signs of that.\"\\n\\n Kratia looked perplexed and tilted her head. At that moment, their second scout appeared. They knew that their previous scout had been taken out, yet they sent one that looked similar and was also similarly leveled!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was speechless and ordered Rem to intercept the scout.\\n\\n \"The hell are they doing? Are they looking down on... Huh?\"\\n\\n [Keeeeehk!]\\n\\n But the moment the scout helplessly fell from the sky, Lee Shin Woo realized that he\u0027d made a mistake. The scout knew it was going to die, yet it held a crystal ball close to its chest.\\n\\n \"Heup!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo thought it was some sort of communication line, so he immediately shot out one his swords and destroyed it. The moment it shattered, he belatedly wondered whether it was some sort of explosive item and regretted it, but fortunately, it wasn\u0027t. While it wasn\u0027t a communication line like he\u0027d first thought it was, Kratia knew what it was upon collecting a piece of the crystal ball.\\n\\n \"This is... a visual transmitter.\"\\n\\n It was a term he was unfamiliar with, but the moment he heard it, he recalled something.\\n\\n \"Does it transmit an image of what is observed?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s way more expensive than a communication line, and because it\u0027s a one-way street, it\u0027s not used very often. However, when it\u0027s difficult to relay something in words, there\u0027s nothing better than an image, so there\u0027s still a demand for it. Honestly, I didn\u0027t think a scout would carry around such a precious item...\"\\n\\n \"And by sacrificing that transmitter, the enemy knows the condition of our troops...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly. As expected, it was indeed a different world from the one he knew. He thought he\u0027d gotten used to it here, but he hadn\u0027t expected this surveillance method to have existed.\\n\\n Of course, they had intercepted the scouts from afar, but they must\u0027ve seen his army and relayed it back to them, so the scouts had indeed fulfilled their duty. He should\u0027ve destroyed the transmitter or whatever right when he saw it, but he was being punished for being so laidback when he saw that there was only one scout.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a jammer that blocks this type of artifact, but only countriesâ€™ governments use them. The fact that they\u0027re able to use image transmitters means that... there might be a jammer in the capital.\"\\n\\n \"Then does that mean we can\u0027t use Huginn\u0027s Eye?\"\\n\\n \"Huginn\u0027s Eye is a level 8 artifact, so most jammers won\u0027t be able to stop it. Especially if we limit its range and increase its output. Then, there shouldn\u0027t be any way for them to block it.\"\\n\\n Good. Then, they got him good this time, but he would pay them back by using Huginn\u0027s Eye later. Lee Shin Woo thought he would need to learn more about the types of magical devices from Kratia and turned around.\\n\\n They were finished scouting, so they would come at him in some way or another. Now was not the time to be angry; now he should be encouraging his troops and perfecting his preparation for the coming conflict.\\n\\n \"...But why aren\u0027t they coming?\"\\n\\n Three more hours passed. Lee Shin Woo wondered whether he was wasting his time. They flew in the air, so why the hell were they so slow? Were they getting a feel for him right now? Were they waiting for his troops to be exhausted from their preparation?\\n\\n \"They should already know that our forces are comprised of the undead, so they should already know about their endurance. ...And there\u0027s no way they know I\u0027m a hero.\"\\n\\n Although Kratia was the only human here, she was not only covered in robes, but she was also hiding her energy well. As she was buried in the undead, it would be difficult for them to determine that she was a human just by seeing an image of her. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t comprehend what they were doing and tilted his head.\\n\\n \"What should we do? Should we just keep waiting?\"\\n\\n \"...No, they\u0027re not going to show up, even if we keep waiting. They\u0027re either waiting for us to slack off, or they want to move somewhere else. Either way, just staying here won\u0027t accomplish anything. ...Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n \"Go where?\"\\n\\n \"Here.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo opened his minimap and pointed to a single point in a level 3 danger zone. It wasn\u0027t very far from here, and of course, it was situated in the Intermediate City, so heroes wouldn\u0027t be there. At the same time...\\n\\n \"If they don\u0027t move, then we\u0027ll just have to go around breaking stuff. We\u0027ll go from here, all the way to here... We\u0027ve already conquered two cities, so let\u0027s make it our primary goal to conquer five total. If we do that and they still don\u0027t show up, then they must not have come to fight us.\"\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, this...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n The five dots that Lee Shin Woo had marked on his minimap (of those five, two of them had already been conquered) were connected, and he solemnly declared.\\n\\n \"In order to draw them in, we\u0027ll conquer five cities in the shape of a cute star.\"\\n\\n But was Lee Shin Woo expecting too much?\\n\\n They had gone around and destroyed the three cities without even concealing their presence (With an army this size, even if he tried, he wouldn\u0027t be able to conceal them. Even if they were unlucky enough to encounter a hero, he hoped that they wouldn\u0027t attack, so long as they didn\u0027t look back at them). Then, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Commander of Terror title evolved into Commander of Fear (the abilities of all the subordinates under his command would increase by 15%), and after purifying the cities, he gained permits to God\u0027s secret shop, stat bonuses, and more money. However...\\n\\n \"Why the hell aren\u0027t they coming yet!?\"\\n\\n \"Wow, it really is in the shape of a cute star!\"\\n\\n \"Kratia... No, never mind.\"\\n\\n In the end, he never clashed with the Vulture General\u0027s forces.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Seoul University is considered one of the best universities in South Korea.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-173","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
