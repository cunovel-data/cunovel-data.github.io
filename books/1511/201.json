New Party Member - 2\u003e\n Ye Jin Jin was already aware of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s ability to disguise himself as a human being. He\u0027d explained it to her after fooling Prince. That\u0027s why he expected her not to raise a commotion at him appearing as a human. At least, that\u0027s what he thought, but...\n \"You look exactly as I imagined, Mr. Shin Woo! You look so cool!\"\n \"You can imagine what I\u0027d looked like with just my build?\"\n \"Yes!\"\n \"Ah, is that so...\"\n Ye Jin Jin declared without even a shred of uncertainty, which caused Lee Shin Woo to go from speechlessness to admiration! Even now, she was carefully touching his forearm, cheek or hair, acting as excited and loud as other girls her age.\n Although it\u0027d be easier for him if she followed him unconditionally, it would be a pain in the ass if she clung onto him too much. He tried to cool things down by returning to his original skeleton form, but...\n \"Kyaa, this form is cool in its own way! So when you become level 7, the atmosphere... Uuaah.\"\n \"Fine. I give up.\"\n On the contrary, she blushed and looked muddled. That\u0027s right, this girl was a necrophiliac! At that moment, Lee Shin Woo changed her danger level to 2. 1 was obviously reserved for Seira Von Retadane.\n \u0027Is it because I left her alone all this time? She\u0027ll likely cool off after traveling with me.\u0027\n After all, their first meeting was both dramatic and fleeting. She was the type to fixate on her first impressions and even improve upon them, so if, conversely, he acted together with her, then her once strong impression of him will disappear. He concluded that, at the very least, it would weaken.\n \"But Mr. Shin Woo, could I really be of help to you? I worked really hard, but I wasn\u0027t able to reach level 6... I\u0027m still really weak.\"\n \"No, that\u0027s fine. You worked really hard.\"\n Her current stats were slightly less than 3,100. Since level 6 required 3,200 total stats, she only needed about 100 or so stats to level up.\n Honestly speaking, Lee Shin Woo was shocked at how fast she\u0027d grown. He and Jin possessed a specialized ability that allowed them to progress quickly, but Ye Jin Jin had nothing of the sort!\n \"I wanted to help you...! So I did whatever I could and worked hard!\"\n \"G-Good for you.\"\n So this was the power of love, huh. He looked at Ye Jin Jin, who grasped her hands in front of her and almost lost his nerve.\n She was the type who ignored everything around her. She wasn\u0027t two-faced; she was honest and wore her heart on her sleeve. To think she\u0027d worked so hard and grown so much just to be of help to him. If someone told him that she came out of a romance cartoon, then he\u0027d believe it. Her face was pretty too, so had her partner not been a skeleton, it would\u0027ve been perfect.\n \u0027Even Lloyd, who\u0027s pretty much the full package, has some darkness within him...\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo might\u0027ve turned out differently had there been a young lady like Ye Jin Jin around in the past. Of course, it was nothing more than speculation, so it was pointless to think about. Plus, he liked how he turned out, so it didn\u0027t matter.\n \"The job I have for you doesn\u0027t really require strength. But it does require trust. It has to be someone who trusts me, and someone I can trust. You have to keep this a secret, too.\"\n \"I can do that!\"\n \"I know. That\u0027s why I called you.\"\n First off, Lee Shin Woo briefly explained the current situation he was in. She was surprised at the fact that Lee Shin Woo could go to the surface, as well as the fact that he could bring her with him.\n \"It\u0027d be nice... if I could go too...\"\n \"You should be able to. The issue\u0027s not about getting there. It\u0027s about what you do after you get there.\"\n He explained what the peddler, Lawrence, and the mercenary, Kay did in detail. She looked really happy to be Lawrence\u0027s representative, but she was even happier at the fact that Kay was called the Sun God\u0027s hero on the surface.\n \"It seems like the Sun God religion has a discerning eye!\"\n \"So I\u0027ll be really busy for the time being. During that time, I\u0027d like you to be Lawrence\u0027s representative. Of course, I\u0027ll pay you a corresponding amount of Perium... no, I\u0027ll pay you even more.\"\n \"Perium...?\"\n \"Yeah. There\u0027s a price for everything. The more burdensome it is, the more you have to pay in exchange.\"\n In exchange for her being Lawrence\u0027s representative, he would pay her Perium. He\u0027d planned this ever since he first considered Ye Jin Jin a candidate.\n He wasn\u0027t really comfortable giving away karma, but Lee Shin Woo had realized that he\u0027d be freer this way!\n \"I shouldn\u0027t be the one saying this, but with the hero, Kay and the Sun God religion\u0027s help, the value of the Lawrence shop will increase instantaneously. And if you\u0027re the representative of such a large business, then that Perium can go to you. In other words, it\u0027s a legal way of gaining Perium.\"\n This was what \u0027killing two birds with one stone\u0027 meant. Ye Jin Jin would become the representative of his business and simultaneously, become stronger.\n Not only would he be repaying her for all her hard work, but she\u0027d also be able to use that Perium to buy more stat boosting medicine. She was definitely one of his allies, so increasing her strength would help Lee Shin Woo as well.\n Even to him, his plan was perfect. However, Ye Jin Jin seemed to oppose his decision.\n \"I can\u0027t do that! I want to help you, not steal your karma...!\"\n \"I\u0027ll be honest with you.\"\n He knew from the very beginning that she wouldn\u0027t be comfortable with this proposal, due to her inherent honest and genuine nature. Lee Shin Woo snorted as if he were waiting for her to try to continue and replied.\n \"Giving you some Perium won\u0027t hurt me in the least. I have more than 2.5 billion Perium on me right now.\"\n \"2.5... billion...\"\n Ye Jin Jin\u0027s face stiffened. The medicine cost 500,000 a pop. With 2.5 billion Perium, she could reach level 7 (3,200 stats needed), purely through the medicine, and still have 900 million Perium left over. Ye Jin Jin was well aware of how great a matter this was.\n \"This is beyond amazing... Mr. Shin Woo, you\u0027re really...\"\n \"This is all the money I\u0027ve accumulated from the Underground Empire. If my business takes off on the surface, then I can make even more. So, you understand now that it won\u0027t make a dent on my Perium, right?\"\n \"...Yes, I understand.\"\n Lee Shin Woo spoke confidently so Ye Jin Jin felt less burdened. Instead, she thought something like, \u0027He\u0027s progressed so quickly, yet he\u0027s amassed so much Perium. Lee Shin Woo truly is amazing!\u0027. He supposed it couldn\u0027t be helped that her impression of him had become even greater than before.\n \"I\u0027ll accept the Perium from you, use it to increase my abilities, and then fight together with you on the frontlines. That\u0027s ok with you, right?\"\n \"Good, you understand. I want you to be Lawrence\u0027s representative, and by doing so, you will gain a lot of Perium you can use to strengthen yourself. So now we\u0027re in agreement, right?\"\n \"Yes, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll become strong enough to help you, no matter what!\"\n She was so blind that Lee Shin Woo felt anxious. But in any case, she would follow him and take this opportunity to become stronger, so she would definitely be helpful to him. He accepted that reasoning and nodded his head.\n \"Alright. We\u0027re done talking, so let\u0027s get a move on. First, we\u0027ll go visit the place where we make Lawrence\u0027s most popular item.\"\n \"Most popular item... Is it the wine that\u0027s being auctioned off? Did you make that yourself? Is it being made underground by any chance?\"\n \"Yeah. Ah, by the way, my name\u0027s Paul Zero over there. Keep that in mind.\"\n Ye Jin Jin looked puzzled while Lee Shin Woo smiled softly and led her. Fortunately, the Kerr Century Winery wasn\u0027t very far from here, so he didn\u0027t need to use the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. Before he went into the winery, he took a deep breath and opened the door. What he was really afraid of was...\n [It\u0027s Paul Zero!]\n [Did you say Paul Zero!?]\n \"Kyaaaaa!?\"\n Once they noticed his arrival, the Dryads rushed over to him like a swarm of bees! He accepted it, as though he knew this would happen, but Ye Jin Jin saw the countless wood spirits rushing over to him and stood still.\n [Paul Zero, you came to visit!]\n \"S-Spirits... Dryads!?\"\n \"Yeah. These guys are invaluable in making the Kerr Century Wine.\"\n Lee Shin Woo completely ignored Sinea, who threw herself into his arms and gave kiss after kiss on his cheek and explained the facility to Ye Jin Jin.\n The mystery behind this facility wasn\u0027t just the Dryads. Ye Jin Jin saw the golems dragging carts filled with grapes or rolling around oak barrels and was speechless.\n \"It really is amazing...\"\n [Paul Zero, is this one of your new friends?]\n \"Yeah. She\u0027ll help sell the wine you guys make from now on.\"\n [I see. Would you like to eat a grape?]\n \"T-Thank you.\"\n [Hehe.]\n Once she ate the grape, Ye Jin Jin became mute once again from the grape\u0027s indescribable sweetness and sourness. It was cute seeing Sinea laugh with such a proud expression.\n Lee Shin Woo left her alone and continued with his work. He collected the wine they\u0027d created, and remodeled the equipment on the spot, creating a new facility to create wine. A facility that would create sparkling wine, the wine that would represent champagne!\n \"For some reason, sparkling wine doesn\u0027t exist in this world... Even if it did, they wouldn\u0027t be able to reproduce its special characteristic and it wouldn\u0027t taste very good. However, our grapes can do it.\"\n [I don\u0027t know what sparkling wine is, but we just have to do as you say, right, Paul Zero?]\n He\u0027d done enough prep on the surface, so remodeling the facility wasn\u0027t very difficult. While he was at it, Lee Shin Woo decided to expand the facility, as well as the wine storehouse. The Dryads were elated at the expanded winery and flew around.\n \"Now, then. There\u0027s something important I have to tell you.\"\n [What is it?]\n [What is it? What is it?]\n He said once he was completely finished with the modifications, and the Dryads responded instantly. Lee Shin Woo honestly told them what had happened. That he\u0027d procured a way to go to the surface, and that he could bring about two of them with him.\n [I see. Paul Zero, you\u0027re really amazing!]\n [I knew you\u0027d be able to go to the surface someday, Paul Zero!]\n They were the Dryads, who came to the underground in search of living trees, so he had expected more of a fuss, but... their reaction wasn\u0027t as bad as he\u0027d expected. He tilted his head, as they may have not understood him, but Sinea then replied.\n [We\u0027re satisfied with our life here. Plus, you\u0027re the one who told us that the curse is threatening to affect the surface as well.]\n \"That\u0027s true, but it\u0027s just a chance. Moreover, isn\u0027t the surface much more attractive than living down here?\"\n [But we like the underground better since you\u0027re here.]\n [You can suck the curse away!]\n [Plus, we don\u0027t want to leave a place that\u0027s been handled by an elf.]\n Lee Shin Woo listened, as the Dryads chattered away, and realized that he\u0027d been misunderstanding all along. It was like with Ye Jin Jin as well. They were more considerate to him than he\u0027d expected, and they were showing this consideration now.\n \"I see... Thanks.\"\n [But there might still be some of our kin or other spirits on the surface, so we may have to investigate... Alright, I\u0027ll go as our representative. Paul Zero, please take care of me.]\n [The Princess is monopolizing Paul Zero!]\n [I\u0027m against this!]\n [Everyone, please be quiet.]\n She overpowered their resentment with her charisma, flew over to the vineyard, and came over with a small grapevine branch. Lee Shin Woo was confused and asked why she\u0027d brought that over, and Sinea explained that she could return freely with that single branch.\n [I\u0027ve grown a lot too and above all, I love this place. The other Dryads will think the same.]\n \"You\u0027re not a normal Dryad anymore...\"\n [You\u0027re right. I became a level 7 Elder Dryad Princess quite a while ago.]\n At some point, she\u0027d reached level 7 as well! Ye Jin Jin, who realized that a Dryad had even beaten her in terms of levels, felt gloomy, and Lee Shin Woo had to comfort her. Around that time, the final member that they would bring to the surface had arrived.\n [The Master of Darkness, Paul Zero. I have come at your command.]\n He was the level 7 Wolf Avenger, Bisher Moon. When he\u0027d come down to the Underground Empire, he\u0027d told Bisher to come to the winery.\n Lee Shin Woo had to decide which to bring with him: Shino Rendu or Bisher Moon, as he couldn\u0027t bring the Giants or the Chimeras; their outward appearances were too frightening. He thought about it for a while and eventually decided to bring Bisher Moon, as he could use magic, while Shino Rendu only possessed combat abilities.\n [I divided my troops and entrusted them to Shino Rendu and Chi Paul. They\u0027re all fighting bravely right now. Most of the 12 generals won\u0027t even be able to scratch your forces.]\n \"Good.\"\n That\u0027s right. The Empire wasn\u0027t stable yet, but they couldn\u0027t just remain in hiding forever, so Lee Shin Woo was carefully commanding his undead forces from the shadows.\n He decided not to use the Giants unless they were needed, as they were quite conspicuous. His elite undead and golems moved covertly and cut down the Undead Empire\u0027s numbers bit by bit. If one of the 12 generals appeared, then Lee Shin Woo could just go over there. That\u0027s why he\u0027d been grateful to have the Heaven Door\u0027s Key!\n \"Mr. Shin Woo, this Lycanthrope...\"\n \"Remember what he looks like since he\u0027s your senior. Since we\u0027re all here, let\u0027s go.\"\n He was really worried how effective his forces would be without the Heaven Defying General, but Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t always stick around with his troops. After he sent a brief message to Shino Rendu and the other commanders, Lee Shin Woo created a gate to the surface.\n The biggest auction on the surface awaited him.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-201","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
