New Element - 1\u003e [The Bursting Thunder skill has become Lv10 and has evolved to the high rank level! Strength and Magic have increased by 30. The powerful lightning can now draw upon the energy of the heavens.] [The Intermediate Combat Sense skill has become Lv9. Agility has increased by 10. You will have a foggy idea of what your opponent will do next.] [You have learned the active skill, Lv1 Lightning Shadow.] He\u0027d not only learned how to further progress as a warrior who used lightning, but also gained a new skill he could potentially fuse, and had an experience that was especially profitable; yet, Lee Shin Woo stared blankly, as though he had left his soul behind. Jin and Kratia quietly examined Lee Shin Woo. \"What could\u0027ve happened for him to be like that?\" \"I wonder. Maybe he got a lot less stats than he\u0027d expected from the bone?\" However, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t hear the two\u0027s voices. He couldn\u0027t forget the last thing Seagald had said. \u0027Retadane... He definitely said Retadane.\u0027 There was no way he\u0027d heard wrong. Moreover, the memory of the experience was still fresh, and he could playback the memory if he wanted. He was sure. Seagald had said \u0027Retadane\u0027. \u0027Wait... Now that I think about it, Retadane would react whenever I talked about Seagald.\u0027 At the time, Lee Shin Woo had responded to her as naturally as possible, but he inwardly thought it was strange. Because Retadane didn\u0027t really react when the other 12 generals were mentioned. Thus, he had hypothesized that Retadane had already met Seagald once before... \u0027If that\u0027s the case, then is she his descendent...? She\u0027s probably not his daughter, so maybe his granddaughter?\u0027 When he\u0027d come to the Underground Empire, he had definitely heard God say this in passing. Before she had summoned heroes from other worlds, she had turned her world\u0027s people into heroes. They all \u0027failed\u0027, but she didn\u0027t say that they had all \u0027died\u0027. But to think a citizen of the Empire would be included... Not only that, but a citizen of the Empire who wasn\u0027t affected by the curse. \u0027It\u0027s not impossible, right? She might\u0027ve been born in a dungeon.\u0027 So long as she operated as a hero, there would be no problem for him, regardless of whether Seira Von Retadane was a citizen of the Empire, lived above ground, or just lived in this world. He was a bit curious if the other heroes knew about this, but... anyone would be able to figure out the truth if they knew Seagald\u0027s family name, and it wasn\u0027t even really a huge secret either. \u0027If I get the chance, I\u0027ll ask Pleine.\u0027 But Lee Shin Woo realized that he didn\u0027t really need to go out of his way to ask Pleine. By defeating the Lightning Shadow General, he\u0027d gained 10 permits to God\u0027s secret shop! Defeating a general greatly contributed to God\u0027s goal of purifying the Empire, so it seemed as though God gave those contributing heroes the chance to meet her as a reward. If that\u0027s the case, then asking God would give him the most clear answer! \"Alright. \u0027Strike the iron while it\u0027s hot.\u0027\" \"What? There\u0027s still more we have to do?\" \"Nope. We\u0027re finished. It\u0027s been a while, so let\u0027s go meet God. Why don\u0027t you come too, Kratia?\" Jin looked uneasy, while Kratia briefly looked like she had no idea what was going on. She ruminated over the message right away, and nodded her head. \"Now that I think about it, I remember you (Shin Woo) talking about that.\" \"You don\u0027t need to be afraid. All you need to do is badger her for a ability or an item.\" \"Alright. ...I\u0027ve changed my mind a little.\" Kratia still didn\u0027t like the idea of God affecting her abilities, but the conversation changed if God could give her a new artifact. Kratia, who wanted a new ability for her artifact, nodded her head at his words, and ultimately, entered God\u0027s garden. \"Then, shall we go too?\" \"Do we really have to?\" \"You never know, we might get better abilities. Plus, I have something personal I want to ask God. But if you really don\u0027t want to go...\" \"...No, I\u0027ll go.\" Jin sighed quietly, nodded as if he had resolved himself, and stood beside him. Lee Shin Woo had no idea what he had been thinking about, but thought it wasn\u0027t strange that Jin had his own problems to think about, and used the permit to God\u0027s garden. [The party is entering God\u0027s garden through the use of the permit.] When he softly closed his eyes and reopened them, he was transported to a beautiful garden that he\u0027d been to once before. Perhaps because he completely accepted himself last time, he didn\u0027t appear as a human, but as a level 6 Powered Elemental Bone Joker. Of course, Jin wasn\u0027t anywhere nearby... [Good job!] \"Ugh.\" He felt someone touch him. Lee Shin Woo felt an aggressively warm and soft feeling spread over his body and the sweet aroma made it so he momentarily couldn\u0027t get a hold of himself, but was soon able to calm down through Invisible Heart. The situation was quite clear. God was hugging him! To think she could agitate him, an undead; she wasn\u0027t a God for nothing. One who goes beyond the norm; an individual who goes against logic... Lee Shin Woo was unnerved by that aggressive charm. \"Please get off me.\" [To think you\u0027d beat one of the 12 generals! It\u0027s been so long since that\u0027s happened!] \"I said get off me.\" God was still excited and didn\u0027t let go, but soon, Lee Shin Woo forcefully pushed her away. She laughed, patted his back, and stepped back. [Try to understand. I like to express my happiness as well.] \"...It\u0027s a relief that you feel so happy.\" To be honest, Lee Shin Woo had questioned God\u0027s intent of wanting to purify the Empire before, but seeing her current attitude, he realized that her intent wasn\u0027t a lie after all. He really couldn\u0027t figure her out. Maybe she was just psychotic. [You probably can\u0027t understand me, huh?] \"Yes.\" Lee Shin Woo replied honestly. God smiled bitterly, pulled over a chair from a nearby table, and sat down. Then, like last time, she propped her chin on her hands, and spoke calmly. [I just... you know, don\u0027t you feel happy when you get a goal despite it being a lost game? You might\u0027ve gotten around twenty goals repeatedly.] \"That\u0027s really not something a goddess should say in front of a hero.\" [Be happy. I\u0027m only talking about this because it\u0027s you. Since it seems like you\u0027ve already realized quite a few things on your own.] God was weird. And Lee Shin Woo, who was similarly weird, was forced into becoming her comrade through her previous comment. He\u0027d thought it may not be true, but this Empire, no this world had no hope! \"Nice of you to bring me to this despair ridden world.\" [That\u0027s what I thought at first, but now I think you may become this world\u0027s new hope. Ethan is already beginning to dawdle, but if it\u0027s you...] \"Please don\u0027t forcefully put all your hopes on me. I\u0027m just doing as I please.\" [So about the reward...] God, who\u0027d completely ignored Lee Shin Woo, gently gazed at Lee Shin Woo and said. [You\u0027re not planning on getting another quest again, are you?] \"Is there even anything else I can get from you?\" [There are still one or two things I can give you.] God replied humbly towards Lee Shin Woo\u0027s snobbish sounding comment. God probably knew more about his latent potential than he did, so she wasn\u0027t lying. Lee Shin Woo briefly ruminated over it. But because the abilities God granted weren\u0027t inherently hostile, he just nodded his head, especially because he didn\u0027t really want another quest from her. \"Well, let\u0027s hear it.\" [An element.] The conversation turned in a completely different direction. Lee Shin Woo, who had been completely uninterested in what she said before, was somewhat surprised. [Even I didn\u0027t think you would be able to use elemental power so naturally. It would normally be impossible to bestow an element onto a hero, but... it should be no problem if I were to bestow one onto you.] His abilities had grown and he was extremely talented, so if God were to give him a small nudge, he could awaken a powerful ability. And he pretty much understood what God was saying. It didn\u0027t matter if it were fire or lightning; being given a small \u0027opportunity\u0027 was plenty. God was giving him that opportunity. [And if you accept this, it should become much easier for you to fight against Ethan.] \"Didn\u0027t you say that he was a good hero?\" [He can\u0027t compare to you at this point.] Looking at her statement in a different way, she was saying that if Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t defeated one of the 12 generals, then even if he had been done in by Ethan Cruz later, she would just pass it off with a laugh. \"... You\u0027re cruel. Seriously.\" [You\u0027re one to talk.] Lee Shin Woo thought that beings who had surpassed the limitations of humans were different, but God looked at him and snorted. It was as though she saw him as the same as her. [Now, focus.] \"Alright.\" The amount of time allotted to them wasn\u0027t very long. Lee Shin Woo softly closed his eyes and God released her energy. Lee Shin Woo immediately felt something enter his body, and it was infinitely dark and somber... It was similar to the curse that lingered in the Empire. No, that wasn\u0027t all. It was quite similar to the curse that he experienced often... what was it? While Lee Shin Woo pondered over the identity of this energy, that energy responded, and Lee Shin Woo lost all feeling in his body. His mana, which possessed no inherent properties, met with the energy as it released, and... it assimilated it, and he could feel a change. And soon, a terse response showed up before him. [You have acquired the Lv1 High Rank Element - Darkness. Magic has increased by 100.] [Curse Resistance - MAX has transformed into Darkness Resistance - MAX. Magic has increased by 20.] [Darkness is one of the great elements that makes up half of this world. It is peaceful, the power of shadows, the opposite of light, and the power of relationships.] [But darkness magic makes one forget that they are dead or alive, and can even force them to forget what they are. An imperfect and improper connection results in a twisted appearance... and this causes people to be afraid of it.] [You have become aware of this power, which originated from within you, due to outside stimuli, and have successfully grasped it. However, if you use too much power, others may become afraid of you. And ultimately, those natural relationships will break down and become twisted.] \"...This is...\" Lee Shin Woo realized why he felt familiar with this power. The relationships he\u0027d created with others... his partnership with Jin, accepting the Pauls as his subordinates... or even more broadly speaking, using the Command skill or Instigate skill to affect others and manipulate them was all because of the darkness element! However, at the same time, if what he felt was right, then this power was... \"Didn\u0027t the curse come from this element!?\" [You\u0027re right. To be exact, it was darkness magic that was used as the foundation. Your Curse Resistance changed into Darkness Resistance, right? You probably could\u0027ve brought about that change.] God acknowledged him and nodded her head, as if she wasn\u0027t spilling a huge secret. [You\u0027re probably well aware of this, but while you weren\u0027t consciously aware of this power, you used it bit by bit. I just awakened it and made it so you could actually use it in a proper form...] \"...\" [So, your existence has become much more shocking. Perhaps your karma is heading in that direction.] Though she was a god, could she not peruse his stats? At the very least, she didn\u0027t show any indication of knowing that he was a Joker. Perhaps this was also an effect of the Joker karma. [There\u0027s a huge difference in the results of those who use magic. I know that better than anyone else. So, make sure you work hard. ...I hope you don\u0027t become like the Emperor or Ethan.] \"...\" [Then, get going. I was so happy that I ended up giving you way too much.] \"Ah, just one second. I\u0027d like to ask you about Retadane...\" [It\u0027s impossible for even I to give you information on other heroes more than is necessary.] \"She\u0027s a hero, right? She\u0027s an ally, right?\" To top everything off, Lee Shin Woo asked God about his conclusion, and God just laughed and replied. [Of course she is. She\u0027s a trustworthy hero, more than anyone else.] Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-116","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
