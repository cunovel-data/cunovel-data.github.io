Kratia\u0027s Quest - 3\u003e\n Prince recognized the fact that she was weaker than Kratia, and it seemed like the situation was somehow resolved... but unfortunately, the situation didn\u0027t progress so smoothly.\n The joint operation... she hadn\u0027t even asked Lee Shin Woo\u0027s group to work together with her, yet she insisted that, as heroes, they had to clear the training facility together.\n \"We\u0027re going to the next level. Train by yourself. I don\u0027t like you.\"\n \"The next level? Don\u0027t lie. You came here before me? You came to the Empire a lot later than me, so how!?\"\n \"I can prove it to you.\"\n \"Keuk, that\u0027s a seal of completion... How!?\"\n Lee Shin Woo let Kratia and Prince bicker, and went to explore the facility alone... No, he and Jin moved secretly and explored with Rem. There were two things that was surprising about this facility. One, it was huge, and two, mana was filling it to the brim.\n [It looks like they used golem techniques as well. It cannot carry out specific commands, but a simple core was inserted that can carry out simple repetitive commands.]\n \"Looks that way. ...That looks like you could use it to train knights, too.\"\n There was a corner of the facility that made him think of an amusement park. Starting from the entrance, he followed the guide through the facility and would go from one building-shaped training ground to another.\n The difference between it and an amusement park was that there was a specific order one had to go through. And...\n \"It seems like there\u0027s no safety equipment...\"\n \"I\u0027ll get scared, so don\u0027t say stuff like that.\"\n \"But Kratia\u0027s right. It\u0027ll definitely help in controlling mana.\"\n Lee Shin Woo secretly glanced back. Kratia and Prince looked like they were still arguing, so he left them behind and entered the first facility. Then, he heard a mechanical sounding voice in his ear. It was a similar sound to that of a golem activating.\n [Beginning first training exercise. Testing how quickly the user can gather their mana.]\n [Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please gather enough mana to use intermediate magic at minimum.]\n \"Aha, so they do start with the fundamentals after all.\"\n \"Huh? I have to do this too.\"\n [Master, if you give me the order, I will destroy the facility\u0027s central hub. Probability of success: 80%.]\n \"For now, just do as it says.\"\n [I understand.]\n If it just wanted him to gather his mana into one spot, then he could\u0027ve done this when he was level 1, but by adding the intermediate magic stipulation, they were probably testing how fast one could gather their mana, as well as one\u0027s maximum capacity. To be honest, it wasn\u0027t all that difficult, so he did it immediately.\n [Beginning second training exercise. Testing ability to infuse mana, as well as how much is lost during the transfer.]\n [Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please infuse mana into the rock falling from above and stop it.]\n \"Huh?\"\n The message ended and at the same time, a giant rock suddenly fell from above their heads! Jin was taken aback, but Lee Shin Woo fired out mana that was accumulated in his hand and concentrated it into the rock. In addition, he used his connection with Jin to transfer the mana Jin had gathered to the rock as well.\n Rem could control mana well, as it possessed the Mana Parasite ability, and was easily able to infuse its mana into the rock. The moment the three\u0027s mana was completely infused, the once falling rock stopped in place. It was set up so that if an adequate amount of mana was infused, then the rock would stop falling.\n \"There\u0027s a limit to how inhospitable you can be; they\u0027re trying to kills us!\"\n \"Get a hold of yourself, Jin. You won\u0027t die if you get hit by a rock like this anymore.\"\n \"...Ah, you\u0027re right.\"\n [Passed. Beginning third training exercise. Testing rapid concentration and multiple infusions of mana.]\n [Three participants in the training exercise. Beginning training exercise. Please infuse a sufficient amount of mana into each and every rock that comes flying in every direction.]\n The third training exercise was even more ridiculous. There were cannons that seemed to spring out from everywhere within the vast facility; they aimed for Lee Shin Woo\u0027s party and sharp rocks were shot at them from every direction!\n Moreover, their mission objective was not to destroy or evade the rocks, but to infuse an adequate amount of mana into them to stop them! Jin was astonished once more, but Lee Shin Woo immediately progressed with the mission. To be honest, this was nothing compared to the complexity of making the Steelworker seal.\n \u0027All I have to do is calculate how much mana they need before they stop, and divide my mana and infuse it into them.\u0027\n The amount of mana he needed to use to stop each rock was identical. But before the rocks came close, he would have to sense them, fire his mana at a long-range, and infuse it into them, which was a bit complex. However, Lee Shin Woo was capable of this level of mana control when he was level 3, so he was able to do it easily.\n But Jin was the problem.\n \"Hey! Why aren\u0027t you stopping the ones coming at me! Hey!\"\n \"You have to practice too. It may look like it doesn\u0027t apply to you, but if you become able to control mana in a multitude of ways, then all of your abilities will get stronger.\"\n Lee Shin Woo said provokingly as he shot out his mana everywhere and accurately hit the rocks. \n After that, Jin was struck by quite a few more rocks (it didn\u0027t hurt much since he was covered in steel armor, but he felt quite bad) and gritted his teeth, then tried his best to imitate Lee Shin Woo. Of course, it wasn\u0027t that easy.\n \"No, not that way. You have to control it a bit more thoroughly. It seems like they won\u0027t stop if you infuse too much mana.\"\n \"How is this even possible!?\"\n But after continuously getting hit by the rocks, Jin concentrated more on his magic control, even if he was doing it out of anger. After 7 minutes of being struck by the barrage of rocks, he finally succeeded in infusing the right amount of mana into a rock! At that very moment, the rocks that had once been flying at them vanished.\n [Ending training exercise. Passed: 2, Failed: 1.]\n [Would you like to kick out the failure and continue with the next training exercise? Or would you like to retrain with the failure?]\n \"This guy is doing this on purpose, isn\u0027t he!? He ended it here on purpose, didn\u0027t he!?\"\n \"Calm down. If you get too excited, then you\u0027ll forget what it felt like!\"\n \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ll just destroy it all!\"\n Right when Jin was about to destroy the facility with his mouth cannon, the training was suspended and Kratia walked onto the premises. Prince was with her, though it looked like she still didn\u0027t understand what was going on.\n \"Shin Woo, we don\u0027t have time to waste on the basic training facility.\"\n \"Yeah, if you want to assess this frustrating kid\u0027s ability, then you have to go further in.\"\n \"So wait, you decided to work together?\"\n \"So long as they follow us and don\u0027t say anything.\"\n \"Keuk.\"\n \"Oh...\"\n It seemed as though an individual who had previously passed the training exercises can skip those facilities; it looked like companions could go with them as well. Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo thought briefly and got down from Jin\u0027s back.\n \u0027You\u0027re going to follow them!?\u0027\n \u0027I trust you. Plus, you need this training. Well, see you later.\u0027\n \u0027Hey...!\u0027\n Jin was so surprised that he leaped, but Lee Shin Woo just grinned and patted him. Once Prince entered, Rem went into stealth mode and hid itself. Lee Shin Woo placed Rem atop Jin\u0027s back so that it wouldn\u0027t be noticed.\n \u0027Rem, just make sure this guy doesn\u0027t die.\u0027\n \u0027I understand.\u0027\n Kratia, who had been watching that interaction, noticed that Rem went into stealth mode, but didn\u0027t say anything. That was because she realized that Lee Shin Woo was trying to hide a few facts that stemmed from him being a skeleton.\n But unrelated to that, Kratia was slightly disappointed in Prince, as she didn\u0027t notice Rem going into stealth mode. To be honest, it was only possible because Lee Shin Woo had added in his Assimilation and Disguise skills. If one couldn\u0027t grasp Rem\u0027s original mana, then it would fool anyone.\n \"A horse will just get in the way of your training. ...But if you just leave it like that, it won\u0027t leave?\"\n \"He\u0027s extremely smart, so it\u0027ll be fine.\"\n \"Then again, it does seem quite impressive for a horse that you got in the Empire... It\u0027s just like that elf said.\"\n \"Now, let\u0027s go forward. Kratia, you lead.\"\n When Prince saw Jin, who was wearing steel armor, she briefly admired him, but other than that, she paid him no mind. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had slightly used his ability here as well. He had succeeded in completely tearing her attention away from Jin and Rem.\n \"The further we go, the more complex it becomes. There are also sections that require combat.\"\n \"Combat?\"\n \"Since this is a dungeon. Monsters are led and restrained through magic.\"\n \"Ah, as expected.\"\n Lee Shin Woo then understood. Regardless of how amazing the Royal Magician Leader was, he wouldn\u0027t have been able to create this large of a subspace in a place that had nothing there. In other words, he had created this facility by using pre-existing dungeons.\n \"Though it is amazing that he tied together several dungeons into one.\"\n \"That\u0027s not something a human being can do...\"\n While they talked, the group used Kratia\u0027s free pass to get through the various facilities.\n As he passed through, Lee Shin Woo saw the hidden, bloodied iron maces hidden here and there, the thorn floor, the spears that were set up in the ceiling that threatened to fall, as well as the areas that were completely destroyed and rebuilt into the facilities with magic, etc... and he couldn\u0027t figure whether the Royal Magician Leader wanted to train magicians or to bury them.\n \"This facility also has a system that measures the level of magic, and whether one can use magic or not. It\u0027s not an ability inherent to the dungeon, so it\u0027s definitely an artifact. I was sure after I retraced the mana.\"\n \"R-Retraced?\"\n Prince\u0027s eyes shook. Yeah, Lee Shin Woo had roughly expected that she wouldn\u0027t know anything.\n \"We came here to clear all of the training exercises and take that. Don\u0027t touch it.\"\n \"But as a fellow hero, I should...\"\n \"You agreed to follow us and not say anything.\"\n \"Keuk...!\"\n \"But if you want the artifact, you can compete with us. Though it would be 2 on 1.\"\n Kratia dragged one of Lee Shin Woo’s arms towards her and hugged it, and laughed at Prince. After she had figured out that Prince was a girl, Kratia\u0027s way of teasing her had changed. It seemed like her teasing was quite effective.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t need your help if Lloyd was here...!\"\n \"If you needed help, you should\u0027ve brought him.\"\n \"But I couldn\u0027t stand the sight him enjoying that elf sticking to him, so I... Hey, why am I telling you this!? It\u0027s fine, you can take it all! All I need is an increase in my magical abilities!\"\n Lee Shin Woo watched as Prince got caught up in Kratia\u0027s simple trick as well as her self-implosion, and couldn\u0027t bear how cute she was. It felt like he was watching a couple of girls playing together.\n However, that soon came to an end. With Kratia\u0027s free pass, they passed through 70% of the facility and finally stopped in front of a large building.\n \"Starting here, it was impossible for me to do alone. A lot of monsters, and I mean a lot of monsters come. There are a lot of traps as well, and you have to control your magic during all of this. There\u0027s no time to even follow the commands. You just have to get through.\"\n Of course, the reason that the Royal Magician Leader had created this facility was to give the trainee a specific task and in the process of passing, they would become better at controlling magic, thus becoming a better magician overall.\n But because the danger of this facility was so high, anyone would pass if they got through the facility as well.\n \"Do I just need to take care of the monsters?\"\n \"If you can.\"\n \"It should be fine if I just burn the entire facility.\"\n \"That could... work.\"\n \"Alright, then let\u0027s start.\"\n \"Wait a sec.\"\n Kratia stopped Prince, who was about to enter the facility. Compared to when she was teasing her before, Kratia spoke in a quite serious tone.\n \"Since so much time has passed, the facility has developed in a completely different direction from the original creator\u0027s wishes. We have to prepare as much as we can.\"\n \"So you want to use tricks instead of doing it fairly? I can\u0027t do that. My pride as a magician won\u0027t allow me to!\"\n \"You had a free pass all the way here, and yet...\"\n \"All the more reason that I have to prove myself here! If you\u0027re afraid, then I\u0027ll go in first. You can follow behind me!\"\n He knew this would happen eventually, but it happened at a crucial time; Prince didn\u0027t heed Kratia\u0027s warning and charged. Kratia clicked her tongue as she saw Prince charge into the facility alone. Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully.\n \"Do we not need to follow her?\"\n \"She\u0027ll come out soon. You get a chance to do that.\"\n Kratia ended up being right. Once she said that, Prince rushed out of the facility while shivering and looking as though she would cry. She had only been in there for but a moment, yet her clothes were in tatters and beneath her ripped robes, he could slightly see her lingerie top.\n \"T-The monsters... the monsters...!\"\n \"There, there. It’ll be fine.\"\n She had received such an extreme shock that she temporarily reverted to a preschooler, so Lee Shin Woo comforted her. Above all, the scariest part was that the facility was still extremely quiet, even at this very moment.\n Lee Shin Woo comforted Prince and waited for Kratia to explain the facility to them. She smiled slightly and said honestly.\n \"Despite it being a subspace that was creating by connecting several dungeons together, it wasn\u0027t managed properly and was neglected for dozens of years, so there are a lot of monsters clumped up in that limited space. They\u0027re all at least level 6...\"\n \"How many?\"\n \"...I could only count about 50,000. Plus, it\u0027s frustrating because whenever you mess up, the monsters are all buffed.\"\n \"Hoh.\"\n The moment he heard that, Lee Shin Woo equipped his sword, the Breath of the Lightning God. One in each hand at that!\n \"That sounds really interesting.\"\n Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t understood why he had to come to a facility designed to train magicians, but now he did. \u0027Kratia, thanks for bringing me here!\u0027\n \"Then, shall we go in when we\u0027re all ready?\"\n \"I really like that about you.\"\n The mana that once flowed throughout his body was redirected into his two Breath of the Lightning Gods. As if responding to him, Kratia concentrated mana into her orb while bringing out magical devices that he\u0027d never even seen before one by one.\n Prince, who was silently watching them from the side, said.\n \"Can I go after I change my clothes?\"\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-131","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
