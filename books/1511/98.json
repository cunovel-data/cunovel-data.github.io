What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\\n\\n Jin looked at Lee Shin Woo oddly, who\u0027d just returned after being completely robbed at the secret shop. He wondered whether he should tell Jin that he\u0027d been caught up in Pleine\u0027s business acumen and only had 20,000 Perium left, but decided against it.\\n\\n \"Did you get a charge skill?\"\\n\\n \"I was able to get a good one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a relief... But wait, why were you late in the first place?\"\\n\\n Jin was extremely curious, but Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t tell him the details. That\u0027s because he had promised Pleine that he wouldn\u0027t tell anyone else what they\u0027d discussed.\\n\\n Therefore, when Jin suggested that they practice the charge skill together, Lee Shin Woo shook his head, saying no to that as well.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s try it after I gain Lightning Resistance.\"\\n\\n \"Lightning Resistance!?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a good skill, but I didn\u0027t think it\u0027d have that kind of a problem when I bought it... No, I\u0027d probably still have bought it even if I knew about it beforehand.\"\\n\\n After paying a sum total of 41.5 million Perium, he\u0027d learned the high rank skill, Lightning Sprint, which would wrap the entire body in lightning and charge with an impressive speed and destructive force; a wild skill.\\n\\n Ordinarily, the skill could only be used when one is contracted to a lightning spirit, but Lee Shin Woo was able to use the skill without any problems, as he could create lightning by himself. It also had a high compatibility with Bursting Thunder as well.\\n\\n \"High rank skills aren\u0027t often sold in the shop, but when they are, they\u0027re sold immediately. But it seems like this one hadn\u0027t been sold because of the troublesome conditions.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying that you\u0027ve satisfied all the conditions, but you can\u0027t use it because of me, huh...\"\\n\\n There was no way the lightning would inflict damage on its caster, but the problem was Jin. Because it would create such intense lightning, befitting its high ranking, he couldn\u0027t use it before Jin learned at least intermediate lightning resistance. If he himself possessed lightning resistance, he would be able to share it with Jin, but he didn\u0027t have it.\\n\\n \"I could also just not ride on your back and use it, but that\u0027s pretty pointless.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n The reason Lee Shin Woo\u0027s charge attacks possessed such destructive force was because of Jin\u0027s formidable speed and reaction time. He couldn\u0027t match it, even with a high rank skill.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t sell lightning resistance in the shop?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not just lightning. They don\u0027t sell any resistances. I didn\u0027t really know, but apparently resistances are really amazing.\u0027\\n\\n \"Ah, yeah. That sounds about right...\"\\n\\n There was the problem of obtaining the resistance, but there was also the issue of training it. Resistances level up when one is heavily damaged by an element, but most people weren\u0027t stupid enough to continuously put themselves in that kind of situation... Even if one possessed resistances, low rank to intermediate would probably be the max for them.\\n\\n \"But that means that you can\u0027t use that charge skill of yours.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we have no choice but to substitute it with your skill and Shadow Horn for now...\"\\n\\n Though he spent pretty much all his money to buy these three skills, he couldn\u0027t even use a single one of them immediately! It felt as though he\u0027d been robbed, but he\u0027d already learned the skills, so he couldn\u0027t get a refund. Jin threw something out there.\\n\\n \"Why did you even go to the shop again?\"\\n\\n \"It hurts enough without you reminding me, so could you lay off?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d been hurt both physically and mentally, travelled to the closest golem train station. There were only two trains that went to level 3 danger zones, located in either the western or eastern part of the Empire.\\n\\n They were areas he couldn\u0027t have even imagined going to when he first rode on the train, but now they had to go to at least level 3 danger zones to grow. They would\u0027ve moved on to the level 3 danger zones earlier had it not been for the Paul expansion plan.\\n\\n \"When I look back, we\u0027ve travelled through about 60% of the Empire in a few months.\"\\n\\n \"But the tough part starts now.\"\\n\\n After they\u0027d heard an explanation regarding the concept of \u0027danger zones\u0027, a few months had passed, yet nothing changed amongst the other heroes. Most of them were still residing near the level 3 danger zone satellite cities that were connected with the large cities.\\n\\n Apparently, they would only be able to see level 6 or level 7s in level 4 or higher danger zones; so it could be said that Lee Shin Woo and Jin\u0027s experiences were just a taste of what is to come. Their adventure, as well as their Bone Reinforcement had just begun.\\n\\n \"Level 7 elites... Bones that are tasty and good for you...\"\\n\\n \"Man, you\u0027re already starting to talk about that?\"\\n\\n This wasn\u0027t the first time that he\u0027d looked at Lee Shin Woo and thought, \u0027I guess I\u0027m going to die this time\u0027, but it seemed as though that time was actually quickly approaching this time. Even after he\u0027d seen firsthand that Shino Rendu had died after invading a satellite city, Lee Shin Woo was still ready to attack it!\\n\\n \"Even I won\u0027t do something as stupid as Shino Rendu. Yeah, I\u0027m going to attack the city, but I\u0027m going to get out quickly too.\"\\n\\n \"So in other words, you\u0027re going to invade the city and then rely on my mobility.\"\\n\\n \"You noticed that? You really are the best partner.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, though you don\u0027t have any of that sense.\"\\n\\n \"Who, me?\"\\n\\n Whilst conversing with Lee Shin Woo, Jin had become uneasy, and checked how many Blessings of Death he\u0027d accumulated.\\n\\n Because of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s instruction, Jin was better able to absorb the surrounding curse and had accumulated nine lives. However, he was still concerned whether or not this was enough.\\n\\n \"The speed at which your Blessing of Death stockpiles will increase from now on as well.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to a place really close to death, aren\u0027t we...?\"\\n\\n The two arrived at the train station and unhesitatingly rode the train. They were now used to the sudden acceleration, and Lee Shin Woo was no longer weak enough to fall from its speed. Lee Shin Woo had realized just how much he\u0027d grown from such an unexpected source.\\n\\n However, the moment the train stopped and they got off and onto the platform, Lee Shin Woo felt a powerful but familiar wave of mana. He tilted his head, and instinctually hid his mana.\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n [It\u0027s been a while, Paul Zero.]\\n\\n In the center of the platform where all nine trains were on standby, they saw Guillotine Steelworker, someone they hadn\u0027t seen since being given authorization to use the trains. It seemed as though he\u0027d confirmed that the train had entered the platform and had come directly over.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a long time... Were you waiting for us?\"\\n\\n [That\u0027s right.]\\n\\n Guillotine looked quite serious, causing Lee Shin Woo to inwardly feel quite uneasy, yet he maintained a calm expression. To be honest, the only thing he needed to do was keep his goblin fire blazing at a steady rate.\\n\\n \"But we haven’t been causing much trouble lately.\"\\n\\n [You\u0027re right. You\u0027ve also been disposing of the low rank golems for us... I was thinking about spying on you, but I chose not to. I wasn\u0027t waiting to interrogate you.]\\n\\n \"Then, do you have a request?\"\\n\\n [You\u0027re really quick on the uptake, you rascal.]\\n\\n Guillotine sported a bitter smile at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s words. Despite being a golem, the way the skin on his face moved was truly sensitive. And when he thought about it, he was also jealous of his natural hair. It wouldn\u0027t get like that through hair transplantation. I hope you lose all your hair!\\n\\n [You should already have some idea, but we\u0027ve been keeping an eye on you whenever you\u0027ve come and gone from this place. Since we had no choice but to be suspicious.]\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s your request...?\"\\n\\n [Yeah. We\u0027re not as suspicious of you as we once were. At the very least, we\u0027re sure that you\u0027re not one of the Emperor\u0027s men.]\\n\\n \"I told you that at the beginning, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n [Haha.]\\n\\n They both knew, whether it be the uncomfortably speaking Lee Shin Woo or the awkwardly smiling Guillotine. That they couldn\u0027t truly trust one another. But they could agree that they \u0027wouldn\u0027t act to harm the other\u0027. It had taken this much time to reach that conclusion.\\n\\n [Like you said, I have a request for you. It may be difficult for you, as you\u0027re level 5, but it should be possible with the help of your group.]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s eyes gleamed for two reasons. Firstly, Guillotine didn\u0027t get his level right. That meant that Lee Shin Woo was concealing his mana from a higher leveled individual.\\n\\n And secondly...\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have a group backing me though.\"\\n\\n [Let\u0027s leave it at that.]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo only inwardly smiled bitterly at Guillotine\u0027s reply.\\n\\n At the time, Lee Shin Woo had told him that both he and Jin were the result of their test, and that only they were the survivors of the test; but so long as the golems weren’t idiots, there was no way they\u0027d just trust him. It was obvious that they\u0027d assume that there were others backing Lee Shin Woo and Jin.\\n\\n And from the very beginning, that was what Lee Shin Woo was aiming for.\\n\\n \u0027A small lie is exposed when trying to hide a larger lie. In order for them to believe my lie that Jin and I were the only survivors of the test, I clumsily acted like I was hiding the fact that there was a group behind me. And they focused on that...\u0027\\n\\n Thus, they thought of Lee Shin Woo as some sort of secret agent for some unknown group. Just like he had planned.\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t it hurt your head to always be thinking so complicatedly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Surprise. I don\u0027t even have a brain!\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo and Jin exchanged trifling jokes through their connection, and Guillotine Steelworker went to the main point. As expected, he had quite a serious tone.\\n\\n [Do you remember what the General told you last time... regarding our creation?]\\n\\n \"Of course I remember.\"\\n\\n [Good. Then that quickens things. At the time, the Emperor sacrificed promising knights for his own protection. The Metal Army was established with 500 members, but thousands were sacrificed in order to make that 500.]\\n\\n \"Thousands...\"\\n\\n [So what would\u0027ve happened to the thousands of knights sacrificed? They were discarded. In order to conceal how wicked the Emperor was, the testing facilities were completely buried.]\\n\\n \"...No way.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo momentarily froze at an awful thought that came up. Guillotine Steelworker nodded his head calmly.\\n\\n [It\u0027s probably as you\u0027ve imagined. They likely were resurrected and became undead. We made a mistake; we should\u0027ve cremated them, but we didn\u0027t...]\\n\\n \"That\u0027s... I ended up hearing something that puts a bad taste in my mouth.\"\\n\\n [If I could, I would take care of it myself, but... the day following the curse, the General forbid any of us from going outside. That\u0027s why I\u0027d like you to do it in my place.]\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n He spoke as if it were completely unrelated to him, but the conversation ended up going back to him. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s goblin fire narrowed. Guillotine Steelworker continued.\\n\\n [It\u0027s time for them to rest. I hope that you\u0027ll let them rest in peace in our place. I\u0027ll tell you where they are. It\u0027s near the satellite city, Kadinan. You\u0027ll be right there if you take that train.]\\n\\n \"Is that all?\"\\n\\n [Of course.]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo momentarily didn\u0027t respond to Guillotine\u0027s unnecessarily brisk response and acted as though he were thinking about it, but... like always, he made his decision right away.\\n\\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll take up your request. There\u0027s a reward, right?\"\\n\\n [If you return, I\u0027ll give you something beyond your expectations. I promise, as Guillotine Steelworker, one of the Four Commanders.]\\n\\n Considering that he called himself one of the Four Commanders, there must be three other level 7 golems aside from Guillotine. Lee Shin Woo roughly nodded his head at Guillotine\u0027s confident declaration. Though Jin looked like he was feeling uneasy, Lee Shin Woo just ignored him.\\n\\n \"Then I trust you\u0027ll keep your promise and go immediately.\"\\n\\n [Good luck.]\\n\\n Guillotine, who was worried that Lee Shin Woo would ask some more questions, saw Lee Shin Woo accept his request unhesitatingly and immediately get on the train. Once they were inside, he smiled without them knowing.\\n\\n The train soon departed. Guillotine was the only one remaining and turned around, but suddenly, he heard a dignified voice from within his head. It was Arema Steelworker\u0027s voice.\\n\\n [Guillotine, I believe that was an order I gave to you.]\\n\\n [I wanted to reduce our casualties. Moreover, there\u0027s reports that the other generals are getting more involved now, so I thought that we\u0027d be discovered if we went outside, no matter how careful we were.]\\n\\n [But if they were to discover the facility...]\\n\\n [Even if they were to find it, they don\u0027t have the right to enter it.]\\n\\n Arema hesitated once he heard Guillotine, and Guillotine continued to press.\\n\\n [Paul Zero only possesses general administrative authority. Unless you\u0027re a golem, one cannot possess an authority any higher than that. Isn\u0027t that what you said, Sir Arema?]\\n\\n [... It\u0027s plenty surprising already that he acquired a general administrative authority from just studying a golem. That\u0027s why I originally thought he was one of the Emperor\u0027s men.]\\n\\n [Indeed, it is surprising. It\u0027s something we need to pay attention to. Thus, if he were to come back safely after completing the task, I\u0027m planning on watching him through hidden surveillance. This task was a good excuse to give him that.]\\n\\n [...Mm...]\\n\\n Arema, who had been pondering, was persuaded by Guillotine and looked favorably upon his plan.\\n\\n [Fine. I entrusted you with this, so do as you please. But you have to take responsibility for it as well.]\\n\\n [I\u0027ll keep that in mind, my lord.]\\n\\n As soon as Arema Steelworker\u0027s voice, which took hold of both his mind and body disappeared, Guillotine instinctually ended up sighing.\\n\\n Then, he walked over to the production facility in order to create a Surveillance Unit Zero to give to Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-98","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
