Fake Hero Saga - 5\u003e First off, Lee Shin Woo visited the Lawrence shop\u0027s capital branch, checked the interior, and dumped items from his inventory into the storehouse. He was then led to the residence Bisher Moon had acquired for him. Seeing the huge size of the house was an indirect confirmation of Bisher Moon\u0027s success. Jin complained as he was the only one who couldn\u0027t enter the building, but there was no helping it. Lee Shin Woo once again thought that he needed to hurry up and master the Disguise skill. [It\u0027s been a long time, Lord Paul Zero.] \"Long time no see. It seems like you\u0027ve exceeded my expectations.\" [It\u0027s an honor that you feel that way. I\u0027ve made a list, albeit poorly, of all the forces and goods we\u0027ve acquired, so I\u0027ll present it to you later.] As promised, Bisher Moon met with Lee Shin Woo in the evening; he wore a stylish suit and was refined, so much so that Lee Shin Woo would believe it if he said he were a noble\u0027s butler. He was a handsome man that evoked a cold feeling, with gray hair and reddish-brown eyes. No matter how you looked at him, he looked like a proper human. He didn\u0027t look like an undead at all. \"Alright. It\u0027s a relief that you were able to properly transform into a human.\" [Yes. I was a bit concerned, as I had never made the attempt after becoming an undead, but...] Bisher Moon\u0027s original species was the Moon Wolf. They were a race of werewolves who hovered between the boundary of human and wolf. Bisher Moon\u0027s kind were the elites, blessed by the moon more so than any other werewolf tribe. The \u0027Moon\u0027 title was a dead giveaway; amongst the Moon Wolves, Bisher Moon was equivalent to royalty. However, he had become undead and degenerated into a mere ghoul. Lee Shin Woo had played on Bisher Moon\u0027s desire for revenge and as a result, Bisher Moon had pledged his loyalty to him and evolved into a completely new species: the Wolf Avenger. He regained his abilities as a Moon Wolf and had even gained the title of Avenger, so if he excluded the fact that he\u0027d turned into an undead, he had become much stronger than before. \u0027No, wait. Avengers are undead created only after one has experienced death before and then revived due to their thirst for vengeance... In other words, it seems like a class that only the undead can get.\u0027 In any case, Bisher Moon had regained his long lost power as a Moon Wolf, and by subordinating himself to Lee Shin Woo, his darkness magic had become even stronger; this was especially true regarding his original transformation skill. He had been influenced by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s innate abilities and had become noticeably stronger. That\u0027s right. While incomparable with Lee Shin Woo, Bisher Moon could also use his magic to disguise himself as a living being. This was one of the reasons that Lee Shin Woo had picked Bisher Moon to accompany him, despite having so many subordinates to choose from. [It\u0027s supposed to be difficult to obtain the ability to disguise an undead\u0027s mana unless you\u0027re a vampire. However, by subordinating myself to you, I was able to obtain that ability. I\u0027m in awe of your abilities, Lord Paul Zero.] \"Thanks for the compliment, but you saying that makes me feel kind of tense; I feel like I\u0027ll meet a vampire somewhere down the line.\" [To tell you the truth...] \"Damn it. I knew this would happen...!\" What he said next was classic. The darkness within the capital would deepen at night, and there was a group that hid inside said darkness. Both Bisher Moon and that group fought against each other to increase their power! With the goods Lee Shin Woo had entrusted to him, as well as his own skills, Bisher Moon was quickly able to increase his power, but by doing so, he had come into contact with the capital\u0027s deepest darkness. With the backing of a Count that resided within the capital, the organization went wild; however, the organization had a huge secret. [And I was recently able to figure it out, just barely. A vampire lurks within the \u0027Red Moon\u0027 faction, the group that opposes our own \u0027Moon Shadow\u0027.\" \"Yeah, I saw that coming. By the way, everyone sure loves the moon.\" The Underground Empire had been filled with things he\u0027d never experienced before, but once he\u0027d come to the surface, he repeatedly experienced things that would happen in any fantasy novel. But a battle between the vampires and the werewolves in this city of the night? Aside from the original, he couldn\u0027t acknowledge or understand it. Moreover, both factions had the word \u0027moon\u0027 in it! It was a relief that his side only one had werewolf in it. \"Don\u0027t waste your time on such a pointless fight and end it already. Want me to help?\" [Not only do they have a noble in their group, but information on our group has spread, so it would be difficult to fight them head on. If we attack them half-baked, then we\u0027ll lose our standing in the capital. If we\u0027re going for it, then we have to strike at their core. Perhaps then I\u0027ll ask you for your help, Lord Paul Zero.] \"Alright, I got it.\" The Count that Bisher Moon had found was likely under the control of a vampire. The fact that Bisher Moon could easily find information on them meant that there was a key figure in the \u0027Red Moon\u0027 that used them as shields. A giant force that had power over day and night... It probably wasn\u0027t the Emperor, but it had to be someone close, like a high ranking noble. \u0027Both sides are really daring. When all the undead were forced into the underground, they weren\u0027t purged and instead have been operating in the capital and raising their forces all this time. Which means...\u0027 They were powerful and daring enough to fool even the Emperor. An unexpected competitor had shown up. Knowing this information beforehand would prove indispensable. \"Wait a sec. Then, what\u0027s most important is...\" [It\u0027s to ensure that they don\u0027t figure out the link between us, Lord Paul Zero. But you don\u0027t have to worry about that. Since I can use darkness magic as well.] \"Are you sure you\u0027re up for it?\" [Of course. You can count on me.] \"Alright. Then I\u0027ll leave it to you.\" After that, Lee Shin Woo accepted and read Bisher Moon\u0027s report. The report summarized Bisher Moon\u0027s successes, including how many troops he\u0027d gathered and managed, important figures, and an account of their finances. With feats like this, Bisher Moon could raise his head up high. He was surprised that Bisher Moon had gathered so many troops in such a short period of time (less than a month). \"300 buildings, with at least a hundred of them in the capital\u0027s main street. As expected, they\u0027re disguised as either shops or inns. Moreover... you won over a noble too?\" [My identity wasn\u0027t revealed, but I was able to recruit those who opposed the Red Moon, which is where most of the low ranking nobles gather. In the process, I tried to imitate you, albeit poorly and was somehow able to resolve the issue well. Now they\u0027re completely loyal to the organization (Moon Shadow).] \"Unbelievable.\" They say a child learns from their parents. This was a good example of that. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t know when Bisher even had the opportunity to watch and learn from him, but this was quite the success! \"Good. You\u0027ve done well. Now I don\u0027t have to meet them one by one.\" [There were several people I couldn\u0027t persuade. If you just give me a little bit more time, then...] \"Leave them to me. I just got a title that might work here.\" [As expected of my lord...!] Lee Shin Woo had originally planned on spreading Lawrence and Kay\u0027s names far and wide, and slowly build his position in the capital, but due to the Sun God religion\u0027s support, his plan had been sped up by a few months. As the hero, Kay, he had cleared unconquered dungeons one after another, ones which had been untouched by mankind, and regained human territory. Plus, he made the Sun God\u0027s light more well known! He was powerful enough that a low rank noble wouldn\u0027t be able to deal with him. [You really get along with him (your subordinate)...] [If we can deal with the Emperor somehow, then you should be able to seize control over the entire Magic Empire, Lord Paul Zero.] \"Why do I have to carry that burden?\" Lee Shin Woo wanted to live freely, he didn\u0027t want to live for others. It may sound like this was coming out of the blue, as he was now the Heaven Defying general, but managing his subordinates was a real pain in the ass. He imagined managing something as large as the Empire and just sighed. \"Being a peddler (Lawrence) is plenty enough for me.\" \"Mr. Shin Woo. It\u0027s too late, so please just accept it.\" Ye Jin Jin laughed and Lee Shin Woo felt his dreams being cut apart. Lee Shin Woo twisted Ye Jin Jin\u0027s nose as punishment (she seemed happy for some reason, but she was a pervert, so it wasn\u0027t all that new) and then gave her his orders. \"We\u0027ll officially start up the Lawrence shop tomorrow. The shop\u0027s not well known enough in the capital as of yet. We\u0027ll focus on increasing our power for the time being.\" [I acquired a few small shops, so I should be able to help you discreetly, Madam.] \"Madam...!\" Ye Jin Jin blushed and twisted her body around. How did he find out? He hadn\u0027t shown any signs, but Bisher Moon had found out regardless; Lee Shin Woo felt quite uneasy. [I figured it out based on the space between you two, the way Ms. Ye Jin Jin looks at you, and various other factors. The spirit you\u0027re traveling with as well... Ah, I\u0027m right.] [As... expected of one of Paul Zero\u0027s subordinates.] \u0027It sure is a relief that Jin couldn\u0027t come inside,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought and smiled bitterly. No, now wasn\u0027t the time to be engaging in this love comedy. Lee Shin Woo shook his head and asked Bisher Moon. \"Bisher Moon, did you get what I asked for through Rem?\" [I thought it would be quite difficult to obtain, as it is stored in the heart of the Empire, but... I was somehow able to procure it with Rem\u0027s help. I was shocked when I witnessed Rem\u0027s ability to nullify level 7 golems.] \"Yeah. Rem might be the strongest when there\u0027re a lot of golems around. I\u0027ll take over later, so bring it to me personally.] [Understood.] \"What are you talking about? Was there an item hidden within the capital that you wanted, Mr. Shin Woo?\" She didn\u0027t directly ask if he stole something, but went about it in a roundabout way. In response, Lee Shin Woo smiled meaningfully. \"It\u0027s the best loot I\u0027ve gotten from the surface.\" Once he\u0027d carefully looked over Bisher Moon\u0027s report, Lee Shin Woo discussed the direction they\u0027d go from now on (concerning the cooperation between the Lawrence shop and Moon Shadow, or what the hero Kay would be doing), as well as any urgent problems. After that, he told them to break up. [Then, I\u0027ll give you my report.] Now it was Rem\u0027s turn. He wanted to know how it had acquired the golems without the Emperor\u0027s notice, how the golems were arranged, and how many there were. He\u0027d heard about it on his way here already, but if he reviewed it again, then he\u0027d be able to adjust their future actions. Of particular note was the discovery of a few spirits. Golems were placed across the Empire and sought out spirits under the Emperor\u0027s command, so they were able to find spirits faster than anything else. It was important that he let the Spirits\u0027 Spring spirits know so they could take care of it. [Of course, I deleted all of the golem\u0027s previous orders, but I cannot force them to act outside of their designated routines. Thus, the spirits must act quickly.] \"Let\u0027s ask Sinea for help with that. You don\u0027t need to report each and every matter to me. Just inform the spirits through Sinea.\" [Understood. Aside from that, I acquired information from the capital in order of importance...] While Lee Shin Woo was organizing and analyzing Bisher Moon and Rem\u0027s information, Sinea and Ye Jin Jin were fighting; starting tomorrow, Lee Shin Woo would be busy with his work as Kay, so they were fighting for the right to be with Lee Shin Woo this evening. \"With this, I have 4 wins and 3 losses...! I win!\" [It\u0027s a deuce. If you lose the next game, then it\u0027s invalid. Hurry up, go on to the next game!] \"When did we have such a rule!?\" If they were fighting with pure strength, then Ye Jin Jin would lose instantly, but because they were using the board game Lee Shin Woo had created to determine victory or defeat, they weren\u0027t getting a clear winner or loser. Ultimately, Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d finished with his work, ended their dispute by promising that he\u0027d bring both of them to his bedroom. Even though he was disguised as a human, his infinite stamina as an undead remained. \"Mr. Shin Wooooo.\" [Can\u0027t you give me another hug?] \"Seriously, do some work. Work!\" That would end Lee Shin Woo\u0027s unpaid leave. Sinea and Ye Jin Jin thought it\u0027d be nice if the night would go on forever, but there was no way their wish would be fulfilled. Lee Shin Woo calmly shook off Sinea and Ye Jin Jin and stood up. He was hit by the rays of the morning sun and equipped his armor once more. He had gotten a report from the Sun God religion; they had procured the level 7 dungeon.
