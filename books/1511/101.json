Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 2\u003e \"There aren\u0027t that many magicians over here.\" \"What...?\" It\u0027d been three days since he\u0027d patrolled the inner city, and this was the result he\u0027d come to after comparing information with Jin. Hearing that, Jin was momentarily dumbstruck, but soon retorted. \"You said those guys were the ones you needed to be most wary of. That it wouldn\u0027t be so simple; that it wasn\u0027t just knights patrolling around.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought, but when I actually looked around, I found that it wasn\u0027t all that. That\u0027s what you found in your patrol too, right?\" \"That\u0027s... That\u0027s true.\" There had been a time that Lee Shin Woo had assumed that all high leveled magicians would be on par with Kratia. However, that wasn\u0027t the case. Kratia was the exception. Then again, she was a hero; she wouldn\u0027t be a hero if she wasn\u0027t the exception. \u0027Moreover, it\u0027s pretty obvious that their intellect went down considerably when they turned into the undead, though I\u0027m not sure about their magic.\u0027 Normally, there weren\u0027t that many undead that could even use magic. Even if they could, most of them could only focus on one or two spells. That\u0027s because they wouldn\u0027t be able to properly cast the spells without the calculations; the spells that they could cast were ones that they\u0027d often used while they were still alive and were deeply instinctual. Of course, the higher leveled they were, the more they regained their abilities and intellect, so more higher leveled undead could use magic. However, the effectiveness of their magic was still a few levels down! \"Then what about that feminine looking undead? There\u0027s a level 6 undead in the castle.\" \"Yeah. There is one magician in this city that I have to be wary of.\" Though there were few that were defending the inner city, the reason that the lord was so willing to send most of his knights to the outskirts was because he had someone he could count on in the inner city. It was none other than the level 6 Magician Leader! The Magician Leader was dreary and feminine (the fact that he could ascertain what gender she was made it clear that she was a high rank undead), and like the lord, looked emaciated. At first glance, she looked slender, but she possessed impressive magic. It was at a level that didn\u0027t trail behind Kratia\u0027s, whose magic he\u0027d checked before they parted ways. \"But that just means I have to be wary of her during battle. That\u0027s all. I\u0027m sure of it. Her communication abilities, surveillance abilities, and even her skill in basic magic searching is worse than mine. Even if she saw normal patterns that moved magic, or if I used magic to secretly provoke her, her response was always the same.\" \"If you provoke her, she might report it to the lord!\" \"Including all that, don\u0027t we need to see how she responds to such a provocation?\" \"...\" That meant that he was confident that his identity wouldn\u0027t be exposed, regardless of how she responded to the provocation. Jin felt sick of hearing Lee Shin Woo\u0027s confident attitude. The most surprising thing was that it wasn\u0027t arrogance; that confidence always came from a thorough analysis. \"And as a result of my tests, she wasn\u0027t able to sense my magic until very late, and was barely even able to sense it. Next, I released magic a few times into the air. Ultimately, it seemed as though she thought she was seeing things and returned to what she was doing.\" \"That trait of finally sensing magic but then not really doing anything about it really fits an undead...\" \"Right?\" In other words, no matter how powerful they were, their brains were damaged, and thus, they were idiots. Her magic\u0027s offensive capabilities were likely unquestionable, but this wasn\u0027t the first time he\u0027d fought against a powerful opponent; Lee Shin Woo was even confident enough that he could get close to and take care of her before she could even start casting her magic. \"The magicians aren\u0027t really following the imperial command. The alarms in the city or the patrol routes aren\u0027t covered by magic, and their only real purpose is to act as artillery troops...\" \"Then there\u0027s nothing to be afraid of now. Let\u0027s go to the secret facility.\" \"No, not yet. There\u0027s just one more thing I have to do before we can move on.\" It was to find their communication line with the 12 generals. If he just found it, and either destroyed or secured it, then he would have nothing to be afraid of. And now that he\u0027d figured out that the magicians weren\u0027t all that strong, the thing he had to look out for was... \"The lord.\" \"You\u0027re just doing this for fun, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027m doing this so we can avoid danger and get a clean victory, you know? Ah, Jin. Starting now, figure out how to covertly get into the city without being seen.\" \"Can\u0027t we just kill the lord and prevent them from contacting the 12 generals?\" \"Well, you\u0027ll see.\" Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t blowing everything out of proportion just so that he could fulfill Guillotine Steelworker\u0027s request. He wanted to use this chance of infiltrating the city to figure out how the Empire operated... He also wanted to take over the level 3 danger zone city as well. To do that, he couldn\u0027t just kill the lord and run! \u0027But if Jin knew about this, he wouldn\u0027t really cooperate with me.\u0027 He\u0027d already experienced clearing several level 2 danger zone cities, but the level 3 danger zones and up were completely different. There were three level 6 elites in this city alone, and there also some normal level 6s on top of that... there were also hundreds of level 5s. If he added in the level 4 knights as well, they couldn\u0027t take on those numbers. It would be barely doable to fight straight-up if he had all of the Pauls and Golems with him. However, Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t use up his valuable resources here. \u0027Those guys... I should be able to use them.\u0027 He left his lodgings and returned to doing his duty whilst his brain turned hectically. How could he destroy this city whilst completing his objective... He was gradually estimating how he would go about it. [Now... give your regular report...] \u0027Huh...?\u0027 It had only been a day since he\u0027d marked the lord as his primary target, yet surprisingly, things were progressing much faster than he expected! While Lee Shin Woo was on his regular patrol and wasn\u0027t even bothering to hide his presence, he began to see a peculiar magic reaction, though it seemed like the lord hadn\u0027t expected him, a \u0027mere knight\u0027 to see him. [Where, here... this way...] Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t miss the lord\u0027s flow of magic from beyond the bedroom door, and clearly remembered it. It seemed as though the lord wasn\u0027t guarded in the least and was letting the world see his magic. \u0027It\u0027s not really that difficult.\u0027 To be exact, it was about the same level as the Anti-Skull\u0027s security. It was so easy to figure out that he actually felt uneasy; after the magic pattern was displayed, he heard a small sound coming from inside the room. At the same time, he felt an odd magic reaction... it seems as though the lord had just taken out an item that he had been hiding. [Mm...] At that moment, the mana pattern that the lord exhibited changed again. If the first was to unlock the security around the castle, then this one was to activate the magic tool that he\u0027d taken out. \u0027This isn\u0027t very tough either.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t very difficult for someone who possessed general administrative rights. Of course, if the other heroes knew, including Kratia, they\u0027d be pissed. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s magical ability had developed significantly; to such an extent that they couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine. [Greetings, Lightning General.] After Lee Shin Woo had completely memorized the magic pattern, he listened carefully to the suddenly speaking lord. Unfortunately, he couldn\u0027t hear the other speaker, but he could at least tell that the one he was speaking to was one of the 12 generals, or more specifically, the Lightning General. [There are no abnormalities. Yes, of course.] [Our defense remains impenetrable. A golem, or even a single fly won\u0027t be able to get through. But what kind of golem... No, it\u0027s nothing.] If Lee Shin Woo still had lips, he would be smiling bitterly right now. It was apparent that the lord\u0027s back was bent and that he was kowtowing, even through the wall. Lee Shin Woo could also observe their one-sided relationship. That must prove just how high a General\u0027s position was. But then... [Unimportant changes...? But, mm...] Because the lord kept repeating the Lightning General\u0027s instructions, Lee Shin Woo was able to hear what the Lightning General was saying. As he thought, once an undead gets around the General level, they\u0027re able to surpass the limited intellect of an \u0027undead\u0027, which was slightly worrying to him... [There\u0027s nothing like that. Yes, you can trust me to carry out your orders.] Fortunately, because the lord was an idiot, the lord didn\u0027t mention Lee Shin Woo at all! Of course, even if he did mention him, he was still acting as though he was an undead loyal to the Empire, so it wouldn\u0027t be such a big deal. However, it was obviously much better to just pass over him than to draw attention to him. [Then in a month... Yes, of course. I\u0027ll contact you if those golem bastards show up. His Imperial Majesty... it\u0027s a relief that he\u0027s still healthy!] The lord was sycophantic to the very end of their conversation. Lee Shin Woo had acquired some information: he gave a regular report to the general once every month! Moreover, their conversation had ended without any mention of him, so as long as he stole the device that allowed the lord to communicate with the general, he would be able to clean everything up. \u0027Hoo...\u0027 Lee Shin Woo had a hunch that his plan could move on to the next stage. However, he didn\u0027t act immediately. \u0027I\u0027m going to aim for a time when I can kill the lord without any suspicion. What\u0027s most important is the aftermath... I have to focus on that first.\u0027 He patrolled through the inner city, and it wasn\u0027t only the lord or the magicians that he was keeping his eye on. Lee Shin Woo watched the undead who regularly visited the lord, as well as the lord himself, as he called them and gave them their orders... in other words, he watched how the undead within the city communicated with each other. The knights who were finished patrolling would have to report to the lord, so the lord wasn\u0027t left alone most of the time. There was a reason that this was a level 3 danger zone. \u0027But still, it\u0027s not like the lord\u0027s protected 24/7.\u0027 High leveled undead accept their death and move on. They accept the fact that they have died, and build a new life and order for themselves. Obviously, these undead, who\u0027ve accepted their deaths, are much scarier than those who roam around, rejecting that they\u0027ve died. Despite that, there was still one habit that they couldn\u0027t leave behind: sleep. Even though they know that they can\u0027t sleep, they lay on their beds in order to retain their sanity. The higher ranked the undead, the more likely they were to do so. \u0027And this lord is the same as well.\u0027 That time was now! The lord, who had activated the lock again and hidden the crystal, slowly walked outside. Lee Shin Woo acted as though he met him by coincidence as he passed by the area, and calmly bowed his head. \"My lord.\" [Good work, Sir Seta.] \"This level of work is nothing if I can help uphold the imperial command.\" [Mm, very impressive. I\u0027ll call you later separately and reward you.] He responded, called over one of the knights nearby on standby, and went towards a different room. It was the room where the level 6 Magician Leader was staying in; it seemed as though these two were lovers before they died who always slept in the same place. There was no way to tell if these two still were sexually active, but Lee Shin Woo prayed that they weren\u0027t. \u0027Nice. Then let\u0027s see where they\u0027re going.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo saw the two join up and head to the bedroom, and naturally entered into the room the lord had once inhabited. He\u0027d already perfectly memorized the patrol routes for the inner city, and knew that there wouldn\u0027t be anyone guarding the lord\u0027s room for 7 minutes. [Code 0819 Communication Line] [A high rank communication line that enables communication by using a special frequency.] \"Nice. Now I won\u0027t encounter one of the 12 generals through this.\" He unlocked the extremely simple lock and had extracted the communication line that had been hidden in the room. After Lee Shin Woo had placed it into his inventory, he comfortably escaped the room. And realizing that he had time to spare, grinned, and went towards the lord\u0027s bedroom.
