Heaven Defying General - 3\u003e\n [Ethan Cruz: I think I\u0027ve found a target.]\n While he and his troops were crossing through the level 3 danger zone, Lee Shin Woo accessed the chatting channel. There, Lee Shin Woo heard what he\u0027d been somewhat prepared to hear.\n [Ethan Cruz: I had it narrowed down to a few candidates. It took a long time to find the one that can be lured in, but I\u0027ve finally found the right one.]\n [Prince Altania: As expected of you, Senior! But it\u0027s boring if it\u0027s too easy.]\n [Ethan Cruz: We\u0027re taking on one of the 12 generals. Even if he\u0027s the weakest of them, it\u0027s not going to be easy. If you\u0027re reckless, then you or I may die.]\n [Lloyd H.K.: ...I\u0027ve done a lot of prep. I\u0027ve also steeled myself. I think it\u0027s time we reveal ourselves (the heroes) to the Empire.]\n The heroes in the chatting channel were getting fired up by Ethan\u0027s declaration. However, not everyone thought favorably of his idea.\n [Seira Von Retadane: Do you really intend on facing one of the 12 generals? They\u0027re not like normal undead. They\u0027re highly intelligent and cooperate with each other. It won\u0027t go as smoothly as you think.]\n [Yasunori Akira: No matter how I think about it, it\u0027s too early. I don\u0027t think those who\u0027ve just become level 7 will be able to properly use their strength.]\n [Ethan Cruz: Oh dear, I\u0027m not trying to force anyone to join me. But if you\u0027re that worried, all the more reason that you, as their seniors, should be participating, no?]\n How can this be? Seira Von Retadane and Yasunori Akira both plan on throwing away this opportunity? If that\u0027s the case, then that\u0027s more evidence that Ethan Cruz is allied with the Empire! No, if he really was allied with the Empire, then there was a chance that he would lead not one, but two of the twelve generals to them.\n \u0027And what if he brings the Archmage? Is he allied with him?\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo recollected how powerful Feotane Von Seldin was and clenched his fist. He couldn\u0027t beat him right now. It was impossible.\n It was impossible, but... At the very least, he might have a few ways to make him retreat. Yeah, perhaps it was time to try \u0027that\u0027.\n [Seira Von Retadane: Are you serious? ...I don\u0027t want to lower morale, but please remember what happened in the past. Seven level 7 heroes joined together, but still died. At that time, you, at level 6, were the only one who survived. Ethan Cruz, have you already forgotten?]\n While he was formulating complex plans in his head, those opposed to Ethan Cruz\u0027s plan were beginning to give clear reasons for why his plan wouldn\u0027t work.\n Was Seira Von Retadane referring to the group of heroes (that included Lee Man Bok) that attempted to take down the 12 generals? As expected, it seems like she didn\u0027t participate in that expedition. Then again, if she had, then she would\u0027ve known the horrors that Ethan had unleashed. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and Ethan Cruz replied.\n [Ethan Cruz: Of course I remember. That was a huge failure.]\n \u0027Of course it was a huge failure. After all, he\u0027d lost Lee Man Bok, as well as the two Giants,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo thought.\n [Ethan Cruz: That\u0027s why I\u0027ve prepared so much more. I really did my best after that. To the point that I could probably take on one of the 12 generals by myself. It\u0027s because I\u0027m so sure of that that I want to take down one of them with my juniors.]\n Well, of course, he was that strong. If he wasn\u0027t, then he wouldn\u0027t be able to control the other heroes. After all, he\u0027d lost some undead heroes in the past because of his weakness.\n [Ethan Cruz: You know that God\u0027s blessing won\u0027t last forever, right? We have to purify the Empire before then. If not, then... do you not want to take down one of the 12 generals?]\n [Seira Von Retadane: What are you saying?]\n [Ethan Cruz: You already know, don\u0027t you? Retadane.]\n [Yasunori Akira: Hey, are you doubting an ally right now? Stop. I listened quietly, but you went too far.]\n [Ethan Cruz: No, I just wanted to hear the truth from her.]\n As expected, they were definitely talking about Seagald Von Retadane of the 12 generals. Considering the mood in the chatting channel, half of the heroes knew about Seagald, and the other half didn\u0027t. Lee Shin Woo supposed this was proof that his seniors hadn\u0027t been just playing around thus far.\n That was a topic that should\u0027ve been difficult to ask her about, so Ethan Cruz was definitely taunting her. So in other words, did that mean he was confident that he could overpower Seira Von Retadane?\n [Seira Von Retadane: ...I want to destroy the undead more than anyone else. Whether it be the 12 generals, the Emperor, or anyone. Regardless of what name they held in the past, or what person they were, so long as they\u0027re undead... I\u0027ll purify them all.]\n She was just talking in the chatting channel, yet Lee Shin Woo felt goosebumps. Was this what Lee Man Bok was telling him to be cautious of, her hatred of the undead? Now he could understand what he was warning him about.\n [Seira Von Retadane: I suppose your cheap taunt worked. Since I don\u0027t want a repeat of the past. I must stop precious heroes from degenerating into such a cursed form.]\n [Ethan Cruz: You made the right choice. I have high hopes for your power over light.]\n Could Seira Von Retadane use light magic? Lee Shin Woo decided to stow that away for later. Their powers should clash against each other, so the fact that Ethan was willing to taunt her and bring her into this meant that he was just that confident. ...If not, then perhaps he wanted to use this opportunity to take her down, as she was a bothersome opponent.\n \u0027Seira Von Retadane. She\u0027s diligently doing her duty as a hero, so I\u0027d like to keep her alive if at all possible...\u0027\n Lee Man Bok warned him that he should avoid her at all cost, but that was way too half-hearted for him. To defeat the Empire, he needed to even use his greatest enemy. Even more so if she were someone who hated the undead to that extent.\n [Ethan Cruz: Akira, what about you?]\n [Yasunori Akira: Don\u0027t talk so casually. It makes me sick. If you really did pick a safe target, then me not going won\u0027t make much of a difference.]\n [Ethan Cruz: You\u0027ll regret it. Our super rookie, Lee Shin Woo, are you almost ready?]\n [Lee Shin Woo: Yes, Senior. I\u0027m making sure I\u0027m prepared, especially for any unforeseen situations.]\n He was preparing a plan for if Ethan Cruz went onto the frontlines personally, when he didn\u0027t, when his undead grouped together, when he moved stealthily when there were one or two of the 12 generals, or if the Archmage himself appeared!\n [Ethan Cruz: You\u0027re so reliable. As expected of our super rookie!]\n \u0027That reliable super rookie is coming to put a sword in your gut,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo smiled and inwardly muttered.\n But then, he suddenly got two requests for private chats. They were from both Seira Von Retadane and Yasunori Akira! Lee Shin Woo was flustered and sent a message asking Seira to wait just a second. He accepted Yasunori Akira\u0027s private chat first because he thought he would be easier to deal with.\n [Yasunori Akira: This might sound a little weird, but listen carefully. Can you promise me that?]\n \"Of course, Senior Yasunori.\"\n [Yasunori Akira: I plan on hiding while you guys are fighting against one of the 12 generals.]\n \"What are you talking about... Are you trying to protect me?\"\n [Yasunori Akira: Yeah. I want to protect you guys. ...But not from one of the 12 generals. From Ethan Cruz.]\n Everyone, there\u0027s a hero as reliable as Kratia over here! Lee Shin Woo was touched, as he\u0027d found another hero that tried their best for endless growth and glory!\n [Yasunori Akira: It might sound weird, but I thought it\u0027d be ok to tell you since you haven\u0027t met Ethan yet. Those who meet him, even just once... follow him a bit blindly.]\n Lee Shin Woo thought that was most likely due to Ethan Cruz\u0027s darkness magic, but he didn\u0027t voice it.\n [Yasunori Akira: That\u0027s already strange. Even if he were blessed to have so many people willing to help him, it\u0027s still too unnatural. Moreover, this hunt for one of the 12 generals... it\u0027s way too dangerous. Since it\u0027s almost impossible to bait one of the 12 generals.]\n In the past, Lee Shin Woo had infiltrated a city and had successfully led Hansen Von Dorthe there, but he acted as if it had never happened before.\n [Yasunori Akira: Be wary of him. Don\u0027t get too close. Especially... his buffs. Make sure you reject his buffs. Even if he gives you a good reason, make sure you refuse them. Don\u0027t let yourself get touched by his magic.]\n \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\"\n [Yasunori Akira: Do you believe me?]\n \"How could I not believe you, as you\u0027re acting out of concern for me? You\u0027re not telling me to attack him. You\u0027re just telling me to refuse his buffs.\"\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Acting skill was really paying off. Yasunori Akira was slightly touched by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s sincerity.\n [Yasunori Akira: ...I thought you were only good at fighting, but you\u0027re a smooth talker too. But it makes me feel better if you think like that. Who is that again? That hero you were close to... can you tell her about my request too?]\n \"Yes, of course. I\u0027ll remember to be careful around him.\"\n [Yasunori Akira: I\u0027ll mark you off. I wish everyone was as careful as you, but... if we all make it out of this safely, let\u0027s hunt together.]\n \"I\u0027ll be looking forward to it.\"\n He\u0027s going to mark him off personally. If that\u0027s the case, then it\u0027s likely that Yasunori Akira was in the most danger... Lee Shin Woo thanked him for his warning, but before he left the chat, he warned Yasunori Akira about the curse that came from Deadly Force. Yasunori was surprised but said he understood.\n Now, it was Seira Von Retadane’s turn now. Lee Shin Woo took a deep breath and accepted a private chat with her.\n [Seira Von Retadane: I heard you became level 7. You were afraid you\u0027d stick out, so you hid your level.]\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Senior. I know I shouldn\u0027t be lying to you, but I was afraid of you (seniors) pinning all your hopes on me...\"\n [Seira Von Retadane: I understand. Since you must\u0027ve been exceptionally talented in your original world. As they say, \u0027Tall trees catch much wind\u0027. [1] It must\u0027ve been suffocating.]\n \"Senior...\"\n He acted as though he were touched by her kindness. Lee Shin Woo said pretty much what he\u0027d expected her to say.\n [Seira Von Retadane: Please be careful of Ethan Cruz. On that day, the day that the heroes were wiped out... Why was he the only one that came back alive? I find it quite odd. Perhaps he\u0027s connected with the Empire.]\n He\u0027d gotten another reliable senior.\n [Seira Von Retadane: I\u0027d rather not even think of that as a possibility, but if he\u0027s really a traitor, then... we have to take him down no matter what. Since an enemy on the inside is more threatening than the 12 generals.]\n \"Senior Yasunori said the same thing.\"\n [Seira Von Retadane: Yasunori Akira did? That\u0027s a relief. Now that I think about it, he\u0027s never met Ethan in person. He\u0027s benefitting from his caution.]\n \"Of course, I\u0027ll be sure to be careful. Thank you for the advice.\"\n He thought she had said everything she was going to say, but then, she dropped a bombshell.\n [Seira Von Retadane: It can\u0027t be helped. Let\u0027s meet up before you see him. I\u0027ll contact Yasunori Akira as well. Ah, please come with the hero you\u0027re on good terms with too.]\n \"...I\u0027m sorry?\"\n [Seira Von Retadane: I want you to meet me before you\u0027re exposed to his magic. I\u0027d also like to formulate a plan on site as well.]\n He was doing fine on his own, but she had suddenly offered to meet! \n Lee Shin Woo looked miserable, as it was like he was drafted into a team meeting for a presentation for a huge client.\n [Paul Zero, we have arrived at the city!]\n [Apparently, the second corps has arrived at the opposite city! How about attacking before our enemies have a chance to react!?]\n Then, the frontline Giants, who were unaware of how he was feeling, yelled. Lee Shin Woo saw the huge city in front of him and yelled, putting all of his stress from the chatting channel into it.\n \"Break everything and trample over them! Break them into pieces, so that no one can even identify who killed them!\"\n \n \n [1] T/N: If you stand out from the crowd, then you draw attention to yourself.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-171","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
