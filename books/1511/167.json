The Eater, Metafel, had set his sights on the core and rushed towards it, whereas the elites couldn\u0027t back off, so long as Lee Shin Woo was behind them.\\n\\n [We have to avoid a direct confrontation. We have to be especially wary of those tongues. Each and every one of them has a High Rank Paralysis ability. He has all the abilities that help him eat his prey...!]\\n\\n [This asshole\u0027s really tough... Shino!]\\n\\n [Heup!]\\n\\n Shino stepped forward, as the one least worried about self-preservation.\\n\\n He was aware of his limitations as a level 6, and the only skill that could overcome those limits and damage Metafel was... funnily enough, a skill called Titan Punch; he focused everything into that Titan Punch.\\n\\n Once he used the skill, he wouldn\u0027t be able to move for quite a long time, but because he was fighting against the target of his revenge, Metafel, the damage dealt would be amplified, so it was definitely a skill capable of inflicting a severe injury!\\n\\n [Kuhaaaaaahk!]\\n\\n [Now! Open wide. Eat ice and dirt!]\\n\\n Shino was responsible for the offense, while the Giants were entirely responsible for defense. They wouldn\u0027t let Metafel advance even a single step!\\n\\n Especially since Ellata possessed the ability to control the earth as she pleased; Metafel, whose entire body had become a giant mouth, opened wide. But because the Giants pelted him with ice and dirt, Metafel could neither attack nor advance. It was the best skill to have against Metafel.\\n\\n [Kuwaaaah!]\\n\\n [Damn it!]\\n\\n However, Metafel soon familiarized himself with her attack pattern. Metafel continuously drew in both ice and dirt, and at some point, threw it back out at Ellata!\\n\\n Moreover, his saliva was mixed in, which contained a powerful acid, as well as a paralysis ability, so it was quite the attack. Ellata quickly formed a dirt wall and blocked Metafel\u0027s counter, but Metafel\u0027s attack was much too strong, and her wall broke soon after.\\n\\n [Keuk!]\\n\\n [This dirty bastard is really...]\\n\\n [Hoo, I\u0027m going!]\\n\\n Right when Ellata was about to be hit by Metafel\u0027s vomit, intense flames rose up into the air and burned Metafel\u0027s attack. It was none other than Chi Paul\u0027s ability.\\n\\n [This is the power of the flames that Master gave me!]\\n\\n The surging mana throughout his entire body turned into flames, and he shot them out at Metafel, halting his advance. Metafel pressed forward as if to eat those flames as well, but fortunately, it seemed like Metafel wasn\u0027t very compatible with elemental power!\\n\\n Perhaps the reason Kratia had been able to stop his evolution for so long was because of the negative effect of his karma? Metafel hadn\u0027t been able to completely absorb the fire, as the fire burst within his stomach, causing internal damage.\\n\\n [How troublesome! I\u0027ll roast and eat you all!]\\n\\n [You\u0027ll be cooked before you get the chance!]\\n\\n The flames were hot enough (due to him being a level 7 elite) that they left deep marks on his body, but Metafel\u0027s body was ridiculously large.\\n\\n Though burned by the flames, Metafel continued to advance. Bisher Moon also rushed over, and with his sharp nails severed Metafel\u0027s tongues without pause.\\n\\n [Damn it. I cut and I cut, but there\u0027s no end to them. Moreover, it feels like my body is melting away just by getting close...! So this is a level 8!]\\n\\n [Don\u0027t falter. There\u0027s nowhere left to retreat!]\\n\\n [Tch... Kuhaaaaaaahk!]\\n\\n Ultimately, Bisher wrapped his body in darkness. Bisher had been saving his mana, but decided that now was the time to use it; the moment he released all that mana, Bisher became one with his clan\u0027s symbol, the very moon which didn\u0027t exist in the Empire.\\n\\n That miraculous connection caused Bisher\u0027s arms to become hotter, and his nails to become longer.\\n\\n [I didn\u0027t... come back to be devoured by this two-bit beast!]\\n\\n As the mana consumption was severe, he couldn\u0027t maintain the skill for very long, but if he didn\u0027t use it now, he wouldn\u0027t have a chance to use it. All ten of his fingernails were as sharp as the finest blade, and he swung them forward. Even a level 8\u0027s body would be cut by them!\\n\\n [Kuooooooht!]\\n\\n [I\u0027ll cut everything on you!]\\n\\n Chi Paul and Bisher Moon fought hard, causing Metafel to continue to accrue injuries. While they kept him busy, Shino Rendu let out another powerful attack, causing Metafel to retreat a few steps back.\\n\\n [You bastarrrrrrrds!]\\n\\n He wanted to eat the Giants, as well as that fragrant mana beyond them! But because he was prevented from doing so numerous times by the elites, his desire continued to swell until it reached a peak.\\n\\n At that moment, his body cracked, and deep black tongues burst out between those cracks. Anything that comprised ‘Metafel’, whether it be his bones, his blood vessels, his muscles, or even his skin was optimized for \u0027eating\u0027.\\n\\n [Kuhaat!]\\n\\n [Keuk!?]\\n\\n One who reaches level 8 forces mana to assimilate with them. Anyone who comes within their \u0027turf\u0027 would weaken, and this ability could even incapacitate their opponents as well.\\n\\n Metafel instinctively raised his ability to its very limit and dyed the surrounding mana with his \u0027Eater\u0027 karma. The characteristics of the eater karma had been injected into the dominated mana.\\n\\n [I can\u0027t move...!]\\n\\n [The magic!]\\n\\n They felt it as Metafel was sucking in the ambient mana. It was quite shudder-inducing, but contrary to one might think it was only the preparation that came before the actual eating.\\n\\n [Kuhaa...]\\n\\n Metafel took a step forward. The moment he assimilated the mana, his body broke down, but in its place, countless tongues took their place; now his body was entirely composed of tongues. Bones and tongues, skin and tongues, blood and tongues, muscles and tongues... Metafel\u0027s body overflowed with tongues, as if ready to eat each and every one of them.\\n\\n [Eat... I\u0027ll eat you all!]\\n\\n [Kaha!]\\n\\n [Kiik!?]\\n\\n However, the moment he was about to begin eating, Arogan, who was able to resist the mana eating, rushed forward and attacked Metafel by himself. Metafel stretched out his tongues in order to eat not only him, but the others as well, but Arogan desperately grabbed all of them and pulled.\\n\\n [Where do you think... Kuaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n [Keuk, you troublesome bastard!]\\n\\n Arogan\u0027s ability as a hero was \u0027taunt\u0027. That miraculous ability would draw his opponent\u0027s attention, actions, and even magic towards him.\\n\\n It was an ability that would allow him to be a shield for his party, and that\u0027s how he had lived his life as well. And by taunting one last time, he had decided to sacrifice his life to save the rest of his party!\\n\\n [Arogan!]\\n\\n [I\u0027ve already lost an arm. It\u0027s better that I sacrifice myself, Ellata! Survive until the very end and stay by the Titan\u0027s side!]\\n\\n Although Arogan had bought enough time for her to retreat, she not only didn\u0027t retreat, but attempted to save him as well, so Arogan yelled firmly. He activated his skill to its limit, drawing all of Metafel\u0027s tongues towards him. It was to the point that his body was no longer visible.\\n\\n [Keuk. Urgh...!]\\n\\n [Arogaaaaan!]\\n\\n In the end, they were unable to see Arogan. Through his sacrifice, Bisher, Chi Paul, and Shino Rendu were barely able to retreat and gasped (though they really couldn\u0027t). They kept their eyes on Metafel, but Ellata, unable to contain her fury, struck the ground with her hands, encasing her hands in dirt and ice mixed gloves. Then, she charged at Metafel.\\n\\n [Give me back my comrade, you monster!]\\n\\n Maybe it was just her, but it felt like her body was overflowing with power. She was sure that it was because of her anger and believed it to be so. However...\\n\\n [Kuhaaaaaaaahk!]\\n\\n Metafel screamed before she could land a hit. Did her intent strike first before her body? Ellata fists shook in surprise, and a portion of Metafel\u0027s body (which had become a mass of tongues) burst.\\n\\n [Huaaaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n A Giant\u0027s roar resounded throughout the area. It wasn\u0027t Ellata. It was none other than Arogan!\\n\\n [Lv7 Bone Titan Knight - Arogan]\\n\\n Ellata\u0027s eyes widened when she saw Arogan tear through a portion of Metafel\u0027s body and come out. Arogan had been reborn; his once rotten flesh had been replaced by tough jet-black bones that went from head to toe.\\n\\n [Titan! Oh Titan!]\\n\\n [Oh, ooooh...]\\n\\n He\u0027d lost all his flesh, but that didn\u0027t mean he was weaker. On the contrary, the essence of his karma had enriched his bones and had made him even stronger... Plus, his lost arm had been restored in bone form.\\n\\n Honestly, there was a world of difference in his power compared to before he had been swallowed by Metafel!\\n\\n [You\u0027re the same, Ellata!]\\n\\n [Is that so...!?]\\n\\n [Kuaaaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n Metafel screamed in acute pain and shot out his tongues at Arogan! However, Arogan stretched out his jet black arm and blocked the tongues.\\n\\n [Kuuuuuu! Ellata!]\\n\\n [Kihiaaaah!]\\n\\n Of course, there was still a clear level disparity. He was still weaker in terms of pure strength, and his reinforced bones would still melt.\\n\\n However, he could endure it. He could fight him head-on. Seeing that, Ellata felt something inside of her, some core part of her was sublimating into something greater. Then, she realized.\\n\\n \u0027The Titan has returned.\u0027\\n\\n They\u0027d already heard that the Titan\u0027s strength would not last forever. They\u0027d also heard that the Titan\u0027s appearance might not be as they imagined. However, the Titan Tribe had prayed and wished for the Titan\u0027s return for hundreds of years, and those prayers themselves became a mass of karma, amassing within the Giants\u0027 minds and bodies.\\n\\n And when the Titan walked upon the grounds of Heita once more, they would be able to accept that karma! That karma was only for them, and would entrust them with the Titan\u0027s Pride!\\n\\n [Huooooooooh!]\\n\\n Just like Arogan, Ellata roared and her body began to change. Because she hadn\u0027t lost her flesh, there was another evolution available to her, aside from Bone Titan. Her body lessened to about 2 meters, but in exchange, not only did her muscles and bones become tougher but her once dead blood had been replaced by pure mana blood vessels.\\n\\n Her rotten equipment broke apart, just like her once rotten body, and her bare body was covered in red bone armor. All of the karma she had amassed in her life (Perium) sublimated into a greater form: her armor.\\n\\n [Lv7 Titan Armored Knight - Ellata]\\n\\n She was repaid for the karma she\u0027d amassed for so many years, but she wasn\u0027t the only one that had changed, now was she? The Giants, who were hidden deep with their territory, couldn\u0027t endure the surging power and they all roared and came out of hiding. Right now, they were all being reborn as new elites!\\n\\n [Lv6 Elite Titan Knight]\\n\\n [Lv6 Elite Titan Rider]\\n\\n [Lv5 Elite Titan Soldier]\\n\\n Hundreds of Giants overflowed with new strength and new mana. The heat caused the ice, which hadn\u0027t melted for dozens of years, to melt and flow into currents of water, and even that water soon evaporated.\\n\\n The ground was exposed. The earth that had been hidden for so many years along with the Titan\u0027s Heart was so pure and clean as if blessing the Giants.\\n\\n \"Oh...\"\\n\\n Jin, who had been freed of lugging Lee Shin Woo around for a change, saw the Giants as they roared from all directions and could only say one thing.\\n\\n \"I feel like it\u0027d be a cinch if we fought Ethan Cruz now...\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be careless. But against Metafel, yeah, we won by a landslide.\"\\n\\n Kratia, who\u0027d finished with the intense manufacturing and had obtained the fruits of her labor, wiped her forehead proudly. Creating this golem had significantly increased her skill level in artifact manufacturing, so she couldn\u0027t help but be happy. However, what made her even more happy was...\\n\\n \"Go get him, Titan.\"\\n\\n The fact that she\u0027d brought back a legend with her very own hands.\\n\\n [Yeah.]\\n\\n The Titan, Lee Shin Woo replied.\\n\\n The Titan, which had returned in the form of red bones, took a step forward. \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-167","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
