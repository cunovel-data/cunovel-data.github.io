Heaven Defying General\u0027s Stage - 1\u003e Lee Shin Woo first followed the golems\u0027 presence. If he wanted everything to go as planned, then he\u0027d need to make contact with them first. He and his party had run through the city without stopping, and he\u0027d roughly recorded info on the city, which made it easier to use his Wild Card skill. Lee Shin Woo and Jin, who melted into the city\u0027s darkness, resembled shadows as they ran with such speed and secrecy. But Jin, who was running at full speed, wasn\u0027t feeling very good. \"I know it\u0027s assimilation, but it\u0027s strange because it feels like I\u0027m stuck to the ground...\" \"We have no choice. Your light-speed sprint is way too conspicuous.\" \"Ugh. Damn it.\" They quickly found their objective. Lee Shin Woo and Jin had met him a few times before; the elite level 7 golem, Guillotine Steelworker, was leading many level 6 golems in breaking through the traps. They were blazing a trail through the minefield so to speak, using their bodies as a sacrifice. [Be strong. We\u0027re slowly getting closer to our destination.] [Yes, sir!] [Some of the traps we haven\u0027t set off keep summoning spirits and monsters... Huh!? Who is it!?] Lee Shin Woo and Jin hid within the building\u0027s side post, but when the time was right, he released his Assimilation with the darkness and came forward. Guillotine, who hadn\u0027t been able to sense him before he exposed himself, was shocked and pointed his spear at him. A level 7 elite just wasn\u0027t enough to threaten him anymore. \"What did you come here for, Golem?\" [Y-You are...!?] Guillotine glared at him. Did he recall Lee Shin Woo\u0027s black armor (while hiding within the shadows, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s armor was replaced with the element) and the imposing horse he was riding? He exerted even more pressure into the spear. [Paul Zero, were you the Heaven Defying General...?] \"A lot of you called me that.\" Lee Shin Woo confidently nodded his head. He\u0027d introduced himself as Paul Zero in front of Arema Steelworker and Guillotine in the past, but they wouldn\u0027t think that he was the same undead as before. After all, his growth rate was astounding, even to him. [You\u0027ve finally shown your true colors...! There was a lot I wanted to ask you. To think you\u0027d use your subordinate to spy on us and expose us to the imperial army!] \"Oh.\" Lee Shin Woo briefly looked through his memories and as though he\u0027d remembered, soon replied in a sluggish voice. \"Now that you mention it, that did happen. Yeah, it did. I ordered my subordinate to do that. So how about it? Did you get into contact with Anti-Skull after that? Considering how they\u0027re here too, it seems like you\u0027ve gotten quite friendly with each other.\" [You bastard...!] That\u0027s right. In the past, before he\u0027d fought against the Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe, he\u0027d first impersonated Kadinan\u0027s (satellite city) lord, Nellopa, and had sent a false report that \u0027The Golden General, Arema Steelworker and Seagald Von Retadane\u0027s Anti-Skull had joined forces and were attacking the city\u0027. Following that event, the imperial army became wary of both Arema Steelworker and Anti-Skull, forcing the golems and Anti-Skull out of hiding. It seemed like Guillotine was under the impression that Lee Shin Woo had ordered a subordinate to carry out his plan under his name, but unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo had executed the plan himself. [Who do you work for? How can you, a mere undead, do such a thing!?] \"I\u0027m sick of questions like that. I don\u0027t work for anyone. I just do what I want. Unlike you guys, who\u0027re just the Magic Emperor\u0027s faithful hunting dogs.\" [...!] \"So how long do I have to wait here before Arema Steelworker arrives? If you want to keep me here, then say something more exciting.\" Guillotine Steelworker was speechless. Lee Shin Woo was exaggerating a yawn, and Guillotine kept opening and closing his mouth, but he eventually managed to say something. [You. Did you know from the very beginning...? What are you planning!?] \"Planning? Don\u0027t say something so sad. I just don\u0027t want to lose your forces for nothing. You\u0027ve already expended some of your forces getting through these traps. A good general values his soldiers\u0027 lives. Am I wrong?\" \u0027How are you so good at cutting down a person\u0027s self-confidence?\u0027 \u0027Hey, the way you said \u0027so good\u0027 sounded a bit weird?\u0027 While Lee Shin Woo and Jin communicated via telepathy, Guillotine\u0027s body shook. \u0027A golem can shake when they become level 7?â€™, Lee Shin Woo asked, only to notice Guillotine\u0027s shaking starting to intensify. Lee Shin Woo was shocked. [You\u0027ll regret it...! Our Lord will soon be here with the remainder of the Four Heavenly Commanders. I know how strong you are, but we\u0027ll see how relaxed you are after they come...!] \"Oh man, I\u0027m so scared. No matter how strong I am, I have no plans on fighting the level 8 Golden General.\" [Do you want to talk? It\u0027s already too late. By becoming an undead, it seems that in exchange for your strength, your brain\u0027s rotted away. It\u0027s too late to feel regret...] [Guillotine, are you alright?] [My lord!] In the midst of Lee Shin Woo playing around with Guillotine, several golems rushed onto the premises, accompanied by powerful energy being shot towards Lee Shin Woo. While its power was significantly reduced due to the countless traps nearby, it was still a concentrated blast of a level 8\u0027s mana, so it was enough to cause Lee Shin Woo to worry. [...A shield?] But the energy he\u0027d shot out (it was probably metal element mana) was blocked by a shield that came out of nowhere, causing it to vanish. \"Did you really think I wouldn\u0027t be prepared when I\u0027ve come all this way to meet the Golden General?\" [Ugh...] The shield was the level 7 Titan\u0027s Fortress and was one of the 17 weapons that Lee Shin Woo had summoned and fully charged. Seeing that, Arema Steelworker was shocked. Lee Shin Woo saw him take a step back and nodded his head. With just one move, Arema Steelworker had realized that Lee Shin Woo was level 8. Though Lee Shin Woo could perform such a move when he was level 7 as well! [The Heaven Defying General... I have heard of you. A hidden dragon that appeared just recently. I didn\u0027t think we\u0027d meet like this.] \"I\u0027ve met you once before. Don\u0027t you remember?\" [You mean that subordinate of yours. He had potential. I see that he takes after his master in terms of guts and talent.] Even if he told him that he was Paul Zero, it was unlikely that Arema Steelworker would believe him. Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and decided to make the first move. \"So why are you here? Is this what the Magic Emperor wants?\" [So you know. You must have come from the surface as well.] Lee Shin Woo could feel an invisible pressure tightening around him on all sides. When one becomes level 8, they gain the ability to influence the mana around them and control it; a type of authority. Perhaps because it originated from a golem, the ambient mana took on a metallic property that smelled of blood. It seemed to be a derivative of the earth element, much like the wood element, but it seemed more independent from the source... perhaps it was a specialized element that could only be obtained when one becomes a golem. When he had last felt Arema Steelworker\u0027s strength, he had tried his best to act unfazed, but now, he wasn\u0027t the least bit affected. He could match that pressure... No, he could go even further beyond it. To him, he saw Arema Steelworker\u0027s action as just a waste of mana. [I don\u0027t know how much you know... or who you\u0027re working for. But what I am sure of is that you\u0027re a threat to my master. You wanted something, so you came all the way here, but... It\u0027s quite unfortunate. I\u0027ll kill you where you stand.] Arema Steelworker gathered a tremendous amount of energy into his fist. According to his calculations, Arema Steelworker was using the metal element mana to temporarily increase his durability and reinforce himself as well. It was as though he was making his body into the most powerful weapon. The Four Heavenly Commanders behind him exerted incredible strength as well. At this rate, he would have to fight against them. Since he really didn\u0027t want to fight them, he quickly took out the \u0027Anti-Arema Steelworker\u0027 weapon he\u0027d brought from the surface. [!?] At that moment, Arema Steelworker sounded as though he\u0027d caught a bug of some sort and stood still. The tremendous mana that he\u0027d gathered was released and gently disappeared amongst the mass of golems. The other golems were the same. They rubbed their eyes, as if they couldn\u0027t believe what was happening, blinked, or even tapped their heads to confirm that what was happening was real. However, it didn\u0027t change anything. [T-That...] Arema Steelworker\u0027s voice quivered. The Golden General that had been so imposing when they\u0027d first met was no longer here. He was acting like a cowardly middle-schooler who had just been caught writing a poem at the corner of their notes about their first love! [That... How... How do you have that? How the hell do you have that!?] \"I wonder. Why don\u0027t you use your brain? If not... Then why don\u0027t we ask the servants of the Steelworker family?\" [You bastard, Paul Zero...! Paul Zero...!] \"Ah, that\u0027s right.\" Lee Shin Woo sounded regretful as if he\u0027d just remembered something. \"If you return to the surface like that, your servants might run away in fear. Isn\u0027t that right?\" [You bastard... You bastard...! I\u0027ll kill you. I\u0027ll kill you!] \"Go ahead and try.\" Arema Steelworker\u0027s body shook and then went \u0027thud\u0027. He took a step forward and raised his hand, but Lee Shin Woo extended the \u0027ultimate weapon\u0027 and he stopped once more. This was so fun. [Why is the lord... Why? How?] \"Ah, I have yours too, so don\u0027t feel left out. Yours were broken up, but the security was all the same. It wasn\u0027t such a good idea to record it in the golem network, now was it?\" [The information hidden on the golem network is only accessible by myself and His Majesty...! There\u0027s absolutely no way that an outsider can access it!] \"Ta-dah! There\u0027s no such thing as an \u0027absolute\u0027 in this world!\" Lee Shin Woo smiled sweetly. Whenever he used the ultimate weapon, Arema Steelworker would flinch. If he could, he would play around a little bit longer, but even now, Anti-Skull and the imperial army were coming to the city. He needed to negotiate with them if he wanted the time that Chi Paul and his forces had bought him to not go to waste. \"Now, Golden General. Are you willing to hear me out now?\" [You... I want to kill you, but...!] His words (that of a level 8 golem) were so frightening that it almost seemed like he would be cursed, but Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t pay it any mind. Soon, he heard exactly what he wanted to hear. [I\u0027ll hear... what you have to say...!] \"Hoo. We can finally talk. What a joyous occasion.\" [But promise me that you\u0027ll give it back...! Me and my subordinates precious \u0027bodies\u0027...!] \"Oh, but of course. If you do exactly as I say, that is.\" Lee Shin Woo sounded so sure of himself that only Jin could think that \u0027Ah, this asshole\u0027s lying again...!\u0027. He replied and shook Arema Steelworker\u0027s level 8 human body. That\u0027s right. When Arema Steelworker had left the surface and had placed himself into a golem, he had left his physical body in his family\u0027s safe house, so that he could one day return to his original body. ...And once he\u0027d figured that out, Lee Shin Woo had snatched their bodies in order to use them as his \u0027ultimate weapon\u0027 against them!
