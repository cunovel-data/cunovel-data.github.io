The Final Stage - 1\u003e Lee Shin Woo had forgotten something: absorbing the Archmage\u0027s bone. Once he\u0027d brought Erian and Lloyd to his base, he immediately absorbed the bone. [Absorbing the Lv8 Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin\u0027s Parietal Bone. Magic has increased by 120.] [You have learned the innate element, Beginner Dark Space Lv5. Magic has increased by 50.] His expectations must\u0027ve been too high; though he\u0027d absorbed an Archmage\u0027s bone, his magic had only increased by 120. Moreover, Lee Shin Woo hoped that by absorbing the bone, he would master the Lv9 High Rank Mana Bone or Mana Acceleration skills. The skills had certainly grown, but he wasn\u0027t able to master them. \u0027More useless memories. Though just learning his spatial magic is huge for me. ...Ugh. His magic seemed so complex and developed, yet it\u0027s still in the realm of enlightenment and elements. But wait a second. Why is this...?\u0027 Lee Shin Woo tested the Dark Space element and tilted his head at the mysterious feeling. It was almost like this feeling was familiar. An absolute ability that linked two spaces through the power of the darkness element. Yeah, this ability was similar to one of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s abilities...! However, that ability was in the form of an artifact. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t understand the inner workings of the ability on his own, but by learning the Dark Space element, he would just gain the Heaven Door Key\u0027s power through his intuition! [Dark Space and the Heaven Door\u0027s Key are resonating. You can now absorb the Heaven Door\u0027s Key through Bone Reinforcement.] Lee Shin Woo widened his eyes. That\u0027s right. The Heaven Door\u0027s Key! When he\u0027d first gotten it, he couldn\u0027t absorb it, so he\u0027d given up on it. But he had found a way to absorb it now of all times! \"What if absorbing it causes it to change in some weird way?\" \"The Heaven Door\u0027s Key has a similar activation mechanism to Dark Space. At the very least, I\u0027ll be able to create a gate just like before, so don\u0027t worry.\" Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t worried about Bone Reinforcement\u0027s \u0027blast area\u0027 anymore. The artifact, the Heaven Door\u0027s Key reacted to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Dark Space and kept buzzing... Lee Shin Woo grabbed the Heaven Door\u0027s Key and briefly closed his eyes. He\u0027d activated Bone Reinforcement. [Absorbing the Heaven Door\u0027s Key through Bone Reinforcement. Magic has increased by 500.] [You have completely understood the fusion element, Dark Space, and the element is accepted by your karma. The unnecessary facets are removed, and the very essence of the element is strengthened. Dark Space has evolved into the new innate element, Heaven Space! The Beginner Heaven Space Element has become Lv10 and has evolved to the intermediate level. Magic has increased by 100.] The Dark Space element, strengthened by the Heaven Door\u0027s Key\u0027s power, evolved, gaining the ability to merge all elements together, not just darkness. He could not only use this element to transport himself, but others as well. Not only that, his spatial abilities had far exceeded the Lich\u0027s now! This wasn\u0027t just a transportation ability. The Heaven Space element could merge his other innate elements as well; in other words, he would be able to use all his elements simultaneously, which would increase his attack power significantly. \"Hoo. Game over, huh...\" \"Shin Woo! You\u0027re being really arrogant. It\u0027s your \u0027arrogance\u0027 passive!\" \"Ah, right. Thanks, Jin. Maybe I already have it as an active skill!?\" Jin\u0027s desperate dissuasion kept him from going off the deep end. Now that he thought about it, the Lich had quite the overpowered ability, but he had killed him anyway! Yeah. Though he\u0027d finally gained spatial magic, there were several people who could resist its effects. An innate element can only be stopped with another innate element. And all the people he\u0027d fight from now on should have innate elements. \u0027There\u0027s really no point in arguing over whose ability is better. I have to use this innate element\u0027s specialty to grasp my opponent\u0027s weaknesses... That\u0027s what\u0027s important.\u0027 Another point in his favor was that the Heaven Space element was really compatible with his Wild Card skill. The space element was, like Annihilation Flame, the best skill for him to go: \u0027I\u0027m here or maybe I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not here, or maybe I am?\u0027. Combining Heaven Space with either Annihilation Flame or Dark Shadow... the possibilities were endless. He already had a few ideas... He should get a chance to try them out in the field soon. If he used them in tandem with Wild Card, then an equally leveled opponent, or even a higher leveled opponent, wouldn\u0027t be able to easily notice him. \"Yeah. I guess you could say that I\u0027ve only just assembled all the pieces...\" \"All the pieces?\" \"Yeah. Our goal is to attain victory with the least amount of casualties possible. But we had one problem before: that we didn\u0027t have anyone as strong as the Magic and Undead Emperors...\" \"And that\u0027s also why you were so hell-bent on upgrading the Titan.\" \"Yep. But the Titan can only be used for a short period of time. If something happened (an emergency), there would be nothing I could do. But now... I think I can take them on with this.\" Lee Shin Woo was a coward. So if he looked really confident, then it could only be for two reasons. First, when there was a clear-cut retreat path, and second, when there wasn\u0027t a clear-cut retreat path. Whether he was safe, or whether he was sure to die, there was no reason to worry about both of them. And right now, he was closer to the former. Moreover, having gained Heaven Space had caused his stats to be... \u002725,323, huh...\u0027 Level 9 required one\u0027s stats to be a total of 25,600. He could reach level 9 with just 277 more stats. If everything went well, he might be able to level up mid-fight. And if he reached level 9, then he\u0027d be on equal footing with those damn Emperors! \u0027Even I\u0027m a bit shocked.\u0027 To think that he, who had only been here for 2 years, would be on equal footing with the two level 9 Emperors that had ruled for hundreds of years. Even he couldn\u0027t have imagined this when he had asked God for a growth-type ability. It was only possible by taking everything that they\u0027d built, but it also wouldn\u0027t have been possible without his Joker karma. The Joker. There was nothing better to describe him. It didn\u0027t just accurately represent his ability, but his position in the world as well. \"Shin Woo!\" Right then, the door swung open and Kratia rushed into the room. She held a small bead within her tiny hands... a small bead that was encased in bone, which resembled a shell of some sort. \"The Titan Core\u0027s ready. The energy\u0027s fully charged too. Not only can you transform whenever you want, but...I think the active duration time has increased by a lot too.\" It was only natural that the core\u0027s capacity would increase when they had fused it with the artificial sun. Lee Shin Woo quietly took it and gripped it. The fire trapped within periodically thumped like a heart. \"And I\u0027m also finished with the other installation.\" \"You did it.\" \"You pretty much did everything.\" \"Kratia, it would\u0027ve been impossible if not for your ability.\" Lee Shin Woo and Kratia exchanged meaningful smiles. Jin, in a fit of meaningless jealousy, raked the ground. Lee Shin Woo ignored the tantrum, got on top of Jin and declared. \"Alright. It\u0027s great that we finished in time. Call everyone and tell them to gather. ...It\u0027s time for the final battle.\" \"Finally...\" \"Are we assaulting the capital?\" \"Nope.\" Lee Shin Woo cold-heartedly shook his head. Jin and Kratia just looked at him strangely. In response, he sported his own doubtful expression. \"Did you really think I\u0027d launch a direct attack on the capital with this many forces?\" \"You weren\u0027t going to?\" \"Obviously not. There\u0027s no telling how many of ours will die if we attack head-on now that the sun is gone and the Emperor\u0027s power has increased.\" It made a lot of sense. The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, was monstrous enough to use the source of darkness itself as his life vessel. Unlike the Archmage, the Emperor didn\u0027t possess such superb transportation abilities, but if you got in range of him, then you\u0027d start the battle in a whole lot of pain. Even though he had the golem train and the thorn wall was destroyed, they still had to get to the Emperor undetected! \"Then...?\" \"Our forces will act as a diversion. They\u0027ll lure all of the Empire\u0027s undead away.\" \"The undead...?\" \"To the surface.\" Hearing that, Jin wondered whether Lee Shin Woo had gone crazy from all of the stress, or if the undead curse had finally gotten to him from the consecutive Bone Reinforcements. However, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s expression remained serious. Had he seriously gone insane? Jin furtively raised a leg. If it\u0027s broke, then kicking it will fix it! She\u0027d never tried it on a person before, but kicking him at light-speed should have some sort of effect! \"I\u0027m not going to invade the surface. You\u0027ve been by my side for a while now. You can guess what I\u0027m thinking, right?\" Lee Shin Woo looked at Jin as if she were ridiculous for even considering it, and retorted. Indeed, Jin was always by his side. She\u0027d also heard his thoughts the most out of anyone, albeit indirectly. Thus far... so... \"You were prepared to fight both sides. You were increasing your forces on the surface, as well as your forces underground...\" \"Yep, that\u0027s right. I was prepping forces on both sides.\" \"Yeah! So, I thought you would use both your forces to... Huh? Wait a sec.\" \"...I\u0027ve already mostly figured it out.\" Unlike Jin, who was tilting her head, Kratia looked at Lee Shin Woo with shining eyes when he was in Heaven Defying General mode. \"Shin Woo wants to destroy both the surface and underground\u0027s Imperial Armies.\" \"Yeah. Thus far, we thought Shin Woo\u0027s forces on the surface would take out the surface\u0027s Imperial Army and his forces underground would do the same for the underground\u0027s Imperial Army. But he expects fierce opposition from both sides. At this rate, our casualties will be huge. At the very least, weaklings like Lloyd, Erian, and Prince will die.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" Even though most of the Magic Empire\u0027s 12 Generals had died underground, the Underground Empire\u0027s 12 Generals were nearing extinction, and all of the level 5 or lower undead were all gone, both sides still retained a significant amount of forces. Both sides retained their elites, the elites that had been there for hundreds of years. He couldn\u0027t look down on either the quality or the quantity of those troops. \"...Shin Woo must\u0027ve never planned on fighting them straight up.\" \"Keep going.\" \"The forces that you\u0027ve developed... Maybe they weren\u0027t meant for fighting.\" \"Huh?\" A diversion. Lee Shin Woo had definitely said that. If that\u0027s the case, then Lee Shin Woo\u0027s goal all along was... \"The surface and underground\u0027s Imperial Armies. Shin Woo plans on using the Heaven Defying General\u0027s troops to lure both armies towards each other, causing them to clash.\" \"...Is that even possible?\" Jin, who was quietly listening beside them, said stupidly. So the heroes, who risked their lives to fight and grow, as well as the religious orders\u0027 forces... They were all clowns on a stage? \"It is.\" Lee Shin Woo grinned and said. Jin, who was connected to him, instinctively took a step forward. \"You\u0027ll see soon enough.\" Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-291","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
