Ethan Cruz is?\"\n [Yes. To be exact, I see the two remaining undead heroes returning to him.]\n \"Ah... So he\u0027s at least going to try to get out with what he has left, huh.\"\n In a way, it was his expected course of action. Lee Shin Woo had killed the Beast General, dropped the Vulture General from the sky, and killed six out of the eight undead heroes. What\u0027s worse, Lee Shin Woo had also killed Ethan Cruz\u0027s accomplice, Mentes Orun, so in terms of chess, all that was left was the king and a pawn. It would be strange if he wasn\u0027t retreating.\n \"But... Hmm. There\u0027s no way he\u0027d just leave.\"\n \"Shin Woo, don\u0027t you think you\u0027re the reason he\u0027s leaving?\"\n Lee Shin Woo muttered and Jin retorted. Jin believed that Ethan Cruz had done everything he could. If he were to point out a fault of his, then it would be that Ethan Cruz hadn\u0027t properly assessed Lee Shin Woo\u0027s ability beforehand. It seemed obvious, but it was indeed his biggest mistake.\n \"Still, there\u0027s no way he\u0027d just leave. There are still a lot of undead left on the battlefield, and the heroes are still fighting, so the fact that Ethan Cruz is running away by himself means that... he believes he might be exposed.\"\n \"Maybe he thinks he\u0027s already been exposed. Especially since you went out of your way to pick out and kill the undead heroes.\"\n \"No. Any normal hero that can\u0027t use darkness magic wouldn\u0027t be able to ascertain the link between the undead heroes and Ethan Cruz. And so long as they aren\u0027t cognizant of that link, Ethan Cruz will remain as a trustworthy hero. Aside from me, no one else thinks that Ethan Cruz is evil. What\u0027s worse, Mentes Orun didn\u0027t really say much to Lloyd.\"\n \"Then why? Why is he purposely trying to expose himself?\"\n \"That\u0027s... Wait a sec. I think we\u0027ll know soon.\"\n At that moment, Ethan Cruz had sent him a request for a private chat. Lee Shin Woo was briefly shocked but soon calmed down. Ethan Cruz had no way of knowing that Lee Shin Woo was hostile towards him. So, the purpose of this conversation was...\n \"Senior?\"\n [Ethan Cruz: Shin Woo, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re safe! Are you alright?]\n \"Yes, I\u0027m alright!\"\n [Ethan Cruz: Ooh, that\u0027s a relief. This might sound shameless, but I need your help. Their airborne troops have found me! But I can\u0027t intercept them because of the buff I cast on you... Help me out, Super Rookie. If I die here, then the buff I cast on you will disappear as well! Everything will become a mess!]\n ...Aha, as he thought. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo figured out everything. Ethan Cruz was resorting to his last trick.\n [Ethan Cruz: The others are busy fighting, so they won\u0027t be able to help me... I may sound hopeless, but help me out. Come over here as soon as you can!]\n \"I understand, Senior! I\u0027ll go immediately! Please stay safe for just a little while longer!\"\n With his level 19 Acting skill, Lee Shin Woo replied overly lively and soon ended the private chat. When he looked up at the sky, the airborne troops were circling around the area Ethan was hiding. If someone who didn\u0027t know the situation saw this, then they would truly believe that Ethan Cruz was in danger.\n \"Wait, what happened?\"\n \"What do you mean \u0027what happened\u0027? He can\u0027t leave it to anyone else, so he\u0027ll step up and do it himself.\"\n Lee Shin Woo led Jin towards Ethan Cruz and replied calmly. But because it seemed like Jin hadn\u0027t yet grasped the situation, Lee Shin Woo explained further.\n \"The airborne troops that are circling around... They\u0027re obviously on Ethan Cruz\u0027s side. You know that much, right?\"\n \"Yeah, since Ethan Cruz was the one to call the Vulture General. But I\u0027m surprised that he can still control the general’s subordinates.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s a bit surprising to me as well. Though that\u0027s not important right now.\"\n Either Ethan Cruz and the Vulture General had formed an agreement beforehand, or he had some way of commanding the air troops. The fact that the airborne troops moved threateningly, but didn\u0027t attack Ethan Cruz was the proof.\n \"He\u0027s probably going to make up a lie, saying that the undead heroes that are returning to him are aiming for him. So if I were to naively go and help, then I\u0027ll have to fight against a disadvantageous battle, and once I\u0027m dead, he would revive me as his subordinate... Well, I bet that\u0027s what he\u0027s thinking.\"\n Looking down on the heroes and dispatching two of the 12 generals was a mistake. Therefore, it would be better for him to call each hero individually and take care of them one by one... It was a reasonable conclusion. Ethan Cruz wasn\u0027t aiming for only Lee Shin Woo.\n \"Then why are you going? Are you insane?\"\n \"Jin, you remember that buff... No, that debuff that he cast on me, right?\"\n Ethan Cruz had used his darkness magic to cast a \u0027buff\u0027 on him. It was no simple buff; it was actually a curse that would temporarily increase one\u0027s abilities, and then debilitating side effects would follow. The curse\u0027s evilest ability was its hypnosis effect, and after a certain amount of time, one wouldn\u0027t be able to defy Ethan Cruz\u0027s orders.\n In other words, Ethan Cruz\u0027s private chat request was no request but was undoubtedly a \u0027command\u0027.\n \"But that curse didn\u0027t work on you!\"\n \"To be exact, I was able to resist it. ...But that guy still believes that his curse has affected me.\"\n Of course, he could reveal that the curse hadn\u0027t affected him and move against Ethan Cruz. But if he did, Ethan Cruz would immediately dispel the darkness magic link between him and Lee Shin Woo.\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t want that. To be more specific, Lee Shin Woo actually wanted Ethan Cruz to cast another curse on him. Hearing that, Jin was dumbfounded and muttered.\n \"I knew early on that you were messed up, but I didn\u0027t think you were this far gone...\"\n \"This was my plan from the very beginning. You got that?\"\n Lee Shin Woo was sure that Ethan Cruz specialized in curses. But so long as Lee Shin Woo possessed Darkness Resistance: MAX, there was no way one of Ethan Cruz\u0027s curses would affect him.\n If that\u0027s the case, then what would be the best way to make use of this? Force Ethan Cruz to give up on cursing him? Make him give up on his darkness magic, forcing him to use plain magic? No, obviously not.\n \"The right answer is: act like I\u0027m affected by his curse, put him into a false sense of security, and then counterattack. If my counterattack is successful, then I\u0027ll be able to inflict a grievous wound, even if he\u0027s a level 8.\"\n \"You fight way too dirty!\"\n \"Just keeping listening.\"\n Lee Shin Woo clearly remembered Bisher Moon\u0027s explanation on the Deadly Force curse.\n \u0027Because Deadly Force is such a fatal curse, it has a few downsides. First, it\u0027s difficult to use against those with more magic than the caster. Second, the caster cannot move freely until the target\u0027s death.\u0027\n The first point probably wasn\u0027t relevant to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t think he could beat a level 8 magician in terms of magic.\n However, he could use the second downside. If he could bait Ethan Cruz into using Deadly Force on him, then he\u0027d be able to restrain a level 8 hero! Lee Shin Woo was immune to all curses, so he\u0027d be able to take that opportunity and attack Ethan Cruz.\n \"I didn\u0027t nullify the curse immediately but allowed him to cast it and resisted it. But this was a lot harder to do than I\u0027d expected.\"\n \"You... was the reason you allowed him to curse you because...?\"\n \"Yep. I wanted to become more accustomed to controlling the extent of my resistance.\"\n Not nullifying the curse itself, but nullifying its effects. If that were possible, then Lee Shin Woo would be able to do as he pleased while Ethan Cruz suffered the downsides to Deadly Force. Lee Shin Woo had been training throughout the battle in preparation for this.\n \"...I\u0027m speechless.\"\n \"Yeah, stay like that. Since we\u0027re going to see him soon.\"\n Lee Shin Woo explained confidently and patted Jin. Was he alright with that explanation? Jin ran more quickly than before and left the battlefield. He was close enough to Ethan Cruz\u0027s hiding place that he could see it. With Jin\u0027s speed, they would reach it in 5 seconds.\n \u0027Senior Yasunori Akira is still hiding. If he were to attack Ethan Cruz with me once I\u0027m cursed, then it\u0027ll be over in a flash. ...But.\"\n But there was one thing that was bothering him.\n Lee Shin Woo softly sighed. He didn\u0027t really want to think about it, but it was still a possibility. If it was true, then it would become a bit complicated...\n \"Well, whatever. If that happens, I\u0027ll just get three more.\"\n \u0027Three? Why three?\u0027\n \"Senior!\"\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t answer Jin and yelled out. He didn\u0027t know if it was because he\u0027d gotten closer, but the circling airborne troops took that moment to descend and attack Ethan Cruz. He almost wanted to applaud at their lively acting.\n \"Shin Woo, you\u0027re not late!\"\n \"Senior!\"\n Lee Shin Woo drew his Lightning God\u0027s Fury, cut through the undead, and approached him. Ethan Cruz sported an overwhelming relieved expression and looked at him.\n \"You came to rescue me!\"\n \"Of course, Senior!\"\n Lee Shin Woo could give Ethan Cruz\u0027s contemptible smile an 8/10. As he thought, perhaps this guy had the Acting skill as well.\n However, he discarded that thought and moved on. Ethan Cruz smiled brightly and spoke.\n \"Even though the curse hasn\u0027t affected you!\"\n \"Tch.\"\n \"Heup!\"\n To think he\u0027d notice! Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue. At that moment, Yasunori Akira popped out of his hiding place and attacked Lee Shin Woo. He\u0027d only heard of the style before, Battōjutsu. Yasunori Akira\u0027s strike was so powerful and swift that it felt like he\u0027d be cut in two.\n But because he shared Jin\u0027s ridiculously high speed stat, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s reflexes and dynamic visual acuity had grown beyond comprehension, so he was barely able to see the trajectory of his strike. And if he could see it, he could block it too.\n \"You were able to block my strike!?\"\n \"Hoo. You know, I want to trust other people too sometimes.\"\n Lee Shin Woo blocked Yasunori Akira\u0027s strike with his Lightning God\u0027s Fury (the moment their swords clashed, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s entire body shattered, but through his Acting and Regeneration skills, no one noticed) and sighed.\n Well, of course he\u0027d sigh. Both his plan of using Ethan Cruz\u0027s curse and Yasunori Akira helping him had all gone up in smoke. Honestly, Lee Shin Woo had somewhat expected Yasunori Akira to betray him, but he hadn\u0027t given up on him till the very end.\n \u0027I\u0027d considered the possibility that Ethan Cruz would use Yasunori Akira as well... Since he\u0027d need to know what Retadane would do and prepare accordingly.\u0027\n Ethan Cruz knew that Retadane had suspected him. If that\u0027s the case, then he must\u0027ve known that Retadane would eventually approach Lee Shin Woo... as he hadn\u0027t been in this world for very long and hadn\u0027t been approached by Ethan Cruz yet, therefore being trustworthy.\n However, Ethan Cruz had planted a spy in preparation for that eventuality. Someone who would meet with Lee Shin Woo and Retadane, and who would report what they were planning back to him: Yasunori Akira.\n The reason Yasunori Akira had approached Lee Shin Woo first and had warned him about Ethan Cruz was to gain his trust. By doing so, he would be able to manipulate Lee Shin Woo, form a sense of camaraderie amongst him, Retadane, and Lee Shin Woo, and ultimately cause them to believe that he\u0027s their comrade.\n \"Did you know?\"\n \"I said I really wanted to trust you. Are you deaf?\"\n With that in mind, the reason Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t killed Yasunori Akira was because, contrary to Ethan Cruz, there was a chance that Yasunori Akira was \u0027innocent\u0027. Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t been able to discard the chance that Yasunori Akira had approached him out of genuine concern.\n However, with this, he was sure. He was definitely on Ethan Cruz\u0027s side. Now he could kill him without feeling any guilt.\n \"Haha, you really are strong. I really like you.\"\n \"You mean you like me enough to kill me and raise me as your subordinate?\"\n \"So you\u0027re aware of it already, Super Rookie!\"\n \"Yeah, that shamelessness really suits you.\"\n Lee Shin Woo sighed once more, and completely dispelled the curse. Since Ethan Cruz was already aware of it, there was no reason to carry a curse that wouldn\u0027t be of any benefit to him.\n Even though Ethan Cruz should be aware of Lee Shin Woo dispelling the curse, his expression didn\u0027t change. That meant he had something else up his sleeve, aside from the curses and Yasunori Akira.\n \"You\u0027re really amazing. I really admire you.\"\n Lee Shin Woo was surrounded by the airborne troops, the 2 remaining undead heroes, and Yasunori Akira. They came closer and closer, and Ethan Cruz spoke relaxingly.\n Lee Shin Woo knew that he was just buying time to completely encircle him, but he decided to play along for now. He also needed to buy a bit of time.\n \"You really made a mess of my plans. I even used Akira, but I couldn\u0027t stop you. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d create such an impressive plan behind Retadane\u0027s back. Not only did you block my curse, but you also killed Mentes. How did you do it? I still don\u0027t understand how you did it. Ah, you can\u0027t use the chatting channel here, so relax and talk to me.\"\n \"Do you really think I\u0027ll tell you?\"\n \"Mm, yeah. You wouldn\u0027t want to talk. However, you\u0027ll soon change your mind. Once you\u0027ve died and been brought back.\"\n \"Mm... I have something I\u0027d like to say. Want to hear it?\"\n \"Of course.\"\n Once his encirclement was complete, Ethan Cruz was sure of his victory. He was definitely feeling relaxed.\n Lee Shin Woo had expected Yasunori Akira\u0027s betrayal, but he hadn\u0027t expected Ethan Cruz to discover his curse plan. As a result, he had jumped into the mouth of the tiger.\n \"If I was suspicious of Yasunori Akira, then I could\u0027ve made a plan separate from Retadane\u0027s. Have you thought about why I didn\u0027t?\"\n \"I\u0027ve thought about it, but there\u0027s no point in bluffing at this point. Since Retadane is currently fighting against tens of thousands of undead. I assure you... she won\u0027t be able to rescue you before she kills them all. Because that\u0027s her core, her hatred for the undead. She lives only to kill the undead!\"\n It seemed like Ethan Cruz was also aware of Retadane\u0027s obsession with the undead. Perhaps he had been waiting for Retadane to go deep into enemy lines and go on a rampage.\n \"Mm, you\u0027re right. That\u0027s why.\"\n \"...What?\"\n Ethan Cruz was slightly flustered by his calm affirmation.\n \"It\u0027s simple. It means that there\u0027s a part of my plan that Retadane can\u0027t know.\"\n \"Wait a sec. Hey, Ethan. Ethan! I feel a presence... an overwhelming presence! How... all of a sudden!?\"\n \"What are you talking about...\"\n Lee Shin Woo grinned and said.\n \"The real battle starts now.\"\n A \u0027kwang\u0027 sound rang out. The airborne troops began to drop like flies. Was it due to Kratia and Prince\u0027s magic? Nope. Boulders had caused them to drop from the sky.\n [The Great Paul Zero has commanded us!]\n [How dare you challenge his authority! Kill them all!]\n \"G-Giants...!\"\n It wasn\u0027t just the Giants. There were the level 7 Chimeras, the level 6 golems, and several other elites mixed in as well. The Heaven Defying General\u0027s corps had finally arrived.\n \"Lee Shin Woo, how did you...\"\n \"Who knows? I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n Lee Shin Woo pulled out an unknown staff and beamed.\n Ethan Cruz\u0027s body felt chills.\n Death was calling for him.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-184","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
