The Battle Against Seagald - 5 [End of Volume 12]\u003e\n Three days later, the group safely arrived at the capital. They had passed right through the level 4 danger zone, Bayran and then headed straight for the capital! Though he wasn\u0027t here with the other heroes, he was still deeply moved.\n \"Is this... really?\"\n [Are you surprised?]\n \"Obviously...\"\n The Light General was astonished; the outer fortress was completely gone, exposing the inner city within.\n \"It\u0027s the capital, yet there are absolutely no defenses! How are we supposed to take this? Is this really the capital? Is the capital actually inside a hidden subspace?\"\n [Calm down. It wasn\u0027t originally like this. The capital\u0027s defensive facilities were all destroyed in a recent battle.]\n \"What kind of battle would\u0027ve destroyed all of its defensive facilities?\"\n The Sun Spear General had been smiling ever since they\u0027d been reunited, but even he was stuck between shock and confusion and didn\u0027t know what to do.\n But it\u0027s not like he could say \u0027I\u0027m actually the Heaven Defying General and the hero Lee Shin Woo. I aimed the cannon the Lich made at the capital and shot light at it!\u0027, so Lee Shin Woo just remained quiet. The Sun Spear General seemed to come to his own conclusion and patted him on the shoulder.\n \"Now I get how much you went through.\"\n [Hmph.]\n This \u0027hmph\u0027 was Arema Steelworker\u0027s equivalent to \u0027Thanks for understanding, my friend\u0027. It seemed to get through to them, as the Sun Spear General laughed and the Light General just sighed. Lee Shin Woo was suddenly fearful of how effective his acting was.\n [I\u0027m sure you already know, but I\u0027ll say it again. It\u0027s impossible to move covertly within the capital. We need to move as quickly as possible and achieve our goal. Once we do, we have to get out of here as quickly as possible.]\n \"We know already. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve prepared so much.\"\n Lee Shin Woo saw the Sun Spear General take out three more of the consumable artifact, the \u0027Dark Red Solar Eclipse\u0027 and just nodded his head.\n Yeah, he needed to trust them. They were the surface\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders, weren\u0027t they? ...Even Arema Steelworker had been one of the Four Heavenly Commanders!\n [Then... Let\u0027s get going. I can\u0027t tell you exactly where Seagald is, so we should send scouts out to look for him.]\n \"Yeah. You know the capital best, so I\u0027ll leave it to you.\"\n Amazing. Lee Shin Woo picked some scouts from the Vampires and golems and sent them off in various directions. Of course, Lee Shin Woo already knew where Seagald\u0027s current location was, so scouts were unnecessary.\n He was just sending them to provoke the Imperial Army. They would also get in Seagald\u0027s way, as well as help adjust his timing and start the battle!\n Lee Shin Woo sent his golems along the safest route, but he\u0027d mostly dispatched them to pick up any more Evil Eye ore that might be laying around. He really hoped that there was at least a little bit left!\n [Then let\u0027s get a move on. Judika, is the report system secure?]\n \"Of course. Don\u0027t look down on the power of a Vampire.\"\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but I am looking down on it right now\u0027, Lee Shin Woo was instinctively about to say, but desperately restrained himself from doing so and quickly moved forward. In his place, the Light General snorted, but the Sun Spear General just ignored her.\n Lee Shin Woo realized something was off 30 minutes later. They marched through the inner city, which had been turned to ash by the cannon, and got closer and closer to the capital. While doing so, the Mana Radar picked up something.\n \u0027This is...?\u0027\n It was neither Seagald nor the Archmage... It was a mana signature that Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t familiar with. But then, why was the Mana Radar picking it up?\n That reason was extremely simple. Currently, the Mana Radar didn\u0027t just detect the mana that he was familiar with, but also any mana level 8 or over as well. And at this very moment, there was a presence headed right for them. There were also three level 7 elites around them, as well as hundreds of level 6 soldiers as well.\n [...]\n \"Arema?\"\n How many level 8 undead remained within the Underground Empire that he wasn\u0027t aware of? He couldn\u0027t see their face, but he knew who it was. But the issue was: why were they coming towards them right now? \n He looked at the Sun Spear General, who had paused and was looking at him strangely, and asked.\n [I\u0027ll ask just in case, but you guys... No one followed you down from the surface, right?]\n \"Of course not. We came straight from the palace. There\u0027s no way someone followed us. ...But for you to be like that... Are you saying what I think you\u0027re saying?\"\n [It might be tough, but we got to move as quickly as possible. I\u0027ll order some of these guys to buy us some time.]\n Lee Shin Woo split 50 Vampires and 100 golems from his main force and sent them away. He was clearly sending them to their deaths, but the golems always followed orders, and the Vampires were psychopaths that were loyal to a fault, so they left without a single complaint. \n The main force marched on even quicker than before. He already knew where Seagald was, so he picked the optimum route while acting appropriately; the aftermath wouldn\u0027t matter.\n \u0027However...\u0027\n Another 30 minutes later, Lee Shin Woo inwardly groaned. He knew they wouldn\u0027t last long against a level 8 opponent, but this was too much; they were taken out as soon as they met them. They weren\u0027t able to buy him any time at all.\n \u0027But here\u0027s where it starts. Were we able to throw off our enemies even a little? ...Mm, I guess it was too much to hope for. Then that means they have a way of tracking us.\u0027\n Their enemy was heading straight for them. Which meant they had a way of tracking them in real-time. He\u0027d said it in passing, but perhaps the Archmage really did have a Muninn\u0027s Eye! [1]\n \n [If you could do that, then go after Seagald. Damn it.]\n [Maybe the Lich is already after him.]\n [...You\u0027re right.]\n As Jin said, the Mana Radar had picked up two familiar level 8 undead fighting against each other around the capital\u0027s inner fortress. It was Seagald and the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\n However, Lee Shin Woo had come here to prevent Seagald from meeting either the Lich or the Emperor and turn them into Anti-Skull. The fact that he was dealing with the Archmage right now wasn\u0027t good news for him.\n \u0027What should I do? Even if I go, the Archmage will lose to Seagald. I don\u0027t have any time to waste. How about leading him to Seagald... No, that\u0027s impossible, even for me. If that\u0027s the case, then how about using the Heaven Door\u0027s Key and sending him off somewhere? He couldn\u0027t just shoot the gate at someone like the Meid≈ç Zangetsuha [2]; plus, it would be difficult to use it against someone constantly on the move...\u0027\n He couldn\u0027t think of anything at all. He had no choice but to send these guys off first and stop Seagald himself, rather than let the situation worsen even further... Ultimately, Lee Shin Woo paused.\n [I\u0027ll stay here. Go and catch Retadane.]\n \"You can\u0027t, Arema.\"\n He expected the Light General to try and stop him. But the Sun Spear General was actually the one to stop him.\n \"You\u0027re the one who knows the capital best, Arema. There\u0027s no point in us going first. ...I don\u0027t know who\u0027s following us, but if one of us has to stay back, then I\u0027ll stay.\"\n [No, if you keep going this way, you\u0027ll eventually find Seagald. Moreover, the one who\u0027s coming this way is probably Leofield Von Tariman. You can\u0027t stop him.]\n \"Ha, that\u0027s great. I always wanted to fight against him. They say his spearmanship is unmatched! As a spear user myself, I want to see just who\u0027s more skilled with the spear!\"\n [You...]\n Why? Wasn\u0027t he one of the Emperor\u0027s puppets? If that\u0027s true, then shouldn\u0027t he be jumping at the chance to catch Seagald?\n Even though he was acting, Lee Shin Woo was genuinely confused and trailed off. The Sun Spear General, Judika Von Beloduns spoke with a clear smile. He was being genuine for the first time since coming down here.\n \"Arema, Madam Lilaine isn\u0027t the only one who has something they regret. I, like her, regret not stopping you that day. I can\u0027t forget how I allowed my friend to sacrifice his bright future. So... let me do this much.\"\n [Judika...]\n Lee Shin Woo believed that others acted rationally and in their best interests so that no harm would come to them. Thus, he didn\u0027t expect Judika to volunteer to stay as bait. Human emotion truly was difficult to predict. The Light General and this guy were both difficult to predict.\n He strived to keep his emotions from showing (this also befitted Arema\u0027s personality) and spoke calmly.\n [Don\u0027t die, Judika. ...But if you do die, I\u0027ll be sure to pick up your bones, so don\u0027t worry.]\n That was the truth. He couldn\u0027t let a single level 8 bone go to waste.\n \"I won\u0027t die, so don\u0027t worry, Arema. I\u0027m counting on you. Since His Majesty told us to strike down Seagald without fail. His Majesty\u0027s orders are absolute. That\u0027s something you always used to say.\"\n [Of course. Seagald will die by my hand.]\n Lee Shin Woo extended a hand, as though he were hesitating. The Sun Spear General grabbed his hand and flashed him a calm smile. He said he wouldn\u0027t die, yet his expression said otherwise; he looked like he was ready to die.\n \"Then let\u0027s meet up a little while later.\"\n [Got it. Come back safely.]\n He probably wouldn\u0027t come back. Since he could tell how strong he was...\n Lee Shin Woo tried his best not to show it (to someone else, one might interpret it as him stopping himself from crying) and turned around. The Sun Spear General just grinned and began walking towards the direction of their pursuers. It was like a scene straight out of a movie.\n \"...To think he felt that way for so many years.\"\n [Indeed. It\u0027s already been so many years; what\u0027s he thinking? ...You\u0027re all idiots. You and him.]\n \"...Arema.\"\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s acting was so perfect that one might wonder whether Arema really was dead, saying \u0027Oh, Arema really was alive?\u0027. He spoke brusquely, but the deep emotion within them caused even Jin to tilt her head!\n So, how would the Light General fare? She fixed the scarf around her next and looked at him unkindly.\n \"You were just acting like you were as tough as nails. You really fooled me.\"\n [I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.]\n \"Ha... Even when they age, men are always idiots.\"\n She said and looked at him warmly. If Jin didn\u0027t know that the Light General was directing that gaze at Arema, not Lee Shin Woo, then she would be putting up a huge fuss right now. \n Lee Shin Woo then thought. \n \u0027If you keep being like this, then it\u0027ll become harder to kill you later.\u0027\n And thus, the Vampire and the Demon... Err, the hero put the Sun Spear General\u0027s sacrifice behind them and began running towards Seagald.\n \n \n [1] T/N: Muninn is one of Odin\u0027s ravens, like Huginn.\n [2] T/N: Inuyasha reference.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-276","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
