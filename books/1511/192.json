Heaven Door\u0027s Key - 2\u003e\n It was so surprising that Lee Shin Woo fell from Jin\u0027s back.\n \"Pleine, what happened?\"\n \"That\u0027s my line, Mr. Shin Woo... Ah, uaaaah. All the permits are being sucked in!\"\n Pleine had already completed her spell, and the fusion between the Bone Gate and the magic circle dragged God\u0027s power, or the permits towards it.\n The permits flowed from his body, to Pleine, to the magic circle, and then to then to the Bone Gate. That huge flow could no longer be interrupted.\n The Bone Gate, which had fully fused with the magic circle, radiated white light, as though this was the original plan, and evolved in some unknown way. \n \"What do we do if we can\u0027t go to the surface?\"\n \"...W-We don\u0027t cover already sold goods that are either damaged or fused.\"\n \"Don\u0027t lie! You just made that up!\"\n \"You got me! But you won\u0027t get the permits back even if you kill me, so you have to take responsibility! I didn\u0027t do anything wrong, ok? I really didn\u0027t!\"\n It was really frustrating, but she was right. There was no point in blaming her, as this was the result of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s item, the Bone Gate. \n But the Bone Gate should\u0027ve been dormant within his inventory. The Bone Gate was an item that would remain on standby until he activated it, so why did this happen all of a sudden?\n If he were to guess, then the Bone Gate and Pleine\u0027s magic circle must\u0027ve had similar properties. It was concerning that the Bone Gate reacted to the secret shop permits, or rather, God’s power. \n \"I got this item from Steve... from a Treasure Eater. So if I find some more Treasure Eaters, would I be able to solve the puzzle?\"\n \"Treasure Eaters are hard to see even once in your lifetime. How many did you kill!?\"\n There was nothing more Lee Shin Woo\u0027s party could do. He just stood beside Pleine, who was munching on popcorn, and watched the Bone Gate as it changed, no, evolved.\n The Bone Gate calmed down only after it had absorbed all of his permits. It had fully absorbed the magic circle and began to float in the air.\n [You have acquired the Lv9 ????. By absorbing weak divinity, the artifact has reached its completed form. This artifact will lead you where you want to go. The item will activate upon giving the karma you have created a name.]\n \"Then, how about the Anyway Door...\" [1]\n \"Give it a rest!\"\n Jin retorted desperately, stopping him. Lee Shin Woo felt disappointed, but then he gave the artifact a proper name.\n \"Heaven Door\u0027s Key.\"\n \"...I feel like I\u0027ve heard that from somewhere.\"\n Heaven Door\u0027s Key. It was a term in the dead Elementalist\u0027s diary, but he didn\u0027t know what it meant. But for some reason, he recollected that word just now.\n Lee Shin Woo instinctively spoke that word, and Pleine briefly looked at him in shock. She soon sported a bitter smile. He hesitated briefly, but then asked.\n \"Does it not fit?\"\n \"No, it\u0027s perfect. ...Yes, nothing else would work.\"\n Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo felt relaxed, but at that moment, the level 9 artifact had become complete. \n [The Lv9 Heaven Door\u0027s Key has been born. This artifact, which is connected to your very soul, originally possessed the ability to ignore any obstacle and guide you to where you want to go. However, you are a much lower level than the item, so a part of that function is restricted. If you reach a suitable level, then the artifact\u0027s true power will be revealed. This artifact activates through the consumption of bones and mana.]\n [New coordinates have been recorded. Enough energy has been acquired, so a door can be opened that takes you to the coordinates.]\n At best, he thought the artifact would evolve and create a door to the surface. Fortunately, that didn\u0027t seem to be the case.\n Lee Shin Woo turned to Pleine for confirmation, but she just gazed vacantly at the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. She acted like she\u0027d baked cookies, but a cake came out of her oven.\n \"Then... perhaps...\"\n \"Pleine?\"\n \"An Irregular... A true Irregular... Small singularities overlap, creating a miracle that goes beyond the curse and divinity.\"\n \"Pleine...?\"\n He didn\u0027t understand at all. Pleine quietly and naturally embraced Lee Shin Woo. As a skeleton, he wasn\u0027t supposed to feel any emotions, but Pleine broke through his defenses and embarrassed him with the abundant feeling. Lee Shin Woo felt his emotions and urges return, things he thought were long forgotten. \n It was truly shocking. He, who never felt any different from physical contact, felt \u0027excited\u0027. Who exactly was Pleine? Actually, was she even human? But unfortunately, Pleine hadn\u0027t noticed his dilemma.\n \"You may be able to do it. What even God couldn\u0027t do.\"\n \"Uh... Pleine? I got it, so please calm down and explain.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t explain it to you.\"\n \"Seriously, you really just make up your own rules!\"\n Of course, based on the artifact\u0027s detailed abilities or Pleine\u0027s reaction, he had a rough idea what was going on. But it was so ridiculous that he couldn\u0027t be sure, so he was reluctant to even say it. If what he thought was true, then the situation was ridiculous. He wouldn\u0027t be able to ridicule Lee Man Bok anymore.\n He suffered in various ways in Pleine\u0027s arms, but Jin, who was left out like a third wheel, was pissed and tore them away from each other, letting them calm down just barely. Both Lee Shin Woo and Pleine. \n \"So are you going to go or not?\"\n \"...Ah, that\u0027s right. I\u0027m sorry. I got too excited. That was unlike me. Ah, maybe that hug wasn\u0027t so bad.\"\n \"I really don\u0027t like this woman.\"\n [She has a unique disposition. Master, be cautious from now on.]\n Even after removing herself from Lee Shin Woo, she briefly thought to herself again, and soon said, \u0027ok\u0027 and nodded her head. She then spoke to Lee Shin Woo quietly.\n \"You shouldn\u0027t tell anyone about this artifact for the time being. Of course, that includes the people on the surface as well.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"And the Heaven Door\u0027s Key\u0027s current coordinates are set to the safest place in the Magic Empire. Unlike the Underground Empire, which is brimming with the undead, the surface still has dungeons that haven\u0027t been conquered yet. Plus, the coordinates of those dungeons are much more defined than the ones in the Empire, so as long as you don\u0027t reveal your identity, you should be able to level up much more easily on the surface.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly what I was hoping for.\"\n \"But please don\u0027t approach the Emperor. The Emperor, who reigns over the Magic Empire, is more powerful than the Emperor underground.\"\n \"...Really?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Pleine nodded her head with a grave expression.\n \"They are afraid of the undead curse, not the undead born from the curse. You know the difference, right?\"\n \"...Somewhat.\"\n \"Good. Refer to this booklet for the rest... Then, please get going. You shouldn\u0027t have any problems no matter who you meet with your silver tongue.\"\n \"I thought you were coming with me?\"\n \"I\u0027d like to, but... Haha.\"\n Lee Shin Woo asked seriously, but Pleine just looked at him with a sour expression and shrugged her shoulders. Last time, she\u0027d left and returned from the surface with just three permits, but it seemed like there was still so much she couldn’t tell him.\n \"Alright. Then, see you later.\"\n \"You\u0027re probably already acquainted with some of the other heroes, but if something happens underground, then I\u0027ll tell you immediately. The artifact has enough energy to bring you back, so you should be able to return without much difficulty.\"\n \"Pleine, thanks for helping me.\"\n \"...I\u0027m sorry. Thank you for understanding my circumstances.\"\n Of course, there was a lot more he hadn\u0027t heard from her explanations, but Lee Shin Woo was well aware that she wasn\u0027t hiding the facts because she wanted to.\n Moreover, the fact that she couldn\u0027t tell him anything was proof that he was ahead of schedule. He shouldn\u0027t feel bothered by it; instead, he should just do what he needed to do one by one. The opportunity to go to the surface was invaluable.\n \"Then... I\u0027ll get going.\"\n \"Take care.\"\n After he\u0027d said his goodbyes, Lee Shin Woo activated the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. At some point, the artifact had returned to its small ring form, but once Lee Shin Woo willed it to activate, it expanded once more into the form of a gate.\n Lee Shin Woo got atop Jin\u0027s back again and caught his breath. He softly placed his hand above his neck. It was the best gesture that would relay both his will and his resolve without making Jin feel unpleasant. \n \"Are you ready, Jin?\"\n \"I was ready a long time ago. ...You\u0027re good too, right?\"\n \"Of course I am.\"\n \"Good. Let\u0027s go.\"\n Jin wasn\u0027t an idiot. He knew just how amazing what he\u0027d seen was, but he\u0027d given up on understanding it a lot earlier than Lee Shin Woo. He wasn\u0027t abandoning Lee Shin Woo; he just clearly knew what he could do and what his role was.\n [It\u0027s an honor to be able to take part in this opportunity with you, Master.]\n \"I\u0027m counting on you, Rem.\"\n The three entered the gate without hesitation. At that moment, the Heaven Door\u0027s Key vibrated immensely, accompanied by radiating light that devoured all three of them.\n The gate remained for a while longer, but soon there were no traces of it ever existing. Pleine realized that Lee Shin Woo had arrived on the surface and had retrieved the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. She naturally said.\n \"Are you seeing this?\"\n [Yeah, I am.]\n She could hear the Goddess\u0027s voice in her head. Lee Shin Woo had rudely said that she was possessed, but her communication with the Goddess [2] was much simpler than he imagined. Since the two were deeply connected... Like Lee Shin Woo and Jin\u0027s connection. \n \"You didn\u0027t call him here, knowing that this would happen, did you?\"\n [Yeah. Since even I don\u0027t have the ability to foresee so many repeated miracles. I felt really sorry for the heroes. Of course, it\u0027s not like I didn\u0027t have any expectations for him after turning him into an undead, but I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d figure out a solution. A level 9 artifact... Even I can\u0027t make something like that that easily.]\n \"Still, you\u0027re not entirely blameless. Please beg the heroes for mercy, the ones you called over without even having a solution in place.\"\n [Can\u0027t I just say that everything is going exactly as I planned? If I say that Lee Shin Woo is my new apostle, then...]\n \"There\u0027s no way he\u0027d become your apostle. No one besides Lloyd H.K. would believe that stupid excuse.\"\n Pleine sighed deeply and refuted her. Perhaps her firm reply caused the Goddess to sulk, as she remained silent for a moment. Then, she spoke again, as she felt it was pointless.\n [Now all we need to do is kill them all.]\n \"That\u0027s the hardest part!\"\n [We have Lee Shin Woo. He should be able to do it somehow, right?]\n \"You plan on leaving everything to Mr. Shin Woo? Ah, you\u0027re the worst, you old hag!\"\n In her frustration, she momentarily cut her connection with God. She could, as she possessed her own \u0027divinity\u0027, although it was inferior to God\u0027s.\n She soon questioned why she got worked up whenever it had something to do with Lee Shin Woo, but she forced herself to stop thinking about it, as she thought it\u0027d get embarrassing.\n \"I guess I\u0027ll drink some coffee before I sleep. I\u0027m just going to sleep it off.\"\n She returned to the counter, as if nothing had happened, and boiled some water for her coffee. Pleine soon changed her mind and took out some tea leaves. They were the same tea leaves that Seira had used to brew Lee Shin Woo tea.\n She boiled the water, let it cool a bit, let the tea leaves steep, and then poured it into a cup. A gentle fragrance wafted from the tea. \n \"If he does kill all of them... that is.\"\n Pleine took a sip of her tea and muttered. She couldn\u0027t help but frown.\n Ah, she would never get used to this bitterness.\n As she thought, her family was the worst.\n \n \n [1] T/N: Divinity can be translated as holy. Anyway Door is a reference to Doraemon.\n [2] T/N: Toy Car doesn\u0027t use the term \u0027goddess\u0027 very often. I\u0027m not sure why he makes the distinction here.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-192","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
