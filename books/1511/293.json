The Final Stage - 3\u003e\n The hero Izuna, or Ye Jin Jin, spoke with the Light General and sighed lengthily. They were in the very same mansion that Lee Shin Woo had visited before.\n \"Her drive\u0027s really scary. I talked to her across a long distance, yet it feels like the temperature\u0027s gone down 10 or so degrees.\"\n \"What I want to know is why she\u0027s so willing to betray the Empire, the same Empire she\u0027s protected for so long? So much so that she\u0027s even willing to risk her life.\"\n \"She must have some weird circumstances, Senior.\"\n Ye Jin Jin turned around and sighed deeply; Prince had been watching the conversation from behind her. Prince, who had summoned a small Fire Demon\u0027s hand and had been juggling a fireball, stopped and tilted her head.\n \"What kind of circumstances?\"\n \"She was always more concerned about the Empire\u0027s people than her loyalty to the Emperor, and it was complicated enough with a relationship involved, but... Mm, to sum it up, she\u0027s taken Mr. Shin Woo\u0027s bait and become one of our allies. Mr. Shin Woo said he\u0027d \u0027used a magic formula that replaced her love with anger\u0027.\"\n \"It almost sounds like that magic actually exists...\"\n However, Prince acknowledged it. She didn\u0027t know how Lee Shin Woo had caught the Light General, but she had indeed taken the bait. There was no reason to doubt this.\n \"Then it\u0027ll... soon begin.\"\n \"You have a huge responsibility, don\u0027t you? Can you do it properly? If you can\u0027t, then I, your dependable senior, can help you out.\"\n \"N-No, I\u0027m fine.\"\n Ye Jin Jin smiled confidently, but once she saw Prince, who was shaking like a newborn fawn, she shook her head with a stiff expression.\n Rather than entrust Prince with any sort of responsibility, it would be better to use a golem instead.\n \"Since Mr. Shin Woo entrusted this to me. I\u0027ll prove to him that I\u0027m not incompetent and I\u0027m good enough to walk beside him.\" \n \"But it seems like you\u0027ve been caught by Junior as well.\"\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m so happy! The fact that I\u0027ve been caught and that I\u0027m not letting go!\"\n \"...Oh, is that so? What beautiful love.\"\n She hadn\u0027t expected that! Prince had no choice but to nod and take a step back from Ye Jin Jin\u0027s energetic voice. Ye Jin Jin\u0027s emotions were too profound for Prince to understand, as she was still emotionally immature.\n Ye Jin Jin snorted and smacked her chest a couple of times, calming herself down. Now, all that was left in her mind were Lee Shin Woo\u0027s instructions.\n \u0027You have to take control of the army. The Imperial Army will, of course, resist this. That\u0027s when it gets real. You don\u0027t need to control them completely; you just need to lure them in a certain direction.\u0027\n Ye Jin Jin truly thought that Lee Shin Woo was a genius. Had he been planning this ever since he\u0027d first come to the Underground Empire?\n It didn\u0027t matter if he did or didn\u0027t; she was astonished nonetheless. She was even more shocked by how that plan had developed.\n \"We\u0027re splitting up the underground\u0027s undead forces into two groups... The \u0027good\u0027 undead and the \u0027bad\u0027 undead...\"\n \"What the hell are \u0027good\u0027 undead? Are they my junior\u0027s undead?\"\n \"They either won\u0027t attack us at all or will pretend to attack us. Of course, we have to play along. The problem\u0027s the \u0027bad\u0027 undead.\"\n \"The Underground Empire\u0027s Imperial Army. So we have to...\"\n \"Exactly.\"\n Ye Jin Jin nodded her head.\n \"We have to lure them to the surface\u0027s Imperial Army. It shouldn\u0027t be too difficult since Mr. Shin Woo can use Fire Shadow to communicate with both sides.\"\n \"It still sounds really tough... But it doesn\u0027t sound impossible. How many of those innate elements does my junior have anyway? It\u0027s so unfair!\"\n Getting both the surface and the underground\u0027s forces in one place was more than half the battle.\n All that was left was killing the rest. This was the most important task. They had to succeed no matter what.\n \"Then, don\u0027t we have to draw out the Emperor somehow? Junior\u0027s only making him more afraid, which will make him more likely to hide.\"\n \"We\u0027re the ones in trouble if he comes outside. Not only is he level 9, but he also possesses an innate element. There\u0027s a chance that he could mess with Mr. Shin Woo\u0027s carefully constructed scenario. We can include or exclude him in the plan; it all depends.\" \n \"And right now...\"\n \"We pick the latter.\"\n \"Then what about the Emperor!?\"\n \"The Emperor...\"\n Ye Jin Jin paused. She hesitated, as if she was thinking about what to say, but soon continued quietly. Her head was slightly bowed and her face was red with embarrassment.\n \"Mr. Shin Woo said he\u0027d take care of the rest. He said he\u0027d use the Light General to set up a gate and that he\u0027d use said gate to drag the Emperor underground...\"\n \"He\u0027s going to drag the level 9 Emperor underground!? Can you even do that when your enemy is a higher level than you!?\"\n \"That\u0027s why he left the Light General beside the Emperor. I don\u0027t know the details, but I heard that by using both the Fire Shadow and Heaven Space innate elements together, you can substitute a person\u0027s body for a gate.\"\n \"Junior is... already fighting somewhere beyond my imagination, huh...\"\n Prince sported a far-off expression. She had only just learned of the entire plan. Lee Shin Woo would do all the important stuff alone while the underground and surface gathered in one place and performed for him!\n \"It makes absolutely no sense, but I can\u0027t complain.\"\n \"Mr. Shin Woo is actually more delicate than people give him credit for. He\u0027d rather put himself in danger than let his allies endanger themselves. He\u0027s so cool!\"\n \"Sounds like Junior just picked the most rational choice, but as a result, we weren\u0027t given anything important to do, since we\u0027re nowhere near his level... No, sorry. Never mind.\"\n Prince had acknowledged the difference in their abilities, but the timing wasn\u0027t great. Since Ye Jin Jin\u0027s enthusiastic eyes continuously lost their fervor.\n \"Get a grip Ye Jin Jin! If we fail, everything\u0027s over! Your job\u0027s most important in cementing our positions as heroes and protecting the Empire! It has nothing to do with strength!\"\n \"That\u0027s true...! That must be why Mr. Shin Woo gave me this job...!\"\n \"Yeah, exactly!\"\n Good. She somehow managed to cheer her up! Prince sighed in relief and Ye Jin Jin forcefully stood up. Her battle dress, the Phoenix\u0027s Feather, swayed, discharging a weak heat.\n \"It seems like everyone\u0027s gathered already. It\u0027s finally time. Senior, let\u0027s go together.\"\n \"...Alright.\"\n Though they were technically excluded from the important mission, it didn\u0027t mean that they were completely immune to danger. After all, luring the undead and fighting against them wouldn\u0027t be an easy task.\n She might even die this time. In spite of her Fire Demon training, she may be hit by a stray arrow or spear and fall. However...\n \"...Let\u0027s go!\"\n \"Ok.\"\n The two left the residence side-by-side and went to the assembly area within the capital. And there...\n Elite priests and paladins from the Sun God religion awaited them, as well as the elites from the various religious orders that they\u0027d allied with. And the one representing the Imperial Army was...\n \"Hmph. You\u0027re quite good looking.\"\n One of the Empire\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders, Kuroin Von Begner. Befitting one of the Empire\u0027s strongest, he was powerful indeed. However, Ye Jin Jin, who shouldered the people\u0027s will, and had grown immensely in such a short period of time, was around mid level 7 in terms of strength. And with Lee Shin Woo\u0027s artifact, she could handle Kuroin, so she remained undeterred.\n \"You\u0027re pretty enough to seduce two men at once... I wonder how strong you are. Can you even swing that spear properly with those thin arms of yours?\"\n \"Unfortunately, you\u0027re not good looking yourself. Are you called the \u0027Spirit Sword\u0027 because of your dark face?\"\n \"What!?\"\n Right now, Ye Jin Jin was neither the childish junior hero nor Lee Shin Woo\u0027s girlfriend. She was the hero Izuna, who had taken her master\u0027s place due to his untimely death (The rumors regarding her, Lawrence, and Kay\u0027s three-way relationship were really convincing. And thus, the story that Izuna arose, angry at her lover\u0027s death, had originated from here).\n \"You impudent wench! You\u0027re just a peasant, yet you think you\u0027re able to go around the capital due to your affiliation with the religious orders. This is only because the Emperor allows it!\"\n \"I\u0027d rather you prove your skill with your sword, rather than your mouth. If possible, towards our enemy. Or is the Emperor content with waiting until the undead run rampant on the surface? Isn\u0027t that why we\u0027re fighting?\"\n \"Kuheum...\"\n And a hero must always be confident. Even if their opponent is a Heavenly Commander, who\u0027s representing the Emperor!\n Her level 9 battle dress, as well as the great spirit that resided within her, the level 8 Zenon, supplemented whatever she lacked. Though Kuroin had just recently been strengthened by the Emperor, he wouldn\u0027t be able to take her down!\n \u0027Damn it. Why do I, His Majesty\u0027s representative, have to worry about a mere wench!? And why do I have to act more cautiously around these peasants!\u0027\n But he had already been warned by the Emperor, as well as the Light General (who had warned him several times).\n If he were to fight Izuna here, then whether it was justified or not, it would result in the complete collapse of the royal family\u0027s power! The citizens had already sided with Izuna and the religious orders!\n \u0027Seagald Von Retadane, you bastard... How did you manage to unite so many humans in such a short period of time!?\u0027\n It was truly frustrating to admit, but Izuna was right. He would need to prove his abilities with his sword, not his mouth, against the invading undead.\n Only then would he be able to ensure the stability of the Emperor\u0027s rule.\n \"Alright. I\u0027ll do just that. I\u0027ll put you in your place! I represent the sovereign of this great Empire, the father of the nation, His Majesty! My words and actions are equivalent to His Majesty\u0027s!\"\n \"I hope you do. It doesn\u0027t matter to me, so long as the undead are all destroyed.\"\n It had been revealed early on that Izuna only pointed her flames at those who threatened the safety of the Empire.\n How great it was to sacrifice such dirty power to accomplish such a lofty goal! Her words had a profound effect on all those present!\n \"Uoooooooh! Lady Izuna!\"\n \"Lady Izuna will protect the capital, no, the entire Empire!\"\n \"Lady Izuna, Lawrence, and Sir Kay must be blessed by God!\"\n \"I\u0027ll believe in you, Lady Izuna!\"\n \"Hurray for the Sun God religion!\"\n \"Hurray for the Sun God religion!\"\n Their reactions were tremendous! Izuna inwardly smiled at the cries of the capital\u0027s citizens.\n This was the effect of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s lecture! What\u0027s worse, she had memorized Lee Shin Woo\u0027s screenplay and had just been following it, yet at this moment, her Command skill was growing!\n Then, the Pope of the Sun God religion approached her and whispered.\n \"You talk just like your master, Kay. ...I\u0027ll ask one last time You weren\u0027t in some sort of strange relationship with him, right? You might not want to hear it now, but keep this in mind. If we want to oust the Emperor and take control of the Empire, then we can\u0027t have a scandal like that. If you break up with Lawrence at the last minute, then things will become really complicated. You get it, right?\"\n \"Of course. I love Lawrence.\"\n \"Then... that\u0027s enough. I\u0027ll believe in you. Your relationship with Lawrence has to last a long time!\"\n \"Please don\u0027t worry, Pope.\"\n Lee Shin Woo was both Lawrence and Kay, so she wasn\u0027t lying! She grinned at the Pope, who was already looking past the battle and raised her head.\n \"Lady Izuna.\"\n \"Izuna...\"\n \"Please protect the Empire.\"\n \"Will she be able to do the same things Sir Kay could...?\"\n She locked gazes with countless people. There were those who trusted her, those who hated her, and even those who used her to project someone that wasn\u0027t here.\n But honestly, she didn\u0027t care about any of it. Ever since she\u0027d come to the surface, she\u0027d fought for only one man and one man only. And she would continue to do so until the very end.\n \"...Let\u0027s move out.\"\n The fake hero raised her voice and said.\n \"Today we restore peace within the Empire!\"\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-293","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
