Operation - Bro, why are you there? - 7\u003e [You have encountered a higher leveled foe. The Rebellion skill increases all skills by 14%! Half of the effects are shared with your subordinates!] Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t really thought about it very much, but Bone Armory pretty much stored all of his equipment in his body. All the recorded equipment didn\u0027t disappear, but instead became one with Lee Shin Woo; the equipment was also maintained by his body, and what\u0027s worse, developed in his body. He\u0027d absorbed countless pieces of equipment and stored them in his body, and fused different attributes together in order to create even greater equipment. Thus, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s body was like a treasure house. The moment any Treasure Hunter sensed his presence, it was obvious that they\u0027d turn their attention to him! Plus, Kratia\u0027s rare, growing artifact was enough to draw the Treasure Eater\u0027s attention as well. It made sense that a Treasure Eater would appear when both of these \u0027treasures\u0027 were in the same place. \"But why did he have to come now?\" Lee Shin Woo was sure this issue came about due to his terrible operation name, and grit his teeth. But while he stared vacantly at the Treasure Eater, the Treasure Eater continue to advance, sending parts of the undead force flying; thus, he didn\u0027t have any more time to spare. [What is that?] [The lord... Protect the lord!] [Kuahk, these monsters won\u0027t let us go!] The undead realized that Lee Shin Woo was the Treasure Eater\u0027s target and even in their confusion, attempted to stop it from getting to him. But because they were definitely categorized as \u0027enemies\u0027 by the Chimeras, they continued to tactlessly attack the undead troops, ultimately resulting in further undead casualties. [Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!] To make matters worse, Steve used the Treasure Eaters\u0027 patented technique, the Shriek of the Dead. Should he say \u0027as expected of a level 7\u0027? Its shriek instantaneously affected the entire area. [The enemy has used Shriek of the Dead! However, Invisible Heart has completely protected you against mental status ailments.] Lee Shin Woo momentarily did a double take and turned around. He was worried that Jin wouldn\u0027t be able to endure it, especially because he wasn\u0027t currently linked with him. Fortunately, Kratia had used her magic to protect both her and Jin from the shriek. As expected of a high level magician. [That monster\u0027s using black magic!] [Don\u0027t be afraid! The lord\u0027s watching over us!] [Let\u0027s stab its limbs with our spears!] \u0027The undead are also... Good, they\u0027re fine as well.\u0027 He had roughly expected this outcome. Firstly, his troops were under the effects of his Command skill, which protected them from status ailments, and secondly, his Instigate skill had already taken affect; both the Shriek of the Dead and Instigate were the same type of skill, but Shriek of the Dead was definitely a lower ranked skill than Instigate. Therefore, Shriek of the Dead wasn\u0027t very effective. [Ku-Kuhahk... Y-You bastards...!] [The Emperor? The Emperor is... No, I won\u0027t participate in it!] [Don\u0027t take me there. Not me...!] However, the Chimeras, who weren\u0027t protected by either Kratia or Lee Shin Woo, were affected by the Shriek of the Dead. While the Chimeras were physically enhanced to the very limit, they were susceptible to mental ailments and were all affected by the Treasure Eater\u0027s Shriek of the Dead. The deeper one\u0027s regret and resentment, the more effective Shriek of the Dead was. It was as though the Golem Chimeras were born to be affected by the Shriek of the Dead. [No, no. Don\u0027t nod your head! Don\u0027t!] [You can\u0027t. The Emperor lied to us!] [Please don\u0027t!] Were they remembering the time when they became sacrificial lambs for the experiments? The Chimeras cried tears of blood as they screamed and rolled onto the floor. Thousands of level 5 monsters had become unable to fight from just one skill! Lee Shin Woo felt a bit sad when he saw them, but because of the Treasure Eater, the undead army could now breathe easy. [It\u0027s time!] [Gouge its bones! Charge!] [Guoooooooooooh!] The undead troops suddenly pushed past the Chimeras and charged at the Treasure Eater! Lee Shin Woo shouted quickly in an attempt to stop their indiscriminate attack, but because of the sudden turn of the events, the undead weren\u0027t capable of properly accessing the situation. Ultimately, he couldn\u0027t stop half of them, and hundreds of undead rushed towards the Treasure Eater. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and had no other choice but to watch the ensuing battle. \u0027Now that it\u0027s come to this, I suppose I have to sacrifice them to find out my opponent\u0027s abilities...\u0027 He clearly remembered when he\u0027d first fought against the Treasure Eater, his desperate battle against the level 3 Treasure Eater, and even when he\u0027d fought against the level 5 Treasure Eater. Lee Shin Woo would get screwed whenever he encountered a Treasure Eater as it would always possess a unique ability. Plus, this Treasure Eater was level 7, so he wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it could teleport and take a bite out of his \u0027heart\u0027. [Guoooouuuuh!] And just as Lee Shin Woo expected, the Treasure Eater had a special ability. Fortunately, it wasn\u0027t teleportation, but when it screamed, hair fell off of its body; then, blue light seemed to spew from its body, which ended up being lightning! [Kuaaaaaaahk!] [M-My lord!] The Treasure Eater twisted its body, discharging lightning everywhere. The undead that came into direct contact with the lightning screamed, but they were better off than the rest. The weaker level 4 and level 5 undead couldn\u0027t even scream before they vanished. Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth at the power that the level 7 elite displayed. He was frustrated at how it seemed no weaker despite using such an attack. \u0027I barely got control over this army, yet they become a barbecued bone platter in the blink of an eye...!\u0027 It didn\u0027t matter whether it was against a level 1 skeleton or a level 5 skeleton; there wasn\u0027t much difference between how long it would take for it to grill them anyway. Therefore, it would be stupid to just stand still and do nothing. Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d inwardly made his decision, used his Instigate skill to its very limit and yelled. [All troops, retreat! We\u0027ll fight him in the city!] [B-But my lord...!] [All forces! Protect Kadinan!] [I... I understand!] None could refute Lee Shin Woo\u0027s stern command, and all of the undead there turned around. Their movements were so organized and systematic that... Lee Shin Woo\u0027s movement, or lack thereof was quite noticeable. [M-My lord!?] \"His target\u0027s me.\" Lee Shin Woo said bravely. \"I\u0027ll keep him busy, so you return to the city and evacuate all of the civilians from the city. Once I\u0027m sure that everyone has been evacuated, I\u0027ll bring him over.\" [It\u0027s too dangerous, my lord!] [I cannot allow it!] \"You dare doubt me!?\" Lee Shin Woo\u0027s booming voice even startled the most powerful undead in Kadinan, the Knight Leader, Selloin. Of course, Lee Shin Woo was the lord he served and was a level 6 Undead Commander, but the Knight Leader had thought that his abilities surpassed the lord’s. However, once the Knight Leader heard the strength in Lee Shin Woo’s voice, he realized that that might not necessarily be the case. \"Go now. Even now, our precious soldiers are being sacrificed! You fool, I don\u0027t plan on dying in vain. Kadinan and I are one. I will not fall, so long as Kadinan stays standing!\" [M-My lord..!] [Kuheuk, as expected of the lord we serve...!] The Knight Leader, as well as the surrounding knights, were touched by Lee Shin Woo\u0027s brave declaration and were on the verge of tears. He\u0027d managed to fool them completely. Though Lee Shin Woo was planning on destroying Kadinan in its entirety so that he could safely annihilate the Treasure Eater! \"Go. Go tell them. Arm yourselves and be ready to die for Kadinan!\" [All the citizens will follow your command!] [My lord. At least let me stay by your side...] \"You fool. Only you can command in my absence! Don\u0027t say anything so foolish and go!\" [Keuk... I understand! I will carry out your command perfectly, I swear it!] Even as he cursed at him, Lee Shin Woo reminded the Knight Leader that he was the next in command and that he had to be responsible for the troops in the lord\u0027s absence; his words spurred him to act, causing the Knight Leader\u0027s eyes to blaze with a bit of goblin fire and turn around. Even the undead that had been indiscriminately attacking the Treasure Eater began to assemble to the best of their ability. At least 20% of the troops had been burnt to crisp already, but it was comforting that most of their casualties were level 4s. [Guaaaaaaaaaah!] Of course, from the very beginning, the Treasure Eater\u0027s target had been Lee Shin Woo and Lee Shin Woo alone. Therefore, when the obstructing skeletons got out of its way on their own accord, it seemed thankful and beelined towards Lee Shin Woo. Some of the knights couldn\u0027t help themselves and turned around, drawing their swords, but Lee Shin Woo restrained them once more. \"I won\u0027t say it again! Go!\" Lee Shin Woo said, and once he raised his sword in one hand, they resigned themselves and turned around. It seemed like it hadn\u0027t occurred to them that they had never seen that sword before. \"Now let\u0027s see how good a lightning element monster is...!\" Once he confirmed that the undead troops had fully retreated, Lee Shin Woo moved his body quickly and infused mana into the Lightning Tooth, as if to lure in the Treasure Eater. Lee Shin Woo transformed all of his mana, which was at a frightening level, into pure lightning and infused it into the Lightning Tooth. The blade was covered in flickering blue sparks, and looked as though God had sent this lightning herself. Seeing that, the Treasure Eater snorted and opened its mouth. [Guuuuuuoooooooooh!] \"Heup!\" A lightning sphere popped out of its mouth! But because Lee Shin Woo had already figured out that its mana was mainly concentrated in its throat, he had already expected what kind of attack was coming beforehand. Lee Shin Woo threw his body out of the way, dodging the sphere, and forcefully shot out with the Lightning Tooth in turn. [Kihahk!] With Rule of Bone, it seemed like the Lightning Tooth actually shot out at the speed of lightning, and burrowed into the Treasure Eater\u0027s throat before it could close its mouth. Once it became level 7, it became like some sort of dragon, as it had attained thick and durable scales. Even so, its inner organs had to be much less durable than its scales! Lee Shin Woo immediately exploded the Lightning Tooth, and funnily enough, despite it being level 7, it writhed in pain and made one full rotation on the floor. [Kihaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!] \"Keuk!?\" But that was all. Though it should be in a considerable amount of pain, as well as sustaining severe injuries from the lightning covered blade and the resulting explosion, the momentarily moaning Treasure Eater immediately regained its posture and charged straight at Lee Shin Woo! \"Come out, fortress!\" Lee Shin Woo, startled by the Treasure Eater\u0027s unexpected speed, summoned a giant shield from Bone Armory (the reason he\u0027d shouted so loudly was because he wanted to), placed it in front of him, and retreated. The giant shield, which was embedded into the ground and created by weaving giant bones together in strands, truly looked like a fortress. [Bone Fortress] [Lv5] [Durability - 2,250/2,250] [Defense - 1,200 - 1,400] [Options - Effectiveness of defense +50%] Whether one looked at the level, the ridiculous amount of defense, or its even more ridiculous option, there was no way this couldn\u0027t be considered a treasure! He\u0027d gotten this shield from killing one of his undead seniors, but once it had been absorbed into his Bone Armory, it had been remodeled. Of course, it was an item that was bestowed upon a hero by God, but... [Kuaaaaaaaaah!] \"Uuuuuuhk!\" The shield couldn\u0027t even withstand the Treasure Eater\u0027s charge for 1 second and broke apart! It had become weaker after smashing through the Bone Fortress, but its charge still retained an absurd amount of power; it got close and almost hit Lee Shin Woo. The resulting force flung him several meters, and left him with no other option but to endure the pain. In pain, Lee Shin Woo diligently restored his body and thought. \u0027Damn, this is... 100%.\u0027 He hadn\u0027t expected it to recover from the shock and charge so quickly. Now he was sure. The Treasure Eater possessed Lightning Resistance. It had the full package! He had a hunch when it had unleashed its lightning, but now that it’d come to this, he could say that he was sure now. \u0027It can\u0027t be helped. I have to take it down.\u0027 He was thinking about how he could somehow lead it somewhere else whilst finishing up all his business here, but upon realizing that it had something he wanted, he knew he had to take it down. \"This probably won\u0027t be enough...\" Nothing good would come of him leading it to the city. Even if he did, the undead would just be sacrificed to reduce its mana. That\u0027s all. But even taking that into consideration, it wasn\u0027t enough to take down a level 7 elite. Even if he added in the Chimeras, which were rolling around, as well as Kratia and Jin, who were behind him on standby, it wouldn\u0027t work. \"Then.\" Lee Shin Woo evaded its next attack and hectically moved his body around; he steeled himself and took out a small marble-like object. This was the obvious course of action. Since there was an opponent he couldn\u0027t beat with his plan... \"The Lightning General, the great sword of the Empire. I, Nellopa, the Empire\u0027s loyal servant, have an urgent report for you.\" Then he just needed to make a new plan!
