How\u0027s that even possible? After the last mass release, there were only a few dozen bottles found across the Empire.\" News of the auction spread quickly. Lee Shin Woo would\u0027ve considered it a success if news of the auction had spread to the hundreds of thousands of people in Kuroa\u0027s Glory, but he had miscalculated. Was it due to the Sun God religion\u0027s help? In just two days, the lord and all the nobles had become aware of the auction, and by the fourth day, news of the auction had spread to the nearby cities. \"But the master sommeliers already took a look at them. Moreover, the Sun God religion is backing it, so there\u0027s no way they\u0027d lie.\" \"The Sun God religion is really particular about their wine due to the pope. If they\u0027re willing to sponsor this auction, then... Wait a sec. They\u0027re transporting 1,500 bottles of wine and are backed by the Sun God religion. Who exactly are they?\" \"Lawrence. I\u0027ve never heard of him before, but it seems like he\u0027s quite skilled.\" \"Hmm. He\u0027s probably being manipulated by the Sun God religion, rather than being skilled. If the auction goes well for them, then the other religions will feel uneasy.\" Kerr Century Wine had a lot more influence on the surface than Lee Shin Woo had expected. Rumors had spread far and wide across the Magic Empire through the use of nimble-footed merchants and a communication line. At the same time, people quickly became aware of Lawrence, the Sun God religion, and the hero Kay as well. \"Don\u0027t be surprised by what I say next. I hear that the Kerr Century that they\u0027re selling... was created after the fall of the Underground Empire.\" \"Wait, that means...\" \"It means the Sun God religion has procured a Kerr Century Winery! But how?\" In the official announcement, Lawrence had procured the Kerr Century Winery\u0027s facilities and techniques, but the rumors were misrepresenting the facts. They thought that, perhaps, the Sun God religion had access to the Underground Empire and that the Underground Empire may not have fallen. Most snorted at these rumors, but there were some who actually took the news to heart. It was nothing more than suspicion without a shred of evidence, but because of this distortion of the facts, it practically guaranteed that the rumors would spread even further, causing the high ranking officials to take action. Not only that, but the other religions became curious... Ultimately, the size of the auction, as well as the participants had swelled to an enormous size. \"I did want the high ranking officials to take notice of me, but if this goes on, playing a dual role may become impossible for me.\" \u0027Can\u0027t you just leave it to the merchants you signed a contract with? You planned on using them as your proxy from the start.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo anguished, but then, he heard Jin\u0027s voice through the Assimilation skill. Though he was tied outside of his lodgings, his voice could still be relayed through the Assimilation skill. \"A proxy, huh... They\u0027re too weak.\" Lee Shin Woo pondered seriously. Of course, Lawrence could easily pull back for safety reasons and use the merchants as his proxy, but he wasn\u0027t sure whether he could find people he could trust enough to talk in his place. \u0027How about asking the Sun God religion?\u0027 \"I can\u0027t let them take over anymore. No matter what others think, we have to take the reins. So...\" Lee Shin Woo briefly thought about it and soon made a decision. He\u0027d already considered this before. It would be such a waste to not use the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. Couldn\u0027t he just bring a trustworthy human to the surface? \u0027A human you can trust... Kratia?\u0027 \"Kratia would be really happy, but she\u0027s in the middle of special training with Prince, so she can\u0027t leave. I\u0027d rather not bother her right now.\" Although they were acting separately now, he contacted her once every week. He had left the Huginn\u0027s Eye to her, and she was simultaneously studying magic and the artifact. \u0027Ah, that\u0027s right. Then who? ...You\u0027re not going to ask Retadane, are you?\u0027 \"Why would she even come up? You never know when she\u0027ll blow.\" \u0027It looked like you guys really got along.\u0027 Why was this happening? For the past few days Jin seemed to be in a good mood, yet his voice was turning melancholy again. Did he hate Retadane or something? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and refuted him. \"No way. There are only two choices for her. I either reform her and use her as an ally, or I take her out before something goes wrong. The whole reason I even talked to her was because of that decision.\" \u0027Really...?\u0027 \"Yeah, so don\u0027t worry about her too much. I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027m supposed to get closer to that psychopath though...\" \u0027Then it\u0027s fine.\u0027 Jin replied as though a burden had been lifted. It seemed like he\u0027d misunderstood, thinking that Lee Shin Woo actually trusted Retadane. Lee Shin Woo felt relieved, and Jin took that time to ask another question. \u0027Wait a sec. So who are you going to pick then? You wouldn\u0027t pick Lloyd.\u0027 \"There\u0027s only one person that\u0027ll work. Ye Jin Jin.\" \u0027Ah, that\u0027s right. Jin Jin. Yeah, she\u0027d be fine.\u0027 Jin must\u0027ve completely forgotten about her, but Lee Shin Woo acted like he didn\u0027t notice. \"It\u0027s easy to deal with Ye Jin Jin. She trusts anything I say, and she knows about our identities, so we don\u0027t need to hide anything from her.\" \u0027Remember. You shouldn\u0027t say that a woman is \u0027easy to deal with\u0027. Don\u0027t treat her pure love and faith in you as a tool.\u0027 \"M-My bad.\" Lee Shin Woo politely apologized in response to Jin\u0027s sound rebuttal and requested a private chat with Ye Jin Jin. If she wasn\u0027t fighting or sleeping, then she would immediately... [Ye Jin Jin: Yes, Mr. Shin Woo!?] \"Fast...\" [Ye Jin Jin: Your voice is still so cool!] Yeah, that\u0027s why he didn\u0027t want to contact her first. She\u0027d definitely met him when he was a skeleton, so he couldn\u0027t understand why she liked him more and more. Maybe she was romanticizing Lee Shin Woo in her imagination more and more, so her feelings had grown. Well, that\u0027s what he assumed at least. Her feelings were so clear that even Lee Shin Woo, who was no expert in relationships, could tell how she felt about him. However, those feelings were incredibly burdensome to him, as he felt no sexual desire. A part of him was uneasy at the thought of meeting her, and the other part hoped she would snap out of it when they actually met again. \"There\u0027s something I wanted to ask you...\" [Ye Jin Jin: Something you\u0027d like to ask me? What is it!? Whatever it is, I\u0027ll do it!] \"...Mm, yeah. Thanks.\" How taxing! As he thought, his best bet would be for them to meet so her feelings for him would abate. Lee Shin Woo hated himself for not doing this sooner and told her about his plans. Ye Jin Jin was obviously excited at the prospect of meeting face-to-face, and marked her coordinates for Lee Shin Woo. Fortunately, he recalled passing her location, so he felt like he\u0027d be able to get there quickly with the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. [Ye Jin Jin: I can\u0027t leave here for the time being, so please take your time. Ah, it\u0027s the level 2 danger zone, but you have to be careful on your way here.] Following the heroes\u0027 battle with the 12 generals, it seemed as though the undead had become more violent; if she couldn\u0027t find a dungeon, then it would be difficult for her to hunt monsters, so she was hiding for the time being. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head, promised he\u0027d come and find her right away, and ended the chat. \"Hoo.\" Immediately after, a sigh naturally came out. Of course, he didn\u0027t have lungs, so no breath actually came out. \"What do I do? I don\u0027t want to meet her...\" \u0027She\u0027d cry if she heard you say that.\u0027 \"But I guess I have to go anyway... I\u0027ll leave behind a simple message here for now.\" They were currently living in a house they\u0027d bought within Kuroa\u0027s Glory. A week after he\u0027d signed the contract with the Pope, they finished their first expedition. The conquered dungeon was simple. It consisted of mostly level 5s, with level 6 elites occasionally popping up, but the dungeon had a bad reputation, as there were several monsters that could use poison or acid type status ailments strong enough to even kill level 7 knights or magicians. However, Lee Shin Woo was covered in flames, and those flames burned away the acid and poison. He charged through the dungeon like a bulldozer and pushed his way through from the start to the finish (the boss room). All the paladins and priests did was pick up the loot. Rather than feeling dispirited, they responded with \u0027He truly is the one bestowed with the Sun God\u0027s power!\u0027 and looked at him with sparkling eyes. \"At latest, I should take a day, but they may come to find me before then. It should be fine if I just write that I went out with Lawrence for a bit.\" \u0027They might misunderstand if you write that.\u0027 \"Huh...?\" Jin didn\u0027t explain any further, so Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t change his message and stuck it to the front door. Because at least 90% of the language used on the surface and underground were the same, he could write without difficulty (due to God\u0027s help). \"Then, I\u0027ll be back, Jin.\" \"You\u0027re going without me?\" \"Yeah. I\u0027m pretty fast now too. I was going to bring a couple of other guys with me along the way. It might be boring, but just wait patiently for me.\" \"Hey, if you\u0027re going to do that, then at least let me out of the city.\" \"I suppose there\u0027s no danger out there since you\u0027re a veteran level 7. Alright, let\u0027s go.\" Level 6 bones didn\u0027t really have any effect on Lee Shin Woo, since his stats had surpassed 10,000, but for Jin, whose agility had developed much more than his other stats, they would still have an effect on his Strength, Health, or Magic. So Lee Shin Woo had given him most of the bones that he\u0027d acquired on the surface, and as a result, Jin had gotten to 8,000 total stats. \"Don\u0027t be late. And make sure you don\u0027t encounter another one of the 12 generals and kill them.\" \"It depends on which of the 12 generals it is, but I got it.\" \"You lie all the time, so why are you only honest when it doesn\u0027t matter?\" \"Then, see you tomorrow!\" After Lee Shin Woo had left Jin to \u0027graze\u0027 outside the city (if Jin knew how he\u0027d described it, then it wouldn\u0027t end with him just giving him another \u0027rodeo\u0027), he took a deep breath and activated the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. Contrary to when it was the Bone Gate, the Heaven Door\u0027s Key used both bones and mana to activate. Ironically, a single activation lessened the strain immensely. Moreover, he\u0027d acquired a ton of bones that he couldn\u0027t use on the surface, so he would be able to activate it as much as he wanted. [You have become more familiar with the Heaven Door\u0027s Key. Five people can now accompany you.] \u0027Nice. We\u0027re going underground.\u0027 The light flashed and then Lee Shin Woo arrived at his designated coordinates. He\u0027d arrived in the level 2 danger zone and with his speed, he could group up with Ye Jin Jin in just 3 minutes! Once he\u0027d gotten out of the tunnel of light, he quickly looked around and looked for anything that might be dangerous. Then, he nodded his head in satisfaction and moved his feet. \u0027As expected, the more I use the Heaven Door\u0027s Key, the less its functions are limited. Five people can accompany me, excluding myself, so six people can go through it now. It went up by two all of a sudden.\u0027 Honestly, he didn\u0027t need it that many. He wondered whether he should\u0027ve brought Jin along or not, but it was already water under the bridge, so there was nothing he could do about it. \u0027For the time being, let\u0027s keep this a secret from Jin,\u0027 Lee Shin Woo inwardly muttered and quickened his pace. He soon arrived at the entrance to a hidden cave. \"Ye Jin Jin, are you there?\" \"Yes, Mr. Shin Woo...!?\" Was she waiting for him? When he called for her, she appeared right away. Her equipment had changed since they\u0027d last met and she assumed a pose befitting a veteran hero, but she still gave off the impression of a junior hero, perhaps because she was a girl. Her impression didn’t change, but... \"Y-You look cool.\" \"Ah.\" Lee Shin Woo then realized that he was still disguised in his human form. If he wanted to get her out of her shell, then he\u0027d have to work a little harder from now on.
