It\u0027s a pleasure to meet you. You must\u0027ve suffered so much to reach where you are without dying. Thank you for surviving.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to meet you too... Senior Retadane.\"\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n Red eyes and red hair. Lee Shin Woo had only seen one person with those traits thus far: the beauty from the secret shop (if he told her, she would be happy and smile unpleasantly, so he had no plans of telling her), Pleine.\\n\\n Although God herself possessed red hair as well, her eyes glittered in the five cardinal colors, so he excluded her.\\n\\n \"Are you bothered by my hair?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s...\"\\n\\n But now there was one other with those specific traits: Seira Von Retadane. She was so unbelievably beautiful that she almost didn\u0027t fit in with everyone else.\\n\\n There was no hint of confusion within her clear red eyes, and her pale pink lips were closed shut, seemingly embodying her iron will. Contrary to her cold expression, her ardent, long red hair fluttered in the wind, as if it would catch aflame at any moment.\\n\\n \"My apologies, Senior. I was just wondering whether you gain red hair for becoming a priest.\"\\n\\n \"...I see. That\u0027s obviously not true.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you don\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t. My red eyes and hair are hereditary traits.\"\\n\\n She was baby-faced, looking like a young girl, but also voluptuous. He was concerned that their size would become a hindrance on the battlefield but thought her bust and narrow waist were striking.\\n\\n The white priest robe she wore couldn\u0027t hide her voluptuous figure. If he were to take a picture of her, others would react with \u0027this is definitely photoshopped\u0027. They would say \u0027she must be an alien, not a human being with a bust that large and a waist that thin\u0027, but she was definitely the real deal.\\n\\n She must be a mutant. Lee Shin Woo was very slightly in awe of her.\\n\\n \u0027I can understand how Shino Rendu fell in love with her at first sight. Of course, it doesn\u0027t matter to me, but there\u0027s something else that bothers me...\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s sexual desire had evaporated, but he could still recognize beauty. However, Lee Shin Woo was currently only worried about keeping his guard up against her. He was sure the moment he met her. This girl was level 8. He had somewhat expected it, but she was indeed level 8!\\n\\n \"I feel like you could take down one or two of the 12 generals by yourself, Senior.\"\\n\\n \"I think so too. However, there\u0027s no guarantee after that. Because of that, I don\u0027t want to make any large moves yet. My goal isn\u0027t the 12 generals. It\u0027s eradicating all the undead in the Empire. Therefore, there\u0027s so much I want to say to Ethan Cruz, but...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo carelessly blurted out, and Seira Von Retadane replied seriously. She sounded so serious, causing Lee Shin Woo to think. She didn\u0027t know, but Lee Shin Woo had already killed two of the 12 generals.\\n\\n But was that a mistake? ...Of course it wasn\u0027t. Lee Shin Woo had merely picked what was most advantageous to him at the time. When this was all over, he would have to move more carefully than before. Though it might\u0027ve been too little too late.\\n\\n \"Hoo, let\u0027s begin when Yasunori Akira comes and joins us. Would you like some tea?\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Senior.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to tell you this before, but... I don\u0027t really like being referred to as \u0027senior\u0027. Please just call me Retadane.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, ok.\"\\n\\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo, as an undead, couldn\u0027t drink tea, but he could at least fake it. He would let it go down his throat and then evaporate it with fire.\\n\\n \"Please wait a little bit.\"\\n\\n She removed various tools to make tea from her inventory. Lee Shin Woo watched as she boiled water for her tea, and came to the realization that she was no ordinary hero. Who would go through all that trouble to steep tea leaves!?\\n\\n Moreover, one couldn\u0027t procure tea leaves from the Empire, which meant that she acquired them from the secret shop... By comparing it to wine, it was clear how inordinately expensive such an item of personal preference was.\\n\\n \"Here, please enjoy.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you. With pleasure.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was surprised when he grabbed onto the tea cup. He didn\u0027t have a sense of taste, but for some unknown reason, he was able to smell the fragrance of the tea.\\n\\n A fragrance so pleasant that it was shocking. He would often have to meet with other people for work, so he had drunk a variety of different teas, but it was of such quality that he could easily say it was the best he\u0027d ever had.\\n\\n \"It smells really nice.\"\\n\\n \"This tea didn\u0027t exist in my world. It\u0027s delicious.\"\\n\\n \"Hoo, you can appreciate good tea. It\u0027s my favorite tea amongst all the ones available on the surface. I assume it\u0027s made by using the Kunoa leaf (which is grown in places with powerful fire magic) and Korite leaf (which is grown in places with powerful wind magic)...\"\\n\\n How can this be? To think she\u0027d continue the conversation! Lee Shin Woo was shocked as she, who had remained passive and calm, suddenly began to talk about the tea leaves and the water in depth.\\n\\n At the same time, he couldn\u0027t help but see the resemblance with Pleine, who would change whenever he brought up wine...! Lee Shin Woo was curious and asked.\\n\\n \"...Are you close to the shopkeeper by any chance?\"\\n\\n \"No, that woman\u0027s the worst. That\u0027s quite rude of you to say.\"\\n\\n \"I-I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n She cussed out Pleine! Now that he thought about it, Pleine had a lot of things to say about her as well. Moreover, she had the same red eyes and red hair...\\n\\n At that moment, Lee Shin Woo formed a hypothesis. However, when he saw Retadane\u0027s expression, which had turned frigid instantaneously, he knew that this wouldn\u0027t be easy to bring up. But fortunately, that vibe didn\u0027t continue for very long. Yasunori Akira had arrived.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m late. Sorry about that. I was moving so cautiously that it just turned out that way.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine. Would you like some tea?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, of course. ...Mm, the fragrance reminds me of my homeland.\"\\n\\n \"Hello, Senior.\"\\n\\n \"Mm!? Ah, is that you, Lee Shin Woo? ...That\u0027s surprising. You look a lot different than what I\u0027d expected. I\u0027m Yasunori Akira.\"\\n\\n He possessed black eyes and black hair, giving off the feeling of an Asian man, but even so, he didn\u0027t really evoke the feeling of being Japanese.\\n\\n Then again, when he\u0027d met Ye Jin Jin last, he felt like she was a lot taller and had nigh-white skin, unlike other Chinese people. It was the same feeling. Perhaps they both came from a world similar but ultimately different from his own Earth.\\n\\n \"Thanks for the tea. ...So you already knew about this dungeon, huh.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a dungeon that I cleared by myself in the past. There are dungeons that disappear after they\u0027re cleared and dungeons which remain, due to the large traces of residual magic. This is the latter.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. They were gathered inside of a dungeon within the level 3 danger zone right now. Dungeons are normally filled with danger, but ironically, empty dungeons were the safest place that heroes could reside.\\n\\n \"Now that the Heaven Defying General has gone on a rampage... I might have to find a dungeon and hide too.\"\\n\\n \"The Heaven Defying General... I wonder if he\u0027s connected with Ethan Cruz as well.\"\\n\\n \"He probably isn\u0027t. The Heaven Defying General isn\u0027t doing Ethan Cruz any favors in baiting the 12 generals and gathering the other heroes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true. I realized that Ethan Cruz\u0027s movements were strange because of it, but... Shall we begin talking in earnest? Regarding what Ethan Cruz is plotting.\"\\n\\n Retadane said seriously, and Yasunori nodded his head stiffly. They wanted to protect their juniors and took their jobs as seniors seriously, so Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t tell them that he \u0027actually had his own corps and that while they kept the 12 generals busy, we can take care of Ethan Cruz\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t tell them my true identity, let alone the fact that I lead the undead, or things will go wrong fast.\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo sighed and decided to go with the flow. They started off with the Beast General, Jilun Pelta, went on to Ethan Cruz\u0027s plans that he may or may not have, as well as any other unknown variables. They told the \u0027human hero Lee Shin Woo\u0027 all this information, believing that it was safe to tell him all this.\\n\\n \"At first glance, this looks like a good place to fight against the Beast General, but if there\u0027s a foe that is unhindered by the mountain range, there\u0027s a high chance that the heroes will be stabbed in the back.\"\\n\\n \"A foe that is unhindered by the environment... Lee Shin Woo, do you have any guesses?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s one of the 12 generals or not, but I took down an undead mounting a flying monster just a little while ago.\"\\n\\n \"A flying monster, undead... Ha.\"\\n\\n Retadane gritted her teeth, as though it suddenly clicked.\\n\\n \"The Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle...!\"\\n\\n His title was \u0027Vulture\u0027, so why was his family name \u0027Golden Eagle\u0027!? Lee Shin Woo anguished over that irony, and Retadane gave them the answer.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s bald. The Emperor thought it was funny and gave him that title, but he doesn\u0027t like his title very much. Amongst the 12 generals, he\u0027s probably the one who hates being called their title the most.\"\\n\\n \"I see...\"\\n\\n So that\u0027s how it was. He suddenly felt sympathetic and became fond of the Vulture General. But when he asked Retadane why she had such detailed information on him, she said...\\n\\n \"It probably worries you. ...Yasunori Akira, isn\u0027t it the same for you as well?\"\\n\\n \"It does worry me, but I\u0027d rather not force someone to talk when they clearly don\u0027t want to.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s alright. I feel like I\u0027ll work closely with you in the future, so I\u0027ll just tell you and move on. Since I\u0027d rather not experience Ethan Cruz\u0027s foolish taunt ever again...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s ears perked up. However, Kratia, who never went into the chatting channel, didn\u0027t know what was going on and tilted her head. Then, she revealed a bombshell.\\n\\n \"Seagald Von Retadane is my older brother.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n \"...?\"\\n\\n He knew that Seira was a descendant of the Retadane family, but he hadn\u0027t expected her to be Seagald\u0027s younger sister. Lee Shin Woo remained silent at her unimaginable confession, and Yasunori was likewise silent, as he couldn\u0027t comprehend what she was saying for a brief period of time. However, Kratia informally spoke.\\n\\n \"An old lady?\"\\n\\n \"Hey!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s alright. If you take into account my age, that actually fits. ...I am one of the few citizens of the Empire that survived on Sun Day, [1] and I am also the first hero picked by God. Of course, at the time, I was only level 2...\"\\n\\n \"Level 2...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine what she went through to go from level 2 to level 8. Moreover, she had to survive in the Empire with a living body!\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know if Retadane knew how they were feeling or not, but she remained calm as always.\\n\\n \"But most importantly, I\u0027m a hero. And my brother, Seagald Von Retadane, is undead now. I promise you that I won\u0027t hesitate when facing him. Eliminating all the undead and purifying the Empire is not just God\u0027s will, but my own as well.\"\\n\\n Retadane said firmly. It would be impossible to \u0027ask her about Anti-Skull\u0027. She likely knew what Anti-Skull represented. Despite that, she would still say that Seagald was undead now and that he had to be eliminated.\\n\\n \"Now then, let\u0027s go back to our main topic. There\u0027s a high chance that the Vulture General, Bureuche Von Golden Eagle, will show up. There\u0027ll be enough forces to sow chaos amongst the heroes. So I\u0027ll protect the heroes while you (Yasunori)...\"\\n\\n Their war council continued for another few hours. Because of them, Lee Shin Woo knew how he would have to mobilize his army; so he hadn\u0027t lost out.\\n\\n Two days later, the participants of the 12 general hunt had gathered in one place.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Day of the Sun or Sun Day. Not Sunday.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-176","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
