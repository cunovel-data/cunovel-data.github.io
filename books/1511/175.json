Heaven Defying General - 7\u003e A few days before their scheduled hunt of one of the 12 generals, the heroes were discussing an unexpected topic inside the chatting channel. [Lloyd H.K.: The Heaven Defying General. It fits him. After all, he\u0027s going around destroying cities. What exactly is his goal...] [Ye Jin Jin: We talked about this before. That there were undead who acted against the Emperor...] [Prince Altania: That doesn\u0027t prove anything.] [Ye Jin Jin: But still... if there was an undead like that, wouldn\u0027t they cooperate with us? If our goals are the same, we can form an alliance with them.] Before he entered the chatting channel, Lee Shin Woo told Ye Jin Jin that he was that Heaven Defying General. He\u0027d told her without hesitating, as she already knew he was undead. After that, Ye Jin Jin tried her best to keep the other heroes from looking at him, or the Heaven Defying General too negatively. However, that wasn\u0027t the easiest job in the world. [Seira Von Retadane: It\u0027s meaningless. All undead are the same. They\u0027re the enemy of all humans.] [Ethan Cruz: It\u0027s a tough problem. Since all the undead in the Empire are obsessed with the living. Even if it looks like they\u0027re intelligent, they revert to their undead nature when it matters most. Cooperating, huh. How can you trust him enough to cooperate with him?] How shameless could he be to say something like that, when he himself was a Necromancer who controlled undead heroes. Lee Shin Woo spared his breath. Then, Seira Von Retadane even more forcefully expressed her opinion. [Seira Von Retadane: This is the only thing Ethan and I agree on. It\u0027s impossible to form an alliance with the undead. Not only do the undead defy God, but they\u0027re also impurities of this world. Regardless of whether they\u0027re the other 12 generals or the Heaven Defying General, if they appear before you, you must kill them.] [Ye Jin Jin: Still...] [Erian Ruparte: I understand how you feel, Jin Jin. However, even I think that it would be impossible to cooperate with the undead. There\u0027s something you need to consider before relying on them. Can you really trust them to watch your back?] [Silene Viesa: It doesn\u0027t make sense to form an alliance with the undead. Senior Ye Jin Jin, are you really a hero? You should know, as you\u0027ve fought against the undead before. They cannot coexist with us. If they could, then would God have given us the order to purify them?] Although Silene Viesa was the most recent hero, they had adapted to the Empire extremely quickly, as a result of fighting against the undead. Silene Viesa had done more in the Empire than Ye Jin Jin, and sometimes, they looked down on Ye Jin Jin. [Lloyd H.K.: Silene, that\u0027s enough. Of course, I agree with you, but...] [Prince Altania: Mm... Right?] [Lloyd H.K.: What\u0027s with you?] [Prince Altania: It\u0027s nothing. That\u0027s obvious. Mmm... I\u0027ve never met an undead like that before, but I\u0027m sure that that Heaven Defying General bastard has something else up his sleeve.] [Seira Von Retadane: I think he\u0027s out of our league right now, so we should avoid him for now. ...Ethan Cruz, are you still going to proceed with your plan, despite everything that has happened?] [Ethan Cruz: I think we should proceed because of what has happened. It\u0027ll become more difficult to hunt the 12 generals if the Empire\u0027s movements change, so shouldn\u0027t we go for it before then? With that in mind... everyone listen up. I\u0027ve finalized the time, place, and the target. I know the way his troops are moving, so I plan on attacking first. I\u0027ll send the participants the location right away.] [Prince Altania: Ooooh!] [Silene Viesa: Keuk, I want to go too...] Was it finally beginning? Despite an unknown force, the Heaven Defying General showing up in the Empire, it seemed like Ethan planned on going through with his plan. Soon, Lee Shin Woo was contacted by Ethan Cruz. [Ethan Cruz: I believe in you, Super Rookie!] [Lee Shin Woo: I believe in you too, Senior.] [Ethan Cruz: Haha, flattery won\u0027t work.] The battleground was a northeast area in the level 3 danger zone and was quite close to the level 4 danger zone, but because of the perilous mountain range behind it, there was a small possibility of enemies showing up. It would be in three days at dusk when the Empire\u0027s artificial sun became dim. Their target was the level 7 Beast General. Since Lee Shin Woo had never heard of him before, he assumed that Ethan Cruz had indeed picked the weakest amongst the 12 generals. \u0027The issue is whether this is all he has up his sleeve. The fact that he picked the grasslands right under a mountain range means that something is coming from across the mountains... Wait, could it be the Vulture General?\u0027 A light bulb went off in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s head. An air force was plenty enough to stab the heroes in the back, and it explained why the Vulture General merely observed him, rather than fighting him. The Vulture General needed to capture the heroes, so he couldn\u0027t waste his forces on Lee Shin Woo. Moreover, the city which sent a report, as well as where the Vulture General had sent his scouts, was the city that Ethan Cruz was talking about! \u0027Despite the fact that I gave them enough time to send a report, the other two cities didn\u0027t and just fell...\u0027 Not all of the undead lords possessed a communication line to a general in case of an enemy attack. Even if they had one, they wouldn\u0027t always report to their superiors right away. Although they were incredibly loyal to the Empire and followed the Emperor\u0027s commands to the letter, some of them were incredibly laidback. \u0027There was also that lord who talked about the Golden Shadow, who had it strapped to his waist.\u0027 But they had made it so that those two cities\u0027 reports wouldn\u0027t go through. Why? When he thought about the place Ethan Cruz had picked, it all became clear. It seemed like he picked a spot furthest from where the Heaven Defying General was seen last so that he wouldn\u0027t interfere. But it would only take about half a day for the Paul Zero Corps to get there from where they were hidden. \"If I use my Command skill, then we could get there even quicker, but... Sorry I can\u0027t lead you myself.\" [You empower us just by existing, Paul Zero! It may be difficult, but we\u0027ll get there in 4 hours no matter what!] \"Really? I\u0027d really appreciate it if you came.\" Did the effect of his Command skill increase that much from reaching the high rank level? In any case, it was better than them staying in a far off place where they would be of no help to him. He patted Chi Paul\u0027s shoulder, who had reassuringly replied to him and stood upright. \"Now, shall we get going and meet Retadane?\" \"I guess it\u0027ll get busy now...\" \"It\u0027s not too bad. Just be cautious of those you have to be cautious of, and kill anyone you have to kill. That\u0027s all you have to do.\" Lee Shin Woo sat Kratia behind him atop Jin\u0027s back. Once he\u0027d looked over his forces one last time, he looked at the sky, even though he knew that there weren\u0027t any scouts in the sky through Rem. \"The Vulture General, huh... I guess we\u0027ll end up facing him after all.\" \"You have a good idea, Kratia?\" \"If you attach wings to Jin, then we can take care of him ourselves.\" \"Hey, don\u0027t put anything on me!\" Lee Shin Woo ignored the quarreling Jin and Kratia and worked on something he\u0027d been postponing. Training the level 6 staff, the Bone Winged Serpent\u0027s skill: Serpent\u0027s Whirlwind. \"Hoo... I should get a feel for this before I meet Retadane.\" \"You\u0027re going to try it out?\" \"Yeah.\" Seira Von Retadane. Apparently, she wielded light magic. Light magic was like poison to the undead, and it was a power that every hero wanted. If it was truly the opposite of the darkness element, or in other words, the ability to \u0027end relationships\u0027, then it made sense that its severing ability would be fatal against the undead. After all, all undead bodies and minds, which should\u0027ve rotted away ages ago, were tied to this world through an \u0027unnatural connection\u0027. If that connection was severed, then the undead would obviously die. \"...And that\u0027s why I\u0027ve been avoiding her all this time.\" \"Yeah, I get it.\" Lee Shin Woo was surprised when he obtained darkness magic, but he just accepted it and moved on. He had thought that the darkness element suited him, as he was an undead as well. However, when he thought he might be able to use light magic by using his staff in tandem with his darkness magic, he suddenly felt a fear that he\u0027d never experienced before. \u0027If the light magic were to destroy my very existence as an undead, then...\u0027 Although it was a body created by God, he was still an undead. It was entirely possible that he would either be weakened or he would be killed. Although he possessed Holy Resistance: MAX, he didn\u0027t yet know what the difference was between holy magic and light magic. In most novels, light magic and holy magic were usually similar, so he wondered if that would apply to this world as well. There was no way for him to be sure. \"So that\u0027s why you\u0027ve been postponing it for so long.\" \"...To be honest, I attempted it before the staff evolved, but at the time, the staff\u0027s output was too low, so I failed.\" The darkness element was clearly different from the other elements. When he\u0027d awakened the darkness element, it was definitely described as a \u0027great element\u0027. If that\u0027s the case, then the light element, which was its polar opposite, should be a \u0027great element\u0027 as well. The power of light was much too great for the staff at the time. However, once the staff had evolved into the Bone Winged Serpent, he came to the conclusion that it would be able to convert the darkness element as well. If that was true, then all that was left was Lee Shin Woo\u0027s decision. \"Even if it damages me, I want to see it with my very own eyes before someone else uses it against me.\" \"...Shin Woo, don\u0027t use that on me.\" \"Wow, how considerate of you... Anyway, let\u0027s go.\" Lee Shin Woo grabbed onto one of the Breath of the Lightning Gods, which floated in the air behind him as if protecting him, and converted it into a Bone Winged Serpent. And he carefully infused a small amount of darkness magic inside. [Activating the Serpent\u0027s Whirlwind.] The bone wings fluttered, and the infused power began swirling. The old staff would\u0027ve stopped and blown a fuse in the middle, but it didn\u0027t this time. Although it didn\u0027t amplify it by very much, the darkness magic was definitely being converted into light! \"Shin Woo... You\u0027re ok, right?\" \"...Yeah, for now.\" Lee Shin Woo carefully stretched out his hand and grabbed onto the light. But at that moment, it felt like a power he hadn\u0027t even been aware of began to well up within him. [Holy Resistance is reacting to the light magic. You have acquired Light Resistance: MAX. Magic has increased by 100.] \"...!?\" He\u0027d been so worried about the light element, yet it all got resolved so easily!? Moreover, he acquired Light Resistance: MAX, yet only gained 100 magic in return? What a low stat gain. Lee Shin Woo was filled with questions. The fact that he\u0027d acquired Light Resistance, even though he already possessed Holy Resistance meant that they were different, but Holy Resistance responding and creating Light Resistance also meant that they weren\u0027t completely different either! \"Shin Woo, are you really ok? Shin Woo?\" \"...I\u0027m a bit dizzy, but my body is ok. Ah, you take it too.\" \"H-Huh!? Hey, stop! Kyaa!\" Lee Shin Woo mercilessly thrust the light magic at Jin. Why, you ask? If Jin was exposed to light magic, he would also gain Light Resistance: MAX, as he also possessed Holy Resistance: MAX. And as expected, Jin acquired Light Resistance: MAX! However... \"I think I\u0027m going to level up!\" \"Right now?\" \"It\u0027s obvious something like this would happen. My magic suddenly went up by 100!\" And thus, Jin finally reached level 7. Lee Shin Woo continuously experimented with the light element while traveling towards his meeting spot with Retadane, but he didn\u0027t make any progress.
