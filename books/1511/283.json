It was just a joke, but if things go well, I think I can really get to level 9.\"\\n\\n \"...What do you have to do to get your stats to rise by the thousands?\"\\n\\n \"Who knows. It just comes naturally to me.\"\\n\\n Following the battle, Lee Shin Woo had returned to the Metal Army base. His loyal subordinate, Erem 290, presented the Sun Spear General\u0027s bone to him, and he then reexamined his stats.\\n\\n Compared to Seagald\u0027s bone, the Sun Spear General\u0027s wasn\u0027t anything special, but it leveled up his Water Resistance and Element (which he seldom used), causing his Magic to increase significantly once more. Even if it\u0027s rotten, it\u0027s still a herring. Or, even if he\u0027s just an extra, he\u0027s still one of the Four Heavenly Commanders.\\n\\n \"But Shin Woo, are you really ok with just absorbing other\u0027s bones all willy-nilly like that? That was a huge problem for you before.\"\\n\\n \"Mm, my shoulders hurt a little, but this much is fine. Honestly, it\u0027s just a scam. I can just fool the world into thinking that I\u0027m the legitimate owner of this karma.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s how it works...?\"\\n\\n Jin couldn\u0027t understand him and just tilted her head, but to Lee Shin Woo it was a simple matter. It was unclear how the world perceived a \u0027legitimate owner\u0027 of karma, so as long as Lee Shin Woo fooled the world into thinking he was that legitimate owner, everything would be fine.\\n\\n \"So I can just kill the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman.\"\\n\\n \"Is it really that simple!?\"\\n\\n \"His Dark Shadow lets him distort order.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. To put it bluntly, Lee Shin Woo was using Dark Shadow, which reversed cause-and-effect, to act like a gangster! If he\u0027d gained this power earlier, then he would\u0027ve acted like a swindler even earlier and plunged this world into chaos!\\n\\n \"How will you handle all that karma...?\"\\n\\n \"Think about it this way: Just put it back before you get caught!\"\\n\\n \"Stop. It sounds like you\u0027re a high school girl sneaking out of the house in her older sister\u0027s clothes!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo joked around with Jin and was greeted by Kratia. Once he was done giving her a progress report, Kratia immediately rushed outside and was mesmerized by the sunless underground night sky.\\n\\n There had always been a slight presence of light, even during nighttime. But now that the artificial sun was gone, it was completely dark. Now, morning would never come for the underground. Like it had been when the first residents of the Underground Empire had come.\\n\\n \"...The sun\u0027s gone. The yang energy has dwindled, but in exchange, the yin energy has gotten even stronger. ...It\u0027s great that I\u0027ve gotten stronger and all, but the Emperor and the Archmage probably got stronger too.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo knew he couldn\u0027t have allowed the sun to remain, especially because Seagald had fused with it. ...Despite that, he couldn\u0027t help but worry.\\n\\n He was worried about the powerful Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin (even so, Lee Shin Woo had destroyed his physical body twice), and was especially worried about the Emperor, who he assumed to be at least level 9!\\n\\n If those two\u0027s darkness was further strengthened, then could Kratia even do something against them? Unlike Prince, Kratia didn\u0027t want to be useless (as always, she was being really disrespectful towards Prince) and furrowed her brow in anguish.\\n\\n Her helping Lee Shin Woo study the Titan may have been good enough, but that wasn\u0027t enough for her. Now that it\u0027s come to this...\\n\\n \"I studied the Titan and gathered plenty of data. And because of you, Shin Woo, I\u0027ve gotten a grasp on innate elements. ...Maybe it\u0027s time for me to change too.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d prepared herself for this, but she hadn\u0027t taken the plunge. So, in a way, it may have been for the best. It was better for her to throw away her pride as a magician.\\n\\n While she was making a huge decision, she suddenly overheard someone speak.\\n\\n \"It truly is dark. It would usually brighten around now, like the surface. ...Though I haven\u0027t known about the surface\u0027s brightness for very long.\"\\n\\n \"Dana?\"\\n\\n It was Dana, once the princess of the Underground Empire, now an Immortal. She, who should\u0027ve been in the Spirits\u0027 Spring training with the spirits, had shown up in a one piece outfit and was heading towards her. In that short period of time, she had seemingly fully adjusted to her body, as she seemed much stronger than before.\\n\\n \"When did you get here?\"\\n\\n \"I came right over once I heard from the Hero. ...I believe the Hero was going to call me if the situation worsened.\"\\n\\n As Seira had pointed out, Lee Shin Woo had prepared several \u0027cards\u0027 for Seagald. One of those cards was the squad stationed in the Spirits\u0027 Spring.\\n\\n Because Lee Shin Woo had formed a contract with the Spirits\u0027 Spring, he could create a gate to the Spirits\u0027 Spring anytime, anywhere. Thus, he could call over more personnel (surpassing the gate\u0027s limitation) more quickly than usual.\\n\\n Dana had been prepared to jump into the fight against Seagald if necessary. But as you are well aware, Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t needed Seira, let alone Dana.\\n\\n \"It... truly is dark. I\u0027ve never seen such darkness, even when I was strapped to the Heaven Rending Cannon in Bayran. This is the first time I\u0027ve seen such a thing... ever since I was born.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s scary since it\u0027s so dark.\"\\n\\n \"Hoo, hoo. I\u0027m not scared at all. Since I now know that there\u0027s a true sun on the surface.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n Contrary to everything she\u0027d learned, the surface was very different from what she\u0027d expected, and she was deeply moved by what she\u0027d seen.\\n\\n The underground was changing so quickly due to the machinations of just one man. And regardless of how events progressed, the Underground Empire would soon meet its end.\\n\\n What would happen to her then? She thought about it and then smiled bitterly. She dare not think about it. After all, she hadn\u0027t expected that she\u0027d be sublimated into a greater existence, an Immortal.\\n\\n \u0027The Hero must have some sort of scenario mapped out already. Everything will go as he wishes, and I have no complaints there. On the contrary, seeing such exceptional ability from the man I love causes my heart to pound. ...But how much can I really do on his stage? Can I really help him?\u0027\\n\\n Coincidentally, she was thinking along the same lines as Kratia. Lee Shin Woo was so talented that they felt stupid for pledging their aid.\\n\\n Kratia, who had no idea what she was thinking, tilted her head at Dana, who was vacantly gazing at the sky and asked.\\n\\n \"Are you sad now that your fiance\u0027s dead? ...Or did you want to be there when it happened?\"\\n\\n \"...Pardon? Fiance? Ah, you\u0027re talking about Seagald. I\u0027m not sure. I regret not being able to sock him in the face, but we weren\u0027t close enough for me to feel sad over his passing. He was my fiance in name only... And I also have someone I love.\"\\n\\n \"You sound like the main character of a romance novel.\"\\n\\n Kratia said, dumbfounded, and Dana looked askance at her and repeated.\\n\\n \"You seem to not have any dreams; it must be because you\u0027re a magician. Most Elementalists are pure and have a wild imagination. Everyone carries a story within their hearts. It\u0027s just that my story is a romance.\"\\n\\n \"Then what about Shin Woo? Shin Woo\u0027s an Elementalist too.\"\\n\\n \"Mm... I heard there was a darkness magic book on the surface made of human skin.\"\\n\\n It sounded more like a book a demon would carry around, rather than an Elementalist, but Kratia could understand completely.\\n\\n \"You can appraise someone so calmly, yet still like them, huh...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s extremely cruel and not considerate of others, but he also cares for us immensely. I like him. But sometimes, I think he spoils us too much.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really get it. His Heaven Defying General persona\u0027s really cool, but... I think I\u0027ll need to study love a bit more.\"\\n\\n Kratia always thought he\u0027d been the prime candidate to practice on. If he, a mere skeleton, was able to draw the affection of so many women and form such complicated relationships with them, then he would be really helpful in her understanding of love and human feelings. If Lee Shin Woo had heard her, he\u0027d probably be really mad.\\n\\n \"Persona...?\"\\n\\n \"You were both out here?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s you, Seira.\"\\n\\n Dana was somewhat perplexed at Kratia\u0027s speech, as she spoke as though she wasn\u0027t human. But then, Seira appeared at such perfect timing. She floated over to them and then looked at the night sky, which had once occupied the two\u0027s attention.\\n\\n \"The Empire will soon disappear without a trace. You know that, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, somewhat. Were you perhaps thinking about what your role was in all this, Seira?\"\\n\\n \"No. As long as the Empire perishes, I\u0027m happy. Since it\u0027s no time to be worrying about our methods. I don\u0027t care if Lee Shin Woo uses me as a chess piece or puts me on his stage, so long as he destroys the Empire. ...You were thinking quite lavishly, it seems, Dana.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n Seira wasn\u0027t concerned with Dana\u0027s petulance or her puffed up cheeks and just said what she wanted to say. Her attitude had changed so dramatically that it was hard to believe that just a short while ago she was praying for the dead.\\n\\n \"If you have any unfinished business on this curse-ridden world, then you should deal with it before everything ends. ...Oh my, I should get going.\"\\n\\n \"What about the Hero? It\u0027s just you, Seira?\"\\n\\n Dana\u0027s cheeks puffed up even more. Seira, feeling her gaze, smiled as if entertained, and turned around. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo entered the chatting channel and was met with...\\n\\n [Lloyd H.K.: S-Silene is... Shin Woo, Silene\u0027s been captured! We have to go and save him!]\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo: Oh, no. What sad and surprising news...]\\n\\n What an obvious trap! Moreover, there was an idiot right here who wanted to go head long into that trap!\\n\\n A signal for battle had been lit in such an unexpected locale.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-283","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
