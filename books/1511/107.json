Hansen Von Dorthe - 1\u003e Once Lee Shin Woo had seen Nellopa\u0027s movements, he was able to understand the magic pattern immediately. He formed the connection extremely quickly and naturally. The communication line didn\u0027t show faces and only transmitted one\u0027s voice, so it was quite simple. [Mm... Is that you, Nellopa?] \"Yes, General.\" He was communicating with one of the 12 generals, the Lightning General. He realized that the communication line would enable him to communicate with only the Lightning General after going through Count Nellopa\u0027s memories. But that was actually quite fortunate. Count Nellopa knew quite a bit about the Lightning General, as he worked under him, and that was the primary reason Lee Shin Woo took the risk of summoning one of the 12 generals. [You already gave me your regular report. An invader? So the golems finally... did they show up?] The Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, replied, and Lee Shin Woo spoke in an urgent tone. He wasn\u0027t lying; the situation was quite urgent. Since the Treasure Eater was running wild, in an attempt to swallow him whole! \"It\u0027s not the golems. But a considerably powerful monster appeared...!\" [The Emperor\u0027s order was clear: execute the golems, who are rebelling against the Empire.] \"But the city will fall! If that happens, we won\u0027t be able to uphold the imperial command, General!‚Äù [...] If the city responsible for protecting the Sanctuary fell, then they would obviously be leaving the Sanctuary unattended. It was such obvious reasoning, so why did he have to think it over so seriously? Lee Shin Woo wondered whether all the 12 generals were idiots. [Hoo... Fools. To think you\u0027d be put into this kind of situation from a mere monster... It can\u0027t be helped. I\u0027ll go myself.] \"It\u0027s an honor, General!\" [Keep as many soldiers alive as possible. If you\u0027re right, then me going is pointless if all your forces, which are meant to protect the Sanctuary, are destroyed.] \"Indeed!\" He\u0027d planned on sacrificing his troops to ensure his safety, but Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t tell him that and cut the line. He hadn\u0027t given the general any particular information on the monster, but it seemed like the general didn\u0027t care. Well, he was one of the 12 generals. The 12 generals had nothing to fear in the Empire, aside from the Emperor! \u0027Good. A resounding success.\u0027 However, if the general had been told, he wouldn\u0027t have been able respond as calmly as he did. That his opponent, the Treasure Eater, was a high rank level 7 elite, capable of unleashing powerful lightning, as well as possessing Lightning Resistance! \u0027The Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, is level 7 and is one of the weaker generals. But because he\u0027s a swordsman who wields a powerful and quick blade clad in lightning, as well as utilizing a powerful element, he\u0027s about as powerful as a level 8 in a one on one fight. Thus, the Emperor uses him as an hitman (a contracted killer). Plus, he\u0027s one of the generals who\u0027s independent and works alone without commanding troops.\u0027 Even Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t be privy to this detailed information had his Bone Reinforcement been a lower level, or had he not gained two bones from Nellopa rather than one, or if Nellopa wasn\u0027t someone connected with the Lightning General. However, all the conditions had been met, so he\u0027d acquired plenty of information on Hansen Von Dorthe, and had succeeded in calling him over. He wouldn\u0027t come over with bothersome high rank undead, and his match up against the Treasure Eater was the worst; the Lightning General won\u0027t be able to win easily. If Lee Shin Woo succeeded in pitting them against each other... he would be able to take down both the Treasure Eater, and one of the 12 generals. No. He put all this effort into calling him; he had to take him down. \u0027I\u0027m confident I took the best course of action, but... I may die a few times.\u0027 To think he actually managed to call one of the 12 generals over here. He thought about how shocked Jin would be if he heard about this, and chuckled. With that in mind, the Treasure Eater shot out lightning once more. [Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!] \"Yeah, yeah. I heard you. Jin, get over here quick! I\u0027m dying over here!\" \"I\u0027m on my way!\" Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s agility wasn\u0027t high enough for him to dodge when fighting against a level 7 monster using its full strength. He attempted to stifle its approach by either using Bone Fortress\u0027s, or spewing Acid Poison, but if he made even one mistake in this intense battle, he\u0027d lose his head! \"Heup!\" Then, the Treasure Eater struck the floor with its giant tail, shooting lightning spears; at that moment, Lee Shin Woo knew that he couldn\u0027t block the attack. He leapt into the air while the lightning spears struck his body. The Treasure Eater began shooting him with large-scale attacks and its body temporarily stiffened. The fact that only its rotten eyeballs were moving and tracking his movements was truly goosebump inducing. \"Get on!\" \"Ok!\" \"Gyaaaaaaaaahk!\" Right when the Treasure Eater could move again, Jin skillfully jumped, approached Lee Shin Woo, and called for him. Lee Shin Woo grabbed onto Jin\u0027s back and did a half-turn, safely landing on Jin\u0027s back! Immediately after, the three landed at a location quite far from Treasure Eater. [You have joined up with your partner. Rebellion\u0027s effect are fully shared with your partner!] \"Nice. This is perfect.\" \"That was really close, you know!?\" \"Ueehk...\" Jin had easily avoided the Treasure Eater\u0027s impressive lightning attack while advancing forward; he then jumped, catching Lee Shin Woo in the air and even landed perfectly... Kratia was reminded once more that Jin wasn\u0027t normal. Her motion sickness was the price she had to pay for underestimating him. \"Run slowly... Ugh.\" \"Just let it out while we\u0027re running. You\u0027ll feel a bit better that way.\" \"If you vomit on my back, then I\u0027m dropping both of you!\" Jin yelled in astonishment as Lee Shin Woo patted Kratia\u0027s back. Jin decided to ask about their current predicament. \"How long do you think we can keep avoiding it for without fighting it directly?\" \"Rebellion increased your stats, so... probably as long as we want?\" \"You... you\u0027re a good guy.\" Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at Jin\u0027s refreshing reply. It still didn\u0027t change the fact that Jin was level 5, no matter how close he was to level 6, while their opponent was an elite level 7 monster; to think he\u0027d still be able to say something so confidently. No matter how high Jin\u0027s agility was, or how much his stats were increased through the Rebellion skill, the effectiveness of their stats shouldn\u0027t be able to match a level 7\u0027s! \u0027Now that I think about it, there\u0027s more to Jin than just his agility.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo suddenly realized. There was more to Jin than just his high agility. Jin possessed several skills that allowed him to use that agility to its very limits, or even beyond its limits. According to him, each of Jin\u0027s reflex related skills immediately increased his speed. Moreover, Steel Heart further increased his mobility, so it made sense that he was still confident. \"So why did you tell the undead to back off, Shin Woo? You could\u0027ve sacrificed them to weaken it a bit.\" \"I sent them back to the city. Since it\u0027d be better to fight within the city if we want to take advantage of our numbers.\" And in the process, he stayed behind to keep the Treasure Eater busy, further cementing their loyalty to him. If the undead could still shed tears, then his troops would\u0027ve been sobbing during their retreat. \"And I\u0027m going to group up with them soon.\" \"So what about those guys? You should be able to control them, right?\" Originally, the Golem Chimeras had been their objective, but now, no one cared about the thousands of Golem Chimeras. Kratia didn\u0027t doubt that Lee Shin Woo would be able to control them and use them to inflict damage upon the Treasure Eater. And if that happened...! \"If I can consolidate all our forces into one single force, we may be able to take down a level 7 elite. Since I\u0027m level 7 now too!\" \"You really are level 7, huh?\" Lee Shin Woo thought there might be some truth to Lloyd\u0027s statement regarding Kratia in the chatting channel, but he hadn\u0027t expected her to actually have reached level 7! That meant that she was at the level of a high rank level 6 when they first met. However... he was surprised and knew that she was talented, but it wasn\u0027t something that would change their situation very much. \"Mm... It\u0027s not like your plan would\u0027ve changed if you knew that I was level 7 beforehand.\" \"Plan? What plan? Isn\u0027t your plan over with now?\" Jin, who had been busy concentrating on evading the Treasure Eater, stuck his nose into their conversation. Lee Shin Woo genuinely laughed and replied. \"You probably wouldn\u0027t know, but there\u0027s one part left of Operation - Bro, why are you there?. I prepared something in case an unexpected, powerful enemy appeared: Plan D...!\" \"Plan D...!?\" Of course, he was lying his ass off, but Jin was completely fooled and replied in astonishment. Before he explained Plan D, he asked Kratia. \"Kratia, something unexpected happened. You could get hurt, so you can leave if you want; I don\u0027t mind. You helped us attack the testing facility, so I can reward you too.\" \"Hmm...? I told you, I\u0027m level 7. Didn\u0027t you hear me?\" Was he intending on taking her, a level 7, out of his plan!? Her expression was no longer of disappointment; instead, she poked Lee Shin Woo\u0027s back with a face marred with confusion. But because his back was entirely composed of bone, her finger just ended up hurting. \"I heard you.\" \"What kind of plan takes out a level 7? There\u0027s no way I\u0027d run away unless one of the 12 generals was...\" As expected, she realized midway what his plan was with her impressive intellect. \"You\u0027re going to bring one of the 12 generals into this!?\" \"One of the 12 generals!? Why would a general come here!?\" Jin, who had been listening, was startled and yelled! However, Lee Shin Woo smirked and nodded his head. \"Yep. I called a general. I know about him through Nellopa.\" \"Are you insane!?\" \"What are you going to do!?\" Kratia and Jin were shocked and demanded a clear answer out of Lee Shin Woo, who treated this like he were inviting a close friend over. Jin especially, as he pledged that they would live or die together. However, Lee Shin Woo remained calm as ever. He was actually really nervous, but he was well aware that if he showed his unease, he would just further exasperate his teammates\u0027 own anxiousness. \"Listen carefully. The Lightning General, Hansen Von Dorthe, is coming, and he\u0027s one of the generals who works alone.\" \"Ah, I heard that there were generals that acted independently, but he\u0027s still a general! He\u0027s on another level, even to another level 7!\" To become level 7, one needed to attain 6,400 total stats, and Kratia had barely made it past that to become a level 7 magician. However, that didn\u0027t mean that every level 7 was the same! Those who\u0027d reached 6,400 stats were level 7, but one needed 12,800 stats to reach level 8; and those who were really close to that threshold... like those with 12,799 stats, were still considered level 7. A general would be closer to level 8 than 7! \"Seriously, just listen. He specializes in one on one fights, so the Emperor uses him as his personal hitman. And he\u0027s best at using lightning.\" \"Lightning...?\" His explanation caused Kratia to furrow her brow. For a while now she\u0027d been vacantly thinking \u0027a level 7 elite really is different from the norm\u0027 after seeing the level 7 Treasure Eater continuously discharge lightning. \"Then, you\u0027re going to make it fight against the general and then...?\" \"Even a general shouldn\u0027t be able to take it down so easily when it has such a powerful lightning resistance. Of course, it\u0027ll be tough for the Treasure Eater to take the general down too, but if it gets into a melee fight, then the Lightning General loses his advantage.\" \"Well, that\u0027s true, but...\" Lee Shin Woo was conjuring up some plans that would depend on the situation in case the general was much stronger than he expected. Since he held all the cards. \"So what are you going to do, Kratia? You want in or not?\" His final card was Invisible Heart. Even if he did his best and prepared a myriad of strategies, he wasn\u0027t confident that he could take down a big shot like a general without dying in the process. But if Kratia nodded her head... he could replace Invisible Heart with Kratia. With her, it would be a perfect hand: a royal straight flush. He was sure of that. \"I\u0027m...\" The great level 7 magician anguished over his offer. Ultimately, she made up her mind.
