You don\u0027t think you can absorb all of the undead curse within the cannon, do you?\" \"Nope. If it were just her, then I might be able to do something about it, but the curse will flow into her from the cannon anyway, so there\u0027s no point. I\u0027m trying my best here, but it\u0027s too much...\" \"Jin, it\u0027s dangerous to absorb it so recklessly. My Stasis Magic will wear off.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s right. Kratia, good job.\" \"Of course.\" Her application of \u0027first aid\u0027 was top-notch. She didn\u0027t simply freeze her target; she had completely halted the Spirit General from using any of her \u0027power\u0027, which included both her magic and her physical strength. It felt like she\u0027d used the time element as well. Perhaps Lee Shin Woo had been looking down on the ice element thus far. He could wield the Lv1 High Rank Ice element, but that wasn\u0027t something he could boast about in front of Kratia. [Guu...Guaaaaah...] \"Ah, this woman\u0027s lost it too. Where should I even start...\" Her ominous, yet beautiful black hair was disheveled, and her widened, golden eyes evoked a creepy feeling; and the princess continued to cry out. Lee Shin Woo had, from the very beginning, assumed that she wouldn\u0027t be \u0027ok\u0027, but her condition was a lot worse than he\u0027d expected. After all, she had been used as a \u0027battery\u0027 and an \u0027energy cable\u0027 for the cannon for dozens of years, which had worn away at both her body and her mind... In other words, the contract had been in place before the fall of the Empire. That\u0027s what had caused her to be in such a sorry state. \u0027So he\u0027s willing to use his daughter or anything at his disposal to go to the surface, huh...\u0027 He recalled what Seira had said before. That Seagald was willing to use his fiance for his goals... If his goal involved using the cannon, then she was right. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and placed his hand on the cannon. As expected, he didn\u0027t \u0027own\u0027 the cannon, so he couldn\u0027t change it into bone. Honestly, he\u0027d already tried it before fighting Seagald. It was because he knew that he couldn\u0027t change it into bone that he had been so anxious during his fight. Ah, he was getting pissed again! \"Seagald, I\u0027ll kill you no matter what...\" \"Shin Woo, you talking like that makes you sound more like an undead.\" \"He\u0027s never lost his prey before, but he lost two of them at once, so that\u0027s probably why he\u0027s like that.\" \"You were able to drive them away without losing the cannon pretty much unscathed. I feel like that\u0027s a decisive victory in your favor, Shin Woo...\" Whereas, Kratia and Jin, who couldn\u0027t do anything more, just calmly conversed and watched on. The golems were standing behind them in order to protect the Metal God General. Kratia glanced at them and then asked Jin. \"How did you talk them into this? They\u0027re completely subservient to Shin Woo.\" \"He took advantage of their weakness; they\u0027re just helping us out temporarily.\" \"...Sounds like something a villain would do.\" Kratia had no idea how Lee Shin Woo had grasped one of the Four Heavenly Commander\u0027s weaknesses and forced him to do his bidding, but because Jin looked clueless as well, she didn\u0027t ask her anything else. It really didn\u0027t matter, so long as they didn\u0027t come attacking them. \"So Shin Woo... do you think it\u0027s impossible?\" \"Mm, I have to take care of this woman first. Then I can move on to the next step.\" \"...Are you going to brainwash her too?\" \"Hey, don\u0027t put it that way. It makes me sound like a weirdo.\" All he was doing was changing her mind a little bit and turning her into a completely different person than before! Lee Shin Woo ignored Kratia\u0027s rude remark and focused on the princess once more. Fortunately, it was much easier to deal with her than Seira. \u0027Her contract was forced onto her through the darkness element, so I can easily deal with it. It\u0027s a relief it\u0027s not complicated.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo stretched his hand and placed it upon the princess\u0027s forehead. Darkness covered her, an amount similar to when he\u0027d transformed Seira into a banshee, and he immediately erased the contract that bound her. [You don\u0027t need to be tied to the cannon any longer.] [You don\u0027t need to listen to the Emperor\u0027s or the Archmage\u0027s orders any longer.] [I\u0027m erasing all illegitimate contracts.] The deep-seated curse, which had bound her mind and body for dozens of years, was erased by a deeper darkness. [A-Ah...?] At that moment, her wide-open golden eyes returned to normal. Her eyes gleamed with a faint intellect, and widened even further when she looked into Lee Shin woo\u0027s goblin fire. Terror and hatred. Anger and fear... Her eyes reflected the amalgamation of all these emotions. If he knew she\u0027d have responded like this, then he\u0027d have turned back into a human. Lee Shin Woo slightly regretted his lack of foresight and quickly said. \"The mana inside of this damn cannon\u0027s going to explode, so don\u0027t say anything and follow my instructions. You don\u0027t want to die when you\u0027ve just gotten your sanity back, right?\" [Uuaah...] Was it because she hadn\u0027t been able to speak for dozens of years? Fortunately, she was able to understand Lee Shin Woo because of the link between them and nodded her head. She then began to control her mana. Even if it\u0027s rotten, it\u0027s still a herring. She was able to return her mana to normal and circulate it throughout her body. Once she began to properly circulate the mana throughout her body, her ruined body regained a bit of its strength back. As expected, the effects of mana were truly amazing. [Ugh. Keuk... Kuheuk...!] But there was a problem. The amount of mana she could control was far less than the cannon\u0027s capacity. No matter what she did, the cannon\u0027s mana wouldn\u0027t obey her commands. It made sense; she was only the trigger. It didn\u0027t matter when they pulled the trigger; what mattered was that they had already pulled the trigger, activating the cannon. Lee Shin Woo realized that after coming into contact with her. Now he had no choice but to do something about the cannon himself! \"Hey, do you have a good way of dealing with this?\" [Uuuah.] She was made aware of the situation by Lee Shin Woo but shook her head as tears streamed down her face. Because she had just realized what she\u0027d done for dozens of years, she wasn\u0027t in the right state of mind. She, who had possessed the title of Spirit Princess, had sucked away the spirits\u0027 life force and turned it into destructive power! She couldn\u0027t show her face to the spirits, who had once been her friends. She was in no condition to be stopping the cannon! [Ugh. The... spirits...!] Of course, her friends had mostly been killed by Lee Shin Woo and company, allowing them to be at peace, but it probably wouldn\u0027t be a good idea to tell her that right now. Lee Shin Woo grabbed onto the Evil Eye chain that connected her and the cannon and said. \"You can mourn them later. But if you die here, then you won\u0027t be able to do anything. And you can\u0027t take your revenge on the ones who did this to you either. If you want to take revenge on the ones who did this to the underground spirits, then you have to survive.\" [Re...venge...?] \"That\u0027s right.\" Kratia and Jin, who were watching from behind, said \u0027it\u0027s finally started\u0027 and chattered on, but Lee Shin Woo just ignored them and continued. \"The people who forced you underground. And the people who led the Empire to its ruin. The ones who forced you to sacrifice your friends. All the people who used you. They\u0027re still living and breathing, so are you just going to wallow away in self pity and die?\" [Ah, but... I\u0027m...] \"And there are still some spirits that are alive here.\" [Aaaah...!] Mm. Going at it this way got a better reaction out of her. Lee Shin Woo took this opportunity and pushed forward. \"You have to stop this if you want to save them. It\u0027s not just the underground. The spirits on the surface are waiting for you to rescue them.\" \"Living spirits... Aah.\" Her voice was becoming firmer and her eyes were becoming clearer. Dana Von Etliber was the Empire\u0027s greatest Elementalist. She could tell that Lee Shin Woo not only wielded several elements but was also connected with several spirits as well. For some reason, that fact reinvigorated her. \"How can an undead contract... No, I shouldn\u0027t be talking about other people when I\u0027m in this state.\" \"Oh. Your echo\u0027s gone now... It seems like you\u0027re back.\" Although her complexion was still ghastly and she hadn\u0027t been released of her \u0027delayed undead transformation\u0027 state, she had regained her mind completely. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and she said the words he had been waiting for. \"I want to live...! Please help me!\" \"I was waiting for you to say that. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re a lot easier to deal with than that old bag. Alright. Then, let\u0027s save you first. Kratia, I\u0027m going to pull this woman out, so use your Stasis Magic on the cannon one more time!\" \"Easy for you to say!\" \"?\" First, Lee Shin Woo pulled off the Evil Eye chains that bound her to the cannon. If she couldn\u0027t control the cannon, then he was better off just releasing her from it! The chains had originally been tied with a complicated spell, but due to his control over darkness he was able to pull them out with ease. Then, he superimposed his previous fragment of Evil Eye with this one, creating a single grain. \"Next up.\" \"H-How did you...!?\" Dana Von Etliber couldn\u0027t believe her sudden freedom and looked dumbfounded. But that wasn\u0027t the end. Now that her link with the cannon was broken, the undead curse was quickly descending upon her in order to transform her into an undead! She, who hadn\u0027t been picked by God, would turn into an undead if he didn\u0027t do anything. If her condition was even a little bit better, then he and Jin could\u0027ve continuously sucked the curse out of her and prolonged her life, but she was in terrible shape, so a makeshift method wouldn\u0027t work. \u0027So... I have no choice but to try an experimental method!\u0027 Lee Shin Woo immediately extended his hand towards her and used his \u0027Dark Shadow\u0027. If he were to simultaneously eliminate as much of the curse as possible while also giving her an ability to repel the curse, then she could live! He\u0027d failed with Seira, but he couldn\u0027t afford to fail a second time! \"You can\u0027t reject this power. It\u0027ll nullify the mana that\u0027s attempting to turn you into an undead.\" \"I understand... But is that really possible?\" \"A deeper darkness consumes the weaker one.\" Eventually, Dark Shadow covered the princess\u0027s body and imbued it with darkness. The princess didn\u0027t resist the energy; in fact, she used her own mana to supplement it. Befitting an Elementalist who had controlled countless spirits, she seemed confident in harmonizing her own mana with another person\u0027s. It was quite relieving for Lee Shin Woo. \u0027A body which can\u0027t be infiltrated by the curse.\u0027 He hadn\u0027t understood this before, but now that he understood it, the idea behind it was quite simple. Couldn\u0027t he just copy the blessing God had given him? Dark Shadow, which possessed the power to reverse all cause-and-effect, had the ability to do so. Dana\u0027s case was different from Seira\u0027s; Seira\u0027s body had been all but dead, and her mana and physical body had sustained critical damage. She had been putting off her death. However, Dana\u0027s body, which had been in contact with the undead curse for dozens of years, was, at this point, neither dead nor alive. Her body was extremely vulnerable to the undead curse but was also the optimal container for an ability that repelled it. Of course, it should be impossible to bestow this karma upon someone without being God herself, but Lee Shin Woo was able to do it! \u0027Wild Card...!\u0027 This was the third change, following Jin and Seira. Whenever he used it, he felt himself becoming more familiar with it. He could do this regularly now. But there was one issue here: that this was a contract created through the darkness element. [Is it really ok?] [To be frank... I\u0027d like to hear more before I make a decision. But if I don\u0027t do as you say, then I\u0027ll become an undead just like Seagald, Feotane, or my father. If that\u0027s the case, then I have to live first, no matter what happens in the future. You told Seira before that she had to live first too.] [Ah, you were listening?] [Moreover, I feel like I\u0027m fated to be with you. You\u0027re the last remaining Elementalist in this dead world. I can feel how happy the spirits are through their memories. I\u0027d like to believe in that. And please introduce those girls to me later.] As expected, he should\u0027ve just said he was an Elementalist like her; that was all it took to convince her. It had gone so much more smoothly than his time with Seira that it moved him to tears. And then, Lee Shin Woo began her transformation in earnest. Of course, the change was a lot smaller than with Seira. Because she wasn\u0027t a hero, she hadn\u0027t accumulated much karma. Plus, he had managed to steal a large quantity of mana from the cannon; with the addition of his Dark Shadow, her body and mind were given a small \u0027advantage\u0027, that\u0027s all. \u0027...Reject death. Survive.\u0027 The combination of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s authority, which distorted reality, Dana Von Etliber\u0027s miraculous body, which bordered between life and death, and her incredible mana ability... All of those factors mixed together and created a miracle. Something that hadn\u0027t existed in the world was born once more. \"Aaaaaah!\" A blinding light burst forth. Immediately after, her body was covered in darkness. There was pretty much no change to her outward appearance, but Lee Shin Woo knew that she was a completely different existence than before. [You have created the Lv8 Immortal Princess Dana, and have formed a subordinate contract with her.] [While this was only possible because the target aided you with her own will and ability, you have succeeded in creating a never before seen species! The Immortal, a high rank species that lives between the border of life and death, and is closer to death than any other, yet has avoided death and lives. This embodies the way you yourself live. As their creator, they will give you unlimited love and esteem.] [You have acquired the title, \u0027Species Creator\u0027 and all stats have increased by 100! You have fulfilled a portion of the requirements in achieving the fusion element between light and darkness! The Rebellion skill has become Lv8 and all stats have increased by 30. When you meet the conditions of the Rebellion skill, all stats increase by 24%.] With his Rebellion skill going up by 2 levels in one go, overall... It felt like God would scold him for this, but like always, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t let it bother him and just decided to move on!
