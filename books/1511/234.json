Return - 4\u003e\\n\\n The first thing they did after leaving the secret shop was inspecting the wine factory\u0027s facilities. After that, they told the Dryads where their princess was, and what she was doing.\\n\\n After he\u0027d calmed down the spirits that latched onto him, he collected the wine barrels and supplied new oak barrels. And only then could he sigh.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve finally come to a safe place... so shall we start?\"\\n\\n \"...Start what?\"\\n\\n Jin replied, and gulped down spit he didn\u0027t even have. He tried to feign ignorance, but he already knew what Lee Shin Woo was planning. He could tell just looking at Lee Shin Woo taking out and sorting the 10,000 or so bones he\u0027d collected from the level 8 dungeon!\\n\\n \"What do you mean? Before we go, we\u0027re going to level you up.\"\\n\\n \"I still need 2,500 stats to level up. Do you really think it\u0027ll be that easy?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. So long as I have this, the Garuda\u0027s Wing Bone!\"\\n\\n \"I think so too...\"\\n\\n Jin saw Lee Shin Woo\u0027s unnecessarily brisk smile (whenever Lee Shin Woo smiled like this, it usually meant that something assuredly not fun was going to happen), and realized that he had no way to escape. Since meeting with Lee Shin Woo this time, Jin\u0027s best friend \u0027resignation\u0027 had been patting him on the shoulder.\\n\\n \"You could say that your level up is the fruit of your time on the surface. I\u0027m sure of it this time. If you absorb the Garuda\u0027s Wing Bone, then... When you level up, you\u0027ll gain real wings!\"\\n\\n \"You could make me wings. Can you not make me into a human!?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, about that. I hadn\u0027t really explained that part thoroughly enough to you.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo suddenly sobered up. Jin, who had been pushing him, felt tense. Jin thought that maybe Lee Shin Woo could already transform into a complete human.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t get this from Lee Shin Woo\u0027s reaction but from Ye Jin Jin and Sinea\u0027s reactions. ...All the more reason he didn\u0027t want to hear it from him. He was scared of getting a definite answer.\\n\\n \"You must have some idea by now, but just a little while ago, I became able to disguise myself completely as a human. No, to be more specific, calling it a disguise at this point doesn\u0027t really fit. It\u0027d be more accurate to say that I can \u0027define\u0027 myself. It\u0027s because I have this ability that I was able to use the Wild Card or Dark Shadow skills.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh...\"\\n\\n \"However, that ability\u0027s focused on me. Which means I can\u0027t yet use it to fundamentally change others. Several of my abilities grew as I leveled up, so... I could probably change your outside appearance to that of a human\u0027s, but it\u0027s ultimately limited to just the outside. ...I thought that might hurt you even more, so I didn\u0027t say anything. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh... Uaaaaah.\"\\n\\n \"Jin!?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had made up his mind and spoken, but Jin reacted in a completely unexpected way. He expected him to kick with his hind legs or use his Magic Breath, but Jin just rolled onto the ground while screaming.\\n\\n \"Eugeuuu! Uaaaaah!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was truly taken aback at the sight of Jin rolling on the floor, his four legs writhing. Because Jin\u0027s agility was so high, his feet left afterimages, but laughing would be the worst possible decision here, so he suppressed the feeling.\\n\\n \"Heueu. Hoooo...\"\\n\\n \"Jin, have you calmed down?\"\\n\\n \"Grr.\"\\n\\n A few minutes later, Jin stopped writhing around. But when he asked a question, Jin grit his teeth. Seeing that, he realized that Jin hadn\u0027t calmed down yet, so he decided to wait patiently for a few more minutes. Jin skillfully stood up by himself and stepped onto the ground with his four legs.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good.\"\\n\\n \"A-Alright.\"\\n\\n \"Just wanted to get this out there. You didn\u0027t do anything wrong. I just wanted to vent. Moreover, I know that you\u0027re trying to figure out how to turn me back into a human.\"\\n\\n \"Mm...\"\\n\\n If he were to say \u0027You knew about that already?\u0027, then their partnership might break. Lee Shin Woo looked into his eyes and Jin sighed. Then, Jin spoke much softer than before.\\n\\n \"You said you could change my outer appearance, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. To whatever appearance you recognize.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. Then could you turn me back, before I level up, just once? I want to show you what I looked like when I was still human.\"\\n\\n ...It was a long time coming. At least, that\u0027s what Lee Shin Woo thought. When Jin said that, the hanging tension between them had already implied the coming results.\\n\\n Even so, he couldn\u0027t not do it. This was an event of sorts. An event that had to occur if Lee Shin Woo and Jin wanted to continue to be partners from now on. In the end, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head.\\n\\n \"...Alright.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all set.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo slowly extended his hand towards Jin and used his Disguise skill. The change was immediate. The horse shape turned into a human\u0027s build, and in the middle of it, skin began to cover Jin\u0027s body.\\n\\n If Lee Shin Woo were disguising himself, it wouldn\u0027t take this long. But because he was using it on someone else, so dramatically at that, the process was a bit horrifying. The basic modeling was finished, which set the groundwork for adjusting the fine lines of the human body; it was starting to look like a human now.\\n\\n \"...Hoo.\"\\n\\n Jin\u0027s image was indispensable, as he was transforming from a skeleton horse to a human. Not a weak image, like something he\u0027d seen just once or twice, but his own image, the image of himself all his life.\\n\\n Therefore, there could be only one viable result: Jin Taylor\u0027s human appearance on Earth.\\n\\n \"It really is my body.\"\\n\\n She was finished disguising. Jin\u0027s voice was always quite beautiful, but it had become even more so when she\u0027d transformed into a human. It was the type of voice that made someone feel better just by listening to it.\\n\\n \"...That so?\"\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n Jin\u0027s legs were slender as if it was evidence that she was a sprinter, and the beauty of her leg lines, which started at her muscled thighs, was truly striking. The hot pants really fit her.\\n\\n Her upper body was thin as well. Jin\u0027s loose-fitting T-shirt didn\u0027t fully cover her slender waist. It was the same for her slender stomach. But her chest was so voluptuous that he wondered whether she could really run with it. Jin saw where he was looking and smiled as if she found it funny. Then, she explained.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, you shouldn\u0027t underestimate the recent sports bras.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s worse, it even disguised what you\u0027re wearing as well... Never mind.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d only transformed her outer appearance, but he\u0027d almost responded unnecessarily. It was definitely because he was agitated. Lee Shin Woo then asked her.\\n\\n \"So how do you feel?\"\\n\\n \"Mm.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo looked into her eyes (as she was laughing) and smiled bitterly. Her blond ponytailed hair was quite striking, but her endlessly blue eyes and her facial features were so beautiful that he felt like it was a bit of a waste that she was an athlete.\\n\\n \u0027When she was still an athlete, she must\u0027ve had a ton of fans\u0027, he thought calmly... and then he bowed his head and apologized to her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry for everything till now. I\u0027m a real bastard.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. He\u0027d desperately ignored it until now, but he\u0027d already known for a while.\\n\\n That Jin was a girl.\\n\\n There was no way he couldn\u0027t know.\\n\\n \u0027Our countries were different, the way we lived were different... We had too many different fundamental values that couldn\u0027t be attributed to just those two factors.\u0027\\n\\n No, that was just an excuse. He\u0027d known from the beginning. He was suspicious when he\u0027d first heard Jin\u0027s voice, and he was sure of it when he saw how well she got along with Ye Jin Jin.\\n\\n He had been a company employee in South Korea. There was no way that Lee Shin Woo, who\u0027d met so many people during his time as a company employee, wouldn\u0027t recognize his partner\u0027s gender, who he spent 24 hours a day with. But the reason he\u0027d regarded Jin as a man was because \u0027it was more comfortable for him that way\u0027.\\n\\n Jin knew that, and he trusted that Jin understood.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need to apologize. At first, I thought it\u0027d be better if I kept it ambiguous. Even if I\u0027m a skeleton horse, it\u0027d be tough to ride on top a girl\u0027s back, right?\"\\n\\n \"No... I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Moreover, look. We\u0027re a skeleton and skeleton horse. Who cares about gender? What was the point in even distinguishing my gender?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had thought that way, so he\u0027d left it alone, but you never know how someone might react. They really should\u0027ve tackled this issue from the beginning. That\u0027s why Lee Shin Woo was apologizing.\\n\\n \"The more you apologize, the more miserable I feel... Haha.\"\\n\\n The reason why trivial issues like this had become such a big deal, despite them being a skeleton and a skeleton horse was because... well, it was kind of obvious. Could he really write it off by saying that their timing was off or their mental attitude wasn\u0027t good?\\n\\n It was fine when Jin was still a skeleton horse since her feelings wouldn\u0027t show on her face, but now, he could see her bitter expression on her face. So no matter how shameless Lee Shin Woo was, he felt like something was stabbing him in the heart.\\n\\n \"I guess there\u0027s some hope for me yet if you\u0027re feeling so apologetic. Though it\u0027s kind of laughable for me, a skeleton horse, to be saying stuff like this.\"\\n\\n \"I should be able to turn you back into a human soon.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. I trust you. When the time comes, we can start there. ...We\u0027ll be able to start from there, right?\"\\n\\n Jin\u0027s specialty was acting weak and unconfident, despite her exceptional abilities. Even after she assumed her beautiful human form, she remained the same, so he smiled automatically. She was well aware that her outer appearance was just a secondary factor to their relationship.\\n\\n \"Yeah, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. I trust you, so I\u0027ll go back to being a horse. I\u0027ll level up as fast as I can.\"\\n\\n \"Ok.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo used all the elite level 8 bones, as well as the Garuda\u0027s Wing Bone on Jin, and Jin finally leveled up. In the process, she\u0027d gained actual wings! Though they were comprised of bone, she wouldn\u0027t need to use the \u0027jet engines\u0027 all across her body anymore to stabilize herself in the air. Steel Heart formed over the bone wings, and by shooting out mana from that section alone, Jin would be able to fly.\\n\\n And there was one more trivial change as well.\\n\\n The moment he\u0027d used the Garuda\u0027s Wing Bone for Bone Reinforcement, both Lee Shin Woo and Jin gained the light element.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-234","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
