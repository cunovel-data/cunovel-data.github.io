I hold the Titan\u0027s Pride.\"\n This was the important part. Lee Shin Woo saw the Giants coming towards him from here and there and replied in an unwavering voice, but he was honestly a bit uneasy.\n There were level 5 and 6 giants, and even a level 7 giant in the middle of them (they were all similarly named \u0027Sealed Titan Zombie\u0027), though there weren\u0027t any elites. Even so, they possessed an overwhelming amount of magic and health.\n \u0027If they become hostile, will I be able to subdue them without killing them?\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo could roughly assess his abilities now, so he knew that they wouldn\u0027t be able to kill him. However, it was difficult to hold back, and there were indeed some powerful Giants amongst them. He didn\u0027t want to kill the Giants. At least, not yet.\n [I don\u0027t feel... any traces of a Giant... within that body.]\n [Is a human... mocking us...?]\n The Giants that had retained their intellect stepped forward and growled. Though their flesh had rotted away, their pride was still intact. They weren\u0027t planning on forgiving someone who so carelessly threw out the word, \u0027Titan\u0027. Despite their strength, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t retreat.\n \"Does it really matter if I\u0027m a Giant or not? What is important is that I have the Titan\u0027s Pride.\"\n [The possessors of the Titan\u0027s Pride... are all Giants!]\n [But you... are no Giant.]\n Despite his knowledge of the Titans and Giants, he was no Giant. This was what Jin had feared, as he\u0027d said before, \u0027What the hell is this guy thinking?\u0027.\n However, Lee Shin Woo stayed firm. He knew how to get out of this situation, but it involved him (the wrongdoer) blaming others for his own wrongdoing.\n \"Haha, what a sad state you\u0027re in. You\u0027ve lost all of your power. Can you really call yourselves Giants looking like that?\"\n [Keuk!?]\n [This guy!]\n As expected, Lee Shin Woo was the type to talk more when he needed to \u0027fight fire with fire\u0027 than if the mood was peaceful and relaxed!\n Lee Shin Woo frantically sifted through the Giant, Fennos\u0027 memories, picked out words he could say that would mentally hurt them (as they had lost both their strength and their very lives) and yelled out as loud as he could.\n \"I\u0027m saying that I\u0027m much better than you guys, as I have not forgotten about the Titan\u0027s Pride, and have continued to pursue that dream, while you guys have forgotten that very pride and have degenerated into such lifeless beings! Indeed, I have inherited Fennos\u0027 will!\"\n [Fennos... Fennos!?]\n [How can that be...?]\n That\u0027s right. He\u0027d activated the Acting and Instigate skills simultaneously, and had swayed them!\n To be honest, he\u0027d run out of things to say regarding the Giants (as his knowledge had bottomed out), so if he asked them about their fundamental issue, then they would be like \u0027We\u0027ll let you off the hook for now, since we have to think about your question right now\u0027. His plan had to work, but if it did, then he\u0027d have to use various tricks to sway them again, so he really didn\u0027t want to.\n [Fennos\u0027 will? How?]\n But fortunately for Lee Shin Woo, they focused on what he\u0027d said. As he thought, Fennos was indeed the Giant who was closest to becoming a Titan.\n \"Hoo.\"\n Although Lee Shin Woo had merely absorbed Fennos\u0027 bone, and never actually conversed with the living Fennos, he was extremely calm. Since he\u0027d gotten this far, he was pretty much already at the finish line.\n There was no need for him to drag the Giants onto his stage. Sitting in the seats was enough. They would witness his act, as the main character of his own monodrama!\n \"I first met him...\"\n Lee Shin Woo used Fennos\u0027 memories of him separating himself from the Giants, acting independently and alone, as well as the fragmented memories after his death to fuel his solo act.\n He began to tell the magnificent story of a Giant who searched for their pride and a wandering human who\u0027d lost their meaning to live, and how they met.\n \"And that\u0027s how he left me with the Titan\u0027s pride and went to his eternal sleep...\"\n [Kuheuk...!]\n [Fennos...!]\n Lee Shin Woo told his story for 45 minutes, and when he was done, most of the level 5 Giants treated him like he was their brother.\n Because they possessed zombie bodies, they couldn\u0027t cry, but their bodies shook as though they were grieving, which made them not look like heartless undead. Jin watched on and was shocked like always.\n [You\u0027re... our friend!]\n [You... helped me before! We\u0027re... comrades!]\n [Comrade! Your heart is that of a Giant!]\n The level 5 Giants couldn\u0027t really speak properly and their thoughts were fragmented, but because Lee Shin Woo had spoken highly of Fennos, they considered him a close friend. Whereas the level 6 Giants, who were capable of rational thought...\n [I thought Fennos would never recognize a human, but... after hearing your story... I understand.]\n [I see. You\u0027ve come to give us back our pride... which we\u0027ve lost...!]\n [It\u0027s irrefutable... We\u0027re pitiful. Perhaps we\u0027d even... forgotten the word... Giant.]\n Thought of him as a trustworthy human. Perhaps they had known that something was wrong with their exhausted bodies following their deterioration. Though they looked at him with rough expressions, they nonetheless looked at Lee Shin Woo positively, which likely stemmed from him awakening them.\n However, this effect was a bit different with the three remaining level 7 Sealed Titan Zombies.\n [There\u0027s no way Fennos would acknowledge a human.]\n [It\u0027s a lie. I can\u0027t believe that Fennos would entrust you with his will.]\n [In any case, it\u0027s a lie. It\u0027s definitely a lie.]\n Those three retained their intellect and their pride as \u0027Giants\u0027. They led the Giants and didn\u0027t accept him, so the other Giants became half-hearted as well.\n [I cannot allow you to come in.]\n [However...]\n [He\u0027s our... friend!]\n [Even so, he cannot enter.]\n Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly at the sight and didn\u0027t attempt to convince them any further. If he couldn\u0027t convince them, even with this extensive use of Instigate, then increasing the intensity of the skill might cause a civil war. That wasn\u0027t what Lee Shin Woo wanted.\n \"What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Giants, I am not trying to enter Perlin Elta. I\u0027ve just come to give back what you have lost!\"\n [Keum...!]\n It was a lie. Lee Shin Woo was sure that the Titan\u0027s Heart lay within the deepest part of Perlin Elta, and he wanted to get his hands on it no matter what. He could even guess as to where it was as well.\n He\u0027d figured it out only after he\u0027d enter the Giants\u0027 domain, but the two undead heroes (who were Giants)... were in the same place as if they were overlapping. They must be protecting the Titan\u0027s Heart.\n \u0027If things go awry and I have to kill all of the Giants, then I have to steal the Titan\u0027s Heart before one of the 12 generals can get to it. However...\u0027\n That scenario was much too plain. He\u0027d finally met a tribe that possessed a completely different power, yet they would only become a single meal for him if he were to implement this plan. It wasn\u0027t what he was looking for.\n Fortunately, he had a way to break through this stalemate. He\u0027d already laid the bait. Now they just needed to take it.\n \"There\u0027s something I have to tell you. You guys are in danger... There\u0027s a chance that you won\u0027t be able to regain the Titan\u0027s Pride and that the entire tribe may be annihilated!\"\n [What... did you say...!?]\n Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled. That\u0027s right. Ironically, the Imperial Army which had discomforted him was helping him now.\n \"The Imperial Army has entered the mountain range. Feotane Von Seldin has broken through the blessing of mana that protects us. The Emperor of the Heita Empire is aiming for the Titan\u0027s Heart!\"\n [What...!]\n [How did they learn about the Titan\u0027s Heart!?]\n The moment the words \u0027Titan\u0027s Heart\u0027 were spoken, almost all of the Giants responded. One of the giants was shocked and its rotten eyes widened, while another tightened its fist; one of them even attacked Lee Shin Woo!\n [Aren\u0027t you part of the Imperial Army!?]\n \"Heup.\"\n One of the level 7 Giants attempted to punch Lee Shin Woo, but he stretched out his hand and blocked it.\n So long as he had Rule of Bone, his strength and health could be reinforced exponentially, and if that overwhelming mana was focused in one place...\n [Ku...ot...!?]\n Even though it was a level 7 Giant, which was over 10 meters tall, Lee Shin Woo could briefly grab its arm and lift it! It was a mere performance that had no actual use on the battlefield, as its mana consumption was extremely high, but that performance was paramount right now.\n \"Has your mind rotted away along with your pride?\"\n [Kuhahk!?]\n Lee Shin Woo said coldly and flung the Giant. Not only had it lost in a bout of strength against a human, but it had also been thrown with just one arm, so it was quite humiliating for the Giant.\n It was so overwhelming that the other Giants were overwhelmed as well, as they watched along vacantly.\n \"If you were to just listen to the Giant I rescued, you would\u0027ve known. And if you can\u0027t trust what I told him, then you can just go out there and see for yourselves! Moreover, if I were part of the Imperial Army, then do you really think I would come to discuss the Titan\u0027s Heart with you!?\"\n [Kuaah...]\n The Giants couldn\u0027t forget what was said, as they were both humiliated and frustrated. Then, the Giant who had led Lee Shin Woo to the village spoke up.\n [I was attacked... by the Imperial Army. They... were surprised once they saw Paul Zero! They\u0027re enemies!]\n [Is that... true?]\n [Are you not... planning on lying... and using us?]\n [He killed... the Empire\u0027s troops! He left none... alive!]\n Lee Shin Woo deliberately didn\u0027t add anything. He believed interfering with their discussion wouldn\u0027t be a good idea. As he thought, they listened more intently to one of their comrades, and suddenly, one of the level 7 Giants spoke.\n [I\u0027ll need to check.]\n [I\u0027m still not sure about him.]\n [We cannot let him enter.]\n [If he really came here to help us, then...]\n [We should be able to verify if that\u0027s the truth or not.]\n With that, the Giants finally agreed. The two level 7 Giants helped the final level 7 Giant up, whose head was buried in the ground, and convinced it. Even though it looked enraged, it soon nodded its head and spoke.\n [We cannot let the Imperial Army take the Titan\u0027s Heart.]\n [We, the giants, are the ones who succeed the Titan\u0027s Pride. Though our bodies have rotten, the Titan\u0027s blood still flows through our veins.]\n [If that\u0027s the case, then... we cannot afford to be wasting time like this.]\n The three gazed at Lee Shin Woo. The other level 5 and level 6 Giants did the same.\n [Paul Zero, you\u0027ll have to verify your own \u0027Titan\u0027s Pride\u0027.]\n [We\u0027ll observe, and make a decision afterwards.]\n Lee Shin Woo\u0027s jawbone clattered as he smiled. Since he really had no reason to hide his feelings from them.\n \"Alright. I\u0027ll show you my pride. No, that shouldn\u0027t be all.\"\n He was sure that the Giants had stepped onto his stage and smiled. He then declared.\n \"We\u0027ll all have to prove our pride on the battlefield against the Imperial Army.\"\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-153","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
