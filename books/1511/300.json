Guaaaaaaah!]\n A wail resounded throughout the battlefield. Who exactly was screaming, and for what reason? Those fighting couldn\u0027t discern the source of the scream.\n But whenever that beautiful, frightening, unforgettable, and horrific scream resounded throughout the battlefield, someone died. Someone would collapse, and someone else wouldn\u0027t be able to move.\n [Aaaaaah. Uaaaaaaaah....!]\n Seira had gotten over her past as a hero, and continued to wail as a Banshee. She continued to wail. Lee Shin Woo was also increasing her strength! A shadow of black flame covered her entire body.\n With the help of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Wild Card skill, not only did her Banshee\u0027s Cry buff allies, but the effects were further increased as well!\n \"This way! This way... Keok!\"\n [I killed one of them! Let\u0027s go!]\n Their allies were weaker and their enemies were stronger. The knights, who had suddenly led the enemy forces, died due to their trivial mistakes. And that allowed the allied forces to regain the lead.\n \"If we just hold out a little while longer, then reinforcements will... R-Reinforcements will...!\"\n [Lord Paul Zero has commanded us. Don\u0027t discriminate and kill them all. Give them the death that we all wish for!]\n The allied forces were stronger due to their extreme change. If they got even the slightest of leads, they wouldn\u0027t allow their enemies time to breathe.\n The allied forces\u0027 blades would always, without fail, cut off their heads or pierce a vital area, while the enemies\u0027 blades would flounder in the air. Some of them even managed to embed their swords into their own bodies!\n \"How can this be? It\u0027s too one-sided...\"\n \"Is that the power of a Banshee? How is a single Banshee doing this to our entire army!?\"\n The Vampires were dumbstruck by the spectacle. Ignoring her tears or her wails was easy enough, but they noticed that wherever her voice reached, there was an increasing frequency of deaths!\n Her voice brought death to the enemy, but it also continuously strengthened the Heaven Defying General\u0027s troops. Moreover, the range of her screams was by no means ordinary! To be honest, the reason that Lee Shin Woo could be absent from this battle was because he could rely on Seira\u0027s authority.\n \u0027Mm. With Fire Shadow\u0027s effects, you can just cry and influence the progress of the battle however you wish.\u0027\n \u0027I told you. Out of everyone, my ability has the highest affinity with you. ...Unfortunately, it\u0027s something I never wished for!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s too late for you to go all tsundere on me at this point... In any case, I\u0027ll leave this to you. If Ye Jin Jin\u0027s my representative for the human side, then you\u0027re my representative for the undead side, not Shino Rendu.\u0027\n \u0027Hoo, of course.\u0027\n \u0027So, I was just wondering. Are you and Shino Rendu...\u0027\n \u0027Though you\u0027ve become my master, you cannot manipulate my emotions as you please. Y-You may be able to do what you want with my body, but... You dirty and underhanded bastard!\u0027\n \u0027Hey, I never said I\u0027d do anything of the sort! I respect your independence you know!\u0027\n Lee Shin Woo recalled his conversation with Seira prior to the battle and smiled. To think he\u0027d be laughing at a conversation with such an infuriating person; he felt that he himself was strange, but he couldn\u0027t help it. He just laughed automatically.\n [Guhiiiiiii! Huoooooooooh!]\n [Hiik!]\n [The Banshee\u0027s crying! She\u0027s looking at me!]\n [We\u0027re going to die! Right now!]\n She continued to scream, but she now wore a smile on her face. Seira became even stronger than before, and there were even some soldiers that fainted at the sight of her. Despite the fact that several of them were undead!\n \"Seira, what exactly are you...\"\n Whereas, Lloyd and the heroes, who had accomplished the most difficult mission of leading the undead here (Why exactly was it the hardest job? Not only was the average level of the Underground Empire\u0027s Imperial Army incredibly high, but the passageway from the capital to the surface was the most perilous), had disguised themselves as a volunteer army that attacked the main force\u0027s rear. In the midst of that, Lloyd\u0027s eyes widened at Seira\u0027s power.\n \"Do people change that much when they become an undead?\"\n \"Perhaps. Love also might\u0027ve changed her. Ah, I see Prince over there. She\u0027s become quite proficient in handling the Fire Demon... No, she\u0027s gotten a lot stronger.\"\n \"Ye Jin Jin is here too. ...Is that really Ye Jin Jin?\"\n They saw Ye Jin Jin throw all manner of throwing projectiles, as well as her flame, to burn countless enemies to a crisp. They knew that she, under Lee Shin Woo\u0027s request, had become stronger, but this was a bit too much, wasn\u0027t it!?\n \"Everyone who\u0027s involved with Lee Shin Woo goes through an extreme change.\"\n \"Keuk...\"\n \"That goes for you too, Lloyd. You grew substantially. Mentally and physically.\"\n \"...Erian.\"\n \"Hey. You can talk about sex later. Focus on the battle for now.\"\n \"S-Sex!?\"\n Lloyd and Erian had a good thing going there, but Kratia, who was quietly casting, coldly interjected. Their job was to protect Kratia until she was finished casting her spell!\n \"Everyone\u0027s changed a lot. Really...\"\n \"You haven\u0027t seen anything yet. You\u0027ll see, once we\u0027ve mostly cleared out the Imperial Army.\"\n \"What happens then?\"\n \"...Ye Jin Jin will show us soon.\"\n Kratia was telling the truth. Ultimately, countless undead had sacrificed themselves to kill Kuroin Von Begner (it was the Underground Empire\u0027s Imperial Army, of course), and once the squads led by the remaining 12 Generals were destroyed, the undead forces pushed even harder, as if aware of their impending victory!\n \"Damn it. These undead never tire, do they!?\"\n \"We\u0027ll be pushed back at this rate. I\u0027m glad that that despicable Begner was killed, but at this rate, everyone will...\"\n \"...Please don\u0027t worry, everyone.\"\n What dramatic timing. ...No, that was a lie. Lee Shin Woo had picked that timing to make it look dramatic. The hero, Izuna, raised her spear and stepped forward.\n \"We have allies that will help us!\"\n \"Allies... Are you referring to that volunteer army?\"\n \"They\u0027re helpful, yes, but that\u0027s not enough to turn the tide...\"\n \"Oh, spirits!\"\n At this point in time, a long speech would be pointless. There was something far greater: feats and results! Once Ye Jin Jin yelled, a giant gate appeared in the center of the battlefield. It was the gate that connected the surface to the Spirits\u0027 Spring.\n The Spirit Princess and now the Immortal Princess, Dana, stepped out of the gate! Her beauty caused the forces to lose all focus and look at her in awe. However, she hadn\u0027t come here for people to marvel at her appearance.\n \"Oh, spirits!\"\n The beautiful and powerful Immortal Princess, Dana, recited her script as politely as possible.\n \"The humans require our aid! These heinous ghosts are dirtying the surface! This land, which is both our base and our place to live!\"\n [Aah, it smells like the curse! This disgusting smell, which seeks to bring everything to death!]\n [Spirits, it\u0027s our turn now! It\u0027s time for us, as residents of this world, to drive out the curse!]\n [Uoooooooh!]\n Though the spirits were somewhat awkward, they nonetheless stuck to their lines. Of course, if one looked at them closely, their awkwardness would show, but because they had appeared when the surface needed them most... it was almost as if God had sent them to aid them.\n \"Ooooooooh!\"\n \"The spirits... the spirits have come to aid us!\"\n \"The hero, Izuna, brought the spirits here to save us!\"\n \"Lady Izuna!\"\n \"The Spirit Queen!\"\n They fell for it. A few well placed individuals yelled out, establishing the mood. It was super effective! Not only were there more and more individuals that yelled Izuna\u0027s name, but they were starting to call Dana the Spirit Queen.\n \"Zenon.\"\n [Am I finally able to show myself?]\n It was perfect timing. No, it was even better. Zenon, who quietly resided within Ye Jin Jin\u0027s dress, materialized himself. At that moment, her magic increased even further. Her magic was strong enough by just wearing the dress, but by materializing, Zenon increased Ye Jin Jin\u0027s power even further!\n \"Indeed. The spirits have forgiven our past transgressions and have decided to help us! We can definitely overcome this hurdle! Together with the spirits! That must be what Sir Kay wished for as well!\"\n \"Uooooooooooh!\"\n \"Us humans won\u0027t lose to the likes of you!\"\n \"The spirits came back for us... Aah, God is smiling down at us!\"\n \"Praise be the sun!\"\n Their confidence soared as if they had become religious zealots! The madness of the battleground must\u0027ve permeated into their brains. If it hadn\u0027t, then the surface dwellers, who had been taught to hate the spirits, wouldn\u0027t so easily accept the spirits! However, that was exactly what Lee Shin Woo had been aiming for.\n [We...We won\u0027t lose!]\n [We will... retake the surface.]\n [The Emperor\u0027s not at fault. He has always struggled to keep his people alive; the spirits are no exception!]\n [Then why... did you try killing us for so long?]\n The mood had shifted entirely in the humans\u0027 favor. The undead couldn\u0027t win anymore. This part was critical. They needed to kill the undead, sure, but they couldn\u0027t afford to kill the Heaven Defying General\u0027s troops as well.\n Now they had to gradually play dead and retreat. It would prove to be incredibly complicated, but Lee Shin Woo had already prepared everything in advance. Dana, who\u0027d appeared with such excellent timing, had been assigned a task that was just as important.\n \u0027Allowing the Hero\u0027s forces to escape. ...Using the Spirits\u0027 Spring.\u0027\n \u0027The Hero is definitely a genius,\u0027 Dana inwardly muttered. The spirits would appear at a critical moment, drawing everyone\u0027s attention. And then, the Heaven Defying General\u0027s troops would quietly retreat.\n No matter how she thought about it, it wasn\u0027t an idea that could be put together by a human. As expected, he was indeed the chosen hero!\n ...However, when everything was falling into place...\n [...Don\u0027t...]\n \"...Huh?\"\n Dana tilted her head at the voice that resounded throughout the battlefield. She wasn\u0027t the only one. Everyone on the battlefield heard that magical voice, forcing them to give up on the battle and focus entirely on the voice.\n [...Shoot.]\n The voice gradually became clearer, and loudly resounded throughout the battlefield.\n [Don\u0027t shoot...]\n And soon, everyone could hear it. Dana marveled its contents and the voice itself. What exactly was happening? Why was he personally intervening now?\n However, it was definitely him. Lee Shin Woo, who had overturned all logic and had created this stage, was yelling.\n [Stop, friendly fire! All of you... stop fighting!]\n The battlefield froze. The sky and the ground were both shining.\n She didn\u0027t know what was happening, but she was sure of one thing... he was overturning all cause-and-effect.\n \"What is this...\"\n Dana muttered vacantly and raised her hand. And she soon realized. Everyone else was undergoing the same evolution that she had.\n The humans, the undead, and the spirits... they all obeyed his will. Seeing that, Dana just laughed despondently. She really had no choice.\n [If you\u0027re all ready, then look and realize.]\n Everyone watched and experienced the world\u0027s changes, and bowed before the god in front of them in worship.\n A god was performing a miracle.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-300","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
