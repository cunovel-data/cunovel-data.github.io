New Golem Maker - 4\u003e\\n\\n Because of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s job on Earth, he had quite the diverse skill set, and his competence was praised by those around him. But even so, that didn\u0027t go into producing wine.\\n\\n The reason he even attempted to make wine was because the winery kept the technicians\u0027 records. And in addition, there was someone he could trust...\\n\\n \"Hello, Pleine. I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"Guten Morgen! Oh my. Now that I think about it, it hasn\u0027t been that long since we last met, Mr. Lee Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n Pleine greeted him enthusiastically, waved her hand at him, stopped, and tilted her head. Soon, her eyes moved in a crescent motion. She was laughing with a satisfied expression, so she was definitely thinking about something weird.\\n\\n \"Did you make some money in that short period of time? No, there\u0027s no way you did. No matter how badly you want to see me, you can\u0027t waste your permits to the secret shop. Didn\u0027t I tell you that each and every permit was like a portion of God\u0027s grace?\"\\n\\n \"I have a lot of money, though.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need to try so hard to lie... Mm.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo said calmly, and his lips curled upwards; at some point, Pleine, who had been probing him, blinked quickly. Was she trying to brag about her eyelashes? Of course, it didn\u0027t have much of an effect on Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n Then, her eyes shined. She let go of her chin, and asked seriously.\\n\\n \"This would be unbelievable, but the one who defeated one of the 12 generals...\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that was me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God...\"\\n\\n It had been a long time since Pleine had looked to God for help, as it seemed like she didn\u0027t even really like God that much. She should\u0027ve heard about the general\u0027s death from God herself, so it seemed like she just didn\u0027t know who had killed him.\\n\\n \"I believe that your growth is incredibly fast, and that you have abilities much greater than your level might imply, but to think you already defeated a general. What are the other heroes doing?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to ask the same thing.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo sighed and replied, but recognized that it was tough to expect the same things from the other heroes.\\n\\n He utilized his karma\u0027s unique properties to infiltrate the city, borrow the strength of several undead, and had even manipulated the Treasure Eater, which had come at an opportune time, to defeat Hansen.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good news. You see, I heard that someone had killed a general, but I didn\u0027t know who exactly did it or how. To think that you were the one who killed him! You\u0027re free, right? Please tell me all the details.\"\\n\\n \"If you want to hear about it, then you need to help me. You see, I have something I really want.\"\\n\\n \"Mmm, alright. So hurry up and tell me all about it.\"\\n\\n It might\u0027ve been the vibe, but Pleine seemed a bit rushed. Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, picked out the core details, and told her about what happened. She looked intrigued at around the midway point.\\n\\n \"Hansen Von Dorthe... I see, he is indeed someone that you could face. Most were reluctant to face him 1 on 1, but you possessed a similar ability to him, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n \"To be honest, certain parts of his ability were strange.\"\\n\\n At that final moment of their 1 on 1 fight, and then experiencing those dense memories by absorbing his bone. At the time, Lee Shin Woo felt that his swordsmanship was a bit familiar.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t just talking about Hansen\u0027s ability to use lightning. Though Hansen had been debuffed, he had been able to predict his sword\u0027s course and the power behind it, so it wasn\u0027t very difficult for him to dodge. In other words, that meant...\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. God created Bursting Thunder by gathering several skills. The Lightning Shadow General\u0027s swordsmanship is also in there.\"\\n\\n \"As I thought.\"\\n\\n Now he understood why he could absorb so many of Hansen\u0027s memories. It was because he already knew swordsmanship that was closely related to Hansen\u0027s.\\n\\n He had solved the puzzle, so he sported a refreshed expression, but was faced with a truly mysterious expression; he didn\u0027t know whether Pleine was looking at him in wonder, or if she was relieved.\\n\\n \"I can understand why God was so excited now. I thought you\u0027d die several times against a general and would have to aim for their weak spot to win. Of course, that in and of itself is plenty amazing, but God raising the maximum level of Invisible Heart was to take that into account...\"\\n\\n To think that he would take down a general without losing a single life. Rather than using any lives, he\u0027d just increased his maximum lives with Invisible Heart.\\n\\n Moreover, whenever he defeated an undead hero and put them to rest, the maximum level of Invisible Heart would increase, so it wouldn\u0027t be impossible for the maximum level of Invisible Heart to continue to increase.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the point in even stockpiling them?\"\\n\\n \"Please just save them. They\u0027ll be really helpful later when you\u0027re faced with a lot of danger.\"\\n\\n And if he managed to save them to the very end... Lee Shin Woo let it go, shrugged his shoulder, and discarded such thoughts. His abilities were still lacking, and the chance of that was quite slim.\\n\\n \"In any case, my goal is to have a quiet and peaceful life no matter what it takes.\"\\n\\n \"How can a level 6 hero who took down a general say that? Any hero passing by would laugh at that.\"\\n\\n \"Of course they would. They would say \u0027what kind of hero is that?\u0027.\"\\n\\n In the process of defeating Hansen, Lee Shin Woo realized that his actions and his plans weren\u0027t all that praiseworthy.\\n\\n Of course, he didn\u0027t feel anything like embarrassment, and although he never really cared about other people\u0027s opinions and was satisfied with the Joker karma...\\n\\n \"But you know, you\u0027re probably the most hero-like out of all the heroes I\u0027ve seen.\"\\n\\n \"...That\u0027s quite surprising. Did you actually hear my explanation?\"\\n\\n Pleine spoke with such a serious expression, so it became a bit embarrassing for him. Because it was embarrassing, he decided to just accept the compliment and move on, but Pleine added more.\\n\\n \"Since you can\u0027t hide your good-heartedness, no matter how cynical you may act.\"\\n\\n \"I really hate human drama.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s quite a coincidence. I really hate human dramas as well. However...\"\\n\\n Pleine smiled mischievously.\\n\\n \"My friend once told me. There is not one person loved by spirits who is a bad person. You\u0027re completely covered in the marks of the Dryads, so I guess that\u0027s not really persuasive.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n As expected, this misunderstanding was because of the Dryads! He needed to explain how he got involved with the Dryads, but that would just prove that he was rotten to the core, so it felt kind of weird. However, he then thought back to Sinea\u0027s pure gaze and felt that it was complicated, so he decided to just let it go.\\n\\n \"Just sell me some stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, how embarrassing.\"\\n\\n \"I want the bone of a wine manufacturer. Please cooperate like you promised.\"\\n\\n \"A wine manufacturer!?\"\\n\\n Pleine, whose head had been filled with ways of teasing Lee Shin Woo, changed immediately! She pushed her body across the counter in an instant and tightly grabbed Lee Shin Woo\u0027s bony hand.\\n\\n \"Are you going to create a winery!? Ah, now that I think about it, you told me that you cleared out an entire winery... There\u0027s a vineyard that\u0027s still alive! Are the winery\u0027s facilities still intact?\"\\n\\n \"Correct answer.\"\\n\\n \"But you usually wouldn\u0027t even think to create wine from there again...!\"\\n\\n \"I have some manpower.\"\\n\\n \"Keuk, Kerr Century\u0027s wine... They\u0027re renowned for their extremely sweet and delicious wine that\u0027s created through their special ripening process. Ripening them for dozens of years may be impossible, but if you continue to go in that direction...! No, I have to find that bone no matter what, no matter what...!\"\\n\\n Pleine seemed to talk a lot more than usual, and eventually, she was lost in her own little world. However, when Lee Shin Woo engaged her in conversation, Pleine stood up suddenly and yelled.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll find it no matter what!\"\\n\\n \"Ooh...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you some books on wine, so please read those while you\u0027re waiting! You know how important theory is!\"\\n\\n \"Ah, I understand.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo, who was frightened by Pleine\u0027s sudden drive, meekly sat down and perused the books she\u0027d given him. Before he could work on replicating Kerr Century Winery\u0027s technique, he needed to have a basic understanding of wine, so these books, which laid out the basics for him, were incredibly helpful.\\n\\n He quickly read through a few volumes, and when he thought about buying these books and going home, he raised his head.\\n\\n \"I found it!\"\\n\\n Pleine\u0027s eyes glimmered, and stuck out a few bones towards him. There were two level 1 bones, one level 2 bone, and surprisingly, one level 4 elite bone.\\n\\n \"Fortunately, I had these in storage. Why are you so surprised? The reason for the Kerr Century Winery\u0027s groundbreaking technique and security was because it was protected by a renowned family of magicians for generations.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Thank you... So how much is it?\"\\n\\n \"30,000 Perium.\"\\n\\n No matter how he thought about it, that was a really low price for a bundle including a level 4 elite bone. However, Lee Shin Woo just decided to pay at her asking price.\\n\\n [Absorbing a Lv4 Skeleton Wizard\u0027s skull through Bone Reinforcement. Absorbing a significant amount of memories and experiences.]\\n\\n [This facility is alive. That is how we made it... in order for it to be in the optimum environment for fermentation and maturation - Unknown Magic Master Craftsman]\\n\\n Pleine, who had been watching him, snorted once he was done absorbing the bones, and asked.\\n\\n \"How is it? Do you know how to do it?\"\\n\\n \"No, the information is too complex, so... It seems like I\u0027ll have to learn by doing.\"\\n\\n \"Do your best...! The revival of the Kerr Century Winery lies in your hands, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\\n\\n Pleine grabbed onto his hands tightly and yelled desperately. It seemed as though she thought the Kerr Century Winery was more important than killing a general... Lee Shin Woo just responded with a smile.\\n\\n \"Please let go. So I can go and try.\"\\n\\n Once Lee Shin Woo had left the shop, amongst all those waiting for him, a Dryads reacted first. It was one of the Dryads that really liked and followed Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n [I smell another woman\u0027s scent on you, Paul Zero.]\\n\\n \"\u0027You know you can\u0027t do that\u0027 is third on my personal ranking of lines I want to hear a woman say at least once in my life, so thanks.\"\\n\\n \"What are you always doing over there that makes you come back so late?\"\\n\\n \"That woman seemed quite unpleasant.\"\\n\\n They kept showering him with complaints, and once Lee Shin Woo checked the time, he realized that four hours had already passed. He told them about what he\u0027d talked about with Pleine, and explained that he\u0027d come back late because he had to wait for her to find the bones.\\n\\n \"You may understand if you watch what I\u0027m about to do.\"\\n\\n \"Mmmm?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, could you call a few Dryads over? I feel like I\u0027ll need your help to make wine.\"\\n\\n [Of course! Just wait sec. I\u0027ll bring some!]\\n\\n The Dryad rushed over to the vineyard. Lee Shin Woo gathered all of the golems, took out a large container, and poured all the grapes out.\\n\\n \"Alright. Then shall we start with mashing the grapes? In order to create this year\u0027s Kerr Century Nouveau...!\"\\n\\n \"Ah, you just said Nouveau, right!? That\u0027s French!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo completely ignored Jin\u0027s retort, and started mashing the grapes. The level 4 golems followed his lead and began moving diligently. The Bronze Golems and up had the basic ability of synchronizing with each other.\\n\\n \"The fact that you\u0027re using this many golems to do this is...\"\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, you\u0027re always so surprising and exhilarating...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not enough! Watch, and follow me more closely!\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was saying something strange again, but Jin and Kratia, who were both used to his eccentricity, didn\u0027t say anything in response. No matter what they said, the golems would just continue to mash the grapes.\\n\\n The Pauls were searching the Empire for a mine, and Lee Shin Woo and the golems were making wine. Work was in full swing.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-123","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
