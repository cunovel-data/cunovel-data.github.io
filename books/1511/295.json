The Final Stage - 5\u003e\n Lee Shin Woo created a hand mirror using the Metal Element and checked his appearance. It was perfect. He looked exactly like the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\n [But will it really be alright, Father? If the Emperor is aware of the Archmage\u0027s death, then...]\n Chi Paul asked worryingly. By reaching level 8, Chi Paul had not only grown substantially in terms of power but had also gained Disguise abilities second only to Lee Shin Woo himself. Thus, he was the best choice to accompany him to the capital. Ironically, Chi Paul was currently disguised as a normal undead.\n Of course, he wasn\u0027t any normal undead. It was more precise to call him an undead hero. Lee Shin Woo knew, from the Archmage\u0027s memories, that the Archmage enjoyed using the undead heroes as guards. Thus, Chi Paul was disguised as an undead hero.\n All the other 12 Generals were dead and the Emperor likely knew this as well, so even if he wanted to impersonate one of the others, he couldn\u0027t.\n [Although the Archmage pledged his loyalty to the Emperor, he doesn\u0027t trust him. The Emperor knew this and respected him anyway. Because of this, their relationship was able to last.]\n [You\u0027re saying that...]\n [The Emperor doesn\u0027t know about the Lich\u0027s death. He has no way of knowing. Of course, he\u0027d be suspicious of the Archmage\u0027s absence, but how long has it been since I killed the Lich? It\u0027s only been four hours. Moreover, before then, the Lich left, stating he\u0027d take care of the heroes. He wouldn\u0027t suspect anything in that short period of time.]\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo, who had got going right away, had killed the Lich and had brought the majority of the undead heroes to his side... However, if he were to go to the capital right now it would be him \u0027returning\u0027 to the capital, not infiltrating it.\n [Ugh, I can finally act like a human, yet I have to take this form.]\n [I\u0027ll turn you into a perfect human someday, so just wait a little longer.]\n Because the Archmage didn\u0027t ride a horse, Jin was currently disguised as an undead hero as well. \n She looked very much like her human form, but because she was \u0027undeadified\u0027, she didn\u0027t seem to like it very much. Only a very, very small portion of her body had bone or muscle exposed, yet she hated it anyway. Whether it be one cheek or one shoulder exposed.\n At the very least, he had left her legs intact so that she could move properly. Moreover, she had covered her body from head-to-toe with silver steel, so she didn\u0027t look like an undead at all.\n [I\u0027m not pretty.]\n [It\u0027s fine. You\u0027re plenty pretty to me. I\u0027m not kidding. You really are.]\n [Then can we kiss?]\n [Nope, no thanks.]\n [You want to die?]\n Jin gritted her teeth at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s firm refusal and practiced walking. She\u0027d been a horse for so long that when she took on her current form, she began placing her hands on the floor.\n However, she was quickly able to adapt, perhaps due to her authority, and was soon able to move quickly on her two feet as well. Lee Shin Woo confirmed that she was able to move on her own, nodded his head, and said.\n [You guys just need to stand a short distance behind me. You don\u0027t need to say anything. Since we\u0027re now entering the heart of enemy territory...]\n Hoo... Lee Shin Woo exhaled (even though nothing came out), and relaxed himself. Of course, he was no longer afraid of the Emperor. This was nothing more than the nervousness of an actor before he got on the big stage.\n While he was at it, he might as well do it perfectly. There were so many unknowns on this stage, so if he were unable to do his job properly, then it would be a pain in the ass later. If he died, he would revive due to Invisible Heart, but he couldn\u0027t revive others.\n He knew he would revive if he died, but he\u0027d rather live than die. He obviously had so many ways he could survive. If he didn\u0027t want to live, then he could always die later. But he couldn\u0027t do that right now.\n [...Alright, let\u0027s trick them to the very end and come out alive.]\n [Pfft, that\u0027s so like you. Sounds good.]\n [You sure have weird taste.]\n [T-Then... Father, excuse me.]\n Jin grinned and came closer to Lee Shin Woo. Chi Paul, looking apologetic, came closer to him as well. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and softly swung his hand.\n Then, just like with the Archmage, the flow of mana connecting the two spaces formed and sucked them in. They were immediately transported to the capital, inside the palace (the most dangerous area within the capital) at that!\n Once they were transported, time began to flow once more. This was proof that Lee Shin Woo both understood and could use the time element better than the Archmage. Hurray for Bone Reinforcement and innate elements!\n [...Archmage?]\n Once they arrived, they faced their very first obstacle. It was the last of the underground\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders, the general who\u0027d killed the Sun Spear General (who had been one of the surface\u0027s Heavenly Commanders), the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman!\n By absorbing the Sun Spear General\u0027s bone, Lee Shin Woo had already seen Leofield\u0027s spearmanship, as well as his other skills. But it was different seeing him in person.\n [Isn\u0027t it obvious, Duke Tariman? Everything you say reeks of sweat.]\n The huge undead came over, and although Lee Shin Woo was nervous from his appearance (a Death Knight), he replied exactly as the Archmage\u0027s memories indicated.\n He was huge; now it made sense that people wondered whether he inherited a Giant\u0027s blood or not. His body was covered in muscles, and these muscles, despite him becoming undead, pulsed and wriggled with cold blood and magic, as well as the air element. The pressure he emitted was so great that it felt like it could stab him to death.\n He\u0027s on the same level as Seagald? No way! Though Seagald\u0027s swordsmanship may surpass Leofield\u0027s, if he compared the degree of perfection of their bodies, as well as their training, then Leofield was superior! He could completely understand why all the spearman he\u0027d come across had yelled Leofield\u0027s name!\n [Hmm, did your job go well...? Huh?]\n [I\u0027d appreciate it if you stopped looking at me like that. Are your ears starting to fail now too?]\n Although the Archmage and the Heaven Sundering General, as two of the Four Heavenly Commanders that pledged their allegiance to the Emperor, respected each other, they possessed a slightly troublesome relationship where that respect wouldn\u0027t show outright.\n As they had reached the pinnacle of their respective arts (magic vs. martial arts), they were prideful in their arts and frequently clashed with each other. However... the Heaven Sundering General\u0027s reaction was a bit strange, considering how he was following the Archmage\u0027s memories to the letter.\n [Are you really... the Archmage? Hmm, something\u0027s strange.]\n [What\u0027s strange is your brain, Duke Tariman. It was always strange; has it finally completely rotted away?]\n [No, I\u0027m not the one who\u0027s strange. The smell... The smell is strange. Hmm... strange. It\u0027s strange.]\n Lee Shin Woo shuddered. Once his Acting skill had passed the level 20 mark, no one had ever seen through his Acting or Disguise skills. However, the rumored musclehead was suspicious of him!\n What the hell happened? No, he had no time to be thinking! If Leofield was suspicious of him, then he\u0027d bring it up to the Emperor as well. He had to stop him!\n [You\u0027re already stupid enough, but if you keep saying the same thing over and over again, you\u0027ll become even stupider. Tell me, what\u0027s so strange? The actions of the heroes? The Anti-Skull led by the damn Seagald? If not, then the Heavenly Commanders that came from the surface?]\n [I\u0027m talking about you, Archmage. You\u0027re strange. My intuition... is telling me that.]\n [Your intuition? You really like that, huh. I was always fed up with that intuition of yours. I hate how you do things without any logic or evidence.]\n [You\u0027re right. I\u0027ve always trusted my intuition.]\n Even if he were to bring up their shared memories, it wouldn\u0027t work. The Heaven Sundering General took out his spear and gripped it. And once he gripped his long, gray spear, the atmosphere inside changed completely.\n When one reaches level 8, they gain an authority: the ability to treat the ambient mana as their own and absorb it. However, the way they go about doing so differed depending on the individual. The Heaven Sundering General seemed to be able to absorb the surrounding mana with his spirit alone.\n [If I\u0027m wrong, I\u0027m truly sorry. But I feel like something will go wrong if I don\u0027t do this. I have to do this no matter what. If His Majesty questions me, then I\u0027ll accept it without question, but I don\u0027t have any choice right now!]\n Heaven Flash. It was sometimes used to describe lightning cascading through the air. If so, then why was it used as the name for Leofield\u0027s attack when he used the air element? The answer was exceedingly simple.\n [Hate me if you must!]\n The moment he\u0027d thrust his spear, it had already reached its target. All you would see was a lightning bolt shooting towards you.\n The shock was akin to getting struck by a lightning bolt. The Heaven Flash would kill anyone equally. And that\u0027s where his title of Heaven Sundering had come from.\n [Critical Hit!]\n Even the Archmage couldn\u0027t dodge this. It was impossible for Lee Shin Woo too.\n Even if he tried to teleport away the moment Leofield went to grip his spear, preemptively attacked him, used the Annihilation Flame to erase his presence and confuse Leofield, or used all of his innate elements combined, the best he could do was turn the spear\u0027s trajectory.\n He wasn\u0027t 100% confident that he could dodge Leofield\u0027s strike even with all that. That was the Heaven Flash. And that was the Heaven Sundering General, a level 8 that had surpassed the limits of a level 8.\n Thus...\n [...You really are the Archmage.]\n [Are you satisfied now, you blockhead?]\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t move at all and let himself get hit by the Heaven Sundering General\u0027s attack. Leofield\u0027s strike had pierced through his armor and bone. Even Lee Shin Woo found it a bit laughable that there was a spear dangling in his forehead.\n [I\u0027m really sorry. This is the first time my intuition\u0027s been wrong.]\n The Heaven Sundering General calmly removed the spear and apologized. To be honest, Leofield hadn\u0027t attacked with the intention to kill. He had just wanted to see if the Archmage was the real deal or not.\n Why? Because the Archmage didn\u0027t need to dodge his attack, as his soul was stored someplace else.\n Even so, it would take a considerable amount of time and mana to restore his (the Lich\u0027s) body, so Leofield had held back so that he didn\u0027t destroy the Lich\u0027s entire body. This was only possible because he was the Heaven Sundering General.\n [The first time? Duke Tariman, this is your second time.]\n [The second time... Ah, that\u0027s right. That was the first time.]\n Lee Shin Woo had wisely brought up one of their shared memories. This was an elaborate ploy to ensure his opponent\u0027s trust! Despite the situation, the Heaven Sundering General smiled lightly and said.\n [The first time I saw you, I was sure that you could cause harm to the Emperor... So I attacked you back then.]\n [Back then, I wasn\u0027t a Lich. I really would\u0027ve died.]\n [I can say this now, but you\u0027re the only person in this world that could counter my attack that way. It\u0027s hilarious that I\u0027m saying this now, but I\u0027ve always been amazed by that magic of yours.]\n [Hmph. I\u0027ll find a way for you to repay me later, so just get back to what you were doing. The battle where we wipe out those dirty invaders is nigh. We have to mobilize all of the capital\u0027s troops.]\n [Of course... For the Emperor!]\n [For the Emperor.]\n The two exchanged hot glances and passed by each other. Leofield hurried, as he needed to gather the troops in time, but Lee Shin Woo needed some time to treat his wound. He naturally slowed his pace.\n [The High Rank Regeneration skill has become Lv7, and Health and Magic have increased by 20.]\n [That asshole. He\u0027s so strong that my Regeneration skill went up by two in one go. A skill that refused to level up at that.]\n [You\u0027re cursing him out even though your skill leveled up.]\n [Your acting was perfect, Father.]\n [...Anyway, that guy\u0027s really scary. The Heaven Sundering General.]\n Lee Shin Woo recollected the Heaven Sunder General\u0027s attack, as well as his \u0027intuition\u0027 that was close to busting him, and trembled. But he couldn\u0027t help but laugh. It was only natural.\n [The Emperor would come to harm due to the Lich, huh... Ha, that guy\u0027s prediction is right on the mark.]\n [I can\u0027t tell whether you\u0027re making an evil expression or not since you\u0027re a skeleton. Remember that.]\n [Ah, I can change my expressions as a skeleton now, you know? Want to see? This looks really evil.]\n [Hey, stop. I said stop.]\n The party joked around and then refocused themselves. They went towards the final battle.\n The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, was waiting for them.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-295","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
