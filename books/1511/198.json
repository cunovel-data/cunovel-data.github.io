The Peddler and the Adventurer - 4\u003e\\n\\n Two weeks had passed since the dungeon countercurrent. During that time, the peddler, Lawrence had cemented his position in Kuroa\u0027s Glory because of the Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay\u0027s influence.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo fearlessly advanced again and again, and was able to buy a villa once used by an aristocrat with good terms, became able to buy/sell various choice goods from the merchant\u0027s guild, and was even authorized to open his own shop. These benefits were supposed to be unattainable by an unknown stranger, yet he had been given them. It made him wonder why he\u0027d worked so hard, struggling with his Acting and Instigation skills thus far.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t call himself a peddler anymore. After all, he was far off from a regular peddler now.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re helping me so openly. ...They\u0027re accepting me, even though they know I\u0027m suspicious. That just tells you how much they want Kay\u0027s power.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo showed off his goods on the display stand outside his store and muttered leisurely. It seemed like he\u0027d just settle down in his shop, but he had bigger ambitions as a peddler.\\n\\n In two weeks, he\u0027d sell the wine in the auction, and after that, he would go to the next city... the capital and sell his goods there. He wasn\u0027t going to take it slow and start from the outer cities as he\u0027d done in the past. Even when he was relaxing, it would be the climax of the story.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t they using you as bait to get to Kay? Since it\u0027s better to keep someone in one place than letting them go around wherever they please.\"\\n\\n \"Jin... You\u0027re a lot smarter than I expect... Hey, wait. I didn\u0027t say anything. It was all my secretary!\"\\n\\n Jin, who was tied outside his shop, asked a good question, but then bit off some of Lee Shin Woo\u0027s hair and nibbled on it. Lee Shin Woo realized that having his hair, which was created by his Disguise skill, ripped off his head, was incredibly unpleasant.\\n\\n However, Jin was right. A powerful individual could become a blessing or a curse. The Emperor, or his followers, should\u0027ve heard the report by now, so the reason they\u0027d let him be for 2 weeks was likely to mobilize someone who could actually contend with Kay.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking forward to their response. Will a level 7 pop up, or a level 8. Depending on who they send, I can estimate how strong the Magic Empire is.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll send a level 8...\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s not necessarily true.\"\\n\\n During these two weeks, Rem had been travelling across the cities and brainwashing the golems. Once its Mana Parasite had gained the Infection ability, its brainwashing speed increased, and the golems in several large cities were already under its control.\\n\\n The information he gained from them increased significantly, and he was able to extract info regarding the Magic Empire\u0027s main force...\\n\\n \"Listen, but don\u0027t be surprised. You might\u0027ve already guessed, but those bestowed with the title and power from the Emperor are known as the \u002712 Generals\u0027. Apparently, they\u0027re not so different from the Underground Empire\u0027s. That means level 8s may exist here too.\"\\n\\n \"...Heh?\"\\n\\n For a moment, Jin didn\u0027t know what Lee Shin Woo was talking about and looked on vacantly. The 12 generals? He\u0027d thought that term was only used in the Underground Empire. However, the Magic Empire used the exact same term. That meant...\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, do the Magic (Surface) Empire and the Underground Empire share the same name?\"\\n\\n \"Ding ding.\"\\n\\n As expected, Jin could be pretty smart when he wanted to be. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction and continued.\\n\\n \"The name of the Magic Empire is Heita. It\u0027s exactly the same as the Underground Empire\u0027s name.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s... Wait a sec. Which one came first?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s unusual. You\u0027re quite sharp today. You go straight to the point.\"\\n\\n \"You know, it\u0027s all because I\u0027ve stuck around you for so long.\"\\n\\n \"I guess you\u0027re right...\"\\n\\n Which came first, the Magic Empire or the Underground Empire? The answer to that question was a lot more important than it might seem. When God had first summoned him, she had called it \u0027The Empire, Heita, which had flourished underground\u0027. That meant there was a chance that humans born underground had created the Underground Empire.\\n\\n \"But unfortunately, humans originated from the surface. I wasn\u0027t sure, so I used every means available to me, and found that humans were indeed born on the surface, not underground.\"\\n\\n \"Then... we can assume that the Empire was once whole, but was split due to some unknown circumstances. One side must\u0027ve gone underground.\"\\n\\n \"Bingo. Exactly.\"\\n\\n It was the shocking truth, but it didn\u0027t really mean anything to him. The history wasn\u0027t what mattered, it was what led history to go down that way, or the cause and effect.\\n\\n \"Think about it, Jin. No matter how wide the underground may be, do you really think that people would voluntarily live down there?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"Although the Empire flourished underground, do you really think they could live as naturally as those on the surface?\"\\n\\n \"...No.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. There\u0027s no way they\u0027d be able to. So, let\u0027s modify what you said. The Empire, which was once whole, split into two for some unknown reason, and one side was \u0027forced to live underground\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n The two heroes daringly and extremely naturally figured out the truth. Once he came to the surface, he knew he\u0027d figure out the truth eventually, but he couldn\u0027t do anything about the bitter taste.\\n\\n To think that the Underground Empire that they had to defeat had such a ridiculous truth behind it. What\u0027s worse, their jobs didn\u0027t change, despite knowing the truth, and they couldn\u0027t do anything for the undead. They had no other choice but to exterminate the undead, just as they\u0027d been doing.\\n\\n \"But that means we can\u0027t trust anything God said to us...\"\\n\\n \"What about? The Underground Empire\u0027s curse? You don\u0027t think the humans on the surface created that, do you!?\"\\n\\n Jin\u0027s blank eye sockets blazed with fury. Unlike Lee Shin Woo, Jin possessed a sense of justice, so he wouldn\u0027t be able to let this go. Even so, they couldn\u0027t change what they were doing, so... Perhaps it would just fester in his heart.\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s not it. The Underground Empire\u0027s undead... When you take a look at the attitudes of the 12 generals, who maintained their intellect, then no. But the Emperor used magic to achieve immortality... and it failed. There\u0027s something else to it, something hidden.\"\\n\\n Honestly, Lee Shin Woo had a hunch before he\u0027d come up here regarding what that truth may be, but once he actually came to the surface, he became even more sure of his assumption.\\n\\n But because it was only a hypothesis without any evidence backing it up, he couldn\u0027t just say it outright. If his hypothesis is true, then... he would have to sock God in the face before he felt any better.\\n\\n \"So, we have to more thoroughly investigate the surface, if for no other reason than to find out the truth. That\u0027s what I\u0027m leaving to Rem.\"\\n\\n At the same time, Lee Shin Woo acted as Lawrence, the peddler, and the hero Kay, gaining what he could from the surface. And what he wanted probably lay in the capital.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo. You\u0027re planning on meeting the Emperor, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to meet him, but if need be. It might turn out that way in the end.\"\\n\\n \"I knew this would happen.\"\\n\\n He remembered Pleine\u0027s warning. She didn\u0027t say it outright, but he\u0027d guessed how powerful the Emperor was based on her attitude.\\n\\n He was probably level 9. If not, then Pleine wouldn\u0027t have warned him like that. Since Lee Shin Woo could take on a level 8 now. Even if he fought against Feotane Von Seldin, he could come out of it alive.\\n\\n \u0027But I can\u0027t avoid him just because he\u0027s dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n Pleine had misunderstood something. Although he had to oppose all the undead, he didn\u0027t need to do that for the surface dwellers. He didn\u0027t need to avoid him like the plague just because his level was high.\\n\\n Could the Emperor even see through his Disguise and Acting skills? He was joking of course, but Lee Shin Woo thought he\u0027d be able to somewhat trick God at this point. No matter how high their level was, so long as they were a human, they won\u0027t be able to see through Lee Shin Woo\u0027s facade.\\n\\n \"You know, it might be fun to become one of the 12 generals in the meantime...\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s not...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I was just joking. Even I\u0027m not confident enough to work under him and keep acting.\"\\n\\n Right after he spoke, he felt someone coming towards his shop. When he looked over, he saw a heavily armed female knight. It was kind of funny seeing her being so tense around a peddler.\\n\\n \"D-Does the Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay live here?\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t, but he lives in a place where I can contact him.\"\\n\\n \"Then please relay this message to Sir Kay! The pope of the Sun God religion requests an audience! He came to the lord\u0027s castle without any prior notice, so you have no idea how surprised we... Eup.\"\\n\\n \"...Oh?\"\\n\\n He thought it\u0027d be better if he seemed more distinguished, so he\u0027d called himself the Sun God\u0027s hero. To think it\u0027d turn out like this. However... the Sun God religion. It wasn\u0027t so bad when he thought about it. No, it was actually great.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t know how prosperous the Sun God religion was, but considering how the female knight was acting, they were definitely an organization that the Magic Empire couldn\u0027t deal with so easily. If that\u0027s the case, then he would be able to meet with the Emperor assuming a more favorable position.\\n\\n He immediately formulated several plans in his head, and continuously broke up and reassembled pieces of his plan. As a result...\\n\\n \"I understand. I\u0027ll tell him right away.\"\\n\\n \"Mm, thank you. We can prepare a carriage for you...\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027ll probably arrive there on his own.\"\\n\\n \"Mm, that would be disrespectful to the Sun God\u0027s hero... However, if that\u0027s what he wants, then I guess we have no choice. I understand. I\u0027ll let them know. Then I\u0027ll get going now...\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Come back again!\"\\n\\n The female knight sighed in relief and left. Lee Shin Woo thought he needed an assistant ASAP and cleaned the store. He couldn\u0027t get there on a horse, so he would have to leave Jin here.\\n\\n \u0027See you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ok.\u0027\\n\\n He first disguised himself as Kay where no one was looking. Then, he tied the greatsword on his back and walk over to the lord\u0027s castle. Lee Shin Woo looked incredibly dignified, and everyone he passed on the road took notice of him. Moreover, fire wrapped around his surroundings, so there was no one who didn\u0027t know who he was.\\n\\n He encountered various people along the way. Some spoke of the \u0027Sun God\u0027s hero\u0027 from behind him, while others approached him and said it to his face. There were even some who were afraid of being harmed and just stepped back. Of course, this would enhance the influence of the Sun God\u0027s hero, Kay, and at the same time, ensure that Lawrence, the peddler, would remain safe.\\n\\n [Lv7 Pope of the Sun God religion - Aurel Genisman]\\n\\n 30 minutes later, Lee Shin Woo met the Pope of the Sun God religion in the castle\u0027s living room. From first glance, he looked like a middle-aged man, but his level was higher than he\u0027d expected. He wasn\u0027t just a representative of the religion.\\n\\n \"You moved quite boisterously. So much so that I question how you were able to hide your identity until now.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s fine since the Emperor\u0027s no doubt aware that we\u0027ve come here. No... actually, that ostentatious attitude of yours might fit with our goal. You may just be acting conspicuous, but that\u0027s even more in our favor.\"\\n\\n \"...Hoh.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo understood what he was saying and smiled. He thought the pope would say something like \u0027You\u0027re the hero the Sun God has chosen!? I can\u0027t believe it!\u0027 and test him first, but was instead showing his hand.\\n\\n In layman\u0027s terms, this was the Pope\u0027s intent. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re really the Sun God\u0027s hero or not. Why don\u0027t you work with us?\u0027.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to hear about it in more detail.\"\\n\\n Honestly, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t hate these kinds of people. If their goals aligned, they would have a good relationship.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you understand, Sun God\u0027s hero.\"\\n\\n The Pope grinned and said.\\n\\n Unfortunately for the people on the surface, Lee Shin Woo and the Pope really hit it off.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-198","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
