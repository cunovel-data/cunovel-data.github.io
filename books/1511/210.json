Moreover, he\u0027d also obtained a crucial springboard to conquering the surface. Funnily enough, none of this had come about due to his extensive planning, but due to him bringing Sinea with him without really thinking.\n \"You really don\u0027t know what\u0027ll happen in life.\"\n \"It\u0027s really moving hearing that from you.\"\n Jin replied teasingly. So many good things had happened, yet Jin didn\u0027t seem very happy. The reason was quite simple.\n Sinea had approached Lee Shin Woo quite aggressively, but once he\u0027d formed an official contract with her, she was so happy that she clung onto him like a girl who\u0027d been in a relationship for 2 weeks.\n [Hoo. Hoo. Paul Zero.]\n \"We\u0027ve already formed a contract; do you not need to use my real name?\"\n [An exchange of one\u0027s real name is like a wedding ring, so it\u0027s fine.]\n \"I-Is it...\"\n Lee Shin Woo finally understood how she felt about him. Apparently, a formal contract with a spirit is like a wedding ceremony. Even more so when the spirits\u0027 gender is clearly distinguished like the Dryads (the Dryads are all female)!\n She had been waiting for the time to form an official contract with him, yet Lee Shin Woo had the gall to form a contract with 10,000 other spirits first. So he could understand her pent-up frustration.\n \"Hoo...\"\n [You can stare at me all you want, I\u0027m not going to give Paul Zero to you!]\n \"...\"\n At this point, Jin actually appreciated that she recognized him as a rival, which was all the more pitiful. That unspeakable misery made Jin think, \u0027can I score a point now?\u0027, but then, their last remaining party member said.\n [Will this really be ok?]\n The spirit shaped like a flaming lizard was, of course, the level 7 Elder Salamander Prince Zenon. Lee Shin Woo had ordered the other spirits to form teams and find the newly born spirits on the surface, but he had asked Zenon to follow him.\n \"Don\u0027t worry. Even the 12 generals wouldn\u0027t be able to recognize you when you\u0027re hidden within the flames I\u0027ve created.\"\n [No, I\u0027m ok. I\u0027m right beside you, so I won\u0027t be in danger. I\u0027m worried about the other spirits.]\n He was thankful for the overestimation, but Lee Shin Woo was still level 7. Of course, if he told Zenon that he was level 7, he wouldn\u0027t believe him. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s stats were on the cusp of level 8, he possessed a variety of high rank skills, and his level 11 Rule of Bone skill increased his stats equivalent to a level 8.\n \u0027I\u0027m this strong at level 7, so what\u0027ll happen when I reach level 8...\u0027\n He was confident that he could take on the level 8 12 generals head-on when he hit level 8. Even if he encountered that Lich again! Lee Shin Woo could manage against the Lich due to the buffs from his Rebellion skill if they were to fight right now. Even from his own point of view, he felt like he didn\u0027t have any weak spots.\n [Do you have a plan?]\n \"A plan? Ah, you mean for the spirits that can go to the surface now. Nope.\"\n [Keut.]\n Lee Shin Woo replied irresponsibly and Zenon looked like he was at his wit\u0027s end. When they had formed a contract, Zenon had seemed so confident, but now that the excitement had worn off he seemed fearful again. Lee Shin Woo sighed and said.\n \"Like I said, I\u0027ve taken control of the Emperor\u0027s golem network that orders the golems to search for and kill any spirits they find. For now, no one will find out about the spirits. Of course, there\u0027s no helping the ones who are unluckily found.\"\n [Then that means they\u0027re in danger...!]\n \"So you wanted revenge when you\u0027re not willing to risk anything to get it?\"\n [Keuk...]\n Zenon\u0027s weak response caused Lee Shin Woo to sigh once again. How was he such a coward? His attitude didn\u0027t fit his appearance at all.\n Of course, he\u0027d expected this from the very beginning. If coaxing them to fight had been easy, and they had sufficient courage while being willing to charge into danger without hesitation, then they wouldn\u0027t have hidden within the Spirits\u0027 Spring in the first place.\n \"That\u0027s what war is like. Each person risks their life. Moreover, the task I\u0027ve assigned to the spirits is their most important one; it\u0027s for the spirits\u0027 \u0027future\u0027 and what they\u0027ll do after the battle is over. If they can\u0027t do that, then give up on your revenge.\"\n [...I can\u0027t give up. We all agree on this.]\n \"Good. Don\u0027t forget that feeling.\"\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t planning on leaving the spirits to die. The golem network would help, but he also left some spirits on standby within the Spirits\u0027 Spring; these spirits would act as a \u0027rescue unit\u0027 and were ready to be deployed whenever necessary.\n If they were to die, even though he went through all this effort, then there was really no helping it. They were executing their plan in a much safer environment than the Paul Zero Corps, which was going around the Underground Empire and hunting the undead.\n [I\u0027m willing to die for you, Paul Zero. But before then, I\u0027d like to leave behind a child.]\n \"Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027re not going to die.\"\n [Paul Zero...]\n Weren\u0027t Dryads birthed from trees? So if they had another way of leaving behind children, then what was it?\n He wanted to ask, but at the same time, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety, so he kept it to himself. Following his official contract with her, Sinea began to look at him more sensuously than before. Perhaps... No, he\u0027d figure that out when they were alone.\n [It\u0027s good to be loved by a spirit. You even got the Spirits\u0027 Spring to respond to you; you truly are an impressive Elementalist.]\n \"Mm, you\u0027ll see that later.\"\n Zenon seemed truly awestruck by Lee Shin Woo. On the other hand, Lee Shin Woo just felt bitter, replied, and hurried on his way.\n They would soon reach the end of the Spirits\u0027 Road. Lee Shin Woo had set it up so that they would arrive outside of the thicket near Kuroa\u0027s Glory. At first, it had taken several hours to get to the Spirits\u0027 Spring, but it only took a few minutes on the way back.\n \"If I can control the exit, then I can go wherever I wish on the surface without the Heaven Door\u0027s Key.\"\n \"You\u0027re too greedy.\"\n \"Greedy? You\u0027d be surprised how much I\u0027m holding back right now. If you knew, you\u0027d be shocked.\"\n \"Y-Yeah...?\"\n Jin tilted his head at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s unbelievable response. However, Lee Shin Woo was telling the truth. Although he\u0027d become able to transform into a spirit, and had leveled up his Disguise skill, enabling him to transform into a human, he desperately held back his desires with the thought \u0027not while Jin\u0027s here\u0027.\n Moreover, he\u0027d even formed a contract with 10,000 spirits and the Spirits\u0027 Spring itself, so a compliment wouldn\u0027t even be enough.\n \"It\u0027s already night. Rest up for now, Jin. Starting tomorrow, you probably won\u0027t have anything to do for two days.\"\n \"Ok. Then call me when you\u0027re free. Let\u0027s play some board games.\"\n When he heard the word \u0027board games\u0027, Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled bitterly. Board games. As Jin couldn\u0027t sleep or eat, Lee Shin Woo had thought of board games as a way to pass the time. Since he wanted to prove that humans had other methods of relieving stress other than eating or sleeping.\n Of course, there was no way that this world had any proper board games. He referenced some of the board games he\u0027d played on Earth and created them in his spare time, but Jin had reacted a lot better to them than he\u0027d expected. Jin pointed out that his world had board games like this too, but Lee Shin Woo just used the excuse of parallel worlds. It was his \u0027absolute defense\u0027 skill.\n \"Sure, I can always spare some time for some board games.\"\n \"Ok. Then, see you tomorrow.\"\n He tied Jin to his normal spot. Jin could clearly see him if he looked through the 1st floor window, but from the 2nd floor, Lee Shin Woo was free from his gaze.\n Lee Shin Woo discreetly checked his inventory and inwardly clenched his fist. Ultimately, he triumphantly passed the living room and when he was about to go up to the 2nd floor, someone stopped him. Ye Jin Jin was quietly doing paperwork in the living room.\n \"Ah, Mr. Shin Woo! Welcome back.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t asleep? You\u0027ll be busy tomorrow too.\"\n \"Well, I thought if I finished my work a little quicker, then I would be able to go on a date with you before you go to the capital... Ah, that\u0027s only if you accept, Mr. Shin Woo!\"\n [...Seems like you\u0027re not only loved by spirits.]\n Ye Jin Jin replied and her cheeks became flushed. Seeing that, Zenon (he was hiding his existence, so Ye Jin Jin couldn\u0027t hear him) quietly muttered. Lee Shin Woo ignored him and replied.\n \"Don\u0027t sleep too late.\"\n \"Ok! I\u0027ll read just a little bit more and then I\u0027ll go to sleep.\"\n \"Alright.\"\n Lee Shin Woo was actually quite surprised by her growth. After their first meeting Ye Jin Jin began to grow rapidly, and when she came to the surface she quickly picked up the shop business. She had so much latent potential that he couldn\u0027t help but say \u0027as expected of a hero\u0027.\n He knew what the driving force behind her actions was, so he was a bit concerned, but... He should be able to solve that problem. Why? Because he could turn into a human now! If she\u0027s seeking his affection, then he could give it to her bit by bit.\n \u0027This is nothing compared to my days of entertaining clients as an employee.\u0027\n He couldn\u0027t even count how many times he\u0027d eaten together with a girl or attended a party in order to close a deal. That wasn\u0027t all. He\u0027d been asked for more more than twice before. When he really hated it, he did anything he could to get out of it.\n But that was what work life was. You use everything you could get your hands on to succeed, or you keep your pride and chastity... Whichever you choose, you would have to make a choice you didn\u0027t like again and again.\n \u0027How does it compare to back then? She\u0027s a cute girl that\u0027ll do anything I ask of her. This is actually a win-win... It doesn\u0027t even compare to South Korea.\u0027\n If they knew about the environment he was in, all salarymen would clamor at him to change places with them. He had no plans of switching with them, Lee Shin Woo thought, and raised his head. Lee Shin Woo had already reached his room.\n \"Huh? What about Zenon?\"\n [I told him go away and go to sleep. I don\u0027t have the time to deal with him when you\u0027re by my side, Paul Zero.]\n Sinea said coldly, but soon her expression changed. She approached Lee Shin Woo\u0027s side and he realized that she\u0027d found out about his Disguise skill’s upgrade.\n \"When did you find out?\"\n [Paul Zero, you can transform into a spirit too.]\n \"...I see.\"\n How did he not notice? Lee Shin Woo felt like he was an idiot. If spirits could eat and sleep, then they had reproductive abilities as well. And since Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in transforming into a spirit...\n \"Is that when you decided you had to form a contract with me?\"\n [I decided to form a contract with you before then, but it\u0027s true that the situation was good.]\n \"Is that so... Wait a sec. There was something I wanted to do when I turned back into a human.\"\n Lee Shin Woo stopped Sinea, who looked at him like a predator would its prey, and took out a bottle of wine from his inventory. It was the Kerr Century Elemental 451.\n [Oh my. This is the wine we made together. It really fits.]\n \"That wasn\u0027t my intention, but... You want a drink too?\"\n [Yeah.]\n Lee Shin Woo brought the wine glass to his lips and felt something. When was the last time he\u0027d drunk wine? It\u0027s definitely been more than a year. Moreover, he\u0027d spent such dark days in the Underground Empire, so it felt like it\u0027d been even longer since his last sip.\n \"...Aah.\"\n But he could accept it if this was the result of all that hard work. Since good wine was created by proper maturation.\n [It really is delicious.]\n \"Yeah. ...It\u0027s so delicious I feel like I\u0027ll cry.\"\n He could smell the aroma of the wine with his disguised nose, and the wine travelled down his disguised tongue and passed through his disguised throat. It was then heated up by his disguised stomach. This feeling, which he\u0027d regained, felt like ecstasy.\n [Hoo.]\n Then, Sinea smiled mysteriously and got even closer. It seemed like she wasn\u0027t willing to wait any longer.\n Honestly speaking, he wanted to enjoy the wine a bit longer, but it couldn\u0027t be helped. He shrugged his shoulders and accepted her. The Dryads\u0027 refreshing and sweet aroma invaded his nose.\n \u0027This is also business. ...A win-win, huh. How nice.\u0027\n Two days later, Lee Shin Woo had completely finished his work as Lawrence and he and his party went on a short trip to the capital.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-210","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
