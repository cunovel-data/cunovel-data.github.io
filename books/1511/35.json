Partner - 1\u003e\\n\\n \"Did you wait a long time?\"\\n\\n In just 13 hours, Jin had returned with the leather bag Lee Shin Woo had given him completely filled, speaking like a girlfriend who had arrived late to their meeting place. Of course, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t even have a girlfriend before, so he wasn\u0027t bothered at all and spoke.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s alright, since I was busy reading this.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo raised and showed the bundle of papers to Jin, who carefully thrust his head forward; the edges of the papers were gradually weathering away and disappearing with every gust of wind. Jin likewise didn\u0027t know the Empire\u0027s language, but he could read the title of the documents without much difficulty.\\n\\n \"The Anti-Skull... Plan?\"\\n\\n \"You wanna read it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah...\"\\n\\n Originally, he didn\u0027t really like reading very much, but Jin thought that there was something more to these papers than just a waste of time; yet he couldn\u0027t joke like that as Lee Shin Woo\u0027s face was much too serious.\\n\\n Ultimately, he nodded his head, and Lee Shin Woo laid one of the papers on the ground, which best summarized the current state of affairs, so that he could read it easily. Lee Shin Woo then turned his head back to the papers. It was the last page.\\n\\n \"This is... Did the Empire have a force that knew about the impending curse and was preparing for it by any chance!?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, so you didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n For a few hours after clearing and leaving the dungeon, Lee Shin Woo thoroughly scrutinized the data he\u0027d acquired from the sewer hidden facilities.\\n\\n Anti-Skull was lead by General Seagald, and was a group created to prevent the Emperor\u0027s plan; at the same time, it was the name of the project that researched ways to prevent them from becoming undead.\\n\\n \"There\u0027re detailed records written here about their research into preventing them from becoming undead. In laymen\u0027s terms, at the heart of the research was their attempt to magically create a body beforehand which wouldn\u0027t be affected by the curse.\"\\n\\n \"So what happened? Did they succeed?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Was it because he was also undead? Jin asked in a deeply interested voice, and Lee Shin Woo replied firmly, cutting him off.\\n\\n That\u0027s right. The plan progressed in multiple ways, but all of them became frustrated. There were several cases where the tested individuals exploded, and it was common that their bodies wouldn\u0027t even be able to use mana anymore.\\n\\n On the contrary, this experiment with Acid Poison wasn\u0027t bad. The test subjects didn\u0027t die, and actually became stronger; though they degenerated into the undead, they were able to retain their memories and their reason as well.\\n\\n \u0027Even if they meet humans, the current Pauls shouldn\u0027t be driven by their hatred.\u0027\\n\\n Regardless of their intent, all undead hated humans. It was like a suggestion engraved into their instincts. Because of that, humans also consider undead enemies. Though Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t really know about it since he was an undead as soon as he arrived in the Empire!\\n\\n \u0027I wonder what state General Seagald is in?\u0027\\n\\n Based on the reports, General Seagald was gathering forces through various means to prevent the Emperor\u0027s plan, while also actively participating in the Anti-Skullâ€™s experiments with his subordinates.\\n\\n In the past, he opposed the Emperor and certainly raised a force, but considering how he couldn\u0027t prevent the curse despite that, his rebellion must\u0027ve failed in the end. What happened to him as a result? Was he still alive, surviving as an undead? If he\u0027s still alive, what would be the state of his reasoning?\\n\\n The day would come where he\u0027d be able to figure this out. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t really need to take the lead and figure it out himself. Since there were a lot of seniors already ahead of him.\\n\\n \"Do the other heroes know about this?\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t they? I don\u0027t really have any plans to check, but they probably do.\"\\n\\n Of course, he had coincidentally learned of Anti-Skull in the sewer dungeon, but there were various secret facilities hidden throughout the Empire. If he assumed that the majority of them had become dungeons, a portion of his seniors should\u0027ve been able to find them already. At least, that\u0027s what Lee Shin Woo thought.\\n\\n \"You did some quests, right?\"\\n\\n \"I got the inventory and the chatting channel as well.\"\\n\\n As if he were demonstrating, Jin put the leather bag in and out of his inventory. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and took the bag.\\n\\n There were different bones that filled the bag to the brim, and they were all bones from at least level 2 monsters, just like Lee Shin Woo had instructed. Rarely, he saw some level 3 bones as well.\\n\\n \"How was your hunt?\"\\n\\n \"When I actually got started, it wasn\u0027t that hard. It felt like I got a bit used to battle in just a few hours. ...Yeah, laugh it up.\"\\n\\n \"Nah, it\u0027s normally like that.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo finished inspecting the bones and raised his head, locking gazes with Jin. His face, which blazed with blue goblin fire, came right in front of his own.\\n\\n \"Now you\u0027re going to accept me as your colleague, right?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. However, there\u0027s something I\u0027d like to check before that. What\u0027s the ability you got from God as you were dropped onto this world?\"\\n\\n \"Mmm, that\u0027s... well you\u0027re undead too, so I guess it\u0027s fine to tell you.\"\\n\\n Jin was briefly conflicted, but soon he scanned Lee Shin Woo\u0027s body and slightly nodded his head, and opened his mouth for the second time. In a way, Lee Shin Woo had anticipated what he had to say, but at the same time, his expectations were completely off.\\n\\n \"Truthfully, I have an ability that revives me even if I die. It\u0027s an ability called the Blessing of Death; the magic of the curse is absorbed, and the accumulated power is changed into a blessing. Even if I die, it makes it possible for me to revive.\"\\n\\n \"The magic of the curse? Ah.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s why I\u0027m accumulating magic even now. It\u0027s not very much, though...\"\\n\\n The curse\u0027s magic, which transformed people into the undead, was overflowing in this world right now. In exchange for Jin having no curse resistance, his skill took care of it. It was a complete surprise to Lee Shin Woo, who thought Jin would definitely have the \u0027Invisible Heart\u0027 like him.\\n\\n \"Though the magic I\u0027ve accumulated is only enough to revive me twice.\"\\n\\n \"So the reason you just constantly ran was because of that skill\u0027s effect, huh.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s embarrassing, but... yeah.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo felt refreshed. He had thought that no matter how depressed Jin was from becoming a Skeleton Horse, just constantly running was too much, but after learning about his ability, he realized that Jin had run to stockpile the necessary energy to activate his skill.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve already died once, so I\u0027ve become afraid of dying again. I couldn\u0027t tell Jin Jin, but that\u0027s how it is. I\u0027m pathetic, right?\"\\n\\n \"No, I understand. Very sincerely.\"\\n\\n The reason Lee Shin Woo could decide to fight without much difficulty as soon as he was dropped into the Empire was because he could revive 99 times. If he had arrived with the same skill Jin had, he would\u0027ve done the same as him.\\n\\n \u0027In any case, when I compare his ability to mine, it\u0027s kind of subtle.\u0027\\n\\n After listening to him, it seemed as though Jin\u0027s ability didn\u0027t have a limited number of uses, but it also seemed like Jin\u0027s ability would require him to gather a tremendous amount of mana to activate the skill.\\n\\n In other words, he could futilely die before he gathered the required mana if he was unlucky. That probably contributed to him becoming more of a coward. He suddenly thought that God was truly ill-tempered.\\n\\n \"What about curse resistance and holy resistance?\"\\n\\n \"I have both of them. They\u0027re maxed out. It seems like my curse absorption is the evolved form of maxed out curse resistance.\"\\n\\n \"As I thought.\"\\n\\n His absorption was the evolved form of maxed curse resistance... Lee Shin Woo decided he\u0027d store away that information for now, and nodded his head. Jin felt relieved when he saw Lee Shin Woo unperturbed and nodding his head, even after hearing about his revival ability.\\n\\n \"So you received an ability similar to mine, huh. I wondered whether I was the only one like this.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, though my revival conditions are a bit different.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo explained the effects of Invisible Heart to him. Jin could\u0027ve been really uncomfortable hearing it, but he didn\u0027t want to lie to someone he sympathized with. As expected, Jin was jealous of him.\\n\\n \"You have 97 more lives!? I\u0027m so jealous...!\"\\n\\n \"But the number of lives is annoying. So my goal right now is to die as little as possible. Acting as though I only have one life, and that I\u0027m not undead.\"\\n\\n \"...Yeah, I agree with you.\"\\n\\n From the start, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s attitude was something that Jin also wanted to learn. That attitude, where he didn\u0027t succumb to despair and endured firmly, despite being in a similar situation, and pressing forward!\\n\\n However, Lee Shin Woo seemed burdened by Jin\u0027s blazing gaze (though in reality, it was always blazing), and slightly turned his head away and spoke.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not all, right? Isn\u0027t there more that you got?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yeah... In the process of becoming a Skeleton Horse, or more precisely, a [Dark Bone Horse], I became level 4. And lastly, I got a skill called [Child of Light].\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that? Does it let you kick at the speed of light or something?\"\\n\\n Amongst the several lines he\u0027d always wanted to say, Lee Shin Woo mentioned one of them. Jin then cold-heartedly shook his head and spoke.\\n\\n \"By receiving the Blessing of Light, my agility growth rate increases by three times.\"\\n\\n \"...Growth rate is kind of vague, so what does it mean in more detail?\"\\n\\n Even as he thought that Jin should be called the Child of Char[1] instead of the Child of Light, he asked for more details. Without hesitating, Jin elaborated. Without even realizing how amazing his own ability was.\\n\\n \"Whenever I gain agility, for whatever the reason, I gain three agility when others gain 1. That\u0027s my karma or whatever.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever the reason...!?\"\\n\\n That\u0027s bullshit! Three times the agility no matter what? Increases in agility from karma, skills, and drinking the shopâ€™s medicine would be three times that of any other person! Though it was a cheat skill he could gain only after becoming a Skeleton Horse.\\n\\n \"It seems like it\u0027s an ability that\u0027s so good that it surprises even you. Well, my agility did shoot up as I continually ran, when my skills leveled up, or when I received some karma for running really fast. I feel like my agility was around 500 at the beginning, but right now it\u0027s close to 800.\"\\n\\n \"800!?\"\\n\\n He already surpassed Lee Shin Woo with just his agility! Now he could understand his fearsome growth rate. If he were to exclude the increase in effectiveness of his other stats, he already had agility that rivaled a level 6\u0027s!\\n\\n \u0027Wait a sec.\u0027\\n\\n At that point, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought. If that\u0027s the case, then would his ability activate when he reinforces his bones, too...?\\n\\n If that\u0027s actually true, then his compatibility with Jin would result in an absurd outcome beyond his imagination. Jin could naturally attain a tremendous result, and Lee Shin Woo fighting in battle from his back...!\\n\\n \u0027Did God not expect this?\u0027\\n\\n These two unusual individuals\u0027 karma met and would create a ridiculous synergistic effect. If it\u0027s her, who was the God of this world, she probably could\u0027ve predicted this.\\n\\n If that\u0027s the case, then God had predicted that they\u0027d work together at some point... and there\u0027s a possibility that she\u0027d guided them such that they would. She didn\u0027t just make them undead simply due to her ill nature, but perhaps she wanted them to accomplish the tasks that \u0027couldn\u0027t be accomplished by normal humans\u0027.\\n\\n ...Though she could\u0027ve just done it on a whim.\\n\\n \"Do you also have a different ability?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n He was in deep thought, so he forgot that Jin was right in front of him. He saw Jin waiting for his response, and extracted a level 2 bone from the leather bag; he raised it, smiled mischievously (that kind of feeling), and replied.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do have one. From the start, all of my abilities are because of this skill.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of ability could it be for it to...?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll teach you using your own body.\"\\n\\n \"What...!?\"\\n\\n \"Be careful, since your head might hurt in the beginning.\"\\n\\n For some reason, Jin was shocked and stepped back, but Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t concerned by that and yelled.\\n\\n \"Bone Reinforcement!\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Char is a character from Mobile Suit Gundam.
