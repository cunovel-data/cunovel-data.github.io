A Joker is Born - 6\u003e\\n\\n [Lee Shin Woo]\\n\\n [Elemental Skeleton Joker]\\n\\n [He who Conquers the Impossible; 2 other titles]\\n\\n [Lv - 5 (Status effectiveness 170%)]\\n\\n [Strength - 397 Agility - 376 Health - 372 Magic - 577]\\n\\n [Passive skills - Acting Lv11, Invisible Heart Lv3, Low Rank Avenger Lv2, Intermediate Bursting Thunder Lv1, Intermediate Mana Bone Lv1, Intermediate Shadow Sprint Lv1, Low Rank Command Lv8, Intermediate Assimilation Lv1, Intermediate Combat Sense Lv4]\\n\\n [Active skills - Disguise Lv1, Bone Reinforcement Lv6, Rule of Bone Lv4, Bone Armory Lv2, Low Rank Shriek of the Dead Lv8, Low Rank Regeneration Lv7, Sacrifice Lv1]\\n\\n [Elements - Low Rank Fire Lv4, Intermediate Acid Lv4, Intermediate Lightning Lv1]\\n\\n [Resistances - Holy: MAX, Curses: MAX, Acid: Low Rank Lv9, Ice: Intermediate Lv2]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo looked vacantly at his dazzling status and then asked Jin with a vacant voice.\\n\\n \"Jin, is your status effectiveness also 170%?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It seems like that\u0027s the same for everyone.And when you get to level 6, it becomes 200%.\"\\n\\n \"So the gradually increasing effectiveness increases even further, huh.\"\\n\\n He could outright say this. This world wasn\u0027t set up such that a lower leveled individual could beat a higher leveled individual. Lee Shin Woo suddenly regarded him beating the level 5 Treasure Eater when he was still at level 3 as a miracle.\\n\\n \u0027Is it even possible to beat a level 6 opponent? You can only reach level 6 by accumulating 3,200 stats and the effectiveness of one\u0027s stats are even increased by another 30%... There\u0027s way too much of a difference.\u0027\\n\\n Even if he factored in Jin, who at least doubled his fighting strength, it was the same. He wasn\u0027t confident that he could defeat Kratia if they were far off from each other. Especially when he considered the power of the catalyst magic she\u0027d cast just recently.\\n\\n \u0027Is Bursting Thunder and the reinforced elements my only shot? Those would increase the \u0027level\u0027 of my magic and if I were to add Rule of Bone to that, the \u0027level\u0027 of my physical abilities would increase as well; with that, I would be able to inflict an injury at the very least. The reason I was able to take down an Iron Golem in one shot was because of those two abilities.\u0027\\n\\n The power to overcome the handicap of levels; various skills were united as one, and evolved. In the end, these few skills had gotten to a level that could be called \u0027authorities\u0027. Lee Shin Woo could safely say that he was ahead of all the other heroes in this regard. He suddenly realized what a huge blessing it was that he acquired Bursting Thunder from defeating the Zombie Hero.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo wanted to assess his strength as objectively as possible, and around the time he mulled over it, Kratia, who had been looking straight at him, seemed to be deliberating something and then said this, as if it were nothing.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, you should be able to reach level 7.\"\\n\\n \"Stop complimenting me. Stop. It\u0027s frightening just thinking about it.\"\\n\\n No matter how hard he struggled, would he be able to scratch Guillotine Steelworker? If he rode atop Jin\u0027s back and charged at full speed with the Drake Horn Lance, he might be able to land a telling blow, but there\u0027s no guarantee that Guillotine Steelworker would just sit there and take it; plus, it would be his turn to attack after.\\n\\n \"No, you can do it because you realized what\u0027s important early on and kept refining yourself. I\u0027ve never seen anyone who could harmonize their body and mana together so perfectly... Perhaps it might\u0027ve been easier because your body\u0027s only made of bones.\"\\n\\n \"You want to go?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just happy that there\u0027s more for me to study since you leveled up.\"\\n\\n There was absolutely no lies in what she said. She was genuinely happy that Lee Shin Woo had leveled up. It looked as though she just wanted to stay here and study his magic. Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully, stopping her.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something I need to do before that, so just stay put while looking at this.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm? Oh.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had thrown her the Limited order Bone Core. Many of its function had been released and changed due to Lee Shin Woo, and there was a lock set up that allowed those he\u0027d approved of to control the golems. Realizing this, Kratia\u0027s eyes opened wide.\\n\\n \"...Are you a genius?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll probably get something out of studying that. Then, I\u0027ll get going.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you going anyway?\"\\n\\n Kratia wasn\u0027t the only one curious; Jin also looked curious and asked. Lee Shin Woo briefly explained God\u0027s garden to them. Kratia was disgusted, and Jin sported an odd expression.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you want to meet her too?\"\\n\\n \"I do, and I don\u0027t. ...It feels like I was too greedy, and nowadays it makes me think.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. That\u0027s because he had familiarized himself with karma. As he adapted and developed in this world, he became acutely aware of how childish he had been. Lee Shin Woo could definitely agree with that sentiment.\\n\\n But since he still wanted to give her an earful for not telling him about what was going to happen to him, he didn\u0027t really reply.\\n\\n [Would you like to swap out 10 permits to God\u0027s secret shop for 1 permit to God\u0027s garden?]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo knew he had 11 permits right now. In other words, even if he didn\u0027t acquire what he wanted from God\u0027s garden, he could go to the secret shop later if he wanted.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo unhesitatingly nodded his head. Soon, a blinding light burst in the air, and a smallish light descended upon his head.\\n\\n [You have acquired a permit to God\u0027s garden. Would you like to enter now? You may bring the contracted Jin Taylor with you.]\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t think the \u0027one plus one\u0027 rule would be applied here as well. In any case, Lee Shin Woo thought it wouldn\u0027t be bad to take him along, so he looked back at Jin; Jin seemingly understood what Lee Shin Woo was implying and nodded his head with a bitter expression. Kratia was examining the Limited Order Bone Core with great interest, and just lightly waved her hand at them.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re entering together.\"\\n\\n [You have used a permit to God\u0027s garden and are entering God\u0027s garden.]\\n\\n Like when he entered God\u0027s secret shop, the surrounding landscape softly melted away. Lee Shin Woo knew it was a senior level teleportation spell, a level he couldn\u0027t yet reach. It was a spell that transported one\u0027s consciousness into this space, which was neither the underground nor surface.\\n\\n \"Ugh...\"\\n\\n First, his surroundings turned to white. Next, flowers he didn\u0027t even know the names of bloomed on the ground and emitted a refreshing scent. There was a gust of wind, as well as sunlight.\\n\\n A silver table formed and chairs rose up. Finally, a beauty with red hair appeared on the opposite side. She resembled Pleine, but she was also extremely different; before him was a woman who possessed countless appearances. The woman saw Lee Shin Woo and spoke leisurely, as if she had been waiting for him.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you sit down?\"\\n\\n \"...Alright.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo replied meekly and sat down in the chair. He had just noticed, but he had returned to his human form. He thought this might happen, as this was a mental world; whatever appearance he himself perceived would manifest in this world.\\n\\n He was touched that he was in his original human form again, but he wasn\u0027t too shaken. Since he was well aware that this appearance just existed in his consciousness. Therefore, he instead asked his first question.\\n\\n \"Where did Jin go?\"\\n\\n \"Did you really think I wouldn\u0027t be able to talk to you both at the same time?\"\\n\\n He thought that they would both meet God at the same time like when they went to the secret shop, but it seems like they each received a one-on-one talk. He was worried that Jin had already been caught up in God\u0027s pace. However, it seemed as though God had seen right through him and laughed softly.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t call you to punish you, so don\u0027t worry. Your delicate and innocent partner should easily get a new blessing. You see, there\u0027s a suitable skill that\u0027ll strengthen him.\"\\n\\n \"...It sounds like that\u0027s not the same for me.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. You\u0027re neither delicate nor innocent, are you?\"\\n\\n God tilted her head above the table, resting her chin in her hand; she was clearly looking straight at him. Her eyes looked truly amused.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing more I can do for you. I assure you, your talent in handling mana is greater than any hero before you. If I knew you had such talent, then I wouldn\u0027t have gone through the trouble of turning you into a mere skeleton.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n The moment he heard that, it would be a lie to say he wasn\u0027t pissed. Before she sent him to the Underground Empire, she was the one who had to ascertain his talent and take measures! However, it seems as though she\u0027d noticed the dissatisfaction in his eyes and waved her hand.\\n\\n \"Even I don\u0027t have a way to measure how talented someone is who hasn\u0027t yet manifested mana. The only thing I could do was to listen to your wish and try to answer it as best I can.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it is true that my request was excessive. At the time, I was so scared of the Empire that I was just trying to figure out a way to stay safe no matter what. ...But you should\u0027ve told me. You should\u0027ve explained karma in more detail.\"\\n\\n \"I definitely said that you\u0027d have to pay the price back then.\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n Hearing that, Lee Shin Woo briefly gazed at God. Her attitude pissed him off, but he couldn\u0027t shake off the thought that she had deliberately responded so absentmindedly to rile him up. It felt as though she tried pissing him off so that he wouldn\u0027t think deeply about the subject.\\n\\n Therefore, he thought of something else. Perhaps it wasn\u0027t just due to her ill nature that she turned him into a skeleton, but another, important reason... However, God stubbornly didn\u0027t give him the chance to ask.\\n\\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, but we can\u0027t talk for very long. There\u0027s nothing I can do for you in terms of skills or karma, so I\u0027ll give you an item in exchange. If you have any other questions, ask me next time.\"\\n\\n \"...Then I\u0027ll ask a quick question. Is it fine to leave Ethan Cruz as is?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had asked under the assumption that his senior hero, Ethan Cruz, was an s.o.b., causing God to momentarily pause; however, it wasn\u0027t something that she could just easily pass over.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really hard for me to control those who I\u0027ve bestowed my power to. I can\u0027t take back what I\u0027ve given, and I cannot personally exercise my power...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough with the pretense. What do you really think?\"\\n\\n \"Honestly, I don\u0027t really care what happens so long as the Empire is purified. Ethan Cruz is, at the very least, a truly devoted hero in that aspect.\"\\n\\n That was bullshit; so much so that it was unbelievable that God had said it herself. God must\u0027ve realized that what she was said was too harsh, as she quickly added.\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t worry. He can\u0027t do anything to you. Ah, your partner too.\"\\n\\n \"If there was one thing similar between us, it\u0027s that our curse resistance is maxed out... It seems like that asshole\u0027s authority is connected to the curse. Well, the Empire is filled to the brim with the curse, so if you want to get stronger, someone who can handle the curse would have an advantage. ...Wait a sec, did you plan for that from the start by giving us these authorities?\"\\n\\n \"I wonder. I just gave you what you wished for.\"\\n\\n God played innocent until the very end, but one part of her face was stiff. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t help but acknowledge that he\u0027d been robbed[1] by this short talk. God\u0027s eyebrows quivered.\\n\\n \"...Did you gain a lot in the Empire?\"\\n\\n \"There was a lot I could recover from countless peoples\u0027 memories. It\u0027s all because of you.\"\\n\\n \"You desperately wished for immortality above all else, yet it seems like you\u0027re actually ignoring that ability right now and are moving in an effort to get stronger; that\u0027s quite funny.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because I possess immortality that I can move so proactively. ...So I don\u0027t regret it. I\u0027m satisfied with myself right now.\"\\n\\n The moment he finished speaking, Lee Shin Woo was engulfed by blazing black flames. The flames that only burned what its owner wished for it to burn! His skin, hair, muscles, and flesh were all burned, and what remained was a level 5 Elemental Skeleton Joker.\\n\\n He had completely discarded the part that was still attached to his human self, and he had fully accepted himself as is.\\n\\n \"...Ha.\"\\n\\n God couldn\u0027t believe what she was seeing and just laughed. And to God, Lee Shin Woo firmly said.\\n\\n \"Now I\u0027ll tell you what I want.\"\\n\\n \"A level 6 item is enough, right?\"\\n\\n \"Please give me a quest.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm...?\"\\n\\n Neither a skill nor an item, but a quest? God tilted her head, wondering what he was plotting, and then she heard something unbelievable.\\n\\n \"I would like to give the heroes who have died and become undead peace. Please give me their location, as well as a quest to eliminate them.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Talking about how he didn\u0027t get a lot of answers despite paying such a high price.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-65","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
