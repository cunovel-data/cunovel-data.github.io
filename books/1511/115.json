Hansen Von Dorthe - 9 [End of Volume 5]\u003e Aside from the seven Chimeras that had died in battle, Lee Shin Woo named the remaining thirty-one Chimeras Chi Paul to Chi Paul 31. Because they were already elites, they didn\u0027t evolve again, but surprisingly, their stats increased slightly followed by a change in their information. Lee Shin Woo was suddenly shocked at how much power a name held in this world. Even so, he hadn\u0027t planned on putting much effort into their names. So long as he could tell them apart, any name was fine. \"Chi Paul 31, you\u0027re the last one.\" [I see... seven of us died.] \"It\u0027s more impressive that only seven of you died against that ridiculous guy.\" He reinforced the weakest seven Chi Pauls with the bones of the fallen Chimeras, and used a portion of the bones he\u0027d accumulated to heal their wounds. After healing them, the Chi Pauls looked at him as if he were a mother bird, and began to respect Lee Shin Woo. [As expected, you are indeed qualified to say that you will kill the Emperor.] [His power has changed since defeating the Lightning Shadow General. It\u0027s almost like he lives in a different world from us.] One of the Chimeras pointed out sharply, but Lee Shin Woo ignored them. And he returned to the task he\u0027d put off, as he had to take care of the Chimeras. Absorbing the Lightning Shadow General\u0027s wrist bone! \"The Lightning Shadow General, a higher ranked bone than even the Treasure Eater...\" He\u0027d absorbed a Giant\u0027s level 7 bone from the shop before, and while the giant was quite powerful, he was no match for either the Treasure Eater or the Lightning Shadow General. The reason his stats had increased so much was because he was just that weak at the time. Though he\u0027d gotten quite a lot stronger since then, the Lightning Shadow General\u0027s bone may surprise him and increase his stats significantly...! \"Ah, there may be a bit of a backblast, so keep an eye on me.\" \"You can count on me.\" \"So all I need to do is watch this woman so that she doesn\u0027t do anything strange to you, right?\" \"Jin, you really are a rude gi... person.\" Lee Shin Woo remained quiet, and felt a bit left out as he watched a horse and a person converse. As he was a skeleton, he wasn\u0027t thinking about getting a beautiful girl to like him, or to pursue a serious relationship, as there wasn\u0027t any reason to do so. But he didn\u0027t think he\u0027d be beat out by Jin too, who was a skeleton horse! \"It seems like Shin Woo\u0027s thinking about something strange again.\" \"...My condolences.\" \"Alright... Bone Reinforcement!\" [Executing Bone Reinforcement by consuming the Lv7 Lightning Shadow General, Hansen Von Dorthe\u0027s wrist bone.] He ignored their chat and boldly executed Bone Reinforcement. The Lightning Shadow General\u0027s wrist bone in his hand began to spark and disassemble, and was then absorbed into his body. At that moment, his mana momentarily transformed into pure lightning! [Your interior energy has been activated to its very limit! The Intermediate Lightning Element has become Lv10, and has evolved into the high rank level! You can utilize lightning more naturally than before, and your resistance to it has been strengthened as well. Magic has increased by 30.] His intermediate level 8 lightning element had leveled up twice in one go and had evolved into a high rank skill! Lee Shin Woo knew how wide the gap between an intermediate level skill and a high rank skill was, and cheered at the improved quality of his lightning. But surprisingly, this was just a by-product. Now Bone Reinforcement\u0027s usefulness would really come to play! [You have acquired a skill with great success, as your affinity with the target is incredibly high! Strength has increased by 30 and Magic by 45. Absorbing Hansen Von Dorthe\u0027s experiences and memories more deeply.] Lee Shin Woo barely thought it might be him experiencing Hansen\u0027s memories, and then lost his consciousness then and there. When he opened his eyes, he was... surprisingly in a world overflowing with life. There were flowers and grass growing in the lawn with flies flying in between... there were tables here and there, as well as delicious looking food and drinks. Lee Shin Woo was familiar with this kind of thing. This was a party. \"Hansen, are you nodding off again?\" \"Mm. No, I wasn\u0027t nodding off at all.\" \"What a smooth talker.\" He heard Hansen\u0027s young voice, who he\u0027d fought just a short while ago, as well as a slightly older voice who was rebuking him. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s consciousness was inside as... Hansen raised his head. A spirited middle age man was there, and for some reason, he felt close. \"I\u0027m not lying, Sir Seagald. More importantly, what about the guard in the west?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re Seagald!?\u0027 Of course he felt close! He\u0027d heard so many stories about Seagald! However... Lee Shin Woo felt somewhat strange. Seagald was the head of Anti-Skull, and was well aware that he was hostile towards the Emperor and his subordinates. Yet, Seagald was approaching Hansen, one of the 12 generals, with such intimacy, so he realized that this must be a time far in the past. \"It seems like her majesty, the Princess, didn\u0027t like the party. She went back to the palace immediately. So, henceforth, I will be guarding his majesty, the Prince instead.\" \"It\u0027d be nice if I could just return to the palace as well...\" \"Don\u0027t nod off until his majesty orders your return.\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" Hansen replied briefly by nodding his head, but then raised his head and asked. \"Now that I think about it, the party isn\u0027t that big this time. Did the 1st Princess come to the party today?\u0027 \"Don\u0027t overstep.\" \"Yes, sir. But still, I think I\u0027d be a suitable husband... Hui.\" Hansen barely avoided the formless energy that came from Seagald. And like Lee Shin Woo always did when he experienced someone\u0027s memories through Bone Reinforcement, he engraved their fight into his memory. He thought they might be weaker, as this was so far in the past, but after watching their recent quarrel, it seemed like both Seagald and Hansen were in their prime. \"If I hadn\u0027t avoided this, my face would\u0027ve been split apart. Seriously, why are you only like this to me?\" \"You\u0027ve become stronger since you became a general, Hansen. Once you\u0027re done with your escort duty, shall we spar?\" \"That sounds good. This is my chance to see my future brother-in-law\u0027s skill... Uaah.\" This time, flames shot up. Lee Shin Woo had learned that Seagald\u0027s flames were different from the norm! On the other hand, Hansen was moving desperately in order to dodge them. From within Hansen, after Lee Shin Woo had felt Hansen\u0027s mana rotating quickly and instantaneously turn into lightning, he nodded his head. \u0027As I thought... There was a reason I felt a bit of superfluousness in his movements.\u0027 The lightning was indeed powerful, but contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who transformed mana into lightning itself, Hansen would quickly circulate his mana through a special pattern before he transformed it to something that felt like lightning magic, and then used his skill. Though it was powerful, it was still inefficient... Originally, Bursting Thunder was a skill that had that same feel, and aside from Lee Shin Woo, who could utilize the elements freely, most people probably used the elements like this. \"She\u0027s a saint.\" \"Then at least the second princess.\" Even while Lee Shin Woo was organizing his thoughts regarding the elements, Seagald and Hansen continued to talk. It seemed as though Seagald\u0027s younger sister, the Princess, was incredibly pretty, as Hansen held on persistently. \"She\u0027s still a priest.\" \"Our religious order doesn\u0027t forbid marriage!\" \"Hoo...\" Seagald\u0027s tone seemed to say \u0027even after all this, he still doesn\u0027t understand\u0027, and he sighed magnificently. Then, he took a look around, and Hansen followed suit; they noticed people were gathering. In the center, there was a luxuriously dressed middle aged man. \"Is this some kind of entertainment you\u0027ve prepared for us?\" \"No, your majesty. It was just us joking around...\" \"I, the Crown Prince, will allow it. Show our guests just how great the swords of the Empire are.\" \"Ehk...\" \"I understand, your majesty.\" It was an order from the Crown Prince (who he protected); he would have to fight against someone who he couldn\u0027t beat in front of all these people. Hansen was shocked, but on the other end, Seagald had already drawn his sword. What\u0027s worse, Seagald\u0027s eyes were big and bright, meaning that he was going to discipline him, a manner-less brat, for coveting his younger sisters. \"Come at me whenever, Hansen.\" \"Please stop glaring at me so strongly. This is a spar, a spar.\" \"I know. Though occasionally, real sword spars result in casualties.\" \"Are you trying to kill me?!\" However, there was already no way for Hansen to escape. Once the Crown Prince clapped his hands, men wearing impressive uniforms came running out, clearing the area, and creating a space for the match. Hansen sported a expression looking as though he was a condemned criminal in an execution ground, and was forced to draw his sword. It as the sword that had become a part of Lee Shin Woo, the Divine Lightning Sword. \u0027To think I\u0027d be able to experience a fight between generals. I\u0027ve really hit the jackpot, haven\u0027t I!?\u0027 He\u0027d acquired memories regarding a party that had nothing to do with the Empire\u0027s struggles, or even its secrets, so Lee Shin Woo had been grumbling that he would have to stay put and just watch men and women talking the entire time, but he had no idea it would end up like this! \"If you\u0027re not attacking, then I will.\" \"Hoo...\" He did his very best to focus on the current situation. He\u0027d already killed Hansen, and it felt like he would never have to fight Seagald in the future, but it was quite a big deal that he was able to experience the battle between two big shots so clearly! \"If you\u0027re giving me the first move, then I\u0027ll gladly take it!\" Hansen said while turning his magic into lightning; He then charged at Seagald with a blinding speed. It was the same Lightning Shadow technique he\u0027d used during their fight! \u0027Ah, this should be easy.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo definitely had talent in the ways of manipulating mana, so the moment he experienced it firsthand, he figured out the core of the technique. The goal of Lightning Shadow was to eliminate the boundary between the body and magic by rapidly circulating one\u0027s magic and expanding it through the interior of one\u0027s body. Right now, Hansen\u0027s body was akin to a thunderbolt! He was ridiculously strong and fast. To the point that he could face a level 8! Of course, not only did it consume an overwhelming amount of magic, but just using the technique would damage one\u0027s body. However, it was an incredible technique that took that into consideration and would momentarily increase one\u0027s power exponentially. \u0027You could probably use the skill the same way with another element, but... it seems like the lightning element is most effective. Next would probably be wind.\u0027 As expected, the lightning element was powerful. Lee Shin Woo could understand how Hansen had become the Emperor\u0027s hitman, despite being level 7 amongst the generals. And at the same time, there was something he realized... \u0027If I become familiar with it here, then my Lightning Sprint might get stronger as well.\u0027 Lightning Sprint was a charge skill that was based on high rank spirit arts. One\u0027s body would be engulfed in lightning and the skill would give its user overwhelming acceleration and destructive force. If Lightning Shadow was like changing the inner gloves, then Lightning Sprint was like changing the outer gloves! But at their core, the techniques were similar, so it didn\u0027t feel like it would be very difficult to learn both at the same time. And if he were to succeed as well, he would be able to use two skills with ridiculous synergy. After he\u0027d created the Shadow Horn skill, he must\u0027ve gotten a taste for fusing skills together, as Lee Shin Woo wanted to study the skills immediately. However. \"Heup!\" Using his skill, Hansen charged forward quickly, and Seagald charged as well, blocking Hansen mid-way. He easily deflected Hansen\u0027s blade and simultaneously kicked his stomach. Hansen spun his body and tried to respond with a kick of his own, but by then, the back of Seagald\u0027s blade forcefully struck Hansen\u0027s head. Dozens of moves had occurred within the blink of an eye, and ultimately, before the duration of Lightning Shadow ended... Hansen was on his knees. \"Kuheok. I lost.\" \"Mm.\" Even though Lee Shin Woo had been experiencing the battle in Hansen\u0027s body, he still had no idea what had happened and how he had lost so badly. He would need to think back to this battle several times in the future. \"That\u0027s the secret technique you invented, right? Mm, it\u0027s certainly powerful and quick. However, your mind couldn\u0027t keep up with your body. That\u0027s why you can\u0027t beat me.\" \"Kuheuk, you\u0027re right...\" The party members applauded. Of course, the party members didn\u0027t really know what had happened, but they at least seemed to realize that Seagald had won overwhelmingly. Plus, Hansen had gone all out from the very beginning, yet Seagald hadn\u0027t even drawn his fire sword! \u0027As I thought, Seagald\u0027s a swordsman who specializes in fire.\u0027 While Lee Shin Woo nodded at the flowing memories, Seagald slightly laughed and extended his hand towards Hansen. \"I can\u0027t give you my little sister, but you have gotten stronger.\" \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not my enemy, Sir Seagald... Hoo.\" Hansen grabbed Seagald\u0027s hand, stood up, and spoke. Seagald thought he was exaggerating and grinned. \"So long as I serve his Imperial Majesty, that will never happen. I promise you in the name of the house Retadane.\" \"I\u0027ll be part of the family soon anyway... Uoooooooh!\" Seagald twisted Hansen\u0027s hand and threw him aside. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s consciousness became faint. The rich and plentiful experience was finally drawing to a close. \u0027No, wait a sec.\u0027 But Lee Shin Woo, who was returning after acquiring combat experience and skill know-how, was shocked at something that Seagald had said. \u0027Retadane... is that what he said?\u0027 At that moment, his consciousness faded. What terrible timing.
