What Remains of the Battle - 1\u003e Ethan Cruz had to prepare two things in order to lure and then kill Lee Shin Woo. First, he needed to make the battle progress a certain way. Make it so that Retadane and the other heroes wouldn\u0027t be able to easily escape the battlefield. This part wasn\u0027t very difficult. Since all he needed to do was wait for the right moment. Second, he had to create the right environment. He would have to go through a lot of trouble to hide what he was doing from the other heroes. Ethan Cruz had formed a sort of visual barrier that would block out any outsiders from seeing them and simultaneously weaken God\u0027s authority within, disabling the chatting channel and the private chat functions. This was all done in advance so that no matter how much he screamed, no one would be able to hear him. With the secret activation of a magical device, as well as his own magic, the space was restricted from outsiders, forming a complete barrier. Unfortunately, that applied to him as well. \"How did you summon so many undead...\" \"I told you, I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about. Why do you keep asking me?\" Lee Shin Woo said calmly, acting innocent, but Ethan Cruz broke into a cold sweat. He\u0027d never been this uneasy before, even when he\u0027d met with one of the 12 generals face-to-face! \"How can you, a human, control so many undead!\" \"Ha. You\u0027re one to talk.\" [Annihilation of airborne troops, complete. Awaiting next order.] [We have annihilated both of the level 7 undead heroes. Paul Zero, we await your next order!] Their presences were so faint, as if they would vanish into thin air, but their bodies possessed unimaginable power: the golems. Followed by many level 7 elites rapidly appearing behind them. There were several different types of undead (e.g. the Giants and a wolf), but they were all ridiculously strong. Furthermore, they had pledged their loyalty to Lee Shin Woo alone. Seeing that, Ethan Cruz gritted his teeth. \"If the other heroes knew about this...\" \"They wouldn\u0027t. You were the one who made it like that.\" Lee Shin Woo ridiculed him coldly. That\u0027s right. Because Ethan Cruz had activated the magical device, this entire area was shrouded in a barrier. Ethan Cruz finally considered a possibility that he hadn\u0027t even considered before. \"Did you want this to happen...? You knew that I had prepared a barrier and deliberately let me activate it!\" \"I\u0027m the type of guy who prepares a lot of ways to kill someone.\" Of course, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t want it to go this way, but it was just wishful thinking. If he was the type of person to risk it all on a single chance, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t have been able to survive in the Empire. \"With these troops... you could\u0027ve attacked me without going through the hassle of coming up with a plan.\" \"You\u0027re misunderstanding something here.\" Lee Shin Woo glanced at the airborne troops and shrugged his shoulders. Through the Giants\u0027 and golems\u0027 stone-throwing, the airborne troops had crashed onto the ground. Yasunori Akira tried attacking him, but Bisher Moon and Shino Rendu simultaneously blocked him. Both of them were stronger than Yasunori Akira, and he wasn\u0027t able to fight against them for long. Lee Shin Woo could foresee his death the moment Yasunori Akira decided to attack him and step away from Ethan Cruz\u0027s protection. \"The reason I stepped foot onto this stage wasn\u0027t to kill you. It was to protect my other seniors. Ah, and to get the rewards for killing the 12 generals. I was able to kill two of them because of you. Thanks a lot.\" \"...Ha, hahaha.\" Who had been manipulating whom, hmm? Ethan Cruz was completely confused. He\u0027d lost. Completely. Not only had he lost the eight undead heroes, but his spies were either exposed or killed, so his body was all he had left. He had lost everything in just a day. \"You hid those sharp fangs of yours... quite well thus far.\" \"Would you believe me if I said that wasn\u0027t all I was hiding?\" \"Keuk, kuhaha!\" Ethan Cruz couldn\u0027t help but laugh at Lee Shin Woo\u0027s teasing. Perhaps he wasn\u0027t joking around. Lee Shin Woo was monstrous enough for him to think that way, and he smiled bitterly and muttered. However, there was one thing he had left. One weapon he could still use. It was himself. \"You completely defeated me. I acknowledge my loss. I didn\u0027t know how strong you were, nor did I know about your hidden forces, so it\u0027s only natural that I was beaten so badly. ...But if I get you, then my loss today means absolutely nothing.\" \"You\u0027re probably right.\" \"Yeah. Let me tell you what your biggest mistake was. That you don\u0027t know what it means to be level 8!\" Ethan Cruz infused mana into his wrist bracelet. Then, jet-black mana rose up like a mist and surrounded him. The high concentration of darkness steadily dyed the once pure and bright land. This was a level 8\u0027s authority. [Keuk...] [Ethan Cruz, how can he have such immense power...!?] The undead watched on and instinctively shook, as darkness mana was the root of their existence. Although they knew that Ethan Cruz was a danger to their master, they couldn\u0027t easily advance. His level and power were far too great! Even the level 7 elites stiffened before this darkness, which threatened to cover everything, including their very existence. \"None of your undead can use their full strength in here. High Rank Darkness... You probably have no idea what I went through to be able to use this.\" Lee Shin Woo could use it too, but decided not to say anything. He couldn\u0027t tell him that he could use High Rank Darkness as soon as God had awakened his latent potential. \"A level 8 possesses power that surpasses the limitations of mankind. You must\u0027ve prepared a lot, but in the end, if you can\u0027t overcome me with your own power, then you won\u0027t be able to kill me. That goes for your subordinates as well. ...Die.\" A lump of darkness flew towards him. \u0027As expected\u0027, Lee Shin Woo thought, and nodded his head. It was incredibly powerful, even when compared to a fellow level 8, like Retadane. Even when he took into account that one was a frontline fighter and the other a backline magician, the difference was huge. ‘Perhaps that bracelet strengthened darkness magic,’ Lee Shin Woo thought and extended his staff. [Absorbing level 4 high rank darkness magic. Because of how powerful the magic is, strengthening and reversal will take some time.] The serpent opened its eyes. \"What!?\" Ethan Cruz\u0027s darkness magic was powerful enough to instantly kill a level 7 hero. This high rank magic, which was intended to kill Lee Shin Woo, had been absorbed into Lee Shin Woo\u0027s staff. Because of how powerful Ethan Cruz\u0027s magic was, the staff was creaking. However, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s Darkness Resistance: MAX activated, allowing his staff to absorb all the darkness magic. While the staff was able to absorb magic and reverse it, it wasn\u0027t invincible; it couldn\u0027t absorb any and all magic without any repercussions. The Bone Winged Serpent required the user to possess high resistances. \"H-How...?\" \"Who told you that I could only nullify curses?\" \"...!\" Lee Shin Woo \"innocently\" asked. Ethan Cruz couldn\u0027t even muster up a retort. Since no one had ever said something like that to him before. However, that was what was happening right now! Although he\u0027d figured out that Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t afraid of the curse and was planning on using that curse to attack him, he\u0027d come to the natural conclusion that he specialized in curses alone... \"Could it be...\" Ethan Cruz\u0027s lips shook at that train of thought. He wanted to cancel his spell immediately, but to cancel his spell, he would have to endure the resulting magic explosion with his own body. If he were to cancel his spell, one which he\u0027d focused all of his magic into, then he\u0027d blow up without being able to kill Lee Shin Woo. \"Were you... manipulating me?\" \"Good answer. I\u0027ll give you a passing mark.\" Lee Shin Woo had been wary of Ethan Cruz from the very beginning. His darkness magic hadn\u0027t been a cause for alarm; he was actually worried about him using his immense magic in a different way. He knew that he was strong enough to hurt him, even if he didn\u0027t convert his magic into darkness. \"Ha, haha...\" Therefore, he\u0027d manipulated Ethan Cruz. So that he wouldn\u0027t hesitate and use his darkness magic, pouring all of his magic into it. That\u0027s why he\u0027d discussed countermeasures for \u0027curses\u0027, rather than for \u0027darkness\u0027 with Yasunori Akira. He\u0027d made him think that Lee Shin Woo was entirely focused on curses. He\u0027d also made it look like he was afraid of darkness magic. The reason he\u0027d brought his undead here was for him to use his darkness magic without hesitation as well. Ethan Cruz was afraid. He wasn\u0027t afraid of Lee Shin Woo’s magic, strength, or forces. He was afraid of his intelligence. \"Lee Shin Woo, how far ahead did you plan...?\" \"I wonder. Probably around one or two steps worth?\" He had cast his spell, and that spell had been absorbed by the serpent. The serpent\u0027s wings began to flutter. Ethan Cruz could feel his immense magic being converted into something unimaginable. It was the power he\u0027d been most wary of. Ethan Cruz knew that the moment that power was turned onto him, he\u0027d be dead. \"Are you... really human?\" \"Of course I am, Senior.\" Lee Shin Woo smiled sweetly and replied. He lied till the very end. After all, he was a Joker. Unfortunately, Ethan Cruz didn\u0027t realize that he was lying. Ethan Cruz was devoured by the light shot and soon, was unable to think of anything. \"Spatial magic!?\" [Paul Zero!] But the moment he suspected that he\u0027d killed Ethan Cruz, spatial magic activated with him as its target. Lee Shin Woo realized that it was the Archmage\u0027s doing. He obviously couldn\u0027t just sit by and let him activate the spell! Lee Shin Woo immediately expelled all of his magic in all directions. If he had fought against Ethan Cruz, then he wouldn\u0027t have this much strength left, but because he\u0027d used his own strength against him, he was almost at 100%! \"Nice. I blocked it!\" \"You blocked it!?\" That\u0027s right. Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in stopping the activation of the Archmage\u0027s spatial magic! He had dispersed the Archmage\u0027s mana with his own, and had nullified the source of the spell. Lee Shin Woo had done what would be difficult for any other hero to do so nonchalantly. If he hadn\u0027t experienced the Archmage\u0027s mana firsthand, or had gone to the Giants\u0027 domain, then he wouldn\u0027t have been able to do it! \"To think you would be able to nullify spatial magic... I\u0027m speechless.\" \"Ah. I desperately stopped it because I thought the Archmage was coming, but I guess it was the opposite. I think he was trying to bring Ethan Cruz to him.\" [Kak, Guha...] Lee Shin Woo looked at Ethan Cruz, who was turning into an undead, and muttered as if he\u0027d realized something. As he thought, Ethan Cruz had been connected with the Archmage. In exchange, he probably had to pledge his allegiance to the Archmage after death, or something like that. There was likely some kind of spatial magic that was applied to him, which would activate once he died. Or maybe he had some kind of magical device. There was a high chance that this barrier was the result of a magical device that the Archmage had given him. [Do we kill him?] \"Ah, it\u0027ll be a pain in the ass when he wakes up, so make sure he can\u0027t move, and then kill him as soon as he becomes an undead.\" [Understood!] The Paul Zero Corps looked at their master, who had killed the level 8 hero responsible for the darkness magic, and replied enthusiastically. Thirty seconds later, Ethan Cruz died for the second time.
