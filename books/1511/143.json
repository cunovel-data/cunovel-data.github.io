Hero Hunter - 1\u003e\n [Ye Jin Jin: Are you really just friends?]\n \"Yeah, we just get along really well.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: Someone you get along really well with...]\n \"We\u0027re just friends. I\u0027m a skeleton, so there\u0027s no way a normal woman would like me. We\u0027re not in a relationship, ok?\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: Uuh...]\n Ye Jin Jin interrogated Lee Shin Woo through a private chat, and even after he\u0027d explained to her a few times that he didn\u0027t have any feelings for Kratia, Ye Jin Jin grumbled in distaste.\n [Ye Jin Jin: I\u0027ll be able to form a party with you once I\u0027m level 7 as well, Mr. Shin Woo.]\n \"No, I\u0027m not going to form a party with you. I\u0027m not even in one with Kratia right now.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: That\u0027s good news... No, in any case, when your levels are similar, then you can relate to them. But I\u0027m still level 5... So I probably won\u0027t be able to participate in taking down one of the 12 generals. I\u0027m ashamed of myself.]\n \"Just keep at it with your own pace. You may die if you rush.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: Mr. Shin Woo, will you treat me nicely if I die and turn into a zombie or skeleton?]\n \"Nope. I\u0027m sick of being a skeleton myself, so make sure you don\u0027t die.\"\n [Ye Jin Jin: ...Huu, ok.]\n She seemed better now, as she energetically declared that she wouldn\u0027t die and that she would level up quickly. Then, she ended the chat. Once their conversation was over, Lee Shin Woo muttered with an even more deathly expression, even though he was already dead.\n \"Why are there so many heroes like this?\"\n \"Love makes people act like they\u0027re young again. Even though they know it\u0027s unreasonable, they badger you, and even though they know it\u0027s foolish, they do it anyway... In the end, they make a mistake, cry their heart out, and regret it.\"\n Although Lee Shin Woo had just muttered out without thinking, Jin had responded with his own deep comment. But there were a few parts that he couldn\u0027t understand mixed in.\n \"She likes a skeleton. Isn\u0027t there something wrong with her?\"\n \"Love messes with your head. You didn\u0027t know?\"\n \"Hoo, as I thought, you\u0027re the only partner for me, someone who doesn\u0027t care about stuff like love... Hey, what\u0027s wrong!? Hey!\"\n \"I want to train Steel Heart.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to attack me to train it!\"\n Jin realized that he couldn\u0027t harass Lee Shin Woo by just shaking his body anymore, so instead, he controlled the armor atop his body and formed thorns to attack Lee Shin Woo with.\n The old him wouldn\u0027t have even imagined that he would grow this much, but if his body was pierced by those thorns, then Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t be happy!\n While Jin ran at top speed, Lee Shin Woo had to dodge the steel thorns that Jin would attack him with randomly. But in the middle of that, Lee Shin Woo realized something and suddenly became calm.\n \"Huh? I think this could be good training... Jin, try doing it a bit faster.\"\n \"You\u0027re the one whose head is messed up!\"\n Right now, they were travelling to a level 3 danger zone that they had never set foot in before. They could\u0027ve gone straight there if they had taken the golem train, but they were going the long way around in order to avoid Ethan Cruz.\n But because Jin\u0027s speed almost matched the speed of the train, the time it would take had only increased from one day to two.\n \"A hero in a level 3 danger zone...\"\n \"Ethan Cruz might be looking for the other undead heroes before his \u0027hunt\u0027. So, we need to make the first move.\"\n Lee Shin Woo had already taken care of the heroes in the level 1 and 2 danger zones in the past. Of course, there had only been three of them, including the one who\u0027d given him the Bursting Thunder skill.\n Anyway, all he had left were the level 3 and 4 danger zones. Lee Shin Woo had been postponing the quest because the undead heroes\u0027 powers were unknown to him, but he decided that he needed the strength of the other heroes in order to fight back against Ethan Cruz.\n \"Fortunately, Ethan Cruz doesn\u0027t have an ability that locates the undead heroes for him. At all.\"\n He had been sure of it. If Ethan Cruz knew where the level 3 danger zone undead heroes were, then he would\u0027ve gotten to them earlier.\n Moreover, Ethan had figured out where Shino Rendu had died and gone over there a few months after his death. Ethan\u0027s information gathering really sucked. In other words, Lee Shin Woo was a cheat, as he knew where all the undead heroes were...\n \"That\u0027s probably why he\u0027s trying to gather us all in one place. Ethan\u0027s trying to gather us in a place he can see and procure us. He\u0027s even using one of the 12 generals as bait...\"\n Ethan wasn\u0027t just aiming for Lee Shin Woo alone. He was also gunning for Lloyd, Prince, Kratia... he acted only after they had reached level 7.\n He was using their complete faith in him to stab them in the back, yet he was facing off against four level 7 heroes. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t even imagine what he was preparing for their fight.\n \"He might expand his forces as well. There\u0027s a high chance that he\u0027s going to move boldly, so I have to make the first move.\"\n \"You\u0027re the boldest. You.\"\n While they were on the move, Lee Shin Woo messaged Kratia and roughly explained what Ethan was planning. He didn\u0027t need to add much, as Kratia had already seen Ethan lead the undead heroes.\n [Kratia Melloi: We have to prepare.]\n \"You just need to protect yourself against his darkness element. I\u0027ll take him down myself.\"\n [Kratia Melloi: Ok. I\u0027ll leave that to you. You can also use the darkness element and even have the absorption ability, so it would be hard to fight him for anyone else. ...I\u0027ll need to think about a way to intercept the undead heroes while protecting myself.]\n \"Alright. Let\u0027s work hard.\"\n [Kratia Melloi: Yeah. See you then.]\n Once he was finished chatting with Kratia, who reassured him with her answer... Lee Shin Woo felt extremely conflicted, but decided to chat with Prince as well. As expected, she spoke passionately, unlike Kratia.\n [Prince Altania: What is it all of a sudden? You\u0027re not mad that I told everyone in the chatting channel your level, are you? That wasn\u0027t in the contract! Me revealing your level is actually helpful to you, as it\u0027ll help you fit in later!]\n Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t even said anything yet, but she was already defending herself. \u0027I\u0027ll file a claim regarding that later,\u0027 he replied simply, making her tremble. Lee Shin Woo then continued sternly.\n \"Senior, you know how dangerous darkness mana is, right?\"\n [Prince Altania: I had no idea you could use that formidable magic...!]\n \"Senior Ethan Cruz can also use darkness mana.\"\n [Prince Altania: I know. His buff magic is no joke. They make you feel like your level has increased by one.]\n As expected, he could concentrate his darkness element into a buff. Of course, if he did so, then he pretty much wouldn\u0027t be able to do anything, but it was still a viable move.\n Moreover, Ethan wasn\u0027t the type of person who buffed people out of the kindness of his heart. There must be something else hidden within that buff.\n \"The true ability of the darkness element isn\u0027t buffing.\"\n [Prince Altania: Obviously. Senior Ethan is better at debuffing. You\u0027ll see for yourself later, but it feels really reassuring to have him by your side. I\u0027m not kidding.]\n He had somewhat expected this, but... Prince had complete faith in Ethan. Like she was under the effect of a charm! Maybe she was affected by the darkness element. However, Lee Shin Woo had his own trick up his sleeve.\n \"I see. By the way, you remember your debt, right?\"\n [Prince Altania: Eek!?]\n Lee Shin Woo gave up on immediately disclosing the truth about Ethan. Prince fully trusted that lunatic, so if he were to tell her the truth, she would immediately private chat with Ethan and make sure he was telling the truth.\n \"It\u0027s nothing special. I was just wondering if you could fight together with us if one of the 12 generals shows up.\"\n Because of that, he chose to take an indirect approach.\n [Prince Altania: What? But I have to protect Lloyd...]\n \"Lloyd has Erian with him. But when I heard we were going to fight against one of the 12 generals, I started shaking. You can use fire magic, so I\u0027d feel a lot better being with you, Senior...\"\n [Prince Altania: H-Hmm. It\u0027s commendable that you\u0027re aware of my abilities, but even so, I need to protect Lloyd...]\n \"Senior, I need you!\"\n [Prince Altania: Keuk... Well, if you really need me that badly, I guess it can\u0027t be helped.]\n He laid it on thick in his request, and in the end, Prince caved. Honestly, he thought it was way too easy.\n [Prince Altania: A debt is a debt. Your big sis\u0027ll be by your side then for a day. That\u0027s fine, right?]\n \"Thank you very much.\"\n [Prince Altania: Hoo, it really is great to be the senior.]\n Good. If it comes down to it, as long as he put this dumbass next to Kratia, then she would survive.\n Lee Shin Woo was concerned about Lloyd and his other seniors, but to be frank, he didn\u0027t really have the power to save them too. If Lee Shin Woo took down Ethan at the right time, then they would survive. If not, they would die.\n \"Then I\u0027ll contact you later.\"\n [Prince Altania: I told you before, but I have someone I like already. You can\u0027t fall in love with me, alright?]\n Lee Shin Woo immediately ended the chat with Prince, as she said something stupid and hadn\u0027t even figured out that he was trying to help her. He was already anticipating spanking her a few times.\n \"Shin Woo, you really like people too.\"\n \"Nope. It would just make me feel bad if people I knew died.\"\n \"No matter what you think, that\u0027s... Shin Woo.\"\n Jin was about to offer a rebuttal, but suddenly called Lee Shin Woo calmly. When Jin, who was faster than Lee Shin Woo, called him like this, there was only one thing it could be!\n Lee Shin Woo gripped the Breath of the Lightning God in one hand and raised his head. He deepened his connection with Jin and focused his senses, so even he could see it. There was an undead standing atop a hill ahead that was watching them...!\n \"It looks like a magician.\"\n \"Seems that way. Shin Woo, it looks like he\u0027s about to attack us with his magic.\"\n \"Then, shall we start with a light tap?\"\n Even if it\u0027s rotten, it\u0027s still a hero. The undead hero, who had sensed Lee Shin Woo\u0027s party from afar, raised its arm and formed a giant flame in the air. It looked like Prince\u0027s fire magic; while it was weaker, it had formed instantaneously, which made him recollect a monster from somewhere.\n \"It\u0027s an ability from God. But we\u0027re no pushovers!\"\n Lee Shin Woo forcefully threw his Breath of the Lightning God into the air. The midair Breath of the Lightning God obeyed his command, erupting in a huge explosion, and temporarily the entire area was tinged with lightning!\n And the six Breath of the Lightning Gods that had been floating behind him until now, came forward, as if waiting for that very moment. The six blades sucked in the overflowing lightning energy from the surrounding area and accelerated. Immediately after, he shot the swords straight at the magician!\n \u0027I figured this out from fighting in the training facility. That it\u0027s better to explode one weapon and change the surrounding environment than to explode them all at once, as my weapons will become so much stronger that way!\u0027\n That\u0027s right. Lee Shin Woo had mastered the idiotic and effective ability he\u0027d learned from his battles in the training facility: to blow up his elemental weapon and change the environment!\n [Kuhahk...!]\n As expected, the six Breath of the Lightning Gods were much faster than before, and shot out towards the magician with that increased speed.\n The first sword frontally clashed with the magician\u0027s flame and exploded, dyeing the entire area in lightning. The second sword shot out and was even stronger than before. The magician didn\u0027t even have the time to react as his head was completely destroyed!\n [You have acquired 2 secret shop permits, and 17,554,190 Perium.]\n [You have given peace to a comrade who walked a path he could not return from. You have partially cleared the quest objectives and have acquired 1 secret shop permit. The maximum level of the Invisible Heart skill has increased by 1.]\n \"...Ah.\"\n Because the magician had died, the remaining four swords lost their target and just remained in the air. They seemed to look around, which was a reflection of how Lee Shin Woo was feeling.\n \"Shin Woo...?\"\n Jin looked at Lee Shin Woo strangely, as he had thought that Lee Shin Woo would try bringing the magician to their side before killing it, but Lee Shin Woo did his best to act like nothing was wrong and replied.\n \"I killed him because I thought we\u0027d have to toughen you up a bit first!\"\n Honestly, he hadn\u0027t expected the magician to die from one attack!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-143","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
