They were definitely sisters. The two of them looked incredibly alike and were beautiful enough to be considered the most beautiful in the Empire. So the mood between them was quite unfortunate.\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n \"...\"\\n\\n \"G-Guten Morgen...?\"\\n\\n The mood wasn\u0027t all that great within the secret shop. In the midst of the two sister\u0027s staring contest, Lee Shin Woo spoke carefully. Since Pleine wasn\u0027t giving him her classic greeting, he had to do it.\\n\\n \"...Hello, Mr. Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n Pleine twisted her head around and bowed towards Lee Shin Woo. Seira\u0027s eyebrows twitched at \u0027Mr. Shin Woo\u0027, but Lee Shin Woo ignored her and replied.\\n\\n \"If you have some things to say to each other, then I can leave.\"\\n\\n \"...No, I\u0027m fine. I don\u0027t really have anything to say to her. Moreover, we can\u0027t really be called sisters anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed. Now, Mr. Shin Woo, what did you come here for today?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo looked at the two testy women and thought, \u0027they sure like playing around\u0027. Who was it that begged him to save her sister again? And who was it that asked him to bring her to the secret shop again?\\n\\n They definitely had a lot to say to each other, yet they were holding back for some reason. Lee Shin Woo had no way of figuring out why, but... if they persisted, then he\u0027d just go about with his business.\\n\\n \"I had some questions and wanted to tell you some things too. First... I killed Seagald. Sorry, I don\u0027t have any keepsakes to give you since they were all burned.\"\\n\\n \"I see. I already knew since I heard from Her, but thank you for telling me in person. ...In the end, you had to deal with all of our family\u0027s problems. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"...What\u0027s with you all of a sudden? Isn\u0027t that your specialty?\"\\n\\n \"...!\"\\n\\n Ah, crap. Seira finally began talking. She just pressed something. Something more fearsome than the button for a nuclear bomb!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo briefly paused but soon decided to calm them down. Unfortunately, Seira was faster.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the way you deal with things. You run away, as if you\u0027re avoiding reality, and leave all the work to other people.\"\\n\\n \"Hoh, that\u0027s rich coming from a half-wit like you. You didn\u0027t realize how weak you were, yet you tried to get revenge anyway. And then you lost all your comrades. In the end, you didn\u0027t do anything right.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to hear that from you. You\u0027re not willing to get your hands dirty, yet you\u0027re willing to stand on the sidelines, selling weapons in exchange for such precious karma.\"\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure if she\u0027s never gotten her hands dirty before, but at this rate, she probably will\u0027, Lee Shin Woo thought and urgently tried to interfere, but...\\n\\n \"Hey, shouldn\u0027t we stop this? You\u0027ll just say things that\u0027ll hurt each other...\"\\n\\n \"Seira, do you have any idea how I felt becoming God\u0027s apostle? I did it so you wouldn\u0027t have to do it! If our roles were reversed, then I would\u0027ve killed older brother in one hit. One hit! I would\u0027ve killed the Emperor and the likes of Seldin, and brought peace to the Empire a long time ago!\"\\n\\n \"Talk is cheap! There were rumors that you talked your way into your Saintess position. They were probably right!\"\\n\\n \"Eeeek!\"\\n\\n Ah, crap. It\u0027s all over. The two had forgotten all about Lee Shin Woo and were duking it out! The counter between them was shaking immensely!\\n\\n \"I was managing the communication between the heroes and God, as well as helping the heroes grow, while you went wild, unaware of the undead curse\u0027s effects on you. To you, who became an undead, my job must not seem very important. I\u0027m asking just in case, but this isn\u0027t a specialty store that sells tea leaves. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so glad that you, who doesn\u0027t even know what a real battle is, didn\u0027t become an undead. Shall I tell you what our older brother\u0027s last moments were like?\"\\n\\n \"Did you even land a hit on him? I believe you didn\u0027t even cry once during the battle, even after Mr. Shin Woo turned you into a level 8 Elder Banshee.\"\\n\\n \"I did! Mentally! I just thought my intervention wasn\u0027t necessary. You wouldn\u0027t know how important reserve forces are since all you\u0027re good at is yapping and picking tea leaves! Lee Shin Woo even thanked me for making things go so smoothly...\"\\n\\n \"Mentally? Pfft!\"\\n\\n \"Pfft? Pfft!? You want to spit out blood instead?\"\\n\\n Why is it that when these two sisters met, they showed a side that he\u0027d never seen before? And why hadn\u0027t he noticed that black personality of theirs before...?\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo watched their intensifying sibling spat, took out some popcorn he\u0027d prepared in advance for moments like this, and sat down in a corner.\\n\\n He\u0027d made it since Prince wanted to eat it so badly, yet he was the first one to take a bite. Ah, this was the first time he\u0027d made it, but it was delicious. Lee Shin Woo wanted to drink some cola with it. Then... they started to drag him into it as well.\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s with \u0027Mr. Shin Woo\u0027? \u0027Mr. Shin Woo\u0027? What, are you trying to seduce a hero now too? You\u0027re so old, so how can you be so indecent? You\u0027re trying to be so charming to a man who was once a level 1 skeleton? Or what, is it that you\u0027re so old now that you\u0027ll become a skeleton yourself soon?\"\\n\\n \"Look who\u0027s talking! It doesn\u0027t really matter, does it? You\u0027ve become undead now, so you transcend things like age! Moreover, what\u0027s wrong with how I call him? You, who even at that age didn\u0027t know how to talk to a man without hitting them with your hammer, must think that a man and woman speaking amicably means that they\u0027re in a relationship. Sorry to say, but it\u0027s not true!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because once I became older, all that was left were undead and monsters! Or what, did you want me to date someone like Ethan Cruz!? And in the first place, you\u0027re the one who told me I didn\u0027t have a chance with the other male heroes whenever I came here!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because you\u0027re clueless when it comes to relationships! You would\u0027ve been ruined if you dated trash like Ethan Cruz! If you\u0027d even bothered to learn love through books, then you would\u0027ve known that my and Mr. Shin Woo\u0027s relationship isn\u0027t like that... Huh? Wait, do you...\"\\n\\n Why did Ethan Cruz have to be cursed out for something he didn\u0027t even do? While Lee Shin Woo shook his head, Pleine alternated between him and Seira, as if she\u0027d figured something out. Seira noticed this and spoke in disgust.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing between us. It looks like you\u0027re the one with your head in the clouds! It must be because you\u0027ve only learned about romance from books. I know that, as a Saintess, men would just respect you; they didn\u0027t ever approach you!\"\\n\\n \"They did! They just weren\u0027t good enough for me! Moreover, all the heroes tried flirting with me too! Didn\u0027t know that did you? All of them! Everyone aside from Mr. Skeleton over there!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a skeleton anymore, you know.\"\\n\\n \u0027If you want to fight, then keep it to yourselves.\u0027. He\u0027d rather they not drag him into this, but it seemed impossible. Lee Shin Woo sighed and began boiling some water. He\u0027d gotten quite thirsty from eating popcorn, so he decided to brew some tea that he\u0027d bought on the surface.\\n\\n \"...Are you brewing tea here?\"\\n\\n He thought it\u0027d help the extremely agitated Seira relax. It worked, as expected. He didn\u0027t think it would work, but to think it would be this easy. He smiled slightly and poured the boiling water into the teapot.\\n\\n \"You must be thirsty, so please drink a cup before you go on fighting or what not.\"\\n\\n \"Fighting? We\u0027re not fighting. Besides, I like alcohol more than tea. Something that can wash away all this frustration of mine...\"\\n\\n He knew she\u0027d want alcohol instead of tea. Lee Shin Woo took out something he\u0027d been hiding for this moment. It was a new Kerr Century Label wine bottle.\\n\\n \"Mr. Shin Woo, is that perhaps...?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s our factory\u0027s newest brandy. It\u0027s harder to make, so we\u0027ve only just started making it.\"\\n\\n \"Brandy! Kerr Century Label!\"\\n\\n Brandy was a generic term for any distilled fruit wine, but this brandy distilled Kerr Century\u0027s red wine and fermented them in oak barrels.\\n\\n The price of brandy depended on the grapes and the manufacturing process used and was a luxurious drink. On Earth, Cognac, an area in France, was renowned for their brandy. So, it was only natural that Pleine\u0027s eyes would sparkle once he said \u0027brandy\u0027.\\n\\n Whereas Seira looked speechless.\\n\\n \"...You were making that too? What exactly are you doing underground, Lee Shin Woo?\"\\n\\n \"Preparing for the future. We\u0027ll be unemployed once we\u0027re done with our mission as heroes. I have to prepare for my later years, don\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"Preparing for your later years, huh... I anguished over whether I could defeat the Emperor or not, but you were trying to find a job...?\"\\n\\n At first, she didn\u0027t expect much, but her eyes widened, as Lee Shin Woo\u0027s answer exceed any expectations she might\u0027ve had. Whereas Pleine just gazed at him, wondering when she\u0027d be able to taste the brandy. Pleine knew him well enough to not be surprised about him preparing for his later years.\\n\\n \"On our world, we mixed brandy and tea together. Is it the same here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not good with alcohol...\"\\n\\n \"I just like drinking alcohol by itself, so... Ah.\"\\n\\n \"Then why don\u0027t you try it?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo cruelly and boldly added the brandy to the tea, as if he had no intention of listening to them in the first place.\\n\\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo added only a small amount of brandy to Seira\u0027s cup, so that she could smell it but not taste it. On the other hand, he dumped so much brandy into Pleine\u0027s cup that it was more akin to brandy with the smell of tea.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not being considerate of the drinkers. How aggressive.\"\\n\\n \"But isn\u0027t it strange that men like that are popular?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose that\u0027s how it is in my older sister and Dana\u0027s romance novels. But in real life, it\u0027s the worst.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo ignored her grumbling and drank his own tea. He could smell a soft scent of brandy mixed into his tea, which really fit his taste.\\n\\n While they were good enough on their own, they tasted better by mixing them together. Brandy tea was a good example of this.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was satisfied. Pleine, who sipped on her own tea, smiled and said.\\n\\n \"...It\u0027s quite good. Is it because of the quality of the brandy?\"\\n\\n \"I still like tea as is. But it\u0027s not bad. If I had to pick a side, I\u0027d say I like it, but compared to regular tea it\u0027s...\"\\n\\n She could\u0027ve just said she liked it. Pleine just looked at Seira and sighed. As her older sister, she couldn\u0027t stop worrying about her.\\n\\n \"Ha. He\u0027s too good for you.\"\\n\\n \"Hmph. I don\u0027t want him.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, I\u0027m right here. Don\u0027t go giving me to other people all of a sudden.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo stopped their delusions and cleared his throat.\\n\\n \"Anyway... Can I ask you something now? It\u0027s regarding the chatting channel.\"\\n\\n \"The chatting channel?\"\\n\\n [You should talk to me about that.]\\n\\n He\u0027d asked Pleine, but he heard someone else respond from elsewhere. Lee Shin Woo tilted his head and then, the environment changed. He saw a beautiful flower garden in full bloom as if it\u0027d come straight out of a fairytale, along with a white table. He\u0027d seen these things a few times before. It was God\u0027s garden.\\n\\n [Come over here and sit. Ah, brew me some tea too. With a lot of brandy.]\\n\\n \"You could just make it yourself...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo was astounded, yet he pulled out a chair and sat down anyway.\\n\\n Across from him sat that damn God, appearing before him as both an old woman and a high school girl at the same time.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-285","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
