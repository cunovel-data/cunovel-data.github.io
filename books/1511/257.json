We Got a New Colleague! - 4\u003e\\n\\n [Lv8 Immortal Princess Dana]\\n\\n [Immortals are a species that has avoided death. They possess a perfect body that can switch between a spirit\u0027s astral body and a human\u0027s physical body. They are also able to wield the darkness element proficiently.]\\n\\n [As they are fated to live one step away from death, most lethal curses and poisons are ineffective against them and they age extremely slowly. Just their very existence distorts the world\u0027s cause-and-effect, and the world is at risk of collapse if too many are gathered. While they have a long lifespan, their reproductive rate is low.]\\n\\n [The Beginner Dark Shadow element has become Lv9. Magic has increased by 20.]\\n\\n \"Wow, that\u0027s awesome. I want to be an Immortal too.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re already an undead.\"\\n\\n A new species had been born! It was a bewildering achievement, but the wavelength was truly amazing. It wasn\u0027t just an amazing karma for her, but for Lee Shin Woo, the one who\u0027d achieved the feat, as well.\\n\\n It felt like he\u0027d constructed a bridge, allowing them to go somewhere they couldn\u0027t before. It was a mysterious feeling, as though his potential had expanded. In other words, this was the first case where Lee Shin Woo had fooled the world with the Joker\u0027s innate skills.\\n\\n \"Immortal...\"\\n\\n Whereas, the previous Dana Von Etliber, now the Immortal Princess Dana, looked over her body; she was astonished as she absorbed the relevant information that flowed through her mind.\\n\\n She was neither human nor undead; her mind and body possessed a completely different authority from them. Dana could now switch between her astral body and her physical body as well as avoid death; her new abilities were so amazing that she couldn\u0027t comprehend them.\\n\\n \"Ah, you definitely got that from me. I haven\u0027t perfected that ability yet, so why did she...\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s because of the subject\u0027s condition? You said she was in a unique situation. She was exposed to the undead curse for dozens of years without God\u0027s blessing, yet she survived regardless. Do you really think there\u0027d be another case underground of a human surviving that long?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true, but could you not use the word \u0027subject\u0027...?\"\\n\\n Jin spoke sullenly and Lee Shin Woo replied with a bitter smile. By now, he\u0027d mostly figured out how she ticked. Whenever he spoke to another girl or he engaged in any sort of skinship with them, Jin\u0027s mood would sour.\\n\\n \"Wow... This is quite the mysterious feeling. But I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not due to my long-awaited freedom. I wanted to be free, but how could I pay you back for such a gift...?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re so amazed at your new body and all, but even an Immortal will die if this thing blows. Focus on this now.\"\\n\\n \"Ah! T-That\u0027s right!\"\\n\\n Of course, saving the princess was quite a big deal, but Lee Shin Woo\u0027s original goal was to calm down the cannon which would soon blow.\\n\\n Dana was so shocked by her rebirth as an Immortal that she\u0027d completely forgotten the current situation, but she was alerted thanks to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s request. Because an Immortal could freely choose their bodily state, she was currently floating in the air with ease.\\n\\n \"Kratia, how is it?\"\\n\\n \"Hoo. Hoo... Now... you ask...!?\"\\n\\n \"M-My bad...\"\\n\\n While Lee Shin Woo was busy saving Dana, Kratia had been keeping the cannon at bay. She gritted her teeth and looked over towards them.\\n\\n She had assimilated her Orb and had been converting all of her mana into ice. She\u0027d managed to slow down the mana, but she\u0027d used way too much mana today, so she was approaching her limit.\\n\\n \"You asked \u0027how is it\u0027...? It feels like... it\u0027ll blow any minute now...!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll help a bit.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had also used a ton of mana today, but he gathered more mana and helped Kratia with her Stasis Magic, looking like it didn\u0027t bother him in the least. Because he could use the high rank ice element, he was able to help her pretty easily, but...\\n\\n \"This is just a temporary solution.\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately... it\u0027s impossible to stop the cannon once it\u0027s been activated. Now that it\u0027s come to this, we have no choice but to get rid of the energy.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. Then let\u0027s focus on that.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo retraced his steps.\\n\\n First, this hundred meter tall cannon had activated its accumulated mana and was about to blow.\\n\\n Second, the mana it\u0027d gathered from the denizens of Bayran, as well as the spirits, had been contaminated and stored within.\\n\\n Third, once the mana had been activated, stopping it was impossible. It had to fire somewhere.\\n\\n \"What if we stop it and run away?\"\\n\\n \"We could.\"\\n\\n \"...Huh?\"\\n\\n Kratia had asked without much thought, and Lee Shin Woo agreed much the same. Then, Kratia looked at him vacantly. Though it was difficult to tell the difference with her, as she normally had a pretty neutral expression.\\n\\n \"We can...?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. Of course, we can\u0027t get away by just running. Even Jin can\u0027t get away from the blast running at top speed.\"\\n\\n Of course, Lee Shin Woo and Jin both possessed resurrection abilities, but the cannon was so powerful that they would probably die more than a few times.\\n\\n What about the others? They would die without question. Even Dana Von Etliber, who\u0027d just been reborn as an Immortal, would die too. It wasn\u0027t something that even she, as someone who\u0027d barely avoided death, could survive.\\n\\n \"But I can transport us somewhere else with the Heaven Door\u0027s Key, a place where the blast won\u0027t reach us.\"\\n\\n \"Then can\u0027t we just run away...?\"\\n\\n \"But there\u0027s a maximum occupancy. If we took the Heaven Door\u0027s Key, then I\u0027d have to sacrifice all the Pauls and golems.\"\\n\\n And Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t want that. Not only did he still have a use for Arema, he didn\u0027t want his loyal Pauls to die here.\\n\\n Above all, he couldn\u0027t allow this much energy to go to waste.\\n\\n [Hoo. Hoo... So there\u0027re things that even the Heaven Defying General can\u0027t do, huh?]\\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re awake.\"\\n\\n Arema Steelworker had awoken, but he probably wouldn\u0027t be helpful in the current situation. However, he decided upon a course of action that Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t expected. Arema Steelworker aimed his fist at him.\\n\\n He\u0027d collected a considerable amount of energy at the end of his fist. Why was he doing this now? Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, as he couldn\u0027t understand why.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n [I heard everything. I\u0027ll die here anyway, and you\u0027re trying to run away... If that\u0027s the case, then I have only one job. To bury you, and even my body, here. I, Arema Steelworker, cannot retreat, even against you!]\\n\\n \"...Ah.\"\\n\\n Now that he thought about it, one could interpret their conversation that way! Lee Shin Woo\u0027s intention was more along the lines of \u0027at this rate, we\u0027ll all die, so let\u0027s all find a different way out of this\u0027, but Arema and the golems had interpreted it as \u0027the golems will all die here anyway\u0027! The situation had become pointlessly complicated!\\n\\n \"Arema, it seems like you\u0027re misunderstanding something. If possible, I\u0027m going to save you guys too. To do that, I\u0027m...\"\\n\\n [That\u0027s just an excuse. You left your enemies behind you and talked without a second thought. You only have yourself to blame!]\\n\\n Jeez. It looked like he wouldn\u0027t be able to clear up the misunderstanding! This was no time to be fighting amongst themselves, yet Arema Steelworker had collected a ton of metal mana and launched it towards him regardless.\\n\\n However, before Lee Shin Woo could waste his time fighting Arema, someone else had stood in front of him. It was none other than Dana.\\n\\n \"Arema, know your place! This is no place for you, a golem and a dirty follower of the surface!\"\\n\\n [You survived, Princess! But what can an Elementalist do without any spirits!?]\\n\\n \"Ha!\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have any spirits on hand, but Lee Shin Woo had bestowed upon her a high concentration of darkness element mana. Although it was her first time wielding said element, she extended the darkness forward and absorbed Arema\u0027s attack. At the same time, she launched dozens of darkness chains towards him and immobilized him!\\n\\n [Kuhahk!?]\\n\\n \"You were always weak to elemental mana. That must be why you always hated Elementalists like myself. I wonder just how humiliating it must have been for you!\"\\n\\n [Keuk. This darkness... You didn\u0027t... Heaven Defying General, you bastard! What did you do to this woman!?]\\n\\n \"To think you\u0027d be looking elsewhere during our fight. It seems you\u0027ve grown!\"\\n\\n [Help our lord!]\\n\\n [My lord!]\\n\\n Arema\u0027s golems rushed into the fray. Lee Shin Woo was busy enough dealing with the cannon as is!\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo gritted his teeth and launched his remaining weapons, killing the weakest golems with ease. He\u0027d only let them live, as he felt like he\u0027d find a use for them later, but it was quite laughable to see them rushing forward.\\n\\n [Chi Paul.]\\n\\n At the same time, he didn\u0027t forget to send a message to his subordinate.\\n\\n [I\u0027m listening, Lord Paul Zero!]\\n\\n [What\u0027s the situation over there?]\\n\\n [They had three level 7 elites, but we\u0027ve just finished dealing with their entire force. We\u0027re in the middle of collecting all the loot!]\\n\\n [Alright, good.]\\n\\n As he thought, Anti-Skull was dangerous. There were six level 7 elites that had entered into the inner city! If Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t brought enough troops, then he would\u0027ve been the one that\u0027d lost!\\n\\n No, the loot wasn\u0027t important right now. Their most important battle lay in front of them.\\n\\n [I keep telling you to come and go. Sorry about that, Chi Paul. But I have good news for you this time.]\\n\\n [Are you saying that...?]\\n\\n [That\u0027s right. You guys will have to take care of the golems personally. I can do it myself, but I\u0027m busy dealing with something a bit more important right now.]\\n\\n [It\u0027s an honor! Thank you so much! We\u0027ll be there ASAP!]\\n\\n Those weren\u0027t empty words. Since he could feel the Chi Pauls rushing over to the inner city! Moreover, they were coming over extremely quickly, as the chaos in the city had destroyed all the traps!\\n\\n [Damn you, Heaven Defying General... Let me go!]\\n\\n \"Relax. Since I\u0027m not the one who\u0027ll kill you.\"\\n\\n [Keuk. Keuuuk!]\\n\\n While Arema was struggling against Dana, Lee Shin Woo used his energy to pressure the golems, killing the level 6 golems, as they weren\u0027t worth the Chi Pauls\u0027 time, and preventing the rest from moving. The remaining level 7 Four Heavenly Commanders were unable to resist, and merely staggered and screamed. It was truly an overwhelming pressure.\\n\\n But even Lee Shin Woo was restless. To think he\u0027d have to play around with these idiots when the cannon could blow at any minute...! If he hadn\u0027t managed to evolve Dana as smoothly as he did, then he\u0027d be the one in trouble!\\n\\n [Lord Paul Zero!]\\n\\n \"How the hell did you guys get here so fast!?\"\\n\\n At that moment, the Chi Pauls had returned to the battle with impeccable timing. They were so happy to be facing off against the golems that their eyes gleamed. They were right about to rush into the battle, but Lee Shin Woo stopped them.\\n\\n \"Before you go, I have a present for you.\"\\n\\n [A present... Does that mean...?]\\n\\n Chi Paul asked, representing the rest of them. Lee Shin Woo smiled benevolently and took out an item he\u0027d taken out once before. Seeing that, Chi Paul, as well as Arema, who was fighting against Dana, widened their eyes.\\n\\n [Y-You bastard...! That\u0027s...! That\u0027s...!]\\n\\n \"This is Arema\u0027s real body. ...You\u0027ll be able to do your best after eating this, right?\"\\n\\n [Lord Paul Zero...! Thank you so much...!]\\n\\n [You bastard, Paul Zeroooooooooo!]\\n\\n As if he were a mother giving her son a lunchbox filled with a nutritious and light meal before their college exam, Lee Shin Woo passed Chi Paul Arema\u0027s real body. Chi Paul was deeply touched and his throat was choked up, yet he barely managed to respond. Whereas, Arema Steelworker was filled with rage and hatred.\\n\\n \"You demon...\"\\n\\n \"Affirmative.\"\\n\\n Jin said quietly. Although Kratia was busy maintaining the Statis Magic, she faintly nodded her head and agreed with her.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-257","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
