The Battle Against Seagald - 3\u003e Today was the day that Lee Shin Woo would meet with the second group of Vampires and head towards the capital. He left the Metal Army base and arrived at the secret rendezvous location, but was at a bit of a loss. [It\u0027s a pleasure to meet you, Lord Arema Steelworker, the Empire\u0027s Guardian!] [It\u0027s an honor to meet a Steelworker!] [For the Emperor!] There was, of course, no problem with the quality of the army. Two more level eight generals had come, and they were definitely more powerful than the Steel Armor General. That wasn\u0027t all. Though they weren\u0027t part of the 12 Generals, there were still five level 7 elites amongst the 500 level 6 elite Vampires. The Emperor truly did send his best. However... \"It\u0027s been a while, Arema Steelworker.\" [...It really has been a long time.] An unknown woman acted like she knew him, with a really displeased expression at that. \u0027Beauty\u0027 was the most apt term for this charming middle-aged woman, but it really didn\u0027t matter to Lee Shin Woo either way. [Lv8 Light General Sorura Von Lilaine - Elder Vampire] She must\u0027ve known Arema Steelworker for a long time. Lee Shin Woo had figured out her name but didn\u0027t know anything else about her, so he contacted Chi Paul and tried to get some info on her. However, he wasn\u0027t able to get much on her. What he did know was that she really wasn\u0027t a relative. \"You went so far as to become a golem and come down here, yet you weren\u0027t able to do anything right, let alone fulfill your mission; ultimately forcing me to come down to this wretched place.\" \"Hahaha. Forgive her, Arema. Madam Lilaine is just happy to see you. She knows more than anyone how much you\u0027ve sacrificed and what you\u0027ve achieved here. Isn\u0027t that right, Madam?\" \"How ridiculous. No matter how much you\u0027ve achieved in the past, it doesn\u0027t matter if you fail now. I\u0027m so ashamed that I was once at the same level as this man.\" The other level 8 general was a middle-aged man, called the \u0027Sun Spear General Judika Von Beloduns\u0027 (he was also an Elder Vampire as well), and he likewise acted like he knew Arema, but Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t know who he was either. They weren\u0027t suspicious of him, as he maintained Arema\u0027s basic qualities, but... \"Oh my. It seems to me that Arema has gotten just as strong as we have. Isn\u0027t that right, Arema?\" [Hmph. There\u0027s nothing for me to say. You\u0027ll see soon enough.] \"Haha, you\u0027re still the same.\" To think that he\u0027d run into this kind of problem. He was briefly puzzled, but soon realized that the Emperor had sent generals with the same standing as Arema himself; they had served the Emperor just as long as he had, and they had achieved just as much. Lee Shin Woo realized this and decided to throw out a feeler. [If you all came down here, then what about the surface?] [Don\u0027t worry about the Emperor\u0027s safety, Arema. One of the Four Heavenly Commanders is still by His Majesty\u0027s side.] Bingo! As expected, these guys were part of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He\u0027d learned that the surface\u0027s four strongest generals were also called the Four Heavenly Commanders when he was on the surface. He hadn\u0027t known who they were, but now he knew who three of the four were. Including Arema that is. So that\u0027s how it was. Arema was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders on both the surface and underground... Even though he had died the simplest death of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He inwardly laughed, and the Light General, Sorura Von Lilaine furrowed her brow once more and said. \"Kuroin Von Begner... I don\u0027t like his attitude. He was the first to accept becoming a Vampire, and he acts like he\u0027d lick His Majesty\u0027s feet if he just asked him...\" \"Those words can be construed as disloyalty towards the Emperor, Madam.\" \"I just want to maintain peace in the Empire. His Majesty knows how I feel. Moreover, I ended up becoming a wretched Vampire too. So don\u0027t nitpick, got it?\" \"Hoo. As always, you\u0027re quite fussy, Madam.\" \"And you\u0027re always noisy and annoying.\" Lee Shin Woo just watched the fussy woman and the chatty man. If he were being honest, then he felt like they were good people. But they were going to die anyway, so it didn\u0027t really matter. But it concerned him that they knew Arema Steelworker from a long while back. If his identity was exposed half-way through the operation, then he would have to kill these precious soldiers right then and there. If he knew this would happen then he would have absorbed Arema Steelworker directly (though he\u0027d feel a bit sorry for Chi Paul)... \u0027No, there\u0027s no point in regretting it now. I can do it. I can act like him with just the info I have on hand. Only then can I call myself a true Joker.\u0027 When he was still in South Korea there was a voice phishing scam that worked by just knowing one\u0027s name and telephone number. It was the most simple, but also most advanced level of trickery that anticipated one\u0027s responses and behavior while leading them to give you what you wanted. But Lee Shin Woo already knew Arema Steelworker\u0027s personality, and could perfectly replicate his appearance and voice. There was no way he couldn\u0027t do what so many other swindlers could! Then, the Light General approached him, slapped his back, and said curtly. \"You\u0027re just as slow as ever, Arema. How long do you plan to dawdle around? If you\u0027re ready, then wipe that stupid expression off your face and give the order to march.\" [Mm.] It was really difficult to measure how close they were. But if they were close enough that she told him to hurry up and give the order, then despite the hostility that she showed him earlier... she didn\u0027t seem to really hate Arema Steelworker. She was essentially acknowledging that he had the right to command them, including her. Lee Shin Woo snorted and said. [I\u0027m glad you have my back. I hope you stay like that when you fight against Seagald.] \"Are you looking down on me? I won\u0027t be defeated like you. You won\u0027t get a chance to do anything, Arema. Just think about a way to safely get into the capital.\" \"His Majesty told me that you knew where Seagald was. Do you have a surefire method of finding him? Or do you have an artifact that can find him?\" [It\u0027s nothing so amazing. My subordinates scoured the underground for dozens of years, so I was able to find his bases. In exchange, I lost some of my precious subordinates, but... He shouldn\u0027t be able to hide within the capital. Especially if his goal is Jissehanu.] \"As expected.\" The Sun Spear General shrugged his shoulders and narrowed his eyes. He was doubting him... No, a person who was about to joke around often looked like this. \"You stuck by Jissehanu\u0027s side for dozens of years, so you should know the capital like the back of your hand.\" [Don\u0027t make it sound like I feel anything for Jissehanu. All I feel for him is hatred. You\u0027ll make me feel nauseous.] \"Haha. I\u0027ve never doubted your loyalty, Arema. Anyway, be more friendly, like old times.\" [You and I? Don\u0027t make me laugh.] \"Kek. You\u0027ve gotten even more rigid. Seems like Madam Lilaine is going to have a hard time... Ugh!\" \"You... I told you to shut up!\" Good, it worked! They weren\u0027t suspicious of him at all! It felt like they were tested him whenever he spoke, but he got a feel for it with his comment. Lee Shin Woo smiled and took a step forward. [Are you all ready?] [Yes, sir!] [Good.] The Vampires were frozen stiff, as they couldn\u0027t interfere with the Four Heavenly Commanders\u0027 conversation, and the several hundred level 6 golems Lee Shin Woo had prepared were likewise all lined up. Lee Shin Woo spared a glance at one of the golems, coughed, and then turned his gaze towards the rest of the troops. [Listen up! That rebel, Seagald Von Retadane, dares to challenge the Emperor, who rules over both the surface and underground and had the gall to confuse His Majesty with his petty flames! Right now, he\u0027s headed towards the underground capital. He\u0027s going to use that poor ability of his to brainwash Jissehanu and attempt to tread upon the surface. Not only has he troubled our great Emperor, but that dirty skeleton is trying to hurt our innocent citizens. We can\u0027t let that happen!] [No, we can\u0027t!] [We have to kill him!] The Vampires were enthralled and responded strongly. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s overwhelming pressure caused them all to unite as one. Even the Light General, whose hand was shaking the Sun Spear General\u0027s head, was surprised and widened her eyes. [As one of the Empire\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders, I, Arema Steelworker, order you! We\u0027re going to the capital. We\u0027ll destroy anything in our way and present Seagald\u0027s head to His Majesty! It\u0027s going to be dangerous. Those fools will try to stop us. The Lich may show up too. Even Jissehanu may come. But even so, can we afford to back down!?] [No!] [The Emperor\u0027s forces knows no retreat!] [That\u0027s right! I\u0027ll tell you once more, so listen up. We\u0027re going to the capital! We\u0027re going to kill Seagald Von Retadane! I\u0027ll give you all this chance. Anyone who catches him, hurts him, or kills him! You\u0027ll be rewarded based on your contribution! Let\u0027s take back the Empire\u0027s eternal peace with our own two hands. His Majesty will certainly recognize those who have died and those who have survived!] [That\u0027s right!] [It\u0027ll definitely go as you say, Lord Arema!] The Vampires had instantaneously become one and cried out. Though some of them were indeed loyal to the Emperor, Lee Shin Woo had instantly amplified their emotions through his speech. Even if there were some who may have opposed the Magic Emperor, with his Lv9 High Rank Command skill, which was amplified by his Acting and Instigate skills, his speech would cause them to yell \u0027Aye!\u0027. Even the Light General\u0027s heart throbbed, despite her not swearing fealty to the Emperor. Though in her case, it wasn\u0027t because of the contents of his speech... [Alright, then. March! We won\u0027t turn back until we kill Seagald!] [Uooooooooooh!] The soldiers were excited. The Light General and the Sun Spear General got a hold of themselves but had raised an arm alongside the soldiers. They soon realized this and lowered their arms in embarrassment. \"I\u0027m surprised, Arema. When did you get so good at talking? It was as if you were a different person.\" [I just realized that you need several ways to command.] \"...Hmph. You\u0027re still as dull as ever, but at least it seems like you haven\u0027t regressed.\" The Sun Spear General was shocked, but the Light General was still as sarcastic as ever. Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t say anything and turned his gaze to the front. He was looking at the golem that he\u0027d looked at before. And he spoke to that golem telepathically. [It was an amazing speech. I see that that\u0027s how you\u0027ve been fooling us till now.] [If you\u0027re that amazed by my abilities, then just compliment me.] Lee Shin Woo telepathically spoke to that golem... no, that empty shell that Seira was in and took a step forward. He had taken another step forward towards the fated battle.
