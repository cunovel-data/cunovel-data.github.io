Hansen Von Dorthe - 4\u003e\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo released his \u0027lord cosplay\u0027, betraying the guilt-free skeletons and massacring them. Yet the Lightning General and the Treasure Eater had no idea, as they were still fighting against each other.\\n\\n The Lightning General didn\u0027t have the time to look away, as his opponent was freakishly strong and tenacious!\\n\\n [Kyahaaaaaaaahk!]\\n\\n [Tch. What\u0027s making you so desperate?]\\n\\n [Kuaaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n Since they both knew that lightning wouldn\u0027t work on each other, they instead used their mana purely to reinforce their bodies. It seemed as though both were thinking \u0027why did it have to be him?\u0027, regardless of who was more intelligent or not.\\n\\n [Die!]\\n\\n [Kyahak!]\\n\\n Hansen swung his bastard sword with enough power to topple a mountain, and the Treasure Eater matched his reinforced blade with a reinforcement of its own; it concentrated its mana into its tail to reinforce it, and then used it to block the incoming sword!\\n\\n The moment the sword and tail met, there was a large boom and the land quaked; the entire area sunk. Their collision caused the geography of the land to change; so much so that either side had the credentials to be called a calamity.\\n\\n [Tch, another draw...]\\n\\n Though it was frustrating for Hansen to admit, their strength was about equal. Hansen possessed higher strength and agility, but the Treasure Eater was a monster that possessed an unusually high amount of magic, even when compared to other like-leveled monsters! It covered its weakness in strength and agility with its magic, and as a result, they were evenly matched.\\n\\n If that\u0027s the case, then killing it quickly was no longer an option. He\u0027d have to take advantage of its mistakes and cause it to accumulate injuries over time. If not, then he\u0027d have to use large scale techniques... he was going to continue like this for now and observe.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no way a monster like this would appear anywhere... There\u0027s still something here that I don\u0027t know about.\u0027\\n\\n A Treasure Eater wouldn\u0027t appear in a place devoid of treasures. The item had to be amazing to entice a level 7 Treasure Eater... Hansen thought of taking the treasure that the Treasure Eater was hoarding, as well as the treasure that it sought.\\n\\n With that in mind, Hansen was relieved that he hadn\u0027t reported to the Emperor regarding this excursion. He\u0027d thought that it was unnecessary to bother the Emperor when it wasn\u0027t regarding the golems\u0027 capture, yet it was an opportunity for him to get something on the side!\\n\\n \u0027Is it the lord? Yeah, he had to have obtained a treasure recently.\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027d already figured out prior that the Treasure Eater\u0027s target was the lord. The lord must be happy that he can use him to take care of the Treasure Eater, but after he\u0027d taken down this guy, he would snatch that treasure off the lordâ€™s hands as the price for telling a general to come to him!\\n\\n \u0027So, smile while you still can... Huh!?\u0027\\n\\n However, during the small moment after he\u0027d dodged the Treasure Eater\u0027s charge, Hansen turned his attention to the lord atop the castle walls and couldn\u0027t believe his eyes. To the point that he believed that his eyes had finally rotted away completely after dozens of years of being an undead.\\n\\n The lord who was smiling and looking down from the castle walls was... completely different from before! Especially because the skeleton, who stared back at him with black goblin fire in his eyes while riding a horse, possessed power that caused him unease, albeit for a mere moment.\\n\\n \u0027W-What\u0027s this!? Is that the lord? Plus, I don\u0027t see any of his subordinates atop the castle walls; am I seeing things wrong? No, I remember the lord\u0027s face and energy; I remember everything!\u0027\\n\\n All beings possess an inherent energy that they cannot change. That is represented by magic. Even though there were cases where the shape of mana continuously developed, changed form, and developed again, it wasn\u0027t possible to instantaneously change its fundamental nature.\\n\\n \u0027But that guy is... Kuheok!\u0027\\n\\n Is it because he paid too much attention to this unbelievable situation? Hansen was hit directly by the Treasure Eater\u0027s body tackle and was thrown into the air. He wasn\u0027t the only one aiming for his opponent\u0027s weaknesses; the Treasure Eater was as well. Because Hansen was so shocked, he had momentarily forgotten about the current battle!\\n\\n \u0027How...?\u0027\\n\\n Once he\u0027d been struck by the Treasure Eater and was thrown into the air, he barely managed to land and return to a proper stance. Even so, Hansen couldn\u0027t take his mind off of Lee Shin Woo. Even as he swung his bastard sword and blocked the Treasure Eater\u0027s charge, he continued to think about Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n \u0027How did he disguise himself as another? If that\u0027s truly possible, then when did he start? Was it when he called me? No, it shouldn\u0027t be that easy to release the lock on the communication device...!\u0027\\n\\n The more he thought about it, the less he understood his current situation. No matter how he thought about it, he came to the conclusion that \u0027it was impossible\u0027! Of course, it was Lee Shin Woo\u0027s ability that had caused the general such confusion. That\u0027s what it meant to step onto the Joker\u0027s stage.\\n\\n [Kuaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n [Tch...!]\\n\\n Until now, Hansen had a slight advantage against the Treasure Eater, but because of his confusion, the tides of battle had turned. The Treasure Eater rushed him, as though it was capitalizing on this opportunity. Even though he knew that he shouldn\u0027t get distracted, his head was still in the clouds.\\n\\n \u0027Did I fall for a trap? If so, then whose? Is it Anti-Skull... No, that\u0027s unlikely. Then the golems? Is it Arema Steelworker? Yeah, it wouldn\u0027t be impossible for them to make a golem with such a strange ability...! The one thing I\u0027m sure about is that that skeleton isn\u0027t the mastermind behind all this.\u0027\\n\\n From that point, Hansen had already gone astray. He couldn\u0027t believe that Lee Shin Woo had planned this all by himself and surmised that there had to be someone behind him!\\n\\n But unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo no longer made him feel afraid or tense. Rather...\\n\\n \u0027...There\u0027s no point in thinking about this anymore by myself. Pull yourself together, Hansen!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even if it\u0027s rotten, it\u0027s still a herring.\u0027 No, actually it\u0027s a general. He halted all thoughts that came about from this chaotic situation and instead raised his fighting spirit.\\n\\n Realizing early on that using his brain isn\u0027t his job, and focusing on what he\u0027s good at is. That was the first thing he realized in his life!\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. Whoever it is that\u0027s pulling the strings... I\u0027ll show them that a general isn\u0027t to be taken lightly...!\u0027\\n\\n At the very least, the only level 7 he could sense here was the level 7 Treasure Eater. If that\u0027s the case, then it didn\u0027t matter what obstacle he faced; he would be able to overcome it with his strength. He, the Lightning General, was sure of it. He possessed the strength that would make that possible!\\n\\n \u0027No matter who it is or what they do, I\u0027ll just burn them to a crisp...!\u0027\\n\\n Once he was finished taking care of the Treasure Eater, the skeleton atop the castle walls with chaotically burning goblin fire was next. He was surprised by the fact that he had been vexed by the lord just a little while ago, as he was sure that the lord wouldn\u0027t be able to match him in strength.\\n\\n Of course, there was something that was waiting for him after too. But it didn\u0027t matter. They would burn from his lightning!\\n\\n [I\u0027ll burn you and break you into pieces! Witness my true strength, the strength of the Lightning Shadow [1] General, Hansen Von Dorthe!]\\n\\n He fended off the Treasure Eater, and the moment it was pushed back, Hansen\u0027s body was covered in lightning. If he knew that lightning was useless against his opponent, then why? Of course, the lightning wasn\u0027t for an attack.\\n\\n [Watch, you insignificant creature. This is how you use lightning...!]\\n\\n He forcefully discharged the lightning and slowly gathered the lightning inside his body. At the same time, his body started becoming fainter and fainter!\\n\\n No, it wasn\u0027t becoming faint. The lightning covering his body was rotating much too quickly and was emitting sparks; he was making it so that it was difficult to see where his body even was. In the midst of that, his body and mana surpassed their limits, and it was almost as if his body and the lightning had become one.\\n\\n \u0027Holy shit, that\u0027s really intense...!\u0027\\n\\n Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo held his breath. Lee Shin Woo had never met anyone outside of monsters with such a strong elemental affinity, and it goes without saying that Hansen\u0027s technique interested him. From the position of someone who could use the lightning element, he couldn\u0027t miss a single moment of this!\\n\\n [This is... true lightning!]\\n\\n [Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n Lightning Shadow described a lightning so powerful that could only be seen as a shadow. It wasn\u0027t merely something like attacking quickly and covertly. The key point of this technique was to hide one\u0027s body within the powerful energy!\\n\\n [How much longer do you intend to trouble me for... Die!]\\n\\n It was difficult to even ascertain the true nature of the technique, and it was similarly difficult to avoid it or defend against it. Even if he possessed lightning resistance, it couldnâ€™t be easy to focus that tremendous magic and heat, that surpassed that of ordinary lightning, into a single point!\\n\\n [Kyaaaaaaaaahk!]\\n\\n The Treasure Eater channeled its energy in an attempt to resist. However, before its defenses were ready, Hansen forcefully struck out with his bastard sword. The energy surrounding his bastard sword made it look like a several meter long greatsword. No, it was like the lightning of a god that descended onto the mortal world!\\n\\n [Ki-Kihik...]\\n\\n [Hoo.]\\n\\n Hansen had pierced a giant hole in the Treasure Eater. Seeing that outrageous sight, Lee Shin Woo thought that he might\u0027ve made the wrong decision. That attack that the Lightning General had unleashed wasn\u0027t something that could be blocked with mere lightning resistance.\\n\\n \u0027Then I guess I really will have to be prepared to die one or two times... Huh?\u0027\\n\\n [Guu... Guuooooooooh!]\\n\\n But then, the Treasure Eater showed its own secret weapon. Hansen grinned from landing such a huge attack, but the Treasure Eater then spawned dozens of tentacles from its injured area that attached to Hansen.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo thought \u0027I\u0027ve seen that somewhere before\u0027 as the tentacles wriggled around, sucking Hansen\u0027s energy.\\n\\n [Kuahk!?]\\n\\n [Kuhuaaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n Both Hansen and the Treasure Eater screamed. The Treasure Eater absorbed the powerful lightning that surrounded Hansen\u0027s body and was healing its injuries! Absorbing elemental power was an offshoot of an element; it wasn\u0027t just the Lightning General who had been waiting for his opportunity.\\n\\n [You... You bastard!]\\n\\n Hansen, who\u0027d lost a tremendous amount of energy, swung his bastard sword, and severed all of the attached tentacles. There\u0027s no use crying over spilled milk. The Treasure Eater had almost fully healed the injury it had sustained by absorbing Hansen\u0027s mana.\\n\\n [You dare... push me this far!]\\n\\n [Kihaaaaaaaah!]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo watched both Hansen and the Treasure Eater as they gasped for breath; both of them had run low on magic and health. And judged strictly, earnestly, and solemnly.\\n\\n \"Mm, this is a draw.\"\\n\\n \"I was wondering why you weren\u0027t saying anything.\"\\n\\n \"But more importantly, Jin, it\u0027s about time we started moving.\"\\n\\n If one were to ask if Lee Shin Woo was just leisurely watching the fight, then the answer would obviously be no. He had absorbed all of the level 5 and level 6 bones from his betrayal (he\u0027d stored all of the level 3 and 4 bones in his inventory, which totaled in the tens of thousands), and increased his stats significantly. At the same time, he had infused the Drake Horn Lances with his replenished magic and had been waiting for the right time.\\n\\n \u0027Two, three, four, five... My armor\u0027s all set too.\u0027\\n\\n He had the five Drake Horn Lances, and because he had returned to his original form, he had unsummoned the Lighting Tooth and had instead summoned his armor set. He decided to act when he had finished infusing his armor with magic as well!\\n\\n \"They went back and forth, but the general\u0027s still stronger, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. If it keeps going on like this, the Treasure Eater will definitely lose.\"\\n\\n And from Lee Shin Woo\u0027s position, that wasn\u0027t a very fun conclusion. It was time to add another variable.\\n\\n \"Alright... Finally, it\u0027s time to set [Operation - Bro, where are you going?] into motion.\"\\n\\n \"Man, all that means is that we\u0027re running.\"\\n\\n As expected, he didn\u0027t get fooled anymore. Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and got onto Jin\u0027s back. He\u0027d collected all of the bones and had finished absorbing them as well, so there was no point in being here any longer. Jin jumped from the castle walls and began to run!\\n\\n [Huh!?]\\n\\n [Guoooook!?]\\n\\n Their destination was obviously where the Golem Chimeras that were experiencing PTSD and rolling on the floor came from... the Sanctuary, the Empire\u0027s testing facility!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Naruto reference to Raikage (Lightning Shadow).
