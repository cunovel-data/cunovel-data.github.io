Heaven Defying General\u0027s Stage - 3\u003e\\n\\n [The Golden Shadow General... He has quite the troublesome ability.]\\n\\n [But his bones will be buried in this city today.]\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really like that expression... You gotta eat all the way down to the bone too.\"\\n\\n [...You.]\\n\\n The pressure exerted by Tarian Von Retadane\u0027s Anti-Skull force (there were three level 7 elites including him, fifteen level 6 elites, and 500 normal level 6s) and Arema Steelworker\u0027s Metal Army (which consisted of the Four Heavenly Commanders (level 7 elites) and 200 level 6 elite golems) combined was truly extraordinary. \\n\\n But Lee Shin Woo was all alone. He was, of course, with the level 8 Jin, but to everyone else, Jin just looked like a strong warhorse. Arema Steelworker then asked.\\n\\n [What about your subordinates?]\\n\\n \"They\u0027re doing their own thing. They\u0027re keeping the Golden Shadow General busy.\"\\n\\n [What...!?]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had only brought along his Chi Paul squad, which only consisted of 31 Chi Pauls.\\n\\n However, there were five level 7 elites among them, and the rest were level 6 elites at the cusp of level 7, so his force was no pushover. Lee Shin Woo spoke so nonchalantly that both Anti-Skull and the Metal Army felt tense.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re all on the same side now, right? Don\u0027t be so tense. My boys won\u0027t be able to stop the Golden Shadow General on their own... So, that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking for your help.\"\\n\\n [...That\u0027s true. As expected of the Heaven Defying General.]\\n\\n Unlike his reply, his expression indicated no signs of understanding. In the midst of the heavy silence, the two forces exchanged glances. Lee Shin Woo had forced Anti-Skull and the Metal Army into an uneasy alliance, so there was no way they\u0027d be pleased.\\n\\n \u0027So long as I possess the golems\u0027 bodies, there\u0027s no way they\u0027ll attack me first. But, Anti-Skull doesn\u0027t know that yet...\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know why, but for some reason, Anti-Skull was hostile towards him, and he didn\u0027t want this situation to drag on forever. Tarian would probably try to consult with Arema when Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t looking, and if he fails (he would obviously fail), there was a chance that their alliance would break apart.\\n\\n \u0027If there\u0027s no way of bringing Anti-Skull over to my side, then it wouldn\u0027t be such a bad idea to make them fight against the golems.\u0027\\n\\n Although he was working together with them, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s brain was still busy. He also couldn\u0027t keep the golems on his side forever. Before they tried something in an attempt to regain their bodies from him, he would need to find the right time to kill them...\\n\\n \u0027How could I take care of them without them noticing?\u0027, Lee Shin Woo wondered, and then asked Tarian Von Retadane, who hadn\u0027t been able to fully conceal his killing intent.\\n\\n \"The Fire Slayer Sword God isn\u0027t with you?\"\\n\\n [He didn\u0027t come. He had something more important to do.]\\n\\n \"This is an important assignment.\"\\n\\n [As his representative, my abilities and position are sufficient.]\\n\\n \"Sufficient abilities and position, huh.\"\\n\\n He probably wasn\u0027t wrong. Although Tarian Von Retadane couldn\u0027t match Arema Steelworker, he was definitely stronger than Arema\u0027s Four Heavenly Commanders.\\n\\n But unlike Arema, who personally led his Metal Army, Anti-Skull\u0027s leader hadn\u0027t come, which felt a bit off... Lee Shin Woo directed his questioning gaze at Guillotine, and Guillotine just shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n [We\u0027ll ask them later. But the alliance isn\u0027t as solid as you\u0027d think.]\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n It seemed as though Anti-Skull wasn\u0027t the only one with trust issues. He wondered. It could be the truth, but... Perhaps the golems were dissatisfied with Lee Shin Woo, as he held the noose around their necks, and were just hiding their true feelings.\\n\\n \u0027I feel like it\u0027ll be fine, no matter how the situation turns, but... I suppose I should send Kratia a message first.\u0027\\n\\n Once he\u0027d simply explained the situation to her, he looked over the Anti-Skull squad once more. Unlike the undead he\u0027d awakened, the Anti-Skull\u0027s undead emitted a familiar type of mana. Lee Shin Woo wondered what it was but soon found the answer.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s light.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Although Anti-Skull had experimented with a variety of poisons, he sensed traces of the light element from their mana. Of course, they couldn\u0027t use the light element on their own, they just gave off the feeling that they\u0027d somehow copied the light element.\\n\\n \u0027It makes sense. After all, if you have the light element, the element that represents life, then you should be able to fight back against the undead curse. Perhaps these guys have retained their intellect, and they\u0027re no longer ordinary undead due to the light element\u0027s severing effect.\u0027\\n\\n As always, it was just his delusions at work and he didn\u0027t have any proof, but it made sense. However, he still had his doubts. If those countless tests to resist the undead curse were an attempt to obtain the light element, then who the hell was Seagald Von Retadane, the one in charge of those tests?\\n\\n \u0027There are plenty of clues.\u0027\\n\\n Seira Von Retadane, who could use the light element. The royal family, with power that matched Jissehanu\u0027s at the time of their exile and was also the origin of the Retadane family. It was likely that the Retadane family studied the light element.\\n\\n Seira Von Retadane and Seagald Von Retadane were likely born with the ability to wield light, and that\u0027s why Seagald was capable of executing such a grandiose plan.\\n\\n \u0027Like my affinity with the darkness element...\u0027\\n\\n He could easily understand why Seira Von Retadane became the first hero, and why Pleine was chosen as God\u0027s apostle. It was because their family was born with the light element!\\n\\n Lineage was everything. After all, the Golden Shadow General was the firstborn of a family that could control shadows.\\n\\n \u0027However, that\u0027s where things differ... How you use what you have and how you develop it. And this guy... No matter how I think of it, he failed.\u0027\\n\\n At some point, Lee Shin Woo discovered thin black threads secretly traveling across the ground and the nearby buildings. The mana threads were created from the buildings\u0027 and peoples\u0027 shadows.\\n\\n He thought he had hidden himself, but it was a pitiful attempt to Lee Shin Woo, who could use Dark Shadow. It might work if the Golden Shadow were fighting against those weaker than him, but how would his technique fare against Lee Shin Woo...?\\n\\n [Stop!]\\n\\n When Lee Shin Woo was about to secretly extend his sword and slice the shadow, Arema, who was standing at the forefront, discovered the traces and stiffly ordered his troops to stop. Unlike the others, Jin, who had been walking slowly to match their pace, stopped with ease.\\n\\n [He\u0027s nearby. Golden Shadow! A tough battle awaits us. The nearby roads and buildings have been turned inside out...!]\\n\\n [Is it the Golden Shadow General\u0027s barrier!?]\\n\\n Right when the group flinched and stopped, Chi Paul reported through telepathy. The Golden Shadow had been caught in the traps, but ultimately, the Golden Shadow General joined the battle. Although three of the Chi Pauls, including one level 7 elite, had sustained critical injuries and were forced to retire, the rest of his forces were able to retreat safely.\\n\\n He was a level 8 capable of controlling shadows and was also a part of the 12 Generals, yet none of them had died. As he thought, their anger towards Arema Steelworker was increasing their abilities by a \u0027level\u0027 or perhaps even more.\\n\\n [Tell the injured to return. Pick out only those who can still fight and wait at the place I designate. If all goes well, you may be able to fight against Anti-Skull as well.]\\n\\n [Understood!]\\n\\n [Everyone, get ready for battle. He\u0027ll likely ambush us. Focus!]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo saw the Metal Army and Anti-Skull prepare for battle and summoned his own weapons. It was the jet-black Giant Drake Horn Lance that he\u0027d infused darkness mana into prior! Arema Steelworker and Tarian Von Retadane flinched at the sight of it.\\n\\n [Where did you get...?]\\n\\n [...Darkness? It is darkness!]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had fully charged his seventeen weapons with mana, but only nine of them had been floating in the air. The other eight had been hiding in the shadows, but he\u0027d chosen to extract them. He wasn\u0027t really trying to show off, but it was kind of laughable that a level 8 golem was flinching.\\n\\n \"Is this the first time you\u0027ve seen a lance?\"\\n\\n [If you can wield darkness so easily, then even if you were to fight alone... He\u0027s coming!]\\n\\n Suddenly, the shadow underneath them spread out and covered the entire area! It seemed as though it would dye the entire world black. Arema Steelworker gritted his teeth, gathered his own mana, and fought back against the darkness. However, he was only able to protect a portion of his golems. Most of them had been trapped within the darkness.\\n\\n [Vellun Von Dorthe...!]\\n\\n [Arema Steelworker. You finally show your true colors. To think you\u0027d so fearlessly step foot into one of His Majesty\u0027s cities. I\u0027m happy that I\u0027ll be able to bury you here.]\\n\\n A gloomy man\u0027s voice resounded throughout the darkness. Although they were both level 8s, it seemed as though the Golden Shadow General\u0027s command over his element overpowered Arema\u0027s. Arema instantly gathered his mana and fired it within the darkness. However, the darkness merely dispersed for a short time and soon filled the air once more.\\n\\n [You really think you can fill the entire world with darkness?]\\n\\n [The Underground Empire is governed by darkness. Your metal element is merely unusual. That\u0027s all!]\\n\\n [Come on. I\u0027ll show you the true strength of that unusual power of mine...!]\\n\\n It felt like they\u0027d come to blows at any time. But surprisingly, the Golden Shadow General didn\u0027t strike. Rather than challenging Arema Steelworker\u0027s golden mana, the Golden Shadow General safely hid within the darkness and then ambushed one of the Four Heavenly Commanders.\\n\\n [Keoheok!]\\n\\n [Stake!]\\n\\n It was the right call. Since Stake hadn\u0027t been able to mount a proper defense and was completely destroyed. It made sense. After all, it was the surprise attack of a level 8 and one of the 12 Generals. Even Lee Shin Woo had briefly lost track of his movements.\\n\\n \u0027His stats are geared towards Agility and Magic. It\u0027s a classic strategy. He relies on magic, rather than physical strength to hurt his enemies.\u0027\\n\\n Stake Steelworker\u0027s death signaled the start of the battle. The Golden Shadow General\u0027s forces attacked all at once.\\n\\n His forces hid within the darkness he\u0027d created and continually appeared and disappeared in different areas. They then grouped up and attacked, looking like a wave of darkness.\\n\\n \u0027As I thought, using shadows was a specialized form of darkness.\\n\\n But Lee Shin Woo could see them clearly, as he\u0027d reached peak darkness mastery. If he mixed his darkness within theirs, then he could quickly defeat their entire force, but because he knew that Anti-Skull was hiding something, Lee Shin Woo decided to not do more than what was necessary.\\n\\n \u0027They act like they\u0027re so powerful, but the technique doesn\u0027t feel invincible... Heup!\u0027\\n\\n [Kuhaahk!?]\\n\\n [Guaah!]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo swung his lance strangely. The approaching wave lost its cutting edge and collapsed instantaneously. The Golden Shadow, which had been pointing their weapons at Lee Shin Woo, were flung out. He squashed a portion of them with his lance and challenged the Golden Shadow General.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve just lost your subordinates. You just going to sit there?\"\\n\\n [Keuk. You rat. Let\u0027s see how long you can avoid me!]\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo had just grinned at the face of Stake Steelworker\u0027s death and fought off the Golden Shadow with ease. Arema Steelworker was enraged at the sight, spread out his mana, and began to chase after the Golden Shadow General. Tarian Von Retadane\u0027s Anti-Skull force was likewise struggling against the Golden Shadow.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s see. I wonder what Anti-Skull\u0027s hidden objective is...\u0027\\n\\n If Rem was with him, then he\u0027d be able to more easily observe their movements. Unfortunately, it wasn\u0027t with him right now. But now that it\u0027d come to this, there was no helping it. He had no choice but to use his last resort: \u0027asking the bones themselves\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027All of you, attack Tarian. That\u0027s right. So that I can easily kill him unnoticed... Just a little more. You can do it, Golden Shadow!\u0027\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo licked his lips and his lance slowly melted into the darkness. The Golden Shadow General probably had no idea that the darkness he\u0027d created was being used by someone else.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-246","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
