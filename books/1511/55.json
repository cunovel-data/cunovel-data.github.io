I\u0027m a hero!\"\\n\\n \"A hero!?\"\\n\\n The Magician muttered blankly. Hearing an undead assert that they were a hero must\u0027ve considerably shaken them; they had already stopped attacking. Lee Shin Woo felt relieved in that regard, but then Jin yelled startlingly.\\n\\n \"The ground. The ground!\"\\n\\n \"Tch...\"\\n\\n The problem was the spell that they\u0027d cast before was still around. The wall, composed of sharp thorns of ice were surging upwards several dozens of meters! Now wasn\u0027t the time be relieved!\\n\\n \"Heup!\"\\n\\n Without thinking, Lee Shin Woo brought out a Melting Double Bone Axe and threw it hard. The axe shattered the wall\u0027s sharp edges, and exploded the moment it lodged into the wall\u0027s interior; even though they had responded a bit late, Lee Shin Woo and Jin somehow managed to come out relatively unscathed, amidst the shards of ice.\\n\\n \"I thought we\u0027d become skewers.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, we don\u0027t have any meat to grill, so... Wait, no. It\u0027s my fault. I\u0027m sorry. Stop shaking.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re really terrible. You know that? Absolutely terrible.\"\\n\\n \"It was all my fault. I\u0027m really sorry. Stop shaking.\"\\n\\n \"It certainly doesn\u0027t seem like you\u0027ve been affected by the curse...\"\\n\\n While Lee Shin Woo and Jin were struggling to find a way to survive, the Magician watched them and spoke to herself. But for now, they had completely ignored the Magician in favor of reaching safe ground. They barely felt at ease.\\n\\n \"Are you really heroes? Even though you\u0027re undead...?\"\\n\\n At last, she went back to questioning them. The slim woman stretched her hand outwards from her magician robes, holding an orb that looked like a crystal; it seemed as though she had her magic at the ready depending on how they responded.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re undead, but we\u0027re definitely heroes. If...\"\\n\\n The situation wasn\u0027t favorable for them, and he assumed that they\u0027d ultimately have to fight the magician; he analyzed his opponent\u0027s magic, and while doing so, picked one of the lines that only a hero would know to say and just said it.\\n\\n \"If you can\u0027t believe me, then would you like to access the chatting channel together and check?\"\\n\\n \"The chatting channel... right, there was that.\"\\n\\n It hit the mark. The Magician\u0027s hostility towards them was noticeably diminishing. He also considered that she might be a hero that attacked, saying \u0027Death to all the undead!\u0027, even after acknowledging his claim, but fortunately, it looked like she had abandoned all thoughts of attacking them.\\n\\n \"It was impossible to ascertain your identity, so I thought maybe... I couldn\u0027t bring myself to discard the possibility that were you some unknown undead. Sorry for attacking you.\"\\n\\n \"Ah... now that I think about it.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d even given them an earnest apology! Even after hearing that, Lee Shin Woo inspected her, but he couldn\u0027t figure anything out about her. A hero\u0027s fundamental ability of checking their opponent\u0027s level and identity didn\u0027t work on her. Now that he thought about it, it didn\u0027t work on Jin or Ye Jin Jin either.\\n\\n If that\u0027s the case, then it should\u0027ve been plenty enough to discern that they were heroes, but... Lee Shin Woo decided he\u0027d double check that in the chatting channel later and replied.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Lee Shin Woo. This guy\u0027s Jin. For the record, this guy\u0027s a hero too.\"\\n\\n \"Kratia Melloi [1].\"\\n\\n The magician threw her robe\u0027s hood back, revealing her face and name. She was a young lady whose beauty matched her beautiful voice; she was short, so he had roughly assumed that she was a woman before, but she looked younger than he\u0027d expected, so Lee Shin Woo was shocked.\\n\\n Her eyes were a sky blue, like the frozen sea, with large pupils; her lavender hair, which stretched in every which way as if she didn\u0027t bother to comb it, was especially memorable. To be completely honest, her appearance matched well with the magic she wields.\\n\\n \u0027In any case, I\u0027ve never seen someone called Kratia Melloi enter the chatting channel before... Wait a sec.\u0027\\n\\n Assuming that she wasn\u0027t lying, as she gave her name and showed her appearance, there was someone who matched her description.\\n\\n \"How long has it been since you\u0027ve arrived here?\"\\n\\n \"3 weeks.\"\\n\\n \"As I thought...\"\\n\\n She was definitely the \u0027newbie\u0027 that he\u0027d heard about in the chatting channel a short while ago. Kratia must\u0027ve been the one who had entered the chatting channel once and left immediately, as she felt uncomfortable with all of the seniors\u0027 attention on her. His seniors did say that she didn\u0027t enter again following that incident.\\n\\n But what was surprising was that it had only been 3 weeks since she\u0027d been dropped underground, yet the level of her magic was considerable. Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t even assess the level of her magic, so that meant she was at least higher than level 5. But if that were true, that meant that she started out with that much power. Otherwise, she had to have received that power from God.\\n\\n \"Do I become like you guys by any chance if a lot of time goes by?\"\\n\\n The Magician, Kratia Melloi asked, her eyes filled with a bit of fear. Lee Shin Woo and Jin simultaneously shook their heads and denied her. This confirmed that she was indeed a newbie hero.\\n\\n \"We became like this because of our wishes. On the flip side, there were some things we got in exchange, but I can\u0027t really recommend it.\"\\n\\n \"You became undead because of your wishes? ...As I thought, that woman\u0027s got a mental disorder or something.\"\\n\\n She nonchalantly insulted God and shook her head. And even though he didn\u0027t ask, she extended her hand gripping the orb and said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like other people touching me. So when I asked for ice that could grow, she gave me this.\"\\n\\n \"So she could fulfill that wish because you were already strong, huh...\"\\n\\n Though she was originally a powerful magician, there should\u0027ve been a limit to what God could give her with her powers; she\u0027d successfully managed to receive an artifact that developed all on its own, so she may have made the best choice.\\n\\n If his senior heroes were to have heard, they would\u0027ve said something like \u0027you should\u0027ve asked for a skill that improves the effectiveness of ice type abilities!\u0027 and would\u0027ve been frustrated in her stead.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, what are you going to do?\"\\n\\n Right when he was finished thinking, Jin whispered to Lee Shin Woo. Jin, who was easily frightened, seemed to still be afraid of Kratia, as he was secretly hiding behind his back.\\n\\n Is this really the guy who courageously yelled out that when they died, they would die together... Lee Shin Woo softly stroked his back to tell him it was alright and said his farewells to Kratia.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think there are a lot of cases like us, but be careful from now on. Then, we\u0027ll get going. It was nice meeting you, Kratia Melloi.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a sec.\"\\n\\n He got atop Jin\u0027s back and tried turning around, but Kratia\u0027s sudden urgent voice stopped them. Lee Shin Woo felt Jin inwardly yell, as he\u0027d wanted to leave smoothly.\\n\\n \"I know I\u0027ve been somewhat foolish. Teach me about how this world works.\"\\n\\n \"If you just enter the chatting channel, our seniors will scramble to teach to you. Especially, Lloyd and Prince.\"\\n\\n \"Those guys make me feel uneasy. I also haven\u0027t seen their faces even once...\"\\n\\n Kratia asserted quite firmly. Their seniors had a tendency to be way too excited when a newbie comes in, so it was understandable that she felt unnerved by them. Moreover, though he hadn\u0027t known her for very long, this woman didn\u0027t seem to like socializing very much.\\n\\n Even so, didn\u0027t it seem weird that she trusted an undead whose face she\u0027d seen, rather than a human whose face she hadn\u0027t seen? At least, that\u0027s what Lee Shin Woo thought.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re ok. And... I\u0027m curious.\"\\n\\n She probably isn\u0027t the type to like undead more than humans; Lee Shin Woo tilted his head, wondering what he had to say, and replied in a way that went beyond his imagination.\\n\\n \"The way you use your magic. I want to learn it too.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you were curious about that?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking to learn for free. I have a good grasp on magic as well. There\u0027s probably stuff that I can help with for you two as well.\"\\n\\n The situation was taking a turn beyond his wildest imagination. Lee Shin Woo had originally thought that it would be a waste of time and that he should just refuse, but he stopped for two separate reasons.\\n\\n First off, no matter how he looked at it, she was a professionally trained magician, and would naturally know more about magic across the board. There\u0027s a chance he\u0027d profit from this exchange of knowledge, but honestly, there was also a chance that he would gain absolutely nothing.\\n\\n And secondly, he hadn\u0027t yet found a way to create a high rank administrative authority. If he were to get a hint from her regarding changes in the characteristics of mana, wouldn\u0027t this be considered progress as well...? He thought it wouldn\u0027t be bad to bet on this, rather than continuously hunting golems at a snail\u0027s pace.\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, you\u0027re not going to, are you?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it actually doesn\u0027t sound too bad...\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo commented in favor, and Jin weighed in with a slightly displeased tone.\\n\\n \"Is it because she\u0027s pretty?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to act immature and senseless like that sometime too.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo scolded, and turned his head towards Kratia. He\u0027d made up his mind, and already finished talking with his partner, so now it was time to earnestly negotiate terms.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t stay with you forever.\"\\n\\n \"2 weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Promise that you\u0027ll sincerely cooperate, even if you don\u0027t gain what you want.\"\\n\\n \"You have my word. I promise upon the everlasting mana.\"\\n\\n \"Promise that whatever goes on between us, you leak nothing to the outside.\"\\n\\n \"Likewise.\"\\n\\n \"Alright. Then we\u0027ll be in your care for 2 weeks. So...\"\\n\\n \"Kratia. Nice meeting you, Shin Woo.\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo thoughtlessly extended his right hand, a habit from his time as a human, and Kratia unhesitatingly grabbed his bare bone hand. She really didn\u0027t care that he was undead, and proved that she was only interested in his knowledge and ability.\\n\\n Though their purity was directed at different things, Lee Shin Woo suddenly thought that in terms of innocence, she and Ye Jin Jin were quite similar. From right beside him, Jin then asked.\\n\\n \"Then what do I do...?\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about? You\u0027re the one who needs systematic instruction on magic. We\u0027re one plus one, remember?\"\\n\\n \"I knew this would happen...\"\\n\\n Even whilst complaining, Jin strangely felt moved that Lee Shin Woo was looking out for him. Seeing Jin, who\u0027d come into possession of such a twisted feeling, Kratia seemed to be concerned about something and her eyes brightened; she soon tilted her head and turned her attention to Lee Shin Woo.\\n\\n \"Then let\u0027s get going immediately. I want to know how your power works.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, wait. Didn\u0027t you want to learn about all that common knowledge you were missing?\"\\n\\n \"I can just hear that stuff with the time we have left over.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t reversing their priority. From the very beginning, her primary objective was magic. Lee Shin Woo thought he somewhat understood her personality, shrugged his shoulders, and with no alternatives, just began talking.\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo and Jin explained that they had a special contract, and using the resulting connection that came from using the Horseback Riding skill, could share their skills and resistances with each other; after hearing of this, it didn\u0027t take long before Kratia became disappointed.\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s fine. Since the way you use your mana is plenty interesting. There\u0027s a lot I can learn from your freewheeling style. The mana you\u0027ve accumulated is amazing, seeing as how you went from not knowing anything to this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m more jealous of the mana you\u0027ve accumulated, though...\"\\n\\n Contrary to Lee Shin Woo, who controlled the mana itself, Kratia had studied for countless years and ultimately, developed a special method of causing the mana to change.\\n\\n If he changed mana purely through his will and the skill\u0027s ability, Kratia calculated the countless ways in which the mana could change beforehand, and brought about the desired change at the right time. Lee Shin Woo\u0027s method of handling magic was clumsy in comparison.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the way of a magician. But it\u0027s not the way a knight uses mana either. To be specific, Shin Woo... you seem like a monster gifted with supernatural powers.\"\\n\\n \"...Isn\u0027t it because I\u0027m an undead?\"\\n\\n Lee Shin Woo flinched the moment she pointed that out, but he replied calmly for now. However, Kratia firmly shook her head.\\n\\n \"An undead being can\u0027t control this many mana patterns. You may even understand the essence of mana more than I do. If I can imitate even just a part of what you do, my magic could undergo a groundbreaking change...\"\\n\\n \"Shin Woo, I don\u0027t understand this at all.\"\\n\\n \"You just memorize everything for now. It\u0027ll come up in the test.\"\\n\\n He was able to make some strides. Kratia taught Lee Shin Woo the theory established by scholars and magicians on mana, and he was able to figure out how to more effectively handle his mana, which he\u0027d been manipulating instinctually up until now; on the other hand, Kratia got a hint on how to improve her magic by learning about Lee Shin Woo\u0027s skills and peculiar method of using magic, which went against common sense.\\n\\n \"Ah, so this is how you do it. Just by introducing a few basic patterns, I can apply my magic much faster than before.\"\\n\\n \"H-How did you learn that already?\"\\n\\n Ultimately, Lee Shin Woo was successfully able to make large strides in magic one week into his contract with Kratia. She thought if she taught him, it would be helpful to him someday, but he had advanced at a speed which went beyond her imagination.\\n\\n [The Low Rank Mana Bone skill has become Lv10, and evolves to the Intermediate level.

Magic has increased by 30.]\\n\\n [You have fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to achieve the Joker\u0027s innate skill. You have only one step left remaining before you become a true Joker.]\\n\\n And at that very moment... Lee Shin Woo got a message that he hadn\u0027t expected at all.\\n\\n [A quest has occurred!]\\n\\n [Joker\u0027s mana]\\n\\n [You are extremely free-spirited, and are capable of imitating anything.

Please acquire a high ranked administrative authority by copying a golem\u0027s mana.]\\n\\n [Quest reward - 3 permits to God\u0027s secret shop, Joker\u0027s innate skill]\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] T/N: Probably a loose Fate/Stay Night reference to the El-Melloi line of magicians.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-55","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
