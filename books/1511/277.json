Befitting one of the surface\u0027s Heavenly Commanders, he was able to hold out against the last remaining Heavenly Commander of the Underground Empire.\n Leofield likely possessed an artifact that tracked their movements, and so his subordinates attacked the Sun Spear General along with him, rather than follow the Vampire\u0027s main force. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head in satisfaction, as he checked what was happening through the Mana Radar.\n [No one else is chasing us anymore. Judika\u0027s holding them back.]\n \"That man... He\u0027ll die.\"\n [You don\u0027t know that.]\n \"Hmph. I guess it doesn\u0027t matter. I just hope he does his job properly.\"\n He strongly agreed with her, but he feigned indifference. The Light General changed topics, as she understood how he was feeling.\n \"...So.\"\n She didn\u0027t really care why the Sun Spear General had done what he did; after all, he, her biggest obstacle, got rid of himself on his own. She secretly formed a barrier so that her subordinates couldn\u0027t hear her and said.\n \"Do we really have to kill Seagald here?\"\n [We do. I believe I already explained it to you.]\n \"Did you? I\u0027m glad to see you haven\u0027t been idling around all these years.\"\n The previous day, Lee Shin Woo had acted surprised at the \u0027revelation\u0027 that Arema Steelworker\u0027s true body was gone (this was important) and conversed with the Light General. In the end, he decided to get his revenge.\n Despite that, he was still committed to killing Seagald, as Seagald\u0027s vengeance wasn\u0027t only aimed at the surface\u0027s \u0027Emperor\u0027.\n [He\u0027ll eventually ravage the surface. We can\u0027t drag innocent citizens into our affairs. We have to finish it here.]\n \"Ha. You still care so much for the people who have long since abandoned you, I see.\"\n [This world is nothing without humans.]\n Lee Shin Woo said and was momentarily silent. He took out what he\u0027d prepared while she was resting yesterday. It was an envelope.\n \"This is...?\"\n [Just in case I die.]\n \"I don\u0027t need it.\"\n [You\u0027ll need it. No... I want to entrust it to you.]\n \"Arema...\"\n Lee Shin Woo recalled writing a personal note for himself, yet a friend of his, who he thought was quite close, had revealed it to the entire school; he used that memory to help him put on a convincingly sad expression. His face became naturally tinged in betrayal and emptiness.\n Seeing that, Jin wondered whether or not it was ok for golems to have advanced so far. Lee Shin Woo just completely ignored her consternation and continued.\n [I know. The best case scenario is me getting through this battle alive. But if I can\u0027t return to the surface, then I hope you can do this in my stead. ...I\u0027d like you to prove that I existed.]\n \"This is...\"\n [You don\u0027t need to look at it now. If I die and your feelings haven\u0027t changed, then open it. There\u0027ll be people who can help you. There\u0027s someone I met on the surface... He\u0027s a hero, but he\u0027s trustworthy.]\n \"You...\"\n The Light General couldn\u0027t formulate a coherent response and just stared at Lee Shin Woo.\n However, Lee Shin Woo was acting exactly as Arema would, putting up a front that would work on Arema\u0027s past lover! And that woman, who had loved Arema so dearly, just bit her lip and accepted it.\n \"I won\u0027t let you die. I\u0027ll hold on to this envelope for you, but I\u0027ll never get a chance to open it.\"\n [...Hmph.]\n This time his \u0027hmph\u0027 meant \u0027You always say something that causes my resolve to waver\u0027. At this point, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s acting was so perfect that it was almost impossible to differentiate him from Arema.\n [Shin Woo, you\u0027ll definitely get an Oscar this year.]\n [I\u0027m in character right now, so be quiet.]\n [You\u0027re not even denying that you\u0027re from the surface now, are you?]\n Fortunately, his beautiful performance, which confused himself along with everyone else, would soon come to an end. After all, he started sensing traces of the Archmage and the Annihilation Flame Sword God close by.\n \u0027He really brought the rest of Anti-Skull with him. I\u0027m sure of it. He\u0027s definitely trying to end it here.\u0027\n Seagald was planning on bringing the Lich and the Emperor to his side no matter what. If that happened, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s forces wouldn\u0027t lose, but the already complicated situation would become even more complicated!\n \u0027But based on how it\u0027s going, we\u0027re actually at an advantage.\u0027\n Originally, Lee Shin Woo hadn\u0027t expected the Magic Emperor to send two of his Heavenly Commanders down. Moreover, to think he\u0027d be able to use one of them to hold off the underground Heavenly Commander, Leofield Von Tariman! Not only that, the Archmage wasn\u0027t staying next to the Emperor and was facing off against Seagald.\n \u0027Yeah, everything\u0027s perfect. I\u0027ll kill him here no matter what...!\u0027\n [Yeah, even if I have to die...]\n \"I told you to stop saying that!\"\n He instinctively muttered, and the Light General nervously yelled. He was supposed to add \u0027one or two times after it\u0027, but had deliberately omitted it. She obviously didn\u0027t know the truth.\n This kind of thing was important. He kept saying things that foreshadowed his death! So that if he did die, they could say \u0027it really felt like he was going to die\u0027!\n [Kuwaaaaaaah!]\n The closer they got to their destination, the louder the monsters\u0027 screams became. They were probably summoned by the Archmage himself.\n Had he been visiting the high level dungeons for that many years? Lee Shin Woo was speechless and tightened his fist. Surprisingly, his fist was covered in a blindingly bright golden mana... metal element mana!\n [You have learned the Lv1 High Rank Metal Element and Magic has increased by 100!]\n The gold element, or more specifically, the metal element. It was an element that could only be wielded by individuals with a metal body, and although it originated from the earth element, it was both stronger and tougher than its counterpart, almost resembling pure physical force.\n \"T-That\u0027s...!? Arema, you\u0027re finally able to wield an element on your own. And it\u0027s a never before seen element at that...!\"\n [I\u0027m leading the way, so it\u0027s only natural that I\u0027m the one who discovered it.]\n \"...You always did hide your own achievements. You really haven\u0027t changed at all.\"\n [Hmph.]\n While the element specialized in reinforcing metal, it was also possible to concentrate it and fire it off like a brute (like Arema).\n It satisfied both physical force and mana, and was a well-rounded element that increased one\u0027s attack and defense. And Lee Shin Woo was now able to replicate that extraordinary element...\n [When did you learn that element!? You didn\u0027t even absorb Arema\u0027s bones!]\n [I actually just learned it right now. I thought it wouldn\u0027t work. I tried recreating it by basing it off the earth element, but it turns out I could do it.]\n [It just turns out you can do it... It just turns out you can do it!?]\n He\u0027d tried to replicate the element, but had ended up learning it instead! Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t know this yet, but by acting as Arema Steelworker for the past few days, he was able to completely understand him, enabling him to use his element!\n [You are exceptionally talented in handling the Metal element. The High Rank Metal Element has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 60.]\n \u0027Hmm, so it starts off at high rank level 4, huh? Maybe Arema\u0027s was at this level too. Though his body was tough, he wasn\u0027t very good at handling an element...\u0027\n If Arema Steelworker\u0027s friends hadn\u0027t come down and forced him to concentrate entirely on acting, then this wouldn\u0027t have happened.\n It was such a relief that Arema Steelworker had wielded the Metal element. If Arema Steelworker had possessed an innate element, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn\u0027t have been able to replicate it so easily!\n Several coincidences had coincided, creating a miracle, and that miracle caused Lee Shin Woo to advance even further. It was truly a feat befitting a Joker.\n [Huaaaaaahp!]\n \u0027It\u0027s a good thing\u0027, he thought, and used his newly learned metal element to form a sphere and throw it.\n He increased his arm\u0027s physical strength to an abnormal level through the Manatization skill, causing the sphere to rush towards Seagald!\n [Keuk...!?]\n Seagald had sensed the distant projectile and tried evading it by erasing his entire presence, but he was facing off against none other than the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.\n The Archmage immediately froze the space around Seagald, so Seagald was unable to fully erase his presence. Ultimately, Seagald had lost his arm from the shoulder down. Lee Shin Woo inwardly tightened his fist and yelled \u0027Strike!\u0027. It was a perfect surprise attack, a perfect combination attack, and a perfect...\n \u0027It was a perfect dead ball, Shin Woo.\u0027\n [I came for revenge, Seagald!]\n Lee Shin Woo, like always, ignored Jin\u0027s retort and yelled boomingly! Seagald had belatedly freed himself from the time prison and retreated; he gripped his long sword with his still good hand and looked down at him. If looks could kill, then Lee Shin Woo would\u0027ve been torn in half by now.\n [Arema Steelworker...! After all that, you still didn\u0027t die...!?]\n [My body, which you so lovingly broke apart, still throbs! This isn\u0027t nearly enough, Seagald. I won\u0027t let you die quickly; I\u0027ll break your arms and legs and then kill you slowly...!]\n Seagald was genuinely angry. He\u0027d lost everything in Bayran, so that\u0027s why he could speak with such hatred! Hearing \u0027Arema\u0027s\u0027 retort, Seagald realized that he\u0027d made a mistake in Bayran.\n If he\u0027d finished off Arema in Bayran, then he wouldn\u0027t be in this situation where the surface had sent reinforcements!\n [And who is this? Aren\u0027t you Arema Steelworker!?]\n Several monsters were fighting off Anti-Skull, and the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin, who was holding his own against Seagald, recognized Lee Shin Woo as well. To be exact, he recognized Arema Steelworker. Lee Shin Woo yelled in a booming voice once more.\n [Lich, I have a lot I want to say to you, but let me tell you just one thing. Let\u0027s work together!]\n [Work together? You want me to work together with you, someone who rebelled against His Majesty, to fight against this dirty flame wielding bastard?]\n [Yeah.]\n Lee Shin Woo firmly nodded his head and continued.\n [We can settle things once he\u0027s dead. It\u0027d be easier for you to fight against me than Seagald, no?]\n [Ha, how entertaining. You led those dirty Vampires here, yet you want me to bury my head in the sand. I know you have an ulterior motive. I really...]\n The Lich smiled wickedly and swung his staff. At that moment, a massive buff was applied to the Vampires!\n [Like it! Fine, you rust bucket! Let\u0027s work together!]\n [Archmage, you fool...! You\u0027re abandoning me, who has His Majesty\u0027s best interests in mind, to join forces with the surface. What the hell is wrong with you!?]\n [Seagald Von Retadane, you fool.]\n The Archmage\u0027s staff was clad in darkness once more.\n [Try again once His Majesty forgets about that beam of light you shot at us!]\n So that\u0027s what they thought had happened. This was great! Yeah, now that he thought about it, the Archmage had retreated early on, so he didn\u0027t know who had shot the cannon; he mistakenly assumed that Anti-Skull was the one that had fired the cannon!\n [Didn\u0027t I tell you that it wasn\u0027t me!?]\n [Seagald, you bastard. How dare you lie in front of me, Arema Steelworker!?]\n \"Those that heed the Emperor\u0027s command; all forces, charge! Bury those lowly skeletons so that they can never look up at the sky!\"\n Lee Shin Woo charged, and the Light General followed him, leading the rest of the Vampires. This was a battle that would decide the very fate of the capital, yet the heroes weren\u0027t even involved!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-277","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
