During that time, Lee Shin Woo had run throughout the facility with Jin while activating his Assimilation skill so that they could match each other\u0027s senses; because of that, Lee Shin Woo was just about able to match Jin\u0027s dynamic visual acuity and reflexes, both of which stemmed from his agility. \u0027In terms of this, you\u0027re better than most level 7s.\u0027 \u0027But Rebellion increases my max stats during battle. I have to be able to adapt to that quickly.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s true.\u0027 Fighting back against their current illogical situation was enough for the Rebellion skill to activate, which would result in a stat increase. Now that the Rebellion skill was level 4, all his stats increased by 16%. This was the amount of stat increase that Lee Shin Woo was used to now. However, if he were to face more than 1,000 enemies, or a higher level enemy, his Rebellion skill would activate and increase his stats by another 16%, as well as an additional 11% due to the existence of a partner. His stats would increase by another 27%. Of course, that entire effect would be shared with his partner, so Jin would be reinforced equally. \u0027Mm, it should all work out. Anyway, my goal is to gather as much mana as possible to strengthen my body, as well as to unleash a powerful attack.\u0027 \u0027...Yeah, we can do it. I haven\u0027t been just sitting around all this time either.\u0027 No matter how strong the level 7 elites were, could they be stronger than Hansen Von Dorthe? Of course, it was scary that they had to fight against three level 7 elites at the same time, but Lee Shin Woo decided to trust Kratia. Prince, who was close to level 7, wasn’t very reliable, but he still took her into account too. Once they had finished up their training, Lee Shin Woo and Jin returned to the designated meeting place. Kratia and Rem had already returned and were waiting for them. \"Do you think it\u0027ll be ok?\" \"Yep.\" She responded confidently and stuck out her chest. Rem sat atop Kratia\u0027s shoulder with a similar pose. It seemed like they had formed a sense of kinship from collaborating for three days. \"A level 6 golem... A golem that pledges loyalty to a hero... A golem that can meddle with another golem\u0027s structure... A golem that doesn\u0027t even make any sense...\" \"You keep adding \u0027golem\u0027 to your sentences, Senior. Are you alright?\" \"Do I look ok to you? I\u0027m not in the right state of mind right now. I\u0027m scared of the training exercise, and I\u0027m even more scared of you.\" It seemed like she hadn\u0027t slept well, as there were large, dark circles under her eyes. Then again, it was right before D-Day, and she should\u0027ve just finished with her last minute training, so it was kind of obvious that she\u0027d be tired. \"As expected of you, Senior. It should\u0027ve been a hard decision to make, but you came to a decision all on your own.\" \"Hmph, I\u0027d rather die than be beaten by fledgling juniors!\" Lee Shin Woo decided to respect how Prince would do whatever it took to maintain her pride as a senior. Moreover, he was could tell that she hadn\u0027t stayed just because of her inferiority complex. Even if she attempted to not show any signs of it, Lee Shin Woo and Kratia could tell that Prince was worried about them. No... it was more accurate to say that she didn\u0027t want to see another \u0027hero\u0027 die. \"Then, let\u0027s get through this and get to level 7.\" \"How would I feel any better if you were to reach level 7 at the same time as me... Hmph, if you don\u0027t do it properly, then I\u0027ll teach you a lesson.\" Prince shared a few minor facts with him (she knew that he could somewhat control elemental power, and that Rem was his subordinate) and it seemed like she had given up on understanding him about half way. Despite that, it was cute that she still considered him a junior that she needed to look after. As he thought, she\u0027s a good person. He felt a bit sad that he couldn\u0027t tell her about him being an undead. \u0027Well, as long as she\u0027s a beautiful girl.\u0027 \u0027I told you, that\u0027s not how it is.\u0027 Jin reacted ridiculously and scorned him, but Lee Shin Woo asserted that it wasn\u0027t like that, and joined up with the group. Now there was nowhere to hide. It was time for them to finish this and clear the magic training facility that the Royal Magician Leader, Feotane Von Sledin, had put his heart and soul into. \"We\u0027re going in. Is everyone ready?\" \"Yeah.\" Lee Shin Woo checked that his six Breath of the Lightning Gods, two of which were in his hands, were fully charged, and replied. Seeing that, Prince trembled once more, but she didn\u0027t retort; it was as though she had given up. \"Good. I\u0027m all ready too. We need to get the drop on them. I\u0027m going to seize control of all the magic traps from the get go. Our enemies probably won\u0027t be restrained by the rules, so we shouldn\u0027t worry about them either.\" \"You\u0027re just going to destroy everything, aren\u0027t you.\" \"Yeah. So long as we can win that way.\" \"Defense... defense...\" If Lee Shin Woo\u0027s job was to fight against the monsters, and Kratia\u0027s job was to seize control of the magic traps, then Prince\u0027s job was right in the middle. Her job was to protect them against any unforeseen attacks, or from the magic traps that Kratia couldn\u0027t control. It definitely wasn\u0027t an easy task, but Prince steeled herself. If she couldn\u0027t do this, then she didn\u0027t deserve to reach level 7. \"Then... let\u0027s go in.\" \"Alright, let\u0027s go in together.\" They formed a single group and entered the building. Of course, once they entered, they were met by a vast environment that couldn\u0027t be called a building. And like Kratia had said, it seemed like the space was significantly reduced compared to the previous facilities. It was a forest lined with trees. The group was pressed down by the ridiculously dense concentration of mana, which made them unable to breathe for a moment. [Assessing atmosphere. Mana concentration at 1,876%.] \"Ha, haha...\" Prince breathed out unnecessarily at Rem\u0027s report. It would be hard to use magic when the concentration of mana was doubled, but 1,876% was ridiculous. Of course, if one were actually able to use magic in these conditions, then it would be quite an achievement, but if they were going to do that, then they wouldn\u0027t have to go through all the effort of adapting to this level of mana concentration! \u0027The mana concentration in the twenty-first facility was high as well. It wasn\u0027t this unbelievably high, but... I can still do it!\u0027 Prince gritted her teeth, and the moment she raised her level 4 fire spirit staff, a voice rang out throughout the vast but small space. [The training exercise will begin soon.] \"Don\u0027t listen to that thing anymore. Because it\u0027s already started.\" The voice rang out, as if to put their minds at ease, but Kratia curtly denied its validity. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had realized that as well. He had already felt it through his connection with Jin. The gaze of three fierce beasts looking right at them. Each of them were concealing their presences, but they couldn\u0027t hide from Jin’s senses. \u0027Jin, it may be a bit tough, but endure it. If it all goes to plan, then... we\u0027ll be able to win easily.\u0027 \u0027Alright. That\u0027s always how it is. I trust you.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo activated Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint simultaneously. The lightning was wilder than usual and enveloped both Lee Shin Woo and Jin in an instant; it was so dense that no one could see them from beyond the lightning. \"Keuk, Kuu.\" [Koo...] \"It\u0027s coming!\" Then, Lee Shin Woo heard the beast\u0027s subdued voice and directed Jin to run quickly. At the same time, Kratia’s orb gathered the ambient mana in the air, created a giant ice spear and shot it in Lee Shin Woo\u0027s direction! \"Run!\" \"Heuuuup!\u0027 Before the magic traps ahead of him activated, Kratia sucked out their mana, nullifying the traps, and simultaneously, attacked the first appearing level 7 with the ice spear. Its body, covered in crocodile skin and its saw-like teeth made it look like Godzilla. It was pretty small, but even Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t measure the mana it held within! [Lv7 Croc Eranta] [You are facing a higher leveled foe! Through the activation of the Rebellion skill, all stats increase by 16%. Due to your partner, which you share everything with, all stats increase by an additional 11%, and all of these effects are shared with your partner as well!] [Kahk!] The crocodile, which had assumed a charging position, suddenly stood upright and dodged the ice spear, but it couldn\u0027t dodge Lee Shin Woo\u0027s strike that came falling from the sky. It was a perfect combination attack with Kratia! \"Heup!\" [Kuuuu...!] \"Tch...!\" Despite taking Lee Shin Woo\u0027s strongest Bursting Thunder attack, all it did was utter a small cry. It was fundamentally different from monsters that thought that their voices needed to be loud to win, like the Metal Ape Chimera, or the Treasure Eater (the Shriek of the Dead). It truly was a beast that knew how to kill someone on the battlefield. It handled the damage from the attack (that came from the impact) differently than other monsters. \"Hoo...!\" [Kit!] Lee Shin Woo quickly led Jin and retreated. It charged at them with its sawteeth covered arm, but he shot the four Breath of Lightning Gods at it, which were standing by behind it. They probably wouldn\u0027t kill it, but they would temporarily stop it from doing anything! \"Hey, another one is coming!\" However, there was another monster coming at Lee Shin Woo, who was trying to land. It looked like a black leopard, but it was huge, and possessed eight legs covered in dragon scales. It charged, enveloped in magic that possessed as much destructive power as Lightning Sprint! [Lv7 Ur Leon] \"I knew you would come that wa...\" \"Shin Woo, there\u0027s a trap above you!\" The magic trap that hid in the air activated at just the right time. Kratia was facing off against the last remaining beast, so she couldn\u0027t cover Lee Shin Woo. Prince hurriedly conjured up fire magic and shot it at the beast\u0027s back, but it couldn\u0027t penetrate the beast\u0027s red magic armor! [Kyaat!] The monster ignored Prince and rushed towards Lee Shin Woo. It knew just who it needed to hunt down first! \"Heup!\" Of course, Lee Shin Woo wasn\u0027t someone to take lightly. The overwhelming ambient mana wasn\u0027t just reinforcing the magic traps and the beasts. Despite him just launching four of his weapons and blowing them up, he immediately summoned four more, threw them at the magic trap and exploded them. As if it were just a normal attack! \"Eat this!\" [Kuhwaaaaaaaahk!] Six Breath of the Lightning Gods blew up in succession, so the area was temporarily filled with lightning energy. Lee Shin Woo drew in all of that energy, successfully concentrated all of it into a single sword and lunged at the Ur Leon that followed him from behind. He obviously used Shadow Horn as well. Its destructive capability was truly fearful, as the attack was infused with mana 18x its normal concentration. [Kiiiii!] \"And blow up!\" Kwang! The sword that was deeply embedded in the black leopard\u0027s forehead blew up! Sparks spattered everywhere and hit both Lee Shin Woo and Jin, but because they were covered by Lightning Sprint\u0027s lightning, it actually strengthened them. That\u0027s right. Strengthened. Lee Shin Woo utilized his Absorb skill and drew all the lightning energy towards him. He was using the Absorb skill in earnest, as it would allow him to suck in the elemental energy of any element he could use. [Keut!] [Kihi!] Both the crocodile... the Croc Erantu, and the black leopard, Ur Leon, were struck by the lightning. They saw Lee Shin Woo, who absorbed the lightning energy that filled their surroundings in such a short time, and came to a common conclusion. The more time they gave him, the more of an advantage he had, as he would change more and more of the area\u0027s energy into one favorable to him! They momentarily swapped glances and soon began to move. However, Lee Shin Woo had already summoned another Breath of the Lightning God. \"You\u0027re too late!\" So long as Lee Shin Woo possessed the Bone Armory skill and the mana in which to use it, he could always replace the equipment that was destroyed. And in this environment, which was filled to the brim with mana, Lee Shin Woo had more of an advantage than anyone...! \"Kuaaaaaaaaaaah!\" The Croc Erantu shot out hundreds of teeth and attacked him, while the black leopard worked in tandem with it and stepped back. The moment Lee Shin Woo retreated, it would immediately attack him. They had good teamwork for beasts who usually fought against each other... \"Explode!\" Boom! This time, he blew up all six of his Breath of the Lightning Gods at once, and the lightning storm swept them away. The Croc Erantu\u0027s sawteeth were caught up in the lightning storm and fell to the floor. Jin then leapt over like lightning, and Lee Shin Woo, from atop him, summoned and shot a new Breath of the Lightning God from behind the black leopard and struck its head! [Ku... Kyaaaaaaahk!] The black leopard rampaged about and tried to strike Lee Shin Woo with his front leg, but he had already landed somewhere else. The bright yellow lightning that covered his body made him look as though he had become a lightning spirit. It was comparable to the speed he had when he had landed the final strike against the Metal Ape Chimera. \"Hoo, hoo...!\" \"How about it? Do you think you can do it?\" Jin asked briefly. Within the maelstrom of mana, Lee Shin Woo felt the necessary balance between Lightning Shadow and Lightning Sprint and smiled faintly. It had been 5 minutes since the battle had started, but it felt like his body would explode from absorbing and expelling so much mana. ...But despite that, there was also something that he\u0027d gained. \"Sure I can.\" Jin moved his body once more. In response, the crocodile and the black leopard moved to intercept them, but Jin gradually ran faster. As they gave chase, Lee Shin Woo summoned the Breath of the Lightning Gods everywhere and exploded them; like the name might imply, they breathed out a ton of lightning!
