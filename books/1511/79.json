It had the same vibe as the Anti-Skull secret facilities he\u0027d found. \"You\u0027re a disappointment, Gerrit.\" \"Senior...\" He could hear the two men\u0027s voices through his ears; one of their voices was familiar, and the other was unfamiliar. \"Senior Betadorn... Did you really have to go this far?\" \"It would\u0027ve been better had we had just taken it easy.\" At that moment, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s consciousness became clear. He quickly realized what kind of situation he was in, perhaps because this was his second time experiencing this. Hadn\u0027t he experienced something like this when he had absorbed the level 4 magician, Gerrit\u0027s bone? It was a playback of memories that came about due to Bone Reinforcement\u0027s resounding success! As he acquired the much too clear memories and experiences, he would feel a sense of unity with the bone\u0027s original owner, to the point that he felt one with them! \u0027Gerrit\u0027s here too.\u0027 Seeing the owner of a bone he\u0027d absorbed right before him was quite a strange sight. Moreover, it looked like Gerrit was heavily injured, causing his feelings to abate. The perpetrator was... the one whose consciousness he was inhabiting: Celon Von Betadorn. \"Take it easy... Senior, you don\u0027t understand the true nature of your research!\" \"You\u0027re the one who doesn\u0027t understand, Gerrit.\" Celon sighed, and drew his mana. He felt the immense mana saturating Celon\u0027s body whirl around him, increase in power, and focus into one hand. Eventually, what manifested in his hand was a high ranking magic, one which Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t understand at all! \"That, kuhahk!\" The moment light radiated from his fingertips, Gerrit wasn\u0027t even able to resist and fell to the floor, as if he had been bound. Perhaps it restricted both one’s body and mana, as Gerrit\u0027s mana peculiarly didn\u0027t respond thereafter. \"Senior! In the end... do you really have to go this far!?\" \"I hoped that I wouldn\u0027t have to kill one of my precious juniors... I\u0027ll ask you one last time.\" Celon\u0027s voice was ice cold. Lee Shin Woo could feel the torrent of mana that amassed in his palm so well that he trembled. He had felt this from Kratia as well, but his mana couldn\u0027t compare with that of a level 6 magician\u0027s. \"Tell me what you know about the Anti-Skull organization in detail. Who\u0027s in charge?\" \"Urgh, don\u0027t you already have an idea as to who... ugh!\" A portion of his mana extended like an arrow and severed one of Gerrit\u0027s arms. Celon\u0027s eyes were tinged with spite. \"You\u0027re missing the point, Gerrit. You\u0027re a magician.\" \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s missing the point, Senior.\" \"...Is that really what you think?\" \"Then can you really say you\u0027re not!?\" \"You fool...! You only think about yourself!\" It was only for a mere moment, but he felt Celon\u0027s eyes look upon Gerrit with an unbearable amount of loathing and contempt. Even whilst groaning in pain, he suddenly yelled at him. \"I\u0027m not the only one! You\u0027ll kill not just me, but the entire Empire itself! Everyone\u0027s crazy! Eternal life? That\u0027s just an illusion!\" \"We know that already! If it were that easy to attain, it wouldn\u0027t be eternal life!\" \"Then why!?\" \"...Hoo.\" Gerrit\u0027s throat was congested with blood. However, Celon wouldn\u0027t speak on Gerrit\u0027s terms any longer. Was it because he\u0027d decided that there was nothing he could gain from speaking to Gerrit? Once more, mana was concentrated within his hand. Unfortunately, the pattern he used to control his mana wasn\u0027t very different; however, experiencing his smooth and skilled technique of handling mana would help Lee Shin Woo for a long time to come. \"I didn\u0027t really need to get any information from you. I was just trying to give you an opportunity, as we were once alumni... You have only yourself to blame, Gerrit.\" \"You\u0027re making the wrong choice...\" Celon\u0027s magic shot in a straight line. The focus of such magic was to burn away the opponent\u0027s magic, and said magic would overpower the opponent with solely mana quantity. Obviously, Gerrit wasn\u0027t able to resist the spell and vanished; ultimately, only two bones that radiated light remained. \"This is... a keepsake of his teacher, huh. ...He sacrificed himself for the Empire. You respected him so much, yet you joined an organization like Anti-Skull...\" Celon mulled over whether he should incinerate the two bones, and ultimately, he decided against it and placed them within his breast pocket. Lee Shin Woo recollected that Gerrit had collected his teacher\u0027s bone, and had now realized something. \u0027I might\u0027ve already absorbed Gerrit\u0027s teacher\u0027s bone.\u0027 Lee Shin Woo\u0027s consciousness became dim after that final realization. Even till the very end, Celon was gripped by anger and a bitter regret. What exactly caused Celon to be so angry, and why did he agree to cooperate with the Emperor when he didn\u0027t think that eternal life was possible? Unfortunately, Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t find the answers to these questions and was dragged back to the present. Since it wasn\u0027t something he could know just yet. [You have become skilled in drawing your mana without any waste. The Intermediate Mana Bone skill has become Lv5, and mana has increased by 20. You have become able to more adeptly absorb the mana around you.] Celon Von Betadorn was definitely extremely talented. Since Lee Shin Woo’s Mana Bone skill, which had leveled up to level 4 from his exchange with Kratia, had leveled up again! However, Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t feel happy about that forever. Seeing Gerrit\u0027s death, as well as the confrontation between Anti-Skull and the researchers for eternal life caused him unease. Furthermore, everything that Celon had said had bothered him. At that very moment, a quest appeared, as if it understood him. [A quest has occurred!] [Anti-Skull\u0027s objective] [The horrific curse that came about due to the Emperor\u0027s struggle for eternal life. Anti-Skull did everything they could to stop it, but they ultimately failed. And you have successfully caught a few glimpses of their actions.] [However, that\u0027s not enough. Somewhere in the Empire, they\u0027re still waiting for their time to strike. Find a member of Anti-Skull who is an executive or higher to get closer to finding out the secret of the Empire.] [Quest rewards - 3 permits to God\u0027s secret shop, a corresponding amount of Perium] \"...It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve gotten a quest.\" This quest was incomparably vague compared to the quest he\u0027d begrudgingly accepted from God. Also, the words were cryptic. It didn\u0027t even tell him where the Anti-Skull members were located, nor did it tell him what to do once they met; it was a really unfriendly ending. He sported a sour expression as he looked over the quest again. Jin, who seemed done rolling on the floor, stood up, dusted himself off, walked over, and asked.. \"You got a quest, right?\" \"Yeah. So you\u0027re at the level now that you can sense this flow of mana, huh. I\u0027m proud of you.\" \"You know, that tone of yours kind of pisses me off...\" However, his abilities concerning magic were nothing compared to Lee Shin Woo\u0027s; plus, Lee Shin Woo was the reason he was able to increase his magic this far, so he couldn\u0027t really retort very strongly. Finding no alternative, Jin promised to get revenge by shaking like crazy once Lee Shin Woo rode on him next. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about it too much, as it\u0027s a quest that I can\u0027t really do anything about right now. This guy\u0027s more important than the quest right now.\" The secret to the Empire\u0027s curse? That\u0027s important. Anti-Skull? That\u0027s important too. Level 5 Intermediate Mana Bone? That\u0027s obviously important. However, he held something more important than all of those; it was the only level 7 elite bone that he\u0027d bought from the secret shop! \"When you think about it, that probably means that there aren\u0027t that many high leveled heroes.\" \"You told me that most heroes only hunt monsters that are a level lower than them. When you think about it that way, doesn\u0027t that mean that there\u0027s at least one level 8 hero?\" \"They told me that this bone entered the shops dozens of years ago.\" \"Ah...\" That meant that there weren\u0027t any level 8 heroes right now. Of course, Lee Shin Woo didn\u0027t approach the subject so simply. A level 8 hero may not have encountered a level 7 elite monster, they may have defeated it and a bone didn\u0027t drop, or they may have encountered a level 7 elite, but decided against fighting it, as they didn\u0027t think that there was any need to fight it... \"Well, this bone is what\u0027s important right now.\" \"I respect your bravery.\" Jin saluted him, as Lee Shin Woo was attempting to absorb a level 7 elite bone; it was already difficult to absorb a bone that was one level higher, yet he was absorbing a bone two levels higher. Seeing that, Lee Shin Woo chuckled and grabbed the Giant, Fenno\u0027s bone. Befitting a Giant, the bone was enormous; it was longer than the Drake Horn Lance. It was about 4 meters in length, was incredibly tough, and there was a horrific amount of mana concentrated within! \"My consciousness shouldn\u0027t get sucked in again, right?...\" Lee Shin Woo resolved himself and after calming himself down as much as possible, he executed Bone Reinforcement. At that moment, the shin bone broke apart into pieces and pervaded his entire body... not his shin! [The Giant, Fenno\u0027s shin bone reinforces your entire body. Strength has increased by 30, Health by 20, and Magic by 15. Absorbing a significant portion of the target\u0027s memories and experiences!] What a relief. He didn\u0027t get a playback of the Giant\u0027s memories. The Giant was much too detached and overpowering for Lee Shin Woo to share his senses with. Lee Shin Woo thought of it as watching a movie. Perhaps it was because it was a level 7 bone, but the memories within were almost completely intact when absorbed by Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo thought about the frightening product of a Giant\u0027s body and magic, and wondered whether it would be possible for him as well. \u0027A Giant\u0027s mana... Their bodies are built larger and sturdier, and this is probably some type of authority. I don\u0027t know what the basis for it is, but all of their mana is concentrated in reinforcing and enlarging their bodies, so I could say that there\u0027s a certain harmony between magic and body at work here...\u0027 A huge body saturated with overpowering mana; they would infuse these two powers into their weapons in their entirety and swing them. This was a Giant\u0027s power! Lee Shin Woo clearly memorized it all: the powerful flow of mana that whirled around their bodies, the properties of said mana, as well as the chemical process that occured as that mana touched the body. His body didn\u0027t even compare to a Giant\u0027s body, but he would at least be able to use that mana someday. [I am Fennos, a descendant of the Titans!] A descendant of the Titans. He didn\u0027t know what exactly that meant, but for some reason, that line was engraved deep within his mind. That memory was what finished the Bone Reinforcement. As well as... [Inheriting the will of a mortal who attempted to reach the realm of God. Low Rank Avenger has been terminated. You have acquired the special passive skill, Lv1 Rebellion. All stats have increased by 5.] \"...Huh?\" He\u0027d acquired a skill he hadn\u0027t expected at all.
