Arema Steelworker - 5\u003e\n For golems created by humans, loyalty to their master was paramount. The golems were also created for the purpose of protecting the Emperor.\n [However, the Emperor wasn\u0027t satisfied with just ordinary golems. He wanted them to think and move like a normal human being, while also being able to gain karma and grow. Aside from their unwavering loyalty, he wanted every aspect of them to be as close to a human being as possible. Because of that, we began our experiments. To create an absolute fighting force that was loyal only to the Emperor himself...]\n They sucked the Empire\u0027s precious resources dry, as well as the souls and magic of several young knights, and at the end of all those sacrifices, they succeeded in creating monsters; the Golden Army that originated from the Golden General, Arema Steelworker.\n [There are many who probably don\u0027t know about it. ...We lived much longer than the citizens of the Empire could\u0027ve imagined. But by the time the Emperor, who dreamt of immortality, created us, he was already old and decrepit.]\n \"Ha.\"\n The knights, whose human souls were combined with a golem\u0027s body, certainly were loyal to the Emperor alone, thought like humans, and were also beings who were capable of growth. Above all, they possessed strong bodies and magic, and were able to survive for such a long length of time. They were the best guards for the Emperor.\n \"The Emperor dreamt of eternal youth and immortality, yet he didn\u0027t think of becoming a golem himself?\"\n [There was a huge problem. Ultimately, we couldn\u0027t achieve a success rate of 100%.]\n \"Ah...\"\n The Emperor probably couldn\u0027t take that risk. Lee Shin Woo just laughed. He didn\u0027t plan on attempting to seriously verify Arema Steelworker\u0027s claims; but since he\u0027d become so immersed in his interesting story, he naturally became serious about it.\n It wasn\u0027t his intention, but it had a positive effect on the way Arema Steelworker treated Lee Shin Woo. Though Arema\u0027s face softened only slightly, it was enough.\n [I knew about the Emperor\u0027s desire for immortality, but because I had pledged absolute loyalty to the Emperor, I couldn\u0027t express any opinions regarding it. And ultimately, the day that horrific curse was completed... the Emperor became undead, and we were freed. Since the spell that restricted our free will didn\u0027t factor in the Emperor becoming an undead.]\n \"Then, what did you do after you were freed...?\"\n [I led my subordinates out of the capital and we hid here. The Emperor left me in charge of this place, and it was the only place where we could be safe. The Golem Production Facility.]\n They hid? That\u0027s what they decided to do once they\u0027d become free of the Emperor\u0027s control? Without even trying to fight once? Lee Shin Woo noticed that the conversation had taken a strange turn. After all, this was a bit different than what he\u0027d envisioned!\n [Aside from us, everyone else became undead, including the other generals who possessed a fighting force equal to mine. I couldn\u0027t win against all of them, and I didn\u0027t want to fight against them either.]\n \"Mm...!\"\n It was such a weak thing to say, compared to how imposing he seemed when they first met. He wanted to ask if he was weaker than General Seagald by any chance, but now wasn\u0027t the time to provoke him. While he was boiling up on the inside, Arema Steelworker cut in.\n [We\u0027ve lost our purpose. We have nothing left to direct our loyalty to, and just remain idle, slowly losing our free will over the passage of time. We\u0027re just souls who are unable to sleep, and live underground, gradually rusting away.]\n \"Hmm...\"\n [You, the undead who are able to resist the Empire\u0027s curse. I don\u0027t know who you are, or why you decided to bravely come here.]\n At some point, the conversation was coming to an end. Unexpectedly, Arema commended them, and spoke like this.\n [We\u0027ve lost our wills and we\u0027re just lingering dolls, so just leave us be and go back.]\n \"...\"\n That\u0027s a lie. Lee Shin Woo was absolutely sure of it when he heard that. He was a way higher level than him, but unfortunately, his acting was much worse than Lee Shin Woo\u0027s.\n It didn\u0027t matter whether he was a golem or not. It didn\u0027t matter if there were faults in his reasoning or not. His incredible intuition that developed with his Acting skill was telling him this. Arema Steelworker had different intentions, and he didn\u0027t want him to interfere, so he was trying to keep him out in advance!\n \"Not yet.\"\n [Hmm?]\n Lee Shin felt like it was time to use his winning move. Right now, concealing his identity or ascertaining their identity wasn\u0027t important compared to this. He decided that he\u0027d extracted all the information he could from them, and that there was still a chance to adjust their relationship!\n \"I have a request.\"\n Lee Shin Woo said courageously. As always, Arema Steelworker sported a smile, but he was a golem, so Lee Shin Woo couldn\u0027t trust his expression.\n [I was interested in your ability, so I called you here and spoke to you personally, but I can do nothing more for you. I cannot permit anything else. Go back. The next time you make a copy of that seal and use it to intrude, I won\u0027t just sit by and leave you be.]\n [Alright. If you\u0027re done talking, shall we go?]\n When Arema Steelworker finished softly, but firmly, Guillotine Steelworker approached them whilst emitting a turbulent spirit, as though he would execute them if they didn\u0027t listen.\n All he was doing was emitting mana from his entire body; despite that, Lee Shin Woo felt his body go stiff. He knew that he was no match for him.\n \"I have no intention of...!\"\n [Huh!?]\n However, Lee Shin Woo utilized Rule of Bone to its very limit, resisting the pressure, and yelled out. In order to achieve his primary objective of coming here!\n \"I have no intention of stepping into this place, so please allow us to continue using that train! We won\u0027t bother you, and we won\u0027t talk to you. We just want to ride that train to move around. If you allow us to use the train, we\u0027d like some information regarding the destination as well!\"\n [...]\n \"We\u0027re going to take care of the undead in the underground empire, and those trains will be really helpful in doing so. Ah, I\u0027ll also take care of the golems you\u0027re not using, too!]\n [You amazing bastard...]\n The unexpected request startled Arema Steelworker. Lee Shin Woo acted like he was asking for something trivial, yet it was actually an extremely brazen request; Guillotine Steelworker was astonished that he\u0027d ask for such a thing, and muttered. He may not look it, but he had made the request after planning everything out.\n [You truly are brave. Despite the difference in strength, you...]\n \"That\u0027s exactly why. We\u0027re nothing compared to you, so that\u0027s why we can speak to you like this. Since we\u0027re nobodies to you, and it won\u0027t hurt you to accept a request from some nobodies.\"\n [...]\n Regardless of what Arema Steelworker was thinking about, at the very least, Lee Shin Woo was sure that he was no longer under the Emperor\u0027s command. And though he wasn\u0027t moving proactively, he held no love for the curse that covered the Empire.\n In addition, Lee Shin Woo\u0027s intuition told him that based on those feelings, he had some kind of secret plan in the works. Figuring out their identity was likely to ascertain whether they would get in the way of said plan.\n \"Like I said, all I want is to be able to use the train!\"\n [Ha...]\n Lee Shin Woo was well aware of that, so that\u0027s why he made such a suggestion. He could roughly understand their situation, so he asked for a little bit of help, on the condition that they don\u0027t bother them. It wasn\u0027t a bad offer for them either, so he thought they\u0027d have no reason to refuse.\n But if they did refuse his offer? Then, they would just get the hell out. The idea of \u0027Try it. You have nothing to lose\u0027 had lead to this situation.\n [General, shall I take care of them?]\n [...No, they\u0027re interesting.]\n The moment Arema said that, Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled elatedly. It was exactly the response he\u0027d been hoping for. He\u0027d been acting desperately from the moment they met in order to retain that small \u0027favorable impression\u0027 that tinged his voice.\n [Fine. Do as he asks. I\u0027ll allow it, on the condition that you not leave the station.]\n \"Thank you very much.\"\n [General...]\n [Guillotine, I\u0027m ordering all the golems including you. From this point on, if those two enter headquarters, kill them without mercy. But if they don\u0027t, don\u0027t touch them.]\n [...I understand.]\n He seemed dissatisfied, but Guillotine complied obediently and nodded his head. He had no choice but to do so. Based on the flow of mana, it seemed like Guillotine didn\u0027t have any choice in the matter and that Arema was in control.\n Was the reason that a golem could become the master of the other golems due to the unnatural nature at which they lost connection with the original master? There was no way of knowing that right now.\n [I heard a lot from you, but I haven\u0027t heard your name yet.]\n Arema Steelworker said. The reason he hadn\u0027t asked for their names was because he didn\u0027t think they\u0027d see each other again. However, the fact that he\u0027d changed his mind and had asked for their names meant that Arema unconsciously thought that \u0027they might meet each other again\u0027.\n \"My name is Paul Zero.\"\n Lee Shin Woo replied in an overwhelmingly confident voice. He felt that it was a relief that they hadn\u0027t spoken each other\u0027s names once since they came here, and he lied in a situation where he didn\u0027t think he would.\n [Paul Zero... I\u0027ll remember that name. Along with your partner, that is.]\n \"You\u0027ll be able to hear about me from various parts of the Empire.\"\n [At the very least, your spirit is impressive. However, the fact that you possess the will to push forward, despite being in an undead body, leaves quite the impression on us. Go as far as you can.]\n He\u0027d lied until the very end, and the moment he\u0027d successfully tricked Arema, his Acting skill had unexpectedly leveled up again!\n [The Acting skill has become Lv9. Whenever you make a new personality, people suspect you of having multiple personalities.]\n Lee Shin Woo remained stiff, even after he\u0027d received permission to use the train, and dragged Jin through the corridor. Guillotine Steelworker sent them off. Perhaps it was because he\u0027d lied so perfectly, but Guillotine didn\u0027t treat Lee Shin Woo too badly.\n [Are there a lot of undead like you outside?]\n \"I\u0027ve met a few of them. They were partial successes from the Anti-Skull Project, though they degenerated into skeletons like me.\"\n [Hoh...]\n He was instinctively respectful to Arema Steelworker, but spoke comfortably with Guillotine like when they\u0027d first met. It might\u0027ve been because he\u0027d received an order from Arema, but he wasn\u0027t concerned with that.\n [On that day, I saw General Seagald\u0027s form and thought that perhaps... So it really was like that. From the very beginning, that guy was damn impressive...]\n \"As I thought, he maintained his reasoning as well?\"\n [Well, you did say that you were asleep following the experiment, so you\u0027d be unaware of that disastrous day. You\u0027re right. He was fighting against the Emperor even as an undead. I saw him being restrained by the other generals and him leaving the capital. We were able to leave by taking advantage of that commotion.]\n He\u0027d gotten a hold of some great information! Lee Shin Woo only nodded his head, without getting caught. Around that time, Jin, who\u0027d been \u0027frozen solid\u0027, slightly bumped Lee Shin Woo with his head. He was timidly complaining that Lee Shin Woo had dragged him all the way here and put him through all that.\n [Huh? Now that I think about it, didn\u0027t this guy talk a lot before?]\n \"He\u0027s too exhausted from putting up with the Golden General.\"\n [Well, it\u0027s true that the General\u0027s magic is considerable. Then how did you endure it? You were also able to obtain the general administrator\u0027s rights, so who exactly are...]\n At that very moment, the train arrived. Lee Shin Woo saw the door connecting the station platform and the passageway completely close and inwardly, slightly, very slightly, breathed a sigh of relief.\n He put in a lot of work to get everything to work out, but he couldn\u0027t believe that he\u0027d actually gotten what he wanted. Plus, his Acting skill had even grown! Lee Shin Woo trusted that today\u0027s deceit would bear fruit in the future.\n [Take it. It\u0027s the map for each supply line. You can do as you wish with the abandoned golems there.]\n \"Thanks.\"\n As expected, he was right; there was a map. From an outside view, it looked to be just an iron plate, but if he displayed the special mana pattern, the map would appear on top of the plate; it was a relief that it was the type of map that he could use with the general administrative rights.\n [Then I\u0027ll get going now. You better keep your promise. Since the General doesn\u0027t lie.]\n \"I don\u0027t lie either.\"\n He lied up until the very end and his trustworthy expression (his blazing red goblin fire) seemed to satisfy Guillotine, as he nodded his head and went back. Soon, they couldn\u0027t see him as he had gone through the passageway. Of course, this was still their territory, so they couldn\u0027t afford to be reckless.\n When the two were left alone, Lee Shin Woo activated the map and picked the place closest to the outskirts of the Empire, aside from where they had been before. That\u0027s because it was the easiest to handle.\n \"Alright. Then shall we go?\"\n \"...I\u0027m not dead yet, right?\"\n \"Of course you\u0027re not. We have so many golems left to kill, so you can\u0027t die on me now.\"\n \"You want me to fight again!?\"\n \"Be happy. When we go past there, I\u0027ll give you that (the Bone Original Core).\"\n \"I\u0027m not happy at all, you know!\"\n The two skeleton heroes unhesitatingly embarked on the train (golem) towards the southern outskirts of the Empire. Like he\u0027d learned from before, he didn\u0027t forget to hold on tight.\n The train departed right away. And so, Lee Shin Woo began his trip along the Empire\u0027s railway.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/stop-friendly-fire/sff-chapter-51","bookId":1511,"book":{"id":1511,"title":"Stop, Friendly Fire!","description":"The empire has turned into the land of the undead due to a spell gone wrong.
