{"id":30363,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. A RUN FROM HARWICH.","content":"One of the sailors, dripping wet, knelt beside him. \"That is all right, lad; you will be yourself again directly.\" Jack was already sufficiently recovered to sit up some time before either Bill or Joe showed signs of life; for, unable to swim or to take advantage of their momentary intervals of coming to the surface, they had become insensible some time before he had done so himself. The sailors rubbed their chests and hands, and at last both showed signs of returning animation. \"That was a close shave, Jack,\" the coast-guardsman who was at the helm said. \"It was lucky I made you out with my glass when I did. It was touch and go; I saw you trying to get them on their backs. If they had kept quiet you would have managed it; but drowning people never will keep quiet.\" They were now running up the Ray in pursuit of the boat, which had drifted into shallower water near the end of the island, and here the grapnel had brought it up. When they got up to it, the grapnel was raised and brought into the stern of the boat, and the coast-guard boat laid her course close-hauled for Leigh, towing the other behind her. Before they arrived at the slip the other two boys were both able to sit up. They would have taken their boat up beyond the village, but one of the[28] fishermen said, \"You go home and change; you have done quite enough for to-day. Tom and I will take the boat up for you.\" \"That has been a lesson to me I shall not forget,\" Bill said as they walked along. \"You saved our lives, Jack, there is not much doubt about that.\" \"Oh, I expect we should all have been fished out anyhow!\" Jack replied. \"No, we should not, Jack. Anyhow, not alive. I thought just at first you were going to keep us up pretty easy, and then young Joe twisted round and got hold of you, and we all went down together. But I could feel then that somehow you were keeping us up, and I tried not to catch hold of your legs.\" \"You did not, Bill. I was able to use them just at first, and then, somehow, Joe got hold of them. However, we all kept together, that was a good thing. If we had separated, I don\u0027t suppose they would have got us all.\" Fortunately the news of the danger Jack had run had not reached his mother, for she had been engaged in the back-room washing, and Lily had gone up to school. At the first alarm many people had run down to the shore; the officer of the coast-guard with his glass had reported what was going on, and up to the last moment it had been believed that the boat would get to them in time, and there had been a gasp of dismay as he suddenly exclaimed, \"They are down! The boat is only a few lengths away,\" he went on; \"I expect they will get them. One of the men is standing up in the bow ready to jump.\"[29] A half-minute later he exclaimed, \"There he goes! There, they are hoisting them into the boat!\" \"Have they got them all, sir?\" \"That I can\u0027t see; but I expect they have, for you see they have lowered the sail. Yes! they must have got them all, for none of them are standing up looking about, as they would be if one was missing.\" Five minutes later the sail was hoisted again. The officer watched for a minute or two, and then closed his glass. \"They are going up the Ray,\" he said, \"I expect they are going to tow the boat in here; she is under the island. They would not trouble about that unless those they have picked up were all right, but would be making straight back again to see what could be done for them.\" The little crowd, now feeling that nothing worse than a ducking had happened to those on the sand, broke up and scattered to their houses. No one had known at first what boat it was whose occupants had got into trouble, and it was not till it was half-way back that it was made out to be Corbett\u0027s. \"Why, I thought he was ill in bed?\" one said. \"So he is, but I expect his boys went out with it. It was not likely there was a man on board. No one but boys would be fools enough to get caught like that, and I should have thought Bill Corbett had too much sense.\" \"Why, Jack, what has happened?\" Mrs. Robson asked as her son entered the house. \"Nothing much, mother; but we have had a[30] ducking. There was a steamer aground on the Middle Ground, and watching her we forgot all about the tide, and the boat drifted away and we got caught. Of course I could swim, so there was no danger for me; but it would have gone hard with the two Corbetts if the sailor at the coast-guard station had not made us out, and their boat put off and picked us up.\" \"Well, go and change your clothes at once, Jack; it has taken all the colour out of your face. I will get a cup of hot tea ready for you by the time you come down.\" It was not until some of her neighbours came in, and talked to her about the narrow escape her son had had, that Mrs. Robson realized that Jack\u0027s life had been in considerable danger, and it was well that she had him before her enjoying his tea before she learnt the truth. \"It is no use getting into a fuss about it, mother,\" Jack said cheerfully; \"it is not going to happen again, you know. It has been a good lesson to me to keep my eyes open; and when I go cockling again I won\u0027t lose sight of the boat, not if there were twenty vessels ashore.\" A few days later Jack started with his uncle in the Bessy for Harwich. For himself he liked the life there better than at Leigh. At home men could not be said to live on board their boats. They went only for short trips, taking a meal before starting, and another on their return; but doing no cooking on board. Here they were out for longer hours, and the boat was always their home. They were more independent of the tide; and unless it and the wind[31] were both dead against them, could at all times run out to their fishing ground, ten miles away, near the Cork lightship. The fishing was various. Soles, whiting, and haddock were the principal fish brought up in the trawls; but there was occasionally a big skate or two in the net, and these had to be handled with considerable circumspection, as they could take off a finger or two with the greatest ease with their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. These fish were always hung up in the air for a day or two before eating, as the flesh improves by keeping; the eatable portions were then cut out, and the rest was thrown overboard. These fish were for the most part eaten by the crew; the small soles, dabs, and flounders were hawked in the town, and the rest of the take sent up to London. There was an excitement, too, in the fishing itself, apart from that connected with hauling up the trawl and examining its contents, for the sands off this coast are dangerous, and the wrecks, that have at one time or another taken place there, innumerable. Occasionally a net would catch in one of the timbers that had perhaps been lying there a hundred years or more, and then it either came up torn into fragments, or if it obtained a really firm hold, there was nothing for it but to cut the trawl-rope and lose it altogether. In fine weather, however, this step would not be taken except as a last resource. After trying in vain to get the net and trawl up the rope would be buoyed, and the next day another attempt would be made to raise the net, the boat being assisted by three or four others. The loss of a net was a[32] serious one, as it took ten pounds or more to replace it and the trawl-beam and its belongings. Sometimes a storm would blow up suddenly, and then the nets had to be got on board with all speed, and the topsails lowered and mainsails reefed, and the fleet of perhaps a hundred vessels would go racing back into Harwich, there to anchor just above the Guard, or under shelter of the Shotley Spit, or a short way up the Orwell, according to the direction of the wind. The hardest part of a Leigh fisherman\u0027s life Jack had not yet encountered, for boys are seldom taken stow-boating. Stow-boating is really sprat catching, and no one can exactly explain the meaning of the term. It is carried on in winter at the edge of the sands, far down at the mouth of the river. Boats are out for many days together, frequently in terrible seas, when the boat is more under than above the water. The work of getting up the net is heavy and exhausting, and for all this hardship and labour the reward is often exceedingly slight. Sometimes the sprats are abundant, and good pay is made; sometimes, when the winter accounts are balanced up, the crew find that their share will barely suffice to pay for their keep on board, and not a farthing is left for the support of their wives and children. Londoners who purchase sprats at an almost nominal price know but little of the hard struggle those who have caught them have to make ends meet. After fishing for a month, Ben Tripper said one Friday evening, \"We will run up to Leigh to-morrow and spend Sunday at home. I don\u0027t think we shall[33] lose much, for the weather looks bad, and I don\u0027t think there will be any fishing to-morrow.\" \"I am pretty sure there won\u0027t, Ben,\" his mate said. \"I think that it is going to blow really hard, and that we shall get wet jackets as we go up.\" \"We are accustomed to that,\" Tripper said carelessly. \"Anyhow, if it comes to blow too hard for us we can make for shelter into the Crouch or Black Water.\" \"Oh, we are all right as to that, Ben! It is not a question of wet jackets or sea that I am thinking of, only whether we are likely to drop anchor in the Ray to-morrow night. If I were sure of that I should not mind a dusting; but I would rather lie here quiet than have a regular day\u0027s heavy knocking about, and then have to run in to Burnham after all.\" \"So would I,\" Ben assented. \"If the wind comes from anywhere to the west of south it is no use thinking about it. It has been chopping and changing about to-day, and there is no saying which way it will come when it fairly makes up its mind about it; but I think from the look of the sky this evening that it is as likely to come from the north-east as not, and in that case I allow we shall make a good passage of it.\" \"Ay, that is right enough,\" Tom Hoskins assented. \"They say the run from Harwich Pier to Leigh has never been done yet by a Leigh bawley under six hours, though it has been pretty close several times. We have got the springs on now, and with the wind from the north-east we should run the six hours very close, if we didn\u0027t beat it. There are two or three of[34] them can go faster than the Bessy close-hauled, but running free I doubt if there is one can touch her.\" \"We will make a start at seven,\" Ben said. \"We shall take the last of the ebb down to Walton, and then catch the flood and have it at its full strength by the time we are opposite Clacton.\" Jack was delighted at the thought of spending a Sunday at home with his mother; but though it was not for him to give an opinion, he agreed with Tom Hoskins that they were likely to have a dusting on the way up. The sun had gone down angry and threatening; the stars could be only seen occasionally through driving masses of cloud, and even at her snug anchorage the Bessy was rolling heavily. Jack was out soon after dawn. There was a haze over sea and sky, and the wind was blowing strongly; it was from the north-west now, but Jack thought that it was likely to draw round to the quarter his uncle had predicted. \"There must be a heavy sea on now all the way from the Swin Middle to the Nore with the wind meeting a lee tide,\" he said to himself; \"but of course when the ebb is done it will smooth down a bit, and will be all right if the weather does not come on too thick. A fog is bad enough and a gale is bad enough, but when you get the two together I would rather be at home and in bed by a long way than on board the Bessy.\" \"Well, Jack, what do you make out of the weather?\" Ben Tripper asked, as he came out from the fo\u0027castle. \"It looks rather wild, uncle; but I think the wind is working round to the north of east, just as you thought it would last night.\"[35] \"Yes; I think it is,\" Ben said, surveying the sky. \"Well, get the fire alight at once, Jack, and get breakfast ready; we will have our meal before we start. We shall have enough to do when we are once under way. I will run down to the Naze anyhow, and then we shall see what it is like outside. If we don\u0027t like its looks we can pop back anyhow; and shall have lost nothing, for there is no shooting nets to-day, that is quite certain.\" The topmast was lowered, small jib and foresail got up, and two reefs put in the mainsail; then they began to get up the anchor. \"What! are you going up home, Tripper?\" shouted a man from the next boat. \"Ay, ay, lad!\" \"You will get your decks washed before you get to the Mouse!\" \"Do them good and save us trouble!\" Tripper shouted back. \"Tell the missis if you see her she may expect to see me next Saturday if the wind is right.\" Tripper threw up his arm to show he understood, and then lent his aid in getting up the anchor. \"Put up the helm, Jack; the anchor is free. That is enough. Keep her jib just full and no more till we have stowed all away here.\" When the chain was stowed below, and the anchor securely fastened, Tripper went aft and hauled in the main-sheet. \"Up with the foresail, Tom. That is it. You keep the tiller, Jack.\" The two men now proceeded to coil down all the ropes, and get everything ship-shape and tidy. By the time they had finished, Harwich was fairly behind them, and they were laying their[36] course a point or two outside the Naze, throwing the spray high each time the boat plunged into the short choppy sea. \"Nice place this, Jack,\" his uncle said. \"There is always a sea on the shallows if the wind is anywhere against tide. No wonder they call it the Rolling Ground. There, I will take the helm now. You had best get the compass up; I can\u0027t make out the point sometimes through the mist.\" An hour and a quarter from the time of getting up the anchor the Bessy was off the point. As soon as the ugly ledge of rocks running far out under water was weathered, Tripper put down the helm. \"Haul in the sheet, Tom. That is right; now the sail is over. Slack out—slack out all it will go; the wind is nearly dead aft. Ease off the jib-sheet, Jack. That is it. Now she is walking along.\" The motion was smooth and easy now. The waves were much higher than in the shelter of the bay, but they were running easily and regularly, in nearly the same line the boat was following. Coming up threateningly behind her, they lifted the stern high into the air, passing gently under her, hurrying her along as she was on the crest, and then passing on ahead and dropping her gently down into the hollow. \"I think she would stand a reef shaken out, uncle,\" Jack said. \"She has got quite enough on her, Jack, and is walking along at a grand pace. Always leave well alone, lad. The squalls come up very strong sometimes, and I would not carry as much sail as we have got if she were a cutter with a heavy boom.[37] As it is, we can brail it up at any moment if need be. We sha\u0027n\u0027t be long getting down off Clacton. Then you must keep a sharp look-out for the Spitway Buoy. It comes on very thick at times, and it is difficult to judge how far we are out. However, I think I know pretty well the direction it lies in, and can hit it to within a cable\u0027s length or so. I have found it many a time on a dark night, and am not likely to miss it now. It will take us an hour and a half or so from the time we pass Walton till we are up to the buoy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87057.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"简介： Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
