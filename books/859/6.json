{"id":30365,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. THE RESCUE.","content":"Jack was a good swimmer, but he had never swum in a sea like this. [47] \"If I raise my arms, uncle, pull in at once. If I see I cannot reach the spar I sha\u0027n\u0027t exhaust myself by going on, but shall come back and take a fresh start. Let me have plenty of rope.\" \"All right, Jack! we won\u0027t check you.\" Jack took a header, and swimming hard under water came up some distance from the boat. \"He will do it,\" Tom shouted in Ben\u0027s ear. \"He is nigh half-way between this and the rope already.\" It was, however, a more difficult task than it looked. Had the water been smooth it would have been easy for Jack to swim across the tide to the spar before he was swept below it, but he found at once that it was impossible to swim fast, so buffeted and tossed was he by the sea, while he was almost smothered by the spray carried by the wind to the top of the waves. He trod water for a moment with his back to the wind, took a deep breath, and then dived again. When he came up he was delighted to see that he was as near as possible in the line of the spar, which was towing but a few yards from him. He ceased swimming, and a moment later the tide swept him down upon it. He had before starting fastened a piece of lashing three feet long to the loop round his chest, and the moment he reached the spar he lashed this firmly round the rope, and passing one arm round the spar lifted the other above his head. In a moment he felt the strain of the rope round his chest, and this soon tightened above the water. But Jack felt that the strain of pulling not only him but the spar through the water might be too much for it, and rather than run the risk he again waved his hand,[48] and as soon as the line slacked he fastened it to the rope from the wreck, loosened the hitches round the spar and allowed the latter to float away. He was half drowned by the time he reached the side of the bawley, for he had been dragged in the teeth of the wind and tide, and each wave had swept clean over his head. THE RESCUE OF THE PASSENGERS FROM THE WRECK THE RESCUE OF THE PASSENGERS FROM THE WRECK At first those on board pulled but slowly, in order to enable him to swim over the top of the waves. But the force of the spray in his face was so great that he could not breathe, and he waved to them that they must draw him in at once. As soon as they understood him they pulled in the rope with a will, and more under than above the water he was brought to the side of the smack and lifted on board, the wind bringing down the sound of a cheer from those on board the wreck as he was got out of the water. Ben undid the line round his body, carried him downstairs, wrapped a couple of blankets round him and laid him down on the lockers, and then ran upstairs to assist Tom, who had carried the line forward and was already hauling it in. \"That is right, Tom. They have got a good strong hawser on it, I see, and there is a light line coming with it to carry the slings.\" As soon as the end of the hawser came on board it was fastened to the mast. The line by which it had been hauled in was unfastened and tied to that looped round the hawser, and payed out as those on the deck hauled on it. A minute later two sailors got over the bulwarks, and a woman was lifted over to them and placed in the strong sling beneath the[49] hawser. A lashing was put round her, and then they waved their hands and the fishermen hauled on the line. In two minutes the woman was on the deck of the smack; the lashing was unfastened and knotted on to the sling ready for the next passenger, then at Ben\u0027s signal that all was ready those on board the wreck hauled the sling back again. Jack remained between the blankets for a minute or two. He had not lost consciousness; and as soon as his breath came he jumped up, gave himself a rub with the blanket, slipped into some dry clothes, and was on deck just as the woman arrived. She was all but insensible, and directly the sling had started on its return journey Ben carried her on into the fo\u0027castle. \"Jack! set to work and make a lot of cocoa. There are no spirits on board; but cocoa is better, after all. Put the other kettle on and chuck plenty of wood upon the fire, and as soon as the one that is boiling now is empty, fill that up again. I should say there are twenty or thirty of them, and a pint apiece will not be too much. Take a drink yourself, lad, as soon as you have made it. You want it as much as they do.\" Fast the shipwrecked people came along the line. There was not a moment to lose, for the wreck was breaking up fast, and every sea brought floating timbers past the bawley. \"It is a good job now, Tom, that we anchored where we did, instead of in the direct line of the tide, for one of those timbers would stave a hole in her bow as if she were a bandbox.\" [50] \"Aye, that it would, Ben. I thought we had made rather a mess of it at first; but it is well that, as you say, we ain\u0027t in the line of the drift.\" Nineteen persons were brought on board—the captain being the last to come along the line. The first four were women, or rather, the first two were women; the third a girl of ten years old, and the fourth a woman. Then came a middle-aged man, evidently a passenger. Then came ten sailors, a steward, two mates, and the captain. \"Is that all?\" Ben asked as the captain stepped from the slings. \"I am the last,\" the captain said. \"Thank God all are saved who were left on board when you came in sight. We all owe our lives to you and your men. I had little hope that one of us would live to see the night when we made you out coming towards us. But there is no time to talk. The ship cannot hold together many minutes longer, and when she breaks up in earnest some of the timbers will be sure to come this way.\" \"I have got the buoy with a length of rope on the chain ready to slip,\" Ben said, \"and a spar lashed to the hawser. Now, Tom, let the chain out; I will jump below and knock out the shackle. Now, captain, if one or two of your men will lend us a hand to get up some canvas, we shall be out of it all the sooner. And please get them all except the women out of the cabin, and put them aft. We want her head well up for running before this sea.\" \"Now, lads, tumble out and lend a hand,\" the captain said. \"I see you have got some cocoa here. Well, all who have had a mug come out at once, and[51] let the others get aft as soon as they have had their share. The ladies are all right, I hope?\" \"Quite right, captain,\" one of the men answered, \"and begin to feel warm already; which is natural enough, for this cabin is like an oven after the deck of the Petrel.\" \"Now, skipper, do you give the orders,\" the captain said as Ben took the tiller. \"Run up the foresail and haul in the starboard-sheet. That will bring her head round.\" \"Now let go the cable and hawser.\" There was a sharp rattle of chains, and the cry \"All free!\" \"Slack off that weather-sheet and haul down on the lee-sheet,\" was Tripper\u0027s next order. \"Not too much. Have you got the jib hooked on to the traveller? Out with it, then. Now, up with her. Now man the throat and peak halliards. Up with her. Slack out the main-sheet well, and boom the sail out with an oar. Trice the main-tack up as far as it will go.\" The Bessy was now running almost before the wind. Every moment the great waves loomed up high behind her stern, and looked as if they would dash down upon her deck, but she slipped easily away. The clouds had broken up much now, but the wind had in no way abated. A gleam or two of sunlight made its way through the rifts of the clouds, and threw light green patches upon the gray and angry sea. \"She is a splendid sea-boat this of yours,\" the captain said. \"I would hardly have believed such a small craft would have made such good weather in such a sea.\"[52] \"There are few boats will beat a bawley,\" Ben said. \"Well handled, they will live through pretty near anything.\" \"I can quite believe that. Which of you was it who sprang overboard to get our line?\" \"It was not either of us,\" Ben said. \"Neither Tom nor I can swim a stroke. It was my nephew Jack—that lad who has just come out of the fo\u0027castle.\" \"It was a gallant action,\" the captain said. \"I should have thought it well-nigh impossible to swim in such broken water. I was astonished when I saw him leap overboard.\" \"He saw that the spar had drifted with the tide to windward of you and there was no other way of getting at it.\" \"I was in hopes of seeing you throw the lead-line over our line. You might have hauled it in that way.\" \"So we might,\" Ben agreed, \"if we had thought of it, though I doubt whether we could have cast it so far. Still we ought to have tried. That was a stupid trick, to be sure. I allow I should have thought of it any other time; but we had had such a dusting in getting up to you that our brains must have gone wool-gathering.\" \"One cannot think of everything,\" the captain said. \"You had your hands full as it was. Is there anything else I can do at present? If not, I will just go below for a minute and see how my wife and the passengers are getting on, and have a cup of that cocoa, if there is any left.\" They were now in the Knob Channel, and the sea, although still heavy, was more regular. As they passed the Mouse Light-ship there were several[53] large steamers at anchor there, but it was now a straight run down to the Nore and they held on. Ben Tripper had already asked the captain where he would like to be landed. \"I can put you either into Sheerness, Southend, or Leigh,\" he said. \"Tide is high now, and you can land at any of them without difficulty. But you would get more quickly up to town from Southend or Leigh; and I should recommend our side, because tide will be running out from the Medway pretty strong before we get there, and when that is the case there is a nasty sea at the mouth.\" \"I think we cannot do better than Leigh,\" the captain said. \"Of course I am anxious to get on shore as soon as I can to get the women into dry clothes.\" \"It will not make more than twenty minutes\u0027 difference whether you land at Leigh or Southend; and it is much handier for landing at Leigh, and no distance to the inn, where they can get between blankets while their things are being dried.\" \"Then Leigh let it be. A few minutes will make no difference one way or the other, and if they have not caught cold already they will not do so in that warm cabin.\" The wind was blowing far too strongly to admit of conversation, except in shouted sentences. Fortunately there was a good supply of tobacco on board, and the rescued sailors, who had almost all a pipe in their pockets, had, after the smack was once clear of the broken water, enjoyed the consolation of a smoke. Accustomed to look down on the water from the[54] high deck of a large ship, they had at first felt some doubt as to the ability of the low bawley to struggle safely through the towering waves; but as soon as they saw how well she behaved, and how little water she took over the sides, they felt that all danger was over, and became disposed to look at things more cheerfully. The steward had, as soon as he came on board, relieved Jack of his duties at the galley, and had kept the kettles going; he now served out a second supply of cocoa all round, and hung up as many of the ladies\u0027 things as they could dispense with round the fire to dry. The passenger had remained below with the ladies. He was suffering from a broken leg, having been knocked down and swept along by the sea soon after the vessel struck. Six of the sailors and two of the mates had either been washed overboard or crushed to death when the masts went over the side. As they passed the Nore a perfect fleet of steamers and sailing-vessels were at anchor there. Tide had turned strongly now, and there was a nasty heavy choppy sea until the Bessy passed the end of Southend Pier, when she entered comparatively smooth water. In less than half an hour the sails were lowered, and she anchored some fifty yards from the coast-guard station. The look-out there had already observed the number of people on her deck, and had guessed at once that she had taken the crew off a wreck of some kind, and as soon as the anchor was dropped their boat came alongside. The captain had as they neared the shore asked[55] Tripper about inns, and at once sent the crew ashore in charge of the mate, with orders to go to the \"Bell,\" and to see that they had everything they required, saying that he would himself, as soon as the ladies were on shore, go to one of the shops and order a supply of clothes to be sent up for them. The ladies were next taken ashore, and then the injured man carried up and placed in a boat, a stretcher being sent off for him to be laid on. A messenger had been already sent up to the doctor on the top of the hill to come down to the Ship Inn, where the party now went. The ladies had become so thoroughly warmed by the heat in the little cabin that they declined to go to bed, and having been supplied with dry garments by the landlady, they were soon comfortable. The surgeon on his arrival pronounced the fracture of the passenger\u0027s leg, which was a few inches above the ankle, to be a simple one, and not likely to be attended with any serious consequences whatever. After setting it he bandaged it in splints, and said that although he should recommend a few days\u0027 perfect quiet, there was no actual reason why the patient should not be taken up to London if he particularly wished it. Ben Tripper had gone with the captain, and a pile of flannel shirts, stockings, guernseys, trousers, and shoes had at once been sent up to the \"Bell.\" Furious as was the gale, it was possible to speak so as to be heard in the street of Leigh, and Ben now learned for the first time some particulars about the wreck. \"The Petrel was a seven hundred ton ship,\" the[56] captain said, \"and on her way home from Australia. She belongs to James Godstone \u0026 Son. There is no James Godstone now. The son is the passenger you saved; he is the owner of a dozen vessels all about the same size as the Petrel. His wife and daughter are two of the ladies saved. They went out with us to Australia. The girl was not strong, and had been recommended a sea voyage. \"I had been married when I was at home last time, and was taking my wife out with me; so Mr. Godstone arranged that his wife and daughter should go with me. We carried no other passengers; the other woman saved is the stewardess. Mr. Godstone himself did not go out with us, but went across by Suez and joined us there for the homeward voyage. We made a fine run home; and took our pilot on board off Deal. The gale was blowing up then; but as it looked as if it was coming from the north-east we did not care about riding it out in the Downs, or going back so as to be under shelter of the South Foreland. \"It did not come on really heavy till we were nearly off Margate, and then we got it with a vengeance. Still, as the wind was free, we kept on. Then, as you know, it came on almost pitch dark, and I think the pilot lost his head. Anyhow, as he was one of those who were drowned, we need not say whether he was to blame or not. I thought we were getting too close to the broken water, and told him so, but he said we were all right. He didn\u0027t make allowance enough, I think, for the leeway she was making, and a minute later she struck, and you can guess the rest. Her back broke[57] in a few minutes, and her mizzen went over the side, carrying with it the pilot, my first mate, and six sailors. \"She soon after began to break up at the stern. I cut away the other two masts to relieve her, but the sea made a clear breach over her. I got the ladies and Mr. Godstone, who had been on deck when she struck and got his leg broken by the first sea which pooped her, forward as soon as I could, and managed to fire one of her guns three times. I had no hope of rescue coming from shore, but there was a chance of some ship coming up helping us; though how she was to do it I could not see. However, nothing came near until I saw your sail. I expect that any steamers coming up from the south brought up under the Foreland, while those from the north would of course take the Swin. Anyhow, it would have been all over with us had you not come to our rescue. Even when I saw you making over towards us I had not much hope, for I did not see how you could get close enough to us to aid us, and I was quite sure that no open boat could have lived in that broken water.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87059.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"简介： Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
