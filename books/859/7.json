{"id":30366,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. ALTERED PROSPECTS.","content":"As soon as the shipwrecked crew were on shore, Jack Robson landed and made his way homeward. At the railway-crossing he met his mother hurrying down, for the news that the Bessy had arrived with a[58] number of shipwrecked people had spread rapidly through the place. \"Well, Jack, so I hear the Bessy has been helping a wreck. I had no idea that you would be home to-day. What in the world induced your uncle to make the run in such weather as this?\" \"It was nothing like so bad when we started, mother, and as we had both wind and tide with us there was nothing to fear for the Bessy. We are accustomed to wet jackets, and should have got nothing worse if it had not been for our hearing guns and making for the wreck. Then we certainly had a tremendous sea, the heaviest I have ever been out in. However, we were under storm-sails and did very well. It was nasty work when we anchored in broken water near the wreck, and she jumped about so I thought the mast would have gone. However, everything held, and we managed to save nineteen people from the wreck. That is a pleasant thought, mother, and I would go through it again twenty times to do it.\" By this time they had reached the door of the house. \"There, run upstairs and change, Jack. I will get you some tea ready by the time you come down.\" \"I have had some hot cocoa, mother, and am as right as possible. Still, I shall not object to a cup of tea and something to eat with it. We had breakfast before we started at eight, and it is seven now. We thought when we hoisted sail we should be down here under the six hours, but of course going off to the wreck made all the difference. And, anyhow, we could not have driven her fast in such a sea.\" By the time Jack had had his tea a comfortable[59] glow had come over him. Now that it was all over he felt bruised and stiff from the buffeting he had gone through, and after half an hour\u0027s chat with his mother and sister, in which he told them more fully the events of the wreck, he turned into bed and slept soundly till the morning. Captain Murchison, for that was his name, came round half an hour after Jack had gone up to bed to ask him to go round to the inn, as the ladies wished to see him and thank him for his share in rescuing them, but on hearing that he had gone up to bed asked his mother to request him to come round in the morning at ten o\u0027clock. \"You have reason to be proud of your son, Mrs. Robson,\" he said. \"His leaping over in such a sea as that to get hold of the line from our ship was a most gallant action.\" \"He told me the line was tied round him, sir, so that there was no danger in it at all.\" \"There is always danger in such a business as that, Mrs. Robson. The force of the waves in shallow water is tremendous, and will beat a man to death if they do not drown him. Then there is the difficulty of his getting on board again when a vessel is rolling and pitching so tremendously, and the danger of his being struck by a piece of drift-wood from the wreck. I can assure you that it was a very grand action, whatever your son may have told you about it.\" The next morning the gale was still blowing fiercely, although with less strength than on the previous day. Jack had heard from his mother of his appointment to go to the \"Ship\" with much discontent, and had at first positively refused to go.[60] \"I hate going up to see strange people, mother, anyhow; and I am sure that I do not want to be thanked. I am glad enough to have had a share in saving all their lives, but of course it was all Uncle Ben and Tom\u0027s handling the boat that did it; I had nothing to do with it whatever, except that little swim with the rope tied safely round me. Why, it was nothing to that affair that I had with Bill and Joe Corbett.\" \"But you must go, Jack; the ladies naturally wish to thank you for what you did for them, and whether you like it or not you must go. It would be very rude and uncivil not to do so. They would be sure to send round here if you did not come, and what should I say except that you were so unmannerly that you would not go.\" Jack twisted himself on his chair uncomfortably. \"I don\u0027t see why they shouldn\u0027t thank Uncle Ben for the lot and have done with it,\" he grumbled. \"It is his boat and he was the skipper, and he did it all; besides, I expect the Bessy will have to be overhauled before she goes out again. She came down with a tremendous crash on her forefoot, and the water was just coming up through the boards in the fo\u0027castle when we came in. Of course it may have come in from above, but I expect she sprang a leak somewhere forward. I thought she was very low in the water when she came in, and I expect that she must have been half full aft, for she was very much down by the stern. \"We had the pump going all the time, and it was always clear water. I did not think of it at the time. We had had such a lot of water over us[61] it was likely it might have got in through the hatches; but I feel sure now that it was a leak. Well, I suppose if I must go, I must, mother; but I hate it for all that.\" However, just before Jack was about to start there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Robson opening it saw two ladies and a girl. Immediately on their arrival the evening before, Mrs. Godstone had telegraphed home for a servant to come down in the morning by the first train, with clothes for herself and daughter, and she had arrived with them an hour before. Mrs. Godstone had therefore been enabled to resume her usual attire, and to lend an outfit to Mrs. Murchison. Jack did not in the least recognize in the three ladies the soaked and draggled women, of whose faces he had caught but a slight glimpse on the previous day. \"We have come round, Mrs. Robson,\" Mrs. Godstone began, \"to thank your son for his share in saving our lives yesterday. We thought that it would be more pleasant to him than coming round to us at the inn.\" \"Thank you, madam,\" Mrs. Robson replied. \"It was kind of you to think of it. I have had a good deal of trouble in persuading Jack to go round. He was just starting; but it was very much against the grain, I can assure you. Come in, please.\" Mrs. Godstone was surprised at the tone in which this fisher lad\u0027s mother spoke, for during her thirteen years of married life Bessy Robson had lost the Essex dialect, and acquired the manners of her husband\u0027s friends. She was still more surprised at the pretty furniture of the room, which was tastefully[62] decorated, and the walls hung with pictures of marine subjects, for Bessy had brought down bodily her belongings from Dulwich. Mrs. Godstone at once walked up to Jack with outstretched hand. \"I hope you are none the worse for your exertions of yesterday,\" she said. \"My daughter and I have come round to thank you for the very great service you rendered us.\" Mrs. Murchison and Mildred Godstone also shook hands with Jack. The former added her thanks to Mrs. Godstone\u0027s. Jack coloured up hotly and said, \"It is my uncle you have to thank, ma\u0027am. It was his bawley, and he and Tom sailed it, and I had nothing to do with it one way or the other.\" \"Except when you swam out for the line,\" Mrs. Godstone said smiling. \"I had one tied round me, and was all right,\" Jack protested. \"My husband does not think it was nothing, as you seem to consider,\" Mrs. Murchison said; \"and as he has been a sailor all his life he ought to know. He says that it was a very gallant action in such a sea as that, and, you see, we are bound to believe him.\" The ladies had now taken seats. Mrs. Godstone felt a little at a loss. Had Jack\u0027s home and Jack\u0027s mother been what they had expected to find them the matter would have been simple enough, but she felt at once that any talk of reward for the service Jack had rendered them would be at present impossible. \"What a pretty room you have got, Mrs. Robson, and what charming pictures!\"[63] \"They are my husband\u0027s painting,\" Mrs. Robson said quietly. \"He was an artist.\" \"Oh! I know the name,\" Mrs. Godstone said. \"I have four of Mr. Robson\u0027s pictures in my drawing-room. I am very fond of marine subjects.\" This served as an introduction, and for half an hour the conversation proceeded briskly. Then Mrs. Godstone rose. \"My husband\u0027s leg is very painful this morning,\" she said, \"and I fear that he will have to keep his bed for the next two or three days. When he is well enough to lie down on the sofa I will come down and fetch your son, for Mr. Godstone is of course anxious to see him, and I am afraid that if I do not come round myself we shall not get Jack to the inn.\" \"Well, that was not so very bad, was it, Jack?\" Mrs. Robson asked after her visitors had left. \"No, mother, it wasn\u0027t. You see, it was ever so much better their coming here than it would have been if I had gone to the inn, because there was you for them to talk to, so that really there was not much said to me. If it had been at the inn there would have been nothing to talk about at all, except about the wreck. Well, now that is over I will go down and see how the bawley is; but I had best change my things first. Uncle was going to get her up as high as he could at the top of the tide, so as to be able to look at her keel.\" Jack found that his uncle and Tom had turned out at three o\u0027clock in the morning, and had got the Bessy as high up as possible on the sloping shore, just beyond the houses. They were standing beside her[64] now, while Benting, the local boat-builder, was examining her bottom. \"Well, Jack, you have taken it out in sleep this morning,\" his uncle said. \"That I have, uncle. I never woke until eight o\u0027clock, so I had just twelve hours\u0027 sleep.\" \"Nothing like a good sleep, Jack, when you have had a hard day\u0027s work; and yesterday was enough to take it out of anyone.\" \"Is she damaged at all?\" Jack asked. \"Yes, her forefoot is sprung just where it joins the keel; she came down just on the joint.\" \"That will be a rather nasty job to get right, won\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, Jack, Benting says she must have a new stem altogether. He does not think the keel is damaged, but the stem is cracked right through.\" \"That will cost a lot, won\u0027t it?\" Jack said. \"Yes, it is a nasty job, Jack; because, of course, she will want a lot of fresh planks in her. In fact, she will want pretty well rebuilding forward of the mast.\" \"It will cost about twenty pounds to make a good job of it,\" Benting said as he joined them. \"I shouldn\u0027t like to take the job for less, not on contract. If I did day-work it might come to a little less or a little more, I cannot say.\" Jack looked anxiously up into his uncle\u0027s face, for he knew that twenty pounds was a serious matter. \"It won\u0027t be at my expense, Jack,\" Ben replied to his look. \"Captain Murchison came down at seven o\u0027clock this morning and had a look at her [65]with me. I told him yesterday that I was afraid she had damaged herself on the sand, as she had made a lot of water on her way up. He said that I was to have her examined at once and get an estimate for repairing her thoroughly, and that he would undertake it should be paid. He asked what her age was. Of course I told him she was only four years old, and that I had only finished paying off the money I borrowed when I had her built, last year. He said that as she was only four years old she was worth spending the money on; but if she had been an old boat, it would not have been worth while throwing money away on her. But Benting says he can make her as good as new again.\" \"Every bit,\" the carpenter said. \"She will be just as strong as she was on the day she was turned out.\" \"How long will you be about it?\" \"I would get her done in three weeks. I will go over to Southend by the twelve o\u0027clock train and order the timber, and you can arrange this evening whether you will have her done by contract or day-work.\" Captain Murchison that evening when he returned from town, where he had gone up to report to Lloyd\u0027s the loss of the ship, had a talk with Benting, and being assured by him that the Bessy would after the execution of the repairs be in all respects as stout a craft as before, arranged with him to do it for the sum he named, and to set to work immediately. Three days later Mr. Godstone was able to be brought out on to the sofa in the sitting-room. Captain and Mrs. Murchison had gone home two[66] days before, but the former came down again to Leigh on the morning Mr. Godstone got up. After a talk together Captain Murchison went out and fetched Ben Tripper in, and Mr. Godstone presented him with a cheque for a hundred pounds for himself and fifty for Tom Hoskins. \"We owe you our lives,\" he said, \"and we shall never forget the service you have rendered us. Captain Murchison tells me that your boat will be as good as before after she is repaired; but if she should not be so, sell her at once for what you can get for her and order a new one, I will pay the difference. In any case I consider I owe you a boat. Whether it is five years hence or ten or fifteen, if I am alive and you want another boat I give you authority to order one of the best that can be built, and to tell them to send the bill in to me. I have not given you anything for your nephew, for I have been talking to my wife, and maybe we can serve him better in some other way.\" Mrs. Godstone had indeed been in for a chat each day with Jack\u0027s mother, and had told her husband that she felt sure neither Mrs. Robson nor Jack would like an offer of money. \"The lad is very intelligent,\" she said, \"and he and his mother are of quite a different class to the fisher people here. His father was a gentleman, and she has the manners of a lady. I should like for us to do the boy some permanent good, William.\" \"Well, we will see about it, my dear,\" her husband had said. \"As soon as I am well enough to talk to him I will find out what his own wishes in the matter are.\"[67] Jack was therefore sent for after his uncle had left the inn. \"Well, my lad,\" Mr. Godstone said as he entered, \"I am glad to see you at last and to thank you for what you did for us the other day. My wife tells me that you do not like being thanked, and as deeds are better than words we won\u0027t say much more about it. So I hear you have only been living here about two years?\" \"That is all, sir; we lived at Dulwich before.\" \"So I hear. And your father was an artist? Have you any taste that way?\" Jack shook his head. \"No, sir; I never thought of being an artist. I always wanted to go to sea.\" \"To go to sea—eh?\" Mr. Godstone repeated, \"Well, then, you have got your wish.\" \"Oh, I do not call this going to sea,\" Jack said contemptuously. \"I mean, I wanted to be a sailor—not a fisherman.\" \"And why didn\u0027t you go then, lad?\" \"Well, sir, in the first place mother did not know anyone who had to do with ships; and then her friends were all here, and she knew the place and its ways, and she thought that by buying a bawley, as she has done, in time I should come to sail her and earn my living as my uncle does. And then I don\u0027t think she would ever have agreed to my going to sea right away from her; but I do not know about that.\" \"Well, lad, you see the case is changed now. I have to do with ships, and Captain Murchison here commands one. At least he doesn\u0027t at the present moment, but he will do so as soon as I can buy[68] another to supply the place of the Petrel. And as he saw one yesterday that he thinks highly of, I shall probably buy her as soon as she has been surveyed. So you see that difficulty is at an end. As to your mother, no doubt she would have objected to your going as a ship\u0027s-boy, but perhaps she wouldn\u0027t if you were going as an apprentice. We call them midshipmen on board our ships; I like the name better than apprentice, though the thing is about the same. Captain Murchison will, I am sure, be glad to have you with him, and will do his best to make a good sailor of you. And you may be sure that I shall push you on if you deserve it as fast as possible; and it may be that in another ten years you will be in command of one of my ships. Well, what do you say to that?\" \"Oh! thank you, sir,\" Jack exclaimed. \"I should like that better than anything in the world, if mother will let me.\" \"I don\u0027t think that your mother will stand in the way of your good,\" Mr. Godstone said. \"And she must see that the prospect is a far better one than any you can have here; for after all, the profits of a bawley are not large, and the life is an infinitely harder one than that of a sailor. You had better not say anything to your mother about it until my wife has had a chat with her.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87060.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"简介： Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
