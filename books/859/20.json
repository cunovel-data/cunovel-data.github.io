{"id":30379,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. CAST ASHORE.","content":"When Jack opened his eyes he lay for some time wondering where he was and what had become of him. There were stars in the sky overhead, but the[202] light was stealing over it, and he felt that it was daybreak. There was a loud, dull, roaring sound in his ears—a sound he could not understand, for not even a breath of wind fanned his cheek. At last slowly the facts came to his mind. There had been a great storm, the vessel was among the breakers, he had got into the long-boat with Arthur to put in the plugs, they had been lifted up and blown away—and then suddenly Jack sat upright. It was light enough for him to see that he was still in the boat, but its back was broken and its sides staved in. Around him was a mass of tangled foliage, and close beside him lay Arthur Hill, the blood slowly oozing from a terrible gash in his forehead. Jack leaned over and raised him, and loudly shouted his name in his ear. With a sigh Arthur opened his eyes. \"What is it, Jack?\" he asked feebly. \"We are saved, old man. We have been blown right ashore in the boat, and we have both got shaken and hurt a bit; but, thank God, we are both alive.\" \"Where are we?\" Arthur asked, looking round. \"As far as I can see,\" Jack replied, \"we are in the middle of a grove of trees that have been blown down by the gale, and the leaves and branches have broken our fall, otherwise we must have been smashed up. We must have been lying here for the last ten hours. It was just about six o\u0027clock when we struck, for I looked at the clock in the cabin the last time we were down there; and as the sun will be up before long, it must be getting on for five now. Now, let us try to get out of this.\"[203] With the greatest difficulty, for they were still weak and terribly shaken, the boys made their way through the tangle of trees and branches, into which they had so providentially fallen. Both uttered an exclamation of surprise as they reached the edge of the wood: the sea was nearly half a mile away! A tremendous surf was still breaking, and for a quarter of a mile out a band of white breakers extended along the shore. There were no signs of the Wild Wave. Scarce speaking a word they made their way down to the shore, with the faint hope that some of their comrades might have been thrown on the strand alive. A few bits of broken timber alone showed that a wreck had taken place; the rest had probably been swept by the current up or down the coast. They walked for half a mile and then stopped. The sea here had made a clean breach over the land, and extended as far as the eye could reach. Retracing their steps they were again stopped by a similar obstacle. Then they went inland, passed round the grove of fallen trees, and looked landward. As far as they could see stretched a broad sheet of water, broken only by the branches of fallen trees. It was evident that a vast tract of country had been submerged by the storm, and that what was now an island upon which they stood had only been saved from a similar fate by being a few feet higher than the surrounding country. Every tree upon it had been felled, and the very surface of the soil seemed to have been torn off by the fury of the gale. Scarcely a word had been spoken from the time[204] they first reached the shore. The fate of their shipmates had depressed them profoundly, and as yet they could scarcely feel grateful for their own escape. Jack was the first to rouse himself from this state of despondency. \"Well, Arthur,\" he said, \"things don\u0027t look very bright, but we must hope for the best. At any rate let us thank God for having rescued us in such a marvellous manner. It seems almost a miracle.\" Both the boys were bareheaded, their caps having been blown away at the commencement of the gale, and they now stood with bended heads for some minutes silently thanking God for their preservation. \"Now, Arthur,\" Jack said cheerfully, \"let us go down to the water and see how fast it is sinking. It was running like a sluice into the sea at both ends of this island, and I do not suppose that it will be many hours before it is gone. As soon as it is we must set out and make our way across to the land beyond it. We are sure to find some villages there and to get some sort of food after we\u0027ve been down to the water. I vote we go back to the wood and lie down in the shade there. The sun will soon be unpleasantly hot, and as there is no chance of our getting a drink the sooner we are out of it the better.\" The day passed slowly; the boys talked but little, and when they did so their conversation turned entirely upon their lost shipmates, for that subject occupied their thoughts far more than their present situation. Before night the water had so far sunk that only some glistening pools appeared where a[205] broad sheet of water had before spread. Arthur was suffering much from thirst and would have started at once, but Jack persuaded him to wait until the next morning. \"We may tumble into deep holes full of mud,\" he said, \"and should get on very slowly. Let us have a good night\u0027s sleep and start with the first gleam of daylight. We shall be able to get along fast then.\" They found, however, that it was not very fast work; for the country had been cultivated and the soil was now converted into a soft mud, in which they sank up to their knees. Here and there as they went on they saw piles of mud and sunburnt bricks, with timbers projecting, and knew that these marked the site where villages or houses had stood. Among the clumps of fallen trees they saw bits of colour, and knew that these were the bodies of some of the natives. Here and there, too, they saw the carcass of a bullock. At last they found the ground under their feet much firmer. \"This has been a road,\" Jack said. \"The flood as it went down has left three or four inches of mud on it, but it is fairly firm underneath. If we can manage to keep on this we shall get on well.\" For six hours they plodded on, sometimes losing the path and floundering in the deep mud, at others regaining it and going along briskly. At the end of that time the mud was less deep, and in half an hour they were beyond the range of the inundation. Here and there a tree was still standing,[206] and after an hour\u0027s walking they came to a village. All the houses were unroofed and many of them levelled to the ground, but the walls of a few were still erect; some natives were moving about, and a few were digging at the ruined houses, apparently searching for the remains of those buried there. They evinced no interest in the arrival of the two shipwrecked white boys, being too utterly cowed and broken to think of anything but their own misery. \"There is a well, Arthur; at least I expect it is that,\" Jack said, pointing to a post upon which was a long pole with a rope hanging from the end in the air. They hurried to the spot, for both were suffering severely, and Arthur was scarcely able to speak. They found to their delight that Jack\u0027s surmise was a correct one, and hauling up the rope a bucket full of water came to the surface. Arthur was about to seize it, when Jack said, \"You had better take this thing, Arthur; the natives might make a row if you drank from their bucket.\" Arthur seized the half gourd that Jack had picked up, dipped it into the bucket, and handed it to Jack. \"Fire away, man; you are worse than I am,\" Jack replied. The gourd had to be refilled two or three times before they were both satisfied, then they went back into the village. Jack pointed to his mouth, and made signs that they wanted something to eat. The natives shook their heads apathetically and proceeded with their work. At last they went up to an old woman sitting in a chair, and rocking herself backwards[207] and forwards. She paid no attention when Jack addressed her, but upon his holding out a shilling to her her manner at once changed. She hobbled into the house and returned with a pile of flat cakes made from some native grain. \"We shall do now,\" Jack said, as, munching away at the bread, they tramped on. \"We must get to some place sooner or later where there is somebody who can talk English. How much money have you got, Arthur?\" \"I have got two pounds,\" Arthur said. \"I took it out of my chest while the gale was going on. I thought if we were wrecked and did get to shore it might be useful.\" \"I wish I had done the same,\" Jack said. \"I have luckily got a sovereign in my pocket, for I was going to pay Joe Scales for those six light canvas trousers he made me. Well, three pounds between us is not bad; and I have got four or five shillings loose, which will do, I hope, until we get to some place where we can change our gold.\" They walked on till sunset, passing several other villages by the way. All of these had suffered more or less severely by the storm, but it was evident that as they got further inland the work of destruction had been less complete. At sunset they sat down in a grove of trees still standing, the first they had passed, and there spent the night. \"That looks a good-sized place,\" Jack said, as late on the following afternoon they came in sight of what was evidently a town of some size. \"We shall probably find someone there who can speak English.\" After crossing a bridge over a river they entered[208] the town. They addressed several people, but these shook their heads and pointed forward. \"What do they mean, Jack?\" \"I am sure I don\u0027t know, unless they mean there is somebody farther on who speaks English.\" Presently they came to a large house. Several people were passing in and out. Jack spoke to one of these, but he shook his head and pointed indoors, \"This must be the right place, Arthur.\" They went into a large room, where two or three natives were sitting writing. They looked up in surprise at the two travel-stained English lads. \"Can any of you speak English?\" Jack asked. One of them at once left his desk and came forward. \"I can speak English. What do you want?\" \"Thank goodness!\" Jack exclaimed fervently. \"We are two officers belonging to an English ship that was wrecked in the storm two days ago. We believe all the rest have been drowned. We have made our way on foot across the country, and you are the first person we have met who can speak English.\" At the word \"officer\" the clerk had assumed a more respectful attitude. \"The collector-sahib went away yesterday to see what could be done and what supplies are needed; he will be back this evening. If you will follow me I will take you to the memsahib, who will see after you.\" Wondering whom they were going to see, the boys followed their conductor out at the back of the house into a large garden, in the centre of which stood a pretty bungalow. In the shaded verandah a lady was sitting reading. Motioning the boys to remain where they were the clerk went forward and addressed[209] the lady, who at once rose. He beckoned to the boys, who advanced to her as she was coming forward to meet them. \"So you have been shipwrecked, I hear?\" she said. \"It was a terrible gale. We did not feel it so much here, but I hear the destruction on the coast has been awful, and they say thousands of lives have been lost. Pray, come in. My husband is away, but he will be back this evening.\" The boys soon found themselves seated in easy-chairs in the verandah, while white-robed servants brought them refreshments. \"Now,\" the lady said, \"tell me all about yourselves. You belong to a ship that was wrecked; whereabout did she come ashore?\" \"We have not the least idea,\" Jack said. \"We had been hours running before the gale before we were cast ashore. We have been walking for two days, and have not found a soul who could speak English until now, so that we have not the least idea where we are.\" \"This is Cuttack,\" the lady said. \"It is just outside the Madras Presidency. We are only separated from it by the river Mahanuddy. You must have been wrecked somewhere between the mouth of the river and Palmyras.\" \"How far are we away from Calcutta, ma\u0027am?\" \"About two hundred miles,\" she replied. \"It is a low swampy unhealthy country all the way, but you will have no difficulty in taking a passage from here in a native craft. My husband will see about that for you. Where are your companions? You surely cannot be the only two saved from the wreck?\" \"I am greatly afraid we are,\" Jack replied; \"and[210] we were saved almost by a miracle. I hardly expect you to believe me when I tell you.\" He then related the events of the storm, and the manner in which they had reached land. \"It is certainly extraordinary,\" the lady said; \"but it does not seem to me by any means impossible, for I have heard that in these terrible cyclones houses have been taken up and carried long distances, and I can quite understand the same thing happening to a boat.\" An hour later Mr. Darcy the collector returned, and after hearing the boys\u0027 story said he would at once cause inquiries to be made along the coast whether any white men had been thrown up alive. \"I fear that there is but little hope,\" he said, \"for the surf on the coast in a cyclone like that we have had is tremendous, and even were anyone to float in on a spar he would probably be dashed to pieces when he approached the shore, and if he escaped that would be carried out again by the under tow. However, I will cause every inquiry to be made. The destruction has been terrible: numbers of villages have been swept away, and I hear that a great number of native craft are missing. Of course you will stop here for a few days with us to recover from your fatigue. I will rig you out until you can get fresh clothes made.\" The lads stopped for a week under the hospitable roof of Mr. Darcy. No news came of any Europeans having been washed ashore alive, though several dead bodies were reported as having been cast up at various points. At the end of the week they were rigged up afresh, and Mr. Darcy procured passages[211] for them in a dhow, bound for Calcutta. He laughed at the idea of the boys paying for their clothes or passage, and said he was only too pleased that he and his wife should have been of service to them. They arrived at Calcutta without adventure, and at once reported themselves to the agent of the Wild Wave and told the story of her loss. Here again they experienced the warm-hearted hospitality which is so general in India, the agent taking them out to his house and installing them there until the next steamer was to sail for England. He had telegraphed upon the day of their arrival to Mr. Godstone, and received an answer requesting him to take passages home for them to England, where they duly arrived without any exciting incident. Seven years have passed away, and Jack Robson is now second mate in one of Mr. Godstone\u0027s ships, and will be his first officer on next voyage. He has gone through many adventures since, but none approaching in interest and excitement to those which occurred on his two voyages in the Wild Wave. His mother still lives at Dulwich, and Lily is engaged to be married to Arthur Hill as soon as the latter attains the rank of captain. Jack is neither engaged nor married, but his mother has a strong idea that before very long he and Mildred Godstone will come to an understanding with each other. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87073.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"简介： Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
