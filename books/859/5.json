I am always glad when we get that buoy; it is the hardest to find of any of them. We shall have to jibe going round it. You stand by to brail the sail up when I give the word; we might carry away the gaff at the jaws if we let the sail go over all standing now.\" As soon as they neared the buoy Tom Hoskins got in the oar with which the mainsail was boomed out. \"Now, Jack, brail up the sail as she comes round. Haul in the sheet as fast as you can, Tom, and pay it out again handsomely as it comes over. That is the way. Now fasten the sheet and throw off the main-tack and trice the sail up pretty near to the throat. \"That will do. Slack the brail off, Jack. Now[38] haul in the sheet a bit. You had better let the foresail down, Tom; the wind is heavy, and there is too much sea on here to drive her through it too fast.\" The sea would have been far heavier than it now was in another two hours\u0027 time, but the water was still very shallow on the sands, and this broke the force of the waves. The boat was now running along the narrow channel of deep water leading between the Spitway Buoy and the Bell Buoy, and almost at right angles to the course they had before been following. The wind was almost on their beam, and even under the reduced canvas the Bessy was lying far over, the water covering three planks of her deck on the starboard side. They could see the buoy, and presently could hear its deep tolling as the hammers struck the bell with every motion of the buoy. \"Ah! here is another heavy rain squall coming down. I am glad we are round the Bell Buoy before it came up. Jack, you may as well put the tea-kettle on. A cup of tea will be a comfort.\" All three were wrapped up in oil-skins; but in spite of this they had a general sensation of dampness, for it had been raining more or less ever since they started. Jack was below, when he heard a far louder roar of the wind than before, and heard his uncle shout, \"Brail up the main as far as you can, Tomâ€”the jib is about all we want now!\" Jack looked out from the fo\u0027castle. The wind was blowing tremendously, sweeping the heads off the waves and driving them into sheets of spray; then great drops of rain struck the deck almost with[39] the force of bullets, and a minute later it came down almost in bucketfuls. \"Do you want me, uncle?\" he shouted. His voice did not reach Ben\u0027s ears, but he guessed what he had said and waved his hand to him to remain in the fo\u0027castle. Jack took off his sou\u0027-wester and shook the water from his oil-skin, and then opening the locker where the coke was kept replenished the fire. It settled down so dark when the squall struck the boat that he could scarce see across the little cabin. Regardless of the howling of the wind and the motion of the vessel, he sat on the floor putting in stick after stick to hasten up the fire. As soon as the kettle boiled he put in a handful of tea and some sugar and took the kettle off the fire, then he got a couple of large mugs and half-filled them with tea, and sat balancing them until the fluid was sufficiently cool to be drunk. Then tying on his sou\u0027-wester again he made his way out and gave a mug to each of the others. \"Go down below again, Jack!\" his uncle shouted at the top of his voice, and although Jack was within two or three feet of him, he scarcely heard him. \"There is nothing to be done at present here, and it is no use looking out for the Swin Middle at present.\" Jack took a look round before he went below. Away at some distance on either hand were white masses of foam where the sea was breaking on the sands. He went up to the bow and looked ahead through the darkness, then he went back to his uncle. \"I caught sight of a light right over the bowsprit.\" \"Ah! they have lit up then,\" Tripper said. \"I[40] thought they would, for it is almost as dark as night. You had best get the side-lights ready and the flareup. I don\u0027t suppose we shall want them, for if we see a steamer coming down we will give her a clear berth. They won\u0027t be able to look far ahead in the face of this wind and rain.\" Jack went forward again and lay down on the lockers. He thought little of the storm. It was a severe one, no doubt, but with the wind nearly due aft, and a weather tide, it was nothing to the Bessy, whose great beam in comparison to her length enabled her to run easily before the wind, when a long narrow craft would have been burying herself. Presently he thought he heard his uncle shout, and getting up looked aft. Tom Hoskins was now at the helm. Tripper was standing beside him, and pointing at something broad away on the beam. Jack at once made his way aft. \"What is it, uncle?\" \"I saw the flash of a gun. Ah! there it is again. There is a ship ashore on the Middle Sunk.\" Jack gazed in the direction in which his uncle was pointing. In a minute there was another flash. \"It is all over with her,\" Ben Tripper said solemnly. \"The strongest ship that ever was built could not hold together long on that sand with such a sea on as there will be there now.\" \"Cannot we do something?\" Tripper was silent for half a minute. \"What do you think, Tom? We might get there through the swashway. There is plenty of water for us, and we could lay our course there. It is a risky business, you know, and we may not be able to get near her[41] when we get there; but that we cannot tell till we see how she is fixed. Still, if we could get there before she goes to pieces we might perhaps save some of them.\" \"I don\u0027t mind, Ben, if you don\u0027t,\" the other said. \"I have neither wife nor child, and if you like to take the risk, I am ready.\" Ben Tripper looked at Jack. \"I would not mind if it wasn\u0027t for the boy,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t mind me, uncle,\" Jack burst out. \"I would not have you hang back because of me, not for anything in the world. Do try it, uncle. It would be awful to think of afterwards, when we hear of her being lost with all hands, that we might have saved some of them perhaps if we had tried.\" Ben still hesitated, when another bright flash was seen. It was an appeal for aid he could not resist. \"Put down the helm, Tom,\" he said. \"Now, Jack, help me to rouse in the sheet. That will do. Now then for a pull on the jib-sheet. Now we will put the last reef in the foresail and hoist it, slack the brail and haul down the main-tack a bit. We must keep good way on her crossing the tide.\" Now that they were nearly close-hauled instead of running before the wind, Jack recognized much more strongly than before how heavy was the sea and how great the force of the wind. Lively as the boat was, great masses of water poured over her bow and swept aft as each wave struck her. Her lee bulwarks were completely buried. \"Give me the helm, Tom,\" Tripper said; \"and get those hatchways up and cover the well, and lash the tarpaulin over it. It is bad enough here, it will[42] be worse when we get into broken water near the wreck.\" Most of the bawleys are provided with hatches for closing the long narrow place known as the \u0027well,\u0027 but it is only under quite exceptional circumstances that they are ever used. Jack and the man got them up and managed to fit them in their places, but getting the tarpaulin over them was beyond their power. \"I will throw her up into the wind,\" Ben said. \"Haul on the weather fore-sheet as I do, and belay it with the foot of the sail just to windward of the mast. Now rouse in the main-sheet. That is right.\" Quitting the tiller as the boat lay-to to the wind, Ben lent his aid to the other two, and in three or four minutes the tarpaulin was securely lashed over the hatches, and the boat completely battened down. \"Now, Jack, you had best lash yourself to something or you will be swept overboard; we shall have it a lot worse than this presently. Now, Tom, before we get well away again get the last reef in the mainsail, then we can haul the tack down taut again; the sail will stand much better so, and we shall want to keep her all to windward if she is to go through the swashway.\" When all was ready the fore weather-sheet was let go, and the lee-sheet hauled taut. The main-sheet was slacked off a little and the Bessy proceeded on her way. It was a terrible half-hour; fortunately the dense heavy clouds had broken a little, and it was lighter than it had been, but this only rendered the danger more distinct. Once in the swashway, which is the name given to a narrow channel between the sands, the waves were less high. But on either[43] hand they were breaking wildly, for there were still but four or five feet of water over the sands. The sea was nearly abeam now, and several times Jack almost held his breath as the waves lifted the Bessy bodily to leeward and threatened to cast her into the breaking waters but a few fathoms away. But the skipper knew his boat well and humoured her through the waves, taking advantage of every squall to eat up a little to windward, but always keeping her sails full and plenty of way on her. At last they were through the swashway; and though the sea was again heavier, and the waves frequently swept over the decks, Jack gave a sigh of relief. They could make out the hull of the vessel now looming up black over the white surf that surrounded it. She had ceased firing, either from the powder being wetted or her guns disabled. \"Which way had we better get at her, Tom?\" Ben Tripper asked. \"She is pretty near on the top of the sand.\" \"The only way we have a chance of helping her is by laying-to, or anchoring on the edge of the sand to leeward of her. They may be able to drift a line down to us. I do not see any other way. Our anchors wouldn\u0027t hold to windward of her.\" \"No; I suppose that is the best way, Tom. We must make the best allowance we can for the wind and the set of tide, otherwise they will never drift a line down to us. She won\u0027t hold together long. Her stern is gone as far as the mizzen, so we must be quick about it.\" The wreck was evidently a sailing vessel. Her masts were all gone, her bulwarks carried away, and[44] she lay far heeled over. A group of people could be seen huddled up in the bow as they neared her. Tom Hoskins and Jack had for the last ten minutes been busy getting the spare anchor up on deck and fastening to it the wrap of the trawl-net, which was by far the strongest rope they had on board. \"What water is there on the sand, Ben?\" \"Six or seven feet on the edge, but less further on. We do not draw over five feet, so we will keep on till we touch. The moment we do so let the two anchors go. Wind and tide will take her off again quick enough. Pay out ten or twelve fathoms of chain, and directly she holds up drop the lead-line overboard to see if she drags; if she does, give her some more rope and chain.\" The anchors were both got overboard and in readiness to let go at a moment\u0027s notice, the instant the Bessy took ground. The foresail was lowered and the mainsail partly brailed up, so that she had only way on her sufficient to stem the tide. As they entered the broken water Jack was obliged to take a step back and hold on to the mast. Her motion had before been violent, but to a certain extent regular; now she was tossed in all directions so sharply and violently that he expected every moment that the mast would go. Tom looked round at Ben. The latter pointed to the sail and waved his hand. Tom understood him, and going to the mast loosened the brail a little to give her more sail, for the waves completely knocked the way out of her. When she forged ahead again, Tom returned to his post. Jack held his breath every time the boat pitched,[45] but she kept on without touching until within some eighty yards of the wreck; then as she pitched forward down a wave there was a shock that nearly threw Jack off his feet, prepared for it though he was. In a moment he steadied himself, and crept forward and cut the lashing of the hawser just as Tom severed that of the chain. The latter rattled out for a moment. There was another shock, but less violent than the first, and then the renewed rattle of the chain showed that she was drifting astern. Ben now left the tiller and sprang forward. The jib was run in by the traveller and got down, the foresail had been cast off and had run down the forestay the moment she struck, and the three now set to work to lower the mainsail. \"She is dragging,\" Tom said, examining the lead-line, \"but not fast.\" \"Give her another five or six fathoms of chain,\" Ben said, himself attending to the veering out of the hawser. This done they again watched the lead-line. It hung straight down by the side of the vessel. \"They have got her!\" Ben said. \"Now then for the ship.\" For the first time since they entered the broken water they had leisure to look about them. Those on board the ship had lost no time, and had already launched a light spar with a line tied to it into the water. \"It will miss us,\" Ben said, after watching the spar for a minute. \"You see, I allowed for wind and tide, and the wind does not affect the spar, and the tide will sweep it down thirty or forty yards on our port bow.[46]\" It turned out so. Those on board payed out the line until the spar floated abreast of the smack, but at a distance of some thirty yards away. \"What is to be done?\" Ben asked. \"If we were to try to get up sail again we should drift away so far to leeward we should never be able to beat back.\" \"Look here,\" Jack said; \"if you signal to them to veer out some more rope I could soon do it. I could not swim across the tide now, but if it were twenty fathom further astern I could manage it.\" \"You could never swim in that sea, Jack.\" \"Well, I could try, uncle. Of course you would fasten a line round me, and if I cannot get there you will haul me in again. There cannot be any danger about that.\" So saying Jack at once proceeded to throw off his oil-skins and sea-boots, while Ben went to the bow of the boat and waved to those on the wreck to slack out more line. They soon understood him, and the spar was presently floating twenty yards further astern. Jack had by this time stripped. A strong line was now fastened round his body under his arms, and going up to the bow of the boat, so as to give himself as long a distance as possible to drift, he prepared for the swim.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87058.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
