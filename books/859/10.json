{"id":30369,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. THE RIOT IN ALEXANDRIA.","content":"For half an hour the lads sauntered on, interested in the people rather than the shops. They bought a few things. Jack invested in half a pound of Egyptian tobacco and a gaily-decorated pipe for his Uncle Ben, two little filigree brooches, and a couple of very large silk handkerchiefs of many colours, with knotted fringes, for his mother and sister. \"I do not know what they will do with them,\" he said; \"but they will do to put on the back of a sofa or something of that sort.\" The others also made some purchases, both expending a good deal more than Jack did; but the latter said that he would keep his money for Smyrna, where probably he would get all sorts of pretty things. They were walking quietly along, when they saw a commotion in front of them. A number of men were shouting and gesticulating angrily, and blows were exchanged. \"Let us get out of this,\" Jack said. \"It is no good running the risk of getting our heads broken.\" People were now running from the shops, while from side streets the natives poured down. \"This is a regular row!\" Jim Tucker exclaimed. \"Look! those fellows are all armed with big sticks. Listen! there are pistols going off somewhere else.\" A moment later the natives fell suddenly upon some Europeans standing close to the boys. These drew knives and pistols, and a fierce combat at once raged.[90] \"Come out of this!\" Jim exclaimed, running into a shop close by. \"We must make a bolt for it somewhere.\" At that moment an Italian, armed with a pistol, rushed in from behind the shop. On seeing the three lads he exclaimed in broken English, \"Shut the door, they mean to kill us all!\" The boys closed the door, and the owner piled some boxes and other goods against it; but there was no fastening up the window, for the fastenings were outside. \"Come upstairs,\" the man said, and the lads followed him to the floor above. The battle was still raging in the street. Groups of Greeks and Italians stood together, defending themselves with their knives from the heavy sticks of their assailants, but were being fast beaten down. The shrieks of women rose loud above the shouting of the combatants, while from the upper windows the cracks of revolvers sounded out as the Greek, Maltese, and Italian shopkeepers who had not sallied out into the streets tried to aid their comrades below. \"Now, have you got any arms you can give us?\" Tucker asked. \"This looks like a regular rising of the natives. They would never all have their sticks handy if they hadn\u0027t prepared for it.\" \"There are some long knives in that cupboard,\" the man said, \"and there is another pistol my brother Antonio has got. He is sick in bed.\" Just at this moment the door opened and another Italian came in in trousers and shirt. \"What is it, Joseph?\"[91] \"The natives have risen and are massacring all the Europeans.\" The sick man made his way to the window. \"I am not surprised,\" he said, as he discharged his pistol and brought down a native who was in the act of battering in the head of a fallen man. \"You said only yesterday, you thought there was mischief brewingâ€”that the natives were surly and insolent; but I did not think they would dare to do this.\" \"Well, brother, we will sell our lives as dearly as we can.\" The conflict was now pretty nearly over, and the two men withdrew from the window and closed the jalousies. \"Most of them are making off,\" Antonio said, peeping cautiously out through the lattice-work. \"I suppose they are going to attack somewhere else. What are the police doing? They ought to be here soon.\" But the time went on, and there were no signs of the police. The natives now began to break open the shops and plunder the contents. The two men placed themselves at the top of the stairs. It was not long before they heard a crashing of glass and a breaking of wood, then a number of men rushed into the shop. \"Don\u0027t fire, Joseph,\" Antonio said, \"so long as they do not try to come up here. They may take away the soap and candles and other things if they choose, if they will but leave us alone.\" The stairs were straight and narrow, and led direct from the shop itself to the floor above. After plundering the shop the natives departed laden[92] with their spoil, without attempting to ascend the stairs. \"We are in an awful fix here,\" Jim Tucker said. \"What do you think we had better do? Shall we get out at the back of the house and try and make a bolt of it?\" \"I do not think that is any good,\" Jack replied. \"I was at the back window just now, and could hear shouts and the report of firearms all over the place. No; if we go out into the streets we are safe to be murdered, if we stop here they may not search the house. Anyhow, at the worst we can make a better fight here than in the streets.\" Two hours passed. At times large bodies of natives rushed along the streets, brandishing their sticks and shouting triumphantly. Some few of them had firearms, and these they discharged at the windows as they passed along. \"We ought to have had some troops here long before this,\" Antonio said to his brother. The latter, who was sitting on a chair evidently exhausted by his exertions, shrugged his shoulders. \"They were more likely to help the mob than to interfere with them. The troops are at the bottom of the whole trouble.\" A clock on the mantel-piece struck five, just as a fresh body of natives came down the street. They were evidently bent upon pillage, as they broke up and turned into the shops. Shouts and pistol-shots were again heard. \"They are sacking the houses this time, Joseph. Now the hour has come.\" The two brothers knelt together before the figure[93] of a saint in a little niche in the wall. The boys glanced at each other, and each, following the example of the Italians, knelt down by a chair and prayed for a minute or two. As they rose to their feet there was a sudden din below. Pistol in hand, the brothers rushed out on the landing. \"Do not try to come up!\" Antonio shouted in Egyptian. \"You are welcome to what you can find below, but you shall not come up here. We are desperate men, and well armed.\" The natives, who were just about to ascend the stairs, drew back at the sight of the brothers standing pistol in hand at the top, with the three lads behind them. The stairs were only wide enough for one to advance at a time, and the natives, eager as they were for blood and plunder, shrank from making the attempt. Some of those who were farthest back began to slink out of the shop, and the others followed their example. There was a loud talking outside for some time, then several of them again entered. Some of them began to pull out the drawers, as if in the hopes of finding something that former searchers had overlooked, others passed on into an inner room. \"What are they up to now, I wonder?\" Arthur Hill said. \"No good, I will be bound,\" Jim Tucker replied. \"There! They seem to be going out again now.\" Just as the last man passed out Antonio exclaimed in Italian, \"I smell smoke, Joseph; they have fired the house! They have set fire to the room below,\" he translated to the lads; but even before he spoke the boys understood what had taken place, for a[94] light smoke poured out from the inner room, and a smell of burning wood came to their nostrils. \"The beggars have done us,\" Jim Tucker said bitterly. \"We could have held these stairs against them for an hour, but this fire will turn us out in no time.\" The smoke rose thicker and thicker, and they could hear the crackling of wood. \"Let us get out of the back window, we may get off that way.\" Touching Antonio\u0027s arm he beckoned him in that direction. The Italian nodded, and the party went into the back room. Antonio drew the sheets from the beds and knotted them. Jim went to the window and looked out. As he did so there was a yell of derision from below. A score of the natives had made their way through the adjoining houses, and taken up their station from behind to cut off their retreat. It needed no words to tell those in the room what had taken place. Antonio threw down the sheets and said to his brother, \"Let us sally out, Joseph; the sooner it is over the better. See, the smoke is coming up through the floor already. Let us go out before we are suffocated.\" \"I am ready,\" the other replied. Followed by the boys the brothers left the room and descended the stairs. The flames were already rushing out of the back room. There was a shout from without as the defenders were seen to descend the ladder. The boys grasped each other\u0027s hands as a final farewell, and then with set lips and knives firmly grasped followed the two Italians and dashed into the street. Sharp cracks of the revolvers sounded[95] out, and then in an instant the mob closed round the little party. Keeping close together, cutting and thrusting with their knives, the boys tried to make their way through. The crowd was so thick, that mixed up as they were in it, the natives could not use their sticks, but drawing their knives grappled with the boys. Jack felt a sharp pain in several places; he fell, struggled to his feet again, was again struck down. He seemed to hear a voice raised above the din, then he knew nothing more. When he recovered his senses he found that a native was stooping over him and pressing a cloth to his forehead. He lay still for a minute or two, wondering faintly what had become of him. Looking round he could see he was in a small room. An Egyptian of the better class, in buttoned-up frock-coat and light trousers, and with a scarlet fez on his head, was standing looking down at him, and was apparently giving instructions to the native, who was endeavouring to staunch one of his wounds. As soon as he took this in, the thought of his comrades flashed across his mind, and pushing the man\u0027s hand back from his forehead he struggled into a sitting position. \"Hurrah, Jack! I was afraid that they had done for you,\" a voice said, and he saw Tucker and Hill sitting propped up against a wall. Two of the natives now took hold of him, dragged him along the floor, and placed him by the side of the others. Then the Egyptian said, \"You keep quiet, I save your lives. If you move or make noise we kill you at once.\" The lads were all faint from loss of blood, and[96] half stupefied from the heavy blows they had received; and after a word or two of thankfulness at finding themselves all together and alive, they lay quiet. There were two or three natives in the room, and from time to time one went out or came in with news as to what was passing in the streets. Each time there was much talk among their guards, and it was evident that they were dissatisfied with the result. The outbreak, indeed, had not been, as the boys supposed, universal; had it been, the whole European population would probably have been destroyed. It was confined to a portion only of the lower part of the town. Whether it was planned or not beforehand is a disputed point. It began in a quarrel between some Maltese and natives; but this quarrel seemed to be accepted by the latter as a signal for a general attack, and they rushed from their houses armed with heavy sticks and knives and attacked the Europeans. Rumours had for some time been current among them that the Christians intended to conquer Egypt and to put down the Mahomedan religion, and in their excited state a spark caused an explosion. It was perhaps fortunate that it came when it did, and was confined to a comparatively small part of the town; for had it spread over the whole city the loss of life would have been great indeed, for the natives had entirely their own way from three o\u0027clock in the afternoon until seven in the evening. The police made no attempt whatever to put down the riot. The English and Italian consuls, immediately they heard what was going on, drove together to the governor\u0027s to call upon him to send[97] for the troops, and to take vigorous steps to restore order. They were attacked upon the way and both wounded, but they succeeded in reaching the governor\u0027s palace. By means of the strongest representations, and by telling him that he would be held personally responsible by the Powers they represented for the consequences of the disturbance, they at last induced him to act, and at seven o\u0027clock the troops arrived and were marched through the streets, when the natives at once dispersed to their homes. Some seventy Europeans, including ten or twelve women, were killed, and all the shops in the quarter where the riot took place, pillaged. No damage was done in the business part of the town. There the Europeans at once armed themselves as soon as the news of the riot reached them, and formed up in the square. Strong parties were landed from the ships of war, and were prepared to give so hot a reception to the mob should they come that way, that the rioters confined their work to the quarter in which it began. The Egyptians are timid people, and the population of Alexandria were not sure that the army would go to any great length against the Europeans, or that the country in general would be with them. The outbreak was therefore rather the result of the hatred existing among the lower class against the riffraff of the various nationalities gathered in Alexandria, whose conduct frequently gave good grounds indeed for the feeling entertained against them, than of deliberate intention. How many of the natives were killed in the fight was never known; the bodies were hastily carried away and buried by their friends as soon as the[98] rumour spread of the arrival of the troops, and only some eight or ten of their dead were found lying in the streets. The rescue of the boys was due to the presence in the mob of a wealthy bey, who lived a short distance out of the town. This man was a brother of one of the leaders of the military insurrection at Cairo, and was in close communication with Arabi and the colonels. He had been actively preparing for a general rising against the Europeans by the propagation of stories hostile to the latter, and by exciting the greed of the lowest classes of the town by pointing out how great was the wealth they could obtain by looting the well-filled shops and warehouses. Some of his agents had assisted to bring about the riot. But he had not intended it to go so far, and had only wished to add to the excitement and ill-feeling that prevailed, by a tumult attended with loss of life upon both sides. He was well satisfied when he saw how eagerly the natives rushed to arms, but as soon as the conflict fairly began he had sent his men among the rioters urging them not to proceed further until the army was at hand to support them. He knew that the plunder they had obtained from the small shops would only excite their desire to appropriate the contents of the rich stores in the Europeans\u0027 quarters, and was therefore well contented with what had been done. He had happened to be passing when the little party rushed from the burning house into the crowd. As they did so he caught sight of the naval uniform of the boys, and imagined that they belonged to one of the ships of war.[99] He saw at once that their lives might be valuable to him. If his party triumphed he could hand them over and take credit for their capture; if the great insurrection that was already planned failed, he could use them as a means of obtaining favourable terms for himself. He therefore called together two or three of his men who were in the crowd, and made his way to the scene of conflict just as the lads succumbed to their foes. With great difficulty he succeeded in rescuing them from their assailants, and then had them carried into a house hard by. As soon as it was dark the boys were wrapped up in dark cloths and carried away through the streets. As many dead bodies were being similarly taken off by the natives no questions were asked, nor did the soldiers now scattered about interfere with their bearers. The motion started the boys\u0027 wounds into bleeding again. They had difficulty in breathing through the cloths bound round them, and when they were at last thrown heavily down upon the ground their consciousness had almost entirely left them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87063.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
