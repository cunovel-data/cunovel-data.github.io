{"id":30368,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. ALEXANDRIA.","content":"Ten days\u0027 hard work and the Wild Wave\u0027s equipment was nearly complete. The riggers were to put the finishing touch to their work that evening, and the carpenters to finish all below, and were to begin in the morning scraping and cleaning the decks, and there then remained only the painting to be done. The captain\u0027s usual hour for coming on board was eleven o\u0027clock, but the men were just knocking off for dinner when he arrived. \"Well, Mr. Timmins, when do you think we can be ready to take cargo on board?\"[79] \"Well, sir, it will take them three days to get the decks planed. They are in a beastly state, you see. She must have had a dirty lot on board her on her last voyage, and she has picked up six months\u0027 dirt in the docks. Nothing short of planing will get them fit to be seen. Then the painters will take another four days, I should say, perhaps five, as the bulwarks and all the paint on deck must be done.\" \"That makes eight days\u0027 work, Mr. Timmins. I suppose we cannot set the painters at work until the carpenters are done?\" The mate shook his head. \"Decidedly not, if the paint is to be worth looking at, sir. It would be throwing money and time away to begin to paint as long as the chips and dust are flying about.\" \"If we were to get the painting on deck done directly the carpenters knock off we might do the outside while we are taking the cargo in?\" \"Yes, we might do that,\" the mate assented; \"though even then if it is anything like a dusty cargo the paint wouldn\u0027t show up as smooth and clean as one would like to see it.\" \"Well, we can\u0027t help that,\" the captain said. \"I have just come from the office, and they have had an offer for a freight, part to Alexandria and part to Smyrna; but they wanted to begin to load at once. I said that was out of the question, but that I thought I could begin to take it on board next Monday.\" \"Well, it will be quick work, sir. However, if you can get them to put a good strong gang of carpenters on board they might get the deck finished off by Wednesday evening. Anyhow, we might have[80] the painters on board on Thursday morning, and if they are sharp they should finish by the time they knock off on Saturday.\" \"WE ARE DESPERATE MEN AND WELL ARMED\" \"WE ARE DESPERATE MEN AND WELL ARMED\" \"Yes. Two coats will be sufficient,\" the captain said; \"at any rate in most places. They might send a man or two to-morrow to put a coat at once on at the gangways and other places where it is worst.\" \"Do you know what the cargo is, captain?\" \"Mixed cargo; some railway iron for Egypt, the rest hardware and dry goods of one sort and another, but beyond that I did not hear any particulars.\" \"Well, captain, I think we can say that we shall be ready to take it on board on Monday. Will you get them at the office to write to the two mates to tell them to be here the first thing in the morning? \"I think you are in luck, youngster,\" Mr. Timmins went on as the captain left the ship to see that a strong gang of carpenters were set to work. \"A trip up the Mediterranean will be a capital breaking in for you. You will hardly be out of sight of land all the way, and Alexandria and Smyrna are two ports well worth seeing. We don\u0027t very often get a jaunt up the Mediterranean now; those rascally steamers get all the work.\" When the riggers had once left the ship Jack had nothing more to do, and Mr. Timmins told him that it would be no use his coming again until Monday morning. \"You will be useful then,\" he said, \"helping to check off the cargo as it comes on board. You had better bring your chest down and take up your quarters here. I shall get the cook in on Monday, and I expect we shall all stop on board. Of course[81] when work is over you can always go back home when you are disposed.\" To Mrs. Robson\u0027s delight, therefore, Jack was able to spend the next few days at home, and also to assure her that his first voyage was to be a short one only. All was in readiness on Monday morning. The second and third mates came on board early; the crew were not to join until the evening before sailing, as the work of loading was done by stevedores. The second and third mates were both young men. They had spoken to Jack on board the bawley, and had shaken hands with him when they left Leigh with warm expressions of gratitude, and they both greeted him most cordially as soon as they met him on the deck of the Wild Wave. Jack therefore commenced his career as a sailor under altogether exceptionally pleasant conditions. The captain and two of the mates were under very deep obligations to him, and Mr. Timmins had already conceived a very favourable opinion of him from his willingness to turn his hand to anything, and from his quickness and handiness. For the next three days work went on from morning until night. Jack was stationed at one of the hatchways with the second mate checking off every box, bale, and package as it went down. The boatswain and crew came on board on the Tuesday, as there was the work of bending the sails and getting all in readiness for the start to be got through. Jack had not returned home on Monday or Tuesday night, but on Wednesday he went home to say good-bye, for the vessel was to go out of dock at noon on Thursday.[82] Before leaving home he donned for the first time his neat uniform, which had only come a few days before. Lily was delighted with his appearance, and his mother felt no little pride as she looked at him, and, sad as she was at the prospect of his long absence, was thoroughly convinced that the choice he had made was a wise one. Mrs. Godstone and her daughter had been down twice to call upon Mrs. Robson since her arrival at Dulwich, and on the previous Saturday Jack and his mother had gone there to dine, Captain and Mrs. Murchison being the only other guests. After a tearful good-bye Jack started from home. On his arrival on board he found two other lads, one a year older than himself and one as much younger. Jim Tucker, the elder, had already made two or three voyages in Mr. Godstone\u0027s ships. Arthur Hill was going to sea for the first time. Jack knew that two other midshipmen were sailing in the Wild Wave, and found them arranging their things in the little cabin, with three bunks, allotted to them. \"Hallo! You are Robson, I suppose?\" Jim Tucker began as he entered. \"You have got a lot of gear here in the cabin, and you must stow it away in a smaller space than it takes up at present or we shall never fit in.\" \"I have not begun to stow it away yet,\" Jack said. \"I was waiting to see how much you had both got, and which berth you were going to choose, before I began to settle at all.\" \"Yes, that is all right enough,\" Tucker answered. \"Well, as I am the senior, I will take this berth under the port.\"[83] \"I suppose I am next,\" Jack said. \"I will take the top one opposite.\" This being settled the lads proceeded to put things straight and stow away their portmanteaus. As soon as they had done this they went on deck. The vessel was already warping out of the dock, and as soon as she was through the gates a steam-tug seized her and took her down the river. It was eight o\u0027clock, and the sun was just setting, when the hawser attached to the tug was thrown off. Some of the sails had already been hoisted, for the wind was northerly. The rest were now shaken out and sheeted home, and under a cloud of white canvas—for the Wild Wave had been fitted with an entirely new suit of sails—the vessel proceeded on her way. The officers were divided into two watches. The first and third mates and Arthur Hill were in one watch, the second mate and the other two lads in the other. After the constant work on board the smack Jack found it strange as he came down the river to be walking up and down the deck with nothing to do. The Wild Wave passed through a fleet of bawleys trawling off Hole Haven; he knew every one of them by sight, but the Bessy was not among them. Meals had been irregular that day with the officers, for there was much to be seen after in coiling down ropes, washing the decks, and in getting everything neatly in ship-shape. As they passed the Middle Sunk the second mate touched Jack on the shoulder. \"That\u0027s her,\" he said; \"at least all that remains of[84] her,\" and he pointed to some black timbers just appearing above the surface of the water. \"Yes; that\u0027s her,\" Jack said. \"I heard from my uncle that they blew her up three weeks ago.\" \"Rather a different scene from what it was that day,\" the mate, whose name was Hoare, said. \"I thought it was all up with us, and even when we saw you coming we hardly believed that you could get near enough to take us off; and now it is as smooth as glass.\" \"It was a lucky day for me, sir, that was,\" Jack said. \"I had then nothing to look forward to, beyond sailing a bawley; now I have got the life I always wanted to follow, and every prospect of getting on.\" \"That you have, my lad,\" Hoare agreed. \"It was a rare bit of luck for you that you made us out, no doubt, and a rare bit of luck for us too.\" The voyage began well. The wind continued light and in the right quarter all the first week. Jack and his companions were not idle, and always went aloft with the watch when there was occasion to make any change with the sails. This was at first a trial for Arthur Hill; but Jim Tucker was an old hand at it, and Jack, who had often had to make his way up the Bessy\u0027s mast when she was rolling heavily, was soon quite at home on the yards of the Wild Wave. For two hours every morning the three boys worked at navigation, Mr. Hoare acting as instructor. So smooth was the sea and so slight the motion that Jack could hardly believe that he was sailing down through the Bay of Biscay, of which he had[85] heard so much; and he was quite surprised when, on the fifth day after sailing, Mr. Hoare pointed to land on the port bow, and told him that was Portugal. \"We have had capital luck, so far,\" the officer said. \"If the wind does but hold till we once get fairly round Cape St. Vincent, it may change as soon as it likes into any quarter except the east, and we are not very likely to get that at this time of the year.\" \"I should not mind a change of wind a bit, sir,\" Jack said; \"it would bring us something to do.\" \"Ah, yes; after being accustomed to go about every five minutes or so on the Thames, I understand you finding this monotonous, Jack. When you have had a little more of the sea, you won\u0027t mind how much you get of fine weather and favouring winds. As for storms, I don\u0027t care if I never see another. They are very grand to read of in books, and when you have got a stout ship and plenty of sea room there is no need to be afraid; but when you are wet through for a week at a spell, and the galley-fires can\u0027t be kept going, there is very little comfort in it.\" The wind changed next day to the west, and by evening was blowing hard. A good deal of the canvas was taken off, and the ship edged further away from land; but after blowing strongly the wind abated again, and the next day the Wild Wave passed Cape St. Vincent and headed for the Straits of Gibraltar. As the wind still held from the west they made a rapid run, and in ten days after passing St. Vincent dropped anchor in the harbour of Alexandria.[86] The next day the captain said to Jim Tucker, \"You three lads can go ashore after dinner to-day. There is nothing particular for you to do on board, and it is well to get a view of these foreign towns while you can. When you once get to be mates you will not have much chance to do so, for then you will have to be looking after the loading and unloading of the cargo. Come off before gun-fire. There are about as cut-throat a lot of thieves in Alexandria as in any port on the Mediterranean, and that is saying a good deal.\" \"It is quite possible that there will be trouble here before long,\" Mr. Hoare remarked at dinner. \"I saw something in the paper about it,\" Mr. Alston, the third mate, said; \"but I did not trouble to read through the accounts. What is it all about?\" \"There has been a sort of peaceable revolution,\" Mr. Hoare said. \"The colonels of the regiments in Cairo, headed by a general named Arabi Pasha, mutinied, and the viceroy had to give way to them.\" \"What did they mutiny about?\" the third mate asked. \"Well, in the first place they wanted privileges for the army, and in the second place they wanted a lot of Europeans who hold berths to be dismissed, and the government to be entirely in the hands of natives. It is a sort of national movement, with the army at the head of it; and the viceroy, although still nominally the ruler of Egypt, is in fact little more than a cipher in the hands of Arabi and the colonels. They say the French are at the bottom of it, and it is likely enough. They have always been [87]jealous of our influence in Egypt. However, I do not suppose we shall interfere in the matter, unless they break regularly out and ill-treat Europeans, and threaten to seize the canal or something of that sort.\" After dinner the three boys landed together in a boat. Half a dozen natives pressed round them directly they stepped ashore, and offered to act as guides; but these offers they refused, for, as Jim Tucker said, \"We have only got to walk about, and we are certain to find ourselves somewhere. It will be time enough talking about taking a guide when it is time for us to make down to the port again. This is a long street, let us follow it. It must lead somewhere.\" Staring into the funny little shops, and at the varying crowds, composed of people of all the nationalities of the Mediterranean, mingled with a swarm of scantily-clad natives, and women wrapped up in dark blue cotton cloths, the lads made their way along. \"What an awful place for flies!\" Arthur Hill said, after brushing two or three off his cheek. \"Just look at that child! Why, there are a dozen round its eyes, and it doesn\u0027t seem to mind them in the least; and there is another just the same!\" \"I expect the coating of dirt is so thick that they do not feel it,\" Jim Tucker said. \"Poor little beggars, most of them look as if they had not had a wash for the last month. The women are ugly enough, what you can see of them, and that is not much. What a rascally set the Europeans look! The Egyptians are gentlemen by the side of them. I fancy from what I have heard they are the sweepings of the European ports—Greeks, Italians,[88] Maltese, and French. When a fellow makes it too hot at home for the place to hold him, he comes over here— \"Ah! this is more like a town,\" he broke off as they entered the great square. \"My goodness! how hot the sun does blaze down here. I say, here is a refreshment place. Sorbette—Ices. It is lucky that they put the English. Come on, you fellows, an ice would be just the thing now.\" As they came out they were accosted by an Egyptian driver. \"Take a carriage, gentlemen? Drive to Sweet-water Canal. See the gardens.\" \"What do you say, Jack?\" Tucker asked. \"I suppose we may as well go there as anywhere else.\" \"Well, we will go there later, Tucker. One does get shade in the narrow streets; but there would be no fun in driving with this sun blazing down on us. By five o\u0027clock, when the sun gets a bit lower, it will be pleasant enough. I vote we go into the narrow streets, where we shall get shade, and see the natives in their own quarters.\" The others agreed, and turning out of the square they were soon in the lanes. \"This is not half as amusing as the Indian towns,\" Tucker said. \"Last voyage I went to Calcutta, and it is jolly in the natives\u0027 town there, seeing the natives squatting in their little shops, tinkering and tailoring, and all sorts of things. And such a crowd of them in the streets! This is a poor place in comparison, and most of the shops you see have European names over them. However, one gets the shade; that is something.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3175/87062.html","bookId":859,"book":{"id":859,"title":"A Chapter of Adventures","description":"简介： Of the tens of thousands of excursionists who every summer travel down by rail to Southend, there are few indeed who stop at Leigh, or who, once at Southend, take the trouble to walk three miles along the shore to the fishing village.
