{"id":111580,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry\u0027s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron\u0027s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron\u0027s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. \"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\" Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn\u0027t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making. \"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It\u0027s the crack of dawn.\" \"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It\u0027s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let\u0027s go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; we\u0027re going to be first off the mark this year--\" Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. \"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\" When he\u0027d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he\u0027d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand. \"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I\u0027ve got here! I\u0027ve had it developed, I wanted to show you--\" Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose. A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, Panting, against the white edge of the picture. \"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly. \"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I\u0027m in a hurry - Quidditch practice--\" He climbed through the portrait hole. \"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I\u0027ve never watched a Quidditch game before!\" Colin scrambled through the hole after him. \"It\u0027ll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement. \"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren\u0027t you, Harry? Weren\u0027t you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You must be brilliant. I\u0027ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\" Harry didn\u0027t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. \"I don\u0027t really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They\u0027re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\" \"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. \"Well, the Quaffle - that\u0027s the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they\u0027re three long poles with hoops on the end.\" \"And the fourth ball--\" \"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it\u0027s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that\u0027s what the Seeker\u0027s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn\u0027t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team\u0027s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\" \"And you\u0027re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren\u0027t you?\" said Colin in awe. \"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. \"And there\u0027s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That\u0027s it, really.\" But Colin didn\u0027t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I\u0027ll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands. The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. \"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference...\" Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\u0027s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet\u0027s shoulder and he began to snore. The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\" \"I\u0027ve got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn\u0027t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\" Wood wasn\u0027t pleased. \"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We\u0027re easily the best team. But unfortunately - owing to circumstances beyond our control--\" Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years. Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him. \"So this year, we train harder than ever before... Okay, let\u0027s go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed. They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands. \"Aren\u0027t you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously. \"Haven\u0027t even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood\u0027s been teaching us new moves.\" He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood\u0027s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. \"What\u0027s that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner. Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. \"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly. \"Who\u0027s that?\" said Fred. \"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin. \"What\u0027s going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why\u0027s that first year taking pictures? I don\u0027t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\" \"He\u0027s in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly. \"And the Slytherins don\u0027t need a spy, Oliver,\" said George. \"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily. \"Because they\u0027re here in person,\" said George, pointing. Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands. \"I don\u0027t believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We\u0027ll see about this!\" Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. \"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\" Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\" Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. \"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\" \"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I\u0027ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker\u0027. \" \"You\u0027ve got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\" And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. \"Aren\u0027t you Lucius Malfoy\u0027s son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike. \"Funny you should mention Draco\u0027s father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he\u0027s made to the Slytherin team.\" All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors\u0027noses in the early morning sun. \"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives -\" sweeps the board with them.\" None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits. \"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\" Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren\u0027t you playing? And what\u0027s he doing here?\" He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes. \"I\u0027m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone\u0027s just been admiring the brooms my father\u0027s bought our team. Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him. \"Good, aren\u0027t they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\" The Slytherin team howled with laughter. \"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \" They got in on pure talent.\" The smug look on Malfoy\u0027s face flickered. \"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,\" he spat. Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You\u0027ll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint\u0027s arm at Malfoys face. A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron\u0027s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass. \"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione. Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him. \"We\u0027d better get him to Hagrid\u0027s, it\u0027s nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. \"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can\u0027t you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. \"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold him still, Harry?\" \"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. \"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper\u0027s cabin came into view. \"You\u0027ll be all right in a minute - almost there--\" They were within twenty feet of Hagrid\u0027s house when the front door opened, but it wasn\u0027t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out. \"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly. \"It\u0027s a simple matter if you know what you\u0027re doing!\" Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I\u0027ll let you have a copy of my book. I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t already got one - I\u0027ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he strode away toward the castle. Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid\u0027s front door. They knocked urgently. Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was. \"Bin wonderin\u0027when you\u0027d come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again--\" Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn\u0027t seem perturbed by Ron\u0027s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair. \"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. \"Get em all up, Ron.\" \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That\u0027s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand--\" Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. \"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching Fang\u0027s ears. \"Givin\u0027me advice on gettin\u0027kelpies out of a well,\" growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \"Like I don\u0027know. An\u0027bangin\u0027on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I\u0027ll eat my kettle.\" It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts\u0027teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \"I think you\u0027re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job--\" \"He was the on\u0027y man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \"An\u0027I mean the on\u0027y one. Gettin\u0027very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren\u0027t too keen ter take it on, see. They\u0027re startin\u0027ter think it\u0027s jinxed. No one\u0027s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin\u0027ter curse?\" \"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must\u0027ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.\" \"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her Mudblood,\u0027Hagrid--\" Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. \"He didn\u0027!\" he growled at Hermione. \"He did,\" she said. \"But I don\u0027t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course--\" \"It\u0027s about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron, coming back up. \"Mudblood\u0027s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards - like Malfoy\u0027s family - who think they\u0027re better than everyone else because they\u0027re what people call pure-blood.\" He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it doesn\u0027t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom - he\u0027s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\" \"An\u0027they haven\u0027t invented a spell our Hermione can\u0027do,\" said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. \"It\u0027s a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It\u0027s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn\u0027t married Muggles we\u0027d\u0027ve died out.\" He retched and ducked out of sight again. \"Well, I don\u0027blame yeh fer tryin\u0027ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu\u0027maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. Spect Lucius Malfoy would\u0027ve come marchin\u0027up ter school if yeh\u0027d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.\" Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn\u0027t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn\u0027t; Hagrid\u0027s treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together. \"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I\u0027ve heard you\u0027ve bin givin\u0027out signed photos. How come I haven\u0027t got one?\" Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. \"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If Lockhart\u0027s still spreading that around--\" But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. \"I\u0027m on\u0027y jokin\u0027,\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn\u0027t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn\u0027need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin\u0027.\" \"Bet he didn\u0027t like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin. \"Don\u0027think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An\u0027then I told him I\u0027d never read one o\u0027his books an\u0027he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared. \"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\" \"Come an\u0027see what I\u0027ve bin growin\u0027,\" said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid\u0027s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. \"Gettin\u0027on well, aren\u0027t they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween feast... should be big enough by then.\" \"What\u0027ve you been feeding them?\" said Harry. Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone. \"Well, I\u0027ve bin givin\u0027them - you know - a bit o\u0027help--\" Harry noticed Hagrid\u0027s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid\u0027s old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn\u0027t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you\u0027ve done a good job on them.\" \"That\u0027s what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met her jus\u0027yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. \"Said she was jus\u0027lookin\u0027round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin\u0027she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He winked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn\u0027say no ter a signed--\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs. \"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins. It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions this evening.\" \"What\u0027re we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp. \"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\" Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school. \"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Oh n- Professor, can\u0027t I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry desperately. \"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o\u0027clock sharp, both of you.\" Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn\u0027t enjoy his shepherd\u0027s pie as much as he\u0027d thought. Both he and Ron felt they\u0027d got the worse deal. \"Filch\u0027ll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I\u0027m no good at Muggle cleaning.\" \"I\u0027d swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I\u0027ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart\u0027s fan mail... he\u0027ll be a nightmare...\" Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart\u0027s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked. The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him. \"Ah, here\u0027s the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in--\" Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk. \"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \"This first one\u0027s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine--\" The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart\u0027s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then he caught a phrase like, \"Fame\u0027s a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\" The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley\u0027s address. It must be nearly time to leave , Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time... And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart\u0027s prattle about his fans. It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. \"Come... come to me... Let me rip you... Let me tear you... Let me kill you...\" Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley\u0027s street. \"What?\" he said loudly. \"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!\" \"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\" \"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\" \"That - that voice that said - didn\u0027t you hear it?\" Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. \"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you\u0027re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We\u0027ve been here nearly four hours! I\u0027d never have believed it - the time\u0027s flown, hasn\u0027t it?\" Harry didn\u0027t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn\u0027t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left. It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\u0027t back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room. \"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed. \"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was it with Lockhart?\" Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard. \"And Lockhart said he couldn\u0027t hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \"D\u0027you think he was lying? But I don\u0027t get it - even someone invisible would\u0027ve had to open the door.\" \"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. \"I don\u0027t get it either.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-harry-potter-2/page-7.html","bookId":2071,"book":{"id":2071,"title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter #2)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter #2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.
