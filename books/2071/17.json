{"id":111586,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"He was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?\n He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\n Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\n Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard\u0027s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n \"Ginny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"Ginny - don\u0027t be dead - please don\u0027t be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny\u0027s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn\u0027t Petrified. But then she must be...\n \"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny\u0027s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n \"She won\u0027t wake,\" said a soft voice.\n Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.\n A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him.\n \"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\n Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry\u0027s face.\n \"What d\u0027you mean, she won\u0027t wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She\u0027s not - she\u0027s not -?\"\n \"She\u0027s still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\n Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.\n \"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\n \"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\"\n He pointed toward the floor near the statue\u0027s giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle\u0027s bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with.\n \"You\u0027ve got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny\u0027s head again. \"We\u0027ve got to get her out of here. There\u0027s a basilisk... I don\u0027t know where it is, but it could be along any moment... Please, help me.\"\n Riddle didn\u0027t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\n But his wand had gone.\n \"Did you see -?\"\n He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry\u0027s wand between his long fingers.\n \"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\n A smile curled the corners of Riddle\u0027s mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\n \"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny\u0027s dead weight. \"We\u0027ve got to go! If the basilisk comes--\"\n \"It won\u0027t come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\n Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.\n \"What d\u0027you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it--\"\n Riddle\u0027s smile broadened.\n \"You won\u0027t be needing it,\" he said.\n Harry stared at him.\n \"What d\u0027you mean, I won\u0027t be -?\"\n \"I\u0027ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\"\n \"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don\u0027t think you get it. We\u0027re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later--\"\n \"We\u0027re going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry\u0027s wand.\n Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here ...\n \"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\n \"Well, that\u0027s an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley\u0027s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\n \"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny\u0027s been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how -\" Riddle\u0027s eyes glinted \"- how she didn\u0027t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her...\"\n All the time he spoke, Riddle\u0027s eyes never left Harry\u0027s face. There was an almost hungry look in them.\n \"It\u0027s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one\u0027s ever understood me like you, Tom... I\u0027m so glad I\u0027ve got this diary to confide in... It\u0027s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket ...\"\n Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn\u0027t suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry\u0027s neck.\n \"If I say it myself, Harry, I\u0027ve always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her...\"\n \"What d\u0027you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n \"Haven\u0027t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib\u0027s cat.\"\n \"No,\" Harry whispered.\n \"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn\u0027t know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries... far more interesting, they became... Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry\u0027s horrified face, `I think I\u0027m losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don\u0027t know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can\u0027t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I\u0027ve got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\u0027m pale and I\u0027m not myself. I think he suspects me... There was another attack today and I don\u0027t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I\u0027m going mad... I think I\u0027m the one attacking everyone, Tom!\"\n Harry\u0027s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms.\n \"It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that\u0027s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn\u0027t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet...\"\n \"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\n \"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your whole fascinating history.\" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry\u0027s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust--\"\n \"Hagrid\u0027s my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you framed him, didn\u0027t you? I thought you made a mistake, but--\"\n Riddle laughed his high laugh again.\n \"It was my word against Hagrid\u0027s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student... on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls... but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn\u0027t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\n \"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippetto keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ...\"\n \"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted.\n \"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn\u0027t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn\u0027t going to waste those long years I\u0027d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin\u0027s noble work.\"\n \"Well, you haven\u0027t finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one\u0027s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again--\"\n \"Haven\u0027t I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods doesn\u0027t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been - you.\"\n Harry stared at him.\n \"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who\u0027d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\u0027s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ...\n \"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn\u0027t much life left in her... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you\u0027d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\"\n \"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched.\n \"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you - a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort\u0027s powers were destroyed?\"\n There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\n \"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was after your time...\"\n \"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter...\"\n He pulled Harry\u0027s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:\n TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\n Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:\n I AM LORD VOLDEMORT\n \"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father\u0027s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother\u0027s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\"\n Harry\u0027s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry\u0027s own parents, and so many others... At last he forced himself to speak.\n \"You\u0027re not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\n \"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.\n \"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn\u0027t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you\u0027re hiding these days--\"\n The smile had gone from Riddle\u0027s face, to be replaced by a very ugly look.\n \"Dumbledore\u0027s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\" he hissed.\n \"He\u0027s not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true.\n Riddle opened his mouth, but froze.\n Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\u0027s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\n A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock\u0027s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.\n A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\n The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\u0027s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.\n \"That\u0027s a phoenix.\" said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\n \"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird\u0027s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.\n \"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \"that\u0027s the old school Sorting Hat--\"\n So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry\u0027s feet.\n Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once.\n \"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\"\n Harry didn\u0027t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\n \"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added softly, \"the longer you stay alive.\"\n Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right... but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny... and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle\u0027s outline was becoming clearer, more solid... If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.\n \"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\" said Harry abruptly. \"I don\u0027t know myself. But I know why you couldn\u0027t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She stopped you killing me. And I\u0027ve seen the real you, I saw you last year. You\u0027re a wreck. You\u0027re barely alive. That\u0027s where all your power got you. You\u0027re in hiding. You\u0027re ugly, you\u0027re foul--\"\n Riddle\u0027s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that\u0027s a powerful countercharm. I can see now... there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That\u0027s all I wanted to know.\"\n Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle\u0027s twisted smile was widening again.\n \"Now, Harry, I\u0027m going to teach you a little lesson. Let\u0027s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him...\"\n He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying ...\n \"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.\"\n Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.\n Slytherin\u0027s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\n And something was stirring inside the statue\u0027s mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths.\n Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes\u0027wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don\u0027t leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?\n Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin\u0027s mouth. Then he heard Riddle\u0027s hissing voice:\n \"Kill him.\"\n The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing.\n Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming.\n There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars.\n He couldn\u0027t help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.\n The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\n Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake\u0027s tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\n \"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIM!\"\n The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\n \"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone...\"\n The snake\u0027s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face.\n The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry\u0027s arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk\u0027s tail swung over him again.\n Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me .\n There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\n Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry\u0027s head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.\n A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.\n \"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF - SMELL HIM.\"\n Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk\u0027s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous--\n It lunged blindly - Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry\u0027s side. He raised the sword in both his hands--\n The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true - Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent\u0027s mouth--\n But as warm blood drenched Harry\u0027s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\n Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\n A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.\n \"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes...\"\n He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent\u0027s fang had pierced him.\n He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.\n \"You\u0027re dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\u0027s voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore\u0027s bird knows it. Do you see what he\u0027s doing, Potter? He\u0027s crying.\"\n Harry blinked. Fawke\u0027s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n \"I\u0027m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I\u0027m in no hurry.\"\n Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n \"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\u0027s distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You\u0027ll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must...\"\n If this is dying, thought Harry, it\u0027s not so bad.\n Even the pain was leaving him...\n But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry\u0027s arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound - except that there was no wound.\n \"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle\u0027s voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away--\"\n Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry\u0027s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\n \"Phoenix tears...\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry\u0027s arm. \"Of course... healing powers... I forgot...\"\n He looked into Harry\u0027s face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter... you and me...\"\n He raised the wand ...\n Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry\u0027s lap - the diary.\n For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\n There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry\u0027s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then--\n He had gone. Harry\u0027s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\n Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he\u0027d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk\u0027s mouth.\n Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\n \"Harry - oh, Harry - I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn\u0027t say it in front of Percy - it was me, Harry - but I - I s-swear I d-didn\u0027t mean to - R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over - and - how did you kill that - that thing? W-where\u0027s Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the diary--\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle\u0027s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C\u0027mon, Ginny, let\u0027s get out of here--\"\n \"I\u0027m going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I\u0027ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I\u0027ll have to leave and - w-what\u0027ll Mum and Dad say?\"\n Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\n After a few minutes\u0027progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry\u0027s ears.\n \"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny\u0027s okay! I\u0027ve got her!\"\n He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall.\n \"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first. \"You\u0027re alive! I don\u0027t believe it! What happened?\" How - what - where did that bird come from?\"\n Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\n \"He\u0027s Dumbledore\u0027s,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself.\n \"How come you\u0027ve got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry\u0027s hand.\n \"I\u0027ll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\n \"But--\"\n \"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn\u0027t think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who\u0027d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \"Where\u0027s Lockhart?\"\n \"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \"He\u0027s in a bad way. Come and see.\"\n Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\n \"His memory\u0027s gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn\u0027t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He\u0027s a danger to himself.\"\n Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\n \"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn\u0027t it? Do you live here?\"\n \"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\n Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\n \"Have you thought how we\u0027re going to get back up this?\" he said to Ron.\n Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him.\n \"He looks like he wants you to grab hold...\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"But you\u0027re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there--\"\n \"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn\u0027t an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the others. \"We\u0027ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron\u0027s hand. Professor Lockhart--\"\n \"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\n \"You hold Ginny\u0027s other hand--\"\n Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry\u0027s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes\u0027s strangely hot tail feathers.\n An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was whipping through Harry\u0027s hair, and before he\u0027d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over - all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle\u0027s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.\n Myrtle goggled at them.\n \"You\u0027re alive,\" she said blankly to Harry.\n \"There\u0027s no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\n \"Oh, well... I\u0027d just been thinking... if you had died, you\u0027d have been welcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver.\n \"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle\u0027s grown fond of you! You\u0027ve got competition, Ginny!\"\n But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny\u0027s face.\n \"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.\n Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall\u0027s office.\n Harry knocked and pushed the door open. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-harry-potter-2/page-17.html","bookId":2071,"book":{"id":2071,"title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter #2) \n \n Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.
