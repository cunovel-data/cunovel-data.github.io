{"id":96268,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"The next evening Becky found me in the family room, A still in my pajamas, staring at a fiercely fanged and red-eyed Kiefer Sutherland on the TV with a box of tissues in my lap and clutching my eternity ring.\n \"She hasn\u0027t been out all day,\" my dad said to her. \"She won\u0027t say what\u0027s wrong, but I have a feeling it has to do with Alexander.\"\n \"What happened?\" Becky asked, sitting on the couch with me.\n \"Alexander hates me,\" I whimpered.\n \"He does not.\"\n \"We got into a fight.\"\n \"You two?\" she asked, surprised. \"I can\u0027t believe it. You never fight.\"\n When I noticed my dad was out of the room, I leaned in to Becky.\n \"I wanted to see if he\u0027d turn me - \" I whispered. \"And I pushed him too far.\"\n \"Did you make him bite you?\" she asked, seriously scared.\n \"No. But I asked him when he would. And I pressed him too hard.\"\n \"Alexander doesn\u0027t seem the type to get mad.\"\n \"He does get angry - but mostly at the Maxwells. Not usually at me.\"\n \"Well, maybe he was having a bad day - or night,\" she corrected.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I get so impatient. Having Stormy here has been so cool. I see her life like what it would have been for me if I were born a vampire. And with every passing day, I feel like I\u0027m missing out on being that person. Only when we had this fight, I realized ... this is who I am. I am a mortal dating a vampire. And if that is all I ever am, then I am still truly blessed. I want Alexander more than I want to be a vampire.\"\n \"Does he know that?\" she asked.\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t he?\"\n \"He\u0027s only human...\" Becky began. \"I mean, I guess he\u0027s not.\"\n We both laughed, though mine was through my pain.\n \"It has to be so hard to be a vampire,\" Becky continued. \"Now that I know the truth about Alexander, it really got me thinking lately. To be goth is hard enough. But imagine being a vampire. It doesn\u0027t matter where you are - you can\u0027t really be yourself.\"\n \"That\u0027s what Alexander says.\"\n \"He should know,\" she said gently. \"He\u0027s only protecting you, Raven. I would hope if Matt were in that position, he would want to protect me, too.\"\n \"Shouldn\u0027t Alexander be happy that I want to make the change with him?\"\n \"I can\u0027t imagine asking Matt to change me into something I\u0027m not. Anyway, out of all people, I thought you\u0027d want to be yourself.\"\n \"But you know I\u0027ve always wanted to be a vampire. Wouldn\u0027t you want to change into something you\u0027ve always wanted to become?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I thought I could talk about this with him.\"\n \"Maybe when you are together, he doesn\u0027t want to talk,\" she said coyly. \"Maybe he wants to turn you but wishes he didn\u0027t. And when you bring it up it only reminds him of the huge decision he will have to make someday.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want it if it\u0027s not with Alexander. Now I blew it. We can\u0027t break up.\" I wiped away a fresh round of tears. \"I\u0027ve lost everything!\"\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" Becky tried to comfort me. \"You aren\u0027t broken up.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He was really hurt.\"\n \"Let\u0027s go to his house. You can talk again, tell him how you feel. I\u0027m sure this will all blow over in a heartbeat.\" Becky helped me get myself together and handed me an outfit to wear. We got into her truck, and it felt like an eternity before we pulled up to the Mansion. I imagined our conversation. I\u0027d tell Alexander I was sorry, and he\u0027d refuse to see me anymore or agree that it was a big mistake. I was hoping for the latter. Becky waited in her truck while I jumped out, raced up the Mansion stairs, and pounded on the serpent knocker. The ring Alexander had given me shined in the streetlight.\n I\u0027d been so foolish to question him. He was a vampire and he needed me way more than I gave him credit for, and, as usual, I had made everything about myself.\n Now I was tortured, too, for my foolishness.\n Jameson finally came to the door.\n \"Is Alexander home?\"\n \"No, Miss Raven, he went out a few minutes ago.\"\n \"Did he say where he was going?\"\n \"No, but he did look like he was in a hurry.\"\n \"Who\u0027s there?\" I heard Stormy ask.\n \"It\u0027s Miss Raven.\" He opened the door wide enough for me to see Stormy at the bottom of the staircase. My makeup and charcoal eyeliner couldn\u0027t hide that I\u0027d been crying.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Stormy asked. She pulled me inside.\n \"Oh, nothing.\" I tried to be strong. \"Do you know where Alexander is?\"\n \"No. He was in his room all night and wouldn\u0027t talk. Did something happen?\"\n \"We got into a small fight.\"\n She took me by the hand and led me into the parlor room. \"Sit down,\" she said like a lady.\n I sat down feeling awful. I didn\u0027t have control over Alexander and how he felt about me - whether I\u0027d really pushed him too far or he just needed time to cool off. The pain of our separation was killing me.\n \"What happened?\" she asked.\n I wasn\u0027t sure what to say to his sister. She could change her mind about me and tell Alexander how he was more meant for Luna than he was for me. But I\u0027d gotten to know Stormy so well that I really thought we\u0027d bonded. And I was so distraught, I needed to talk to someone, and there weren\u0027t many people in tny n\u0027his town who I could talk to about the subject of vampire bites.\n \"I asked him about turning me,\" I said. \"And I think I pushed him too far.\"\n \"You should be able to talk to him about anything.\"\n \"You should be able to talk to him about anything.\"\n \"I thought so, too. But you know Alexander. He likes to be calm and rational. And I get impulsive, moody, and emotional.\"\n \"I do, too,\" she said.\n She put her arm around me. \"You have to know. It\u0027s because of you that Alexander didn\u0027t go back to Romania. It wasn\u0027t because he was mad at me because I told my parents where he was the night of the covenant ceremony. He stayed because he didn\u0027t want to leave you.\" I was comforted by Stormy\u0027s kind words. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"But I think I blew it, though. I\u0027m going to have him running home now.\"\n \"He\u0027s not like that. He gets angry and broods. He\u0027s a guy, after all.\"\n \"Where could he have gone?\" I asked.\n \"Maybe Sebastian knows.\" She hopped off the chair. \"We\u0027ll have to find out.\"\n I gave Stormy a big hug. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"You really are a great friend.\"\n She appeared truly pleased by my compliment and grabbed my hand as we headed down the staircase and out the front door.\n Stormy got into Becky\u0027s truck with me, and we headed to Sebastian\u0027s apartment. I hadn\u0027t been to it before but I knew where it was.\n Sebastian lived in a four-family unit in downtown Dullsville next to the Sugar and Spice restaurant.\n The Mustang was there - but not the Mercedes. It wasn\u0027t a good sign.\n I rang the bell a million times.\n \"Hey, dude, lay off the bell,\" we heard him say into the intercom.\n \"It\u0027s Raven. Is Alexander with you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Can we come up?\"\n \"We? Uh... Sure.\"\n The three of us tromped up the steps to Sebastian\u0027s door.\n \"Hey, ladies. What\u0027s up?\" Sebastian was standing in his jeans and with his hair damp as if he\u0027d just showered.\n \"Have you seen Alexander?\" I asked.\n \"No. What\u0027s up?\"\n \"We were just looking for him,\" Stormy said. \"Jameson said he went out, but we don\u0027t know where.\"\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked me. My eyes were still puffy; I felt like \"crybaby\" was written all over my face.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"They got in a fight,\" Stormy blurted out. \"And when I find him I\u0027m going to read him the riot act.\"\n \"You do that,\" Sebastian said with a chuckle.\n \"Maybe he went to the Crypt. I was supposed to meet him there later tonight.\"\n I sighed. Maybe Alexander was there. I wasn\u0027t looking forward to trying to reconcile in front of all the vampires of Dullsville, but I didn\u0027t have a choice. I wanted to make up regardless of how or where it happened.\n \"Off to the Crypt,\" Stormy said.\n \"Hey, wait up for me,\" Sebastian said, putting on a T-shirt and boots. \"I don\u0027t want to miss a thing.\" Becky drove us to the Crypt, with Sebastian following closely behind.\n When we arrived, I was anxious to find Alexander. We saw Onyx and Scarlet talking by the coffins.\n \"Is Alexander here?\" Sebastian asked.\n \"We haven\u0027t seen him,\" Onyx said.\n \"We have to find him,\" Stormy explained. \"It\u0027s very urgent.\"\n \"What\u0027s up?\" Scarlet asked.\n \"I just need to read him the riot act,\" she said.\n The girls laughed.\n \"He might be here somewhere,\" I suggested.\n \"I\u0027m going to hang here, dudes,\" Sebastian said. He sidled up to Onyx, who appeared glad to see him. \"I\u0027ll give you a buzz if he shows up.\" Becky, Stormy, and I headed into the Crypt, where we ran a younger clubster - Valentine. I wasn\u0027t sure if Stormy knew about Valentine and Billy\u0027s confrontation at our house. And I wasn\u0027t going to tell her about it now.\n \"Hey, Stormy!\" Valentine said.\n \"Hi, Valentine. Have you seen Alexander?\"\n \"No. Uh ... did Billy come with you guys?\" he asked.\n \"No,\" she said. \"We came to find Alexander.\"\n \"Great! While you\u0027re waiting for him to show, we can hang out.\"\n \"Uh, I really need to find him,\" she said.\n \"You have all night. We can hang out together. Want a drink?\"\n \"I\u0027m not thirsty.\" She was distracted, scanning the crowd for her brother.\n \"Well, I am,\" he teased. \"And it\u0027s not for anything served at the bar.\"\n It was odd to see Valentine flirt with Stormy.\n \"I\u0027ll go and look for him and catch up to you in a few,\" Becky said.\n \"Thank you,\" I mouthed to her. I, too, was scanning the crowd for Alexander, and I wasn\u0027t about to leave Stormy by herself in the club.\n \"Why don\u0027t we dance?\" Valentine asked Stormy.\n \"Maybe we can later,\" she answered.\n Valentine appeared disappointed, but that didn\u0027t stop him from trying other tactics. \"Do you want to play pinball? My brother just got a cool machine in today.\"\n \"Not now,\" Stormy said. \"We\u0027re on a mission.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad it\u0027ll just be us hanging out from now on,\" he whispered to her.\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Billy and Henry - \" I overheard him say.\n \"What about them?\"\n \"They\u0027re old news.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Ah, we don\u0027t really mix well together. After that night at Henry\u0027s. They could have really hurt us.\"\n \"But they didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Well, next time we might not be so lucky. Our kind needs to stick together.\"\n \"No, we don\u0027t. In fact, we need to branch out. And that\u0027s just what I am doing.\"\n \"No, we don\u0027t. In fact, we need to branch out. And that\u0027s just what I am doing.\"\n \"Are you going to tell him what you really are?\" he asked.\n \"No.\"\n \"What if he finds out?\" he continued to whisper. \"Raven knows. You think he wants to be one of us?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Of course you do. And how do you think he\u0027ll respond to taking a vampire to a dance?\"\n \"Is that what this is about? My going to the dance with Billy?\"\n Valentine did appear hurt when Stormy reiterated that she had gone with my brother to the fall dance. \"When he finds out about you, how do you think he\u0027ll really respond, Stormy?\"\n \"He won\u0027t find out!\" Stormy said.\n \"You have to be friends with our kind,\" he insisted.\n She looked at me. \"Raven isn\u0027t a vampire,\" she said. \"And she\u0027s dating one. Plus her friends are vampires. I want to be like Raven. I am a vampire and have mortal friends.\"\n She shot me a triumphant smile; I was so pleased to know that Stormy admired me in any way.\n \"Besides,\" she said strongly to Valentine, \"you can\u0027t tell me who I can or can\u0027t be friends with. And if that\u0027s the way you\u0027re going to be - then you aren\u0027t a true friend.\"\n She grabbed my arm. \"We have to go find Alexander,\" she said, and led me through a group of dancers.\n Just then Stormy spotted Luna standing by the bar.\n \"I need to talk to her,\" she said, storming over. I followed close behind.\n \"Hi, Stormy Girl!\" Luna squealed when she noticed the young Sterling. She opened her arms for a warm embrace but Stormy faced her with her hands on her hips.\"I thought you were my friend,\" she charged.\n \"I am.\" Luna was overly sincere.\n \"But why did Jagger lure Raven onto the altar?\" Stormy argued.\n Luna laughed as if the event were as mundane as getting pizza. \"You know my brother.\" Stormy wasn\u0027t softening. Instead she got angrier. \"But you were there, too. Why didn\u0027t you stop him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"It happened so fast.\"\n \"It did? It looked like it was something you both planned.\"\n \"Stormy,\" Luna said with an ultrasoft voice. \"This wasn\u0027t about you.\"\n \"But it was. Alexander\u0027s my brother. And Raven? She is like my older sister.\"\n Luna\u0027s blue eyes turned raging red. She quickly caught herself getting tense and tried to cover it up with a saccharine smile.\n \"Stormy,\" she began sweetly. \"You don\u0027t understand. You\u0027re just a kid.\"\n \"I understand. Everyone says they don\u0027t trust you. And I have a sense of people not to trust. Jagger. Trevor. But you? I really missed the mark. You really let me down.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Stormy,\" she said as kind as she could. \"I never meant to hurt you.\" I really thought Luna was telling her the truth, as if she hadn\u0027t thought out the ramifications of her actions that night.\n Jagger noticed us talking, and Stormy\u0027s stance gave off the appearance of a girls\u0027 feud. \"What\u0027s the commotion?\" he asked.\n I stared him down.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said to me. \"The offer isn\u0027t good anymore.\"\n When Jagger looked at Stormy, she wasn\u0027t budging, either. She stared up at the Maxwell twin with vehemence.\n \"Why did you do that to my family and friends?\" Stormy charged. \"Isn\u0027t it enough what you have here? This club? If it wasn\u0027t for Alexander, you wouldn\u0027t be here at all. You should be thanking him, not trying to stab him in the back.\"\n Both siblings were shocked at her words.\n Just then Valentine stepped out from behind us.\n \"So this is why you don\u0027t like me?\" he said to Stormy. His voice couldn\u0027t hide his sadness but instead gave it away. \"Because of them?\" t\u003d\" \"W\n \"No - \" she said to him, \"it\u0027s not about them. I do like you. But I want to have more friends.\"\n \"It is their fault,\" he insisted. Now Valentine was the one squaring off at his older siblings. \"You guys always have to make trouble. It\u0027s bad enough at home.\n But here, too? Why can\u0027t you leave well enough alone? Alexander likes Raven. Let them be.\"\n \"I was just trying to help Raven out,\" Jagger answered defensively.\n \"Well, you weren\u0027t,\" Stormy said. \"If you want to help her out, just be her friend. And Alexander\u0027s.\" I was so impressed with Stormy\u0027s arguments and sticking up for me in front of Jagger, I was speechless. But I\u0027d let her take over for long enough, and it was time for me to step in.\n \"Having a dance club is nice, but not if no one here is your friend,\" I said to Jagger.\n \"I don\u0027t need friends,\" Jagger mumbled. But clearly he did. He liked being the popular one in town now that he owned the club. He gazed out at the crowd as if he was really wondering how many of them he could call his friends.\n \"It\u0027s funny,\" he said as if we weren\u0027t in the room. \"I don\u0027t know these people. Even Onyx and Scarlet. They are all here because of the club.\" His voice was reflective and suddenly soft. \"Alexander has been a friend to me. I guess I really never realized it until now.\" Stormy relaxed her stance and appeared pleased with Jagger\u0027s reaction. And Luna was equally moved. She didn\u0027t want to be the only one who wasn\u0027t suddenly on the Sterling side.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Stormy,\" Luna said. \"I really am. I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you, of all people.\" I felt she seemed sincere. This time I think the example she was setting for her brother and her younger friend really hit her.\n \"Speaking of Alexander,\" Jagger said. \"Where is he? I\u0027d like to talk to him about that night.\"\n \"We were hoping he was here,\" I said. \"You haven\u0027t seen him?\"\n They shook their heads.\n \"Were you supposed to meet him here?\" Jagger asked.\n \"Uh, no. I just thought he might show up.\"\n \"Well, maybe we can dance until he does,\" Valentine said to Stormy.\n \"Uh ... that would be great. But I really want to find him.\"\n Valentine appeared deflated, and Stormy put her hand on his shoulder. \"But the next dance is all yours,\" she said to her lifelong friend.\n His sullen face brightened.\n \"If you see Alexander, tell him I need to speak with him,\" she said to the Maxwells. \"Immediately.\" They nodded affirmatively and gave her a smile.\n They nodded affirmatively and gave her a smile.\n We scanned every corner of the Crypt and finally saw Becky.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen him anywhere,\" my best friend finally said.\n \"Neither have we.\" I was disheartened. \"Well, I guess we should go.\"\n We left the club, and Becky drove us back to the Mansion to drop off Stormy.\n \"When Alexander gets home,\" Stormy said, \"I\u0027ll give him a good talking to.\"\n I leaned over and gave Stormy a big hug. She had become a really good friend to me, and I cherished her.\n As we drove to my house, it began to pour. Becky dropped me off in the driveway.\n \"Thanks, Becky. I\u0027ll let you know if I hear anything.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Raven. It will be okay. Someday you\u0027ll look back on this time and barely remember it.\"\n \"I hope so,\" I said, and dashed to the house.\n There was one final place where I thought Alexander might be. I hoped I was right.\n I hopped on my bike and tore down the road in the sprinkling rain. By the time I got to Dullsville\u0027s cemetery, it was pouring. I was drenched and my boots were soaked. But I didn\u0027t care. When I turned into the parking lot, I saw the sight I\u0027d been longing to see - the Mercedes.\n The cemetery was closed, and the gates were locked. Normally, climbing the fence wasn\u0027t too hard for me; I\u0027d done it a million times. But tonight, the pounding rain made it hard to see and the wrought-iron posts were slippery. I grabbed them as tightly as I could but slid several times. With a few curse words and all my might, I wrapped my fingers and wedged my boots into the grooves and hoisted myself up.\n I flipped myself over and lost my footing on the slick fence. I fell on my bottom on the wet grass with a thud. I swore some more and then laughed at myself. If I had only been patient, I wouldn\u0027t have been in this mess. Alexander and I would have been bopping at the Crypt, and I would have received romantic kisses, not solitude. Instead, I was on my backside in the mud in the graveyard. chasing after my angry boyfriend.\n I got to my feet and didn\u0027t even bother trying to beautify myself. It was far too late for that.\n I raced through the cemetery - past tombstones and memorials. And then I saw a figure standing in front of the Baroness Sterling\u0027s monument.\n Even in the pouring rain and with his back to me, Alexander was a magnetic presence.\n I knew he sensed me standing a few yards away.\n \"I\u0027m sorry - \" I called to him through the falling rain. \"I didn\u0027t mean for us to fight.\" He didn\u0027t respond or look at me.\n \"Alexander - \" I said. \"Please understand.\"\n He slowly turned around. He was gorgeous, wearing skinny black jeans, monster boots, and a black T-shirt. He was soaking, like me, and even though he was angry, he was still as radiant as the handsome guy I\u0027d fallen in love with. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was going to yell or walk away.\n Instead, he just stared at me with his soft chocolate eyes.\n I hurried over to him but didn\u0027t hug him. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was ready for me to.\n \"I never meant to hurt you - \" I said. \"I didn\u0027t want us to fight. I just wanted us to talk. It got out of hand. I never meant for us to get angry.\" Alexander didn\u0027t respond but just listened.\n \"I looked for you everywhere - \" I said. \"At the Mansion, Sebastian\u0027s, the Crypt. I was ready to fly to Romania,\" I said, my voice breaking.\n He still didn\u0027t respond but continued to let me talk.\n Before our fight, I knew Alexander hadn\u0027t planned on leaving me, and I was immature to think he needed to sink his fangs in my flesh to prove that to me. I faced him strongly and sincerely. \"I want to be a vampire,\" I said. \"Your vampire - and if it is to happen, it needs to happen when we both are ready. If not, I am happy the way we are.\"\n He listened to what I said but still didn\u0027t respond.\n \"Please say something - \" I said.\n He didn\u0027t yell at me or even kiss me. Instead he took my hand in his and gazed down at me and took a deep breath. His voice was deliberate. \"Raven.\" My heart fell. Was this the moment Alexander was officially going to break up with me? I had pushed him too far this time.\n He gazed at me intently. \"I\u0027ve been thinking.\"\n \"About what?\" I asked, worried. \"Wait, Alexander, please don\u0027t say it - I came here to apologize.\"\n \"It\u0027s important for me to tell you this now,\" he said with a deliberate but urgent tone.\n \"No,\" I said. \"I came here to make up, not break up.\"\n He placed his finger over my black lips and shook his head. \"Now it\u0027s my turn to speak.\" I took a deep breath and squeezed his hand. I didn\u0027t want to let go under any circumstance.\n \"There is something I want to talk about.\" His voice was so serious, I was frightened. The rain broke, and the crescent moon shone brightly overhead. \"You are so much like my grandmother. If she had been changed, then maybe her fate would have been different. I don\u0027t want to see you at covenant altars with other vampires. Only me.\"\n He leaned in to me and gazed so intensely that I thought I could see his soul. \"I want you to know I thought about it that first night I saw you outside my house on Halloween. And I\u0027ve thought about it every night since then.\"\n \"Thought about what?\" I asked.\n \"Turning you.\"\n I melted. To hear it from his lips sent chills surging through me. I shouldn\u0027t have needed him to reassure me countless times. However, I did like hearing it.\n \"You\u0027ve told me you have thought about it, and I should have listened. But I shouldn\u0027t have pushed you. I just want us to be like we were again. I don\u0027t want us to argue. I want us to be together. Like we discussed, I\u0027ll be turned when the time is right.\" He took both of my hands. His rain-soaked hair was tousled and wild and his sexy dark eyes stared through me again. \"I want you to know I think the time is right.\"\n I was stunned. \"What did you say?\" I asked.\n He leaned in even closer. \"I think the time is right,\" he said with confidence. \"For you to be turned. By me.\" I was floored. I wasn\u0027t sure I was hearing him correctly. \"Are you serious?\" I had been waiting for him to call our relationship off and he was suggesting the opposite. I couldn\u0027t believe what I was hearing.\n \"Dead serious,\" he said with a heavenly smile. \"I think th listenee time is right for us to be together - forever. In fact, I know it is.\" I didn\u0027t know how to respond. I was so taken aback, I was speechless.\n He smiled a gorgeous smile. \"You have waited for me,\" he said sincerely, \"and I have waited for you. Now we need to stop waiting.\" I was awestruck. I stared up at my vampire boyfriend. Was Alexander actually suggesting what I thought he was? What I\u0027d wanted since I was little and even more so when I met him? Was this in fact the moment I had waited for all my life?\n My hands began to shake and I felt as if I were in a movie. Time seemed to stand still. A vampire - the most gorgeous and mysterious one in all the world - was asking me to be his vampire mate for all of eternity. I was still at a loss for words.\n \"Have you changed your mind?\" he asked, suddenly concerned.\n \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"I just can\u0027t believe this is really happening. Is this a dream?\" I asked.\n \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"I just can\u0027t believe this is really happening. Is this a dream?\" I asked.\n \"If it is,\" he said with a sweet grin, \"then I\u0027m having the same dream.\"\n I was overcome with delight.\n \"So what is your answer?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t think I can wait forever for that. The suspense is killing me.\"\n \"Of course!\" I burst out, and hugged him with all my might. \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\"\n As we embraced, the pain of our fight escaped my body and the excitement of his proposal began running through it.\n \"I don\u0027t want you to be afraid,\" he said. \"If you want to change your mind - at any point - I will understand.\"\n \"How could I be afraid?\" I wondered.\n \"I\u0027m a vampire, remember. And you\u0027d be one as well.\"\n The thought of my really becoming a vampire sent more chills through me. \"I\u0027m not afraid of you, or of becoming like you,\" I said. \"Not now, nor will I ever be. This is what I\u0027ve always wanted.\"\n He smiled another gorgeous smile. We stared at each other, then he drew me in to him again and kissed me long. My knees were weak, but my heart raced and I was dizzy.\n \"Are we going to do it now?\" I asked excitedly. I didn\u0027t want to lose this moment by putting it off, but since I\u0027d envisioned being turned by him so many times, I wasn\u0027t sure if I needed more preparation for the actual event. \"I imagined wearing a pretty dress ... not looking like a slug. But I a se\u003d\"3can do it now if you want.\"\n \"We don\u0027t have to do it tonight,\" he said, guiding my dampened hair away from my face. \"We can wait as long as you like.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to wait too long,\" I said eagerly.\n \"This will change your life,\" he said. \"You still have school.\"\n \"School? Schmool!\"\n \"But that is just as important.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to wait until I\u0027m finished with school. That\u0027s more than a year away,\" I said impatiently. Then something important came to mind. There was one new person I\u0027d want to see me change and she wasn\u0027t going to be in Dullsville much longer. \"I\u0027d really like to be turned while Stormy is still here. I\u0027d like her to see me as a vampire. I want her to see me like I see her.\"\n \"She means that much to you?\" he asked.\n \"You both do.\"\n \"But she\u0027s leaving next week.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"But you still have classes, and your education is important.\"\n \"I can go to night classes. Or take online courses. Or even Jameson can teach me. I\u0027ll be homeschooled like you,\" I suggested. Now that Alexander was on board, I wasn\u0027t going to let anything get in our way.\n \"I thought - but what about your parents? Do you think they are going to be happy about this?\"\n \"They won\u0027t understand at first. And they\u0027ll be angry. But I\u0027ll still be their daughter. I\u0027ll still live in Dullsville and graduate high school and go to college. And they were hippies. If anyone understands being different, it\u0027s them. I\u0027ll just have to remind them.\"\n \"We will have challenges,\" he said.\n \"I know. But if we are together, then we can take them on, together.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never met anyone like you.\" He drew me in again and kissed me passionately.\n Then we sat on a bench in the cemetery and made up for the time we\u0027d lost being apart with kisses and making plans for our future. I was like a girl who had just got engaged. I was completely overwhelmed by the moment and the promise of my life with my one true love. I held and squeezed Alexander harder than I ever had before and became magically lost in his lips as I cherished that I was soon to become his vampire mate. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-19.html","bookId":2147,"book":{"id":2147,"title":"Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9) \n Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling is coming to Dullsville, and Raven is both excited and panicked in anticipation of Alexander\u0027s little sister\u0027s visit.
