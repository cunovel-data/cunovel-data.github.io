{"id":96263,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Valentine left, and after we dropped Billy off at home, Alexander drove me and Stormy back to the Mansion. When we got inside, Alexander talked privately to Stormy in her room while I waited in the library. When they were finished, he went to get a drink and I found her hanging out on her chaise longue, cuddling Phantom. She wasn\u0027t smiling. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked. \"Alexander doesn\u0027t want me to see your brother or Henry anymore.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll talk to him.\" \"I keep letting Alexander down. I hate disappointing him.\" \"Me too. I think he brings that out in people.\" \"He\u0027ll want to send me home if someone finds out about us. The garlic, the mirrors. Bringing blood to Hatsy\u0027s Diner.\" \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll want you to go home so soon. Are you homesick?\" I asked. \"No,\" she said. \"Just the opposite. I want to stay here forever.\" \"I want you to stay, too,\" I said sincerely. \"You\u0027d like that?\" \"Yes.\" \"But I thought I was getting in the way of you and Alexander.\" \"No, I like doing stuff with all of us.\" \"You are just saying that.\" \"I am not, silly.\" \"But I know he\u0027s really frustrated with me. We came so close to Billy and Henry finding out about Valentine and me. That\u0027s why he wants me to stay away from them and only hang out with Valentine - because I can be myself with him.\" \"That\u0027s not right,\" I said. \"Besides, I don\u0027t think my brother thinks you are a vampire,\" I reassured her. \"It\u0027s one of the reasons my parents keep me at home and only let me spend time with other vampires. Everyone\u0027s afraid I\u0027ll spill the family secrets.\" \"Well, that\u0027s no way to live.\" \"But if people find out about us, they will fear us and persecute us. Like they did when my grandmother moved here to this Mansion. And she was just a mortal married to a vampire. Not everyone understands,\" she said. \"Why do you?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I was just born that way.\" \"I guess I was, too.\" \"It would be hard for me not to tell the world if I were a vampire,\" I said. \"Really? That\u0027s how I feel!\" \"Yes, I\u0027d want to shout it from the rooftops.\" \"You would?\" she asked. \"I just want to be myself.\" \"I know that must be very difficult.\" \"I don\u0027t like to hide away in our Mansion. I want to live and breathe. I want to explore the world and have friends.\" \"But someone as cool as you must have a lot of friends.\" \"I only have vampire friends. And not too many of those. Luna was one of my friends. Even though she was older and even when she was mortal. She understood because her family members are all vampires.\" \"Then maybe you should see her here,\" I said. \"I guess Alexander and I wanted to be with you so much we didn\u0027t give you enough time to spend with her.\" \"Really?\" she asked. \"You wanted to hang out with me?\" \"Of course! I\u0027ve had a blast.\" She smiled sweetly. \"And I know my brother has had a great time, too,\" I confirmed. \"You should have friends your own age.\" \"And Billy, he looks at me oddly sometimes. Like he\u0027s trying to figure me out.\" \"He\u0027s probably looking at you because he thinks you are pretty.\" \"He does? He said that?\" \"Yes.\" She sat up, excited. \"What did he say?\" \"That someone as pretty as you shouldn\u0027t be afraid of mirrors.\" Her soft brown eyes widened. \"That\u0027s the sweetest thing I ever heard!\" She beamed. \"I want to see Billy and Henry. I want to have friends that are mortals.\" She looked at me desperately. Really? \"You will,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll make sure of that.\" \"Really?\" she said. \"Yes, I\u0027ll talk with Alexander.\" She leaned in and wrapped her arms around my waist. She squeezed me so hard I could barely breathe. Then she laid her head on my lap. \"I felt differently about you when I first met you. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d like you. I was mad that you weren\u0027t Luna. And I was mad that Alexander stayed here and didn\u0027t return home to our family. I blamed you.\" \"I know,\" I said, stroking her hair. \"Are you angry at me for that?\" \"You\u0027d have to do a lot more for me to be angry with you. Besides, I\u0027d be mad if someone kept me away from Alexander, too.\" \"You really like him, don\u0027t you?\" I nodded my head. Even though there were a few more hours to sunrise, her eyelids were fighting to stay open. The pain of the evening wore on her. \"I want you to be a vampire, like me,\" she said. \"I want you to be a vampire, like me,\" she said. \"I do, too,\" I said to her, but she had already drifted off to sleep. I found Alexander in the TV room watching Dark Shadows. \"We can\u0027t keep Stormy away from Billy and Henry,\" I said to him. \"I think it\u0027s for the best. What else can I do? Send her home?\" \"No, let her have fun. Let her spread her bat wings,\" I said lightly. \"She really is starved for friends as much as she is for blood. You said that yourself.\" \"I know. But tonight, when I thought she\u0027d eaten garlic... I\u0027m still shaking.\" I gave him a hug. \"I know it\u0027s hard for you. You want to protect her from the mortal world. You want to protect me from the Underworld. And in the end, it will only make all of us unhappy.\" \"But what can I do?\" he asked. \"I can\u0027t watch her twenty-four seven. At least when she\u0027s with Valentine or even Luna, they know all the secrets. I don\u0027t have to worry about that.\" \"But there are things she\u0027s missing. She can\u0027t live in your parents\u0027 mansion in Romania forever. Someday, like you, she\u0027ll gro, sidth\u003d\"2ew up and move. She has to adapt and she has to learn how. You can help her do that.\" Alexander realized that he could be the one to be instrumental in his sister\u0027s growth. This time he hugged me. \"You are really a great friend to me, besides being my hot girlfriend.\" \"I try,\" I said, kissing him long. \"So what are we going to do now?\" he asked. \"I can think of a few things,\" I said with a coy grin, \"but they don\u0027t involve siblings.\" When Alexander drove me home, we saw Valentine skateboarding down the street away from my house. When I got inside, I found Billy in the family room. \"What was Valentine doing here?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve got to talk to you,\" Billy said urgently. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"Valentine told me I had to stop hanging out with Stormy.\" I could hear the agitation in his voice. \"What? He came over to say that?\" \"He asked if I knew about Stormy, and I asked what he meant. He asked if I knew anything unusual about her, and I said, \u0027Yes, she\u0027s afraid of mirrors.\u0027\" \"Then what did he say?\" \"He seemed relieved at first. But then he got all threatening. He told me that Henry and I shouldn\u0027t hang out with her anymore.\" \"He\u0027s not your father or Stormy\u0027s.\" \"I know, that\u0027s what I told him.\" \"And what did he say?\" \"That I\u0027m not like her and by hanging out with her I could put her in danger.\" He laughed. \"Me, dangerous?\" I laughed, too. \"Then he asked to read my blood.\" I stopped laughing. \"Did you let him?\" \"No. I was angry at him. That\u0027s not right for him to come over here and boss me around. Besides, what business is it of his who she hangs out with?\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad you stood up for yourself.\" \"I think I know why he\u0027s acting like that.\" \"You do?\" I asked skeptically. \"Yes. I think he\u0027s in love with Stormy, and he\u0027s threatened by me and Henry spending time with her. They were close friends in Romania, but now she has learned there is more to life than guys with black fingernails and white hair.\" I couldn\u0027t help but crack a smile. \"I think you are right,\" I said, nudging my little brother in the arm. \"Well, there\u0027s one person you and Henry won\u0027t be hanging out with anymore,\" I said. \"And he just skated down the street.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-14.html","bookId":2147,"book":{"id":2147,"title":"Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9)","description":"Storyline: Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9) Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling is coming to Dullsville, and Raven is both excited and panicked in anticipation of Alexander\u0027s little sister\u0027s visit.
