I was so afraid I\u0027d dreamed it that I texted Alexander a million times to reassure myself that it was real. It was, and it was going to be for all the right reasons.\\n\\n What would I wear? Who would I invite? When would it happen?\\n\\n The following evening, I met Alexander at the Mansion. As Stormy was eating, I sneaked a kiss with him upstairs in his attic room. \"I\u0027d like to invite Becky,\" I said.\"I figured you\u0027d want to include the world.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" I said. \"Everyone I\u0027ve ever met.\"\\n\\n \"You have to understand, many people might not want this to happen.\"\\n\\n \"You mean like Jagger and Luna?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"They are not going to ruin my night!\"\\n\\n \"They aren\u0027t going to ruin anything anymore,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s told me. But I just wanted you to know...\"\\n\\n \"That it\u0027s still hard to trust them?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know...\"\\n\\n \"Then we should probably keep this a secret,\" I suggested. \"Make it private. It\u0027s the only way.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you might be right,\" he said, caressing my hair.\\n\\n \"Is that how you imagined it? Just us?\"\\n\\n \"No - but in this case, it might be for the best. If word gets out...\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Are you okay with that?\" he wondered.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want anyone to stop this. And isn\u0027t it really between us?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I want this to be a beautiful night for you.\"\\n\\n \"It will be. Just having you there. That\u0027s all I need.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be there. You can count on that.\"\\n\\n But then I thought about the ceremony I\u0027d always imagined. And it was missing someone who had been by my side since third grade.\\n\\n For a moment I looked away. Alexander took my chin and drew me back to him. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just that I really want Becky there - \" I confessed.\\n\\n He smiled. \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"You do?\"\\n\\n \"I think she should be there.\"\\n\\n I gave him a huge hug. When we released our grip, he seemed as if he wanted to say something more.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I think Sebastian should be there as well.\"\\n\\n Now a smile overcame my face. \"Of course he should be there. I can\u0027t wait, Alexander. This is going to be wonderful.\" He seemed equally excited.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll set everything up,\" he said, gazing into my eyes. \"The altar, the coffin, the ceremonial goblets.\"\\n\\n \"What can I bring?\"\\n\\n \"Just yourself.\" He touched my cheek with the back of his hand. \"I\u0027d like you to come to the cemetery just after sunset,\" he continued. \"I\u0027ll need some time to get ready for you and arrive myself.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t be late,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And then we will finally be together - as we both have always imagined.\" He gave me a long, tender kiss that sent tingles down my spine.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to find a dress,\" I said. \"One that you\u0027ll remember for eternity. Did you tell Stormy?\" I asked my boyfriend.\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d want us to tell her together,\" he said.\\n\\n I was so pleased with Alexander\u0027s sensitivity. Stormy had originally wanted Alexander to bond with Luna. But now that she saw Luna\u0027s true colors, she might be happy that I was the one who was going to the altar with her brother after all.\\n\\n Alexander grabbed my hand and led me down the attic stairs, then the main ones. We found Stormy petting Phantom and reading a fashion mag in the parlor while Jameson was in the kitchen cleae k align\u003d\"juning up from dinner.\\n\\n Alexander sat down beside her and I sat on the other side of him.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\" she said. \"Is something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Alexander said, putting his arm around her. \"I just wanted to let you know - Raven and I are going to have a ceremony.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of ceremony?\" she asked quizzically.\\n\\n \"The covenant kind,\" he replied.\\n\\n Her eyes widened and she looked at me. \"You are going to be turned?\" She was as excited as she was surprised. \"You really are going to do it?\" I nodded.\\n\\n \"This is so fabulous!\" she said. \"Can I come?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d like you to be there,\" Alexander said. \"In fact, Raven wants to do this while you are here. That is why we are going ahead with it so soon.\"\\n\\n \"That is so sweet!\" Stormy rose and gave Alexander a hug, then gave me a loving embrace. \"Will Billy be my date?\"\\n\\n \"Uh ... no,\" Alexander said. \"That\u0027s what we want to talk to you about. This is going to be private.\"\\n\\n \"Mother and Father won\u0027t be there?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"We want to do this soon. There isn\u0027t time. We are also inviting Sebastian and Becky. But that\u0027s all. We don\u0027t want word to get out. You know how the Maxwells can be.\"\\n\\n \"I see that now. My lips are sealed,\" Stormy said. \"I am so happy you\u0027ll finally be like me.\" I was so flattered that Stormy was so pleased. I couldn\u0027t wait to be part of their family.\\n\\n I was so flattered that Stormy was so pleased. I couldn\u0027t wait to be part of their family.\\n\\n \"What will I wear?\" she wondered.\\n\\n \"You can wear the dress you wore to the fall dance,\" I told her.\\n\\n \"What will you wear?\" she asked me.\\n\\n \"I have only a short time to figure that out,\" I said. \"But will you be the flower girl? We need someone to scatter the dead black roses.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m your ghoul,\" she said with a wink.\\n\\n And with that, we finished the evening with some smoothies, knowing in just a few more days, I\u0027d be requiridastian anng the Romanian kind.\\n\\n I looked at the world with almost vampire eyes as I awoke the next day and headed off to school. This was routine to me - drag myself out of bed, cower from the bright sun, take an all-too-short shower, get dressed in my brooding attire, and spend my day at school watching the clock until the final bell rang. In two days, however, I wouldn\u0027t be waking up in the daylight but going to bed just before it. I wouldn\u0027t be going to school and having to suffer through mundane subjects or lessons with teachers who favored the popular students. Instead, Jameson would tutor me one-on-one in subjects that interested me. I wouldn\u0027t have to take Trevor Mitchell\u0027s harassment anymore. Instead of seeing him, I\u0027d be seeing Alexander.\\n\\n As I breezed through the hallway, we passed the Prada-bees, who stared at me with their usual contempt.\\n\\n \"Hi, Heather. Hi, Courtney,\" I said gleefully.\\n\\n \"Uh ... hi, Raven.\"\\n\\n \"I like your purse,\" I said truthfully to Courtney, who was holding a bright blue designer satchel. \"It matches your eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Uh ... thanks, I guess.\"\\n\\n When we turned the corner, I saw my nemesis slink down the corridor as if he were a teacher instead of a student.\\n\\n \"Hi, Trevor,\" I said when he got closer.\\n\\n He looked at me skeptically. \"Uh ... hi. Did you have something you want to tell me?\"\\n\\n \"No, just wanted to say hello.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s very unlike you. You wouldn\u0027t be planning something sinister, would you?\"\\n\\n \"No, something wonderful.\"\\n\\n \"Not egging my locker? Or keying my car?\"\\n\\n \"No. Not those things at all.\"\\n\\n I stretched my arms out and before he could retreat, I leaned in and gave my nemesis a long hug.\\n\\n His body eventually melted into mine. It was bizarre to be standing in school hugging Trevor Mitchell. But I really meant it. There was warmth that flowed from me to him and vice versa. Though we had had our fights and tormented each other, I had known him since we were in kindergarten. Besides my family, it was the longest relationship I\u0027d had in my life. And though it was mostly negative, I could always count on him being there for me - to judge, bother, and pester me. And through those years, I gave it back to him each time. And for a moment, in the middle of the hallway at Dullsville High, we came together as one.\\n\\n I released our embrace and gazed up into his green, surprised eyes. Then I left him standing there watching me and wondering what had just happened as I walked to class.\\n\\n For the first time since attending school, I really listened to my teachers. Some continued to be boring, but most were really passionate about the lessons. Maybe they had things to teach me all these years. And today, the teachers and their lectures really meant something to me, and after each class I went up to them and told them that, leaving each one shocked and confused.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been acting funny all day. What is going on?\" Becky asked when we got into her truck after school and I told her to drive to Evans Park.\\n\\n \"Swear to secrecy?\" I asked her when we sat down on our favorite swings. \"You can\u0027t tell anyone.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try.\" She appeared concerned.\\n\\n \"Alexander is going to turn me.\"\\n\\n Becky gasped. \"Are you kidding?\"\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s really going to happen.\"\\n\\n \"When?\" she asked, still shocked.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night.\"\\n\\n \"Then you will be - \"\\n\\n \"What I\u0027ve always wanted to be.\"\\n\\n \"But I thought you were going to wait. Until college,\" she said as the news sunk in.\\n\\n \"I promise nothing will change.\"\\n\\n \"What about school?\" Becky was concerned.\\n\\n \"Alexander told me I can be homeschooled by Jameson. You can come over, too.\"\\n\\n \"But who will I eat lunch with?\"\\n\\n \"Matt.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t bear to be without you, Raven,\" she blurted out.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure how Becky would take the news, but I kind of knew it might be hard.\\n\\n \"Me too,\" I said, tears welling in my eyes.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m happy for you but sad for me.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t think of it that way. You are so much more popular in school now. You are dating a jock. A handsome and nice one.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027ve always been there.\"\\n\\n \"And I always will be. You can still drag me to games, and we can do our homework together at night. It\u0027s really only a few daylight hours that we\u0027ll miss.\"\\n\\n \"The ones that you missed with Alexander, now we\u0027ll miss.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not choosing him over you or anything like that,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I know. But we\u0027ve been friends since third grade. It\u0027s just going to be a big change.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen you grow,\" I told my best friend. \"You don\u0027t need me like you did.\"\\n\\n \"I always will. We\u0027re best friends.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we are. That won\u0027t change. I want you to be there when it happens,\" I said. \"I need you, too.\"\\n\\n \"Me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you and Sebastian. You are the only ones we are inviting. And Stormy, of course.\" Becky smiled as if she was pleased to be the one I was inviting and excited that she\u0027d be there to share it, too. \"This is scary - and amazing. I can\u0027t believe this will really be happening,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I know, me too.\"\\n\\n \"What do I do?\" she asked worriedly. \"What do I wear?\"\\n\\n \"You can wear whatever you want,\" I said, trying to calm her down. \"Whatever you feel comfortable in.\" She began to spin, trying to think of outfits. \"I have a new dress that I bought for fall.\" She began to spin, trying to think of outfits. \"I have a new dress that I bought for fall.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you want.\"\\n\\n \"But what happens at the ceremony?\"\\n\\n \"Alexander and I will be at the altar. We\u0027ll stand by a coffin. There will be two goblets and some candles. He\u0027ll say some words in Romanian about our lives together, and then we\u0027ll drink from the cups.\"\\n\\n \"Okay ... then what?\"\\n\\n \"Then he\u0027ll bite me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, geez,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.\"\\n\\n \"It will be okay, really.\" I took her hand.\\n\\n \"I know ... but it\u0027s not something I\u0027m used to. I\u0027m used to seeing people kiss at the end of a ceremony.\" We both laughed, her nervously and me with excitement.\\n\\n \"And then what happens?\" she asked as I withdrew my hand.\\n\\n \"Hopefully, I\u0027ll be a vampire.\"\\n\\n \"Just like that?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you afraid?\"\\n\\n \"Me? Afraid?\" I said. \"Just of not being one.\"\\n\\n \"It will be hard,\" she said, \"but I\u0027ll be there.\"\\n\\n We rose from our swings. She gave me a huge hug, and I knew then what I always had known since third grade - that I had the best friend on earth.\\n\\n Dullsville had several stores to buy wedding, prom, and other special-occasion dresses but none that catered to cemetery covenant ceremonies. I had to think hard and fast on where to find one. I didn\u0027t have time to order one online or to find the fabric and make the perfect dress. One place came to my mind: Jack\u0027s Department Store. I\u0027d shopped there before and last year had found a dress left over from Halloween to wear for the first dance Alexander and I attended together -\\n\\n the Snow Ball. I was hoping I\u0027d get lucky again.\\n\\n Becky drove me to Jack\u0027s and I did a quick tour of the junior department.\\n\\n \"Nothing suitable for the cemetery,\" I told Becky. She agreed.\\n\\n \"Halloween is over,\" the clerk said when I asked her about any costumes they might have in stock.\\n\\n Becky was cowering behind me as I challenged the saleslady. \"But don\u0027t you have anything left over? On clearance? In the back?\" I was desperate.\\n\\n She shrugged her shoulders. She obviously didn\u0027t want to put herself out. But then I saw Jack Patterson, the owner of the store. He held a special place in his heart for me since I helped him sneak into the Mansion for a high school initiation when he was a senior and I was twelve.\\n\\n \"Raven. How are you?\" he asked with that same handsome smile he had when I helped him get inside the Mansion.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. How are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"And Becky. It\u0027s great to see you, t to tour oo.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Jack. It\u0027s so nice to see you.\"\\n\\n Jack was Matt\u0027s uncle, and he was familiar with my best friend as well.\\n\\n \"So what brings you ladies here today?\" he asked in a pleasant voice.\\n\\n \"A dress.\" I couldn\u0027t possibly tell him what I needed the dress for, only that I needed one. \"I\u0027m looking for a Halloween dress. I was hoping you had something left over. It\u0027s only been a few weeks.\"\\n\\n He paused. \"We had some in back last time I looked,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go check.\"\\n\\n I felt like a ray of moonlight hit me. We followed him into the stockroom, and he searched through men\u0027s clothes and a few women\u0027s winter dresses.\\n\\n \"Ah yes,\" he said. \"Is this what you are looking for?\" He held up a Snow White dress.\\n\\n \"Well, not exactly.\" It was pretty but not what I had in mind. And I hadn\u0027t imagined puffy sleeves, and I didn\u0027t have time to dye the entire dress black.\\n\\n \"We have more,\" he said, showing us an area of unsold costumes. \"Feel free to sift through.\" As I smiled at Jack, I recalled that time when I\u0027d helped him sneak into the Mansion, as I\u0027d done so many times myself, and how far I\u0027d come since then. Not only was I dating the vampire who had since moved into the Mansion, but I was on my way to becoming one myself.\\n\\n I\u0027d assisted Jack with his mission and, unknowingly, he was doing the same for me.\\n\\n I was hoping to find a dress here, like I had done before for a dance. But this one was for an even more important occasion, a truly magical night that would change everything - would change me. Jack didn\u0027t know this, but the next time I saw him, I might indeed be a vampire.\\n\\n \"Whatever you find,\" he said with a twinkle in his eye, \"I know you\u0027ll look beautiful.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you so much,\" I said sincerely. I was truly touched by his compliment; it meant the world to me. I raced over and gave him a warm embrace.\\n\\n Jack was paged from the front of the store and gave us a quick wink good-bye.\\n\\n Becky and I whisked through the stacks of costumes, hoping one would fill my ultimate desired covenant dress and be the right size.\\n\\n \"How about this?\" Becky pulled out a blood-red dress, but it was at least three sizes too big.\\n\\n \"That one is better. But I\u0027ll have to cut it off and take in most of it.\"\\n\\n I perused a rack of hanging costumes. But one by one, each was something other than what I needed.\\n\\n \"What do you think of this one, then?\" Becky asked excitedly. I looked up, hopeful. She held up a tattered, bloody prom dress, one a ghost girl would wear.\\n\\n Perfect for Halloween but not for my idea of a covenant ceremony.\\n\\n \"I do think it\u0027s cool, but it\u0027s white and red. And I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the right mood. Even for me,\" I lamented.\\n\\n \"I guess not.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do,\" I said. I only had one day.\\n\\n Then I spotted a dress hanging alone at the end of the rack.\\n\\n I was deflated from not finding the perfect dress, but I decided to check it out. The closer I got to it, the more hopeful I became. I reached for it and held it out to the light. It was an off-the-shoulder black lace dress, with pearl buttons decorating the middle of the corset like dewdrops. It came with black lace gloves and a small lace bolero.\\n\\n \"I love this,\" I said, melting.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so you!\"\\n\\n \"I could wear this if I get cold.\" I modeled the bolero.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gorgeous,\" Becky cooed.\\n\\n \"I hope it fits,\" I said, holding it up to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure it will.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to be able to eat, anyway,\" I told her. \"I\u0027m too excited.\"\\n\\n Becky examined it as I held it against me. It looked like a perfect fit.\\n\\n \"That dress was waiting for you - just like Alexander,\" she said.\\n\\n We both jumped up and down and squealed with delight until a saleslady came in and told us to calm down. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-20.html","bookId":2147,"book":{"id":2147,"title":"Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9)","description":"Storyline: Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9) \\n Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling is coming to Dullsville, and Raven is both excited and panicked in anticipation of Alexander\u0027s little sister\u0027s visit.
