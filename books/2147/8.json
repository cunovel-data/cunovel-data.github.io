I thought I could invite her.\"\n I was stunned at my brother\u0027s suggestion. First, I couldn\u0027t imagine that my nerdy little brother had become brave enough to ask a girl to a dance, and two, the girl he wanted to be his date was a vampire.\n \"That would be so nice,\" my mom gushed. \"I think you should.\"\n \"Sorry. No such luck,\" I said. \"I think you should go, by all means, but you should ask one of your friends at school.\"\n \"Won\u0027t she be in town?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s this week.\"\n I knew she\u0027d be in town and I wasn\u0027t prepared to lie, even though it was the easiest solution.\n \"Uh ... yes, she will be. But I don\u0027t think taking her would be a very good idea.\"\n \"Why not?\" he asked.\n \"Yes,\" my dad said. \"I think it\u0027s a great idea.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t there that girl from Math Club that you\u0027d like to invite?\" I asked. I remembered going to one of his parties at the library and seeing a girl there who appeared to be really attached to him.\n \"Yes, but I just thought it would be fun to ask Stormy.\"\n \"I\u0027m dating Alexander. You can\u0027t date his sister,\" I said as if it were a fact.\n \"There isn\u0027t a law against it,\" he responded. \"Besides, it\u0027s not a date. It\u0027s just a dance.\"\n \"This would be a wonderful opportunity for both of you,\" my mom said to Billy. \"This will be Billy\u0027s first dance, and Stormy\u0027s first in America. She could learn a lot. I think it would be very special for them both.\"\n Nerd Boy attending a school dance? I knew he was growing up, and if he\u0027d been someone else\u0027s brother it might have been okay. But he was mine, and I knew his every smarmy quirk. I wasn\u0027t ready to accept he was growing up, and I definitely wasn\u0027t ready to see him falling for a vampire.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said. \"Can we change the subject?\"\n \"Why?\" my mom pressed. It was just like her to get her nose into other people\u0027s business - especially mine.\n Because she\u0027s a vampire, I wanted to say. But I knew I couldn\u0027t share that information with them.\n \"She\u0027s Alexander\u0027s sister,\" I said instead. \"And I don\u0027t want you to cramp my style.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have style!\" my brother barked.\n \"Well, if you don\u0027t think I do, then why do you want to invite Stormy? She dresses like I do.\"\n \"Because...\" he started, \"I thought it was the nice thing to do.\"\n I felt awful. It was really sweet of him to want to take Stormy to the dance. But I couldn\u0027t get past that he was my nerdy little brother. Stormy was cool and cute. I could see why Billy Boy liked her, and I believed he genuinely did. But I had to think of a way out of the situation and ensure that Billy wouldn\u0027t want to take her to the dance.\n \"Well, if she goes, then I do, too,\" I threatened.\n \"I think that just killed the invite,\" my dad said.\n \"I thought so.\" I grinned like a chess champion.\n \"Fine,\" Billy said. \"But bring Alexander, too.\"\n My grin soured as I realized who was the champion after all. And it wasn\u0027t me.\n \"But she can\u0027t go!\" I said to Alexander later that evening at the Mansion when I told him about Billy\u0027s invitation to the middle school dance. We were in his attic room while Stormy was being tutored by Jameson, who, I now knew, was in fact a half-vampire.\n \"Why not?\" Alexander asked. \"She\u0027ll be so excited.\"\n \"Because my brother is a nerd.\"\n \"He is not,\" Alexander said with a chuckle. \"He\u0027s perfectly normal.\"\n \"And he doesn\u0027t know the truth about you and Stormy. That you both are vampires.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think that will be an issue.\"\n \"How can it not be?\" I questioned worriedly. \"He\u0027s very curious.\"\n \"Relax, Raven. It\u0027s just a dance. They\u0027ll be fine.\"\n \"There\u0027s one other problem,\" I began. I was hoping this would be the deal breaker that could shut the whole dance invite down. \"I told Billy if he goes, so do I.\" \"You\u0027ll be his chaperone?\" he asked.\n \"Uh ... and so will you.\"\n I was ready for everything to be called off right there and then. This was my excuse. I would tell Billy that Alexander refused to go.\n But Alexander tilted his head and smiled brightly. \"Okay,\" he said. \"What should I wear?\" I was surprised that Alexander was game for us chaperoning. Instead of rolling his eyes, he seemed to like the idea that Billy wanted him to go, too.\n \"You want to go?\" I asked, half whining.\n \"Sure. I think it will be fun.\"\n \"You\u0027re not worried about your sister going to a dance with a bunch of mortals?\"\n \"No, I think it would be good for her. I like the solitude of the Mansion. But Stormy, she\u0027s not like me. She needs to be social as much as she needs to drink blood.\"\n I wasn\u0027t expecting Alexander to be so excited about the fall dance. I thought if he wasn\u0027t game, we\u0027d be able to get out of it, thus blocking Billy from taking Stormy. Since I loathed the idea of going to my brother\u0027s school dance, I felt torn. I would much rather be running around tombstones than chaperoning a dance, but going anywhere with Alexander was better than not being with him at all.\n \"All right,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t imagine that my brother and I would both be on the arms of vampires. \"But no one gets bitten unless it\u0027s me.\" Later that night, Alexander and I arrived at the Crypt. I preferred dancing at the club to my brother\u0027s school gymnasium.\n I was bopping on the dance floor while Alexander was talking to Sebastian when Jagger spotted me as he headed to the bar.\n I was bopping on the dance floor while Alexander was talking to Sebastian when Jagger spotted me as he headed to the bar.\n \"So...\" Jagger said. \"You really like it here, do you?\"\n \"I love it. I have to admit, despite your history with Alexander, you really do have talent,\" I said, and stepped off the dance floor to talk to him and catch my breath.\n \"You think so?\" he asked, his white hair cascading over his blue and green eyes.\n \"Look at this. You have all of Dullsville High here. They love it.\"\n \"But you do, too?\" he asked with a mischievous and playful grin.\n \"I love it the most. Are you kidding?\"\n \"Why?\" he asked in a serious and deliberate tone. \"Why do you think you belong with us more than your own kind?\"\n \"It\u0027s just who I am. That\u0027s all that I can say. I was born this way.\"\n \"And I was, too. I\u0027m surprised Alexander didn\u0027t turn you the first moment he saw you. I would have.\" Jagger\u0027s back was to Alexander, but I could see my boyfriend keeping a watchful eye on us from across the room.\n \"What do you mean by that?\" I asked.\n \"He\u0027s a vampire. It\u0027s enough to prey upon a young mortal - but to have one willing? It\u0027s a travesty not to take advantage of the situation.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s where you both are different.\"\n \"He\u0027s not like us,\" Jagger said with intensity.\n \"He\u0027s not like anyone. That\u0027s why I love him.\"\n \"But there are others you can be with. Others who can make your wish come true. At the Coffin Club. Here.\" I didn\u0027t like Jagger insinuating anything about my relationship with Alexander, or that I\u0027d consider being turned by anyone else.\n \"But it doesn\u0027t matter - just as long as it\u0027s with Alexander.\"\n \"Really,\" he said. \"Is that what you feel down in your soul? You said you were born this way. That was a long time before you met Alexander. Don\u0027t you wonder about what you are missing?\"\n I knew what I was missing. But I had to be patient.\n \"What are you waiting for?\" he asked.\n Just then Alexander appeared. There was a truce between the two, but he glared at his former nemesis. Alexander wasn\u0027t too possessive of me - and he didn\u0027t need to be. I wasn\u0027t the kind who flirted with just anyone. But I could tell there was an underlying mistrust of the Maxwells that went as deep as blood. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-8.html","bookId":2147,"book":{"id":2147,"title":"Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9) \n Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling is coming to Dullsville, and Raven is both excited and panicked in anticipation of Alexander\u0027s little sister\u0027s visit.
