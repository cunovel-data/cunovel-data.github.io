A few evenings later, Alexander texted to say that he\u0027d pick me and Billy up to get ice cream at Shirley\u0027s Bakery with him and Stormy. Billy came into my room while I was getting ready for our outing. \"Don\u0027t you knock?\" I asked. \"Did you know the picture of me and Stormy didn\u0027t turn out?\" he asked. \"No,\" I lied. \"That sucks. Are you just now looking at it?\" \"I noticed it that night, but I was looking at it again this afternoon. You can\u0027t even take a picture right!\" Billy argued. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I said. \"Alexander has - \" \"But it\u0027s weird,\" he interjected. \"She should have been in the photo.\" \"I guess I moved.\" \"No, that\u0027s not it.\" \"Then I guess she moved.\" I\u0027d used this excuse before on Becky, but my brother wasn\u0027t buying it. \"No, she didn\u0027t,\" Billy protested. \"Henry and I enlarged it on the school computer. If you had moved, you wouldn\u0027t have gotten me in, either, or you would have gotten more of her. If she moved, it would have been blurry.\" \"Then I don\u0027t know what happened,\" I finally said. \"I think you do.\" \"I have no idea what you mean. What are you saying?\" \"She didn\u0027t show up. The only explanation is that she\u0027s invisible on film.\" I laughed. \"Are you crazy?\" \"No,\" he said. \"It\u0027s scientific fact.\" \"Well, I didn\u0027t want to show you this. I wanted Alexander to give this to you himself. But now you\u0027ve spoiled it!\" I pulled the portrait of Billy and Stormy out of my closet. \"Here - \" I said, handing him the painting. \"This is so cool!\" he exclaimed, gazing at the picture as if it were really her. \"It looks like what the picture would have looked like.\" \"Yes, isn\u0027t that awesome?\" I asked proudly. \"How did Alexander know that I\u0027d want this?\" \"I don\u0027t know. He just made it.\" \"He had to have known that the picture wouldn\u0027t turn out.\" \"He did not. Don\u0027t go all crazy conspiracy theorist on me.\" \"She\u0027s allergic to garlic and is afraid of mirrors,\" he said like a young Sherlock Holmes. \"It\u0027s no coincidence, is it?\" \"No,\" I said. \"It\u0027s on purpose. Her parents purposefully altered her genes and personality to make her that way.\" \"That\u0027s why she doesn\u0027t have many friends,\" he deduced. \"That\u0027s why she lives in isolation in Romania. That\u0027s why Valentine said she was different. He knows about her.\" \"Knows what?\" \"That she\u0027s a vamp - \" The doorbell suddenly rang. And just in the nick of time. I raced down the stairs, and Billy chased after me. Alexander and Stormy were waiting outside. \"Billy is asking a lot of questions about Stormy,\" I whispered to Alexander as I took his hand and hurried to the car. \"Like what?\" Billy caught up to me. \"Hey, Alexander, Stormy.\" The Sterling siblings greeted my brother. \"Thanks for the portrait of me and Stormy,\" Billy said to Alexander. \"That was awesome!\" \"What portrait?\" Stormy asked. \"Alexander made a picture of you and me at the dance. The same one that Raven took of us. It didn\u0027t turn out, so I was really lucky you made this.\" He pulled out his phone. \"I\u0027d like to take another picture of us,\" Billy said. \"And this time I\u0027d like Alexander to take it. I bet he\u0027ll do a better job than you.\" We all froze. None of us knew what to do. Take the picture and have it not turn out again? \"We\u0027ll do that when we get home,\" I said, pushing my brother out the door. \"We need to get to Shirley\u0027s before there\u0027s a line.\" I tried to talk as much as I could on the way to Shirley\u0027s Bakery. I didn\u0027t want my brother bringing up to Stormy that she was missing from his photo. \"So are you and Valentine good friends?\" Billy asked after we got to Shirley\u0027s and ordered. We were walking along the downtown square and taking in the evening air. \"Yes, I\u0027ve known him most of my life.\" \"Do you hang out a lot?\" \"I don\u0027t have many friends at home. So I\u0027d say yes, he\u0027s one. But since I came to this town, I have even more friends,\" she said with a twinkle in her eyes. \"Maybe we could get together tomorrow,\" Billy said suddenly. \"Tomorrow?\" she asked. \"Maybe later... How about after sunset?\" \"I was thinking before. We could hang outside. Henry has a tree house. It will be better to see it during the daylight hours.\" \"I think I have something planned with Alexander.\" \"Then how about the next afternoon?\" he pressed. \"Don\u0027t you have school?\" she asked. \"We could meet right afterward.\" \"I get tutored by Jameson.\" \"I could come and watch,\" he said. \"Don\u0027tpanI you understand? I can\u0027t see you then. I want to, but I can\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027tpanI you understand? I can\u0027t see you then. I want to, but I can\u0027t.\" \"Why not?\" he urged. \"I have something planned every day!\" she shouted. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Alexander asked. \"Nothing.\" Stormy took a bite of her ice cream. \"I was just seeing if Stormy could hang out with me and Henry during the day,\" Billy said. \"We always go out at night. I\u0027d like us to hang out in the day sometime, instead.\" \"That\u0027s not possible,\" she said. \"Why?\" \"Stormy will be going back to Romania soon,\" Alexander said flatly. \"I will?\" Stormy said, surprised. \"She will?\" Billy and I asked sadly, in unison. \"I\u0027d like her to spend the days with me,\" Alexander said. \"You know, to catch up before she leaves.\" \"I\u0027m not ready to leave,\" she said. \"You can\u0027t stay here forever,\" Alexander replied. \"I want to stay here,\" she demanded, \"with Billy and Henry and Valentine and Raven.\" I felt touched that she felt the need to be with me. \"We can talk about this later,\" Alexander said softly. \"No, we can discuss this now. I\u0027m not going home!\" Stormy was getting mad, and I wasn\u0027t sure what to say or do. \"Well, you have to sometime,\" Alexander said. \"We\u0027ll talk about it when we get home.\" \"I don\u0027t have to leave now,\" she said. \"And you can\u0027t make me.\" Stormy hurried off and sat on a bench outside the bakery. \"I\u0027m sorry - \" Billy said to Alexander. \"I shouldn\u0027t have brought all this up. We can hang out whenever it\u0027s convenient,\" he said. \"Just as long as she can stay here.\" My brother joined her, and the two sat on a park bench outside a coffee shop. I noticed Billy fiddling with something in his back pocket. He pulled out the mirror he\u0027d taken from Henry\u0027s telescope. I wasn\u0027t sure what he was going to do with it, but I had a pretty good idea. \"Don\u0027t you dare,\" I whispered to him. \"Why not?\" he asked, faking naivete. \"Because I said so.\" I sat down next to him. Stormy was busy licking the dripping ice cream off her cone. \"What will I see?\" he asked. \"Or not see?\" \"If you do this, I\u0027ll break your fingers,\" I threatened in his ear. \"You\u0027ll never play a video game again.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" Stormy asked. \"Just sibling talk,\" I said. \"Oh, I know how that is.\" \"Maybe you should go stand by Alexander,\" I tried to prompt her. \"I like it here,\" she said. \"I just wanted to see your reaction,\" Billy said. \"I wanted to see if you already knew. But I sensed that you did.\" \"Knew what?\" I asked. \"Look up there,\" he said. He motioned to a mirror hanging on the corner of the building. The kind of mirror that is used to help cars see the pedestrians before they came out of the alley. It was angled so that we could see the bench we were sitting on. I saw Billy and myself, but the seat next to Billy, where Stormy was now sitting, was empty. My mouth dropped almost to the cement sidewalk below us. My brother didn\u0027t say a word. \"I\u0027m not leaving,\" we heard Stormy say. \"My friends are here.\" Billy gave me a knowing glance, then smiled sweetly at Stormy. \"I love this ice cream,\" she said. She held her cone out to Billy. \"Want a bite?\" \"A bite?\" he asked, staring at me. \"No, I don\u0027t think I do, but Raven? She might.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-15.html","bookId":2147,"book":{"id":2147,"title":"Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9)","description":"Storyline: Immortal Hearts (Vampire Kisses #9) Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling is coming to Dullsville, and Raven is both excited and panicked in anticipation of Alexander\u0027s little sister\u0027s visit.
