A planet filled with others who also had extraordinary abilities. A peaceful planet––until the day the Mogadorians attacked, and nearly annihilated, the Loric people. \\n Only a handful of Loric survived the battle. This is Sandor’s story. \\n Sandor was tired of being a teenager, tired of going to school and obeying his teachers and playing by his parents\u0027 rules. He enjoyed breaking the rules rather than following them. But when he makes one mistake too many, Sandor\u0027s life takes an unexpected turn, and he is forced join the Lorien Defense Academy. \\n Sandor had never believed in the crazy idea that Lorien needed to defend itself—Lorien was a peaceful planet, with no apparent enemies. But when Mogadorians suddenly attack, Sandor learns how real that threat was. Now Sandor is one of only a handful of Loric left alive, and the fate of Lorien is in their hands.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-last-days-of-lorien-lorien-legacies-the-lost-files-5.jpg","author":"Pittacus Lore","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
