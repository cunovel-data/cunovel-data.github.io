{"id":109968,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n \"Okay,\" Damali said, dragging her fingers through her hair as the van aimlessly maneuvered through Washington\u0027s gridlocked streets. \"If the information Enoch had was in the architecture, and Masons built D.C. . . . it\u0027s in the stones, and the map shows that it\u0027s in the actual concrete street patterns . . . there\u0027s gotta be another lodge or something we can do research on to find out what was in the Scottish Rite Temple.\"\n \"Try the mother temple,\" Cordell said blithely with a shrug.\n \"Where?\"Carlos said.\n Cordell looked in the rearview mirror and beamed. \"The past is prologue, my friend. This old black Israelite knows a little bit. Right, Doug?\"\n Doug nodded. \"Cordell is brilliant, but doesn\u0027t like to let people know. I learned the streets from him.\" Doug winked at Cordell.\n \"Hey, I\u0027m just an old black man driving a bus . . . but I do know that thirteen blocks north of the White House and thirteen blocks south of the temple wewas trying to get to, right on the corner of Sixteenth and S Streets, is one of the most important Masonic temples in the world. House of the Temple-headquarters of the Mother Supreme Council of the World . . . and the Supreme Council of the Third Degree of Scottish Rite Masons of the Southern Jurisdiction. Steps are set up in three, five, seven, nine groupings that lead to a doorway with a two-to-one proportion, just like the smaller Scottish Rite Temple on Sixteenth and Harvard. It\u0027s based on Kemetic architecture, and has one of the most impressive Masonic libraries in the world. Got \u0027Knowledge Is Power\u0027 etched in brass on two sphinxes of wisdom-knowledge and power-action.\"\n Damali and Carlos shared a look, and Yonnie leaned forward.\n \"Cordell saidknowledge is power is on that building?\" Yonnie\u0027s gaze held Carlos\u0027s. \"That\u0027s right off the old thrones, man-basic.\"\n \"I feel you, man,\" Carlos said in a low murmur, giving Yonnie the vibe to be cool and let Cordell talk.\n \"The Temple Room got thirty-three columns that\u0027s thirty-three-feet high . . . with thirty-three seats for the highest level of Masons-thirty-three degree Masons inducted into the Mystic Shrine,\" Cordell continued proudly. \"So, if there\u0027s something in the stones that was in the Scottish Rites Temple, the mother temple would have it, too-they\u0027re mirror images.\"\n \"You said your contact was dead,\" Doug interjected, looking at Carlos and cutting off Cordell\u0027s spiel. \"If bodies are dropping already, then you need an exit strategy.\"\n \"How\u0027d it happen?\" Berkfield said, glancing around the team.\n \"Man got his throat cut and so-called robbed trying to get up the steps to the temple so he could meet y\u0027all,\" Cordell said, all mirth leaving his tone as he relayed the information he\u0027d heard earlier on his police scanner. \"Dougie is right. All y\u0027all seers open up a channel so I can show you our network. If the house on M is under siege, then we gotta take you through the \u0027hood over in southeast and either out into Virginia or Maryland, depending on whether you wanna hide heading north or south. Worse case, we can get you out into the Chesapeake Bay and head you toward Bermuda, if it\u0027s real hot, and from there you can jump down to the Caribbean. But most everywhere has extradition back to the United States these days. You can run, but it\u0027s real hard to hide from Big Brother, once theycome gunning for you.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hope it won\u0027t come to that,\" Marjorie said in a quiet tone.\n \"We\u0027re already there, Marj,\" Berkfield said, growing annoyed. \"Didn\u0027t you hear the news J.L. just rattled off? We\u0027ve already been set up by the darkside, positioned as potential terrorists . . . now the good guys are gonna start plowing into bank statements, credit cards, library cards, car notes, anything that we might have purchased even through a third party.\"\n \"Which means they\u0027ll freeze our assets,\" Dan said, suddenly panicked.\n \"You oughta know me better than that,\" Carlos said coolly, looking around the group as he materialized a platinum credit card between his fingers and made it just as quickly disappear. \"I got most of our shit offshore in number only accounts. My old life living under radar taught me that much.\"\n \"My brother,\" Yonnie said, pounding his fist.\n \"Bigger problem is freedom of movement now just got seriously limited,\" Damali said, allowing her gaze to rake the group. \"We\u0027re formally done-out of the music business. If we resurface again, we\u0027re going into immediate custody. From this point on, life as we knew it has changed . . . we\u0027re completely underground, strictly guerrilla.\"\n Rider flopped back against his seat and closed his eyes. \"I knew this day would come. I have just retained the right to start smoking again.\"\n \"Shoot us the images,\" Carlos said, his voice weighted with sudden fatigue. \"We definitely need a fallback position now.\"\n \"Roger that,\" Doug said. \"I\u0027ll alert our base-station squads that we\u0027ve got our Neteru team possibly coming in hot. We\u0027ll do everything we can to throw the feds off your trail, make \u0027em think you\u0027re in Europe or something, and we can try to send out confusing signatures to the darkside. Also know, the Internet is your friend . . . we\u0027ve got Web radio cells at your disposal, and a grid that can block theirs with Light.\"\n \"No doubt we\u0027ll get a little angelic assistance with blocking our exact whereabouts from humans so we don\u0027t have to smoke anybody,\" Shabazz said, fishing his favorite Glock, Black Beauty, out of his mud cloth satchel to stash in his waistband.\n \"That would be helpful,\" Rider said sarcastically. \"But my main concern is not having the Unnamed One know I\u0027m riding in a van full of explosives, but maybe I\u0027m just paranoid.\"\n \"Well, if you get in a jam, head for the Jefferson marker,\" Cordell said, peering at the group over his shoulder as he drove. \"See, the Washington Monument was supposed to be the first zero milestone of the city, but the ground was too unstable . . . so it now stands where they say the ground could hold it-slightly east of the north-south axis between the White House and the Jefferson Memorial. But if you stand at the Jefferson\u0027s marker facing west, you would be standing in front of a cross formed by the Lincoln Memorial in front of you, the Capitol behind you, the White House on your right, and the Jefferson Memorial on your left. If you extend two perpendicular lines from the center of this point-which is the ten square miles Banneker and Ellicott surveyed back in the day-they would terminate at the four cornerstones that are north, south, east, and west boundaries of the city.It\u0027s a cross .\"\n \"This riddle is about to make me pull my hair out,\" Damali said, clasping her locks in her fists. \"A cross is squared off with a pentagram, with the White House being the exact center of the Metatron\u0027s Cube protecting it, which is also the baseline center point for a pyramid in the grid.\"\n \"Well, our stoneworkers know what to do. Ladies, you\u0027ve got your position and coordinates,\" Carlos said. \"You\u0027re gonna have to either bring us back home by frying anything supernatural that crosses the Cube or the cross-grid by supercharging that-same deal for the male tacticals on the squad.\"\n Damali stared down at the map as the van came to a slow, rolling stop. \"Two things are working my nerves. One-the Washington Monument being offset doesn\u0027t feel like a coincidence to me. I\u0027ve seen this off-center arrangement somewhere before. It means something, Carlos. Two-the other thing that I keep remembering is the Washington Monument is a symbol for Ausar. It\u0027s a tekhen, a giant phallus symbol, the part of Ausar that Aset couldn\u0027t find when he was attacked and originally killed by Set or Satan, with his body scattered in fourteen segments. They only found thirteen, \u0027His phallus was thrown in the Nile and eaten by catfish.\u0027 \"\n \"So they made that missing part from stone so he could be buried whole,\" Carlos said, wiping his palms down his face.\n Every male on the team shuddered.\n \"Since then, that monument shape has been used in culture after culture as a symbol of fertility and power,\" Damali said, enthralling the van. She turned to Carlos and then to Yonnie. \"Heru, Ausar\u0027s son, then came back and conquered Set-Satan-and restored his father\u0027s honor, blah, blah, blah . . . so wouldn\u0027t it make sense that, if we\u0027re following the old Kemetic beliefs as carved in the stones by the very layout of the nation\u0027s capital by its founding Masons-who also clearly believed in the ancient power of all of this-that to really get his revenge off, this particular monument would factor into the coming of Satan\u0027s son?\"\n \"Fair exchange is no robbery,\" Carlos said, sitting back and looking out the window, his thoughts quickly traveling. \"Baby, that\u0027s genius.\"\n \"And that is just how that motherfucker would think, too!\" Yonnie said, jumping out of his seat so he could pace in the short aisle. \"He\u0027d screw the forces of Light, in their own house, with their own dick, in front of the cross, with the symbol of their potency, their power base, and shove it right up-\"\n \"We get the point,\" Marlene said. \"Language, Yolando, please . . .\" Her eyelids fluttered as she spoke. \"There\u0027s a Heru Bedhet inside the monument above the elevators that take visitors to the observation deck.\"\n \"I don\u0027t follow,\" Berkfield said, looking around. \"What\u0027s a Heru Bedhet?\"\n \"It\u0027s a figure that was carved above the entrance of every temple in Kemet-it symbolizes Heru\u0027s victory over Set or Satan, as the case may be,\" Damali said. \"Heru then ascended into Heaven to meet his father, Ausar, after his time on earth was over. But the point is,he kicked Set\u0027s butt to avenge the way his father and mother had been played. That\u0027s the foundation of Kemetic philosophy and that belief system.\"\n \"It\u0027s on my shield and on my blade of Ausar,\" Carlos confirmed.\n \"My point, exactly,\" Yonnie argued. \"Essentially, like a Neteru tattoo at your base, bro-that Bedhet is at the base of Ausar\u0027s rock-\"\n \"Yo, man,\" Carlos shouted.\"TMI!\"\n A muffled giggle from Damali\u0027s pearl wafted up from the mud cloth bag where she\u0027d stashed her necklace.\n \"I feel you, but we ain\u0027t got time to be all modest,\" Yonnie said, jumping up to begin pacing again. \"Meand you know how the darkside thinks. So if youwas the Unnamed One, wouldn\u0027t you just love to screw the entire human world and the Light with a symbol that has been erected since time immemorial, since the days of Ausar, that basically threw in your face how you lost to your adversary\u0027s kid? Wouldn\u0027t you want to bring your heir back through that?\"\n \"He\u0027s got a point, Carlos,\" Shabazz said, looking at Yonnie and then Carlos. \"I\u0027m sure the Unnamed One ascribes to the mine-is-bigger-than-yours theory.\"\n \"You know he does!\" Yonnie said, slapping a seat back.\n \"Well, what\u0027s this symbol look like-the Bedhet thing that we should keep an eye out for?\" Jose asked, looking at Carlos and then Damali.\n \"Two winged serpents, one that looks to the east and another to the west, with the sun in the middle, and inside the sun, the six-pointed star represents Sepedet-an upside-down triangle, or female form, for Aset-and a pyramid-for Ausar-put together-\"\n \"Forms a Star of David,\" Dan said, jumping up to stand by Yonnie. \"That\u0027s why you got the Enoch references and had to look at the Kabbalah!\"\n \"It\u0027s called the Thirteenth or Royal Arch Degree,\" Cordell said. \"I know. I\u0027m a Mason . . . and Enoch is also associated with the Royal Arch. All fits.\"\n \"Go back to the pyramid,\" Carlos said, too wired to sit. He stood and smoothed a palm over his hair. \"If the pyramid in the Sepedet refers to Ausar, then Yonnie broke the code.\" He looked at Yonnie and slowly pounded his fist. \"If you were the Ultimate Darkness that was operating in the shadows, you\u0027d do the unthinkable in front of the cross, and before Ausar who\u0027s bested you in the past with his son . . . you\u0027d use his own phallus, that is marked at the base by the symbol of the first Kemetic family, Ausar and Aset, in front of the White House-which is a metaphor for their palace-and you\u0027d screw them with the monument that allowed them to give birth to their heir, Heru . . . the son who beat you. You\u0027d defy the Masons, who gated you in the Metatron\u0027s Cube and set their symbol beside that in the streets, the Masonic Compass, to let all who knew how to read the architecture that they wereall not necessarily responsible for what would arise from the pentagram-even if, perhaps, some of their early brethren who\u0027d crossed over to the darkside might have laid those original streets in a satanic barter.\"\n \"Lotto!\"Yonnie yelled in the bus.\n \"The Washington Monument is also the number of man,\" Cordell offered, fully turning in his seat as heidled the engine and put on the van\u0027s hazard lights. \"Five. The Antichrist is coming as a man . . . and the monument is fifty-five-feet wide at the base and five-hundred-and-fifty-five-feet in height, a ten-to-one ratio just like the other tekhenwy in Egypt, or obelisks, as the Greeks called them.\"\n \"Hidden in plain sight,\" Damali murmured. \"We\u0027ve just gotta figure out how and where that pupa is hidden near the monument.\"\n They waited in the van, anticipation zinging through the group. Cordell was supposed to try to gain access to the private lodge and send mental pics back to the group\u0027s seers, but the pomp and circumstance of it all was making everyone crazy. Yet, there was nothing to do but sit and wait in the van like a silently ticking time bomb. Then the first image hit her. It was the pyramid on the dollar bill.\n \"He\u0027s in,\" Damali announced quickly. \"Pyramids . . . he\u0027s looking at pyramids in the library,\" she added in a quieter tone as her Guardian sister\u0027s eyelids began to flutter.\"Cross section. Tekhen . . . he doesn\u0027t know what we need and we can\u0027t tell him because we don\u0027t know-he could be in there for hours! Dollar bill, thirteen steps on that pyramid . . . eagle tail feathers, nine.All-seeing eye. He\u0027s trying to do numerology combinations. I don\u0027t know what to tell him. Valley of the Kings built on the west bank of the Nile, our famous necropolis and many memorials to dead presidents are on the west bank of the Potomac. He\u0027s all over the place and it isn\u0027t his fault.\"\n \"Pyramids-because those are secret and they are strong and that\u0027s where the dead kings used to be buried,\" the pearl shouted from her bag. \"It\u0027s so horrible, but that\u0027s where it\u0027s growing. I\u0027m afraid, Damali. I don\u0027t like this at all!\"\n \"Go back to the pyramid-cross section,\" Marlene said calmly. \"Overlay the Queen\u0027s Chamber inside the apex of the traditional pyramid with the street design of where the Washington Monument sits across from the White House. Just like the Queen\u0027s Chamber is offset from the King\u0027s Chamber, so, too, is the Washington Monument from the White House.\"\n \"The Washington Monument could be the womb, the Queen\u0027s Chamber, offset from the male energy of the King\u0027s Chamber-the White House,\" Damali murmured.\n \"Oh, yeah, old Lu is sick . . . making Ausar\u0027s phallus symbol offset like it\u0027s female energy,\" Yonnie said, chuckling in disbelief, \"by screwing with the ground years ago so the humans couldn\u0027t build the damned thing where they\u0027d wanted to.\"\n \"Tell him to stay with cross sections of pyramids,\" Carlos said, leaning over a seat.\n Damali nodded and conveyed the message. In a few moments, words began to flow from her mouth as Dan, Jose, and J.L. furiously scribbled notes.\n \"Potomac Avenue is equivalent to the Descending Passage and Pennsylvania Avenue to the Ascending Passage and Grand Gallery in a Giza pyramid. The old canal simulates the well shaft in those Kemetic structures. The point of the relieving stones above the King\u0027s Chamber is a direct match to Scott Circle north of the White House . . . and the junction of the Ascending and Descending Passages is a direct match to the junction of Potomac and Pennsylvania Avenues.\" Damali began rocking as she spoke, drawing the team in closer. \"If you follow Potomac southwest in direction, right out into the river, there\u0027s a secret subterranean vault or chamber, just like in the Kemetic pyramids.\"\n \"I say we follow the juncture points and then check the vault,\" Carlos said. \"We can\u0027t bust into the King\u0027s chamber, the White House-and the likelihood of getting smoked in the Washington Monument by human gunfire is too real-but I\u0027d put money on it that he\u0027s hiding his heir in an easy route back to the monument. So let\u0027s start at those two places on the map,\" he said, pointing at where he\u0027d drawn along with Damali\u0027s description. \"We hit the junction point or head toward the Potomac.\"\n The moment the words came out of Carlos\u0027s mouth a police cruiser pulled up beside the van and put on its popcorn lights. The team looked at one another. Doug slid into the driver\u0027s seat as Marjorie stepped up to take the pretend role as tour guide.\n \"Can I help you, officer?\" she said brightly as Doug opened the door.\n Two policemen stood wide-legged with the strap popped on their weapons.\n \"Step away from the vehicle, ma\u0027am,\" the first cop said as more vehicles entered the street.\n \"Sure, no problem, sir,\" Marj said in her most pleasant suburban tone. \"Have we violated any parking rules by stopping our tour van so these folks could take pictures?If so, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n The tension in the bus crackled as Guardians held their breaths. Damali and Carlos saw it at the same time. Just behind the mirror aviator sunglasses, black static demon eyes flashed as Marj hit the bottom step. A swift tactical yank by Carlos snatched Marj off her feet and back into the bus. Reacting on instinct as Marj hit the floor and cops drew, Doug shut the door and sealed it with a tactical charge, while Carlos flung up a shield.\n \"Drive!\" Shabazz hollered, hitting the cruisers\u0027 engines with enough charge to blow them.\n Damali was up and out of her seat, sending mental darts to Cordell. \"Get out of there!\" she yelled at the same time she sent the mental image and the van slammed onto the pavement to begin a wild chase.\n \"He\u0027ll never make it,\" Doug screamed, careening off the curb and into oncoming traffic. \"Throw him a tactical shield or something!\"\n Out of nowhere, three fast-moving bicycle messengers whizzed by the two demons disguised as police. Instant recognition coiled a new level of tension within Carlos and Damali as their eyes met. The two ebony-hued sister Guardians from Philly skidded out in opposite directions, while an unknown, almond-hued male Guardian momentarily drew the demons\u0027 attention. Three names and faces pierced the Neterus\u0027 minds-Zulma, Kenyetta, Craig. Thencame the urgent message to avoid a friendly-fire mistake:Don\u0027t shoot us, we\u0027re in the Light. We came to give you cover -get out of the grid!\n Snub-nosed revolvers came out of cyclist Windbreaker jackets in a flash to spit silver shells. Demons dove behind the cruiser doors for cover and to take aim, but the cyclists\u0027 athletic maneuvers were too swift. They\u0027d blended into the urban environment and were gone before they could be hit. Then Craig circled back around as Kenyetta slid in from one street, Zulma raced in from an adjacent one, all three now toting pump shotguns. In a split second, weapon hammers clicked back. Three blasts released, a demon splattered the cruiser interior and then burned to ash as the second one rolled under the vehicle chassis snarling. Like erratic, fast-moving lightning, the Guardians were once again gone. But they had created enough of a diversion to give the older Guardian who\u0027d been trapped in the building time to hear the telepathic 911 and to get out.\n A hail of bullets riddled the outer shields of the van and suddenly the team saw Cordell huffing down the steps. It all happened in slow motion. Guardians remained weaponless as bullets left chambers and more demon officers appeared out of thin air. Officers ducked behind cars, popping up to fire at Cordell. A stunned old man froze for two seconds too long in the crossfire. Carlos reached out, and then fell back as two-hundred-plus pounds of humanity landed in his lap.\n \"Thanks, young brother,\" Cordell said, breathing hard.\n \"You all right?\"Carlos said, struggling to get up as Doug drove like a maniac.\n \"You get my father-seer? You get him!\" Doug hollered from the front seat.\n \"I\u0027m good, I\u0027m good,\" Cordell said, crawling to a seat. \"But lemme drive, boy. I can see \u0027round corners-you gonna get us kilt.\"\n Choppers were in the air and sirens blared.\n \"This got real bad real fast,\" Rider said, going from window to window. \"How do we know which ones are regular human cops and which are demons? Which ones do we shoot at, guys!\"\n \"Now would be a good time to light up those stones that are on our side, ladies!\" Berkfield shouted.\n \"We\u0027re going the wrong way!\" the pearl screamed as her platinum necklace bounced out of Damali\u0027s toppled satchel and rolled across the van floor.\n \"No, no, no!\" Cordell yelled, trying to get to the driver\u0027s seat. \"You\u0027ve panicked and lost your way, boy, not down that street!\"\n \"The pentagram!\" the pearl screamed and then stopped dead and went dark.\n The moment the van crossed the threshold of the pentagram, the shield Carlos had put up to protect the vehicle disappeared. Blue tactical protective charges receded, leaving the van naked and vulnerable.\n Guardians hit the floor as steel tore through metal and shattered glass. Then the van dangerously swerved before jumping the curb and crashing into the side of a building. Cordell made it to the front and let out an agonized wail as he pulled Doug\u0027s head back only to see a bullet wound in the center of his forehead.\n \"Ah . . . nooo!\" he wailed, clutching the young Guardian to his chest.\n \"We gotta move-now!\" Carlos said,trying to help the old man out of the van as sirens neared.\n Disoriented, the team spilled out into the street amid screaming, fleeing pedestrians in broad daylight-looking to Cordell for which way to run.\n \"We\u0027ve gotta get out of the pentagram!\" Carlos said, shaking the traumatized seer.\"Now!\"\n \"Can\u0027t blow the van,\" Shabazz shouted-looking at the row of office buildings-\"too much collateral damage.\"\n \"Choppers in the air,\" Damali said, beginning to run toward an underground Metro station.\"This way!\" Then she turned back for a second.\"Pearl!\"\n \"You have to leave her and energy-tag her to us later! We\u0027ll be sitting ducks underground, anyway!\" Carlos hollered as they ran, pummeled the steps, and jumped the turnstiles. \"We got no juice, D-none whatsoever!\"\n Commuters hugged the wall and backed away.\n \"Ladies, see what I see,\" Damali shouted, panting as she showed the stoneworkers on the team the cross-points and Meta-tron\u0027s Cube. \"Light it up-magnetic-style.\" She turned to the male tactical squad members. \"Bounce off them, electric-seeif we can get enough juice to get us out of the hot-zone. We gotta do this remotely, all second-sight, no hands.\"\n Lights lit the tunnel and then a huge explosion sounded. The first car of the oncoming train broke away from its housing in the line and came barreling into the station, empty.\n \"Do it!\" Damali shouted.\n Carlos folded the team away into the rocketing bullet as it careened past in a blur, landing bodies with a thud on the floor, against seats, slamming poles and doors. But soon incredible heat surrounded the runaway Metro car and it became apparent that the source was right on their backs.\n Thousands of miniature demons engulfed in flames chased the careening car like a blast furnace. Smoke filled the car, choking the Guardians, and every metal surface was like touching a frying pan. With no choice left, Carlos grabbed Damali\u0027s hand and pointed upward. They had to get up, had to break through the surface.\n Opening the ground above them, they bulldozed to the asphalt surface, whizzing across streets, slamming through cars and traffic, moving like a missile as they skipped water on the Mall and came to a crashing thud in the manicured grass. Tactical charges cracked like thunder and lightning, keeping Guardians from colliding against the interior of the hot car. In an instant, Carlos and Damali had worked in tandem to extract the team to safety so they could breathe, but in the very near distance, sirens, choppers, and jets could be heard.\n Damali held her head as Guardian messages pummeled her brain. \"Local team is here-their seers led them,\" she said quickly, blasting the images to Carlos and her squad so they\u0027d be sure not to accidentally fire on their own. \"Michelle, team seer, one o\u0027clock,\" she wheezed, whirring around, looking for the Georgia team. \"Quick-military nicknamed and military trained, tactical. Three o\u0027clock.Shaun, at your six, Carlos. Leone and Charlee are standing with Craig at your nine. And the two from Philly are in with a serious warrior from overseas, code named Dragon Rider. That brother, Craig, is with them.All our side, baby, and not civilians.\"\n Carlos did a quick assessment of the additional squad who\u0027d joined the fight. A honey-brown babe in ripped denim with bloodlust in her seer eyes was indeed standing at one o\u0027clock and ready for war with an assault rifle cocked and loaded. Not far from her was a brown-skinned beauty, with hair in fiercely immaculate twists, wearing a T-shirt and jeans, dual handheld Uzis in her grip-straight gangsta, a fearless leader. The tall Amazon-built beauty at his six made him nod with appreciation. If there was anybody to have at his six, the sister with a pump shotgun loaded for bear was the one.\n His attention whirled, making sure he had a mental lock on all those he\u0027d have to account for and could count on. The petite sisters at his nine looked like they were ready to kick things off Ninja-style. One had an L.A. salsa vibe, her hazel eyes glittering with the rage he understood; her weapons of choice twin Berettas. The female beside her looked like a cross between Native American and African American, her long braids wound in silver strands and her exotic eyes spoiling for war as she brandished a nickel-plated nine.\n \"Rayne,\" shesaid, her gaze hard.\n \"Thanks for having our backs,\" Carlos said.\n Carlos gave a quick nod of thanks to the Philly and D.C. teams for the assist back in the streets, and looked at the tall woman with sandy brunet hair and the bluest eyes he\u0027d ever seen. \"You came a long way,\" he said with respect.\n \"Was no trouble.Sandra from Scotland,\" she replied, hailing Carlos and lifting her chin, then glancing around until her gaze landed on Heather. \"She\u0027s from my land, a stoneworker like I am. I got special word to be sure she\u0027s looked after. No accidents this time. So they sent in a Dragon Rider, me, and I\u0027ll ride those bastards into the ground if they mess with that one again.\" She checked the magazine on her Uzi and stepped closer to Heather and Dan. \"I\u0027m your new nanny,\" she added with a smile.\n \"Everybody\u0027s got a babysitter,\" Quick said, checking her weapon and looking around as the sirens and choppers neared. \"I\u0027ve got you covered.\"\n \"The Light ain\u0027t playing this time out-noticeall the female Guardians on this watch? Quick meant what she said. The Light is making sure you\u0027ve got strong female energy backup, whatever you need on the squad,\" Craig said, his gaze holding Carlos\u0027s. \"You know it ain\u0027t normally like this.There\u0027s always been more male Guardians than females, but not this time out, bro. All the seers got the emergency vision. They call me the Kemetic One, and I heard the call to arms loud and clear. That\u0027s why I was up in Detroit with y\u0027all. So we got your back.\"\n Carlos and Damali gave each other a look.\n \"We\u0027ve gotta get to a safe house, stat,\" Carlos said, leaning on his thighs with both hands. \"The military is on our asses.\"\n \"Worse than that,\" a disembodied voice said,quaking the ground and opening the earth. Sebastian quickly appeared and then clapped before disappearing. \"Ride this, Neterus!\"\n Guardians fought to stand as Damali and Carlos tried to draw their blades into their hands as the earth fissured and a massive, pale mare exited the cavern and reared on its hind legs. The translucent, phantomlike creature\u0027s black eyes gleamed with pure evil and it took off without a rider then evaporated into sheer mist. Sirens were closing in, but the ground was still rumbling.\n \"Fall back!\" Damali and Carlos shouted in unison as thousands of shadows belched from the earth.\n Try as they might to fight against the dark tide, there were just too many shadows, and human forces were closing in. Guardians fired at the shadows, keeping them at bay as much as was possible. The newly added squad covered every pregnant female on the team as though on a suicide mission; no fear. But as soon as one demon was incinerated, another replaced it. The earth continued to quake even more violently and it became apparent that there were people trapped in the Washington Monument as it began to lean. Rubble fell and people shrieked at the base as the massive structure leaned perilously. Then a blinding explosion sent it propelling forward in a pikelike spiral toward the White House.\n \"Vlad!\"Carlos yelled, forming an energy ball in his hand and then hurling it toward the monument.\n Both Damali and Carlos reached out, but the energy band wasn\u0027t wide enough to lasso and halt it; they both would have been dragged to their deaths. All they could do was watch in horror as the monument slammed into the one place in the country that was an icon for the world.\n \"You\u0027ve just blown your load,\" Nuit\u0027s voice chuckled smoothly, joining in a cacophony of evil female laughter.\n \"Run,\" Lilith hissed. \"Andmaybe live to fight another day.\"\n Carlos and Damali looked at each other.\n The juncture, he mentally whispered.\n Yeah, and the chamber under the Potomac, she mentally replied.\n They touched their swords together and sent out two blinding energy pulses in the direction of the locations they\u0027d mentioned.\n The second the charges emitted, two massive horns breached the earth-then in the next moment they were sprawled on a white sugar sand beach.\n Rider was up on his feet first. \"We died! This time they got us and we fuckingdied, people!\"\n Guardians stood slowly, trying to understand. Bobby bent and vomited. Krissy wept into her hands as Tara felt along her body for injuries. Each Guardian blinked, and walked in a circle, inspecting their bodies, trying to make sense of the completely senseless.\n \"If we\u0027re dead,\" Cordell said with a tearstained face. \"Where\u0027s my boy, Dougie?Where you at, Dougie?\"\n A translucent figure stepped out of the nothingness and waved sadly at Cordell. \"I messed up,\" he said quietly. \"I took a wrong turn.\"\n \"Boy, we\u0027ll fix all that,\" Cordell said, weeping harder.\n \"No . . .it\u0027s beautiful here . . . peaceful,\" Doug said with a calm smile. \"The angels came for me.\"\n \"We\u0027re not dead then,\" Tara whispered, clutching Juanita\u0027s hand.\n Damali squinted as information pierced her brain. \"The Philly team, DC, Georgia, the Scot-they all made it.\" Damali closed her eyes.\"Jettisoned to a safe house in Georgetown.\"\n \"Then wherewe at?\"Inez looked around.\n \"Bermuda,\" a quiet, angelic voice said. \"You led us to it. We have much work to do to catch it this time. This was the last place in your minds that we could salvage. They have not won the war, simply the battle, but things back at your home have irrevocably changed. You are now outside the laws of man. Watch the news, rest, and heal . . . and await word.\"\n \"Uriel,\" Damali\u0027s necklace said as it suddenly appeared in her hand.\n The team just stared at one another for a moment and then went to Cordell to comfort him. It was time, yet again, to bury the fallen. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shadows-vampire-huntress-legend-11/page-19.html","bookId":2535,"book":{"id":2535,"title":"The Shadows (Vampire Huntress Legend #11)","description":"Storyline: \n The Shadows (Vampire Huntress Legend #11) \n The Dark Realms are taking cover after an angel onslaught from On High.
