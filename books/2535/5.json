{"id":109960,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"CHAPTER FOUR\n This was not at all how she\u0027d planned to spend her day, much less her life. The end-of-war hiatuses were always the same-abrupt. Gut-wrenchingly so.\n Hours of white-light-bleached communications with members of the Covenant and Guardian team safe houses had left her with a throbbing headache, almost as much as debating about what to do with Inez\u0027s little girl and mother had. There was no clear resolution; the team still didn\u0027t know what they were going to do. Chaos and the undercurrent of blatant indecision had a stranglehold on the household. Then there was the energy-depleting task of holding an orb of white light around the kitchen while Carlos gutted it and then silver-singed the entire area before rebuilding everything from the wall out.\n All this on a bag of barbecue Kettle Chips while waiting to be sure the transaction to procure supplies had gone off without a hitch. Carlos couldn\u0027t bring in food until he\u0027d been white-bathed, power hit by the Neteru Councils, and otherwise deemed a non-contaminant. That meant a message requesting grub had to be hot-prayer-jumped from her to local church kitchens on the safe list that would in turn send out deliveries through a Covenant prayer line with food loaded onto armored trucks.\n Damali rubbed her temples and stared out the window, wondering if this was what people that\u0027d crossed the prairie felt like in the covered wagon days. Would the food arrive, would the water arrive, what if the truck was ambushed or followed by hostile forces? Supplies had been packed in holy water ice, placed in silver containers surrounded by Red Sea salt, and blessed five ways from Sunday under the auspices of each of the major religions. Once it arrived, Marlene had been given instructions as the elected house chaplain to literally exorcise the food.Meanwhile poor little Ayana was whining and crying because she was hungry and tired. Damali knew exactly how the kid felt.\n After five minutes she decided to abandon the fruitless wait by the window; all that was doing was making her stomach growl. A watched pot never boiled. She left the window with a heavy sigh of frustration and went to find the guys in the War Room. They\u0027d all abandoned the Situation Room. Marlene and Inez were putting the kitchen back together with Mom Delores. Ayana was coloring at the kitchen counter. The senior male members of the team had each taken a quadrant to make sure the perimeter was secured and some were busy packing weapons, getting things ready for the inevitable road trip. Young bloods were hunkered down behind serious technology. The process made her tired.\n It had taken two hours to decontaminate the house, going through the basic prayer litany with sea salt, white sage smudges, white light, and much holy water flinging and incense burning. Now Krissy was manning four HD screens and keeping track of bizarre news, while J.L. was charting a course trying to triangulate the origin of the contagion. Heather, Marj, and Juanita had gone into an intense divining session. The Neteru Councils had white-light blasted her and Carlos for extra measure, but they seemed to be as stumped on the origin of the plague as the team. This had to be ferreted out on the ground. Everyone was in a holding pattern for at least twenty-four hours, lest they kick off the ultimate human disaster.\n From what she could surmise, the contagion was coming from multiple dark vortexes. Yet, it was hard to tell for sure, because every time she tried to focus her inner vision on a source, several scenes would interchange as decoys. Her dragon pearl oracle was baffled, too, and Zehiradangra was working with the Heather trio, igniting the other stones in the Neteru platinum collar necklace, hoping to get impressions for the seers that could help.\n The source of the struggle was obviously playing with her and Carlos, just as it was clearly getting twisted pleasure from confounding the Councils of Light. Damali knew that to be a fact the way she knew her own name. Hellholes had been opened up everywhere it seemed, and humans were carrying the black plague of shadows within them, simmering just beneath the surface of their spirits, waiting to emerge as a violent force. The clock was ticking, and human beings were a time bomb. One false move and there\u0027d be mega collateral damage.\n Humanity was, in effect, being held hostage. It was now a game of chicken;who would blink first-the darkside or the Light? If the Neterus did, then anything could happen and the casualties would be astronomical . . . the biblical proportions no one wanted on their watch. If they did nothing, the darkside would toy with them and make them twist.\n As Damali walked into the tech section of the War Room, J.L.\u0027s and Krissy\u0027s attention snapped toward her.\n \"Got anything?\" she asked, glancing at J.L. and then Krissy.\n \"I\u0027ve been searching for news anomalies and got plenty of really sick shit coming back at me, D,\" Krissy said in a horrified whisper. \"Two fourteen-year-old kids on the same day in Pennsylvania tried a Columbine-type wipeout in their high schools-one of the kid\u0027s mothers actually bought him the assault rifle. Look, this comes on the heels of the Virginia Tech massacre. What mother in her right mind buys that for her kid, ya know? Another one . . . six hillbillies in West Virginia hold a woman hostage, abusing her, making her eat dog and rat feces. Who does that kind of twisted crap unless they\u0027re possessed?\"\n \"Okay, okay, I\u0027ve heard enough,\" Damali said quietly, her gaze leaving the tube, but her hand resting on Krissy\u0027s shoulder for support. \"I get the picture. Take a break; this will jack up your head.\"\n \"These arereal news reports,\" Krissy said, her voice holding repressed horror as her gaze became distant. \"That\u0027s just one small segment of the eastern part of this nation . . . I went to Africa-\"\n \"Baby, that\u0027s enough. Take a break,\" J.L. said quietly and firmly.\n \"Good idea, Kris,\" Damali said, trying to get the horrified young Guardian to stand and leave her post.\n But Krissy shook her head, immobilized by what she\u0027d witnessed. \"I went all over Europe and the Middle East news sites, searching, but the most insane, senseless acts of violence were committed by young people right here where there\u0027s supposedly no war. Where there\u0027s abundance. The things that are happening,\" she added in a near whisper, \"they\u0027re an abomination. I went all over and . . . and . . . it\u0027s all demonic. But somehow in the midst of the worldwide insanity you can make sense of that in a war-torn land-a lot of it is old news, the same craziness just continuing, not that it makes it any less chilling. Not that it makes me okay with it, or that it means those people\u0027s lives aren\u0027t as valuable or the suffering isn\u0027t worthy of worldwide outcry. But the stuff that\u0027s making me about to puke is happening in quiet suburban communities or in the cities where there\u0027s not supposed to be droughts and wars and land mines. I don\u0027t understand.\"\n Damali held Krissy by the shoulders as J.L. turned around and then stood. The sound of his wife\u0027s panicked whisper drew him near and Damali squatted down to make Krissy\u0027s eyes meet hers.\n \"Itis demonic, but that\u0027s why we\u0027ve gotta find the source and find it fast. We cannot give up. If we do, this whole thing implodes, and everybody that\u0027s been infected will act on whatever violent, demonic messages are being thrust into their minds.\"\n \"Wereally are at the end of days, aren\u0027t we? It\u0027s just really sinkingin, even after everything else I\u0027ve seen.\" Krissy\u0027s pained gaze sought Damali\u0027s for comfort and understanding and then went to J.L.\u0027s. \"A twenty-year-old cop shot four teenagers for teasing him . . . for just calling him a name.Killed them at a pizza party in their house. They were about to graduate high school-just like me and Bobby would have a couple of years back-and they died screaming and then he killed himself. Four college kids were shot execution-style in Newark . . . they were just eating cheese steaks and hanging in a yard. It\u0027s not getting better, Damali-not even after all the demons we\u0027ve been killing and killing and killing. The darkside is winning. The presence is going for the young people. I\u0027ve separated out continuing tragedies from really new, bizarre incidents and spikes in new areas we haven\u0027t seen major patterns in. I don\u0027t know what to do-I feel so helpless.\"\n \"The future,\" Damali said, looking at J.L. and hugging Krissy. \"Write me a program, dude. We went after Hell\u0027s future, the Antichrist, so they\u0027re retaliating by going after the kids-but with all the other madness that was already swirling around in the atmosphere, they banked on us never figuring out what they were targeting.\" She stroked Krissy\u0027s back as her Guardian sister silently wept from information trauma. \"Keep the faith; it ain\u0027t over till it\u0027s over.\"\n J.L. nodded. \"Talk to me, D-I got you. What kind of program, though? What part of this do you want me to focus on?\" He caressed his wife\u0027s hair and kissed the crown of her head. \"C\u0027mon, baby . . . whydon\u0027t you help your mom with the divinations. Enough for a while, all right?\"\n Damali handed Krissy off slowly to J.L. and waited while he hugged her and then watched her slip from the room in a traumatized daze.\n \"She\u0027ll be all right, D,\" J.L. said after a moment. \"It\u0027s . . . she\u0027s never really focused on the horrors of the world, even while we battled. Seeing kids like herself, seeing how twisted normal people have become is scarier to her than seeing vampires jump out of alleys or werewolves howl at the moon.\"\n \"Tell me about it,\" Damali said, fingers combing her locks.\n J.L. nodded.\"I can cut this data a hundred ways from Sunday, but you\u0027ve gotta tell me what you\u0027re looking for or it\u0027ll be an exercise in futility.\"\n \"What do kids have in common?\" Damali began pacing to clear her head. \"Cell phones, Internet community pages, and music-those are the three most common elements in America that cut across race, gender, religion, and class pretty much, right?\"\n \"I\u0027m on it, D . . . but . . . kids could be on places like My-Space and Facebook from anywhere in the world . . . phones could be-\"\n \"Music!\"Damali paced back and forth and then punched the wall. \"Ringtones go into cell phones. Music gets put up on blogs, Internet community pages, goes over the radio waves, goes under commercial jingles on cable, you following me, J.L.? And what do we do?Music. They\u0027re rubbing our noses in it. But the world is so fouled already, so chaotic that this insanity just simply blends into all the rest of it.\"\n \"I can hack the online community pages of recent teen victims and perpetrators, isolate any music, see if there\u0027s common ground-find the record labels, see if those labels are getting primo airtime, see if they\u0027ve done recent new jingles, try to do a search on the most popular ringtones and see if there\u0027s some matches . . . might take me a few, that\u0027s a lot of data to crunch, but I\u0027m on it.\"\n They both stopped speaking as Krissy came back into the room. Her normally creamy complexion was ashen and her gaze had a faraway look.\n \"I can\u0027t find them; I don\u0027t know where the others are. I don\u0027t wanna walk down the hallway by myself.\" Tears rose in Krissy\u0027s eyes. \"I don\u0027t know what could come into our house.\"\n \"I know you got this,\" Damali said to J.L., taking Krissy\u0027s hand as she and J.L. exchanged a knowing look.\"C\u0027mon, kiddo. Been where you\u0027re at right now. You need some air.\"\n \"My wife hasn\u0027t eaten since she scarfed down a bag of barbecue Kettle Chips and I know she\u0027s starving-might slip up and taste something wrong by accident,\" Carlos fussed as Marlene stood over his tub. \"The Covenant trucks are outside and I wanna make sure that nothing slithers over the doorsill with the food drop, Mar. Seriously.\"\n Marlene stood in a wide-legged stance, grasping her walking stick in one hand horizontal to the tub, the other hand holding the huge black book of rituals,The Temt Tchaas , over his bathwater, as well as wearing an unyielding expression. She\u0027d opened a violet energy pyramid over him and he watched it hover just above his head, causing a tingling sensation and mild ripples in the water. Shabazz kept his Glock 9 cocked at the ready, his gaze keen, with blue-white static crackling down his locks and arms until it spilled down the barrel of his favorite weapon, Black Beauty.\n \"You do you right now,\" Marlene snapped. \"Mike, Rider, Jose, Yonnie, Bobby, and Berkfield are on the truck. \u0027Nez, Tara, Valkyrie, and Jasmine got the prayer line I laid down on lock and are slinging white light as we speak. Right now, brother, my main concern is that after I douse you for the third time, nothing jumps up outta that white bath or tries to drown your stubborn ass. I\u0027m following Aset\u0027s prescription to the letter.\"\n Carlos let out a hard breath and looked at Shabazz. \"Watch your aim, man.If you gotta shoot at least aim for my chest. You shoot where you\u0027re aiming right now and you might as well kill me.\"\n Despite how hungry everybody was, and no matter how good the food smelled, no one moved toward it. The team simply held hands, said the collective prayers led by Marlene,which took a full fifteen minutes to complete, and then when they dropped their grasps, everyone went for a weapon. Multiple clicks echoed through the dining room. Mom Delores pressed Ayana\u0027s face to her hip, shielding the child\u0027s vision.\n \"The baby is gonna remember this craziness all her natural life!\" Eyes wild, Delores sought Inez\u0027s gaze for comfort.\n \"Momma,\" Inez said quietly, holding a 9 sideways, pointed toward the broccoli. \"We just trying to be sure everythingis cool. I hate this as much as you do.\"\n Three tense minutes passed. Damali stepped forward, ignoring Carlos\u0027s narrowed gaze. \"It was trying to get one of the Neterus, so I\u0027ll be the guinea pig.\"\n Carlos grabbed her forearm and drove his sword of Ausar into the table, rattling dishes. \"Uh-uh. Whitelight it to heat up the dishes, I\u0027ll see what we\u0027ve got, then . . . if it\u0027s cool, we all bust a grub.\"\n She nodded.\"All right. Make it do what itdo .\"\n No sooner than she\u0027d said it, a wave of white-light energy rippled off his blade over the tablecloth and down the floor. The heat swirled over the dishes, causing casseroles to bubble and steam to waft off cooled vegetables. Guardians redoubled their stances, holding weapons with two hands, waiting.\n \"This is a damned travesty,\" Rider argued, watching the salad with a frown. \"So it has come to this-the blade of Ausar is a kitchen aid and we can\u0027t even have a glass of water in our own home without calling the freakin\u0027 Vatican for an exorcism. Well, dammit, I for one refuse to live like this! C\u0027mon out of the romaine lettuce, you slimy little bastards! I am sick and fuckin-\"\n \"Rider!C\u0027mon, man!\" Big Mike yelled.\"Chill!\"\n \"Chill?Is it me, or does it seem strange to anyone else but me that we\u0027re now worried that the bogey man might jump out from under the croutons?\"\n \"Jack . . . the language,\" Tara said in a weary tone. \"She\u0027s three. I\u0027ll wash your mouth out myself if you drop another f-bomb around her.\"\n \"Thank you, T,\" Mike said. \"Don\u0027t make me shoot you, man. Thekid don\u0027t need to see that, either.\"\n \"All right, all right, I\u0027m sorry.\" Rider sighed and looked at Ayana\u0027s wide brown eyes. \"Uncle Jack is having a real hard time because he\u0027s hungry, his blood sugar is low, and he\u0027s cranky. Don\u0027t say bad words like him. Okay? I\u0027m sorry, sweetie.\"\n \"I don\u0027t say bad words \u0027cause Nana will whip my butt.\" The child looked up at her grandmother with a wide-eyed stare.\n \"Good looking out, Nana,\" Rider said with a smirk. \"Oh,man . . .\" He put his gun back in the holster. \"All we need now is a visit from Child Protective Services, huh? Uncles curse, drink, and the whole family levels weapons at the dinner table, while Nana whips a little girl\u0027s butt.Lovely. I don\u0027t care if larvae as big as me come out of the mac and cheese, I\u0027m eating dinner. They have protein in them anyway and grubs are a delicacy in the Philippines or some damned where-I saw it on the National Geographic Channel. Maybe it was Borneo?\"\n \"Rider, man,\" Carlos warned, \"you weren\u0027t in the kitchen with me and D this morning. It was nasty, bro.For real. You might wanna ease up.\"\n With that Rider shrugged, pulled out a chair, and flopped down in it, and then dug a big serving spoon into the macaroni and cheese. No one moved as Rider flung a huge glob of the casserole onto his plate, poured brown gravy all over it, then picked up his fork. Jasmine cringed. Marjorie closed her eyes. Inez made a face. Val held her breath. Damali put her hands behind her back and rocked on her heels.\n \"If anything starts moving, I swear I\u0027ll barf,\" Jasmine said in a tense whisper.\n Krissy covered her mouth and dry-heaved while Juanita and Heather hugged themselves. Tara chuckled. Marlene just shook her head. The male members of the team passed nervous glances, but for a moment, none of them moved.\n \"The answer to your question is, I don\u0027t know,\" Tara said, finally sitting down beside Rider.\n \"What question?\" Rider mumbled through a mouthful of food.\n \"The question every woman in this room is silently asking, how do I live with you? Truthfully, I don\u0027t know.\"\n It was back to a wartime drill.Shifts. Over the next twenty-four hours, the watch would be split up into thirds, eight-hour details so that each couple could get some rest and so that everyone would be fresh when they got the word that it was time to move out. Bellies were full and thank goodness nothing was wrong with the meal. Whatever grub was in the house was safe for now, and the bottled water and tea and coffee had also gotten a clean bill of health.\n J.L. and Krissy would take first watch and keep the computers going, along with Heather and Dan, Jasmine and Bobby, and Marj and Berkfield. That was the normal protocol; let the young bloods do the daylight and the less severe darkness with one senior couple. This time, Krissy would be on light duty and was only assigned so she could stay near J.L.\n But during the heart of the night, those with serious combat skills, night vision, and old vamp assets were on call. That meant Jose and Juanita, Tara and Rider, and Yonnie and Val were up. Then in the dangerous transition period from darkness to dawn going into full daybreak, the Neterus were up with Mar and Shabazz and Inez and Mike, whose audio capability could pick up a phantom whisper anywhere in the house at that hour.\n The worst part of it all, though, was the waiting . . . waiting for the Dark Realm to make a move, waiting for J.L.\u0027s complex programs to make sense of the chaos . . . waiting for the Covenant to provide reinforcements and a recommendation . . . waiting on the Light to give them sure guidance . . . waiting on a strategy to gel in her and Carlos\u0027s minds. Right now she felt like she was about to leap out of her skin.\n Sensing her tension, Carlos stripped his T-shirt over his head and flung it toward the bedroom hamper and missed. \"Get some rest, boo. We ain\u0027t gonna figure it out tonight and the shift change is gonna kick our asses like it always does. We haven\u0027t done this drill in a while, and you definitely need your rest.\"\n She watched the muscles move beneath his bronze skin as he unzipped his jeans and bent to unlace his Tims before stepping out of them. What seemed like steel cable made his shoulders and the width of his back expand as he moved to complete the simpletask. Reflex caused her gaze to slide down his spine and over the steel-cut lobes of his ass and thighs. Her husband\u0027s body was like a piece of stone art, and she always enjoyed watching him change his clothes, even if nothing in particular was going on. It was like appreciating a finely crafted sculpture. Damn . . . they\u0027d broken the mold when they made him.\n \"I can\u0027t turn off my mind, but at least I ate,\" Damali said after a distracted moment while drying her damp locks with a thick terry towel. She sat cross-legged in their huge king-sized bed in a pair of cut-off shorts and one of Carlos\u0027s wife-beater T-shirts, fending off the miscellaneous random thoughts that floated through her mind.\n \"Noticed you didn\u0027t touch the falafel they sent.\" He gave her a half smile as he stripped off his boxers and found a pair of gray sweats to put on.\n \"Ruined that dish for me for life, you know. Damn!\" She coaxed her mind and line of vision away from his groin.\n Carlos laughed. \"I couldn\u0027t watch Rider eat the mac and cheese and forget brown rice or white rice, period, for a long-ass time.\"\n \"But I feel Rider, though,\" Damali said, flinging the towel away from the bed in a sudden rush of annoyance. \"I feel violated by all of this. Like . . . WTF, ya know?\"\n \"Right-and since Ayana\u0027s not in the room,\" Carlos said, sitting down heavily on the edge of the bed, \"whatthe fuck! \"\n Damali stretched out her legs and fell back with her arms outstretched. \"I know, I know, I know . . . and the team is gonna freak when we tell them-like I\u0027m already freaked out that all this is happening while all this is happening, kiss my ass-what are we gonna do?\" She didn\u0027t even want to say the wordpregnant out loud now.\n Carlos shrugged. \"Make it up as we go along, like we always do. If you haven\u0027t noticed, I\u0027m trying very hard to keep my head on straight, keep doing this by the numbers like we always did . . . that\u0027s why I\u0027m going to sleep-will get up for our shift, just have to keep on the grind.\" He lay next to her on his side and leaned down to kiss her. \"One thing I\u0027m not gonna do, though, is stay up for eight hours and worry, then try to deal with this bullshit fried. Even vampires and whatever stop and regenerate, so you know we mere mortals need to. Get some rest, baby.\"\n \"We didn\u0027t used to roll like this,\" she said, giving him a sly smile as he fell back against the pillows.\n \"You didn\u0027t used to be pregnant.\"\n \"I take exception to that.\"\n He closed his eyes. \"That\u0027s just a statement of fact. I\u0027m not trying to argue or get philosophical. It is what it is and I\u0027m very happy that it is.Grateful. But after what we saw today, been through today, I just want to close my eyes and blot anything negative out for a few. Cool?\"\n She snuggled in closer to him and leaned up on one elbow. He glanced at the light and made it turn off with an agitated twist of his mind.\n \"I can see in the dark, you know.\"\n \"Baby . . .please . . . .For real.\"\n \"We used to think outside the box, get creative in solving anything they threw at us. We used to take risks, stay up all night, and figure out a solution-like you should have seen how horrified Krissy was today. That poor girl was watching the news reports getting overwhelmed to the point of tears-it\u0027s horrific what\u0027s happening. But I have a theory.\"\n \"Music, I know,\" he said in a weary tone and then slung his forearm over his eyes. \"Makes sense, \u0027cause Fallon is seriously pissed off and his mate, Lucrezia, is the queen of poison. The way me and Yonnie figured from the old days, Fallon probably stepped up because he was the only one on the council that was really hip to Yonnie\u0027s potential double-cross . . . so it makes sense it would be coming from his old empire strength. Thing is, we\u0027ve gotta isolate where he\u0027s rebounding from-and like I said, we ain\u0027t gonna figure it out tonight.\"\n \"But-\"\n Carlos leaned up and kissed her quickly and then flopped back against the pillows.\n \"We could make a reconnaissance run to-\"\n \"Are you crazy?\" Carlos removed his forearm from his eyes and stared at her in the dark.\n \"Well, yeah . . . you used to love that about me.Thought it was sexy.\"\n For a moment the two of them stared at each other and Damali finally cracked a smile.\n \"You were just messing with me, right?\"\n \"Okay, yeah . . . dang. You\u0027re so serious.\"\n \"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but thisis serious.\"\n She traced his chest with one finger. \"I know . . . but . . .\"\n \"Baby, if I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d swear you were high.\" Carlos sat up and looked at her hard, his brows knit.\n Damali giggled and threw her head back, allowing the blue-white moonlight coming in through the skylight to wash over her. \"I feelfantastic all of a sudden . . . just full of energy-bursting with it.\"\n \"I knew it . . . oh, shit, they got to you.Poisoned my wife!\" Carlos started to get out of bed but she held his arm tightly.\n \"No . . . this is normal. The rush Aset said I\u0027d get once I got past the first dicey month.\" She smiled widely and then hugged Carlos. \"I never got my period. The baby\u0027s gonna hold. Endorphins are making me giddy and I feel like I could run a marathon!\"\n He held her back, searching her eyes in the dark with a silvery gaze.\"You sure?\"\n \"Yeah,\" she whispered and then kissed him slowly. \"I miss you, too. The nausea issoooo gone.\"\n \"I love you right on back, baby,\" he said, gently but firmly pushing her away from him and trying to get her to lie down. \"Okay, now that we know what\u0027s going on, you get some rest. Tomorrow, we\u0027ll know more, J.L.\u0027s programs should have more details . . . but for now, you know . . . chill.\"\n \"It\u0027s such a rush, Carlos,\" she whispered. \"I feel like I\u0027m buzzing and I wanna go hunting.\"\n \"Thatcannot happen,\" he said with no nonsense in his tone.\n \"Remember what we used to do before going into a big battle?\" she said in a sexy murmur and then kissed his chest.\n \"Yeah, butthat also cannot happen. Go to sleep.\"\n She leaned back on her elbow, pouting.\"Who says and why not? It was part of our whole thing as a couple.\"\n \"Listen,\" he said gently, moving damp locks away from her face, \"it\u0027s still real early. Anything could happen. We just learned that there\u0027s a real bad contagion out in the world and I accidentally-once again-brought some of it into the house.\" He kissed the bridge of her nose and traced her cheek with one finger. \"Bringing it into the house is one thing . . . possibly bringing it into my wife is something I just can\u0027t live with. I love you.\"\n \"I love you, too,\" she said cradling his face. \"But it\u0027s been six weeks.\"\n He chuckled. \"Six weeks, three days\"-he glanced at the digital clock on his nightstand-\"and about five and a half hours, to be exact.\"\n She laughed softly while doodling on his chest with her fore-finger. \"Do you still think I\u0027m sexy, even though I\u0027m carrying?\"\n \"Completely,\" he murmured. \"Please go to sleep.\"\n \"Well, uhmmm . . . when do you think you might not feel so worried?\"\n He let out his breath hard and forced a smile. \"Nine months will go by before you know it, assuming we both live that long.\"\n \"What!\"\n \"Baby, it\u0027s for the best, you know that. We have to take the long view and the high road . . . before there were issues and I can\u0027t be the reason-\"\n \"Nine months, ohmigod, Carlos, you\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Well, yeah, I\u0027m serious. Why wouldn\u0027t I be? I don\u0027t even know why we\u0027re talking about it in the midst of the freakin\u0027 Armageddon. I can never figure out the female mind, no matter how many so-called psychic powers-\"\n \"Ninemonths,\" she said in a harsh whisper. \"Carlos Rivera, listen toyourself . I\u0027m not La Madonna.\"\n \"No disrespect to the genuine article, and definitely not trying to blaspheme or get us in trouble . . . I know there was andis only one . . . but, to me, you\u0027re my Madonna, okay?\"\n \"No, no, no, no, no,\" Damali said quickly, waving her hands in front of her. \"You can\u0027t think like that. I\u0027m your wife. No. Better yet, I\u0027m your lover-I was that before I became-\"\n \"Baby,\" Carlos said quietly and peacefully, his voice dipping to a caressing octave, \"you are carrying my child. I cannot process you as my lover and be able to think in terms of nine months without you . . . so work with me, here. Okay. Visualize . . . you are a vessel of the future, you are the one and only person who has ever had my back, walked through Hell with me, loved me to the bone. I\u0027m not doinganything to hurt my son. I say this mantra at least three times a day and more at night. So, you just rest, eat right, I\u0027ll bring you whatever you need . . . will-\"\n \"You said son,\" she shrieked. \"How do you knowthis! \"\n Carlos smiled and pecked her forehead with a kiss. \"You wanna go out hunting at night, got a kill-rush . . .sheeit , that\u0027smy boy.\"\n \"Oh, my God!What if it\u0027s a girl? Huh?Then what?\"\n He sat up in bed. \"Shit, well if it\u0027s my baby girl, then youdefinitely ain\u0027t going out, slaughtering demons, carrying her out there at night-uh-uh . . . ain\u0027t having it.\"\n Damali slapped her forehead and fell back against the pillows with a thud. \"You are such a chauvinist, Carlos . . . you arenot making sense! I\u0027m a huntress till I die-a Neteru!\" She popped up when he smiled and then shook him by his thick shoulders. \"This entire conversation is insane. Tomorrow we go into battle, we might die. All of this could be moot. The Neteru credo is to live in the present, prepare for the future, and never turn your back on the past. I want to make love to my husband who is now treating me like I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m . . . I don\u0027t know what?\"\n She stopped trying to shake him, which had been an exercise in futility. He was practically made of stone and unmovable.\n \"You were sick for weeks and I didn\u0027t want to bother you,\" he said, gathering her into his arms. He placed a breathy kiss against her temple and inhaled the scent of her freshly shampooed hair. \"Everything about you was new and fragile. No matter how much I want you, I\u0027d never violate our future. What I wanna do and what I\u0027m gonna do are two different things. Besides, I have just the outlet for all that pent-up energy . . . gonna seriously do some damage and hunt the bastards to the ends of-\"\n \"Yeah, but I\u0027m better now and I\u0027m okay,\" she whispered against his chest, closing her eyes tightly. \"And I\u0027m so horny.\"\n When he didn\u0027t immediately answer her, she looked up at him. A wide smile had slowly spread across his handsome face. Moonlight caught the brilliant white of his normally even teeth that were gradually changing as the slight crest of fang threatened his incisors.\n \"Go to sleep, boo.Hot damn , Itold you it was a boy!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shadows-vampire-huntress-legend-11/page-5.html","bookId":2535,"book":{"id":2535,"title":"The Shadows (Vampire Huntress Legend #11)","description":"Storyline: \n The Shadows (Vampire Huntress Legend #11) \n The Dark Realms are taking cover after an angel onslaught from On High.
