{"id":97062,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"18 HER EXPRESSION REMAINED PLACID, though she looked away, her inner focus gathering. \"A mammal,\" she said, \"evolved totally apart from Homo sapiens, on a volcanic island in the North Sea thousands of years before us. We share perhaps forty-five percent of our genes in common. The creatures look like us except that they tend to be taller and more long of limb. Their bone structure is almost entirely what we would call cartilage. When the pure creatures mate, the female ovulates on demand and the fetus develops within a matter of minutes or hours, it isn\u0027t clear to me-but whatever the case, it puts tremendous stress upon the mother. Birth is accompanied by severe pain, and the infant unfolds as a small adult and begins to grow to maturity immediately.\" Mona\u0027s entire demeanor changed at these words. She moved closer to Quinn, and he put his arm around her once more, kissing her quietly. \"The Taltos craves its mother\u0027s milk in order to grow,\" said Rowan. \"And without that milk it cannot develop properly. In the hour right after birth it runs the risk of being stunted forever. With that milk, and with its mother\u0027s full telepathic nurture, the baby reaches its full height within that hour. Six and a half feet is the usual. The males can be seven feet. It will go on drinking its mother\u0027s milk as long as it can. Weeks, months, years. But the toll on the mother is heavy.\" Rowan stopped. She put her hand up to support her forehead. A deep sigh came out of her. \"The milk . . .\" she said. \"The milk has curative properties. The milk can work a cure in humans.\" Her voice broke apart. \"Nobody really knows what that milk could do. . . .\" Deliberate flash of images. A bedroom with an elaborate half-tester bed and Rowan in the bed, sitting up, taking milk from the breast of a young female. Shut out. Gunfire. Several shots. Flash of Rowan digging in this very yard. Michael with her. Rowan wouldn\u0027t let go of the shovel. Body of the young female lying limp in the moist earth. Heartbreak. Rowan began again, voice strong, automatic: \"Nobody knows the lifespan of a pure Taltos. It could be thousands of years. Females clearly can become infertile in time. I\u0027ve seen one who was past her prime. She was a simpleton. She was found in rural India. Males? I know of only one in existence-the one who took Morrigan. They may remain potent till they die. Taltos tend in their natural state to be extremely naive and childlike. In ancient times, many died through clumsiness and accidents.\" She paused for a moment and then went on: \"The Taltos is telepathic, curious by nature and hardwired with a tremendous amount of basic historical and intellectual knowledge. It is born \u0027knowing,\u0027 as they say, all about the species itself, the island continent from which they came, and the places in the British Isles to which they migrated after the island was destroyed by the same volcano that created it. The glen of Donnelaith in Scotland was one of those strongholds. Maybe one of the last. \"That\u0027s what the Taltos was . . . when it was pure, before it knew about humankind or had any mixture with it. The population was culled by accidents, occasional pestilence, the females by overbreeding.\" \"What does this mean, hardwired?\" I said. \"I want to be sure I understand you.\" \"We\u0027re not hardwired,\" she said. \"We don\u0027t come into this world knowing how to build a house or speak a language. But a bird is hardwired to build its nest, to do a mating call, or a mating dance. A cat is hardwired to hunt for food, care for its kittens-even to eat them if they are weak or deformed.\" \"Yes, I see,\" I said. \"The Taltos is a highly intelligent primate that is hardwired with a tremendous fund of knowledge,\" she said. \"That and its extraordinary reproductive advantage are what make it so dangerous. Its naivete, its simplicity and lack of aggression are its vulnerabilities. It\u0027s also extremely sensitive to rhythm and music. You can almost paralyze a Taltos when you utter a long rhyme or sing a rhythmic song.\" \"I understand,\" I replied. \"How did they become mixed with humans?\" I asked. She seemed at a loss. \"Medically,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t know the answer. I only know that it happened.\" \"Humans inevitably came to the British Isles,\" said Michael. \"And there is a long history of \"the tall people\" and their fight with their more aggressive invaders. Interbreeding occurred. For human females it\u0027s almost always fatal. The woman conceives and then miscarries and bleeds to death. You can imagine the hatred and fear this inspired. As for the other way around, a human male would bring about an insignificant hemorrhage in a female Taltos. Nothing important there, except that if it happens repeatedly over years and years, it will use up the female\u0027s eggs.\" He paused, caught his breath and went on: \"Some successful breeding occurred and the offspring gave rise both to malformed \u0027little people\u0027 and Taltos with human genes, and humans with the genes of the Taltos. And as the centuries passed, all this became a matter of superstition and legend.\" \"Not so very neatly,\" said Rowan. Her voice was firmer than before, though her eyes still moved feverishly. \"There were terrible wars and massacres and unspeakable bloodshed. The Taltos, being far less aggressive than humans by nature, lost out to the new species. The Taltos were scattered. And they went into hiding. They pretended to be humans. They concealed their birthing rites. But as Michael said, couplings with humans did happen. And unbeknownst to the early inhabitants of the British Isles, there developed a kind of human who carried a giant helix of genes, twice the number of a normal human, and capable at any time of giving birth to the Taltos or a malformed elfin child struggling to be one. When two such humans happened to mate, a Taltos birth was even more likely.\" Rowan paused. Michael hesitated, and then, as she put her face into her hands, he continued the story. \"The secret genes were passed on by the Earls of Donnelaith, Scotland, and their kith and kin, this we know for certain, and superstitious legends grew up about any occasional Taltos child born to their household. \"Meantime, a May Day orgy gave way to a misalliance between an Earl and a common woman of the glen, which led in three generations to the foundation of the Mayfair family. The Taltos genes were passed on in this way to what would later become a great colonial clan, first on the Caribbean island of Saint-Domingue, and then here in Louisiana. \"But even before the Mayfair family had a name, the Talamasca had become intimately involved with its origins-recording the story of a witch by the name of Suzanne, who had called up a spirit quite by accident, a spirit who appeared to be a brown-eyed man who answered to the name Lasher-a spirit who was to haunt the family right down to Rowan\u0027s generation. The ghost originated in the glen of Donnelaith, as did the Mayfairs.\" Rowan broke in: \"You see, we thought it was the ghost of a human being,\" she said, \"or some astral being without a human story. I believed this even as it courted me, and I tried to control it.\" \"And it was a Taltos ghost,\" I said. \"Yes,\" she said, \"and it was biding its time, generation by generation, until a witch would come who would bear a Taltos child, a witch with psychic powers enough to aid it to possess that unborn Taltos fetus and be reborn within it.\" Michael interrupted: \"And I didn\u0027t know I had Mayfair genes in my blood. I never even dreamed. It was a dalliance between Oncle Julien and a riverfront Irish girl, and the child went to an Irish Catholic orphanage. And that was one of my ancestors.\" \"Oh, this Lasher was a clever ghost,\" said Rowan, shaking her head with a bitter smile. \"Over the generations he brought this family great wealth in any number of ways. Strong witches appeared in various generations who really knew how to use him. And the men he despised and punished if they got in his way. Except for Julien. Julien was the only Mayfair male strong enough to use Lasher to perfection. And Julien regarded Lasher as an evil thing, but even Julien thought that Lasher had once been human.\" \"Lasher himself thought so,\" said Michael. \"The ghost didn\u0027t fully understand who he was or what he wanted, except to be reborn. He guided everything to that purpose: to come through, to be flesh and blood again. I saw the ghost from the time I was a little kid, passing the fence outside. I\u0027d see him standing in the garden. I never dreamed that one day I\u0027d live in this house. I never dreamed that one day-.\" He stopped, clearly unable to continue. \"The Legacy was established very early on,\" said Mona. \"You had to keep the name Mayfair, whether you married out or not, if you were to be part of the family, if you were to be connected to the Legacy.\" \"And that way, the clan was kept close,\" said Rowan, \"and there was much interbreeding.\" \"And there is one Heiress in each generation,\" said Mona, wiping her nose, \"and that Heiress lives in this house and must be able to bear children.\" \"It was a matriarchy in legal and moral fact,\" said Rowan softly. \"And Michael and I . . . we fit the design of Lasher perfectly. Of course my child was not pure Taltos. It was Taltos mixed with human. It was perhaps five months in the womb. And on the night of its birth, there came Lasher with all his force down into the infant manniken making it grow and cry out to me to use all my power. Rowan the Mad Scientist knew the circuitry and the cells! Rowan the Mad Scientist knew how to guide the monstrous offspring.\" She closed her eyes. She turned away, as though the remembrance was pressing against her. Brilliant flash of the Man Baby, tall, slippery, face evincing wonder, gawky, pinkish limbs. Rowan clothing it as the creature laughed delightedly. Flash of it clutching her breast, drinking. Rowan sinking to the floor in unconsciousness. The creature drinking hungrily from the other breast as well. My Darling, what secrets these are, indeed. Silence. A look of pure torment on the face of Michael. How well I understood his pain now, that he had fathered these creatures, and apparently no others. Stirling appeared fearful as before, yet shamelessly fascinated. Mona, her eyes closed, leaned against Quinn as he watched Rowan. Sounds of the garden-soft, inevitable, indifferent, sweet. \"Walking Babies, horrible things,\" said Dolly Jean from her sleep. \"If only I\u0027d a known that ghost was a Walking Baby, but the thought never entered my head. . . .\" \"Not my girl,\" whispered Mona. \"My girl wasn\u0027t a horrible thing. Her father was the demon, but not her.\" Michael fighting with the creature called Lasher. Snow and ice. The creature tremendously slippery and crafty and flexible and invulnerable to the blows. The creature laughing and mocking Michael. The creature knocking Michael into the ice-cold swimming pool, Michael sinking down to the bottom. Sirens, trucks, Rowan and the creature running towards the car . . . \"I left with it,\" Rowan whispered. \"This Man Child thing with no name other than the name of a ghost. I left Michael. I took it away. The Mad Scientist thought first and foremost to save it from those who might have destroyed it, and it had possessed the body of Michael\u0027s child and sent that child\u0027s true soul Heavenward, and I knew that Michael wouldn\u0027t stop until he\u0027d killed it, and so I fled with it. It was a dreadful error.\" Silence. Rowan remained turned to the side, as though away from all that she\u0027d said, her eyes closed, her hands limp on the table. I wanted to enfold her in my arms. I did nothing. Michael remained still. Father of this monster. No. Sent that child\u0027s true soul Heavenward. Father of the mysterious body only, the vehicle for the mystery. \"The Taltos,\" I said to Rowan, \"it fathered a daughter in you? You bore two of these creatures?\" Rowan nodded. She opened her eyes and looked at me with a steady gaze. There might as well have been no one else there. \"The male was an atrocity,\" she said. \"A spiritual monster. It had two goals-to remember what it had been, as Taltos memories inundated it-and to father a female with which to breed. I lost control of it almost immediately. I miscarried again and again as it drank my breasts dry. Only in the very beginning could I lure it into laboratories or hospitals, where, using my authority, I managed to accomplish some tests and secretly forward the material on to a laboratory in San Francisco. \"As the Heiress of the Legacy, I could draw all the money we needed from our foreign accounts, as long as I stayed one jump ahead of the family, which was searching for me. So the creature had the funds to drag me on a world odyssey. In the glen of Donnelaith, a torrent of memories came back to it. But it was soon desperate to get back to the States. \"I chose Houston as a city where we might settle and I could study it. Among hospitals and medical centers, I thought I could order the equipment for a laboratory and not be discovered. Unbeknownst to me this was perfect for the fiend. Having no luck with me, he was soon leaving me tied up, starved and near insane. Only much later did I learn that he was making the short journey to New Orleans to mate with random female Mayfairs. Of course his victims fatally miscarried, and were found dead in their own blood. \"The family was in a panic. \"Mayfair women began dying one after another. And they couldn\u0027t trace Rowan who had abandoned Michael for the fiend. And Rowan was now a prisoner. Soon Mayfair women everywhere were surrounded by armed guards. The creature came to First Street and almost gained access to Mona. \"But Mona, in the time of my desertion, had made love with Michael and was already carrying a Taltos child, though she didn\u0027t know it. \"At last, when I\u0027d almost given up hope of life, I conceived another child of my own. And the child spoke to me. It said the very word \u0027Taltos.\u0027 It told me its name: Emaleth. It spoke of times its father couldn\u0027t remember. In the secret telepathic voice, I told it that when it was born it was to go to Michael in New Orleans. I told it about the house on First Street. If I should die, it must reach Michael with word of my death. We talked to each other in silence. \"Lasher was jubilant when he heard the child\u0027s voice! He would soon have his bride. It was then, as he softened to me, that I managed to escape. With the filthy clothes on my back I made for the highway. \"I never made it home. They found me comatose in a roadside park, bleeding from an apparent miscarriage. No one dreamed I\u0027d given birth to Emaleth, and she, poor orphan, unable to rouse me or draw more milk from me, had started her long trek to New Orleans on foot. \"I was rushed home. In the hospital they had to remove my organs to stop the hemorrhaging. It probably saved me from the wasting sickness that later almost destroyed Mona. But my brain had been severely damaged. I remained in a deep coma. \"I was unconscious upstairs when Lasher, dressed as a priest, slipped past the guards and into this house, and appealed to the Talamasca and to Michael to let him live. After all, was he not a priceless specimen? He counted on the Talamasca to save him. He poured out a tale of his former life. It\u0027s a fascinating study of the innocence of the Taltos. But Lasher wasn\u0027t innocent. Lasher had brought death. Michael fought him and killed him. And so his long rule of the Mayfair family came to an end. I was still comatose when Emaleth came and bent to give me her healing milk. \"When I woke and saw the Taltos daughter I had birthed, and realized I was drinking from her breast, I was horrified. This gangly creature with a baby face terrified me. It was a moment of dislocated lucidity. And here I was nursing from the creature as if I were a helpless baby. I grabbed the bedside gun. I killed her. I did that. I destroyed her. That quick and she was no more.\" She shook her head. She looked away as we do when we sink into the past. Guilt, loss . . . her pain seemed beyond these words. \"It didn\u0027t have to happen,\" she murmured. \"What had she done but make her way to the house as I had taught her? What had she done but brought me back to consciousness with her plentiful milk? One lone female Taltos. How could she hurt me? It was the loathing of Lasher that warped my mind. It was the revulsion at this alien species and my own atavistic behavior. \"And so she died, my girl. And there were two graves beneath this oak. And I, risen from the coma, a monster now myself, buried her.\" She sighed. \"My lost girl,\" she said. \"I had betrayed her.\" Quiet. Even the garden was hushed. The low roar of a passing car seemed as natural as a breeze stirring the trees. I was suspended in Rowan\u0027s sadness. Stirling\u0027s eyes were moist and aglow in the shadows as he studied Rowan. Michael said not a word. Then Mona spoke very gently. \"There was trouble in the Talamasca,\" she said. \"It all had to do with the Taltos. Some members had tried to get control of Lasher. They\u0027d even done murder. Michael and Rowan took off for Europe to try to investigate the corruption inside the Order. They felt a familial tie with the Talamasca. We all did. And during that time, I realized I was pregnant. My child began to grow out of control. It began to speak to me. It told me its name was Morrigan.\" Her voice broke. \"I was enchanted, crazed.\" \"I went south to Fontevrault plantation house where Dolly Jean was living, and she and Mary Jane Mayfair, my cousin, my friend who later ran away, she and Dolly Jean, they helped me to give birth to Morrigan. It was really, really painful. And beyond scary. But Morrigan was tall and beautiful. No one could look at Morrigan and not say she was beautiful. She was shining and fresh and magical.\" Dolly Jean gave a little cackle in her half sleep. \"She knew a whole jumble of human things,\" she said. \"Just a real beastie!\" \"You loved her at the time,\" said Mona, \"you know you did.\" \"I\u0027m not saying I didn\u0027t,\" said Dolly Jean, squinting at Mona, \"but what do you make of somebody who tells you she\u0027s going to take over the whole family and make it a clan of Walking Babies? Was I supposed to be tickled at that?\" \"She was just born!\" said Mona softly. \"She didn\u0027t know what she meant. She had my ambition, my dreams.\" \"I don\u0027t know where she is,\" said Rowan in her deep heartfelt voice. \"I don\u0027t know whether she\u0027s alive or dead.\" Mona was deeply miserable, but I had so shamed her over her tears that she held them back painfully. I tried to take her hand. She drew away. \"But you knew the Taltos who came and took her!\" Mona said to Rowan. \"You had met him in Europe. He had heard the story of you and Lasher in your wanderings.\" She turned to me. \"That\u0027s what happened. He had found them. Yes, another one, an ancient survivor. He was their friend. Of course, they didn\u0027t tell me and they didn\u0027t tell Morrigan. Oh no, we were children! They kept it to themselves! Imagine. An ancient one. Hadn\u0027t I suffered enough to be told about him? And when he came here, they let him take my daughter away.\" \"How could I have stopped them?\" asked Rowan. \"You were with us,\" she said to Mona. \"Morrigan was maddened by the scent of the male on our clothes, on the gifts we\u0027d received from him. And why he came, we\u0027ll never know. All we know is what you know. He was out in the garden. She went to the window. She ran out to him. There was no stopping either of them. We never saw them again.\" \"Mona, we searched for him by every conceivable means,\" said Michael. \"Surely you must believe us.\" \"I want the files,\" said Mona, \"the paperwork. His name, the names of his companies in New York. He was a rich man, a powerful man, this ancient wise one. You admitted that much.\" \"I\u0027ll be glad to give it to you,\" said Rowan, \"but please understand, he liquidated everything. He vanished.\" \"If only you\u0027d searched right away,\" Mona said bitterly. \"Mona, you agreed with us at the time,\" said Rowan. \"We would wait until they contacted us. We respected their choice to be together. We didn\u0027t think they would simply disappear. We couldn\u0027t imagine it.\" \"We were afraid of hearing from them,\" said Michael. \"We had no idea how they could multiply or survive in the modern world, how Ash could control them.\" \"Ash was the name of the man,\" I said. \"Yes,\" said Michael. His pain opened up as he spoke. \"Ash Templeton. Ashwas ancient. He had been alone for so long it was unimaginable. He\u0027d seen his species become extinct. He was the one who told us the history of the Taltos. He believed that the Taltos couldn\u0027t survive in the world of humans. After all, he\u0027d seen them wiped out. His was a tragic history. Of course, as we listened to his stories we had no idea that Morrigan even existed. We left Ash in New York. We loved him. We pledged eternal friendship. Then we got home and discovered Morrigan.\" \"Maybe it was some telepathic sense that guided him to Morrigan,\" I said. \"We don\u0027t know,\" said Rowan. \"But he came here, he entered the side garden, he saw her through the windows, and she picked up his scent and she ran to him.\" \"For years we were afraid,\" said Michael. \"We combed the news services for any story that might involve the Taltos. We were on the alert and so was the Talamasca. Mona, you must think back to the time before you were so sick. You must remember. We were afraid because we knew that the species might do great harm to human beings.\" \"Well put!\" said Dolly Jean. \"And Morrigan all fired up to rule the world, preaching that her vision came from her human father and mother. When she wasn\u0027t looking back she was looking ahead, or dancing in circles or sniffing at scents, she was a wild beastie.\" \"Oh hush up, Dolly Jean, please,\" whispered Mona, biting her lower lip, \"you know you loved her. And all of you-I wanted to look for them long before you did. For years you wouldn\u0027t tell me that name. Oh, just leave it in your hands. Leave it in the hands of Mayfair and Mayfair. And now you say it as if it\u0027s nothing. Ash Templeton. Ash Templeton.\" She started to cry. \"That\u0027s not true,\" said Michael. \"I acknowledged this creature as my daughter. You know I did. We began to search before we told you about it. We didn\u0027t know how sick you would get.\" His voice was raw, but he swallowed and moistened his dried lips with his tongue, and then he continued: \"We didn\u0027t know yet how badly you would need the Taltos milk. We only learned that in time. But we tried to contact Ash, and we discovered that he had sold all his holdings. He\u0027d vanished from the banks, the stock exchanges, the world markets.\" \"Whatever his feelings for us,\" Rowan said, \"he chose to disappear. He chose to keep his future secret.\" Mona was sobbing against Quinn. It broke Michael\u0027s heart to see it. Stirling spoke up, his voice assuming a reverent authority: \"Mona,\" he said, \"the Talamasca began to search for Ash and Morrigan almost immediately. We tried to do it in an unobtrusive way. But we searched. We found some evidence that they had visited Donnelaith. But after that, the trail went cold. And please believe me now when I tell you again: we\u0027ve never found the slightest trace of them anywhere.\" \"That\u0027s actually quite surprising,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not speaking to you,\" cried Mona, glaring at me and then drawing close to Quinn as if she was afraid of me. \"Some evidence of them should have turned up,\" I said, \"no matter what happened to them.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always thought,\" said Michael. \"For two, three years we lived in dread of their surfacing in some catastrophic way. I can\u0027t tell you all my fears. I thought: what if the young ones bred out of control? What if they rose up against Ash? What if they committed murders? And then when we stopped living in fear and started to search, nothing.\" Dolly Jean chuckled again, bringing up her shoulders and letting her head sink down and rocking back and forth. \"Walking Babies can kill humans easy as humans can kill Walking Babies. They could be breeding somewhere, breeding like fire, spreading in all directions, hiding in the valleys and the hills, in the mountains and on the plains, traveling over land and sea, and then comes the ringing of a loud bell, and they all walk out all over the world at the same time and they shoot one human being apiece, bang, and they take over the entire planet!\" \"Save that for Tante Oscar,\" said Rowan under her breath with a cool lift of her eyebrows. (I winked at Dolly Jean. She nodded and wagged her finger.) Michael looked directly at Mona and leaned in towards her as he addressed her. \"I hope we\u0027ve given you what you need,\" he said. \"As for the files, I\u0027ll see that they\u0027re all copied and delivered to you wherever you like. They\u0027ll prove our efforts to track down every lead. We\u0027ll give you every scrap of paper we have on Ash Templeton.\" \"Of course,\" said Dolly Jean, \"they could both be stone-cold dead in the grave like Romeo and Juliet! Two Walking Babies all wrapped up in each other\u0027s arms, just rotting away somewhere to cartilage. Like maybe he couldn\u0027t stand her ranting and raving and all her plans, and he tied a silk stocking around her neck and-.\" \"Stop it, Dolly Jean!\" cried Mona. \"Don\u0027t you say another word or I\u0027ll scream!\" \"You\u0027re screaming now, be still!\" whispered Quinn. In my heart of hearts I entered into a debate with myself, and then I spoke: \"I\u0027ll find them,\" I said quietly. I startled everyone. Mona turned to me resentfully. \"Just what do you mean by that!\" she demanded. Her handkerchief was full of blood tears. I looked at her as disdainfully as I could, considering how tender and pretty she was, and how wicked and fiendish I was, and then I looked across the table at Rowan. \"I want to thank you all for sharing your secrets with us,\" I said. I looked at Michael. \"You\u0027ve trusted us, and treated us as if we were sinless and kind, and I don\u0027t know that we are. But I know that we try to be.\" A slow broad smile lit up Rowan\u0027s face, extraordinary to behold. \"Sinless and kind,\" she repeated. \"How marvelous are those words. If only I could work them into a hymn and sing it under my breath day and night, day and night. . . .\" We looked at each other. \"Give me a little time. If they still exist, if they\u0027ve parented a colony, if they\u0027re anywhere in the wide world, I know those who will know where they are-without question.\" Rowan raised her eyebrows and looked off thoughtfully, and the smile came again-a lamp of loveliness. She nodded. Michael seemed vaguely stimulated by my words, and Stirling was curious and respectful. \"Sure enough,\" said Dolly Jean, without opening her eyes, \"you didn\u0027t think he was the oldest Blood Child in the world, did you? And you mark my words,\" she said to me, \"you big old great thing, you sure are pretty as an angel, and you\u0027ve got plenty charm enough to be a gangster. I\u0027ve seen every gangster movie ever made three times and I know what I\u0027m talking about. They put a little boot black on your hair, you could play Bugsy Siegel.\" \"Thank you,\" I replied soberly. \"It was always my ambition to play Sam Spade, actually. I was all alone and forlorn when the Black Mask magazine first published The Maltese Falcon. I read the novel by the light of the moon. Sam Spade captured my ambition.\" \"Well, no wonder you talk like a gangster,\" said Dolly Jean. \"But Sam Spade\u0027s small time. Go for Bugsy Siegel or Lucky Luciano.\" \"Stop this!\" screamed Mona. \"Don\u0027t you realize what he\u0027s just said?\" She was painfully confused, trying to crush her sobs, trying to crush her rage against me. \"You can really do this?\" she asked in a little bewildered voice. \"You can find Ash and Morrigan?\" I didn\u0027t answer. Let her suffer for a night. I rose from the table. I bent to kiss Rowan on the cheek. My hand found hers and held it tight for a small, heated moment.A precious garden closed against me, is my sister, my beloved bride. Her fingers caught mine and held them with all her strength. The gentlemen had risen to see me off. I murmured my superficial farewells, and only then did the secret grip release me. I walked slowly into the formal garden beyond the pool, and would have gone up into the roaring clouds, to be as far away from the Earth as I could be. But Mona\u0027s piteous cry rang behind me. \"Lestat, don\u0027t leave me!\" Across the lawn she came running, her silk dress billowing. \"Oh, you miserable girl!\" I said, deliberately gnashing my teeth. I received her in my embrace, sweet bundle of panting limbs. \"You intolerable witch. You wicked undisciplined Blood Child. You contemptible pupil. You worsling, you rebellious and obstinate fledgling.\" \"I adore you with my whole soul, you\u0027re my creator, my mentor, my guardian, I love you,\" she cried. \"You have to forgive me!\" \"No, I don\u0027t,\" I said. \"But I will. Go take a proper leave of your family. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night. I must be alone now.\" Off to the deepest pocket of the garden I went- -and thence to the clouds, and the merciless unknowing stars, and as far from mortaldom as I could get. \"Maharet,\" I called out to the very most ancient one, \"Maharet, I\u0027ve made promises to those I love. Help me to keep them. Lend your most powerful ear to those whom I love. Lend your most powerful ear to me.\" Where was she, the tower of ivory? The great ancestor. The one who now and then came to our aid. I had no clue, because I had never bent my stiff neck to go in search of her. But I knew that in her centuries of endurance she had acquired powers that surpassed all dreams and fears of mine, and that she could hear me if she chose. Maharet, our guardian, our mother, listen to my plea. I sang the song of the tall ones, the long-extinct ones, come again to form a colony, lost somewhere in the modern world. Gentle beings, out of time, out of place, and maybe out of luck. And of such tragic import to my fledgling and her human kindred. Don\u0027t make me say so much that other immortals might gather up my intent and use it to bad ends. Hear me, Sweet Maharet, wherever you are. Surely you know this world as no one else knows it. Have you spied these tall children? I don\u0027t dare to say their name. And then I wrapped myself in comforting phantasms, roaming the winds for my own sake, dissolved now and then in the poetry of love, and envisioning bowers of love, places of Divine safety foreordained beyond Good and Evil, where I and the one I coveted could dwell. It was a doomed vision and I knew it, but it was mine to enjoy.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-18.html","bookId":2596,"book":{"id":2596,"title":"Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10)","description":"Storyline: Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10) Lestat is back with a vengeance and in thrall to Rowan Mayfair. Both demon and angel, he is drawn to kill but tempted by goodness as he moves among the pantheon of Anne Rice\u0027s unforgettable characters. Julien Mayfair, his tormentor; Rowan, witch and neurosurgeon, who attracts spirits to herself, casts spells on others and finds herself dangerously drawn to Lestat; Patsy, country and western singer, who was killed by Quinn Blackwood and dumped in a swamp; Ash Templeton, a 5,000 year old Taltos whose genes live on in the Mayfairs. Now, Lestat fights to save Patsy\u0027s ghost from the dark realms of the Earthbound, to uncover the mystery of the Taltos and to decide the fate of Rowan Mayfair. Both of Anne Rice\u0027s irresistible realms - the worlds of Blackwood Farm and the Mayfair Witches - collide as Lestat struggles between his lust for blood and the quest for life, between gratification and redemption.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:10 PM"}}
