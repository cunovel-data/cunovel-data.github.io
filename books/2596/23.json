{"id":97067,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"23 EVERY NOW AND THEN, I demand to be treated like the supernatural hero that I am. I strode back to the house, ignoring Quinn and Mona (especially Mona), and opened the kitchen door, and told Jasmine that Patsy\u0027s spirit was definitely gone from the Earth, and that I was spent and that I needed to sleep in Aunt Queen\u0027s bed, no matter what anybody thought about it. Obstreperous little Jerome jumped up from his tiny table and cried: \"But I never got to see her! Mamma, I never got to see her.\" \"I\u0027ll draw you a picture, sit down!\" said Jasmine and, with the incontestable authority of the lady with the keys, she led me across the hall and admitted me to the sacrosanct chamber at once, mumbling that Mona had made a mess of the closets only two hours before, but everything was now put right, and I flung myself theatrically upon the rose satin bed, beneath the rose satin canopy, nuzzled into the rose satin pillows and lay there, drenched in the scent of Chantilly, allowing Jasmine to pull off my dirty boots because it made her happy, and protected the bed, and I closed my eyes. At once Quinn said in a soft, respectful voice, \"Lestat, may Mona and I keep watch with you? We\u0027re so grateful for what you did.\" \"Out of my sight,\" I said. \"Jasmine, please light all the lamps and then make them get out of here. Patsy is gone, and my soul is weak! I have seen the feathered wings of angels. Don\u0027t I deserve to sleep for this little while?\" \"You get out of here, Tarquin Blackwood and Mona Mayfair!\" Jasmine said. \"Thank the Lawd that Patsy\u0027s gone! I can feel it. That child was just lost and now she\u0027s way up home and no more searching. I\u0027m taking these boots to Allen. Allen\u0027s the boot expert on this property. Allen can clean these boots. Now, you two go on, you heard what the man said. His soul is weak. Now let him be. Lestat, I\u0027m getting you a blanket.\" Amen. I drifted. Julien was at my ear in heated French: \"I\u0027ll follow you to the ends of the Earth through all your endeavors until you are ruined in madness! Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. All that you do is vanity, and for your own pride and glory! You think the angels don\u0027t know what you do and for whom you do it!\" \"Aw, yeah!\" I whispered, \"you spiteful ghost, you thought you had me between the worlds, didn\u0027t you? Is that where you live forever, watching them pass you by? You didn\u0027t give a damn for Patsy\u0027s soul, did you? And did she not descend from you as surely as Quinn? And Mona? You did the beast with two backs in this very house with Patsy\u0027s ancestor too, did you not, you don\u0027t know your own descendants when they\u0027re not to your taste, you merciless astral panhandler. . . .\" I drifted deeper, brain descending into the sweetness of human exhaustion-far from the ring of the anvil between the worlds, far from the torrent of Heaven. Adieu, my poor doomed Patsy. Yes, and I had done it with a kiss, and yes, with a step, and yes, she had gone up, and wasn\u0027t it good? Had I not done good? Could anybody deny it was good? Yo, Juanito, wasn\u0027t it good? Wasn\u0027t the exorcism of Goblin good? I sank back into the safety of know-nothing sleep. And round about, the golden lighted room protected me. What could I do that was good for Mona and Quinn? Two hours later I was awakened by the chiming of a clock. I didn\u0027t know where in the house it was or what it looked like and I didn\u0027t care. The room was wholesome and reassuring, as if the purity and generosity of Aunt Queen had totally infused it. I was refreshed. The evil little cells in my body had done their dirty and inevitable work. And if I\u0027d had any terrible dreams I didn\u0027t remember them. Lestat was Lestat again. As if anyone cared. Do you care? I sat up. Julien was sitting at Aunt Queen\u0027s little round table, the table at which she had taken her meals, the table between the bed and the closet doors. He wore his fancy dinner jacket. He smoked a little black cigarette. Stella sat on the couch in her pretty white dress. She was playing with one of Aunt Queen\u0027s floppy boudoir dolls. \"Bonjour, Lestat,\" said Stella. \"At last you wake, you handsome Endymion.\" \"Everything you do,\" Julien said in French, \"you do for your own selfish aims. You want these mortals to love you. You bask in their blind adoration. You devour it like blood. Are you tired of killing and destroying?\" \"You\u0027re not making sense,\" I replied. \"Being dead, you should know better. The dead should have an edge. You don\u0027t have one. You hang out in the alleyways of the other world. I saw you for what you are.\" He smiled a wicked little smile. \"Exactly what is your paltry plan?\" he asked in French, \"to send me through the cloudy Heavens the way you did Patsy Blackwood?\" \"Hmmm. Why should I bother with your salvation?\" I asked. \"As I told you before, I\u0027m getting used to you. I feel privileged, having these little t¨ºte-¨¤-t¨ºtes, no matter where you come from. And then there\u0027s Stella. Stella is a delight always.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re so sweet,\" said little Stella. She held the doll up by the arms. \"You know, Ducky, you present the most bizarre problem.\" \"Do explain,\" I said. \"Nothing delights me more than children who spout philosophy.\" \"Don\u0027t be sure that I\u0027m capable of a philosophical observation,\" she replied, frowning and smiling at me at the same time. She let the doll flop in her lap. She lifted her shoulders, then slowly relaxed. \"This is what I think about you, Ducky. You have a conscience without a soul to back it up. Quite unique, I should say.\" A dark shiver passed through me. \"Where is my soul, Stella?\" I asked. She seemed at a loss, but then she spoke: \"Entangled!\" she said. \"Caught in a web! But your conscience flies free of your soul. It\u0027s simply marvelous.\" Julien smiled. \"We\u0027ll find a way to cut that web,\" he said. \"Oh, so you mean to save my soul?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t care where it goes once it leaves this Earth,\" Julien replied. \"Haven\u0027t I told you that? It\u0027s the fleshly shell I detest, the evil blood that enlivens it, the appetite that drives it, and the consuming pride that motivated it to take my niece.\" \"You\u0027re overwrought,\" I said. \"Remember the child. You must have had some purpose in bringing her with you as a witness. Behave decently in her presence.\" The knob on the hall door turned. They vanished. Such shy retiring individuals. The doll fell over on the couch, and, having no elbows or knees, looked most bereft as it stared with its big painted eyes at the room around it. Quinn and Mona entered. Quinn had changed into a big cable knit sweater and simple slacks, for the air- conditioning at Blackwood Farm was a force to be reckoned with, and Mona was still in her gorgeous black dress, her pale face and hands glowing. A cameo was now fixed at her neck, a very large and beautiful one of white and blue sardonyx. \"Can we talk now?\" Quinn asked in a very polite tone. He looked at Mona with great concern, then his eyes returned to me. I realized that Quinn had been quite right in his early description to me of his love for Mona. Mona\u0027s unhappiness-indeed Mona herself, whether happy or sad-continued to supplant all Quinn\u0027s own woes and griefs in his own heart. She continued to deliver him mercifully, at least for now, from the loss of Aunt Queen, and the loss of his doppelganger, Goblin. Whatever the little scorpion did to me, his love for her was a blessing. How else explain the ease with which he accepted me usurping Aunt Queen\u0027s magnificent bed in my, how shall we put it, vanity? I pushed back against the pillows until I was firmly planted in an upright position, with legs comfortably stretched out and ankles crossed, and I nodded. Seldom did I see my feet in black socks. I knew almost nothing personally about my feet. They looked rather small for the twenty-first century. Bad luck. But six feet was still a good height. \"I want you to know that I adored Aunt Queen,\" I muttered. \"I slept on top of the counterpane. I was shaken.\" \"Beloved Boss, you make a picture there,\" Quinn said kindly. \"Make this your place here. You know my aunt. She slept all day. Every window\u0027s fitted with a black-out blind beneath the fancy velvet.\" These words had an immensely soothing effect. I gave him to know that silently. He sat on the bench before Aunt Queen\u0027s dressing table, with his back to the big round mirror and the soft lamplight. Mona sat on the couch, very near to the doll that the ghost of Stella had just left there. \"Are you rested now?\" Mona asked, pretending to be a decently behaved creature. \"Do something useful,\" I said disdainfully to Mona. \"Pick up that boudoir doll and set it down properly, so it doesn\u0027t look so lost.\" \"Oh, yes, certainly,\" she said, as if she wasn\u0027t a roaring revenant from Hell. She set the doll against the padded arm of the chair, crossed its legs and put its little hands in its lap. It stared at me gratefully. \"What happened to you out there, Lestat?\" Quinn asked. His manner was very solicitous. \"Not certain,\" I replied. \"Some force wanting to take me with her, maybe. We were connected as she started to rise. But I managed to get away. Not sure. I see angels sometimes. It\u0027s frightening. Can\u0027t talk about it. Don\u0027t want to relive it. But Patsy is gone on. That\u0027s what\u0027s important.\" \"I saw the Light,\" said Quinn. \"I saw it without mistake, but I never saw the spirit of Patsy.\" He had such a sincere manner about him, nothing fanciful. \"I saw it too,\" said the banshee. \"And you were fighting with someone, and you were cursing in French, and you cried out something about Oncle Julien.\" \"Doesn\u0027t matter now,\" I said, eyes on Quinn. \"As I said, I\u0027d rather not relive it.\" \"Why did you do it?\" Quinn asked, respectfully. \"What on Earth do you mean?\" I asked. \"It had to be done, didn\u0027t it?\" \"I realize that,\" said Quinn. \"But why you? I\u0027m the one who murdered Patsy. And you went out there alone and drew her spirit to you. You brought the Light down for her. There was a struggle. Why did you do it?\" \"For you, I suppose,\" I said with a shrug. \"Maybe I didn\u0027t think anybody else could do it. Or I did it for Jasmine, because I\u0027d promised her the ghost wouldn\u0027t get her. Or for Patsy. Yes, for Patsy.\" I brooded. I said, \"You\u0027re both so young in the Blood. You\u0027ve seen so little. I\u0027ve seen the howling wind of the Earthbound Dead. I\u0027ve seen their souls in the void between the realms. When Mona said that Patsy didn\u0027t know she was dead, that settled it for me. So I went out there and I did it.\" \"And then there was the song,\" said the little harpy, looking at Quinn. \"Tommy played the Irish song and it was so mournful.\" \"Speaking of her songs, I made good on the promise,\" said Quinn. \"Or at least I\u0027ve started. I called Patsy\u0027s agent, got him out of bed. We\u0027re going to reissue all her recordings, do a special publicity release-all that she could ever have wanted. Her agent\u0027s so thrilled that she\u0027s dead, he could hardly contain himself.\" \"What!\" said Mona. \"Oh, you know, dead recording stars make plenty of money,\" Quinn replied with a little shrug. \"He\u0027ll publicize her tragic demise. Bracket her career. Package it.\" \"I knew you would make good on the promise,\" I said. \"And I would have seen to it, if you hadn\u0027t-that is, if you had given me leave. Now it\u0027s over, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Her voice was marvelous,\" Quinn said. \"If only I could have murdered her and not her voice.\" \"Quinn!\" said Mona. \"Well, I think that\u0027s what you\u0027ve done, Little Brother,\" I remarked. He laughed softly. \"I suppose you\u0027re right, Beloved Boss,\" he said. He smiled at Mona and her innocent shock. \"Some night I\u0027ll tell you all about her. When I was little, I thought she was made of plastic and glue. She was always screaming. Enough about her.\" Mona shook her head. She loved him much too much to press. Besides, she had other things on her mind. \"But Lestat, what did you see out there?\" she asked me. \"You are not listening to me,\" I said with exasperation. \"I told you, you maddening little miscreant, I won\u0027t relive it. It\u0027s closed for me. Besides, give me one good reason why I should even speak to you. Why are we in the same room?\" \"Lestat,\" said Quinn, \"please give Mona another chance.\" I got furious-not at Mona, I wasn\u0027t going to fall into that trap again-but simply furious. They were such beautiful children, these two. And-. \"Very well,\" I said, thinking as I spoke. \"I\u0027m going to lay down the law to you. If I am to remain with you, I am the Master here. And I refuse to prove myself to you. I won\u0027t spend my tenure with you being constantly questioned as to the virtue of my authority!\" \"I understand,\" said Mona. \"I really, really do!\" So seemingly heartfelt. \"Case in point,\" I said. \"Whatever I saw out there, I choose to forget. And you have to forget it too.\" \"Yes, Beloved Boss,\" said Mona eagerly. Pause. I wasn\u0027t buying it. Quinn was not looking at her. He was looking attentively at me. \"You know how much I love you,\" he said. \"I love you too, Little Brother,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry that my disagreements with Mona have put a distance between us.\" He turned to Mona. \"Say what you have to say,\" he told her. Mona looked down. Her hands were folded one on top of the other in her lap and she looked abruptly forlorn and full of warmth, her coloring all the more intense on account of the black dress, her hair quite incidentally magnificent. (Big deal! So what!) \"I showered you with abuse,\" she confessed. Her voice was smoother and richer than it had been before now: \"I was so very wrong.\" She looked up at me. I had never seen her green eyes so placid. \"I was wrong to speak of your other fledglings the way I did, to speak of your long-ago tragedies with such coarseness and attempted cruelty. I should have never spoken to anyone with such callousness, let alone to you. It was spiritually and morally crude. And it was not my nature. Please trust me when I say that. It was not my nature. It was downright hateful.\" I shrugged, but I was secretly impressed. Good command of the English language. \"So why did you do it?\" I asked, feigning detachment. She appeared to be thinking about it, during which time Quinn looked at her with obvious concern. Then she said: \"You\u0027re in love with Rowan. I saw it. It frightened me, really, really frightened me.\" Silence. Inexpressible pain. No image of Rowan in my heart. Simply an emptiness, an acknowledgement that she was far, far away. Maybe forever.\"Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken.\" \"Frightened?\" I asked. \"How so?\" \"I wanted you to love me,\" Mona said. \"I wanted you to remain interested in me. I wanted you to be on my side. I . . . I didn\u0027t want you to be swept away by her.\" She faltered. \"I was jealous. I was like a prisoner let out of a solitary confinement cell after two years, and having found riches all around me, I feared losing everything.\" Again I was secretly impressed. \"Nothing was at risk,\" I responded. \"Absolutely nothing.\" \"But surely you understand,\" said Quinn, \"what it means for Mona to be deluged with our gifts and unable to modulate her feelings. There we were in that very garden behind the First Street house, the very place where the Taltos bodies had been buried.\" \"Yes,\" Mona said. \"We were talking of things which had tortured me for years and I . . . I. . . .\" \"Mona, you must trust in me,\" I said. \"You must trust in my principles. That\u0027s our paradox. We do not leave behind the Natural Law when we receive the Blood. We are principled creatures. I never stopped loving you, not for an instant. Whatever I felt for Rowan at the family gathering in no way affected my feelings for you. How could it? I warned you twice to be patient with your family because I knew it was right for you to do so. Then the third time, all right, I went too far with a little mockery. But I was trying to curb your insults, and your abuse of those you loved! But you wouldn\u0027t listen to me.\" \"I will now, I swear it,\" she said. Again, the assured voice, a voice I\u0027d not heard last night or tonight earlier. \"Quinn\u0027s been instructing me for hours. He\u0027s been cautioning me about the way I treat Rowan and Michael and Dolly Jean. He\u0027s told me I can\u0027t just blithely call them \u0027human beings\u0027 right in front of them. It\u0027s ill-mannered for a vampire to do that.\" \"Indeed,\" I said witheringly. (You gotta be kidding.) \"He\u0027s explained that we have to be patient with their ways, and I see that now, and I understand why Rowan had to talk as she did. Or that it wasn\u0027t my place to interrupt her. I see it. I won\u0027t make those blundering remarks anymore. I have to find my . . . my maturity in the Blood.\" She paused and then: \"A place where serenity and courtesy connect. Yes, that\u0027s what it is. And I\u0027m far from it.\" \"True,\" I said. I studied her, the picture she made. I wasn\u0027t quite convinced by this perfect Act of Contrition. And how lovely her little wrists looked in the tight black cuffs, and of course the shoes, with their wicked heels and winding snakelike straps. But I liked her words: \"A place where serenity and courtesy connect.\" I liked them a lot, and I knew they\u0027d come from her. All she had said had come from her, no matter what Quinn had taught her. I could tell by the way that Quinn responded to her. \"And about the sequined dress,\" she said, startling me out of that line of thought. \"I understand now.\" \"You do?\" I asked soberly. \"Of course,\" she said with a shrug. \"All males are obviously much more stimulated by what they see than females. And why should we people of the night be an exception?\" Flash of big green eyes. Rosy mouth. \"You didn\u0027t want to be distracted anymore by all that skin and cleavage, and you were very honest about it.\" \"I should have made my wishes known with more tact and respect,\" I said in a dull monotone. \"I will be gentlemanly in the future.\" \"No, no,\" she said with an honest shake of her red hair. \"We all knew the dress was highfalutin trash, it was supposed to be. That\u0027s why I wore it to the hotel terrace. It was deliberately seductive. That\u0027s why when I walked into this house, I went right to change into something more presentable. Besides, you are the Maker. That\u0027s the word that Quinn used. The Maker, or the Master. The Teacher. And you have the authority to say to me, \u0027Take off that dress,\u0027 and I knew what you were talking about. \"But you see-I\u0027ve been sick for a very crucial part of my life. I never knew as a mortal girl what it was like to wear a dress like that. I was never a mortal woman, you see.\" A great sadness descended on me. \"I just went from being a kid to being an invalid,\" she said. \"And then this, this range of powers which you\u0027ve entrusted to me. And what have I done but strike out at you because I thought you . . . thought you loved Rowan.\" She stopped, puzzled, looking off. \"I suppose I wanted to reveal to you . . . that I was a woman, too, in that dress. . . .\" she said dreamily. \"Maybe that was it. That I was a woman as much as she was.\" It struck me in the soul, her words. The soul I wasn\u0027t supposed to have, the entangled soul. \"Ironic, isn\u0027t it?\" she said, her voice roughened by emotion, \"what womanhood means. The power to mother, the power to seduce, the power to leave behind both, the power to. . . .\" She shut her eyes. She whispered: \"And that dress, such an outrageous badge of it!\" \"Don\u0027t battle with it anymore,\" I said. It was the first warmth I\u0027d shown to her. \"You said it the first time around, really. You said it.\" She knew it. She looked up at me. \"Power Slut,\" she whispered. \"That\u0027s what you called me, and right you were, I was drunk on the power, I was spinning, I was-.\" \"Oh, no, don\u0027t-.\" \"And we can transcend, we are so blessed, even if it is a dark blessing, we are miracles, we are free in so many marvelous respects-.\" \"It\u0027s my task,\" I said, \"to guide you, instruct you, remain with you until you\u0027re able to exist well on your own, and not to lose my temper as I did. I was in the wrong. I played out the power hand same as you did, baby. I should have had much more patience.\" Quiet. And this sorrow too will lift. It must. \"You do love Rowan, though, don\u0027t you?\" she asked. \"You really really love her.\" \"Accept what I\u0027m saying to you,\" I said. \"I am a very mean guy. And I am being nice.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re not mean at all,\" she said with a little laugh. She cleared her saddened face with the brightest smile. \"I absolutely adore you.\" \"No, I am mean,\" I said. \"And I expect to be adored. Remember your own words. I\u0027m the teacher.\" \"But why do you love Rowan?\" \"Mona, let\u0027s not delve into that too much,\" said Quinn. \"I think we\u0027ve accomplished a great reconciliation here, and Lestat won\u0027t leave us now.\" \"I was never going to leave,\" I said under my breath. \"I would never abandon either of you. But now that we\u0027re gathered together, I think we can move on. There are other matters on my mind.\" Quiet. \"Yes, we should move on,\" said Mona. \"What other matters?\" Quinn asked a little fearfully. \"Last night we talked about a certain quest,\" I said. \"I made a promise. And I mean to keep it. But I want to clarify certain things . . . about the quest and what we hope to gain from it.\" \"Yes,\" said Quinn. \"I\u0027m not sure I fully understand everything about the Taltos.\" \"There\u0027s too much for us to understand,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sure Mona would agree with that.\" I saw the trouble come back into her bright face, the pucker of her eyebrows, the soft lengthening of her mouth. But even in this I saw a new maturity, a new self-confidence. \"I have some questions. . . .\" I said. \"Yes,\" said Mona. \"I\u0027ll try to answer them.\" I reflected, then plunged: \"Are you absolutely certain that you do want to find these creatures?\" \"Oh, I have to find Morrigan, you know that! Lestat, how could you, you said you-?\" \"Let me phrase it differently,\" I said, raising my hand. \"Never mind whatever you\u0027ve said in the past. Now that you\u0027ve had time to think-to become more accustomed to what you are, now that you know that Rowan and Michael weren\u0027t lying to you, that you do know everything, and that there\u0027s nothing to know- do you want to search out Morrigan simply to know that she\u0027s safe and sound, or to reveal yourself to her in a true reunion?\" \"Yes, that is the essential question,\" said Quinn. \"Which is it?\" \"Well, for a true reunion obviously,\" she answered without hesitation. \"I never thought of any other possibility.\" She was bewildered. \"I . . . I never considered just finding out if she was all right. I . . . always thought we\u0027d be together. I want so much to put my arms around her, to hold her, to-.\" Her face went blank with hurt. She fell silent. \"You do see,\" I asked as tactfully as I could, \"if she wanted that, she would have come back to you a long time ago.\" Surely such thoughts had occurred to her before. They must have. But as I watched her now I wondered. Maybe she had dwelt on fantasies and lies-that Rowan knew the whereabouts of Morrigan and kept it secret. That Rowan had smuggled her the magic milk and it did no good. Whatever the case, she was shaken now. Badly shaken. \"Maybe she couldn\u0027t come to me,\" she whispered. \"Maybe Ash Templeton wouldn\u0027t let her.\" She shook her head and put her hands to her forehead. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of creature he is! Of course Michael and Rowan thought Ash was a . . . hero, a great all-knowing, wise observer of the centuries. But what if-. I don\u0027t know. I want to see her. I want to talk to her. I want to hear it from her, what she wants, don\u0027t you see? Why she didn\u0027t come to me all those years, why she didn\u0027t even . . . Lasher, he was cruel, but he was an aberrant soul, a. . . .\" She covered her mouth with her right hand, her fingers trembling. Quinn was beside himself. He couldn\u0027t bear to see her so unhappy. \"Mona, you can\u0027t give her the Blood,\" I said softly, \"no matter what her circumstances. The Blood cannot be passed to this species of creature. It is too unknown for us even to consider such a thing. The Blood very likely can\u0027t be passed on to them. But even if it could, we can\u0027t make a new species of Immortal. Believe me when I say there are ancient ones of our kind who would never tolerate such a thing happening.\" \"Oh, I know that, I haven\u0027t asked for that, I wouldn\u0027t-.\" She went quiet, obviously unable to speak. \"You want to know she\u0027s alive and well,\" said Quinn in the gentlest manner. \"That\u0027s paramount, wouldn\u0027t you say?\" Mona nodded, looking away. \"Yes-that there\u0027s a community of them somewhere, and they\u0027re happy.\" She frowned. She battled her pain. She drew in her breath, cheeks reddening. \"It isn\u0027t likely, is it?\" She looked at me. \"No, it\u0027s not,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what Rowan and Michael were trying to tell us.\" \"Then I have to know what happened to them!\" she whispered bitterly. \"I have to!\" \"I\u0027ll find out,\" I said. \"You really mean that?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I wouldn\u0027t make a promise to you like that unless I meant it. I\u0027ll find out, and if they have survived, if they do have a community somewhere, then you can decide whether or not you want to meet with them. But once a meeting occurs, they\u0027ll know about you, what you are, everything. That is, if they have the powers that Rowan ascribed to them.\" \"Oh, they have those powers,\" Mona said. \"They do.\" She closed her eyes. She took a deep painful breath. \"It\u0027s an awful thing to admit,\" she said, \"but the things Dolly Jean said were all true. I can\u0027t deny them. I can\u0027t withhold the truth from you and Quinn. I can\u0027t. Morrigan was . . . almost unbearable.\" \"How so, unbearable?\" asked Quinn. I could see this was a radical admission. She had said things quite to the contrary. Mona threw back her hair, her eyes searching the ceiling. She was facing something she had always denied. \"Obsessive, incessant, maddening!\" she said. \"She went on and on about her schemes and plans and dreams and memories, and she did say that Mayfairs would become a family of Taltos, and once she caught the scent of the Taltos male on Rowan and Michael, she was absolutely unendurable.\" Mona closed her eyes. \"The thought of a community of such creatures is-almost beyond my imagination. This old one, Ash Templeton, the one that Rowan and Michael knew-he had learned to pretend to be a human being, he had learned that centuries ago. That\u0027s the thing. These creatures can live indefinitely! They are immortals! The species is utterly incompatible with humans. Morrigan was new and raw.\" She looked imploringly at me. \"Take it slowly,\" I said. I had never seen her suffering so. In all her bouts of tears there had been a generosity and selflessness that made them seem quite challengeable. As for her rage, she\u0027d positively enjoyed it. But now she was truly in torment. \"It\u0027s like me, don\u0027t you see?\" she said. \"She was a newborn Taltos. And I\u0027m a newborn Blood Child, or whatever you want to call me. And we share the same faults. She was unruly and crashing into everything around her! And that\u0027s the way I\u0027ve behaved, raving to you as I did about your written confessions, I . . . she . . . presuming, assuming, even rushing to the computer just the way she did, recording my responses the way she did, and going on and on the way she did, but she, she never stopped, she . . . I . . . she . . . I don\u0027t know. . . .\" Her tears came and she couldn\u0027t talk anymore. \"Oh, dear God in Heaven, what is the squalid secret behind all this?\" she whispered. \"What is it? What is it?\" Quinn\u0027s face was torn. \"I know the secret,\" I said. \"Mona, you hated her as much as you loved her. How could you not? Accept it. And now you have to know what happened to her.\" She nodded, vigorously, but she couldn\u0027t speak. She couldn\u0027t look at me. \"And we have to go about this with great care,\" I said, \"this search for the Taltos, but I vow to you again that we will do it. And I will find them or find out what became of them.\" Quiet. She finally looked at me. A sorrowful motionlessness settled over her. She wasn\u0027t trying to stare me down. I don\u0027t think she even realized I was looking back at her. She looked at me for the longest time and her face grew soft and giving and tender. \"I\u0027ll never be mean to you again,\" she said. \"I believe you,\" I said. \"I took you to my heart the first moment I saw you.\" Quinn sat staring with patient eyes, the round mirror behind him like a great halo. \"You really do love me,\" she said. \"Yes,\" I said. \"What can I do to prove that I love you?\" she asked. I thought for a long moment, sealed off from her and from Quinn. \"You don\u0027t have to do anything,\" I said. \"But there is one small favor I might ask.\" \"Anything,\" she answered. \"Never mention my love for Rowan again,\" I said. She locked on me, eyes so full of anguish that I could hardly bear it. \"Only one more time, to say this,\" she said. \"Rowan walks with God. And Mayfair Medical is her sacred mountain.\" \"Yes,\" I said with a sigh. \"You are so very right. And don\u0027t ever think that I don\u0027t know it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-23.html","bookId":2596,"book":{"id":2596,"title":"Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10)","description":"Storyline: Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10) Lestat is back with a vengeance and in thrall to Rowan Mayfair.
