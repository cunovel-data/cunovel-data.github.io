{"id":97050,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"6 WE WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE and on the road within three minutes, maybe less, moving on mortal time so as not to alarm any further the full chorus of those shouting at us. Mona had sense enough to pull up the shivering feathers of the wrapper over her face so that nothing could be seen of her but heaps of red hair and dangling bejeweled feet, and we made our exit with polished polite assurances to the clamoring herd, directing the profoundly indifferent Clem to head for New Orleans \"immediately.\" It was I who gave the command with a quick smile that elicited the driver\u0027s sarcastic expression and shrug, but the mammoth limousine was soon rocking down the gravel drive, and Mona was between me and Quinn in the back seat, and then and only then did I begin to scan the city of New Orleans for possible victims. \"I can hear the voices like the din from Hell,\" I said. \"Toughen up, baby. I\u0027m looking for the eternal scum. Call them grim soulless mortals feeding off the downtrodden or the downtrodden feeding off each other. I always wonder-and never learn-whether or not the genuine Power Thugs ever stop to look at the violet evening sky or the overhead branches of an oak. Crack peddlers, child killers, teenaged gangsters for a fatal fifteen minutes, the morgue\u0027s never empty in our town, it\u0027s an eternal brew of calculated malice mixed with moral ignorance.\" Mona dreamed, staring out the windows, caught up in every shift of the landscape. Quinn could hear the distant voices. Quinn could tune in from afar. Quinn was anxious, so in love with her, but far from happy. The car gained speed as it took to the highway. Mona gasped. She slipped her fingers around my left arm. You can never tell just what a fledgling will do. It\u0027s all so intoxicating. \"Listen,\" I said. \"Quinn and I are listening.\" \"I hear them,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t take one thread from the knots, I can\u0027t. But look at the trees. There\u0027s no tint on these windows. Mayfairs always tint their limousine windows.\" \"That was not Aunt Queen\u0027s way,\" said Quinn, staring forward, washed in the voices. \"She wanted the clear glass so she could see out. She didn\u0027t care if people looked in.\" \"I keep waiting for it all to settle,\" Mona whispered. \"It never will,\" said Quinn. \"It only gets better and better.\" \"Then trust me,\" she said to him, her fingers tightening on my arm. \"Don\u0027t be so afraid for me. I have requests.\" \"Hit me with them, go on,\" I said. \"I want to go past my house-I mean the Mayfair house on First and Chestnut. I\u0027ve been in the hospital for two years. I haven\u0027t seen it.\" \"No,\" I said. \"Rowan will sense your presence. She won\u0027t know what you are any more than she knew at Blackwood Manor. But she\u0027ll know you\u0027re close. We\u0027re not going there. There\u0027ll come a time, but this isn\u0027t it. Go back to the thirst.\" She nodded. She didn\u0027t fight me. I realized she hadn\u0027t fought me on anything. But I knew she had heavy thoughts, more than usual links in the chain that bound fledglings to their living past. Something was catching hold of her, something to do with the warped images she\u0027d shown me in the Blood-the Monstrous Offspring, the Woman Child. What had that been, that creature? I didn\u0027t let Quinn pick this up from me. It was too soon to reveal all that. But he might well have caught it all in the room when I\u0027d brought her over. I\u0027d belonged to her during those moments, exclusively and dangerously. He might know all I\u0027d seen. And he might be reading it from her now, though I knew she wasn\u0027t ready to reveal it. The car was speeding across the lake. The lake looked like a huge dead thing rather than a body of living water. But the clouds rose in a triumphant mass beneath the emerging moon. When you\u0027re a vampire you can see the clouds that others can\u0027t see. You can live off things like that when faith is destroyed-the random shifting shapes of clouds, the seeming sentience of the moon. \"No, I need to go there,\" she said suddenly. \"I have to see the house. I have to.\" \"What is this, a damned mutiny?\" I answered. I was just congratulating you in my mind that you didn\u0027t fight me.\" \"What? Do I get a merit badge for that?\" she fired back. \"We don\u0027t have to go close to the house,\" she went on, sob in her throat. \"I just need to see those Garden District streets.\" \"Oh yeah, right,\" I said under my breath. \"You care that you\u0027ll draw them right out of the house, right out of their peace of mind? You ready to follow up on that in some way? Of course I\u0027m not saying you have to follow up. You understand, I\u0027m just trying to respond to you and Mr. Quinn Blackwood as exemplary decent little people. I myself? I\u0027m a scoundrel.\" \"Beloved Boss,\" she said with a straight face, \"let me just go as close as we can, as close as you can figure. No, I don\u0027t want to rile them up. I hate the idea. But I was in solitary confinement for two years.\" \"Where are we headed, Lestat?\" Quinn asked. \"Will we hunt downtown?\" \"Back of town is what I like to call it,\" I said. \"No Creole like me is going to call it downtown. You know where the scum grows on the bricks. Listen for the city, Mona.\" \"I hear it,\" she answered. \"It\u0027s like opening a floodgate. And then the discrete voices. Plenty of discrete voices. Bickering, threats, even the muffled snap of guns . . .\" \"The town\u0027s full tonight in spite of the heat,\" I said. \"People are out on the streets, thoughts flooding me in sickening waves. If I was a saint, this is what I would have to listen to all the time.\" \"Yeah, like prayers,\" she said. \"All those petitions.\" \"Saints have to work,\" I said, as if I really knew. And then with one fine blow it struck me. Their presence. It hit Quinn at the same instant, and he said, \"My God\" under his breath. He was astonished. \"Close in on them,\" I said. \"What is it?\" Mona asked. \"I can\u0027t hear it.\" Then she locked her eyes on Quinn. Oh, this was nothing short of providential! I was absolutely furious and deliriously happy at the same time. I closed my focus. Oh, yeah, right, killing at random as they fed, a pair of male and female vampires, constitutionally cruel, high-toned, style versus character, brilliant gold and brand-name leather, drunk on their powers, lapping up New Orleans as if it weren\u0027t real, baiting the \"great vampire Lestat,\" in whom they didn\u0027t really believe (who does?), prancing through my French Quarter streets to a lavish lair in a pricey hotel, key in the lock, blood full, laughter echoing to the ceiling, turn on the TV, done in for the night, innocent victims strewn in the back alleys, but not all of them, ready to groove on music or the color images of the mortal world, feeling totally superior, vague plan to sleep in the day in the filthy old whitewashed tombs of St. Louis No. 1 Cemetery, like, very bold! Unwittingly waiting to die. I sat back laughing under my breath. \"This is too rich! Too deliciously wicked! She\u0027s up for it. Don\u0027t give it another thought. It\u0027s the lightning narcotic of enemy blood. It\u0027s perfect for her. And the sooner she learns to fight her own kind the better. Same for you, Quinn. You\u0027ve never had to battle the cosmic trash that\u0027s out there.\" \"But this has to be perfect for her, Lestat,\" Quinn said. \"You know what happened on my first night. I blundered. I can\u0027t let something ugly and bad happen to her-.\" \"You\u0027re breaking my tender little heart,\" I said. \"Are you and she going in alone? I am going with you. You honestly think I can\u0027t handle this pair of mavericks? I\u0027ve made myself too domestic for you, Quinn. You forget who I am and maybe I do too.\" \"But how will it end?\" he persisted. \"Your innocence is so genuine,\" I responded. \"You should know that by now!\" he said. And then at once, \"I\u0027m sorry. Forgive me. It\u0027s only-.\" \"Listen to me, both of you,\" I said. \"We\u0027re talking the misbegotten of Hell. They\u0027ve been swaggering through eternity for a decade at most, just long enough to make them very cocky. I\u0027ll get the lowdown on their souls before I dispatch them, of course. But as of now I know they\u0027re outlaws. And I don\u0027t like them. And vampire blood is always hot. And the fighting will be good. They\u0027re greedy filth. They break the peace on my streets. That\u0027s a death sentence, at least when I have the time for it. And right now I have the time, and you have the thirst, and that\u0027s what interests me. No more questions.\" A little laugh came from Mona. \"And I wonder how their blood tastes,\" she said, \"but I wouldn\u0027t dare ask you. Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m up for it if you say so.\" \"You\u0027re a mocking little thing,\" I replied. \"Do you like to fight? Fighting with mortals is no fun because it\u0027s no fair. No honor-bound immortal would do it any more than necessary. But fighting with these revenants is going to be great. And you can never tell how strong they\u0027re going to be, absolutely never. Then there are the images that come through their blood-sizzling, more electric than those from the human prey.\" Squeeze of her hand. Quinn was distressed. He thought of the night he first hunted: a wedding in Naples, and the bride had pulled him into a bedroom, intent on a caper to cut her new spouse, and he\u0027d drunk her dry, spilling the first draught all over her dress. Over and over he relived that fall from grace, that awful moment of the full curse. \"Little Brother,\" I said. \"Those were human beings. Look at me.\" He turned towards me, and in the flashing lights of the freeway I peered into his eyes. \"I know I\u0027ve played it elegant with you up till now,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve played the sage European and now you\u0027re seeing the rough side of me. And I have to remember you\u0027ve been through Hell just telling me your story, and what with the death of Aunt Queen, it\u0027s been pure torture for you, and you richly deserve any good thing that I can conjure or give. But I have to rid the world of these two Blood Hunters. And you and Mona mustn\u0027t miss this opportunity.\" \"What if they\u0027re strong, what if they were made like me by someone very old?\" he asked. I sighed. \"I\u0027ve given you my blood, Quinn. And Mona\u0027s been made with it. My blood, Quinn. They\u0027re no match for you now. They\u0027re no match for her, I told you.\" \"I wanna do it!\" Mona interjected immediately. \"If you say they\u0027re fair game, then they\u0027re fair game, and that\u0027s good enough for me, Beloved Boss. I can\u0027t tell my own heart and soul what I\u0027m feeling now, how much I crave this little battle. I can\u0027t find the words, it\u0027s so raw, so rooted inside me! It goes way back into the human part of me that\u0027s not going to die, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Precisely.\" \"Bravo,\" she said. \"I\u0027m picking them up. But, something\u0027s, something\u0027s confusing me . . .\" \"Save it, we\u0027re almost there,\" I said. A soft subdued expression came over Quinn, unmistakable in the light of the cars that flew by. \"What if they beg for mercy?\" he asked. \"You can count on that happening,\" I said with a little shrug. \"What if they know poetry?\" he asked. \"It would have to be very fine,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t you think? To make up for all those innocent victims?\" He wouldn\u0027t let up. He couldn\u0027t. \"What if they love you?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-6.html","bookId":2596,"book":{"id":2596,"title":"Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10)","description":"Storyline: Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10) Lestat is back with a vengeance and in thrall to Rowan Mayfair.
