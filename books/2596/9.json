She fell in love with the colors made by spilt gasoline in mud puddles, with exotic furniture in the store windows of Hurwitz Mintz, with antique shop displays of threadbare gilded chairs and lacquered square grand pianos and idling trucks belching white smoke from their upturned exhaust pipes and laughing mortals passing us on the narrow sidewalks carrying adorable babies, who twisted their little necks to peer at us-\n -and an old black man playing a tenor saxophone for money, which we gave him in abundance, and a hat- wearing hot dog vender from which Mona could not buy a hot dog now save to stare at it and sniff it and heave it into a trash bin, which gave her staggering pause-\n -and of course we attracted attention everywhere, in very unvampirelike fashion, Quinn being taller than anyone we passed and perhaps four times as handsome, with his porcelain face, and all the rest you know, and every now and then Mona with hair flying broke from us and ran ahead frantically, the lazy evening crowds opening and closing for her as though she were on a Heavenly errand, thank God, and then she\u0027d circle back-\n -dancing and clicking and stomping like a flamenco dancer, letting the feather wrapper fly out, trail, sag, and then gathering it in again, and crying to see her reflection in shop glass, and darting down side streets until we grabbed ahold of her and claimed custody of her and wouldn\u0027t let her go.\n When we got to my town house I gave two hundred dollars to my two mortal guards who were happily\n astonished, and as Quinn and I started back the open carriageway, Mona gave us the slip.\n We didn\u0027t realize it until we\u0027d reached the courtyard garden, and just when I was about to exclaim about the ancient cherub fountain and all the tropical wonders blooming against my much cherished brick walls, I sensed that she was totally gone.\n Now, that is no easy feat. I may not be able to read the child\u0027s mind, but I have the senses of a god, do I not?\n \"We have to find her!\" Quinn said. He was instantly thrown into protective overdrive.\n \"Nonsense,\" I said. \"She knows where we are. She wants to be alone. Let her. Come on. Let\u0027s go upstairs. I\u0027m exhausted. I should have fed. And now I don\u0027t have the spirit for it, which is a Hell of a situation. I have to rest.\"\n \"You\u0027re serious?\" he asked as he followed me up the iron stairway. \"What if she gets into some sort of jam?\"\n \"She won\u0027t. She knows what she\u0027s doing. I told you. I have to crash. This is no selfish secret, Little Brother. I worked the Dark Trick tonight, and forgot to feed. I\u0027m tired.\"\n \"You really believe she\u0027s all right?\" he demanded. \"I didn\u0027t realize you were tired. I should have realized. I\u0027ll go and look for her.\"\n \"No, you won\u0027t. Come on with me.\"\n The flat was empty. No otherworldly bodies hovering about. No ghosts, either.\n The back parlor had been cleaned and dusted earlier this very day and I could smell the cleaning lady\u0027s distant perfume. I could smell her lingering blood scent too. Of course I had never laid eyes on the woman. She came by the light of the sun, but she did her job well enough for me to leave her big bills. I loved giving away money. I carried it for no other purpose. I slapped a hundred on the desk for her. We have desks everywhere in this flat, I thought. Too many desks. Didn\u0027t every bedroom have a little desk? Why so many?\n Quinn had only been here once and only under the most lamentable circumstances, and he was suddenly enthralled by the Impressionist paintings, which were quite divine. But it was the new and slightly somber Gauguin which caught my eye for a moment. Now, that was my purchase and had only been delivered in the last few days. Quinn hooked into that one too.\n I made my usual beeline for the front parlor over the street, peeking into each and every bedroom on the way, as though I really needed to, in order to know that no one was home. The place had too much\n furniture. Not enough paintings. Too many books. What the hallway needed was Emile Nolde. How could I get my hands on the German Expressionists?\n \"I think I should go after her,\" Quinn said. He followed me, taking in everything reverently, mind on Mona, no doubt monitoring her every move.\n Front parlor. Piano. There was no piano now. I should tell them to get a piano. Hadn\u0027t we passed an antique piano in a window? I had a sudden urge to play the piano-to use my vampiric gift to rip at the keys. It was that Bart¨®k concerto still assaulting my mind, and the picture of those two macabre dancers accentuating the music.\n Oh, give me all things human.\n \"I think I should go get her,\" Quinn said.\n \"Listen, I\u0027m not one to talk much about gender,\" I said, flopping down in my favorite of the velvet wing chairs and throwing one foot up on the chair before the desk, \"but you have to realize that she\u0027s experiencing a freedom you and I don\u0027t appreciate as men. She\u0027s walking in the darkness and she\u0027s afraid of nothing, and she loves it. And just maybe, just maybe she wants to taste a little mortal blood and she\u0027s willing to take the risk.\"\n \"She\u0027s a magnet,\" he whispered. He stood at the window, his hand pulling gently at the lace. \"She doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m tracking her. She isn\u0027t that far away. She\u0027s taking her time. I hear her idle thoughts. She\u0027s walking too fast. Somebody\u0027s going to notice-.\"\n \"Why are you suffering, Little Brother?\" I asked. \"Do you hate me for bringing her over? Do you wish it hadn\u0027t been done?\"\n He turned and looked at me as though I\u0027d grabbed him by the arm.\n \"No,\" he said. He walked away from the window and sort of tumbled into the chair in the far corner opposite me, diagonally, his long legs sprawling as though he wasn\u0027t sure what to do with them. \"I would have tried it if you hadn\u0027t come,\" he admitted. \"I couldn\u0027t have watched her die. At least I don\u0027t think so. But I am suffering, you\u0027re right. Lestat, you can\u0027t leave us. Lestat, why are those guards outside the house?\"\n \"Did I say I would leave you?\" I countered. \"I hired those guards after Stirling came here,\" I said. \"Oh, it\u0027s not that I think any of the Talamasca will come back here. It\u0027s just that if Stirling could walk right in here, then somebody else might.\"\n (Flash on the Talamasca: Order of Psychic Detectives. Don\u0027t know their own Origins. At least a thousand years old, maybe much older. Keep records on all sorts of paranormal phenomena. Reach out to the\n telepathically gifted and isolated. Know about us.)\n Quinn and I had visited with Stirling at the Oak Haven Retreat House of the Talamasca right after the exorcism of Goblin, and the immolation of Merrick Mayfair. Merrick Mayfair had grown up in the Talamasca. Stirling had a right to know she was no longer one of the (sigh) Undead. The Retreat House was an immense square plantation house on the River Road just outside of town.\n Stirling Oliver had not only been a friend of Quinn\u0027s during his mortal years, but he was a friend of Mona\u0027s as well. The Talamasca knew much more about the entire Mayfair family than they knew about me.\n It gave me no pleasure to think of Stirling now, much as I admired him and liked him. Stirling was about sixty-five years old and very dedicated to the highest principles of the Order, which for all its avowed secularity might have been Roman Catholic with its strictures against meddling in the affairs of the world or using supernatural persons or forces for one\u0027s own ends. If the Order hadn\u0027t been so fabulously and mysteriously and undeniably wealthy, I would probably have been a patron of it.\n (I am also fabulously and mysteriously and undeniably wealthy, but who cares?)\n I felt compelled to go see Stirling at the Retreat House and tell him what had happened with Mona. But why?\n Stirling wasn\u0027t Pope Gregory the Great, for the love of Heaven, and I wasn\u0027t Saint Lestat. I didn\u0027t have to go to Confession for what I\u0027d done to Mona, but a terrible Contrition settled over me, a profound awareness that all my powers were dark powers and all my talents evil talents, and nothing could come from me but evil no matter what I did.\n Besides, hadn\u0027t Stirling told Quinn last night that Mona was dying? What had been the meaning of that information? Wasn\u0027t he in some way in collusion with what had happened? No. He wasn\u0027t. Quinn hadn\u0027t left him last night to seek out Mona. Mona had come to Blackwood Manor on her own.\n \"Sooner or later, I\u0027ll explain all this to Stirling,\" I said under my breath. \"It\u0027s as though Stirling will absolve me but that just isn\u0027t true.\" I looked at Quinn. \"Can you still hear her?\"\n He nodded. \"She\u0027s just walking, looking at things,\" he said. He was distracted, the pupils in his eyes dancing slowly. \"Why tell Stirling?\" he asked. \"Stirling can\u0027t tell the Mayfairs. Why burden him with the secret?\" He sat forward. \"She\u0027s wandering along Jackson Square. A man\u0027s following her. She\u0027s leading him. He senses something isn\u0027t right with her. And she\u0027s on to him. She knows what he wants. She\u0027s luring him. She\u0027s certainly having a great time in Aunt Queen\u0027s high-heel shoes.\"\n \"Stop watching her,\" I said. \"I mean it. Let me tell you something about your little girl. She\u0027s going to make herself known to the Mayfairs very soon on her own. Nothing\u0027s going to stop her. There are things\n she wants to know from the Mayfairs. I had a sense of it when-.\"\n The room was empty. No Quinn. I was talking to all the furniture.\n I heard the back door open and close, it was that fast.\n I stretched out and scrunched down and put my head back and drifted, eyes shut at once.\n I was half dreaming. Why the Hell hadn\u0027t I fed? Of course I didn\u0027t need to feed every night or even every month, but when you work the Dark Trick, no matter who you are, you must feed afterwards, you\u0027re giving from the very sap stream of your life. All is vanity. All is vanity under the sun and under the moon.\n I\u0027d been in a weakened state when I\u0027d gone down to deal with Rowan Mayfair, that was my problem, that was why the creature obsessed me. Never mind.\n Someone pushed my foot off the desk chair. I heard a woman\u0027s piercing laugh; I heard dozens of people laughing. Heavy cigar smoke. Glass breaking. I opened my eyes. The flat was full of people! Both windows to the front balcony were open and it was jammed with people, women in long low-cut sparkling dresses, men in fine black dinner jackets with flashing black satin lapels, the roar of conversation and merriment almost deafening, but deafening to whom, and a tray went by, held high by a waiter in a white coat who all but tripped over my legs, and there sat a child on the desk, a rosy child, staring at me, a dainty girl with quick black eyes and beautifully waved black hair, seven or eight, enchanting, precious.\n \"Ducky, I\u0027m sorry!\" she said, \"but you\u0027re in our world now, I do hate to say it. We have you!\" She was mocking up a British accent. She had on a little sailor dress, white with blue trim, and high white socks and little black Mary Janes. She drew up her knees. \"Lestat,\" she laughed. She pointed at me.\n Then, down into the desk chair facing me, slipped Oncle Julien, dressed for the party, white tie, white cuffs, white hair. The crowd pressed in on him. Someone was shouting from the balcony.\n \"She\u0027s right, Lestat,\" Oncle Julien said in flawless French, \"we have you in our world now, and I must say you have a divine apartment here, and I so admire the paintings which have only just come from Paris, you and your friends are so very clever, and the furniture, there is so much of it, yes, it seems you\u0027ve crammed every nook and cranny, yet who could have asked for anything finer?\"\n \"But I thought we were mad at him, Oncle Julien,\" said the little girl in English.\n \"We are, Stella,\" he said in French, \"but this is Lestat\u0027s house, and whether we are angry or not we are Mayfairs first and foremost, and Mayfairs are always polite.\"\n This sent little Stella into a regular riot of laughter, and she gathered up her little self-soft cheeks, sailor suit, socks, shiny shoes-and leapt from the desk right into my lap, plop.\n \"I\u0027m so glad,\" she said, \"because you are so absolutely dandy; don\u0027t you think, Oncle Julien, he\u0027s too beautiful to be a man, oh, I know, Lestat, you\u0027re not one to talk about gender-.\"\n \"Stop it!\" I roared. A flashing, cleansing power went out of me, flushing against the walls.\n Dead quiet.\n Mona stood there, eyes wide, wrapper gone, sleek silk, Quinn right beside her, towering over her, face full of concern.\n \"Lestat, what is it?\" asked Mona.\n I got up, I staggered into the hallway. Why was I walking like this? I glanced back at the room. All the furniture had been moved-just a little. Things were askew! The doors were open to the balcony!\n \"Look at the smoke,\" I whispered.\n \"Cigar smoke,\" said Quinn questioningly.\n \"What is it, Boss?\" asked Mona again. She came up to me and put her arms around me and kissed me on the cheek. I kissed her forehead, smoothed back her hair.\n I didn\u0027t answer her.\n I didn\u0027t tell them. Why didn\u0027t I tell them?\n I showed them the bedroom with the sealed-up window that was painted to look like a window. I showed them the steel plating on the door and the lock. I told them about the human guards twenty-four hours. They were to pull the curtains around the bed, and sleep in each other\u0027s arms. No ray of the sun, no immortal, no mortal intruder, no one would bother them here. Of course they had a long time before sunrise. Talk, talk, yes. They could wander. But no spying on the Mayfairs, no. No probing for secrets, no. No searching for a lost daughter yet, no. No going home to Blackwood Manor, no. I told them I would meet them tomorrow at dusk.\n Now I had to leave, had to.\n Had to get out of here. Had to get out of there. Had to get out of everywhere.\n The open country.\n Near the Talamasca Retreat House.\n Distant rumble of trucks on the River Road. Smell of the River. Smell of the Grass. Walking. Grass wet.\n Field of scattered oaks. White clapboard house tumbling to ruin, the way they do in Louisiana, swaying walls and caving roof embraced and held suspended by the vines.\n Walking.\n I spun around.\n He was there. Technicolor ghost, black tailcoat, walking as I had been, through the grass, tossing aside the champagne glass, coming on. Stopped. I lunged at him, grabbed him before he could vanish, had him by the throat, fingers dug into what sought to be invisible, holding him, hurting what would be immaterial. Yeah, got you! You impudent phantom, look at me!\n \"You think you can haunt me!\" I growled. \"You think you can do that to me!\"\n \"I know I can!\" he said in caustic English. \"You took her, my child, my Mona!\" He struggled to dissolve. \"You knew I was waiting for her. You could have let her come to me.\"\n \"And just what crazy half-illuminated Afterlife are you from!\" I demanded. \"What are your half-baked mystical promises! Yeah, come on, what Other Side are you hawking, yeah, spill it, let\u0027s hear about Julien\u0027s Summerland, yeah, testify, how many ectoplasmic angels are on your side, give me the splendiferous images of your famous fabulous friggin\u0027 self-created self-sustained astral plane! Where the Hell were you going to take her! You\u0027re going to tell me some Lord of the Universe sends spooks like you to take little girls to Heaven!\"\n I was clutching nothing.\n I was all alone.\n It was sweetly warm and there was a numbing quiet in the vibration of the distant trucks, a winking beauty in the passing headlights.\n Who missed the deep silence of so many past centuries? Who missed the deep darkness of the long ago pre-electric nights? Not me.\n When I reached the Talamasca Retreat House, Stirling was standing on the terrace. Loose gray hair\n mussed, cotton pajamas, sashed robe, bare feet. A mortal couldn\u0027t have discovered him, standing in the shadows, waiting. An empathetic face, patient celibate alertness.\n \"I brought her over,\" I said.\n \"I know,\" he answered.\n \"I kissed Rowan Mayfair.\"\n \"You did what?\" he answered.\n \"They\u0027re after me, the Mayfair ghosts.\"\n He didn\u0027t respond, except for a small scowl and an undisguised look of wonder.\n I scanned the Retreat House. Empty. Maid out in the back cottages. One postulant out there writing in a notebook by a gooseneck lamp. Saw her in her self-conception. Hungered for her. Had no intention of feeding on her. Ridiculous idea. Absolutely verboten.\n \"Give me a bedroom, please,\" I asked. \"Just a room in which heavy draperies can be drawn.\"\n \"Of course,\" he said.\n \"Ah, the Talamasca, ready again to count upon my honor.\"\n \"I can depend upon it, can I not?\"\n I followed him into the front hallway and then up the broad staircase. How curious it was, to be his guest, to be walking on this wool carpet as if I were a mortal. Sleeping under the roof that wasn\u0027t mine. Next I\u0027d be doing it at Blackwood Farm. This could get out of hand. Please let it get out of hand.\n And here the fragrant and cozy bedroom with all its inevitable details. Pineapples carved into the four posts of the bed, canopy of hand-worked lace through which you could peer at the faint water stains on the ceiling, loving, caring, patchwork quilt of loops and circles and careening colors, parchment lamp shades, dark clots breaking through the old mirrors, needlepoint tiptoe chairs.\n \"What Mayfair ghosts are after you?\" he asked softly. It was respectful, his manner. \"What have you seen?\" And when I didn\u0027t answer, \"What have they done?\"\n \"Mona gave birth long ago to a daughter,\" I whispered. Yes, he knew all about it, didn\u0027t he? \"But you can\u0027t tell me, can you, what you know?\"\n \"No, I can\u0027t,\" he replied.\n \"She wants to find that child,\" I said.\n \"Does she,\" he said politely. He was afraid.\n \"Sleep well,\" I said and turned to the bed.\n He left me. But he knew the child\u0027s name. That much I\u0027d filched from him. He knew its name and its nature but he couldn\u0027t tell. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-9.html","bookId":2596,"book":{"id":2596,"title":"Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Canticle (The Vampire Chronicles #10) \n Lestat is back with a vengeance and in thrall to Rowan Mayfair.
