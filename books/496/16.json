{"id":30262,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"\"Hush!\" he said gently, thinking me, I suppose, as indeed I was, at the point of calling aloud on the guard. \"I am unarmed, and would not hurt you if I could. What is your name?\" And his voice, for all that it was young and sweet, sounded like my father\u0027s, for which there was reason enough, as I was soon to know. \"My name is Drayton,\" I answered simply. \"And the other?\" he asked. \"Phil—Philip,\" I answered; and then I leapt to my feet as one waking from a dream, saying, as I did so, \"though, sooth, I know not why I tell you.\" With my moving he so changed his position that the glow of the fire fell upon his face, and I knew him for the priest that had been taken in the orchard. \"Nor I,\" he said sternly, \"for it is false. I am Philip Drayton.\" \"What, what!\" I cried, in much amazement. \"And is Sir Michael your father?\" \"Sir Michael is my father,\" he replied. \"And mine also,\" said I, very joyfully, with yet no thought of the terrible meaning of his presence. \"I took but little from my name. Lay the falsehood on my clothes. Brother Philip, I am Philippa.\" He seemed less pleased with the encounter than dismayed by my attire. \"My sister!\" he said; \"my sister in this guise!\" \"Nay, trust me,\" I said merrily, \"none knows me for a maid.\" And then he seemed to remember something, and, laying both hands on my shoulders, he held me off from him so that the light of the fire fell upon my face. \"My little sister!\" said he. \"I saw you, then, in the orchard. And was it you that saved the life of the Stadtholder of Holland?\" \"So they say,\" I replied, doubtfully, wondering at the joy I saw upon his countenance. \"I am glad of it,\" he said, \"right glad of it, indeed.\" And with that he heaved a great sigh of relief. \"Glad!\" I cried. \"Glad, you say! How can that be, when you yourself were one of those that would have slain him?\" \"With them indeed I was,\" he said; \"but I had no part in the planning that foul plot, and took none in its attempted execution. Had I even known the wickedness that was toward, I would not have obeyed what I deemed of all earthly commands the most terrible. By the happiest stroke of chance they did move my lodging to the chamber where is the sliding panel that gives upon the stair by which I have now reached you. Old Mr. Nathaniel Royston did show it me when I was but a little lad and you unborn. But he brought me no further than this chamber. I do remember,\" my brother continued, with a note in his voice that seemed to mark the man\u0027s sadness to recall a merry childhood, \"I do remember that he said, with his kindly chuckle, he must not show the rest of the secret to one that like enough would some day prove a Jesuit in disguise. Though he spoke in jest, he was a good prophet. And now, child,\" he said, with rapid change to a manner more urgent, \"you must show me what he would not.\" \"If you mean the secret way from the house,\" said I, \"I do not know it; nor I would not show it if I did. I am here on guard duty till Captain Royston return.\" \"Sister,\" said Philip, speaking with voice and words so solemn that heart and ear were enchained till he came to an end,—\"Sister, King James and his cause are dear to me. Holy Mother Church and her cause are yet more dear. But dearest of all (God forgive me!), dearest of all to me now, little sister Phil, is our dear father\u0027s honor and the honor of his house. It is no shame to him or to the Drayton name that I should work or fight for King James; none if I should spend my life to bring the dear land back to the true faith. But what one of us will hold up his head again if the name must be made foul, and stink in the nostrils of men, for a base plot of treachery and assassination? Therefore, child of my father, for the name\u0027s sake, let me go.\" With that he made to pass me and reach the door into the gallery, but I stepped between and took him by the arms. \"Do not move,\" I said; \"not one step, lest I call on the guard.\" And he stood like a statue of stone, while for a few moments, stretched by the gravity and tension of my thought into the seeming of hours, I was silent, and then: \"Philip,\" I said, \"if you are innocent of this wicked thing, why are you in England?\" And in a few words he told me of the mission on which he was come. Then said I: \"Will you now give it up—this mission—and return at once into France, if I let you go?\" And, seeing that he shook his head, \"Come,\" I said; \"be quick. It is that or naught. Swear it, and you may go for me. The Captain will be upon us soon, and then it will be too late.\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"It is an oath—a Drayton\u0027s oath?\" I asked. \"It is,\" said Philip. \"Then go, in God\u0027s name!\" I cried. \"Though, faith, I know not the secret passage, and I do not see how otherwise you should pass all the guards.\" \"I can but try,\" he answered; and again would have moved to the door, but in that moment I heard a footfall; and, being more sure from whom it came than whence, I bade Philip keep still, and ran as light as my heavy boots would allow to the door, drew it a little back, and peered into the passage. Mightily eased in mind by what I saw, which was little enough, being but the back of the sentry disappearing round the corner of the gallery, I softly pushed-to the door, whispering ere I turned: \"Quick! quick! Go now. \u0027T is your one chance. Thank God it was not Captain Royston; and the sentry is for the moment out of hearing.\" And uttering the last words I turned to find myself face to face with the man for whose absence I had just given thanks to God. He was looking at me over the table where he had just set down his candlestick beside the meat and wine he had fetched for me. And of all the terrible things of that night, none, I think, did send to my heart a pang so sharp as the sight of that flagon of wine and wooden platter of cold venison; verily, for a moment I felt, with his reproachful eye upon me, that I was indeed that base thing he could not choose but think me. \"Thank Him not too soon, thou devil\u0027s whelp!\" he said. Philip yet stood where I had left him. To him I went quickly and whispered: \"Go, while you may. I will engage him. He will not hurt me, for, if needs must, I will tell him who I am.\" Then, going over to Captain Royston with strut and swagger much belying the trembling that was within me: \"Sir,\" I said, laying hand to my sword, \"you give me an ill name.\" \"Less ill than your deeds,\" he answered with great bitterness. \"I went but to get you meat and drink, and, returning, thought of that secret way from the room above. I stepped over the sleeping sentry, unbolted the door and closed it softly behind me, only to find the bird flown. As I drew back the panel he had closed behind him and followed him down the stair, greatly fearing some mischance from his evasion, naught I imagined was so bad as the finding you together planning his escape. Was it for this I did cherish you, little viper?\" To all which, though his words did cut me to the heart, I but replied that I was no reptile, and that therefore he lied, hoping by such naughty words to provoke him to quarrel with me, while Philip was about escaping, purposing thereafter to tell him the truth, when that was accomplished for which I would not have him even in his own conscience held responsible. Me they could not very heavily punish, since from His Highness of Orange I took no pay, nor had sworn to him any oath. Nor was I altogether hopeless of persuading Ned to conceal his knowledge of what it would then be too late to prevent. \"Let me pass, boy,\" he cried, \"or I will whip you soundly with my belt.\" But when he would have put me aside, as I stood between them, I held him fast to the utmost of my strength. Finding I would still cling to him, he put his hand to the buckle of his belt. \"Whip, then,\" I said, \"for the man shall go free.\" And, though my flesh did most prophetically shudder beneath the imminent stripes, I thought that here was no bad way of gaining time for Philip, when I should come to weep, in Philippa\u0027s proper person, for the pain of that whipping. But he flung me off, muttering a plague on the Drayton countenance of me, and that the priest would make off if he did not seize him. \"He shall!\" I cried, half drawing my sword. \"What! Art afraid to draw on a lesser than thy hulking self?\" \"False and ingrate though you are, I would not hurt you,\" he said; \"and I will not call upon the guard; but I will have him again secure in his chamber, and so shield you, little devil, from all punishment but what I will myself administer when all is done.\" And as he advanced upon me and would have seized me, I lifted my cloak that was on the back of the settle and flung it over his head, where, for a brief space, despite his struggles, I held it. And while his eyes were thus blinded for a moment, Philip, swift and silent, slipped past us and through the door of the stair to the Prince\u0027s chamber. Royston, however, soon flung me off and tore the cloak from his head. And I saw at length great anger in his face, and with a last essay at strategy did leap to the door that gives upon the gallery, as if indeed I defended Philip\u0027s retreat; and there, with drawn sword and taunting words, I defied him. And then he came, and our swords met. And finding, as well I had known I should find, that he was too strong for me, I was, after a pass or two, at the point of calling him by the old name and of telling mine, when he did something that had formed no part of the teaching he had given me with the foils, so that I found myself speedily at his mercy, and felt the sharp, cold prick of steel low down upon my neck. And then I thought my end was indeed come, and I tried to murmur: \"Spare me, dear Ned,\" but could not. Now all these things—from Ned\u0027s return to my foolish fainting at the first blood—that have in the telling taken so long did happen so quickly that perhaps seconds rather than minutes were their proper measure. And my enemy has since told me that what I have called my swooning seemed but the closing for a few moments of my eyes. But, however that may be, I do think it endured sufficiently for his great concern. For when I opened them I knew not at all where I should be until the white solicitude of his face bending close over brought me very soon to the consciousness of the strong and tender arms that held me. So, seeing I was come to myself, he led me towards the hearth, and set me in a chair. And then I began to feel a little smarting and a warmth of trickling blood. Taking my handkerchief, I thrust it beneath waistcoat and shirt, and pressed it upon the spot that did so smart, whence withdrawing it and seeing the blood upon it, I shuddered. \"Nay, nay,\" said Ned, while the lines of anxiety upon his face belied the little laugh he forced from his lips, \"fret not for a little blood. I thrust not hard. Wherefore did you anger me, monkey? Come,\" he added, laying his hand to the breast of my shirt and fingering the buttons with that awkwardness that a man has ever for garments that are not his, \"I will heal it.\" \"No,\" I said, pulling away his hands, \"you must not.\" \"But I would see the hurt, lad,\" he said. \"I know not why, but I am sorry I have hurt you. God knows, I have killed men and thought little of it, but this scratch to a child does mightily vex me.\" And again he would have loosed the buttons. \"Come, open your shirt,\" he said. \"I say I will not. I am not the lad you think me, sir.\" But even then he did not understand, but took my two hands in one of his, so great and strong that mine might scarce writhe themselves about within it, while he set himself to do what I would not for all his asking. And so it was that I came to the last line of my defences. \"Let be, dear Ned,\" I murmured, in that tone of pleading I had ever in the old days used when his will did offer to prove the stronger. \"Let be, dear; \u0027t is—\u0027t is thy little maid, Phil,\" I said, and dropped my eyes before him, and let my prisoned hands lie still. He stared upon me in an astonishment of wonder that discovered the white all round his eyes, and at first he would not believe. \"Nay, nay,\" he said, \"it is not so!\" And I lifted my eyes and so looked into his that he could no longer doubt. \"Verily, Ned, it is I. And I had told the sooner,\" I said, \"but that—but that—\" and, my words then failing, I again dropped my gaze before his. \"Phil!\" he cried. \"Is it even my little friend Phil? \u0027But,\u0027 you say—but what?\" \"But that I would not tell you—and could not—was ashamed, Ned, and did mightily desire to know had you forgot me.\" And here, laying my folded handkerchief to my wound inside my shirt, and fastening all close above it, I did see his face so lose color at thought of the hurt he had given me, that I laid my hand upon his, saying: \"Be not vexed, sweet Ned, \u0027t is but a scratch.\" \"I am right glad of it, Phil,\" he answered, \"if it be so. But indeed you should not run about in this guise. How came you to be so dressed?\" \"That story must wait,\" I replied merrily. \"But \u0027t is the first time, Ned, and shall be the last.\" \"And if you must needs be a man,\" he went on, \"but for a day, you should cleave like a man to one side, and not be so greedy of strife as to draw sword on both. There will be trouble over this priest when he is taken, as he will be, by the guard without.\" \"Listen, Ned,\" said I. \"That priest is my brother.\" \"What!\" he cried. \"Surely it is not Philip!\" \"Philip it is,\" said I, \"and no other, though I did not know him until he told me even now in this room. And also he did tell me, Ned, that he had no part in the assault upon His Highness.\" \"So much,\" said Ned, \"is true. I marked him.\" \"He told me, moreover,\" I continued, \"that the business that brought him to England was fair and honest, though it was for King James. There was another priest did force or trick him into companying with the murderers. Ned, dear Ned, I did mean letting him go for our father\u0027s sake and our name.\" And here I found no power, and perhaps little will, to restrain the catch of a sob in my throat. \"Men must not say \u0027spy,\u0027 \u0027plotmonger,\u0027 \u0027assassin,\u0027 when they say Drayton, Ned. You do forgive me?\" \"Right gladly,\" he answered, and seemed to muse for a little. And then, \"\u0027T is well,\" he said, \"that I did not wake the sentry that lay sleeping at his door.\" \"Why did you not?\" I asked. \"Because,\" he replied, \"though I thought all was safe, I would not have it known that I had left my post.\" With that he went softly to the door of the gallery and listened. \"It is strange,\" he said, when he was come again to my side, \"that I hear no sound of his capture. Yet he could not pass the sentry at the stair-head.\" \"He did not go that way,\" said I. \"But it was to defend that door,\" he retorted, \"that you drew on me.\" \"Ay, dear Ned,\" I answered, \"but that was to deceive you.\" \"But why, cunning one,\" he said, \"did you not at once tell me all?\" \"I feared you would be mighty stern,\" I answered; \"also, I was loath to tell you who I was. Moreover, Ned, I did think it best for you to have neither knowledge nor share in his escape, if I might procure it without your aid. I was afraid for you.\" \"And yet not afraid of your life?\" he asked. \"Nay, that too. But I thought,\" I replied ruefully, \"that I had enough cunning of fence to keep you off for a while; for I did often use to hold my own with the foils against you. In extremity I was to cry: \u0027\u0027T is I, Ned! kill me not!\u0027 But you were so fierce and strong.\" Whereat he laughed a little, sheathing his own sword and handing me mine. \"These are not foils,\" he said. \"But, if your brother went not by the gallery, where then? Is he returned to the chamber above?\" And he pointed to the gaping mouth of the secret stair. And right upon his words Philip entered the chamber from the Prince\u0027s stairway, and, closing the door behind him: \"I am here, Royston,\" he said. Royston heard, and, turning, grasped him by the hand. \"Ah! so it was there you did hide, old friend,\" he said. \"Faith, they did spoil a good man of his hands when they made you priest.\" And then I saw Ned\u0027s eyes travel to the door just closed; and he dropped Philip\u0027s hand, and his face blanched. \"In the name of God!\" he cried, \"what did you up there? Say that you were not in the Prince\u0027s chamber!\" And for the first time and the last I saw Edward Royston shaken by a passion of fear. \"It is from his chamber that I come,\" said Philip, speaking and bearing himself with great serenity. Poor Ned caught his breath with a sound sharp and hissing. \"Then, as there is a God above us,\" he whispered, \"if any harm has happened, I will slay you and the maid your sister, though I do love her, only before I kill myself.\" \"Go,\" said the priest, pointing to the stair, \"look on your Prince as he sleeps.\" \"Yes, I will go,\" replied Ned, flushing a little with hope born of Philip\u0027s calm. \"But I will not leave you free.\" I caught his great horseman\u0027s pistol from the table where Ned had laid it after escorting His Highness to his chamber. \"Go up, Ned,\" said I; and to Philip, as I pointed to a chair, \"Sit there, brother.\" And to Ned again: \"If he but rise from his chair before you return, I will shoot him, as surely as you shall kill me after him. Is it primed?\" I asked, for the pistol was of the pattern then coming into use, discharged by means of a falling flint. And he, taking it from my hand, and raising the dog, and peering into the pan for the priming, I added: \"But he will not move, for he has done no wrong.\" He put the weapon in my hand. \"You will not fail me?\" he asked, with a countenance very awful to see. For answer I looked once in his face. He turned and went swiftly through the little door and up the stair. Philip, as I think, knew it was no vain threat that I had made. But I, believing his conscience clean, had little doubt of a willing captive. The time passed unbroken with a word; hours it could not be, but whether minutes or seconds I do not know. And somewhere in the heart of my confidence there throbbed a little pricking pain of doubt. For, brother as he was, to me the man was yet a stranger. What if he were of those with whom all means are held lawful to the cherished end? Had not I, but an ignorant girl, done for one end what I had held base indeed for another? And for answer I clung to the stock of my weapon, and swore he should die if His Highness had suffered. For not only Drayton, but Royston honor also lay in the hollow of my hand. But I swore, too, that I would not long survive him; and, if Ned would do it, even death would not be wholly without sweetness. At last a step was on the stair, and my eyes went again to the little door. And, when I saw his returning face, I laughed aloud. \"You may well laugh, Mistress Philippa,\" he said, sheathing the sword that had not, I suppose, left his hand since it had leapt from the scabbard on his first doubt of Philip, \"for I was indeed a fool to doubt him.\" Then, turning to Philip: \"I did you wrong, Drayton,\" he said; \"the blame must lie on the evil company we did find you in.\" \"I should myself, I fear, doubt any man in such case,\" answered Philip. With that they fell to considering what should be done. Philip was at first for returning to his chamber above. But Ned had already taken his resolution. Sir Michael, he said, should not, in the sweet evening of a life of honor, see his house come to shame. \"You cannot, I do suppose,\" he continued, \"bring proof or witness of your innocence in the matter?\" \"He that alone could clear me,\" replied my brother, \"is escaped. Moreover, I do not think he bears me any good-will.\" \"Then you must go,\" declared Royston, in accents very positive. And I could not find it in me, for all the risk to him, to say him nay. So without more ado Ned went to the hearth, where, by means I did not till long after understand, he very quickly closed the opening in the wall whence Philip had entered. He next caused to appear, on the opposite side of the fire, a passage that was the counterpart of the first. He then returned to the table, and, pouring out wine from the flagon he had brought for me: \"Drink,\" he said to Philip, \"and listen. There is little time to spare, for the officer of the watch will soon go again upon his round. You found but half the secret. There,\" he said, pointing to the grim aperture in the wall of the hearth, of which the dancing light of the flames served but to mark the deeper gloom, \"there is the other half. Descend these stairs and follow the gallery. You cannot miss the way. It will take you out among the rocks below the bridge. Thence follow the stream until you are come to the old mill, whence you may with ease reach the highroad.\" \"From the mill,\" answered Philip, \"I shall know my way. God bless you, Royston! It is for the old man\u0027s sake.\" He grasped Ned\u0027s hand, laid his own upon my head as if in benediction, and would have left us. \"There is one word more to say,\" said Royston; and Philip turned on the edge of the hearth to hear it. \"I cannot let you go,\" continued the man who would not take the smallest risk of harming his master even in the moment when he was going open-eyed into the danger of branding as a traitor, \"I cannot let you go to do further hurt, how honest and open soever, to the cause I serve.\" \"As I gave it to my sister but now,\" answered Philip, \"you have my promise to do nothing for the King, nor against him of Orange, until I have set foot in France.\" \"It will serve,\" replied Ned. \"But—\" he added, and then paused, as if with a hesitation of delicacy. \"What? Another doubt?\" cried Philip, with a laugh. \"They say—with what truth I do not know,\" continued Ned,—\"but said it is, that those of your order have strange quirks and quibbles to ease the conscience of oaths and other matters.\" \"Ah!\" said Philip. \"On what, then, or by what, shall I swear to you?\" \"Swear me no oath,\" answered Royston. \"Give me your hand and your word as a gentleman of England to abide by the spirit of your promise.\" So Philip gave him his hand and a straight look in the eyes. \"You have it, lad,\" he said, in convincing accents of simple truth, and so left us, disappearing into the dark chasm of the wall. Now Ned had but just closed behind his retreat the door of stone (by that means which I now know, but will not here set down; for who can tell if political trouble be even yet forever at an end in England?) when there came a hand upon the door. Ned dropped into a seat, muttering: \"But just in time!\" while I, feigning sleep, stretched myself in my corner of the settle. \"Is all well, Captain?\" asked the cheery voice of M. de Rondiniacque, as he entered from the gallery. \"All is well, Lieutenant,\" replied Royston, with a very fine assumption of carelessness. And then the officer of the watch drew near, looking down upon me, as I suppose (for my eyes were fast closed), with curiosity. \"Ma foi!\" he cried, \"the peevish youth leaves you not, Captain. He is mighty pale in the face for one that sleeps.\" \"He is little used, I think, to fatigue,\" replied Ned. \"Is all well without, Lieutenant?\" \"Mon capitaine,\" said De Rondiniacque, \"not a mouse stirs.\" And so saluted and retired as he had come. When the sound of his feet had died away, \"Thank Heaven!\" I whispered, \"the danger is past!\" \"For your brother, yes,\" Ned answered softly. \"For us it is to come.\" \"Nay, indeed, I hope not so,\" said I. \"And for him, how shall I thank you, Captain Royston?\" \"Dear child,\" he said, with a flash of eagerness lighting his eyes, \"do not call me captain. Were I not like ere long to be a man disgraced, I could ask you for thanks, but——\" And I, who had ever wholly trusted him and desired nothing so much as that he should ask in payment what had long been his, made no parley with modesty, but at once replied: \"Nay, but ask, dear Ned; do but ask. You will never in my eyes be disgraced.\" But when he began to reply that it was a great thing he would ask, of which the granting would bear the balance well down on the other side, Dame Fate played the careful due?a to the poor maid that thought herself in hands safe enough without any such protection. I mean that before Ned was well launched in that tale of what he would have of me, the door at the winding stair\u0027s foot did again open; and, of all the many times these divers doors had in the last few hours moved upon their hinges, this was the worst opening; for, wrapped in a great black cloak thrown hurriedly around him, there came His Highness of Orange. And, but that I knew none other could then come that road, I do not think I should have known him for the man that had of late bid me so kindly good-night. For over his face was a cloud of anger very awful to see. We sprang to our feet, and Captain Royston saluted. Passing this military courtesy unacknowledged, the Prince at once addressed him in a voice so harsh and with a manner so cruel (as it seemed to me) that I fell into a great fear and assurance that he had by some means discovered both too much and too little; and my heart seemed to melt to water within me, so that I despaired of ever setting my lover right in the eyes of his Prince. \"You watch well over my slumbers, Captain,\" was indeed all he said; but voice and countenance were more than words, and I felt as I have said. \"It has been my endeavor, Your Highness,\" answered Royston, with much dignity, and a face the color of ashes. \"A good watch: a mighty careful and anxious watch, Captain!\" the Prince continued. \"I do not always sleep, Captain Royston, when my eyes seem closed, and I truly believe your care lacked little of prolonging my rest to the awful Day of Judgment.\" \"I do not understand Your Highness\u0027s words,\" said Royston. The Prince crossed the room to the outer door, and, with his hand upon it: \"I shall presently explain them,\" he said, and so went out into the gallery. \"Ned,\" I cried, so soon as he was gone, \"I will tell him all!\" \"That you shall not,\" he replied. \"How much does he know?\" I asked, trembling as I spoke. \"I cannot tell,\" answered Ned. \"But to tell him all in this mood will but harm you and yours; perhaps lead to Philip\u0027s capture, and yet do me no service. He will never pass over this one thing,—that I did let your brother go. And he will know that soon enough, telling or none.\" And here the door opening again, we were perforce silent. I could hear His Highness\u0027s last few words to the sentry, spoken in a tongue I took to be Dutch, because I did not understand it, but, among them occurring the names Schomberg, Bentinck, De Rondiniacque, I guessed he had summoned those gentlemen to attend him. Then His Highness returned into the chamber, and for a while we stood silent, regarding one another as the footsteps of the sentry died away down the gallery. At last Royston would have spoken. \"Your Highness—\" he began. But the Prince interrupted him. \"Be silent,\" he said, \"and wait.\" So in silence we waited, but how long I do not know. At length came M. de Rondiniacque, to be soon followed by Count Schomberg and Mr. Bentinck. These two had, it appeared, resumed their clothes in haste, and concealed the disorder of their attire each in long horse-cloaks, even as His Highness had done. And in these three stern figures of Prince, soldier, and statesman, close wrapped to the chin in dark and twisted folds of cloth, there was, I thought, an awful likeness to the bench of judges that sat in Hades. When the last had entered, the Prince thus addressed the three: \"It seems, gentlemen, that in the master of this house I have an enemy.\" At which point Mr. Bentinck, without at all staying the flow of the Prince\u0027s words, ejaculated a deep and guttural \"Ah!\" as one finding but what he had looked for. \"I therefore purpose, gentlemen, to question Captain Royston in your presence, and thereafter to take your censures in the matter of bringing him to fitting military trial for treason.\" \"I am no traitor to Your Highness, nor to any man,\" cried Royston, with blunt indignation. \"That we shall soon see, I believe,\" said His Highness. \"Did you not appoint yourself this night, with my consent, the innermost guard of my person?\" \"I did,\" answered Royston. \"Then where is the prisoner; he that called himself priest?\" asked the Prince, turning on him a gaze that called to my mind tales I had read of the Inquisitors of Spain, so piercing and ruthless was it. \"He is escaped!\" replied poor Ned. \"By your aid?\" asked the Inquisitor. \"By my aid,\" replied the accused. \"He was here in converse with you?\" \"He was.\" \"By what means did he avoid the guard?\" \"That,\" said Royston, \"I will not tell.\" And his eyes flashed, and his head, never humbled, rose yet more erect; and I knew he was glad he could now use boldness where he saw he was to expect no mercy. And, of the three men that were listening to these questions and answers, one said: \"Oh!\" another \"Ah!\" while the third drew in his breath with a sound of hissing. \"I see, gentlemen,\" said William, \"that you mark him.\" Then, to Royston: \"To what end did you aid his flight? Will you at least tell me that?\" \"Nor that neither,\" said he boldly, yet without insolence. \"The priest,\" said His Highness, \"did enter my chamber while he thought I slept.\" \"\u0027T is like enough that he did,\" replied Royston. \"And afterwards you also,\" said the Prince, \"with naked sword.\" \"I did,\" said Royston, \"but to no end but to be assured of Your Highness\u0027s safety.\" Now when Captain Royston had first declared the escape of the priest, I had marked M. de Rondiniacque step for a moment into the gallery, whence he soon returned. It appears that he had in that moment\u0027s absence despatched one of the three soldiers that were on duty without the door to the room on the floor above, whence that escape had been effected. This man now rapping upon the door, M. de Rondiniacque opened to him, heard his report, and returned to his place beside Marshal Schomberg. His Highness observing these movements, and enquiring what was to do, M. de Rondiniacque replied that it was even as Captain Royston had said, the priest\u0027s door being unfastened and his chamber empty. His Highness acknowledged the news with a brief gesture, and continued: \"Do I then, gentlemen, greatly err to suppose that this house has been a snare to us? Do not the events of this night give a dreadful significance to those of the afternoon?\" \"It is plainly so,\" said Count Schomberg. \"Your Highness,\" growled Mr. Bentinck, \"knows well my opinion, from the warnings I have already given him.\" As it appeared now M. de Rondiniacque\u0027s turn to add his voice to this concert of his superiors, while yet no sound came from him, the Prince turned upon him a keen glance of enquiry. \"I must agree, Monseigneur,\" he said, with a very lively distress appearing in his countenance, \"unless, indeed, there be some reason behind it all, which Captain Royston may now disclose. I have always found him a gentleman of the nicest honor,\" he continued, gathering courage, \"and I observe that there is against him no proof but what his own word has afforded. None saw the unfastening of the door, none saw the man\u0027s escape: it were more after the fashion of the vulgar traitor to deny all, and to ascribe his appearance in Your Highness\u0027s chamber—\" and here the good Frenchman checked his speech. \"To what, sir?\" demanded the Prince, the gloom of anger growing, I thought, yet deeper upon his face. \"To the disordered fancy of an uneasy sleeper,\" replied De Rondiniacque fearlessly. \"Your advocacy carries you too far, Lieutenant,\" said His Highness, in tones that I feared must at once silence our only friend. \"Your Highness will pardon me if I point out that I make no defence for Captain Royston,\" insisted De Rondiniacque, stepping a little forward with a graceful ease and a frank glance in His Highness\u0027s face that I think had taken by storm any woman\u0027s heart less strongly garrisoned than the only one in reach. \"I but point out the traitor\u0027s refuge, of which he has made no use. If I err in saying as much, I will beg Your Highness to remember that the accused gentleman has been my friend and comrade.\" With which words he saluted and retired to his former position. And I think that what he had said and the way he bore himself were not wholly without effect upon the Prince: for he turned to Captain Royston, and asked him, with some slight approach to gentleness, had he any explanation to offer. \"I can but assure Your Highness,\" said Captain Royston, \"that throughout I have done nothing adverse to Your Highness\u0027s great cause, nor to his person, nor to the honor and faith I do hold them in.\" \"And is this all?\" asked William. \"Before these gentlemen, sir,\" he replied, \"it is all. But I hold the true fulness of the matter ever ready for your private ear.\" \"My private ear, sir,\" answered the Prince, \"is like to be much abused if I give my closet for every traitor\u0027s subtile excuses.\" \"I offer none,\" said Royston, with the rigid pride of despair. \"And none,\" said His Highness, \"save in this company, will I hear. Keep your tale, sir, for to-morrow\u0027s court-martial. You are under arrest. Your sword, Captain Royston. Lieutenant de Rondiniacque, see to it that this one at least do not escape.\" And then, as poor Ned slowly drew his sword, and tendered the hilt to the Prince, His Highness, waving it aside, signified to M. de Rondiniacque by a gesture that he should take it. \"\u0027T is not such,\" he said, \"that I have need of.\" Which bitter speech came near to breaking down the restraint in which the man had held himself. I saw the blood fly to his face, the half-step forward, the hands clenched by his sides; I heard the one dread word on his lips. \"God—!\" he gasped, and again curbed himself. \"No words of heat, sir!\" said the Prince. \"I did once take you for my friend. Is mine the fault that you prove an enemy? Weigh well what defence you will make to-morrow; let me warn you that courts-martial in time of war are swift in procedure and deadly in sentence. Should such court hear from your lips no more than we have now heard, make your peace with God.\" And with that he would have left the room; but I, beside myself with terror, caught him by the arm, and tried to speak. The Prince, however, shook me off, bidding me roughly not to court his notice; saying that this was not a court of justice nor of favor, but a camp; and that I was happy not to come within the purview of its jurisdiction. But I found my tongue, and said: \"Your Highness must in courtesy hear me.\" On which, with little enough, he bade me speak. \"I do solemnly swear,\" said I, \"before the God that shall judge us all——\" \"Beware, young man,\" interrupted His Highness, \"lest you take that awful name in vain.\" \"The more awful, great, and holy,\" I replied, \"the readier my will to take it now. And even so I swear that Captain Royston is no traitor. What he has done, I have done. I will tell Your Highness all.\" \"Be silent,\" said Ned. \"I do forbid it. You harm my case.\" \"Nay, then,\" I replied, \"I will not. But it is even as I say.\" The Prince looked in my face, and I thought that his did a little soften. \"I would I believed you, boy,\" he said, in gentler tones. \"But I do not believe.\" And with that a great hope sprang into my mind, and—\"Some day you must believe,\" I cried. \"But now I will ask no more than Your Highness has already granted.\" And I drew forth from its sheath the sword His Highness had given me. \"What is your meaning?\" asked the Prince sternly, the frown coming dark again across his face. \"They say that I came between Your Highness and great danger,\" I replied, with an inward prayer for the courage and the skill of words that I so sorely needed, \"in recompense of which you have given me this sword. According to the word that was given with it, I now render it again,\" and here I knelt before him, holding out the weapon by the blade, the handle toward the Prince, \"praying that my friend, Edward Royston, Captain in Your Highness\u0027s Swedish Regiment of Horse, may stand in rank, duties, and honor, as he stood before this matter did arise. And I ask, moreover, that, when there shall be an end of the present troubles, Your Highness will bring him to fitting examination and judgment, to the end that his virtue may appear to all men.\" \"\u0027T is a request of many heads and much length,\" said the Prince, with a smile of much sarcasm. \"Indeed, it has but one head,\" I replied. \"I pray Your Highness to suspend his case till the war be done. Is it granted?\" \"No,\" said the Prince; \"it is not granted, and it shall not be.\" \"And wherefore not?\" I demanded, with a boldness that does at this present vastly astonish me to think on. \"I gave the sword, with its pledge,\" he replied, \"to one I thought loyal to my person and a friend to my cause, the liberties of England. I am not, and may never be, a king; and I have not learned,\" he said, with irony very cynical, \"to grant favor to traitors.\" \"But you are a great Prince,\" I persisted; \"a Prince, I have heard tell, that never departs from his plighted word. This pledge I hold until it be redeemed. Again I entreat Your Highness to return to Captain Royston his sword.\" \"Give me that in your hand,\" he said, after a moment\u0027s thought, which had taken him, with a few pondering paces, to some distance from the spot where I yet knelt. But as I rose to bring it to him, I believe he read in my face the joy that I felt within, for, raising his hand with a gesture that at once checked my advance—\"Nay,\" he said, \"I will not give him back the sword he has dishonored. But, for my word\u0027s sake, he has his life and liberty. Let him begone. And if he cross my path again, to raise his hand by never so little against me or mine; if he be found after this night ever within my lines, he dies—as spies die, Master Royston,\" he added, turning upon him a glance of keen contempt. Then, after a little pause, he said, with great solemnity, \"May the life I give serve unto repentance.\" In that moment I think poor Ned\u0027s heart was very near breaking. In a voice slow and measured from the restraint he used, he said that he would not accept his life at such a price. His Highness, replying that the choice did not lie with him, turned sharply to me and said: \"Give me the sword.\" And then the sight of the stricken man\u0027s white and ghastly face—stricken for his faith to me and my people—inspired my heart to the most audacious act of my life. I took the sword by the hilt, and, pressing hard upon it with both hands, bent down the lower part until a portion lay upon the floor. On this setting my foot with all my body\u0027s weight to back it, I wrenched the hilt over toward the point, so that the blade broke some seven inches from the end. M. de Rondiniacque, stepping forward to arrest my purpose, was too late. I waved him back with a gesture I took to be mighty full of haughtiness, and, standing firm upon the fragment, I presented the hilt to His Highness of Orange. On the snapping of the blade the Prince had started in anger; as I handed him the truncated weapon, he drew back and—\"What is this?\" he cried. \"Your Highness grants no more than half my prayer,\" I replied. \"I render half the pledge.\" \"The greater half,\" he said, and in despite of himself he smiled. Being by that smile much emboldened, I answered: \"Then I am more generous than William, Prince of Orange. For life,\" I said, lifting from the floor the broken point of the sword, \"is less than honor. Yet, like His Highness, I keep the point that kills.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3281/89809.html","bookId":496,"book":{"id":496,"title":"The Sword of the King","description":"简介： It is matter of no small difficulty and hesitation for a woman to tell a storyin especial, her own storyfrom the beginning of it even to the end, and to hold, as it were, a straight course throughout.
