{"id":92331,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"The next morning, I again scoured the daily paper. I couldn\u0027t believe the violent showdown at Cesar Cicereau\u0027s Starlight Lodge a few days ago was still off the local media radar. Could he really keep the press in the dark about his secret mountain killing ground? What an ugly amount of power.\\n\\n While skimming the Las Vegas online Review-Journal, I was astounded to spot an item about Caressa Teagarden, \"one of the last living legends of the early film era.\" Seems she\u0027d recently relocated to the Las Vegas Sunset City retirement community\\n\\n I\u0027d been assigned to interview her at Wichita \u0027s Sunset City franchise just before I left the Kansas TV station a couple months ago. Unlike senior citizens who had flocked to Sun City retirement communities until death did them part since the 1950s, senior citizens in today\u0027s Sunset Cities seemed to live on forever. Rumor had it that the North Koreans, through various experiments, had invented a method of replacing death with a \"twilight awake\" state. A thing like that would rake in billions. Think Donald Trump paying to be preserved in amber, comb-over and all. Forever.\\n\\n I\u0027d never met Miss Teagarden. My assignment editor said she\u0027d \"pulled the plug\" on her Sunset City contract. \"Died,\" in a way: let herself fade out of physical and even virtual existence.\\n\\n Not true, apparently. I didn\u0027t fret about the cancellation at the time-I\u0027d had bigger issues to deal with, like the sabotage of my entire career-but lies always made me want to find out what was true.\\n\\n And now, Caressa Teagarden had popped up here. It was almost as if she\u0027d followed me. Why?\\n\\n I decided she was worth looking up. She\u0027d been a big star in the Silver Screen days and might have known some of the CinSims I\u0027d met here in Vegas. The local reporter gave me Miss Teagarden\u0027s number-professional courtesy-and we made an instant date.\\n\\n After a short drive into the desert, Dolly and I entered an artificially maintained setting out of a movie company back lot of specialty sets. We navigated the winding, tree-shaded lanes that surrounded the picture-book community\u0027s large artificial lake and finally found a sprawling, shingle-sided cottage that read \"Teagarden\" on the gate.\\n\\n When I knocked (no doorbell) on the arched front door, the sight of the bent, wrinkled, old lady who answered almost physically knocked me over. Most people vain enough to extend their life spans by hook or crook or scientific experimentation had major plastic surgery before signing up for semi-immortality.\\n\\n Caressa Teagarden was what she would have been before the Millennium Revelation at her age: a crone-a papery, somehow radiant dandelion fluff of a crone. She even used a cane, a sight seldom seen these days when everyone was forever young.\\n\\n \"Come in, young lady. I have tea and scones for you. Scones with currants. Not raisins! The only way to make them.\"\\n\\n I tiptoed inside like an elephant in a Venetian glass shop.\\n\\n The place was a gingerbread dollhouse, even more so than the Enchanted Cottage. Doilies were everywhere and furniture with carved curved legs broadcast the scent of lemon oil. My bottomless homesickness was sinking into the atmosphere like tired feet into a down pillow, a lavender-scented down pillow.\\n\\n \"Sit down, dear. You came to interview me for your...blog? What an ugly, modern term. I like to remember the old days, but I hope your questions aren\u0027t too prying.\"\\n\\n \"Prying? Ah. No.\" Star power had me by my Dorothy Gale heart. There is no place like home. Too bad I\u0027d never had one.\\n\\n My guilt at \"interviewing\" her for a fictional blog faded. Like many oldsters, she craved talk.\\n\\n \"Have a scone.\" She leaned close and confidentially. \"It\u0027s the currants that make the scones. Very potent berries, you know. Sip your tea, dear. I\u0027ve made a rather thorough study of tea over the... years. It\u0027s in my name, you see. Of course that\u0027s a screen name.\"\\n\\n \"Teagarden, you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and not my first. My twin sister and I were a child act in vaudeville, Lilah and Lili Lockheart, only our real last name was Zellinsky. I went west and became a star.\"\\n\\n \"And Lili?\"\\n\\n \"She stayed back East and we lost touch. They wanted me to play the Good Witch Glinda. In Oz. I declined, and it went to that vibrato-voiced ditz-oh, did I almost say bitch?-Billie Burke.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know why I consented to this interview?\" Caressa/Lilah asked, abruptly fast-forwarding from the past to here and now, as the old will sometimes. \"I need to get something on record.\"\\n\\n About her career? Or... I thought madly back, trying to recall any indiscretions, any dead hunky actor I should be asking about.\\n\\n \"Not that, dear girl!\"\\n\\n Could the old lady read my mind?\\n\\n \"This generation is so enamored of digging up dirt. It\u0027s my history I wish to have recorded. My family history. That\u0027s more important than anything I\u0027ve ever done on the screen or off it in some overdone satin boudoir. Decor was so over-the-top in the thirties.\"\\n\\n Family history. Maybe it was the old-fashioned ambiance, but the phrase almost made me choke up. My only family history had vaporized back in Kansas at Smokerise Farm when Achilles had died.\\n\\n \"Pull yourself together and listen, Miss Street.\" Miss Teagarden\u0027s cane pounded the wooden floor, jolting me out of contemplating my still-fresh loss.\\n\\n \"I am the last of my family line. Oh, there are surviving cousins-first, second, third unto the loony power-but I am the last surviving descendant of Jean-Christophe l\u0027Argent.\"\\n\\n Wow.\\n\\n Who the hell was Jean-Christophe l\u0027Argent? And was he any relation to Christophe at the Inferno? She answered before I could ask.\\n\\n \"He was a famed French artisan who carved many of the most artistic gargoyles on Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The decorative gargoyles acted as necessary waterspouts but they were also thought to guard against evil spirits and monsters. Most people forget, though, that a great monster begat the gargoyles.\"\\n\\n \"A monster?\"\\n\\n \"The fire-breathing, water-spouting, shipwrecking, human-eating dragon called La Gargouille, who purportedly lived in a cave near the river Seine in the sixth century. To placate this monster, murderers and maidens were annually tossed into the Seine. The gargoyles on Notre Dame and other medieval cathedrals were made to guard against the monster, Miss Street, and also to commemorate the dragon\u0027s dread reign.\"\\n\\n I shivered to hear the tale of the devouring dragon and its victims and thought about rock star Cocaine\u0027s nightly entrance on a dragon\u0027s head. What evil forces could that stage effect represent?\\n\\n Caressa saw her tale\u0027s effect on me. \"My ancestor\u0027s work was more than what it seemed, just as you are.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I am. I\u0027m an orphan.\"\\n\\n \"Ah. Give me your cup. I can read tea leaves.\" She snatched my empty cup. \"Ah. I thought so. You have a split soul, as I do. You are surrounded by split souls, dear girl. That is your gift and your curse.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d recently discovered an unknown double. Of course my soul might be split. Now I had a curse?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re giving me chills.\"\\n\\n \"Tut. I\u0027m just an old lady and I\u0027m not really here, am I? I\u0027m just a shadow of myself.\"\\n\\n That shadow and split soul stuff spooked me, so did the names Lilah and Lili and the lost twin left behind. Sometimes I did feel I was chasing a shadow in hunting Lilith and that I\u0027d never find a piece of family.\\n\\n Caressa\u0027s knobby arthritic fingers crunched down on mine until I winced. \"Self-pity is a servant who will bite you in two. This hand you feel has been wracked with constant pain for forty years.\"\\n\\n It was crushing mine. I nodded, the tears in my eyes now from pain, not pity for myself or anyone else.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll find you a book on my ancestor.\" She rose and tottered toward some bookshelves. Her cane prodded a low footstool into place in front of them.\\n\\n \"Please, let me-\"\\n\\n \"I let you and I let you and I never do for myself again.\"\\n\\n She swiped at me with the cane like an arthritic old cat showing its claws. I backed off, but stood guard behind her frail form as she climbed up and leaned left, then right, searching for just the right crumbling spine (not her own).\\n\\n \"Here. See for yourself. Jean-Christophe l\u0027Argent, master gargoyle carver, a Frenchman famed for his work on churches.\"\\n\\n I turned the brittle pages. The illustrations were engraved drawings, not photographs. I glimpsed twisted gargoyle faces turned to stone as if frozen in some instant of eternal judgment.\\n\\n \"My ancestor had other work, my dear,\" she said cryptically, \"as do you and I.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you will.\" Her eyelids lowered. They were as wrinkled as a silk broomstick skirt.\\n\\n Broomstick. Was she a real witch, unlike Glinda?\\n\\n We sat again and she pressed the book into my fingers. I must take it, she insisted. I protested. It was her family history, not mine. She wouldn\u0027t let me leave without it. After all, I had followed her all this way to have an interview. Yes, she remembered that we were to do it before, but she\u0027d had a sudden...displacement. Such a fuss. I was here now too, and we\u0027d had time for a good talk. She moved between Sunset Cities, you see. An easy way to travel without leaving home.\\n\\n Often her focus and voice faded as she recounted scenes from her fabulous film life. \"Oh, William Powell! Yes. Born to play Nick Charles. Such a pity that the love of his life, Jean Harlow, died so young and tragically. Also a pity I can\u0027t leave Sunset City to visit him.\"\\n\\n Her pale, watery eyes fixed on mine. I had a sense of time as precious, like a Faberg�� egg. Circular in a way. Intricate and bejeweled. More than what it seemed, this humble bird shell. Rare large ostrich and emu shells from faraway lands. Pale robin\u0027s egg blue of ordinary nature. I had a sense of this time, with her, as fragile. She could be my grandmother...my great-great-great grandmother. My adopted grandmother.\\n\\n Suddenly an object appeared between us, in her knobby fingers. It was not a scone.\\n\\n The ring was almost black with age. Coiled with overdone scrollwork. Cheap. Pot metal. Old impure silver at best.\\n\\n \"You have listened to my life. This is in thanks. No, take it. My swollen knuckles are not for rings anymore. Besides, it\u0027s worthless, as you suspect.\"\\n\\n Her smile was crooked, like her spine, but still a thing of steel. \"You are too honorable to take anything of real value from a strange old woman.\" Irony curled around her words like wrought iron. \"This is in thanks for recording my l\u0027Argent family history.\"\\n\\n The ring was too big for my finger, and gaudy, and it would probably turn my skin green. I felt proud to accept it.\\n\\n Home at the Enchanted Cottage that night, I put the ring next to the vase holding Achilles\u0027 ashes on the mantel. My Lhasa apso had still been with me when I\u0027d first been assigned to interview Caressa/Lilah.\\n\\n Odd that she\u0027d preceded me to Las Vegas. I wondered why she was so vague about her twin as I headed up the stairs to bed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-9.html","bookId":2114,"book":{"id":2114,"title":"Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2)","description":"Storyline: Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2) \\n This book read like a first draft - maybe they just printed the wrong version?
