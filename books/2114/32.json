{"id":92354,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"I hadn\u0027t counted on Grizelle leading me to an elevator occupied by Snow. In fact, I came to a dead stop when I saw him. He was clad in the same studded and hooded black patent-leather wetsuit as Grizelle and me, but without my familiar\u0027s protective silver-mesh vest. The familiar wouldn\u0027t go undercover tonight. I caught Snow glancing at me and my fury surged. No. I had to keep cool and think. That\u0027s what I had to contribute to this mission: my knowledge of the Egyptian bloodsuckers and their minions, of the chambers I\u0027d seen and those I could only guess at. I could also speculate about what the Inferno brought to the table. I\u0027d assumed Snow had unsuspected resources and powers. I\u0027d suspected he could or would fight the Karnak bunch, but I\u0027d had no idea how battle-ready he was or why. Why was the Inferno so well equipped for fighting vampires when so few purportedly survived in Las Vegas? Or was this gear designed for fighting more than vampires? Snow\u0027s angular face looked scarier framed in severe black instead of his flowing white mane. He still wore sunglasses, but the lenses were gray, not black. However he looked or whatever he wore, he was the last monster I wanted to face tonight but the first I\u0027d like to hurt. \"I\u0027ll walk,\" I said, looking for a nearby exit sign that would indicate a staircase. \"Not possible.\" Grizelle grabbed my arm and propelled me into the small, bullet-shaped glass capsule. She placed me firmly on her right and stood between Snow and myself. We all faced forward. The stainless steel door closed and the elevator shot downward, scenes like a film on fast forward rocketing past the curved glass walls. Okay, I\u0027m a vintage film nut. This descent reminded me of that hokey thirties\u0027 Gene Autry Western-space movie serial, The Phantom Empire, where the cave\u0027s elevator led to a hidden futuristic world beneath the singing cowboy\u0027s Radio Ranch. \"This is a joke, right? Why are we going down?\" Snow answered without looking at me. \"If the Karnak vampires have as many guards as you say, we\u0027ll need to mount an expedition. We can\u0027t move a force that large along the Las Vegas Strip without attracting notice.\" A force? That sounded serious. For an instant my heart lifted. I didn\u0027t dare be hopeful. Ric could be dead by now. We whisked past areas as vast and dully dark scarlet as the planet Mars and as crowded as some World\u0027s Fair of the fey and unhuman. I glimpsed mutant beasts and humans, monsters and vistas of fire and ice. The levels pulsed in turn with such colors as lusty red, poison green, gold, the rust of shed blood. \"The Seven Deadly Sins,\" I whispered. \"Consider this a theme park under construction,\" Snow said. \"The plans are secret, so I expect you to honor that.\" A theme park of Dante \u0027s Inferno, of Hell itself! No one can say this Snow dude isn\u0027t cookin\u0027 on all four burners, Irma put in. I didn\u0027t answer her, but she made not one more risqu�� remark about my recent indiscretion. The elevator whooshed to a sudden but smooth stop and its doors slid open. All around us ancient stone pilings formed wide arches. This was the foundation of the many stories of vast modern theme hotel above us. It looked like an old sewer system; I heard water lapping at stone even through the hood. I touched my ear and felt a metal mesh that amplified hearing. High-tech accessories in a low-tech environment. So this was the cistern of Hell. It stank. Not of sulfur and brimstone...hated word!... but of damp mossy stone and still, oily, fetid water. Under Las Vegas? \"Call it my subterranean river Styx,\" Snow said, answering my unspoken question. Had the damned Brimstone Kiss made him able to read my mind? He and Grizelle began striding alongside the dark, broad water. I followed, scenting an odd tinge of brimstone in the damp air underground. Maybe it was just the reek of my conscience. We walked for what I guessed were three Las Vegas Strip blocks. I figured we were at the back of the Inferno layout. The area opened up into an underground plain of stones and arches. Through one of the arches rows of huge freight elevators were disgorging men and women wearing the same metal-imbedded wetsuits we did, except they were less shiny, and had Inferno security force badges on the shoulders. They were pulling trolleys loaded with racks of weapons, everything from machine guns to shotguns to swords and axes to flame-throwers. Behind them came another cadre of wet-suited people. I froze when one of the new men walked up to me, a sword belt hung over one shoulder and a nasty-looking machine pistol on a bandolier over the other, squinting to fix my face in his focus. \"Sansouci.\" Only the green eyes gave him away. In the fury of a fight, we\u0027d know our own by the uniform only. And it would be a furious fight, given the weaponry. I eyed Snow\u0027s back. He\u0027d believed me, at least, about the numbers and killing instincts of the Karnak crew. \"You\u0027re here because-?\" I asked Sansouci. \"Christophe convinced Cicereau the Karnak vampires posed a clear and present danger to us all. I\u0027m guessing that you\u0027re behind this.\" \"Why?\u0027 \"Ever since you hit town, things have been going to Hell.\" He looked around with a raised eyebrow. \"My orders are to protect our forces first and kill vampires second, but I\u0027ll watch your back.\" \"Why?\" \"I like the looks of it.\" \"You haven\u0027t seen it.\" \"I go on instinct.\" \"Christophe didn\u0027t tell you the Karnak vampires are holding Ric and he knows stuff they\u0027re almost dying to find out?\" \"Shit. No. I\u0027m sorry. Christophe\u0027s people didn\u0027t mention that. Cicereau wouldn\u0027t give a fang about an ex-FBI man.\" \"And you?\" \"I told you. I like you and your back, sight unseen. If he\u0027s your main man and if vampires want him that bad, I\u0027ll watch his back if we find him too.\" I raised an eyebrow. Maybe Sansouci could be an ally, after all. \"You help save Ric and I\u0027ll\"-I really couldn\u0027t offer him anything he\u0027d want-\"try to return the favor some day.\" He nodded briskly. \"Fair enough.\" \"You don\u0027t mind going after your... kind?\" \"These creatures aren\u0027t my \u0027kind\u0027, vampire or not.\" Sansouci frowned at me. \"I\u0027ve never seen even you so pale, baby pale. How\u0027d you get Christophe to go to war?\" \"My silver Irish tongue?\" My knee-jerk, defensive quip had come too close to the truth. And Sansouci was no fool. I could feel my cheeks flaming as if I suddenly stood over a campfire. \"Huh. You paid his price, whatever it was, didn\u0027t you?\" \"So did Cicereau, evidently.\" Checkmate. We turned to watch the Inferno forces and Cicereau\u0027s muscle men sling weapons over and torsos and every limbs. The echoes of the din were almost deafening. Sansouci grinned. \"Super-fine equipment. Never did cotton to mummies. The werewolves are only in human form right now, but they\u0027re fierce fighters even so, and needed some exercise.\" He eyed me again. \"We going to run into those devil-dogs again?\" \"Hyenas with eternal, supernatural strength.\" \"Good.\" Sansouci hefted his bandoliers tighter over his wide shoulders. \"Thanks for the mission.\" I stood alone. I felt as edged as a weapon, ready to turn my shame and fury against whoever opposed us. When Grizelle strode over, weapon-hung and holding a sword belt for me, I tightened with dislike. \"I\u0027m your partner. I\u0027ve got the flame-thrower, you\u0027ve got the sword. Slash and burn is our game. Vamps are super-fast and super-powerful. No mercy is the only way to deal with them. You ready?\" I nodded. I was ultra-ready to show no mercy to someone. \"What about... your boss?\" \"What about him?\" \"Who\u0027s his partner if you\u0027re with me?\" \"Like you\u0027d worry?\" Her white smile showed the teeth of the tiger. She nodded to the dark river\u0027s edge. I saw a tongue of stone pier thrusting out into the dark water where the river had widened into a lake as far as was visible in this dim underworld. A lone black figure stood at the end of the pier, one dead-white, ungauntleted hand throwing a veil of what appeared to be gray powder into the water. He spoke, intoned, words that echoed off the stones. \"In the names of the murderers and the maidens and time immemorial, I command your ashes to congeal. I command you, La Gargouille, to rise.\" Shivers coursed under my leather wetsuit as I remembered Caressa Teagarden\u0027s tales of her ancestor, the gargoyle carver of Notre Dame. This was not a mere gargoyle that Snow was summoning. This was the dragon of the Seine itself, supposedly burned to ashes by a holy cardinal. Who was Snow that he could cast ashes on the water to rise as serpentine flesh and scale? What was he? Devil or angel... or something even more or less, using powers holy or hellish? But that was then, the legend of the water dragon, in Medieval France, and this was now in Middle-evil Earth, and it was becoming reality. The dark river water boiled like a vast pot of oil. Then a huge, pale-scaled form came rising, dripping gouts black as old blood, folding its webbed wings against its massive curved sides. Only one head crowned its long, serpent-supple neck, but it bowed to Snow who leaped upon it. Up he rose to the cavern apex on that thorny, massive brow. \"This is a rescue mission, a raid,\" Snow\u0027s rock-concert voice boomed off the rock walls and water. \"We will stop all opposition forces encountered with whatever means suits their breed and any mortal and immortal allies they may have. \"My mount\u0027s fiery breath will sear our foes dead; until they number few enough to get past. At that point we\u0027ll be hand-to-hand. Grizelle and I will lead, along with Sansouci of the Cicereau syndicate. Each fighter must be on the alert for a mortal prisoner, a Latino man of great value to the vampires-and a prize for our party. He\u0027ll be hidden and well-guarded.\" The dragon began stalking, its huge body as hidden as the bulk of an iceberg, down the shallow river, towing an armada of empty shallow-bottomed barges. Its cave-entrance-size nostrils snorted mists of steam. The armed forces shouted in triumph at the size and power of their leading edge, and waded to the thigh-tops into the fearsome dark shallows to scramble aboard the barges. \"Where are they going?\" I asked Grizelle She picked me up like a doll. \"Where we are. Along the doom-driven river Styx to the sacred river of the Egyptian dead and the temple of Karnak. I\u0027m here on orders that you don\u0027t get your feet wet in Hell or in the river of blood that will soon flow under the Karnak.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-32.html","bookId":2114,"book":{"id":2114,"title":"Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2)","description":"Storyline: Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2) This book read like a first draft - maybe they just printed the wrong version?
