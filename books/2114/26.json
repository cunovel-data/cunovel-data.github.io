{"id":92348,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"YOUwent to the Karnak? Alone? Jesus, Delilah!\" Ric had caught me on the cell phone coming back from the Inferno in Dolly. We\u0027d met on the far fringes of a Sonic Drive-in lot. Now we were leaning against our parked cars and exchanging sour little nothings. \"Why are you getting so bent out of shape? It\u0027s a tourist attraction, for God\u0027s sake.\" \"It has an evil reputation.\" \"Worse than the Inferno?\" \"Maybe. People have been disappearing there.\" \"People?\" \"Yeah. Humans like you and me. The Karnak is an even newer player on the scene than the Inferno and nobody knows much about it.\" \"Nobody until now.\" I\u0027d been ready to bubble over about all I\u0027d encountered there when I intercepted Ric, but I was reaching the threshold of my endurance of running around like normal with the constant pain throbbing in my stomach, back, and thighs. \"You scouted the place?\" he asked, finally getting curious instead of overprotective. \"The place scouted me. I had an accidental audience with the owners, I think, and they are into attack spirit-hyenas, drawing out precious bodily fluids-a.k.a. embalming-ancient Egyptian sexual perversity, Old World depravity and death and tattooed genitalia.\" \"You found all this out in how long?\" \"Uh.\" I checked my wristwatch. \"Four hours.\" \"And you couldn\u0027t leave me a message before you went because-?\" \"I was just Strip-hopping. I didn\u0027t expect to find out anything interesting. Once I was inside, the Vegas Strip\u0027s famous inhospitality to cell phones kicked in.\" \"But you did find something and probably it was dangerously interesting and nobody knew where you were.\" \"I did.\" \"No one who could sound the alarm if you didn\u0027t come back. I\u0027m only worried because I care, Del. If you\u0027d had parents, you\u0027d have known about making sure the ones who love you know where you are.\" A girl is supposed to go all gooey when she hears those words from male lips. Ilove you. Especially from deeply familiar male lips. Maybe I would have on another day, but today I hurt and just felt antsy, like I did when my dreams pinned me flat on my back and vague bad things happened to me. I felt a panicked need to dodge. \"Does this mean I can\u0027t go anywhere without you?\" \"This means that you shouldn\u0027t go anywhere risky without telling me, or at least leaving me a message so I know where to send the coroner. Grisly Bahr would love to get you naked under his high-intensity lights.\" I made a face. \"He likes me, but he\u0027s not sadistic about it.\" \"Okay, I\u0027d love to get you naked under his high-intensity lights, but not dead.\" Only Ric could make me laugh and blush at the same time. \"See how oversensitive you\u0027re being, chica? If you worked on my FBI team, I\u0027d ask no less. Okay. You\u0027re an independent operative. So don\u0027t ask me to go somewhere you think warrants investigation, but don\u0027t forget to tell me where you are.\" \"The law enforcement version of the armed forces\u0027 issue-ducking credo: don\u0027t ask, but do tell.\" \"Right.\" He was laughing now too. \"Please don\u0027t rag on me, Ric. I had to leave the Karnak via a very rough exit, and I\u0027m still feeling a little shaky. Plus, I\u0027ve got menstrual cramps that could wake the dead.\" I\u0027d never confided my female troubles to a male before. Letting him in was my way of making up, and also getting him off my back. \"Querida.\" He drew me close, fanning his hands on my lower back where it felt like a guillotine blade was pushing in. My equally aching belly was tight against his pelvis. That male metabolism warmth was sandwiching my pain between his hands and torso. His body heat made me feel instantly better and I couldn\u0027t muffle a purr of contentment. \"Sorry,\" he whispered. \"You\u0027re coming to my place for some sangria and heat and massage. And then you can tell me all about what you found out today.\" His kiss before he let me loose promised that I wouldn\u0027t get to do much talking at all. But it all sounded wonderful to my worn body and mind. \"I\u0027m in your custody, ex-agent Montoya. P.I. Street reporting in, but I need to do some errands first.\" First, we stopped by Hector\u0027s estate to check my cottage and see how Quicksilver was doing. His food bowls were empty, his water bowl was half down, and he was out on doggy business of his own. Good. He wouldn\u0027t complain about my going off with Ric. I refilled both bowls, which were the size of large casserole dishes. Stainless steel, though. I grabbed my messenger bag with the fresh reload of tampons. Really romantic and just what a P.I. who should be packing a semiautomatic and spare clips needs. I was happy to leave Dolly parked there. I didn\u0027t feel like driving for once. Sliding low into Ric\u0027s Corvette took a lot of pressure off my aching back and environs. Ric started the therapy as soon as we were off the Strip and well on the way to his house. When he didn\u0027t need to shift the car, his right hand was pushing inside my clothes and caressing my skin in lazy patterns that-heavens to Betsy!-interrupted my fiendishly resistant cramp pain pathways to the brain. My toes curled in my sandals. \"So tell me about the Karnak,\" he asked. \"It\u0027s kinda hard to concentrate on that right now.\" He glanced over, his dark eyes even darker. \"You shouldn\u0027t be out on the edge when you\u0027re feeling lousy.\" \"Actually, it gives me an edge. You don\u0027t want to irritate me just now.\" \"No irritation, just soothing.\" My belly was almost numb from the hypnotic caresses. Ric brought his fingers to my mouth. \"No trespassing there tonight. I\u0027ll just have to find another way in.\" He thumbed open my lower lip, then penetrated my mouth, his thumb pushing between my teeth and against the roof of my mouth. The shaft of pleasure that arrowed through my belly made my feet flatten on the floorboard and my mouth turn into a suction machine, keeping his thumb captive. He laughed at the fierce physical pull of my response. \"I need to drive this baby,\" he said after a moment, reclaiming his thumb and the stick shift. Whew. I contemplated the possibility that not having sex might be as exciting as having it. The Vette turned a corner and then another, rocking me in the semi-recumbent cradle, and we were home. His home, anyway. Ric could never relax at the Enchanted Cottage as I did here, mainly because he didn\u0027t have an overzealous guard dog on duty. He escorted me inside, arm around my waist, stopping only to pull the day\u0027s mail out of the box as we passed. The sky was darkening, long past twilight. Gravity was helping my cramps make a comeback, big time, on Broadway. Standing Room Only. I almost welcomed having the leisure to do nothing but experience the agony, knowing what Ric would and could do to make me forget it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-26.html","bookId":2114,"book":{"id":2114,"title":"Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2)","description":"Storyline: Brimstone Kiss (Delilah Street #2) This book read like a first draft - maybe they just printed the wrong version?
