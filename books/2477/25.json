{"id":83382,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\"Lord have mercy!\" Dodge Creech peered out a cracked window at the pyramid. He was still wearing his yellow-and-blue-plaid sport coat, his red lick of hair damp with sweat and glued to his sparkling scalp. \"Ginger, I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you: if that thing had come down two hundred yards more north, we\u0027d be laying in our graves right now. How in hell am I gonna explain this to Mr. Brasswelli\" Ginger Creech thought about it. She was sitting in a rocking chair across the pine-paneled living room, wearing her plain blue robe, her feet in Dearfoam slippers and pink curlers in her graying hair. Her brow furrowed. \"act of God,\" she decided. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027ll tell him.\" \"act of God,\" he repeated, trying it out. \"No, he won\u0027t buy that! anyway, if it was a meteor or somethin\u0027 that fell without a mind to it, then it would be an act of God. If it\u0027s somethin\u0027 that\u0027s got a mind, you can\u0027t call it an act of God.\" Harv Brasswell was Creech\u0027s supervisor, based in Dallas, and he had a powerfully tight fist when it came to damage claims.\\n\\n \"You sayin\u0027 God doesn\u0027t have a mindi\" she inquired, her rocking coming to a halt.\\n\\n \"No, \u0027course not! It\u0027s just that an act of God has to be like a storm, or a drought, or somethin\u0027 only God could cause.\" That still sounded lame, and he didn\u0027t want to stir Ginger up; she was a PTL, ernest angsley, Kenneth Copeland, and Jimmy Swaggart fanatic. \"I don\u0027t think God had anythin\u0027 to do with this.\" The squeaking of her chair continued. The room was illuminated by three oil-burning lanterns that had been hung from the wagon-wheel light fixture at the ceiling. a couple of candles burned atop the television set. Bookshelves were packed with Reader\u0027s Digest Condensed Books, stacks of National Geographics, insurance law and motivational salesmanship books, as well as Ginger\u0027s collection of religious tomes.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet that thing threw every house in town off its foundations,\" Dodge fretted. \"I swear, ninety percent of the windows must be broken. Streets all cracked too. I never believed in spaceships before, but by God if that\u0027s not one, I don\u0027t know what is!\" \"I don\u0027t want to think about it,\" Ginger said, rocking harder. \"No such thing as spaceships.\" \"Well, it sure ain\u0027t the Big Rock Candy Mountain out there! Lord, what a mess!\" He rubbed the cool glass of iced tea he was holding across his forehead. The refrigerator had quit along with the power, of course, but the freezer unit still held a few trays of cubes. In this heat, though, they weren\u0027t going to last very long. \"That Colonel Rhodes is havin\u0027 a meetin\u0027 with the sheriff and Mayor Brett. Didn\u0027t ask me, though. Guess I\u0027m not important enough, huhi I can sell everybody in town their insurance and wait on \u0027em hand and foot, but I\u0027m not important enough. There\u0027s thanks for you!\" \"The meek shall inherit the earth,\" Ginger said, and he frowned because he didn\u0027t know what she was talking about and he didn\u0027t think she knew, either.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not meek!\" he told her. She just kept rocking. He heard the deep, rhythmic tolling of the bell at the Sacrifice of Christ Catholic Church across the river, calling the parishioners. \"Sounds like LaPrado\u0027s openin\u0027 up for business. Guess Reverend Jennings will too. It\u0027s gonna take more than church bells to keep folks - \" There was another sound, one that stopped him midsentence.\\n\\n It was a sharp, cracking noise: bricks being wrenched apart.\\n\\n Under my feet, Dodge Creech thought. Sounds like the basement floor\u0027s rippin\u0027 to - \"What\u0027s that noisei\" Ginger cried out, standing up. The rocking chair creaked on without her.\\n\\n The wooden floor trembled.\\n\\n Dodge looked at his wife. Her eyes were glassy and wide, her mouth open in a straining O. above their heads the wagon-wheel fixture shook, the oil lamps beginning to swing.\\n\\n Dodge said, \"I... think we\u0027re havin\u0027 an earthqu - \" The floor heaved upward, as if something huge had battered it from below. Nails leapt loose, glittering in the lamplight. Ginger staggered backward and fell, shrieking as Dodge toppled to his knees.\\n\\n She saw the floor split open underneath him with a scream of tortured wood, and her husband\u0027s body dropped into the seam up to his neck. Dust billowed around him and filled the room, but she could still see his face: chalky pale, eyes holes of shock. He was looking at her as she crawled away from the collapsing floor on her back.\\n\\n \"Somethin\u0027s got me,\" he said, and his voice was a thin, awful whine. \"Help me, Ginger. Please...\" He lifted his hand out of the hole for her, and what looked like gray snot was drooling from his fingers.\\n\\n Ginger wailed, curlers dangling from her hair.\\n\\n and then Dodge was gone, down the hole in the living-room floor. The house shook again, the walls moaning as if in pain at giving up their master. Plaster dust welled through cracks in the pinewood like ghost breath - and then there was silence but for the creakings of the rocking chair and the wagon-wheel fixture. One of the lamps had fallen and lay unbroken on the round red throw rug.\\n\\n Ginger Creech whispered, \"Dodgei\" She was shaking, tears running down her face and her bladder about to pop. Shouted it: \"Dodge!\" There was no answer, just the chuckling of water down below, running from a broken pipe. The water soon ran out, and the chuckling ceased.\\n\\n Ginger pushed herself toward the hole, her muscles sluggish as cold rubber bands. She had to look down it - did not want to, must not, should not - but she had to, because it had taken her husband. She reached the jagged edge and her stomach threatened eruption, so she had to squeeze her eyes shut and ride it out. The sickness passed, and she looked over into the hole.\\n\\n Just dark.\\n\\n She reached out for the oil lamp and turned up the wick. The flame guttered and rose to a knifelike orange point. She thrust the lamp down into the hole, her other hand gripping the splintered edge with white-knuckled fingers.\\n\\n Yellow dust sifted and stirred in small, cyclonic whorls. She was peering down into the basement eight feet below; and in the basement floor was another hole that looked - yes, she thought, oh Jesus son of God Holy Christ yes - gnawed through the concrete bricks. Beneath the basement floor lay more darkness.\\n\\n \"Dodgei\" she whispered, and it echoed Dodgei Dodgei Dodgei Her fingers spasmed; she lost the oil lamp, and it fell through the hole in the basement floor, kept falling, maybe ten or twenty more feet, finally shattered against red Texas dirt and the flames gouted as the rest of the oil caught. Down in that hole, Ginger could see the glimmering of ooze where something had dragged her husband to hell.\\n\\n Her senses left her altogether, and she lay trembling on the warped floor, her body drawn up in a tight fetal position. She decided to recite the Twenty-third Psalm seven times, because seven seemed like a holy number and if she recited loud enough and wished hard enough she would lift her head and see Dodge sitting in his easychair across the room, reading one of his motivational salesmanship books, and the TV set would be tuned to PTL and the thing that could not possibly be a spaceship would be gone. She began to recite, but she almost gagged with terror; she\u0027d forgotten the words.\\n\\n a church bell was ringing.\\n\\n It must be Sunday, she thought. Sunday morning, bright and new. She sat up, listening to the bell. What was that violet glow coming through the windowi Where was Dodge, and why was that hole - She had always loved the sound of a church bell, summoning her to worship. It was time to go now, and Dodge could come along later. and if he wore that red suit today, she\u0027d skin him, just skin him alive. She stood up, her eyes empty and tear tracks glistening through the dust on her face. She left the house, walked out of her Dearfoams, and kept going barefoot along Brazos Street.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-25.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
