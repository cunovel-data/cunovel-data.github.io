{"id":83363,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"Day of reckonin\u0027!\" Vance said as the patrol car sped east on Cobre Road. a belch rose from his gut like thunder. \"Yes sir, day of reckonin\u0027s comin\u0027 right soon!\" Celeste Preston was going to be out on her rear end before long. Miss High-and-Mighty was going to wish she could get a job swabbing spittoons at the Bob Wire Club, if he had anything to say about it.\n The car was moving past the remnants of the mine. Back in March, a couple of kids had climbed over the fence, gone down into the crater, and gotten themselves blown to flyspecks when they found some undetonated dynamite left in drill holes in the rock. In the mine\u0027s final weeks, the blasting had been as constant as doom\u0027s clockwork, and Vance figured more live sticks were probably down there, but nobody was dumb enough to go dig them out. What was the use, anywayi\n He reached to the dash and lifted the radio\u0027s microphone. \"Hey there, Danny boy! Come on back to me, heari\" The speaker crackled as Danny Chaffin responded. \"Yes, siri\" \"Get on the horn and call around to... uh, let\u0027s see here a minute.\" Vance flipped down the visor, took the county map that was clipped to it, and unfolded it on the seat beside him. He let the car have its own mind for a few seconds and it weaved toward the right shoulder, scaring the sense out of an armadillo. \"Call around to Rimrock and Presidio airstrips. ask \u0027em if they\u0027re flyin\u0027 any choppers this mornin\u0027. Prissy Preston\u0027s in an uproar \u0027cause her hair got mussed.\" \"Ten-four.\" \"Hold on,\" Vance added. \"Might as well go out of the county too. Call up to Midland and Big Spring airports. Hell, call Webb air Force Base too. That oughta do it.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"I\u0027m gonna take a swing through Bordertown and then I\u0027ll be on in. any more callsi\" \"No sir. Quiet as a whore in church.\" \"You got Whale Tail on your mind there, boyi Better quit drillin\u0027 that thang \u0027fore you fall in!\" Vance laughed. The idea of Danny getting it on with Sue \"Whale Tail\" Mullinax tickled him giddy. Whale Tail was about twice the kid\u0027s size; she was a waitress at the Brandin\u0027 Iron Cafe on Celeste Street, and he knew about ten guys who\u0027d dipped their wicks into her flame. So why not the boy tooi\n Danny didn\u0027t answer. Vance knew talking about Whale Tail like that got his goat, because Danny Chaffin was a moon-eyed kid, wet as oceans behind the ears, and didn\u0027t realize Whale Tail was stringing him along. He\u0027d learn. \"Check ya later, Danny boy,\" Vance said, and returned the mike to its cradle. Rocking Chair Ridge was coming up on the left, and along Cobre Road the houses and buildings of Inferno shimmered in the harsh light.\n It was too early for trouble in Bordertown, Vance knew. But then again, you never could tell what might set off those Mexicans. \"Hispanics,\" Vance muttered, and shook his head. They had brown skin, black eyes and hair, they lived on tortillas and enchiladas, and they jabbered south-of-the-border lingo; to Vance, that made them Mexicans, no matter where they\u0027d been born or what fancy name you called them. Mexicans, pure and simple.\n Nestled in its slot underneath the dashboard was a Remington pump shotgun, and beneath the passenger seat was a Louisville Slugger. That ole baseball bat was just made to bash wetback skulls, Vance mused. especially the skull of one smart-ass punk who thought he called the shots over there. Sooner or later, he knew, Mr. Louisville was going to meet Rick Jurado, and then - boom! - Jurado was going to be the first wetback in outer space.\n He drove past Preston Park to Republica Road, turned right at Xavier Mendoza\u0027s Texaco station, and headed across the Snake River bridge onto the dusty streets of Bordertown. He decided to drive over to the Jurado house, on Second Street, maybe sit in front and see if anything needed correcting.\n Because after all, Vance told himself, correcting was the sheriff\u0027s job. By this time next year he\u0027d no longer be a sheriff, so he might as well do as much correcting as he could. He winced at the thought of Celeste Preston ordering him around like a shoeshine boy, and he put his foot down on the accelerator.\n He stopped the car in front of a brown clapboard house on Second Street. Parked at the curb was the boy\u0027s banged-up black \u002778 Camaro, and along the street were other junkers that even Mack Cade wouldn\u0027t take. Laundry drooped on backyard lines and chickens pecked around some of the grassless yards. The land and houses belonged to a citizens\u0027 committee of Mexican-americans, and the nominal rent went back into the town\u0027s fund, but Vance was the law here as well as across the bridge. The houses, most of which dated from the early fifties, were clapboard and stucco structures that all looked to be in need of painting or repair, but the Bordertown fund couldn\u0027t keep up with the work. It was a shantytown, the narrow streets sifted with yellow dust and the hulks of old cars, washing machines and other junk standing around like the perpetual monuments of poverty. The majority of Bordertown\u0027s thousand or so inhabitants had labored at the copper mine, and when that shut down the skilled ones had gone elsewhere. The others held on desperately to what little they had.\n Two weeks ago, a couple of empty houses at the end of Third Street had caught fire, but the Inferno Volunteer Fire Department had kept the blaze from spreading. Scraps of gasoline-soaked rags had been found in the ashes. Just last weekend, Vance had broken up a fight between a dozen Renegades and Rattlesnakes in Preston Park. Things were heating up again, the same as last summer, but this time Vance meant to bottle up the trouble before any citizens of Inferno got hurt.\n He watched a red bantam rooster strutting across the street in front of his car. He hit the horn, and the rooster jumped up in the air and lost three feathers. \"Little bastard!\" Vance said, reaching into his breast pocket for his pack of Luckies.\n But before he got a cigarette out, he caught a movement from the corner of his eye. He looked to his right, at the Jurado house, and he saw the boy standing in the doorway.\n They stared at each other. Time ticked past. Then Vance\u0027s hand moved as if it had a wit of its own, and he pressed the horn again. The wail echoed along Second Street, stirring up the neighborhood dogs to a frenzy of barks and wails.\n The boy didn\u0027t move. He was wearing black jeans and a blue-striped short-sleeved shirt, and he was holding the screen door open with one arm. The other hung at his side, the fist clenched.\n Vance hit the horn once more, let it moan for about six long seconds. Now the dogs were really raising hell. a man peered from a doorway three houses up. Two children emerged onto the porch of another house and stood watching until a woman urged them back inside. as the noise died away, Vance heard the sound of shouted, Spanish cursing - all that lingo sounded like cursing to him - from a house across the street. and then the boy let the screen door shut as he came down the sagging porch steps to the curb. Come on, li\u0027l rooster! Vance thought. Come on, just start some trouble!\n The boy stopped right in front of the patrol car.\n He stood about five-nine, his brown arms muscular, his jet-black hair combed back from his forehead. against the dark bronze of his face his eyes were ebony - except they were the eyes of an old man who has seen too much, not the eyes of an eighteen-year-old. They held a cold rage - like that of a wild animal catching a hunter\u0027s scent. around both wrists he wore black leather bracelets studded with small squares of metal; his belt was also made of studded leather. He stared through the windshield at Sheriff Vance, and neither of them moved.\n Finally, the boy walked slowly around the car and stood several feet from Vance\u0027s open window. \"You got a problem, mani\" he asked, his voice a mixture of Mexico\u0027s stately cadence and west Texas\u0027s earthy snarl.\n \"I\u0027m on patrol,\" Vance answered.\n \"You patrollin\u0027 in front of my housei On my streeti\" Smiling thinly, Vance took off his sunglasses. His eyes were deep-set, light brown, and seemed too small for his face. \"I wanted to drive over and see you, Ricky. Wanted to say good mornin\u0027.\" \"Buenos dias. anythin\u0027 elsei I\u0027m gettin\u0027 ready for school.\" Vance nodded. \"Graduatin\u0027 senior, huhi Prob\u0027ly got your future all lined up, righti\" \"I\u0027ll make out okay.\" \"I\u0027ll bet you will. Prob\u0027ly wind up sellin\u0027 drugs on the street, is more like it. Good thing you\u0027re a real tough hombre, Ricky. You might even learn to enjoy prison life.\" \"If I get there first,\" Rick said, \"I\u0027ll make sure the fags know you\u0027re on your way.\" Vance\u0027s smile fractured. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean, smart-assi\" The boy shrugged, looking along Second Street at nothing in particular. \"You\u0027re gonna take a fall, man. Sooner or later, the state cops are gonna latch Cade, and you\u0027ll be next. \u0027Cept you\u0027ll be the one holdin\u0027 his shitbag, and he\u0027ll be long gone \u0027cross the border.\" He stared at Vance. \"Cade doesn\u0027t need a number two. aren\u0027t you smart enough to figure that out yeti\" Vance sat very still. His heart was beating hard, and rough memories were being stirred at the back of his brain. He couldn\u0027t stomach Rick Jurado - not only because Jurado was the leader of the Rattlesnakes, but on a deeper, more instinctive level. When Vance was a kid living in el Paso with his mother, he\u0027d had to walk home from grammar school across a dusty hellhole called Cortez Park. His mother worked at a laundry in the afternoons, and their house was only four blocks from school, but for him it was a nerve-twisting journey across a brutal no-man\u0027s-land. The Mexican kids hung out in Cortez Park, and there was a big eighth-grader named Luis who had the same black, fathomless eyes as Rick Jurado. eddie Vance had been fat and slow, and the Mexican kids could run like panthers; the awful day came when they\u0027d surrounded him, chattering and hollering, and when he\u0027d started crying that only made it worse. They\u0027d thrown him down and scattered his books while other gringo kids watched but were too scared to interfere; and the one named Luis had pulled his pants down, right off his struggling butt and legs, and then they\u0027d held him while Luis stripped off eddie\u0027s Fruit-of-the-Looms. The underpants had been wrapped around Vance\u0027s face like a feedbag, and as the half-naked fat boy ran home the Mexican kids had screamed with laughter and jeered, \"Burro! Burro! Burro!\" From then on, eddie Vance had walked more than a mile out of his way to avoid crossing Cortez Park, and in his mind he\u0027d murdered that Mexican boy named Luis a thousand times. and now here was Luis again, only this time his name was Rick Jurado. This time he was older, he spoke english better, and he was no doubt a lot smarter - but, though Vance was approaching his fifty-fourth birthday, the fat little boy inside him would\u0027ve recognized those cunning eyes anywhere. It was Luis all right, just wearing a different face.\n and the truth was that Vance had never met a Mexican who didn\u0027t remind him, in some way, of those jeering kids in Cortez Park almost forty years ago.\n \"What\u0027re you starin\u0027 at, mani\" Rick challenged. \"Have I got two headsi\" The sheriff\u0027s trance snapped. Rage flooded through him. \"I\u0027d just as soon get out of this car and break your neck, you little shit-ass wetback.\" \"You won\u0027t.\" But the boy\u0027s body had tensed for either flight or fight.\n Take it easy! Vance warned himself. He wasn\u0027t ready for this kind of trouble, not right here in the middle of Bordertown. He abruptly put his sunglasses back on and worked his knuckles. \"Some of your boys have been driftin\u0027 into Inferno after dark. That won\u0027t do, Ricky.\" \"Last I heard, it was a free country.\" \"It\u0027s free for americans.\" Though he knew Jurado had been bora at the Inferno Clinic on Celeste Street, Vance knew also that the boy\u0027s father and mother had been illegals. \"You let your gang punks go over - \" \"The Rattlers isn\u0027t a gang, man. It\u0027s a club.\" \"Yeah, right. You let your club punks go over the bridge after dark and there\u0027ll be trouble. I won\u0027t stand for it. I don\u0027t want any Rattler across the bridge at night. Do I make myself - \" \"Bullshit,\" Rick interrupted. He gestured angrily toward Inferno. \"What about the \u0027Gades, mani Do they own the fuckin\u0027 towni\" \"No. But your boys are askin\u0027 for a fight, lettin\u0027 themselves be seen where they shouldn\u0027t be. I want it to stop.\" \"It\u0027ll stop,\" Rick said. \"When the \u0027Gades stop makin\u0027 raids over here, breakin\u0027 out people\u0027s windows and spray-paintin\u0027 their cars. They raise hell on my streets, and we\u0027re not even supposed to cross the bridge without gettin\u0027 spanked! What about that firei How come Lockett\u0027s not in jaili\" \"Because there\u0027s no proof he or any of the Renegades set it. all we\u0027ve got are a few bits of burned-up rags.\" \"Man, you know they set it!\" Rick shouted. \"They could\u0027ve burned down the whole town!\" He shook his head disgustedly. \"You\u0027re a chickenshit, Vance! Big sheriff, huhi Well, you listen up! My men are watchin\u0027 the streets at night, and I swear to God we\u0027ll cut the balls off any \u0027Gade we catch! Comprendei\" anger reddened Vance\u0027s cheeks. He was looking into the face of Luis again, and standing on the battlefield of Cortez Park. Deep down, his stomach was squeezed with a fat kid\u0027s fear. \"I don\u0027t think I like your tone of voice, boy! I\u0027ll take care of the Renegades! You just keep your punks on this side of the bridge after dark, you got iti\" Rick Jurado suddenly walked a few feet away, bent down, and picked something up. Vance saw it was the red rooster. The Mexican boy approached the car, held the rooster over the windshield, and gave a quick, strong squeeze with his hands. The rooster squawked and flapped, and a grayish-white blob fell from its rear end onto the windshield and oozed down the glass.\n \"There\u0027s my answer,\" the boy said defiantly. \"Chickenshit for a chickenshit.\" Vance was out of the car before the white line reached the hood. Rick took two strides back, dropped the rooster, and tensed himself to meet the onrushing storm. The rooster let out a strangled crowing as it darted for the cover of a yucca bush.\n even as he knew he was touching a match to dynamite, Vance reached out to grab the boy\u0027s collar; but Rick was way too fast for him, and easily dodged aside. Vance clutched at empty air, and again the vision of Luis and Cortez Park whirled around him. He bellowed with fury, drawing his fist back to strike at his tormentor.\n But before the blow could fall, a screen door slammed and a boy\u0027s voice called out in Spanish, \"Hey, Ricardo! You need some helpi\" The voice was followed immediately by a sharp crack! that froze the sheriff\u0027s fist in midair.\n He looked across the street, where a rail-thin Mexican kid wearing chinos, combat boots, and a black T-shirt stood on the front steps of a rundown house. \"You need some help, mani\" he asked again, this time in english, and then he reared his right hand back and quickly snapped it forward in a smooth, blurred motion.\n The bullwhip he was holding popped like a firecracker going off, its tip flicking up a cigarette butt from the gutter. Shreds of tobacco whirled.\n The moment stretched. Rick Jurado watched Vance\u0027s face, could see the rage and cowardice fighting on it; then he saw Vance blink, and he knew which had won. The sheriff\u0027s fist opened. His arm came down to his side, and he clasped it like a broken wing.\n \"No, Zarra,\" Rick said, his voice calm now. \"everythin\u0027s steady, man.\" \"Jus\u0027 checkin\u0027.\" Carlos \"Zarra\" alhambra wrapped the bullwhip around his right arm and sat on the porch steps, his gangly legs stretched out before him.\n Vance saw two more Mexican boys walking in his direction along Second Street. Down where the street dead-ended in a tangle of boulders and sagebrush, another boy stood at the curb, watching the sheriff. In his hand was a tire iron.\n \"You got anythin\u0027 else to sayi\" Rick prodded.\n Vance sensed the many eyes on him from the windows of the crummy houses. He knew there was no way to win here; all Bordertown was a big Cortez Park. Vance glanced uneasily at the punk with the bullwhip, knowing that Zarra alhambra could snap out a lizard\u0027s eyeballs with that damned thing. He pointed a thick finger into Rick\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m warnin\u0027 you! No Rattlers in Inferno after dark, you heari\" \"ehi\" Rick cupped a hand behind his ear.\n across the street, Zarra laughed. \"You remember!\" Vance said, and then he got into the patrol car. \"You remember, smart-ass!\" he shouted once the door was shut. The streak down his windshield infuriated him, and he switched on the wipers. The streak became a smear. His face burned as their laughter reached him. He put the car in reverse and backed rapidly along Second Street to Republica Road, swerved the car around, and roared over the bridge into Inferno.\n \"Big lawman!\" Zarra hooted. He stood up. \"I shoulda popped his fat butt, huhi\" \"Not this time.\" Rick\u0027s heartbeat was slowing down now; it had been racing during his confrontation with Vance, but he hadn\u0027t dared show even a shadow of fear. \"Next time you can pop him real good. You can bust his balls.\" \"alllllright! Wreckage, man!\" Zarra thrust his left fist up in a power salute, the symbol of the Rattlesnakes.\n \"Wreckage.\" Rick returned the salute halfheartedly. He saw Chico Magellas and Petey Gomez approaching, jaunty and strutting as if they walked on a street of gold instead of cracked concrete, on their way to the corner to catch the school bus. \"Later,\" he told Zarra, and he went back up the steps into the brown house.\n Inside, drawn shades cut the sunlight. The gray wallpaper was faded beige where the sun had burned it, and on the walls hung framed paintings of Jesus against black velvet backgrounds. The house smelled of onions, tortillas, and beans. Floorboards creaked as if in pain under Rick\u0027s footsteps. He walked through a short hallway to a door near the kitchen and tapped lightly on it. There was no answer. He waited a few seconds and tapped again, much louder.\n \"I\u0027m awake, Ricardo,\" the feeble voice of an old woman replied in Spanish.\n Rick had been holding his breath. Now he let it go. One morning, he knew, he was going to come to this door and knock, and there would be no answer. But not this morning. He opened the door and looked into the small bedroom, where the shades were drawn and an electric fan stirred the heavy air. In this room there was an odor like violets on the edge of decay.\n Under the sheet on the bed lay the thin figure of an elderly woman, her white hair spread like a lace fan on the pillow, her brown face a mass of deep cracks and wrinkles.\n \"I\u0027m leaving for school, Paloma.\" Rick\u0027s voice was gentle and articulate now, very much different from the street inflections of a moment before. \"Can I get you anythingi\" \"No, gracias. \" The old woman slowly sat up and tried to adjust her pillow with a skinny hand, but Rick was quickly there to help. \"are you working todayi\" she asked.\n \"Si. I\u0027ll be home about six.\" He worked three afternoons a week at the Inferno Hardware Store, and would have worked longer hours if Mr. Luttrell let him. But jobs were hard to come by, and his grandmother needed to be watched over. Someone from the volunteer committee at the church brought her a boxed lunch every day, Mrs. Ramirez from next door came over to check on her from time to time and Father LaPrado often stopped by, but Rick didn\u0027t like leaving her alone so much. at school, he was tormented by the fear that she might fall and break her hip or back, and lie suffering in this awful house until he came home. But they had to have the money from his stockboy job, and that was all there was to it.\n \"What was that noise I heardi\" she asked. \"a horn blowing. It woke me up.\" \"Nothing. Just somebody passing by.\" \"I heard shouting. There\u0027s too much noise on this street. Too much trouble. Someday we\u0027ll live on a quiet street, won\u0027t wei\" \"We will,\" he replied, and he stroked his grandmother\u0027s thin white hair with the same hand that had delivered a power salute.\n She reached up, grasping his hand. \"You be a good boy today, Ricardo. You do good at school, sii\" \"I\u0027ll try.\" He looked into her face. The cataracts on her eyes were pale gray, and she could hardly see at all. She was seventy-one years old, had fought off the effects of two minor strokes, and still had most of her own teeth. Her hair had turned white at an early age, and that was where her name - Paloma, the dove - came from. Her real name was peasant Mexican, almost unpronounceable even to his tongue. \"I want you to be careful today,\" he said. \"Do you want the shades upi\" She shook her head. \"Too bright. But I\u0027ll be fine when I have my operation. Then I\u0027ll see everything - better than you, even!\" \"You already see everything better than me.\" He bent over and kissed her forehead. again he caught that odor of decaying violets.\n Her fingers found one of the leather bracelets. \"These things againi Why do you wear these thingsi\" \"No reason. It\u0027s just the style.\" He pulled his hand away.\n \"The style. Si.\" Paloma smiled faintly. \"and who sets that style, Ricardoi Probably somebody you don\u0027t know and wouldn\u0027t like anyway.\" She tapped her skull. \"You use this. You live your own style, not somebody else\u0027s.\" \"It\u0027s hard to do.\" \"I know. But that\u0027s how you become your own man, instead of an echo.\" Paloma turned her head toward the window. The harsh edges of light that crept around the shade made her head ache. \"Your mother... now she\u0027s the stylish one,\" Paloma said softly.\n Rick was caught off guard. It had been a long time since Paloma had mentioned his mother. He waited, but she said nothing else. \"It\u0027s almost eight. I\u0027d better go.\" \"Yes. You\u0027d better go on. You don\u0027t want to be late, Mr. Senior.\" \"I\u0027ll be home at six,\" he told her, and then he went to the door; but before he left the room he glanced quickly back at the frail form on the bed and he said, as he did every morning before he went to school, \"I love you.\" and she answered, as she always did, \"Double love back to you.\" Rick closed the bedroom door behind him. as he walked through the hallway again, he realized that his grandmother\u0027s wish of double love had been enough for him when he was a child; but beyond this house, out in the world where the sun beat down like a sledgehammer and mercy was a coward\u0027s word, a wish of double love from a dying old woman would not protect him.\n every step he took brought a subtle change to his face. His eyes lost their softness, took on a hard, cold glare. His mouth tightened, became a grim and bitter line. He stopped before he reached the door and plucked a white fedora with a snakeskin band from its wall hook. He put the hat on before a discolored mirror, tilting it to the proper angle of cool. Then he slid his hand into his jeans pocket and felt the silver switchblade there. Its handle was of green jade and had an embedded cameo of Jesus Christ, and Rick recalled the day he\u0027d snatched that blade - the Fang of Jesus - out of a box where a rattler lay coiled.\n He had the mean, ass-kicking look in his eyes now, and he was ready to go.\n Once he stepped through that door, the Rick Jurado who cared for his Paloma would be left behind, and the Rick Jurado who was president of the Rattlesnakes would emerge. She had never seen that face, and sometimes he was thankful for the cataracts - but that was how it had to be, if he wanted to survive against Lockett and the Renegades. He dared not let the mask fall, but sometimes he forgot which was the mask and which was the man.\n He drew in a deep breath and left the house. Zarra was waiting by the car and flipped him a freshly rolled joint. Rick caught it, tucking it away for later. Being wrecked - or at least pretending to be - was the only way to get through the day.\n Rick slid behind the wheel. Zarra got into the passenger side, and the Camaro\u0027s engine thundered as Rick turned the key. He put on a pair of black-framed sunglasses and, his transformation complete, he drove away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-6.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
