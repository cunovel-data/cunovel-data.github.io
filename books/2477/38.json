{"id":83395,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\"Set \u0027em up again, Jacky!\" Curt Lockett banged his fist on the rough-topped bar. The bartender, a stocky gray-bearded man named Jack Blair, looked at him from down the bar where he was talking to Harlan Nugent and Pete Griffin. The light of kerosene lanterns hung in Jack\u0027s round eyeglasses, and above the lenses his brows were as shaggy as caterpillars. \"almost a half bottle gone, Curt,\" Jack said in a voice like a bulldozer\u0027s growl. \"Maybe you ought to pack up your tent.\" \"Hell, I wish I could!\" Curt replied. \"Wish I could pack up and light out of this shithole and by God I wouldn\u0027t never look back!\" He pounded the bar again. \"Come on, Jacky! Don\u0027t cut your ole buddy off yet!\" Jack glared at him for a few seconds. He knew how Curt acted with more than a half bottle lighting his wick. Over at a table, Hal McCutchins and Burl Keene were smoking cigarettes and talking, and others had come and gone. The one thing everybody in the Bob Wire Club had in common was that they had nowhere else in particular to go, no wives waiting for them, nothing to do but kill some time drinking at one-fifteen in the morning. Jack didn\u0027t care much for Curt Lockett, but the man was a steady customer. He came down the bar, opened the half-drained bottle of Kentucky Gent - the cheapest brand in the house - and poured him another shotglass full. When Jack started to draw it away, Curt gripped the bottle\u0027s neck in a lockhold. \"Mighty thirsty,\" Curt said. \"Mighty, mighty thirsty.\" \"Keep the fucker, then,\" Jack said, giving in to the inevitable. \"Yessir, I seen it!\" Pete Griffin went on with what he\u0027d been saying. He was a leathery cowboy with blue eyes sunken in a wrinkled, sunbaked face. \"Damn thing\u0027s blockin\u0027 the highway \u0027bout five miles north.\" He swigged from his lukewarm bottle of Lone Star beer. \"I was about to hit the pedal and try to tear ol\u0027 Betsy right through it, and then I seen somethin\u0027 else.\" He paused for another drink. Ol\u0027 Betsy was his rust-eaten red pickup truck, parked in the sandy lot out front. \"What\u0027d you seei\" Jack prodded. \"Dead things,\" Pete said. \"I got out and took me a closer look. There was burned-up rabbits and a couple of dead dogs lyin\u0027 right where the thing went into the ground. You can see through it, and it don\u0027t look as sturdy as a spiderweb, but... well, I seen somethin\u0027 on the other side too. Looked to have been a truck, maybe. It was still smokin\u0027. So I got in ol\u0027 Betsy and decided to mosey back thisaway.\" \"and I\u0027m sayin\u0027 ain\u0027t such a thing possible,\" Harlan contended, his voice slurred from four boilermakers. \"Cain\u0027t such a thing be solid!\" \"It is, by God! Hell, my eyes ain\u0027t gone yet! That thing\u0027s solid as a stone wall and it burned them animals up too!\" Curt laughed harshly. \"Griffin, you\u0027re crazy as a three-legged toadfrog. You cain\u0027t see through anythin\u0027 solid. I\u0027m dumb as a board, and even I know that!\" \"You drive on up there and try to get through it, then!\" Pete\u0027s face bristled with indignant anger. \"I\u0027ll come along behind and sweep up your ashes - not that that boy of yours would want \u0027em!\" \"Yeah!\" Harlan gave a dry chuckle. \"We\u0027ll put them ashes in a whiskey bottle for you, Curt. That way you can rest in peace.\" \"Rest pickled is more like it,\" Jack said. \"Curt, why don\u0027t you go on homei Don\u0027t you care about your boyi\" \"Cody can take care of himself. always has before.\" Curt swigged down the whiskey. He was feeling okay now. His nerves had steadied, but he was sweating too much to get drunk. The Bob Wire Club was stiflingly hot without power to run the fans, and Curt\u0027s shirt was plastered to his skin. \"He don\u0027t need me, and I sure as hell don\u0027t need him.\" \"If I had a family, I\u0027d sure be with \u0027em at a time like this.\" Out of habit, Jack took a rag and cleaned the bartop. He lived alone in a trailer behind the Bob Wire Club, and he\u0027d kept the place open after the electricity had gone out because he couldn\u0027t have slept anyway. \"Seems only right a father ought to be with his boy.\" \"Yeah, and a wife ought to be with her husband too!\" Curt snapped. It had come out of him before he\u0027d had time to check it. The others stared at him, and he shrugged and sipped from the bottle. \"Just forget it,\" he said. \"Cody ain\u0027t a kid no more.\" \"Well, still don\u0027t seem right,\" Jack continued, following the swirls of his rag. \"Not with that damn bastard sittin\u0027 across the river and all hell breakin\u0027 loose.\" \"I hear there\u0027s an air-force colonel in town,\" Hal McCutchins said. \"He was in the chopper that went down, but he got out okay. Sumbitch flew out of that pyramid and knocked it down like it was made out of paper!\" \"Thing\u0027s a spaceship.\" Burl Keene, his bulging belly quivering against the table\u0027s edge, reached for a handful of peanuts from a bowl. \"That\u0027s the talk. Thing\u0027s come from Mars.\" \"ain\u0027t nobody on Mars.\" Jack stopped cleaning. \"The scientists proved that. No, that thing\u0027s come from somewhere a long ways off.\" \"Scientists don\u0027t know nothin\u0027,\" Burl countered, chomping on peanuts. \"Hell, they don\u0027t even believe there was a Garden of eden!\" \"Mars is nothin\u0027 but rocks! They took pictures on Mars and that\u0027s all you can see!\" Curt scowled and tipped the bottle to his mouth again. Whether the black pyramid had brought invaders from Mars or cat people from Pluto didn\u0027t matter much to him; as long as they left him alone, he didn\u0027t care. He listened as Jack and Burl went on about Mars, but his mind was on Cody. Maybe he ought to find out if the boy was all right. Maybe he was a fool for sitting here thinking that Cody could handle himself in every kind of jam. No, he decided in the next second, Cody was better off on his own. The boy was a damn idjit sometimes, but he was tough as nails and he could make do. Besides, he was probably up at the apartments with that gang of his. They all hung thick as thieves and took care of each other, so what was there to worry abouti Besides, rough treatment was good for Cody. That made a boy into a man. It was the way Curt\u0027s father had raised him, bullying and beating. Cody would be stronger for it. Yeah, Curt thought. His knuckles bleached around the bottle\u0027s neck. Strong, just like his old man. He couldn\u0027t remember the last time he\u0027d talked to Cody without blowing his top. Maybe it was because he didn\u0027t know how to, he thought. But the kid was so headstrong and wild, nobody could get through to him. Cody walked his own path, right or wrong. But sometimes Curt thought he saw Treasure in Cody\u0027s face, clear as day, and his heart ached as if it had been kicked. There was no use in thinking these thoughts. Nothing good came out of them, and they made Curt\u0027s head hurt. He looked into the amber bottle, at the liquid that lay within, and he smiled as if seeing an old friend. But there was a sadness in his smile, because full bottles always ran empty. \"Maybe they\u0027ve got caves,\" Burl Keene was saying. \"Under Mars. Maybe they just went into their caves when the pictures got took.\" Curt was about to tell him to stop shoveling the horseshit when he heard the bottles clink together on the shelves behind the bar. It was not a loud sound, and neither Jack nor Burl stopped their jabbering. But Curt had heard it clearly enough, and in another few seconds he heard them clink again. He set his own bottle on the bar and saw a tremor on the whiskey\u0027s surface. \"Jacki\" he said. Blair paid no attention. \"Hey, Jack!\" Curt said, louder. Jack looked at him, fed up with Curt Lockett. \"What is iti\" \"I think we\u0027re havin\u0027 a - \" The Bob Wire Club\u0027s floor suddenly buckled upward, timbers squealing as they snapped. The two pool tables jumped a foot in the air, and billiard balls were flung out of their racks. Bottles and glasses crashed down behind the bar. Jack was knocked off his feet, and Curt\u0027s barstool went over. He landed on his back on the floor, and under him he could feel the boards pitching and heaving like a bronco\u0027s shoulder blades. The floor\u0027s motion eased, then stopped. Curt sat up, stunned, and in the lamplight saw a horrible thing: the last of the Kentucky Gent spilling from the overturned bottle. Harlan and Pete were on the floor too, and Burl was coughing up peanuts. Harlan got to his knees and shouted, \"What hit usi\" There was a bang like a sledgehammer on wood. Curt heard the squall of nails popping loose. \"Over there!\" He pointed, and all of them saw it: about ten feet away, a board was being knocked upward from the floor. The second blow sent it flying up to hit the ceiling, and Curt caught sight of a slim human hand and arm reaching through the cavity. another timber was knocked loose, then the fingers of that hand gripped the edge of a third board and wrenched it down. Now there was a gap large enough for a person to crawl through, and about three seconds later a figure began to emerge from the floor. \"Holy Jesus and Mary,\" Jack whispered, standing up behind the bar with sawdust in his beard. The figure got its head and shoulders through, then worked its hips free. a long pair of bare legs pulled out, and the figure rose to its feet. It was a slender and pretty blond girl, maybe sixteen years old, wearing nothing but a lacy bra and a pair of pink panties with \"Friday\" stitched across the front. She stretched to her full height, her ribs showing under her pale skin and her hair shining wetly in the lamplight. Her face was as calm as if she came up through barroom floors every night of her life, and her gaze went from one man to the next with cold attention. \"I\u0027m dead,\" Burl gasped. \"I\u0027ve gotta be dead.\" Curt tried to stand up, but his legs weren\u0027t ready. He knew who she was: her name was Laurie Rainey, and she worked afternoons at the Paperback Kastle near the bakery and came in sometimes for grape jelly doughnuts. She was a pretty thing, and he liked to watch her chew. He tried to stand again, and this time he made it all the way up. She spoke. \"Ya\u0027ll are gonna tell me about the little girl,\" she said, in a thick whangy Texas accent with a rattling metallic undertone. Her skin gleamed, as if she were coated with grease. \"Ya\u0027ll are gonna tell me right now.\" None of the men spoke, and no one moved. Laurie Rainey looked around, her head slowly racheting as if her neck and spine were connected by gear wheels. \"The little girl,\" Jack repeated dumbly. \"What little girli\" \"The one who\u0027s the guardian.\" Her eyes found him, and Jack had the sensation of peering into a snakepit. There were things slithering around in there that he would not care to know. \"Ya\u0027ll are gonna tell me, or I\u0027m done bein\u0027 nice.\" \"Laurie...\" Curt\u0027s mind stuttered like a blown-out engine. \"What were you doin\u0027 under the floori\" \"Laurie.\" The girl\u0027s head notched toward him. \"Is that the guardian\u0027s namei\" \"No. It\u0027s your name. Christ, don\u0027t you know your own namei\" The girl didn\u0027t reply. She blinked slowly, processing the information, and her mouth tightened into an angry line. \"What we have here,\" she said, \"is a failure to communicate.\" She turned to her left, walked about three strides to the nearest pool table, and placed her hands under its edge. With a quick, blurred motion, she flipped her hands forward and the pool table upended as if it had the weight of a corn husk. It came off the floor and crashed through the Bob Wire Club\u0027s front window into the parking lot, throwing glass all over Curt\u0027s Buick and Pete Griffin\u0027s pickup truck. She strode purposefully to the second pool table, balled up her right fist, and smashed it through the green felt covering. Then she picked up one end of the table and flipped it across the barroom into a couple of pinball machines. all the men could do was gawk, openmouthed, and Jack Blair almost fainted because he knew it took three men to lift those pool tables. The girl\u0027s head racheted, surveying the destruction. There was no damage to her hand, and she wasn\u0027t even breathing hard. She turned toward the men. \"Now we\u0027ll have us a nice little talk,\" she said. Burl Keene yelped like a whipped dog and scrambled for the door, but he was way too slow. The girl leapt forward and was on him even as he reached for the knob. She caught his wrist and twisted it sharply. Bones popped, and their jagged edges ripped through the meat at Burl\u0027s elbow. He screamed, still thrashing to get out the door, and she wrenched at his broken arm and chopped a blow at his face with the edge of her free hand. Burl\u0027s nose exploded, and his teeth went down his throat. He fell to his knees, blood streaming down his mangled face. Jack reached beside the cash register and pulled his shotgun from its socket. The girl was turning toward him as he cocked the gun and lifted it. He didn\u0027t know what kind of monster she was, but he didn\u0027t plan on sharing Burl\u0027s fate. He squeezed the trigger. The shotgun boomed and bucked. a fist-sized hole appeared in the girl\u0027s belly, just above the panty line, and bits of flesh and gray tissue exploded from her back. She was knocked off her feet, her body slamming against the wall. She went down, trailing gray slime. \"God a\u0027mighty!\" Curt shouted in the silence after the blast. \"You done killed her!\" Hal McCutchins picked up a cue stick and prodded the twitching body. Something writhed in the belly wound like a mass of knotted-up worms. \"Lord,\" he said in a choked voice. \"You blew the hell out of - \" She sat up. Before Hal could jump back, the girl grabbed the cue stick and pulled it from his hands so fast his palms were scorched. She hit him across the knees with the heavy end of it, and as his kneecaps shattered Hal fell on his face. She stood up, her belly oozing and a malignant grin stretching her mouth. Red lamplight glinted off a mouthful of needles. \"Ya\u0027ll want to play roughi\" the rattling voice asked. \"Okey-dokey.\" She slammed the stick\u0027s blunt end down on Hal McCutchins\u0027s head. The stick snapped in two, and Hal\u0027s skull broke open like a blister. His legs kicked in a dance of death, his brains exposed to the light. \"Shoot it!\" Curt screamed, but Jack\u0027s finger was already pulling the trigger again. The creature was hit in the side, spun around, and flung backward. a gray mist hung in the air, and Curt screeched because there was sticky wet matter on his shirt and arms. The creature fell over a table but righted herself and did not go to the floor. In the wound her ribs looked to be fashioned from blue-tinged metal, but a thorny coil of red intestines protruded from the hole. She advanced toward the bar with the splintered piece of cue stick in her hand. Jack fumbled to shove another shell into the breech. Curt scrabbled on his hands and knees for cover under a table, and Harlan and Pete had mashed themselves against a wall like bugs trapped to a screen. Jack cocked the shotgun and lifted it to fire. as he did, the creature hurled the cue stick like a javelin. Its sharp end penetrated Jack\u0027s throat and emerged from the back of his neck in a bloody spray, and Jack\u0027s finger twitched on the trigger. The buckshot tore the right side of the monster\u0027s face off, peeled away gray tissue and red muscle right down to the blue metallic cheek and jawbone. Her eye on that side rolled back to show the white. Jack clawed at his throat, strangling, and fell behind the bar. \"Get away! Get away!\" Pete was shouting hysterically, but Harlan picked up a chair and flung it at the creature. The thing shrugged off the object and charged at him, gripping both hands around his neck and picking him up off the floor. She twisted his head as easily as a chicken\u0027s, and Harlan\u0027s face turned blue just before his neck snapped. Pete fell to his knees, his hands upraised for mercy. \"Please... oh God, don\u0027t kill me!\" he begged. \"Please don\u0027t kill me!\" She tossed Harlan Nugent aside like an old sack and gazed down into Pete\u0027s eyes. She smiled, fluid running from the wound in her face, and then she gripped Pete\u0027s wrists, put her foot against his chest, and yanked. Both arms ripped out of their sockets. The jittering torso collapsed, Pete\u0027s mouth still working but only a whisper of shock coming out. Under the table, Curt tasted blood. He\u0027d bitten his tongue to keep from screaming, and now he felt a darkness pulling at his mind like a deep, beckoning current. He watched as the creature held Pete Griffin\u0027s disembodied arms before her, as if studying the anatomy. Pete\u0027s fingers still clenched and relaxed, and blood pattered to the boards like a rainstorm. I\u0027m next, Curt thought. God help me, I\u0027m next. He had two choices: stay here or make a run for it. It wasn\u0027t much of a choice. He thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out his car keys. They jingled, and he saw the monster\u0027s head rotate around on its neck at an impossible angle so that the face was where the back of the head ought to be. The single, inflamed eye found him. Curt shot out from under the table and raced for the broken window. He heard two thumps as she dropped Pete\u0027s arms, then the crash of a table going over. The thing was leaping after him. He jumped through the window like diving into a hoop, hit the ground on his hands and knees, and crawled madly toward the Buick. a hand caught the back of his shirt, and he knew she was right there with him. He didn\u0027t think. He just did. His left hand gripped sand, and he twisted around and flung it into Laurie Rainey\u0027s savage, ruined face. Her eye blinded, she tore the shirt off his back and swiped at him with her other hand. He ducked, saw the glint of little saw blades as her fingers flashed past his face. Curt kicked out at her, hit her in the breastbone, and pulled his leg back before she could grab it. Then he was up and running, and he reached his car and slid behind the wheel, his fingers jamming the key home. The engine made that knocking noise like it did every time it didn\u0027t want to start, only this time it sounded like a fist on a coffin\u0027s lid. Curt roared, \"Start, damn you!\" and sank his foot to the floorboard. The tailpipe belched dark smoke, the engine\u0027s muttering turned into a growl, and the Buick jerked in reverse. But not fast enough: Curt saw the creature racing after him, coming like an Olympic sprinter across the Bob Wire Club\u0027s lot. He battled the wheel as the tires hit Highway 67\u0027s pavement, trying to get the car turned in the direction of Inferno. But the monster was almost to the car, and he forced the gearshift into first and shot forward to run her over. She jumped just before the Buick hit her, grabbing hold of the roof\u0027s edge and scuttling up onto it on her belly. He swerved the car, trying to throw her off. She held on, and Curt laid on the accelerator. He turned on the headlights; in the green glow of the dashboard the speedometer needle edged past forty. He realized he was going north instead of south but he was too scared to do anything but keep his foot on the pedal. at fifty the vibration of the bald tires all but jerked the wheel out of his hands, and at sixty the old engine was wheezing at the gaskets. Something slammed down over his head and a blister of metal bloomed in the roof. Her fist, he thought. She was trying to beat through the roof. another slam, and a second blister grew beside the first. Her hand crept into the car, fingers wrenching at the roof\u0027s joints. Screws popped loose. There was a shriek of rusted metal; she was bending the roof back like the lid of a sardine can. a crack zigzagged across the windshield. Screaming at its limits, the engine hit seventy miles an hour and rocketed Curt along Highway 67.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-38.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
