{"id":83373,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"at the moment Daufin was trying to learn the nuances of english, Cody Lockett was operating the hydraulic lift in a garage stall of Xavier Mendoza\u0027s gas station, cranking up a Ford that needed new brake drums. He was wearing old, faded jeans and an olive-green workshirt that had his name beneath the Texaco star; his hands were greasy, his face streaked with grime, and he knew he was a long way from resembling the well-scrubbed gas jockeys in TV commercials, but staying clean didn\u0027t get the job done. In the last hour, he\u0027d changed the oil in two cars and the spark plugs and points in a third. The garage was his territory, its tools hanging in orderly rows on the walls and gleaming like surgical instruments, a rack of tires giving off the smell of fresh rubber and an assortment of cables, radiator belts, and hoses hanging from the metal beams overhead. The garage door had been hoisted up and a big box fan kept the air circulating, but it was still plenty hot anywhere chrome reflected the sunlight and engines were continually turned over.\n Cody got the lift as high as he wanted and locked it in place. He plugged in the electric gun that unscrewed lug nuts and began to take the tires off. Working here helped him forget about the old man. There was more than enough to keep him busy today - including hoisting out the destroyed engine of that sea-green pickup in the next stall - and sometime this afternoon he wanted to find time to tinker with his motorcycle\u0027s carb and smooth out the kinks.\n The signal bell rang as a car pulled up to the pumps outside, but he knew Mr. Mendoza would take care of the gas customers. Sonny Crowfield had knocked off just before Cody came in for work - which was just as well, since Cody couldn\u0027t stand him; Crowfield, in Cody\u0027s opinion, was a crazy half-breed and a Rattler to boot, always talking shit about how he was going to someday stomp Jurado and become president. From what Cody heard, even the Rattlers didn\u0027t have much to do with Crowfield, who lived on the edge of the autoyard, all alone except for a collection of animal skeletons - and where and how he got those bones, no one knew.\n a car horn honked. Cody looked up from his work.\n at the pumps sat a silver-blue Mercedes convertible, its paint glossed to a high shine. Behind the wheel was a man wearing sunglasses and a straw Panama hat. He lifted a hand in a brown leather driving glove, motioning for Cody to come out. In the seat beside him was a husky Doberman, and another one crouched in the backseat. Mendoza emerged from his office and went around to speak to the driver. Cody returned to his job - but the Mercedes\u0027s horn rapped out an impatient tattoo.\n Mack Cade was as persistent as a tick. Cody knew what he wanted. The horn honked again, though Mendoza was standing right there trying to tell Cade that Cody had work to do. Mack Cade was paying him zero attention. Cody said, \"Shit!\" under his breath, put aside the lug-nut gun, and wiped his hands off on a rag, taking his time about it; then he walked out into the glary sunlight.\n \"Fill \u0027er up, Cody!\" Mack Cade said. \"You know what she drinks.\" \"You\u0027ve got garage work to do, Cody!\" Mr. Mendoza told him, trying his best to cover for the boy - because he, too, knew Cade\u0027s game. \"You don\u0027t have to come out and pump the gas!\" His eyes were black and fearsome, and with his silver hair and bushy silver mustache he resembled an aged grizzly ready for a final tooth-and-claw battle; if those damned dogs weren\u0027t there he might have snatched Cade out of that fancy car and beaten him bloody.\n \"Hey, I\u0027m particular about who touches my car.\" Cade\u0027s voice was a silky-smooth drawl; he was used to being obeyed. He smiled at Mendoza, showing a line of small white teeth in his deeply burnished face. \"Bad vibes round here, man. You\u0027ve got a real dark karma.\" \"I don\u0027t need your business, or your bullshit either!\" Mendoza\u0027s shout made Typhoid, the dog in the passenger seat, stiffen and snarl. The dog in the rear, whose name was Lockjaw, was frozen and staring, his single ear laid back along his skull; that and the fact that Typhoid was a little larger through the shoulders was the only difference between the two animals.\n \"You sure about thati I can bring in my own gas trucks, if you want.\" \"Yeah, maybe that\u0027d be just fi - \" \"Hold it,\" Cody interrupted. \"You don\u0027t need to be my watchdog,\" he said to Mendoza. \"I can look out for myself.\" He walked to the diesel pump, withdrew the hose, and primed the numbers back to zero.\n \"Let\u0027s give peace a chance, Mendoza,\" Cade said as Cody started feeding the fuel in. \"Okayi\" Mendoza snorted angrily and glanced at Cody; the boy nodded that everything was under control. Mendoza said, \"I\u0027ll be in my office. You don\u0027t take no shit from him, understandi\" He turned on his heel and strode away, and Cade revved up the volume on his tape deck. Tina Turner\u0027s raspy voice thundered, \"Better be good to me!\" \"You can clean the windshield, too,\" Cade told Cody as soon as Mendoza was in the office.\n Cody went to work with the squeegee; he could see a distorted image of himself in the reflective lenses of the man\u0027s sunglasses. Cade\u0027s hat was held on by a leather chinstrap, he wore a silk short-sleeved shirt the color of sangria, and tie-dyed jeans. around his neck dangled a few golden chains, among them one with an old peace sign on it, and one of those small gold ingots with foreign words. On his left wrist was a Rolex watch with diamonds set in its dial, and on the right was a gold bracelet with \"Mack\" engraved in it. Both of the Dobermans were watching with keen interest as Cody\u0027s squeegee went back and forth over the glass.\n Cade lowered the music. \"Guess you heard about the meteor. Far out, huhi\" Cody didn\u0027t reply. Of course he\u0027d seen the helicopter sitting in Preston Park, but he hadn\u0027t known what was going on until Mr. Mendoza had told him. If Mr. Hammond had heard his wife\u0027s truck had been hit by a meteor, Cody mused, he sure as hell wouldn\u0027t have dicked around school so long after the bell rang.\n \"Yeah, I hear the meteor\u0027s hot too. Radioactive. That\u0027s supposed to be a secret, but I heard it from Whale Tail at the Brandin\u0027 Iron, and she heard it from the deputy. Seems to me a little radiation might spark this damned town up some, huhi\" Cody concentrated on getting the guts of a smashed moth off the windshield.\n \"I\u0027m picking up some more bad vibes, Cody. There\u0027s a real purple haze around this place today, man.\" \"You\u0027re buyin\u0027 gas, not talk.\" \"Whoa! The stone face speaks!\" Cade rubbed Typhoid\u0027s skull and watched the boy work. He was thirty-three years old, with a soft, cherubic face - but beneath the sunglasses his eyes were cold blue and cunning. Cody had seen them before, and they made him think of the hard steel of rabbit traps. Under his Panama hat, Cade\u0027s hair was pale blond and thinning, combed back from a high, unlined forehead. Two diamond studs glittered in his left earlobe. \"Tomorrow\u0027s your last schoolday,\" he said; the shuck-and-jive had dropped from his voice. \"Big day for you, man. Important day.\" He scratched beneath Typhoid\u0027s muzzle. \"I guess you\u0027ve been thinking about your future. about money too.\" Don\u0027t answer him! Cody thought. Don\u0027t fall for it!\n \"How\u0027s your father doingi I missed him last time I stopped in for a doughnut.\" Cody finished the windshield and glanced at the diesel pump. The numbers were still clicking.\n \"Hope he\u0027s okay. You know, with the town shutting down and all, it probably won\u0027t be too long before the bakery goes under. What\u0027s he going to do when that happens, Codyi\" Cody walked over to stand by the pump. Mack Cade\u0027s head turned to follow him, the smile as white as a scar. \"I\u0027ve got an opening for a mechanic,\" he said. \"a good, fast mechanic. The opening won\u0027t last but for a week or so. Pay starts at six hundred a month. Do you know anybody who could use the moneyi\" Cody was silent, watching the numbers change. But inside his head six hundred a month kept repeating itself, gaining power with every repetition. God a\u0027mighty! he thought. What I couldn\u0027t do with that kind of money!\n \"But it\u0027s not just the money,\" Cade pressed on, smelling blood in the boy\u0027s silence. \"It\u0027s the benefits too, man. I can get you a car just like this one. Or a Porsche, if you want. any color. How about a red Porsche, five on the floor, top speed a hundred and twentyi You name the options, you got them.\" The numbers stopped. Cade\u0027s tank was full. Cody unhooked the nozzle, closed the gas port, and returned the hose to the diesel pump. Six hundred a month, he was thinking. a red Porsche... top speed a hundred and twenty... \"It\u0027s night work,\" Cade said. \"The hours depend on what\u0027s in the yard, and I\u0027ll expect you to work sixteen hours straight if there\u0027s a rush on. My connections pay high green for quality work, Cody - and I think you can deliver it.\" Cody squinted toward Inferno. The long fall of the sun had started, and though it wouldn\u0027t be dark until after eight, he could already feel the shadows creeping up behind him. \"Maybe I can, maybe I can\u0027t.\" \"I\u0027ve seen the work you do here. It\u0027s tight. You\u0027re a natural, and you shouldn\u0027t throw away a God-given talent on junkers, should youi\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"What\u0027s to knowi\" Cade took a solid gold toothpick from his shirt pocket and dug at a lower molar. \"If it\u0027s the law you\u0027re skittish of... well, that\u0027s under control. This is a business, Cody. everybody understands the language.\" The boy didn\u0027t reply. He was thinking of what six hundred dollars a month could buy him, and how far away from Inferno he could get in a red Porsche. To hell with the old man; he could rot and turn into a maggot farm as far as Cody cared. Of course he knew what Mack Cade\u0027s business was. He\u0027d seen the tractor-trailer trucks turn off Highway 67 and pull into Cade\u0027s autoyard in the middle of the night, and he knew they were hauling stolen cars. He knew, as well, that when the big trucks headed north again they were carrying vehicles without histories. after Cade\u0027s workmen had finished, the engines, radiators, exhaust systems, most of the body parts, even the hubcaps and paint jobs would have been changed, swapped around, made to look like cars sweet from the showroom floor. Where those finished chopshop specials went, Cody didn\u0027t know, but he figured they were resold by crooked dealers or used as company cars by organized gangs. Whoever used them paid heavy money to Cade, who\u0027d found Inferno the perfect place to stash such an operation.\n \"You don\u0027t want to wind up like your old man, Cody.\" The boy saw his face reflected in Cade\u0027s sunglasses. \"You want to do something with your life, don\u0027t youi\" Cody hesitated. He didn\u0027t know what he wanted. Though he didn\u0027t give a shit about the law, he\u0027d never really done anything criminal, either. Maybe he did smash a few windows and raise some hell, but what Cade offered was different. a whole lot different. It was like taking a step beyond a line that Cody had balanced on for a long time - yet to cross that line meant he couldn\u0027t come back. Not ever.\n \"Offer\u0027s open for one week. You know where to find me.\" Cade\u0027s smile had clicked back on, full wattage. \"How much do I owe youi\" Cody checked the numbers. \"Twelve seventy-three.\" The man popped open his glove compartment, and Typhoid licked his hand. In the glove box there was a .45 automatic and an extra clip. His hand came out holding a rolled-up twenty; he snapped the glove compartment shut. \"Here you go, man. Keep the change. and there\u0027s a little something extra in there for you too.\" He started the engine, the Mercedes giving a clean, throaty growl. agitated, Lockjaw stood stiff-legged on the backseat and barked in Cody\u0027s face. He smelled raw meat.\n \"Think on these things,\" Cade said, and accelerated out of the station with a shriek of flayed rubber.\n Cody watched him speed away, heading south. He unrolled the twenty. Inside it was a small, capped glass vial holding three yellowish crystals. Though he\u0027d never cooked the stuff before, Cody knew what crack looked like.\n \"You okayi\" Startled, Cody slipped the vial into his breast pocket, nestling the cocaine crystals under the Texaco star. Mendoza was standing about six feet behind him. \"Yeah.\" Cody gave him the twenty. \"He said to keep the change.\" \"and what else did he sayi\" \"Just chewin\u0027 air.\" Cody walked past Mendoza toward the garage stalls, trying to sort things out in his mind. He felt the pull of six hundred dollars a month on his soul, like a cold hand from the midst of a blast furnace. What\u0027s the problemi he asked himself. a few hours of work a night, the cops already paid off, a chance to move up in Cade\u0027s operation if I wanted. Why didn\u0027t I say yes right then and therei\n \"You know where his cars go, don\u0027t youi\" Mendoza had followed Cody, and now leaned against the stall\u0027s cinder-block wall.\n \"Nope.\" \"Sure you do. about two or three years ago, a Da up in Fort Worth was found in the trunk of a car with his throat cut and a bullet between his eyes. The car was parked in front of City Hall. Of course it had no ID numbers. Where do you think it came fromi\" Cody shrugged, but he knew.\n \"Before that,\" Mendoza continued, his burly brown arms folded over his chest, \"a bomb went off in a pickup truck in Houston. The cops figured it was supposed to kill a lawyer who was workin\u0027 on a drug bust - but it blew a woman and her kid to pieces instead. Where do you think that truck came fromi\" Cody picked up the lug-nut gun. \"You don\u0027t have to lecture me.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to sound like I am. But don\u0027t you believe for one minute that Cade doesn\u0027t know how his cars are used. and that\u0027s just in Texas - he sends them all over the country!\" \"I was just talkin\u0027 to him. No law against that.\" \"I know what he wants from you,\" Mendoza said firmly. \"You\u0027re a man now, and you can do as you please. But I have to tell you something my father told me a long, long time ago: a man is responsible for his actions.\" \"You\u0027re not my father.\" \"No, I\u0027m not. But I\u0027ve watched you grow up, Cody. Oh, I know all about that Renegade shit, but that\u0027s small compared to what Cade could drag you in - \" Cody pressed the gun\u0027s trigger, and its high squeal echoed between the walls. He turned his back on Mendoza and went to work.\n Mendoza grunted, his gaze black and brooding. He liked Cody, knew he was a smart young man and could be somebody if he put his mind to it. But Cody had been crippled by that bastard father of his, and he\u0027d let his old man\u0027s poison seep into his veins. Mendoza didn\u0027t know what was ahead for Cody, but he feared for the young man. He\u0027d seen too many lives tossed away for the glint of Cade\u0027s fool\u0027s gold.\n He returned to the office and switched on the radio to the Spanish music station in el Paso. around nine o\u0027clock the Trailways bus from Odessa would come through on its way south to Chihauhau. The driver always stopped at Mendoza\u0027s station to let the passengers buy soft drinks and candy from the machines. Then, except for an occasional truck, Highway 67 would lie empty, its concrete cooling under the expanse of stars, and Mendoza would shut down for the night. He would go home in time for a late dinner and a couple of games of checkers with his uncle Lazaro, who lived with him and his wife on Bordertown\u0027s First Street, until the ticking of the clock eventually urged the time for bed. Tonight he might dream of being a racecar driver, roaring around the dirt tracks of his youth. But, most likely, he would not dream.\n and that would be another night gone, and another day approaching, and Mendoza knew that was the way a man\u0027s life ran out.\n He turned the radio up louder, listening to the strident trumpets of a mariachi band, and he tried very hard not to let himself think about the boy in the garage, who stood at a crossroads that no one on earth could help him travel. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-16.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
