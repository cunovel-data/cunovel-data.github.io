{"id":83400,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"No one spoke for a long moment. Smoke drifted through the light. Then Vance jabbered, \"I was ready to shoot the bastard! I was just waitin\u0027 for the word, and I could\u0027ve blown its head off!\" \"Right,\" Rhodes said. He wiped the creeping line of blood from his cheek, his eyes hollowed out and scared. \"and gotten yourself and the rest of us torn to pieces too. Tom, what time is iti\" \"One minute till two.\" \"Which means we\u0027ve got fifty-eight minutes to find Daufin and her pod. We\u0027re going to have to split up and start searching.\" \"Hold on!\" Jessie said. \"What are you sayingi That we\u0027re going to give Daufin upi\" \"That\u0027s right. Have you got a better ideai\" \"We\u0027re talking about my little girl.\" \"We\u0027re talking about an alien,\" Rhodes reminded her. His insides were still quaking. The smell of hot metal remained in his nostrils. \"No matter what it looks like. We\u0027ve gotten into something here that I think we\u0027d better get our asses out of real fast.\" \"I\u0027m not handing my little girl over to that sonofabitch!\" Jessie vowed. Tom started to touch her shoulder to calm her, but she pulled away. \"Do you hear mei I\u0027m not doing it!\" \"Jessie, it\u0027s either Daufin or a lot of people - your friends - who die. I\u0027m not doubting for one second that Stinger could lay waste to this whole town. Right now I don\u0027t care why Stinger wants Daufin, or what she\u0027s done; I just want to find her and save some people\u0027s lives, if I can.\" \"What about Stevie\u0027s lifei\" Tears scorched Jessie\u0027s eyes. Her heart was pounding wildly, and she couldn\u0027t seem to draw a full breath. \"My God, we\u0027ll be throwing my daughter\u0027s life away!\" \"Not if we can find Daufin and get her to go back into her pod. Maybe that\u0027ll release Stevie.\" He couldn\u0027t stand this house any longer; the walls were closing in on him. \"I\u0027m sorry, but we don\u0027t have any choice. Sheriff, I say we go get your deputy and break into teams for a house-to-house search. Go up and down the streets and pick up some volunteers, if we can find any.\" He knew that a street search in all this smoke and dust was going to be almost impossible, but there was no other way. \"Maybe somebody at the clinic\u0027s seen her, or she might\u0027ve gone across the bridge into Bordertown. Tom, will you and Jessie go check your house and start searching east along Celeste Street from therei\" Tom stared at the floor. He felt Jessie watching him. \"Yes,\" he said. \"We will.\" \"Thank you. We need to meet somewhere in thirty minutes and map out where we\u0027ve been. How about the Brandin\u0027 Ironi\" \"Fine,\" Tom said. \"all right. Let\u0027s get started.\" Without waiting for the others, he left the house and went out to the patrol car, parked in front of the Hammonds\u0027 Civic at the curb. Vance and Gunniston followed, then Jessie and Tom. Vance said, \"Better take this,\" and gave Tom the Winchester. \"I\u0027ll pick up the other rifle at the office. You two be careful, heari\" \"We will be,\" Tom told him, and Vance got behind the wheel, pulled the car away from the curb, and drove back toward the center of town. Jessie watched the car\u0027s lights move away and be swallowed by the murk. She felt faint and she stumbled, but Tom caught her and she held on to him. Tears tracked through the dust on her cheeks. \"I can\u0027t do it,\" she said weakly. \"Oh Jesus, I can\u0027t give her up.\" \"We have to. Listen to me.\" He put a finger under her chin and lifted her head. \"I want more than anything in the world to have Stevie back, just like you do. But if Stevie\u0027s gone - \" \"She\u0027s not! Daufin said she was safe!\" \"If she\u0027s gone,\" Tom continued, \"our world\u0027s not going to end. We have Ray, and we have each other. But if we don\u0027t find Daufin and turn her over to that thing, a lot of people are going to die.\" Jessie was almost blinded by tears now, and she put her hands to her face. \"We have to,\" he repeated, and he opened the door for her and then went around to the driver\u0027s side. Jessie was about to slide in when she heard the muttering of an engine, coming closer. a single headlight showed brownish yellow through the smoke. Somebody on a motorcycle, she realized. Tom hesitated, gripping the door handle, as Cody Lockett stopped beside the car. Cody pushed his goggles back up on his forehead. attached to the handlebars with a strip of electrical tape was a sawed-off baseball bat with nails protruding from it: a weapon from the \u0027Gade arsenal. \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for Vance and Colonel Rhodes,\" Cody said. \"They\u0027re supposed to be here.\" \"You just missed them. They\u0027re on their way to the sheriff\u0027s office.\" Tom opened the door and put the Winchester into the backseat. \"Who told you they were herei\" \"I... uh... ran into Rick Jurado. Listen...\" He glanced at Jessie, could see from her red and puffy eyes that she\u0027d been crying. He didn\u0027t know exactly how to say this, so he just plowed on ahead. \"I found your little girl.\" Tom was speechless. Jessie choked back a sob and said, \"Where is shei\" \"Up at the fort. The apartments, I mean. There\u0027s a whole lot of people up there, so she\u0027s okay.\" Cody would never forget the faces of Tank, Nasty, and Bobby Clay Clemmons when he\u0027d told them that the little girl wasn\u0027t what she appeared to be. They hadn\u0027t believed him until she\u0027d started to talk, and then their jaws had fallen to the floor. along with most of the Renegades, there were about two hundred or more people in the building who\u0027d been drawn by the electric lights. Cody had gotten the creature settled in, poured warm beer over the two gashes on his ankle, and taped a cloth around it, then come hunting for Vance and the colonel. \"Uh... there\u0027s somethin\u0027 else you ought to know,\" he said. \"I mean... she looks like your little girl and all, but... she\u0027s not.\" \"We know that,\" Tom replied. \"You doi Man, I thought I was goin\u0027 off the deep end when she told me who she was!\" \"Same here.\" He glanced at Jessie, and saw she knew what he was about to say. \"We have to tell Rhodes. We can catch him before he leaves the sheriff\u0027s office.\" \"Tom... please. Wait,\" Jessie said. \"Why don\u0027t we talk to her firsti Try to make her understand that we\u0027ve got to get Stevie backi\" Tom looked at his wristwatch. It was four minutes after two, and he\u0027d never thought a second hand could move so fast. \"We\u0027ve got less than thirty minutes before we\u0027re supposed to meet at the Brandin\u0027 Iron.\" \"That\u0027s time enough for us to talk to her! Please... I think we might be able to make her understand better than Rhodes could.\" His gaze lingered on the racing second hand, but his mind was already made up. \"all right,\" he said. \"Take us to her,\" he told Cody, and got behind the wheel as Cody lowered his goggles and swung the motorcycle around. at the end of Travis Street, a dozen cars and pickup trucks were parked haphazardly in the apartment building\u0027s lot; a couple of them had run right up to the front door. Cody waited for Tom and Jessie to get out of their Civic, and then he threaded his motorcycle through the vehicles and to the door, which was covered with gray sheet metal and had a narrow view slit like all the first-floor windows. \"Open up, Bobby!\" he called, and heard the sound of the many latches being thrown back. Bobby Clay Clemmons pulled the heavy door open, its hinges groaning like the entrance to a medieval castle, and Cody powered the motorcycle on through and into the stark white glare of the wall-mounted incandescents. He popped the kickstand down and left the Honda near the stairway that ascended to the second floor, and a moment later Tom - carrying the Winchester - and Jessie came in. \"Lock it,\" Cody said, and Bobby Clay pushed the door shut and shot all four of the bolts home. Neither Jessie nor Tom had ever been in the Winter T. Preston apartment building before. a long corridor lined with doors - some of them torn off their hinges - went the length of the first floor, and the cracked plaster walls screamed with graffiti in a blaze of Day-Glo orange and purple. The place smelled of marijuana, stale beer, and the ghost aromas of the mine workers and their families who\u0027d lived here: a commingling of sweat, dry heat, and scorched food. For the first time in almost two years, voices other than those of Renegades echoed through the building. \"This way.\" Cody led them up the stairs. The second floor was a mirror image of the first, except a ladder ascended through a trapdoor to the roof. People were sitting in the hallway, and bare mattresses had been dragged out of some of the apartments for them to rest on. They were mostly Inferno people, with only seven or eight Hispanic faces among them. as they followed Cody, Tom and Jessie had to step over and around the refugees; the lights revealed familiar faces: Vic Chaffin and his wife arleen, Don Ringwald and his family, Ida Slattery, the Fraziers, Jim and Paula Cleveland and many others. The apartments were full too, and a few infants keened a discordant chorus. There was some talking, but not a lot; most people were numbed, and some of them were sleeping sitting up. The heat from all these close-packed bodies was tremendous, and the air was tainted with smoke. Cody took them to a closed door that had HQ and KNOCK FIRST scrawled on it in red spray paint above a Billy Idol poster. Cody did knock, and a little sliding aperture opened. Nasty\u0027s green eyes, outlined with glittery gold mascara, peered out. Then the aperture shut, the door was unlocked, and they went in. This was Cody\u0027s home whenever he came here. The front room held a cot, a stained plaid sofa with the stuffing leaking out through knife rips, a scarred pinewood table and chairs, and a small, battered refrigerator saved from the dump and forced to gasp out a few more months. The floor was covered with faded brown linoleum that was curling up in the corners, and on the cheaply paneled walls hung motorcycle and rock-star posters. a window, cracked open to admit smoky air, faced south. a short hallway went past a busted-up bathroom and into what used to be a bedroom, now the \u0027Gades\u0027 armory where a variety of weapons like brass knuckles and pellet rifles hung on wall hooks. Tank had been sitting on the sofa, and now he quickly stood up as he saw Mr. Hammond and his wife come in. His camouflage-daubed football helmet was snug around his skull. Cody relocked the door, and Nasty stepped back to let the Hammonds see who stood at the window, facing them. \"Hello, Tom and Jessie,\" Daufin said, and smiled wanly. The moment enfolded Jessie. That was Stevie\u0027s body, Stevie\u0027s face, Stevie\u0027s dimpled smile. even the voice was Stevie\u0027s, if you chose not to hear the fragile undertone like wind chimes in the cradle of a breeze. Inside that body was Stevie\u0027s heart, lungs, veins, and organs; all of it belonged to Stevie except the unknown center where Daufin lived. Jessie took a step forward, and fresh tears broke. another step, and Tom saw where she was going and he reached for her but let his hand fall short. Jessie walked across the room to the body of her daughter, and she started to place her hands on the little shoulders with the intention of picking the child up and holding her close - just for a moment, to feel the beating of Stevie\u0027s heart and know that somewhere, in whatever way she couldn\u0027t even begin to fathom, Stevie was alive. But in the child\u0027s face the eyes sparkled with intelligence and fire - intense and even frightening - that was far beyond Stevie\u0027s years. The face was Stevie\u0027s, yes, but the spirit was not. That was clear to Jessie in an instant, and her hands poised over Daufin\u0027s shoulders. \"You\u0027re... you\u0027re filthy!\" Jessie said, and blinked away the tears. \"You must\u0027ve been rolling in the dust!\" Daufin looked down at her own dirty clothes. Jessie\u0027s hands lowered, and brushed loose dust off the T-shirt. \"Don\u0027t they teach you to be clean where you come fromi My God, what a mess!\" The auburn hair was full of tangles, bits of weed and spiderweb strands, Jessie saw Nasty\u0027s buckskin shoulderbag on the table; the bag was open, and the pink handle of a hairbrush protruded. She took the brush out and started going through the child\u0027s hair with the dirt-hating vengeance of a mother. Puzzled, Daufin started to back away. Jessie snapped, \"Hold still!\" and Daufin stood at attention while the brush strokes puffed dust into the air. \"We\u0027re glad to see you,\" Tom said. He knelt down so his eyes would be on a level with Daufin\u0027s. \"Why\u0027d you run awayi\" \"I went whack-o,\" she said. \"Uh... we\u0027ve been... like... teachin\u0027 her earth lingo,\" Tank explained. \"She\u0027s been tellin\u0027 us about her planet too. It sounds mighty gnarly, man!\" For once, his grim, hatchet-nosed face had taken on a childlike shine of excitement. \"I guess so.\" Tom watched his wife brushing their child\u0027s hair with determined strokes, and he thought his heart might break. \"Daufin, we just had a talk with... something. I can\u0027t say it was a man, and I can\u0027t say it was a machine.\" Daufin knew. \"Stinger.\" \"Yes.\" He looked up at Cody Lockett. \"It took Mack Cade\u0027s body and made him into a...\" again, words failed him. \"Part man, part dog.\" \"One of Cade\u0027s Dobermans is growing out of his chest.\" Jessie\u0027s hand continued to guide the brush. \"Freakacreepy!\" Nasty said. Her love of danger was stoked and burning. \"Man, I\u0027d like to see that!\" \"You\u0027re crazy as hell too!\" Cody snapped. \"It got the Cat Lady,\" he said to Tom. \"Mrs. Stellenberg. It made her into something with a tail full of spikes, and I shot the bitch full of holes but she just kept comin\u0027.\" \"all are Stinger,\" Daufin said quietly, standing rigid while she endured whatever it was Jessie was doing. It seemed to be giving Jessie pleasure. \"Stinger creates them, and they become Stinger.\" Tom didn\u0027t quite follow that. \"Like robots, is that righti\" \"Living mechanisms. They think with Stinger\u0027s brain, and they see with Stinger\u0027s eyes. Stinger hears and speaks through them. and kills through them too.\" \"Somethin\u0027 mighty big\u0027s been roaming around under the streets,\" Cody said. \"Is that one of Stinger\u0027s machines tooi\" \"No,\" Daufin said. \"That is Stinger itself. Stinger captures and stores bodies for duplication. Signals - you would call them blueprints - pass from Stinger to machines on the ship and there the replicants are made.\" \"So we know it got Dodge Creech, Cade, Mrs. Stellenberg, and whoever that was in the autoyard. Plus the thing that left its arm with Rhodes.\" Tom stood up and laid the Winchester on the table. \"Stinger\u0027s probably taken a lot of others we don\u0027t know about too.\" \"There!\" Jessie finished her battle with the last snarl and stepped back. She felt light-headed and drifty, and she\u0027d caught a hint of the apple-scented shampoo she\u0027d washed Stevie\u0027s hair with last night. \"Now you look pretty again!\" \"Thank you,\" Daufin said; it was obviously a compliment, and deserved a reaction, though why these people lavished such attention on strands of limp cellular matter was another mystery of the human tribe. Her gaze went to Tom. \"You said you talked to Stinger. about me, of course.\" \"Yes.\" \"Stinger wants me and my lifepod, and an ultimatum was given.\" Tom nodded. \"It said it wants you in one hour\" - a glance at the racing hands of his watch - \"and we\u0027ve got about forty minutes left.\" \"Or Stinger will continue the destruction,\" Daufin said. \"Yes. That\u0027s Stinger\u0027s way.\" \"The sonofabitch wants to take her back to prison!\" Cody spoke up. \"and all she did was sing!\" \"Singi That\u0027s not what Stinger said. He - it - told us about the chemical on your world,\" Tom recounted. \"The poison, I mean. Stinger said you...\" It was crazy, looking at his little girl\u0027s face and saying these things. \"Said you were a wild animal.\" \"I am,\" she answered without hesitation. \"To Stinger and the House of Fists, I deserve a cage and a frozen sleep.\" \"The House of Fistsi What\u0027s thati\" \"Stinger\u0027s masters. a race that worships violence; their religion is the conquest of worlds, and their entrance into the afterlife is determined by the deaths of what they consider lower beings.\" a faint, gritty smile surfaced. \"Wild animals like me.\" \"But if they\u0027re trying to control this chemical, isn\u0027t that for the good of - \" Daufin laughed: a mixture of a child\u0027s laugh and the sound of coins thrown to the floor. \"Oh yes!\" she said. \"Yes, they are trying to control the chemical!\" The fires ignited in her eyes again. \"But not for the good of their brother creatures, no matter what Stinger told you. They want the chemical for their weapons! They want to build deadlier fleets and more ways to kill!\" The little body shook with fury. \"The more of the chemical they steal from my planet, the closer my tribe comes to destruction! and the closer all worlds come to being destroyed, as well - including this one! Do you think Stinger will leave here and not tell the House of Fists about your planeti\" She searched for words, stumbled over the tangle of human speech, grasped hold of a phrase the humans named Tank and Nasty had taught her: \"Get real!\" The flesh of Daufin\u0027s face had drawn tight, showing the sharp angles of the bones. Her eyes blazed with anger, and she began to pace back and forth in front of the window. \"I never meant to come here. My ship lost power, and I had to put it down where I could. I know I\u0027ve brought hurting to you, and to others here. For that I will carry a burden for the rest of my life.\" She stopped suddenly, looking back and forth between Tom and Jessie. \"Stinger will tell the House of Fists about you, and about this world. Stinger will say you are soft, defenseless life forms who were born to be caged, and they\u0027ll come here. Oh yes, they\u0027ll come here - and they might bring their weapons full of the \u0027poison\u0027 they\u0027ve stolen from my planet! Do you know what that \u0027poison\u0027 isi\" Tom thought she was about to start spouting steam from her nostrils. \"No,\" he said warily. \"Of course you don\u0027t! How could youi\" She shook her head, exasperated. a fine sheen of sweat glistened on her cheeks. \"I\u0027ll do more than tell you; I\u0027ll show you.\" \"Show usi\" Jessie said. \"Howi\" \"Through the inner eye.\" Daufin saw no comprehension on their faces; they were blank slates, waiting to be written on. She lifted both hands toward them. \"If you want to know, I\u0027ll take you there. I\u0027ll show you my world, through the eye of my memory.\" The humans hesitated. Daufin didn\u0027t blame them. She was offering a glimpse of the unknown, and what was home to her would be to them an alien realm. \"Take my hands,\" she urged, and her fingers strained for contact. \"If you want to know, you have to see.\" Tom took the first step forward, and when it was done, the hardest part was over. He walked to Daufin and slid his hand into hers. The flesh was oven hot, and as her fingers gripped tight he could already feel the prickling of an electrical charge passing from her into him. \"Jessiei\" Daufin asked. She came to her daughter\u0027s outstretched hand, and took it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-43.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
