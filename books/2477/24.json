{"id":83381,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"Say whati\" early McNeil asked, his husky voice slow and deliberate. \"Inside the child\u0027s body is an alien life form,\" Rhodes repeated. \"From where, I don\u0027t know. Just out there somewhere.\" He wiped sweat from his forehead with a damp paper towel. His shirt was plastered to his back. The electric fan was, of course, dead, and heat hung heavy in the sheriff\u0027s office. Several battery-powered lamps had been \"requisitioned\" from the hardware store and provided glary illumination. Gathered in the office, along with Dr. McNeil, Rhodes, and the sheriff, were Jessie and Tom, the Reverend Hale Jennings from the Baptist church, Father Manuel LaPrado, and his younger assistant, Father Domingo Ortega. Xavier Mendoza had been asked to come by LaPrado as a representative of Bordertown, and Mayor Brett stood gnawing on his fingernails next to Mendoza. \"So this creature came out of a ball and got into Stevie Hammondi Is that what you\u0027re askin\u0027 us to swalleri\" early continued, sitting on a hard bench brought from one of the cells. \"It\u0027s a little more complicated than that, but you\u0027ve got the gist. I think the creature occupied her sphere - and I\u0027m referring to \u0027it\u0027 as female because that simplifies things too - until she was able to make the transference. How that happened, or the physics of it, I can\u0027t say. Obviously, we\u0027re dealing with some pretty strange technology.\" \"Mister, that\u0027s the damnedest tale I\u0027ve ever heard. Pardon me, padres.\" McNeil flicked a glance at Jennings and LaPrado and lit a cigar with a kitchen match scraped across his boot sole, and if anybody didn\u0027t like the smoke, they could lump it. \"Tom, what do you and Dr. Jessie have to say about thisi\" \"Just one thing: it\u0027s true,\" Tom said. \"Stevie\u0027s... not Stevie anymore. The creature calls herself Daufin.\" \"Not exactly,\" Rhodes corrected. \"We call her Daufin. I think she saw something in one of Stevie\u0027s pictures that she identified with. Whether it was a dolphin, or the ocean, I don\u0027t know. But I don\u0027t really believe that\u0027s the creature\u0027s name, or she\u0027d have a better command of our language.\" \"You mean she can\u0027t talki\" Father LaPrado\u0027s voice was soft and frail. He was a reed-thin man of seventy-one, with large, sparkling hazel eyes and a headful of snowy hair. His shoulders were stooped, but he carried himself with great dignity. He occupied the chair at Danny Chaffin\u0027s desk. \"She can communicate, but only as much as a crash course in english allows her to. She\u0027s got to be highly intelligent and retentive, because it took her only a few hours to learn the alphabet, the dictionary, and to read through an encyclopedia. But I\u0027m sure there are still a lot of concepts she can\u0027t understand, or translate to us.\" \"and she\u0027s missin\u0027i\" Vance asked. \"a monster from another world\u0027s loose on our streetsi\" \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s dangerous,\" Jessie asserted, before Vance\u0027s speculations got out of hand. \"I think she\u0027s scared and alone, and I don\u0027t think she\u0027s a monster.\" \"That\u0027s mighty white of you, considerin\u0027 how she got inside your little girl.\" Vance realized what he\u0027d just said, and he darted a glance at the Bordertown representatives, then back to Jessie. \"Listen, she - it, or whatever - might look like a little girl and all, but how do we know she ain\u0027t got... like, y\u0027know, powers. Like readin\u0027 minds - \" Then you don\u0027t have anything to worry about, Jessie thought. Your pages are blank. \" - or controllin\u0027 em, even. Hell, she might have a death ray or - \" \"Cut the hysterics,\" Rhodes said firmly, and Vance immediately silenced. \"First of all, Captain Gunniston and my chopper pilot are out searching for Daufin right now; secondly, I agree with Mrs. Hammond. The creature doesn\u0027t seem threatening.\" He didn\u0027t use the word dangerous - he recalled shaking hands with a lightning bolt. \"as long as we\u0027re not threatening to her,\" he added. \"What are you plannin\u0027 on doin\u0027 when you find heri How you gonna get her back in her balli\" a shroud of cigar smoke floated around early\u0027s head. \"We don\u0027t know yet. The sphere\u0027s missing, and we think she hid it somewhere. If it\u0027s any consolation, I don\u0027t think she meant to land here. I think her vehicle malfunctioned, and she was on her way to somewhere else.\" \"By vehicle I reckon you mean spaceship.\" Reverend Hale Jennings was standing at the window, his acorn-shaped bald head tinged violet by the skygrid. He was a stocky, broad-chested man in his late forties, built like a fireplug, and had been a boxing champ during his days in the navy. \"How\u0027d she pilot a spaceship if she was inside a spherei\" \"I don\u0027t know. We can only find out from her.\" \"Okay, but what about thati\" Jennings\u0027s head tilted toward the black, scale-covered pyramid. \"I don\u0027t know about you gents, but that particular visitor makes me a mite nervous.\" \"Yeah,\" Vance agreed. \"How do we know Daufin didn\u0027t call it down to help her invade usi\" Colonel Rhodes measured his words carefully. To tell them that Daufin was terrified of that pyramid would not help their peace of mind, but there was no longer any use in hiding the truth. \"There\u0027s no proof she brought it down, but she must know what it is. Just before it landed, she kept repeating something: Stinger.\" There was a silence, as the possible meanings of that word sank in. \"Might be the name of the planet she comes from,\" Vance suggested. \"Maybe she looks like a big ol\u0027 wasp under that skin.\" \"as I said,\" Rhodes continued doggedly, \"she just learned english. evidently the word stinger was suggested to her by something she saw.\" He remembered the picture of the scorpion on Stevie\u0027s bulletin board. \"What she intended it to mean, I don\u0027t know.\" \"There\u0027s much you don\u0027t know, young man,\" Father LaPrado said, with a wan smile. \"Yes sir, but I\u0027m working on it. as soon as we find Daufin, maybe we can clear some of these questions up.\" He glanced quickly at his wristwatch; it was 10:23, a little more than thirty minutes since the pyramid had come down. \"Now: about the power failure. all of you have seen the smoke clouds hanging at the top of the grid. We\u0027re in some sort of force field, generated from inside the pyramid. Just as it keeps the smoke from getting out, it\u0027s cut the power and telephone lines. The thing is solid, though it appears transparent. It\u0027s just as if a big glass bowl was plopped on top of us. Nothing can get in and nothing can get out either.\" He\u0027d tried the sheriff\u0027s CB radio and gotten a squeal of static as the radio waves were deflected. \"a force field,\" Jennings repeated. \"How far out does it goi\" \"We\u0027re going to take the chopper up and find out. My guess is that it\u0027s limited to the immediate area around Inferno and Bordertown - maybe ten miles at the most. We don\u0027t have to worry about the air giving out\" - I hope, he thought - \"but the smoke from those fires isn\u0027t going to go away.\" The blazes were still burning, and black smoke from burning heaps of tires was not only thickening at the top of the grid but beginning to haze the streets too, and the air was permeated with a scorched smell. early grunted, took one more long draw on his cigar, puffed the smoke away, and crushed the stogie out on the floor. \"Reckon I\u0027ll do my part against air pollution,\" he grumbled. \"Right. Thanks.\" \"One moment.\" Father Ortega, a slim, somber-faced man with swirls of gray at his temples, stood next to LaPrado. \"You say this field of force prevents entering and escape, sii Is it not clear that it has a particular purposei\" \"Yeah,\" Vance said. \"To keep us caged up while we get invaded.\" \"No,\" the priest went on, \"not to keep us caged. To imprison Daufin.\" Rhodes looked at Tom and Jessie; all of them had already warily circled that conclusion. If the black pyramid - or something inside it - had come for Daufin, she obviously did not want to be taken. He returned his attention to Ortega, his expression studiously composed. \"again, we can only find that out from her. What we need to talk about now is crowd control. I doubt if anybody\u0027s going to be getting much sleep tonight. I think it would be best if people knew they had places to congregate, where there were lights and food. any suggestionsi\" \"The high school gym might do,\" Brett offered. \"That\u0027s big enough.\" \"Folks want to be closer to their homes,\" Jennings said. \"How about the churchesi We\u0027ve got a ton of candles already, and I reckon we can get some kerosene lamps from the hardware store.\" \"Si.\" LaPrado nodded assent. \"We can share food from the bakery and the grocery store.\" \"Probably a pot of coffee or two still at the Brandin\u0027 Iron,\" Vance said. \"That might help.\" \"Good. The next question is, how do we get people off the streetsi\" Rhodes looked to suggestions from LaPrado and Jennings. LaPrado said, \"We have bells, up in the steeple. If they haven\u0027t been knocked loose, we can start them ringing.\" \"That\u0027s a problem for us,\" Jennings answered. \"We\u0027ve got electronic bells. Took the real ones out four years ago. I reckon I can find some volunteers to go house to house, though, and let folks know we\u0027re open.\" \"I\u0027ll leave that and the food for both of you and the mayor to organize,\" Rhodes said. \"I doubt if we can get everybody off the streets, but the more people indoors the better I\u0027ll feel about things.\" \"Domingo, will you see me back, pleasei\" LaPrado stood up with Ortega\u0027s help. \"I\u0027ll get the bells started, and ask some of the ladies to round up food.\" He shuffled to the door, and paused there. \"Colonel Rhodes, if someone asks me what\u0027s happening, do you mind if I use your explanationi\" \"What\u0027s thati\" \"\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027\" the old priest replied, with a grim little chuckle. He allowed Mendoza to open the door for him. \"Don\u0027t go too far, Father,\" early said. \"I may be needin\u0027 you pretty soon. You too, Hale. I\u0027ve got four of Cade\u0027s workmen who aren\u0027t gonna last the night, and I imagine the fireboys\u0027ll be pullin\u0027 more bodies out when it gets cool enough to go in.\" LaPrado nodded. \"You know where to find me,\" he said, and left the office with Ortega and Mendoza. \"Fella don\u0027t have half his marbles,\" Vance muttered. early stood up. His time for lollygagging was spent. \"Folks, this has been real educational, but I\u0027ve got to get back to the clinic.\" eight of the kids from the gang fight, including Cody Lockett and Ray Hammond, had been taken to the Inferno Clinic for stitches and bandages, but the seriously injured workers from Cade\u0027s junkyard - and only seven of a crew of forty-six had come staggering, burned, and bleeding over the mashed-down fence - were being attended to first. early\u0027s staff of three nurses and six volunteers were treating shock and glass-cut patients by the glare of the emergency lights. \"Dr. Jessie, I sure could use you,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got a fella with a piece of metal scrapin\u0027 his backbone and another who\u0027s gonna have to part with a crushed arm pretty soon. Tom, if you can hold a flashlight steady and you don\u0027t mind a little blood, I can use you too.\" It occurred to him that Noah Twilley was going to be just as busy before long, when the firemen brought the rest of the corpses out. \"I can handle it,\" Tom said. \"Colonel, will you let us know when you find heri\" \"as soon as. I\u0027m on my way to meet Gunny right now.\" They followed early out into the violet-hued street. a few knots of people remained on the street, gawking, but most of the onlookers had melted back to their homes. Rhodes walked toward Preston Park, Tom and Jessie went to their Civic, and early climbed nimbly into his dune buggy. as the buggy roared away, it was narrowly missed by a battleship-sized yellow Cadillac that stopped in front of the sheriff\u0027s office. Celeste Preston, wearing a scarlet jumpsuit, got out and stood with her hands on her hips, looking at the massive pyramid across the river. Her sharp-featured face angled up, her pale blue eyes examining the skygrid. She\u0027d already seen the helicopter sitting in Preston Park; one of the three that had buzzed her house this morning, she thought with a resurgence of righteous anger. But the anger collapsed soon enough. Whatever that big bastard was over in Cade\u0027s autoyard, and that purple mesh covering the sky, they took precedence over her concern for her lost beauty sleep. Mayor Brett and Hale Jennings emerged from Vance\u0027s office on their way to aurora Street, where the Quik-Check Grocery\u0027s owner lived. Brett almost ran into Celeste, and his heart gave a violent kick because he was scared to death of her. \"Uh... Miz Preston! What can I do for - \" \"Howdy, Pastor,\" she interrupted, then turned her cold glare on the mayor. \"Brett, I hope to God you can tell me what that thing is over there, and why the sky\u0027s all lit up and why my power and phones are out!\" \"Yes ma\u0027am.\" Brett swallowed thickly, his face beaded with sweat. \"Well... see... the colonel says it\u0027s a spaceship, and it\u0027s got a force field comin\u0027 out of it that\u0027s stopped the electricity, and - \" There was no way to explain all of it, and Celeste watched him like a hawk poised over a mouse. \"Mrs. Preston, I think it\u0027d be best if you asked Sheriff Vance,\" Jennings advised. \"He\u0027ll tell you the whole story.\" \"Oh, I can\u0027t wait for this!\" she said, and as the two men walked to the pastor\u0027s blue Ford she squared her shoulders, lifted her chin, and almost took the door off its hinges when she stormed inside. She caught Vance with his hand up the office Coke machine\u0027s innards, working a can free. \"I\u0027ve got some questions that need answerin\u0027,\" she said as the door shut behind her. Vance had hardly jumped when she came in; his nervous system had reached its quota of shocks. He kept at the can, which was still deliciously cool under his fingers. One more good twist and he\u0027d have it out. \"Sit down,\" he offered. \"I\u0027ll stand.\" \"Suit yourself.\" Damn, why wouldn\u0027t it come outi He did this all the time, and usually the cans popped out with no trouble. He jiggled it, but it seemed to be hung on something. \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake!\" Celeste stalked toward him, shoved him none too gently aside, reached her arm up the vent, and grasped the can. She twisted her wrist sharply to the left and pulled the can out. \"Here! Take the damned thing!\" Suddenly he didn\u0027t want it so much. Her arm was skinny as a rail, and he figured that\u0027s how she\u0027d done it. \"Naw,\" he said, \"you can have it.\" Normally she only drank diet colas, but the air was so hot and stifling she didn\u0027t care to be choosy. She popped the tab and drank several cool swallows. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"My throat was kinda dry.\" \"Yeah, I know what you mean. The water fountain\u0027s not workin\u0027, either.\" He nodded toward it, and when he did he caught a strange scent: like cinnamon, or some kind of fragrant spice. He realized a second later that it must be coming from Celeste Preston, maybe the scent of her shampoo or soap. Then the aroma drifted away, and he could smell his own sweaty self again. He wished he\u0027d put on some more of his Brut deodorant, because it was wearing off fast. \"You\u0027ve got blood on your face,\" she said. \"Huhi Yeah, reckon I do. Glass cut me.\" He shrugged. \"Don\u0027t matter none.\" His nose searched for another sniff of cinnamon. Just like a man! Celeste thought as she finished off the drink. Damn fools get cut and bleed like stuck pigs, and they pretend they don\u0027t even notice it! Wint was the same way, slashed his hand open on barbed wire once and acted like he\u0027d gotten a splinter in his finger, tryin\u0027 to be tough. Probably wasn\u0027t a dime\u0027s worth of difference between Wint and Vance, if you could shave about fifty pounds of fat off him. She jerked herself back to reality. either the heat was getting to her, or it was the smoke in the air; she\u0027d never felt an iota of compassion for ed Vance, and she sure didn\u0027t intend to start. She flung the can into a wastebasket and said stridently, \"I want to know what the hell\u0027s goin\u0027 on around here, and I want to know now!\" Vance stopped sniffing. It wasn\u0027t cinnamon, he decided; it was probably witch hazel. He went to his desk and got the patrol car\u0027s keys. \"I\u0027m talkin\u0027 to you!\" Celeste snapped. \"I\u0027ve gotta go over to Danny Chaffin\u0027s house and pick him up. My night deputies have vamoosed. You want to hear about it, you\u0027ll have to go with me.\" He was already on his way to the door. \"Don\u0027t you walk out on me!\" He paused. \"I\u0027ve gotta lock up. You comin\u0027, or noti\" Her idea of hell was to be in that patrol car with Vance\u0027s blubber shaking behind the wheel, but she saw she\u0027d have to endure it. \"I\u0027m comin\u0027,\" she said through gritted teeth, and followed him out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-24.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
