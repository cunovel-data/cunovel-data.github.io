Not ever.\" Jessie didn\u0027t speak, but she wanted desperately to believe. Daufin stood up. \"The process of systems checks will have already begun, all regulated by machines. There\u0027ll be other duties, like the freezing of sleep tubes for his prisoners. Stinger will be busy monitoring the machines; the procedure should take between twenty to thirty earth minutes. When the force field is turned off, the engines will start to energize. I calculate another fifteen to twenty minutes for the power system to reach lift-off capacity. So: I have roughly thirty-five to fifty minutes to breach Stinger\u0027s ship, find the prisoners, and get them out.\" Rhodes stared at her with utter disbelief. \"No way.\" \"One way: through the tunnels. I\u0027ve got to find the entrance nearest Stinger\u0027s ship. I presume that would be somewhere across the bridge.\" With an effort, Jessie spoke. \"even... if you could get them out... what about Steviei How are we going to get Stevie backi\" \"Find the pod. Take it from Stinger. as I\u0027ve said, I\u0027ve been aboard a Stinger\u0027s ship twice before, and I know how the systems work. I can enter the navigational quadrants for my world into the guidance mechanism, put everything on automatic, place my pod in a sleep tube, and meld into it before the freezing process is finished. When I enter the pod, Stevie will be freed.\" \"But still in the pyramid,\" Tom said. \"and how are you going to find the pod and those three people inside that thingi It must be huge!\" \"I know from experience where the prisoners are being held: level three, where the cages are. The pod will be close to Stinger.\" \"So you find Stinger and you find the pod, is that what you meani\" Rhodes asked. He raised his eyebrows. \"Have you considered that Stinger wants you to come after themi\" \"Yes. I won\u0027t disappoint.\" \"That\u0027s crazy!\" Rhodes insisted. \"Maybe you\u0027re some kind of firebrand on your world, but on this one you\u0027re just a little girl! First thing, you\u0027d have to get through the tunnels - and my guess is that Stinger\u0027s got replicants in there waiting for you; and secondly, you\u0027d have to kill Stinger to take the ship. How are you going to do thati\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she answered. \"I\u0027ve never seen a Stinger killed before.\" \"Great!\" Rhodes frowned and shook his head. \"We don\u0027t have a chance, folks.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that Stinger couldn\u0027t be killed,\" Daufin continued, and the strength of her voice revitalized Jessie\u0027s waning hope. \"Stinger must have a vulnerable spot, just like every other creature. If Stinger were invulnerable, there\u0027d be no need for the replicants.\" \"a vulnerable spot,\" Rhodes repeated quietly. \"Right. Well, I wouldn\u0027t go down into those tunnels without a grenade launcher and a few dozen napalm bombs. It\u0027d be suicide.\" \"I\u0027m willing to risk it.\" Tom grasped the rifle and retrieved it from the other man. His face was pale and sweating, his lips a tight gray line. \"I\u0027m going with Daufin.\" \"and get yourself killedi Forget it!\" Jessie reached up and took Daufin\u0027s hand. Little waves of static electricity flowed between them. \"Tell me the truth: can we get Stevie out of therei\" \"We can try. I want to go home as badly as you want Stevie. If my tribe doesn\u0027t fight, they\u0027ll die. If the House of Fists returns here, your earth will die. Neither of us has a choice.\" Jessie nodded, and looked at Tom. \"I\u0027m going too.\" She stood up. Before Tom or Rhodes could respond, the door opened and Gunniston came in. With him this time were Rick Jurado and Pequin. Rick\u0027s face was streaked with dust and grime and his swollen ankle was bound up as tight as he could stand with a strip of sheet from the Smart Dollar. He had come out amid the houses at the end of Oakley Street in time to hear Stinger\u0027s message, had checked with Mendoza and his grandmother, and then snagged Gunniston and Pequin. He nodded a greeting at Zarra, relieved to see his friend was still alive, then directed his attention to the colonel. Underneath the dust, Rick\u0027s skin had bleached a couple of shades but his eyes were hard and determined. \"That thing\u0027s got my sister! What are we going to do about it, mani\" \"Nothing,\" Rhodes said. \"I\u0027m sorry, but there\u0027s no - \" \"Yes there is!\" Rick had shouted it. \"I\u0027m not letting that bastard take Miranda!\" \"We\u0027re going into the ship and get them back,\" Jessie told him. \"Tom, Daufin, and me.\" \"Dream on.\" Rhodes wiped sweat out of his eyes. \"You go into those tunnels, there\u0027s no way anybody\u0027s coming back again. Hell, even if you did get to the ship, what would you use for weaponsi Maybe you could round up a few more guns, okay, but I don\u0027t think bullets are going to do Stinger much harm.\" \"We need electric lights.\" Daufin was aware of time ticking away. \"Strong ones.\" Tom said, \"We could take some of the lamps off the walls and figure a way to carry them. Maybe wire three or four of them together. Plus we\u0027ve got that.\" He motioned at the bull\u0027s-eye lantern. \"We\u0027ve got a whole lot more.\" Rick turned to Pequin. \"You hung around with Sonny Crowfield, didn\u0027t youi Did you know about the arsenali\" \"What arsenali\" \"Don\u0027t play dumb, man! I found all those guns and shit in Crowfield\u0027s closet! What was he about to tryi\" Pequin started to deny it again, but he knew Rick would see the lie. \"Sonny... was gonna start a war with the \u0027Gades. Gonna make it look like the \u0027Gades were burnin\u0027 down houses in Bordertown.\" \"But they weren\u0027ti\" \"No. I was with him when he set the fires.\" Pequin shrugged. \"We wanted some action, that\u0027s all.\" \"I want to know about the dynamite.\" Pequin stared at the floor. He could smell the blood that was spattered over the front of Rick\u0027s shirt. \"Sonny, me and Paco LeGrande went over the fence into the mine, couple of months ago. Just screwin\u0027 around. We found the shed where they used to keep the dynamite. We thought the place was just full of empty boxes at first, but Paco stepped on a loose board and his foot went through. We found the sticks in the dirt underneath, so we put \u0027em in a box and brought \u0027em out.\" \"To do whati Blow up somebody\u0027s house over herei\" \"No.\" Pequin smiled sheepishly, showing his silver tooth. \"To blow this place up, when the war started.\" \"There are five sticks of dynamite - with caps and fuses - in Sonny Crowfield\u0027s house over in Bordertown,\" Rick said to Colonel Rhodes. \"and more guns and ammo too. Sonny\u0027s one of those things now: there\u0027s a hole in the floor, and how far down it goes I don\u0027t know.\" \"Where is this housei\" Daufin asked. \"On Third Street.\" Like she would really know where that was, he thought. \"Right next to where the spaceship\u0027s sitting.\" \"That would be the nearest way into the ship, with the least distance of tunnel to go through,\" she said. \"Dy-na-mite.\" Her memory found the definition: an explosive compound usually formed into a cylinder and detonated by lighting a fuse. \"What does it look likei\" \"Like a ticket to hell, if you ain\u0027t careful,\" Curt replied. He drew on his cigarette and held it up. \"Kinda like that, only bigger. Meaner too.\" He crushed the butt out on the floor. \"You got capped and fused dynamite lyin\u0027 around untended for God knows how long, you\u0027re askin\u0027 to get blown to smithereens.\" \"Some of the sticks looked burned,\" Rick said. \"Like they\u0027d been lit before but hadn\u0027t gone off.\" \"Duds. a dud sometimes don\u0027t stay a dud, though. You can\u0027t tell about dynamite - especially not that cheap shit ol\u0027 man Preston shipped in. That stuff might go if you looked at it cross-eyed, or then again you might burn it with a flamethrower and it\u0027d just sit there and sputter.\" Daufin didn\u0027t follow most of what the man had said, but she knew even a crude explosive might be useful. \"We\u0027ll need rope,\" she said to Rick. \"We can get plenty of that at the hardware store. and there\u0027s wire to tie the lamps together too.\" \"Then that\u0027s where we should go first.\" Tom moved to the wall and lifted one of the battery lamps off its hook. \"Get ourselves organized and go from there.\" \"You mean get yourselves screwed up and slaughtered!\" The power of Rhodes\u0027s shout silenced everyone. \"My God, you\u0027re going at this thing like scouts on a field trip!\" He advanced on Tom Hammond and gripped the rifle. \"What are you going to do when something with metal claws comes out of the ground and grabs your guni Or your throati You\u0027ll wind up either getting slashed to pieces or blowing everybody else up! Will that get Stevie back for youi\" He glared at Daufin. \"Will that get you homei\" \"Man, if you haven\u0027t got any balls just stay here!\" Rick told him. \"You\u0027ll be the first to get your balls torn off,\" Rhodes said. He held Rick\u0027s stare for a couple of seconds, and then he pulled at the rifle. Tom resisted him. The colonel\u0027s face was gray, his eyes deep-sunken, but there was still a lot of strength in his grip and some of his fire had returned. \"First,\" he said, \"you need a leader.\" \"I can lead them,\" Daufin asserted. \"Not in the body of a little girl, you can\u0027t. Not in a body you don\u0027t own. Maybe you know a hell of a lot I don\u0027t, but flesh is flesh and if it gets flayed off there\u0027ll be nothing for Stevie to come back to.\" He pulled harder at the rifle. \"Give it to me. With the lights and the dynamite, we might have a chance. Might, I said.\" Fear of those tunnels and the things that would be waiting in them clawed at his stomach, but Daufin was right: they had to try. \"I\u0027ll lead you.\" Gunniston said instantly, \"I\u0027m going too, sir.\" \"Negative. If I don\u0027t come out, you\u0027ll be needed to brief Colonel Buckner. You\u0027re staying here.\" The other man started to protest. \"That\u0027s an order,\" Rhodes emphasized, and Gunniston remained silent. Tom gave up the rifle. \"all right.\" Rhodes looked around at the others. \"If Daufin\u0027s right about the time factor, we\u0027ve got to get moving. Who else is going besides Jessie and Ricki\" Bobby Clay Clemmons backed against the wall. Zarra started to speak, but Rick cut him short: \"You\u0027re staying. You take care of Paloma, understandi\" He waited until Zarra nodded. \"Mr. Locketti\" Rhodes asked. On the floor, Curt had taken a picture out of his pants pocket, unfolded it, and now stared fixedly at the girl\u0027s face. He didn\u0027t answer Rhodes, and a shadow lay across his eyes. \"That\u0027s it, then. We need to round up some more lamps and flashlights. Let\u0027s get to it,\" he said, before good sense could overrule his decision. Curt stayed where he was as the others left. Rick paused to untie the strip of sheet, draw it as tightly as he could bear, and then knot it again. The pain was a deep, pulsing ache but no bones had been broken. He said, \"You\u0027re Cody Lockett\u0027s fatheri\" \"Yeah.\" Curt refolded the photograph and put it away. \"Cody\u0027s my son.\" \"We\u0027ll get him out of there. Him and my sister both.\" Rick saw the hogleg Colt on the table and picked it up. \"This yoursi\" \"Yes.\" \"Mind if I take iti\" Curt said, \"Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,\" and fresh sweat sparkled on his face. He closed his eyes for a few seconds; when he opened them, the same old world was still there, and he thought he could feel it spinning on its axis like a runaway carnival ride. He had a thirst like a chunk of sun lodged down his throat. He stood up, a sneer warping his mouth. \"The day I let a wetback kid do my job is the day I\u0027m not fit to be pissed on,\" he said, and his hand closed around the Colt.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-54.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
