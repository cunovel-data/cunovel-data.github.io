{"id":83396,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"In the seven minutes since Daufin had left Cody Lockett, she\u0027d seen no other humans on the streets of Inferno. She had gone back to the house of Tom, Jessie, and Ray, and though the doorway was unlocked, the abode was empty of life. She tried the doors of two other abodes, found the door to the first sealed and the second house also empty. The murk was getting thicker, and Daufin found that human eyes had a radically limited field of vision. The brown haze made her host eyes sting and water, and she could see less than forty feet in all directions as she continued along Celeste Street in search of help. Two lights were coming through the smoke. Daufin stopped, waiting for them to get closer. She could hear an engine: the crude, combustion-powered conveyance called a car. But the car slowed and turned to the right before it reached her, and she saw the red smears of its taillights drawing rapidly away. She ran after it, crossing the sandy plot of earth where she\u0027d hidden under the protective shell and met the Sarge Dennison creature. another set of headlights passed on Celeste Street, going east, but the vehicle was moving too fast for Daufin to catch and by that time she\u0027d reached Cobre Road. She kept running in the direction of the first car she\u0027d seen and in another moment she saw the red points of the taillights again, just up the street. The car wasn\u0027t moving, but the engine still rumbled. She approached it, saw that the vehicle\u0027s doors were open but no one was in sight. a little rectangle fixed to the back of the car had letters on it: CaDe-I. It was parked in front of a structure with shattered light apertures - \"windows,\" she knew they were termed - and the doorway hung open as well. a square with writing above the doorway identified the structure as INFeRNO HaRDWaRe. \"Place has been ripped off,\" Rick said to Zarra as they stood at the rear of the store. He\u0027d found a flashlight and batteries, and he shone its beam into the broken glass counter where the pistols had been locked up. Out of an assortment of eight guns on display, not one remained. \"Somebody cleaned Mr. Luttrell out.\" He pointed the light at the racks where six rifles had been; they were gone, hacked right out of their locks by an ax or machete. Boxes of ammunition had been stolen from the storage shelves, and only a few cartridges gleamed in the light. \"So much for findin\u0027 a piece, man,\" Zarra said. \"Let\u0027s get our butts across the bridge.\" \"Hold on. Mr. Luttrell keeps a pistol in his office.\" Rick started back, through a swinging door into the storeroom, and Zarra followed the light. The office was locked, but Rick bashed open the door with two kicks and went to the manager\u0027s paper-cluttered desk. The drawers were locked too. He went out to the storeroom, found a box of screwdrivers, and returned to the job at hand. He and Zarra levered the drawers open with screwdrivers, and in the bottom drawer, under a pile of dog-eared Playboy magazines, was a loaded .38 pistol and an extra box of bullets. at the clinic Rick and Zarra had listened to Colonel Rhodes\u0027s story about the two spaceships and the creatures called Daufin and Stinger. Rick could still feel the slick scales of that thing\u0027s tail around his throat, and damned if he was going to go back to Bordertown without a gun. The Fang of Jesus paled before Smith \u0026 Wesson firepower. \"Let\u0027s go, man!\" Zarra urged nervously. \"You got what you came for!\" \"Right.\" Rick left the office with Zarra right behind him. They went through the storeroom door again, and suddenly from the front of the store there was a crash and clatter that almost made their hearts seize up. Zarra gave a little moan of terror, and Rick snapped the .38\u0027s safety off and cocked it. He probed around with the light, following the beam with the gun barrel. He couldn\u0027t see anyone. Somebody in here after guns, just like us, he thought. He hoped. \"Who\u0027s therei\" he said. Something moved to his left. He swung the light in that direction, toward shelves where coils of rope and wire were kept. \"I\u0027ve got a gun!\" he warned. \"I\u0027ll shoot your damned - \" He stopped speaking when the light found her. She was standing there holding a coil of rope between both hands. a bundle of copper wire had fallen off the shelf, upsetting a display of jars of nails. She was wearing just what Colonel Rhodes had said: a dusty Jetsons T-shirt and blue jeans, and her face was that of Mr. Hammond\u0027s child. except behind that face, according to Rhodes, was an alien called Daufin and this was the little girl the thing in Cade\u0027s autoyard was looking for. \"Don\u0027t move.\" His throat clogged up. His heart was beating so hard he could hear the blood roaring in his ears. \"I\u0027ve got a gun,\" he repeated, and his gunhand trembled. \"Cody Lockett needs help,\" Daufin said calmly, squinting into the harsh light. Her memory banks found the term gun and identified it as a primitive percussion-cap weapon. She could tell from the human\u0027s voice that he was terrified, so she stood very still. \"It\u0027s her,\" Zarra whispered. His legs were about to fold up. \"Oh Christ, it\u0027s her!\" \"What are you doing in herei\" Rick asked, and kept his finger on the trigger. \"I saw your vehicle. I followed you,\" Daufin explained. \"Cody Lockett is in need of help. Will you come with mei\" It took a few seconds for him to register what she\u0027d said. \"What\u0027s happened to himi\" \"He fell. To below.\" \"Below wherei\" She remembered the name Cody Lockett had called into the house, and pronounced it with difficulty: \"Mrs. Stell-en-berg\u0027s abode. I\u0027ll guide you there.\" \"No way!\" Zarra said. \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 back to Bordertown! Right, Ricki\" The other boy didn\u0027t answer. He wasn\u0027t exactly sure where Lockett was, but the creature seemed to be saying that he\u0027d fallen under a house. \"Do you know how far down he isi\" \"Thirteen-point-six earth feet. an approximate calculation, plus or minus three inches.\" \"Oh.\" \"By visuals I calculate this tether to be fifteen earth feet in length.\" She struggled to lift up the heavy coil of rope she\u0027d dragged off a shelf. The muscles of the daughter\u0027s arms strained with the weight. \"Will you help mei\" \"Forget Lockett, man!\" Zarra objected. \"Let\u0027s get back to our own people!\" Daufin didn\u0027t understand the tone of refusal. \"Is Cody Lockett not one of your owni\" \"No,\" Rick said. \"He\u0027s a \u0027Gade, and we\u0027re Rattler - \" He stopped, realizing how dumb that must sound to somebody from another planet. \"He\u0027s different,\" \"Cody Lockett is a human being. You are human beings. What is the differencei\" \"Our kind lives across the river,\" Zarra said. \"That\u0027s where we\u0027re goin\u0027.\" He walked on along the aisle toward the door, paused in the doorway when he saw Rick wasn\u0027t following. \"Come on, man!\" Rick kept the flashlight on the little girl\u0027s face. She stared fixedly at him, waiting for his response. Cody Lockett was nothing to him, but still... it seemed like they were all in this together, and the violet skygrid had caged both Renegades and Rattlers alike. \"Please,\" Daufin implored. He sighed and lowered the .38. \"You go on back to the church,\" he told Zarra. \"Tell Paloma I\u0027m okay.\" \"You\u0027re off your bird! Lockett wouldn\u0027t do shit for you!\" \"Maybe he wouldn\u0027t, but I\u0027m not Lockett. Go ahead, take the car. I\u0027ll come when I can.\" Zarra started to protest again, but he knew that once Rick\u0027s mind was made up, he couldn\u0027t be swayed. \"Damn stupid!\" he muttered, then, in a louder voice: \"You watch your ass. Got iti\" \"Got it,\" Rick answered, and Zarra went out to Cade\u0027s Mercedes, got in, and wheeled it toward the bridge. \"Okay,\" Rick said to Daufin when the Mercedes was gone and it was too late for second thoughts. \"Take me to him.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-39.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
