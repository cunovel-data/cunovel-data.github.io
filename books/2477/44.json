I swear to God, when that thing hit, it lifted this whole block and me off my feet too, so you know it must\u0027ve packed a punch!\" Then she\u0027d given that giggly laugh of hers - the laugh that had made her so popular when she was a slim-waisted Preston High School cheerleader - and bustled off to fix Tyler and Bess cold hamburgers.\n \"Tyi Here y\u0027go.\" Bess had come out and offered her husband a glass of iced tea. The tea had been made that morning, which was a good thing because the faucets wouldn\u0027t pull up a drop of water. \"That\u0027s the last of the ice cubes.\" They were small half-moons, and everything in the refrigerator was thawing out quick in this sullen heat.\n \"Thanks, hon.\" He rubbed the cold glass over his sweating face, sipped at the tea, and gave it back to her when she\u0027d sat down on the edge of the porch next to him. She drank with a deep thirst. Off in the desert a chorus of coyotes howled, their voices jagged and nervous. Tyler watched the road.\n They\u0027d decided that when the spacemen came, they would die right here, defending their home. The air-force people had been wandering all over the place before the sun went down, scooping up little fragments of blue-green metal and putting them in weird bags that folded up like accordians. Where were the air-force men nowi\n Tyler and Bess had driven their pickup west along Cobre Road. a little less than half a mile had cranked off the odometer before they\u0027d come to where the violet grid had entered the earth and blocked their way. around the grid\u0027s glowing prongs Cobre Road\u0027s asphalt was still bubbling. Tyler had thrown a handful of sand into the grid, and little grains of molten glass had come back at them.\n \"Well,\" Tyler drawled, laying the rifle across his knees, \"I never thought there\u0027d come a time when you couldn\u0027t see the stars out here. I reckon progress has caught up with us, huhi\" She started to answer, but could not. She was a tough old bird, and she hadn\u0027t cried for a long time. There were tears in her eyes now, and her throat had constricted. Tyler eased an arm around her. \"Kind of a pretty light, though,\" he said. \"If you like purple.\" \"I hate it,\" she managed.\n \"Can\u0027t say I cotton to it much, either.\" His voice was soft, but he was mulling over some hard questions. He didn\u0027t know how they would come, or when, but he didn\u0027t mean to give up without one hell of a fight. He was going to drill as many as he could, and go down fighting like Davy Crockett at the alamo. But the worst question gnawed at him: should he save a bullet for Bess, or noti\n He was thinking about it, his gaze on the road, when he heard a woman scream. He looked at Bess. They stared at each other for a second. The woman\u0027s scream came again.\n They both realized what it was at the same time. Not the scream of a woman, but the shrieking of Sweetpea, back in the barn.\n \"Get a flashlight! Hurry!\" he told her, and as she ran inside he sprinted on his wiry legs off the porch and around the house. The barn was about thirty yards back, next to Bess\u0027s cactus garden. He heard the frantic thump of Sweetpea\u0027s hooves hitting the sides of his stall, and Tyler\u0027s palms were wet around the rifle. Something was at the horse.\n He threw back the crossbeam and hauled the doors open. everything was as dark as sin in there. The big palomino was still screaming, about to bash the boards loose. Tyler shouted, \"Whoa there, Sweetpea! Settle down, boy!\" but the horse was going wild.\n Tyler\u0027s first thought was that a sidewinder or scorpion must\u0027ve gotten into the stall - but suddenly there was a cracking noise and the barn\u0027s floor shook under his boots.\n Sweetpea grunted as if he had been kicked in the belly. There followed a thrashing, panicked sound coupled with Sweetpea\u0027s high screams. Tyler looked over his shoulder, saw Bess running with a flashlight\u0027s beam spearing ahead. She gave it to him, and he aimed it at the horse\u0027s stall.\n The palomino was sunk up to his flanks in the sandy earth, broken floorboards jutting up around him. Sweetpea\u0027s eyes were red with terror, and foam snorted from his nostrils as he fought. His hind legs had disappeared into the hole, the front legs pawing at the air. Muscles rippled along his body as he tried to tear loose from whatever was pulling him through the barn floor.\n Tyler gasped, the sense knocked out of him. The horse sank another two feet, and the barn echoed with Sweetpea\u0027s cries.\n \"The rope!\" Bess shouted, and reached for the lariat coiled near the door. There was a slipknot already on it, and she widened the noose, swung the rope twice around to play it out, and let fly for Sweetpea\u0027s head. Her aim was off by six inches, and she quickly reeled it back to try again as the horse was jerked down to his shoulders in a spray of sand.\n On the next attempt, the rope slipped over Sweetpea\u0027s skull and tightened around the base of the neck. The rope pulled taut between them, started smoking a raw groove through Bess\u0027s hands. Tyler dropped the rifle, wedged the flashlight into the joint of two beams, and grabbed the rope, but both he and Bess were wrenched off their feet and dragged across the splintery floor. Sweetpea disappeared into the earth up to his throat.\n Tyler struggled up, the rope entwined around his hands and his shoulder muscles popping. He planted his boots and fought it, his fingers turning blue, but he was being pulled steadily toward the stall. Now only Sweetpea\u0027s muzzle was still visible, and the sand was starting to slide over it.\n \"No!\" Tyler yelled, and heaved backward on the rope so hard the raw flesh of his fingers split open like blood-gorged sausages. The sand eddied around like a whirlpool, there was a last feeble thrashing, and Sweetpea was gone.\n But the rope continued to be drawn downward by a tremendous strength. Bess grabbed her husband\u0027s waist, and they went to the floor again. \"Let go!\" Bess screamed, and Tyler opened his bloody fingers but the rope was tangled around his hands.\n Bess held on, splinters piercing her arms and legs. Tyler was trying to shake the rope loose, and they were almost pulled under the railing into Sweetpea\u0027s stall before he felt the tension go slack.\n Tyler lay on his belly, tears of pain crawling down his cheeks. Bess rolled over on her side, softly moaning.\n He sat up, forced his hands to close around the rope and started pulling it from the depths. \"Bess, bring the light,\" he told her, and she silently went to get it.\n The rope came up, foot after foot. Bess retrieved the flashlight. Its bulb had dimmed, in need of a fresh battery. She pointed it toward the empty stall.\n Tyler walked into the stall, continuing to draw the rope up. It was wet, and glistened in the murky light. everything was dreamlike to him, this couldn\u0027t possibly be real, and in a minute or so he would awaken to Bess\u0027s call that breakfast was on the table. He sank to his knees beside the broken floorboards and watched the rope slither from the sand.\n Its other end emerged. Tyler picked it up. Held it toward the light. Strands of thick gray ooze dripped from the ragged edge.\n \"Looks like... it\u0027s been sawed clean through,\" he said.\n and a shape came corkscrewing up in a whirl of sand, so fast Tyler had no time to react.\n a pair of jaws opened. Silver-blue needles snapped shut on Tyler\u0027s throat.\n The flat, reptilian head flailed viciously from side to side, the needle teeth ripping through tissue and arteries. Tyler\u0027s mouth filled with blood. He realized that the rope had not been sawed; it had been chewed.\n That was his last thought, because with the next savage twist the creature broke his neck. It kept twisting, and Tyler\u0027s head with its bulging, sightless eyes began to crack from the spinal column.\n Bess screamed, dropped the flashlight as her hands pressed to her mouth. She saw what the creature was: a large dog - a Doberman concocted from a madman\u0027s nightmare. Instead of hair, its hide was covered with leathery, interlocking scales, and beneath it the knots of muscle bunched and rippled.\n Its amber eyes found her. The thing gave Tyler\u0027s neck one last ferocious shake and began to stretch its jaws impossibly wide, like the unhinging jaws of a snake. It flung the dead man aside.\n Bess backpedaled, tripped, and fell on her tailbone. The monster scrabbled up over the top board of Sweetpea\u0027s stall, dropped to the floor, and advanced on her, its mouth trailing Tyler\u0027s blood.\n The Winchester had tripped her up. Her legs were lying across it. She swung the rifle up and started shooting at the approaching shape. One bullet furrowed across its skull, a second entered its shoulder, a third slammed into its ribs. But then it was upon her, and its mouthful of needles clamped shut on her face.\n She kept fighting. Her finger continued to spasm on the Winchester\u0027s trigger, sending bullets through the walls while the other fist beat at the thing\u0027s scaly hide. She was a Texas woman, and she didn\u0027t give up easily.\n The issue was settled in another five seconds. Bess\u0027s skull broke with a noise like that of a clay jar cracking, and rows of needle teeth sawed into her brain.\n Blood ran through the hay. The monster released the crushed mass and turned upon the flashlight, tearing it to pieces with teeth and metal-nailed claws. Then it crouched in the darkness, belly to the floor, and listened eagerly for the sounds of any other humans nearby; there were none, and the thing gave a low grunt of what might have been disappointment. It climbed back into Sweetpea\u0027s stall and began to dig down through the sand where the horse had gone. The monster\u0027s front and hind legs moved in a blur of synchronized power, and in another moment it had burrowed into the earth and the sand shifted over it like a whisper. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-44.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
