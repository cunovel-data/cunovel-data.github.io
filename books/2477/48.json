You know he\u0027ll do it if we don\u0027t give you over.\" \"If we do give her up,\" Jessie said, \"it\u0027s not just our child\u0027s body we\u0027re talking about. If Stinger gets back to his masters and tells them about us, they\u0027ll come here with an invasion fleet.\" \"I can\u0027t think about that right now!\" Rhodes ran his forearm across his face. The apartment was thick with heat, and smoke was creeping in through the cracked-open window. \"all I know is, Stinger wants Daufin. If we don\u0027t hand her over in less than seven minutes, a lot of people are going to die!\" \"and more people are going to die if we do!\" She caught the faintest breeze, and offered her throat to it.\n Daufin was staring out the window into the haze. There: she felt it again. a cold current of power. She knew what it was: a seeker beam from Stinger\u0027s ship, probing for the lifepod. It had passed on now, continuing its slow rotation across Inferno. Daufin\u0027s host skin prickled in its wake. The pod had its own natural defense system that would deflect the beam for a short time, but Daufin had learned enough about Stinger\u0027s technology to know that sooner or later the seeker would pinpoint its target.\n \"What\u0027s Stinger going to makei Do you knowi\" Rhodes asked her.\n She shook her head. Death and destruction crowded into her brain; she saw this lifepod called Inferno ablaze and crushed - if not by Stinger, then by the House of Fists. She glimpsed a fragment of the force field, glowing through the clouds of smoke, then her view was obscured again. She knew that many innocents were about to die, and too many had already perished because of her. The old rage seethed inside her. She saw the towers of her city crack and fall, saw mangled bodies spinning in the debris. The same brutality was about to happen here. \"I must exit this world,\" Daufin said. \"I\u0027ve got to get home.\" \"There\u0027s no way!\" Rhodes countered. \"We told you: earth doesn\u0027t have interstellar vehicles!\" \"You\u0027re incorrect.\" Daufin\u0027s voice was quiet, and she continued to stare to the southwest, in the direction of Mack Cade\u0027s autoyard.\n \"Do you know something I don\u0027ti\" \"There is an interstellar vehicle on earth.\" Her eyes shone as if brilliant with fever. \"Stinger\u0027s ship.\" \"What good will that do youi\" \"I\u0027m going to take Stinger\u0027s ship,\" she answered. \"That\u0027s how I\u0027m going to get home.\"\n as the voice of a warrior came from a little girl\u0027s throat, Cody guided the motorcycle to the curb where Rick directed him. Sonny Crowfield lived alone in a gray clapboard shack on the edge of Cade\u0027s autoyard, and Cody drove up onto a trash-strewn yard and stopped with the headlight aimed at the closed front door. The house\u0027s porch sagged, the windows were broken out, and the place appeared deserted - but then again, so did the other houses on Third Street. Cody cut the engine but left the headlight burning. Rick got off, withdrew the .38, and walked to the bottom of the porch\u0027s three cinder-block steps before he realized Cody wasn\u0027t with him.\n \"I said I\u0027d come with you,\" Cody told him. \"I didn\u0027t say I\u0027d go in.\" \"Muchas gracias.\" Rick snapped the pistol\u0027s safety off and started up the steps. He rapped on the door with the barrel. \"Hey, Crowfield! It\u0027s Rick Jurado!\" No one came to the door. Cody shifted uneasily in his seat and glanced around. The pyramid stood to his right; he could see its vague, violet-washed outline through the murk.\n \"answer up, Sonny!\" Rick called. He knocked with his fist - and suddenly the door fell in with a scream of splintered wood and hung by one hinge. Rick jumped back, and Cody\u0027s hand leapt to the baseball bat.\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s home,\" Cody said.\n Rick peered inside, could see nothing. \"You got a lighti\" \"Forget it, man! Crowfield\u0027s gone!\" \"You got a light or noti\" Rick asked, and waited. Cody snorted and dug his Zippo lighter out of his pocket. He flipped it to Rick, and the other boy caught it. Rick popped the flame up and started to cross the threshold.\n \"Watch your step!\" Cody warned. \"I don\u0027t want to be pullin\u0027 you up on a rope!\" \"Front room\u0027s got a floor,\" Rick said, and he went in.\n The house had a cemetery smell. The lighter\u0027s flame told Rick why: skeletons hung on the cracked walls. The bones had belonged to vultures, armadillos, coyotes, and snakes, and they were all over the place. He followed the flame through the front room into a hallway where bat and owl skeletons dangled on wires. He\u0027d heard about Crowfield\u0027s \"collection\" from Pequin, but he\u0027d never been here before and he was glad he hadn\u0027t. He came to another room off the corridor and thrust the lighter into the doorway.\n \"Shit,\" he whispered. Most of the room\u0027s floor had collapsed into darkness.\n He walked carefully to the edge of the broken floorboards and looked down. He couldn\u0027t see a bottom, but the light glinted off something lying a few feet to his left, up against the wall\u0027s baseboard. He reached for it, and found a copper-jacketed bullet in his hand. and there were more of them: nine or ten bullets, lying on the other side of the hole. If Crowfield had bullets, there must be a gun around here, Rick thought. There was a closet within reach, and he opened it.\n The lighter was beginning to scorch his hand, but the flame revealed another of Crowfield\u0027s collections: inside the closet, amid half-assembled skeletons and plastic bags full of assorted bones, were two rifles, four boxes of ammunition, a rusty .45 pistol, a case of empty Coke bottles, and two red tin cans. Rick caught the reek of gasoline. Sonofabitch had an arsenal, he realized. There were other items too: a bayonet, a couple of hunting knives, some of those morningstar blades that karate fighters threw, and a camouflage tarpaulin. Rick moved the tarp aside, and underneath was a small wooden box. He bent down. In faded red letters on the box was written DaNGeR! HIGH eXPLOSIVeS! PROPeRTY OF PReSTON COPPeR MINING COMPaNY.\n He lifted the lid - and instantly pulled the lighter\u0027s flame back.\n Nestled in waxed paper inside were five mustard-yellow sticks, each about nine inches long. The dynamite sticks had fuses of varying lengths, the longest maybe twelve inches and the shortest four inches. a couple of the sticks were scorched like hot dogs that had cooked too long on a grill, and Rick figured they were duds that had failed to ignite the first time around. How they\u0027d ended up here he didn\u0027t know, but it was obvious that Sonny Crowfield had been getting ready to wage war - maybe on the Renegades, or maybe to take over the Rattlesnakes. He looked again at the Coke bottles and the gasoline tins. easy to make a firebomb that way, he thought. easy to set fire to a house or two and let the \u0027Gades take the blame, try to stir up a war so all this firepower could be useful.\n \"Sonofabitch,\" Rick said. He let the lid drop back and stood up. a little plastic bag fell open, and rat bones spilled out.\n Outside, Cody felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle - and just that quick he knew someone was behind him. He looked over his shoulder.\n Sonny Crowfield was standing at the curb, eyes like dead black stones, mouth a thin gray gash, and the face damp and pallid. \"I know you.\" The voice sounded like a warped, slowed-down recording of the real Crowfield. \"You gave me some pain, man.\" The figure took a step forward. Its grin widened, and now Cody could see the rows of needle teeth. \"I want to show you somethin\u0027 real pretty. You\u0027ll like it.\" The metal-nailed hand reached out.\n Cody stomped down on the kickstarter. The engine rattled, backfired, but wouldn\u0027t catch.\n The hand glided toward him. \"Come on, man. Let me show you what I\u0027ve made.\" another stomp, with all of Cody\u0027s strength behind it. The engine coughed and fired, and as the fingers started to clench into his shoulder Cody twisted the throttle and shot the motorcycle up the cinder-block steps and through the doorway into Crowfield\u0027s house.\n The headlamp splayed onto Rick, who was just coming out of the corridor. He threw himself against a wall and a coyote skeleton fell off its hooks and crumpled to the floor. He shouted, \"What the hell are you doingi\" as Cody stopped the cycle just short of a collision.\n \"Get on!\" Cody shouted right back. \"Hurry!\" \"Get on! Whyi\" He thought Cody had tumbled into the Great Fried empty - and then a figure with long black hair filled up the doorway.\n \"Time\u0027s up,\" Stinger said, in its manufactured Sonny Crowfield voice.\n Rick lifted the .38 and fired twice, the gunshots deafening. Both bullets hit the creature\u0027s chest, and it grunted and stumbled back a step, then righted itself and stormed across the threshold again.\n \"Get on!\" Cody demanded, and Rick planted himself on the passenger seat. Cody guided the cycle into the corridor and powered up. Skeletons of flying things swung on wires over their heads. The Honda emerged from the corridor into a boxy kitchen, and Cody skidded it to a stop over the dirty yellow linoleum. He twisted the handlebars, seeking a way out with the headlight. \"Where\u0027s the back doori\" he yelled, but both of them saw that there was none, and the kitchen\u0027s single window was boarded up.\n \"Time\u0027s up! They didn\u0027t do what I told \u0027em!\" Stinger raged, in the darkness between the kitchen and the house\u0027s only door. \"Gonna smash some bugs!\" There was the noise of combat boots clumping through the corridor. \"I\u0027ll show you what I\u0027ve made! It\u0027s gonna be here real soon!\" Cody switched off the headlight, and now the darkness was complete.\n \"are you crazyi Keep the light on!\" Rick protested, but Cody was already turning the motorcycle in a tight circle so that they were aimed into the corridor.\n \"Hang on,\" Cody told him. He revved the engine, and it responded with a throaty roar. \"I want to be on him before the bastard knows what\u0027s hit him. If you fall off, you\u0027re dead meat. Got iti\" \"Got it.\" Rick clamped one arm around Cody\u0027s waist and kept his finger on the .38\u0027s trigger.\n The clump of boots was about halfway along the corridor. There were little rattling sounds: the thing\u0027s head and shoulders brushing skeletons.\n Three more steps, Cody thought. Got to hit that thing and keep on going. His palms were wet, and his heart was slamming like a Beastie Boys drumbeat. One more step.\n It came. The monster was almost in the kitchen. Cody revved the engine until it shrieked and released the brakes.\n The rear tire spun on the linoleum, and there was the smell of scorched plastic. But in the next instant the motorcycle reared up and shot forward on its back tire. Rick hung on, and Cody hit the headlight switch.\n Stinger was right there, framed in the corridor. The wet gray face convulsed as the light fell upon it, and both Rick and Cody saw the eyeballs smoke and retreat into their sockets. There was a roar of pain that shook the walls, and Stinger\u0027s hands rose up to shield the eyes; its body was already starting to curl up, the spinal cord bulging with the pressure of the spiked tail beneath it.\n The front tire hit the thing\u0027s face and the machine kept going over Stinger\u0027s body as if trying to claw its way out. Stinger went down to the floor. The motorcycle shuddered, careened to the side, and ricocheted off the wall, and the headlight\u0027s bulb blew out. Rick was lifted off his seat and almost lost hold of Cody, and something that no longer had a human shape was flailing wildly underneath the motorcycle.\n But then they had broken clear of it and Cody powered the Honda through the doorway and down the porch steps. They went across the yard in a spray of sand as Cody fought to turn the machine - and in front of them they saw the pavement of Third Street at the edge of Cade\u0027s autoyard start to crack apart and buckle upward. a shape was struggling up from the street. Cody got the cycle under control and skidded to a stop about ten feet from the emerging creation.\n \"Here it comes!\" a hunchbacked thing with a weaving tail rasped as it slithered down the steps of Crowfield\u0027s house. \"Gonna smash alllll the little bugs!\" \"Go!\" Rick shouted. Cody didn\u0027t have to be told twice. He couldn\u0027t tell what was digging itself out of the ground, but he didn\u0027t care for a closer look. He laid on the throttle and the motorcycle arrowed east. Behind them, Third Street broke open and Stinger\u0027s new creation began to crawl free. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-48.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
