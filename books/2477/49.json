{"id":83406,"no":49,"title":"Page 49","content":"Walking east on Celeste Street, Ray saw his shadow thrown before him by a single headlight, and he turned to wave down a ride. It was Tank\u0027s one-eyed truck, and it slowed to a stop in front of him. Tank was at the wheel, his face daubed green by the instrument panel, and Ray could make out Nasty sitting on the passenger side. Tank leaned his helmeted head through the window. \"You goin\u0027 up to the forti\" \"No. Home.\" \"Your folks are at the fort. So\u0027s most everybody else. Your sister too.\" \"Steviei They found heri\" \"Not exactly Stevie,\" Nasty told him. \"Come on, we\u0027re headed up there.\" She opened the door for him, and he slid in beside her. Tank put the gearshift into first and started forward, turning left onto Travis Street. The tires bounced roughly over fissures in the pavement. Tank stared grimly ahead, trying to see through the smoke by the remaining light. He and Nasty had gone to his parents\u0027 house on Circle Back Street and found the place leaning on its foundations, a hole in the den floor big enough to drive a tractor through. Of his mother and father there was no sign, but some kind of slimy stuff was streaked on the walls and carpet. \"They\u0027re probably all right,\" Nasty repeated for the third or fourth time. \"They probably went to a neighbor\u0027s house.\" Tank grunted. They\u0027d checked the other four houses on Circle Back Street; there\u0027d been no answer at three of them, and at the fourth old man Shipley had come to the door with a shotgun. \"Maybe they did,\" he said, but he didn\u0027t believe they\u0027d gotten out of the house alive. Ray shifted his position. The warmth of Nasty\u0027s thigh was burning into his leg. This would be one hell of a time to get a hard-on, and of course as soon as he thought about it the miraculous, unstoppable process began. Nasty looked at him, her face just a few inches away, and he thought, She can read my mind. Maybe it was because they were touching, and if he pulled away, she wouldn\u0027t know what he was thinking, but there was no room to maneuver in the cramped, greasy-smelling truck cab. \"You look different without your glasses,\" she decided. He shrugged. Couldn\u0027t help but notice how her breasts thrust against the thin cotton of her sweat-damp T-shirt. He could see the nipples, which didn\u0027t help his condition any. \"Not so different,\" he said. \"Yeah you do. Older.\" \"Maybe I just feel older.\" \"Hell, we all do,\" Tank said. \"I feel like I\u0027m ninety fuckin\u0027 years ol - \" He felt the truck shudder. The wheel trembled in his hands. He leaned forward, had seen something out in the haze, wasn\u0027t sure what it had been but his heart was jammed in his throat. \"What is iti\" Nasty asked him, her voice rising with alarm. He shook his head and started to plant his foot on the brake pedal. and that was when he saw the concrete of Travis Street buckle upward about fifteen feet in front of the pickup truck and rise like a gray wave. Something huge was moving just under the surface, as if swimming through Texas earth, and its motion lifted Tank\u0027s truck on the crest of the land wave, raised it amid chunks of broken and grinding pavement. Nasty screamed and gripped the dashboard, and Ray had his fingers on the door handle. as the truck angled sharply downward and slid off the concrete swell toward a sea of cracks, something rose up from a fissure and into the headlight\u0027s beam: a snaky coil as wide as the truck, covered with mottled greenish-gray scales. Then the coil went down as the creature dove deeper, spewing up a spray of red dirt and sand like the spume of a whale. The pickup truck turned sideways, and the wheel spun out of Tank\u0027s grip. The concrete was still in motion under the tires, splitting and separating, and as Tank threw his door open and started to jump the truck hit a jagged edge of pavement, heeled to the left, and crashed down on top of him. He made no sound of pain, but Ray heard the crack of his helmet breaking. The truck\u0027s weight continued to slide forward as the pavement settled, smearing Tank\u0027s body beneath it. and then the hood slid into a fissure that slammed down on it like a shark\u0027s jaws. Metal groaned and crumpled, sparks shot off the edges, and flames began to lick around the hood. It had only taken five or six seconds. Ray blinked, smelled burning oil and paint, and heard Nasty\u0027s wounded moaning. She was lying underneath him, half on and half off the seat. The earth was still trembling in the wake of the monster\u0027s passage, and metal shrieked as the truck sank deeper into the chasm. Something popped in the engine - a surprisingly gentle sound - and red tendrils of flame gnawed toward the shattered windshield. He felt the fearsome heat on his face, and he knew then that if they sat there much longer they were going to be fried. The truck sank down another three or four inches. He pulled himself up toward the passenger door and forced it open with the strength of the doomed, then he hung to the doorframe and reached down to Nasty. \"Take my hand! Come on!\" She looked up at him, and he could see the blood crawling out of her nostrils. He figured she must have banged her head against the dashboard when the truck had turned over. She was embracing the steering wheel with both arms. The truck lurched and slid down another couple of inches, and now the heat was getting savage. Ray shouted, \"Grab my hand!\" Nasty unhooked the fingers of her right hand from the wheel, wiped her nose, and stared at the blood. She made a half giggle, half moan, and Ray strained down and grasped her wrist. He tugged mightily at her. \"We\u0027ve got to get out!\" It took her a few precious seconds to register that fire was coming through the windshield and that Ray was trying to help her. She released her hold on the wheel and pushed herself up, pain thrumming through her skull from the knock she\u0027d taken to her forehead. Ray pulled her out of the pickup\u0027s battered cab, and they fell together to the broken concrete. Her body went limp, but Ray got to his feet and started hauling her up. \"Come on!\" he said. \"We can\u0027t stay here!\" \"Tank,\" she said, her voice slow and slurred. \"Where\u0027s Tanki He was right here just a minute ago.\" \"Tank\u0027s gone. Come on! Up!\" He got her to her feet, and though she was several inches taller, she leaned against his shoulder. He looked around, his eyes stinging from the smoke, and saw that Travis Street - at least the small section he could see of it - had become a ridged and gullied battlefield. Whatever that thing was, it had folded the concrete back and split it to pieces like a bone-dry riverbed. Flames bellowed around the truck. Ray didn\u0027t like the idea of staying so close to it; the thing might blow up or whatever had passed under the street might be drawn to the light. In any case, he craved some shelter. He pulled Nasty with him across the street, mindful of the cracks around them, the largest about three or four feet wide. \"Where\u0027d Tank goi\" she asked. \"He was drivin\u0027, wasn\u0027t hei\" \"Yeah. He went on ahead,\" was all he could think to say. The outline of a house came out of the murk, and Ray guided Nasty toward it. How far they were from the fort he didn\u0027t know, but he wasn\u0027t sure they\u0027d passed the intersection of Sombra and Travis, and that was a good hundred yards from the apartment building\u0027s parking lot. Just short of the house\u0027s porch steps, Ray felt the earth tremble: the creature passing somewhere close by. From the next street over came the splintering crash of a house being lifted off its foundations. They went up the steps. The front door was locked, but the nearest window was glassless and Ray reached into it, snapped the jamb\u0027s lock off, and pushed the window up. He slid in first, then helped Nasty through. She stumbled, her strength used up, pitched forward, and they both fell to the hardwood floor. Her mouth was right up against his ear, and she was breathing hard. any other time this would have been a fantasy come true, he thought - but his mind couldn\u0027t focus on sex at the moment, though her body was molded into his and her breasts pressed against his chest. God had a mighty wicked sense of humor, he decided. The house creaked at the joints. Under them the floor rolled like a slow wave, and cracks shot up the walls. along Travis Street the houses moaned as the creature tunneled beneath them, and Ray heard the scream of timbers caving in as a structure collapsed two or three houses away. Nasty, tough as nails and swigger of tobacco spit, was shivering. Ray put his arms around her. \"You\u0027re going to be all right,\" he said. His voice didn\u0027t quaver too much, which surprised him. \"I\u0027ll protect you.\" She lifted her head, looked at him face-to-face, and her eyes were scared and dazed but there was a grim hint of a smile on her mouth. \"My hero,\" she said, and then she let her head rest on his shoulder and they lay there in the dark as Inferno ripped apart at the seams. across the bridge, Cody skidded the cycle to a stop in front of the Catholic church, and Rick jumped off. He looked back along First Street, couldn\u0027t see anything through the haze. But that thing would be out of the ground by now, and probably heading this way. Zarra, Pequin, and Diego Montana had been waiting at the door for Rick\u0027s return, and now they came down the steps. Cody got off the Honda, looked at the church, and knew those people jammed in there wouldn\u0027t have a rat\u0027s ass of a chance. If electric light hurt Stinger - and the way the monster in Crowfield\u0027s house had reacted showed that Daufin was right - then there was only one safe place he could think of. \"We\u0027ve gotta move these people out before that thing gets here!\" Cody said to Rick. \"We\u0027re not gonna have much time!\" \"Move them! Wherei\" \"across the bridge. To the fort.\" all of them gaped at him as if he\u0027d gone totally off his bird. \"Forget that gang shit!\" he said, and felt as if the words split an old skin that had been shriveling tighter and tighter around him. He saw there were a lot of cars and pickups parked around the church, on both sides of the street, and most of them were broken-down heaps, but they could each carry five or six people. The pickup trucks could carry more. \"We get \u0027em loaded and out as fast as we can!\" he said. \"The fort\u0027s the only place Stinger won\u0027t try to dig into, because of the lights!\" Rick wasn\u0027t sure he believed that, but the apartment building was a lot sturdier than the church. He made his decision fast. \"Diego, where\u0027s your cari\" The boy pointed to a rusted brown Impala across the way. \"I want you to drive it up the street about fifty yards.\" He motioned west. \"Pequin, you go with him. Keep your lights on, and if you see anything or anybody coming, you haul ass back.\" Diego sprinted to the car, and Pequin started to protest, but he obeyed the order like a good soldier. \"Zarra, you get the Rattlers together. Tell them where we\u0027re going, and that we\u0027ll need all the cars we can find. I want every Rattler car loaded. Go!\" Zarra ran up the steps into the church. Rick turned to Cody. \"I want you to...\" He hesitated, realizing he was talking to the enemy just like he would a Rattler. \"I\u0027ll find Father LaPrado and start getting everybody out,\" he amended. \"I could use another scout.\" Cody nodded. \"I reckon so. I could use that gun on your hip too.\" Rick gave it to him, handle first, and Cody slid it into his waistband. \"Four bullets left,\" Rick said. \"Don\u0027t pull a John Wayne if you see it coming. Just get back here in one piece.\" \"Man, you like givin\u0027 orders, don\u0027t youi\" Cody stomped down on the kickstarter and the hot engine fired. He offered a sly smile. \"You just take care of your little sister. I\u0027ll be back.\" He turned the Honda around in a tight circle and sped west on First Street, and Rick ran up the steps into the sanctuary. Diego Montana\u0027s car was just creeping along, and Cody flashed by it about forty yards away from the church; he veered into the center of the headlights\u0027 beam but had to cut his speed to a glide as the Impala stopped and he outran the lights. The violet-tinged gloom closed around him, and he pulled to the curb to wait for his night vision to sharpen. at the church, Rick had convinced Father LaPrado that they had just a short time to evacuate almost three hundred people. The problem was how to do it without creating a panic, but there was no time to deliberate; Father LaPrado stood up before the congregation and explained in a voice as tough as brine-dipped leather that they had to leave quickly and everything they\u0027d brought - pillows, clothes, food, possessions - would have to remain behind. They would clear the aisles first, then leave row by row starting from the rear. everyone who had a car or truck should go to it and wait for it to be filled before driving off. They were heading across the bridge, he told them, to take shelter in the apartment building at the end of Travis Street. The evacuation started, and cars carrying Bordertown residents began crossing the Snake River Bridge. a hundred yards west, Cody wheeled the motorcycle into a dirt alley and drove through it onto Second Street. He cut the engine and coasted, listening. Could hear the noise of cars hightailing toward Inferno. Dark houses stood in the smoke, not a candle showing anywhere. Over toward Third Street a couple of dogs were howling. He guided the Honda over the curb and in between two houses, and there he stopped to listen again. His heartbeat drummed in his ears. He walked the motorcycle ahead, came out from between the houses - and froze when he saw a formless thing standing about ten feet in front of him. It didn\u0027t move, either. Cody was afraid to draw a breath. Slowly he pulled the .38 out and his thumb found the safety catch. Clicked it off. He lifted the gun, steadied his hand. The thing still didn\u0027t budge. He took a step closer, his finger lodged on the trigger, and that was when he realized he was aiming at a discarded washing machine standing in somebody\u0027s backyard. He almost laughed. Some John Wayne! He was glad none of the \u0027Gades were around to see this, or his reputation would be lower than ant pee. He was about to put the .38 away when he heard a slow, scraping noise. He tensed, stood rigid and stock-still. The sound repeated - metal across concrete, he thought it was - but where it was coming from he wasn\u0027t sure. Was it ahead, on Third Street, or behind him on Secondi He bellied down in the dust and crawled back into the space between the houses, and he lay there trying to pinpoint the sound\u0027s direction. The haze was playing tricks with him. The scraping noise was first ahead, then behind him. Was it moving toward him, or away: he couldn\u0027t be sure, and not knowing made his guts twist. Whatever it was, it sounded like something that was just learning how to walk and dragging its feet - or claws. The good part was that it was moving slowly and clumsily; the bad part was that it sounded heavy. He caught movement through the murk: a shape on Second Street, lumbering past Cody\u0027s hiding place. No damned washing machine this time. The sonofabitch was big and alive and it passed with a noise like razor blades scraping a chalkboard. The haze swirled around it and spun in its wake, and then whatever it was had gone on, striding inexorably toward the church. Cody gave it about ten more seconds, and then he scrambled up, got on the motorcycle, and started the engine; it roared like hellfire in the narrow space, and Cody gunned it toward Third Street, saw clothes flagging from a line, and ducked just in time to keep his head. He turned left on Third with a shriek of tires and rocketed east all the way to Republica Road. Then straight to the intersection of First Street again, where cars were turning toward the bridge. He took another left, deftly dodged a pickup truck full of people, and wound his way through the refugees to the steps of the church. Inside, Mendoza was helping Paloma Jurado along the aisle. Over a hundred people had already gone, and the cars had been leaving as fast as they could get packed. But only two cars and Mendoza\u0027s pickup truck were left, and it was clear a lot of people were going to have to make it on foot. \"Take my grandmother with you,\" Rick told him. He looked around, saw twenty more elderly people who couldn\u0027t make it over without a ride. His Camaro was still parked in front of his house on Second Street, and there wasn\u0027t time to go after it. \"You go with them,\" he said to Miranda, and motioned toward Mendoza. She\u0027d already grasped the situation. \"There\u0027s not enough room left for me.\" \"You can make room! Go!\" \"What about youi\" \"I\u0027ll find a way. Go on, take care of Paloma!\" She was about to follow Mendoza and her grandmother to the door when Cody Lockett came along the aisle. He glanced quickly at her, his face gray with dust except for the area around his eyes where the goggles had rested, then directed his attention to Rick. She saw that his swagger and cockiness had dissolved. \"It\u0027s headed this way,\" he said. \"I saw it on Second Street. I couldn\u0027t tell much about it, but the thing\u0027s huge.\" Rick saw Mendoza guiding Paloma out the door, with a few other old people in tow. It wouldn\u0027t take but a couple of minutes for Mendoza\u0027s truck to fill up. \"I said go!\" he snapped at Miranda. \"I\u0027m staying with you,\" she said. \"The hell you are! Come on!\" He grasped her arm, and she just as stubbornly pulled away. \"There you go, spoutin\u0027 out orders again,\" Cody said. \"You shut up!\" Rick looked around, trying to find a Rattler to help him, but the rest of them had already gone; Father LaPrado was herding the remaining thirty or so people out. a car horn began blaring in the distance, getting louder, and Rick knew what that meant: Diego and Pequin had seen something and were racing back. He pushed his way through the door and out to the steps, with Cody and Miranda following. The Impala had pulled up to the curb, and already people were jamming into it. Others had decided to run, and they were heading north toward the riverbank. Pequin got out of the car just as Rick reached the street. \"We saw somethin\u0027, man!\" Pequin pointed west, and his hand trembled. \"Out there, maybe thirty or forty yards!\" \"What\u0027d it look likei\" Cody asked him. Pequin shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know, man. We just saw somethin\u0027 movin\u0027 out there, and we hauled ass back! It\u0027s comin\u0027 this way!\" \"Rick, I\u0027m ready to go!\" Mendoza was behind the wheel of his pickup, with Paloma and his wife in the cab beside him. eight others were loaded into the truck bed. \"Bring your sister!\" \"When you go, I go,\" she told Rick before he could speak. He glanced into the haze to the west, then back to Mendoza. Time was ticking past, and the creature was getting closer. \"Take off!\" he said. \"I\u0027ll bring Miranda over myself!\" Mendoza nodded, waved a hand, and drove toward the bridge. Diego\u0027s car was jammed so full it was dragging the pavement, and the last car was loaded down too. More than eighty people were going north on foot. Diego put the Impala into reverse and it shot backward, throwing sparks off its hanging tailpipe. \"Wait for me, you bastard!\" Pequin shouted, running after him. \"Hey, Jurado,\" Cody said quietly, \"I think we\u0027ve got company.\" The haze swirled before the thing\u0027s approach. They could hear the scrape of metal on concrete. The last car, carrying seven or eight people and a couple hanging to the doors, backfired and sped away. The shape came out of the smoke and lurched into the candlelight that streamed from the church\u0027s windows.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-49.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
