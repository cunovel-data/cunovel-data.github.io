{"id":83360,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Jessie Hammond awakened, as was her habit, about three seconds before the alarm clock buzzed on the bedside table. as it went off she reached out, her eyes still closed, and popped the alarm button down with the flat of her hand. She sniffed the air, could smell the inviting aromas of bacon and freshly brewed coffee. \"Breakfast\u0027s on, Jess!\" Tom called from the kitchen. \"Two more minutes.\" She burrowed her head into the pillow. \"Big minutes or little onesi\" \"Tiny ones. Minuscule.\" She rolled over to find a better position and caught his clean, pleasantly musky scent on the other pillow. \"You smell like a puppy,\" she said sleepily. \"Pardoni\" \"Whati\" She opened her eyes to the bright streamers of sunlight that hit the opposite wall through the window blinds and immediately shut them again. \"How about some lizard eyeballs in your eggs todayi\" Tom asked. He and Jessie had stayed up until well after one in the morning, talking and sharing a bottle of Blue Nun. But he\u0027d always been a quick starter and enjoyed cooking breakfast, while Jessie took a little longer to get her spark plugs going even on the best of days. \"Make mine rare,\" she answered, and tried seeing again. The early light was already glary, promising another scorcher. The past week had been one ninety-degree day after the next, and the Odessa weatherman on Channel 19 had said today might break the hundred mark. Jessie knew that meant trouble. animals weren\u0027t acclimated to such heat so soon. Horses would get sluggish and go off their feed, dogs would be surly and snap without cause, and cats would have major spells of claw-happy craziness. Stock animals got unruly too, and bulls were downright dangerous. But it was also rabies season, and her worst fear was that somebody\u0027s pet would go chasing after an infected jackrabbit or prairie dog, be bitten, and bring rabies back into the community. all the domesticated animals she could think of had already been given their boosters, but there were always a few folks who didn\u0027t bring their pets in for the treatment. It might be a good idea, she decided, to get in the pickup truck today and drive around to some of the small communities near Inferno - like Klyman, No Trees, and Notch Fork - to spread the antirabies gospel. \"\u0027Morning.\" Tom was standing over her, offering her coffee in a blue clay mug. \"This\u0027ll get you started.\" She sat up and took the mug. The coffee, as usual whenever Tom made it, was ebony and ominous. The first sip puckered her mouth; the second brooded on her tongue for a while, and the third sent the caffeine charging through her system. She needed it too. She\u0027d never been a morning person, but as the only veterinarian within a forty-mile radius she\u0027d learned a long time ago that the ranchers and farmers were up long before the sun first blushed the sky. \"Smooth,\" she managed to say. \"always is.\" Tom smiled slightly, walked over to the window, and pushed aside the blinds. Red fire hit his face and glowed in the lenses of his eyeglasses. He looked east, along Celeste Street toward Republica Road and Preston High School - \"the Hotbox,\" he called it, because the air conditioning broke down so often. His smile began to fade. She knew what he was thinking. They\u0027d talked about it last night, and many nights before that one. The Blue Nun eased, but it did not heal. \"Come here,\" she said, and motioned him to the bed. \"Bacon\u0027ll get cold,\" he answered. His accent was the unhurried drawl of east Texas, whereas Jessie\u0027s was west Texas\u0027s gritty twang. \"Let it freeze.\" Tom turned away from the window, could feel the hot stripes of sun across his bare back and shoulders. He wore his faded and comfortable khaki trousers, but he hadn\u0027t yet pulled on his socks and shoes. He passed under the bedroom\u0027s lazily revolving ceiling fan, and Jessie leaned over in her pale blue, oversized shirt and patted the edge of the bed. When he sat down, she began massaging his shoulders with her strong brown hands. already his muscles were as tight as piano wire. \"It\u0027s going to work out,\" she told him, her voice calm and deliberate. \"This isn\u0027t the end of the world.\" He nodded, said nothing. The nod wasn\u0027t very convincing. Tom Hammond was thirty-seven years old, stood a bit over six feet, was slim and in pretty good shape except for a little potbelly that resisted sit-ups and jogging. His light brown hair was receding to show what Jessie called a \"noble forehead,\" and his tortoiseshell-framed glasses gave him the look of an intelligent if slightly dismayed schoolteacher. Which was exactly what he was: Tom had been a social studies teacher at Preston High for eleven years. and now, with the impending death of Inferno, that was coming to an end. eleven years of the Hotbox. eleven years of watching the faces change. eleven years, and still he hadn\u0027t defeated his worst enemy. It was still there, and it would always be there, and every day for eleven years he\u0027d seen it working against him. \"You\u0027ve done everything you could,\" Jessie said. \"You know you have.\" \"Maybe. Maybe not.\" One corner of his mouth angled downward in a bitter smile, and his eyes were pinched with frustration. a week from tomorrow, when school closed, he and the other teachers would have no job. His resumes had brought in only one offer from the state of Texas - a field job, running literacy exams on immigrants who followed the melon crops. Still, he knew that most of the other teachers hadn\u0027t landed jobs yet either, but that didn\u0027t make the pill any sweeter going down. He\u0027d gotten a nice letter stamped with the state seal of Texas that told him the education budget had been cut for the second year in a row and at present there was a freeze on the hiring of teachers. Of course, since he\u0027d been in the system so long, his name would be put on the waiting list of applicants, thank you and keep this letter for your files. It was the same letter many of his colleagues had received, and the only file it went into was circular. But he knew that, eventually, another position would come his way. Running the exams on the migrant workers wouldn\u0027t be so bad, really, but it would require a lot of time on the road. What had chewed at him day and night for the past year was the memory of all the students who\u0027d passed through his social studies class - hundreds of them, from red-haired american sons to copper-skinned Mexicans to apache kids with eyes like bullet holes. Hundreds of them: doomed freight, passing through the badlands on tracks already warped. He\u0027d checked; over an eleven-year period with a senior class averaging about seventy to eighty kids, only three hundred and six of them had enrolled as freshmen in either a state or technical college. The rest had just drifted away or set roots in Inferno to work at the mine, drink their wages, and raise a houseful of babies who would probably repeat the pattern. Only now there was no mine, and the pull of drugs and crime in the big cities was stronger. It was stronger, as well, right here in Inferno. and for eleven years he\u0027d seen the faces come and go: boys with knife scars and tattoos and forced laughter, girls with scared eyes and gnawed fingernails and the secret twitches of babies already growing in their bellies. eleven years, and tomorrow was his final day. after the senior class walked out at last period, it would be over. and what haunted him, day after day, was the realization that he could recall maybe fifteen kids who\u0027d escaped the Great Fried empty. That was what they called the desert between Inferno and the Mexican border, but Tom knew it was a state of mind too. The Great Fried empty could suck the brains out of a kid\u0027s skull and replace it with dope smoke, could burn out the ambition and dry up the hope, and what almost killed Tom was the fact that he\u0027d fought it for eleven years but the Great Fried empty had always been winning. Jessie kept massaging, but Tom\u0027s muscles had tensed. She knew what must be going through his mind. It was the same thing that had slowly burned his spirit to a cinder. Tom stared at the bars of fire on the wall. \"I wish I had three more months. Just three.\" He had a sudden, startling image of the day he and Jessie had graduated together from the University of Texas, walking out into a flood of sunlight and ready to take on the world. It seemed like a hundred years ago. He\u0027d been thinking a lot about Roberto Perez lately, could not get the boy\u0027s face out of his mind, and he knew why. \"Roberto Perez,\" he said. \"Do you remember me talking about himi\" \"I think so.\" \"He was in my senior class six years ago. He lived in Bordertown, and his grades weren\u0027t very high, but he asked questions. He wanted to know. But he held himself back from doing too well on tests, because that wouldn\u0027t be cool.\" His bitter smile surfaced again. \"The day he graduated, Mack Cade was waiting for him. I saw him get into Cade\u0027s Mercedes. They drove off. Roberto\u0027s brother told me later that Cade got the boy a job up in Houston. Good money, but it wasn\u0027t exactly clear what the job was. Then one day Roberto\u0027s brother came to me and said I ought to know: Roberto had been killed in a Houston motel. Cocaine deal went bad. He got both barrels of a shotgun in his stomach. But the Perez family didn\u0027t blame Cade. Oh, no. Roberto sent home a lot of money. Cade gave Mr. Perez a new Buick. Sometimes I drive by the Perez house after school; the Buick\u0027s up on concrete blocks in the front yard.\" He stood up abruptly, went to the window, and pulled the blinds aside again. He could feel the heat out there, gathering power and shimmering off the sand and concrete. \"There are two boys in my last-period class who remind me of Perez. Neither one of them ever made higher than a C-minus on a test, but I see it in their faces. They listen; something sinks in. But they both do just enough to get by, and no more. You probably know their names: Lockett and Jurado.\" He glanced at her. Jessie had heard Tom mention the names before, and she nodded. \"Neither of them took the college entrance exams,\" Tom continued. \"Jurado laughed in my face when I suggested it. Lockett looked at me like I fell out of a dog\u0027s ass. But their last day is tomorrow, and they\u0027ll graduate a week from Sunday, and that\u0027ll be it. Cade\u0027ll be waiting. I know it.\" \"You\u0027ve done what you could,\" Jessie said. \"Now it\u0027s up to them.\" \"Right.\" He stood for a moment framed in crimson light, as if on the rim of a blast furnace. \"This town,\" he said softly. \"This damned, godforsaken town. Nothing can grow here. I swear to God, I\u0027m beginning to believe there\u0027s more use for a vet than there is for a teacher.\" She tried for a smile, but wasn\u0027t very successful. \"You take care of your beasts, I\u0027ll take care of mine.\" \"Yeah.\" He summoned up a wan smile. He walked to the bed, cupped his hand to the back of Jessie\u0027s head, his fingers disappearing into her dark brown, short-cut hair, and kissed her forehead. \"I love you, doc.\" He let his head rest against hers. \"Thanks for listening to me.\" \"I love you,\" she answered, and put her arms around him. They stayed that way for a minute, until Jessie said, \"Lizard eyeballsi\" \"Yep!\" He straightened up. His face was more relaxed now, but his eyes were still troubled and Jessie knew that, however good a teacher he was, Tom thought of himself as a failure. \"I guess they\u0027re good and cold by now. Come and get \u0027em!\" Jessie got out of bed and followed her husband through the short hallway into the kitchen. In this room also, a ceiling fan was turning, and Tom had pulled up the blinds on the west-facing windows. The light in that direction was still tinged with violet, but the sky was turning bright blue over Rocking Chair Ridge. Tom had already fixed all four of the breakfast plates - each with bacon, scrambled eggs (no lizard eyeballs today), and toast - and they were waiting on the little circular table in the corner. \"Let\u0027s go, sleepyheads!\" Tom called toward the kids\u0027 rooms, and Ray answered with an unenthusiastic grunt. Jessie went to the refrigerator and liberally doused milk into her muscular coffee while Tom switched on the radio to catch the six-thirty news from KOaX in Fort Stockton. Stevie bounded into the kitchen. \"It\u0027s horsie day, Mama!\" she said. \"We get to go see Sweetpea!\" \"We sure do.\" It amazed her that anybody could be so full of energy in the morning, even a six-year-old child. Jessie poured a glass of orange juice for Stevie while the little girl, clad in her University of Texas nightshirt, climbed into her chair. She sat perched on the edge, swinging her legs and chewing at a piece of toast. \"How\u0027d you sleepi\" \"Good. Can I ride Sweetpea todayi\" \"Maybe. We\u0027ll see what Mr. Lucas has to say.\" Jessie was scheduled to drive out to the Lucas place, about six miles west of Inferno, and give their golden palomino Sweetpea a thorough checkup this morning. Sweetpea was a gentle horse that Tyler Lucas and his wife Bess had raised from a colt, and Jessie knew how much Stevie looked forward to their trip. \"eat your breakfast, cowgirl,\" Tom said. \"Gotta be strong to stay on a bronco.\" They heard the television snap on in the front room and the channels being clicked around. Rock music pounded through the speaker on MTV. In back of the house was a satellite dish that picked up about three hundred channels, bringing all parts of the world through the air to Inferno. \"No TV!\" Tom called, jarred by the noise. \"Come on to breakfast!\" \"Just one minute!\" Ray pleaded, as he always did. He was a TV addict, particularly drawn to the scantily clad models in the videos on MTV. \"Now!\" The television set was clicked off, and Ray Hammond walked into the kitchen. He was fourteen years old, beanpole thin and gawky - looks just like me when I was that age, Tom thought - and wore eyeglasses that slightly magnified his eyes: not much, but enough to earn him the nickname of X Ray from the kids at school. He yearned for contacts and a build like arnold Schwarzenegger; the first had been promised to him when he turned sixteen, and the second was a fever dream that no number of push-ups could accomplish. His hair was light brown, cropped close except for a few orange-dyed spikes on top that neither his father nor mother could talk him out of, and he was the proud possessor of a wardrobe of paisley-patterned shirts and tie-dyed jeans that made Tom and Jessie think the sixties had come back full vengeful circle. Right now, though, he wore only bright red pajama bottoms, his chest sunken and sallow. \"\u0027Morning, alien,\" Jessie said. \"\u0027Morning, \u0027lien,\" Stevie parroted. \"Hi.\" Ray plopped down in a chair and yawned hugely. \"Juice.\" He held out a hand. \"Please and thank you.\" Jessie poured him a glass, gave it to him, and watched as he put it down the awesome hatch. For a boy who only weighed around a hundred and fifteen pounds in a soaking wet suit, he could eat and drink faster than a horde of hungry Cowboy linebackers. He began digging into his eggs and bacon. There was purpose in Ray\u0027s all-out attack on his plate. He\u0027d had a dream about Belinda Sonyers, the blond fox who sat on the next row in his freshman english class, and the details were still percolating. If he got a hard-on here at the table with his folks, he would be in danger of serious embarrassment; so he concentrated on the food, which seemed the second-best thing to sex. Not that he knew, of course. The way his zits were popping up, he could forget about girls for the next thousand years. He stuffed his mouth full of toast. \"Where\u0027s the firei\" Tom asked. Ray almost gagged, but he got the toast down and attacked the eggs because the gauzy porno dream was making his pencil twitch again. after a week from tomorrow, though, he could forget about Belinda Sonyers and all the other foxes who paraded down the halls of Preston High; the school would be shut down, the doors locked, and the dreams would be just so much red-hot dust. But at least it would be summer, and that was okay too. Still, with the whole town closing down, summer was going to be about as much fun as cleaning out the attic. Jessie and Tom sat down to breakfast, and Ray got his thoughts under rein again. Stevie, the red highlights in her auburn hair shining in the sunlight, ate her food knowing that cowgirls did have to be strong to ride broncos - but Sweetpea was a nice horse, who wouldn\u0027t dream of bucking and throwing her. Jessie glanced at the clock on the wall - one of those goofy plastic things shaped like a cat\u0027s head, with eyeballs that ticked back and forth to mark the passing seconds; it was quarter to seven, and she knew Tyler Lucas was an early riser and would already be waiting for her to show up. Of course she didn\u0027t expect to find anything wrong with Sweetpea, but the horse was getting on in years and the Lucases treated it like a household pet. after breakfast, as Tom and Ray cleared away the plates, Jessie helped Stevie get dressed in a pair of jeans and a white cotton shirt with the Jetsons pictured on its front. Then she returned to her own bedroom and pulled off her nightshirt, exposing the tight, lithe body of a woman who enjoyed working outdoors; she had a \"Texas tan\" - arms brown to the shoulders, a deeply bronzed face, and the rest of her body almost ivory in contrast. She heard the TV click on; Ray was grabbing some more of the tube before he and his father left for school - but that was all right, because Ray was an avid reader as well and his brain pulled in information like a sponge. and the way he wore his hair and his taste in clothes were no causes for alarm, either, he was a good boy, a lot shier than he let on, and he was simply doing what he could to get along with his peers. She knew about his nickname, and she remembered that it was sometimes tough to be young. The harsh desert sun had added lines to Jessie\u0027s face, but she possessed a strong, natural beauty that required no aid from jars and tubes. anyway, she knew, vets weren\u0027t expected to win beauty pageants. They were expected to be available at all hours and to work damned hard, and Jessie did not disappoint. Her hands were brown and sturdy, and the things she\u0027d had to grab with them during her thirteen years as a veterinarian would\u0027ve made most women swoon. Gelding a vicious stallion, delivering a stillborn calf jammed in a cow\u0027s birth canal, removing a nail from the trachea of a five-hundred-pound prize boar - all those were operations she\u0027d performed successfully, as well as hundreds of other tasks ranging from treating a canary\u0027s injured beak to operating on a Doberman\u0027s infected jaw. But she was up to the task; working with animals was all she\u0027d ever wanted to do, even as a child when she used to bring home every stray dog and cat off the streets of her neighborhood in Fort Worth. She\u0027d always been a tomboy, and growing up with three brothers had taught her to roll with the punches - but she gave as good as she got too, and she could vividly recall knocking her oldest brother\u0027s front tooth out with a football when she was nine years old. He laughed about it now, whenever they spoke on the phone, and he kidded her that the ball might\u0027ve sailed to the Gulf if his mouth hadn\u0027t been in the way. She walked into the bathroom to sprinkle on some baby powder and brush the taste of coffee and Blue Nun from her mouth. She quickly ran her hands through her short, dark brown hair. Flecks of gray were creeping back from the temples. The march of time, she thought. Not as startling as watching your kids grow up, of course; it seemed like only yesterday that Stevie was a baby and Ray was in third grade. The years were flying, that was for sure. She went to the closet, pulled out a pair of her well-worn and comfortable jeans and a red T-shirt, put them on and then a pair of white socks and her sneakers. She got her sunglasses and a baseball cap, stopped in the kitchen to fill up two canteens because you never knew what might happen in the desert, and took her veterinary satchel from its place on the upper shelf of the hall closet. Stevie was hopping around like a jumping bean on a hot griddle, eager to get going. \"We\u0027re heading off,\" Jessie told Tom. \"See you about four.\" She leaned over and kissed him, and he planted a kiss on Stevie\u0027s cheek. \"Be careful, cowgirls!\" he said. \"Take care of your mama.\" \"I will!\" Stevie clutched her mother\u0027s hand, and Jessie paused to take a smaller-sized baseball cap off the hat tree near the front door and put it on Stevie\u0027s head. \"See you later, Ray!\" she called, and he answered, \"Check six!\" from his own room. Check sixi she thought as she and Stevie went out into the already-searing sunlight. Whatever happened to a simple \u0027Bye, Momi Nothing made her feel more like a fossil, at thirty-four, than not understanding her own son\u0027s language. They walked along the stone path that led from the house past the small building next door; it was fashioned of rough white stone, and set out near the street was a little sign that read INFeRNO aNIMaL HOSPITaL and, beneath that, Jessica Hammond, DVM. Parked at the curb, behind Tom\u0027s white Civic, was her dusty, sea-green Ford pickup truck; in a rack across the rear window, where most everybody else carried their rifles, was an extendable-wire restraining noose that Jessie had fortunately only had to use a few times. In another moment Jessie was driving west on Celeste Street, and Stevie was tucked behind her seat belt but hardly able to stand the confinement. She was fragile in appearance, her features as delicate as a porcelain doll\u0027s, but Jessie knew full well that Stevie had an intense curiosity and wasn\u0027t shy about going after what she wanted; the child already had an appreciation of animals and enjoyed traveling to the various farms and ranches with her mother, no matter how bone-jarring the trip. Stevie - Stephanie Marie, after Tom\u0027s grandmother just as Ray had been named after Jessie\u0027s grandfather - was usually a quiet child, and seemed to be absorbing the world through her large green eyes, which were just a few shades lighter than Jessie\u0027s. Jessie had enjoyed having her around and helping at the animal hospital, but Stevie would start first grade next September - wherever they happened to end up. Because after the schools in Inferno closed and the exodus continued, the rest of Inferno\u0027s stores and shops would shut down, and the few remaining spreads would dry up; there would be no work for Jessie, just as there would be none for Tom, and their only choice would be to pull up roots and hit the road. She drove past Preston Park on her left, the Ringwald Drug Store, Quik-Check Grocery, and the Ice House on her right. She crossed Travis Street, almost crunching one of Mrs. Stellenberg\u0027s big tomcats as it darted in front of the truck, and followed narrow Circle Back Road as it ran along the foot of Rocking Chair Ridge and then, true to its name, circled back to connect with Cobre Road. She paused at the blinking yellow light before she turned west and put the pedal to the metal. The desert\u0027s bittersweet tang blew through the open windows in the blessed breeze. Stevie\u0027s hair danced around her shoulders. Jessie figured this was the coolest it was likely to be all day, and they might as well enjoy it. Cobre Road took them past the chainlink fence and the iron gates of the Preston Copper Mine. The gates were padlocked, but the fence was in such bad shape an arthritic old man could\u0027ve climbed over. Crudely lettered signs said DaNGeR! NO TReSPaSSING! Beyond the gates was the huge crater where a red mountain rich with copper ore had once cast its shadow. In the last months of the mine\u0027s existence, the dynamite blasts had gone off like clockwork out here, and Jessie understood from Sheriff Vance that there were still some charges in the crater that had been unexploded and left behind, but no one was crazy enough to go down in there and pull them out. Jessie knew that sooner or later the mine would be exhausted, but nobody had expected the veins of ore to fail with such startling finality. From the moment the jackhammers and bulldozers had scraped against worthless rock, Inferno had been doomed. With a bump and shudder, the pickup\u0027s tires passed over the railroad tracks that ran north and south from the mining complex. Stevie leaned toward the window, her back already getting damp. She caught sight of a group of prairie dogs atop the mound of their nest, standing motionless on their hind legs. a jackrabbit burst from its cover of cactus and shot across the road, and way up in the sky a vulture was slowly circling. \"How\u0027re you doingi\" Jessie asked her. \"Fine.\" Stevie strained against the seat belt, the wind blowing into her face. The sky was as blue as a Smurf, and it looked like it went on forever - maybe even a hundred miles. Something struck her that she\u0027d been meaning to ask: \"How come Daddy\u0027s so sadi\" Of course Stevie had felt it, Jessie thought. There was no way for her not to. \"He\u0027s not sad, exactly. It\u0027s because of school closing. You remember, we talked about thati\" \"Yes. But it closes every year.\" \"Well, it\u0027s not going to open up again. Because of that, more people are going to move away.\" \"Like Jenny didi\" \"Right.\" Jenny Galvin was a little girl who\u0027d lived a few houses up the street from them, and she and her parents had moved just after Christmas. \"Mr. Bonner\u0027s going to close the Quik-Check store in august. By that time, I expect most everybody\u0027ll be gone.\" \"Oh.\" Stevie mulled that over for a moment. The Quik-Check store was where everybody bought food. \"and we\u0027ll be gone too,\" she said finally. \"Yes. Us too.\" Then that meant Mr. and Mrs. Lucas would be leaving, Stevie realized. and Sweetpea: what would happen to Sweetpeai Would they just set him free to run wild, or would they pack him up in a horse box, or would they get on him and ride awayi That was a puzzle worth thinking about, but she\u0027d seen the end of something and it gave her a sad feeling down near her heart - the same kind of feeling that she figured her daddy must know. The land was cut by gullies and covered with wild thatches of sagebrush and towers of stovepipe cactus. a blacktopped highway left Cobre Road about two miles past the copper mine and shot northwestward under a white granite arch with PReSTON embedded in tarnished copper letters. Jessie looked to her right, could see the big hacienda way up at the blacktop\u0027s end, shimmering in the rising heatwaves as they sped past. Good luck to you too, Jessie thought, envisioning the woman who was probably sleeping in that house on cool silk sheets. The sheets and the house might be all Celeste Preston had left, and those wouldn\u0027t last very much longer, either. They went on, following the road that carved across the desert. Stevie stared out the window, her face composed and thoughtful under the cap\u0027s brim. Jessie shifted in her seat to get her T-shirt unstuck. The turnoff to the Lucas place was about a half mile ahead. Stevie heard a high humming noise and thought a mosquito was at her ear. She flipped her hand against her ear, but the humming remained and it was getting louder and higher. In another few seconds it had turned painful, like the jabbing of a needle in both ears. \"Mamai\" she said, wincing. \"My ears hurt!\" a sharp, prickling pain had hit Jessie\u0027s eardrums as well. Not only that: the fillings in her back teeth were aching. She opened her mouth, working her lower jaw. \"Ow!\" she heard Stevie say. \"What is it, Mamai\" \"I don\u0027t know, hon - \" Suddenly the truck\u0027s engine died. Just died, without a stutter or gasp. They were coasting, and Jessie gave it more gas but she\u0027d filled the truck up yesterday and the fuel tank couldn\u0027t be empty. Her eardrums were really hurting now - pulsing to a high, painful tone like a far-off, distant wail. Stevie pressed her hands to her ears, and bright tears had come to her eyes. \"What is it, Mamai\" she asked again, panic quavering in her voice. \"What is iti\" Jessie shook her head. The noise was getting louder. She turned the ignition key and pumped the accelerator; still the engine wouldn\u0027t fire. She heard the crackle of static electricity in her hair, and she caught sight of her wristwatch: the digital display had gone mad, the hours flickering past at runaway speed. This\u0027ll be some story to tell Tom, she thought as she flinched in a cocoon of ear-piercing noise, and she reached out to grasp Stevie\u0027s hand. The child\u0027s head jerked to the right; her eyes widened, and she screamed, \"Mama!\" She\u0027d seen what was coming, and now Jessie did too. She slammed on the brake, her hands fighting the wheel. What looked like a flaming locomotive was hurtling through the air, burning parts flying off behind it and spinning away. It passed over Cobre Road, about fifty feet over the desert and maybe forty yards in front of Jessie\u0027s truck; she could make out a cylindrical form, glowing red-hot and surrounded by flames, and as the truck went off the road the object passed with a shriek that deafened Jessie and prevented her from hearing her own scream. She saw the rear of the object explode in yellow and violet flames, flinging pieces off in all directions; something came at the truck in a blur, and there was a wham! of metal being struck and the pickup shuddered right down to its frame. a front tire blew. The truck kept going over rocks and through stands of cactus before Jessie got it stopped, her palms sweat-slick on the wheel. The ringing in her ears still kept her from hearing, but she saw Stevie\u0027s frantic, tear-streaked face and she said, as calmly as she could, \"Hush, now. It\u0027s over. It\u0027s all over. Hush, now.\" Steam was shooting from around the truck\u0027s crumpled hood. Jessie looked to her left, saw the flaming object pass over a low ridge and disappear from sight. My God! she thought, stunned. What was iti In the next instant there was a roaring that penetrated even through Jessie\u0027s aural murk. The pickup\u0027s cab filled with whirling dust. Jessie grasped Stevie\u0027s hand, and the little girl\u0027s fingers clamped shut. There was dust in Jessie\u0027s mouth and in her eyes, and her cap had blown out the window. When she got her vision cleared again, she saw three gray-green helicopters, flying in a tight V formation about thirty or forty feet above the desert, following the flaming object toward the southwest. They too went over the ridge and out of sight. Up in the blue, the contrails of several jets also tracked to the southwest. The dust settled. Jessie began to get her hearing back; Stevie was sobbing, holding on to her mother\u0027s hand for dear life. \"It\u0027s over,\" Jessie said, and heard her own raspy voice. \"all over.\" She felt like crying herself, but mothers didn\u0027t do such things. The engine ticked like a rusty heart, and Jessie found herself staring at a geyser of steam that rose from a small round hole right in the center of the pickup\u0027s hood.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-3.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
