{"id":83367,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Jessie had seen the helicopter come down in Preston Park as Xavier Mendoza pulled the wrecker into his Texaco station and cut the engine. While Mendoza and his daytime helper, a lean and sullen young apache named Sonny Crowfield, labored to unhook the pickup and get it into a garage stall, Stevie walked away a few paces with the ebony sphere between her hands; she had no interest in the helicopter, or what its presence might mean. a Buick that had once been bright red, now faded to a pinkish cast by the sun, slid off Republica Road and pulled up to the garage stalls. \"Howdy, doc!\" the man at the wheel called; he got out, and Jessie\u0027s eyes were bombarded by Dodge Creech\u0027s green-and-orange plaid sport jacket. He strode jauntily toward her, his fat round face split by a grin that was all blinding-white caps. One glance at the pickup stopped him in his tracks. \"Gag a maggot! That ain\u0027t a wreck, it\u0027s a carcass!\" \"It\u0027s pretty bad, all right.\" Creech looked into the mangled engine and gave a low, trilling whistle. \"Rest in peace,\" he said. \"Or pieces, I might say.\" His laugh was a strangled cackle, like a chicken struggling to squeeze out a square egg. He recovered quickly when he saw that Jessie did not share his humor. \"Sorry. I know this truck put in a lot of miles for you. Lucky nobody got hurt - uh - you and Stevie are okay, righti\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" Jessie glanced over at her daughter; Stevie had found a slice of shadow at the building\u0027s far corner, and looked to be intently examining the black ball. \"Stevie\u0027s... been shaken up, but she\u0027s okay. No injuries, I mean.\" \"Glad to hear that, surely am.\" Creech dug a lemon-yellow paisley handkerchief from the breast pocket of his jacket and mopped the moisture off his face. His slacks were almost the same shade of yellow, and he wore two-tone yellow-on-white shoes. He owned a closetful of polyester suits in a garish rainbow of colors, and though he read esquire and GQ avidly, his fashion sense remained as raucous as a Saturday night rodeo. His wife, Ginger, had sworn she would divorce him if he wore his iridescent red suit to church again. He believed in the power of a man\u0027s image, he often told her - and anyone who would listen; if you were scared to make people notice you, he said, you might as well sink on down and let the ground swallow you whole. He was a big, fleshy man in his early forties who always offered a quick smile and a handshake, and he\u0027d sold some form of insurance to almost all the residents of Inferno. In his broad, ruddy-cheeked face his eyes were as blue as a baby\u0027s blanket, and he was bald except for a fringe of red hair and a little red tuft atop his forehead that he kept meticulously combed. He touched the gaping hole in the pickup\u0027s engine. \"Looks like a cannon hit you, doc. Want to tell me what happenedi\" Jessie began; she registered Stevie standing nearby, then focused all her attention on telling Dodge Creech the story. Stevie, comfortable in the cool shadow, was watching the black ball do magic. Her fingerprints had begun to appear in vivid blue again; it was a color that reminded her of pictures of the ocean, or of that swimming pool at the motel in Dallas where they\u0027d spent last summer vacation. She drew a cactus with her fingernail, watched as the blue picture slowly melted away. She drew scrawls and swirls and circles, and all the patterns drifted down into the ball\u0027s dark center. This is even better than fingerpaints! she thought. You didn\u0027t have to clean anything up, and there wasn\u0027t any way to spill the paints - except there was only one color, but that was okay, because it sure was pretty. Stevie had an idea; she drew a little grid across the black ball and began to fill it with Xs and Os. Tic-tac-toe, she knew the game was called. Her daddy was very good at it, and had been teaching her. She filled in all the Xs and Os herself, finding that the Os linked up across the bottom row; the grid melted away, and Stevie drew another one. Xs won this time, in a diagonal line. Time for a third grid, as this one melted away as well. again, Xs won. She remembered that her daddy said the middle space was the most important, so she started an O there and, indeed, the Os won. \"What\u0027cha got there, kidi\" Stevie looked up, startled. Sonny Crowfield was staring at her; his black hair hung to his shoulders, and his eyes were black under thick black brows. \"What is iti\" he asked, wiping his greasy hands on a rag. \"a toyi\" She nodded and said nothing. He grunted. \"Looks like a piece of shit to me.\" He sneered, and then Mendoza called him and he returned to the garage. \"You\u0027re a piece of shit,\" she said to Crowfield\u0027s back - but not too loudly, because she knew shit was not a nice word. and then she looked back at the black ball, and she caught her breath with a gasp. another blue-lined grid had been drawn in it. The grid was full of Xs and Os, and X had won the game across the top row. It slowly faded away, back into the depths. She had not drawn that grid. and she did not draw the one that began to appear, the lines precise and as thin as if sketched with a razor, on the surface of the black ball. Stevie felt her fingers loosen. She almost dropped the ball, but she remembered her mother saying not to. The tic-tac-toe grid was complete in another couple of seconds, and the Xs and Os began to appear. She started to call for her mama, but Jessie was still talking to Dodge Creech; Stevie watched the grid\u0027s spaces being filled - and then, on an impulse, she put an X in one of them as soon as the ball\u0027s inner finger had finished an O. There was no further response. The grid slowly vanished. a few seconds ticked past; the ball remained solidly black. I broke it, Stevie thought sadly. It\u0027s not going to play anymore! But something moved down in the depths of the sphere - a brief burst of blue that quickly faded. The razor-sharp lines of another grid began to come up, and Stevie watched as an O appeared in the center space. Then there was a pause; Stevie\u0027s heart jumped, because she realized whatever was inside the black ball was inviting her to play. She chose a space on the bottom row and drew an X. an O appeared in the upper left, and there was another pause for Stevie to decide on her move. The game ended quickly, with a diagonal of Os from upper left to lower right. another grid appeared as soon as the last vanished, and again an O was drawn in the center space. Stevie frowned; whatever it was, it already knew the game too well. But she bravely made her move and lost even faster than before. \"Steviei Show Mr. Creech what hit us.\" She jumped. Her mother and Dodge Creech were standing nearby, but neither of them had seen what she was doing. She thought Mr. Creech\u0027s coat looked like somebody had sewn it while they had their finger stuck in an electric socket. \"Can I take a gander, honi\" he asked, smiling, and held out his hand. Stevie hesitated. The ball was cool and utterly black again, all the traces of the grids gone. She didn\u0027t want to give it up to that big, stranger\u0027s hand. But her mother was watching, expecting her to obey, and she knew she\u0027d already disobeyed far too much today. She gave him the black ball - and as soon as her fingers left it and Mr. Creech had it in his hand, she heard the sigh of the wind chimes singing to her again. \"This did the damagei\" Creech blinked slowly, weighing the object in his palm. \"Doc, you sure about thati\" \"as sure as I can be. I know it\u0027s light, but it\u0027s the right size; like I said, it was lodged up in the wheel well after it went through the engine.\" \"I just can\u0027t see how somethin\u0027 like this could\u0027ve busted through metal. Feels like glass, kinda. Or wet plastic.\" He ran his fingers over the smooth surface; Stevie noted that they left no blue fingerprints. The wind-chimes music was insistent, yearning, and Stevie thought, It needs me. \"So this is what blew out of the thing that went by, huhi\" Dodge Creech held it up to the sun, could see nothing inside it. \"Never seen the like of this before. any idea what it isi\" \"None,\" Jessie said. \"I expect whoever came down in that helicopter might know. Three of them were following it.\" \"I don\u0027t rightly know what to put in my report,\" Creech admitted. \"I mean, you\u0027re covered for collision and injuries and all, but I don\u0027t think Texas Pride\u0027ll understand that a plastic baby bowlin\u0027 ball tore a hole smack dab through a pickup\u0027s engine. What\u0027re you plannin\u0027 on doin\u0027 with iti\" \"Turning it over to Vance, just as soon as we can get over there.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll be glad to take you. I don\u0027t think your pickup\u0027s goin\u0027 anywhere.\" \"Mamai\" Stevie asked. \"What\u0027ll the sheriff do with iti\" \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe send it somewhere to try to figure out what it is. Maybe try to break it open.\" The wind-chimes music pulled at her. She thought that the black ball was begging her to take it again; of course she couldn\u0027t understand why Mr. Creech or her mother didn\u0027t hear the wind chimes too, or what exactly was making the music, but she heard it as the call of a playmate. Try to break it open, she thought, and flinched inside. Oh, no. Oh, no, that wouldn\u0027t be right. Because whatever was in the black ball would be hurt if it was cracked open, like a turtle would be hurt if its shell was broken. Oh, no! She looked up imploringly at her mother. \"Do we have to give it awayi Can\u0027t we just take it home and keep iti\" \"Hon, I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t.\" Jessie touched the child\u0027s cheek. \"I\u0027m sorry, but we\u0027ve got to give it to the sheriff. Okayi\" Stevie didn\u0027t answer. Mr. Creech was holding the black ball down at his side in a loose grip. \"Well,\" Mr. Creech said, \"why don\u0027t we head on over and see Vance right nowi\" He started to turn away to walk to his car. The music pained her and gave her courage. She\u0027d never done anything like what streaked through her mind to do; such a thing was a sure invitation to a spanking, but she knew she would have only one chance. Later she could explain why she\u0027d done it, and later always seemed a long way off. Mr. Creech took one step toward his car. and then Stevie darted forward, past her mother, and plucked the black ball from Dodge Creech\u0027s hand; the wind-chimes music stopped as her fingers curled around the ball, and Stevie knew she\u0027d done the right thing. \"Stevie!\" Jessie cried out, shocked. \"Give that back to - \" But the little girl was running, clutching the black ball close. She ran around the corner of Mendoza\u0027s gas station, from shadow into sunlight, narrowly missed ramming into the trash dumpster, and kept going between two cacti as tall as Mr. Creech. \"Stevie!\" Jessie came around the corner, saw the little girl running across somebody\u0027s backyard, heading toward Brazos Street. \"Come back here this minute!\" Jessie called, but Stevie didn\u0027t stop and she knew the child wasn\u0027t going to. Stevie ran along a wire-mesh fence, turned a corner, and had reached Brazos; she disappeared from sight. \"Stevie!\" Jessie tried again, but it was no use. \"I do believe she wants to keep that thing, don\u0027t youi\" Creech asked, standing behind Jessie. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s gotten into her! I swear, she\u0027s been acting crazy ever since we got hit! Dodge, I\u0027m sorry about this. I don\u0027t - \" \"Forget about it.\" He grunted and shook his head. \"Little lady can fly when she wants to, can\u0027t shei\" \"She\u0027s probably heading home. Dammit!\" She was almost too stunned to speak. \"Will you give me a ride to the housei\" \"Sure thing. Come on.\" They hurried back around the corner to Creech\u0027s Buick - and two men, one in the uniform of an air-force officer, were standing beside it. \"Dr. Hammondi\" the man with a black crewcut said, stepping forward. \"We need to talk.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-10.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
