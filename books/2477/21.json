{"id":83378,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"Safe and sound,\" Cody said as he pulled the cycle to the curb in front of Rick Jurado\u0027s house. Miranda got off, clutching her suitcase, her hair wild and windblown. \"anybody ever tell you you drive too fasti\" \"Nope.\" He glanced around; no Rattlers on the street, not yet at least. The sound of hammers rang from Cade\u0027s junkyard. \"Well, I\u0027m telling you. You could\u0027ve gotten us killed.\" \"You can get killed by breathin\u0027 around here,\" he answered. \"Better get on inside.\" He nodded toward the house; the yellow porch light was on. In the air he could smell onions and beans. \"I\u0027ll wait till you make it in.\" \"You don\u0027t have to.\" \"No sweat,\" he said, but he was sweating under his arms. \"Thanks for the ride. and for saving me from the Mumbler too.\" She smiled faintly, then started for the house. \"anytime.\" Cody revved the engine, watching as she climbed the steps and knocked at the door. She was okay, he decided. Too bad that... well, just too bad. The door opened. Cody saw Rick Jurado\u0027s face in the yellow light. \"Brought you a present, Ricky!\" he shouted, and as Rick stared, bewildered and shocked, Cody spun the Honda around in a tight circle and rocketed away along Second Street. \"Damned crazy fool!\" Rick raged, in Spanish - and then he looked at the girl who stood at his front door with a suitcase in her hand. \"Hi,\" she said. He answered, \"Hi,\" not recognizing her; but in the next second the bottom dropped out of his composure. The last picture she\u0027d sent him had been over two years ago, and in those two years she had changed from a little girl to a woman. \"Mirandai\" Her suitcase thumped to the porch\u0027s boards, and she reached for her brother. He put his arms around her, lifted her off her feet, and squeezed; he heard her make a small sob, and his eyes were burning too. \"Miranda... Miranda, I can\u0027t believe this! How\u0027d you get herei I just can\u0027t - \" and then it hit him: Cody Lockett, with his sister. He almost dropped her, and as he set her down his eyes had gone maniacal. \"What were you doin\u0027 with Locketti\" \"Nothing. He just gave me a ride.\" \"Did he touch youi I swear to God, if he touched you - \" \"No, no!\" His expression was scaring her. It was not the face of the gentle brother who wrote her letters with a graceful, precise hand. \"He didn\u0027t do anything except bring me from the bus stop!\" \"You stay away from him! He\u0027s trash! You understandi\" \"No, I don\u0027t!\" But she did, in that moment; she saw Rick\u0027s metal-studded bracelets - the macho fashion of many of the boys who ran with the gangs in Fort Worth - and she remembered how Cody had reacted when she\u0027d mentioned Rick\u0027s name. Bad blood, she thought. \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m fine.\" He was trembling with anger. How dare that bastard touch Miranda! It was yet another score that must be settled. But he forced the rage off his face and coiled it up inside, to wait. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to get hot. Come inside!\" He picked up her suitcase and took her hand. Once inside the house, he closed and bolted the door. \"Sit down, please!\" He started bustling around, trying to straighten up the dusty room. \"Where\u0027s Palomai\" \"Sleeping.\" His street inflections were gone. He brushed off the sofa\u0027s pillows and plumped them up. \"I\u0027ll go wake her - \" \"No, not yet. First I have to talk to you alone.\" He frowned. That sounded serious. \"What is iti\" Miranda walked across the room to Paloma\u0027s shelf of ceramic birds. She picked up a cardinal and ran her fingers over its wings. \"I\u0027m not going back to Fort Worth,\" she said finally. \"Not ever.\" \"Bash him!\" Ruben shouted merrily. \"Bash the li\u0027l fucker!\" Paco had hold of Ray\u0027s ankles and was trying to pull him out from underneath the pinball machine, but Ray grasped one of its legs and wasn\u0027t about to let go. His glasses had spun away, and blood drooled from his mouth. Still, his mind was clear; he thought he knew what it must be like to be a wounded animal set upon by vultures. Robby Falkner screwed up his guts and charged, but Paco whirled upon him and smashed him in the face - one, two, three quick blows. Robby\u0027s nose burst open, and the boy gave a small weak cry as he fell. On the floor Stoplight scrabbled away from Juan Diegas, who began to attack the arcade machines again. \"Stop it! Please stop it!\" Kennishaw hollered, crouching in a corner. Stoplight saw the open door in front of him and, one eye swollen shut and a gash across his cheek from a signet ring, he got up and ran onto the street. Behind him, Juan roared, \"Wreckage!\" and threw over the Gunfighter machine, which shot blue sparks and began to vomit forth its quarters. Stoplight kept going past the sheriff\u0027s office. This was Renegade business, and he knew exactly what to do. \"It\u0027s her, isn\u0027t iti\" Rick\u0027s eyes were black and fierce. \"What\u0027s she done to youi\" \"It\u0027s not that. I just had to get - \" He took her right hand. The palm was dry and cracked, the fingernails broken - she had the hands of a laborer instead of a Fort Worth high school junior. \"I see,\" he said tautly. \"She\u0027s had you scrubbing floors.\" Miranda shrugged. \"I did some work for a few people, after school. It wasn\u0027t much. Just sweeping, washing dishes, and - \" \"Carting some fat gringo\u0027s garbage to the streeti\" \"It was a job.\" She pulled her hand away from his. \"It wasn\u0027t her idea. It was mine.\" \"Yeah.\" Rick smiled bitterly. \"and there you were being a maid while she sat around waiting for her pimp to call, huhi\" \"Stop.\" Her gaze met his. \"Just stop. You don\u0027t know, so you can\u0027t say.\" \"I do know! Hell, I read your letters! I kept them all! Maybe you never spelled it out, but I can read between the lines pretty good! She\u0027s a worthless puta, and I don\u0027t know why you stayed with her this long!\" Miranda was silent. She returned the cardinal to its place on the shelf. \"No one\u0027s worthless. That\u0027s why I stayed.\" \"Yeah, well thank Mother Mary you got away before she could turn you into a whore too!\" She pressed a finger to his lips. \"Please,\" she implored. \"Let\u0027s talk nice, all righti\" He kissed her finger, but his eyes remained brooding. \"Look what I still have!\" Miranda went to her suitcase, unlatched it, and dug through clothes until she found a many-times-folded piece of paper. She began carefully unfolding it, and Rick saw where it had been taped at the seams to keep it from falling apart. He knew what it was, but he let her open it and display it to him. \"Seei It looks almost new.\" On the paper was a self-portrait, done in pastel crayons about three years ago. His face - a lot younger then, he thought - was drawn with thick and aggressive lines, lots of black shadow, and red highlights. It looked damned amateurish to him now. He\u0027d done it in about an hour or so, while staring into a mirror in his room. \"Do you still drawi\" Miranda asked him. \"a little.\" In his room, in a box under the bed, were dozens of pastel studies, most of them on lined notebook paper, of Bordertown, the desert, Rocking Chair Ridge, and the face of his grandmother. But it was a private thing he did, and no one but Miranda and Paloma knew about it. He refused to put any of his drawings up in the house for fear that the other Rattlers might see. \"You should do something with your talent,\" Miranda persisted. \"You should go to art school or - \" \"No more school. Tomorrow\u0027s my last day, and then I\u0027m through.\" \"What are you going to do, theni\" \"I\u0027ve already got a good job, at the hardware store.\" He hadn\u0027t mentioned in any of his letters that he was a lowly stockboy. \"I\u0027m... uh... in inventory control. I figure maybe I can start painting houses on weekends. a fast house painter can make a lot of money.\" \"You can do better than that, and you know it. This says you can.\" She held up the self-portrait. \"No more school,\" he said firmly. \"Mama always said you were - \" She stopped, knowing she was treading near a minefield, and then continued: \"as hard to move as a mule train.\" \"She was right. For once.\" He watched as Miranda gently refolded the drawing and put it away. \"So what happenedi\" he asked her, and waited to hear the whole story, even though he knew it was going to tear him apart. \"Cody! Cody!\" He looked up from putting the tools away in the garage stall. Stoplight was staggering toward him, nearly falling, his face a mask of blood. \"They\u0027re killin\u0027 him, Cody!\" Stoplight said, struggling for breath. He bent over, about to puke, and drops of blood spattered on the concrete. \"Mr. Hammond\u0027s kid. X Ray. The Rattlers. They\u0027re at the Warp Room, and they\u0027re killin\u0027 him, man!\" \"How manyi\" Ice water had flooded his veins, but a hard hot pulse beat in his skull. \"I don\u0027t know.\" He thought his brains must be knocked loose. \"Five or six. Seven, maybe.\" Mendoza had been counting money from the register, and now he came out and saw the boy\u0027s bloody face; he stopped short, his mouth gaping. Cody had no hesitation. He reached for the wall and lifted off a leather tool belt that held an array of wrenches, drawing it tight around his waist and buckling it. \"Go find Tank, Bobby Clay, Davy, anybody and everybody you can. Move it!\" Stoplight nodded, mustered his strength, and ran away, an obedient soldier. at once Cody was astride his motorcycle, and Mendoza\u0027s cry of \"Cody! Wait!\" was drowned out by the engine firing. Cody sped off into the darkness. \"Dammit!\" Mendoza ran for the telephone in his office and hurriedly dialed the sheriff. One of the night deputies, Leland Teal, answered and Mendoza started telling him there was going to be a gang fight but Teal spent precious seconds fumbling for a pencil and paper to take down the information. Cody skidded to a stop in front of the Warp Room. His insides cold and his eyes aflame, he strode through the doorway and saw the carnage. arcade machines had been overturned, spitting sparks across the floor. Ruben Hermosa was kicking the glass out of one of them, and from the back old Kennishaw was in a corner moaning \"No... please... no...\" Juan Diegas had hold of some kid - Robby Falkner, Cody thought it was - and was methodically rubbing the boy\u0027s face on the floor, leaving bloody streaks. Other kids cringed at the rear of the Warp Room. and there was Paco LeGrande, splinted nose and all, kicking at Ray Hammond, who had curled up under a pinball machine and was desperately trying to protect his testicles. Cody heard the breath hiss between X Ray\u0027s teeth as one of those big combat boots struck his shoulder, and Cody said, \"That\u0027s enough.\" Paco stopped kicking, turned and grinned. Ruben Hermosa ceased his destruction, and Juan Diegas released Robby Falkner, who lay sobbing. \"Hey, man!\" Paco said, and showed his palms. \"We\u0027re jus\u0027 havin\u0027 us a li\u0027l party.\" \"Party\u0027s over,\" Cody told him. He glanced quickly around. Only three Rattlers; what was that shit about five of them being herei Well, maybe LeGrande and Diegas made two apiece. \"I think the party\u0027s jus\u0027 startin\u0027,\" Paco replied; his grin froze into a rictus, and he began striding forward, his boots clumping, his body getting ready to launch itself at Lockett. Cody let him come on, and didn\u0027t move. But when Paco was almost upon him, Cody\u0027s hand blurred to his tool belt. It came away with a wrench, and he flung it before Paco could register what was going to happen. The wrench hit Paco\u0027s collarbone with a solid crunch. Paco yelled in pain and staggered back into Ruben, his face contorted even further. The wrench clattered to the floor. Juan Diegas charged, was too fast for Cody to dodge. The Rattler hit him, head to belly, knocked the air from his lungs, and lifted him off his feet. He crashed into the Commando machine, and Juan pummeled wildly at his ribs. Cody jabbed an uppercut at Juan\u0027s chin, only grazed it, hooked his fingers into the Rattler\u0027s eyes, and twisted. This time Juan screamed and backpedaled, madly rubbing his scratched eyeballs. Cody wasted no time; he took a step forward, planted himself, and kicked Juan in the stomach. The other boy wheezed and went down. Ruben Hermosa swung at Cody, caught him in the jaw, and rocked him back. another blow grazed Cody\u0027s forehead. He lifted his arms, warded off a third punch, gripped Ruben\u0027s T-shirt, and slammed his fist into the boy\u0027s face; it was an instinct shot, and hit Ruben smack in the nose. Blowing blood, Ruben tried to retreat but Cody was all over him, hitting him in the face with pistonlike blows. Ruben staggered, his knees buckled - and then Paco leapt over the Solar Fortress machine and hit Cody with a bodyblock that knocked him sprawling. Ruben scurried for the door on his hands and knees. Once outside, he got up and ran for Bordertown. Cody had blood in his mouth, and his vision was hazed. He could hear the big boots coming, and he thought, Get up or you\u0027re buzzard bait! He tried to stand, but he knew he was too late. One of Paco\u0027s boots hit him under the right arm, sending jolts of pain shooting through his ribs. \"Stomp him!\" he heard Juan shout. Cody twisted, and the next kick caught his shoulder. His vision was clearing but his legs wouldn\u0027t move fast enough. He looked up, saw Paco towering over him and another kick about to be delivered. He had the mental image of it hitting his chin, knocking his head back, and snapping his neck like a chicken\u0027s. He had to move, and quick. But before he could, a figure leapt upon Paco LeGrande\u0027s back and knocked the Rattler off balance. The kick never came. Cody saw X Ray\u0027s bleeding face - and the little sonofabitch was snarling. Paco shouted with rage and reached back to tear X Ray off - but the smaller boy grabbed Paco\u0027s nose splint and gave it a mighty yank. \"I love her.\" Miranda\u0027s voice was quiet, her hands folded before her as she sat on the sofa. \"But I couldn\u0027t stay with her anymore. I couldn\u0027t stand it.\" Rick waited without pressing her, because he knew there was more and it had to come out. \"It got worse with the men,\" Miranda went on. \"She started bringing them to the apartment. Those apartments... they have such thin walls.\" She picked at a broken fingernail, unable to look at her brother. \"She met this guy. He wanted her to go to California with him. She said he\" - a tortured smile flickered across her mouth - \"made her feel pretty. and do you know what else she saidi\" She forced herself to meet his solemn gaze. He was waiting to hear it. \"She said... we could make a lot of money in California. The both of us. She said that now I was old enough to start making some real money.\" Rick sat without moving, his eyes deep ebony and his face like chiseled stone, but inside he was writhing. Their mother had left him here with Paloma when he was five years old and taken three-year-old Miranda with her; their father had abandoned them just after Miranda was born. Where esteban Jurado was, Rick didn\u0027t know, nor did he particularly care, but over the years his mother had written him and Paloma chatty letters about her \"modeling\" career. There always seemed to be a big break on the horizon that never materialized, and gradually the letters were written more and more by Miranda. Rick had gotten very good at reading between the lines. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking, but you\u0027re wrong,\" Miranda said. \"She was giving me a choice. I could either leave, or go to California with her. But I don\u0027t believe she really wanted me to. I believe she wanted me to pack my bag and go to the bus station and buy a ticket to Inferno, just like I did. That\u0027s what I believe.\" Her expression was as firm as his, but the glitter of tears had begun to show. \"Please, Rick... please don\u0027t try to make me think that isn\u0027t true.\" \"Ricardoi\" Paloma\u0027s voice drifted from the hallway. Before he could get up to help her, Paloma walked into the room, dressed in her cotton nightgown and her white hair disarrayed from sleep. \"I heard you talking to someone.\" \"Grandmother,\" Miranda said - and Paloma abruptly halted, angling her head toward the dimly seen figure who stood up from the sofa. \"Who...\" \"It\u0027s me, Grandmother.\" The girl approached her, gently took one of her thin, age-spotted hands. \"It\u0027s - \" \"Miranda,\" the old woman whispered. \"Oh... Miranda... my little Miranda!\" She touched the girl\u0027s hand, ran trembling fingers over Miranda\u0027s features. \"all grown up!\" The last time she\u0027d seen the child was as a three-year-old, being carried north in a Trailways bus. \"Oh! So lovely! So lovely!\" Miranda began to cry, tears of joy this time, and hugged her grandmother. and what Paloma would never tell either Miranda or Rick was that she\u0027d been standing in the hallway for a long while, and had heard everything. \"Guerra! Guerra!\" someone was shouting out in the street. Dogs started barking like crazy. \"What\u0027s thati\" Paloma asked sharply. The shout kept coming: \"Guerra! Guerra!\" They all knew what it meant: gang war. Rick had a knot in his throat; he turned away from his grandmother and sister and ran out to the porch. Ruben Hermosa was standing in the middle of Second Street, his T-shirt splattered with blood and his jeans wet and muddy from crossing the Snake River\u0027s putrid ditch. He was hollering at the top of his voice, and Rick saw Zarra come out of his house, and then Joey Garracone from his house up the street, followed by Ramon Torrez from next door. Other Rattlers were responding, and dogs barked frantically and raced across the yards, raising whirlwinds of dust. Rick sprinted down the steps. \"Shut up!\" he yelled, and Ruben did. \"What are you babblin\u0027 about, mani\" \"The \u0027Gades!\" Ruben said, his nose oozing blood. \"at the Warp Room, man!\" He clutched at Rick\u0027s shirt. \"an ambush... Lockett hit Paco with a hammer... Juan got his eyes clawed, man. Oh Jesus... my nose got busted.\" \"Talk sense!\" Rick gripped his arm, because the boy looked as if he were about to keel over. \"What\u0027s goin\u0027 oni What were you doin\u0027 across the bridgei\" Pequin came running up, gleefully shouting \"Guerra!\" in imitation of the voice that had roused him onto the street. \"Shut up!\" Rick commanded, right in his face, and Pequin\u0027s eyes flared with indignant anger but he obeyed. \"Jus\u0027 fuckin\u0027 around... not tryin\u0027 to hurt nobody,\" Ruben explained. \"Jus\u0027 went over there for a kick, that\u0027s all. They jumped us.\" He looked around at the other Rattlesnakes. \"They\u0027re killin\u0027 Paco and Juan! Right now!\" He felt his wits get away from him like wild horses. \"Maybe six or seven \u0027Gades, maybe more... it happened so fast.\" \"War!\" Pequin shouted. \"We\u0027re gonna stomp some \u0027Gade asses!\" \"I said shut up!\" Rick grasped Pequin\u0027s collar, but the smaller boy jerked away and ran toward Third Street, hollering his war chant to alert the Rattlers who lived over there. \"Somebody stop him!\" Rick demanded, but Pequin was drunk with the smell of violence and running like the wind. \"We\u0027ve gotta get Paco and Juan out of there, Rick,\" Zarra said; his bullwhip was coiled and ready around his arm. \"We\u0027ve gotta save our brothers, man.\" \"Wait a minute. Let me think.\" But he couldn\u0027t think. His blood was on fire, and Pequin\u0027s shrill cry penetrated the walls of every house in Bordertown. There was no time to reason this thing out, because here came J. J. Melendez and Freddie Concepcion, followed by Diego Montana, Tina Mulapes, and a big red-haired girl everybody knew as \"animal.\" \"Those fuckers are gonna kill our bloods!\" Sonny Crowfield had appeared, his face sweating and stained by the yellow porch light. \"You gonna go over there or not, Juradoi\" he challenged, and Rick saw that he gripped a length of lead pipe in his hand and his eyes were hungry for a fight. Rick had to decide, and the decision was clear. The words came out: \"We go.\" as the others whooped and shouted, Rick looked at Paloma and Miranda, standing together on the porch. He saw his grandmother say No but he couldn\u0027t hear her voice for all the noise, and maybe that was best. Miranda wasn\u0027t sure what was happening, but she saw chains and baseball bats appearing as other kids came running up and she knew it had to be a gang fight. Rick touched his pocket, felt the Fang of Jesus there. already some of the others were running for their cars and motorcycles, or sprinting toward the river\u0027s embankment as if rushing to a fiesta. It was all out of control now, Rick realized, and before this night was done a lot of blood was going to be spilled. Pequin\u0027s cry for war echoed across Bordertown. Mrs. alhambra was across the street, shouting for Zarra to come home, but he said urgently to Rick, \"Let\u0027s move it!\" Rick nodded, started to go up the porch steps to his grandmother and sister, but there was no time. His hard mask settled into place. Wreckage, he thought, and he turned his back on them and strode like vengeance to his car.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-21.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
