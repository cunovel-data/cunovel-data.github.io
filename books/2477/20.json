{"id":83377,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"While Cody had been spinning his yarn about the Mumbler, Ray Hammond stared from the window of his room and let himself think what might happen if he was to go aWOL.\n I\u0027d get my butt beat, that\u0027s what, he decided. and I\u0027d deserve it too.\n But still... He\u0027d been in his room for about two hours, had plugged the headphones into his boom box and listened to Billy Idol, Clash, Joan Jett, and Human League tapes while he worked on a plastic model of a SuperBlitzer Go-Bot. His mother had come in about twenty minutes ago, bringing him a ham sandwich, some potato chips, and a Pepsi, and had told him that Daufin was still motionless in the kitchen. It was best that he stay here, out of the way, until the air-force men took the creature away, she\u0027d said - and Ray had seen how that idea tore his mother up inside, but what was her choicei The thing in the kitchen was no longer Stevie; that was a bone-dry fact.\n Thinking about his sister being gone, while her body stood in the kitchen, was a weird trip. Ray had always thought of Stevie as a little monkey, getting into his tape collection, his models, even once almost finding the cache of Penthouse magazines at the back of his closet, but of course he loved the brat; she\u0027d been around for six years, and now... and now, he thought, she was gone but her body remained. But what had Daufin meant about Stevie being protectedi Was Stevie gone forever, or noti Weird, weird trip.\n From his window he could see a blue neon sign farther down Celeste Street, between the Boots \u0027n Plenty shoestore and the Ringwald Drugstore; the sign read WaRP ROOM. That was where everybody would be hanging out tonight, playing the arcade games and buzzing about the helicopter landing in Preston Park. They\u0027d be cooking up rumors right and left, really throwing the tales around, and the place would be full of smash foxes. and of everybody there - all the \u0027Gades and jocks and party animals - only he would know the truth.\n Right, he told himself. My sister got dusted today, and I\u0027m thinking about girls. X Ray, you\u0027re the king turd, man.\n But his mother had said something to him about twenty minutes ago that he heard a lot: Stay out of the way.\n That seemed to be his middle name. Ray Stay out of the way Hammond. If it wasn\u0027t the older guys saying it to him at school, it was his own folks. even Paco LeGrande, today, had been telling him to stay out of the way. Ray knew he was a zero with girls and not too sharp on looks, his talent in sports was nonexistent, and all anybody like him could do was stay out of the way.\n \"Dammit,\" he said, very softly. The Warp Room beckoned him. But he was supposed to stay here, and he knew for sure that Colonel Rhodes didn\u0027t want him going outside and telling everybody that an alien had come to visit Inferno. Forget it, he thought. Just stay here, out of the way.\n But for one night - one night - he could stroll into the Warp Room and be somebody, even if he didn\u0027t tell a soul.\n Before he knew what his fingers were doing, he unhooked the window\u0027s latch.\n Going aWOL was a serious offense, he thought. Like Dad-would-blow-his-top kind of offense. Indefinite-grounding offense.\n One night.\n He pushed the window up about three inches; it made a faint skreeking noise.\n Still can change your mind, he told himself. But he figured his folks wouldn\u0027t check in with him for a while; he could go to the Warp Room and come back before they ever knew he was gone.\n He pushed the window up another few inches.\n \"Rayi\" a knock at his door, and his father\u0027s voice.\n He froze. He knew his dad wouldn\u0027t come in without being invited. \"Yes siri\" \"You all righti\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Listen... sorry I jumped you. It\u0027s just, you know, that this is kind of a trying time for everybody. We don\u0027t know what Daufin\u0027s doing, and... we want Stevie back, if that\u0027s possible. Maybe it\u0027s not. But we can hope, huhi\" Tom paused, and in that pause Ray almost slid the window back down, but the Warp Room\u0027s blue neon burned in his eyeglasses. \"You want to come outi I think it\u0027d be okay.\" \"I\u0027m...\" Oh, Lord, he thought. \"I\u0027m... just gonna listen to some music, Dad. On my headphones. I\u0027ll just stay in here, out of the way.\" There was a silence. Then: \"Sure you\u0027re all righti\" \"Yes sir. I\u0027m sure.\" \"Okay. Well, come on out when you want.\" Ray heard his father\u0027s footsteps, moving along the corridor to the den. Murmured voices, Dad and Mom talking.\n It was time to go, if he was going. He slid the window all the way up, climbed out with his heart pounding a fugitive rhythm; he slid the window down when he was out, and he ran along Celeste Street toward the Warp Room. If there was one thing he could do well, it was run.\n But he found the Warp Room not nearly as crowded as he\u0027d expected; in fact, only six or seven kids were inside, milling around the pinball machines. The Warp Room\u0027s walls were painted deep violet, with sparkly stars dashed here and there. Day-Glo painted planets dangled on wires from the ceiling, being stirred into small orbits by the fans. arcade machines - Galaxian, Neutron, Space Hunter, Gunfighter, and about ten more - stood bleeping and burping for attention. every so often the speaker atop the Space Hunter machine boomed out a metallic challenge: \"attention, earthlings! Do you dare do battle with Space Hunteri Prepare for action! Prepare to be destroyed!\" at the back of the place, its manager - an elderly man named Kennishaw - sat on a folding metal chair reading a copy of Texas Outdoorsman magazine. a change-making machine stood next to him, and on the wall was a sign demanding NO CURSING, NO BeTTING, NO FIGHTING.\n \"X Ray! How\u0027s it hangin\u0027, mani\" Ray saw Robby Falkner standing with Mike Ledbetter over by the Galaxian machine. Both of them were freshmen, and both of them were Nerd Club members in good standing. \"Yo, Ray!\" Mike called, in a voice that hadn\u0027t yet lost its childhood squeak. Ray walked to them, glad to see anybody he knew. He noted a \u0027Gade standing near the back, playing pinball; the boy\u0027s name was Stoplight, because his hair was dyed red on top and green on the sides.\n \"How\u0027s it goin\u0027i\" Robby gave Ray a high five while Mike concentrated on beating a few more points out of Galaxian.\n \"Okay. How about youi\" \"I\u0027ll do. Man, that was neat about the chopper, huhi I saw it take off. Man, that was neat!\" \"I saw it too,\" Mike commented. \"Know what I heardi It wasn\u0027t any meteor that fell, no way! It was a satellite the Russians put up. One of those death satellites, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s radioactive.\" \"Yeah, well you know what Billy Thellman heardi\" Robby leaned in closer, gathering the other boys together to share a secret. \"It wasn\u0027t any meteor or a satellite.\" \"So what was iti\" Ray kept his voice cool.\n \"It was a jet. a super-secret jet that crashed. Billy Thellman said he knew somebody who drove out there to see it, only the air-force men have got Cobre Road blocked off. So this guy started out on foot, and he walked and walked until he came across this crane scoopin\u0027 pieces of somethin\u0027 off the ground, and all these men in radiation suits. anyway, they stopped this guy out there and they took his name and address and they got his fingerprints on a little white card too. They said they could take him to jail for sneakin\u0027 around out there.\" \"Gnarly,\" Mike said.\n \"Right. So they asked him what he\u0027d seen, and he told \u0027em, and that\u0027s when they let him in on the secret. Billy says he heard it was an F-911, and that was the only one the air force had.\" \"Wow,\" Ray said.\n \"Man, look at her!\" Mike whispered, furtively motioning to a lean blond girl who hung on the shoulder of a boy playing Gunfighter. \"That\u0027s Laurie Rainey. Man, I hear she can just about suck the chrome off a fender!\" \"Smash fox,\" Robby observed. \"She\u0027s got skinny legs, though.\" \"Man, you wouldn\u0027t think they were skinny if they were wrapped around your ass! Shit!\" Mike thumped the Galaxian machine with his fist, because the game had ended and he hadn\u0027t beat his best score. Old eagle eyes Kennishaw saw it, and hollered, \"Hey, boy! Don\u0027t you hit on the machines!\" His ire vented, he returned to his magazine.\n The three boys drifted past Laurie Rainey for a closer look, and were rewarded with a whiff of her perfume. She was holding on to her date\u0027s belt, which Mike pointed out in a whisper was a sure sign that a girl was hotter than a short-fused firecracker.\n \"How come you\u0027re so quieti\" Robby asked Ray when they\u0027d wandered over to the row of pinball machines.\n \"Mei I\u0027m not quiet.\" \"are so. Man, you\u0027re usually jawin\u0027 up a storm. Folks on your casei\" \"No.\" \"So what it is, theni\" Robby leaned against a machine and cleaned his fingernails with a match.\n \"Nothin\u0027. I\u0027m just quiet, that\u0027s all.\" It burned in him, but he knew he must not spill it.\n Mike jabbed him in the ribs. \"I think you\u0027re hidin\u0027 somethin\u0027, cockhead.\" \"No, I\u0027m not. Really.\" Ray dug his hands into his pockets and stared at a spot on the discolored linoleum. That crap about an F-911 had almost brought a laugh out, and he struggled not to smile. \"Forget it.\" \"Forget whati\" Robby asked, fired up by the idea that a secret was being kept. \"Come on, X Ray! Let\u0027s hear it!\" It was so close to being told. In one more minute, he might be the most sought-after kid in Inferno. all kinds of smash foxes would be crowding around to hear. But no, he couldn\u0027t do it! It wasn\u0027t right! Still, his mouth was starting to open, and what would come out of it he didn\u0027t know. He was forming the words in his mind: Let\u0027s just say I know it wasn\u0027t any damned F-9 - \"Looky here, looky here! Where\u0027s your girlfriend, fuckmeati\" Ray knew that slurred, dark-toned voice. He whirled toward the doorway.\n Three of them were standing there: Paco LeGrande, a plastic splint along the bridge of his nose and bandages stuck to his cheeks and forehead to secure it; Ruben Hermosa, grinning and damp-faced, his eyes bloodshot on weed; and Juan Diegas, another husky Rattlesnake.\n Paco limped just a little as he took two steps forward, his combat boots clunking on the floor. all conversations within the Warp Room had ceased, all attention riveted to the invaders. \"I asked you where your girlfriend was,\" Paco repeated, smiling thinly, his face swollen and purple circles ringing his eyes. He cracked his knuckles. \"She\u0027s not around to save your skinny ass, is shei\" \"attention, earthlings!\" the Star Hunter\u0027s speaker boomed. \"Do you dare do battle with Star Hunteri Prepare for action! Prepare to be destroyed!\" \"Oh, shit,\" Mike Ledbetter whispered, and quickly backpedaled from Ray\u0027s side. Robby stood his ground a few seconds longer before he, too, abandoned Ray to his fate.\n \"You\u0027d better get out, man!\" It was Stoplight. \"You\u0027re on \u0027Gade territory!\" \"Was I talkin\u0027 to youi Shut your hole, you fuckin\u0027 freak!\" Stoplight wasn\u0027t nearly as big as the boys who blocked the door, and he knew he had no chance against them. \"We don\u0027t want any trou - \" \"Shut up!\" Juan Diegas roared. \"Your ass is mine, fucker!\" Kennishaw was on his feet. \"Listen here! I won\u0027t have that kind of language in - \" With one quick, enraged motion, Paco turned and grasped a pinball machine. Muscles twitched in his forearms, and he threw the entire thing over on its side. Tilt bells rang madly, glass shattered, and sparks shot from the machine\u0027s innards.\n The other kids trembled like live wires in a high wind. Kennishaw\u0027s face reddened, and he reached for the pay phone on the wall, his hand digging for a quarter.\n \"You want to keep that hand, you sonofabitchi\" Paco asked him - not loudly, just matter-of-factly. Kennishaw saw the fury in the boy\u0027s eyes, and fear lanced him; he blinked, his mouth working but making no noise. The red cast of his face was fading to gray. He pulled his hand out of his pocket, quarterless.\n \"Muchas gracias.\" Paco sneered. His gaze jerked back to Ray Hammond. \"You had a real good laugh at me today, didn\u0027t youi\" Ray shook his head. Paco\u0027s eyes were inflamed, and Ray knew all three Rattlers had to be in the stratosphere on maryjane or they wouldn\u0027t have dared come to the Warp Room.\n \"You callin\u0027 me a liar, you li\u0027l fruiti\" Two more strides, and Paco was within strike range.\n \"No.\" Juan and Ruben laughed. Ruben leapt up, grabbed a papier-mache model of Saturn and yanked it off its wire. Juan slammed into the aqua Marines machine like a mad bull and crashed it to the floor.\n \"Please... don\u0027t...\" Kennishaw begged, plastered against the wall like a butterfly.\n \"I say you are,\" Paco prodded. \"I say I heard you laughin\u0027 at me, and now you\u0027re callin\u0027 me a liar.\" If his heart beat any harder, Ray figured he was going to sound like a human drum. He almost retreated from Paco, but what was the pointi There was nowhere to run. He had to stand and deal with it, and hope that some \u0027Gades would walk through the door real soon.\n \"Nobody wants to fight, man!\" Stoplight said. \"Why don\u0027t you take offi\" Paco grinned. \"I want to fight.\" and there was a crash and sizzle of sparks as Juan threw over another machine. Paco stared fixedly at Ray. \"I told you, didn\u0027t Ii I told you to stay out of my way.\" Ray swallowed. Laurie Rainey was watching, and Robby, and Mike, and all the others. He knew he was about to be beaten; that was a fact. But there were worse things, and one of them was cringing. He felt a tight grin ripple across his mouth, saw that it puzzled even Paco for a second. Ray stepped forward to meet him, and said, \"Fuck you.\" The blow was so fast he didn\u0027t even see it coming. It hit him in the jaw, lifted him off his feet, and knocked him into the Neutron machine. He went down on his knees, his glasses hanging from one ear and the taste of blood in his mouth. Paco\u0027s fist closed on his shirt, began to reel him to his feet.\n Stoplight ran for the door, but Juan Diegas was quick; he aimed a kick that hit Stoplight in the shoulder and brought a yell of pain from him. Stoplight fell, and at once Juan was on him, flailing with his fists.\n Ray saw Paco\u0027s leering face above him. He raised his fist to strike that face, but his arm was caught and pinned. Behind Paco, Ruben was leaping up, whooping with glee every time he plucked a planet off its wire.\n Paco\u0027s fist lifted. It looked giant-sized, the knuckles scarred and rough.\n Ray thrashed to escape, balanced on the toes of his sneakers. He could find no traction.\n The fist reared back, hesitated - then whammed forward.\n His mouth bleeding, Ray skidded backward under a pinball machine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-20.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
