You know that as well as I do.\" Matt Rhodes smiled faintly and lit a cigarette. He was sitting across from Jessie in a back booth at the Brandin\u0027 Iron Cafe on Celeste Street, a small but tidy place with, appropriately, branding irons adorning the walls, red-checked tablecloths, and red vinyl seats. The specialty was the Big Beef Burger, the meat patty seared with the Brandin\u0027 Iron\u0027s private Double X brand; the remnants of a burger lay on the plate in front of Rhodes. \"Okay, Dr. Hammond,\" he said when he\u0027d gotten the cigarette going. \"Tell me what it was, then.\" She shrugged. \"How am I supposed to knowi I\u0027m not in the air force.\" \"No, but you seemed to have seen the object clearly enough. Come on, give me your opinion.\" Sue Mullinax, a big-hipped, big-boned blond woman who wore way too much makeup and had gentle, childlike brown eyes, came over with a coffeepot and poured another cup for both of them. Ten years ago, Sue had been head cheerleader at Preston High. as she walked away, she left the scent of Giorgio in her wake. \"It was a machine,\" Jessie ventured when Sue was out of earshot. \"a secret kind of airplane, maybe. Like one of those Stealth bombers - \" Rhodes laughed, cigarette smoke bursting from his nostrils. \"Lady, you read too many spy novels! anyway, everybody and his aunt Nellie knows about the Stealth by now; it\u0027s sure as hell not a secret anymore.\" \"If not a Stealth, then something just as important,\" she went on, undaunted. \"I saw a piece of it, covered with symbols. They could\u0027ve been Japanese, I guess. Or maybe a combination of Japanese and Russian. I\u0027m sure they weren\u0027t english. Want to tell me about thati\" The man\u0027s smile faded. He looked out the window, showing her a hawklike profile. Not far away, the helicopter still stood in the middle of Preston Park, drawing a crowd. Captain Gunniston sat at the counter, drinking a cup of coffee and warding off questions from Cecil Thorsby, the balloon-bellied cook and owner. \"I think we\u0027re back to my original inquiry,\" the colonel said after another moment. \"I\u0027d like to know what damaged your pickup truck.\" \"and I want to know what fell.\" She\u0027d decided not to tell him about the black ball until she got some answers; Stevie seemed to be safe with it, and there was no hurry to give it up.\\n\\n He sighed, stared at her through slightly slitted, hard eyes. \"Lady, I don\u0027t know who you think you are, but - \" \"Doctor,\" Jessie said. \"I\u0027m a doctor. I wish you\u0027d stop patronizing me.\" Rhodes nodded. \"Doctor it is.\" Change tactics, he thought. She wasn\u0027t as dumb as lumber, like the sheriff and mayor. \"Okay. If I told you what it was, you\u0027d have to sign a lot of top-security forms, probably even have to make the trip to Webb. The red tape\u0027s enough to make a strong man cry, but after it\u0027s wrapped around your neck, you\u0027re sworn not to reveal anything on penalty of a very long free room and board courtesy of Uncle Sam.\" He hesitated to let that image sink in. \"Is that what you want, Dr. Hammondi\" \"I want to hear the truth. Not bullshit. I want to hear it now, and then I\u0027ll tell you what I know.\" He worked the knuckles of one hand and tried his best to look unutterably grim. \"We snared a Soviet helicopter a few months ago. The pilot flew it to Japan and defected. The chopper\u0027s bristling with weaponry, infrareds and sensors, and it\u0027s got a laser targeting system we\u0027ve been wanting to get our hands on for a long time.\" He smoked his cigarette down a little further. No one else was in the cafe but Gunniston, Cecil, and Sue Mullinax, but the colonel kept his voice just above a whisper. \"The technicians were running tests on the equipment at Holloman aFB in New Mexico - but there was trouble. evidently one of the technicians who\u0027d gotten through security was a deep-cover agent, and he grabbed the chopper and took off. Holloman asked us to help catch him, because he looked to be heading to the Gulf. Probably was going to be met by Soviet fighters from Cuba. anyway, we shot him down. No other choice. The chopper was going to pieces just as he crossed your path; now we\u0027ve got to pick them up and get out before the press comes hunting us.\" He stabbed his cigarette into an ashtray. \"That\u0027s it. You might read the whole story in Time next week if we don\u0027t keep the lid on.\" Jessie watched him carefully. He was intent on crushing all signs of life from his cigarette. She said, \"I didn\u0027t see any rotors.\" \"Jesus!\" Rhodes\u0027s voice was a little too loud, and both Cecil and Gunniston looked over at their booth. \"I\u0027ve told you what I know, la - Dr. Hammond. Take it or leave it, but remember this: you\u0027re withholding information from the United States government, and that can get you and your entire family in some real hot water.\" \"I don\u0027t care to be threatened.\" \"I don\u0027t care to play games! Now: did a piece of the machine hit your trucki What exactly happenedi\" Jessie finished her coffee, taking her time about it. She\u0027d seen no rotors; how could it have been a helicopteri Still, it had all been so fast. Maybe she didn\u0027t remember what she\u0027d seen, or maybe the rotors had already been blown off. Rhodes was waiting for her to speak, and she knew she had to tell him: \"Yes,\" she said. \"The truck got hit. a piece of the thing went right through our engine; you saw the hole. It was a black sphere, about so big.\" She showed him with her hands. \"It shot out of the thing and came straight at us. But the really weird part is that the sphere only seems to weigh a few ounces, and it\u0027s made out of either glass or plastic but there isn\u0027t a scratch on it. I don\u0027t know anything about Russian technology, but if they could create a floor wax that tough, we need to get our hands on - \" \"Just a minute, please.\" Rhodes had leaned forward. \"a black sphere. You actually picked it upi Wasn\u0027t it hoti\" \"No. It was cool - which was strange, because the other pieces were still smoking.\" \"Did this sphere have symbols on it tooi\" She shook her head. \"No, it was unmarked.\" \"Okay.\" There was a quaver of excitement in his voice. \"So you left the sphere near where your truck wasi\" \"No. We brought it with us.\" Colonel Rhodes\u0027s eyes widened.\\n\\n \"My daughter\u0027s got it right now. Over at my house.\" She didn\u0027t like the amazed expression on his face, or the pulse that beat at his temple. \"Whyi What is iti Some kind of compu - \" \"Gunny!\" Rhodes got to his feet, and at once Gunniston was off the counter stool and standing as well. \"Pay the man!\" He took Jessie\u0027s elbow, but she pulled away. He took it again, his grip firm. \"Dr. Hammond, will you escort us to your house, pleasei as quickly as possiblei\" They left the Brandin\u0027 Iron, and outside Jessie wrenched angrily away. Rhodes did not try to grasp her arm again but he stayed right at her side, with Gunniston a few paces behind. They went around Preston Park, avoiding the gawkers who were pestering Jim Taggart, the \u0027copter pilot. Jessie\u0027s heart was pounding, and she quickened her pace to what was almost a run; the two men stayed with her. \"What\u0027s inside the spherei\" she asked Rhodes, but he did not - or could not - answer. \"It\u0027s not going to explode, is iti\" again, no reply.\\n\\n at the house Jessie was glad to see that Stevie had remembered to relock the door - she was learning responsibility - but at the same time had to spend a few precious seconds fumbling with her keys. She got the right one into the lock and opened the door. Rhodes and Gunniston followed her inside, and the captain closed the door firmly behind them.\\n\\n \"Stevie!\" Jessie called. \"Where are youi\" Stevie didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n White light streamed between the window blinds and gridded the walls. \"Stevie!\" Jessie strode into the kitchen. The cat-faced clock ticked, and the air conditioning hissed and labored. a chair had been left near the counter; a cupboard was open, an empty glass in the sink. Thirsty from all that running, she thought. But Stevie wouldn\u0027t have left the house again, would shei If she had... oh, was she going to be in for trouble! Jessie went through the den - nothing disturbed in there - and into the hallway that led to the bedrooms. Rhodes and Gunniston were right behind her. \"Stevie!\" Jessie called again, really getting jittery now. Where could she have gonei\\n\\n She was almost to the door of Stevie\u0027s bedroom when two hands thrust out along the floor, the fingers grasping at the beige carpet.\\n\\n Jessie abruptly stopped, and Rhodes bumped into her.\\n\\n They were Stevie\u0027s hands, of course. Jessie watched the sinews move in them as the fingers dug at the carpet for traction, and then Stevie\u0027s head came into view - her auburn hair damp with sweat, her face puffy and moist, droplets of sweat sparkling on her cheeks. The hands pulled Stevie\u0027s body further into the hallway, muscles twitching in her bare arms. She continued, inch by inch, into the hall, and Jessie\u0027s hand flew to her mouth. Stevie\u0027s legs trailed behind her, the sneaker gone from the left foot, as if the child might be paralyzed from the waist down.\\n\\n \"Ste - \" Jessie\u0027s voice cracked.\\n\\n The child stopped crawling. Her head slowly, slowly lifted, and Jessie saw her eyes: lifeless, like the painted eyes of a doll.\\n\\n Stevie trembled, drew one leg beneath her with what appeared to be painful effort, and began to try to stand.\\n\\n \"Back up,\" Jessie heard Rhodes say; he grasped her arm and pulled her back when she didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Stevie had the other leg under her. She wavered, a drop of sweat falling from her chin. Her face was emotionless, composed, remote. and her eyes: a doll\u0027s eyes, yes - but now Jessie could see a flicker in them like lightning: a fierceness, a mighty determination that she\u0027d never seen before. She thought, crazily, That\u0027s not Stevie.\\n\\n But the little girl\u0027s body was rising to its feet. The face remained remote, but when the body had finally reached its full height, what might have been a quick smile of accomplishment darted across the mouth.\\n\\n One foot moved forward, as if balancing on a tightwire. The second, sneakerless foot followed - and suddenly Stevie trembled again and the body fell forward. Jessie didn\u0027t have time to catch her daughter; Stevie toppled to the carpet on her face, her hands writhing in midair as if they no longer knew quite what to do.\\n\\n She lay face down, the breath hitching in her body.\\n\\n \"Is she... is she retardedi\" Gunniston asked.\\n\\n Jessie pulled free from Colonel Rhodes and bent down beside her daughter. The body was shaking, muscles twitching in the shoulders and back. Jessie touched her arm - and felt a shock travel through her hand that left the nerves jangling and raw; she instantly pulled her hand back, before the shock wave reached her shoulder. Stevie\u0027s skin was damp and unnaturally cool, much as the black sphere had been. The child\u0027s head lifted, the eyes staring into hers without recognition, and Jessie saw blood creeping from Stevie\u0027s nostrils where she\u0027d banged against the floor.\\n\\n It was too much for her, and she came close to fainting. The hallway elongated and twisted like a funhouse\u0027s corridor; but then somebody was helping Jessie to her feet. It was Rhodes, his breath smelling of a cigarette, and this time she didn\u0027t fight him. \"Where\u0027s the spherei\" she heard him ask. She shook her head. \"She\u0027s out of it, Colonel,\" Gunniston said. \"Jesus, what\u0027s wrong with the kidi\" \"Check her room out. Maybe the sphere\u0027s in there - but for God\u0027s sake, be careful!\" \"Right.\" Gunniston stepped around Stevie\u0027s body and entered the bedroom.\\n\\n Jessie\u0027s legs sagged. \"Call an ambulance... call Dr. McNeil.\" \"We will. Take it easy, now. Come on.\" He helped her out of the hallway and into the den, where he guided her to a chair. She settled into it, sick and dizzy. \"Listen to me, Dr. Hammond.\" Rhodes\u0027s voice was low and calm. \"Did you bring anything else back from the site except the spherei\" \"No.\" \"anything else about it that you haven\u0027t told mei Could you see anything inside iti\" \"No. Nothing. Oh God... I\u0027ve got to call my husband.\" \"Just sit still for a few minutes.\" He restrained her from getting up, which wasn\u0027t too hard since her muscles felt like wet spaghetti. \"Who found the sphere, and howi\" \"Tyler Lucas found it. He lives out there. Wait. Wait.\" There was something she hadn\u0027t told him, after all. \"Stevie said... she said she heard it singing.\" \"Singingi\" \"Yes. Only I couldn\u0027t hear anything. I thought... you know, the wreck had shaken her up.\" Jessie ran a hand over her forehead; she felt feverish, everything spinning out of control. She looked up into Rhodes\u0027s face and saw that his tan had paled. \"What\u0027s going oni There wasn\u0027t a Russian helicopter, was therei\" He hesitated a second too long, and Jessie said, \"Tell me, dammit!\" \"No,\" he answered promptly. \"There wasn\u0027t.\" She thought she was about to throw up, and she kept one hand pressed against her forehead as if in anticipation of another shock. \"The sphere. What is iti\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He lifted a hand before she could protest. \"I swear to God I don\u0027t. But...\" His face tightened; he fought against telling her, but to hell with regulations; she had to know. \"I think you brought back a fragment from a spacecraft. an extraterrestrial spacecraft. That\u0027s what came down this morning. That\u0027s what we were chasing.\" She stared at him.\\n\\n \"It caught fire in the atmosphere,\" he went on. \"Our radars picked it up, and we figured its point of impact. Only it veered toward Inferno, as if... the pilot was trying to make it closer to town before he crashed. The craft started going to pieces. There\u0027s not much left, just a mangle of stuff that\u0027s too hot for anybody to get close to. anyway, the sphere is part of it - and I want to find out exactly what it is, and why that didn\u0027t burn up too.\" She couldn\u0027t speak. But this was the truth; she saw it in his face. \"You didn\u0027t answer Gunny\u0027s question,\" Rhodes said. \"Is your little girl mentally retardedi Does she have epilepsyi any other conditioni\" Condition, Jessie thought. What a diplomatic way of asking if Stevie was out of her mind. \"No. She\u0027s never had any - \" Jessie stopped, because Stevie was lurching out of the hallway on rubbery legs, her arms dangling at her sides. Her head swiveled slowly from right to left and back again, and she came into the room without speaking. Jessie stood up, ready to catch her if the child stumbled again, but Stevie\u0027s legs were working better now. Still, she walked strangely - putting one foot precisely in front of the other as if treading on a skyscraper\u0027s ledge. Jessie stood up, and Stevie stopped with one foot poised in the air.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the black ball, honeyi What\u0027d you do with iti\" Stevie stared at her, her head cocked slightly to one side. Then, with slow grace, the other foot touched the floor and she continued on, gliding more than walking; she approached a wall and stood before it, seemingly absorbed by the pattern of sunlight on the paint.\\n\\n \"Not in there, Colonel.\" Gunniston walked into the den. \"I checked the closet, the chest of drawers, under the bed, the toybox - everything.\" He glanced uneasily at the little girl. \"Uh... what do we do now, siri\" Stevie turned, a motion as precise and sharp as a dancer\u0027s. Her gaze fixed on Gunniston and stayed there, then moved to Rhodes, finally latching on to Jessie. Jessie\u0027s heart fluttered; her daughter\u0027s expression revealed only a clinical curiosity, but neither emotion nor recognition. It was how a vet might look at an unfamiliar animal. Stevie began that strange gliding walk again, her knees still wobbly, and she went to a series of framed photographs on a shelf at the bookcase. She looked at each in turn: one of Jessie and Tom alone, one of the family taken on vacation in Galveston a couple of years ago, one of Ray and herself on horseback at the state fair, two more of Tom\u0027s and Jessie\u0027s parents. Her fingers twitched, but she didn\u0027t attempt to use her hands. She moved past the bookcase and the television set, halted again to gaze at a wall-mounted painting of the desert that Bess Lucas had done - a painting she\u0027d seen a hundred times, Jessie thought - and then she continued a few steps more to the doorway between the den and kitchen. She stopped; her right arm lifted, as if battling gravity, and she used her elbow to feel the doorframe.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really know,\" Rhodes replied finally. He sounded as if all the breath had been punched out of him. \"Honest to God, I don\u0027t.\" \"I do!\" Jessie shouted. \"My daughter needs a doctor!\" She started toward the telephone. The Inferno Health Clinic was a small white stone building a couple of blocks away, and Dr. earl Lee - early - McNeil had been Inferno\u0027s resident physician for almost forty years. He was a crusty hell-raiser who smoked black cigars, drove a red dune buggy, and drank straight tequila at the Bob Wire Club, but he knew his business and he\u0027d know how to help Stevie too. She picked up the receiver and started to dial.\\n\\n a finger came down on the disconnect button.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s wait just a minute, Dr. Hammond,\" Rhodes told her. \"Okayi Let\u0027s talk about - \" \"Get your hand off the phone. Now, damn you!\" \"Coloneli\" Gunniston said.\\n\\n \"Please.\" Rhodes grasped the receiver. \"Let\u0027s don\u0027t bring anyone else into this yet, not until we know what we\u0027re dealing - \" \"I said I\u0027m calling Dr. McNeil!\" Jessie was furious, close either to tears or to slapping him across the face.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s moving again, Colonel,\" Gunniston told him, and this time both Rhodes and Jessie broke off their argument.\\n\\n Stevie was gliding to another wall, crisscrossed with sunlight. She stopped before it, stood, and stared. She lifted her right hand, turning it back and forth as if she\u0027d never seen a hand before; the fingers wiggled. Then she touched her bloody nose with her thumb and regarded the blood for a few seconds. Looked at the wall again. Her hand moved forward, and her thumb drew a vertical line of blood on the beige wall. Her thumb went back for more blood, drew a second vertical line a few inches to the right of the first.\\n\\n More blood. a horizontal line cut the two verticals.\\n\\n \"What the hell... i\" Rhodes breathed, stepping forward.\\n\\n a second horizontal line formed a neat grid on the wall. Stevie\u0027s blood-smeared thumb went to the center space, and made a small, precise O.\\n\\n Her head turned. She looked at Rhodes and glided back from the wall, one foot placed behind the other.\\n\\n \"Your pen,\" Rhodes said to Gunniston. \"Give me your pen. Hurry!\" The captain gave it over. Rhodes clicked the point out and walked to the wall. He drew an X in the lower right space.\\n\\n Stevie stuck her thumb up a nostril and drew a red O in the center left space.\\n\\n Jessie watched the game of tic-tac-toe in tortured silence. Her gut was churning and a scream pounded against her gritted teeth. This creature with a bleeding nose wore Stevie\u0027s skin, but it was not Stevie. and if that were so, what had happened to her daughteri Where was Stevie\u0027s mind, her voice, her souli Jessie\u0027s hands clenched into fists, and she thought for a terrible second that the scream was going to escape and when that happened it would be all over. She trembled, praying that the nightmare would snap like a bad heat spell and she would be in bed with Tom calling that breakfast was ready. Dear God, dear God, dear God... Stevie - or the thing that masqueraded as Stevie - blocked the colonel\u0027s win. In the next move, Rhodes blocked Stevie\u0027s win.\\n\\n Stevie stared at Rhodes for a moment, looked again at the grid, then back to Rhodes. The face rippled, unfamiliar muscles working. a smile moved across the mouth, but the lips were stiff and unresponsive. She laughed - a whuff! of air forced through the vocal cords. The smile broadened, pushing the lips aside to show Stevie\u0027s teeth. The face, beaming, became almost the face of a child again.\\n\\n Rhodes cautiously returned the smile and nodded his head. Stevie\u0027s head nodded, with more deliberate effort. Still smiling, she turned away and glided into the hall with her slow wirewalker\u0027s gait.\\n\\n Rhodes\u0027s palms were sweating. \"Well,\" he said, his voice tense and raspy, \"I believe we\u0027ve got a situation here, don\u0027t you, Gunnyi\" \"I\u0027d say so, sir.\" Gunniston\u0027s spit-and-polish veneer was cracking. His heart boomed and his knees shook, because he\u0027d realized the same thing as Colonel Rhodes: the little girl was either totally freaked out, or she was no longer truly a little girl. and why or how something like that could be was far beyond his logical, four-square mind.\\n\\n They heard a voice - an exhalation of breath that made a voice, a weirdly chirring sound like wind through reeds: \"ahhhhhh. ahhhhhh. ahhhhhh.\" Jessie was the first one to Stevie\u0027s room. Stevie - not-Stevie - was standing before the bulletin board; her - its - right hand was extended, the finger pointing to the construction-paper alphabet letters. \"ahhhhhh. ahhhhhh,\" the voice continued, trying to grasp a remembered sound. The face contorted with the effort of enunciation. Then: \"ahhhha a. a.\" Pointed to the next letter. \"Beeeee. Ceeeee. Deeeee. eeeeee. effff. Geeeee.\" There was consternation over the next.\\n\\n \"H,\" Jessie said softly.\\n\\n \"Chah. achah. H.\" The head turned, eyes questioning.\\n\\n My God, Jessie thought. She grasped the doorframe to keep from falling. an alien with a Texas accent, wearing my little girl\u0027s skin and hair and clothes. She was about to choke on a scream. \"Where\u0027s my daughteri\" she said. Her eyes brimmed. \"Give her back to me.\" What appeared to be a little girl was waiting, pointing to the next letter.\\n\\n \"Give her back to me,\" Jessie repeated. She lunged forward before Rhodes could stop her. \"Give her back!\" she shouted, and then Jessie had the figure\u0027s cool arm and was spinning it around, looking into the face that used to be her daughter\u0027s. \"Give her back!\" Jessie lifted her hand and slapped the face hard across the cheek.\\n\\n The Stevie-creature staggered back, its knees almost collapsing. It kept its backbone straight and rigid, but its head bobbed from side to side for a few seconds like one of those absurd kewpie dolls that nod in the rear windshields of cars. It blinked, perhaps registering pain, and Jessie watched, newly horrified, as the red blotch of her palm came up on Stevie\u0027s skin.\\n\\n Because it was still her daughter\u0027s flesh, even though something else had crawled inside it. Still her daughter\u0027s face, hair, and body. The not-Stevie touched the red palmprint on her cheek and swiveled toward the alphabet letters again; she pointed insistently at the next.\\n\\n \"I,\" Colonel Rhodes offered.\\n\\n \"Iyah,\" the creature said. The finger moved.\\n\\n \"J.\" Rhodes glanced quickly at Gunniston as the letter was laboriously repeated. \"I think it\u0027s figured out the sounds are the base of our language. Jesus, Gunny! What have we got herei\" The captain shook his head. \"I wouldn\u0027t care to guess, sir.\" Jessie stared at the back of Stevie\u0027s head. The hair was the same as it had always been, only wet with sweat. and in it were flecks of... what were theyi Her fingers touched the hair, and picked out a small piece of something pink, like cotton candy. Insulation, she realized. What were pink bits of insulation doing in Stevie\u0027s hairi She let the piece drift to the floor, her mind clogged and beginning to skip tracks. Her face had gone gray with shock.\\n\\n \"Take her out, Gunny,\" Rhodes commanded, and Gunniston led Jessie from the bedroom before she passed out.\\n\\n \"K,\" Rhodes continued, responding to the moving finger.\\n\\n \"Kah. K,\" the creature managed to say.\\n\\n Outside, the two trucks - one hauling a crane and the other marked aLLIeD VaN LINeS - turned off Republica Road and passed by Preston Park on Cobre Road, heading for the desert site where something that had once been a machine had burned to a blue-green ooze. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-12.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
