{"id":83412,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"Cody heard Miranda moan. She was coming to, and Cody crawled across the leathery floor to her.\n \"My head... my head,\" she whispered, pressing her hand against the blue bruise and knot on her forehead above her left eye. Her eyelids fluttered, and she tried to open them but they were just too heavy.\n \"She gonna be all righti\" Cody glanced over at Sarge, who sat about five feet away with his arms locked around his knees. Sarge\u0027s face had taken on a chalky cast in the violet glow of the cage\u0027s bars. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Cody said. \"She took a pretty hard knock.\" She was still moaning, her voice softer as she drifted off again. Cody had spat up a little blood, and he was breathing in gasps around the pain of a broken rib, but otherwise he was okay. He was more mad than scared, and his muscles were pumped full of adrenaline. Miranda lay still again. Cody checked her pulse for the sixth or seventh time; it felt a little slow to him, but at least it was strong. She was a lot tougher than she looked.\n Cody stood up, holding his side, and made another circle of their cage. It was a cone about fifteen feet around, with bars of purple light. He\u0027d already tested the bars by kicking at them, and the sole of his boot had been burned almost clean through, fiery speckles of melting rubber shearing off and those bits exploding again as they went into the bars. What those beams would do to flesh he didn\u0027t want to know. The entire cage was suspended about three feet off the floor, which was made of interlocked black scales.\n He didn\u0027t know what he\u0027d expected the inside of the spaceship to look like - maybe full of high-tech, polished chrome gizmos that whirred with mysterious purpose; but this place smelled like an overflowed cesspool and puddles of ooze shimmered on the floor. Pipes that looked as if they were made of diseased dinosaur bones hung from the ceiling and snaked along the walls, and from them came a rushing, thrumming sound of something liquid passing through. The musty air was so cold and damp that Cody could see his breath, but the chill had sharpened his senses. The impression he got of the spaceship was that it was not a marvel of alien technology, but rather the inside of a medieval castle that lacked heat, electricity, and sanitation. Slime festooned the bony pipes, and when it dripped, it made slithering sounds on the floor. One thing he thought he\u0027d seen but couldn\u0027t be sure of: not only were the floor\u0027s scales absorbing the ooze, but every so often they seemed to swell an inch or two upward and deflate again, as if they were alive and breathing.\n Cody stopped his circling. He stood close to the bars but could feel no sensation of heat; the beams burned with a cold fire. On the chamber\u0027s floor was a small black pyramid about the size of a shoebox. He\u0027d seen Stinger\u0027s boot touch that pyramid when his head was dangling down and the thing\u0027s arm was about to crush him. The pyramid had glowed from within with dim violet light. There\u0027d been a droning noise, and the next thing he knew he and Miranda were being dumped onto a black dish that turned out to be the cage\u0027s floor. as the cage\u0027s bars had illuminated, the cage itself had ascended.\n Later - and how much later Cody didn\u0027t know because his brain was still jammed up - a creature with Mack Cade\u0027s face and the head and shoulders of a dog growing from its chest had entered the chamber carrying another body. Cody had watched as the creature\u0027s boot had touched the pyramid. The violet light had come on, the cage had begun to settle, and when it reached the floor the beams had extinguished. Then Sarge Dennison had been added to the cage, the creature had touched the pyramid once more, and the bars had flickered to life. again the cage rose off the floor, and Stinger had looked at Sarge and asked his name, just as he\u0027d asked Cody what the girl\u0027s name was. It had taken Sarge a few seconds to even understand what the question was, but finally he\u0027d stuttered his name out and Stinger had left - but not before Cody had seen the black sphere gripped between the dog\u0027s jaws.\n He stared at the small pyramid, now dark. an on-off switch, Cody assumed. Touching it would lower the cage and turn off the bars. But it was three feet below them and at least another three feet beyond the cage\u0027s edge. Way too far to reach, even if he could get his arm between the bars without burning it off up to the elbow. Still... that was the only way out he could see, and he didn\u0027t know what Stinger had planned for them but he figured it wouldn\u0027t be pleasant.\n He dug into his pocket and came up with a dime, four pennies, and his lighter. How much pressure was needed to trip the switchi The weight of the lighter hitting it might be enough - but he quickly dismissed that idea, because if the lighter was punctured, the fluid would explode all over the cage. He put the lighter back in his pocket, lay down on his stomach, and stretched his flattened hand toward the bars edge-on while his thumb trapped the coins. The space between the bars was wide enough to accept his hand, and he kept gliding his wrist through, grateful for his slim build. The pain in his ribs flared up again; when he gasped for breath, the movement made his arm drift a fraction to the right.\n The hair on his forearm crisped, burning away with faint crackling noises. Cody held himself as still as he could, but the effort was making his arm shake. Now his palm was sweating. He tried to get the coins in position to flick them at the small pyramid, and he promptly lost the dime and one of the pennies, which fell straight down to the floor. His hand was cramping, and he had no time to aim: he flung both coins out with a snap of his wrist, saw one hit beyond the pyramid and the other to the left.\n \"Shit!\" he said, and pulled his arm and hand back through the bars. all the hair up to the middle of his forearm had been burned away, but his skin was untouched. another fraction of an inch, though, and the cage would smell of burned meat. His arm was trembling right down into the shoulder socket, and he saw that tripping that switch was pretty much hopeless. He crawled away from the edge and sat back on his haunches, rubbing his shoulder. He looked up; overhead eight feet or so the violet beams merged together at the top of the cage, and the mechanism that hoisted the cage was somewhere above that. His gaze returned to the small pyramid on the floor. \"Got to be some way to reach it,\" he said.\n \"Reach whati\" Sarge asked.\n \"That thing there.\" Cody pointed down to it, and Sarge saw what he meant and nodded. \"I think it controls the cage. If I could trigger it with somethin\u0027 I might be able to - \" \"Codyi\" Miranda\u0027s voice was a pained whisper. She was trying to sit up, her eyes wide and bloodshot. \"Codyi\" He got to her side. \"Take it easy. Come on, just lie still.\" \"What happenedi Where are wei\" She looked around, saw the violet bars that circled them. \"Rick... where\u0027s Ricki\" \"Rick\u0027s okay,\" he lied. She blinked up at him. \"He made it over the bridge.\" \"We... hit something, didn\u0027t wei Oh... my head...\" Her hand found the bruise and knot. She winced, fresh tears trickling from the corners of her eyes. Her memory was hazy; she remembered a figure in front of them on the bridge, a jarring collision, and a sensation of falling. Mercifully there was nothing after that. \"are you all righti\" \"I\u0027ve been better.\" Cody smoothed the damp curls away from her forehead. Concussion, he figured. \"Can you feel thisi\" He rubbed her hands, and she said, \"Yes.\" Then her ankles. \"Yes,\" Miranda responded, and Cody relaxed some. She had friction burns on her arms and a split and swollen lower lip, but he figured it could\u0027ve been a lot worse: a broken back, broken arms or legs - and surely a broken neck if Stinger hadn\u0027t been stopped.\n \"We hit... the Mumbler, didn\u0027t wei\" she asked.\n Cody smiled faintly. \"We sure did. Knocked him on his ass too.\" \"I... thought you said you could drive that motor.\" \"I think I did a pretty good job. We\u0027re not dead, are wei\" \"I\u0027m not sure yet.\" Now it was her turn to offer him the hint of a tough smile, though her eyes were still vague. \"I think I should\u0027ve stayed in Fort Worth.\" \"Yeah, but then you would never have met me.\" \"Bit shit,\" she said, and he knew she was going to be okay. The strength was coming back into her voice.\n He decided Miranda wasn\u0027t going to pass out again, and he had to tell her what had happened and where they were. \"We\u0027re inside the spaceship,\" he said. \"In what looks like a dungeon, I think. anyway, we\u0027re hangin\u0027 in Stinger\u0027s idea of a jail cell.\" He waited for her response, but there was none. \"Stinger could\u0027ve killed us. He didn\u0027t. He wants us alive, which is just fine with me.\" \"Me too,\" Sarge said, and Miranda lifted her head to see who\u0027d spoken. \"I\u0027m Sarge,\" he told her. \"This is Scooter right over here.\" He gestured into the empty space.\n \"Scooter\u0027s his dog,\" Cody quickly explained. \"Um... Sarge doesn\u0027t go anywhere without Scooter, if you get my drift.\" Miranda eased herself into a sitting position. Her head still pounded, but at least she could see straight now. She wasn\u0027t sure who was crazy and who wasn\u0027t, but then Sarge started rubbing an invisible dog and said, \"Don\u0027t you worry none, Scooter. I\u0027ll take care of you,\" and she realized Sarge lived in a permanent twilight zone.\n \"Sorry I got you into this,\" Cody said to her. \"You ought to be more particular who you ride with.\" \"Next time I will be.\" She tried to stand, but she felt so weak she had to rest her head against her knees. \"What\u0027s that thing keeping us fori\" \"I don\u0027t know. I wouldn\u0027t want to guess, either.\" Cody thought that the noise of fluid rushing through the pipes had gotten louder. There was another sound too: a distant reverberation, like a muffled bass drum or a heartbeat. Whole damn ship\u0027s alive, he thought. \"We\u0027ve got to get out of here.\" He crawled over to the cage\u0027s edge, just short of the light bars, and stared down at the small pyramid again. Got to trip that switch, he knew. But howi \"Don\u0027t happen to have a slingshot on you, do youi\" he asked half jokingly, and of course she shook her head no. He lay on his belly, his chin resting on his hands, and just looked at the pyramid. His belt buckle was jabbing his stomach, and he shifted his position.\n Belt buckle, he thought.\n He abruptly sat up, unbuckled the belt, and reeled it out of the loops.\n Sarge said, \"Hey, don\u0027t do that in front of a lady!\" \"How far would you say that thing isi\" he asked Miranda, and pointed at the pyramid.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Seven feet, maybe.\" \"I peg it closer to six and a half. I wear a twenty-eight-inch belt, and...\" He looked at Sarge, saw the scuffed black belt in the man\u0027s dungarees. \"Sarge, hand me your belt.\" \"My belti Boy, what\u0027s wrong with youi\" \"Take it off, Sarge! Come on, hurry!\" Sarge did, reluctantly, and handed it to Cody. \"What size is thisi\" Cody asked. Sarge shrugged. \"The church ladies buy all that stuff for me. I don\u0027t keep up with it.\" \"Looks a good forty inches.\" Cody was already knotting the two belts together so the buckles were on opposite ends. \"Maybe we\u0027ve got us a long enough reach here. We\u0027ll find out.\" He gave the knot a tug to make sure it wouldn\u0027t come apart.\n \"What\u0027re you going to doi\" Miranda asked.\n \"I\u0027m pretty sure that thing down there is the control box for this cage. I think that if I trip it, it\u0027ll lower the cage. So I might be able to get us out of here.\" \"Don\u0027t mind him,\" Sarge whispered to Scooter. \"He\u0027s crazy, that\u0027s all.\" \"Listen to me, both of you.\" The urgency in Cody\u0027s voice stopped Sarge\u0027s whispering. \"I\u0027m gonna slide my arm out through the bars as far as I can. If I can\u0027t keep steady, they\u0027ll burn my arm up real quick. Sarge, I want you to hold my legs. If my arm catches fire, I want you to pull me back as fast as you can. Got iti\" \"Mei Why mei\" \"Because you\u0027re a lot stronger than Miranda, and because she\u0027s gonna be keepin\u0027 an eye out if Stinger comes back. Okayi\" \"Okay,\" Sarge answered, in a small voice.\n Cody pushed the belt ahead of him between the bars, and the buckle on the other end went over the edge. Then Sarge grasped Cody\u0027s ankles as Cody slid forward with his face only inches from the beams. Slowly he eased his hand through, then his wrist, then up to the forearm where the hairs had been burned away. The buckle was lying on the floor just underneath the cage; now the trick was flicking his wrist to snap the buckle against the control box.\n His face was right up on the beams, and he could hear their deadly hum. Now was the time to try it if he ever was. He snapped his wrist upward. The belt buckle scraped along the floor, stopped two or three inches short of the pyramid. He drew it back and flicked it forward again; once more, the buckle fell short.\n Cody strained his arm another quarter inch between the bars. There was about enough room for a toothpick to fit in between them and his skin. a few hairs sparked and crisped away, in pinpoint flames. His heartbeat was making his body tremble. Steady... steady, he told himself. He flicked the belt forward. Still too short. a drop of sweat rolled into his right eye and blinded him, and his first impulse was to wipe it out, but if he moved without thinking, either his face or his arm would go into the bars. He said, \"Sarge, pull me back. Slow.\" Sarge hauled him away from the edge, and Cody kept his arm rigid until the fingers had cleared. Then he rubbed his eye with his other hand, got on his knees, and pulled the belt up. \"It\u0027s not long enough,\" he said. \"We need another couple of inches.\" But he knew there was nothing else to be used, and he was about to toss the knotted belts aside in frustration when Miranda said, \"Your earring.\" Cody\u0027s hand went to his earlobe. The skull earring hung down a little more than two inches. He took it off, knotted the small chain to one of the buckles so the silver skull had as much play as possible, then gripped the other buckle and said, \"Sarge, let\u0027s try it again.\" Working slowly and carefully, Cody dropped the buckle with the tiny skull dangling from it over the cage\u0027s edge and let its weight pull the rest of the belt down. Then he slid forward, Sarge grasping his ankles again, and negotiated his hand, wrist, and forearm between the violet bars. When he was set and ready, he snapped his wrist upward. This time he thought the extension would reach; again it just barely fell short of contact. He had to push another quarter inch of skin through.\n He started sliding his arm forward, millimeter by millimeter. Beads of sweat were heavy in his eyebrows, and one of them popped and sizzled as it touched a beam. a little more, he thought. Just a little more. The hairs on his arm were afire. a little more. Now he could see no room between his skin and the bars. a fraction more, that\u0027s all... There was a soft whuff as a lock of his hair grazed the bar before his face and caught fire. The flames crawled toward his scalp. Miranda cried out, \"Pull him back!\" He felt Sarge\u0027s hands tighten on his ankles, and at the same time Cody flicked the belt with a quick jerk of his wrist.\n He heard it: the metallic, almost musical tring of the silver skull hitting the control box. But whether that was contact enough to trip the switch he didn\u0027t know, and in the next second Sarge was hauling him away from the bars and Miranda was plucking away burning hair. The muscles in his forearm cramped rigid, and as the belt came up over the edge it wandered into one of the bars and was sliced in two as cleanly as by a white-hot blade. He lay on his back, rubbing the cramp out of his arm, the buckle still clenched in his hand.\n and then he realized, with a start, that the cage was descending.\n He sat up, a stubble of burned hair still smoking above his left eye. The pyramid glowed violet. The cage settled gently to the floor, and the circle of bars went dark. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-55.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
