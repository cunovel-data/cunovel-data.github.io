{"id":83390,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Rick Jurado stood in the front room of his house, staring through a cracked window toward the smoldering junkyard. Candles burned around the room, and his Paloma was softly crying.\n Mrs. Garracone, from a few doors down, was crying too, and her son Joey stood with his arm around her shoulders to steady her. Zarra was in the room, his bullwhip coiled around his arm, and Miranda sat on the sofa beside her grandmother, Paloma\u0027s hands in her own.\n Father Ortega waited for an answer to the question he\u0027d just posed. Mrs. Garracone had come to him about twenty minutes before. She\u0027d been to the clinic, had waited anxiously for word about her husband, Leon. But Leon Garracone, who labored in one of the machine shops in Cade\u0027s autoyard, had not been found.\n \"I know he\u0027s alive,\" she repeated, speaking to Rick. \"I know it. John Gomez came out alive, and he worked right beside my Leon. He said he crawled out and he could hear other people in there callin\u0027 for help. I know my Leon\u0027s still in there. Maybe he\u0027s pinned under somethin\u0027. Maybe his legs are broken. But he\u0027s alive. I know it!\" Rick glanced at Father Ortega, saw that the priest believed as he did: that the odds of finding Leon Garracone alive in the debris of the autoyard were very, very slim.\n But Domingo Ortega lived on Fourth Street, two doors down from the Garracones, and he had always counted Leon as a good friend. When Mrs. Garracone and Joey had come to him, begging him to help, he\u0027d had to say yes; he\u0027d been trying to find other volunteers, but no one wanted to go into the autoyard with that outer-space machine sitting in there and he didn\u0027t blame them. \"You don\u0027t have to go,\" he told Rick. \"But Leon was... Leon\u0027s my friend. We\u0027re going to go in and try to find him.\" \"Don\u0027t do it, Rick,\" Paloma begged. \"Please don\u0027t.\" \"Help us, man,\" Joey Garracone said. \"We\u0027re brothers, righti\" \"There\u0027s been enough death!\" Paloma tried shakily to stand, but Miranda restrained her. \"It\u0027s a miracle anybody got out of that place alive! Please don\u0027t ask my son to go in there!\" Rick looked at Miranda. She shook her head, adding her opinion to Paloma\u0027s. He was ripped between what he knew was the sensible thing and what he considered to be his duty as leader of the Rattlers. Gang law said that if one of the brothers needed help, you gave it without question. He took a deep breath of smoke-tainted air and released it. The whole town smelled like scorched metal and burning tires. \"Mrs. Garracone,\" he said, \"will you take my grandmother and sister to the church with youi I don\u0027t want them being alone.\" \"No!\" This time Paloma did stand up. \"No, for the love of God, no!\" \"I want you to go with Mrs. Garracone,\" he said calmly. \"I\u0027ll be all right.\" \"No! I\u0027m begging you!\" Her voice broke, and new tears ran down her wrinkled cheeks.\n He walked across the crooked floor to her and put his arm around her. \"Listen to me. If you believed I was still out there, and alive, you\u0027d want someone to go in after me, wouldn\u0027t youi\" \"There are others who can do it! Not you!\" \"I have to go. You know that, because you taught me not to turn my back on my friends.\" \"I taught you not to be a fool, either!\" she answered, but Rick could hear in her voice that she had grudgingly accepted his decision.\n He held her for a moment longer, and then he said to Miranda, \"Take care of her,\" and he let his grandmother go. Paloma seized his hand, squeezed it tightly, and the cataract-covered eyes found his face. \"You be careful. Promise it.\" \"I promise,\" he said, and she released him. He turned toward Father Ortega. \"all right. Let\u0027s get it done.\" Mrs. Garracone left with Paloma and Miranda, heading to the Catholic church on First Street. armed with a flashlight, Father Ortega led Rick, Zarra, and Joey Garracone in the opposite direction, along smoky Second Street toward the blown-down fence of the autoyard and the fires beyond.\n at the yard\u0027s edge, they stopped to survey a landscape of destruction: car parts had been thrown into tangled heaps of metal, piles of tires billowed dense black smoke, and what had been either wooden or brick buildings were either smashed flat or turned to rubble.\n and overshadowing all was the black pyramid, its base sunken into the earth.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do what you\u0027re thinking,\" someone warned. Sitting on the hood of his Mercedes was Mack Cade, smoking a thin cheroot and regarding the ruins like a fallen emperor. Typhoid crouched at his feet, and Lockjaw sat in the backseat. Cade still wore his Panama hat; his tanned face, wine-red shirt, and khaki trousers were streaked with soot. \"Nothing in there worth going after.\" \"My dad\u0027s in there!\" Joey answered adamantly. \"We\u0027re gonna bring him out!\" \"Sure you are.\" Cade spewed a thread of smoke. \"Kid, there\u0027s nothing left but bones and ashes.\" \"You shut your filthy mouth!\" Typhoid stood up and growled darkly, but Cade rested one booted foot on the dog\u0027s back. \"Just telling it like it is, kid. There are some drums of paint and lubricant that haven\u0027t blown up yet. That\u0027s what I\u0027m waiting on. You want to get yourselves killed, you go right ahead.\" \"You know where Leon Garracone was working,\" Ortega said. \"Why don\u0027t you do something worthwhile for once in your life and help us find himi\" \"Garracone, Garracone...\" He thought for a moment, trying to place a face with the name. They all looked alike to him. \"Oh, yeah! Garracone was always bitching for a raise. He worked in the engine shop. That\u0027s what\u0027s left of it.\" He pointed, and through the haze they could make out a heap of broken bricks about fifty yards in.\n \"John Gomez got out,\" Ortega said, undaunted. \"He\u0027s cut up and burned, but he\u0027s alive. Leon could still be - \" \"Sure. Dream on, padre. anyway, what the hell is Garracone to youi\" He removed the cheroot from his mouth and flicked it away. The gold chains around his neck made a tinkling noise as he moved.\n \"Leon is my friend. Which is something I don\u0027t suppose you understand.\" \"I\u0027ve got all the friends I need, thanks.\" Cade had a staff of five Mexican servants at his house, a live-in teenage mistress - a little coked-up go-go dancer from San antonio - and a fat-bellied cook named Lucinda, but his real friends were always with him. The two dogs never judged him, or pressured him, or gave him bad vibrations. They were always ready to rip the throats out of his enemies, and they obeyed without question: to him, that was true friendship. \"Jurado, you\u0027ve got more sense than this. Tell \u0027em how crazy they are, man.\" \"We\u0027ve got to see for ourselves.\" \"You\u0027ll see, all right! Man, didn\u0027t you get a look at that flying bastardi There\u0027s something alive in that fucker!\" He motioned toward the pyramid. \"You go out there and it\u0027ll chew your asses up too!\" \"Let\u0027s go,\" Ortega urged. \"This leech is useless.\" \"My mama didn\u0027t raise any fools!\" Cade retorted as the others started into the autoyard, watching their steps over the twisted sheet-metal fence and the wicked coils of concertina wire. \"I\u0027ll tell Noah Twilley where to find your bodies!\" But they paid him no more attention and moved into the yard past heaps of razor-sharp metal and smoking debris. Soon afterward, they heard the blare and crash of Cade\u0027s tape deck, cranked up loud enough to blast God\u0027s eardrums: alice Cooper, wailing about dead babies in a cupboard.\n The sandy ground was littered with parts of engines and cars, charred wooden planks, bricks, and other junk. Zarra lagged behind to poke around the warped chassis of what appeared to have been a Porsche, thrown upside down by the concussion. Father Ortega saw a man\u0027s bloodstained shirt lying nearby, but he didn\u0027t call attention to it. The dark smoke of smoldering tires hung close to the earth, unstirred by a breeze, and piles of wreckage glowed fierce red at their centers. The black pyramid loomed frighteningly close. Rick hesitated, looking up toward the column of light that whirled around and around with hypnotic effect at its apex, then got his legs moving again.\n But he couldn\u0027t shake the feeling of being watched. It was a sense he\u0027d developed by necessity, to guard against a \u0027Gade coming up behind him at school and taking him down with a kidney punch. The back of his neck prickled and he kept glancing around, but nothing moved through the smoke. It was more than being watched, he decided; it was a sensation of being taken apart, measured, dissected like a frog in biology class. \"Creepy in here,\" Zarra muttered, walking just to Rick\u0027s right, and Rick knew Zarra must be feeling it too.\n They crossed the yard to the jumble of bricks and metal beams that Cade had pointed out. Not far away was a mound of cars and pickup trucks that had been crunched together like a bizarre sculpture. Joey Garracone got down on his knees in the sand and started tossing broken bricks aside and calling for his father.\n \"You and Zarra start on the other side,\" Ortega suggested, and they went around the collapsed building - where they came face-to-face with a burned-up corpse lying next to a crumpled sky-blue Corvette. The corpse\u0027s head was smashed in, and broken teeth gleamed in the gaping mouth. Whoever he was, he had reddish-blond hair; a white man, not Joey\u0027s father. The heavy, sickly-sweet odor of burned meat reached them, and Zarra gasped. \"I\u0027m gonna volcano, man!\" He turned and ran away a few yards, bending his head toward the ground. Rick clamped his teeth together, walked past the dead man, and stood waiting for the dizzy sickness to pass. It did, mercifully, and then he was ready to work. Zarra came back, his face yellow.\n They began to search through the ruins of the engine shop, clearing away some of the mountain of bricks. after about ten minutes of work, Ortega uncovered another dead man: it was Carlos Hermosa - Ruben\u0027s father - and the way the man\u0027s body was contorted Ortega knew the spine and neck must be broken. Joey stared for a moment at the corpse, his face covered with dust and sweat, and then he silently continued his labor. Ortega made the sign of the cross and kept tossing bricks aside.\n The work was hard. It looked to Rick as if the whole building - which had been a flat-roofed structure about forty feet long - had caved in on itself. He moved a length of pipe, and broken bricks tumbled down along with a charred sneaker that he at first thought might have a foot in it but was empty, its owner either buried or blown out of his shoe by the concussion.\n He came to a metal beam that Zarra helped him shift with back-wrenching effort, and after the beam was laid aside Zarra looked at him and said quietly, \"Do you hear thati\" \"Hear whati\" \"Listen!\" Rick did, but all he could hear was Cade\u0027s tape deck playing.\n \"Hold it. I don\u0027t hear it anymore.\" Zarra walked into the wreckage, searching for the sound he\u0027d heard. He bent down, tossed more bricks and rubble away. Then: \"There! You hear that, mani Over this way!\" \"I didn\u0027t hear anything.\" Rick went to where Zarra was and waited. a few seconds passed - and then, muffled and indistinct, came the clink of metal against metal. It was a steady rhythm, coming from somewhere deep within the ruins, and Rick realized somebody was signaling. \"Hey! Father!\" he shouted. \"Over here!\" Ortega and Joey came running, their clothes and skin filmed with dust. Zarra picked up a piece of pipe and hit it against a brick a few times, and they all heard the answering knocks from below. Ortega got down on his knees, shining the flashlight in amid the bricks in search of an airspace. Zarra kept signaling, and the clinking noise came back to him.\n \"It\u0027s Domingo Ortega!\" the priest shouted. \"Can you hear mei\" They waited, but heard no response. \"Help me,\" Ortega said, and he and the boys began to work at a fever pitch, digging their way down through three or four feet of rubble. Within minutes their hands were scraped raw, and blood seeped from cuts in Rick\u0027s palms. Ortega said, \"Hold it,\" and leaned forward, listening. There was the sound of metal on metal again, someone hammering at a pipe. \"Can you hear me down therei\" Ortega hollered.\n a weak, raspy shout drifted up: \"Yeah! Oh Christ, yeah! Get us outta here!\" \"Who are youi How many are with youi\" \"Three of us! I\u0027m Greg Frackner! Will Barnett and Leon Garracone are down here too!\" \"Papa!\" Joey yelled, tears streaming down his cheeks. \"Papa, it\u0027s Joey!\" \"We\u0027re down in the work pit, and there\u0027s all kinds of shit wedged in on top of us,\" Frackner continued. \"I can see your light, though!\" \"are you hurti\" \"Broken arm, I reckon. Ribs don\u0027t feel too swift either. Will\u0027s coughin\u0027 up blood, and Leon\u0027s passed out again. I think his legs are busted. What the hell hit us, mani a bombi\" Ortega avoided the question. \"Can you move at alli\" \"a little bit, but it\u0027s mighty tight in here. We\u0027re breathin\u0027 okay, though.\" \"Good.\" It was clear to Ortega that they were going to need more muscle power to get the three men out. \"Just take it easy, now. We\u0027re going to have to go back for some picks and shovels.\" \"Whatever it takes, man! Listen... can you leave the light where I can see iti I keep thinkin\u0027 I hear somethin\u0027 diggin\u0027 down here. Like underneath us. I\u0027m scared of rats. Okayi\" \"Okay,\" Ortega said, and wedged the flashlight in between two bricks so its beam would shine down into the airspace. \"We\u0027ll be back!\" he promised, and he grasped Joey\u0027s shoulders and pulled the boy up too.\n They started back across the autoyard, under the violet glow and the motionless black clouds, and Rick had that crawly sensation of being watched again. He turned toward the pyramid.\n a man was standing about twenty feet away. He was lean, tall, and broad around the shoulders; he stood slightly hunchbacked, and his arms dangled limply at his sides. Rick was unable to tell much about the man\u0027s face, other than that it looked to be wet. The man wore dark pants and a striped short-sleeve shirt, the clothes covered with dirt. He was just standing there, his head cocked slightly to one side, watching them. \"Fatheri\" Rick said, and Ortega heard the raw nerves in Rick\u0027s voice and stopped; he looked back, and then all of them saw the hunchbacked man who stood like a statue.\n Ortega\u0027s first thought was that it was one of Cade\u0027s workmen who\u0027d just dug himself out of the ruins. He stepped forward. \"You all righti\" \"Who\u0027s the guardiani\" the man asked, in a thick, slow drawl that had an undercurrent like the whistle of steam from a teakettle.\n The priest\u0027s steps faltered. He couldn\u0027t see much of the man\u0027s face - just some slicked-down gray hair and a damp and gleaming slab of forehead - but he thought he recognized the voice. Only the voice usually said What can I fit you for, padrei It was Gil Lockridge, Ortega realized. Gil and his wife Mavis had owned the Boots \u0027n Plenty shoestore for over ten years. But Gil wasn\u0027t so tall, Ortega thought. and he wasn\u0027t so large around the shoulders, nor was he hunchbacked like this man was. But... it was Gil\u0027s voice. Wasn\u0027t iti\n \"I asked you a question,\" the man said. \"Who\u0027s the guardiani\" \"Guardiani\" Ortega shook his head. \"Guardian of whati\" The man drew in a long lungful of air and released it - a long release - with a noise that reminded Rick of the way that sidewinder had rattled when he\u0027d reached into the box for the Fang of Jesus. \"I don\u0027t like bein\u0027...\" There was a hesitation, as if he were searching for the correct phrase. \"Bein\u0027 trifled with. I don\u0027t like it a\u0027tall.\" He took two strides forward, and Ortega backed away. The man stopped, and now Ortega could see some kind of ooze sliding off the man\u0027s lantern-jawed face. Gil\u0027s eyes were black, sunken, terrible. \"I know the one I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for is here. I know there\u0027s a guardian. Maybe it\u0027s you.\" The eyes fixed on Zarra for a second. \"Or maybe it\u0027s you.\" a glance at Rick. \"Or is it youi\" The gaze returned to Father Ortega.\n \"Listen... Gil... how\u0027d you get out herei I mean... I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re - \" \"The one I\u0027m seekin\u0027 is a subversive criminal,\" the man went on. \"an enemy of the collective mind. I don\u0027t know how you deal with criminals on this\" - he looked around with a sinuous movement of the neck and said contemptuously - \"world, but I\u0027m sure you understand the concepts of law and order. I intend to bring the creature to justice.\" \"What creaturei\" It hit him then: what Colonel Rhodes had said about Stevie Hammond. \"The little girli\" he asked before he could think about what he was saying.\n \"The little girl,\" the voice repeated. The eyes had taken on a keen glint. \"explain.\" Ortega stood very still, but his insides had twisted into knots. He damned his tongue; there was an awful hunger on the wet and waxy face of the man-thing that stood before him. It was not Gil Lockridge; it was a mocking imitation of humanity.\n \"explain,\" the thing commanded, and took a gliding step forward.\n \"Run!\" Ortega shouted to the boys; they were frozen with shock, couldn\u0027t move. \"Get away!\" he yelled, and as he backed up he saw a length of pipe lying on the ground beside his left foot. He picked it up and held it threateningly over his head. The thing was almost upon him, and he had no choice; he hurled the broken pipe at the Gil Lockridge face with the strength of panic.\n The pipe smashed into the moist features with a noise like a hammer whacking a watermelon. The right cheek split open from eye to corner of mouth, and gray fluid dripped out. The face showed no reaction, no pain. But there was a slight smile on the crooked mouth now, and needlelike teeth glinted inside the cavity. The rattling voice said with a hint of pleasure, \"I see you speak my language.\" There was a ripping sound: the tearing of brittle cloth. Little crackling noises like a hundred bones breaking and rearranging themselves within seconds. Joey Garracone screamed and ran, but Rick and Zarra stood their ground, transfixed with terror. The man\u0027s hunched back was swelling, bowing his spine downward; his eyes were riveted to Ortega, who moaned and retreated on trembling legs.\n The thing\u0027s shirt split open, and a bulbous lump rose at the end of the spine. It tore through the pale counterfeit skin and revealed black, interlocking scales similar to those on the pyramid. From its lower end uncoiled a dripping, segmented tail about five feet long and triple the thickness of Zarra\u0027s bullwhip; the tail rose into the air with a clicking, bony sound, and at its tip was a football-sized nodule of metallic spikes.\n \"No,\" Rick heard himself croak - and the grinning, split-open face ticked toward him.\n Father Ortega turned to run; he got two strides away before the monster leapt after him. The spiked tail whipped forward in a deadly blur, caught the side of the priest\u0027s head, and demolished it in an explosion of bone and brains. Ortega fell to his knees, his face a crimson hole, and slowly, with exquisite grace, toppled into the sand.\n The monster whirled around, crouched and ready, the tail flicking back and forth with fragments of Ortega\u0027s head clinging to the spikes.\n Zarra let out a choked shriek, backed away, and stumbled over a pile of rubble. He went down hard on his tailbone, sat there gaping as the creature took a step toward him.\n Rick saw automotive parts scattered all around him; there was no time to judge if he should run or not, because in another few seconds that spiked tail would be within range of Zarra. Rick picked up a twisted hubcap and flung it, and as it sailed at the monster\u0027s head the tail flicked out almost lazily and knocked the piece of metal aside.\n Now Rick had the creature\u0027s undivided attention, and as it stalked toward him Rick hefted a car\u0027s door from the sand and held it before himself like a shield. \"Run!\" he shouted to Zarra, who started crawling frantically on his hands and knees. \"Go!\" The tail swept at Rick. He tried to dance out of its way, but the thing hit his makeshift shield and threw off a shower of sparks; the impact lifted him off his feet and hurled him onto his back on the ground. His hands still gripped the dented-in car door, which lay on top of him, and as he struggled up, his head ringing, the monster advanced in a crouch and the tail swung again.\n This time the car\u0027s door was ripped away from him and flung through the air. Rick twisted, scurrying toward the unpainted frame of a Jaguar sedan that sat near a pile of rusted metal six feet away. as he flung himself into the doorless and windowless car, he heard the bony rattling of the monster\u0027s tail right behind him; he pulled his legs in just as the ball of spikes whammed against the Jaguar\u0027s side, making the frame shudder and moan like a funeral bell. He scrambled through the opposite door hole, got his feet under him, and ran.\n He didn\u0027t know where Zarra was, or if he was heading out of the autoyard or deeper into it. The hanging layers of dark smoke accepted him, and fitful fires glowed red through the gloom. On all sides stood heaps of car parts, chassis, rows of BMWs, Mercedes, Corvettes, and other high-ticket vehicles awaiting transformation. The place was a maze of metal walls, and Rick didn\u0027t know which way to run; he looked over his shoulder; he couldn\u0027t see the thing behind him, but that didn\u0027t mean it wasn\u0027t there. He ran on, his lungs straining for air through the smoke, and in another moment found his way blocked by a steep ridge of scrap metal. He turned back, ran past a collapsed building where a dead man in a blue shirt lay sprawled amid the bricks.\n Rick stopped below a pile of flattened car bodies, his lungs heaving, to try to get his bearings. He\u0027d never been in here before, the smoke seared his eyes, and he couldn\u0027t even think straight. What had happened to Father Ortega seemed unreal, a pull from a bad dose of weed. He was shaking now, his body out of control. He was going to have to start running again, but he feared what might be waiting for him out there in the smoke. He slid his hand into his pocket to grasp the Fang of Jesus.\n But before he could get his fingers on the switchblade, something dark dropped down like a noose and tightened around his throat.\n He knew what it was, because he heard the bony clicking of the tail\u0027s segmented joints. The monster was above him, sitting on one of the flattened cars. Rick\u0027s heart stuttered, and he felt his face freeze as the blood left it. Then he was being lifted off his feet, the pressure just short of strangling him, and he thrashed until a hand gripped his hair.\n \"The little girl,\" the awful, hissing voice said. The thing\u0027s mouth was right beside Rick\u0027s ear. \"explain.\" \"I don\u0027t... I don\u0027t... know. I swear...\" His feet were about six inches off the ground. He didn\u0027t know anything about a guardian, or a little girl, and he felt the gears of his brain start to smoke and slip.\n The tail tightened. Rick squeezed his eyes shut.\n Maybe five seconds passed; to Rick it was an eternity he would never forget. and then the voice said, \"I have a message for the one called ed Vance. I want to meet with him. He knows where. Tell him.\" The tail went slack - click click click - and Rick fell to his knees as it released him.\n at first he could only lie huddled up, waiting for the spikes to smash his head in, unable to move or think or cry for help. But gradually he realized that the thing was going to let him live. He crawled away from it, still expecting a blow at any second, and finally he forced himself to stand. He could sense the thing watching him from its perch, and he dared not turn around to look at it; the slick, bony feel of the tail remained impressed in the flesh of his throat, and he wanted to scrub that skin until it bled.\n Rick almost broke into a run, but he feared that his legs were too weak and he\u0027d fall on his face. He started walking, retracing the way he thought he\u0027d come; the smoke parted before him and closed at his back. He was dimly aware that his legs were moving on automatic, and in his mind the images of the monster killing Father Ortega and pursuing him through the autoyard darted like a cageful of shadows.\n He came out of the autoyard about forty yards north of where they\u0027d gone in, and how long that journey had taken he had no idea. He kept walking south along the collapsed fence, and finally he saw Cade\u0027s Mercedes sitting in front of him.\n Instantly Lockjaw began barking furiously, rearing up in the backseat. Zarra was sitting on the pavement, shivering, his knees drawn up to his chin and both arms clutching the bullwhip to his chest. He looked up, saw Rick, and scrambled to his feet with a grunt of surprise.\n Mack Cade stood at the edge of the autoyard, the .38 in a white-knuckled grip in his right hand. He whirled around, aiming the pistol at the figure that had just lurched out of the smoke. about fifteen minutes ago, Joey Garracone had raced past him, trailing a scream that had even overpowered Cade\u0027s tape deck. Soon afterward, Zarra had come out babbling about something with a tail that had killed Domingo Ortega. \"Hold it!\" Cade shrieked, his blue eyes wide. \"Stop right there!\" Rick did. He wavered, almost fell. \"It\u0027s me,\" he said.\n \"Where\u0027s Ortegai\" Cade\u0027s false cool had cracked like cheap plastic, and underneath it was a little boy\u0027s terror. \"What happened to the priest, mani\" He kept his finger on the trigger.\n \"Dead. Out there somewhere.\" Rick motioned with a leaden arm.\n \"I told you not to go in there!\" Cade shouted. \"Didn\u0027t Ii I told you not to, you stupid shits!\" He peered into the haze, searching for Typhoid; the dog had raced out there a few minutes ago, barking and growling at something, and hadn\u0027t returned. \"Typhoid!\" he hollered. \"Come on back, boy!\" \"We\u0027ve got to tell Vance,\" Rick said. \"It wants to see him.\" \"Typhoid!\" Cade took three steps into the autoyard, but could make himself go no farther. The concertina wire snagged his trousers, and oily beads of sweat rolled down his face. \"Typhoid, come on!\" Lockjaw kept barking. Cade prowled along the wire, calling for Typhoid in a voice that began to strain and quaver.\n \"I said we\u0027ve got to tell Vance!\" Rick repeated. \"Right now!\" \"I\u0027ve gotta find my dog!\" Cade shouted, his face stricken. \"Something\u0027s happened to Typhoid!\" \"Forget the dog! Father Ortega\u0027s dead! We\u0027ve got to tell the sheriff!\" \"I told you not to go in there! I said you were all crazy as hell!\" Cade felt a weakness falling over him, like a sun in eclipse. The yard and its fortune of cars were reduced to true junk, and in that smoke Cade could smell the burning of syndicate money and his own skin. \"Typhoid!\" he yelled, his voice rasping. \"Come back!\" His voice echoed over the ruins. There was no sign of the Doberman.\n \"You going to take us to Vance or noti\" Rick asked him.\n \"I can\u0027t... leave my friend,\" Cade said, as something that had been nailed in place for a long time broke inside him. \"Typhoid\u0027s out there. I can\u0027t leave him.\" He stared at the boy for a few seconds, to make sure he understood, and then Cade said thickly, \"You can take the car. I don\u0027t give a shit.\" He started walking into the yard, and Lockjaw saw his master going and leapt out of the Mercedes to follow.\n \"No!\" Rick shouted. \"Don\u0027t!\" Cade went on. He looked back, a terrible smile on his sweat-damp face. \"You gotta know who your friends are, kid. Gotta stick up for them. Think on these things.\" He gave a short, sharp whistle to Lockjaw, and the Doberman walked at his side. Cade began to call for Typhoid again, his voice getting weaker, and the two figures vanished into the haze.\n \"Get in the car,\" Rick told Zarra, and the other boy stumbled dazedly toward it. Rick slid behind the wheel, turned the keys in the ignition, and laid rubber in reverse. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-33.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: \n In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
