Cars and pickup trucks had careened into the parking lot, people rushing to the safety of the apartment building, and Gunniston had gone to find out what was happening. Jessie, Tom, and Rhodes remained with Daufin, watching as the alien paced back and forth at the window like a desperate animal in a narrowing cage. \"I want my daughter back,\" Jessie said. \"Where is shei\" \"Safe. In my pod.\" Jessie stepped forward and dared to grasp Daufin\u0027s shoulder. The alien stopped her pacing and looked up at the woman\u0027s face. \"I asked you where she is. You\u0027re going to tell me.\" Daufin glanced at the others. They were waiting for her to speak, and Daufin knew it was time for that too. \"My pod is in your house. I put it through the upper hatch.\" \"Upper hatchi\" Tom asked. \"We don\u0027t even have an upstairs!\" \"Incorrect. I put my pod through the upper hatch of your house.\" \"We looked through every inch of that place!\" Rhodes told her. \"The sphere\u0027s not there!\" But Jessie searched the child\u0027s face, and she remembered the flecks of pink insulation in the auburn hair. \"We looked everywhere we thought you could reach. But we didn\u0027t check the attic, did wei\" \"The attici That\u0027s crazy!\" Rhodes said. \"She couldn\u0027t even walk when we found her! How could she have gotten into the attici\" Jessie knew. \"You\u0027d already learned how to walk by the time we\u0027d gotten there, hadn\u0027t youi\" \"Yes. I did the teeah-veeah thing.\" She saw they didn\u0027t comprehend. \"I playacted,\" she explained, \"because I didn\u0027t want you to look through the upper hatch.\" \"You couldn\u0027t have reached the trapdoor by yourself,\" Jessie said. \"What did you stand oni\" \"a bodily-support instrument.\" She realized that hadn\u0027t translated as she\u0027d intended. \"a chair. I made sure it was back in place, exactly where it had been.\" Jessie recalled the little girl pulling the chair to the window and standing up on it to press her hands against the glass. It had never occurred to her that Daufin could have used a chair once before, to reach the trapdoor\u0027s cord. She looked out at the fires and saw they were on Celeste Street, very close to their own house. \"How do you know Stevie\u0027s safei\" \"My pod is... how do you say... in-de-struc-ti-ble. Nothing can break it open, not even Stinger\u0027s technology.\" Daufin had felt the chill sweep of the seeker beam two minutes before, and she calculated that it made a complete rotation once every four hundred and eighty earth seconds. \"What is the time, pleasei\" she asked Tom. \"eighteen minutes after three.\" She nodded. The seeker beam should return in approximately three hundred and sixty seconds. She began a mental countdown, using the rigid earth mathematics. \"Stinger\u0027s searching for my pod with a beam of energy from his ship,\" she said. \"The beam\u0027s been activated since Stinger landed. It\u0027s powered by a machine that\u0027s calculated the measurements and density of my pod, but the pod has a protective mechanism that deflects the beam.\" \"So Stinger won\u0027t be able to find iti\" Jessie asked. \"Stinger hasn\u0027t found it yet. The beam\u0027s still activated.\" She watched the dance of the fires, and she knew she had to tell them the rest of it. \"The beam\u0027s very strong. The longer I\u0027m out of the pod, the weaker the defense mechanism becomes.\" She met Jessie\u0027s gaze. \"I never thought I\u0027d be out of it this long.\" \"You mean Stinger\u0027s got a good chance of finding out it\u0027s in our attic,\" Tom said. \"I can calculate the odds, if you like.\" \"No.\" Jessie didn\u0027t care to hear them because they\u0027d be in Stinger\u0027s favor, like everything else seemed to be. Rhodes walked to the window to get a breath of air. The last few cars were barreling into the parking lot. He wasn\u0027t sure he wanted to know what those people were running from. He turned toward Daufin. \"You said you could get away in Stinger\u0027s ship. How is that possiblei\" \"I\u0027ve escaped from Rock Seven twice before. I was hunted and taken back by Stinger both times. I know the ship\u0027s systems, and the machines that operate the controls. and I know how to use the star corridor to get home.\" \"If you got inside, you could find a way to shut off the force fieldi\" \"Yes. The force field comes from the auxiliary power supply. That power is rerouted to start the...\" There were no earth words to describe the pyramid\u0027s flight system. \"The main engines,\" was the best she could do. \"So the force field has to be shut down before the engines can starti How long does that takei\" \"a variable amount of time, depending on how much power\u0027s been drained. I\u0027d calculate roughly fifteen to twenty of your minutes.\" He grunted, trying to clear his mind enough to think. \"Sun\u0027ll be coming up in about an hour and a half. There\u0027re probably several hundred state troopers, air-force people, and reporters around the force field\u0027s perimeter by now.\" a faint smile touched his mouth. \"I\u0027ll bet old Buckner\u0027s in charge. Bet that bastard\u0027s going crazy trying to keep the news hounds from taking pictures. What the hell: this\u0027ll be all over the newspapers and TV within twelve hours and there\u0027s not a damned thing anybody can do about it.\" The smile faded. \"If the force field was down, we\u0027d have a chance to get out of here with our skins still on.\" He lifted his arm and looked at the bruise in the shape of a hand imprinted around it. \"Most of us, I mean. I want you to think hard: is there any way to get into that shipi\" \"Yes,\" she answered promptly. \"Through Stinger\u0027s tunnels.\" \"I mean another way.\" The mention of those tunnels had sent a dagger of fear into Rhodes\u0027s heart. \"How about the portal the flying thing came out ofi are there other passages into the shipi\" \"No. Only the tunnels.\" The breath hissed from between his teeth like air from a pierced tire, and his hope deflated with it. There was no way on God\u0027s green earth he could go back into those tunnels. Gunniston returned from the corridor, and with him was Zarra alhambra. \"Tell them what you told me,\" he urged. \"Somethin\u0027 came up out of the street over in Bordertown,\" Zarra said to the colonel. \"all of us were in the church. Cody Lockett and Rick saw it, and we cleared everybody out of the church and herded \u0027em over here. That\u0027s all I know, man.\" \"Where\u0027re Cody and Rick nowi\" Tom asked. \"I don\u0027t know. everythin\u0027 was happenin\u0027 so fast. I guess they\u0027re on the way here.\" Daufin felt the seeker beam rotate past, its chill prickling her skin. Her calculation had been off by four seconds. The door opened again. It was Bobby Clay Clemmons, who\u0027d been up on the roof keeping watch with Mike Frackner and a couple of other \u0027Gades. He glanced quickly at the Rattlers; any other time he would have attacked them in a blind rage for intruding on \u0027Gade territory, but all that was forgotten. \"Hey, Colonel!\" he said. \"Somethin\u0027s movin\u0027 around down there!\" He strode to the window, and Rhodes went with him. Two of the cars down in the maze of vehicles still had their headlights on. at first Rhodes couldn\u0027t see much through the smoke and dust - and then he caught sight of a shape moving quickly over on the right, and another one on the left. a third shape, running low to the ground, skittered under a car and stayed there. and now more of them were coming along Travis Street. He heard the scuttle and scrape of claws as the things climbed up over the cars. He shuddered; he was reminded of walking into the kitchen of the farmhouse he\u0027d grown up in, switching on the lights, and seeing a dozen roaches scurry off a platter of birthday cake. Dark, scaly backs darted through the headlight beams. a spiked tail swung, and one of the lights smashed out. another tail rose up, quivered with tension, and broke out first one headlight and then a second. The fourth and last headlight was smashed. Down in the murk, the things began to swarm toward the apartment building, their tails beating haphazardly at the sides of the cars, but they stopped at the edge of the parking lot. \"Stinger\u0027s afraid of the electric light.\" Daufin was standing beside Rhodes, peering over the windowsill. \"It hurts him.\" \"Maybe it hurts Stinger, but maybe it doesn\u0027t hurt all those things.\" \"all are Stinger,\" she said. Her eyes followed the twitching of the spiked tails. Their hammering was becoming a regular rhythm now, like a brutal taunt. \"He won\u0027t get in here while these lights are on.\" Tom had already picked up his rifle from the table. Beside it was the tear-gas shotgun that Rhodes had brought in, and Gunniston still had his .45 automatic. Rhodes looked at Bobby Clay Clemmons. \"Have you got any weapons herei\" \"arsenal\u0027s this way.\" Bobby Clay led him into the next room and switched on the battery lamp mounted to the wall. Its light revealed racks where a variety of objects hung: sawed-off baseball bats, a couple of pellet rifles, and two pairs of brass knuckles. \"This all you\u0027ve goti\" \"That\u0027s about it.\" The boy shrugged. \"We never... like... wanted to kill anybody, man. Few other things in here.\" He walked to a green footlocker and opened it. Inside were tools - a hammer, two or three screwdrivers, assorted jars of nails, and other junk. There were only two items that Rhodes thought might be of use: a battery-powered bull\u0027s-eye lantern and a flashlight. He pulled them out and turned them on to check the batteries. The lantern was strong enough, but the flashlight was almost dead. He took the lantern back to the other room, just in case - God forbid - something should happen to the wall lights. The crashing of spikes against metal was steady and insistent. The noise got to Tom; he crossed the room, slid the rifle\u0027s barrel through the window, and fired at one of the dark shapes. The slug, if it hit, did not stop the rhythmic pounding. \"Save your bullets!\" Rhodes told him. \"Stinger\u0027s trying to psych us out.\" He heard more gunshots, from other windows. Bullets scratched sparks off the concrete, but the noises went on. It sounded like the tramping of an army over broken glass. Tom was about to pull the rifle barrel back in when he saw something else out there. It was a large shape, coming steadily across the parking lot toward them, but he couldn\u0027t make out anything else. \"Rhodes!\" he said. \"Look at - \" There was the sound of metal crumpling. and in the next second what might have been a car door crashed against the side of the building. Glass shattered in a window three or four away from the one where Tom stood. a fusillade of gunfire erupted. Rhodes came to the window, could only see the vague outline of something huge out there - and then the mashed bulk of a red Mustang hit the wall about ten feet away and slid down with a shriek of metal. Whatever it was, the bastard was strong enough to hurl a car twenty or thirty feet. \"Get down, everybody!\" he said, ducking below the window. The others got down too, and before she could think about what she was doing, Jessie grasped her little girl\u0027s body and pulled her close. \"Gunny!\" Rhodes said. \"Go down the hall and keep everybody away from the windows!\" The other man hurried out. Rhodes peered up over the sill. The shape was moving closer, but not yet in the wash of the building\u0027s lights. another piece of metal - a hood, he thought it might be - sailed out and bounced off one of the first-floor windows, but the crash and echo sounded like the place was coming to pieces. a tire followed within seconds, shattering the window two apartments to the left. Someone cried out in pain as flying glass hit them, and Daufin broke free from Jessie\u0027s grip. She rushed to the window before anyone could stop her, and she grabbed the rifle out of Tom\u0027s hands and struggled to balance it on the sill. even as Rhodes was reaching for her, she lodged two fingers on the trigger and squeezed. The recoil threw her backward, skidding her across the floor, but instantly she was up again and trying to drag the rifle with her. Her eyes were wild, wet with rage and frustration. Tom clutched the rifle before Daufin could get it up on the sill, and as he pulled her away from the window the wall exploded inward over their heads. Rhodes saw the thing\u0027s tail burst through in a shower of rubble and dust. Stones clattered down around Jessie, Zarra, and Bobby Clay, and Tom protected Daufin with his body. The tail darted out again, leaving a hole as big around as a washtub. Rhodes looked out the window, got a nerve-shredding glimpse of the creature\u0027s head as it scuttled back from the light\u0027s edge. as it retreated, it slashed out with its tail again and the spikes shrieked past the wall. Daufin squirmed away from Tom, her skin radiating little shocks like an electric eel, and leapt up onto the windowsill. Rhodes thought she was going to jump through, and he dared to grab her arms. a shock coursed through him, rattling his teeth, but he hung on. \"No!\" he shouted, trying to hold her back as she thrashed like an animal. Her attention was only on one thing: getting out of this box and leading Stinger away from the humans trapped here. But suddenly she saw the huge shape coming through the smoke; the white light washed onto its head, glinting off the needle teeth in its thick, elongated jaws. Two of the eyes ticked toward her, while two aimed at another window, and for a second she thought she could see her face reflected on the thin black pupils. Whether those eyes knew her or not, she didn\u0027t know: they were as cold and impassive as the icy vaults of deep space. Stinger kept scurrying forward, the tail rising up behind it like a deadly question mark. The full glare of the electric light fell onto its head. There was a sizzling sound that made Rhodes think of bacon on a grill; he saw the creature\u0027s eyes blistering and oozing where the light touched them. The tail whipped forward, and Rhodes yanked Daufin out of the window and to the floor. The spikes crashed into the wall of the apartment next door. There was a cacophony of screams, and the entire second level shook. Brick dust filled the room. Rhodes sat up, peered out, but the thing had retreated from the light. In the parking lot the tails of the other Stingers kept up their steady, martial drumbeat. Daufin was lying on her side, breathing heavily, knowing that Stinger was trying to smash out the lights. Then something hit her like a physical blow: the seeker beam had been due to pass twelve seconds ago. Her mental countdown was still progressing. Where was the seeker beami If it had been turned off... She didn\u0027t want to think about what that might mean. \"Hang on,\" Rhodes said tersely. \"It\u0027s coming back.\" He reached for Tom\u0027s rifle. In the close darkness of the Hammonds\u0027 attic, Scooter began growling. Sarge lit another match and held it to the ebony sphere in his hand. Couldn\u0027t see anything in it, but when he shook it he thought he could hear the quiet slosh of liquid. Thing was as cool as if it had just come out of a refrigerator. He pressed it against his cheeks and forehead like a piece of ice. Scooter got up off the sleeping bag and gave a nervous yip, and Sarge said, \"Don\u0027t you fret, now. Ol\u0027 Sarge\u0027ll take care of - \" The house trembled, and from downstairs came the scream of splitting wood. \" - you,\" he finished thickly. There was a crash of furniture either falling or being thrown over, then silence. Scooter whined and pressed against Sarge\u0027s side, and Sarge put his arm around his best friend. The match went out, but he didn\u0027t try to light another because the scrape on the box would be too loud. The silence stretched. Then came the sound of footsteps, entering the hallway. They stopped just below the attic\u0027s hatch. The hatch was jerked open, and the steps unfolded. Sarge crawled away from it, his hand clenching the black sphere. \"Come down,\" a man\u0027s voice said. \"Bring the pod with you.\" Sarge didn\u0027t move. Scooter growled softly. \"If you have a light, I want you to throw it down to me.\" an impatient pause. \"You don\u0027t want to get me super pissed, do youi\" The voice had a Texan accent, but there was something wrong with it. around the words was a rattling, as if whoever was speaking had a nest of snakes in his throat. and now there was another noise too: a low moan that sounded like a dog in agony. Sarge tossed the box of matches down the hatch. a hand caught and crumpled it. \"Now you and the pod.\" He didn\u0027t know what the man meant about a \"pod,\" but he whispered shakily to Scooter, \"We\u0027re gonna have to go down there. ain\u0027t no way around it.\" He slid toward the hatch, and Scooter followed. a man-sized shape stood in the hallway. as Sarge reached the bottom of the steps, a hand grabbed the sphere away from him so fast it was only seconds later that Sarge felt pain and the welling of blood from his fingers. Fella\u0027s got sharp nails, he thought. Scratched the fool out of me. He could see the man lift the sphere up before his face. There was something writhing at the man\u0027s chest, where nothing ought to be but skin and shirt. The man whispered, \"I\u0027ve got you.\" and the way he said that made the flesh crawl at the back of Sarge\u0027s neck. The hand placed the sphere down in that writhing mass on his chest. Sarge heard the click of fangs as the sphere was accepted. and then the man\u0027s arm - as damp and slimy as a centipede\u0027s belly - hooked around Sarge and lifted him off the floor, squeezing the breath out of him. Sarge was too stunned to fight back, and before he knew what was happening the man was striding toward a gaping hole in the den\u0027s floor. Sarge tried to call for Scooter, couldn\u0027t summon up his voice, and then the man had walked into the hole and they were falling. Sarge wet his pants. The man\u0027s legs hit bottom like shock absorbers, but the impact traveled through Sarge\u0027s body and made his head feel like a sack of shattered glass. Sarge gave a muffled groan. The man began running through the winding dark, boots making a shuckshuckshuck noise in the ooze, and carried Sarge away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-52.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
