{"id":83403,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"Vance parked the patrol car in front of the Brandin\u0027 Iron, peeled his sweat-sopped shirt off the seat back, and walked in. The plate-glass window had been shattered, but a sheet had been nailed up over it to keep most of the smoke out. a few kerosene lamps cast a fitful glow, and the place was empty except for a back booth where three old-timers sat talking quietly. Vance avoided their stares and bellied up to the counter. Sue Mullinax, still wearing her gold-colored waitress uniform and her heavy makeup still more or less where it ought to be, came down the counter with a cup about a quarter full of cold coffee. \"This is the last of the Java,\" she said as she gave it to him, and he nodded and swigged it down.\\n\\n He angled his wrist toward a nearby lamp and checked the time. Twenty-three minutes after two. The Hammonds were late, and so were Rhodes and Gunniston. Didn\u0027t matter much, he thought. Nobody was going to find that little critter, at least not in the time they had left. You couldn\u0027t see a thing for all that smoke out there. He and Danny had checked houses all along aurora, Bowden, and about a third of Oakley Street. Nobody had seen the little girl, and several of the houses had no floors, just holes into darkness. Danny had started going to pieces again, and Vance had to take him back to the office. Inferno had always seemed like such a small place, but now the streets had elongated and the houses had become shadow mansions, and with all this smoke and dust there was just no damned way to find somebody who didn\u0027t want to be found.\\n\\n \"Rough night,\" Sue said.\\n\\n \"Better believe it. Cecil gone homei\" \"Yeah, he lit out awhile back.\" \"Why don\u0027t you shut down and head out tooi Not much use stayin\u0027 open, is therei\" \"I like to have somethin\u0027 to do,\" she said. \"Better stay here than go to a dark house.\" \"Reckon so.\" The low light was flattering to her. He thought that if she didn\u0027t wear enough makeup to pave a road, she\u0027d be real pretty. \u0027Course, Whale Tail was as chunky as a fire plug, but who was he to consider size with all the spare tires he was trucking aroundi Maybe she did wear a mattress on her back, but maybe there was a reason for that too. \"How come you never left Infernoi\" he decided to ask, to keep his mind off the inexorable tick of time. \"Seems like you were real smart in high school and all.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" She shrugged her fleshy shoulders. \"Nothin\u0027 ever came along, I reckon.\" \"Hell, you can\u0027t wait for things to come along! You gotta go after \u0027em! Seems like you could\u0027ve found yourself a good job somewhere, got yourself hitched up, maybe have a houseful of kids by now.\" He upturned the cup and caught the last bitter drop of coffee.\\n\\n \"Just never happened. anyways\" - she smiled faintly, a sad smile - \"the men I\u0027ve been seein\u0027 don\u0027t exactly want to get married and have kids. Well, I probably wouldn\u0027t have been too good at that, either.\" \"You\u0027re still just a kid yourself! What are you, twenty-eight, twenty-ninei\" He saw her grimace. \"That\u0027s not old! Hell, you\u0027ve still got\" - his voice faltered, but he kept going - \"plenty of time yet.\" She didn\u0027t answer. Vance looked at his watch again. another minute had gone. \"Danny\u0027s sweet on you,\" he told her. \"You know that, don\u0027t youi\" \"I like Danny. Oh, I don\u0027t mean for marryin\u0027. Not even for... y\u0027know.\" a blush rose in her round cheeks.\\n\\n \"I thought you and Danny were... uh... real close.\" \"We are. Friends, I mean. Danny\u0027s a gentleman,\" she said with dignity. \"He comes over to my place, and we talk. That\u0027s all. It\u0027s rare to find a man to talk to. Seems like men and women have a hard time just talkin\u0027, don\u0027t iti\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" He felt a pang of shame for making fun of her, and it occurred to him that maybe Danny was more of a man than he\u0027d thought.\\n\\n She nodded. Her head turned toward the doorway. Vance saw her eyes; they seemed to be fixed on a great distance. \"Maybe I could\u0027ve gone,\" she said. \"I was the best in my typin\u0027 class. Reckon I could\u0027ve been a secretary. But I didn\u0027t want to leave. I mean... Inferno ain\u0027t the best place in the world, but it\u0027s my home. That makes it special, no matter how much it\u0027s broke down. I\u0027ve got real good memories of Inferno... like when I was head cheerleader at the high school, and one night we were playin\u0027 the Cedartown Cavaliers.\" Her eyes shone with the blaze of ten years past. \"It was rainin\u0027 that night, just pourin\u0027 down, but me and my girls were out there. and right when Gary Pardee threw that forty-yard touchdown the girls lifted me up and I did a monkey flip and everybody on that field let out a holler like I hadn\u0027t never heard before. ain\u0027t heard one like it since, either. Folks came up to me later and said it was amazin\u0027, how I could do a monkey flip in all that rain without breakin\u0027 my neck, and they said I came down light as an angel\u0027s feather.\" She blinked; just like that, the spell broke. \"Well,\" she said, \"I\u0027m somebody here, and out there...\" She motioned toward the rest of the world. \"I wouldn\u0027t be nobody.\" Her eyes found his, and looked deep. \"This is my home. Yours too. We\u0027ve gotta fight to keep it.\" The taste of ashes was in Vance\u0027s mouth. \"We will,\" he said, but the words had a hollow ring.\\n\\n Headlights shone through the sheeted window. a car pulled up beside Vance\u0027s. The headlights were cut, and then a solitary figure approached the door. Not Rhodes or Gunniston, Vance knew. They\u0027d gone off on foot. Celeste Preston sauntered in as if she owned every crack in the tiles, sat down at the far end of the counter, and said, \"Gimme a beer and an egg.\" \"Yes ma\u0027am.\" Sue got a lukewarm Lone Star out of the cooler and went to the refrigerator for the egg.\\n\\n Celeste\u0027s gaze wandered down the counter. She nodded at Vance. \"Kinda past your bedtime, ain\u0027t iti\" \"Kinda.\" He was too tired to trade punches with her. \"I wouldn\u0027t sleep very good, anyways.\" \"Me neither.\" She took the egg Sue gave her, broke its shell against the counter\u0027s edge, and swallowed the yolk whole, then chased it down with a chug-a-lug of beer. \"I gave blood a couple of hours ago,\" she explained, and wiped a yellow strand off her mouth with the back of her hand. \"Wint used to say a raw egg and beer was the quickest way to get your vitamins.\" \"Quickest way to puke too,\" Vance said.\\n\\n She swigged down more beer, and Sue went to check on the old-timers at the back. \"How come you\u0027re not out protectin\u0027 the town, Vancei Maybe drag that sonofabitch outta his spaceship and sit on him till he calls unclei\" Vance took his pack of Camels from his breast pocket and lit a cigarette, mulling her questions over. He snorted smoke, looked at her, and said, \"and why don\u0027t you crawl up your ass and pull the hole in after youi\" She just stared at him, her eyes like bits of cold flint and the beer bottle short of her lips. \"You\u0027re an almighty high bitch to be sittin\u0027 in here tellin\u0027 me what I oughta do. You don\u0027t think I give a shit about this town, do youi Well, maybe I screwed up some - screwed up a lot - but I\u0027ve always done what I thought was best. even when I was takin\u0027 money from Cade. Shit, what else was gonna keep Inferno alive but that little bastard\u0027s businessi\" He felt blood ballooning his. face, and his heart was pounding. \"My wife hated every inch of this town and ran off with a truck driver, but I stayed. I\u0027ve got two sons that went with her, and they only know enough about me to cuss me over the telephone, but I stayed. every day I eat dust and get cursed in two languages, but I stayed. I\u0027ve paid my dues, lady!\" He jabbed the cigarette at her. \"So don\u0027t you sit there in your joggin\u0027 suit and your diamond rings on your fingers and say I don\u0027t care about this town!\" and then he said something he\u0027d always known, but never dared to admit: \"It\u0027s all I\u0027ve got!\" Celeste stayed motionless for a moment. She sipped from the Lone Star and set the bottle softly down on the counter. Lifted her fingers to display the rings. \"They\u0027re fake,\" she said. \"Sold the real ones.\" a brittle smile played across her mouth. \"I reckon I deserved that, ed. Spit \u0027n gristle\u0027s what we\u0027ve been needin\u0027 around this cemetery. How about sharin\u0027 your smokesi\" She picked up her beer and slid over the seats, sitting down with two between them.\\n\\n ed, he thought. That was the first time she\u0027d ever used his first name. He skidded his pack of Camels and his lighter toward her, and she scooped them up. She lit a cigarette and inhaled with pure pleasure. \"Figure if I\u0027m gonna die, I might as well go happy,\" she said.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not gonna die. We\u0027ll get out of this.\" \"ed, I like you better when you tell the truth.\" She spun the pack and lighter back to him. \"Our hides are worth about as much as Kotex in a men\u0027s prison, and you know it.\" They heard the growl of an engine outside. Cody Lockett came in through the smoke and lifted his goggles. \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for Colonel Rhodes,\" he said to the sheriff. \"He\u0027s supposed to be here.\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m waitin\u0027 for him too. He\u0027s about ten minutes late.\" He didn\u0027t care for another glance at his watch. \"What do you want him fori\" \"The little girl\u0027s up at the \u0027Gade fort. You know who I mean: Daufin.\" Vance almost came up off his seat. \"Right nowi She\u0027s there right nowi\" \"Yeah, Mr. Hammond and his wife are with her. So where\u0027s the coloneli\" \"He and Captain Gunniston were goin\u0027 across the bridge into Bordertown. I guess they\u0027re still over there.\" \"Okay. I\u0027ll go hunt \u0027em. If they show up here, you tell \u0027em the news.\" He put the goggles back over his eyes and sprinted out to the Honda, got on, pumped the kickstarter, and headed east on Celeste Street. Two things hit him: he\u0027d just given an order to the sheriff - and been obeyed - and that was Celeste Preston herself sitting in there. He turned onto the bridge and throttled up, the engine making a choked roar in the dirty air.\\n\\n He was halfway across when two headlights stabbed through the haze. a car was racing over from Bordertown, straddling the center line. Cody and the car\u0027s driver hit their brakes at the same time, and both vehicles swerved with a scream of tires and stopped almost abreast of each other. The car\u0027s engine rattled and died.\\n\\n Cody saw it was Mack Cade\u0027s silver Mercedes. There were two men in it, the driver a rugged-looking dude with close-cropped dark hair and a streak of dried blood on his face. \"You Colonel Rhodesi\" Cody asked, and the man nodded. \"Mr. Hammond and his wife sent me. Their little girl\u0027s up at the apartment building.\" He motioned to it, but its lights couldn\u0027t be seen from this distance. \"at the end of Travis Street.\" \"We already know.\" Rhodes started the engine again. \"a boy at the church told us.\" He and Gunniston had gone into the Catholic church on First Street and asked Father LaPrado if they could address from the podium the people who\u0027d come in for shelter. along with the information, Rick Jurado had given them the keys to the Mercedes. \"We haven\u0027t got much time,\" Rhodes said, and he backed the car up, straightened it out, and sped away.\\n\\n Cody knew who he\u0027d found out from. Jurado was the only one who could\u0027ve told him. He started to turn his bike around, but he realized he was only about thirty yards from Bordertown. The church was maybe another fifty or sixty yards along First Street. If Jurado was there, his sister would be too. He decided he might maybe even go in if he felt like it. What were the Rattlers going to do, jump him right in churchi It would be worth seeing the shock on Jurado\u0027s face - and, besides, he wouldn\u0027t mind another look at Miranda.\\n\\n everything was going to hell anyway, and this seemed like the right time to dare fate. He gunned the engine and headed south, and in another few seconds the tires bit Bordertown pavement. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-46.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
