Must\u0027ve slashed her feet on broken glass, he figured. Lord, she\u0027s ready for the funny farm!\\n\\n Ginger\u0027s eyes stared straight ahead, a few remaining curlers drooping in her hair, her face a pale mask of dust.\\n\\n \"Swear to God, she scared shit out of me,\" Curt said, glancing at Danny Chaffin. The deputy made another circle of Ginger. \"I was on my way to the liquor store. Know where a man can get a drinki\" \"Liquor store\u0027s locked up,\" Vance told him, rising from his chair. \"That was one of the first things we did.\" \"Reckon so.\" Curt rubbed his mouth and gave a nervous smile; he felt as if he were shaking to pieces, and finding Ginger Creech walking like a brain-blasted zombie hadn\u0027t helped his jitters any, either. \"It\u0027s just... y\u0027know, I kinda need somethin\u0027 to take me through the night.\" From the open collar of his wrinkled white shirt hung his newly discovered necktie.\\n\\n \"Gingeri\" Vance waved his hand in front of her face. She blinked but did not speak. \"Can you hear mei\" \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for my boy,\" Curt said. \"either of you seen Codyi\" Vance had to laugh. He felt like he\u0027d gone ten rounds with Celeste Preston thirty minutes ago, when he\u0027d driven over to the Chaffin house on Oakley Street to pick up his deputy. He\u0027d wound up explaining about the spaceship to Vic and arleen Chaffin too, and arleen had begun crying and moaning about it being the end of the world. Vance had returned Celeste to her car, and the last he\u0027d seen of her she was driving westward in that big yellow Cadillac. Probably headin\u0027 for her hacienda and gonna hide under her bed, he thought. Well, nobody wanted her hangin\u0027 around here anyway!\\n\\n \"Curt,\" he said, \"if you didn\u0027t sleep twenty hours out of the day, you\u0027d be dangerous. Your boy raised hell at the Warp Room around nine-thirty, started a gang fight that put a bunch of kids in the clinic - which, with all these hurt people we\u0027ve got, Doc McNeil sure as shit don\u0027t need.\" \"Cody... in a fighti\" Time was all screwed up for Curt. He glanced at the clock, saw it had stopped at two minutes after ten. \"Is he all righti I mean...\" \"Yeah, he\u0027s okay. Busted up some, though. He headed over to the clinic.\" Which meant a doctor\u0027s bill, Curt thought. Damned fool kid! He didn\u0027t have the sense God gave a bug!\\n\\n \"Gingeri It\u0027s ed Vance. Danny, hand me that flashlight on the desk.\" He gripped it, flicked it on, and aimed it at the woman\u0027s sightless eyes. She flinched just a fraction, her arms stiffening at her sides. \"Gingeri What happenedi How come you\u0027re - \" She gave a terrible shudder, and her face strained as if its muscles were about to burst through the flesh.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s having a fit!\" Curt squalled, and backed across the woman\u0027s bloody tracks toward the door.\\n\\n Her gray lips trembled and opened. \"\u0027The... Lord... is my shepherd, I shall not want,\u0027\" she whispered. \"\u0027He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He... He leadeth me beside still waters...\u0027\" Tears broke and ran, and she stumbled on through the Twenty-third Psalm.\\n\\n Vance\u0027s heart was pounding. \"Danny, we\u0027d better get over to Dodge\u0027s house. I sure as hell don\u0027t like the looks of this.\" \"Yes sir.\" Danny glanced at the glass-fronted cabinet that held the assortment of firearms, and Vance read his mind because he was thinking the same thing.\\n\\n \"Break out a shotgun for me,\" Vance said. \"a rifle for you. Get \u0027em loaded.\" Danny took the key ring from him and unlocked the cabinet.\\n\\n \"\u0027I will... fear no...\u0027\" The words gripped in her throat. \"\u0027Fear no... fear no...\u0027\" She couldn\u0027t make herself say it, and fresh tears streamed down her face.\\n\\n \"Curt, I want you to get Ginger to the clinic. Find early and tell him - \" \"Hold on!\" Curt protested. He wanted nothing to do with this. \"I ain\u0027t a deputy!\" \"You are now. I\u0027ll swear you in later. Right now I want you to do what I say: take Ginger over there and tell early how you found her.\" He took the shotgun Danny gave him and put a few extra shells in his pockets.\\n\\n \"Uh... what do you think happenedi\" Curt\u0027s voice trembled. \"To Dodge, I meani\" \"I don\u0027t know, but we\u0027re gonna find out. Ginger, I want you to go with Curt. Okayi Can you hear mei\" \" \u0027Fear no...\u0027\" She squeezed her eyes shut, opened them again. \" \u0027Fear no...\u0027\" \"ed, I don\u0027t know about this,\" Curt said. \"I\u0027m not deputy material. Can\u0027t you get somebody else to take her overi\" \"Oh, Christ!\" Vance shouted as his own raw nerves stretched toward the breaking point. Ginger jumped and whimpered and retreated from him. \"Here! I\u0027ll pay you to do it!\" He dug into his back pocket, brought out his wallet, and flipped it open. The only thing in there was a five-dollar bill. \"Go on, take it! Go buy yourself a damned bottle at the Bob Wire Club, just move your ass!\" Curt\u0027s licked his lower lip. His hand burrowed into the wallet and came out five dollars richer.\\n\\n Vance gently took Ginger\u0027s arm and led her out. She came along docilely, her feet leaving bloody prints and her strained whisper of \"\u0027Fear no... fear no...\u0027\" sending shivers down the sheriff\u0027s backbone. Danny locked the door behind them and Curt guided the madwoman to his Buick, got her inside, and drove away toward the clinic, the tailpipe dragging and scratching sparks off the pavement.\\n\\n Vance drove the patrol car while Danny sat in silence on the passenger side with his hands clamped like vises around the rifle. Dodge Creech\u0027s house, made of sand-colored stucco with a red slate roof, stood near the corner of Celeste and Brazos streets. The front door was wide open. The sheriff and deputy could see the faint glow of candles or lamps within the house, but there was no sign of Dodge. Vance pulled the car to the curb, and they got out and started up the pebbled walk.\\n\\n about eight feet from the door, Vance\u0027s legs seized up. He\u0027d seen one of Ginger\u0027s slippers lying on the dry lawn. a coldness was writhing in his belly, and the doorway looked like a mouth, ready to crunch down on him as he entered. From a great distance he thought he heard brutal young voices taunting Burro! Burro! Burro!\\n\\n \"Sheriffi\" Danny had stopped at the door. \"You okayi\" In the dim violet light Vance\u0027s face glittered with sweat.\\n\\n \"Yeah. Fine.\" He bent over and rubbed his knees. \"Just old football knees. Sometimes they flare up on me.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you ever played football.\" \"It was a long time ago.\" He was perspiring everywhere: face, chest, back, ass. a cold, oily sweat. His career as a sheriff had been limited to breaking up fights, investigating traffic accidents, and hunting down lost dogs. He\u0027d never had to fire a gun in the line of duty, and the idea of going into that house and seeing what had made Ginger Creech go crazy made his balls crawl as if they were packed full of spiders.\\n\\n \"Want me to go on ini\" Danny asked.\\n\\n Yes, he almost said. But as he stared at the doorway, he knew he had to go in first. He had to, because he was the sheriff. Besides, he had a shotgun and Danny had a rifle. Whatever it was in there, it could be shot full of holes just like anything else. \"No,\" he said huskily. \"I\u0027ll go first.\" It took all his flabby willpower to start walking again. He entered the Creech house, flinching as he cleared the hungry doorway. a loose floorboard mewled under his right boot.\\n\\n \"Dodge!\" he called. His voice cracked. \"Dodge, where are youi\" They walked toward the light, through a foyer and into the living room, where a couple of oil lamps threw shadows and dust floated in layers from floor to ceiling.\\n\\n \"Sheriff, look at that!\" Danny had seen it first, and he pointed to the jagged-edged hole in the floor. Vance approached it, and he and Danny stood over the hole peering down into darkness.\\n\\n Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak.\\n\\n Both of them looked up at the same time, and both of them saw it.\\n\\n a figure sat in the rocking chair in the far corner of the room, slowly rocking back and forth, back and forth. a scatter of National Geographics lay on the floor beside the chair.\\n\\n Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak.\\n\\n \"D-Dodgei\" Vance whispered.\\n\\n \"Howdy,\" Dodge Creech said. Most of his face was in shadow, but he was still wearing his yellow-and-blue-plaid coat, dark blue slacks, pearl-gray shirt, two-toned loafers. His red lick of hair was greased back on his pate, and his hands were folded in his lap as he rocked.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s... what\u0027s goin\u0027 oni\" Vance asked. \"Ginger\u0027s about out of her - \" \"Howdy,\" the other man said again, still rocking. There was no color in his face, and his eyes glittered in the light of the two remaining lamps that hung from the ceiling\u0027s wagon-wheel fixture. The wagon wheel was crooked. Squeak, squeak went the chair\u0027s runners.\\n\\n His voice, Vance thought: his voice is funny. Raspy, like air through the bass pipes of a church organ. It sounded like Dodge\u0027s voice, yes, but... different too.\\n\\n The glittering eyes were watching him carefully. \"You\u0027re a person of authority, ain\u0027t youi\" the voice asked, with a humming of sinus cavities.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ed Vance. You know me. Come on, Dodge, what\u0027s this all abouti\" His knees were freezing solid again. Something was wrong with Dodge\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n \"ed Vance.\" Dodge\u0027s head tilted slightly to one side. \"ed Vance,\" he repeated, as if he\u0027d never heard the name before and he was making sure not to forget it. \"Yessir, I knew they\u0027d send a person of authority. That\u0027d be you, wouldn\u0027t iti\" Vance looked at Danny; the boy was about a hair away from jumping out of his shoes, his hands clutching the rifle to his chest. The cadence of Dodge Creech\u0027s voice, the flat phrasing, the drawl: all of it was the same, yet there was that low church-organ undertone, and a rattling like loose phlegm in Dodge\u0027s throat.\\n\\n \"So let me pose a question to you, pardner,\" the figure in the rocking chair said. \"Who\u0027s the guardiani\" \"The... guardiani\" \"I didn\u0027t stutter. Who\u0027s the guardiani\" \"Dodge... what\u0027re you talkin\u0027 abouti I don\u0027t know anythin\u0027 about a guardian.\" The rocking ceased. Danny gasped and took a backward step, and he might have plunged into the hole if he hadn\u0027t checked himself.\\n\\n \"Maybe you don\u0027t at that,\" the man in the chair replied. \"Maybe you do, and maybe you\u0027re handin\u0027 me bullshit on a platter, ed Vance.\" \"No, I swear it! I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about!\" The thought hit him like a bullet between the eyes: This isn\u0027t Dodge anymore.\\n\\n The figure stood up. Its clothes made a stiff crackling noise. Dodge Creech seemed two or three inches taller than Vance remembered, and much larger around the shoulders too. There was something funny about the way he moved his head - something like the jerky motion of a puppet on strings, guided by an unseen hand. The figure walked toward Vance, with that strange puppet\u0027s gait, and Vance backed away; it stopped, looked from Vance to Danny and back again, and then the white face with its wormy gray lips smiled - a teeth-clenched salesman\u0027s smile.\\n\\n \"The guardian,\" he repeated, and the light gleamed off teeth that were no longer teeth, but thousands of close-packed, blue metallic needles. \"Who is iti\" Vance couldn\u0027t seem to get his breath. \"I swear... don\u0027t know...\" \"Well sir, maybe I believe you.\" The figure in the garish sport coat slowly rubbed its thick, colorless hands together, and Vance saw that the fingernails were about an inch long, made of that same blue-tinged metal and edged with tiny saw-blade-like teeth. \"You bein\u0027 a person of authority and all, I ought to believe you, righti\" the thing in Dodge\u0027s skin asked.\\n\\n Vance had lost his voice.\\n\\n Danny\u0027s back hit the wall, and a framed picture of Dodge receiving an award at an insurance salesmen\u0027s convention clattered to the floor.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ll give you the benefit of the doubt. See, I\u0027ve come a long way, and I\u0027ve already spent a lot of time and effort.\" The metal-nailed hands kept rubbing together, and Vance realized that a swipe from one of them could rip his face off right down to the skull. \"I can find the guardian myself if I have to.\" The head suddenly whipped to the left with violent motion, and the thing\u0027s gaze followed the helicopter through a broken window as it circled the pyramid. \"I don\u0027t like that thing. Not the least bit. I don\u0027t want it flyin\u0027 around my property.\" Its attention returned to Vance, and the sheriff saw that there was no life in Dodge\u0027s eyes; they looked wet and dead, like false eyes stuck into a grinning mask. \"But I\u0027ll tell you true, ed Vance: if I don\u0027t find out who the guardian is real soon, I\u0027m gonna have to lay down the law. My kind of law.\" \"Who... what are youi\" Vance rasped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an...\" The figure paused for a few seconds. \"an exterminator. and you\u0027re a big fat bug. I\u0027ll be around, ed Vance, and I want you to remember me. Okayi\" Vance nodded, a drop of sweat hanging from the tip of his nose. \"Oka - \" One of Dodge\u0027s hands rose. The fingers probed the left eye and wrenched it from its socket. There was no blood, just strands of oozing fluid. The eyeball went into the needle-filled mouth and burst apart like a hardboiled egg as the jaws clamped down.\\n\\n Danny moaned, fighting against a faint, and madness clawed at Vance\u0027s brain.\\n\\n \"When I want you, I\u0027ll find you,\" the creature said. \"Don\u0027t try to hide. You can\u0027t. We square on that, pardneri\" \"Sq-sq-square.\" The word came out in a choke.\\n\\n \"Good bug.\" and then the figure turned away from Vance, took two long strides, and dropped into the hole in the living-room floor.\\n\\n They heard it thump to the bottom after a long fall. There was a quick scuttling sound. Then silence.\\n\\n Danny screamed. He sprang to the edge of the hole, lifted his rifle and began firing into it, his face contorted with horror. Gunsmoke whirled through the dusty air, and spent cartridges flew. He came to the end of his bullets, but he kept frantically trying to feed shells into the chamber.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" Vance said, or thought he had. \"Stop it, Danny. Stop it!\" The deputy shuddered and looked at him, his finger still jerking on the trigger, his nose running, and the wind whooshing in his lungs.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gone,\" Vance told him. \"Whatever it was... it\u0027s gone.\" \"I saw it - I saw it looked like Dodge but it wasn\u0027t no way no way in hell was it Dod - \" Vance gripped his collar and shook his hard. \"Listen to me, boy!\" he roared, right in Danny\u0027s face. \"I don\u0027t want you goin\u0027 as crazy as Ginger Creech, you hear mei\" He felt a wetness at his crotch and knew he\u0027d peed his pants, but right now he had to keep Danny from losing his mind. If the boy went over the edge, Vance would be right behind. \"You hear mei\" He gave another hard shake, which served to loosen the cobwebs of shock in his own brain as well.\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t Dodge. Wasn\u0027t,\" Danny mumbled. Then, with a gasp of breath: \"Yes sir. I hear you.\" \"Go to the car.\" The boy blinked dazedly, still staring into the hole. \"Go on, I said!\" Danny staggered out.\\n\\n Vance swung his shotgun up and aimed it at the hole. His hands shook so hard he figured he couldn\u0027t hit a barn door in broad daylight, much less an alien who ate eyeballs and had a thousand needles for teeth. Because that\u0027s exactly what it had been, he realized: an alien, dug itself a tunnel from the pyramid across the river and crawled inside Dodge Creech. My property, it had said. and what was that shit about a guardian, and how come it could speak english with a Texas accenti\\n\\n He backed away from the hole, his nerves sputtering. Tendrils of dust and gunsmoke broke, drifted, connected anew around him. He felt like a scream trapped in concrete, and right then he swore that if he got out of this, God willing, he was going to lose fifty pounds by Christmas.\\n\\n One step out of the house and he turned and ran to the patrol car, where Danny Chaffin sat gray-faced and staring at nothing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-27.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
