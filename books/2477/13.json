{"id":83370,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"The three o\u0027clock bell rang. \"Lockett and Jurado!\" Tom Hammond called out. \"You two stay in your seats. The rest of you can take off.\" \"Hey, man!\" Rick Jurado already had his white fedora on and had started out of his desk at the back left corner of the sweltering classroom. \"I didn\u0027t do anythin\u0027!\" \"I didn\u0027t say you did. Just stay seated.\" Other kids were gathering their books and leaving. Cody Lockett suddenly stood up from his desk at the room\u0027s right rear corner. \"Hell with this! I\u0027m goin\u0027!\" \"Sit down, Lockett!\" Tom rose from his own desk. \"I just want to talk to the both of you, that\u0027s all.\" \"You can talk to my south end while I\u0027m headed north,\" Cody answered, and the group of Renegades who sat protectively around him broke into laughter. \"Class is over, and I\u0027m gettin\u0027 out.\" He strode toward the door, with the others following. Tom stepped into his path. The boy kept coming, as if he were going to try to slam right through. Tom stayed where he was, braced for the impact, and Cody stopped about three feet short of a collision. Right behind him was a hulking two-hundred-pound senior who always wore a beat-up football helmet painted in mottled camouflage colors; his name was Joe Taylor, but Tom had never heard any of the others call him any name but \"Tank.\" and right now Tank was staring holes through him with deep-socketed black eyes in a craggy face only a mother could love - a demented mother, at that. Cody said, \"You movin\u0027, or noti\" Tom hesitated. Rick Jurado had settled back into his seat, smiling thinly. around him sat several Hispanic and Indian kids who belonged to the Rattlesnakes. The other seniors who weren\u0027t members of either \"club\" had already hurried out, and Tom was alone with the beasts. I\u0027ve started this, he thought; I\u0027ve got to finish it. He looked directly into Cody Lockett\u0027s haughty gray eyes and said, \"Not.\" Cody chewed on his lower lip. He couldn\u0027t read the teacher\u0027s face, but he knew he hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. Lately. \"You can\u0027t flunk me. I\u0027ve already passed the final.\" \"Just sit down and hear me out. Okayi\" \"Hey, I\u0027ll hear you out, man!\" Rick called. He hooked an empty desk toward him and propped both feet atop it, leaning back with his arms crossed. \"Lockett don\u0027t understan\u0027 no english no how, Mr. Hammon\u0027,\" he said, deliberately thickening his accent. \"Shut your face, spitball,\" Tank rumbled. at once several Rattlesnakes were on their feet; a skinny, curly-haired boy sitting next to Rick leapt up. He wore a red bandanna around his forehead and five or six small crucifixes on chains around his neck. \"Fuck you, fat boy!\" he shouted in a thin, reedy voice. \"Your mother and sister.\" Tank showed him a middle finger. The Hispanic boy almost flung himself over the rows of desks to get at Tank, who outweighed him by at least seventy pounds - but Rick\u0027s hand shot out and grasped his wrist. \"easy, easy,\" he said quietly, his smile still in place and his gaze aimed at Cody. \"Hang back, muchachos. Pequin, you settle down, man.\" Pequin, whose real name was Pedro esquimelas, was trembling with fury, but he allowed himself to be restrained. He sat down, muttering obscenities in gutter Spanish; the other Rattlers - among them Chris Torrez, Diego Montana, and Len Redfeather - remained standing and ready for trouble. Tom could hear disaster knocking at the door; if he didn\u0027t keep control of this, the classroom could erupt into a battlefield. But at least Pequin had quieted. Tom knew the boy had a fiery temper that got him into a fight almost every day; his nickname was appropriate, because a pequin was a small chile pepper that would make the devil reach for Pepto-Bismol. \"How about iti\" Tom asked Cody. The boy shrugged. In his locker was the tie rack he\u0027d finally finished; he wanted to get that home and work a couple of hours for Mr. Mendoza, but otherwise he wasn\u0027t in a hurry. \"If I stay, they stay.\" He nodded at his entourage - six tough \u0027Gades: Will Latham, Mike Frackner, Bobby Clay Clemmons, Davy Summers, and Tank. \"Okay. Just sit down.\" Cody sauntered back to his desk. The others followed his lead. Tank leaned one massive shoulder against the cinder-block wall and cleaned his fingernails with an unbent gem clip. \"I\u0027m gettin\u0027 old waitin\u0027, amigo,\" Rick announced. Tom walked to his desk and sat on its edge. On the blackboard behind him was the outline of a Robert e. Howard Conan story he\u0027d asked them to read for a discussion of laws in a barbarian culture. Very few had done it. \"Tomorrow\u0027s your last day of school,\" he began. \"I wanted to - \" \"Oh, madre!\" Rick moaned and pulled the fedora down over his eyes. Pequin put his head on his desk and snored noisily. The \u0027Gades watched in stony silence. Tom\u0027s shirt was wet, sticking to his back and shoulders. The fan was only blowing hot air around. Tank suddenly burped; it was like a howitzer going off, and brought laughter from the \u0027Gades and silence from the Rattlers. Tom tried again: \"I wanted to tell you that - \" but his voice snagged. None of them were even looking at him. They didn\u0027t give a shit, had already retreated behind masks of boredom. Dammit to hell! he thought. I might as well try to lasso the damned moon as get them to listen! But he was mad now - mad at their bored poses, mad at whoever was supposed to fix the screwed-up air conditioners, mad at himself for being so stupid. He felt the walls closing in on him, a rivulet of sweat running down his neck; a surge of anger grew and swelled, thrashed mightily - then broke its bounds and rushed through him. His hand reacted to it first. He picked up the Governments in Transition textbook from his desk and threw it with all his strength across the room. It whacked against the back wall like a gunshot. Pequin jumped and lifted his head. Rick Jurado slowly pushed the fedora up off his eyes. Tank stopped cleaning his nails, and Cody Lockett\u0027s gaze sharpened. Tom\u0027s face had reddened. \"So that gets your attention, huhi a loud noise and a little destructioni Does that make the wheels turni\" \"Yeah,\" Cody answered. \"You should\u0027ve thrown that fuckin\u0027 book against the wall the first day of class.\" \"Tough guys - and girl,\" Tom said, glancing at Maria Navarre, who sat with the Rattlers. \"Real tough. Lockett, you and Jurado have got a lot in common - \" Rick snorted with derision. \"a lot in common,\" Tom continued. \"Both of you have outdone each other acting tough and stupid so you can impress the losers sitting around you right now. I\u0027ve seen your tests. I know the difference between bullshitting and holding back. Both of you could\u0027ve done a whole hell of a lot better if you\u0027d - \" \"Man, you\u0027ve got runnin\u0027 off at the mouth!\" Cody interrupted. \"Maybe so.\" Rivers of sweat were flowing from Tom\u0027s armpits. He had to keep going. \"I know both of you could\u0027ve done a lot better. But you pretend you\u0027re dumb, or bored - or just fucked up.\" The use of that word cemented their attention. \"I say you\u0027re both cowards.\" There was a long silence. Lockett and Jurado\u0027s expressions were blank. \"Welli\" Tom prodded. \"Come on! I can\u0027t believe two tough guys like you can\u0027t come up with some sharp - \" \"Yeah, I\u0027ve got somethin\u0027 to say.\" Cody stood up. \"Class dismissed.\" \"Okay, go ahead! Get out! at least Jurado has the guts to stay and listen!\" Cody smiled coldly. \"You\u0027re walkin\u0027 a mighty fine wire, mister,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll sit and listen to your shit durin\u0027 school hours, but when that bell rings it\u0027s my time.\" He shook his head, and his skull earring threw a red glint of sunlight. \"Man, who do you think you arei You think you know all the answers, and you can just spout \u0027em outi Mister, you don\u0027t know a jackdamn thing about me!\" \"I know you listen in class, whether you want anybody to know it or not. I know you\u0027re a lot smarter than you let on - \" \"Forget that! Just forget it! When you walk in my shoes, you can preach to me! Until then you can go straight to hell!\" There was a murmur of assent from the other Renegades. Someone applauded. Tom looked over at Rick Jurado, who was slowly clapping his hands. \"Hey, Lockett!\" he taunted. \"You gonna be an actor, mani You oughta win an award or somethin\u0027!\" \"You don\u0027t like iti\" Cody\u0027s tone was chilling, but his eyes burned. \"You know what you can do about it, mother-fuck.\" Rick\u0027s clapping stopped. His body had tensed, his legs about to spring him from his desk. \"Maybe I do, Lockett. Maybe I\u0027ll come burn your fuckin\u0027 house down like your people\u0027ve been burnin\u0027 ours.\" \"Cut the threats,\" Tom said. \"Yeah, make me laugh!\" Cody jeered, ignoring the teacher. \"We didn\u0027t burn any houses. Hell, you burned \u0027em yourself so you could holler that we did it!\" \"You come across that bridge at night, hombre,\" Rick said quietly, \"and we\u0027ll give you a real hot fiesta.\" a savage grin hung on his lip. \"Understand, shitkickeri\" \"I\u0027m shakin\u0027!\" In truth, no \u0027Gade - as far as Cody knew - had set fire to those houses in Bordertown. \"Okay, hold it!\" Tom demanded. \"Why don\u0027t you two forget that gang crapi\" They glared at him as if he were the most useless insect to ever crawl from a hole. \"Man,\" Rick said, \"you\u0027re way off base. about that and all this school shit too.\" He looked at Tom with bored eyes. \"at least I hung in and finished. I know a lot who didn\u0027t.\" \"and what happened to themi\" \"Some of \u0027em got rich, dealin\u0027 coke. Some of \u0027em got dead too.\" He shrugged. \"Some of \u0027em went into other things.\" \"Like working for Mack Cadei That\u0027s not much of a future, and neither is prison.\" \"Neither is crawlin\u0027 every day to a job you hate and kissin\u0027 ass to keep it.\" Now Rick had had enough, and he stood up. \"People in this town kissed old man Preston\u0027s ass for about fifty years. Where\u0027d it get themi\" Tom started to reply, but the wheels of logic in his brain froze up. He had nothing to counter the question with. \"Don\u0027t have all the answers, do youi\" Rick continued. \"See, you live in a nice house, on a nice street. You don\u0027t have to listen to somebody tellin\u0027 you where you can and can\u0027t walk, like you were a dog on a short leash. You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to have to fight for everything you\u0027ve got, or ever will have.\" \"That\u0027s not the point. I\u0027m talking about your educa - \" \"That is the fuckin\u0027 point!\" Rick yelled, startling Tom into silence. He trembled, clenched his fists, and waited out the anger. \"That is the point,\" he repeated tautly. \"Not school. Not books written by dead men. Not kissin\u0027 ass every day until you learn to like the taste. The point is to fight until you get what you want.\" \"So tell me what you want.\" \"What I want.\" Rick smiled bitterly. \"I want respect. I want to walk any street I please - even your street, Mr. Hammond. In the middle of the night, if I want to, without the sheriff slammin\u0027 me up against his car. I want a future without somebody ridin\u0027 my ass from dawn to sundown. I want to know that tomorrow\u0027s gonna be better than today. Can you give me those thingsi\" \"I can\u0027t,\" Tom said. \"You can give them to yourself. The first thing is not to give up your mind. You do that and you lose everything, no matter how tough you think you are.\" \"More words.\" Rick sneered. \"They don\u0027t mean shit. Well, you read your dead men\u0027s books. Teach \u0027em if you want to. But don\u0027t pretend they really matter, man, because only this matters.\" He lifted his clenched fist, the knuckles scarred from other battles. He turned toward Cody Lockett. \"You! Listen up! Your whore hurt one of my men today. Hurt him real bad. and I got a visit this mornin\u0027 from that other whore, the one with the badge. You got a deal with Vancei You payin\u0027 him to let you burn down our housesi\" \"You\u0027re crazy as hell.\" Cody had about as much use for Sheriff Vance as a coyote had for a sidewinder. \"I owe you some pain, Lockett. For Paco LeGrande,\" Rick went on. \"and I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that any of my people who cross that damned bridge better be left alone.\" \"They come over at night, they\u0027re askin\u0027 to be stomped. We\u0027ll be real glad to oblige.\" \"Man, you\u0027re not the fuckin\u0027 king around here!\" Rick shouted, and before he could think about it he picked up the desk in front of him and flung it aside. at once all the Rattlers and Renegades were on their feet, separated only by the imaginary line that divided the classroom. \"We\u0027ll go where we please!\" \"Not across the bridge at night,\" Cody warned. \"Not into \u0027Gade territory.\" \"Okay, settle down.\" Tom stepped between them. He felt like an utter fool for having thought this would do any good. \"Fighting isn\u0027t going to - \" \"Shut up!\" Rick snapped. \"You\u0027re out of this, man!\" He kept staring at Cody. \"You want a wari You keep pushin\u0027 it.\" \"Hey!\" Oh, Christ! Tom thought. \"I don\u0027t want to hear any of that - \" Tank started to lunge at Rick Jurado, but Cody grasped his arm. He figured the Rattlers were carrying blades, like all wetbacks did. anyway, he didn\u0027t like the odds and this wasn\u0027t the time or place. \"Big man,\" Cody said. \"Big talk.\" \"I\u0027ll let my boot talk to your ass!\" Rick threatened; he kept his tough mask on, but inside he didn\u0027t want a showdown just yet. He didn\u0027t like the odds and, anyway, he figured all the \u0027Gades were packing knives. His own blade was in his locker, and he didn\u0027t allow any of the other Rattlers to bring knives to school. \"Let\u0027s get it on right now!\" Pequin whooped. Rick restrained the urge to bash him in the mouth. Pequin liked to start fights, but he rarely finished them. \"You call it, Jurado,\" Cody challenged, and almost winced when Tank started making a clucking chicken noise to goad the Rattlers. \"There\u0027s not going to be any fighting!\" Tom shouted, but he knew they weren\u0027t listening. \"You hear mei If I see any trouble in the parking lot, I\u0027m going up to the office and call the sheriff! Got iti\" \"Fuck the sheriff!\" Bobby Clay Clemmons bellowed. \"We\u0027ll whip his ass too!\" The moment stretched. Cody was ready for the Rattlers to make the first move, and he was measuring a blow to Jurado\u0027s solar plexus; but Rick stood rock-steady, awaiting the attack that he knew was coming. a figure limped into the doorway. abruptly halted. \"Oh! Red says stop!\" Cody glanced over his shoulder, but he already knew who it was from the high, childlike voice. The man in the doorway wore a faded gray uniform, carried a mop, and pushed a combination bucket and wringer. He was in his early sixties, his moon-shaped face ravaged by deep lines and brown age spots, his white hair cropped so close to the scalp it looked like a fine layer of sand. at his left temple there was an unmistakable indentation in his head. The little name tag on his custodian\u0027s uniform said \"Sarge.\" \"Sorry, Mr. Hammond. Didn\u0027t know anybody was still here. Green says go!\" He started to leave, favoring a right leg that folded up at the knee joint like an accordian. \"No! Wait!\" Tom called. \"We\u0027re just clearing out. aren\u0027t wei\" he asked Rick and Cody. The only sound was Pequin cracking his knuckles. Cody took the initiative. \"You want a nitro lesson, you know where to find me. anytime, anyplace. But you\u0027re gonna stay off \u0027Gade territory after dark.\" Before the other boy could reply, Cody turned his back and stalked to the door. Tank stood watchful guard while the Renegades followed, then he left as well. Rick started to shout a profanity, but checked it. This wasn\u0027t the time; it would come, but not now. Pequin hollered it for him: \"Fuck you, assholes!\" \"Hey!\" Sarge Dennison scowled. \"Mama\u0027ll wash out that dirty mouth!\" He glared reproachfully at Pequin, then dipped the mop in his bucket and went to work, \"It\u0027s been a real rush, Mr. Hammond,\" Rick told him. \"Maybe next time we can all come over to your house for milk and cookies.\" Tom\u0027s heart was still racing, but he made the effort to at least appear composed. \"Just remember what I said. You\u0027re too smart to throw your life a - \" Rick gathered saliva and spat on the linoleum. Sarge stopped mopping, his expression a deuce of righteous anger and bewilderment. \"You just wait!\" Sarge said. \"Scooter\u0027ll chew your legs off!\" \"I\u0027m real scared.\" everybody knew Sarge was crazy, but Rick liked him. and he kind of admired Mr. Hammond for what he\u0027d just tried to do, but he sure as hell wasn\u0027t going to cut the teacher any slack. That just wasn\u0027t how things were done. \"Let\u0027s haul,\" he told the other Rattlers, and they left the classroom chattering in Spanish, laughing and beating on lockers with an overspill of nervous energy. In the corridor, Rick whacked Pequin on the back of his head a little too roughly to be just jiving, but Pequin grinned anyway, showing a silver tooth at the front of his mouth. Tom stood listening to their noise recede along the hall like a wave washing toward a distant shore. He did not belong to their world, and he felt incredibly stupid. Worse than that: he felt old. Damn, what a fiasco! I almost stirred up a gang war! he thought. \"Settle down, boy. They\u0027re gone now,\" Sarge said as he mopped the floor. \"Pardoni\" \"Just talkin\u0027 to Scooter.\" Sarge nodded toward an empty corner. \"He gets jumpy around them guys.\" Tom nodded. Sarge returned to work, his wrinkled face a study of concentration. as Tom understood, \"Sarge\" Dennison had been hurt as a young soldier in the last months of World War II, and the shock had left him with the mind of a child. He\u0027d been on the custodial staff for over fifteen years, and he lived in a small adobe house at the end of Brazos Street, across from the Inferno Baptist Church. The ladies of the Sisterhood Club brought him home-cooked dinners and kept watch over him so he wouldn\u0027t wander the streets in his pajamas, but otherwise he was pretty self-sufficient. The matter of Scooter, though, was something quite different: Sarge would look at you as if you were deranged if you didn\u0027t agree that a dog - of uncertain breed - was curled up in an empty corner, perched in a chair, or sitting at his feet. Sure there\u0027s a Scooter! Sarge would say, pointing to the fact that Scooter was fast and shy and often didn\u0027t want to be seen but that food left in Scooter\u0027s dish on the front porch in the evening would be gone by first light. The ladies of the Sisterhood Club had long ago stopped trying to tell Sarge there was no Scooter, because he cried too easily. \"They\u0027re not so tough,\" Sarge said, swabbing up Jurado\u0027s spit. \"Those guys, I mean. They\u0027re just actin\u0027 is all.\" \"Maybe so.\" That was no consolation, though. Tom was jangled to the core. It was three-fifteen, and Ray would be waiting at the car. He opened the top drawer of his desk and got his keys. For some reason he thought of the car keys that must be somewhere in the Perez house, and he wondered if Mr. Perez ever held them and weighed them against the life of his son. He felt the swift current of time passing, and he knew that at this moment vultures were circling over the Great Fried empty. He closed his drawer. \"See you tomorrow, Sarge.\" \"Green says go,\" Sarge said, and Tom walked out of the sun-streaked classroom.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-13.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
