{"id":83413,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"Matt Rhodes was the first down the rope into the hole beneath Sonny Crowfield\u0027s house. The bull\u0027s-eye lantern was tied to his waist and a fully loaded automatic rifle from Crowfield\u0027s arsenal was strapped around his shoulder. as soon as his shoes squished into the ooze at the bottom, he took the lantern off and aimed it into the tunnel ahead. Nothing moved in there but the slow dripping of gray slime. He looked up, saw Rick Jurado\u0027s light about twenty feet above. He pulled on the rope, and Rick started down.\\n\\n Rick had the second of Crowfield\u0027s rifles, as well as one of the flashlights they\u0027d gotten from people at the fortress. When Rick made it down, the rope was hauled up and a few seconds later came down again tied around the device Daufin had suggested they make: four of the bright battery lamps wired together and with a wire handle like a basket of light. It illuminated the tunnel with a powerful white glare, and Rhodes breathed a lot easier when it reached the bottom.\\n\\n Jessie climbed down next, carrying a flashlight and the Winchester strapped to her shoulder. Tom followed, with Daufin clinging around his neck. The last down was Curt Lockett. Hanging at his chest was a hiker\u0027s backpack, brought from the hardware store, that held the five sticks of dynamite and the hogleg Colt.\\n\\n Tom set Daufin down. The tunnel that stretched before them was about seven feet in height and another six or seven feet wide. In the muck around them were pieces of the house\u0027s floor, a mattress, and a broken-up bed. Crowfield was probably lying in it when the floor split open, Rick figured. He unstrapped the rifle, propped its stock against his hip, and kept the flashlight\u0027s beam pointed ahead. Rhodes gave his lantern to Tom and took the bundle of battery lamps. \"Okay,\" Rhodes said quietly, his voice echoing. \"I\u0027ll go first. Daufin behind me. Then Jessie, Tom, Lockett, and Rick brings up the rear. Lockett, I don\u0027t want you throwing those sticks without my order. Got iti\" a flame flared. Curt lit a Lucky with the Bic lighter. \"Got it, boss man.\" \"Rick, make sure you watch our backs. and everybody keep as quiet as you can: we want to be able to hear anything digging.\" He swallowed thickly. The air was wet and heavy down here, and the rotten-peaches odor of the gray ooze stung his nostrils. The slime hung from the ceiling and sides of the tunnel like grotesque stalactites, pools of it shimmering an iridescent silver on the floor. \"What\u0027s this wet shit all over the placei\" Curt asked. It was about two inches deep underfoot, as slick as engine grease.\\n\\n \"Stinger digs these tunnels,\" Daufin answered. \"It sprays them with lubricant so it can move faster.\" \"Lubricant!\" Curt grunted. Little ants of fear were running figure eights in his belly. \"Stuff looks like snot!\" \"One thing I want to know,\" Rhodes said. \"Does the power source that runs the replicants come from Stinger or the shipi\" \"From Stinger.\" Daufin peered down the tunnel ahead, alert for any sign of movement. \"The replicants are expendable, meant to be discarded after their use is finished.\" The replication process must be incredibly fast, Jessie thought. The creation of living tissue bonded with metallic fibers, the inner organs, synthetic bones - all of it was too much for an earthbound mind to comprehend. Her own questions about what Stinger looked like, and how it created the replicants from human bodies, would have to wait. It was time to go.\\n\\n \"everybody readyi\" Rhodes waited for them all to reply, and then he started into the tunnel, careful of his footing in the slime and trying very hard not to think about the size of the monster that had drilled through the Texas dirt.\\n\\n Rick shone the light behind them. all clear. Before leaving the \u0027Gade fort, he\u0027d knelt down beside Paloma and held her hands between his. Had told her what he had to do, and why. She\u0027d listened silently, her head bowed. Then she\u0027d asked him to pray with her, and he\u0027d rested his cheek against her forehead as she begged God\u0027s mercy on her grandson and granddaughter. She\u0027d kissed his hand and looked at him with those sightless eyes that had always seen to his soul. \"Dios anda con los bravos,\" she\u0027d whispered, and let him go.\\n\\n He hoped she was right, and that God did indeed walk with the brave. Or at least watch over the desperate.\\n\\n Since leaving the apartment building, they\u0027d seen neither the creature that had grown out of the horse nor any of the human-sized Stingers. They\u0027d found two fifteen-foot lengths of rope at the hardware store and had come across the bridge, where Rick\u0027s heart had sunk when he\u0027d seen the battered remains of Cody Lockett\u0027s motorcycle still burning. He didn\u0027t know if Cody\u0027s old man recognized the machine too, but Curt Lockett hadn\u0027t made a sound.\\n\\n The tunnel veered to the right. The lamps revealed an intersection of three passages, all going in different directions. Rhodes chose the center of the tunnels, which continued in what he thought was the way to the black pyramid, and Daufin nodded when he looked at her for reassurance. They went into it, their lights glinting off the wet walls. In another moment they could hear a steady pounding ahead, like the beating of a huge heart.\\n\\n \"Stinger\u0027s ship,\" Daufin whispered. \"The systems are charging.\" Rick kept his flashlight aimed behind them. and it happened so fast he had no time to cry out: a hunchbacked figure scurried into the beam about twenty feet away, lifted its hands before its face, and quickly retreated to the darkness.\\n\\n Rick stopped. His knees were rubbery. He\u0027d seen the weaving tail, and the thing had resembled a mottled eight-legged scorpion with a human head. \"Coloneli\" He said it louder: \"Coloneli\" The others had gone on a few paces, but now Rhodes halted and looked back. \"What\u0027s wrongi\" \"It knows we\u0027re here,\" Rick answered.\\n\\n From in front of them came a woman\u0027s Texan drawl: \"I wouldn\u0027t come any closer if I were ya\u0027ll.\" Rhodes swung around and held the lamps up. Twelve or fifteen feet ahead, the tunnel wound to the left and he knew the creature must be standing around that turn.\\n\\n \"You bugs sure like to live dangerous,\" Stinger said. \"Is the guardian with youi\" Daufin took a step forward. \"I\u0027m here,\" she said defiantly. \"I want the three humans set free.\" There was a cold little laugh. \"Lordy Mercy, was that an orderi Honeychild, you\u0027re in my world now. You want to come on and give yourself up, I might think about lettin\u0027 the bugs go.\" \"either you set them free,\" Daufin said, \"or we will.\" That brought another giggle. \"Look behind you, honeychild. You can\u0027t see me, but I\u0027m there. I\u0027m in the walls. I\u0027m up over you and down underneath. I\u0027m everywhere.\" anger was creeping in. \"I\u0027ve got your pod now, honeychild. That\u0027ll be good enough for my bounty. Plus I\u0027ve found a whole world full of bugs that can\u0027t fight worth a damn, and I ought to thank you for leadin\u0027 me here.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027re not going anywhere.\" \"Noi Who\u0027s gonna stop mei\" \"I am.\" There was silence. Daufin knew Stinger would not rush forward into the glare. and then Stinger hissed: \"Come on, then. I\u0027m waitin\u0027 for you. Come on, let\u0027s see what color your guts are!\" \"Get down,\" Curt said quietly, and he touched the fuse of the dynamite stick he was holding to the red tip of his cigarette. The fuse smoked and sparked, began to burn, and Rhodes shouted, \"I told you not to - \" \"Fuck it,\" Curt said, and hurled the stick toward the bend in the tunnel.\\n\\n Rhodes grabbed Daufin and threw both himself and her into the muck. The others hit the ground and two seconds later there was a blast like a dozen shotguns going off. The tunnel\u0027s floor shook, chunks of dirt flying through the air and showering down. Rhodes sat up, his ears ringing. Daufin struggled out from underneath him and got to her knees. She looked back in amazement at Curt, who was already on his feet and taking another puff from his bent cigarette. \"That\u0027s what dynamite is,\" he said.\\n\\n Stinger\u0027s voice did not return. But from around the bend there was a terrible gasping sound, like air being drawn into diseased lungs. Rhodes stood up, cocked his rifle, and held it as steady as he could, then began walking forward. He crouched and rounded the bend, ready to open fire.\\n\\n Something was on the tunnel floor, trying to crawl away through the ooze. It had one arm, the other a blackened mass lying several feet away, and its head was a misshapen lump. In the torn face, the mouth full of broken needles gasped like the gill of a bizarre fish, and the single remaining eye flinched in the light. The spiked tail had risen from its backbone and thrashed weakly from side to side. The thing\u0027s hand started clawing frantically at the dirt, trying to dig itself in.\\n\\n Rhodes held the bundle of lamps closer to its face, avoiding the twitching tail. The awful ruined mouth stretched open, spilling gray fluid, and the eye began to smoke and burn in its socket. a charred, acrid chemical odor hung in the air. The eye popped open, melted in a rivulet of ooze, and the body shuddered and lay still. The tail thrashed once more before it fell like a dead flower.\\n\\n electric light burns out the thing\u0027s eyes, Rhodes thought. and once they were blinded, Stinger had no more use for the replicants - which were, in essence, walking and talking cameras - so the power source that animated them was simply turned off. But if all the replicants were in some strange way part of Stinger - powered perhaps by Stinger\u0027s brainwaves - then it was likely Stinger could feel pain: the impact of a bullet, or the blast of dynamite. You hurt me, he remembered the creature saying to him in Dodge Creech\u0027s house. all the replicants were Stinger, and Stinger was vulnerable to pain through them.\\n\\n Rhodes led the others past the burned shape on the ground, his pace faster. Daufin glanced only incuriously at the thing, but Jessie didn\u0027t let herself look at it. Curt tapped his ashes onto the mangled head, though he moved past as rapidly as everyone else.\\n\\n and they were about ten feet past the dead replicant when dirt exploded from the tunnel wall to Rhodes\u0027s right. a hunchbacked shape lunged for the lamps, its tail breaking loose from the dirt and slamming into the ceiling. Rhodes twisted toward it, but the thing was on top of him before he could fire. He heard gunshots: Rick and Tom\u0027s rifles firing almost point-blank, and then his shoulder was hit by what felt like a runaway power saw and he was lifted off his feet. He was knocked against the other wall with a force that almost broke his back. Jessie screamed, and then there was more gunfire and Rhodes\u0027s knees were sagging, warm wetness spilling along his arm. He went down.\\n\\n Rick saw the thing\u0027s face: dark eyes and gray hair - the face of Mr. Diaz, who owned the shoe repair shop on Second Street, on a scorpion\u0027s body. He thrust his rifle\u0027s barrel into that face and blew its lower jaw away. The creature reeled backward, one arm rising to shield its eyes from the light. Curt fired one of his four bullets, shot a chunk out of its head, and dark wormy things boiled from the wound. Its tail swung, narrowly missing Tom\u0027s head. Then the replicant turned and dove into the hole it had emerged from, scurrying back into the dirt and disappearing within seconds.\\n\\n Gunsmoke drifted through the tunnel. Jessie was already on her knees beside the colonel, and she could see the glint of bone down in the wound on his shoulder. There was a lot of blood. Rhodes\u0027s face was ashen. He was still gripping his rifle and the lamps\u0027 handle in white-knuckled hands.\\n\\n \"Bastard clawed me,\" Rhodes said. \"Trying to break out the lights.\" \"Don\u0027t talk.\" Jessie tore the shirt away from the ripped flesh. The wound was deep and nasty; slashed muscle tissue clenched and relaxed.\\n\\n Cold sweat had welled up on Rhodes\u0027s face. He smiled faintly at Jessie\u0027s frown of concern. \"Lady, talking\u0027s about all I can do right now. I\u0027m a mess, huhi\" She looked up at Tom. \"We\u0027ve got to get him out.\" \"No! By the time you do... Stinger will have taken off.\" Rhodes\u0027s arm was, thankfully, still numb. He clasped his hand over the wound and gripped tightly, as if to hold back the pain before it hit. \"Listen to me. If you want to get Stevie back... and the others too... you\u0027ve got to do it for yourselves. I\u0027ve gone as far as I can go.\" He found Daufin, who was standing next to Rick and watching him intently. \"Daufin... you said you could lead them. Here\u0027s your chance.\" \"How bad\u0027s he hurti\" Daufin asked Jessie.\\n\\n \"No major artery\u0027s cut. Mostly muscle damage. It\u0027s the shock I\u0027m worried about; he\u0027s already suffered too many traumas tonight.\" \"So who hasn\u0027ti\" Rhodes was getting cold, and he felt unconsciousness pulling at him. \"Leave me here and go! We\u0027ve come this far, dammit! Go!\" \"He\u0027s right,\" Rick said. \"We\u0027ve got to go on.\" \"I\u0027m gettin\u0027 my boy out of there, by God,\" Curt vowed, though his stomach fluttered with fear. \"No matter what.\" \"We have to go,\" Daufin agreed. The rhythmic pounding of the ship\u0027s systems drawing power from the reserves was getting louder. She knelt down beside Colonel Rhodes. \"Stinger may come for you. You know that, don\u0027t youi\" \"Yep. Here.\" He pushed the lamps toward her. \"Somebody give me a flashlight.\" Tom did, and Rhodes propped the rifle up beside him with a bloody finger on the trigger.\\n\\n \"and dynamite too,\" Daufin suggested. Curt gave him a stick, lit a cigarette for him, and put it between the colonel\u0027s gray lips.\\n\\n \"Thanks. Now I\u0027m loaded for bear.\" Rhodes looked into Daufin\u0027s face. He no longer saw a little girl. a being impassioned and proud was kneeling next to him, and she had ancient eyes that had endured a world of pain but still had the shine of courage. \"You\u0027re okay,\" he told her, in a weakening voice. \"I hope you get back to your...\" How had she put iti \"Your tribe,\" he remembered. \"I hope you teach them that life is worth fighting for.\" \"I will.\" She gently laid her hand against his grizzled cheek, and he could feel the tingle of electricity in her fingers. \"You\u0027re not going to die.\" It was a command.\\n\\n \"I always planned on dying in South Dakota, anyway. In bed, when I\u0027m a hundred and one.\" The pain was beginning to take him, but he didn\u0027t let his face show it. \"You\u0027d better go.\" \"We\u0027ll be back for you,\" Rick said.\\n\\n \"You sure as hell better be.\" He put the stick of dynamite across his chest, just in case.\\n\\n Daufin gave Jessie the lamps and then started along the tunnel at a brisk pace. Jessie and the others followed. The metallic boom of the ship\u0027s pulse told Daufin that the systems were rapidly energizing. The tunnel wound to the left just ahead. They had to be almost under the ship by now, and soon they\u0027d see the opening into it. The question was: would Stinger try to stop them from getting inside, or let them enter the shipi\\n\\n as her eyes darted from side to side and she listened for the scurrying of claws digging in the dirt, Daufin knew Stinger was right: this warren of tunnels was his world, and he was everywhere.\\n\\n Her legs moving like little pistons, the alien warrior in the body of a child advanced deeper into Stinger\u0027s realm. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-56.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
