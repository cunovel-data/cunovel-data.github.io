{"id":83365,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The bell shrilled for change of classes, and in another moment the quiet halls of Preston High were tumultuous. The central air conditioning was still broken, the bathrooms reeked of cigarette and marijuana smoke, but the rowdy shouts and laughter underscored a joyful abandon. Much of the laughter, though, had a false ring. all the students knew this was Preston High\u0027s final year; even if Inferno was a hot and hellish place, it was still home, and home was a hard place to leave. They were walking histories of the struggles that had preceded them, their features a mirror of the tribes and races that had come up from Mexico and down from the heartland to carve a home in the Texas desert: here the sleek black hair and sharp cheekbones of the Navajo; the high forehead and ebony glare of the apache; the aquiline nose and sculpted profile of the conquistador; there the blond, brown, or red hair of frontiersmen and pioneers, the wiry builds of bronco busters, and the long, confident strides of easterners who\u0027d come to Texas seeking their fortunes long before the first shot had fired at a mission called the alamo. It was all there in the faces and bones, in the walks and expressions and speech of the students changing classes. a hundred years of showdowns, cattle drives, and saloon brawls moved through the hallways. But their ancestors, even the buckskinned Indian fighters and the warpainted braves who\u0027d sliced off their scalps, might have moaned in their graves if they\u0027d been able to see current fashions from the Happy Hunting Ground. Some of the boys had their heads shaved to a military stubble, some had hair twisted into spikes and tinted with outrageous colors, some wore crewcuts with long tails of hair hanging down their backs. Many of the girls had hair cropped just as severely as the boys\u0027 and dyed even more garishly, some wore sleek Princess Di cuts, and some sported manes swept back and frozen with gel, then decorated with feathers in an unconscious tribute to their Indian heritage. They wore a mixed assemblage of jumpsuits, overalls in military camouflage patterns, madras-plaid shirts with buckskin fringe, T-shirts that exalted bands like the Hooters, the Beastie Boys, and the Dead Kennedys, paisley surfer tees in electric hues that slam-danced the eyeballs, tie-dyed khaki trousers, faded and patched jeans, pegged pants with Day-Glo stripes, combat boots, hand-painted sneakers, penny loafers, gladiator sandals, and plain old flipflops carved out of used tires. There\u0027d been a dress code at the beginning of the year, but the principal of Preston High - a short Hispanic man named Julius Rivera and known as Little Caesar by the student body - had gradually let the code go when it was apparent there would be no reprieve for the school. Students in Presidio County would be bussed thirty miles to the high school in Marfa, and in September Little Caesar would be teaching a sophomore geometry class at Northbrook High in Houston. The seconds ticked past on the clocks, and the young descendants of gunfighters, ranch hands, and Indian chiefs continued to their next classes. Ray Hammond was digging his english text from his locker in B Section. His mind was on getting to his next class, way at the end of C Section, and he didn\u0027t see what was coming up behind him. as he brought the book out, a size-ten foot in a scuffed combat boot suddenly kicked it from his hand. The book opened - notes, page markers, and obscene doodlings sailing into the air - and slammed against the wall, barely missing two girls at the water fountain. Ray looked up, his eyes wide and startled behind his glasses. He saw then that doom had finally come for him. a hand clenched the front of his shirt and lifted him up on the toes of his sneakers. \"Hey, fuckmeat,\" a slurred, thickly accented voice growled, \"you\u0027re in my way, man.\" The boy who\u0027d spoken was about sixty pounds heavier than his captive and stood more than four inches taller; he was a junior named Paco LeGrande, and he had bad teeth and acne pocks on a grinning, vulpine face. a tattooed rattlesnake crawled across one thick forearm. Paco\u0027s eyes were red and unfocused, and Ray knew the boy had been puffing a little too much weed in the bathroom this morning. He usually timed his visits to the locker so as to miss Paco, who had the one right next door, but the inevitable had caught up with him. Paco was fueled and high and ready to give somebody a nitro lesson. \"Hey, X Ray!\" another Hispanic boy was standing behind Paco. His name was Ruben Hermosa, and he was shorter and not nearly as heavy as Paco but his eyes were also aflame. \"Hey, don\u0027t shit in your pants, amigo!\" Ray heard his paisley shirt ripping. He was barely balanced on his toes, and his heart was pounding in his skinny chest but he kept his expression spaceman cool. Other kids were moving back, getting out of danger\u0027s way, and there wasn\u0027t a Renegade in sight. Paco balled up a tremendous, scarred fist. \"You don\u0027t want to break the rules, Paco,\" Ray said, as calmly as he could manage. \"No trouble in school, man.\" \"Fuck the rules! and fuck school! and fuck you, you little four-eyed piece of - \" a home economics book with a smiling cartoon family on its blue cover whacked into the side of Paco\u0027s head with a noise like a gunshot. The blow rocked him, and Ray wrenched free as Paco\u0027s grip weakened. He scrabbled across the green linoleum to the base of the water fountain. \"a wetback prick with no balls shouldn\u0027t talk about fuckin\u0027,\" a girl\u0027s smoky voice said. \"It\u0027ll give you ideas you can\u0027t do anything about.\" Ray knew that voice. Nasty stepped between him and the two Rattlers. She was a senior, and she stood almost six feet tall; her platinum-blond hair was swept back in a Mohawk, the sides shaven to the scalp. Nancy Slattery wore skintight khakis that clung to her rear and her long, strong legs; a hot-pink cotton shirt accentuated the flare of her athletic shoulders. She was lithe and quick, had run track last year for Preston High, and on both wrists she wore a handcuff for a bracelet. Three or four cheap gold chains sparkled around each ankle, above the size-seven bowling shoes she\u0027d swiped from the Bowl-a-Rama in Fort Stockton. Nasty had gotten her name from her initiation into the Renegades, Ray had heard; she\u0027d drunk down what was in a cup the guys had spat their tobacco chews into. and smiled through brown teeth. \"Get up, X Ray,\" Nasty told him. \"These fags won\u0027t bother you.\" \"You watch your mouth, bitch!\" Paco roared. \"I\u0027ll knock the piss outta you!\" Ray stood up, started gathering his notes together. He saw with a jolt of horror that his idle drawing of a huge penis attacking an equally huge vagina had slid under the right sandal of a blond junior fox named Melanie Paulin. \"I\u0027ll piss in a glass for you, Paco Fago,\" Nasty replied, and a few of the onlookers laughed. She just missed being pretty: her chin was a shade too sharp, her two front teeth were chipped, and her nose had been broken when she fell during a track meet. Her dark green eyes glowered under peroxided brows. But Ray thought Nasty, who sat a few seats away from him in study hall, was a smash fox. \"Come on, man!\" Ruben urged. \"We gotta get to class! Forget it!\" \"Yeah, Paco Fago. Better run \u0027fore you get spanked.\" She saw the flare of red in Paco\u0027s eyes and knew she\u0027d pushed too far, but she didn\u0027t give a shit; she thrived on the smell of danger like other girls desired Giorgio. \"Come on,\" she said, beckoning with one finger. Her nails were polished black. \"Come and get it, Paco Fago.\" Paco\u0027s face darkened like a storm cloud. He started toward her, both fists clenched. Ruben yelled, \"Don\u0027t, man!\" but it was much too late. \"Fight! Fight!\" somebody shouted, and Ray scooped up the incriminating drawing as Melanie Paulin backed away. He gave Nasty room; he\u0027d seen what she had done to a Mexican girl in a wild fight after school, and he had no doubt about what she was going to do now. Nasty waited. Paco was almost upon her. Nasty smiled slightly. Paco took one more step. One of Nasty\u0027s bowling shoes came up in a vicious kick with all of her hundred and sixteen pounds behind it. The shoe connected squarely with Paco\u0027s crotch, and afterward no one remembered which was louder: the sound of the shoe smacking home or Paco\u0027s garbled scream. Paco bent double, clutching at himself; in no hurry, Nasty grabbed his hair, crunched her knee up into his nose, and then slammed his face into the nearest locker door. Blood splattered, and Paco\u0027s knees buckled like wet cardboard. She helped him to the floor by kicking his feet out from under him. He lay stretched out, his nose a purple lump. It was all done in about five seconds. Ruben was already backing away from Nasty, his hands upraised in supplication. \"What\u0027s going on herei\" The onlookers scattered like chickens before a Mack truck. Mrs. Geppardo, a white-haired history teacher with cocked eyeballs, advanced on Nasty. \"My God!\" She drew up short when she saw the carnage. Paco was stirring now, trying dazedly to sit up. \"Who did thisi I want an answer right this minute!\" Nasty looked around; her sharp gaze struck everyone with deaf-dumb-and-blind disease, a common ailment at Preston High. \"Did you see this, young mani\" Mrs. Geppardo demanded of Ray, who instantly took off his glasses and began cleaning them on his shirt. \"Mr. Hermosa!\" she called shrilly, but he took off at a run. Nasty knew that by the end of fourth period every Rattler in school would have heard about this, and they wouldn\u0027t like it. Tough shit, she thought, and waited for Mrs. Geppardo\u0027s cock eyes to find her. \"Miss Slattery.\" She spoke the name as if it were something catching. \"I think you\u0027re at the bottom of this, young lady! I can read you like a book!\" \"Reallyi\" Nasty asked, all innocence. \"Then read this.\" She turned and bent over to show Mrs. Geppardo that her tight trousers had split along the rear seam - and Nasty, as Ray and everyone else saw, wore no underwear. He almost fainted. a roar of hellacious laughter and whooping filled the hallway. Ray fumbled with his glasses and almost dropped them. When he got them on, he could see the small butterfly tattoo on her right cheek. \"Oh... Lord!\" Mrs. Geppardo\u0027s face reddened like a chili pepper about to pop its pods. \"You straighten up this instant!\" Nasty obeyed, swiveling gracefully around like a fashion model. The entire hallway was now in chaos, as more students flooded out of the classrooms and teachers valiantly tried to stem the tide. Standing with his english book under his arm and his glasses on crooked, Ray wondered if Nasty would marry him for one night. \"You\u0027re going to the office right this minute!\" Mrs. Geppardo grabbed for Nasty\u0027s arm but the girl dodged her. \"No, I\u0027m not,\" Nasty said firmly. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 home and change pants, that\u0027s what I\u0027m gonna do.\" She stepped over Paco LeGrande with one long stride and walked purposefully to the doors of B Section, her cheeks hanging out and a chorus of howls and laughter following her. \"I\u0027ll suspend you! I\u0027ll put you on report!\" Mrs. Geppardo shook a vengeful finger. But Nasty stopped at the door and fixed the woman with a stare that would\u0027ve knocked a buzzard dead. \"No, you won\u0027t. It\u0027s too much trouble. anyhow, all I\u0027ve done is split my britches.\" She gave Ray a quick wink that made him feel like he\u0027d just been knighted by Guinevere, though her language was anything but courtly. \"Don\u0027t get shit on your shoes, boy,\" she told him, and went out the doors and into the light that glowed like molten gold in her Mohawk. \"You\u0027ll wind up in women\u0027s prison!\" Mrs. Geppardo sputtered - but the door was swinging shut, and Nasty was gone. She whirled on the gawkers: \"Get back to your rooms!\" The windows almost rattled in their frames. a half second later, the tardy bell rang and there was a new stampede. Ray felt drunk with lust. The image of Nasty\u0027s exposed rear might remain in his mind until he was ninety years old and rears didn\u0027t matter anymore. His rod was straining; it was something he had no control over, as if that part of himself held all the brains and the rest was just useless appendage. Sometimes he thought he\u0027d been zapped by an alien Sex Beam or something, because he just couldn\u0027t get it off his mind - though he was likely to be a virgin forever, judging how most girls reacted to him. Lord, it was a rough life! \"What are you standing there fori\" Mrs. Geppardo\u0027s face thrust into his. \"are you asleepi\" He didn\u0027t know which eye to look into. \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"Then get to wherever you\u0027re going! Now!\" He closed his locker, snapped the lock, and hurried off along the hall. But before he turned the corner he heard Mrs. Geppardo say, \"What\u0027s wrong with you, you hoodlumi Can\u0027t you walki\" Ray looked back. Paco was on his feet, his face gray; he was still clutching his groin, and he staggered toward the history teacher. \"We\u0027re going to see the nurse, young man.\" She took his arm. \"I\u0027ve never seen such a sight in all my - \" Paco suddenly lurched forward, and belched forth his breakfast onto the front of Mrs. Geppardo\u0027s flower-print dress. Ray ran, instinctively ducking his head as another scream shook the windows.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-8.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
