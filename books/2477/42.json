{"id":83399,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\"Maybe it didn\u0027t mean this place,\" Vance whispered shakily. \"Maybe it meant somewhere else.\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\" Rhodes spoke in a normal voice. There was no need for whispering, because Stinger had to know they were waiting in Creech\u0027s den. He aimed his flashlight at the hole in the floor. There was no movement, no sign of life - in whatever form - down in the darkness. \"What time is iti\" he asked Tom. \"almost twenty till two,\" Tom answered, checking his watch in the beam of his own flashlight. Jessie stood beside him, her hair in sweat-damp curls and a fine layer of dust on her face. Rhodes had asked them to come, to see what they were dealing with, but he\u0027d warned them not to say anything about Daufin. David Gunniston stood on the other side of the colonel, the younger man\u0027s face still ashen with shock but his eyes alert and his hand on the butt of the .45 he\u0027d taken from Vance\u0027s gun cabinet. Vance had a Winchester repeating rifle, and Rhodes held the shotgun loaded with tear-gas shells at his side. \"Bastard\u0027s making us wait,\" Rhodes said. They\u0027d been here for almost thirty minutes, long enough to drink the thermos of cold coffee they\u0027d gotten from Sue Mullinax at the Brandin\u0027 Iron. \"Trying to make us sweat a little.\" \"It\u0027s doing a damned good job,\" Jessie said as she wiped her face with her forearm. \"One thing I want to know: if Stinger\u0027s somehow making... what did you call themi\" \"Replicants.\" \"If Stinger\u0027s making replicants, what\u0027s happening to the real peoplei\" \"Killed, most likely. Maybe stored like lab specimens. I don\u0027t know.\" He glanced at her and managed a faint smile. \"We\u0027ll have to ask when it shows up.\" \"If it shows up.\" Vance had backed away from the hole, and stood pressed against the wall. His shirt stuck to him like glue-dipped wallpaper, and sweat dripped from his chin. \"Listen... if it looks like Dodge, I\u0027m gonna have to be excused. I don\u0027t think I can take that again.\" \"Just don\u0027t start blasting with that rifle. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027d do much good anyway.\" Rhodes kept rubbing the hand-shaped bruise on his arm. Vance snorted. \"Mister, it\u0027d do me a hell of a lot of good!\" \"Coloneli\" Gunniston bent down at the rim of the hole. \"Listen!\" They all heard it: a thick, wet sound, like boots slogging in a swamp. Something moving through the slime-walled tunnel, Rhodes knew. Coming closer. \"Get back,\" he told Gunny, and the younger man scrabbled away from the edge. Vance cocked the Winchester, and Rhodes darted a warning glance at him. The sounds stopped. Silence fell. Rhodes and Tom kept their lights aimed at the hole. From below, a man\u0027s voice drifted up: \"Put your lights out, folks. I\u0027m picking up some real bad vibes.\" It was a mellow, laid-back voice. No one recognized it but Vance, who had heard it often enough. His face bleached fishbelly gray, and his body mashed harder against the wall. \"Do it,\" Rhodes said. He turned off his flashlight, and so did Tom. Now the only illumination in the room was the dusty yellow glow of the remaining oil-burning lanterns. \"all right. You can come up now.\" \"Oh no. Not yet, pardner. Throw them down to me.\" It can\u0027t stand electric light, Rhodes thought. No, more than that: it\u0027s afraid of electric light. He tossed his flashlight into the hole and nodded for Gunniston and Tom to do the same. a moment later there came the snapping sounds of the flashlights being broken apart. \"That\u0027s it. You can come up,\" Rhodes said. \"I can come up anywhere and anytime I fucking please,\" the voice replied. \"Haven\u0027t you figured that out by nowi\" There was a pause. \"If you have any more of these up there, you\u0027ll be very sorry.\" \"Those are all we brought.\" \"They\u0027re little pieces of nothing anyway, aren\u0027t theyi I can break them with my breath.\" The voice was jaunty, confident now that the flashlights were destroyed. a quiet thud and a scuttling noise followed. Rhodes figured the thing had just leapt up and pulled itself into the basement. Then another thud, and one hand caught the edge of the hole. Saw-blade fingernails gouged into the broken wood, and the creature\u0027s head rose into view. Jessie gripped Tom\u0027s hand with a strength that popped his knuckles. Vance gave a feeble moan. It was Mack Cade\u0027s face, blue-eyed and smiling like a choirboy. He was hatless, his thin blond hair plastered to his skull. His tan had faded to a sickly yellow hue. He pulled himself up with one-armed ease, got his knees on the hole\u0027s edge, and stood up. Vance almost passed out, and the only reason he did not was the knowledge that he would be unconscious on the floor with that god-awful thing standing ten feet away. \"Oh... Jesus,\" Gunniston whispered. \"everybody stay where you are,\" Rhodes said, as calmly as he could. He swallowed; his insides had given a savage twist. \"Just take it easy.\" \"Yeah,\" the creature with Mack Cade\u0027s smile said. \"Hang loose.\" In the lamplight, they all could see it much too clearly. Mack Cade had a left arm, but his right one was squashed and melted into something that had grown from his chest. It was a black-streaked lump of meat with a flat, almost reptilian head on a squat and muscular neck. In that head were slanted amber eyes, and two stubby, deformed legs dangled from the bony wedges of its shoulders. Jessie knew what it was: a dog. One of Cade\u0027s Dobermans, implanted in the thing\u0027s chest like a bizarre Siamese twin. The gold chains around Cade\u0027s neck were now part of his flesh too, braided in and out of his skin. The cold blue eyes moved slowly from one figure to the next. The dog\u0027s head, splotched with patterns of human flesh and Doberman hide, writhed as if in profound agony, and around the lump of its body the folds of Cade\u0027s wine-red shirt crackled like waxy paper. \"Wow,\" the Cade mouth said, and lamplight sparked off the close-packed rows of needle teeth. \"You came to party, didn\u0027t you, ed Vancei\" The thing\u0027s gaze speared him. \"I thought you were the head honcho.\" Vance couldn\u0027t speak. Rhodes took a deep breath and said, \"He\u0027s not. I am.\" \"Yeahi\" The eyes fixed on him. The dog\u0027s mouth stretched open and showed more silver needles. On each paw were two serrated metal hooks. The creature took two strides toward Rhodes, and the colonel felt panic rise up like a scream but he locked his knees and did not retreat. Stinger stopped about three feet away. The eyes narrowed. \"You. I know you, don\u0027t Ii\" The squashed Doberman\u0027s head made a low groan, and the jaws snapped wantonly. \"You\u0027re Colonel Matt Rhodes United States air Force. Righti\" \"Yes.\" \"I remember you. We met before, down there.\" a jerk of the head toward the hole. Still smiling, Stinger lifted its left arm and extended the index finger. The arm glided forward, and the metal nail pressed against Rhodes\u0027s cheek. \"You hurt me,\" Stinger said. There was a quiet click as Gunniston eased back the .45\u0027s hammer. \"Hold your fire.\" The saw-blade edge had cut his cheek, and a drop of blood coursed slowly down to his jawline. He met Stinger\u0027s intense stare without flinching. The thing was talking about the old woman down in the tunnel. Wherever the true Stinger was - most likely in the pyramid - it must have a direct sensory bond with the replicants, including reaction to pain. \"We came here in good faith,\" Rhodes said. \"What do you wanti\" \"I want to deal.\" Rhodes knew what Stinger meant, but he wanted it spelled out. \"Deal for whati\" \"The superfine, high-quality, grade-double-a package you\u0027ve got stashed somewhere in this joint.\" The fingernail withdrew, taking a smear of human blood with it. \"You know: the guardian. The little girl.\" Jessie\u0027s heart kicked. Vance shivered; the thing had Cade\u0027s slick salesman\u0027s drawl down to perfection. \"What little girli\" The drop of blood fell from Rhodes\u0027s chin and hit the green scrub shirt with a soft plop. \"Don\u0027t shit me, amigo.\" The dog\u0027s head growled hoarsely, its neck straining. \"I\u0027ve been... like... asking around, if you get my drift. Kicking back, seeing the sights. You\u0027ve got a real trippy world here, dude. But I know the guardian\u0027s a little girl, and I know she\u0027s somewhere close. I want her, and I mean to take her. So do we deal or noti\" Rhodes knew dangerous ground lay ahead. He said, carefully, \"Maybe we know who you\u0027re talking about and maybe we don\u0027t. If we do, what do we get from the deali\" \"You get to keep your asses,\" Stinger said, the eyes bright - almost merry - with the prospect of violence. \"That clear enoughi\" \"You\u0027ve already killed quite a few people. That\u0027s not good business.\" \"Sure it is. My business is squashing bugs.\" \"a professional killeri\" Rhodes\u0027s throat felt dry enough to crack. \"Is that what you arei\" \"Man, you people are dense! Ugly too.\" Stinger looked down at the twitching mass hanging from its chest. \"What is this shiti\" \"I\u0027d like to know where you came from,\" Rhodes pressed on. \"What planeti\" Stinger hesitated, the head cocked over to one side. \"The planet Moondoggie, in the constellation Beach Blanket Bingo,\" the thing said, and cackled. \"What the fuck does it matteri You wouldn\u0027t know where it is, anyway. Face it, man: I\u0027m not leaving without the guardian, so you might as well hand her over and let\u0027s be done with it.\" Jessie could stand being silent no longer. It was the wrong, stupid thing to do, and she knew that, but it burst out of her anyway: \"No! We\u0027re not giving her up to you!\" Rhodes twisted around and his stare burned holes through her. She got control of herself again, but the damage was done. The counterfeit Mack Cade face watched her impassively, while the dog\u0027s jaws snapped at the air as if ripping off hunks of fresh meat. Stinger said quietly, \"Now we\u0027ve got it clear who we\u0027re talking about, so we can quit dicking around. First off, I know my bounty\u0027s here. I tracked her ship to this world, and my sensors are picking up the pod\u0027s energy. exactly where it is, I\u0027m not sure - but I\u0027m narrowing it down, and I know she won\u0027t be too far from it.\" a metallic smile flashed. \"Technology\u0027s a great thing, huhi\" \"What do you mean, your \u0027bounty\u0027i\" Rhodes asked. \"are you being paid for thisi\" \" \u0027Paid\u0027 is a relative term, man. I\u0027m being rewarded for carrying out a mission.\" \"To find her and kill heri\" \"To find her and take her where she belongs. She - \" Stinger stopped, a grimace of annoyance rumpling the face. \"You don\u0027t know a damned thing, do youi This is like trying to talk to my asshole and expecting it to\" - there was a pause and a slow blink, and Rhodes could almost see the thing searching at mind-boggling speed through the man\u0027s language center for the correct analogy - \"sing like aretha Franklin. Man, this is primitive shit!\" \"Sorry we\u0027re so uncivilized,\" Rhodes said, \"but we\u0027re not invading other worlds trying to kidnap children, either.\" \"\u0027Invading,\u0027\" Stinger repeated after a few seconds of reflection. The eyelids had slid down to half mast. \"There\u0027s another relative term. Listen, I couldn\u0027t care less about this dump. I\u0027m just passing through. as soon as I get my prisoner, I\u0027m history.\" \"What makes her so importanti\" Tom spoke up, and the creature\u0027s head twisted toward him. \"I see the problem around here,\" Stinger announced. \"Too many chiefs and not enough ensigns... engines... Indians,\" the thing corrected itself. \"You ought to know \u0027she\u0027 isn\u0027t what you\u0027d call female. and she\u0027s not male, either. Where she comes from, that doesn\u0027t matter. all the screwing on her world\u0027s done by the tides or something. \u0027She\u0027 could just as easily take a man to be a guardian; the guardian\u0027s a shell for her to walk around in. But since I don\u0027t find any description of the creature in your lingo, I guess it\u0027s okay to call it a \u0027she.\u0027\" Stinger sneered the word. \"and for her to take a little girl as a guardian is a real laugh, because she\u0027s as old as dirt. But she\u0027s smart, I\u0027ll give her that much, and she\u0027s sure run me a chase.\" The thing\u0027s gaze slid back to Rhodes. \"It\u0027s over now: where is shei\" \"I never said we knew who you\u0027re talking about.\" Silence stretched, and the replicant\u0027s gray lips twitched like cankerworms. \"What you can\u0027t seem to figure out is that I\u0027m on the side of law and order. My assignment is to find the criminal and return her to a maximum-security penal world - from which she escaped. She got into a guard and stole a garbage scow. I figure the ship went haywire, sailed off course, and got sucked into the gravity field here. She must\u0027ve jettisoned her guardian and gotten back into her pod before the crash; she ejected, and that\u0027s the story.\" \"Not all of it,\" Rhodes said. He kept a poker face. \"Why is she a criminali\" \"after her planet was liberated, she decided to disobey the new prime directives. She started urging her kind to resistance, violence, and sabotage. She\u0027s nothing but a wild animal.\" \" \u0027Liberated\u0027i\" Jessie didn\u0027t like the sound of that. \"Liberated from whati\" \"From waste and stupidity. See, there\u0027s a natural chemical on her world that\u0027s poisonous as all hell anywhere else. What you folks don\u0027t know is that all kinds of little wars are going on out there - alliances breaking up, new ones forming, one group deciding it wants a planetary system and another kicking sand about it. Goes on all the time.\" The thing\u0027s shoulders shrugged. \"Well, suppose some up-and-comer decides to get hold of the poison and start spreading it around. I\u0027m telling you, the shit is deadly. That stuff gets out in space, and it might even drift this way. It cuts right through body armor and dissolves the bones and guts into mush. That\u0027s why we liberated the planet - so we can keep that shit from getting into the arsenals of fruitcakes. everything was going fine until \u0027she\u0027 started raising hell. Made herself out to be a \u0027revolutionary\u0027 and all that crap.\" The head shook back and forth, the face puckered with a scowl. \"She\u0027s trying to get back so she can stir up more trouble - maybe sell that poison to the highest bidder.\" Rhodes didn\u0027t know whether to buy the story or not. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell us this before nowi\" \"Because I didn\u0027t know anything about you. as far as I knew, you were helping her. everybody seemed like they\u0027d rather fight than talk like sensible folks.\" Stinger\u0027s eyes bored into Rhodes\u0027s. \"I\u0027m a forgiving kind of dude. Let\u0027s be friends. Okayi\" Just like Mack Cade would\u0027ve done it, Vance thought. Sucker \u0027em in with a glad hand and squash \u0027em with a fist. He found his voice, and he said, \"Coloneli I inkthay it ielays.\" Rhodes saw Stinger blink with incomprehension, saw the gears of language start turning behind the manufactured face; they slipped on the grease of pig Latin. I think it lies, Vance had said. \"explain,\" Stinger demanded, the metallic voice all business again. \"We\u0027ve got to talk about this. The others and myself.\" \"Nothing to talk about, man. either we deal or not.\" \"We need some time.\" Stinger didn\u0027t move, but the dog\u0027s head thrashed angrily. Seven or eight seconds crept past. Rhodes felt sweat trickling from his armpits. \"You dudes are playing games with my brain,\" the creature said. \"Trying to fuck me up.\" It advanced on Rhodes, and was right there in his face before he could back away. Gunniston lifted the .45 and aimed it at the monster\u0027s head, and Vance hefted the rifle up and put his finger on the trigger. \"You listen,\" Stinger hissed. The thing was breathing - its imitation lungs doing the job of the originals. The breath was a faint rumbling, like the noise of a blast furnace going at full burn miles distant, and the air from Stinger\u0027s mouth washed into Rhodes\u0027s face and reeked of hot plastic and metal. The dog\u0027s teeth snagged Rhodes\u0027s shirt. \"Playtime\u0027s over. I want the guardian and the pod.\" \"We need... more time,\" Rhodes said. If he retreated one step or otherwise flinched, he knew those saw-blade nails would be on his throat. \"We\u0027ll have to find her.\" \"I tried to be friendly, didn\u0027t Ii\" The index finger rose up and glided across his chin. \"You know, I create things. Out in my ship. I\u0027ve got a workshop in there. Just give me the flesh, and I can create... wonders.\" The smile came up again, and the needle teeth glittered inches away from the colonel\u0027s face. \"I\u0027ve seen one of your creations. The flying thing.\" \"Pretty, huhi If you\u0027d like to see my workshop, I could snatch you under my arm and take you there right now. I could make you over, better than you are. a lot stronger... and a lot meaner too.\" \"I\u0027m already mean enough.\" Stinger cackled; there was a sound like grind wheels turning in its throat. \"Maybe you are, at that,\" the creature agreed, and lifted its left wrist. embedded in the flesh was the diamond-studded face of a Rolex watch with a tiny inset second hand. \"I figure this is a tool to mark the passage of time. I\u0027ve been watching it work. What\u0027s the time right nowi\" Rhodes was silent. Stinger waited. \"Three minutes before two,\" the colonel said. \"Good boy. When that long spear rotates again, I\u0027ll be back here. If you don\u0027t have the guardian and the pod, I\u0027m going to create a real special bug squasher.\" \"That\u0027s only one hour! We can\u0027t find her in that short a time!\" \"It\u0027s all you\u0027ve got. You understand, Colonel Matt Rhodes United States air Forcei\" \"Yes,\" he answered, and felt doom settle on his shoulders like a cold shroud. \"One hour,\" Stinger said. The thing\u0027s head turned, and Stinger stared at Gunniston and the .45 the man aimed. \"Would you like to eat thati\" Gunniston\u0027s hand shook. Slowly he lowered the pistol. \"I think we understand each other now.\" Stinger walked to the edge of the hole and hesitated with one foot over empty space. The dog\u0027s eyes shone red in the lamplight. \"One hour,\" the voice emphasized. \"Think on these things.\" The replicant dropped into darkness. They heard it hit bottom, followed by the smack of its boots as it raced away through the tunnel\u0027s ooze. The noise faded, and Stinger was gone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-42.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
