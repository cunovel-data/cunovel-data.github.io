{"id":83402,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" Daufin said. \"Seal your external visualizers.\" \"Huhi\" Tom asked.\\n\\n \"Close your eyes.\" He did. and promptly opened them again. \"Is this... going to hurti\" \"Only me, because I\u0027ll see my home again.\" \"What are you going to doi\" Jessie\u0027s arm was tight, ready to pull away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to take you on a journey, backward through the inner eye. I want to answer your questions about why I\u0027m called a criminal. These things can\u0027t be told; they must be experienced.\" \"Wow!\" Nasty stepped forward, the light sparkling off the bits of golden glitter in her Mohawk. \"Can I... like... go with youi\" \"I\u0027m sorry, no,\" Daufin said. \"There\u0027s only room for two.\" She caught Nasty\u0027s wistful expression. \"Maybe some other time. Close your eyes,\" she repeated to Tom and Jessie, and they did. Cody came closer to watch, and his heart was beating hard but he didn\u0027t have a clue as to what was about to happen.\\n\\n Daufin\u0027s eyes shut. She waited, as the energy cells of her memory began to charge like complex batteries.\\n\\n Jessie feared that Stevie\u0027s body temperature was getting too high, and that the heat would damage her brain and organs. But Daufin had said that Stevie was safe, and she had to trust this creature or she would lose her mind. Still, the hand she held continued to heat up; Stevie\u0027s body could tolerate such a fever for more than a few minutes without breaking down.\\n\\n Tom said, \"I feel like we\u0027re getting ready to go play hide-and-see... damn!\" He jumped, because what had seemed like a thunderbolt had snapped along his spine. He opened his eyes but the light was a brutal shock, with a hard yellow-green underglow, and he shut them again.\\n\\n \"Tomi What is iti\" Jessie asked. To him her voice was a slow, underwater slur, and he thought, My brain\u0027s getting scrambled.\\n\\n \"Silence,\" Daufin whispered, and in her voice chimes echoed.\\n\\n Jessie kept her eyes closed, waiting for she didn\u0027t know what. Though the hand she held seethed with heat, cold currents were beginning to run through her arm and up her shoulder; an electrical power being generated within Stevie\u0027s body, steadily gaining strength and entering Jessie through the connection of flesh.\\n\\n The cold pulse had entered Tom\u0027s bones too, and he shivered. He thought he could no longer feel the floor beneath his feet; he seemed to be drifting, his body slowly skewing to right and left, held only by Daufin\u0027s grip. \"What\u0027s happen - \" He stopped speaking, because the harshness of his own voice, the alien quality of it, terrified him.\\n\\n Jessie had heard a hoarse grunt that may have been the semblance of a human voice. The cold had enfolded her, from scalp to toes, like a breeze from the Ice House on a blistering July day. another sensation was coming upon her: movement at a tremendous speed. She thought that if she could force her eyelids up, she might see the atoms in the wall in motion like patterns of static on a television screen and her own body moving so fast it found an opening between them and slipped through. There was no panic, only exhilaration. It was what she thought a night sky-dive might be like, freefalling through darkness except there was no up or down - just out, beyond what she knew of life.\\n\\n Something glinted on her left, on her right, above and below. Blurred points and clusters of light passing at incredible velocity. But her eyes were still closed - or at least she sensed they were. Stars, she realized. My God... I\u0027m in the middle of a universe!\\n\\n Tom had seen them too. Constellations wheeled across the heavens, ringed worlds luminous with distant sunlight, gas clouds rippling like the wings of manta rays.\\n\\n and then they were almost upon it: a world as white as a pearl, surrounded by six white moons that crossed each other\u0027s orbit with unerring precision. The planet loomed before them, citadels of clouds covering its surface and in their midst storms spinning with silent ferocity.\\n\\n Too fast! Jessie thought as the clouds came up at her. Too fast! We\u0027re going to - They pierced the clouds, descending through whirlwinds. a smell of ammonia filled Jessie\u0027s nostrils. There was another breath-stealing shock of cold, followed by utter darkness. They were still traveling at high speed, slanting downward. Warmth touched Tom and Jessie, chasing away the cold. The darkness lightened to royal blue, then a rich, aquatic blue-green. Silken liquid pressed at Tom\u0027s face, and claustrophobia gripped him. We\u0027re going to drown! he thought, and tried to pull free from Daufin\u0027s hand but her grip strengthened, would not release him. He wanted to thrash loose and get to the surface, but he realized he was still breathing just fine. We\u0027re not really in an alien ocean, he told himself as they continued down. This is a dream... we\u0027re still standing in the apartment building, back in Inferno... With an effort, he twisted his head to look at Daufin for reassurance.\\n\\n He was no longer holding the hand of a little girl.\\n\\n The hand was ghostly gray, as transparent as mist, with two slender fingers and a short, flattened thumb. It was a small thing that looked as fragile as blown glass, and attached to that hand was a stalk that trailed four or five feet to Daufin\u0027s real form.\\n\\n Beside Tom in the gliding aquamarine was a body shaped like a torpedo, perhaps eight feet in length and full of iridescence like trapped stars. More stalks - tough, tentaclelike arms - drifted with the motion of the liquid around them, each with a similar two-fingered, single-thumbed hand. The body ended in a thick flat paddle of muscle that effortlessly propelled them onward, and attached to a protrusion just short of the tail was a silver filament that linked the body with its small black sphere.\\n\\n electrical energy sparked through Daufin\u0027s translucent flesh. Organs were visible in there, anchored by a simple framework of gray cartilage. Tom looked at where he thought Daufin\u0027s head should be, and saw a curved knob with a sickle-shaped mouth and a trunklike appendage about two feet long. He could see one of the eyes: a yellow orb the size of a baseball, with a vertical green pupil. The eye cocked in his direction. There was peace in its gaze, a languid power. The head nodded, and Tom inhaled sharply at the sign of recognition; air filled his lungs instead of liquid. The ghostly, electric-charged fingers squeezed his hand, and another arm drifted up and touched Tom\u0027s shoulder in a gesture of comfort.\\n\\n Daufin took them deeper. Warm currents slid around their bodies and the light was growing stronger, as if this planet\u0027s sun lay at its center.\\n\\n Rising up from the depths like flickers of moving neon were more of Daufin\u0027s tribe. Jessie recoiled, felt Daufin\u0027s strong grip, and then she looked and saw Daufin as Tom had. Her first impulse was to pull away from the spindly hand, but she checked it. Of course Daufin was a different form; what else could she have expectedi Daufin was a creature designed for an oceanic world, even though the \"ocean\" might be composed of ammonia and nitrogen.\\n\\n The other creatures propelled themselves in joyous spirals, leaving phosphorescent wakes and their pods weaving at the ends of the tethers. They were oblivious to the human presence, but both Tom and Jessie knew that this was Daufin\u0027s memory - her inner eye - and they were only visitors here, the alien ghosts of the future. Hundreds of the creatures made a formation around Daufin, sailing with the precise movements of birds through untroubled air, and Jessie realized Daufin must be a leader of some kind to merit such an escort.\\n\\n Now the impressions of Daufin\u0027s world, filtered through her inner eye, came in rapid succession to Jessie and Tom: shimmering outlines of everest-sized mountains and deep valleys between them, huge orchards where rows of kelplike vegetation were tended, crevasses showing cracks of fierce white glare - a glimpse into the immense power source that lay at the heart of this world. The vermiform towers of a city - sloping, curved, and ridged shapes that resembled the intricacies of seashells - stood beyond the mountains, and thousands of Daufin\u0027s tribe moved in currents above their walls.\\n\\n Time shifted, or Daufin\u0027s memory skipped tracks. In a valley below was a miles-long chasm of white fire that shot up whiplashes of electricity. The tides had changed too; they were no longer gentle, but swirled with restless energy. Daufin began to roll over and over, still gripping Tom and Jessie, and underneath what might have been the throat a series of small gill-like flaps vibrated; from them issued a compelling chiming sound.\\n\\n In response came Daufin\u0027s tribe, struggling against the currents. They rolled like Daufin, and from the underside of their bodies emerged round pink nipples. Other shapes, also summoned by Daufin\u0027s song, rose from the valley\u0027s chasm; they were disk-shaped creatures, blue electrical impulses sparkling around their rims and at their centers a knot of pulsing fire. as Daufin\u0027s song continued, the new creatures began to attach themselves to the pink underbelly nipples. Dark fluids jetted, shimmering with iridescence. Wheels of creatures danced, rose, and fell in the turbulence. Three of them fixed to nipples on Daufin\u0027s belly, spasmed, and spun away like dead leaves. It was a mass mating ritual, Jessie realized; a ballet of life and death.\\n\\n another blink of time. Something was approaching from beyond. Something alien, and horribly cold.\\n\\n It arrowed through the sea with a chatter of circuits, expelled a black harpoon, and sped downward into the valley of fire. More came, following the first. The new arrivals were connected to long clear hoses that snaked up to the surface. Machinery began to grind and pumps hissed, and through the hoses were drawn hundreds of the disk-shaped creatures that lived at the center of Daufin\u0027s world.\\n\\n Down came more dark spears, more greedy hoses. The brutal harvest continued, suctioning up seed-giving creatures older than time itself, that were a vital part of the planet\u0027s power source. When the wild currents called Daufin and she sang again, there weren\u0027t enough seed-givers to impregnate even half the tribe; they were being harvested faster than the unknown creation processes of the planet could produce them.\\n\\n Daufin\u0027s inner eye revealed the first stirrings of fear, and with them the knowledge of balances in decay. and now a clear sign of crisis: the planet\u0027s central fires dimming, the great engine of light and warmth wearing itself out as it tried to manufacture more seed-givers to replace those being lost. Tom and Jessie saw the image of a peace mission - four of Daufin\u0027s tribe swimming the long distance to the surface, to communicate to the aliens above why the harvesting must stop. Time passed, and they did not return.\\n\\n Death had come. Daufin swam with her new calf amid the forest of hoses; her study of mathematics, used in the building of the tribe\u0027s cities, would allow her to calculate the time remaining from the number of seed-givers being suctioned up a single hose, but that was a statistic she didn\u0027t wish to know. The orchards, the city, the entire tribe - all had been sentenced to death by a cold executioner. The calf played innocently between the hoses, unaware of the terrible reality - and the sight of that blind innocence amid the carnage cracked something within Daufin, made her thrash and wail with anguish. aggression was evil, buried in the long-ago legends of a war that had evolved the tether and sphere as part of the tribe\u0027s natural defenses, but a chasm of fire had opened within Daufin and wild tides summoned her. Her wail became a song of rage, like the urgent tolling of alarm bells - and then her body hurtled forward, and her fingers gripped the nearest hose. Too strong to tear, which further enraged her. The sickle-slash mouth opened, and the flat teeth of a vegetarian clamped on the hose and ground into it. a shock of agony and shame coursed through her, but the song of rage powered her on; the hose ripped, and seed-givers spilled out, whirled around her, began to drift downward again into the valley. The next hose was easier, and the one after that easier still. a storm of seed-givers flowed from the tears.\\n\\n and through that storm Daufin saw two of the tribe, hovering, watching with a mixture of horror and reawakened purpose. They hesitated, on the verge of sacrilege, and as Daufin\u0027s song rose in intensity they propelled themselves forward and joined her task.\\n\\n a dark cloud approached from the city. adrift in the inner eye, Tom and Jessie saw it just as Daufin had: thousands of the tribe, responding to this almost-forgotten song. Many saw the violence and stayed back, unable to give themselves to aggression, but many more attacked the hoses in a frenzy. a timeshift: more machines and hoses streaked down from the surface, harpooning into the planet\u0027s heart, but swarms of Daufin\u0027s tribe followed as she sang - a turbulence of rage as raw as a scream.\\n\\n Finally, the battleground lay silent, and broken hoses drifted in the current.\\n\\n But the peace was short, the nightmare just beginning. a blink of the inner eye, and Tom and Jessie felt a vibration in their bones. From the surface\u0027s darkness descended four rotating metallic spheres; they roamed over the city, issuing sonic blasts like earth thunder magnified a millionfold. The walls and towers shivered and cracked, shock waves destroyed the towers, the city crumpled, and the bodies of dead and wounded spun in the debris. Daufin\u0027s calf was torn away from her; she reached for it, missed, saw the calf instinctively withdraw into its lifepod in a shimmer of contracting organs and flesh. The pod sailed away, mingling with hundreds of others buffeted in the savage tides. a piece of jagged wall flew out of the murk at Daufin. There was a crackling of energy, a shrinking of flesh and internals, the skin turned to smoke, the organs merged into a small ball of electrical impulses, and in the next instant there was nothing but the black sphere, hitting the fragment of wall and ricocheting away.\\n\\n a current took them - Daufin, Tom, and Jessie, bodiless and floating in an armored shell - and the darkness closed in. There was a rapid ascent, as if they were being hurled upward in an earth tornado. Something glimmered ahead: a blue webbing - a net, full of entrapped creatures from the upper regions, things that resembled fluorescent starfish, flat gasping membranes, and aquatics with eyes like golden lamps. The sphere hit it, was enfolded in the webbing. and hung there, along with the other helpless life. a thudding of machinery came from above. The net was being hauled up. The sphere broke the surface like a sheet of black glass, and in that realm between the ocean and the low white clouds spidery structures squatted like malignant growths. Nightmarish figures stood on them, watching the net come up. One of them reached out a talon, and gripped the pod.\\n\\n Daufin\u0027s inner eye cringed. The power of memory was not strong enough to hold her, and she fled.\\n\\n Stars swept past Jessie and Tom - an outward journey, away from Daufin\u0027s world. each had glimpses of hallucinatory scenes: massive, scuttling creatures with voices like doomsday trumpets; space machines bristling with weapons; a gargantuan pyramid with mottled yellow skin and two scarlet suns beating down on a tortured landscape; a floating cage and amber needles that punctured the pupils of Daufin\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n She moaned, and her hands opened.\\n\\n Tom and Jessie were grasped by an abrupt deceleration, as if they were aboard a high-speed elevator shrieking to the bottom of a mile-long shaft. Their insides seemed to squeeze with compression, their bones bending under gravity\u0027s iron weight. and then the stop came: a whisper instead of a crash.\\n\\n Tom lifted his eyelids. Three monsters with bony limbs and grotesque fleshy heads were standing before him. One of them opened a cavity full of blunt little nubs and grunted, \"Yu-hoke, Mstyr Hamyndi\" Jessie heard the guttural growl, and her eyes opened too. She was supported on unsteady stalks, the light was glary and hostile; she was about to topple, and as she cried out the sound daggered her brain. One of the aliens, a thing with a horrid angular face topped with coiled pale sprigs and a totem of some kind dangling from a flap on the side of its head, moved forward and caught her with snaky arms.\\n\\n She blinked, momentarily stunned. But the creature\u0027s face was changing, becoming less monstrous. Features - hair, ears, and arms - became familiar again, and then she could recognize Cody Lockett. Relief rushed through her, and her knees sagged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got you,\" Cody said. This time she could understand the words.\\n\\n Tom wavered on his feet, his palms pressed to his eye sockets. \"You okay, Mr. Hammondi\" Tank asked again. Tom\u0027s brain ached as if deeply bruised. He managed to nod. \"If you\u0027re gonna puke, you\u0027d better do it out the window,\" the boy advised.\\n\\n Tom lowered his hands. He squinted in the light and looked at the three Renegades; their faces were human again - or, in Tank\u0027s case, nearly so.\\n\\n \"I can stand by myself,\" Jessie said, and when Cody let her go, she sank wearily to her knees. She didn\u0027t know if all of herself had returned from the void yet, and maybe it never would. Cody offered to help her up, but she waved him off. \"I\u0027m all right. Just leave me alone for a minute.\" She looked to her side, into the face of her little girl.\\n\\n Tears had streamed down the cheeks. The eyes were tormented. \"Now you know me,\" Daufin said.\\n\\n Tom lifted his left wrist, had a few seconds of difficulty in deciphering the numerals, as if he\u0027d never seen such symbols before. It was two-nineteen. Their \"journey\" had taken less than three minutes.\\n\\n \"You two look sick!\" Nasty observed. \"What happenedi\" \"We got an education.\" Jessie tried to rise, but still wasn\u0027t ready. \"The chemical,\" she said to Daufin. \"It\u0027s reproductive fluid, isn\u0027t iti\" \"Yes.\" Daufin\u0027s gaze was impassive, and a final tear trickled slowly down her left cheek. \"What the House of Fists calls \u0027poison\u0027 is the same chemical that gives my tribe life.\" Jessie remembered the jetting of dark fluid during the mating ritual. The same chemical vital to the reproduction process on Daufin\u0027s world was a weapon of destruction for the House of Fists.\\n\\n \"I have to get home,\" Daufin said firmly. \"I don\u0027t know how many are still alive. I don\u0027t know if my own child still is. But I led them. Without me, they won\u0027t fight. They\u0027ll slip back into the dream of peace.\" She drew a long breath, and for a few seconds she allowed herself to feel the caress of the tides again, rising and falling. \"It was a dream that lasted too long,\" she said, \"but it was a wonderful dream.\" \"even if you could get home, how would you fight themi They\u0027d just keep coming, wouldn\u0027t theyi\" \"Yes, they would, but our world is a long way from theirs. We have to stop them from building a permanent base, and destroy everything of theirs we can. Their treasury isn\u0027t bottomless; they spend all they have on weapons. So there has to be a breaking point beyond which they can\u0027t go.\" \"That sounds like wishful thinking,\" Tom said.\\n\\n \"It is, unless I can get home to act on it. We know the planet. They don\u0027t. We can strike and hide in places they can\u0027t reach.\" Her eyes shone with a glint of steel again. \"The House of Fists has been studying me to find out why my body resists the \u0027poison.\u0027 I\u0027ve escaped Rock Seven before. This time they\u0027ll kill me. I can\u0027t give myself to Stinger - not yet. Do you understand thati\" \"We do. Colonel Rhodes might not.\" another glance at the wristwatch. \"Jessie, he\u0027s going to be waiting for us by now at the Brandin\u0027 Iron.\" \"Listen, I don\u0027t get all this,\" Cody said, \"but I believe one thing for sure: if we let Stinger take Daufin and leave here, that won\u0027t be the end of it. Like she said, he\u0027ll send those House of Fist sumbitches after us - and that won\u0027t be just Inferno in deep shit, man! That\u0027ll be the whole world!\" \"Maybe so, but we\u0027ve still got to let Rhodes know we\u0027ve found her.\" \"Tom\u0027s right,\" Jessie agreed. She stood up, still felt light-headed and stretched, and she had to lean against the table for support. \"We\u0027ll go get the colonel and bring him back here,\" she said to Daufin. \"He can help us figure out what to do.\" \"You two better stay here with her.\" Cody fished the Honda\u0027s keys out of his pocket. \"I\u0027ll go down to the Brandin\u0027 Iron and get him.\" \"Yeah, and I\u0027ve gotta go find my folks,\" Tank said. His camouflage-painted pickup truck, one headlight and the radiator grille smashed from its rude entry into the Warp Room, was in the parking lot. \"I ain\u0027t seen \u0027em since I left the clinic.\" \"Just stay in here and hang tight,\" Cody told Tom and Jessie. He left the apartment, and Nasty followed Tank to the door. She paused, looked at Daufin with something like admiration, and said, \"Bizarre!\" Then she strode after Tank, and the door closed behind her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stinger/page-45.html","bookId":2477,"book":{"id":2477,"title":"Stinger","description":"Storyline: In the remote Texas town of Inferno, a creature of evil beyond anything the world has ever encountered descends.
