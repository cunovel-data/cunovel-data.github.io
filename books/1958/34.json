Generally she wasn’t emotional at these reunions, and she didn’t want to give away her secret too quickly. Slowly Brand lowered her to the ground, but he didn’t release her. \"You missed me?\" \"Like crazy.\" \"You’re pale.\" His hand tenderly caressed her cheek. \"You haven’t been overdoing this volunteer work, have you?\" \"I love working with the Chaplain’s Office.\" \"That didn’t answer my question.\" \"Quit arguing and kindly kiss me.\" Brand was all too eager to comply, pulling her flush against him, his mouth greedy over hers. When he raised his head, his eyes were narrowed and questioning. \"Erin?\" \"Yes.\" She smiled saucily up at him. \"You’ve gained weight?\" \"Is that a question or a statement?\" He stepped back from her, and Erin watched as his gaze shifted from her swollen breasts to the slight swell of her smoothly rounded stomach. He splayed his fingers over the mound and stared at her as if he’d never seen a pregnant woman in his entire life. \"Yes, my darling, we’re pregnant.\" \"A baby,\" he whispered haltingly. \"But… you never said a word.\" \"I didn’t find out until after you’d left, and then I thought a pregnant wife would make a delightful surprise for your homecoming.\" \"A baby,\" he whispered a second time, and seemed to be struggling for words. He gently cupped her face in his hands and brushed the pads of his thumbs across the slick tears that streamed down her cheeks. \"I love you, Erin MacNamera Davis, more and more each day. Thank God you came to your senses and married me.\" Erin thanked God, too. Her husband’s large hand flattened across her abdomen as he brought her protectively into the circle of his arms. \"A baby,\" he whispered, as if he still couldn’t believe it was true. \"Our own navy brat,\" Erin added, just before their mouths merged.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-brat-navy-3/page-34.html","bookId":1958,"book":{"id":1958,"title":"Navy Brat (Navy #3)","description":"Storyline: Navy Brat (Navy Series #3) New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber will capture readers\u0027 hearts with the third title in her popular Navy series.\" After more than 12 years, Silhouette Books is proud to bring readers Debbie\u0027s greatly anticipated \"Navy\" stories once again.
