{"id":108274,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"So now James Bond paused before he replied to Major Townsend\u0027s question about how he could be of help. He looked at the Soft Man and then into the fire. He added up the accuracy of the description he had been given of Major Townsend\u0027s appearance, and before he said what he had been told to say, he gave Colonel Boris ninety out of a hundred. The big, friendly face, the wide-apart, pale-brown eyes, bracketed by the wrinkles of a million smiles, the military moustache, the rimless monocle dangling from a thin black cord, the brushed-back, thinning sandy hair, the immaculate double-breasted blue suit, stiff white collar and brigade tie--it was all there. But what Colonel Boris hadn\u0027t said was that the friendly eyes were as cold and steady as gunbarrels and that the lips were thin and scholarly.\\n\\n James Bond said patiently: “It\u0027s really quite simple. I\u0027m who I say I am. I\u0027m doing what I naturally would do, and that\u0027s report back to M.”\\n\\n “Quite. But you must realize”--a sympathetic smile-- “that you\u0027ve been out of contact for nearly a year. You\u0027ve been officially posted as \u0027missing believed killed.\u0027 Your obituary has even appeared in The Times, Have you any evidence of identity? I admit that you look very much like your photographs, but you must see that we have to be very sure before we pass you on up the ladder.”\\n\\n “A Miss Mary Goodnight was my secretary. She\u0027d recognize me all right. So would dozens of other people at H.Q.”\\n\\n “Miss Goodnight\u0027s been posted abroad. Can you give me a brief description of H.Q., just the main geography?”\\n\\n Bond did so.\\n\\n “Right. Now, who was a Miss Maria Freudenstadt?”\\n\\n “Was?”\\n\\n “Yes, she\u0027s dead.”\\n\\n “Thought she wouldn\u0027t last long. She was a double, working for K.G.B. Section One Hundred controlled her. I wouldn\u0027t get any thanks for telling you any more.”\\n\\n Major Townsend had been pruned with this very secret top question. He had been given the answer, more or less as Bond had put it. This was the clincher. This had to be James Bond. “Well, we\u0027re getting on fine. Now, it only remains to find out where you\u0027ve come from and where you\u0027ve been all these months and I won\u0027t keep you any longer.”\\n\\n “Sorry. I can only tell that to M. personally.”\\n\\n “I see.” Major Townsend put on a thoughtful expression. “Well, just let me make a telephone call or two and I\u0027ll see what can be done.” He got to his feet. “Seen today\u0027s Times?” He picked it up and handed it to Bond. It had been specially treated to give good prints. Bond took it. “Shan\u0027t be long.”\\n\\n Major Townsend shut the door behind him and went across the passage and through the door marked “A,” where he knew that “Mr. Robson” would be alone. “Sorry to bother you, Fred. Can I use your scrambler?” The chunky man behind the desk grunted through the stem of his pipe and remained bent over the midday Evening Standard racing news.\\n\\n Major Townsend picked up the green receiver and was put through to the laboratory. “Major Townsend speaking. Any comment?” He listened, carefully, said thank you, and got through to the Chief Security Officer at Headquarters. “Well, sir, I think it must be 007. Bit thinner than his photographs. I\u0027ll be giving you his prints as soon as he\u0027s gone. Wearing his usual rig--dark-blue single-breasted suit, white shirt, thin black knitted silk tie, black casuals-- but they all look brand-new. Raincoat bought yesterday from Burberry\u0027s. Got the Freudenstadt question right, but says he won\u0027t say anything about himself except to M. personally. But whoever he is, I don\u0027t like it much. He fluffed on his special cigarettes. He\u0027s got an odd sort of glazed, sort of faraway look, and the \u0027scope\u0027 shows that he\u0027s carrying a gun inhis right-hand coat pocket--curious sort of contraption, doesn\u0027t seem to have got a butt to it. I\u0027d say he\u0027s a sick man. I wouldn\u0027t personally recommend that M. should see him, but I wouldn\u0027t know how we\u0027re to get him to talk unless he does.” He paused. “Very good, sir. I\u0027ll stay by the telephone. I\u0027m on Mr. Robson\u0027s extension.”\\n\\n There was silence in the room. The two men didn\u0027t get on well together. Major Townsend gazed into the gas fire, wondering about the man next door. The telephone burred. “Yes, sir? Very good, sir. Would your secretary send along a car from the pool? Thank you, sir.”\\n\\n Bond was sitting in the same upright posture, The Times still unopened in his hand. Major Townsend said cheerfully, “Well, that\u0027s fixed. Message from M. that he\u0027s tremendously relieved you\u0027re all right and he\u0027ll be free in about half an hour. Car should be here in ten minutes or so. And the Chief of Staff says he hopes you\u0027ll be free for lunch afterwards.”\\n\\n James Bond smiled for the first time. It was a thin smile which didn\u0027t light up his eyes. He said, “That\u0027s very kind of nun. Would you tell him I\u0027m afraid I shan\u0027t be free.”\\n\\n 2 - Attentat!\\n\\n The Chief of Staff stood in front of M.\u0027s desk and said firmly, “I really wouldn\u0027t do it, sir. I can see him, or someone else can. I don\u0027t like the smell of it at all. I think 007\u0027s round the bend. There\u0027s no doubt it\u0027s him all right. The prints have just been confirmed by Chief of Security. And the pictures are all right--and the recording of his voice. But there are too many things that don\u0027t add up. This forged passport we found in his room at the Ritz, for instance. All right. So he wanted to come back into the country quietly. But it\u0027s too good a job. Typical K.G.B. sample. And the last entry is West Germany, day before yesterday. Why didn\u0027t he report to Station B or W? Both those Heads of Station are friends of his, particularly 016 in Berlin. And why didn\u0027t he go and have a look at his flat? He\u0027s got some sort of a housekeeper there, Scotswoman called May, who\u0027s always sworn he was still alive and has kept the place going on her savings. The Ritz is sort of stage Bond. And these new clothes. Why did he have to bother? Doesn\u0027t matter what he was wearing when he came in through Dover. Normal thing, if he was in rags, would have been to give me a ring--he had my home number-- and get me to fix him up. Have a few drinks and run over his story and then report here. Instead of that we\u0027ve got this typical penetration approach and Security worried as hell.”\\n\\n The Chief of Staff paused. He knew he wasn\u0027t getting through. As soon as he had begun, M. had swivelled his chair sideways and had remained, occasionally sucking at an unlighted pipe, gazing moodily out through the window at the jagged skyline of London. Obstinately, the Chief of Staff concluded, “Do you think you could leave this one to me, sir? I can get hold of Sir James Molony in no time and have 007 put into The Park for observation and treatment. It\u0027ll all be done very gently. V.I.P. handling and so on. I can say you\u0027ve been called to the Cabinet or something. Security says 007\u0027s looking a bit thin. Build him up. Convalescence and all that. That can be the excuse. If he cuts up rough, we can always give him some dope. He\u0027s a good friend of mine. He won\u0027t hold it against us. He obviously needs to be got back in the groove--if we can do it, that is.”\\n\\n M. slowly swivelled his chair round. He looked up at the tired, worried face that showed the strain of being the equivalent of Number Two in the Secret Service for ten years and more. M. smiled. \"Thank you, Chief of Staff. But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not as easy as all that. I sent 007 out on his last job to shake him out of his domestic worries. You remember how it all came about. Well, we had no idea that what seemed a fairly peaceful mission was going to end up in a pitched battle with Blofeld. Or that 007 was going to vanish off the face of the earth for a year. Now we\u0027ve got to know what happened during that year. And 007\u0027s quite right. I sent him out on that mission, and he\u0027s got every right to report back to me personally. I know 007. He\u0027s a stubborn fellow. If he says he won\u0027t tell anyone else, he\\n\\n won\u0027t. Of course I want to hear what happened to him. You\u0027ll listen in. Have a couple of good men at hand. If he turns rough, come and get him. As for his gun“--M. gestured vaguely at the ceiling--”I can look after that. Have you tested the damned thing?\"\\n\\n “Yes, sir. It works all right. But. . . .”\\n\\n M. held up a hand. “Sorry, Chief of Staff. It\u0027s an order.” A light winked on the intercom. “That\u0027ll be him. Send him straight in, would you?”\\n\\n “Very good, sir.” The Chief of Staff went out and closed the door.\\n\\n James Bond was standing smiling vaguely down at Miss Moneypenny. She looked distraught. When James Bond shifted his gaze and said “Hullo, Bill” he still wore the same distant smile. He didn\u0027t hold out his hand. Bill Tanner said, with a heartiness that rang with a terrible falsity in his ears, “Hullo, James. Long time no see.” At the same time, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Miss Money-penny give a quick, emphatic shake of the head. He looked her straight in the eyes. “M. would like to see 007 straight away.”\\n\\n Miss Moneypenny lied desperately: “You know M.\u0027s got a Chiefs of Staff meeting at the Cabinet Office in five minutes?”\\n\\n “Yes. He says you must somehow get him out of it.” The Chief of Staff turned to James Bond. “Okay, James. Go ahead. Sorry you can\u0027t manage lunch. Come and have a gossip after M.\u0027s finished with you.”\\n\\n Bond said, “That\u0027ll be fine.” He squared his shoulders and walked through the door over which the red light was already burning.\\n\\n Miss Moneypenny buried her face in her hands. “Oh, Bill!” she said desperately. “There\u0027s something wrong with him. I\u0027m frightened.”\\n\\n Bill Tanner said, “Take it easy, Penny. I\u0027m going to do what I can.” He walked quickly into his office and shut the door. He went over to his desk and pressed a switch. M.\u0027s voice came into the room: “Hullo, James. Wonderful to have you back. Take a seat and tell me all about it.”\\n\\n Bill Tanner picked up the office telephone and asked for Head of Security.\\n\\n James Bond took his usual place across the desk from M. A storm of memories whirled through his consciousness like badly cut film on a projector that had gone crazy. Bond closed his mind to the storm. He must concentrate on what he had to say, and do, and on nothing else.\\n\\n “I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s a lot I still can\u0027t remember, sir. I got a bang on the head”--he touched his right temple-- “somewhere along the line on that job you sent me to do in Japan . Then there\u0027s a blank until I got picked up by the police on the waterfront at Vladivostok . No idea how I got there. They roughed me up a bit and in the process I must have got another bang on the head because suddenly I remembered who I was and that I wasn\u0027t a Japanese fisherman which was what I thought I was. So then of course the police passed me on to the local branch of the K.G.B.--it\u0027s a big grey building on the Morskaya Ulitsa facing the harbour near the railway station, by the way--and when they belinographed my prints to Moscow there was a lot of excitement and they flew me there from the military airfield just north of the town at Vtoraya Rechka and spent weeks interrogating me--or trying to, rather, because I couldn\u0027t remember anything except when they prompted me with something they knew themselves and then I could give them a few hazy details to add to their knowledge. Very frustrating for them.”\\n\\n “Very,” commented M. A small frown had gathered between his eyes. “And you told them everything you could? Wasn\u0027t that rather, er, generous of you?”\\n\\n “They were very nice to me in every way, sir. It seemed the least I could do. There was this Institute place in Leningrad . They gave me V.I.P. treatment. Top brain specialists and everything. They didn\u0027t seem to hold it against me that I\u0027d been working against them for most of my life. And other people came and talked to me very reasonably about the political situation and so forth. The need for East and West to work together for world peace. They made clear a lot of things that hadn\u0027t occurred to me before. They quite convinced me.” Bond looked obstinately across the table into the clear blue sailor\u0027s eyes that now held a red spark of anger. “I don\u0027t suppose you understand what I mean, sir. You\u0027ve been making war against someone or other all your life. You\u0027re doing so at this moment. And for most of my adult life you\u0027ve used me as a tool. Fortunately that\u0027s all over now.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-man-with-the-golden-gun-james-bond-13/page-2.html","bookId":1555,"book":{"id":1555,"title":"The Man With the Golden Gun (James Bond #13)","description":"Storyline: The Man With the Golden Gun (James Bond (Original Series) #13) \\n A brainwashed James Bond has tried—and failed—to assassinate M, his boss.
