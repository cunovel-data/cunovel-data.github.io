I’m a bad risk,” Jane said.\n “You should stay alive just to spite your brother,” Sam said.\n “I plan to,” she replied, smiling. “So, you see, Olivia, my family is as wacked as yours.”\n “I don’t think so,” Olivia argued. “I could tell you stories that would turn your hair gray.”\n “We don’t have any hair, remember? The wonder drugs made it all fall out,” Sam said.\n “We were already bald from the chemo when we got here,” Collins reminded them. She gently brushed her fingertips across her bare forehead as though sweeping a stray lock into place. Exaggerating the lilt of her Southern accent, she said, “So you’re going to have to take my word when I tell you I had the most fabulous blond hair.”\n “You, Olivia, and Sam could all be movie stars,” Jane said.\n “So could you,” Olivia countered.\n “I’m so thin and pale. I have these dark circles under my eyes and—”\n Olivia wouldn’t let her continue. “The medicine has just been rougher on you than the rest of us. When it’s over, you’ll see your beautiful self again.”\n Jane wasn’t convinced. “But Collins has blond hair and blue eyes—”\n “Fabulous blond hair,” Collins interrupted, smiling.\n Jane rolled her eyes, then continued on. “Olivia, your eyes are such an intense, brilliant color of blue, so I’m guessing your hair is blond, too.”\n “Nope,” she said. “Dark auburn,” she corrected. “You’ve got pretty hazel eyes, I’ll bet your hair is light brown, Jane.”\n “You’re right.”\n “Sam, you’re the easy one,” Collins said. “Your eyes are green, so I think you’re a natural redhead.”\n “I used to have dark brown hair, almost black,” she said.\n “When this is over . . . if we make it . . .” Jane began.\n “We’ll make it.” Olivia’s voice was emphatic.\n “I’m not ready to die yet,” Sam said.\n “Neither am I,” Collins whispered. “I have too much living to do, and I haven’t even gotten started.”\n “But will you three still be my best friends?” Tears sprang into Jane’s sunken eyes. There was no question that she was the most frail member of the group. Her pale skin looked almost translucent. Her voice was weak as she added, “No matter where we end up, no matter what we’re doing . . . okay?”\n “Absolutely,” the others responded.\n They made fists and gently tapped one another’s knuckles to seal the promise.\n “Friends forever,” Sam whispered.\n Olivia nodded. “Till death do us part.”\n ONE\n TWELVE YEARS LATER\n Olivia MacKenzie was certain she would have been offered the job if she hadn’t punched the boss during the interview. But knocking the man senseless turned out to be a real deal breaker.\n The CEO of one of the largest investment firms in the country, Eric Jorguson, was now being questioned by an FBI agent. He wasn’t cooperating. The agent had taken Jorguson to the opposite side of the terrace and was trying to get him to calm down and answer his questions. Jorguson was busy screaming at Olivia, threatening to have her killed and also to sue her because she’d broken his jaw. She hadn’t done any such thing, of course. The man was exaggerating. She’d smashed his nose in, not his jaw. A waiter wearing the name tag TERRY pinned to his black vest stood next to her trying to soothe what he referred to as her extreme case of nerves. She wanted to punch him, too.\n “You’re in shock,” he told her. “That’s why you look so calm. The guy tears your dress and gropes you, and it’s only natural for you to go into shock. Don’t you think? That’s why you’re not crying and carrying on.”\n Olivia looked at him. “I’m fine, really.” Now please leave me alone, she silently added.\n “Hey, look,” Terry said. “They’re arresting Jorguson’s bodyguard. What’s the guy doing with a bodyguard, I wonder.” A few seconds later he answered his own question. “He must need one. Especially if he attacks other women the way he attacked you. You think you’d like to go out with me sometime?”\n She smiled to ease the rejection. “I don’t think so.”\n “You’re still in shock, aren’t you?”\n Olivia was angry, not hysterical. She stood by the table with her arms folded across her waist as she patiently waited for the FBI agent to get to her. She had been told it wouldn’t take long.\n Terry tried twice more to engage her in conversation. She was polite but firm each time he attempted to get personal.\n She watched the agents while she tried to figure out how she had gotten into this bizarre situation. Job hunting wasn’t supposed to be dangerous. She had already interviewed with three other Fortune 500 companies without incident. Before she had gone to those interviews, however, she had done quite a bit of research. She didn’t have that luxury with Jorguson Investments. Because the position had just become available, she’d had less than a day to study the company’s prospectus. She should have looked more closely before she agreed to the preliminary interview. Should have, could have, she lamented.\n She hated job hunting and all the inane interviews, especially since she really liked her current job and the people she worked with. But there was talk of cutbacks. Serious talk, and according to some of the other employees, Olivia didn’t have seniority. She would be one of the first laid off. It was important to her that she stay in her current job until she accomplished what she had set out to do, but it didn’t look like that was going to happen. The only constant in Olivia’s life right now was the mortgage. It had to be paid, no matter what, which was why she had to have job options.\n She had gone to the office an hour earlier than usual this morning, finished two case files by noon, and headed over to Seraphina, a lovely restaurant with a stunning view. The five-star restaurant overlooked a manicured terrace, with tables strategically placed under a canopy of tree branches. Beyond was the river. Lunch was going to be a treat. She’d never dined at Seraphina because of the expense, but she’d heard that the food was wonderful. Grossly overpriced, but wonderful. No peanut butter and jelly sandwich today.\n The hostess showed her to a table on the south side of the terrace. It was such a beautiful day with just a slight nip in the air, perfect for lunch outside.\n The preliminary interview with Xavier Cannon, the company’s lead attorney, had gone well, she thought, but he hadn’t answered some of her more pressing questions and had suggested instead that she ask Jorguson. Cannon also mentioned that, if Jorguson liked her, he would offer her the job during lunch.\n Jorguson was waiting for her. She spotted him across the busy terrace. He held an open folder in his hand and was reading a paper inside it. As she drew closer she could see that it was her résumé.\n For about twenty seconds she thought he was quite a charmer and a rather distinguished-looking man. He was tall and thin and had a bright, white smile.\n He stood and shook her hand. “Bring the lady a drink,” he snapped impatiently to a passing waiter.\n “Iced tea, please,” she said.\n The waiter had already moved her chair for her, and she sat before Jorguson could come around the table to assist her.\n Jorguson’s cell phone rang, and without offering an apology or an excuse for the interruption, he turned his back to her and answered. His voice was low and angry. Whoever he was talking to was getting a dressing-down. His vocabulary was crude.\n So much for charming, she thought. She tried to focus on her surroundings while she waited. The linen tablecloth draped all the way to the ground, and in the center of the round table was a crystal bowl of fresh-cut flowers in every color. She looked around her and smiled. It was a really pretty day.\n Jorguson finished his call. He slipped the phone into his suit jacket and gave her his full attention, but the way he was staring at her quickly made her uncomfortable. She was about to ask him if something was wrong when he said, “You’re stunning. Absolutely stunning.”\n “Excuse me?”\n “You’re very beautiful,” he said then. “Xavier mentioned how pretty you were, but I still didn’t expect . . . that is to say, I wasn’t prepared . . .”\n Olivia was horrified by his close scrutiny. His leering inspection made her skin crawl. Jorguson wasn’t just unprofessional; he was also creepy. She opened her linen napkin and placed it in her lap. She tried to turn his attention so he would stop gawking at her.\n Typically she would have waited for him to lead the questioning, but the awkward silence and his inappropriate behavior compelled her to speak first.\n “This morning I had a few minutes, and I pulled up your prospectus. Your company is quite impressive,” she said. “But there was a note that last year you were investigated by the FBI—”\n He rudely cut her off with a wave of his hand. “Yes, but of course nothing came of it. It was simple harassment.” He continued, “They didn’t like some of my clients and wanted to make trouble, which was ridiculous. I should have sued, but I didn’t have the time.”\n Sue the FBI? Was he serious or just trying to impress her with his power. His arrogance was overwhelming.\n “You’re a brand-new attorney, aren’t you?” he asked.\n “Yes, that’s correct.”\n “Only two people ranked higher than you on the bar. I cannot tell you how remarkable that is. Still, you don’t have much experience with contracts.”\n “No, I don’t,” she agreed. “How did you find out about my scores? That’s confidential—”\n He waved his hand in the air again, dismissing her question. The gesture irritated her. She admitted then that pretty much everything about the man irritated her.\n “There were quite a few others who applied for the position, and most of them have more experience than you, but when I discovered you were Robert MacKenzie’s daughter, I moved you to the top of the list.”\n “You know my father?” She couldn’t hide her surprise.\n “Everyone who’s anyone knows who your father is,” he replied. “I know people who have invested in your father’s Trinity Fund and have made a handsome profit. Very impressive,” he stated with a nod. “I’m considering adding the fund to my own portfolio. No one plays the market like your father does. He seems to have a knack for choosing the right investments. If you’re half as clever as he is, you’ll go far, young lady.”\n Olivia wasn’t given time to respond. He’d already moved on. “You’ll be wonderful working with our clients. With that smile of yours, you could get them to sign anything. Oh yes, they’ll be as dazzled by you as I am,” he gushed. “And I have several powerful clients. Xavier will guide you. Now then, what questions do you have for me? I have a potential client meeting me here at one, so this will have to be a quick lunch.”\n “Did the SEC investigate when—”\n He interrupted. “No, the SEC will never investigate me,” he boasted. “I’m protected there.”\n “You’re protected? How?”\n “I have a friend, and he has assured me . . .”\n Her eyes widened. “You have a friend at the Securities and Exchange Commission?”\n Color crept up his neck. His eyes darted to the left, then to the right. Was he checking to make sure no one was listening to the conversation?\n He leaned into the table and lowered his voice. “I don’t have any worries there. As I just said, I won’t be investigated, and since you’re going to be working closely with me, I don’t want you to be concerned.”\n Working closely with him? That thought made her cringe.\n “About this friend . . .” she began.\n “No more questions about the SEC,” he snapped. He wasn’t looking into her eyes now. He was staring at her chest. The longer he stared, the more indignant she became. She considered snapping her fingers several times in front of his eyes to get his attention but, wanting to remain composed and professional, decided to ask a question about the investments he’d made.\n Jorguson was slick; she’d give him that much. He danced around each question but never really gave her any satisfactory answers.\n The topic eventually returned to the SEC. “Who is your contact?” she asked, wondering if he would tell her. He was so smug and arrogant, she thought there was a good chance he might. She also wanted him to assure her that everything he did was legal, and she thought it was odd that he hadn’t offered any such affirmation.\n “Why do you want to know? That’s confidential information.”\n He was staring at her chest again. She folded her napkin, smiled at Terry the waiter when he placed her iced tea in front of her, and handed him her menu.\n “I won’t be staying for lunch.”\n The waiter hesitated, then took her menu, glanced at Jorguson, and walked away.\n Olivia was disheartened. The salary at Jorguson Investments was good, really good, but it had taken less than five minutes to know she couldn’t work for this man.\n What a waste of time, she thought. And money. She could have worn one of her old suits, but she’d wanted to stand out, so she bought a new dress. It was expensive, too. She loved the fit and the color, a deep emerald-green silk. It had a high V-neck, so there was no need to wear a necklace. Diamond stud earrings, which were so tiny you could barely see the sparkle, and a watch were her only jewelry. She wore her hair down around her shoulders and had taken the time to use a curling iron.\n Olivia looked at Jorguson. The degenerate was still staring at her chest. And for this she had curled her hair?\n “This isn’t going to work,” she said.\n She tried to stand. Jorguson suddenly bolted upright, grabbed the top of her dress, and ripped it apart. The silk material tore, exposing her collarbone and part of her black bra.\n Appalled, she slapped Jorguson’s hands away. “What do you think—”\n “Are you wearing a wire? You are, aren’t you? That’s why you asked me who my contact was. That investigation stalled, sweetheart. It’s not going anywhere. The FBI’s been after me for two years now, and they’ve got nothing. I know for a fact they’re following me. They won’t ever get anything on me. They like to go after successful entrepreneurs. I’m an honest businessman,” he shouted into her chest. “Now where’s the damn wire? I know it’s in there somewhere.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sweet-talk-buchanan-renard-10/page-2.html","bookId":1827,"book":{"id":1827,"title":"Sweet Talk (Buchanan-Renard #10)","description":"Storyline: \n Attorney and IRS agent Olivia Mackenzie is the kind of tough, wise-cracking, powerful woman fans expect from a Garwood protagonist—but this time she has outdone herself.
