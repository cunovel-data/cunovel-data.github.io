{"id":93287,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Marisa returned to the carnival the following Monday evening after work, hoping that by seeing the vampire again, by assuring herself that it was still there, she would somehow be freed of the nightmares that had been plaguing her dreams for the past three nights. Why she thought seeing the creature again would put an end to her bad dreams instead of causing more remained unclear as she parked her car on a side street and ran through the light drizzle that had started falling at sundown.\n She paused when she reached the lot, surprised to see that the food booths were gone. Several of the rides had been dismantled; in the distance, she could see three men taking down the Ferris wheel. Another man was trying to load a skittish horse into a trailer. No one paid her any attention.\n The ticket-taker\u0027s booth was empty. A black-and-white sign was propped in front of the window. It read:\n CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE\n For a moment, she stared at the sign; then, glancing around to make sure no one was watching, she ducked into the big tent. It was empty. She could hear her heart pounding in her ears as she approached the smaller tent.\n Taking a deep breath, she stepped inside.\n This tent was empty, too. The dais stood in the center of the floor, but the ebony coffin was nowhere to be seen.\n \"May I help you?\"\n The sound of a woman\u0027s voice startled her. Whirling around, Marisa recognized the girl she had seen on Friday. The girl had been wearing a short red skirt, ballerina slippers, an off-the-shoulder blouse, and long, dangling red earrings then. Today, she looked as though she had just returned from a funeral. The severe black dress made her look older than her years. She wore a black scarf over her hair. A filigreed silver crucifix hung from a thick silver chain around her neck. Wide silver bracelets adorned both wrists.\n \"I came to see the vampire.\"\n The girl frowned at her a moment. Her eyes were red, as if she had been crying.\n \"Ah, yes,\" she said, \"you were here on All Hallow\u0027s Eve, weren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes.\" Marisa glanced at the center of the tent where the coffin had been. \"Where is it?\"\n The girl looked around the tent, her fingers worrying the crucifix.\n Was she imagining it, Marisa wondered, or did the girl\u0027s movements seem furtive, fearful?\n \"Is something wrong?\" Marisa asked.\n \"What? Oh, no. I regret the... the count is no longer available for viewing.\"\n \"No longer available? Why not?\"\n The girl hesitated before answering, and Marisa had the distinct impression that she was choosing her words with great care. \"The body is being... restored.\"\n \"I see,\" Marisa said. \"Do you know when he... when it will be finished?\"\n The girl\u0027s hand tightened over the cross. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I couldn\u0027t say.\"\n \"Is Silvano here?\"\n The girl looked at Marisa sharply; then, expelling a deep, shuddering sigh, she shook her head.\n \"It looks like you\u0027re packing up.\"\n \"Yes, I\u0027m afraid unexpected business has called us away. I\u0027m sorry you made the trip out here for nothing. Good evening to you.\"\n \"Yes, good night.\"\n Marisa watched the girl leave, then walked to the center of the tent and stared at the empty platform. The girl had said the body was being \"restored.\" What, exactly, did that mean? How did one go about \"restoring\" a body that wasn\u0027t quite dead?\n She felt a sudden coldness at the base of her neck, an eerie sensation that she was no longer alone. She glanced at the doorway, thinking the girl had returned, but there was no one there.\n \"You came to see the vampyre?\"\n Marisa whirled around, her heart leaping into her throat. \"Good Lord, you startled me!\" She stared at the stranger, wondering how he had gotten into the tent. She had been facing the doorway. Surely she would have seen him come in. He was not a man who would pass unnoticed.\n His long black hair was wet from the rain. His brows were thick and straight. He was tall and broad shouldered, with the trim build of an athlete, yet his skin was pale, as if he didn\u0027t spend much time in the sun. He wore a bulky gray sweater; tight black jeans hugged his long legs. There was mud on his boots.\n \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to frighten you.\"\n His voice was low and deep, and it slid over her skin like warm satin.\n \"That\u0027s all right.\"\n He glanced at the place where the coffin had been and she saw a muscle twitch in his jaw. And then, like a wolf sniffing the air, he lifted his head, his nostrils flaring.\n Marisa shivered as his eyes met hers, deep black eyes that seemed to probe the very depths of her heart and soul. The devil would have eyes like that. The thought came out of nowhere.\n \"Did you come to see it, too?\" she asked. \"The vampire, I mean?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n She took a step backward, uncomfortable standing so close to him without knowing why. \"They told me it\u0027s being restored, whatever that means.\"\n A smile so faint she wasn\u0027t sure it even qualified as a smile touched his lips. Full, sensuous lips. \"Is that what they said?\"\n Marisa nodded, enchanted by his voice. Never had she heard anything like it: low, mellifluous. An angel\u0027s voice.\n Grigori studied the woman for a moment, noting that she was quite lovely. Her shoulder-length hair was dark brown with a slight curl; her eyes were bright and green, like fine-quality emeralds. Her lips were finely sculpted, warm and generous.\n Inviting. A pink sweater and faded black Levi\u0027s revealed a petite figure with softly rounded curves in all the right places.\n \"And do you believe in vampyres?\" he asked.\n \"Of course not. He was probably just some old guy they hired for a few days.\" Yes, she thought, that was it.\n \"Yet you came back. I wonder why.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\" She met his gaze, a challenge in her eyes. \"You don\u0027t look much like a man who believes in vampires and things that go bump in the night, either, but you\u0027re here.\"\n He lifted one black brow. \"Indeed? You would be surprised by what I believe in.\"\n \"No doubt,\" Marisa retorted. \"Well...\" She settled her handbag on her shoulder. \"Good night.\"\n He stared after her a moment, watching the gentle sway of her hips as she exited the tent. Then, remembering his reason for being there, he crossed the floor and delved through the trash can until he found a wadded-up handkerchief. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, a quiver of longing running through him as he inhaled the scent of blood.\n His eyelids flew open as he recognized the scent. It was the woman\u0027s blood that stained the cloth.\n Shoving the handkerchief into his back pocket, he hurried after her.\n Standing in the rain, he watched her climb behind the wheel of a late-model Honda Prelude. And then, hands shoved into the pockets of his jeans, oblivious to the lightning that split the clouds, he followed her home.\n Marisa took a long, hot shower, sprinkled herself liberally with dusting powder, then pulled on a pair of stretch jeans, a sweatshirt, and a pair of thick socks and curled up on the sofa. She nipped through the TV channels for a minute, then switched off the set. Reaching for a book, she tried to read, but after she found herself reading the same page for the fourth time, she tossed the book aside.\n Too restless to sit still, she went into the kitchen to fix something to eat and then, on a whim, decided to go out instead.\n She pulled on a pair of boots, and then, grabbing her purse and an umbrella, she left the house. The rain was no more than a fine mist now, though the clouds still hung dark and ominous in the sky. She contemplated taking her car, but decided a walk in the fresh air would do her good.\n Angelo\u0027s was her favorite restaurant, a cozy little Italian place with red-checked tablecloths, candles in old Chianti bottles, and a relaxed atmosphere. It was located a couple of blocks away, and Marisa went there often. The owners were friendly and the spaghetti couldn\u0027t be beat.\n Standing under the restaurant\u0027s awning, Marisa shook the rain from her umbrella, then went inside and took a seat at a booth in the back. She smiled at the waiter who handed her a menu.\n She was trying to decide whether to have rigatoni or ravioli when she realized she was being watched.\n Lowering the menu, Marisa glanced around the restaurant, felt her heart catch in her throat as she saw the dark-haired man from the carnival walking toward her.\n He smiled as he reached her table. \"Hello again.\"\n \"What are you doing here?\"\n \"Seeking company on a stormy night, perhaps. I see you are alone. Would you mind if I joined you?\"\n Of course she\u0027d mind. She didn\u0027t know a thing about the guy, not even his name.\n The prudent thing would be to tell him to get lost. She knew that. Still, for no reason she could think of, she found herself inviting him to sit down.\n Graceful as a leaf falling from a tree, he slid into the seat across from her.\n \"Do you come here often?\" Marisa asked.\n \"No, this is my first time.\" He smiled at her. It was a totally disarming smile, revealing teeth white enough for a toothpaste commercial. \"Fortuitous, don\u0027t you think?\"\n At a loss for words, Marisa nodded. She was glad when Tommy came to take her order.\n \"Hey, sweet cheeks,\" the waiter said with a wink, \"how\u0027s it going?\"\n Marisa shook her head. Tommy was a hopeless flirt. He was studying accounting in college, and worked at the restaurant four nights a week. He was under the delusion that he was irresistible.\n \"So,\" Tommy purred, \"what\u0027ll it be?\"\n \"Rigatoni, I think.\"\n \"Excellent choice. Rigatoni and a glass of Chianti.\"\n Marisa grinned. \"You know me too well.\"\n \"Not as well as I\u0027d like,\" Tommy replied, waggling his eyebrows at her. \"And what can I get for you, sir?\"\n \"A glass of red wine. Very dry.\"\n \"Coming right up,\" Tommy said.\n Marisa spread her napkin over her lap. \"You\u0027re not eating?\"\n \"I dined earlier. I only stopped in for a drink.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"You must come here often,\" he remarked.\n \"Yeah, usually once or twice a week. Cooking isn\u0027t my favorite thing, and the food here is good, and inexpensive.\"\n She looked up and smiled as Tommy brought their wine.\n The stranger picked up his glass. \"A toast?\"\n \"What shall we drink to?\"\n \"New friends?\" he suggested.\n Marisa picked up her glass. \"New friends.\"\n He watched her over the rim of his glass as she swallowed.\n \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know your name, new friend.\"\n \"Forgive me. I am Grigori.\" He extended his hand.\n \"Marisa Richards.\"\n He took her hand in his. His grip was gentle, yet firm, his skin cool.\n \"It is my pleasure, Marisa Richards.\"\n His words slid over her, richer than dark chocolate, more intoxicating than the wine in her glass.\n \"So, Grigori, what do you do for a living?\"\n \"Magic, mostly. And you?\"\n \"Magic!\" She cocked her head to one side, and then nodded. Yes, she could easily imagine him standing on a stage clad all in black, a silk cape billowing around him. \"You\u0027re a magician?\"\n He shrugged. \"Among other things.\"\n \"Are you performing here in town?\"\n \"Not at the moment.\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s too bad. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d show me one of your secrets?\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid not.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think you would. There\u0027s some sort of magician\u0027s oath or something, isn\u0027t there?\"\n \"Yes,\" Grigori said, smiling faintly. \"A very ancient oath not to reveal our secrets. You did not tell me what it is you do,\" he reminded her.\n \"I\u0027m a legal secretary at Salazar and Salazar. The elder Mr. Salazar is my boss. A tyrant if ever there was one.\" She smiled. \"Maybe you could make him disappear.\"\n She had expected him to laugh, or at least smile back. Instead, he regarded her for a moment and then said, quite seriously, \"If you wish.\"\n Not certain how to reply, she changed the subject. \"What do you do when you\u0027re not working?\"\n \"I like to take long walks in the moonlight.\"\n \"Oh, a romantic.\"\n He shrugged. \"Perhaps I just prefer the night.\"\n \"Do you? Prefer the night, I mean?\"\n \"Yes.\" He made a vague gesture with his hand. It was a graceful movement, airy, light. \"My eyes are quite sensitive to the sun.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"And what do you like to do when you\u0027re not working?\"\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Read. Go to the movies.\" She grinned at him. \"Take long walks through the park.\"\n \"In the evening?\"\n \"In the morning, I\u0027m afraid. I don\u0027t like walking in the park at night.\"\n \"Perhaps you would take a walk with me some evening and give me a chance to change your mind.\"\n \"Perhaps.\" She regarded him for a moment, trying to think of a tactful way to pose the question uppermost in her mind. In the end, she just asked it, straight out. \"You\u0027re not married or anything, are you?\"\n A hint of sadness passed behind his eyes. \"Not anymore.\"\n \"Divorced?\"\n \"No. My wife and children are... are no more.\"\n It was an odd way of putting it, she thought. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"It happened a long time ago.\"\n Tommy brought her dinner then, and she was glad for the interruption, glad for the chance to change the subject.\n She had thought it would be awkward, eating while Grigori watched, but he sat back in his seat, sipping a second glass of wine. They made small talk while she ate. She declined dessert, protested when Grigori reached for the check.\n \"You don\u0027t have to pay for my dinner,\" she said. \"After all, you didn\u0027t eat anything.\"\n \"I wish to,\" he replied, and something in the deep timbre of his voice, in the sultry glow of his eyes, made her blush.\n Outside, he placed her hand on his arm in a gesture that could only be called old-fashioned. \"I should be honored if you would permit me to walk you home.\"\n She stared at him, suddenly alert. \"How do you know I walked?\"\n A good question, Grigori mused. \"I was behind you on the street.\"\n Marisa chewed on her lower lip. She didn\u0027t remember hearing anyone walking behind her. Of course, the rain could have muffled the sound of his footsteps. Her hand tightened on her umbrella. Not much of a weapon, she mused ruefully, but better than nothing.\n His dark gaze met hers. In the glow of the street lamp, his eyes seemed fathomless, compelling. There was a hint of danger, of mystery, in those eyes.\n \"You do not know me,\" he said quietly. \"I am a stranger you are reluctant to trust.\"\n \"Well, this is the nineties, you know. A girl can\u0027t be too careful.\"\n \"I understand.\" He stepped away from her. \"Perhaps another time, then.\"\n \"Wait, I - \"\n \"I would not want you to be uncomfortable, Marisa.\"\n \"I\u0027m not, really.\" She shrugged. \"It\u0027s just that, well, you know...\"\n \"It is the nineties.\" He smiled at her. A beautiful megawatt smile that left her momentarily breathless. \"Shall we?\"\n He offered her his arm again, and she took it without a qualm, still mesmerized by the effect of his smile, and the rich, sexy sound of his voice.\n \"How long have you lived in the city?\" he asked.\n \"All my life. What about you?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been here only a few weeks.\"\n \"Oh. Business or pleasure?\"\n His gaze rested lightly on her face. \"Definitely a pleasure now.\"\n He smiled again, and it washed over her like sunlight. \"Are you on vacation?\"\n \"Vacation?\" A slight frown furrowed his brow. \"No. I am looking for... an old friend.\"\n \"How long will you be here?\"\n \"As long as it takes me to find him.\"\n \"How do you know he\u0027s here?\"\n \"I know.\"\n The tone of his voice, the sudden tensing of the arm beneath her hand, made her glad he wasn\u0027t looking for her. She had the distinct impression this wasn\u0027t going to be a happy reunion.\n \"Tell me about yourself,\" he urged. \"Do you like being a secretary?\"\n \"Yes. It\u0027s a good job, even if my boss can be a bit of an ogre at times. I get a three-week vacation and paid holidays. And I get my birthday off.\"\n \"And when is that?\"\n \"February 26th. When\u0027s yours?\"\n \"November 20th.\"\n \"A Scorpio, eh?\"\n \"You don\u0027t believe in all that nonsense, do you?\" he asked, obviously amused. \"It is, after all, the nineties.\"\n \"Well,\" she said, laughing, \"not really.\"\n \"But you read your horoscope in the paper every day.\"\n \"Well, not every day.\"\n \"And you avoid black cats, and throw salt over your shoulder for good luck, and never walk under ladders.\"\n \"Are you making fun of me?\"\n \"Of course not.\"\n He smiled at her again, that wonderfully amazing smile the likes of which she had never seen. And his eyes, he had the most beautiful eyes, deep and dark beneath short, thick, sooty lashes. He was quite the most attractive man she had ever met.\n For a time, they walked in silence. Marisa swung her umbrella in her free hand, listening to the sound of raindrops dripping from the leaves of the trees. She was surprised that the silence between them didn\u0027t make her uncomfortable, but it was an easy, companionable silence, as if they had known each other a lifetime instead of a few hours.\n \"Well, this is it. Where I live. Thank you for walking me home.\"\n \"It was my pleasure, Marisa Richards.\" He bowed over her hand and kissed it in a manner that could only be called grand. \"May I call on you?\"\n \"Call on me?\" She grinned at his use of such an old-world term. \"Yes, I think I\u0027d like that.\"\n \"Tomorrow evening?\"\n Tomorrow was Tuesday and she had no plans for the evening other than to curl up on the sofa to watch an old Gary Grant flick. \"That would be fine.\"\n \"What time would be convenient for you?\"\n Marisa shrugged. \"Is seven too early?\"\n \"No.\"\n His gaze moved over her, wrapping around her like a fine, silken web. \"Until tomorrow evening, cara mia.\"\n \"You speak Italian?\"\n \"Si. And Russian and French. And even a little Greek.\"\n \"I\u0027ve always wanted to learn to speak a foreign language.\"\n \"Perhaps I shall teach you.\"\n \"I think I\u0027d like that.\"\n \"As would I. Buono notte, cara.\"\n His voice moved over her, sending little shivers down her spine.\n \"Good night, Grigori.\"\n He bowed, then turned and walked away, leaving her feeling suddenly cold and bereft. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shades-of-gray-vampire-trilogy-1/page-2.html","bookId":2296,"book":{"id":2296,"title":"Shades of Gray (Vampire Trilogy #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Shades of Gray (Vampire Trilogy #1) \n Bound by chains, the vampire had slept for 100 years, locked in pain and hunger, until the scent of one woman\u0027s blood recalled him to life.
