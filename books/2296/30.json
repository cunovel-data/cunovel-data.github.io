{"id":93315,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"Marisa!\" Her mother hugged her tightly, then stepped back and looked her up and down. \"How well you look....\" The words trailed off. \"No, you don\u0027t look well at all! What\u0027s the matter, Marty? Having second thoughts? Well, I can\u0027t say as I blame you. You just met the man - \" Jack Richards drew his daughter into his arms and gave her a bear hug. \"Lay off, Marge, we just got here.\" He winked at Marisa. \"You look fine to me. A little tired, maybe, but your mother looked like death warmed over two days before we got married. You got any coffee?\" \"Sure, Dad.\" Marisa went into the kitchen. Death warmed over. Interesting that her father would use that phrase. She glanced over her shoulder as her father entered the kitchen and sat down at the table. \"Terrible, these killings.\" He spread the newspaper out on the table, the same paper Edward had dropped on the floor earlier, judging by the wrinkles in it. \"Yes, terrible,\" Marisa agreed. She handed her father a cup of coffee and sat down across from him. Ask him how many people he\u0027s killed... I never hunt where I live... Ask him how many lives he\u0027s taken to sustain his own... I haven\u0027t killed anyone in over a hundred and fifty years... \"What is it, Marty? What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Nothing, Dad, just wedding jitters, I guess.\" \"Where\u0027d you meet this guy?\" \"At a carnival just after Halloween.\" Jack Richards laughed out loud. It was a good sound, deep and rich, reminding Marisa of camping trips and hikes through the woods, and birthday parties. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to laugh.\" He shook his head. \"Do you love him?\" \"Yes.\" There\u0027s just one thing wrong with him. He\u0027s a vampire. \"Does he love you?\" \"Yes.\" He thinks my blood is the sweetest nectar of all. She shook the thought from her mind. \"Where\u0027s Mom?\" \"Unpacking.\" He reached across the table and took her hand. \"If you love each other, truly love each other, everything will work out. Trust me. And if it doesn\u0027t, well, you know your mother and I are always here for you.\" \"I know, Dad. Thanks.\" She squeezed his hand, thinking how lucky she was to have this man for her father. He\u0027d always been there for her. He\u0027d taught her to ride a two-wheeler, taken her to her first concert, comforted her when she broke up with her first boyfriend, bought her her first corsage. He\u0027d taught her to drive a car, persuaded her mother to let her shave her legs because all the other girls were doing it, slipped her an extra dollar or two when her allowance ran out, helped her with her homework. \"So, Marty, are we too late for breakfast?\" her mother asked as she came into the kitchen. \"No, Mom. What would you like?\" \"You just sit down and let me take care of it.\" \"Mom, you\u0027re my guest.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly. I\u0027m not a guest, I\u0027m your mother. You go get dressed, and I\u0027ll fix breakfast. What do you want?\" Marisa smiled at her parents, thinking how lucky she was. \"Whatever Dad wants is fine with me.\" \"That\u0027s my girl,\" Jack said with a grin. \"French toast and bacon. How\u0027s that sound?\" \"Perfect!\" Marisa winked at her father, and then left the room, smiling. Mike and Barbara and their kids arrived a little after one. Marisa hugged her nieces and nephews. At ten, Mike Junior was the eldest; then came Nikki, who was eight, Mindy, who was six, and Danny, who had just turned two. \"I don\u0027t know why you live here,\" Mike complained as he gave her a hug. \"The traffic is terrible.\" \"But the weather is wonderful.\" \"I guess. Couldn\u0027t you have gotten married in the summer so we could hit the beach?\" \"Sorry, Mike.\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" \"Just ignore him,\" Barbara advised. \"He\u0027s been complaining ever since the plane landed. You know how he hates to leave Colorado.\" \"How are you, Barb?\" Marisa asked, giving her sister-in-law a hug. \"How am I? I\u0027m pregnant, that\u0027s how I am.\" \"That\u0027s wonderful!\" Marisa exclaimed, and in the back of her mind she heard Grigori urging her to marry a man who could give her children. She looked at Mike\u0027s kids. They were all beautiful, well behaved. \"Another baby!\" Marge Richards rushed forward and hugged Barbara. \"I thought Marisa would have the next one.\" \"Me too,\" Barbara said. \"We really weren\u0027t planning on any more, but - \" She shrugged. \"Things happen.\" Mike grinned. \"Yep.\" \"Congratulations, son.\" Jack shook Mike\u0027s hand, then pulled him into his arms and hugged him. \"Good thing you\u0027ve got those three acres.\" \"There\u0027s room for you and Mom.\" \"No, thanks, my days of shoveling snow are over.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell us this at Christmas?\" Marge asked. \"I just found out yesterday. I thought I had the flu.\" \"Can we watch a video. Aunt Marty?\" \"Sure, Mindy. You know where they are.\" \"I don\u0027t want to watch TV,\" Mike Junior said. \"Can Nikki and I play on your computer?\" Marisa smiled at her nephew. \"Sure, Mike.\" With the two younger kids settled in front of the television watching Beauty and the Beast, the adults went into the kitchen for coffee and conversation. \"So I can\u0027t wait to meet Grigori,\" Barbara said. \"What\u0027s he look like?\" \"A GQ model.\" \"Really?\" Barbara grinned lasciviously. \" \u0027Bout time we had a handsome man in the family.\" \"Hey!\" Mike exclaimed. \"What about me?\" \"You?\" Barbara shrieked as Mike poked her in the ribs. \"What about you?\" \"I\u0027m handsome. Aren\u0027t I, Marty?\" \"Well...\" \"Hey, come on, I\u0027m your brother. You\u0027re supposed to back me up.\" \"Right. Like you backed me up when I asked you if Steve Renouf liked me, and you spread it all over the school that I had a crush on him.\" \"Haven\u0027t you forgotten about that yet?\" \"No, and I never will.\" \"Okay, kids, settle down,\" Jack said. \"I don\u0027t wanna have to send you to your rooms.\" Marisa and Mike exchanged looks and then burst into laughter, and Marisa thought again how wonderful it was to have her family there, to feel the love they shared for one another. They reminisced about old times, exchanged news, talked about the wedding. Before long it was time to get ready for dinner. Mr. Abbott\u0027s wife had agreed to come and stay with the kids while the adults went out to dinner. Marisa ordered pizza for the kids, and then it was six o\u0027clock. There were millions of butterflies going crazy in her stomach by the time Grigori arrived. Would her parents like him? Would he like them? Would they notice there was something different about him? He kissed her cheek when she opened the door. \"You look lovely,\" he whispered, and his breath felt warm and intimate against her ear. \"Thanks. Are you ready to meet everyone?\" He nodded. \"Worried?\" \"A little.\" He smiled down at her. \"I love you, cara.\" Words. They were just words. Ordinary words that were said every day, but they washed over her like a soothing balm, calming the butterflies. \"I love you, too.\" She took his hand and led him into the living room. \"Hey, everybody, this is Grigori.\" Was it her imagination, or was there a sudden lack of oxygen in the room? Her father and Mike exchanged glances she couldn\u0027t interpret. Her mother pressed a hand to her heart. Barbara murmured, \"Oh, my, you were right.\" Grigori slid a glance at Maria. \"Right? About what?\" \"I told them you looked like a GQ model.\" \"Ahhh.\" She quickly introduced Grigori to everyone, including the kids, and then they trooped outside. Mike let out a long, low whistle when he saw Grigori\u0027s Corvette. \"Wow, nice wheels.\" \"You should see mine.\" Marisa tossed the words over her shoulder as she slid into the passenger seat. \"Mine\u0027s red.\" Mike looked at Grigori. \"She\u0027s kidding, right?\" Grigori shook his head. \"But... but how?\" \"And it\u0027s a convertible,\" Marisa added. She grinned at the look of astonishment on her brother\u0027s face. Mike, Barb, and her parents climbed into the van Mike had rented, and Grigori pulled away from the curb. He checked the rearview mirror to make certain her family was following, then gave her knee a squeeze. \"You look like the proverbial cat that swallowed the canary.\" \"I can\u0027t help it.\" She grinned at him. \"This is the first time I ever had a better car than Mike.\" She leaned over and kissed his cheek. \"Thank you for that.\" \"You are most welcome. How was your day?\" \"Fine - \" The words died in her throat as she recalled Edward\u0027s visit that morning. In the rush of her family\u0027s arrival, she had forgotten all about it. Grigori glanced over at her, noting the worry lines in her brow. \"Is something wrong?\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it now.\" \"As you wish.\" They drove the rest of the way in silence. Dinner went well. Marisa watched Grigori carefully. She recalled the time they had gone to dinner at the North Woods Inn. He\u0027d ordered a steak and she would have sworn he ate it. She knew better now. He toyed with the food on his plate, but never really ate anything. Yet she knew that if she were to ask her parents about it later, they would assure her that he\u0027d eaten a full meal. Talk at the table was polite and restrained at first, but gradually everyone relaxed. They talked about the wedding; then Jack and Marge told about their wedding, and Mike and Barb reminisced about their own. Champagne flowed freely, as did the conversation and the laughter. \"So,\" Barbara said, \"where are you two going for your honeymoon?\" \"We\u0027re going to stay home.\" \"Home!\" Marisa nodded. \"Grigori said we could go wherever I wanted, but I want to stay home, in our own house, just the two of us.\" \"You always said you wanted to go to Italy for your honeymoon,\" Marge remarked. Marisa looked at Grigori and smiled. \"I\u0027ve been to Italy.\" \"You have!\" her father exclaimed. \"When?\" \"Not long ago. It was a quick, unexpected trip.\" \"Really?\" Mike frowned at her. \"You never mentioned it.\" \"Didn\u0027t I? I\u0027m ready for dessert. Mom, what are you going to have?\" Grigori grinned as she neatly changed the subject. It was late when they returned to Marisa\u0027s apartment. Mike and Barb picked up their kids, and then left for the motel. Jack and Marge bid Marisa and Grigori good night and went to bed. Marisa sat down on the sofa and pulled a pillow into her lap. \"Well,\" she said, \"alone at last.\" \"Indeed.\" He regarded her thoughtfully a moment, and then sat down beside her. \"Do you want to tell me what\u0027s bothering you?\" \"Nothing, really.\" \"Really?\" She blew out a deep breath. \"Edward came by this morning.\" \"I see.\" \"There\u0027s been another killing. Did you know that?\" He nodded. \"Go on.\" \"He said a lot of foolish things. It doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"I think it matters very much. What did he say?\" Marisa glanced at the hallway. \"We can\u0027t talk about it here.\" She gasped as he took her in his arms and stood up. \"What are you doing?\" \"Going where we can talk.\" Before she could protest, before she could ask where they were going, they were there. He placed her on her feet, and then turned on the lights. \"There\u0027s no one to overhear us now.\" \"I really don\u0027t want to discuss it.\" \"Don\u0027t you? Something\u0027s troubling you. I\u0027ve known it all night. It\u0027s more than another killing. What is it?\" It was cold in the house. She wrapped her arms around her body, wondering if she was shaking from the chill in the air, or the coldness in Grigori\u0027s eyes. He turned away from her. She saw him wave his hand, and in the next instant, there was a fire in the fireplace. He took several slow, deep breaths, and then turned to face her. \"Tell me, Marisa.\" \"He said I was crazy to marry you, that I should ask you how many people you\u0027ve killed. He - \" She wrapped her arms around her waist. \"He asked me if I wanted to be next.\" Grigori swore under his breath. \"Dammit, Marisa, what do you want me to say?\" \"I just want the truth.\" \"I\u0027ve told you the truth. I\u0027ve killed people. I told you that. Maybe I glossed over it to spare your feelings, but I never lied to you about it. There were times, in the beginning, before I learned to control the Hunger, that people died. I can\u0027t do anything about that. Their deaths haunted me then. They haunt me now. But I can\u0027t change the past.\" He crossed the floor to the window. Drawing back the curtain, he gazed out into the darkness. \"Maybe I\u0027m just kidding myself,\" he murmured. \"I thought we could make this work. Maybe I was wrong.\" The anguish in his voice, the loneliness, tugged at her heart. She went to stand behind him. \"I love you, you know I do.\" He could feel her close to him. Her warmth engulfed him; her scent surrounded him. \"Maybe that\u0027s not enough.\" \"What else is there?\" \"Trust.\" \"I do trust you.\" \"Do you? Can you tell me, honestly, that you\u0027re not afraid of me, that there isn\u0027t a part of you that doesn\u0027t wonder if Ramsey is right?\" \"Search my mind, Grigori, and find the truth for yourself.\" \"Marisa...\" Slowly, he turned to face her. \"If you\u0027re not sure, if you have any doubts, tell me now, before it\u0027s too late. I told you before, once you\u0027re mine, I will not let you go. There will be no divorce if you decide you\u0027ve made a mistake.\" His gaze trapped and held hers. \"Be sure.\" He needed her. All her life, she had wanted someone who would love her unconditionally, someone who would need her, someone who couldn\u0027t live without her. \"I\u0027m sure.\" With infinite care, he drew her into his arms. \"I love you, cara mia. I will never love another.\" With a sigh, she rested her head against his chest, felt his love wash over her, warm and sweet. This was right. This was where she belonged. Friday was a pleasant day. Mike and his family came over for breakfast. Later, the kids watched TV while the adults played cards. It was just the kind of day Marisa needed. A time to spend with her family, to relax and have a good time with the people she loved most. They discussed names for the new baby. It started out as a serious discussion and they suggested names like John and Mary. Eventually, as they tried to top each other, they were tossing out names like Heathcliffe and Hildegarde. It felt good to laugh. They ordered pizza for lunch, and then went out for ice cream. Back at home, Barbara put Danny down for a nap. Mike Junior and Nikki went to play on the computer. Mindy went into the bedroom to play with her Barbies. When the kids were all settled in other rooms, the questions started. \"So,\" her father asked, \"what does Grigori do for a living?\" \"He\u0027s a magician.\" \"A magician!\" her mother exclaimed. \"Really? I\u0027ve never known a magician.\" \"Does he do children\u0027s parties?\" Barbara asked. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"I\u0027ve never heard of him,\" Mike remarked. \"Does he use a stage name?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You don\u0027t?\" Marisa shrugged. \"I just assumed he used his own name. He hasn\u0027t been in this country very long. He\u0027s from Italy.\" \"You\u0027re not moving to Italy, are you?\" Marge asked. \"No. Well, I don\u0027t think so. We never discussed it.\" \"I thought he\u0027d be coming by today,\" Mike said. \"He had some last-minute errands of his own to run.\" \"I think he\u0027s pretty,\" Nikki said. She sat on the arm of the sofa beside Marisa. \"Is he really a magician? Would he do some tricks for us?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sweetie; you\u0027ll have to ask him. I thought you were playing \"Doom\" with Mike.\" \"He\u0027s hogging the computer. Is Grigori coming over later? I like him.\" \"Me too.\" \"You\u0027re not going to quit your job, are you?\" \"No, Dad, why?\" \"Well...\" \"Well, what?\" \"Well, can he support you? I mean, he doesn\u0027t seem to be working.\" \"He\u0027s got money, Dad. He just bought a big old house up in the hills. And who do you think bought my car? I certainly couldn\u0027t afford it. Not on my salary.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to upset you, honey, but you haven\u0027t known this guy very long. He seems nice enough, but there\u0027s something about him. I don\u0027t know what it is. I can\u0027t quite put my finger on it, but I think you ought to hang on to your job until... well, you know.\" \"Jack, Marty\u0027s a big girl now,\" Marge said. \"She knows what she\u0027s doing.\" \"Thanks, Mom.\" \"You\u0027re welcome, Marty.\" Marge toyed with her necklace a moment. \"Still, your Dad makes good sense.\" \"He always has,\" Marisa said. \"I\u0027m gonna get a Coke.\" \"Can I have one?\" Nikki asked. \"Sure, sweetie.\" Marisa went into the kitchen and pressed her forehead against the refrigerator door. She couldn\u0027t blame her parents for worrying about her. She had doubts, too. Marriage was a big step. She didn\u0027t want to be one of those women who changed husbands as often as they changed their shoes. She wanted it to be forever. \"Forever,\" she muttered. That was funny. Grigori really could give her forever, if she wanted it. \"You okay?\" Marisa straightened up and opened the door to the fridge. \"I\u0027m fine, Mike.\" She pulled out two cans of Coke. \"Do you want anything?\" \"No. Don\u0027t let Dad get to ya. He\u0027s just, you know, being a dad.\" \"I know.\" She closed the door, and then turned to face her brother. \"It\u0027s all right.\" \"Well, you looked a little upset.\" Marisa shook her head. \"I\u0027m not, really.\" \"Dad\u0027s right about one thing, though. You haven\u0027t known Grigori very long. Why the sudden rush to get married? I mean, you\u0027ve waited this long.\" \"Not you, too!\" \"Hey, I\u0027m not criticizing, I\u0027m just asking.\" \"I love him and I want to marry him. Why is that so hard to believe? Just because it took you and Barb two years to decide to get married doesn\u0027t mean it has to take me that long, too. Mom and Dad knew each other less than a year when they got married.\" \"I know, but - \" Mike placed his hands on her shoulders. \"Dad\u0027s right about something else, too. There is something strange about Grigori. He\u0027s different somehow.\" \"Mike, just drop it, okay? I know what I\u0027m doing.\" He squeezed her shoulders. \"I know you do. We just love you, sis, that\u0027s all.\" \"I know.\" Their love was like a blanket, usually warm and welcome, but sometimes it smothered her. Grigori arrived at sundown. Marisa was in the kitchen with her mother and Barbara, trying to decide what to do about dinner, when the doorbell rang. A flutter in her stomach, a subtle change in the atmosphere told her it was Grigori even before she opened the door. As always, her first sight of him took her breath away. He was so tall, so incredibly good-looking. And his smile... a smile that was just for her, it made her insides turn to mush. \"Cara.\" He bent down and brushed a kiss across her lips. \"Hi.\" He wore black slacks, boots, and a bulky gray sweater that emphasized his broad shoulders. \"Come on in. We\u0027re trying to decide what to do about dinner.\" His gaze slid over her face to the pulse throbbing in the hollow of her throat. He felt the sharp prick of his fangs against his tongue and wondered if he would be able to control his hunger for her once she was truly his. Marisa\u0027s heart skipped a beat as his gaze moved over her. He didn\u0027t say anything, but she knew what he was thinking. Unbidden, unwanted, Edward\u0027s voice rose in the back of her mind: Then ask yourself if you want to be next. She lifted her gaze to his. The sound of the evening news, the voices of her family, the traffic on the street, everything faded into the distance, ceased to exist, until there were only the two of them standing in the entry hall. \"Marisa...\" He cupped her face in his hands, his fingertips moving lightly over her skin. \"Give me a chance, cara. I\u0027ll make you happy, I swear it.\" She didn\u0027t know what to say. His eyes were dark and vulnerable, filled with the pain, the loneliness, of two hundred years. \"I love you, cara mia.\" \"I know you do.\" Dammit, Marisa, he\u0027s a vampire. Edward\u0027s voice rang out in her mind. He\u0027s incapable of love. She moved into Grigori\u0027s embrace and wrapped her arms around his waist. \"And I love you.\" \"No doubts?\" \"Just the usual doubts every bride has.\" \"That\u0027s all?\" She met his gaze again. \"That\u0027s all. I\u0027m not afraid of you, Grigori. I\u0027m not afraid of what you are, only that I\u0027ll disappoint you.\" \"Never!\" He kissed her lightly, sweetly, and when he drew away, the world returned. Because they couldn\u0027t all agree on what they wanted for dinner, they ordered pizza for the kids, Chinese for Marge and Barbara, and Italian for everyone else. \"So, Grigori, my daughter says you\u0027re a magician,\" Jack remarked. Dinner was over and they were in the living room. \"Yes.\" \"Could you do a trick for us?\" Nikki asked. \"What would you like me to do? Saw you in half?\" Nikki giggled. \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\" She punched Mike Junior on the arm. \"Maybe you could just make my brother disappear.\" \"I could,\" Grigori replied solemnly, \"but I\u0027m not sure I could bring him back.\" \"That\u0027d be okay with me. Ouch! Mom, Mike hit me.\" \"That\u0027s enough, you two,\" Barbara warned. Grigori glanced at Marisa. She grinned at him, one brow raised in amusement. Grigori grinned back, accepting the silent challenge in her eyes. \"I\u0027ll need an assistant,\" he said, rising to his feet. \"Marisa?\" She rolled her eyes, then stood up and joined him in the center of the living room. \"Look into my eyes,\" Grigori said. \"Forget where you are. We are alone in this room, just the two of us. Concentrate on the sound of my voice.... That\u0027s right... you are in my power now. You see only me, hear only me.\" \"I see only you,\" she murmured. \"Hear only you.\" \"You will do whatever I tell you.\" \"Yes.\" Grigori looked over at Marge and Jack, who were sitting on the sofa. \"Would you get up, please?\" Marisa\u0027s parents exchanged glances, then stood up and went to stand near the fireplace. Grigori lifted Marisa in his arms and carried her to the sofa. He laid her down, passed his hand over her face. \"You will sleep now, Marisa, and will not awaken until I call your name.\" Her eyelids closed. He stood beside the sofa, and then, very slowly, he raised his arms, palms up. And she floated off the sofa to hover in the air. \"Wow!\" Mike Junior exclaimed. \"That\u0027s awesome!\" \"Amazing.\" \"Impossible!\" \"How can he do that?\" Slowly, Grigori lowered his arms. Light as a feather, Marisa landed on the sofa. \"Marisa,\" he called softly. Her eyelids fluttered open and she sat up, blinking at him. \"What happened?\" \"He levitated you. Damn,\" Mike said, \"how\u0027d you do that? I\u0027ve seen it done onstage, but... but I always thought it was done with wires.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027ve got to hand it to you, that\u0027s the most amazing thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\" \"Do me,\" Mindy said, tugging on Grigori\u0027s pant leg. \"I want to fly, too.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Barbara pulled her daughter into her lap. \"You\u0027re not old enough to fly.\" \"Come on, man,\" Mike Junior said, \"tell us how you did it.\" \"I\u0027m afraid magicians are sworn never to reveal their secrets.\" Barbara looked at her watch, and then stood up. \"It\u0027s getting late. Kids, get your stuff together. We\u0027ve all got a big day tomorrow. Mike, are you ready to go?\" \"Yeah, honey.\" There was a flurry of activity as Mike and Barbara gathered up their kids and said their goodbyes. A few minutes later, Jack and Marge went to bed. \"Looks like I cleared the room,\" Grigori said. \"That would be a problem if I were a real magician.\" \"Did you have to do something quite so flashy? I mean, couldn\u0027t you have done something that could be explained? And why did you make me go to sleep? I\u0027ve never been levitated before, and I missed it.\" \"I was afraid it would scare you.\" Marisa tugged on his sweater. \"I\u0027m marrying a vampire,\" she said with a grin. \"If that doesn\u0027t scare me, nothing will.\" He couldn\u0027t argue with that, so he kissed her. \"I should go,\" he said. \"It\u0027s early.\" \"Get a good night\u0027s sleep, cara. I\u0027ll keep you up late tomorrow night.\" She grinned up at him, her insides quivering with anticipation. \"Domani, Marisa,\" he whispered. \"Tomorrow, you will be mine.\" The heat in his eyes, the husky tremor in his voice, sent a shiver of pleasure down her spine. Tomorrow.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shades-of-gray-vampire-trilogy-1/page-30.html","bookId":2296,"book":{"id":2296,"title":"Shades of Gray (Vampire Trilogy #1)","description":"Storyline: Shades of Gray (Vampire Trilogy #1) Bound by chains, the vampire had slept for 100 years, locked in pain and hunger, until the scent of one woman\u0027s blood recalled him to life.
