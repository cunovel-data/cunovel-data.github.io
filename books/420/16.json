{"id":39806,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. IDLESSE.","content":"George Dallas had relieved his conscience by despatching the money to Routh, he felt that he had sufficiently discharged a moral duty to enable him to lie fallow for a little time and reflect upon the excellence of the deed, without immediately pushing forward on that career of stern duty which he had prescribed for himself. In his desultory frame of mind it afforded him the greatest pleasure to sit apart in the quaintly-trimmed gardens, or on the shady quays, idly looking on the life passing before him, thinking that he was no longer in the power of those who had so long exercised an evil influence over him, and recollecting that out of the balance of the sum which he had received from Mr. Dieverbrug he had enough left to keep him without any absolute necessity for resorting to work for some little time to come. For George Dallas was essentially an idler and a dreamer, an intending well-doer, but steeped to the lips in procrastination, and without the smallest knowledge of the realities of life. He had hopes and ambitions, newly kindled, as one might say; honest aspirations, such as in most men would have proved spurs to immediate enterprise; but George Dallas lay about on the seats of the public gardens, or leaned against the huge trees bordering the canals, and as he puffed into the air the light-blue smoke, and watched it curling and eddying above his head, he thought how delightful it would be to see Clare Carruthers blushing with delight at his literary success; he pictured himself telling her how he had at last succeeded in making a name, and how the desire of pleasing her had been his greatest incentive; he saw his mother trembling and joyous, his stepfather with his arms open, and his cheque-book at his stepson\u0027s disposal; he had a dim vision of Amherst church, and flower-strewing maidens, and ringing bells, and cheering populace,--and then he puffed out a little more smoke, and thought that he really must begin to think about getting into harness again. As a first step to this desirable result, he paid his bill at the Amsterdam hotel, and started off for the Hague, where he remained for a fortnight, enjoying himself in the laziest and pleasantest manner, lounging in the picture-gallery and the royal library, living remarkably well, smoking a great deal, and thinking about Clare Carruthers; and in odd half-hours, after breakfast or before he went to bed, doing a little literary work--transcript of his day\u0027s observations--which he sent to the Mercury, with a line to Grafton Leigh, telling him that private affairs had necessitated his coming abroad, but that when he returned he would keep the promise he had made of constant contributions to the paper; meanwhile he sent a few sketches, just to keep his hand in. In reply to this letter he received a communication from his friend Cunningham, telling him that his chief was much pleased with the articles, and would be glad, as George was so near, if he would go over to Amsterdam, and write an account of the starting of the fleet for the herring-fishery--an event which was just about to come off, and which, owing to special circumstances at the time, excited a peculiar interest in England. In this letter Cunningham enclosed another, which he said had been for some time lying at the office, and which, on opening, George found to be from the proprietors of the Piccadilly, presenting their compliments to Mr. Paul Ward, stating that they were recommended by their \"literary adviser,\" who was much struck by the brilliancy and freshness of so much of Mr. Paul Ward\u0027s serial story as had been sent in, to accept that story for their magazine; regretting that Mr. Ward\u0027s name was not yet sufficiently well known to enable them to give the sum he had named as his price, but offering him, on the whole, very handsome terms. So it had come at last! No longer to struggle on, a wretched outsider, a component of the \"ruck\" in the great race for name and fame and profit, but one of the select, taking the leading place in the leading periodical of the day, with the chance, if fortune favoured him, and he could only avail himself of the opportunity so long denied, and call into action the influences so long prompting him, of rendering himself from month to month an object of interest, a living something, an actual necessity to thousands of people whose faces he should never see, and who would yet know of him, and look with the deepest interest on the ideal creatures of his fancy. Pardon the day-dream now, for the good to be derived from action is now so real, so tangible, that the lotos-leaves shall soon be cast aside. And yet how fascinating is the vision which their charm has ever evoked for the young man bound under their spell! Honour, wealth, fame, love!--not all your riches, Capel Carruthers; not your county position, not your territorial influence, not your magisterial dignity, nor anything else on which you pride yourself, shall be half as sweet to you as the dignified pride of the man who looks around him, and seeing himself possessed of all these enviable qualities, says: \"By my own hand, by the talent which God has given me, and by His help alone, unaided by birth, or riches, or influence, I have made myself what I am!\" The crisis in George Dallas\u0027s life had arrived; the ball was at his feet, and with the opportunity so urgent on him, all his desultoriness, till his lazy dilettanteism, vanished. He felt at last that life was real and earnest, and determined to enter upon it at once. With what big schemes his heart was filled, with what quixotic dreams his brain was bursting! In his own mind his triumphant position in the future was so assured that he could not resist taking an immediate foretaste of his happiness; and so on the very day of the receipt of Cunningham\u0027s letter a box containing some very rare Japanese fans, screens, and china, was despatched anonymously, addressed to Miss Carruthers. The cost of these trifles barely left George Dallas enough to pay his fare back to Amsterdam. But what of that? Was he not on the high road to fortune, and could he not make money as he liked? The polyglot waiter received him, if not with open arms, at least with a smiling face and a babble of many-tongued welcomes, and placed in his hands a letter which had been more than a week awaiting him. George glanced at its superscription, and a shadow crossed his face as he recognized Routh\u0027s hand-writing. He had looked upon that connection as so completely cut asunder, that he had forgotten his last communication necessitated a reply--an acknowledgment of the receipt of the money, at least--and he opened the letter with an undefined sensation of annoyance. He read as follows: S. M.-street, June --, 18--. \"Your letter, my dear George, and its enclosure is \u0027to hand,\u0027 as we say in Tokenhouse-yard; and I flatter myself that you, who know something of me, and who have seen inside my waistcoat, know that I am highly pleased at the return you have made for what you ridiculously term my \u0027enormous kindness,\u0027 and at the feeling which has prompted you, at, I am certain, some self-sacrifice, to return me the sum which I was only too pleased to be able to place at your disposal I am a bad hand, as you, great author, literary swell, \u0026c., \u0026c., will soon see--I am a bad hand at fencing off what I have got to say, and therefore I must out with it at once. I know it ought to be put in a postscript--just dropped par hazard, as though it were an after-thought, and not the real gist of the letter--but I do not understand that kind of \u0027caper,\u0027 and so must say what I have got to say in my own way. So look here! I am ten years older than you in years, and thirty years in experience; and I know what heart-burnings and worries, not merely for yourself alone, but for others very, very dear to you, you have had in raising this money which you have sent to me. You thought it a debt of honour, and consequently moved heaven and earth to discharge it; and you knew that I was hard up--a fact which had an equally irritating effect on you. Now look here! (I have said that before, I see; but never mind!) As to the honour--well, not to mince matters, it was a gambling debt, pur et simple; and when I reflect, as I do sometimes--Harriet knows that, and will tell you so--I know well enough that but for me you would never have been led into gambling. I am not preaching, old fellow; I am simply speaking the honest truth. Well, the thought that you have had all this to go through, and such a large sum of money to pay, yerks me, and goes against the grain. And then, as to my being hard up, don\u0027t mind telling you--of course in the strictest confidence--that Tokenhouse-yard is a tremendous success! It was a tight time some months ago, and no mistake; but I think we have weathered the storm, and the money is rolling in there splendidly; so splendidly and so rapidly, that--again in the strictest confidence--I am thinking of launching out a little, and taking up the position which--you\u0027ll know I\u0027m not bragging, old boy--my birth and education warrant me in assuming. I have grovelled on long enough, heaven knows, and I want to see myself, and above all, I want to see my wife, out of the reach of--well, I need not dilate to you on what circumstances have lowered us to, and what we will now float above. So, as good luck is nothing unless one\u0027s friends share in it, I want to say to you, as delicately as I can, \u0027Share in mine!\u0027 Don\u0027t be in a hurry to send me back that money, don\u0027t be too proud--that\u0027s not the word, George--I should say, don\u0027t fear to remain in my debt; and, if occasion should arise, let me be your banker for further sums. I can stand the racket, and shall be only too glad to be called upon to do so, as some slight way of atoning for having led you into what cannot be looked upon by any one, I am afraid, as a reputable life. I won\u0027t say any more on this head, because there is no need. You will know that I am in earnest in what I have said, and you will receive the fifty pounds which I have enclosed herein in the spirit in which they are sent--that of true friendship. You will be a great gun some day, if you fulfil the promise made for you by those who ought to know about it; and then you will repay me. Meanwhile, depend on it that any draft of yours on me will be duly honoured. \"And so you are not coming back to London for some time? It seems an ungenerous thing in a friend to say, but upon my soul I think the wisest thing you can do is to remain abroad, and widen your knowledge of life. You have youth and health, at your time of life the powers of observation are at their freshest and strongest, all you will want is money, and that you shan\u0027t want, if you accede to the suggestion I have just made. You will store your mind in experience, you will see all sorts and varieties of men and as you have nothing particular to bind you to England, you could thoroughly enjoy your freedom, and return with a valuable stock of ideas for the future benefit of the British reading public. Allez toujours, la jeunesse! which, under its familiar translation of \u0027Go it while you\u0027re young!\u0027 is the best advice I can give yon, George, my dear boy. During your absence, you will have shaken off all your old associations, and who knows but that the great bashaw, your stepfather, may clasp you to his bosom, and leave all his acres to his dearly-beloved stepson, G. D.? Only one thing! You must not forget Harry, and you must not forget me! If all works right, you will find us very differently situated from what you have ever known us, and you won\u0027t be ashamed to recognize us as friends. You would laugh if you could see me now, emphatically a \u0027City man,\u0027 wearing Oxford-mixture trousers and carrying a shabby fat umbrella, which is an infallible sign of wealth, eating chops in the middle of the day, solemnly rebuking my young clerks for late attendance at the office, and comporting myself generally with the greatest gravity and decorum. And to think that we once used to \u0027back the caster,\u0027 and have, in our time, held point, quint, and quatorze. Tell it not in Gath! \u0027By advices last received, the produce of the mines has been twenty-two thousand oitavas, the gain whereof is, \u0026c. \u0026c.\u0027 That\u0027s the style now! \"Harriet is well, and, as ever, my right hand. To see her at work over the books at night, one would think she had been born in the Brazils, and had never heard of anything but silver mines. She sends kindest regards, and is fully of my opinion as to the expediency of your staying away from London. No news of Deane; but that does not surprise me. His association with us was entirely one of concurrence, and he always talked of himself as a wanderer--a bird of passage. I suppose he did not give you any hint of his probable movements on the day of the dinner, when I had the ill-luck to offend him by not coming? No one ever knew where he lived, or how, so I can\u0027t make any inquiries. However, it\u0027s very little matter. \"And now I must make an end of this long story. Good-bye my dear George. All sorts of luck, and jollity, and happiness attend you, but in the enjoyment of them all don\u0027t forget the pecuniary proposition I have made to you, and think sometimes kindly of \"Your sincere \"Stewart Routh.\" A little roll of paper had dropped from the letter when George opened it. He picked it up, and found two Bank-of-England notes for twenty pounds, and one for ten pounds. It is no discredit to George Dallas to avow that when he had finished the perusal of this quaint epistle, and when he looked at its enclosure, he had a swelling in his throat, a quivering in the muscles of his mouth, and thick heavy tears in his eyes. He was very young, you see, and very impressionable, swaying hither and thither with the wind and the stream, unstable as water, and with very little power of adhering to any determination, however right and laudable it seemed at the first blush. There are few of us--in early youth, at all events, let us trust--who are so clear-headed, and far-seeing, and right-hearted, as to be able to do exactly what Duty prescribes to us--the shutting out all promptings of inclination! Depend upon it the good boys in the children\u0027s story-books, those juvenile patterns who went unwaveringly to the Sunday-school, shutting their eyes to the queen-cakes and toffy so temptingly displayed on the road-side, and who were adamant in the matter of telling a fib, though by so doing they might have saved their schoolfellow a flogging--depend upon it they turned out, for the most part, very bad men, who robbed the orphans and ground the faces of the widows. George Dallas was but a man, very warm-hearted, very impressionable, and when he read Stewart Routh\u0027s letter he repented of his harshness to his friend, and accused himself of having been precipitate and ungenerous. Here was the blackleg, the sharper, the gambler, actually returning some of his legitimate winnings, and placing his purse at his acquaintance\u0027s disposal, while his stepfather--But then that would not bear thinking about! Besides, his stepfather was Clare\u0027s uncle; no kindness of Routh\u0027s would ever enable him, George, to make progress in that direction, and therefore--And yet it was deuced kind in Routh to be so thoughtful. The money came so opportunely, too, just when, what with his Hague excursion and his purchases, he had spent the balance of the sum derived from the sale of the bracelet, and it would have been scarcely decent to ask for an advance from the Mercury office or the Piccadilly people. But it was a great thing that Routh advised him to keep away from England for a time--a corroboration, too, of Routh\u0027s statement that he was going into a different line of life--for of course with his new views an intimacy with Routh would be impossible, whereas, he could now let it drop quietly. He would accept the money so kindly sent him, and he would do the account of the herring fishery for the Mercury, and he would get on with the serial story for the Piccadilly, and-- Well, he would remain where he was, and see what turned up. The quiet, easy-going, dreamy life suited George to a nicety; and if he had been a little older, and had never seen Clare Carruthers, he might, on very little provocation, have accepted the Dutch far niente as the realization of human bliss. So, having to remain in Holland for some few days longer, and needing some money for immediate spending, George Dallas bethought him of his old friend, Mr. Schaub, and strolled to the Muiderstraat in search of him. He found the old gentleman seated behind his counter, bending over an enormous volume in the Hebrew character, over the top of which he glared through the silver-rimmed spectacles at his visitor with anything but an inviting glance. When, however, he recognized George, which he did comparatively quickly, his forbidding look relaxed, he put down the book, and began nodding in a galvanized manner, rubbing the palms of his hands together, and showing the few fangs left in his mouth. \"Vat? Vart--Paul Vart! you here still? Wass you not back gone to your own land, Vart? You do no more vairks, Vart, you vaste your time in Amsterdam, Vart--Paul Vart!\" \"No; not that,\" said George, laughing; \"I have not gone home, certainly, but I\u0027ve not lost my time. I\u0027ve been seeing to your country and studying character. I\u0027ve been to the Hague.\" \"Ja, ja! the Hague! and, like your countrymen, you have bought their die Japans, die dogues, and punch-bowls. Ja, ja!\" George admitted the fact as to japan-ware and china dogs, but denied the punch-bowls. \"Ja, ja!\" groaned Mr. Schaub; \"and here in dis house I could have sold you straight same, de straight same, and you save your money for journey to Hague.\" \"Well, I haven\u0027t saved the money,\" said George with a laugh, \"but I dare say I shall be able to make something of what I saw there. You\u0027ll be pleased to hear I am going to write a story for the Piccadilly--they\u0027ve engaged me.\" \"Wass Peek-a-teelies wass goot, ver goot,\" said Mr. Schaub; \"better as Mercury--bigger, higher, more stand!\" \"Ah! but you mustn\u0027t run down the Mercury, either. They\u0027ve asked me to write a description of the sailing of your herring-fleet. So I must stop here for a few days, and I want you to change me a Bank-of-England note.\" \"Ja, ja! with pleasure! Wass always likes dis Bank-of-England notes; ist goot, and clean, and so better as dirty Austrich Prussich money. Ah! he is not the same as I give you other day! He is quite new and clean for twenty pounds! Ja, ja!\" he added, after holding the note up to the light, \"his vater-mark is raight! A. F.! Vot is A. F., 17 April? Ah, you don\u0027t know! You don\u0027t become it from A. F.? Course not! Vell, vell, let me see die course of \u0027Change--denn I put him into my leetle stock von English bank-note!\" The old man took up a newspaper that lay on the counter before him and consulted it, made a rapid calculation on a piece of paper, and was about to turn round towards the drawer where, as George remembered, he kept his cash-box, when he stopped, handed George the pen from behind his ear, dipped it into the ink, and said: \"Vell, just write his name, Vart--Paul Vart, on his back--m-ja? And his date of month. So! Vart--Paul Vart!--m-ja! ist goot. Here\u0027s die guldens.\" George Dallas swept the gold pieces into his pocket, nodded to the old man, and left the shop. Mr. Schaub carefully locked away the note, made an entry of its number and amount in his ledger, and resumed his reading. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90388.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
