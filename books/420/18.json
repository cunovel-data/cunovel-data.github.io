{"id":39808,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. ON THE DEFENSIVE.","content":"The announcement of a lady who wished to see Mrs. Brookes caused the faithful old woman no particular emotion. She was well known and much respected among the neighbours of Poynings, in the humbler sense, and visits from several of their number were ordinary events enough in her life. The announcement found her, not in her own room, but in her mistress\u0027s, where she had replaced the portrait of George, and was sitting looking at it with dim eyes and clasped hands. The time had been long in rolling over her weary old head; for though she had passed the period of life in which feeling is very keen, and sorrow has power to torture, and constancy to last, Mrs. Brookes had no other objects to divide her thoughts with Mrs. Carruthers and her son; and day by day the old woman had brooded upon the new trouble which had come to those whom she loved so well. Perplexity mingled with her grief, for she knew not what to think. She had stoutly denied the possibility of George\u0027s guilt, in the memorable dialogue which had been the last she had held with his mother; but the faint and fluttering hope she entertained was very different from the confidence she expressed; and now, in the solitude and silence of the great house, in the absence of the absorbing demand which Mrs. Carruthers\u0027s condition had made upon all her attention and self-command, her stout old heart sank within her. His mother was gone away from all the scenes and associations which had come to have a terrible meaning. Would she ever return? Ellen hardly knew how she wished to answer this question. It were better and happier perhaps that she never did, that her tired heart should drowsily beat itself to rest in a strange country, and lie hidden under another soil than that her son had stained with blood. Had he done this thing? What of him? Where was he? The orderly house, the well-regulated household, needed little of the old housekeeper\u0027s supervision. The absence of the family made little difference. No cleaning-days interrupted the decorous order of things in an establishment in which it would have savoured of indecorum to suppose that the rule of absolute cleanliness was ever superseded. Alterations and repairs were innovating interruptions altogether incompatible with Poynings; and, in fact, there was little or nothing to break the dead level to which old Ellen had looked forward as that of her days when she should be left alone in the stately house, and which had begun to realize itself at once. Dixon had accompanied her mistress to foreign parts; and it was Martha, housemaid, who told Mrs. Brookes that a lady, who had been shown into her own room, wanted to see her. \"Which, I dare say, she\u0027s come after Susan\u0027s character,\" remarked Martha, parenthetically, \"for she ain\u0027t this side Hamherst, I know.\" Mrs. Brookes rose from the chair that she had placed opposite George\u0027s picture, took off her spectacles, from which she wiped a suspicious moisture, placed them carefully in her pocket, arranged her cap and shawl, and, without vouchsafing any answer to the speculations of Martha, she took her way slowly to the housekeeper\u0027s room. As she crossed the hall she saw a fly standing at the open door; and the driver, a man from Page\u0027s, touched his hat to her as she passed. \"I don\u0027t know this lady,\" she thought. \"Nobody about here takes a fly to come to Poynings.\" Her visitor was seated on the heavy horsehair sofa, which in the winter flanked the fire, but was now drawn close under the window through which George had entered on that memorable night, which came freshly into the memory of the old woman at that moment. As she looked sharply at the figure which rose to greet her, Mrs. Brookes felt in a moment that she was in the presence of a woman with some purpose. The fixedness of Harriet Routh\u0027s face, the effort of a smile--for loneliness told upon her nerves now with rapidity and power--a something forced and painful in her voice, aroused an instinctive fear in Mrs. Brookes, and put her on her guard. She made a stiff bow and a movement with her body, which, when she was younger, would have been a curtsey, but was now only a duck, and asked her visitor\u0027s pleasure. \"I have called upon you, Mrs. Brookes,\" said Harriet, in a sweet and winning tone, \"in consequence of a paragraph which I have seen in a newspaper.\" It was an unfortunate beginning, for it set the old nurse instantly on her guard by arousing her suspicions, and making her resolve that the blue-eyed, sweet-spoken lady, who looked as if she had a purpose, should get nothing out of her. \"Indeed,\" she replied, very stiffly. \"Please to sit down, ma\u0027am.\" Harriet resumed her seat, and began to speak rather quickly. Mrs. Brookes looked at her steadily, immovably, having put on her spectacles for the purpose, but gave her neither encouragement nor assistance by so much as a sound or a nod. \"I am Mrs. Routh,\" she said, \"and a friend of Mr. George Dallas, Mrs. Carruthers\u0027s son. It is on his account and for his sake I have come here.\" Mrs. Brookes\u0027s black-mittened hands pressed each other more closely as they lay clasped together in her lap, but she made no sign. \"I am aware of the unfortunate circumstances which keep Mr. Dallas and his mother apart,\" continued Harriet, who maintained a watch upon the old woman as steady as her own, but more covert; \"and I am afraid he will be much distressed and alarmed if this reaches him without any preparation.\" She held out a newspaper as she spoke--a newspaper she had procured at the inn at Amherst, and pointed to the paragraph which recorded the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Carruthers of Poynings and suite for the Continent; and, in addition, the regret with which \"we\" had learned that the departure in question had been occasioned by the dangerous illness of Mrs. Carruthers. Mrs. Brookes was immensely relieved, but not altogether reassured. She had a vague idea that the business of detection was sometimes intrusted to women, and she still had her doubts of the blue-eyed, sweet-spoken lady whose face indicated a purpose, without betraying it. \"Mr. Dallas knows of his mother\u0027s illness,\" said Mrs. Brookes. \"He will not hear of it first from any newspaper.\" \"Indeed,\" said Harriet. \"I am glad to know that. I am much relieved. Mr. Dallas is so intimate with Mr. Routh, my husband, and we are so much attached to him, that anything which is of importance to him concerns us. I am on my way to Dover, and I thought I would turn out of it a little to inquire into this matter.\" \"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" said Mrs. Brookes, still unsoftened. \"May I ask if you have left your house in London?\" \"We have for the present,\" replied Harriet; \"indeed, I don\u0027t think we shall return there.\" Mrs. Brookes looked confused and distressed. \"Excuse me,\" she said, after an awkward pause, \"if I appear at all impertinent. I am George Dallas\u0027s old nurse, and more his mother\u0027s friend than her servant, and I can\u0027t be particular about other people when they are concerned. George Dallas is not as welcome here as he ought to be in his mother\u0027s house; you say you know that. If you really are Mrs. Routh, you ought to know more about him than that--more, in fact, than I do.\" \"Certainly,\" said Harriet, with unchanged sweetness of tone, and just the least gleam of colour in her cheek, showing that she was approaching her object. \"I do know a great deal more about George Dallas than you do, if, as I conclude from your words, nothing has been heard of him since his last visit to his mother.\" She paused very slightly, but Mrs. Brookes did not utter a word. \"You are quite right to be cautious, Mrs. Brookes; in such a delicate family matter as this, caution is most essential. Poor George has been so foolish, that he has laid himself open to being harmed either by enemies or injudicious friends; but I assure you, Mrs. Brookes, I am neither. I really am Mrs. Routh, and I am quite in George\u0027s confidence, and am here solely with the purpose of saving him any trouble or anxiety I can.\" \"Where is he?\" asked the old woman, suddenly, as if the question were forced upon her. \"He is at Amsterdam, in Holland,\" replied Harriet, in a frank tone, and changing her seat for one beside Mrs. Brookes, as she spoke; \"here are several letters from him. See,\" and she drew half a dozen sheets of foreign paper, closely written over, from her pocket, and put them into the old woman\u0027s hands. She beheld the letters with mingled pleasure and avoidance: they could not answer the question which tormented her, but they relieved her misgivings about her visitor. She felt assured now that she really was speaking to Mrs. Routh, and that the object of her visit was one of kindness to George. The letters were in his well-known hand; the thin paper and the postmarks satisfied her that they came from abroad. He was still out of the country, then; so far there was safety, but she must be cautious still concerning him. What if she could make Harriet the unconscious bearer of a further warning to him--a warning carefully contrived so that none but he should know its meaning, and he should understand it thoroughly? She would try. She had thought all this while she turned the letters over in her hands; then she returned them to Harriet, and said: \"Thank you, ma\u0027am. I see these are from Master George, and it\u0027s plain he has great confidence in you. He never answered a letter I sent him: it went to your house.\" \"All communications for him are addressed to Mr. Routh,\" said Harriet, \"and forwarded at once.\" \"Well, ma\u0027am, he never told me where he had gone to, or wrote a letter but one to his mother; and when that came, she was too ill to read it, or know anything about it.\" \"Indeed,\" said Harriet, in a tone of commiseration; \"she must have been taken ill just after he saw her, then?\" \"She was,\" returned Mrs. Brookes, emphatically, \"and you, ma\u0027am, know, no doubt, why she saw him, and can understand that his conduct caused her illness.\" \"Not exactly that,\" said Harriet. \"He told me all that had passed, and described his mother as full of forgiveness and hope, and he even said how well and handsome he thought her looking. George amuses us very much by constantly talking of his mother\u0027s beauty; he will be all the more distressed when he hears of her illness, now, and I really think, Mrs. Brookes, it cannot be quite fair to impute it to his conduct.\" \"It was just that, and nothing else,\" said the old woman; and her voice shook as she spoke, though she strove to control it. \"It was, indeed, ma\u0027am, and you must tell him the truth, without softening it, or making it any better. Tell him that she nearly died of the knowledge of his conduct, and that her mind is weakened, and her memory gone.\" \"Her memory gone!\" exclaimed Harriet. \"You don\u0027t mean to say it is so bad as that?\" \"I do, indeed,\" said Mrs. Brookes. \"And will you tell him exactly what I tell you? Tell him that his mother has forgotten all that led to her illness, all the fear and suspense she underwent. Of course she was frightened at what she had to do, and in suspense until it was done; but I am sure she has not forgotten him, and if he were to see her, or even be mentioned to her suddenly, it might have the worst effect. Be sure to tell him this, and that the only thing he can do to atone for the past in any way is to keep out of his mother\u0027s sight. He knows some of this already, for I wrote to him, and he knows from Mr. Carruthers that his mother is gone away.\" \"From Mr. Carruthers?\" said Harriet, in a tone of admirably simulated surprise; \"does he ever communicate with George?\" \"My master is a very just man,\" replied Mrs. Brookes, in a stately tone, \"and he would not allow his wife\u0027s son to be kept in ignorance of his mother\u0027s danger. I am sure he will send for him, wherever he may be, if there is no chance of her recovery. I don\u0027t say he would send for him sooner.\" \"Of course Mr. Carruthers has no idea of the cause of Mrs. Carruthers\u0027s illness?\" \"No, no; it was her fear of his finding out that George had been here, and what for, that brought it on; but, of course, he did not suspect anything.\" \"It is very strange,\" said Harriet, musingly; \"she seems to have borne all this business perfectly well at the time, and given way completely afterwards. It must have surprised you very much, Mrs. Brookes, though, no doubt, you understand your mistress\u0027s constitution.\" \"Yes,\" replied the old woman, dryly, and ignoring the beginning of the sentence, \"I understand my mistress\u0027s constitution.\" \"I will give your message to Mr. Dallas,\" said Harriet, rising, \"and I had better leave you our temporary address, unless, indeed, you would prefer writing to Mr. Dallas direct.\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Brookes, \"I have nothing to say. When news of his mother comes from abroad, I will send it to you.\" The old woman was constrained and miserable in her visitor\u0027s presence, but the hospitality of Poynings must be vindicated; and she felt, besides, that Mrs. Carruthers would, in other days, have been glad of an opportunity of being kind to any one who had been kind to George. So she pressed Harriet to take some refreshment and to prolong her visit. But Harriet would not touch bread or wine in the house, and told Mrs. Brookes she must return to Amherst immediately, to catch the train for Dover. \"I dined at the inn in the town,\" she said, in explanation of her refusal, \"as I had to wait awhile before I could get a fly.\" \"I hope they made you comfortable, ma\u0027am,\" said Mrs. Brookes, who had resumed, when their interview assumed a commonplace complexion, her head-servant-like manner. \"Page\u0027s people are obliging, and it is a respectable house.\" \"Very much so indeed,\" returned Harriet, carelessly. \"The town seems a clean dull sort of place. I had a funeral to look at while I waited for my dinner, and the waiter entertained me with the biography of the deceased.\" \"I had not heard of a death at Amherst,\" said Mrs. Brookes, primly. She did not like the flippant tone in which her visitor spoke. \"The servants have not been in the town this week.\" \"An estimable person--one Evans, a tailor, I believe; so the waiter said,\" Harriet returned, still more carelessly, as she took up her parasol and railway-guide, glanced covertly at the old woman\u0027s face, and moved to the door. Mrs. Brookes stood quite still for several seconds; then she followed Harriet, joined her at the red-baize door which opened into the hall, accompanied her to the great door, where a footman waited, took a respectful leave of her, and then shut herself up in her room, and remained invisible to the household for the remainder of the day. As Harriet Routh drove back to Amherst, she leaned her head wearily against the uncongenial woodwork of the fly, and summed up the results of her journey. \"Whatever the mother knows, the old woman knows. The old woman is as staunch as steel, and she will conceal her suspicions all the more tenaciously, the stronger they are; and I have strengthened them. What a clever old woman she is, and how brave! If my purpose had been what she suspected, I should have had some real difficulty in getting the information I required. It is clear that nothing is to be feared now, in this direction. Mrs. Brookes will never speak. Mrs. Carruthers is in the best possible condition for our purposes, and her son has no pretext for returning to Poynings, even if the death of the tailor had not made it quite safe for him to do so.\" She did not look out upon the fair scene through which she was passing. To her, all beauty of nature was a dead thing; she had no heart-throbs of exultation in \"the pomp that fills the summer-circuit of the hills;\" no sense of its serene loveliness reached her busy brain, or tempted her troubled brooding eyes. When she occasionally lifted them, in shifting her position, they might have been blind for any knowledge of the sunshine or the greenery that was in them. \"I will write to him,\" she went on in her thoughts, \"just what she told me to say. Poor George! It is hard to have to make him believe that he has broken his mother\u0027s heart, and turned his mother\u0027s brain. He does not deserve it, fool as he is. He is easily persuaded, fortunately. I don\u0027t feel fit for much that is not easy, now.--The letter must be sent on at once, and, if I do my part well, and this woman dies, or remains abroad--and I fancy Mr. Carruthers is not the man to bring an imbecile wife back, if he can help it--there\u0027s no reason why George should come to England again for years, that I can see.\" The driver of the fly pulled up for a minute, and letting down one of the front windows, inquired whether he was to go to the inn or to the railway station. While Harriet was answering his question by desiring him to drive to the station, and looking out of the window, a young girl on horseback, a large black Newfoundland dog galloping by her horse\u0027s side, passed the fly. The driver touched his hat respectfully, and the young lady acknowledged the salute with her whip. \"That\u0027s Miss Carruthers, ma\u0027am,\" said the man to Harriet, giving her the information in a manner which duly indicated the local importance of Miss Carruthers. Harriet looked back at the girl, and noted the golden gleam of her beautiful hair, the easy swaying of her graceful figure, the air of youth and refinement which characterized her. \"That\u0027s Miss Carruthers, is it?\" she thought. \"George has never seen her, I fancy, as he never mentioned her to me.\" She had some time to wait for the train, and she went into the waiting-room. But she found it already occupied by some cheery, chatty women and children, returning from a holiday excursion. Their idle talk, their careless laughter, jarred with her mood; the children looked askance at her, and hushed their prattle; the women drew close together on the hard high leather bench which lined the room, a solemn mockery of a divan, and moderated their tones to a prim gentility. Harriet perceived the effect her presence produced, smiled slowly, and went out again upon the platform, which she paced from end to end, until the train came up, listening idly to the raised voices and renewed laughter which reached her through the open door. When all the other passengers had taken their places, Harriet got into a carriage which had no other occupant, and so travelled up to London alone. Routh was in the house when she reached the Tavistock, and was surprised at her speedy return. She told him how the intelligence she had heard on her arrival at Amherst had simplified her task of investigation. She made her narrative as brief as possible, she spoke in a cold measured voice which had become habitual to her, and which filled Routh with intense concealed irritation; and she never looked at him until she had concluded. \"I\u0027ll post the letter from the old fellow at once then,\" said Routh; \"it\u0027s only a couple of days late, and Dallas is too careless to notice that. When you write--you\u0027d better not do it for a day or so, lest he might take it into his head to suspect you of a motive--you can tell him about our move.\" Harriet acquiesced, and changed the subject to their new residence, a furnished house in May-fair. She would go there on the morrow, she said, and arrange all their little property. Had everything been removed from South Molton-street? Everything. Routh had seen to it himself, and had employed the boy who was always about there. \"Ay,\" said Harriet, dreamily, for she was thinking of the time, gone for ever, when she had been happy in the home she had left without one regret or hope. \"What of him?\" \"Nothing that I can make out,\" answered Routh, irritably. \"But I hate the sort of half-recollection I seem to have of him. There\u0027s something in my mind connected with him, and I can\u0027t disentangle it.\" Harriet looked up at her husband in some surprise, and turned very pale. She had a painful, an indelible remembrance connected with the first time she had seen Jim Swain. But Routh knew nothing of that; so she said nothing; she made no effort to aid his memory. She would avoid the torture when she could. Besides, she was utterly weary in body and in spirits. Mr. Carruthers\u0027s letter reached George Dallas not exactly duly, indeed, but after a delay which would have astonished and exasperated the writer, had he known it, to the last degree. Stewart Routh and Harriet were very much superior to George Dallas in many mental attributes, and in particular in cunning; but they were incapable of understanding the young man on certain points. One of these points was his love for his mother, with its concomitants of remorse, repentance, and resolution. Not comprehending this mixed feeling, they made a serious miscalculation. The day or two which Harriet allowed to intervene before she wrote the letter which was to prolong George\u0027s absence, exactly sufficed to bring him to England. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90390.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
