{"id":39807,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. A DILEMMA.","content":"South Molton-street had apparently a strong attraction for Mr. James Swain. Perhaps he found it a profitable and productive situation in point of odd and early jobs, perhaps he had some less professional reason for frequenting it. However that may be, the fact existed that no day passed without his tousled head and imperfectly clad form making their appearance in the street two or three times between dawn and dark. He would hang about the precincts of the house in which Routh and Harriet lodged, and evinced an extraordinary preference for the archway in the vicinity as a dining-room. He might have been seen at irregular hours devouring saveloys, polonies, or, when jobs odd or even were not plentiful, hunches of bread and cheese, within the shelter of the archway, in the most unsophisticated attitudes, and with great apparent enjoyment. Mr. James Swain\u0027s face was not free from the underlying expression of care and anxiety which is always to be found by the careful observer in the countenance of the London street-boy, but it had more than the usual complement of sauciness, cunning, readiness, and impudence. The boy had quite an attraction for Mrs. Routh, who would smile at him when she passed him in the street, nod pleasantly to him occasionally from her window, when his business or pleasure led him to lounge past the house before she had left her bedroom of a morning, and who frequently sent him of errands, for the doing of which she rewarded him with a liberality which appeared to him astounding munificence. Mr. James Swain was of a temperament to feel kindness, neglected street-boy though he was, and he had been wonderfully impressed by the womanly compassion which had spoken to him in Harriet\u0027s gentle tones on the morning of their first meeting, and had looked out of all the trouble and foreboding in her blue eyes. His interest in the Routh household, however, antedated that event, and received not only an additional access, but a fresh colouring from it, and an acute observer, supposing one to exist for whom so mean a matter as the mental condition of a street-boy, very vulgar indeed, and without a particle of sentimental interest about him, should possess any attraction, would have discerned that a struggle of some sort was going on in the mind of the frequenter of South Molton-street, and seeker of odd jobs. Routh, also, was not without interest for Jim Swain. Perhaps he watched him even more closely than he watched Harriet, but if he did, it was with totally different feelings. Routh had considerable powers of self-command, and could always be civil and apparently good-tempered, no matter what his real humour might be, when it accorded with his interests to be so. But he was not a man to treat inferiors with courtesy, or to refrain from rudeness and brutality where they were safe, and unlikely to do him any discredit. Consequently, servants and other recipients of the outpourings of his temper hated him with a vivid cordiality. Jim, the street-boy, had been employed by him occasionally, and had formed, apart from certain other knowledge he had gained concerning Mr. Stewart Routh, the worst opinion of that gentleman\u0027s disposition and character. \"He\u0027s a bad \u0027un, anyhow,\" the boy muttered, as he watched Mr. Routh letting himself into the house he inhabited with his latch-key, having previously taken a handful of letters from the postman at the door. \"An ill-lookin\u0027 dog, too. Scowled at the letters as if he was a-goin\u0027 to eat \u0027em. P\u0027raps they\u0027re love letters. I shouldn\u0027t wonder, now, as the lady is a pinin\u0027 for some \u0027un else, and he\u0027s jealous, and gets hold on all the letters to catch her out.\" This bright idea, which Jim Swain derived from his habitual reading of penny romances, devoted to the delineation of the tender passion, afforded him considerable gratification, and he had already consumed several minutes and a cold sausage while turning it over in his mind, when Harriet Routh came out of the house, and passed him, as he leaned against the wall under the archway. She was very pale and quite absorbed in thought, so that, though the lad respectfully pulled a tuft of his tousled hair in salutation, she did not perceive his presence. \"She\u0027s not like the same woman,\" mused Mr. James Swain; \"she\u0027s gone as white as anything; looks just as if she\u0027d had to git her own livin\u0027 for ever so long, and found it precious hard to git, too. If he\u0027s jealous of her, and a ill treatin\u0027 of her, blowed if I won\u0027t peach! No, no, I won\u0027t, though, leastways not yet, \u0027cause I can\u0027t without lettin\u0027 out on myself too; but,\" said the boy with a long look which softened the cunning of his face strangely, \"I would like to know as she was happier than I think she is.\" In the wide city of London there was not another human being to feel any such wish in connection with Harriet Routh. She was quite alone. She had so willed it, and circumstances had aided her inclination and her resolve. In the life which her husband had adopted, and she had accepted, intimacies, friendships, were impossible. The only relation between them and their kind was the relation between the swindler and his dupes, always a merely \"business\" connection, and generally very brief in its duration. Harriet had not a female friend in the world. Perhaps she would not have had one under any circumstances; she was not a woman to cherish sentiment; the one love of her life was an overmastering passion, which had absorbed all lesser feelings; and the secretiveness and reserve, which were large elements in her moral nature, would have been inimical to such association, which, above all, needs gushingness for its satisfactory development. Her husband\u0027s male friends saw her seldom, and were not observant or interested in the health, spirits, or appearance of any but themselves; so there was no one but the street-boy to note the change that had passed upon her. Routh, indeed, observed it, with the bitter, selfish impatience of his character, and silently resented it. But only silently; he made no comment, and Harriet, for the first time, failed to interpret his feelings. She was changed. Changed in face, in manner, in voice, in the daily habits of her life. The light had faded from her blue eyes, and with it their colour had paled. Her cheek had lost its roundness, and there was something set and stony in her face. It had been calm, now it was rigid. Her voice, still low and refined, was no longer musical, and her words were rare. Personal habits are tenacious, and rarely yield, even to strong mental excitement, or under the pressure of anxious care, and Harriet, always neat and careful in her simple dress, was neat and careful still. But a close observer would have marked a change even in this respect. She cared for her looks no longer. An ill-assorted ribbon, or ill-chosen colour, would once have been impossible to Harriet Routh; but it was all the same to her now. What were the symptoms of the moral change that had passed upon her as distinctly as the physical? They were rather those of intensification than of alteration. Her determination had assumed a sternness which had not before marked it, her identification of herself with Routh had become more than ever complete. The intensity of the passion with which she loved him was hardly capable of increase, but its quiet was gone. The pliable ease, the good-fellowship, the frank equality of their companionship had departed; and though her attention to his interests, her participation in his schemes, were as active and unceasing as ever, they were no longer spontaneous, they were the result of courageous and determined effort, sustained as only a woman can sustain effort which costs her acute and unrelenting suffering. She had been much alone of late. Routh had been much and profitably occupied. The affairs of the new company were progressing favourably, and Routh\u0027s visits to Flinders were frequent and well received. He had other things of the sort on hand, and his finances were in a flourishing condition. He was on the road to success, after the fashion of modern successes, and if his luck did not change, all the respectability which attaches to a fortunate speculation was on the cards for Stewart Routh. No restoration to his former place was possible, indeed; but Routh cared nothing for that, would, perhaps, not have accepted such a restoration had it been within his reach. Struggle, scheming, shifts, and the excitement consequent thereon, were essential to him now; he liked them; the only game he could play with any relish was a desperate one. To what extent he had played it was known only to himself and Harriet, and he was beginning to be afraid of his confederate. Not afraid of her trustworthiness, of her fidelity, of her staunch and unshrinking devotion; Stewart Routh was just as confident, as of the fact of his existence, that his wife would cheerfully have given her life for him, as she gave it to him, but the man\u0027s nature was essentially base, and the misused strength, the perverted nobility of hers crushed and frightened him. He had not felt it so much while they were very poor, while all their schemes and shifts were on a small scale, while his every-day comforts depended on her active management and unfailing forethought. But now, when he had played for a great stake and won it, when a larger career was open before him--a career from which he felt she would shrink, and into which he could never hope to force her--he grew desperately afraid of Harriet. Desperately tired of her also. He was a clever man, but she was cleverer than he. He was a man of strong passions, ungovernable, save by the master-passion, interest. She had but one, love; but it was stronger than all his put together, and told to do their worst, and his shallow nature shrank from the unknown depths of hers. She loved him so entirely that there had never been a question of rule between them; but Routh was a wise man in his way, and he knew in his heart he could rule Harriet only by love, and love which was perfectly genuine and true, should the time ever come in which a distant separation of opinion and will between them should make it necessary for him to try. But he had a clear appreciation of his wife\u0027s intellect also, and he knew thoroughly well that he could not deceive her with any counterfeit presentment--the love which should rule her must be real. This was precisely what he had not to produce when required. He had loved her after his fashion for so long that he was rather surprised by his own constancy: but it would have been difficult for Stewart Routh to go on loving any one but himself always, and Harriet was so much superior to him in strength, firmness, and disinterestedness, that her very superiority was an element of destruction for the love of such a man as he. In all that concerned the business of Stewart Routh\u0027s life, Harriet\u0027s conduct was still the same as before--she was still industrious and invaluable to him. But the occupations which had filled her leisure hours were all neglected now, the lonely time was no more lightened by the pursuits which her early education and her natural tastes had endeared and rendered habitual to her. One of two moods now possessed her, either uncontrollable restlessness or absorbed brooding. She would start off, when Routh had left her, and walk for hours through the crowded thoroughfares, out into the suburbs of London, or up and down the most distant and less frequented parts of the Parks, returning home weary and footsore, but with the torturing sense of restlessness unsubdued. Or, when she was alone, she would sit for hours, not in a selected position of comfort, but anywhere, on the first seat that came in her way, her head drooping, her eyes fixed and vacant, her hands closely clasped and lying in her lap, her fair low brow contracted by a stern and painful frown. From either of these two moods she rarely varied; and even in Routh\u0027s presence, one or the other would master her at times. It chanced that on the day when Jim Swain had seen Routh return to his lodgings, and take some letters from the postman, the restless fit had come very strongly upon Harriet, and she had gone to her room to dress herself for walking, when Routh unexpectedly returned. He went into the sitting-room, and concluding she would be down-stairs presently, waited for her, reading the letters in his hand, frowningly the while. But Harriet had passed quietly down the stairs and gone out, without re-entering the sitting-room, and Routh waited in vain. At length he sought her in her room, and not finding her, he angrily rang the bell, and asked the servant if she knew anything about her. She did not, and Routh dismissed her, and began to stride about the room, uttering very uncalled-for objurgations on women who were never in the way when they were wanted. As he passed the window, his eye fell upon Jim Swain tranquilly eating bread and cheese, as he leaned against the opposite railings. Routh looked at him again more closely, and again; finally, he took up his hat, went down-stairs, out of the door, and across the street, close up to the boy. \"Hollo, you sir!\" he addressed him roughly. \"What are you doing here?\" Mr. James Swain eyed his questioner with no pleasant or grateful expression of countenance, and replied, curtly: \"Nothin\u0027!\" \"What brings you here, then?\" continued Routh. \"I ain\u0027t a doin\u0027 you any harm, am I?\" answered the boy, all his native impudence brought out in a moment by the overbearing manner of Routh. \"It ain\u0027t your street, I believe, nor yet your archway, as I knows on; and if I chooses to odd job on this here lay, I don\u0027t hurt you, do I?\" The saucy manner of the lad did not anger Routh; he hardly seemed to notice it, but appeared to be entirely possessed by some struggling remembrance not of a pleasing kind, if his expression afforded any correct clue to it. \"Have you seen a lady come out of No. 60 since you have been about here?\" he asked, passing by the boy\u0027s saucy remarks as if he had not heard them. \"Yes, I have. I saw the lady as lives there, not two minutes after you came in. She went that way.\" And he pointed down the street. \"Had she anything in her hand? Did she look as if she was going for a walk, or out shopping?\" \"She hadn\u0027t no basket or bag, and she warn\u0027t partickler dressed; not as nice as she\u0027s dressed sometimes. I should say,\" continued Mr. Jim Swain, with an air of wisdom and decision, \"as she was going for a constitootional, all by herself, and not to shop nor nothin\u0027.\" Routh\u0027s attention had wandered from the boy\u0027s words, and was fixed upon his face. \"Have I ever seen you before?\" he asked him, abruptly. A sudden rush of colour dyed Mr. James Swain\u0027s face, even, through the varnish of dirt which hid its surface, as he replied, with a little less than his customary boldness: \"Yes, sir, you\u0027ve seen me, though in course you ain\u0027t likely to remember it. You\u0027ve giv\u0027 me many a penny, and a sixpence too, and the lady.\" Again Routh looked steadily, but covertly, at him under his thick brows. He was evidently eager to ask him some question, but he refrained, restrained by some powerful motive. Jim looked uneasily up and down the street, moved his feet about restlessly, turned his ragged pockets inside out, letting loose a multitude of dirty crumbs, and displayed a fidgety inclination to get away from South Molton-street. \"Well,\" said Routh, rousing himself from his abstraction, \"we\u0027re going to move next week, and you can come and do the odd jobs for us, if you like.\" \"Thankee, sir,\" said Jim, who was very respectful now, and touched his ragged cap as if he had quite altered his opinion of the speaker. \"What day shall I come, sir?\" \"I don\u0027t exactly know,\" said Routh; \"you can call and ask the lady.\" And then he gave the lad a shilling, to Jim Swain\u0027s intense surprise, and, crossing the street, once more let himself in at the door of No. 60. Having reached the sitting-room, Stewart Routh sat down by the window and fell into a fit of musing as deep as those in which Harriet Routh passed hours away. Mr. James Swain went briskly down the street, pleasantly conscious that the unexpected windfall of the shilling had released him from the labours of his calling for the day, and determined to proceed at once to lay it out to the greatest advantage. \"Wotever is he up to now?\" Thus ran the street-boy\u0027s thoughts. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s jealous, or he wouldn\u0027t be coming home unexpected, and a watchin\u0027 of her like that. Ain\u0027t he a brute just? And a willin too? Well, I\u0027m glad I ain\u0027t sure--I\u0027m very glad I ain\u0027t sure.\" With this enigmatical phrase, Mr. James Swain abandoned his mental colloquy, and directed his thoughts to more immediately personal matters. Routh was still sitting by the window when Harriet returned, and with the first glance at his face she saw that something new had occurred. \"I did not expect you home until six o\u0027clock,\" she said, as she laid aside her bonnet, and stood by his side, laying her hand tenderly upon his shoulder. \"No,\" he returned; \"I came home to get some papers for Flinders about the Tunbridge Canal business; but you have them, Harry, and you were out.\" \"Well,\" she said, calmly, looking at him with questioning eyes. \"What has happened, Stewart?\" \"This,\" he returned, very slowly, and without meeting her gaze. \"As I came in I met the postman with this letter. Read it, and tell me what is to be done.\" She sat down close beside him, and took the letter he held towards her. It was addressed to George Dallas, to the care of Routh, and it was, in fact, the letter which Mr. Carruthers had written to his stepson prior to his departure from Poynings. As Harriet read, her right hand sought her husband\u0027s, and held it tightly. The old look of quiet resolution, the old expression of confident resource, came into her face. She read the paper twice before she spoke. \"Stewart,\" she said, \"this is only another head of the hydra, and we had counted them, had we not? What we have to decide is, whether this letter shall be suppressed, or whether it must be forwarded to George Dallas. At first sight, I see no possibility of suppressing it without infinite danger, but this is only first sight, and we may see more clearly afterwards.\" \"Dallas has never said anything to you about letters from his mother, has he?\" asked Routh. \"No,\" replied Harriet, \"not since his second letter, when he said he supposed she was testing his repentance and good conduct, and that he would not write until he could give her some proof of both.\" \"Get the old woman\u0027s letter, and let us read it again.\" Harriet went to her writing-table, opened a drawer, and took a paper from its recesses. It was the letter which Mrs. Brookes had written to George Dallas. The two read it carefully, and Harriet spoke first. \"We can only conjecture the meaning of this, Stewart; but, as I make it out, it means that the proceedings at the--the inquest\"--she paused almost imperceptibly, then went on, in a steady tone--\"awakened his mother\u0027s fears. It was lucky he told us the story of his mother\u0027s anxiety about his coat, or we should have failed to catch the clue. Now I read the riddle thus: Mrs. Carruthers has been dangerously ill in consequence of the shock of the discovery, but she has not betrayed her knowledge or suspicions. A good deal of time has been gained, and under any circumstances that is a priceless advantage. The question now is, can any more time be gained? Can George Dallas be kept in ignorance of the appearances against him any longer? The suppression of the old woman\u0027s letter was an easy matter. It is ill-written, you see, as servants\u0027 letters usually are, indistinctly addressed, and generally unimportant. But a letter written by Mr. Carruthers of Poynings is quite another matter. It must come out, some time or other, that it was not received, and he is precisely the man to investigate the matter to the utmost. No, no, the letter must be sent to Dallas.\" She spoke firmly, but her eyes were dreamy and distant. Routh knew their expression, and that some expedient, some resolve, was shaping itself in her mind. He sat quite silent until she spoke again. \"The first thing we have to do is to ascertain with all possible exactitude the real condition of Mrs. Carruthers, where she is at present, and whether we are right in supposing her fears were excited. This letter is not calculated to bring George home, I think. Of course, if it had reached him before they left Poynings, he would have come home at once; but, see, Mr. Carruthers writes on the 10th, and says they are to start on the 11th. This is the 13th. What is the post-mark?\" \"Dover,\" said Routh, handing her the envelope. \"Posted after they left England, no doubt,\" said Harriet. \"Stewart, there is just one thing to be done. Let us move from this at once. It is only doing so a little sooner than we had intended. Then, if we decide on suppressing the letter, its loss may be accounted for, even to the satisfaction of Mr. Carruthers. This, while we consider what must be done.\" \"Yes,\" said Routh, \"I think that will be wise; but I do not see my way out of the danger of his return, if he returns when he has received the letter. He will go down to Amherst at once, and will discover the suspicion, and at once take steps to clear himself of it.\" \"Perhaps so,\" said Harriet, and her face darkened, \"but he may not find that so easy. I hope he will not put himself into the danger; but if he does--\" She paused, and looked thoughtfully into her husband\u0027s face, while a quick shudder crept over her. He saw the look in her eyes, he felt the quiver in her hand, and frowned darkly. \"Don\u0027t take to melodrama, Harriet, it\u0027s so unlike you, and doesn\u0027t suit you. Besides, it\u0027s too late in the day for that kind of thing now.\" She took no notice of the ungracious speech, but still stood looking thoughtfully at him. He rose, letting her hand drop from his shoulder, and walked up and down the room. \"Stewart,\" she said gently, \"you must not be impatient with me if I am not as ready of resource as I was. However, I think I see what ought to be done in this emergency, and I am quite sure I can do it. I will go to Amherst, find out the true state of things there, see the old woman at Poynings, who will gladly receive me as a friend of George Dallas; and then, and then only, can we decide whether this letter is to reach him or not.\" \"By Jove, Harry, that\u0027s a splendid idea!\" said Routh; \"and there can\u0027t be any risk in it, for Dallas would take your doing it as the greatest kindness. You not so ready of resource as you were? You\u0027re more so, my girl--you\u0027re more so.\" There was a little wonder in the look she turned upon him, a little surprise at the lightness of his tone, but not a ray of the pleasure which his perverted praise had once given her. \"This is the best thing to do,\" she said, gravely, \"and I will do it at once. I will go to-morrow morning.\" \"And I will get our traps moved, and put up at the Tavistock till you come back. You can pack this evening, I suppose, Harry?\" \"O yes,\" she answered. \"I shall be glad of the occupation.\" \"And you\u0027ll do it more easily without me,\" said Routh, whom no crisis of events, however serious, could render indifferent to his individual comforts, and to whom the confusion of packing was an image of horror and disgust; \"so I shall dine out, and leave you to your own devices. Here, you had better lock these up.\" He took the letters from a table on which she had laid them as she spoke, and held them towards her. She drew a step nearer to him, took the papers from his hand; then suddenly let them drop upon the floor, and flung her arms wildly round Routh\u0027s neck. \"Harriet, Harriet,\" he said, \"what\u0027s this?\" as he strove to lift her face which she held pressed against his breast with terrible force. She answered him with a groan--a groan so full of anguish, that his callousness was not proof against it. \"My love, my darling, my brave girl, don\u0027t, don\u0027t!\" was all he could say, as he bent his head over her and held her tightly to him. For several moments she stood thus; then she lifted her white face, put up her hands, and drew his face down to hers, kissed him with kisses which thrilled him with an unknown sense of fear and doom, and, instantly releasing, left him. Mr. James Swain got the promised odd job in South Molton-street sooner than he had expected it; for, calling at No. 60, according to Mr. Routh\u0027s instructions, to ask the lady when his services would be required, he was informed that she had gone away, and he was to carry down the boxes to be conveyed to their destination in the van then standing at the door. Jim performed his duty with a perturbed spirit. \"Gone away, is she?\" he said over and over again. \"Now I should like to know where she\u0027s gone, and wot for. I hope he ain\u0027t be up to nothin\u0027 agin her; but I don\u0027t trust him, and I ain\u0027t a goin\u0027 to lose sight of him for longer than I can help, if I knows it, until she\u0027s safe back somewheres.\" \"That funeral is largely attended for a small town,\" said Harriet Routh to the waiter at the inn at Amherst, who was laying the cloth for her dinner. She was sitting by a window on the ground-floor, and idly watching the decorous procession as it passed along the main street, to the huge admiration of gaping boys and gossiping nursemaids. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" replied the man, gladly seizing the opportunity of approaching the window and having a peep on his own account. \"He was very much respected, was old Mr. Evans; no one in the town more so. He gave the best of measures, and used the best of mater\u0027als; and a charitabler man, nor a constanter at meetin\u0027, though uncommon deaf latterly, ain\u0027t in Amherst.\" Harriet looked inquiringly at the speaker. \"I beg your pardon, ma\u0027am, you\u0027re a stranger, of course, and don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about poor old Evans. He were a tailor, ma\u0027am, at Amherst, man and boy, for fifty year and more, and got a deal of custom, which they do say no tailor here won\u0027t have for the future, seeing as they can\u0027t compete with the Sydenham suits.\" Harriet made no comment upon the man\u0027s little discourse, and he left the room. When she was alone, she smiled a smile not good to see, and said, half aloud: \"I remember how they used to talk about Providence and providential interventions on behalf of the good, long ago, when I used to fancy I believed in Providence, and when I certainly did believe in the existence of the good. I wonder what these people would call this? If it is a providential intervention, the theory has two sides.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90389.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
