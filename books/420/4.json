{"id":39794,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV IN THE BALANCE.","content":"Not one wo?rd came from Mrs. Carruthers for full six weeks. The hope which had sprung up in George Dallas\u0027s breast after the interview with his mother in the housekeeper\u0027s room had gone through the various stages common to unfulfilled desires in men of sanguine temperaments. It had been very bright at first, and when no letter came after the lapse of a week, it had begun to grow dim, and then he had endeavoured to reason with himself that the very fact of no letter coming ought to be looked upon as a good sign, as showing that \"something was doing.\" Then the absence of any news caused his hope to flicker until the recollection of the old adage, that \"no news was good news,\" made it temporarily bright again; then as the time for payment of the renewed bill grew nearer and nearer, so did George Dallas\u0027s prospects become gloomier and yet more gloomy, and at last the light of hope went out, and the darkness of despair reigned paramount in his bosom. What could his mother be about? She must have pretended that she had some bill of her own to pay, and that the money was immediately required; old Carruthers must have questioned her about it, and there must have been a row; she must have tried to \"collar\" the amount out of the housekeeping--no! the sum was too large; that was absurd! She had old friends--people who knew and loved her well, and she must have asked some of them to lend it to her, and probably been refused; old friends always refuse to lend money. She must have tried--confound it all, he did not know, he could not guess what she had tried! All he did know, to his sorrow, was, that she had not sent the money; all he knew, to his joy, was, that though he was constantly seeing Stewart Routh, that worthy lad, as yet, uttered no word of discontent at its non-appearance. Not he! In the hand which Stewart Routh was at that moment playing in the greater game of life, the card representing a hundred and forty pounds was one on which he bestowed very little attention. It might, or it might not, form part of the odd trick, either way: but it had very little influence on his strategy and finesse. There were times when a five-pound note might have turned his chance, but this was not one of them. Driven into a corner, pressed for the means of discharging paltry debts, harassed by dunning creditors, Stewart Routh would have needed and claimed the money due to him by George Dallas. Present circumstances were more favourable, and he only needed George Dallas\u0027s assistance in his schemes. For, Stewart Routh\u0027s measures for raising money were of all kinds and of all dimensions; the elephant\u0027s trunk of his genius could pick up a five-pound-note bet from a flat at écarté, or could move the lever of a gigantic city swindle. And he was \"in for a large thing\" just at this time. Men attending professionally at the betting-ring at the great steeplechase then coming off, noticed Routh\u0027s absence with wonder, and though he occasionally looked in at two or three of the second-rate sporting clubs of which he was a member, he was listless and preoccupied. If he took a hand at cards, though from mere habit he played closely and cautiously, yet he made no great points, and was by no means, as usual, the dashing Paladin round whose chair men gathered thickly, and whose play they backed cheerily. No! The paltry gains of the dice-box and cards paled before the glamour of the fortune to be made in companies and shares; the elephant\u0027s trunk was to show its strength now, as well as its dexterity, and the genius which had hitherto been confined to \"bridging\" a pack of cards, or \"securing\" a die, talking over a flat or winning money of a greenhorn, was to have its vent in launching a great City Company. Of this scheme Dallas knew nothing. A disinherited man, with neither name nor influence, would have been utterly useless; but he was reserved for possible contingencies. Routh was always sending to him to call, always glad to see him when he called, and never plagued him with allusions to his debt. But in their interviews nothing but mere generalities were discussed, and George noticed that he always received a hint to go whenever Mr. Deane was announced. But although Stewart Routh was seen but seldom in his usual haunts, he was by no means inactive or neglectful of his own interests. Day after day he spent several hours in the City, diligently engaged in the formation of his new Company, a grand undertaking for working some newly-discovered silver mines in the Brazils; and day after day were his careful scheming, his elaborate plotting, his vivacious daring, and his consummate knowledge of the world, rewarded by the steady progress which the undertaking made. The temporary offices in Tokenhouse-yard were besieged with inquirers; good brokers with City names of high standing offered their services; splendid reports came from the engineers, who had been sent out to investigate the state of the mines. Only one thing was wanting, and that was capital; capital, by hook or by crook, Mr. Stewart Routh must have, and was determined to have. If the affair were to be launched, the brokers said, the next week must see it done; and the difficulty of raising the funds for the necessary preliminary expenses was becoming day by day more and more palpable and insurmountable to Stewart Routh. The interval of time that had witnessed so much activity on the part of Mr. Stewart Routh, and had advanced his schemes close to a condition of imminent crisis, had been productive of nothing new or remarkable in the existence of George Dallas. That is to say, on the surface of it. He was still leading the desultory life of a man who, with an intellectual and moral nature capable of better deeds and nobler aspirations, is incurably weak, impulsive, and swayed by a love of pleasure; a man incapable of real self-control, and with whom the gratification of the present is potent, above all suggestions or considerations of the contingencies of the future. He worked a little, and his talent was beginning to tell on the popularity of the paper for which he worked, The Mercury, and on the perceptions of its proprietors. George Dallas was a man in whose character there were many contradictions. With much of the fervour of the poetic temperament, with its sensuousness and its sensitiveness, he had a certain nonchalance about him, a fitful indifference to external things, and a spasmodic impatience of his surroundings. This latter was apt to come over him at times when he was apparently merriest, and it had quite as much to do with his anxiety to get his debt to Routh discharged, and to set himself free from Routh, as any moral sense of the danger of keeping such company, or any moral consciousness of the waste of his life, and the deterioration of his character. George Dallas had no knowledge of the true history of Routh\u0027s career; of the blacker shades of his character he was entirely ignorant. In his eyes Routh was a clever man and a good-for-nothing, a \"black sheep\" like himself, a sheep for whose blackness Dallas (as he did in his own case) held circumstances, the white sheep, anything and everything except the man himself, to blame. He was dimly conscious that his associate was stronger than he, stronger in will, stronger in knowledge of men, and somehow, though he never defined or acknowledged the feeling to himself, he mistrusted and feared him. He liked him, too, he felt grateful to him for his help; he did not discern the interested motives which actuated him, and, indeed, they were but small, and would by no means have accounted for all Routh\u0027s proceedings towards Dallas. Nor is it necessary that they should; a villain is not, therefore, altogether precluded from likings, or even the feebler forms of friendship, and Dallas was not simply silly and egotistical when he believed that Routh felt kindly and warmly towards him. Still, whether a merciful and occult influence was at work within him or the tide of his feelings had been turned by his stolen interview with his mother, by his being brought into such positive contact with her life and its conditions, and having been made to realize the bitterness he had infused into it, it were vain to inquire. Whatever his motives, however mixed their nature or confused their origin, he was filled, whenever he was out of Routh\u0027s presence, and looked his life in the face, with an ardent longing to \"cut the whole concern,\" as he phrased it in his thoughts. And Harriet?--for the \"whole concern\" included her, and he was forced to remember--Harriet, the only woman whose society he liked--Harriet, whom he admired with an admiration as pure and respectful as he could have felt for her, had he met her in the least equivocal, nay, even in the most exalted position. Well, he would be very sorry to lose Harriet, but, after all, she cared only for Routh; and he was dangerous. \"I must turn over a new leaf, for her sake\" (he meant for his mother\u0027s); \"and I can\u0027t turn it while they are at my elbows.\" From which conviction on the part of George it is sufficiently evident that Routh and Harriet had ample reason to apprehend that Dallas, on whom they desired to retain a hold, for more reasons than one, was slipping through their fingers. George Dallas was more than usually occupied with such thoughts one morning, six weeks after his unsuccessful visit to Poynings. He had been very much with Routh and Deane during this period, and yet he had begun to feel aware, with a jealous and suspicious sense of it, too, that he really knew very little of what they had been about. They met in the evening, in pursuit of pleasure, and they abandoned themselves to it; or they met at Routh\u0027s lodgings, and Dallas surrendered himself to the charm which Harriet\u0027s society always had for him. But he had begun to observe of late that there was no reference to the occupation of the earlier part of the day, and that while there was apparently a close bond of mutual confidence or convenience between Routh and Deane, there was some under-current of mutual dislike. \"If my mother can only get me out of this scrape, and I can get the Piccadilly people to take my serial,\" said George Dallas to himself one morning, when April was half gone, and \"the season\" was half come, \"I shall get away somewhere, and go in for work in earnest.\" He looked, ruefully enough, round the wretched little bed-room, at whose small window he was standing, as he spoke; and he thought impatiently of his debt to his coarse shrewish landlady, and of the small liabilities which hampered him as effectually as the great one. It was later than his usual hour of rising, and he felt ill and despondent: not anxious to face the gay, rich, busy world outside, and still less inclined for his own company and waking thoughts in the shabby little den he tenanted. A small room, a mere apology for a sitting-room, was reached through a rickety folding-door, which no human ingenuity could contrive to keep shut if any one opened the other door leading to the narrow passage, and the top of the steep dark staircase. Through this yawning aperture George lounged disconsolately into the little room beyond, eyeing with strong disfavour the preparations for his breakfast, which preparations chiefly consisted of a dirty table-cloth and a portion of a stale loaf, popularly known as a \"heel.\" But his gaze travelled further, and brightened; for on the cracked and blistered wooden chimney-piece lay a letter in his mother\u0027s hand. He darted at it, and opened it eagerly, then held it for a moment in his hand unread. His face turned very pale, and he caught his breath once or twice as he muttered: \"Suppose it\u0027s to say she can\u0027t do anything at all.\" But the fear, the suspense were over with the first glance at his mother\u0027s letter. She wrote: \"Poynings, 13th April, 1861. \"My Dear George,--I have succeeded in procuring you the money, for which you tell me you have such urgent need. Perhaps if I admired, and felt disposed to act up to, a lofty standard of sentimental generosity, I should content myself with making this announcement, and sending you the sum which you assure me will release you from your difficulties, and enable you to commence the better life on which you have led me to hope you are resolved. But not only do the circumstances under which I have contrived to get this money for you make it impossible for me to act in this way, but I consider I should be very wrong, and quite wanting in my duty, if I failed to make you understand, at the cost of whatever pain to myself, the price I have had to pay for the power of aiding you. \"You have occasioned me much suffering, George. You, my only child, to whom I looked in the first dark days of my early bereavement, with such hope and pride as I cannot express, and as only a mother can understand--you have darkened my darkness and shadowed my joy, you have been the source of my deepest anxiety, though not the less for that, as you well know, the object of my fondest love. I don\u0027t write this to reproach you--I don\u0027t believe in the efficacy of reproach; but merely to tell you the truth--to preface another truth, the full significance of which it may prove very beneficial to you to understand. Sorrow I have known through you, and shame I have experienced for you. You have cost me many tears, whose marks can never be effaced from my face or my heart; you have cost me infinite disappointment, bitterness, heart-sickness, and domestic wretchedness; but now, for the first time, you cost me shame on my own account. Many and great as my faults and shortcomings have been through life, deceit was equally abhorrent to my nature and foreign to my habits. But for you, George, for your sake, to help you in this strait, to enable you to release yourself from the trammels in which you are held, I have descended to an act of deceit and meanness, the recollection of which must for ever haunt me with a keen sense of humiliation. I retain enough of my former belief in you, my son, to hope that what no other argument has been able to effect, this confession on my part may accomplish, and that you, recognizing the price at which I have so far rescued you, may pause, and turn from, the path leading downward into an abyss of ruin, from which no effort of mine could avail to snatch you. I have procured the money you require, by an expedient suggested to me accidentally, just when I had begun utterly to despair of ever being able to accomplish my ardent desire, by a conversation which took place at dinner between Mr. Carruthers and his family solicitor, Mr. Tatham. The conversation turned on a curious and disgraceful family story which had come under his knowledge lately. I need not trouble you to read, nor myself to write, its details; you will learn them when I see you, and give you the money; and I do not doubt, I dare not doubt, George, that you will feel all I expect you to feel when you learn to how deliberate, laborious, and mean a deception I have descended for your sake. I can never do the same thing again; the expedient is one that it is only possible to use once, and which is highly dangerous even in that one instance. So, if even you were bad and callous enough to calculate upon a repetition of it, which I could not believe, my own dear boy, I am bound to tell you that it never could be. Unless Mr. Carruthers should change his mind, consequent upon an entire, radical, and most happy change in your conduct, all pecuniary assistance on my part must be entirely impossible. I say this, thus strongly, out of the kindest and best motives towards you. Your unexpected appearance and application agitated and distressed me very much; not but that the sight of you, under any circumstances, must always give me pleasure, however closely pursued and overtaken by pain. For several days I was so completely upset by the recollection of your visit, and the strong and desperate necessity that existed for repressing all traces of such feelings, that I was unable to think over the expedients by which I might procure the money you required. Then as I began to grow a little quieter, accident gave me the hint upon which I have acted secretly and safely. Come down to Poynings in three days from this time. Mr. Carruthers is at present away at an agricultural meeting at York, and I can see you at Amherst, without difficulty or danger. Go to the town, but not to the inn. Wait about until you see my carriage. This is the 13th. I shall expect you on the 17th, by which day I hope to have the money ready for you. \"And now, my dear boy, how shall I end this letter? What shall I say? What can I say that I have not said again and again, and with sadly little effect, as you will not deny! But I forbear, and I hope. A feeling that I cannot define, an instinct, tells me that a crisis in my life is near. And what can such a crisis in my life mean, except in reference to you, my beloved and only child? In your hands lies all the future, all the disposition of the \u0027few and evil\u0027 years which remain to me. How are you going to deal with them? Is the love, which can never fail or falter, to be tried and wounded to the end, George, or is it to see any fruition in this world? Think over this question, my son, and let me read in your face, when I see you, that the answer is to be one of hope. You are much changed, George, the bitterness is succeeding the honey in your mouth; you are \u0027giving your strength for that which is not meat, and your labour for that which satisfieth not,\u0027 and though all the lookers-on at such a career as yours can see, and always do see, its emptiness and insufficiency plainly, what does their wisdom, their experience, avail? But if wisdom and experience come to yourself, that makes all the difference. If you have learned, and I venture to hope you have, that the delusive light is but a \u0027Will of the Wisp,\u0027 you will cease to pursue it. Come to me, then, my boy. I have kept my word to you, at such a cost as you can hardly estimate, seeing that no heart can impart all its bitterness to another; will you keep yours to me? \"C. L. Carruthers.\" \"What does she mean? What can she mean?\" George Dallas asked himself this question again and again, as he stood looking at the letter in his hand. \"What has she done? A mean and deliberate deceit--some dishonourable transaction? My mother could not do anything deserving to be so called. It is impossible. Even if she could contemplate such a thing, she would not know how to set about it. God bless her!\" He sat down by the table, drew the dingy Britannia-metal teapot over beside his cup, and sat with his hand resting idly upon the distorted handle, still thinking less of the relief which the letter had brought him, than of the mysterious terms in which it was couched. \"She can\u0027t have got it out of Carruthers without his knowing anything about it?\" he mused. \"No; besides, getting it from him at all, is precisely the thing she told me she could not do. Well, I must wait to know; but how good of her to get it! Who\u0027s the fellow who says a man can have only one mother? By Jove, how right he is!\" Then George ate his breakfast hastily, and, putting the precious letter in his breast-pocket, went to Routh\u0027s lodgings. \"I dare say they\u0027re not up,\" he thought, as he knocked at the door, and patiently waited the lingering approach of the slipshod servant. \"Routh was as late as I was last night, and I know she always sits up for him.\" He was right; they had not yet appeared in the sitting-room, and he had time for a good deal of walking up and down, and much cogitation over his mother\u0027s letter, before Harriet appeared. She was looking anxious, Dallas thought, so he stepped forward even more eagerly than usual, and told her in hurried tones of gladness that the post had brought him good news, and that his mother was going to give him the money. \"I don\u0027t know how she has contrived to get it, Mrs. Routh,\" he said. \"Does she not tell you, then?\" asked Harriet, as she eyed with some curiosity the letter which Dallas had taken out of his pocket, and which he turned about in his hand, as he stood talking to her. As she spoke, he replaced the letter in his pocket, and sat down. \"No,\" he answered, moodily, \"she does not; but she did not get it easily, I know--not without a very painful self-sacrifice; but here\u0027s Routh.\" \"Ha! Dallas, my boy,\" said Routh, after he had directed one fleeting glance of inquiry towards his wife, and almost before he had fairly entered the room. \"You\u0027re early--any news?\" \"Very good news,\" replied Dallas; and he repeated the information he had already given Harriet. Routh received it with a somewhat feigned warmth, but Dallas was too much excited by his own feelings to perceive the impression which the news really produced on Routh. \"Is your letter from the great Mr. Carruthers himself?\" said Routh; \"from the provincial magnate who has the honour of being stepfather to you--your magnificent three-tailed bashaw?\" \"Oh dear no!\" said the young man grimly; \"not from him. My letter is from my mother.\" \"And what has she to say?\" asked Harriet quickly. \"She tells me she will very shortly be able to let me have the sum I require.\" \"The deuce she will!\" said Routh. \"Well, I congratulate you, my boy! I may say I congratulate all of us, for the matter of that; but it\u0027s rather unexpected, isn\u0027t it? I thought Mrs. Carruthers told you, when you saw her so lately, that the chances of her bleeding that charming person, her husband, were very remote.\" \"She did say so, and she was right; it\u0027s not from him she\u0027s going to get the money. Thank Heaven for that!\" \"Certainly, if you wish it, though I\u0027m not sure that we\u0027re right in being over-particular whence the money comes, so that it does come when one wants it. What is that example in the Eton Latin Grammar--\u0027I came to her in season, which is the chief thing of all?\u0027 But if not from Mr. Carruthers, where does she get the money?\" \"I--I don\u0027t know; but she does not get it without some horrible self-sacrifice; you may depend on that.\" \"My dear George, Mrs. Carruthers\u0027s case is not a singular one. We none of us get money without an extraordinary amount of self-sacrifice.\" \"Not a singular one! No, by George, you\u0027re right there, Routh,\" said the young man bitterly; \"but does that make it any lighter for her to bear, or any better for me to reflect upon? There are hundreds of vagabond sons in England at this moment, I dare say, outcasts--sources of shame and degradation to their mothers, utterly useless to any one. I swear, when I think of what my mother must have gone through to raise this money, when I think of the purpose for which it is required, I thoroughly loathe myself, and feel inclined to put a pistol to my head or a razor to my throat. However, once free, I--there--that\u0027s the old cant again!\" As the young man said these words, he rose from his chair, and fell to pacing the room with long strides. Stewart Routh looked up sternly at him from under his bent brows, and was about to speak; but Harriet held up a finger deprecatingly, and when George Dallas seated himself again, and, with his face on his hands, remained moodily gazing at the table, she stole behind him and laid her hand on his shoulder. \"I know you would not intentionally wound me, Mr. Dallas,\" she said. \"I say, you would not intentionally wound me,\" she repeated, apparently in answer to his turning sharply round and staring at her in surprise; \"but you seem to forget that it was I who counselled your recent visit to your mother, and suggested your asking her for this sum of money, which you were bound in honour to pay, and without the payment of which you--who have always represented yourself as most dear to her--would have been compromised for ever. I am sorry I did so, now that I see my intentions were misunderstood, and I say so frankly.\" \"I swear to you, Har--Mrs. Routh--I had not the slightest idea of casting the least imputation on your motives; I was only thinking--You know I\u0027m a little hot on the subject of my mother, not without reason, perhaps, for she\u0027s been a perfect angel to me, and--one can\u0027t expect other people to enter into these things, and, of course, it was very absurd. But you must forget it, please, Mrs. Routh, and you too, Stewart. If I spoke sharply or peevishly, don\u0027t mind it, old fellow!\" \"I?\" said Routh, with a crisp laugh. \"I don\u0027t mind it; and I dare say I was very provoking; but you see I never knew what it was to have a mother, and I\u0027m not much indebted to my other parent. As to the money, George--these are hard times, but if the payment of it is to drive a worthy lady to distress, or is to promote discord between you and me, why, in friendship\u0027s name, keep it, I say!\" \"You\u0027re a good fellow, Stewart,\" said Dallas, putting out his hand; \"and you, Mrs. Routh, have forgiven me?\" Though she only bowed her head slightly, she looked down into his face with a long, steady, earnest gaze. \"There\u0027s an end of it, then, I trust,\" he continued; \"we never have had words here, and I hope we\u0027re not going to begin now. As for the money, that must be paid. Whatever my mother has had to do is as good as done, and need not be whined over. Besides, I know you want the money, Stewart.\" \"That\u0027s simply to say that I am in my normal state. I always want money, my dear George.\" \"You shall have this, at all events. And now I must be off, as I have some work to do for the paper. See you very soon again. Good-bye, Stewart. The cloud has quite passed away, Mrs. Routh?\" She said \"Quite,\" as she gave him her hand, and their eyes met. There was eager inquiry in his glance; there was calm, steadfast earnestness in hers. Then he shook hands with Routh, and left the room. The moment the door closed behind him; the smile faded away from Routh\u0027s face, and the stern look which it always wore when he was preoccupied and thoughtful settled down upon it For a few minutes he was silent; then he said in a low voice: \"Harriet, for the first time in your life, I suppose, you very nearly mismanaged a bit of business I intrusted to you.\" His wife looked at him with wonder-lifted brows. \"I, Stewart? Not intentionally, I need not tell you. But how?\" \"I mean this business of George\u0027s. Did not you advise him to go down and see his mother?\" \"I did. I told him he must get the money from her.\" \"A mistake, Harry, a mistake!\" said Routh, petulantly. \"Getting the money means paying us; paying us means breaking with us?\" \"Breaking with us?\" \"Nothing less. Did you not hear him when the remorseful fit was on him just now? And don\u0027t you know that he\u0027s wonderfully young, considering all things, and has kept the bloom on his feelings in a very extraordinary manner? Did you not hear him mutter something about \u0027once free\u0027? I did not like that, Harry.\" \"Yes, I heard him say those words,\" replied Harriet. \"It was my hearing them that made me go up to him and speak as I did.\" \"That was quite right, and had its effect. One does not know what he might have done if he had turned rusty just then. And it is essential that there should not be a rupture between us now.\" \"George Dallas shall not dream of breaking with us; at least, he shall not carry out any such idea; I will take care of that,\" said Harriet, \"though I think you overrate his usefulness to us.\" \"Do I? I flatter myself there is no man in London forced to gain his bread by his wits who has a better eye for a tool than myself. And I tell you, Harry, that during all the time we have been leading this shifty life together, we have never had any one so suitable to our purposes as George Dallas.\" \"He is certainly wonderfully amenable.\" \"Amenable? He is a good deal more than that; he is devoted. You know whose doing that is, Harry, and so do I. Why, when you laid your hand on his shoulder I saw him shiver like a leaf, and the first few words from you stilled what I thought was going to be a heavy storm.\" She looked up anxiously into his face, but the smile had returned to his lips, and his brow was unclouded. Not perfectly satisfied, she suffered her eyes to drop again. \"I know perfectly well,\" pursued Routh, \"that the manner in which Dallas has stuck to us has been owing entirely to the influence you have over him, and which is natural enough. He is a bright young fellow, impressionable as we all are----\" again her eyes were raised to his face, \"--at his age; and though from the scrapes he has got into, and his own natural love of play (more developed in him than in any other man I ever met), though these things keep him down, he is innately a gentleman. You are the only woman of refinement and education to whose society he has access, and as, at the same time, you have a sweet face and an enormous power of will, it is not extraordinary that he should be completely under your influence.\" \"Don\u0027t you overrate that same influence, Stewart?\" she asked with a faint smile. \"No man knows better how to appraise the value of his own goods--and you are my goods, are you not, Harry, and out and away, the best of all my goods? Not that that\u0027s saying much. No; I understand these things, and I understand you, and having perfect confidence and trust in you, I stand by and watch the game.\" \"And you\u0027re never jealous, Stewart?\" she asked, with a half-laugh, but with the old expression of anxious interest in her eyes. \"Jealous, Harry? Not I, my love! I tell you, I have perfect trust and confidence in you, and I know your thorough devotion to our affairs. Let us get back to what we were talking about at first--what was it exactly?\" Her eyes had dropped again at the commencement of his reply, but she raised them as he finished speaking, and said, \"We were discussing the amount of George Dallas\u0027s usefulness to us.\" \"Exactly. His usefulness is greater than it seems. There is nothing so useful in a life like ours as the outward semblance of position. I don\u0027t mean the mere get up; that most fools can manage; but the certain something which proclaims to his fellows and his inferiors that a man has had education and been decently bred. There are very few among our precious acquaintances who could not win Dallas\u0027s coat off his back, at cards, or billiards, or betting, but there is not one whom I could present to any young fellow of the smallest appreciation whom I might pick up. Even if their frightful appearance were not sufficiently against them--and it is--they would say or do something in the first few minutes which would awake suspicion, whereas Dallas, even in his poverty-stricken clothes of the last few weeks, looks like a gentleman, and talks and behaves like one.\" \"Yes,\" said Harriet, reflecting, \"he certainly does; and that\u0027s a great consideration, Stewart?\" \"Incalculable! Besides, though he is a thorough gambler at heart, he has some other visible profession. His \u0027connection with the press,\u0027 as he calls it, seems really to be a fact; he could earn a decent salary if he stuck to it. From a letter he showed me, I make out that they seem to think well of him at the newspaper office; and mind you, Harriet, he might be uncommonly useful to us some day in getting things kept out of the papers, or flying a few rumours which would take effect in the money-market or at Tattersall\u0027s. Do you see all that, Harry?\" \"I see it,\" she replied; \"I suppose you\u0027re right.\" \"Eight? Of course I am! George Dallas is the best ally--and the cheapest--we have ever had, and he must be kept with us.\" \"You harp upon that \u0027kept with us.\u0027 Are you still so persuaded that he wishes to shake us off?\" \"I am. I feel convinced, from that little outburst to-night, that he is touched by this unexplained sacrifice on the part of his mother, and that in his present frame of mind he would give anything to send us adrift and get back into decent life. I feel this so strongly, Harriet,\" continued Routh, rising from his seat, crossing to the mantelshelf, and taking a cigar, \"that I think even your influence would be powerless to restrain him, unless--\" \"Unless what? Why do you pause?\" she asked, looking up at him with a clear steadfast gaze. \"Unless,\" said Routh, slowly puffing at his newly-lighted cigar, \"unless we get a fresh and a firm hold on him. He will pay that hundred and forty pounds. Once paid that hold is gone, and with it goes our ally!\" \"I see what you mean,\" said Harriet, after a pause, with a short mirthless laugh. \"He must be what they call in the East \u0027compromised.\u0027 We are plague-stricken. George Dallas must be seen to brush shoulders with us. His garments must be known to have touched ours. Then the uninfected will cast him out, and he will be reduced to herd with us.\" \"You are figurative, Harry, but forcible: you have hit my meaning exactly. But the main point still remains--how is he to be \u0027compromised\u0027?\" \"It is impossible to settle that hurriedly,\" she replied, pushing her hair back from her forehead. \"But it must be done effectually, and the step which he is led to take, and which is to bind him firmly to us, must be irrevocable. Hush! Come in!\" These last words were in reply to a knock at the room door. A dirty servant-girl put her tangled head into the room, and announced \"Mr. Deane\" as waiting down-stairs. This statement was apparently incorrect, for the girl had scarcely made it before she disappeared, as though pulled back, and a man stepped past her, and made one stride into the middle of the room, where he stood looking round him with a suspicious leer. He was a young man, apparently not more than two or three and twenty, judging by his figure and his light active movements; but cunning and deceit had stamped such wrinkles round his eyes, and graven such lines round his mouth, as are seldom to be seen in youth. His eyes, of a greenish-gray hue, were small and deeply sunk in his head; his cheek-bones were high, his cheeks fringed by a very small scrap of whisker running into a dirt-coloured tuft of hair growing underneath his chin. His figure was tall and; angular, his arms and legs long and awkward, his hands and feet large and ill-shaped. He wore a large thick overcoat with broad fur collar and cuffs, and a hood (also fur-lined) hanging back on his shoulders. With the exception of a very slight strip of ribbon, he had no cravat underneath his long limp turnover collar, but stuck into his shirt-front was a large and handsome diamond pin. \"Why, what the \u0027tarnal,\" he commenced, placing his arms a-kimbo and without removing his hat--\"what the \u0027tarnal, as they say down west, is the meaning of this little game? I come here pretty smart often, don\u0027t I? I come in gen\u0027lly right way, don\u0027t I? Why does that gal go totin\u0027 up in front of me to-day to see if you would see me, now?\" \"Some mistake, eh?\" \"Not a bit of it! Gal was all right, gal was. What I want to know is, what was up? Was you a practisin\u0027 any of your little hankey-pankeys with the pasteboards? Was you a bitin\u0027 in a double set of scrip of the new company to do your own riggin\u0027 of the market? Or was it a little bit of quiet con-nubiality with the mar-darm here in which you didn\u0027t want to be disturbed?\" Stewart Routh\u0027s face had been growing darker and darker as this speech proceeded, and at the allusion to his wife his lips began to move; but they were stopped by a warning pressure underneath the table from Harriet\u0027s foot. \"You\u0027re a queer fellow, Deane!\" he said, in a subdued voice. \"The fact is, we have a new servant here, and she did not recognize you as l\u0027ami de la maison, and so stood on the proprieties, I suppose.\" \"O, that\u0027s it, eh? I don\u0027t know about the proprieties; but when the gal knows more of me, she\u0027ll guess I\u0027m one of \u0027em. Nothing improper about me--no loafin\u0027 rowdy ways, such as some of your friends have. Pay my way as I go, ask no favours, and don\u0027t expect none.\" He gave his trousers pockets a ringing slap as he spoke, and looked round with a sneering laugh. \"There, there! It\u0027s all right; now sit down, and have a glass of wine, and tell us the news.\" \"No,\" he said, \"thank\u0027ee. I\u0027ve been liquoring up in the City, where I\u0027ve been doin\u0027 a little business--realizing some of them Lake Eries and Michigans as I told you on. Spanking investments they were, and have turned up trumps.\" \"I hope you\u0027re in the hands of an honest broker,\" said Routh. \"I could introduce you to one who--\" \"Thank\u0027ee, I have a great man to broke for me, recommended to me from t\u0027other side by his cousin who leads Wall-street, New York City. I have given him the writings, and am going to see him on Tuesday, at two, when I shall trouser the dollars to the tune of fifteen thousand and odd, if markets hold up, I reckon.\" \"And you\u0027ll bring some of that to us in Tokenhouse-yard,\" said Routh eagerly. \"You recollect what I showed you, that I--\" \"O yes!\" said Deane, again with the sinister smile. \"You could talk a \u0027coon\u0027s hind leg off, you could, Routh. But I shall just keep my dollars in my desk for a few days. Tokenhouse-yard can wait a little, can\u0027t it? just to see how things eventuate, you know.\" \"As you please,\" said Routh. \"One thing is certain, Deane; you need no Mentor in your business, whatever you may do in your pleasures.\" \"Flatter myself, need none in neither,\" said the young man, with a baleful grin. \"Eh, look here, now: talking of pleasures, come and dine with me on Tuesday at Barton\u0027s, at five. I\u0027ve asked Dallas, and we\u0027ll have a night of it. Tuesday, the 17th, mind. Sorry to take your husband away, Mrs. R., but I\u0027ll make up for it, some day. Perhaps you\u0027ll come and dine with me some day, Mis R., without R.?\" \"Not I, Mr. Deane,\" said Harriet, with a laugh. \"You\u0027re by far too dangerous a man.\" Mr. Deane was gone; and again Stewart Routh sat over the table, scribbling figures on his blotting-pad. \"What are you doing, Stewart?\" \"Five dollars to the pound--fifteen thousand,\" he said, \"three thousand pounds! When did he say he would draw it?\" \"On Tuesday, the--the day you dine with him.\" \"The day I dine with him! Keep it in his desk, he said, for a few days! He has grown very shy about Tokenhouse-yard. He hasn\u0027t been there for a week. The day I dine with him!\" He had dropped his pen, and was slowly passing his hand over his chin. \"Stewart,\" said Harriet, going behind him and putting her arm round his neck--\"Stewart, I know what thought you\u0027re busy with, but--\" \"Do you, Harry?\" said he, disengaging himself, but not unkindly--\"do you? Then keep it to yourself, my girl, and get to bed. We must have that, Harry, in one way or another; we must have it.\" She took up a candle, pressed her lips to his forehead, and went to her room without a word. But for full ten minutes she remained standing before the dressing-table buried in thought, and again she muttered to herself: \"A great risk! A great risk!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90376.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
