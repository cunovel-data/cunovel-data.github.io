{"id":39800,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X DISPOSED OF.","content":"It was very late when George Dallas arrived at Routh\u0027s lodgings in South Molton-street, so that he felt it necessary to announce his presence by a peculiar knock, known only to the initiated. He made the accustomed signal, but the door was not opened for so abnormally long an interval that he began to think he should have to go away, and defer the telling of the good news until the morning. He had knocked three times, and was about to turn away from the door when it was noiselessly opened by Harriet herself. She held a shaded candle in her hand, which gave so imperfect a light that Dallas could hardly see her distinctly enough to feel certain that his first impression, that she was looking very pale and ill, was not an imagination induced by the dim light. She asked him to come into the sitting-room, and said she had just turned the gas out, and was going to bed. \"I am sorry to have disturbed you,\" he said, when she had set down the candle on a table without re-lighting the gas, \"but I want to see Routh particularly. Is he in?\" \"No,\" said Harriet, \"he is not. Did you get his letter?\" \"What letter? I have not heard from him. I have only just come up from Amherst. But you look ill, Mrs. Routh. Does anything ail you? Is anything wrong?\" \"No,\" she said, hurriedly, \"nothing, nothing. Routh has been worried, that\u0027s all, and I am very tired.\" She pushed the candle further away as she spoke, and, placing her elbow on the table, rested her head on her hand. George looked at her with concern. He had a kind heart and great tenderness for women and children, and he could forget, or, at all events, lay aside his own anxieties in a moment at the sight of suffering in a woman\u0027s face. His look of anxious sympathy irritated Harriet; she moved uneasily and impatiently, and said almost harshly: \"Never mind my looks, Mr. Dallas; they don\u0027t matter. Tell me how you have sped on your errand at Poynings. Has your mother kept her promise? Have you got the money? I hope so, for I am sorry to say Stewart wants it badly, and has been reckoning on it eagerly. I can\u0027t imagine how it happened you did not get his letter.\" \"I have succeeded,\" said George. \"My mother has kept her word, God bless her, and I came at once to tell Routh he can have the money.\" He stopped in the full tide of his animated speech, and looked curiously at Harriet. Something in her manner struck him as being unusual. She was evidently anxious about the money, glad to see him, and yet oddly absent. She did not look at him, and while he spoke she had turned her head sharply once or twice, while her upraised eyelids and parted lips gave her face a fleeting expression of intense listening. She instantly noticed his observation of her, and said sharply: \"Well, pray go on; I am longing to hear your story.\" \"I thought you were listening to something, you looked as if you heard something,\" said George. \"So I am listening--to you,\" Harriet replied, with an attempt at a smile. \"So I do hear your adventures. There\u0027s nobody up in the house but myself. Pray go on.\" So George went on, and told her all that had befallen him at Amherst, with one important reservation; he said nothing of Clare Carruthers or his two meetings with the heiress at the Sycamores; but he told her all about his interview with his mother, and the expedient to which she had resorted to supply his wants. Harriet Routh listened to his story intently; but when she heard that he had received from Mrs. Carruthers, not money, but jewels, she was evidently disconcerted. \"Here is the bracelet,\" said George, as he took the little packet from the breast-pocket of his coat, and handed it to her. \"I don\u0027t know much about such things, Mrs. Routh, but perhaps you do. Are the diamonds very valuable?\" Harriet had opened the morocco case containing the bracelet while he was speaking, and now she lifted the beautiful ornament from its satin bed, and held it on her open palm. \"I am not a very capable judge,\" she said; \"but I think these are fine and valuable diamonds. They are extremely beautiful.\" And a gleam of colour came into her white face as she looked at the gems with a woman\u0027s irrepressible admiration of such things. \"I can\u0027t tell you how much I feel taking them from her,\" said George. \"It\u0027s like a robbery, isn\u0027t it?\" And he looked full and earnestly at Harriet. She started, let the bracelet fall, stooped to pick it up, and as she raised her face again, it was whiter than before. \"How can you talk such nonsense?\" she said, with a sudden resumption of her usual captivating manner. \"Of course it isn\u0027t. Do you suppose your mother ever had as much pleasure in these gewgaws in her life as she had in giving them to you? Besides, you know you\u0027re going to reform and be steady, and take good advice, are you not?\" She watched him very keenly, though her tone was gay and trifling. George reddened, laughed awkwardly, and replied: \"Well, I hope so; and the first step, you know, is to pay my debts. So I must get Routh to put me in the way of selling this bracelet at once. I suppose there\u0027s no difficulty about it. I\u0027m sure I have heard it said that diamonds are the same as ready money, and the sooner the tin is in Routh\u0027s pocket the better pleased I\u0027ll be. None the less obliged to him, though, Mrs. Routh; remember that, both for getting me out of the scrape, and for waiting so long and so good-humouredly for his money.\" For all the cordiality of his tone, for all the gratitude he expressed, Harriet felt in her inmost heart, and told herself she felt that he was a changed man; that he felt his freedom, rejoiced in it, and did not mean again to relinquish or endanger it. \"The thing he feared has happened,\" she thought, while her small white fingers were busy with the jewels. \"The very thing he feared. This man must be got away--how am I to do it?\" The solitary candle was burning dimly; the room was dull, cold, and gloomy. George looked round, and was apparently thinking of taking his leave, when Harriet said: \"I have not told you how opportune your getting this money--for I count it as money--is. Stay; let me light the gas. Sit down there opposite to me, and you shall hear how things have gone with us since you went away.\" She had thrown off the abstraction of her manner, and in a moment she lighted the gas, put the extinguished candle out of sight, set wine upon the table, and pulled a comfortable arm-chair forward, in which she begged George to seat himself. \"Take off your coat,\" she said; and he obeyed her, telling her, with a laugh, as he flung it upon a chair, that there was a small parcel of soiled linen in the pocket. \"I did not expect to have to stay at Amherst, so I took no clothes with me,\" he explained, \"and had to buy a shirt and a pair of stockings for Sunday, so as not to scandalize the natives. Rather an odd place to replenish one\u0027s wardrobe, by the by.\" Harriet looked sharply at the coat, and, passing the chair on which it lay on her way to her own, felt its texture with a furtive touch. Then she sat down, gave Dallas wine, and once more fell to examining the bracelet. It might have occurred to any other man in George\u0027s position that it was rather an odd proceeding on the part of Mrs. Routh to keep him there at so late an hour with no apparent purpose, and without any expressed expectation of Routh\u0027s return; but George seldom troubled himself with reflections upon anybody\u0027s conduct, and invariably followed Harriet\u0027s lead without thinking about it at all. Recent events had shaken Routh\u0027s influence, and changed the young man\u0027s views and tastes, but Harriet still occupied her former place in his regard and in his habit of life, which in such cases as his signified much. With a confidential air she now talked to him, her busy fingers twisting the bracelet as she spoke, her pale face turned to him, but her eyes somewhat averted. She told him that Routh had been surprised and annoyed at his (Dallas) being so long away from town, and had written to him, to tell him that he had been so pressed for money, so worried by duns, and so hampered by the slow proceeding of the company connected with the new speculation, that he had been obliged to go away, and must keep away, until Dallas could let him have one hundred and forty pounds. George was concerned to hear all this, and found it hard to reconcile with the good spirits in which Routh had been when he had seen him last; but he really knew so little of the man\u0027s affairs beyond having a general notion that they were hopelessly complicated, and subject to volcanic action of an utterly disconcerting nature, that he regarded his own surprise as unreasonable, and forbore to express it. \"It is of the utmost importance to Stewart to have the money at once,\" Harriet continued. \"You see that, yourself; he told you all in his letter.\" \"Very extraordinary it should have been lost! Directed to P.O., Amherst, of course? I wish I had got it, Mrs. Routh; I\u0027d have gone at once and sold the bracelet before I came to you at all, and brought the money. But I can do it early in the morning, can\u0027t I? I can take it to some good jeweller and get cash for it, and be here by twelve o\u0027clock, so as not to keep Routh a moment longer than I need in suspense. Will a hundred and forty square him for the present, Mrs. Routh? I\u0027m sure to get more for the bracelet--don\u0027t you think so?--and of course he can have it all, if he wants it.\" The young man spoke in an eager tone, and the woman listened with a swelling heart. Her full red lip trembled for a passing instant--consideration for--kindness to the only human creature she loved touched Harriet as nothing besides had power to touch her. \"I am sure the bracelet is worth more than that sum,\" she said; \"it is worth more than two hundred pounds, I dare say. But you forget, Mr. Dallas, that you must not be too precipitate in this matter. It is of immense importance to Stewart to have this money, but there are precautions to be taken.\" \"Precautions, Mrs. Routh! what precautions? The bracelet\u0027s my own, isn\u0027t it, and principally valuable because there\u0027s no bother about selling a thing of the kind?\" She looked at him keenly; she was calculating to what extent she might manage him, how far he would implicitly believe her statements, and rely upon her judgment. His countenance was eminently reassuring, so she went on: \"Certainly the bracelet is your own, and it could be easily sold, were you only to consider yourself, but you have your mother to consider.\" \"My mother! How? when she has parted with the bracelet on purpose.\" \"True,\" said Harriet; \"but perhaps you are not aware that diamonds, of anything like the value of these, are as well known, their owners, buyers, and whereabouts, as blood horses, their pedigrees, and purchasers. I think it would be unsafe for you to sell this bracelet in London; you may be sure the diamonds would be known by any jeweller on whose respectability you could sufficiently rely, to sell the jewels to him. It would be very unpleasant, and of course very dangerous to your mother, if the diamonds were known to be those purchased by Mr. Carruthers, and a cautious jeweller thought proper to ask him any questions.\" George looked grave and troubled, as Harriet put these objections to his doing as he had proposed, for the immediate relief of Routh, clearly before him. He never for a moment doubted the accuracy of her information, and the soundness of her fears. \"I understand,\" he said; \"but what can I do? I must sell the bracelet to got the money, and sooner or later will make no difference in the risk you speak of; but it may make all the difference to Routh. I can\u0027t, I won\u0027t delay in this matter; don\u0027t ask me, Mrs. Routh. It is very generous of you to think of my risk, but--\" \"It is not your risk,\" she interrupted him by saying; \"it is your mother\u0027s. If it were your own I might let you take it, for Stewart\u0027s sake,\"--an indefinable compassion was in the woman\u0027s face, an unwonted softness in her blue eyes--\"but your mother has done and suffered much for you, and she must be protected, even if Stewart has to lie hidden a day or two longer. You must not do anything rash. I think I know what would be the best thing for you to do.\" \"Tell me, Mrs. Routh,\" said George, who highly appreciated the delicate consideration for his mother which inspired Harriet\u0027s misgivings. \"Tell me, and whatever it is, I will do it.\" \"It is this,\" said Harriet; \"I know there is a large trade in diamonds at Amsterdam, and that the merchants there, chiefly Jews, deal in the loose stones, and are not, in our sense, jewellers. You could dispose of the diamonds there without suspicion or difficulty; it is the common resort of people who have diamonds to sell--London is not. If you would go there at once you might sell the diamonds, and send the money to Stewart, or rather to me, to an address we would decide upon, without more than the delay of a couple of days. Is there anything to keep you in town?\" \"No,\" said George, \"nothing. I could start this minute, as far as any business I\u0027ve got to do is concerned.\" Harriet drew a long breath, and her colour rose. \"I wish you would, Mr. Dallas,\" she said, earnestly. \"I hardly like to urge you, it seems so selfish; and Stewart, if he were here, would make so much lighter of the difficulty he is in than I can bring myself to do, but you don\u0027t know how grateful I should be to you if you would.\" The pleading earnestness of her tone, the eager entreaty in her eyes, impressed George painfully; he hastened to assure her that he would accede to any request of hers. \"I am so wretched when he is away from me, Mr. Dallas,\" said Harriet; \"I am so lonely and full of dread. Anything not involving you or your mother in risk, which would shorten the time of his absence, would be an unspeakable boon to me.\" \"Then of course I will go at once, Mrs. Routh,\" said George. \"I will go to-morrow. I am sure you are quite right, and Amsterdam\u0027s the place to do the trick at. I wish I could have seen Routh first, for a moment, but as I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t. Let me see. Amsterdam. There\u0027s a boat to Rotterdam by the river, and--Oh, by Jove! here\u0027s a Bradshaw; let\u0027s see when the next goes.\" He walked to the little sideboard, and selected the above-named compendium of useful knowledge from a mass of periodicals, circulars, bills, and prospectuses of companies immediately to be brought out, and offering unheard-of advantages to the investors. The moment his eyes were turned away from her, a fierce impatience betrayed itself in Harriet\u0027s face, and as he sat slowly turning over the sibylline leaves, and consulting the incomprehensible and maddening index, she pressed her clasped hands against her knees, as though it were almost impossible to resist the impulse which prompted her to tear the book from his dilatory fingers. \"Here it is,\" said George, at length, \"and uncommonly cheap, too. The Argus for Rotterdam, seven A.M. That\u0027s rather early, though, isn\u0027t it? To-morrow morning, too, or rather this morning, for it\u0027s close upon one now. Let\u0027s see when the Argus, or some other boat, goes next. H\u0027m; not till Thursday at the same hour. That\u0027s rather far off.\" Harriet was breathing quickly, and her face was quite white, but she sat still and controlled her agony of anxiety. \"I have urged him as strongly as I dare,\" she thought; \"fate must do the rest.\" Fate did the rest. \"After all, I may as well go at seven in the morning, Mrs. Routh. All my things are packed up already, and it will give me a good start. I might get my business done before Wednesday night, almost, if I\u0027m quick about it; at all events early the following day.\" \"You might, indeed,\" said Harriet, in a faint voice. \"There\u0027s one little drawback, though, to that scheme,\" said Dallas. \"I haven\u0027t the money. They owe me a trifle at the Mercury, and I shall have to wait till to-morrow and get it, and go by Ostend, the swell route. I can\u0027t go without it, that\u0027s clear.\" Harriet looked at him with a wan blank face, in which there was something of weariness, and under it something of menace, but her tone was quite amiable and obliging as she said: \"I think it is a pity to incur both delay and expense by waiting. I have always a little ready money by me, in case of our having to make a move suddenly, or of an illness, or one of the many contingencies which men never think of, and women never forget. You can have it with pleasure. You can return it to me,\" she said, with a forced smile, \"when you send Routh the hundred and forty.\" \"Thank you,\" said Dallas. \"I shan\u0027t mind taking it from you for a day or two, as it is to send help to Routh the sooner. Then I\u0027ll go, that\u0027s settled, and I had better leave you, for you were tired when I came in, and you must be still more tired now. I shall get back from Amsterdam as quickly as I can, tell Routh, but I see my way to making a few pounds out of the place. They want padding at the Mercury, and I shan\u0027t come back by return of post.\" He had risen now, and had extended his hand towards the bracelet, which lay in its open case on the table. A sudden thought struck Harriet. \"Stop,\" she said; \"I don\u0027t think it would do to offer this bracelet in its present shape, anywhere. The form and the setting are too remarkable. It would probably be re-sold entire, and it is impossible to say what harm might come of its being recognized. It must be taken to pieces, and you must offer the diamonds separately for sale. It will make no appreciable difference in the money you will receive, for such work as this is like bookbinding--dear to buy, but never counted in the price when you want to sell.\" \"What am I to do, then?\" asked George, in a dismayed tone. \"I could not to take out the diamonds, you know; they are firmly set--see here.\" He turned the gold band inside out, and showed her the plain flat surface at the back of the diamonds and turquoises. \"Wait a moment,\" said Harriet. \"I think I can assist you in this respect. Do you study the bracelet a bit until I come to you.\" She left the room, and remained away for a little time. Dallas stood close by the table, having lowered the gas-burners, and by their light he closely inspected the rivets, the fastenings, and the general form of the splendid ornament he was so anxious to get rid of, idly thinking how well it must have looked on his mother\u0027s still beautiful arm, and wondering whether she was likely soon to \"be obliged to wear the counterfeit. His back was turned to the door by which Harriet had left the room, so that, when she came softly to the aperture again, he did not perceive her. She carefully noted his attitude, and glided softly in, carrying several small implements in her right hand, and in her left held cautiously behind her back a coat, which she dexterously dropped upon the floor quite unperceived by Dallas, behind the chair on which he had thrown his. She then went up to the table, and showed him a small pair of nippers, a pair of scissors of peculiar form, and a little implement, with which she told him workers in jewelry loosened stones in their setting, and punched them out. Dallas looked with some surprise at the collection, regarding them as unusual items of a lady\u0027s paraphernalia, and said, gaily: \"You are truly a woman of resources, Mrs. Routh. Who would ever have thought of your having all those things ready at a moment\u0027s notice?\" Harriet made no reply, but she could not quite conceal the disconcerting effect of his words. \"If I have made a blunder in this,\" she thought, \"it is a serious one, but I have more to do, and must not think yet.\" She sat down, cleared a space on the table, placed the bracelet and the little tools before her, and set to work at once at her task of demolition. It was a long one, and the sight was pitiful as she placed jewel after jewel carefully in a small box before her, and proceeded to loosen one after another. Sometimes George took the bracelet from her and aided her, but the greater part of the work was done by her. The face bent over the disfigured gold and maltreated gems was a remarkable one in its mingled expression of intentness and absence; her will was animating her fingers in their task, but her mind, her fancy, her memory, were away, and, to judge by the rigidity of the cheeks and lips, the unrelaxed tension of the low white brow, on no pleasing excursion. The pair worked on in silence, only broken occasionally by a word from George, expressive of admiration for her dexterity and the celerity with which she detached the jewels from the gold setting. At length all was done--the golden band, limp and scratched, was a mere commonplace piece of goldsmith\u0027s work--the diamonds lay in their box in a shining heap, the discarded turquoises on the table; and all was done. \"What shall we do with these things?\" asked George. \"They are not worth selling--at least, not now--but I think the blue things might make up prettily with the gold again. Will you keep them, Mrs. Routh? and some day, when I am better off, I\u0027ll have them set for you, in remembrance of this night in particular, and of all your goodness to me in general.\" He was looking at the broken gold and the turquoises, thinking how trumpery they looked now--not at her. Fortunately not at her, for if he had seen her face he must have known--even he, unsuspicious as he was--that she was shaken by some inexplicably powerful feeling. The dark blood rushed into her face, dispersed itself over her fair throat in blotches, and made a sudden dreadful tingling in her ears. For a minute she did not reply, and then Dallas did look at her, but the agony had passed over her. \"No--no,\" she said; \"the gold is valuable, and the turquoises as much so as they can be for their size. You must keep them for a rainy day.\" \"I\u0027m likely to see many,\" said George, with half a smile and half a sigh, \"but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever use these things to keep me from the pelting of the pitiless shower. If you won\u0027t keep them for yourself, Mrs. Routh, perhaps you\u0027ll keep them for me until I return.\" \"O yes,\" said Harriet, \"I will keep them. I will lock them up in my desk; you will know where to find them.\" She drew the desk towards her as she spoke, took out of it a piece of paper, without seeing that one side had some writing upon it, swept the scattered turquoises into the sheet, then folded the gold band in a second, placed both in a large blue envelope, with the device of Routh\u0027s last new company scheme upon it, and sealed the parcel over the wafer. \"Write your name on it,\" she said to George, who took up a pen and obeyed her. She opened a drawer at the side of the desk, and put away the little parcel quite at the back. Then she took from the same drawer seven sovereigns, which George said would be as much as he would require for the present, and which he carefully stowed away in his pocket-book. Then he sat down at the desk, and playfully wrote an IOU for the amount. \"That\u0027s business-like,\" said George, smiling, but the smile by which she replied was so wan and weary, that George again commented on her fatigue, and began to take leave of her. \"I\u0027m off, then,\" he said, \"and you won\u0027t forget to tell Routh how much I wanted to see him. Among other things to tell him--However, I suppose he has seen Deane since I have been away?\" Harriet was occupied in turning down the gas-burner by which she had just lighted the candle again. She now said: \"How stupid I am! as if I couldn\u0027t have lighted you to the door first, and put the gas out afterwards! The truth is, I am so tired; I\u0027m quite stupified. What did you say, Mr. Dallas? There, I\u0027ve knocked your coat off the chair; here it is, however. You asked me something, I think?\" George took the coat she held from her, hung it over his arm, felt for his hat (the room being lighted only by the feeble candle), and repeated his words: \"Routh has seen Deane, of course, since I\u0027ve been away?\" \"No,\" Harriet replied with distinctness, \"he has not--he has not.\" \"Indeed!\" said George. \"I am surprised at that. But Deane was huffed, I remember, on Tuesday, when Routh broke his engagement to dine with him, and said it must depend on whether he was in the humour to meet him the next day, as Routh asked him to do. So I suppose he wasn\u0027t in the humour, eh? And now he\u0027ll be huffed with me, but I can\u0027t help it.\" \"Why?\" asked Harriet; and she spoke the single word with a strange effort, and a painful dryness of the throat. \"Because I promised to give him his revenge at billiards. I won ten pounds from him that night, and uncommonly lucky it was for me; it enabled me to get away from my horrible old shrew of a landlady, and, indeed, indirectly it enables me to start on this business to-morrow.\" \"How?\" said Harriet. Again she spoke but one word, and again with difficulty and a dryness in the throat. She set down the candle, and leaned against the table, while George stood between her and the door, his coat over his arm. \"You didn\u0027t notice that I told you I was all packed up and ready to go. It happened luckily, didn\u0027t it?\" And then George told his listener how he had paid his landlady, and removed his modest belongings on the previous Wednesday morning to a coffee-house, close to the river too. \"By Jove! I\u0027m in luck\u0027s way, it seems,\" he said; \"so I shall merely go and sleep there, and take my traps on board the Argus. I have only such clothes as I shall want, no matter where I am,\" he said. \"They\u0027ll keep the trunk with my books until I come back, and Deane must wait for his revenge with the balls and cues for the same auspicious occasion. Let\u0027s hope he\u0027ll be in a better temper, and have forgiven Routh. He was awfully riled at his note on Tuesday evening.\" \"Did--did you see it!\" asked Harriet; and, as she spoke, she leaned still more heavily against the table. \"No,\" replied Dallas, \"I did not; but Deane told me Routh asked him to meet him the next day. He didn\u0027t, it seems.\" \"No,\" said Harriet; \"and Stewart is very much annoyed about it. Mr. Deane owed him money, and he asked him for some in that note.\" \"Indeed,\" said George; \"he could have paid him then, I happen to know. He had a lot of gold and notes with him. The tenner he lost to me he paid in a note, and he changed a fiver to pay for our dinner, and he was bragging and bouncing the whole time about the money he had about him, and what he would, and would not, do with it. So it was sheer spite made him neglect to pay Routh, and I hope he\u0027ll dun him again. The idea of Routh being in the hole he\u0027s in, and a fellow like that owing him money. How much is it, Mrs. Routh?\" \"I--I don\u0027t know,\" said Harriet. \"There, I\u0027m keeping you talking still. I am the most thoughtless fellow.\" It never occurred to George that she had kept him until she had learned what she wanted to know. \"Good-bye, Mrs. Routh, good-bye.\" She had passed him, the candle in her hand, and this farewell was uttered in the hall. He held out his hand; she hesitated for a moment, and then gave him hers. He pressed it fervently; it was deadly cold. \"Don\u0027t stay in the chill air,\" he said; \"you are shivering now.\" Then he went away with a light cheerful step. Harriet Routh stood quite still, as he had left her, for one full minute; then she hurried into the sitting-room, shut the door, dropped on her knees before a chair, and ground her face fiercely against her arms. There she knelt, not sobbing, not weeping, but shuddering--shuddering with the quick terrible iteration of mortal agony of spirit, acting on an exhausted frame. After a while she rose, and then her face was dreadful to look upon, in its white fixed despair. \"If I have saved him,\" she said, as she sat wearily down by the table again, and once more leaned her face upon her hands--\"if I have saved him! It may be there is a chance; at all events, there is a chance. How wonderful, how inconceivably wonderful that he should not have heard of it! The very stones of the street seem to cry it out, and he has not heard of it; the very air is full of it, and he knows nothing. If anything should prevent his going? But no; nothing will, nothing can. This was the awful danger--this was the certain, the inevitable risk; if I have averted it; if I have saved him, for the time!\" The chill of coming dawn struck cold to her limbs, the sickness of long watching, of fear, and of sleeplessness was at her heart, but Harriet Routh did not lie down on her bed all that dreadful night. Terrible fatigue weighed down her eyelids, and made her flesh tremble and quiver over the aching bones. \"I must not sleep--I should not wake in time,\" she said, as she forced herself to rise from her chair, and paced the narrow room, when the sudden dumbness of sleep threatened to fall upon her. \"I have something to do.\" Dawn came, then sunrise, then the sounds, the stir of morning. Then Harriet bathed her face in cold water, and looked in her toilet-glass at her haggard features. The image was not reassuring; but she only smiled a bitter smile, and made a mocking gesture with her hand. \"Never any more,\" she murmured--\"never any more.\" The morning was cold and raw, but Harriet heeded it not. She glanced out of the window of her bed-room before she left it, wearing her bonnet and shawl, and closely veiled. Then she closed the shutters, locked the door, withdrew the key, and came into the sitting-room. She went to a chair and took up a coat which lay at the back of it; then she looked round for a moment as if in search of something. Her eye lighted on a small but heavy square of black marble which lay on the writing-table, and served as a paper-press. She then spread the coat on the table, placed the square of marble on it, and rolled it tightly round the heavy centre, folding and pressing the parcel into the smallest possible dimensions. This done, she tied it tightly with a strong cord, and, concealing it under her shawl, went swiftly out of the house. No one saw her issue from the grim, gloomy door--the neighbouring housemaids had not commenced their matutinal task of door-step cleaning, alleviated by gossip--and she went away down the street, completely unobserved. Went away, with her head down, her face hidden, with a quick, steady step and an unfaltering purpose. There were not many wayfarers abroad in the street, and of those she saw none, and was remarked by only one. Harriet Routh took her way towards the river, and reached Westminster-bridge as the clock in the great tower of the new palace marked half-past six. All was quiet. A few of the laggards of the working classes were straggling across the bridge to their daily toil, a few barges were moving sluggishly upon the muddy water; but there was no stir, no business yet. Harriet lingered when she reached the centre of the bridge; a figure was just vanishing at the southern end, the northern was clear of people. She leaned over the parapet, and looked down--no boat, no barge was near. Then she dropped the parcel she had carried into the river, and the water closed over it. Without the delay of an instant, she turned and retraced her steps toward home. As she neared South Morton-street, she found several of the shops open, and entering one, she purchased a black marble letter-press. It was not precisely similar to that with which she had weighted the parcel, which now lay in the bed of the river; but the difference was trifling, and not to be perceived by the eye of a stranger. Near the house in which the Rouths occupied apartments there was an archway which formed the entrance to some mews. As she passed this open space, Harriet\u0027s glance fell upon the inquisitive countenance of a keen-looking, ragged street-boy, who was lying contentedly on his back under the archway, with his arms under his head, and propped upon the kerbstone. A sudden impulse arrested her steps. \"Have you no other place to lie than here?\" she asked the boy, who jumped up with great alacrity, and stood before her in an attitude almost respectful. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he said, \"I have, but I\u0027m here, waiting for an early job.\" She gave him a shilling and a smile--not such a smile as she once had to give, but the best that was left her--and went on to the door of the house she lived in. She opened it with a key, and went in. The boy remained where she had left him, apparently ruminating, and wagging his tousled head sagely. \"Whatever is she up to?\" he asked of himself, in perplexity, \"It\u0027s a rum start, as far as I knows on it, and I means to know more. But how is she in it? I shan\u0027t say nothing till I knows more about it.\" And then Mr. Jim Swain went his way to a more likely quarter for early jobs. Fortune favoured Mrs. Routh on that morning. She gained her bed-room unseen and unheard, and having hastily undressed, lay down to rest, if rest would come to her--at least to await in quiet the ordinary hour at which the servant was accustomed to call her. It came, and passed; but Harriet did not rise. She slept a little when all the world was up and busy--slept until the second delivery of letters brought one for her, which the servant took at once to her room. The letter was from George Dallas, and contained merely a few lines, written when he was on the point of starting, and posted at the river-side. He apologized to Harriet for a mistake which he had made on the previous night. He had taken up Routh\u0027s coat instead of his own, and had not discovered the error until he was on his way to the steamer, and it was too late to repair it. He hoped it would not matter, as he had left his own coat at South Molton-street, and no doubt Routh could wear it, on an occasion. When Harriet had read this note, she lay back upon her pillow, and fell into a deep sleep, which was broken by Routh\u0027s coming into her room early in the afternoon. He looked pale and haggard, and he stood by the bedside in silence. But she--she sat up, and flung her arms round him with a wonderfully good imitation of her former manner; and when she told him all that had passed, her husband caught her to his breast with passionate fondness and gratitude, and declared over and over again that her ready wit and wonderful fortitude had saved him. Saved him? How, and from what?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90382.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
