{"id":39793,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE PHILISTINES.","content":"The cold weather, which in the country produced rugged roads and ice-bound ponds; which frosted the leafless branches of the trees with a silver tint, and gave a thousand different fantastic but ever lovely hues and shapes to nature; had no such pleasant refreshing effect in London, where the frost, ere three hours old, was beaten into mud under foot, ran drizzling in dirty streams from house-tops, and subsided into rain and fog before the daylight had disappeared. The day succeeding that on which George Dallas had entered the town of Amherst was a thorough specimen of what London can do when put to its worst. It was bad in the large thoroughfares where the passing crowds jostled each other ill-temperedly, digging at each other\u0027s umbrellas, and viciously contesting every inch of foot pavement, where the omnibus-wheels revolved amid mud-ruts, and every passing cab-horse produced a fountain of slush and spray. But it was even worse in the bystreets, where an attempt at sweeping had been made, where the mud lay in a thick slimy, shiny tide between the narrow ridges of footpath, where the tall houses, so close together that they completely filtered the air and light and retained nothing but the darkness and the dirt, were splashed with mud to their first-floor windows, and whose inhabitants or visitors desirous of crossing the road had to proceed to the junction with the main street, and, after tacking across in comparative cleanliness, commence their descent on the opposite side. In the front room of the first floor of a house in such a street, South Molton-street, connecting Oxford-street the plebeian with Brook-street the superb, just as the feeble glimmer of daylight which had vouchsafed itself during the day was beginning to wax even feebler, previous to its sudden departure, a man sat astride a chair, sunk in thought. He had apparently just entered, for he still wore his hat and overcoat, though the former was pushed to the back of his head, and the latter thrown negligently open. He was a tall handsome man, with keen black eyes glancing sharply, with thick black brows, a long straight nose, thin tight lips unshrouded by moustache or beard, and a small round chin. He had full flowing black whiskers, and the blue line round his mouth showed that the beard was naturally strong; had he suffered it to grow he might have passed for an Italian. As it was, there was no mistaking him for anything but an Englishman--darker, harder-looking than most of his race, but an Englishman. His face, especially round the eyes, was flushed and marked and lined, telling of reckless dissipation. There was a something not exactly fast, but yet slangy, in the cut of his clothes and in the manner in which he wore them; his attitude as he sat at the window with his hands clasped in front of him over the back rail of his chair, his knees straight out and his feet drawn back, as a man sits a horse at a hunt, was in its best aspect suggestive of the mess-room: in its worst, of the billiard-room. And yet there was an indescribable something in the general aspect of the man, in the very ease of his position, in the shape of the hands clasped in front of him, in the manner, slight as it was, in which now and again he would turn on his chair and peer back into the darkness behind him, by which you would have known that he had had a refined education, and had been conversant with the manners of society. Nor would you have been wrong. In Burke\u0027s Landed Gentry, the Rouths of Carr Abbey take up their full quota of pages, and when the county election for Herefordshire comes off, the liberal agent is forced to bring to bear all the science he can boast of, to counteract the influence which the never-failing adhesion of the old family throws into the Tory scale. Never having risen, never for an instant having dreamed of demeaning themselves by rising, above the squirearchy, owners of the largest and best herds in all that splendid cattle-breeding county, high-sheriffs and chairmen of quarter-sessions as though by prescriptive right, perpetual presidents of agricultural societies, and in reality taking precedence immediately after the lord-lieutenant, the Rouths of Carr Abbey, from time immemorial, have sent their sons to Oxford and their daughters to court, and have never, save in one instance, had to blush for their children. Save in one instance. The last entry in the old family Bible of Carr Abbey is erased by a thick black line. The old squire speaks habitually of \"My only son, William;\" and should a stranger, dining at the Abbey, casually refer to the picture, by Lawrence, of two little boys, one riding a pony, the younger decking a dog\u0027s neck with ribbon, he is, if the squire had not heard his question, motioned in dumb show to silence, or is replied to by the squire himself that \"that boy is--lost, sir.\" That boy, Stewart Routh, the man looking out of the window in South Molton-street, was captain of the boat at Eton, and first favourite, for a time, both with the dons and undergraduates at Oxford. Rumours of high play at cards developing into fact of perpetually sported \"oak,\" non-attendance at chapel, and frequent shirking of classes, lessened the esteem in which Mr. Routh was held by the authorities; and a written confession handed to the dean, after being obtained by parental pressure, from Mr. Albert Grüntz, of Christ Church, son of and heir to Mr. Jacob Grüntz, sugar-baker, of St Mary Axe, in the city of London, and Balmoral-gardens, Hyde-park, a confession to the effect that he, Mr. A. Grüntz, had lost the sum of two thousand pounds to Mr. S. Routh, at a game played with dice, and known as French hazard, procured the dismissal of Mr. S. Routh from the seat of learning. At Carr Abbey, whither he retired, his stay was shortened by the arrival of another document from Oxford, this time signed by Lord Hawkhurst, gentleman commoner of Christ Church, and Arthur Wardroper, of Balliol, setting forth that Mr. S. Routh, while playing hazard in Mr. Grüntz\u0027s rooms, had been caught there in flagrante delicto in the act of cheating by \"securing,\" i.e. retaining in his fingers, one of the dice which he should have shaken from the box. It was the receipt of this letter that caused the squire to make the erasure in the family Bible, and to look upon his youngest son as dead. Driven from the paternal roof, Mr. Stewart Routh descended upon the pleasant town of Boulogne, whence, after a short stay not unmarked by many victories over the old and young gentlemen who frequent the card-tables at the Etablissement des Bains, from whom he carried off desirable trophies, he proceeded to the baths and gambling-houses of Ems, Homburg, and Baden-Baden. It was at the last-mentioned place, and when in the very noon and full tide of success, that he was struck down by a fever, so virulent that the affrighted servants of the hotel refused to wait upon him. No nurse could be prevailed upon to undertake to attend him; and he would have been left to die for want of proper care, had not a young Englishwoman, named Harriet Creswick, travelling in the capacity of nursery-governess to Lord de Mauleverer\u0027s family (then passing through Baden on their way to winter in Rome), come to the rescue. Declaring that her countryman should not perish like a dog, she there and then devoted herself to attendance on the sick man. It need scarcely be told that Lady de Mauleverer, protesting against \"such extraordinary conduct,\" intimated to Miss Creswick that her connection with her noble charges must cease at once and for ever. But it is noteworthy that in such a man as Stewart Routh had hitherto proved himself, a spirit of gratitude should have been so strongly aroused, that when his sense and speech returned to him, in weak and faltering accents he implored the woman who had so tenderly nursed him through his illness, to become his wife. It is quite needless to say that his friends, on hearing of it, averred, some that he thought he was going to die, and that it did not matter to him what he did, while it might have pleased the young lady; others, that he was a particularly knowing card, whose brains had never deserted him, even when he was at his worst, and that he had discovered in Harriet Creswick a woman exactly fitted, by physical and mental qualification, efficiently to help him as his partner in playing the great game of life. Be it as it may--and people will talk, especially in such circles--the fact remains that on his sick couch at the Hollandischer Hof, Baden-Baden, Stewart Routh proposed to Harriet Creswick and was accepted; that so soon as he could safely be left she departed for England; and that within a month they were married in London. Of that one event at least in all his eventful life, Stewart Routh had never repented. Through all his vicissitudes of fortune his wife had been by his side, and as, in the long run, chance had been against him, taking the heaviest portion of his burden on herself. Harriet Routh\u0027s was an untiring, undying, unquestioning love or worship of her husband. The revelation of his--to say the least of it--loose mode of life, the shifts and expedients to which he resorted for getting money, the questionable company in which he habitually lived, would have told with fatal effect on a devotion less thorough, a passion more transient. Harriet herself, who had been brought up staidly at an Institution, which she had only quitted to join the family with whom she was travelling when she arrived at Baden--Harriet herself at first shrunk back stunned and stupefied by the revelation of an unknown life which burst upon her a few days after her marriage. But her love bore her through it. As the dyer\u0027s hand assimilates to that it works in, so gradually did Harriet Routh endue herself with her husband\u0027s tone, temper, and train of thought, until, having become almost his second self, she was his most trusted ally, his safest counsellor in all the strange schemes by which he made out life. In the early days after their marriage she had talked to him once, only once, and then but for a few minutes, of reformation, of something better and more reputable, of doing with less money, to be obtained by the exercise of his talents in some legitimate manner. And her husband, with the nearest approach to harshness that before or since he had ever assumed, told her that his time for that kind of thing was passed and gone for ever, that she must forget all the childish romance that they had taught her at the Institution, that she must sink or swim with him, and be prepared to cast in her lot with that kind of existence which had become his second nature, and out of which he could never hope to move. Even if he could move from it, he added, he did not think that he would wish to do so, and there must be an end to the matter. There was an end to the matter. From that time forth, Harriet Routh buried her past, buried her former self, and devoted herself, soul and body, to her husband. Her influence over him strengthened with each year that they lived together, and was traceable in many ways. The fact once faced, that their precarious livelihood was to be earned by the exercise of sharpness superior to that enjoyed by those with whom they were brought into contact, Harriet laid herself out at once for the fulfilment of her new duties, and in a very short time compelled her husband\u0027s surprised laudation of the ease and coolness with which she discharged them. There were no other women in that strange society; but if there had been, Harriet would have queened it over them, not merely by her beauty, but by her bright spirit, her quick appreciation, her thorough readiness to enter exactly into the fancy of the moment. The men who lost their money to Routh and his companion treated her not merely with a punctilio which forbade the smallest verbal excess, but bore their losses with comparative good humour so long as Mrs. Routh was present. The men who looked up to Routh as the arch-concocter of and prime mover in all their dark deeds, had a blind faith in her, and their first question, on the suggestion of any scheme, would be \"what Mrs. Routh thought of it.\" Ah, the change, the change! The favourite pupil of the Institution, who used to take such close notes of the sermon on Sunday mornings, and illustrate the chaplain\u0027s meaning with such apposite texts from other portions of Scripture, as quite to astonish the chaplain himself, which perhaps was not to be wondered at, as the chaplain (a bibulous old gentleman, who had been appointed on the strength of his social qualities by the committee, who valued him as \"a parson, you know, without any nonsense about him\") was in the habit of purchasing his discourses ready made, and only just ran them through, on Saturday nights. The show pupil of the Institution, who did all kinds of arithmetical problems \"in her head,\" by which the worthy instructors meant without the aid of paper and pencil--the staid and decorous pupil of the Institution, who, when after her last examination she was quitting the table loaded with prizes--books--was called back by the bishop of the diocese, who with feeble hands pinned a silver medal on to her dress, and said, in a trembling voice, \"I had nearly forgotten the best of all. This is in testimony of your excellent conduct, my dear.\" What was become of this model miss? She was utilizing her talents in a different way. That was all. The memory which had enabled her to summarize and annotate the chaplain\u0027s sermons now served as her husband\u0027s note-book, and was stored with all kinds of odd information, \"good things\" to \"come off,\" trials of horses, names and fortunes of heirs who had just succeeded to their estates, lists of their most pressing debts, names of the men who were supposed to be doubtful in money matters, and with whom it was thought inexpedient to bet or play--all these matters dwelt in Harriet Routh\u0027s brain, and her husband had only to turn his head and ask, \"What is it, Harry?\" to have the information at once. The arithmetical quickness stood her in good stead, in the calculation of odds on all kinds of sporting events, on the clear knowledge of which the success of most of Routh\u0027s business depended; and as for the good conduct--well, the worthy bishop would have held up his hands in pious horror at the life led by the favourite pupil of the Institution, and at her surroundings; but against Mrs. Routh, as Mrs. Routh, as the devoted, affectionate, self-denying, spotless wife, the veriest ribald in all that loose crew had never ventured to breathe a doubt. Devoted and affectionate! See her now as she comes quietly into the room--a small compact partridge of a woman with deep blue eyes in a very pale face, with smooth shining light brown hair falling on either side in two long curls, and gathered into a clump at the back of her head, with an impertinent nose only just redeemed from being a snub, with a small mouth, and a very provoking pattable chin. See how she steals behind her husband, her dark linsey dress draping her closely and easily, and not making the slightest rustle; her round arm showing its symmetry in her tight sleeve twining round his neck; her plump shapely hand resting on his head; her pale cheek laid against his face. Devoted and affectionate! No simulation here. \"Anything gone wrong, Stewart?\" she asked, in a very sweet voice. \"No, dear. Why?\" said Routh, who was now sitting at a table strewn with papers, a pen in his right hand, and his left supporting his handsome worn face. \"You looked gloomy, I thought; but, if you say so, it\u0027s all right,\" returned his wife, cheerfully, leaving his side as she spoke, and proceeding to sweep up the hearth, put on fresh coals, and make the whole room look comfortable, with a few rapid indefinable touches. Then she sat down in a low chair by the fire, perfectly still, and turned her calm pale face to her husband with a business-like air. He made some idle scratches with his pen in silence, then threw it down, and, suddenly pushing away his chair, began to walk up and down the room with long light strides. \"What do you make of Deane, Harriet?\" he said, at length, stopping for a moment opposite his wife, and looking closely at her. \"How do you mean? In character or in probabilities? As regards himself, or as regards us?\" \"Well, both. I cannot make him out; he is so confoundedly cool, and so infernally sharp. He might be a shrewd man of business, bent on making a fortune, and a good way on the road to his object; and yet he\u0027s nothing but a man of pleasure, of what your good people would call a wretched low kind of pleasure too, and is spending the fortune instead.\" \"I don\u0027t think so, Stewart,\" his wife said, quietly and impressively. \"I don\u0027t think Mr. Deane is spending any very considerable portion of his fortune, whatever it may be.\" Stewart had resumed his walking up and down, but listened to her attentively. \"I regard him as a curious combination of the man of business with the man of pleasure. I don\u0027t know that we have ever met exactly the kind of person before. He is as calculating in his pleasures as other men are in their business.\" \"I hate the man,\" said Routh, with an angry frown and a sullen gesture. \"That\u0027s dangerous, Stewart,\" said Harriet. \"You should not allow yourself either to hate or to like any one in whom you are speculating. If you do the one, it will make you incautious; if you do the other, scrupulous. Both are unwise. I do not hate Mr. Deane.\" \"Fortunately for him, Harry. I think a man would be a great deal safer with my hatred than with yours.\" \"Possibly,\" she said, simply, and the slightest smile just parted her crimson lips, and showed a momentary gleam of her white, small, even teeth. \"But I do not hate him. I think about him, though; because it is necessary that I should, and I fancy I have found out what he really is.\" \"Have you, by Jove?\" interrupted Routh. \"Then you\u0027ve done a clever thing, Harriet--clever even for you; for of all the close and impenetrable men I ever met, Deane\u0027s the closest and the hardest. When I\u0027m with him, I always feel as if he were trying to do me somehow, and as if he would succeed too, though that\u0027s not easy. He\u0027s as mean as a Scotch shopkeeper, as covetous as a Jew, as wide awake as a Yankee. There\u0027s a coolness and a constant air of avowed suspicion about him that drives me mad.\" \"And yet you ought to have been done with temper and with squeamishness long ago,\" said Harriet, in a tone of quiet conviction. \"How often have you told me, Stewart, that to us, in our way of life, every man must be a puppet, prized in proportion to the readiness with which he dances to our pulling? What should we care? I am rendered anxious and uneasy by what you say.\" She kept silence for a few moments, and then asked him, in a changed tone, \"How does your account with him stand?\" \"My account!---ah, there\u0027s the rub! He\u0027s so uncommonly sharp, that there\u0027s little to be done with him. The fellow\u0027s a blackguard--more of a blackguard than I am, I\u0027ll swear, and as much of a swindler, at least, in his capacity for swindling. Only I dare say he has never had occasion to reduce it to practice. And yet there\u0027s a hardly veiled insolence in his manner to me, at times, for which I\u0027d like to blow his brains out. He tells me, as plainly as if he said it in words, that he pays me a commission on his pleasures, such as are of my procuring, but that he knows to a penny what he intends to pay, and is not to be drawn into paying a penny more.\" Harriet sat thoughtful, and the faintest flush just flickered on her cheek. \"Who are his associates, when he is not with you?\" \"He keeps that as close as he keeps everything else,\" replied Routh; \"but I have no doubt he makes them come cheap, if indeed he does not get a profit out of them.\" \"You are taking my view of him, Stewart,\" said Harriet; then she added, \"He has some motive for acting with such caution, no doubt; but a flaw may be found in his armour, when we think fit to look for it. In the mean time, tell me what has set you thinking of him?\" \"Dallas\u0027s affair, Harriet. I am sorry the poor fellow lost his money to him. Hang it, I\u0027m such a bad fellow myself, so utterly gone a\u0027coon\" (his wife winced, and her pale face turned paler), \"that it comes ill from me to say so, and I wouldn\u0027t, except to you. But I am devilish sorry Deane got the chance of cleaning Dallas out. I like the boy; he\u0027s a stupid fool, but not half bad, and he didn\u0027t deserve such an ill turn of fortune.\" \"Well,\" said Harriet, \"take comfort in remembering that you helped him.\" She spoke very coldly, and evidently was a stranger to the feelings which actuated Routh. \"You don\u0027t care about it, that\u0027s clear,\" he remarked. He was standing still now, leaning against the mantelpiece. She rose and approached him. \"No, Stewart,\" she said, in her calm sweet voice, which rose a little as she went on, \"I do not. I care for nothing on earth (and I never look beyond this earth) but you. I have no interest, no solicitude, for any other creature. I cannot feel any, and it is well. Nothing but this would do in my case.\" She stood and looked at him with her deep blue eyes, with her hands folded before her, and with a sober seriousness in her face confirmatory of the words she had spoken. He looked at her until she turned away, and a keen observer might have seen in his face the very slightest expression of impatience. \"Shall we go into those accounts now?\" said Harriet; \"we shall just have time for it, before you go to Flinders\u0027.\" She sat down, as she spoke, before a well-appointed writing table, and, drawing a japan box towards her, opened it, and took out a number of papers. Routh took a seat beside her, and they were soon deep in calculations which would have had little interest or meaning for a third person, had there been one present. By degrees, Routh\u0027s face darkened, and many times he uttered angry oaths; but though Harriet watched him narrowly, and felt in every nerve the annoyance under which he was labouring, she preserved her calm manner, and went steadily on with her task; condensing the contents of several papers into brief memoranda, carefully tearing up the originals, and placing the little heaps methodically beside her for consignment to the fire. At length Routh again stood up, and lounged against the mantelpiece. \"All these must be paid, then, Harry?\" he asked, as he lighted a cigar, and began to smoke sullenly. \"Yes,\" she answered, cheerfully. \"You know, dear, it has always been our rule, as it has hitherto constituted our safety, to stand well with our tradespeople, and pay them, at least, punctually. We have never been so much behindhand; and as you are about to take a bolder flight than usual, it is doubly necessary that we should be untrammelled. Fancy Flinders getting snubbed by the landlady, or your being arrested for your tailor\u0027s bills, at the time when the new Company is coming out!\" \"Hang it! the bills all seem to be mine,\" growled Routh, \"Where are yours? Haven\u0027t you got any?\" It would have been difficult to induce an unseen witness to believe how utterly unscrupulous, remorseless, conscienceless a woman Harriet Routh had become, if he had seen the smile with which she answered her husband\u0027s half-admiring, half-querulous question. \"You know, dear, I don\u0027t need much. I have not to keep up appearances as you have. You are in the celebrated category of those who cannot afford to be anything but well-dressed. It\u0027s no matter for me, but it\u0027s a matter of business for you.\" \"Ah! I might have known you\u0027d have some self-denying, sensible reason ready; but the puzzle to me is, that you always are well dressed. By Jove, you\u0027re the neatest woman I know, and the prettiest!\" The smile upon her face brightened, but she only shook her head, and went on: \"If Dallas does not get the money, or at least some of it, what do you propose to do? I don\u0027t know.\" \"Do you think he will get the money, Harry? He told you all about it. What are the odds?\" \"I cannot even guess. All depends on his mother. If she is courageous, and fond of him, she will get it for him, even supposing her immediate control as small as she believes it to be. If she is not courageous, her being fond of him will do very little good, and women are mostly cowards,\" said Harriet composedly. \"I never calculated much on the chance,\" said Routh, \"and indeed it would be foolish to take the money if he got it--in that way, at least; for though I am sorry Deane profited by the young fellow, that\u0027s because I hate Deane. It\u0027s all right, for my purpose, that Dallas should be indebted as largely as may be to me. He\u0027s useful in more ways than one; his connection with the press serves our turn, Harry, doesn\u0027t it? Especially when you work it so well, and give him such judicious hints, such precious confidences.\" (Even such praise as this, the woman\u0027s perverted nature craved and prized.) \"You won\u0027t need to take the money from him in formal payment,\" she said, \"if that\u0027s what you want to avoid. If he returns with that sum in his pocket, he will not be long before he--\" A knock at the door interrupted her, and George Dallas entered the room. He looked weary and dispirited, and, before the customary greetings had been exchanged, Routh and Harriet saw that failure had been the result of experiment. Harriet\u0027s eyes sought her husband\u0027s face, and read in it the extent of his discomfiture; and the furtive glance she turned on Dallas was full of resentment. But it found no expression in her voice as she asked him commonplace questions about his journey, and busied herself in setting a chair for him by the fire, putting his hat aside, and begging him to take off his overcoat. He complied. As he threw the coat on a chair, he said, with a very moderately successful attempt at pleasantry: \"I have come back richer than I went, Mrs. Routh, by that elegant garment, and no more.\" \"Bowled out, eh?\" asked Routh, taking the cigar from his mouth, and laying it on the mantel-piece. \"Stumped, sir,\" replied Dallas. Harriet said nothing. \"That\u0027s bad, Dallas.\" \"Very bad, my dear fellow, but very true. Look here,\" the young man continued, with earnestness, \"I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t, upon my soul! I saw my mother--\" \"Yes?\" said Harriet going up to his side. \"Well? \"I saw her and--and she is unable to help me; she is, indeed, Mrs. Routh,\" for a bitter smile was on Harriet\u0027s face, turned full upon his. \"She hasn\u0027t the means. I never understood her position until last night, but I understood it then. She is--\" he stopped. All his better nature forbad his speaking of his mother\u0027s position to these people. Her influence, the gentler, better influence, was over him still. However transitory it might prove, it had not passed yet. Harriet Routh knew as well as he did what the impulse was that arrested his speech. \"You will tell me all about it yet,\" she thought, and not a sign of impatience appeared in her face. \"I--I need not bore you with details,\" he went on. \"She could not give me the money. She made me understand that. But she promised to get it for me, in some way or other, if the thing is within the reach of possibility, before a month expires. I know she will do it, but I must give her time, if it\u0027s to be forthcoming, and you must give me time.\" \"It\u0027s unfortunate, Dallas,\" Routh began, in a cold voice, \"and, of course, it\u0027s all very well your talking to me about giving you time, but how am I to get it? It\u0027s no good going over the old story, you know it as well as I do. There, there,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders, \"I must try and get old Shadrach to renew. I suppose we may as well go at once, Dallas.\" He left the room, followed by Harriet. George Dallas sat over the fire in an attitude of deep dejection. He was sick at heart, and the revulsion of feeling that had begun at Poynings had not yet ceased. \"If I could but be done with it all!\" he thought. \"But I\u0027m in the groove, I\u0027m in the groove.\" \"Come along, George,\" said Routh, who seemed more good-humoured than before, as he re-entered the room, soberly attired, as became a man going to do business in the City. \"Don\u0027t be down-hearted; the old lady will keep her word. Don\u0027t be afraid; and in the mean time, we\u0027ll pull through. Put your coat on, and come along. You\u0027ll give us some dinner, Harriet, won\u0027t you? And if Deane calls, ask him to join us. He won\u0027t,\" he continued, with a laugh, \"because he believes in tavern dinners, and puts no faith in ours. We\u0027re snobs who live in lodgings, George, you know; but he\u0027ll drop in in the evening fast enough.\" The application to Mr. Shadrach proved successful, and George Dallas returned with Stewart Routh to his lodgings, more firmly tied to him than ever, by the strong bond of an increased money-obligation. \"Pretty tidy terms, weren\u0027t they?\" Routh asked Dallas, when he had told Harriet, in answer to her anxious questioning, that the \"renewal\" had been arranged. \"Very tidy indeed,\" said poor George, ruefully: \"but, Routh, suppose when I do get the money, it\u0027s not enough. What\u0027s to be done then?\" \"Never mind about then,\" said Routh, \"now is the important matter. Remember that every then is made of nows, and keep your mind easy. That\u0027s philosophy, as Mr. Squeers says. Your present business is to eat your dinner.\" Stewart Routh had thrown off his low spirits, and had all but succeeded in rousing George Dallas from his. Kindly, convivial, only occasionally coarse, he was a dangerously pleasant man at all times, and especially so to George Dallas when Harriet was present; for then his coarseness was entirely laid aside, and her tact, humour, intelligence never failed to please, to animate, and to amuse him. The dinner was a very pleasant one, and, before it had come to a conclusion, George Dallas began to yield as completely as ever to the influence of the man whose enviable knowledge of \"life\" had been the first medium through which he had attained it. George had forgotten the renewed bill and his late failure for a while, when the mention of Deane\u0027s name recalled it to his memory. \"Has Deane been here, Harry?\" asked Routh. \"No, Stewart, I have been at home all day, but he has not called.\" \"Ah--didn\u0027t happen to want me, no doubt.\" \"Have you seen much of him lately, Routh?\" inquired George Dallas. \"I mean, within the last week or two? While I--while I\u0027ve been keeping out of the way?\" he said, with a nervous laugh. \"Poor boy, you have been down on your luck,\" said Routh. \"Seen much of Deane? Oh, yes; he\u0027s always about--he\u0027s here most days, some time in the forenoon.\" \"In the forenoon, is he? Considering the hours he keeps at night, that surprises me.\" \"It doesn\u0027t surprise me. He\u0027s very strong--has a splendid constitution, confound him, and has not given it a shake yet. Drink doesn\u0027t seem to \u0027trouble\u0027 him in the least.\" \"He\u0027s an odd fellow,\" said George, thoughtfully. \"How coolly he won my money, and what a greenhorn I was, to be sure!! wonder if he would have lost his own so coolly.\" \"Not a doubt of it,\" said Routh; \"he\u0027d have been satisfied he would make it up out of something else. He is an odd fellow, and a deuced unpleasant fellow to my mind.\" Harriet looked at her husband with a glance of caution. It was unlike Routh to dwell on a mere personal feeling, or to let so much of his mind be known unnecessarily. He caught the glance and understood it, but it only angered, without otherwise influencing him. \"A low-lived loafer, if ever there was one,\" he went on, \"but useful in his way, Dallas. Every man has a weakness; his is to think himself a first-rate billiard player, while he is only a fourth-rate. A man under such a delusion is sure to lose his money to any one who plays better than he does, and I may as well be that man, don\u0027t you see?\" \"I see perfectly,\" said George; \"but I wish he had been equally mistaken in his notions of his card-playing science; it would have made a serious difference to me.\" \"Never mind, old fellow,\" answered Routh; \"you shall have your revenge some day. Finish your wine, and Harriet shall give us some music.\" She did so. She gave them some music, such as very few can give--music which combines perfection of art with true natural feeling. This woman was a strange anomaly, full of \"treasons, stratagems, and spoils,\" and yet with music in her soul. Rather early, George Dallas left the pair, but they sat up late, talking earnestly. Things were going ill with Stewart Routh. Some of his choicest and most promising combinations had failed. He had once or twice experienced a not uncommon misfortune in the lot of such men as he;--he had encountered men in his own profession who were as clever as himself, and who, favoured by circumstances and opportunity, had employed their talents at his expense. The swindler had been swindled once or twice, the biter had been bitten, and his temper had not been improved in the process. He was about, as Harriet had said, to take a new flight this time, in the direction of operations on the general public, and he had formed designs on Mr. Deane, which did not, in the increased knowledge he had obtained of that gentleman\u0027s character, and in the present aspect of affairs, look quite so promising as in the early stage of their acquaintance, six weeks before. The operations of gentlemen of the Routh fraternity are planned and executed with a celerity which seems extraordinary to pursuers of the more legitimate branches of industry. Routh had not passed many hours in Mr. Deane\u0027s society (they had met at a low place of amusement, the honours of which Routh was doing to a young Oxonian, full of cash and devoid of brains, whom he had in hand just then), before he had built an elaborate scheme upon the slender foundation of that gentleman\u0027s boasted wealth and assumed greenness. His subsequent experience had convinced him of the reality of the first, but had shown him his mistake as to the last, and gradually his mind, usually cool and undaunted, became haunted by an ever-burning desire to possess himself of the money for ever flaunted before his eyes--became haunted, too, by an unreasonable and blind animosity to the stranger, who combined profligacy with calculation, unscrupulous vice with well-regulated economy, and the unbridled indulgence of his passions with complete coldness of heart and coolness of temper. Routh had no knowledge of Deane\u0027s real position in life, but he had a conviction that had it been, like his own, that of a professional swindler, he would have been a dangerous rival, quite capable of reducing his own occupation and his own profits very considerably. Therefore Routh hated him. When the conference between Routh and Harriet came to a conclusion, it left the woman visibly troubled. When Routh had been for some time asleep, she still sat by the table, on which her elbows rested, her head on her hands, and the light shining on her fair brown hair. There she sat, until the fire died out, and the late wintry dawn came. She was not unused to such watches; wakefulness was habitual to her, and care had often kept her company. But no vigil had ever tired her so much. Her mind was at work, and suffering. When at length she rose from her chair with an impatient shiver, dark circles were round her blue eyes, and her pure waxen complexion looked thick and yellow. She lighted a candle, turned the gas out, and went for a moment to the window. The cold grey light was beginning to steal through the shutter, which she opened wide, and then looked out. She set the candle down, and leaned idly against the window. Weariness and restlessness were upon her. The street was quite empty, and the houses opposite looked inexpressibly gloomy. \"One would think all the people in them were dead instead of asleep,\" she said, half aloud, as she pulled the blind down with a jerk, and turned away. She went slowly upstairs to her bed-room, and as she went, she murmured: \"Where will it end? How will it end? It is an awful risk!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306/90375.html","bookId":420,"book":{"id":420,"title":"Black Sheep","description":"简介： The polite porter who had made the inquiry, and the satirical station-master who had commented on the reply, remained gazing for a minute or two at the stranger who had just arrived at the Amherst station of the South-Eastern Railway, and then went b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3306","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
