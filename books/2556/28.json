{"id":112012,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"SILENCE. ABSOLUTE, TOTAL FUCKING silence. I stand and watch the other door, waiting for it to open, ready to attack. No one\u0027s coming. Is this another setup? More stupid games? Making me wait and trying to get me to panic and crack? Too late for that now. Both doors are locked, but the skylight above is open slightly. I climb up onto one of the chairs, my hands still bound together, and try to haul myself up. The rattling chains are heavy around my wrists, and the frame of the skylight doesn\u0027t feel strong enough to support my weight. I\u0027ll pull it down before I- \"Going somewhere?\" I drop, spin around, and throw myself at the figure standing in the other door. I swing my chain-wrapped hands at his head, hard enough to decapitate him. He manages to somehow duck out of the way, then shoves me in the gut. I trip over the chair I was just standing on, falling back and cracking my head hard against the floor. I roll over and try to get up, but this bastard\u0027s fast. He pushes me back down and plants a boot right between my shoulder blades, stopping me from moving. I brace myself for his next strike, but it doesn\u0027t come, and he lifts his foot off. I look back and watch him walk away. Confused, I drag myself up, using another chair for support, suck in a deep breath of air, and turn around to face him. What? How can he...? \"You must be Danny McCoyne,\" he says, but I can\u0027t answer. \"I\u0027m Sahota.\" Standing in front of me, wearing a smart, if a little crumpled, pin-striped suit and a remarkably clean white shirt, is one of our people. He\u0027s not Unchanged. I do a double take, but I know I\u0027m right. This man is a friend and an ally, and I immediately know we\u0027re on the same side. He\u0027s short and his build is slight, but he stands tall with confidence and composure. The surprise and confusion he obviously sees on my face are clearly not unexpected. \"Apologies for all the subterfuge and bullshit over the last few days,\" he says, gesturing for me to follow him through into the next room. He stops just inside the room as if he\u0027s remembered something important. He checks his trouser pockets, then pulls out a key and undoes the chains around my wrists. He throws them out into the waiting area and closes the door behind us. All I can do is stand and stare at Sahota. I don\u0027t know what I was expecting, but he isn\u0027t it in any way, shape, or form. He\u0027s a good foot and a half shorter than me, dark-skinned, with close-cropped dark hair, graying at the temples. He has a neatly trimmed mustache and wears a pair of wire-framed glasses. For the first time in months I\u0027m suddenly conscious of my shabby appearance-dead man\u0027s trousers and shirt, no shoes, hair long and shaggy, face covered in stubble and bristle. \"Come in and sit down,\" he says, ushering me farther into the room. It\u0027s a wide, spacious, and relatively clean and uncluttered office-cum-living-area. In one corner is a metal-framed bed, similar to the one in my cell but with clean bedding folded back with military precision. Along one wall are several huge, mostly intact windows (only one pane of glass has been boarded up), and in front of me is a large wooden desk with a single chair on either side. Sahota locks the door, then sits down at the desk with his back to the window. He beckons for me to sit opposite. \"Where do you want to start?\" he asks in a clipped, well-educated accent as he pours me a drink and slides it across the table. \"Don\u0027t know,\" I mumble pathetically between thirsty gulps of water. Truth is, I\u0027ve got so many questions to ask I\u0027m struggling to make sense of any of them. \"Don\u0027t worry.\" He grins. \"It\u0027s not unusual. You\u0027ve been through a lot.\" \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve been through.\" He grins again. \"We wouldn\u0027t have done it this way if there\u0027d been any alternative.\" \"So what exactly have you done?\" \"Which one of them looked after you? Selena, Joseph, or Simon?\" \"Looked after me?! That\u0027s not how I\u0027d put it.\" \"Which one?\" \"Joseph.\" \"And what did he tell you?\" \"Lots of bullshit about breaking the cycle, not fighting fire with fire, holding the Hate... He said the more I fought, the harder it would get.\" \"Did you believe any of it?\" I shrug my shoulders. Truth be told, I\u0027m still not sure what I believe. \"Bits of it made sense.\" \"Well, some of what he said must have had an effect on you, because you\u0027re here and he\u0027s still alive. You\u0027d have killed him otherwise.\" \"He said I was only locked up here because of the Hate. He said the more we fight, the less we get.\" \"And what do you think about that, Danny?\" \"I\u0027m not sure what I think.\" \"But you must have some kind of opinion. You can\u0027t tell me an intelligent man like you lay there alone in the darkness for hours and didn\u0027t think about what he\u0027d been told.\" \"I think he was right when he said we were stuck in a vicious circle and that things are only going to get worse...\" \"Go on.\" \"But I don\u0027t understand what difference that makes. What else are we supposed to do? We can\u0027t live with the Unchanged, we have to kill them.\" \"You\u0027re absolutely right.\" \"So how do we win a war without fighting?\" Sahota stands up, picks up his drink, and walks over to the window. He looks out, choosing his next words with care and consideration. \"There is an alternative.\" \"Is there? I can\u0027t see one.\" \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re looking in the wrong place. You need to change your perspective, Danny, and that\u0027s what this place is all about. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here. Tell me, before we brought you here, did you ever hear anything of Chris Ankin and his plans?\" \"I heard his messages when the war started, and I was with a group for a couple of days. They said they were trying to build an army.\" He turns back to face me. \"And what did you think of that?\" \"Gut reaction?\" \"Yes.\" \"As soon as we start grouping together in large numbers, the enemy will blow the shit out of us.\" \"Exactly right. We\u0027re still outnumbered, and they still have a structured military with a just about operational chain of command. We\u0027d only be able to take the fight to them on limited fronts, and yes, they\u0027d probably blow us out of the water. While we\u0027re concentrating on one of their cities, the others would still be standing strong. They\u0027ve already shown they\u0027re willing to sacrifice thousands of their own to try to wipe us out. You\u0027ve only got to look at how they lost London -\" \"What did happen to London?\" \"You didn\u0027t hear?\" \"Not really, only a few details.\" \"It was early on, before these refugee camps were set up. It wasn\u0027t something we planned; rather it was something they couldn\u0027t prevent. The capital was too big for them to defend, too sprawling... London showed us what we could achieve. The fighting on the streets must have been incredible. I almost wish I could have been there. There were hardly any of us in comparison to them, but the panic we caused was beyond anything we could have hoped for. They reached critical mass...\" \"Critical mass? I don\u0027t understand.\" \"The point of no return... the point where it was impossible for them to regain any order, where the number of individual battles was so high and the fighting so intense that they could no longer separate them from us. They didn\u0027t know who was who anymore. The only option left to them was to destroy everything.\" \"They destroyed London?\" \"The whole city and everyone in it. Wiped out thousands of our people, but they took hundreds of thousands of their own with them.\" We\u0027re digressing, and I\u0027m confused. \"I still don\u0027t understand. What\u0027s that got to do with you holding me here?\" \"In the end it was their confusion and panic that destroyed London, simple as that. But like I said, if we\u0027d attacked with an army, they\u0027d have seen us coming and wiped us out before we\u0027d even got close.\" \"You said I was looking in the wrong place...\" \"That\u0027s right, and so were they.\" \"Still don\u0027t get you. Look, I\u0027m sorry, you\u0027ve spent days fucking with my brain, and I\u0027m tired. Stop talking in riddles and just explain.\" \"Have you ever heard of a text called The Art of War?\" \"I\u0027ve heard the title. Don\u0027t know anything about it, though. Never read it.\" \"It\u0027s a Chinese guide to warfare, written by Sun Tzu more than two thousand years ago.\" \"And? What did he know about us and the Unchanged?\" \"Nothing at all! But even though this war is unique, some of Sun Tzu\u0027s tactics for fighting remain as valid today as they were in ancient China. He said that all warfare is based on deception. We have to fool our enemy-make them believe we\u0027re weak when we\u0027re strong, make them think we\u0027re miles away when we\u0027re next to them. \u0027Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\u0027\" Sahota recites the script perfectly from memory. He waits for a reaction from me, but my head\u0027s still spinning, and I can\u0027t make sense of anything. He senses my confusion and explains. \"They\u0027re expecting us to fight head-on. As far as they can see, our only tactic is to fight and keep fighting until we\u0027re the only ones left standing. When you get deeper into the city you\u0027ll see how that stops them from interacting and-\" \"Wait a second,\" I interrupt. \"What do you mean, when I get deeper into the city?\" Sahota grins and pours me another glass of water. \"They\u0027re expecting us to run straight at them with fists flying, screaming in their faces. What they\u0027re not expecting is for us to be standing beside them and alongside them. We\u0027re going to go deep into their cities to stir up trouble and cause them to panic. Then, when they\u0027re too busy tearing themselves apart to notice, Ankin\u0027s army will come into play. We\u0027re going to make them destroy themselves from the inside out.\" \"But how are we supposed to do that? Get within a few yards of any of them and all we\u0027ll be able to do is fight.\" \"Is that right? Didn\u0027t you learn anything from your time with Joseph?\" It finally makes sense. That\u0027s what this place is about. \"Holding the Hate...\" \"That\u0027s exactly it,\" he says, sitting down again and leaning toward me. \"Thing is, this is the only way to teach someone how to do it. If you\u0027re not held or restricted in some way, you\u0027ll kill them before you realize what you\u0027re doing.\" \"But Joseph...?\" \"Joseph and the others are just puppets. They have no idea. They genuinely believe what they tell you, but it\u0027s all just bullshit in the end. Joseph\u0027s the best-or the worst, depending how you look at it. Some days all I want to do is kill him myself.\" \"Incredible...\" Sahota\u0027s eyes are wide with excitement. \"Think of the advantage this gives us, Danny. We know who they are, but they can\u0027t tell us apart until we start fighting. They won\u0027t even know we\u0027re there until it\u0027s too late.\" \"Jesus Christ.\" \"We\u0027re having to move fast. For various reasons things are deteriorating rapidly in the city. Normally we\u0027d have given you a few more days here to make sure you understand, but time\u0027s a luxury we no longer have. This is the perfect time for us to do this. Think you\u0027re up to it?\" Talk about being put on the spot. I fumble for an answer for a second, before realizing that there\u0027s only one thing I can say. \"Yes.\" \"Good man! That\u0027s the spirit! As soon as they told me about you I knew you\u0027d be a good candidate.\" \"What do you mean by that? Who told you...?\" \"We send people out looking for battles. They wait on the outskirts of the fighting, watching out for people like you who manage to demonstrate some degree of control and don\u0027t just attack. Let\u0027s face it, we\u0027d be wasting our time trying to teach this stuff to Brutes, wouldn\u0027t we?! No, we need people like you who are able to take a step back and consider the options before committing to an attack. People who use the Hate and control it rather than letting it control them.\" He looks me straight in the eye. \"Tell me, do you remember when you first stood next to Joseph and didn\u0027t attack?\" \"I remember.\" \"And what were you thinking at the time, Danny? Were you thinking what he was saying was right, or were you just toeing the line to get the best out of a bad situation?\" The memory of the last few days is filled with confusion and uncertainty, the distinction between \"us\" and \"them\" suddenly unclear. But now that I\u0027m away from my cell and Sahota has put his question so simply, the answer\u0027s clear and unequivocal. Everything has been brought back into sharp focus. \"I was playing with him. Stringing him along. Doing what he wanted me to do just to get food and freedom...\" \"Exactly! A perfect answer! From the moment you decided not to kill him, you were in control.\" This is too much to take in. Sahota watches me intently, and I\u0027m uncomfortable under his constant gaze. I try to look anywhere but back at him. The sun breaks through the heavy gray cloud cover momentarily and streams in through the dirty office window. Christ, I\u0027ve been so preoccupied with this bizarre conversation that I\u0027d forgotten my newfound freedom-in the back of my mind I still think I\u0027m chained to the spot. I get up and walk around the side of the desk. \"You local?\" Sahota asks. \"Don\u0027t know yet,\" I answer. \"That depends where local is. Where exactly are we?\" \"Not far from the hospital where we picked you up. A couple of miles maybe.\" \"A couple of miles in which direction? Farther away from the city center or...?\" My words trail away to nothing as soon as I look out of the window. I know this place. Sahota\u0027s office overlooks a narrow parking lot. Beyond that, the long, overgrown back gardens of a row of once well appointed but now derelict houses stretch away. Beyond the houses is a small, sloping, oddly shaped patch of parkland, the brightly painted swings and slides of a children\u0027s play area looking strangely at odds with the chaos of everything else I can see. A narrow track between two of the houses connects the parking lot to the road, and a huge wrought-iron gate prevents anyone unwanted from either getting in or getting out. \"Is this-\" I start to ask. \"Holy Sisters of the Poor, to give it its original title,\" he explains, standing beside me and looking down. \"Strange place, this was.\" \"Strange?\" \"Part convent, part nursing home. Ideal for us.\" He\u0027s not wrong. The huge, strong, brick-built complex is like a fortress. Built in the middle of what used to be a fairly affluent area, and hidden from view by houses on all sides, it\u0027s set back off the road and surrounded by enough tall fences, gates, and walls to keep even the most determined intruder out. Most people wouldn\u0027t even have known it was here at all. From what I remember, this used to be a convent, which became a church-run, community-funded rest home. I\u0027m sure Lizzie\u0027s dad, Harry, had a friend living here for a while... \"This is Highwell, isn\u0027t it?\" \"We\u0027re on the border between Highwell and Steply, to be precise.\" \"But that\u0027s...\" \"About two miles from the center of town.\" \"Yes, so we\u0027re...\" \"Already in the city. Right on the innermost edge of their exclusion zone.\" \"Christ... How many people like us are here?\" \"Not many, just me and a couple of others at any one time. Apart from me this place is almost exclusively staffed by my team of idiot Unchanged pacifists who think they\u0027re saving the world. As soon as people like you have learned how to control their emotions I send them out into the city. Like I said, the situation\u0027s deteriorating rapidly out there. We don\u0027t have a lot of time to waste.\" For a moment all I can do is stand in silence and stare out of the window. Beyond the parking lot and the houses, everything appears completely lifeless and still. There are the usual telltale signs of battle, and everything appears even more overgrown and wild than I remember, but the world otherwise just seems abandoned and empty. The longer I look, though, the more I see. In the distance a single helicopter flies toward the city center, visible only in the gaps between the tops of trees. There\u0027s a pile of corpses in the park, dumped in a flower bed. Closer, in the shadows of the parking lot directly below, several Unchanged carry bags of supplies between one building and another, constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of attack. Along the road to my far right, a battered car is slowly approaching. It enters the complex through another gate and narrow passageway, then stops in the shadows of the tall perimeter wall. I watch as two Unchanged deliver another fighter like me, his arms and legs already tightly bound. It strikes me that the irony of what\u0027s happening here is beautiful; these fools think they\u0027re working toward some kind of salvation, but all they\u0027re doing is training their own assassins. \"I\u0027ve set up a number of sleeper cells right in the heart of the city,\" Sahota says. \"I want you to join one of them.\" \"Okay,\" I answer quickly and without thinking through any implications. It\u0027ll get me out of here, and right now that\u0027s the most important thing. \"I\u0027ll get your stuff brought up, and I\u0027ll give you directions, contact information, and some supplies. Get out there, get used to being neck deep in the enemy, then find your cell.\" \"And then?\" \"And then you sit and wait for the signal.\" \"The signal?\" \"When the time\u0027s right, all the cells will be instructed to take up positions deep in the heart of the city. Then, when we\u0027re ready, each cell will start fighting, causing as much panic as possible. Just imagine it, Danny... sudden swells of violence, loads of them in random locations, and all happening at the same time for no apparent reason. The enemy won\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. They won\u0027t even see us there. They\u0027ll look straight through us and turn on each other, and it\u0027ll be beautiful, like dropping a match into the gas tank of a car. Before you know it, the whole city will be tearing itself apart. Think of it... we\u0027ll be less like terrorist cells, more like cancer cells.\" It sounds magnificent. All too easy. \"So all we have to do-\" \"All you have to do,\" he interrupts, correcting me, \"is get in there, wait until we\u0027re ready, then cause as much mayhem and carnage as you can.\" I stare out of the window again, trying to fully appreciate the importance and danger of what I\u0027m being asked to do. \"This is an honor, Danny. You\u0027ve shown incredible strength and self-belief to get this far. What you\u0027re going into the city to do will never be forgotten.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-28.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
