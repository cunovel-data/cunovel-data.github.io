{"id":112021,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"I HEAR THEM TALKING, but I keep my eyes shut. My hands are bound and strapped to radiator pipes behind me, and my ankles are tied together. There\u0027s blood in my mouth, trickling down the inside of my throat. Someone trips over my feet, but I force myself not to react. I half-open one blood-caked eye and see Mark trying to drag a pregnant woman away from me. She sees that I\u0027m awake, then squirms free from him, turns back, and boots me in the gut. Can\u0027t defend myself. I take the full force of her foot right in the middle of my stomach, and I\u0027m suddenly doubled up with pain, gasping for air and choking on the semicoagulated blood in my nose and mouth. Christ, that bitch is wild. It takes two of them to pull her away from me and hold her down. If I didn\u0027t know better she could almost pass for one of us. Maybe she is. Maybe she\u0027s been conditioned to fight like I\u0027ve learned not to. Mark and an Asian man keep the pregnant woman away at a distance. Lizzie catches my eye, then strides across the room toward me, grabs my shoulder, and pulls me over until I\u0027m sitting upright opposite her with my back against the radiator. She looks straight into my face, then slaps me so hard I almost fall back down. \"You killed my dad, you fucker,\" she spits. \"I loved you and you killed my dad!\" What am I supposed to say? She\u0027s right, and I don\u0027t regret any of it. I could kill everyone in this room and not give any of them a second thought. Except Lizzie, perhaps. I can\u0027t take my eyes off her. It\u0027s suddenly like we\u0027ve never been apart, and for a single brief and foolish moment the irrevocable difference between us seems trivial and unimportant. She slaps me again. I try to turn away, but she still hits me with full force. The pain\u0027s good. It wakes me up. I start trying to get my hands free of the plastic ties they\u0027re using to hold me. \"We should kill him,\" the pregnant woman snarls, holding her swollen belly. \"That\u0027d make us as bad as him,\" Lizzie answers quickly before turning her attention back to me. She\u0027s nervous. Scared. She forces herself to talk to me. \"Why are you here?\" \"Looking for you,\" I answer quickly. \"Haven\u0027t you hurt me enough?\" \"Not about you. Ellis. Need to know what happened to her.\" \"Why?\" \"Why do you think? She\u0027s like me. She should be with me.\" \"What, so you can let her loose outside to kill? So you can let her run wild and...?\" I shake my head and stare into her face again, still trying to get my hands free behind me. \"I want to take her with me. I want to look after her and take care of her. I don\u0027t want her out there fighting on her own.\" \"I don\u0027t want her fighting at all. She\u0027s just a kid...\" \"I just want her with me, Lizzie. I want to keep her safe.\" Lizzie slumps back and drops to the floor opposite me, head held in her hands. The Asian guy is still mumbling and cursing at me from the corner of the room. The pregnant woman watches my every move, not daring to look away. Mark tries to appear collected and in control, but I can sense his terror. I feed off their collective fear. It\u0027s empowering. Even together they\u0027re no match for me. \"He\u0027s here to kill us,\" Mark says. \"Katie\u0027s right, we should have just got rid of him. This was a bad idea.\" I shake my head and spit a lump of bloody phlegm onto the carpet. \"Not interested in any of you. Just Ellis. Let me know what happened to her and I\u0027ll go.\" \"Don\u0027t listen to him. Let him go and the fucker will kill us.\" I shake my head again. \"I won\u0027t. I can control it. I\u0027d never have got this deep into the city if I couldn\u0027t. I can hold the Hate. They taught me.\" \"Who did?\" Lizzie asks. \"People like you.\" \"This is bullshit,\" the pregnant woman yells. \"Why you?\" \"Not just me. Others, too...\" \"But why...?\" \"Haven\u0027t you heard what\u0027s happening outside? It\u0027s a coordinated attack,\" I explain, suddenly desperate for Lizzie to understand. \"I came here with other fighters, but I broke away to try to find you.\" \"I don\u0027t understand...\" \"I\u0027m not interested in killing any of you. I just want to know what happened to Ellis. Tell me what happened to her and I\u0027ll go and you\u0027ll never see me again-\" \"Let him take her,\" the pregnant woman says. \"Get the evil little bitch out of here-\" \"Shut up, Katie!\" Mark yells. What did she just say? I can\u0027t believe what I\u0027m hearing. This must be bullshit. She can\u0027t really be here, can she? How could they have kept her hidden and stopped her from attacking for so long? I look from face to face in search of an explanation. \"Ellis is here?\" \"In the bathroom,\" she shouts, trying to get up again, pointing at a door in the wall opposite me as Mark pushes her back down and tries to cover her mouth. \"Here? But how...?\" Still slumped on the floor in front of me, just out of reach, Lizzie starts to sob. \"I couldn\u0027t let her go. I knew she was like you, but it didn\u0027t matter. Even when she killed the boys I couldn\u0027t bear to let her go...\" Her words dry up as tears take over. I keep trying to move my wrists and bend and stretch my legs to break my binds. Got to get up and get to Ellis... \"He can take her,\" says the pregnant woman. \"Let him take her.\" \"We can\u0027t trust him,\" Mark snaps at her. \"Does it matter? Throw the pair of them out the door and let them take their chances-\" Another thunderous explosion interrupts her. They\u0027re getting closer and more frequent now. At this rate the city will have fallen long before 6:00 a.m. \"She\u0027s right,\" I tell Lizzie, begging for her to listen and understand. \"I promise I won\u0027t hurt you. I\u0027ll take Ellis and you\u0027ll never see either of us again.\" Mark moves forward and picks up the bloodied baseball bat. \"As soon as we let him go he\u0027ll turn on us,\" he says, sneering atme. \"For fuck\u0027s sake,\" I scream at him in frustration, \"will you just listen to what I\u0027m saying? I don\u0027t want to kill any of you-\" \"Come on, Lizzie,\" the pregnant woman says, calmer now, lowering herself down and kneeling on the floor next to her. \"You said yourself you can\u0027t help her. This is the best option for all of us.\" \"She\u0027s right,\" I agree, as if they\u0027re going to listen to anything I say. Lizzie glares at me. She\u0027s in an impossible situation-whatever choice she makes, she loses. No matter what she is and how I feel about her now, I\u0027m surprised that it still hurts me so much to see her like this. She\u0027s shaking her head. \"I can\u0027t. I just can\u0027t let her go...\" \"You don\u0027t have long,\" I tell them. \"The city doesn\u0027t have long. I can get her to safety. Get her out of here before it\u0027s too late.\" \"You\u0027ve hardly got any medication left for her, Liz. You can\u0027t hold her if she\u0027s not sedated. Have you thought about that?\" \"Of course I have,\" she sobs, looking back and staring at the pregnant girl. \"I just can\u0027t stand the thought of her being out there on her own. She\u0027s only five-\" \"But she won\u0027t be on her own,\" I interrupt. \"She\u0027ll be with me.\" \"Come on, Danny,\" she sighs, wiping her eyes. \"You were hardly the world\u0027s greatest dad at the best of times. What chance has she got with you now?\" \"More chance than she\u0027s got without me. Look, you\u0027re not thinking straight. Stay here and you\u0027re all dead. This is the best option for her. The only option...\" The hotel room is momentarily silent, the only noise coming from outside. Vibrations shake the floor and walls. Even the Asian man has finally shut up. Lizzie holds her head in her hands. \"I just can\u0027t. You don\u0027t understand. She\u0027s not like you, remember,\" she says. \"She\u0027s-\" Before she\u0027s finished speaking, the pregnant woman moves. She lunges toward me, catching me and everyone else completely off guard. She grabs my head and pulls me forward, then leans down behind me. I try to shake her off, but she\u0027s too heavy and I\u0027m squashed under the bulk of her unborn child. As quickly as she attacked she\u0027s up again. She stands opposite, holding one of my knives in her hand. What has she done? Has she cut me or...? Wait. My hands are free. My legs still tied together, I push myself off the wall and reach out for Lizzie. She manages to scramble back out of the way, but the other woman\u0027s not as quick. I grab her right foot and pull her over. She hits the ground right in front of me. Mark tries to react, but the Unchanged are reassuringly slow, and by the time he\u0027s made a grab for her I\u0027ve already got her held tight. I wrap one arm around her throat and hold the knife to her face. Stupid bitch. At least I\u0027ve temporarily silenced the constant fucking noise coming out of her mouth. I lean forward and cut the ties around my ankles, then slowly stand up. Mark goes to move toward me again, but I prick the woman\u0027s cheek with the tip of the blade, and the sight of her blood and the sound of her half-choked screams is enough to stop him. I kick the bathroom door open, and it takes a second for my eyes to adjust to the gloom. Lying bastards, it\u0027s empty. She isn\u0027t here. There\u0027s a thin mattress on the floor, some sheets, empty bottles of water, and the remains of medication, food wrappers... but no Ellis. I can smell her scent, but she\u0027s gone. \"Where is she?\" I yell, turning back around and holding the blade up to the woman\u0027s eye. \"Safe,\" Lizzie answers. \"Let Kate go, Danny.\" In desperation Mark tries to run at me again, but, like all of his kind, he thinks too long instead of acting on instinct. I\u0027m far faster than he is, and I see him coming a mile off. Even with the weight of this bitch in my arms he\u0027s no match for me. I kick him in the balls and send him reeling. \"Where?\" I yell again. \"Let her go and I\u0027ll take you,\" Lizzie says. I stare straight into her face again and tighten the pressure around the other woman\u0027s neck. Is she telling the truth? Do I have any choice? I could be in touching distance of Ellis, but without Lizzie I might as well be miles away. Mark rolls around at my feet, groaning. \"Please...\" he whimpers pathetically. I could kill her, but I don\u0027t. Suddenly all I can think about is Joseph Mallon. I can see his face and can hear his damn voice echoing around my cell, telling me not to fight fire with fire, to break the cycle. Was he right? As the city crumbles around us, can I risk not following my instinct and letting these fuckers live? Could it really be that the more I fight today, the more I stand to lose? I let the woman go. She falls to her knees and crawls away on all fours, gasping for air. Lizzie walks over to me, stopping only when we\u0027re almost touching. \"I just need to know that you\u0027ll look after her and get her to safety.\" \"Where is she?\" I shout, struggling to keep control and not attack. \"Just tell me where-\" \"I need to hear you say it, Danny.\" \"I promise you, Liz. I\u0027ll get her as far away from the city as I can. I\u0027ll look after her. She\u0027s all I\u0027ve got left.\" \"Then you\u0027ve got more than I have,\" she sobs. She looks into my eyes, and I can\u0027t look away. \"We moved her last night,\" she finally admits. \"We couldn\u0027t risk keeping her here any longer.\" \"What have you done with her?\" \"She\u0027s safe. Mark and I were going to try to get her out of the city. It was the lesser of two evils...\" Mark gets up. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys, which he throws to Lizzie. \"Take him.\" \"I can\u0027t...\" she says, beginning to cry again. \"It\u0027s the only option. Listen to what\u0027s happening outside, Liz. It\u0027s all fucked. He\u0027s right, at least she\u0027s got a chance this way.\" \"But what if...?\" \"I won\u0027t hurt you,\" I tell her, meaning every word but still not knowing if she believes me. \"All I want is Ellis. Take me to her and you\u0027ll never see me again.\" She nods her head but still doesn\u0027t move. \"Just give him the keys,\" the pregnant woman says. \"Let him find her for himself. Stay here with us.\" Lizzie shakes her head and wipes her eyes. \"No, I\u0027ll go. I just want to see her again. One last time.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-37.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
