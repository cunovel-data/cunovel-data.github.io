{"id":112002,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"JESUS, MY HEAD HURTS.\\n\\n Where the hell am I? It\u0027s dark, pitch black almost. I\u0027m lying flat on my back on a narrow bed, naked but for a T-shirt and shorts. I try to move, but my ankles and wrists have been chained to the four corners of the metal bed frame. There\u0027s no slack, and I can\u0027t even lift my hands up off the mattress. The harder I try, the tighter the chains seem to get. I try to move my head, but there\u0027s some kind of strap right across my forehead, keeping me down. When they come back I\u0027ll kill the fucker that\u0027s done this.\\n\\n My eyes are getting used to the lack of light in here, but there\u0027s not a lot to see. It\u0027s a narrow, rectangular room with this bed against one wall and a chair opposite. There\u0027s nothing on the walls except for a lopsided crucifix just to the side of the solid wooden door. Istretch my neck back as far as I can. There\u0027s a small, boarded-up window behind me, the faintest crack of light showing around the edges.\\n\\n How long have I been here? Have I just woken up, or have I been out cold for days? I feel myself starting to panic, and I make myself breathe slowly and work my way back through what I remember... the children at the school, traveling with Paul, the fighting at the hospital, the Unchanged in the streets who chased me down and drugged me... We were set up, and the bastards who did it must be the ones who brought me here. I pull on my chains again, but I still can\u0027t move. I don\u0027t understand this. It doesn\u0027t make sense. If they really were Unchanged, why didn\u0027t they just kill me? Why bring me here, wherever here is?\\n\\n Someone screams. Can\u0027t tell where the noise is coming from. Don\u0027t know if they\u0027re screaming for help or crying with pain. Is this a torture chamber? A place where sick, perverted Unchanged fuckers tie us up and make us suffer? Bastards could come in here any second and start on me and there\u0027d be nothing I could do. Maybe they\u0027re experimenting? Trying to find out what makes us better and stronger than them by cutting us up? How many others before they get to me? Is it my turn next?\\n\\n Concentrate.\\n\\n Calm.\\n\\n Focus.\\n\\n I think about killing to keep me strong. I think about all the Unchanged I\u0027ve massacred over the months and how I\u0027ve gotten rid of each one of them. I remember all the pointless lives I\u0027ve ended and how easy it was and will be again.\\n\\n Ellis.\\n\\n Just for a second, from out of nowhere, I think about Ellis, and everything comes crashing down again. The chains feel tighter and the darkness closes in and I can\u0027t move a fucking muscle. I\u0027ve failed her. She\u0027s out there on her own somewhere while I\u0027m locked up here like a fucking animal. Every minute she\u0027s alone out there increases the chance of her ending up like the kids in the school. I try to move again, pulling as hard as I can and thinking for a second that I can break the chains and get out of here, but nothing happens and the ties just get tighter. I feel like I\u0027m in the line outside the cull site again, standing there and waiting to die. And there\u0027s nothing I can do about it.\\n\\n My arms hurt. They feel heavy and numb. Shoulders are burning with pain. Got an itch on the side of my right leg, just above the knee, and all I want to do is scratch it. I try to ignore it, but it won\u0027t go. Now it\u0027s all I can think about, and the more I think about it, the worse it gets. Now it\u0027s like someone\u0027s dragging the point of a needle up and down across my skin, and it\u0027s driving me fucking crazy.\\n\\n Good.\\n\\n Focus.\\n\\n Concentrate on the pain and block everything else out.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-18.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) \\n The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged. Each group believes the other to be the enemy; each group is fighting for survival. Only by working together can the enemy – whoever that enemy is – be defeated. There are no other choices. Danny McCoyne has managed to break free, and after days of indiscriminate fighting and killing, he is determined to make his way home, to recalim the only thing of any value to him in this strange new world: his daughter Ellis. Unlike his wife and son, Ellis is like him, and he knows, in his heart of hearts, that she is not dead. His dearest wish is for Ellis to be fighting for the world at his side – but Danny soon discovers his daughter is worth far more than just another fighting body. Others like him have discovered that children are absolutely vital to the cause. They are strong, small, fast, and they have no inhibitions. They are pure Haters...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dog-blood-hater-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:26 AM"}}
