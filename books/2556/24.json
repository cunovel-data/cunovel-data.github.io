{"id":112008,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"IT FEELS LIKE AN eternity has passed before he comes back again. He enters the room hurriedly and doesn\u0027t look at me or speak. Unusually, he leaves the door open. I can see two other Unchanged men waiting outside, and my pulse starts to quicken. Is this my execution party? But that goes against everything he said earlier. I don\u0027t know what to think. I\u0027ve lost track of what\u0027s bullshit and what\u0027s fact. Mallon removes the strap across my forehead, then lies on the floor and does something to the chains holding my arms and legs down. I try to lift my head and look, but I can\u0027t see anything. He\u0027s out of sight under the bed for a couple of minutes doing Christ knows what; then he scrambles back up and brushes himself down. He stands on the other side of the room and looks at me. \"There you go, you can-\" Before he\u0027s even finished his sentence I\u0027ve realized the shackles have been detached from the bed frame. I swing myself around in a sudden single, painful movement and use my weight to throw myself forward and stand up. My legs and arms are cold, numb, heavy, and unresponsive, but I know this is my chance to kill him. I raise my aching arms and stretch a length of chain between them, ready to wrap it around the fucker\u0027s filthy neck and squeeze the life out of him. I lunge, but he sidesteps easily, then sticks out a foot and trips me. I fall quickly, too fast to put my hands out and stop myself. My left shoulder clips the edge of the chair, and then my head smacks against the wall. I roll over onto my back in agony, head spinning and vision blurred. Mallon stands over me. He looks down, shakes his head, and tuts. \"Do you think I\u0027m stupid?\" He moves the chair out of the way and sighs with disappointment. \"Honestly, Danny, weren\u0027t you listening to anything I said earlier? Haven\u0027t you worked it out yet? The more you struggle and fight, the less you\u0027re going to achieve.\" In the confusion of my pathetic, fumbled attempt to attack, I managed to kick the door shut. It opens again, and Mallon gestures for the two men outside to come in. One of them, a huge, evil-looking bastard, grabs the chains hanging from my wrists and hauls me up onto my unsteady feet with worrying ease. If he\u0027d been like us, I think to myself, he\u0027d have been a Brute. He grips my arms tight, and it feels like I\u0027m being squeezed in a vise. There\u0027s nothing I can do about it. The other man walks toward me and puts something over my head. It\u0027s a pillowcase, I think, thin enough for me to be able to breathe but thick enough to block out the light and stop me from seeing. The chains around my ankles are padlocked together. The floor is cold and wet under my bare feet. \"Stay calm and keep your temper in check and you\u0027ll be okay,\" Mallon says. \"Fight back and you\u0027ll regret it.\" Is that a threat or just a warning to play by his rules? Whatever, the slight glimmer of hope I\u0027d been feeling since Mallon\u0027s earlier visit has gone now and has been replaced by fear. What are they going to do to me? I\u0027m completely at the mercy of these foul bastards, and there\u0027s nothing I can do about it. I feel like a failure, ashamed that I\u0027ve been beaten by the Unchanged. Even if I did manage to fight them off, I\u0027m still bound and chained. I\u0027d never get away. \"Move,\" the huge man standing behind me grunts in my ear, his voice deep, loud, and emotionless. He shoves me square in the middle of my back, and I fly forward, barely managing to stay upright and not trip over the chains between my feet. I almost fall, but one of the men-it might even be Mallon-catches me and pulls me back up. Head bowed, all I can see is my dirty, shackled feet. My legs feel leaden with pain and weak with nerves as I realize this could be my final walk. All that crap about not fighting fire with fire and trying to break the cycle... it was all lies-a cheap, pathetic ruse to keep me occupied and catch me off guard. And the worst thing of all is how easily I fell for it. I should have seen through the bullshit. They were just trying to keep me pacified to make it easier for them to kill me when they\u0027re ready. What am I walking toward? A firing squad? A stoning? The room where I\u0027ll be given my lethal injection? I try to stop-try to turn around and fight my way out of this-but the fuckers surrounding me are having none of it. They restrain me, but they don\u0027t strike back, not even allowing me the satisfaction of going down fighting. When I stop struggling again, they relax their grip and let me walk on alone. The journey to my final destination feels endless. I think about Ellis, and then about Lizzie, Josh, and Edward, and the pain and frustration is too much to stand. I start crying like a fucking baby, sobbing and shaking and pathetic. We turn right, and I trip through another doorway, stubbing my toe on a low step. This must be it. I\u0027m led across a wide, open space by one of the men before being stood still-exposed, prone, and vulnerable. I feel him tugging on my chains, removing the shackles from my feet; then I hear the clink of metal on metal as another chain is wrapped tight around my waist, then attached to something behind me. I wait and listen as he walks away again, heading back in the direction from which we just came. I\u0027m left here alone, swaying slightly, wrists still bound, my heavy legs still stiff and aching after endless hours of inactivity. I lean forward until the slack is taken up and the chains become tight enough to support my weight. I look down at my bare feet and the grubby, years-old carpet, crying pathetic tears of anger and desperation that bounce and splash off the floor. What will I see when they uncover my head? Will they even bother? Maybe they\u0027ll just shoot me blind. I picture the two men standing at the other end of the room on either side of Mallon, both of them holding guns aimed in my direction. They could fire at any second. These might be my last few seconds of life. My legs feel like they\u0027re about to give way, but I\u0027m determined to stand proud and defiant and face this like a man. But this wasn\u0027t how it was supposed to end... The pillowcase is whipped off my head and dropped on the floor. I close my eyes for a split second, then open them wide again and look up. Mallon is backing away from me. He\u0027s the only other person here. I\u0027m standing alone in a large, open room, chained to the back wall by an industrial-strength bracket. The fear starts to lessen, and uneasy, tentative relief takes its place, but I know it\u0027s not over. Just because he hasn\u0027t killed me yet doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s not still going to. The room is bright and cold. There are windows along one wall, but they\u0027re too far away and too high to see through. I can see the very tops of distant trees and the squally, rain-filled sky, nothing else. Mallon watches me intently, then turns and leaves. The temporary relief immediately disappears with him. What happens next? Is this another gas chamber? There\u0027s no pipework or exhaust fans that I can see, but there are red and brown splashes and stains on the grubby wall behind me-blood, shit, and Christ knows what else. There are two filthy buckets over to my right, one of them full of water. Waterboarding? Torture? But I don\u0027t have any secrets or restricted information, so what can they hope to get from me? Or is it worse than that? Is Mallon about to start playing masochistic games with me? Rape me, even? Whatever he decides, there\u0027s nothing I can do about it. But when it happens I\u0027ll fight the fucker until either he\u0027s dead or I am. He\u0027s back, this time carrying more food and a pile of clothes. My last supper? \"Move back,\" he says, watching me carefully. \"Right up against the wall.\" I do as he says, shuffling backward but not risking turning around. Mallon edges forward to the spot where I was standing, watching me constantly. He puts down the clothes and the food, then moves back again. He sits down a safe distance away. \"Help yourself.\" Stunned, I can\u0027t help speaking. \"What?\" \"I said help yourself. The food tastes like shit today, but it\u0027s warm and it\u0027s better than nothing. And the clothes are from a dead man, I\u0027m afraid. But hey, they don\u0027t stink of piss like yours do!\" I don\u0027t move. He gestures for me to come closer, and I slowly start to edge forward, moving like a bear circling a bloody lump of fresh meat in the middle of a trap. Is the food I\u0027m shoveling into my mouth poisoned? It wasn\u0027t before. I sit down cross-legged and start eating, too hungry to care. I can\u0027t tell what it is I\u0027m eating, and he\u0027s right, it does taste like shit, but that doesn\u0027t matter-it\u0027s food. It\u0027s finished too soon, and I wash it down with another bottle of stale, lukewarm water. \"Better?\" Mallon asks, stretching out on the floor and appearing surprisingly relaxed. \"I\u0027ll get you some more later. There\u0027s soap and water for you to wash with in one of those buckets over there. Scrub yourself down, Danny. Get rid of the stink and try to make yourself feel human again.\" I don\u0027t argue. I get up and move over to the buckets. They\u0027re just inside the reach of the chains. I take off my soiled shorts and rip off my shirt (the shackles on my wrists preventing me taking it off any other way), then start to wash. There\u0027s an inch of disinfectant at the bottom of the other bucket, and its purpose is obvious. I drag it closer to the wall, turn my back on Mallon, and squat and shit. I wipe myself clean on the torn clothes I\u0027ve just discarded. I wash myself as best I can, then dry off with a blanket that Mallon throws over to me. I pull on a pair of trousers that just about fit, then wrap the blanket around my shoulders to keep warm. I walk toward Mallon until the chains are at full stretch. Bastard just sits there and looks up at me. He knows I can\u0027t reach him. But then-to my complete amazement and disbelief-he throws a bunch of keys and some other stuff out of reach and stands up. He waits, psyching himself up; then he walks closer, so close we\u0027re almost touching. \"All we need-\" he starts to say, but I shut the fucker up. I grab his collar, spin him around, and slam him down on the floor. He tries to fight me off, but I brush him aside. He\u0027s had this coming for too long. I drag him nearer to the back wall, his stumpy, pudgy, pathetic limbs flailing, then take up the slack from the chain around my right wrist and wrap it around his neck. He splutters, showering me with foul Unchanged spittle, and his already bulging eyes grow wider still. I pull tighter, feeling his life slipping away, focusing on the image of him lying dead at my feet. \"Kill me,\" he says, his breath a hissing, choked whisper, \"and you\u0027ve lost everything.\" I pull harder, feeling the chain digging into his neck, constricting his windpipe and cutting off his air supply. Then I stop. What did he say? Is he right...? He flops over onto his front, gasping for breath, and starts to crawl away. He\u0027s barely gone a yard when I snap myself out of this stupid malaise. I reach out, grab his leg, and drag him back, feeling myself getting stronger by the second. I roll him over and form my hand into a chain-wrapped fist. I\u0027m ready to smash it into his face when he speaks again. \"Break the cycle.\" I punch him, just catching his jaw as he turns his head away. I straddle his out-of-shape body, a knee on either side to stop him moving, ready to end his miserable life. My left leg is wet. He\u0027s pissed himself with fear. \"Now who stinks of piss?\" I lift my fist again, and he raises his arms to cover his face. \"Please, Danny. Show some control. Kill me now and they\u0027ll leave you chained up here to rot.\" I pull my fist back even farther. If I hit him this time I know I\u0027ll finish him. \"Think about your family. Think about what you could do if you got out of here.\" Bullshit. Is it? He\u0027s right about one thing-I\u0027m still chained to the wall and I can\u0027t escape this room. And I know he only mentioned my family for effect, but how can I do anything to help Ellis if I\u0027m stuck here and left to starve? I can see the keys on the floor, well out of reach. Against my better judgment-against everything I feel and believe-I stand up and step back. Mallon scrambles to safety, holding his mouth and spitting blood onto the floor. Is the fucker going to leave me here now? He staggers away, then stops. Still rubbing his jaw, he turns around and grins, blood covering his yellow-white teeth. \"You did it! I knew you could!\" \"What?\" \"You did it, Danny. More to the point, you didn\u0027t do it.\" I don\u0027t understand. He sits down, exhausted, breathing heavily. I walk as far as the chains will let me. \"I gave you a chance to kill me, and you didn\u0027t take it. You almost did, but you stopped yourself. You held the Hate.\" \"Only because-\" I start to explain. He holds up his hand to stop me talking and washes out his mouth with water from my bottle. One of us must have kicked it across the room in the fight. He spits red-tinged water out onto the dirty carpet. \"Doesn\u0027t matter why,\" he says, \"fact is you did it. Takes a person of intelligence to do that. Someone who can look beyond all this hatred and fighting and see what\u0027s really important.\" Patronizing bastard. \"I made a mistake and you got lucky.\" He shakes his head. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"I do.\" \"No,\" he says, his voice suddenly more serious, \"you\u0027re wrong. This is what happened-I gave you an opportunity to kill me, which you instinctively tried to take. But, before you could do it, you stopped and weighed up the pros and cons. And you realized your choice was pretty stark: kill me and rot here, or let me go and survive.\" Bastard. He\u0027s right. \"What\u0027s important,\" he continues, \"is the fact that you overruled your instincts. Like I said, you held the Hate.\" I can\u0027t argue. I want to, but I can\u0027t. I sit down opposite him. I should have killed him, but I didn\u0027t. What does that make me? I feel strangely dirty and defiled, as if I\u0027ve just made the most embarrassing, basic mistake, like a teenaged boy caught jerking off by his mom. In the distance I can hear the muffled thump and bangs of explosions. Elsewhere the fighting continues. It should have continued in here, too. I should reach across, grab hold of him, and kill him now. But I don\u0027t. \"So how did it happen to you?\" he asks, mouth still bleeding. \"I\u0027ve told you my story, Danny, what your people did to my family. Now you tell me yours.\" I say nothing. \"Come on... what have you got to lose by talking to me? Face facts. I could have had you killed when you first arrived here, but I didn\u0027t. I could have done it myself, but instead I\u0027ve fed you, watered you, I haven\u0027t tortured you... You don\u0027t have any information I want, no top secret plans of attack... There\u0027s no need for you not to speak now. You\u0027ve already done the hard part; now finish the job. Break the cycle. Talk to me like the rational human being I know you really are. It\u0027s up to you.\" I can see the frustration in his face. Truth is, I\u0027m not trying to be defiant now. I\u0027m thinking about what he said. Either he\u0027s right and I\u0027ve got nothing left to lose, or it\u0027s too late and I\u0027ve already lost it all. Or is my sudden pathetic weakness just a result of the physical and emotional stress of captivity? Have I just lost the ability to think straight? \"Back in your room yesterday,\" he continues, \"you flinched when I mentioned your family. Those things I found in your bag, the doll and the clothes... Do you want to start there? Are they trophies or reminders?\" I try hard to hide it, but my reaction when he mentions my family is disappointingly obvious. He immediately picks up on it. \"So what happened? Were you with them when you changed? Are you carrying around some kind of guilt because you killed the people you used to love?\" Can\u0027t help myself. He\u0027s hit a nerve. \"My only guilt is that I didn\u0027t kill them.\" My voice sounds loud and overamplified, alien and strange. \"Tell me more...\" \"I was confused, disoriented,\" I tell him, my words sounding angry, strangled by emotion. \"Should have killed them, but I didn\u0027t. They caught me off guard.\" \"Partner?\" I nod my head. \"Kids?\" \"Three. One like me, two like you.\" He looks confused. \"One like you?\" \"Ellis, my daughter.\" \"What happened to her?\" I\u0027m about to tell him, but I stop myself, suddenly remembering that I\u0027m talking to one of the Unchanged. Don\u0027t want him to know she\u0027s the reason I came back to the city. \"Her mother took her,\" I answer, spitting out the words. He nods slowly, trying to make it look like he understands. \"Must be hard to deal with,\" he says. \"I mean, I thought I\u0027d had it bad, but at least I know what happened to my family. I know they\u0027re both dead and I\u0027ve had closure, but you, you don\u0027t have a clue where any of them are or even if they\u0027re still alive.\" \"I should have killed them,\" I say again. \"I can\u0027t begin to imagine what you\u0027ve been through. The realization you were a killer must have been hard enough. How did they get away?\" \"I was disoriented. I\u0027d kill them in a heartbeat if they were here now.\" \"You didn\u0027t kill me.\" \"No, but I-\" \"You\u0027re from around here, right?\" he interrupts. \"Depends where here is.\" \"What about the other two kids?\" \"Two boys. One older, one younger than my girl.\" \"Really tough,\" he says quietly, shaking his head and rinsing his bloody mouth out again. \"So how have you coped?\" Is he mocking me now? \"I\u0027ve killed as many of you fuckers as I\u0027ve been able to find,\" I answer, feeling my body start to tense up again. \"Except me.\" \"There\u0027s still time...\" \"Okay,\" he says quickly, leaning back and looking up at the ceiling, \"but has it actually helped? Has it got you any closer to getting your daughter back? I presume that\u0027s what you were heading back to the city for?\" Christ, I have to give him his due, he\u0027s good. That one came from out of nowhere. \"I\u0027ll find her if it\u0027s the last thing I do.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" \"Is it?\" He nods his head vigorously. \"Of course it is. It shows there\u0027s more to you than just wanting to fight and kill all the time. You still give a damn about your daughter, and that means you\u0027ve still got a chance. Honestly, Danny, most of the people like you who come through here are complete no-hopers, only interested in killing. You, you\u0027re different. You\u0027re thinking further ahead than the next battle.\" \"Doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t fight. Doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t still kill you.\" \"Of course not, but from where I\u0027m sitting, killing me would be the worst thing you could do. How would it help? Like I said earlier, you\u0027d just be fighting fire with fire. Just stop for a second and work your way back, Danny. Think about everything that\u0027s happened to you to bring you to this point. The Hate has taken everything you ever had. It\u0027s stripped you of your soul and your identity. It\u0027s stopped you functioning as a human being.\" \"It hasn\u0027t. I know exactly-\" \"You\u0027ve lost everything because of it... your family, your home, your daughter. If it wasn\u0027t for the Hate you might still be with her now. Christ, man, it\u0027s even cost you your dignity and your freedom. You\u0027ve spent the last two days lying in a bed of your own piss, tied up and caged like an animal. And at this precise moment in time, you\u0027re close to losing control of your future, too. If I wanted to I could walk out of here right now and not look back. I could leave you here alone to starve and die. You don\u0027t know where you are, how many other people are here, what\u0027s on the other side of the door to this room... Face it, Danny, right now all you have is me.\" He stops talking and waits for me to respond, but I can\u0027t. All I can do is stare back at his barely human face. Is he right? He shuffles forward until he\u0027s just within reach. Is he taunting me? Testing me? \"People tell me I\u0027m wasting my time with your type. They tell me you\u0027re no better than animals, that you\u0027ve got dog blood running through your veins and you should be rounded up and shot.\" \"I don\u0027t care what they-\" \"You know what I tell them? I tell them they\u0027re wrong. But you\u0027re the only one who can really decide who\u0027s right. If the boot was on the other foot and I was your prisoner, Danny, what would you do now?\" \"I\u0027d-\" \"Stupid question. We\u0027d have never got to this stage. You\u0027d already have killed me. You could do it now if you want to, but I think you\u0027re better than that.\" He moves forward again. I move to scratch the stabbing itch by my right knee, which has just returned, and he flinches. He\u0027s trembling. Is this just part of the act, or is his fear genuine? \"Cooperate with me and prove the rest of them wrong. Show me you can control your emotions and I\u0027ll help you. I can get access to records. I could try to find out what happened to your daughter.\" That doesn\u0027t ring true at all. It smacks of desperation, and he knows it. \"Bullshit.\" He shrugs his shoulders. \"It might be, but what have I got to gain? More to the point, what have you got to lose?\" Head\u0027s spinning. Can\u0027t take all this in. Can\u0027t think straight. My heart says kill, but something\u0027s telling me to wait because he\u0027s right, fighting has got me nowhere. And if there\u0027s even the slightest chance he\u0027ll be able to help me, should I take it? He leans back and picks up the keys. He takes one of the keys off the ring and throws it over to me. \"For the chains around your wrists,\" he says. \"Take them off and finish getting dressed.\" I do as he says, stretching my arms and flexing my muscles. The freedom feels good after endless hours of being wrapped in chains. I walk back across the room to the pile of clothes. All the time, Joseph stays seated on the floor. He\u0027s within the reach of the chains around my waist. We both know I could kill him if I wanted to. He\u0027s terrified, I can see it in his eyes, and that gives me strength to hold my nerve. I hold the Hate. Maybe I\u0027ll give him a chance. If he lets me down, I\u0027ll kill him. v THE TORRENTIAL RAINS WERE unexpected, weather forecasts a long-forgotten luxury. The flash floods wreaked unprecedented destruction on the city center refugee camp and its densely packed population. Those living out on the streets bore the brunt of the pain as almost a month\u0027s worth of rain fell in less than two hours, literally washing away scores of people and their few remaining belongings. Blocked and broken drains stopped the water from draining away, transforming many streets and pavements into stagnant lakes. The basements and ground floors of countless buildings flooded. Almost half of the military base in the municipal park was washed away, with a huge number of refugee-occupied tents being lost. Then, to add insult to injury, as quickly as the rains came, they disappeared. Thankfully the sun remained hidden behind a layer of heavy cloud for most of the day, but the summer heat and a few sharp bursts of sunlight were enough to dry out and bake the bedraggled world below. Every outdoor surface was caked in a layer of foul-smelling mud, a grubby tidemark on building walls a grim reminder of how high the floodwaters had climbed. Huge mountains of rain-soaked garbage and waste began to ferment, the insect population feeding on them seeming to multiply by the hour. Constant helicopter patrols continued to police the border and the exclusion zone. All scheduled missions outside the city were temporarily abandoned as, for once, the already severely depleted military forces turned their attention to the thousands of people supposedly in their care. Their orders were simple: Get as many people off the streets as possible (living or dead), then clear the major routes through town. Ahead of the motley collection of vehicles that crawled slowly along Arley Road, groups of soldiers on foot moved from building to building through the early evening darkness. One of the snowplow-fitted trucks was used to clear a route through, pushing tons of sodden waste toward the gutter and leaving a noxious, three-foot-high drift of garbage in its wake. Hazmat-suited soldiers followed it along the freshly scraped pavement, pulling corpses from the mire and loading them into the backs of the yellow refuse and recycling trucks that had been recently commandeered from the now-dissolved city council. A group of three soldiers emerged from a building that had once been a large house but in more recent years had been converted into office space. By flashlight, one of them spray-painted a simple message onto the brick wall beside the door, a message for those who followed. 37 INSIDE 6 DEAD 20 MORE Ignoring the countless frightened questions and the grabbing hands of the refugees who surrounded them, the soldiers moved on to the next building. Thirty-seven survivors, six bodies to remove, space for twenty more inside. There was a sudden loud thump on the door of room 33. Mark jumped up from the space on the damp floor where he\u0027d been trying to sleep and ran to the door, tripping over Kate\u0027s father\u0027s leg, which hung out of the bed. He pressed his eye against the spyhole. \"Who is it?\" Kate asked, standing close behind him. \"Soldiers.\" \"Don\u0027t let them in.\" \"I have to.\" The lead soldier thumped the door again and yelled for them to open up. \"Don\u0027t,\" Kate pleaded. \"If I don\u0027t open it they\u0027ll batter the damn thing down.\" Before she could protest he pulled the door open. Three soldiers barged through, pushing him to the side. They stood in the middle of the room, each of them shining a flashlight around, exposing every corner of the small, cramped space. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Mark asked, positioning himself directly in one of the beams of light. \"Assessing space,\" the soldier replied, looking around, his voice devoid of interest or emotion. \"How many you got here?\" \"Five of us. And five\u0027s more than enough. There\u0027s barely enough room as it is. We can\u0027t fit anyone else in-\" \"Who?\" \"What?\" \"Who\u0027s here?\" \"Me, my girlfriend, her parents, and my cousin\u0027s wife. And my girlfriend\u0027s pregnant. Like I said, there\u0027s no room for anyone else.\" One of the other soldiers made a note on a clipboard. The others continued to look around. Kate forced her way between them, stopping one of them from getting around the side of the double bed. She stood in front of him, thrusting out her pregnant belly for maximum effect. \"He told you. There\u0027s no more space here.\" The soldier ignored her, moving her out of the way, then ducking down and glancing under the bed. He shined his flashlight onto the bed\u0027s occupants, the two wizened, starving, elderly refugees shaking in fear under the sheets like characters from a Roald Dahl story. \"Your parents?\" She nodded. He spun around. Lizzie sat on a chair in front of the bathroom door, her legs drawn up beneath her, nervously chewing on her nails. She kept her eyes down, refusing to look up. Mark tried diplomatically to coax the soldiers back out. \"My cousin\u0027s partner,\" he explained, keeping his voice low so she couldn\u0027t hear him. \"He was, you know... one of them? She lost her kids, and it\u0027s really fucked her up. Honestly, man, it\u0027s not a good idea to put anyone else in here with us. What with the baby coming and-\" \"Not my decision, pal,\" the soldier said. \"But I\u0027ve been a volunteer,\" he protested. \"I\u0027ve been outside the city with you. I\u0027ve been-\" \"Not my decision,\" he said again. With that the soldiers left the room. Mark slammed the door shut and leaned against it, staying there until he was sure he\u0027d heard the door to the next room opening. He started to walk back to the others, but Kate stopped him. \"We can\u0027t go on like this,\" she whispered. \"We should find somewhere else for her. It\u0027s not safe here.\" \"And where exactly is safe these days?\" He sighed, leaning back against the door again. \"But she\u0027s-\" \"She\u0027s family. They all are.
