{"id":112015,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"ARE YOU MCCOYNE?\" I sit up quick. Eyes blurred. Where am I? No chains. Dull gray light. I look around and try to make sense of my surroundings. It\u0027s one of the upstairs rooms in the social club. I found these cushions on a sofa downstairs and- \"Are you McCoyne?\" the voice asks again from somewhere behind me. Neck\u0027s stiff. I look back over my shoulder and see a figure standing in the open doorway. \"Yeah, what\u0027s the problem?\" \"No problem. Come with me.\" He turns and disappears, and I\u0027ve got no choice but to follow. The building is cold, and I jog across the landing to catch up with him. I recognize him now. His name\u0027s Craven. Julia introduced me to him yesterday. I think he\u0027s her right-hand man. We enter the largest upstairs room. Julia and another man are sleeping here. Craven gestures for me to sit down next to him at a table in the corner, where he fires up a laptop. I saw him using it when I first arrived. \"Have we got power here?\" I ask, noticing that there\u0027s a power cable connected to the back of the computer. Dumb question. \"Sort of,\" he answers, sounding as tired as I feel. \"There\u0027s electricity a few streets away. We\u0027ve just run a cord here to keep the laptop going.\" \"What, an extension cord?\" He looks at me, dumbfounded. \"Yes, a fucking extension cord.\" He shakes his head and turns his attention to the laptop. I watch as he logs on to some kind of central database. Is this the same system that Mallon talked about? My knowledge of this kind of thing is limited, and I don\u0027t want to piss him off any more than I already have by asking him how the hell he can connect to anything from here, or even what\u0027s left to connect to. There are all kinds of things hanging out of the back of the machine-wires running into small black boxes and the like-I guess the secret\u0027s there, somewhere. My mind wanders as I watch him working. I stop thinking about what it is he\u0027s doing, and instead I just look at the bright display and listen to the sound of the keyboard clicking as he types. I used to hear that noise all day, every day at work. It takes me back... \"Sorry about the early wake-up call,\" he mumbles, still concentrating on the screen. \"Access to the system\u0027s intermittent, so we have to make the most of it when we can. They\u0027re usually running automatic maintenance at this time of day, so the security\u0027s easier to bypass...\" His words fade away as the screen changes and he concentrates on entering more details. \"There... got it.\" \"Got what?\" He slides the laptop over to me. \"We\u0027re in. Enter your details.\" \"What details?\" \"Your name, date of birth, last known postal code.\" I start jabbing at the keyboard with two fingers. It\u0027s months since I typed anything. \"Wait,\" he says. \"Danny short for Daniel?\" \"Yes.\" \"Put your full name in.\" I do as he says. \"What\u0027s all this about? What are we doing?\" I ask. \"Killing you,\" he replies without a hint of sarcasm. \"Killing me?\" \"Thing about this war,\" he says as he takes the laptop back again, \"is that it\u0027s made everybody\u0027s priorities change. Everyone\u0027s worried about their physical safety, and some of the things that used to matter now get forgotten about or overlooked. This is a prime example. This is just about the only national system that\u0027s still running outside of defense, and anyone with half a brain can hack into it and make alterations.\" \"But what exactly is it you\u0027re doing?\" \"Is that you?\" he asks, angling the screen back toward me. I scan the details. \"Yes, that\u0027s me.\" \"Right,\" he continues, working his way through various menus and submenus. \"Ah, good, you\u0027re dead already!\" \"What?!\" \"They\u0027ve got you down as being dead. Tell me, did you ever have one of those neck tests or a mouth swab?\" \"Yes, why?\" \"Because that\u0027s where most of this information comes from. They used it as kind of a census and tried to test pretty much everyone when everything first kicked off. It\u0027s a \"who\u0027s what,\" rather than a \"who\u0027s who,\" if you get my meaning.\" \"Sort of. Anyway, I\u0027m not dead.\" \"According to this you are.\" He clicks a button and scans another screen. \"Hunter\u0027s Cross. Ring any bells?\" \"Doesn\u0027t mean anything to me.\" \"It\u0027s a gas chamber. They\u0027ve got you down as being killed there.\" \"I ended up inside one of those places, but I got out when it was attacked.\" \"There you go, that explains it. They probably marked you off as being dead when they sent you down. Close shave, eh?\" \"Too close.\" \"That\u0027s it, then,\" he says, starting to close up the laptop. \"You can go back to sleep now.\" \"Wait a second,\" I say quickly, putting my hand on the lid of the machine and stopping him from closing it. \"Can I...?\" He seems to immediately know what I want. He\u0027s probably done this for plenty of other people before me. \"Be quick,\" he whispers. \"If Julia catches me letting you do this she\u0027ll have my balls.\" My hands are suddenly shaking with nerves. I look down at my details on the screen, but there\u0027s nothing on there that I didn\u0027t already know (apart from the fact that, apparently, I\u0027m dead). \"How do I...?\" \"Looking for family?\" \"Yes, my daughter.\" \"Start there,\" he says, pointing at the bottom of the screen. I click on a button marked other people listed at this address. There\u0027s a pause of several seconds; then a blank screen is returned. My heart sinks. \"How old was she?\" \"Five.\" \"Either she hasn\u0027t been listed or she\u0027s listed elsewhere. Try searching on her name.\" I enter Ellis\u0027s details and press search. Still nothing. \"Was she with anyone?\" \"Her mother and brothers.\" \"Search for them, then.\" I try Elizabeth McCoyne-no match. In desperation I try my son Edward. He\u0027s listed at an address I don\u0027t recognize, as is his brother. They\u0027re both marked as being dead, and, just for a second, I feel a sharp pang of pain. It quickly fades when Craven starts making noises. \"Come on,\" he whispers, \"that\u0027s enough. Julia will have a fucking fit.\" \"Wait a second,\" I say quickly, desperate not to let go of the computer yet. \"Now!\" \"Just one more...\" I turn my back to him and cover the keyboard as I type. I search for Elizabeth Parker, remembering that Lizzie only took on my name informally for the sake of the kids. She always used her given name on official forms. I stare at a blank screen and frantically flashing cursor. Craven looks over his shoulder. The faster I need a result, the slower this system seems to get. \"Come on,\" he says, sounding agitated. It finally returns a screen full of results-eight Elizabeth Parkers are listed. I scroll down to the right date of birth and click on Lizzie\u0027s entry. She\u0027s listed at a hotel, and I quickly memorize the address. The Prince Hotel on Arley Road -I think I know it. Pressing my luck, I click the other people listed at this address button once more and just manage to scan down the first part of a huge list of names before Craven wrestles the laptop away from me and slams the lid down. I think I saw one of my cousins\u0027 names, Mark Tillotsen, but no sign of Ellis. I get up and turn around. Julia is standing behind me. \"Whoever it was,\" she warns, \"forget them.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-31.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
