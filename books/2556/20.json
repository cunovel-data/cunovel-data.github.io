{"id":112004,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"I HEAR A SCREAM in the darkness, but I can\u0027t tell whether it\u0027s coming from somewhere inside this building or outside. In the smothering darkness everything has lost its form and definition. I have no concept of time or how long I\u0027ve been here. I tried counting the drips, but my tired brain can\u0027t keep track, and now the noise each drip makes is like a hammer blow to the head. I can\u0027t stay still, but I can\u0027t move either. Every time I pull on my chains they seem to tighten even more.\n I don\u0027t know how long it\u0027s been since I last drank anything, but my bladder\u0027s been filling steadily. I won\u0027t shout out and put myself at the mercy of Joseph Mallon or any other Unchanged scum here. That\u0027s what he wants. He\u0027s trying to get me to break under pressure by starving me and keeping me chained up and in the dark. I\u0027m better than him. I won\u0027t let him get to me. But at the same time I can\u0027t stop my body from doing what it\u0027s supposed to. I pissed myself a while back. What else could I do? It was either that or shout for Mallon. Now I\u0027m soaked with strong-smelling urine. It was warm, but my bare legs are freezing now, and I stink. That bastard has reduced me to this, but I won\u0027t let him beat me.\n My body aches. My legs and arms are numb. Never thought it could hurt so much to stay still for so long. Just wish I could get up and walk around. And God, I\u0027m so fucking hungry. My empty stomach keeps cramping so bad it feels like it\u0027s turning itself inside out. Don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do when I need to shit. Not even going to think about it until it happens. Have to try to keep myself distracted, but it\u0027s impossible when I can\u0027t see or hear anything and when I can\u0027t move and when I don\u0027t know where I am or how long I\u0027m going to be here...\n Stop.\n Focus.\n This is what he wants. He\u0027s trying to push me over the edge. It won\u0027t work. I won\u0027t let it work.\n Leg\u0027s itching again. Worse than before.\n Helicopter. Long way off...\n How long before you go crazy in the dark? A kid at school-long, long time ago-said it was just hours if there\u0027s absolutely no light at all. Pointless thinking about time, because I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ve been lying here. Part of me is starting to wish Joseph Mallon would come back just to break the monotony. Never thought I\u0027d actually look forward to seeing one of the Unchanged, but staring at that evil piece of shit\u0027s face would be better than lying here staring at nothing, just thinking. Don\u0027t like being able to think like this. Makes me question things I\u0027ve known all along are right. Makes me start to doubt myself. Makes me think stupid, crazy thoughts about Ellis-how close I might have got to her and how far I am from her now. I was within a couple of miles of Lizzie\u0027s sister\u0027s house, and now I could be anywhere.\n What\u0027s my little girl doing? Is she fighting? Is she already dead? Is she in another room in this building? Is she in the room next door? What if Mallon doesn\u0027t come back? What if I\u0027ve fucked up and blown my chance with him? What if he leaves me here to starve to death, strapped to a piss-soaked bed?\n What a fucking failure. All that noise and fighting and bullshit-four months of it-and I\u0027ve let myself get beaten by an unfit, overweight Unchanged who looks like he couldn\u0027t fight his way out of a paper bag. He can\u0027t be the only one running this place. There were at least four out on the street when they got me, and none of them were as fat and out of shape as Mallon.\n Thinking about the street makes me think about the hospital and how I criticized Paul for running headfirst into a one-sided fight that I thought was a setup. At least he went out fighting. For all I know he might still be out there while I\u0027m stuck here...\n I\u0027m starting to get scared.\n The dripping noise is getting louder and faster.\n Thought I felt something moving on the bed.\n Thought I saw a flash of light.\n Am I hallucinating now?\n Am I going out of my fucking mind? Going crazy in the dark? Need to keep focused, so I try to remember Ellis\u0027s face. But the harder I concentrate, the less I see. I\u0027m scared I\u0027ll forget what she looks like. The face I see now isn\u0027t her, it\u0027s a combination of the faces of the feral kids we found in the school this morning... or yesterday morning... or whenever the hell that was.\n Leg hurts.\n Just want to scratch that fucking itch. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-20.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dog Blood (Hater #2) \n The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged. Each group believes the other to be the enemy; each group is fighting for survival. Only by working together can the enemy – whoever that enemy is – be defeated. There are no other choices. Danny McCoyne has managed to break free, and after days of indiscriminate fighting and killing, he is determined to make his way home, to recalim the only thing of any value to him in this strange new world: his daughter Ellis. Unlike his wife and son, Ellis is like him, and he knows, in his heart of hearts, that she is not dead. His dearest wish is for Ellis to be fighting for the world at his side – but Danny soon discovers his daughter is worth far more than just another fighting body. Others like him have discovered that children are absolutely vital to the cause. They are strong, small, fast, and they have no inhibitions. They are pure Haters...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dog-blood-hater-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:26 AM"}}
