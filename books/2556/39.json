{"id":112023,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"BLOOD-SOAKED AND PANTING HARD, Ellis sits in the diagonally opposite corner of the van and watches me. What has she become? Does she even remember who I am? She hasn\u0027t tried to kill me. She\u0027d have attacked if she thought I was a threat.\n \"We have to go, Ellis. We have to get away from here. It\u0027s not safe. People are going to try to kill everyone here. Do you understand?\"\n No reaction. No time to wait for an answer. I take her rainbow-colored sweater out of my backpack and edge closer to her.\n \"Put this on. Keep you warm.\"\n I reach up to put it over her head. She swipes it out of my hands. I pick it up and try again, but she\u0027s not having any of it, and I drop it. She hisses at me and pushes herself farther into the corner. Poor kid, it\u0027s hard seeing her like this. I\u0027d naively expected her not to have changed much. Maybe I\u0027d just been trying to convince myself she wouldn\u0027t be like the kids we found at her school. She\u0027ll be better now that we\u0027re together.\n \"Come on, we\u0027re going,\" I tell her, forcing myself to move. I grab the knife and flashlight in one hand and Ellis\u0027s wrist with the other and drag her out of the back of the van. We hit the ground, and she immediately tries to pull away from me, but I won\u0027t let go. I drop the flashlight, shove the knife into my belt, and lean back into the van again. With outstretched fingers I reach the long length of cord they\u0027d used to tie her legs together. It\u0027s wet with Lizzie\u0027s blood. Ellis keeps pulling against me, her strength and persistence hard to control, but I manage to keep hold and pull her closer. I tie one end of the cord around my waist and the other around hers like a leash. Christ, there\u0027s hardly any meat on her at all. The chubby puppy fat I remember around her belly has gone. She\u0027s lean and sinewy now-just skin, muscle, and bone.\n \"In case we get separated, okay?\"\n Still no reaction.\n \"Ellis, can you hear me?\"\n She looks into my face but doesn\u0027t respond. Now that she\u0027s attached to me I let her go, and she immediately darts away, almost dragging me over when the cord pulls tight. I try to haul her back, but she\u0027s fighting against me constantly.\n \"Stop! Ellis, sweetheart, it\u0027s Daddy...\"\n I\u0027m struggling to keep my footing. In the brief lightning flash of an explosion outside, I see that she\u0027s trying to undo the cord. I run toward her and scoop her up into my arms again. She kicks and squirms to get free.\n \"Calm down,\" I whisper, my mouth next to her ear. \"Please, Ellis, just stop...\"\n My words have no effect. Got to get out of this garage. Maybe she\u0027ll respond better if she can see me clearly and if she can see what\u0027s happening around us. Disoriented, I head the wrong way and find myself trying to get through the rubble at the collapsed front of the building. I double back on myself, past the open van and Lizzie\u0027s body, trying to retrace my steps back out. Someone shines a light in my face. I can\u0027t cover my eyes, so I instinctively screw them shut. I almost drop Ellis but manage to tighten my grip before she falls.\n \"Let her go,\" an immediately familiar voice orders.\n \"Julia? How did you...?\"\n \"I followed you. We knew you were looking for your kid, and Craven showed me what you found on the system.\"\n \"But what about the plan? The fighting?\"\n \"What about it? Have you seen what\u0027s happening out there? The chain reaction\u0027s started, McCoyne. They\u0027re turning on each other.\"\n \"So you\u0027ve got what you wanted. The city\u0027s falling apart and-\"\n \"I can\u0027t let you take her. Kids like this are the future. We need them more than you can imagine-\"\n \"She\u0027s staying with me.\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand. Sahota and Preston both-\"\n \"No, you don\u0027t understand. Ellis is my daughter, and I\u0027m responsible for-\"\n \"Your only responsibility is to this war.\"\n \"But I\u0027ll take her back to the others. I promised Preston I\u0027d-\"\n \"Do you think I\u0027m stupid? If I let you go you\u0027d disappear and we\u0027d never see either of you again. I can\u0027t take that risk. She\u0027s coming with me, and you should be proud to let her go. We\u0027ll take her, and she\u0027ll help us hunt more of them down until the last one\u0027s dead. Your kid\u0027s already more of a fighter than you\u0027ll ever be, and you should-\"\n \"She\u0027s my little girl. I don\u0027t want her to fight.\"\n \"You dumb bastard, do you think you have a choice? Just let her go.\"\n I don\u0027t answer. I run forward, trying to find a way past. Julia comes at me, and I drop Ellis to defend myself. Another flash of the light blinds me for an instant, and the sudden tightening of the cord as Ellis darts away pulls me off balance. Julia swings a punch and catches me on the side of the head. I\u0027m knocked back and sent reeling by the unexpected angle of her attack. I trip over something hard and heavy in the dark behind me and find myself on my knees in some kind of oily inspection pit. I feel the cord tighten again, and I immediately grab it and try to pull Ellis back. It gets even tighter, then goes taut, then drops down loose as Julia cuts through it.\n \"Ellis!\" I shout as I scramble out of the pit. Julia drops her flashlight, and for a split second I catch a fleeting glimpse of her shape as she sprints through the office and back outside, barely managing to drag Ellis behind her. I chase after them, over the land at the back of the garage, through the wooden gate, then out along the cobbled passageway. It\u0027s packed with people, far more than before, all of them running to escape the carnage that is steadily consuming the center of town. Can\u0027t see Julia-she\u0027s just one among hundreds now.\n I follow the stumbling crowd until we reach the end of the passageway. I look in all directions and shout for Ellis, but my calls go unanswered, most probably unheard. Too many people. I start to wade through them, unable to see anything through the waves of foul, barely human flesh that constantly crash into me. I grab the knife from my belt and start hacking into those nearest to me, not interested in killing, just wanting them out of the way. The sun\u0027s almost up now, but the light\u0027s still poor. Dirty smoke drifts everywhere like horror film fog.\n Someone grabs me from behind. I spin around to defend myself, but they\u0027re not attacking, just trying to get through. I\u0027m on my back in the gutter in a puddle of rancid rainwater before I know what\u0027s happening. My wrist cracks against a curb, and I drop the knife. I reach out for it, but it\u0027s kicked away by one of the stampeding crowd. Before I can get up someone plants a boot right in the center of my chest. Suddenly struggling to breathe, I roll over and manage to crawl away through the forest of legs. Other Unchanged trip and stumble over and around me, but I force myself to keep moving until I reach the side of the street where their numbers are fewer. I\u0027m next to a badly decayed body in a deserted shop doorway when my hand rests on a length of metal tubing about a yard long. It looks like it was a fence post or part of a road sign, but it\u0027ll make a decent weapon. I use it to help me get up, then head back into the crowd again, swinging it around like a samurai sword. On a vicious, upward arc, the jagged end of the tube hits an Unchanged woman on the side of the head, tearing her flesh from below her ear up to the corner of her eye. I swing the tube again and more of them go down like I\u0027m cutting down crops, scything a path through the chaos.\n There\u0027s an overturned wreck of a car in the middle of the street. The crowd splits to go around either side of it, but I climb onto it. The burned-out skeleton of the car is precariously balanced on its roof, and it quivers and vibrates with my every move. Another helicopter flies overhead, and I instinctively duck and turn around to watch it disappear, looking back toward town.\n Then I see her.\n I\u0027m surrounded by a sea of heads, but back in the direction from which I\u0027ve just come, there\u0027s a break in the crowd-a small, unexpected bubble of space. I struggle to see through the smoky haze and constant, uncoordinated activity, but then I glimpse a flash of remarkably fast movement. It\u0027s Ellis. Finally free and unrestricted, she\u0027s killing at an incredible rate. I can see her leaping from victim to victim with ferocious speed and intent, using nothing but her hands and teeth to kill. She wraps herself around each one of them, does enough damage to fatally wound them, then gets up and attacks her next victim before the last one\u0027s dead. Even after everything I\u0027ve seen, my daughter\u0027s ruthless, savage brutality is incredible. Awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal measure.\n There\u0027s Julia. I steady myself as the overturned car rocks again, then watch as she chases after Ellis. Holding on to what\u0027s left of the cord with one hand, she chops at the Unchanged around her with what looks like a meat cleaver held in the other. She\u0027s struggling. Ellis is too strong and too fast for her.\n I swing the metal pipe out over the side of the car like a golf club, taking out several more refugees and almost decapitating one of them. I jump down into the space where they were standing, then hold the tube out like a lance and run forward, shoulder dropped, toward where Julia and Ellis are fighting. I follow the trail of bodies, tripping over outstretched limbs and slipping in pools of blood and gore that Ellis has left in her wake. An unusually aggressive Unchanged comes at me with a machete. The downward sweep of the blade glances off my shoulder but does little damage, and I\u0027m gone before he can take a second swipe.\n Julia\u0027s dead ahead of me now, being virtually dragged along by Ellis as she\u0027s fighting. Yet another helicopter powers overhead, this one releasing a volley of screaming missiles into the crowd nearer to the center of town. I can feel the heat of the missiles as they scorch through the air above me, the shock wave from the explosions in the distance almost knocking me off my feet. Julia lifts her cleaver and chops it down into the pelvis of a slow-moving Unchanged man before the vibrations knock her off balance, too. She steadies herself and pulls back on Ellis\u0027s leash. The momentary delay is enough for me to catch her. I grab hold of her shoulder and spin her around.\n \"Let her go, Julia.\"\n Distracted, she almost lets the cord slip through her fingers. She drops her weapon, snatches back the plastic-covered line with both hands, then tries to wrap it around her wrist. Her face is bruised, her right eye swollen purple and almost completely shut. Did Ellis do that to her?\n \"Help me with her,\" she demands.\n \"Help you?\" I yell back, using the metal pole to shove an unsteady Unchanged out of the way. \"Are you serious? Let her go-\"\n \"We have to get her out of here. Help me!\"\n More missiles explode, vast swollen bulges of intense orange flames rising up from the area around the Prince Hotel, far too close for comfort. What choice do I have? I drop the pole and grab the cord, taking the strain from Julia. Together we begin to reel Ellis in. I catch a glimpse of her through the swarming crowds. We\u0027re dragging her back, but she\u0027s still fighting, still grabbing as many Unchanged as she can, sinking her teeth and claws into their skin, slashing and tearing at their flesh. She\u0027s just a yard away now, still pulling against us but unable to overcome our combined strength. Julia runs around from behind me and grabs Ellis by the waist, lifting her clean off the ground. Ellis drops the body of a young Unchanged kid midkill, then manages to squirm around in Julia\u0027s grip. I try to force myself between them and take my daughter from Julia, but Ellis unintentionally elbows me in the face, her bone catching me full force between the eyes. Blood begins pouring from my nose.\n Julia staggers away, trying to keep hold of Ellis and at the same time deflect the constant barrage of kicks and punches coming from her. My girl is like a child possessed, fighting with a savage strength and intensity beyond her years. They disappear into the crowd again for a few heart-stopping seconds until, as I spit out blood from my broken nose, I catch sight of the clothesline on the ground. I drop down and grab hold of it, reeling Ellis in again. I find her sitting on top of Julia, her thumbs sunk deep into the woman\u0027s bloody eye sockets, repeatedly lifting her head up and then smashing the back of her skull down onto the asphalt. Julia thrashes her arms wildly, but there\u0027s no strength left in her, only movement. Ellis squeezes again and Julia stops suddenly, limbs falling heavy. Ellis lifts Julia\u0027s head, then slams it back down once more, then looks up and springs away. The cord whips out of my hands, burning my skin.\n \"Ellis!\"\n She leaps up at another Unchanged woman who\u0027s running toward her. The woman catches her with surprise and is then slammed back down onto the road, overcome by the unexpected force of the attack. Ellis kills her, then stands up and drags another one down, then another and another, and I\u0027m transfixed until an Unchanged man slams into me from one side. I grab his collar, flip him over, and smash the sole of my boot into his face. The exhilaration is incredible. Suddenly, now that I have Ellis with me, this is all that matters. Another one of them comes at me with a knife. I grab his hand, twist it around with such force that I hear his elbow pop and crack, then plunge the blade into his own chest. I pull the bloody weapon back out and then, without thinking, grab a handful of hair from the head of another, yank it back, and draw the knife quickly across its exposed neck, feeling it slice easily through flesh. Beside me Ellis launches herself at a kid just a little older than she is. The kid fights back, almost getting away, before Ellis forces it over to the side of the road and smashes its head through a low window.\n And this, I realize as I kill again and again without resistance, is what I\u0027d always said I\u0027d wanted. I\u0027m fighting freely, without restriction or fear, and Ellis is by my side, doing the same. Except she\u0027s not here. I\u0027ve lost sight of her again. I shout her name, but the chaos around me now is all-consuming. The helicopter circles overhead again, and the panicking crowd pushes me back farther. I try to carve my way through them, but getting through these people is like trying to swim against the strongest current imaginable. Through a momentary gap I see Ellis racing away, moving diagonally across the street, jumping from body to body, from kill to kill, slithering through the crowd. She jumps up onto the back of one unsuspecting man, snaps his neck, then leaps over to her next victim before the first corpse has fallen. Then she\u0027s gone again. Lost in the midst of the madness.\n What has she become? She\u0027s a savage, feral monster, a million miles removed from the Ellis I knew and remembered, but she\u0027s still my daughter. Seeing her like this is heartbreakingly sad, but, at the same time, there\u0027s a part of me that\u0027s incredibly proud of what she is now and how bravely and strongly she\u0027s fighting.\n Got to get to her.\n I\u0027m struggling to keep going. I\u0027m panting with effort, legs heavy and lungs empty, barely able to keep moving, and yet the tide of Unchanged refugees coming toward me is endless. I try to force my way between them, but every time I take a step forward I\u0027m pushed several steps back. Got to keep moving. Can\u0027t stop now...\n The roar of another missile fills the air. It hits the side of a building less than a hundred yards ahead, puncturing a hole in the wall, then exploding outward, showering the entire street with debris. When the explosion fades, everything becomes silent and still. I stand motionless as the last few refugees to have escaped the blast continue to push past me. I slowly move closer to the blast zone as the sound gradually begins to return-the screams and moans of the injured and dying, a single car alarm that\u0027s somehow still working, the crackle and pop of flames, the hiss of fractured pipes...\n Can\u0027t see Ellis.\n I stand alone at the edge of a massive expanse of rubble and fallen bodies. Around me, a few people begin to move again, crawling through the debris, slowly picking themselves up and staggering on. I walk deeper into the madness, slowly at first, then starting to run. I trip and slide over the remains of people under my feet.\n Where is she?\n I run faster, barely managing to stay upright in the midst of the carnage. The closer I get to the epicenter, the fewer complete bodies there are. I look down and all I can see now is dismembered limbs and other, less recognizable chunks of bloody meat. I can\u0027t move, can\u0027t think straight, the stench of smoke and burning flesh filling my bleeding nostrils. Can\u0027t focus. I can hardly breathe. Have I lost her? Against all the odds, Lizzie kept Ellis safe for weeks on end. Just minutes with me and she\u0027s gone.\n Can\u0027t give up.\n There are more people moving all around me now, some of them disentangling themselves from the bloody wreckage, others continuing to flood forward from the center of town, picking their way through the gruesome ruins, the explosion just delaying their escape temporarily. I slowly cross what\u0027s left of the street, trying to see through the smoke and haze and line myself up with the buildings close to where I last thought I saw her. As I get nearer I drop to my knees and start to crawl through the bloody mire, pushing away the grabbing hands that reach up at me, desperate for help. My knee sinks down into the open chest cavity of a young Unchanged man, physically forcing his last breath from his lungs. Another one of them catches hold of my coat, and I pry its surprisingly strong fingers away when I see a small, child-sized hand sticking out from under two heavy cadavers. I drag the corpses out of the way, desperate to dig Ellis out from beneath them. She\u0027s facedown on the asphalt, a pool of deep red, almost black blood spilling out around her head. I put my hands under her shoulders, pull her out, and turn her over, but it\u0027s not her. Thank God. I drop the body and keep moving.\n There are Unchanged moving all around me again now. Most are injured; all are terrified. I increase my speed, determined to find Ellis, literally throwing wet chunks of human remains over my shoulder as I look for any sign of her. Then I see it-the severed end of the plastic clothesline. As more munitions explode around me, showering me with dust and dirt, I pick up the end of the cord and follow it back, terrified at the thought of what I might find at the other end. I catch sight of a bare ankle that\u0027s smaller and thinner than the rest. I haul another blood-soaked body out of the way and shove it to one side, jumping with surprise when it opens its eyes and screams in pain and grabs hold of me. Underneath another corpse I see Ellis\u0027s shock of untidy brown hair. I push and pull more bodies away until she lies there in front of me, completely uncovered. Her tiny, emaciated body doesn\u0027t move. I shake her shoulder, but there\u0027s still no response. I lean down until my ear\u0027s just a fraction of an inch from her mouth, but it\u0027s impossible to hear or feel anything. I grip her wrist in my hand and check for a pulse, but there\u0027s nothing. I turn her over and pull her up and hold her in my arms. She looks like she\u0027s sleeping, and for the first time since I found her she looks like my Ellis again, like the precious little kid I used to tuck into bed at night and fetch breakfast for in the morning, the noisy little brat who made my life hell but who I loved more than anything else in the world. Bruised, blood-soaked, and beautiful.\n I check her neck for a pulse again, not even sure if I\u0027m doing it right. Did I just feel something? I pry her eyelids open. Her pupils are wide, fully dilated, but she doesn\u0027t react to the light. I hold her close, her head next to mine, and for a second I think I hear something. I concentrate on Ellis, shutting out everything else, and then I hear it again. The faintest whisper of a shallow, rasping breath. She\u0027s alive. Got to get her out of here. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-39.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dog Blood (Hater #2) \n The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
