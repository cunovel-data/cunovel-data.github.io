{"id":111995,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I COULD\u0027VE HAD ALL three of them,\" Adam says, his voice weak and frail but somehow still filled with adrenaline-fueled enthusiasm and excitement. \"I didn\u0027t need your help. I\u0027d have been perfectly fine if you hadn\u0027t come back-\" \"Sure you would,\" I interrupt. \"You\u0027re full of shit, do you know that?\" \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s full of shit.\" He laughs. \"You were the one hiding up a ladder!\" \"I wasn\u0027t hiding-\" He coughs and laughs again, showering his bare chest with speckles of blood. There\u0027s no two ways about it, he\u0027s on his way out. His breathing is increasingly shallow and uneven. He was already severely weakened by the injuries inflicted by his dad and the subsequent untreated infections, and the brutal beating he took this morning did more than enough damage to push his broken body into total submission. He\u0027s covered in bruises and swellings. He\u0027s hardly moved in hours, and his condition is continuing to steadily worsen. It\u0027s another swelteringly hot day. The air is dry, and the relentless heat makes the smell of thousands of badly decayed corpses even harder to stomach. The insect population is flourishing. It\u0027s hard to take a breath without sucking in a lungful of buzzing little fuckers. We\u0027re not heading into town until after dark, so there\u0027s nothing to do for the next few hours except try to relax and ready myself for the next fight. \"Need a drink,\" Adam gasps. I grab a half-empty plastic bottle of water and hold it up to his chapped lips. He tries to swallow, but most of it runs down his chin. He coughs again and winces with sudden pain, but he doesn\u0027t complain. Unbelievably, he\u0027s still fired up by the rush of battle. Poor bastard\u0027s completely oblivious to the fact he\u0027ll probably be dead before the morning. \"Next time,\" he says, every word an effort, \"I\u0027m gonna aim straight for the head, know what I\u0027m saying?\" I nod. I don\u0027t have the heart to tell him there\u0027s not going to be a next time. \"I know,\" I lie. \"See,\" he continues, trying to prop himself up on his elbows but immediately dropping back down again, \"they\u0027ll look at me and think that because my arm and leg are fucked, I\u0027ll be a pushover. But they\u0027ll be wrong...\" His eyelids flutter closed, and just for a second I think he\u0027s gone. I reach out to check his pulse, but he bats me away when I touch his skin and mumbles something unintelligible. He\u0027s like an animal, blissfully unaware of his own mortality, convinced he\u0027s going to go on and on and on. In a way I can\u0027t help but envy his ignorance. He fades into unconsciousness. \"He dead?\" a woman asks, her voice uncomfortably loud. I stand up and try to usher her away from Adam, but she stands her ground. Her name\u0027s Julia. She\u0027s coordinating the group of us heading out, and, from what I\u0027ve heard from some of the others, she\u0027s a hard bitch who doesn\u0027t stand for any bullshit. She has a strong Irish lilt to her voice, and I can\u0027t help thinking of the IRA and the Troubles when she speaks. It\u0027s wrong of me, but who cares. Equality, diversity, and political correctness are all things of the past now, condemned to history by the Hate-the great leveler. All the name-calling, insults, and discriminatory language we used to avoid using have lost their impact now. \"Not yet. He\u0027s still hanging on.\" She nods, her stern face devoid of any emotion. \"There\u0027s more food in the van. Make sure you eat before you leave. Don\u0027t know when you\u0027ll get the chance again.\" What with the heat, the flies, and the smell, the last thing I want is more food. \"Poor bastard,\" I say quietly. \"Just look at the state of him.\" Now that I\u0027ve taken a step back from Adam I can see just how bad his condition really is. He has open, weeping wounds all over his body, and his shattered bones haven\u0027t been properly looked at since his father first broke them. It makes me feel uneasy; this is a harsh and unforgiving world we\u0027re suddenly all living in. This man is going to die before the day is done, but none of his wounds are truly life-threatening. The medicine, the expertise, and the means to save him exist, but they\u0027re all out of reach. Julia seems to second-guess what I\u0027m thinking with uncomfortable accuracy. \"Don\u0027t bother beating yourself up about it,\" she says. \"There\u0027s no point. Face facts, he\u0027s useless to anyone like this.\" \"I know, but-\" \"But nothing. We don\u0027t have time to waste patching up people like this who aren\u0027t going to be able to fight again. It\u0027d take him months to recover, and even then he\u0027ll still be next to no good. And who\u0027s going to look after him? We don\u0027t have the people to spare. Right now there\u0027s no such thing as doctors and nurses and surgeons and the like. At the end of the day we\u0027re all fighters, and that\u0027s all there is to it.\" I feel like I should protest, that I should try to say something in defense of my fallen friend and fight in his corner, but I know there\u0027s no point. She\u0027s right. Christ, it was only this morning that I was thinking about walking out on him anyway. \"A fighter who can\u0027t fight,\" she continues, preaching at me, \"is just a corpse. If you want to do something to help him, then find yourself a gun and put a bullet in his head.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-9.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
