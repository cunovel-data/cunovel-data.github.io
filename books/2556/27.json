{"id":112011,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"THE MORNING I THOUGHT would never come is finally here. I lay on the bed for hours, but I couldn\u0027t sleep. It reminded me of being back in the apartment with Ellis, when we shut ourselves off from the others and slept on Edward\u0027s top bunk. I kept thinking about her wide, innocent eyes. Oblivious to all that was happening around her, she curled up alongside me, full of love and complete, unspoken trust. Barefoot and cold, I\u0027ve spent most of the last few hours looking out of the small window, watching the darkness turn to gray as the sun rose over the roof of this bizarre prison. I\u0027ve stood here for hours trying to work out who this Sahota might be and what he wants from me. I\u0027ve taken some reassurance from the fact that I\u0027m sure Joseph Mallon\u0027s naive trusting of me is genuine-he put his life on the line several times yesterday, and all that any of the Unchanged have left now is their lives. He\u0027s either supremely confident and brave, stupidly optimistic, or, and this seems most likely, he genuinely believes all the crap he\u0027s been peddling. So will Sahota be the same? I\u0027ve been trying to work out my tactics, deciding how I should play my showdown with Boss Man. But how can I prepare for a meeting in a place I don\u0027t know with a person I\u0027ve never met? It\u0027s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters now is getting out and looking for Ellis. The war... us and them... taking sides-all of that has to take second place from now on. I\u0027ll play along with Mallon and his hippie/pacifist/conscientious objector bullshit for as long as it takes until I get out of here. Unless, of course, they don\u0027t intend to let me out. Then I\u0027ll resort to my backup plan-my Plan B, which used to be Plan A: start fighting and don\u0027t stop until every last one of the fuckers is lying dead at my feet. The door finally opens, and Mallon strides in. About time. There\u0027s no tray of food and no small talk or niceties either this morning. It\u0027s like he\u0027s just got a job to do. Is he abandoning me and moving on to a new pet? Or is he just unable to look me in the eye because he knows what\u0027s coming next? I want to attack him, but I don\u0027t, forcing myself to swallow the Hate back down like poisonous bile. \"What\u0027s going to happen?\" I ask, instantly regretting having spoken. Christ, how far I\u0027ve fallen. It\u0027s bad enough that I\u0027m being held captive by the Unchanged; now I\u0027m begging them for information, too. Pathetic. \"I told you last night. You\u0027re going to see Sahota.\" \"Yes, but-\" Mallon stands up straight and looks at me, still on guard but allowing himself to relax slightly. He puts a hand on my shoulder, and I resist the temptation to shrug it off. \"Have faith, Danny. Sahota is a good man. The kind of man who could bring an end to this war.\" That doesn\u0027t make me feel any better. \"But who is he? What does he want to see me for?\" My questions obviously sound as desperate as I suddenly feel. Mallon manages half a smile. \"You\u0027ll find out.\" He bends down and takes the shackles off my feet. Now the only chains left are those that bind my hands together. I could kill him now, but that would be a mistake. If I\u0027m going to kill anyone this morning, it should be the main man, not one of his minions. Mallon leads me out into a wide corridor. There\u0027s no security this time, no bag over my head, and I get my first proper look at the building I\u0027m being held in. It\u0027s an odd-looking place, nothing like the prison I\u0027d imagined. The walls are bare, their light yellow paint faded and peeling, and the air is cold. There are traces of religious paraphernalia lying around like the crucifix in my room-a painting of some serene-looking woman at the top of a staircase, some unfathomable ancient slogan scrawled across another wall, enough crucifixes to ward off a whole army of vampires. We reach a T-intersection at the end of the long corridor, walking under an unrepaired hole in the roof where rainwater has poured in and soaked the carpet. To my left the corridor continues toward another long staircase. To my right there\u0027s a short, narrow landing, then three steps leading up to an ominous-looking door. Is this my Room 101? Is this the very end of my journey? All the fears and uncertainties I\u0027d managed to dismiss suddenly manifest themselves again. My pulse is racing and my throat\u0027s dry. My body tenses. I stop and turn toward Mallon. The urge to kill him is strong, almost too strong... \"Don\u0027t, Danny,\" he pleads pathetically, my intent obviously clear, \"please don\u0027t. You\u0027re so close now...\" He moves past me quickly, climbs the steps, and opens the door. He pushes it wide open, and I edge a little closer to try to look past him and see inside. It looks bizarrely like a doctor\u0027s waiting room, more like another short corridor than a room-clean, a door at either end, light flooding in through a skylight, a low table and a row of three chairs against one wall. I take a step closer, my curiosity and nerves getting the better of me. Mallon stands there, blocking my way, and it\u0027s like he\u0027s somehow taunting me. Can\u0027t stand this. This bullshit has gone on for too long. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone else in this damn building. I\u0027ll kill him, then fight my way out of here. I run at the fucker, but he sidesteps, then pushes me into the other room. I spin around as he slams the door in my face. \"Don\u0027t blow it,\" he shouts as it shuts. I hear a bolt slide across, then hear his muffled voice still talking to me. \"Keep the faith, Danny, you\u0027re almost there. Remember everything you\u0027ve learned.\" I hammer on the door, but it\u0027s no use-it\u0027s locked, and he\u0027s gone. How could I have been so fucking dumb, to walk into a simple trap like this? I\u0027ll wait for Sahota to show his face now. I\u0027m ready to fight. Bastard won\u0027t know what\u0027s hit him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-27.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: Dog Blood (Hater #2) The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
