{"id":111996,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"I\u0027M AWAY FROM THE slaughterhouse and the corpses and the flies and the stench now, and the land stretches out in front of me forever. The sun-bleached, knee-high grass shifts lazily from side to side in the warm wind like waves on a gently rolling sea. The world is suddenly absolutely beautiful, calm and almost completely silent. I feel strong and relaxed, revitalized and ready for the next fight. It\u0027ll be time to leave soon.\n I take a few steps forward, the blazing sun blinding me and burning my skin, my boots trampling down the long grass and leaving a flattened trail behind me. Considering how close to the cull site this place is, it\u0027s remarkably tranquil and clear. Ahead of me there\u0027s nothing, the land from here to the horizon barely even undulating, only a handful of distant, parched trees daring to stretch up from the yellow-green ground into the intense blue sky above.\n Wait. What was that?\n I hear something. The rustle of grass. Footsteps? I\u0027m starting to think it was just the wind when, a few yards ahead of me, a childlike figure appears, emerging from the long grass where it had been hiding. Virtually naked and desperately thin; I can\u0027t even tell from here what sex it is. It slowly stands upright, watching me intently, swaying slowly. I don\u0027t care who or what it is. I know that I have to kill it.\n I start sprinting, totally focused on catching the small figure up ahead and nothing else. He runs (I can tell from the way he moves it\u0027s a male) and makes a sudden, darting turn to the left, moving far faster than me. The gap between us increases, and I follow his trail through the flattened grass, around and around in a lazy arc until I end up back where I started. The child disappears momentarily, and as I scan the horizon I see that up ahead of me now are the ruins of my hometown. It\u0027s been weeks since I\u0027ve been here, but it\u0027s almost exactly as I remember, just a little dirtier than before. The dark, ugly buildings are in stark contrast to the beauty of everything else. There\u0027s a steady haze of smoke, wisps of white climbing up between the tallest buildings and clouds of dirty gray lying at street level like a heavy fog.\n I\u0027ve completely lost sight of the child now, but the trail of trampled grass will lead me straight to him. I start running again. The chase is getting harder now. The air is scorched and dry, and I can feel the fierce sun burning the skin on my bare back. I force myself to keep moving forward, driven on by the thought of killing again. My mouth salivates at the prospect of tearing Unchanged flesh from bone...\n A thin strip of brittle hedge marks the farthest edge of the grassland. I crash through, ignoring the spiteful branches and thorns that slash at my skin, then keep running along an empty street I don\u0027t recognize. There are buildings rising up on either side of me now, dilapidated and skeletal but still tall and imposing enough to finally block out the sun. It\u0027s hard to see anything in the sudden change from light to dark, and it\u0027s ice cold in the shadows. Disoriented, I start to slow down. The child I\u0027m chasing is long gone.\n I hear footsteps again-more than one person this time, and they\u0027re behind me. I turn around and see a huge crowd of people charging up the long straight street after me. There\u0027s enough of them to fill the entire width of the road, but their true numbers are masked by the worsening gloom. I start to run again, willing myself to keep moving faster. My energy levels are dropping now that I\u0027m the one being chased, and every step takes ten times the effort it did before. My hunger has been replaced with fear, and the crowd\u0027s getting closer. Every time I look back over my shoulder they\u0027re nearer still. There\u0027s a gap in the row of buildings to my left-leading to another even straighter, even narrower road-and I take it, my heavy boots and aching feet pounding the concrete, shock waves shooting the length of my tired frame. All my strength and energy have gone. Can\u0027t keep going...\n I stop halfway down the second street, unable to go any farther. I look back, and the crowd is still surging after me like a herd of stampeding animals, close enough that I can see their faces now. They suddenly stop, maintaining an unexpected, cautious distance. I sense they could attack at any moment, and I\u0027m scared. For the first time in months I feel genuinely afraid. I look at the people at the front of the hunting pack, and I see that they\u0027re like me, but I sense they\u0027re going to attack. Why? Do they think I\u0027m one of the Unchanged? I open my mouth to try to explain, to try to make them understand, but I can\u0027t force out even a single word. I feel crushed, devastated, and humiliated, wishing I were like them again. They look at me with total hatred...\n I turn around to run and find myself facing Ellis. In disbelief I move closer toward her. She backs away from me, matching every step forward with a single step back, then stops again when I stop.\n \"Ellis,\" I start to say, my parched voice barely audible, \"I thought you\u0027d...\"\n She throws herself at me, leaping up with lightning speed and grabbing hold of my throat. I\u0027m down before I know it, my face slammed hard into the ground... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-10.html","bookId":2556,"book":{"id":2556,"title":"Dog Blood (Hater #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dog Blood (Hater #2) \n The world has suffered a catastrophe of unknown cause, dividing humankind into two: the Haters and the Unchanged.
