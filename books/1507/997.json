{"id":53322,"no":997,"title":"Chapter 993: Upheaval in the Fang Clan!","content":"Chapter 993: Upheaval in the Fang Clan! Fang Wei\u0027s voice echoed out across the lands of Planet East Victory. He had 241 Immortal meridians, and 241 Immortal dragons swirled through the air around him, emitting roars which caused winds to surge, and the land to quake. “Fang Hao!!” Fang Wei looked up, his expression fierce and filled with madness. His body continued to grow, making him taller and more muscular. Shockingly, 24 Immortal souls towered up behind him, transforming into 24 Heavens, emitting a pressure that caused anyone who felt it to pant. Gradually, they began to resist Meng Hao’s 33 Heavens! This was something that had never occurred before, and was something no other Chosen could possibly accomplish. Only Fang Wei could succeed in contending against Meng Hao’s 33 Heavens! 33 Heavens was the limit for Immortals, and marked one as Paragon of the Realm. However, as of this moment, an intensely powerful energy rose up from Fang Wei. Meng Hao\u0027s eyes widened as the aura of the Nirvana Fruits Fang Wei possessed grew even stronger. In fact, when he closed his eyes, he could clearly sense the two Nirvana Fruits in operation in Fang Wei’s forehead. At the same time, far beneath the Fang Clan’s ancestral mansion, the Seventh Patriarch, along with the other six Patriarchs, saw Fang Wei exploding with 241 meridians. The Seventh Patriarch was clearly shocked, and deep within the Sixth Patriarch’s eyes, impossible for anyone to detect, was a glint of joy and excitement. “He’s grown up....” murmured the Sixth Patriarch, who then closed his eyes. Up above, Fang Wei’s energy surged, and 241 Immortal dragons spun through the air with him as their nucleus. Behind him, 24 Heavens caused everything to shake. Fang Wei\u0027s aura roared up. From the look of it, he was in no way ready to back down in front of Meng Hao. After all, Meng Hao only had 123 Immortal dragons, and although each one was enormous, they were outnumbered by almost double. However, when you looked at Meng Hao\u0027s 33 Immortal souls, and his 33 Heavens, he was just as glorious as before. “Fang Hao, this is my most powerful state. If I\u0027m defeated now, then I’ll return what belongs to you. As payment for using them, I’ll give you my life as well!” Fang Wei’s eyes shone with madness as he stared at Meng Hao, and yet, within that madness was a glint of obsession. Meng Hao\u0027s expression grew grave as he looked back at Fang Wei and nodded. As of this moment, Meng Hao couldn’t make himself hate Fang Wei anymore. The current situation was just the result of the outworkings of chance. “Let’s fight!!” Fang Wei roared, throwing his head back and laughing. He stepped forward, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing a river to appear in front of him! The river was yellow, and within it floated innumerable dead souls that let out vicious howls. In the blink of an eye, the river became matchlessly large. It was... the Yellow Springs! This was the quintessence of the One Thought Yellow Springs Dao, a manifestation of the Yellow Springs, as if it represented the underworld and its power. A mysterious ripple spread out from the Yellow Springs, shaking all the Heavens, and rocking the minds of the cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Even more shocking was that there wasn’t just a single manifestation of the Yellow Springs. Instead... there were 241! They materialized in front of Fang Wei, causing everything to shake and tremble. Even the sky above was tinged yellow in color. Trembling, veins popping out on his face, Fang Wei waved his hands, then pointed toward Meng Hao and roared. Rumbling filled the air as the 241 Yellow Springs shot toward Meng Hao. In the blink of an eye, they filled the entire area and seemed to be on the verge of completely overwhelming him. Meng Hao’s eyes flickered as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and waved. His Immortal meridians rumbled, causing his 123 Immortal meridians to manifest outside of him, not as Immortal dragons, but instead, as chains of mountains! Chains of Immortal mountains! 123 chains of mountains descended, each one of which caused Heaven and Earth to tremble. Meng Hao seemed to be surrounded by boundless mountains, all of which emanated Immortal might as they spread out in all directions. Meng Hao stood in the very center of all the mountains, as if he was their Lord! He faced the Yellow Springs, extending his right hand and pointing. Rumbling could be heard as all of the mountains began to rotate in the air and then shoot toward the Yellow Springs. The Yellow Springs might be mysterious, but the mountains could suppress them! Chains of mountains crushed down onto the Yellow Springs! The cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea felt their chests tightening as they watched. Rumbling rose up as the mountain chains crushed down. The Yellow Springs rose up, and the two forces slammed into each other. Each and every one of the Yellow Springs were destroyed, and all of the mountains collapsed. The scene playing out in the sky right now was like a painting. A massive, destructive explosion caused everything to shake, and even caused cracks to appear in the sky. This was no longer the power of Immortals. Not even cultivators of the Ancient Realm who had extinguished one Soul Lamp could unleash divine abilities with this level of power. The cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were completely shaken. Blood sprayed from Fang Wei’s mouth, and his expression was vicious as he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and then raised his arms above him, towards the sky. Eyes filled with madness, he roared,“Yellow Springs Dao!” As his words rang out, the shattered Yellow Springs all began to swirl back towards him. Vast amounts of yellow waters transformed into a rain which flowed towards him from all directions. Then, in the blink of an eye, the water began to reform. It turned into a majestic.... authentic Yellow Springs that caused Heaven and Earth to grow dim!! This was not the Yellow Springs of the Fourth Mountain, this was a manifestation of Fang Wei’s Immortal meridians, merged together to form his own Yellow Springs. The aura of reincarnation appeared, causing all the lands to quake, and the Heavens to grow dark. As of now, the only thing that seemed to exist... was his matchlessly majestic Yellow Springs, fully 30,000 meters long! If that were all there were to it, it might not be a big deal, but shockingly, 24 Immortal souls also appeared within the Yellow Springs. They might be Fang Wei’s Immortal souls, but as of this moment... they were Underworld Judges of the Yellow Springs! 24 Underworld Judges, each one of which had a peak Immortal Realm cultivation base. The Yellow Springs was their weapon, and as for Fang Wei... he was like their Yama King of Hell! [1. In the original Chinese, there is a slight difference in the characters Er Gen uses for the “Yama Kings” but the reference is clear, so instead of making a variation on “Yama King” I’ll just stick with the original. More information here.] “With the Dao of the Yellow Springs, I will eradicate the soul of the Immortal Realm Paragon!” Fang Wei cried madly, waving his hand out to point at Meng Hao. As of this moment, all of the cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea gasped. The crowds on Planet East Victory were astonished, and the faces of the members of the Fang Clan flickered. “Fang Wei is so incredibly powerful!!” “So that is the One Thought Yellow Springs Dao!?” “No wonder it\u0027s referred to as a signature Daoist magic! It materializes the Yellow Springs, establishes Underworld Judges, and manifests a Yama King.... Does that mean that the Fang Clan’s first generation Patriarch actually had some connection to the Fourth Mountain?” “This is a true battle of pinnacles, which I didn’t think I would be able to see because Meng Hao was just too powerful! I never thought that I would be able to bear witness to something like this!” The Ninth Mountain and Sea was shaken. Back on Planet South Heaven, Fang Xiufeng and Meng Li were getting nervous. All of Meng Hao’s friends were also starting to feel anxious. Meanwhile, out in the starry sky was the boat that no one could see. The egotistical young man from earlier was also watching the scene with wide eyes. For the first time, a sense of deadly crisis welled up inside of Meng Hao. He looked at Fang Wei, and had to admit... that he truly was a Chosen. The Yellow Springs rumbled toward Meng Hao, and the 24 Immortal soul Underworld Judges inside of it all launched attacks. Meng Hao took a deep breath. The gleam in his eyes that was the desire to do battle grew stronger, stronger than it had ever been when he had faced against the previous true Immortal Chosen. Within his right eye, a starstone appeared, which transformed into starlight that floated out above Meng Hao’s palm. In the blink of an eye, starlight had covered his entire body. “One Thought, Stellar Transformation!!” Meng Hao said. If you discounted his Demon Sealing Hexing Magics and the Paragon Bridge, One Thought Stellar Transformation was the most powerful divine ability that he could unleash! Boundless starlight covered Meng Hao, making it look like he wasn’t a cultivator any more. As the boundless light spread out, as the starstone surrounded him, he transformed into a planet! This was no ordinary planetary Daoist magic, this was formed from Meng Hao’s true Immortal secret magic, the unleashing of 123 times the power of One Thought Stellar Transformation! This planet was 3,000 meters wide, and when it appeared, all cultivators who were watching thought back to how they had seen the same magic before, when Meng Hao used it to batter open the Door of Immortality. “One Thought Stellar Transformation!!” The members of the Fang Clan were all dumbfounded. At the same time, Meng Hao in planet-form shot toward the Yellow Springs. All eyes were on him... as he made the decisive final move in the fight! The planet rumbled as it moved at top speed. Fang Wei was going all out with all of the battle prowess his cultivation base could muster, not holding back the tiniest scrap. “DIE!!” Fang Wei roared as Yellow Springs and Meng Hao in planet-form slammed into each other. A huge boom exploded out over all of Planet East Victory. The sky shattered and the ground boomed. Fang Wei let out a howl of defiance as his Yellow Springs were shattered. His Immortal souls exploded, incapable of standing up to the enormous planet. Even still, the planet began to shrink rapidly, growing weaker. In the end, though, it still completely ripped the Yellow Springs into shreds, and crushed all 24 of the Immortal souls. By the time the planet reached Fang Wei, it had shrunk down to only about 3 meters wide. It smashed into him, whereupon the cracking sound of shattering bones could be heard. Blood sprayed from Fang Wei\u0027s mouth, and he began to laugh bitterly as he rocketed down toward the ground. He slammed into a mountain peak, which immediately collapsed into rubble. Fang Wei’s bitter laughter continued to ring through the air as blood oozed out of his mouth. His chest had been crushed to a pulp, his internal organs were shattered, and his soul was crushed. His life was nearing its end. “Come on... take back what belongs to you!” said Fang Wei, using his last breath to cause his words to echo out into the air. The planet faded away, and Meng Hao appeared. As he looked down silently at Fang Wei, everyone from the Ninth Mountain and Sea also quieted down. “It’s over,” Meng Hao said, sighing. He continued to move forward, surrounded by silence. Just when he was about to reach Fang Wei, Fang Xiushan looked up, and killing intent boiled in his eyes. Suddenly, he performed a minor teleportation. His Ancient Realm cultivation base exploded out with the terrifying power of two extinguished Soul Lamps. “Fang Hao, it’s time to die!!” Fang Xiushan’s hand shot out, and everything shook. However, even as he closed in, Meng Hao’s 19th Uncle flickered to appear between the two of them. Instantly, the two of them began to fight! “Beat it!” roared Fang Xiushan, unleashing his most powerful divine ability. At the same time, Fang Wei’s grandfather was about to make a move, when the Grand Elder took a step forward and looked at him. “Don’t do anything stupid,” said the Grand Elder. He sighed. “As for Wei’er, I will--” Fang Wei’s grandfather didn\u0027t speak. Before the Grand Elder could even finish speaking, he grinned. A look of determination appeared in his eyes as he suddenly lifted the jade slip and crushed it! “That person was right. The Fang Clan needs to change a bit...” he said. “I’m only one part of the plan, responsible for the clan Elders. However, if I make a move, then everyone else... will have no choice but to act, whether they want to or not!” Fang Wei\u0027s grandfather suddenly cocked his head, and his cultivation base exploded with power! The Grand Elder gaped in surprise, and his eyes filled with disbelief and shock. That was because in the moment that Fang Wei\u0027s grandfather crushed the jade slip, vicious expressions instantly appeared on the faces of roughly forty percent of the Fang Clan’s Elders. Shockingly, they instantly began to attack their fellow clan members! The Fang Clan was facing a huge upheaval!
