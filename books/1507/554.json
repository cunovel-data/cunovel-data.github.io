This was especially true of the old-timers who had accompanied Meng Hao through the migration. Their veins burned with passion as they recalled the blood and fire they had experienced on that long road years ago. Ah, the glory of life!\\n\\n As for the new members of the Tribe who had appeared throughout the last hundred years, they too felt their blood boiling. It was almost like the stories that they had heard from the elder generation were suddenly playing out right in front of them. Except, it was all real!\\n\\n They were no longer the Five Crow Divinity Tribes that needed the protection of Meng Hao’s neo-demon horde to survive. Even the great Heavenly Pursuit Tribe needed to exert all their power to destroy them.\\n\\n Once they charged out in attack, their killing intent soaring up, and that old intrepid madness that existed deep in their bones once again exploded out.\\n\\n Tens of thousands of Golden Crow Tribe Cultivators charged directly into battle, joined by the neo-demon horde, Big Hairy, the Wild Giant, their Nascent Soul experts, and totemic Sacred Ancients. They instantly slaughtered their way into the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.\\n\\n Booming roars filled the air. It was an awe-inspiring massacre.\\n\\n Meng Hao hovered in mid air, looking down for a moment at the third black spike as it landed onto his palm. He put it away, and then looked around, his eyes glinting with a cold glow.\\n\\n The Blood Mastiff roared, and then suddenly vanished. It didn’t kill anyone, but rather, transformed into a blinding red light that spread out like a gigantic blanket to cover the entire area.\\n\\n The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe’s path of retreat was now completely sealed off!\\n\\n The only strange thing was that before the mastiff transformed into the red seal, the parrot suddenly looked at it with gleaming eyes. It stared open-mouthed at the mastiff, its body trembling. A burning excitement suddenly appeared in its eyes.\\n\\n Meanwhile, the seven Violet Sea Giants continued to crash their way across the battlefield. Reddish glows emanated out from them as, everywhere they went, Cultivators around them were exterminated. The hundreds of thousands of specters flew about, surrounded by icy coldness. Every place they visited on the battlefield, lives were extinguished.\\n\\n This was a complete and utter bloodbath!\\n\\n The members of the Golden Crow Tribe became a blade of butchery that savagely attacked with complete determination to secure revenge.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s body flickered and he suddenly reappeared next to a Nascent Soul Cultivator. It was an old woman wearing a long, emerald robe. Her face was pale with shock because of everything that had happened. Meng Hao’s sudden arrival to the battle had left her completely shaken. She looked around at the slaughter going on, and her scalp went numb. She had been just about to flee when Meng Hao appeared next to her.\\n\\n Her pupils constricted and she instantly bit down on her tongue and then spit out some blood. She slapped her bag of holding, causing ten magical items to appear in front of her. In this moment of critical danger, the old woman did not hold anything back. Along with the appearance of her magical items, all the power of her totems magically manifested, transforming into a variety of totems. At the same time, her body grew even more withered as she burned a large portion of her life force.\\n\\n Rumbling surrounded the two of them. The old woman’s face grew fierce, whereas Meng Hao’s expression was cold. He did nothing to evade her attack, but simply strode forward and lifted his right hand into the air. The Devil Spear instantly shot forward.\\n\\n The spear roared through the air, shattering the magical items, destroying the old woman’s totems. It stabbed into her forehead, passing completely through to the other side.\\n\\n The old woman’s eyes went wide and she stared blankly at Meng Hao. Suddenly, her body exploded as her weakened Nascent Soul shot away in flight. Meng Hao reached out quickly with his left hand to grab it and crush it to pieces.\\n\\n The sight of all this caused three totemic Sacred Ancients who had just been planning to launch a sneak attack, to gasp. Then they fell back in astonishment. Meng Hao turned his head, and his eyes flashed as if with electricity.\\n\\n “Lightning,” he said. Considering the massacre being carried out on the battlefield around him, it seemed at first as if Meng Hao’s voice was not loud enough. However, in response, seven enormous lightning bolts suddenly appeared out of nowhere.\\n\\n These were seven red-colored lightning bolts which were filled with the will of Heavenly Tribulation. At the same time, they also contained Meng Hao’s will. The lightning bolts shot toward the three totemic Sacred Ancients, filling the three neo-demons with astonishment. Without hesitation, they employed their various divine abilities, causing layers of multicolored lights to appear in the form of a shield. Demonic Qi also swept out.\\n\\n However… in the blink of an eye, the three neo-demons let out miserable shrieks as the red lightning smashed through all of their magic. It didn’t matter if it was divine abilities or magical techniques; all were crushed like rotten wood. The three totemic Sacred Ancients were not able to avoid the seven bolts of red lightning, and were instantly inundated.\\n\\n The sound of crashing thunder caused everything to shake. Everyone on the entire battlefield could see what was happening, and all of them gasped, faces filled with astonishment. [1. For some reason I really wanted to add a line here that said. “You could even say that they were… thunderstruck!”]\\n\\n This was especially true of the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, most especially the Nascent Soul Cultivators and the totemic Sacred Ancients. Their faces fell and were filled with terror. Some of them even began to flee the battlefield. However, as soon as they slammed into the red barrier, they screamed, and their bodies dissolved.\\n\\n This place… had long since turned into a complete dead end for them!\\n\\n The High Priest of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe was an archaic old man with the bearing of a transcendent being. He held an enormous wooden staff in his hand and wore a long, gray gown. Right now, though, he was trembling in his boots, and his eyes overflowed with despair. However, that despair quickly vanished, replaced with determination.\\n\\n “Members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, hold on just a little longer! The Patriarch will definitely come to save us!”\\n\\n As his words drifted out across the battlefield, the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe who had been so stricken with fear of Meng Hao, suddenly felt flickers of hope burning within their hearts.\\n\\n “The Patriarch is currently on his way here!” cried the Greatfather. “He will eradicate this villain and destroy his Tribe. The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe will not fall!” The Greatfather was an ancient man who wore a long violet robe and whose eyes shone with a fierce light. His Cultivation base was similar to a totemic Sacred Ancient, and he was in the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage.\\n\\n Zhang Wenzu took a deep breath. The words of the Greatfather and the High Priest caused his heart to calm a bit. His face grim, his eyes suddenly shone with derision as he looked across the battlefield toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n “The Patriarch will definitely come,” he thought. “Then what will he do? We are one of the three great Tribes of the Heavenly Court Alliance. Meng Hao hasn’t picked a fight with just the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, but the entire alliance!\\n\\n “We have three Spirit Severing Patriarchs. This guy… is definitely going to die!”\\n\\n Meng Hao’s body vanished. When he reappeared, his hand snaked out to latch around the neck of a totemic Sacred Ancient. This was a human-shaped neo-demon, which, after Meng Hao grabbed it, struggled fiercely. However, Meng Hao’s “Fire 火” character glowed faintly, causing the thing to burst into black flames that burned with an indescribable temperature, causing it to emit a blood-curdling scream. In the blink of an eye, the neo-demon was turned into nothing more than ash drifting in the wind.\\n\\n Meng Hao didn’t even look at it. Having heard the words of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe Greatfather and High Priest, his mouth twisted into a smile.\\n\\n “You’re waiting for that cretin Patriarch Huyan…?” he said, looking across the crowded battlefield at the Greatfather, who was several hundred meters away.\\n\\n The instant his gaze fell upon the violet-robed Greatfather, all the hair on the man’s body stood on end, and his heart filled with a sense of deadly crisis.\\n\\n As he looked at Meng Hao, his mind trembled and filled with an ominous sense of foreboding. His action of looking over at Meng Hao was actually completely subconscious, but as soon as their gazes locked, the Heavenly Pursuit Greatfather’s brain filled with an intense pain. It was as if Meng Hao’s eyes were sharp knives that stabbed through his eyes into his brain, preparing to eradicate him.\\n\\n Blood began to ooze out of the Greatfather’s eyes, ears, nose and mouth. He started backing up, his eyes widening.\\n\\n Meng Hao took a step forward and said, “I have no idea whether or not that patsy Huyan will be coming. But you won’t be here to find out, of that I’m certain.”\\n\\n “Protect the Greatfather!” cried the surrounding Tribe members. Alarmed, they formed a protective circle around the Greatfather. Many of the group were Nascent Soul Cultivators and totemic Sacred Ancients.\\n\\n Meng Hao smiled as he moved forward toward the Greatfather.\\n\\n His path was one of explosions and annihilation. No one who stood in his way was able to impede him for even a moment. His finger reached out to tap on the forehead of a Nascent Soul Cultivator. Blood poured from the man’s mouth and he was sent tumbling backward. By the time he exploded, Meng Hao had already moved more than three hundred meters. He flicked his sleeve, and the character “Wind 风” appeared, transforming into a screaming wind that instantly became a cyclone. It raged out around Meng Hao, slamming into seven or eight nearby Nascent Soul Cultivators and totemic Sacred Ancients. Blood sprayed from their mouths and they were sent flying back.\\n\\n There was not a single person on the battlefield who could do anything to stop Meng Hao. He proceeded forward another three hundred meters. He gestured off into the distance, and immediately, a frosty soil 土 appeared. It spread out rapidly toward the nearby Cultivators. Booming sounds could be heard as their bodies quivered and then completely froze!\\n\\n Meng Hao moved a third time, another three hundred meters. By this time, he was directly in front of the rapidly retreating Greatfather. Even as the people surrounding him instantly charged in attack, the blank look on the Greatfather’s face was replaced with despair. Meng Hao lifted his hand up and pushed forward.\\n\\n “Metal 金!”\\n\\n In response to this single word, a golden light exploded up around Meng Hao’s right hand. The glow of it filled the battlefield, and, in the blink of an eye, the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe Greatfather was completely transformed into a statue of gold.\\n\\n A bang rang out as the statue slammed into the ground below, where it came to rest, unmoving. The look of despair was still clear on the man’s face…. The sight of it caused all of the remaining Heavenly Pursuit Tribe members to gape. Their bodies trembled and were filled with icy coldness.\\n\\n The Golden Crow Tribe members, on the other hand, were growing even more excited.\\n\\n “Sacred Ancient!!”\\n\\n “Sacred Ancient!!”\\n\\n Their roars echoed out in all directions, filled with anger and indignation, as well as their determination to eradicate the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.\\n\\n You want to wipe out our Tribe? Allow us to wipe out YOURS!\\n\\n Such enmity could not be reconciled. It was simply impossible to do so. The only option was for the bloodlines of one of these Tribes to be completely removed from the lands of South Heaven!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-551","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
