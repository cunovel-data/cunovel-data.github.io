{"id":53434,"no":1109,"title":"Chapter 1105: What Did You Just Say?!","content":"Chapter 1105: What Did You Just Say?! The shattering of the sky grew even more apparent. Cracks rapidly formed and closed up, leaving behind what looked like scars. There didn\u0027t seem to be anything out of the ordinary about Meng Hao, and yet, he had suddenly become a larger-than-life figure, like a giant who stood on equal footing with the Heavens. A terrifying aura rose up from him as he took his sixth step, and unleashed the sixth punch! It was the Bedevilment Fist yet again, the strike of Self-Immolation. However, this strike was delivered even more directly than before, and the domineering power of Meng Hao’s energy seemed to fuse with Heaven and Earth. When the strike landed, Lin Cong let out a miserable scream. He bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood, which transformed into majestic Yellow Springs that swept out in all directions. Massive booms could be heard as the Yellow Springs were destroyed. Meng Hao was slightly injured, and yet, the killing intent in his eyes had not lessened. “Last step!” he said, taking the seventh step in unison with the destruction of the Yellow Springs. It was as if the entire world ground to a halt, and was replaced by Meng Hao. With the assistance of twenty percent of the qi flow of the Windswept Realm, Meng Hao could fuse with the lands, as if... he were the embodiment of the will of Heaven! The entire world began to burst; Meng Hao was like a divine spirit that represented the will of Heaven, becoming its embodiment as he fused with Heaven and Earth! His foot landed, and it was as if the Heavens were crushing the lands beneath. His fist was like Heaven and Earth, destroying all living things. It was as if Meng Hao were the most respected entity in all creation. That was because this was... The God-Slaying Fist! When the God-Slaying Fist was unleashed, the Echelon cultivators in the other nations watching the battle let out successive gasps. They had watched Meng Hao’s terrifying momentum grow with each step, had seen the wild and Devilish energy building up, had witnessed his intensely domineering style. It instantly left a deep impression on everyone, and caused them to tremble in astonishment. The Echelon cultivator from the First Mountain, the white-robed youth, felt his eyes going wide as an expression of shock filled his face. Meng Hao’s way of fighting left even him astonished. Meng Hao seized the initiative and pressed forward, crushing everything in front of him like dead weeds. All of the Echelon cultivators were completely astonished by this fist strike. “What fist strike is that?!” “It might not be impossible... for him to actually kill Lin Cong with only seven steps!!” “This Meng Hao is actually incredibly strong! Han Qinglei couldn\u0027t match up to him, and it looks like Lin Cong is also going to be defeated.... He might be qualified to fight for the spot of the number one most powerful cultivator in the Echelon!!” At this point, Lin Cong performed a double-handed incantation gesture, then shoved his hands out in front of him. “Holy Requiem Skull!!” he roared. Shockingly, a Paragon magic appeared, an enormous, golden skull! The surface of the skull was covered with innumerable magical symbols, tightly packed in a way that seemed to encompass a will of death that mourned for all living things. The Holy Requiem Skull was Lin Cong’s Paragon magic. By gaining enlightenment of this skull, he was able to craft a Paragon magic, and thus enter Paragon Sea Dream’s Echelon! Becoming part of the Echelon completely changed his destiny, allowing him to rise to prominence in the Fourth Mountain. With the secret support of Ksitigarbha, he had survived numerous deadly trials, and had defended his place in the Echelon. All of those numerous battles gave him complete and utter control over his Paragon magic, a power which enabled him to peer ahead into the future of the battle! He was able to find the weaknesses in all other Daoist magics, he was also able to predict what actions his opponents would take. He would then use all of that information to his advantage. Even more shocking to his opponents was that he could see visions of their future. Because of that, and thanks to the tips and pointers given him by Ksitigarbha, the path of Immortality that he treaded was essentially the same as that of Ksitigarbha! It was a unique path of Immortality that was like striding out from death into a new life! However, his Paragon magic required a significant expenditure of mental energy, and therefore, he rarely used it. However, having been forced into a corner by Meng Hao\u0027s domineering style, he was left with no choice but to utilize this most powerful Paragon magic. However, as soon as he unleashed his Holy Requiem Skull Paragon magic, Lin Cong\u0027s face completely fell. The only thing he saw in his vision was that there was no way for him to escape from the power of Meng Hao’s fist strike. There were no gaps! There was no way to escape! He was even able to determine that after Meng Hao’s strike landed, he didn\u0027t plan to follow up with any divine abilities or magical techniques. It was as if... Meng Hao was completely and utterly confident that this fist and this step would utterly eradicate Lin Cong! “How could this be!?” he thought, shaking mentally. He tried to back up, but Meng Hao\u0027s killing intent exploded out, as if the God-Slaying Fist were capable of eradicating all living things in Heaven and Earth! It would land on Lin Cong, and there was nothing he could do about it! Tears of blood seeped out of Lin Cong’s eyes. After madly depleting his mental energy to use his Paragon magic at this critical juncture, he was able to glimpse a bit of the future. The only result of that flashing vision was that Lin Cong’s face fell. He had no time to think. Eyes bloodshot, he viciously sent the gold-colored Holy Requiem Skull rumbling forward to try to block Meng Hao’s incoming fist strike. Meng Hao hadn’t lost even a bit of momentum. He was backed by the will of Heaven and Earth, so no matter what tried to block his path, it would be brushed aside with ease. There was nothing that could stand in the way of his surging energy. That was because Meng Hao’s God-Slaying Fist was backed by the qi flow of the Windswept Realm, utilizing the will of Heaven to take it to the absolute peak! Anything and everything would be reduced to rubble in the face of this fist! RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE! Meng Hao’s God-Slaying Fist slammed into the golden skull, causing massive rumbling to echo out. The skull trembled and then exploded into pieces, allowing Meng Hao’s fist to slam into Lin Cong’s chest. Cracking sounds could be heard, and Lin Cong let out a bloodcurdling scream. His body hurled backward like a kite with its string cut. All the bones in his body shattered, and in the blink of an eye, he exploded. His chest erupted in a fountain of blood, which spread out in all directions until his entire body was destroyed, with the exception of his head! By now, all spectators in the Windswept Realm were completely and utterly shocked, filled with pounding waves of astonishment. To witness something happening that moments ago had seemed impossible, led to unparalleled stupefaction. In the First Nation, the Echelon cultivator from the First Mountain, the white-robed young man, had been sitting there cross-legged moments ago. Now, he was standing, staring at the screen along with all of his followers, whose faces were covered with complete disbelief. They all knew Lin Cong, and because of that, the scene which was playing out in front of them was completely astounding. “He... he actually did it!!” the followers gasped. The Echelon cultivator from the First Mountain looked at the screen and then suddenly smiled, although it was a smile of complete coldness. His eyes flickered with a bright light as he said, “This guy does qualify to fight me.” In the Second Nation, on the National Aura Mountain, everything was freezing cold. Countless snowflakes swirled around a man who sat there on the mountain peak. He wore a blue robe, and he was the Echelon cultivator from the Second Mountain. His features were cold, but his eyes narrowed as he watched the ice screen in front of him, and the image of Meng Hao upon it. He seemed calm on the outside, but inwardly, he was rocked by waves of shock. In the Third Nation, a strange scene was playing out. One hundred cultivators sat cross-legged on the National Aura Mountain. At their head was a middle-aged man wearing an Imperial robe. His face was extremely dark and sinister. “Is this Meng Hao a variable thrown in by the Windswept Imperial Lord...?” The pudgy Echelon cultivator in the Fifth Nation, the young boy in the Sixth Nation, and the murderous youth in the Seventh Nation, all watched with flickering faces and trembling hearts. Earlier, they didn\u0027t think that Meng Hao could kill Lin Cong with a handful of steps, but now they had personally witnessed the battle, and seen Meng Hao\u0027s power and domineering style. It instantly turned into a massive pressure weighing down on them. Now, not a one of them dared to underestimate Meng Hao. Although they coveted his two World Seals, as of now, they were forced to weigh the risks associated with trying to take them. You could say that Meng Hao\u0027s battle just now had completely cowed the Echelon cultivators in the Windswept Realm. At the same time that all the Echelon cultivators were shaken by Meng Hao, Lin Cong’s body exploded in the air above the Eighth Nation. Just when his head seemed on the verge of exploding, killing him in body and spirit, golden light suddenly began to shine up from the shattered golden skull. It transformed into a golden vortex which surrounded Lin Cong’s head, as if to teleport him away. There was still a bit of life force left in Lin Cong’s head, thanks to his special way of practicing cultivation. As long as he still had his head, he could recover, although it came with a heavy price, including a drop in cultivation base. In the moment that he was about to teleport away, Meng Hao’s energy suddenly rose up even higher than before, and he said, “Think you can just leave? Exterminate!” The words were spoken softly, but in that moment, an enormous, shocking foot appeared! The foot seemed to obfuscate the entire sky, and when it appeared, it began to crush down onto Lin Cong, shattering natural law, destroying Essence! This was the ultimate power of the Seven God Steps! The previous seven steps were just a buildup of momentum and energy, leading up to this explosive, exterminating attack. An intense sensation of deadly crisis filled Lin Cong. He had experienced such feelings before in his life, but this was the most intense it had ever been. Even his battle with the Echelon cultivator from the First Mountain hadn\u0027t been so terrifying and shocking. There was no possible way he could have ever imagined that Meng Hao... would be so powerful!! When he saw the foot descending, he realized he didn\u0027t have time to complete the teleportation. He knew that he was about to die, so he let out a powerful howl that echoed out in all directions. “Meng Hao, if I die, Xu Qing dies too!” Those words entered Meng Hao’s ears like the crash of zillions of thunderclaps. His entire body began to shake. [1. Lin Cong talked to Xu Qing in chapter 1058] “What did you just say!?” His heart began to pound in a way it rarely did, even causing his divine ability to become unstable. The enormous foot in the sky trembled, and because of his mental instability, his momentum faltered, and his energy began to wane. Upon leaving Planet South Heaven, he had asked his father about Xu Qing. Fang Xiufeng had told him that he left some divine will on Xu Qing to protect her during reincarnation. Finding out her final destination when she was actually reincarnated was a matter of fortune and timing, but Fang Xiufeng had assured him that he didn’t need to worry. Even still, and even after so many years had passed, Meng Hao still worried about it occasionally. His original plan had been to wait until he left the Nine Seas God World, and then go back to Planet South Heaven to find out more about the situation. After all, she was his wife, his beloved partner. Although he didn’t often think about the matter, to hear Lin Cong say what he just did filled Meng Hao\u0027s mind with crashing waves of shock.
