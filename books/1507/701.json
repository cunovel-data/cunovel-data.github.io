The crowds of Cultivators from the Black Sieve Sect were sending all sorts of divine abilities and magical techniques against him, as well as magical items. Even with his incredible fleshly body, it was something he couldn’t stand up against for long.\n The flag of three streamers was in full retreat, and even the Resurrection Lily was falling back. The Black Sieve Sect disciples had gone mad. There was not a single one who could watch the Hundred Thousand Mountains, the very foundation of their sect, being pulled up by the roots, and not go mad.\n “No time to wait for all 100,000,” thought Meng Hao. “50,000 will do!” With that, he suddenly stretched his right arm out and pointed up to the sky. The 50,000 mountains began to rumble, and then descended with shocking speed.\n They shot directly toward the spell formation made up of the hundreds of thousands of Black Sieve Sect cultivators, then began to slam into it. Miserable shrieks filled the air one after another. Meng Hao’s eyes suddenly flickered with burning madness.\n “Explode!” he said. It was only a single word.\n That one word caused everything to shake. One by one, 50,000 mountains exploded. They sky ripped and the land quaked. Even the Ninety-Nine Mountains were severely affected, and began to crumble.\n Blood sprayed from the mouths of hundreds of thousands of cultivators as the spell formation collapsed into pieces. At least half of the people who made up the formation let out bloodcurdling screams as they were destroyed in body and spirit.\n “NOOO!!” roared the Second Severing Patriarch. He unleashed a divine ability, causing a gigantic Xuanwu turtle with a viciously spiked shell to appear. As it shot toward forward, Meng Hao waved a finger, causing portions from five enormous, crumbling mountains to crush down toward the old man. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he was sent tumbling backward. At the same time, Meng Hao pushed his hands down toward the ground another time, causing the ground within the Black Sieve Sect to split open.\n Spiritual energy surged out, mountain peaks crumbled, the sky dimmed. Meng Hao strode forward toward the First Mountain.\n However, even as he stepped foot onto it, the air in front of him rippled, and the Black Sieve Sect’s Third Severing Patriarch stepped out.\n A ferocious expression could be seen on his face, as well as surging hatred. The moment he appeared, he waved his sleeve. Shockingly, nine white tigers appeared, each of them fully thirty meters long.\n Behind the white tigers, the Third Severing Patriarch let out a roar and then raised his hand up. A seal mark appeared from within, which rapidly increased in size as it shot toward Meng Hao.\n Off in the distance, the Second Severing Patriarch gritted his teeth because of the injuries he had sustained, but approached nonetheless. His hand flashed in an incantation gesture, causing black mist to swirl around him and then turn into a statue of a Xuanwu turtle. It emitted a mysterious glow, and also emanated the sounds of wailing, which shook everything in the area.\n Meng Hao’s eyes flickered, and he slapped his bag of holding. Immediately, the only Time Sword tip he still possessed appeared. He grabbed it with his fingers and then suddenly vanished. When he reappeared he was directly in front of the Second Severing Patriarch. He waved his hand, and the sword tip flew out.\n When it slammed into the Xuanwu turtle, the beast instantly began to wither. It let out a miserable shriek and then began to collapse and dissipate. The Second Severing Patriarch’s face fell as the sword tip neared him. He was just about to attempt to dodge to the side when Meng Hao stretched out his finger.\n “Hex!”\n It was a single word, but it instantly caused the Second Severing Patriarch to tremble to a stop. The sword tip stabbed through him, causing not only blood to spurt out, but also 10,000 years of longevity!\n “AAHHH!!”\n Physical pain didn’t count for much, but the pain caused by the destruction of longevity cause the old man to let out a miserable shriek. By this point, Meng Hao had already turned around. He flicked his sleeve, and a gale-force wind sprang up to send the nine white tigers sprawling backward. Then he looked up at the sealing mark that was bearing down on him. By now, it was already three hundred meters tall, and causing everything to rumble as it neared.\n “Suppress!!” roared the Third Severing Patriarch, gesturing with both hands, sending the seal mark smashing down toward Meng Hao.\n “Anywhere that mountains exist, that is my Area world!” said Meng Hao. He performed an incantation with his right hand and then pointed out. Shockingly 50,000 illusory mountain suddenly appeared around him. These were the 50,000 mountains that he had just destroyed!\n As the mountains made their appearance, they turned into Meng Hao’s Area world. It spread out toward the incoming seal, causing rumbling to fill the air. It also shot toward the Second Severing Patriarch, who was already injured. This new attack caused him to let out a scream of defiance as his body trembled and then exploded. He was dead in body and soul.\n At the same time, Meng Hao borrowed the momentum of the blast to shoot at high speed past the Third Severing Patriarch. In the blink of an eye, he was on the First Mountain, next to the incense burner.\n Without the slightest hesitation, he anxiously approached and reached out his right hand. Just as he was about to lay hands on the trembling figure inside, an enraged roar echoed out behind him.\n The roar spread out, and it contained something that caused Meng Hao’s scalp to go numb with a sense of crisis.\n “You want to save that girl? I’d rather let the Rebirth Pill refinement fail than let you succeed! Heaven and Earth furnace, shatter the pill and destroy the body!”\n The instant the voice rang out, the incense burner trembled and began to emit intense heat.\n “If you fall back, your beloved in the furnace will be killed. If you don’t fall back, then you will die together!”\n Meng Hao’s face flickered as he eyed the leaping flames in the incense burner. Critical danger was also approaching him from behind. His eyes flickered with determination. Without hesitation, he stopped in place. He did not fall back.\n His two hands flickered in incantation pattern and, ignoring both the danger from behind and the blistering heat from incense burner, he shot forward. He entered the incense burner and wrapped his arms around the stiff figure inside.\n His body was instantly attacked by the intense heat. His hair burned, and the flesh of his face was charred black. His fingers dried and withered, revealing bones. Even his chest was eaten away until his heart was visible.\n However, he still entered the incense burner to wrap his arms around Xu Qing. In that instant, a tremor ran through him as the danger from behind finally arrived.\n Whhhzzzzzzzzzzz….\n Meng Hao trembled as the eight white tigers, which had transformed into eight white spikes, stabbed into his back.\n Actually, as far as physical pain went, he didn’t even notice it. Currently, he was staring blankly at Xu Qing as he held her in his arms. She was not beautiful like he remembered. Her body was emaciated and withered, her features ancient. She had no life force in her, no soul.\n She had… nothing.\n Meng Hao quivered, and his eyes filled with tears.\n “Elder Sister Xu….” Stabs of pain filled his heart, as if it were being ripped directly out of his body. He instantly fell completely into his madness. At this same time, the voice of the Third Severing Patriarch rang out behind him.\n “Eight Tigers Immortal Extinguishing Tribulation!!”\n In coordination with the words, the eight spikes that had stabbed into Meng Hao began to emanate an indescribably terrifying power. It instantly filled every corner and recess of his body.\n Meng Hao’s eyes were crimson as he looked at Xu Qing. He laughed bitterly, doing nothing to prevent the Third Severing Patriarch from approaching and attacking with a divine ability.\n Blood sprayed from his mouth, only to be instantly incinerated.\n “First Tribulation!” said the Third Severing Patriarch. Booming filled Meng Hao’s body.\n “Second Tribulation!\n “Third Tribulation!”\n Booming rang out constantly as, one by one, the eight spikes inside of Meng Hao shattered. They battered his soul and shredded his body, but he didn’t care. The only thing he cared about was the corpse of the woman he held in his embrace.\n He felt hatred, madness, insanity, and regret.\n He had arrived too late….\n “You live, I live. You die, I die….\n “If you grow old, then I’ll grow old together with you….” Meng Hao heard the words from the past echoing in his ears. He laughed bitterly as the explosions wracked his body.\n “Fifth Tribulation!\n “Sixth Tribulation!\n “Seventh Tribulation!\n Suddenly, an intense hope filled Meng Hao’s face. He began to breathe raggedly, and even as the words ‘Eighth Tribulation’ rang out behind him, he realized that there was a problem.\n “Xu Qing’s soul…. Her soul is not in her body any more. Her soul….\n “Bodies can be restored. As long as her soul has not dispersed, she isn’t dead. However, there are no traces at all of a soul within her. It’s almost like… someone extracted it!” Meng Hao’s entire body trembled, and roaring sounds filled his whole body. He slowly put Xu Qing’s corpse into his bag of holding. As he did, his Eternal stratum, seemingly in unison with his sudden lucidity, exploded out along with the Eighth Tribulation.\n It was at that point that roaring flames suddenly burst out all over Meng Hao’s body. The more than 100,000 remaining Black Sieve Sect disciples saw this, as did the Third Severing Patriarch.\n They saw flames, and inside of the flames, a person. Everything else above and below faded, and the Black Sieve Sect disciples’ faces filled with excitement.\n The Third Severing Patriarch finally breathed a sigh of relief. The menace of Meng Hao was something he couldn’t quite handle, and he had even been worried that, because of Xu Qing, he wouldn’t be able to kill him.\n “Finally, the matter is ended….” murmured the Third Severing Patriarch. And yet, even as the words left his mouth, his face suddenly flickered and filled with shock. Without hesitation, he shot backward.\n Even as he fell into retreat, Meng Hao strode out from within the raging flames, which were then immediately extinguished. Meng Hao was eternal, and what is eternal cannot be exterminated!\n The only way to kill him was to simultaneously exterminate him in both body and soul. Using any other method would be very difficult.\n As for the Third Severing Patriarch, he was obviously not qualified to do something like that!\n Even as the man began to retreat, Meng Hao’s killing intent exploded out in shocking fashion.\n “Where is Xu Qing’s soul!?” he said, glaring directly at the Third Severing Patriarch. He spoke slowly, and his eyes were thoroughly bloodshot. His voice was filled with the thirst for blood and slaughter, and anyone who heard it would feel an incredible sense of danger.\n The more than 100,000 surrounding Black Sieve Sect disciples were trembling. By this point, there were a few who finally realized why Meng Hao looked so familiar. Before, they had sensed the familiarity, but didn’t have time to think deeply about the matter. Now, though, they suddenly thought of a name from the past.\n “Meng Hao!!”\n -----\n This chapter was sponsored by Alex Tsue\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-698","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
