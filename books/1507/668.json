{"id":52993,"no":668,"title":"Chapter 665: The Dawn Immortal Once Again","content":"Meng Hao gave a cold snort as he looked at the young man and how he caused the air in the area to seemingly collapse under the pressure of a gesture. Meng Hao was just about to make a move when he stopped. He stood there in the war chariot, motionless.\\n\\n He allowed the thunderous roaring to descend upon him, but then, even as it neared, the war chariot automatically emitted a yellow ring of light. The ring expanded out and then slammed into the collapsing air.\\n\\n A boom rattled out, followed by cracking sounds. Everywhere the yellow ring of light passed was left completely calm and tranquil.\\n\\n A red glow appeared in the eyes of the man on the crocodile. He then leaped into the air and shot toward Meng Hao, followed by the crocodile, who opened its gaping mouth as it ferociously charged out of the water.\\n\\n The man closed in, and he didn’t perform an incantation, but instead reached his hand out in a claw-like gesture. Instantly, his fingers all turned pitch black and began to emanate a black fog. The black fog from his five fingers swirled and twisted, transforming into a vicious flood dragon that then charged toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n A boom echoed out as the flood dragon slammed into the expanding yellow ring of light, and was deflected away. The snapping crocodile also hit the yellow ring, whereupon it let out a bloodcurdling scream as its teeth were shattered. It then retreated at top speed.\\n\\n Meng Hao gave a faint smile. As for his opponent, he retreated backward a bit, a look of anxiety and doubt on his face as he stared fixedly at Meng Hao.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s smile turned wide and splendid. As of now, he realized that the war chariot truly was a precious treasure. As long as he was inside it, it would activate defense powers even if he didn’t imbue it with Immortal Qi.\\n\\n “There is neither any enmity nor hatred between us,” said Meng Hao. “Why engage in magical combat? I came here by accident, so I’ll take my leave now.” With that, he placed his hand onto the war chariot and then circulated Immortal Shows the Way, and was about to send the war chariot speeding away.\\n\\n Suddenly, though, the expression of man in the dilapidated clothing grew even more vicious. He lifted his head up and let out an ear-piercing shout. At the same time, his body began to distort and expand. In the blink of an eye, his skin was replaced by black scales. At the same time, his shape began to change, until he didn’t look like a person, but rather… a black flood dragon!\\n\\n His body flickered again, and he was now over three hundred meters long. His eyes radiated savagery and avarice as he stared at Meng Hao there in the war chariot.\\n\\n “You will stay,” said the flood dragon. As it spoke the language of humans, black flames accompanied the words. “Consuming you will help improve my Cultivation base. As for that treasure of yours… that also will stay behind.”\\n\\n The black flames spit out by the flood dragon emanated a green glow along with a rotten stench that seemed to indicate they were imbued with poisons. They shot toward Meng Hao at top speed.\\n\\n A sea of flames surrounded him, emanating intense heat and power that caused everything to ripple and distort. Waves undulated on the surface of the sea below, as if it couldn’t bear the level of heat. The crocodile had long since retreated off into the distance; it floated there in the water, staring at Meng Hao.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s face darkened as he looked coldly at the flood dragon on the other side of the black flames. He lifted up the hand that he had placed onto the war chariot, and ceased to rotate Immortal Shows the Way.\\n\\n “I thought you were a Cultivator, but it turns out you’re a Sea Demon,” said Meng Hao calmly. “Since you’re looking to die, I guess I’ll help you fulfill your wish.” Meng Hao’s personality was fully on display; the calmer he was, the greater his desire to kill.\\n\\n Even as he spoke, Meng Hao started to move forward. He stepped out of the war chariot and entered into the black sea of flames. Seeing that he dared to emerge left the flood dragon astonished, and he immediately began to back up.\\n\\n “I can be crafty too!” said Meng Hao. He waved his hand, and another sea of flames sprang up. These flames were red, and sprang up high into the sky around Meng Hao. As soon as the red flames touched the black flames, an intense rumbling sound could be heard. At the same time, Meng Hao emerged on the outside.\\n\\n The flood dragon’s face fell, and he continued to move backward in retreat. However, before he could get very far, Meng Hao turned into a green smoke. As for the flood dragon, his heart was pounding in his ears. The fact that Meng Hao dared to emerge from the war chariot was obviously not a good thing. Even as he retreated, Meng Hao suddenly appeared behind him.\\n\\n A hand raised up, and a fist descended.\\n\\n The fist seemingly landed on nothing but air. However, a huge rumbling could be heard, and the flood dragon felt as if a mountain were crushing down onto him. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face. He let out a miserable shriek.\\n\\n At the same time, the crocodile opened its mouth wide and charged, ignoring any danger whatsoever as it shot toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n “Trifling First Severing Cultivation base,” said Meng Hao. “You’re not the first one I’ve killed like that.” Not even deigning to look at the crocodile, he punched backward.\\n\\n BAM!\\n\\n A tremor ran through the crocodile and then, starting from its head, it began to shatter. In the blink of an eye, the shattering spread out through its entire body. A final bang could be heard as it exploded into bloody pieces.\\n\\n A fist-sized black Demon heart transformed into a black beam of light that flew into Meng Hao’s hand. He put it into his bag of holding and then looked at the flood dragon. The flood dragon’s trembling increased in intensity.\\n\\n He took a deep breath, and then turned around. Clouds suddenly circulated beneath him, a divine ability which would enable him to shoot down into the waters below.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s right hand flickered in an incarnation gesture, and he pointed out.\\n\\n “Demon Sealing, Eighth Hex!”\\n\\n Demonic Qi appeared, transforming into numerous invisible, thin strands that wrapped around the flood dragon. It instantly stopped moving, which left the flood dragon scared witless. Even as he struggled, Meng Hao waved his right hand, causing ten Wooden Time Swords to fly out one after another and then pierce through the flood dragon.\\n\\n A bloodcurdling shriek echoed about as the flood dragon began to rapidly wither. His expression was one of intense fear as he could feel his life force rapidly disappearing.\\n\\n Feeling death approaching, he suddenly shook and then spit a pearl out of his mouth. The pearl was about the size of a fist, and was not black, but completely and utterly white.\\n\\n As soon as the pearl appeared, it emanated a soft glow, along with a thick, fragrant aroma. The spiritual energy in the area even grew stronger. A powerful shockwave spread out, causing rumbling booms as the dragon shook free of the binding strands, forced back the wooden swords, and then shot down toward the sea, carrying the pearl with it.\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, he splashed into the water and then disappeared.\\n\\n A strange light appeared in Meng Hao’s eyes. He looked at the white pearl, and the first thought that ran through his mind was that he was sure he could sell the thing for an exorbitant price.\\n\\n As soon as the thought entered his mind, the last trace of his hesitation disappeared as he flashed through the air, circulating Immortal Shows the Way as he stepped foot onto the war chariot. His hand touched the chariot, and it instantly began to vibrate and shoot down toward the sea.\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, he was underwater. Everything around was pitch black, but it only took a moment for Meng Hao to catch sight of the vicious flood dragon up ahead, feeling quite confident that he had just escaped disaster.\\n\\n Even as the flood dragon felt as if he had managed to scrape out and extra life, he suddenly heard a rumbling sound. He turned, and his eyes went wide and filled with shock when he saw the thirty meter war chariot!\\n\\n It wanted to dodge out of the way, but was too slow!\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n The war chariot directly struck the flood dragon, causing it to let out a miserable howl. Then, its body began to break apart into pieces. It exploded, and the white pearl flew out. Shockingly, inside the pearl could be seen a miniature flood dragon, its face covered with terror and astonishment.\\n\\n The pearl and the miniature flood dragon shot off at high speed, but no matter how fast they could go, it was too slow compared to Meng Hao’s war chariot.\\n\\n Meng Hao instantly shot in pursuit. Inside the white pearl, the flood dragon’s face was unyielding and filled with madness. It then let out a miserable cry that it amplified with Divine Will.\\n\\n “Dawn Immortal, save me!!”\\n\\n When Meng Hao heard the name ‘Dawn Immortal,’ his mind instantly trembled. It was a name he would never forget. However, this was not the time and place to think about it in detail. His eyes glittered, and he pushed the war chariot in pursuit. His hand stretched out and he grabbed the white pearl.\\n\\n The struggling of the flood dragon made no difference. Meng Hao sealed the pearl and then quickly put it into his bag of holding.\\n\\n However, in that instant… a faint sigh could suddenly echoed about in the darkness of the seafloor.\\n\\n It was a single sigh, but it instantly caused Meng Hao’s scalp to go numb. Cold sweat broke out all over his body, and his face fell. Suddenly, the Resurrection Lily inside of him seemed to go mad.\\n\\n It seemed as if, regardless of anything, it wanted to reveal itself and let out a cry to be noticed by whomever had just made the sigh.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s mind trembled, and he instantly caused the war chariot to begin moving. He began to build up the Immortal Qi, and was just about to speed away when a tentacle suddenly shot toward him from within the deep sea.\\n\\n Immediately, an intense feeling of crisis rumbled through Meng Hao. At the same time, the struggling of the Resurrection Lily reached a peak.\\n\\n BOOM!\\n\\n Meng Hao released the entirety of his Immortal Qi, causing it to enter the war chariot. It rumbled, and then shot at incredible speed up and out of the water, transforming into a beam of light that quickly disappeared. Almost simultaneously, a gigantic tentacle erupted from the surface of the sea.\\n\\n As he shot away, Meng Hao had just enough time to glance back at the enormous tentacle before the world turned blurry.\\n\\n What he saw caused Meng Hao’s mind to quiver and tremble with confusion.\\n\\n “What… what is that…?” His face was pale white, and his expression one of disbelief. Given his Cultivation base, his experiences, his level of focus, in the Milky Way Sea, only the ancient Underworld Ship could cause his expression to change in such a way.\\n\\n However, there was now something else!\\n\\n In fact, because of his own condition, what he saw caused him to be even more astonished than the ancient Underworld Ship.\\n\\n “That’s… the Dawn Immortal?”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-665","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
