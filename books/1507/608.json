You overestimate yourself!” despite his words, Patriarch Huyan was actually inwardly shocked. His face was grimmer than ever as he retreated. Then his Cultivation base exploded with full power as he prepared to unleash a divine ability.\\n\\n “Overestimate myself? Fine, I’ll show you what it’s like when I overestimate myself!” His voice calm, Meng Hao said, “Fourth Anima!”\\n\\n A rumbling sound could be heard from his body as he entered the Fourth Anima. His Cultivation base was that of eight great circle Nascent Souls. As for his fleshly body, it had a terrifying power that exceeded that of his original Seventh Anima.\\n\\n As Meng Hao charged in attack, ghost images sprang up around him. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Patriarch Huyan. He waved his right index finger, causing it to stab onto Patriarch Huyan’s upraised right hand. His left hand reached out to push into Patriarch Huyan’s chest.\\n\\n A boom could be heard. Patriarch Huyan fell backward head over heels, blood overflowing from his mouth. His expression was one of astonishment and complete disbelief. What he feared was not Meng Hao’s Cultivation base, but the power of his fleshly body.\\n\\n Such a frightening fleshly body was something that vastly exceeded his imagination, and was something he had never even heard of before!\\n\\n Even as the power of the finger attack caused Patriarch Huyan to tumble back, Meng Hao strode forward again.\\n\\n “Fifth Anima!”\\n\\n He now had a Cultivation base equivalent to sixteen great Nascent Souls, and an even more shockingly powerful fleshly body. He was surrounded by a rumbling roar, and although there were no physical changes to his appearance, distortions and ripples appeared in the air around him.\\n\\n This was a fleshly body that could cause anyone to be completely shocked. Combined with his Cultivation base, it made it so that Meng Hao’s steps could shatter the air. He appeared again in front of Patriarch Huyan, lifting his right hand up to make a fifth finger attack.\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan raised his head up and howled as a sense of grave crisis swept over him. He bit violently down onto his tongue, causing blood to spray out of his mouth and then transform into magical symbols that spread out in all directions.\\n\\n “Seven Emotions and Six Pleasures. Thirteen Transmigrations Dao turns into Thirteen Killing Forms. Consolidate into… Emotion Severing Extermination!” The blood magical symbols in front of Patriarch Huyan shockingly began to form together into the shape of a Heavenly saber. Instantly, it slashed down toward Meng Hao!\\n\\n In the following moment, Meng Hao’s finger slammed into the blood-colored Heavenly saber, and a huge boom rolled out. The blade shook for a moment and then exploded into countless pieces, completely destroyed. As for Meng Hao’s finger, it continued to descend until it tapped onto Patriarch Huyan’s chest.\\n\\n Blood sprayed from Patriarch Huyan’s mouth, and his chest turned into a bloody mass. Roaring filled his body as he shot backward at top speed. His face was pale white as he gave up all thoughts of fighting and focused completely on fleeing as fast as possible.\\n\\n He was in absolute fear of Meng Hao’s fleshly body. It turned into an intense dread as he realized that such a fleshly body was shocking to the extreme. His own divine abilities and magical techniques were incapable of even causing it to tremble.\\n\\n In the same instant that Patriarch Huyan decided to flee, Meng Hao’s voice once again drifted through the air.\\n\\n “Sixth Anima!”\\n\\n Boom!\\n\\n The instant Meng Hao entered the Sixth Anima, his body trembled. He lifted up his head and roared. To him, Patriarch Huyan could be killed any time he wanted. What he desired to do was to test out the Eighth Anima which he had created.\\n\\n As he entered the Sixth Anima, the power of thirty-two great circle Nascent Souls counted for almost nothing. What was truly shocking was his fleshly body. In the Sixth Anima, his power was now truly exploding out, as of this moment, a Spirit Severing aura was gradually beginning to seep out of him.\\n\\n The air around him filled with distortions, and the soil in the area was jumping up and down. A vortex began to form, like a mad tempest. The mad tempest could do nothing to cause even a single of Meng Hao’s hair to rise up, though. Within the tempest, he was the only thing that wasn’t moving!\\n\\n As soon as Patriarch Huyan saw this, despite his Cultivation base, his age, and his powers of concentration, he couldn’t help but shout out in alarm. “Fleshly body Spirit Severing!!! This is impossible!!!”\\n\\n As far as he could remember, a Spirit Severing fleshly body was a legendary stage that only existed in ancient times. It was both Spirit Severing and, not Spirit Severing, because it did not have a Domain. And yet, even without a Domain, such a fleshly body could compare to the peak of anyone in the Spirit Severing stage.\\n\\n Were he to also possess a Spirit Severing Cultivation base, then, any other Spirit Severing Cultivator would surely view him to be nothing less than… a nightmare!\\n\\n “Body cultivation is not a focus in the current generation. Such a thing has long since become a thing of the past. Don’t tell me that this guy… acquired some type of body tempering good fortune in the Demon Immortal Sect!?!?” Patriarch Huyan’s scalp was numb, and he was scared out of his mind as he fled at top speed. He was already well aware that Meng Hao’s magic had a Seventh Anima.\\n\\n As of this moment, Meng Hao’s Sixth Anima was already shocking enough. If he changed to the Seventh Anima….\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan wasn’t willing to risk his life and go all out here. He had more things to accomplish, so he ignored all matters of face and fled at top speed. However, no matter how fast he went, Meng Hao… was faster!\\n\\n Boom!\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao appeared ahead of Patriarch Huyan. In addition to blocking his path, he lifted up his right hand and waved his finger again.\\n\\n “We’re not finished here yet,” he said. “What are you getting so anxious for?”\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan’s face fell. Without hesitation, he performed a double-handed incantation, connecting the forefinger of each hand with the thumb of the other, with his palms facing away from each other. He immediately stretched his hands out toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n A four-sided collection of lines sprang into being, which was in accord with the Domain he cultivated. A power of expulsion rose up, with one side being Heaven and Earth, the other side being a person, to be expelled.\\n\\n The four-sided lines flickered as they shot forward, shooting against the wind as they expanded out to surround Meng Hao.\\n\\n At the same time, a shockingly intense power of expulsion seemed to fill the four-sided lines. This power of expulsion was intense enough to crush Meng Hao into pieces.\\n\\n “BEGONNEEEE….”\\n\\n The bizarre voice seemed to come from nowhere, and echoed out like thunder within Meng Hao’s ears. The sound caused the shocking power of expulsion to seem to grow even stronger.\\n\\n This was not Meng Hao’s first time to encounter this magical technique of Patriarch Huyan’s.\\n\\n Currently, he was in the Sixth Anima, and had terrifying fleshly body power. His eyes suddenly glittered. He opened his mouth and let out a roar toward the incoming four-sided lines.\\n\\n “Screw off!”\\n\\n The sound created something like waves that instantly suppressed all of the lightning up above. It rolled out, causing fissures to appear in the air, and rumbling sounds to be heard in all directions. The incoming four-sided line shape directly exploded into fragments.\\n\\n Its power of expulsion, having faced someone who it couldn’t possibly shake, was now nothing more than a joke!\\n\\n It was like a tiny stream that wanted to become as powerful as a mountain. How could it possibly succeed!?\\n\\n As the four-sided line shape collapsed, Meng Hao’s finger once again tapped onto Patriarch Huyan’s chest. A boom could be heard. Blood sprayed from Patriarch Huyan’s mouth, and his chest caved in bloodily. Even his back was a bloody mess as he staggered backward. He looked at Meng Hao, his face twisted with savagery.\\n\\n “I feel like leaving,” he growled. “You won’t let me? Seems you actually think I’m scared of you!” With that, Patriarch Huyan performed another incantation with his right hand. He pushed down onto his forehead, then opened his mouth to spit out a small, black-colored blade.\\n\\n As soon as the blade appeared, everything dimmed. It began to spin faster and faster in his palm, then grow rapidly in size. Shockingly, it transformed into a huge greatsword, upon which was carved the severed head of a dragon!\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan waved his right arm. His face was covered with a savage expression that seemed to say he was willing to go all out, even risk death, as he shot toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n “DIE!!” The power of Patriarch Huyan’s Cultivation base exploded out. In fact… the level of power he wielded now was multiple times greater than before. The area around him filled with ripples of ancientness that even seemed to contain natural law!!\\n\\n Natural laws of the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane!\\n\\n These natural laws contained a power of expulsion that had nothing to do with the four-sided line shape. This was a true power of expulsion from the world of the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane.\\n\\n The blade descended, shocking Heaven and Earth!\\n\\n “You will fear me,” said Meng Hao coolly as he entered… the Seventh Anima!!\\n\\n The power of sixty-four great circle Nascent Souls exploded out within him. His fleshly body unleashed even more Spirit Severing aura. Together, they caused the air around Meng Hao to begin to collapse. Roaring could be heard around him, almost as if this body of his was something that didn’t belong in this broken Demon Immortal Sect.\\n\\n It was as if there were invisible restrictions in this place, and any Cultivation base or battle prowess that exceeded those limitations were not permitted at all.\\n\\n With the battle prowess he was now displaying, Meng Hao had already touched that world limitation.\\n\\n “So, I don’t actually need to enter the Eighth Anima,” thought Meng Hao. “I’ve already reached fleshly body Spirit Severing!” As he took a moment to experience the sensation, he came to the realization that he…\\n\\n Was already in the Spirit Severing stage!\\n\\n Although he had no Domain, he was still of Spirit Severing!! In fact, he was even stronger than when he had borrowed the power of the mastiff, put on the Blood Immortal mask, and used the power of the Blood Immortal.\\n\\n He faced up against Patrairch Huyan’s descending blade, lifting his right hand without hesitation and pushing out with his finger.\\n\\n In this moment, everything suddenly seemed to freeze. The roaring sound that filled the air seemed to cease for a moment. And then, everything returned.\\n\\n Crashing booms echoed out one after another into the silence. They filled the entire Demon Immortal Sect, to be heard by each and every one of the Cultivators from South Heaven.\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan coughed up blood and tumbled backward. The huge black-colored blade in his hand broke up into fragments. His face was pale, and, ignoring any possible ramification that might give rise to expulsion, he employed the full power of his Cultivation base… to destroy his opponent!\\n\\n “You’re already at your limit with your Seventh Anima!” he said, his eyes filling with a streak of madness. “This is the strongest you can get!” He was panting now, the killing intent in his eyes strong. “Since that’s the case, let me escort you the rest of the way down your path!”\\n\\n Patriarch Huyan lifted his right hand up and pushed it down onto his chest. When he lifted it up, a red glow appeared, seemingly pulled out from his body itself.\\n\\n It was a red-colored whip, completely illusory and capable of lashing the soul. It looked exactly the same as the whip Meng Hao had stolen earlier from Patriarch Huyan, except that its color was different!\\n\\n As soon as the whip appeared, Patriarch Huyan’s fleshly body began to wither rapidly, as if all of his life force were being collected together in the whip. By now, his killing intent had reached a peak.\\n\\n Meng Hao stood motionlessly in the same place as before, the wind and dirt whipping around him, his hair flying about.\\n\\n In the space of a few breaths, the sand and wind around him dissipated….\\n\\n “DIE!!” howled Patriarch Huyan. His withered frame flickered, and a bizarre sound could be heard coming from the whip. It lashed down toward Meng Hao, filled with a bloodthirsty and terrifying aura.\\n\\n Meng Hao looked up. Not a tiny bit of sentiment could be seen in his eyes, only calmness as he observed the incoming soul whip and Patriarch Huyan, who emanated terrifying ripples. Meng Hao had tested out his new magical techniques; what he needed to do now was see… exactly how powerful he was!\\n\\n Closing his eyes, he coolly said, “Eighth Anima!”\\n\\n -----\\n\\n This chapter was sponsored by Sievajet Rahimbaksh, Zen Fei Lo, Jakub Jirovsky, Sub Claudio, Hoang Dang, Gary Kong, Abel Nunez, Marco Dupard, Elton Law\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-605","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
