{"id":52715,"no":390,"title":"Chapter 387: The Ninth Generation Demon Sealer’s First Sealing of the Heavens!","content":"“Heavenly Tribulation has five colors, and the five elements have five colors…. I wonder if there’s some connection between the two.” Meng Hao’s eyes glittered. Now was not the time to worry about such things. As soon as the five colors up above finished merging together, a five-colored bolt of Tribulation Lightning appeared and began to descend.\\n\\n At first glance, this five-colored Tribulation Lightning bolt looked to Meng Hao almost like a gigantic tree falling down from the sky. However, it quickly changed into something that resembled a golden sword. It pierced through the air, changing again, this time into a massive sea that seemed poised to wipe away everything in sight.\\n\\n After a brief moment, it changed another time. Now it was a Flame Sea that could burn away everything in existence, within the midst of which was an enormous bird formed from clay!\\n\\n These five changes happened instantly, and then vanished. However, Meng Hao saw them all; instantly his heart trembled as he understood what was happening.\\n\\n Boom!\\n\\n The five-colored Tribulation Lightning bolt slammed into Meng Hao. He had the Eyeless Larva and its silk. He had the Violet Pupil Transformation. He had a Perfect Cultivation base, exploding intense power. He had the glove on his right hand, which even Heavenly Tribulation could not destroy. A massive boom filled the ears of the five thousand running Cultivators, a boom that rose up all the way to the Heavens.\\n\\n When the five-colored Tribulation Lightning descended, one among the remaining three Nascent Soul Experts in the three thousand kilometer region shook and then exploded into a cloud of flesh and blood, which then dissolved into ash. His Nascent Soul was also exterminated.\\n\\n “Five-Colored Sky!” cried the white-robed Cultivator from the Constellation Tribe. “It’s the legendary Five-Colored Sky!!” By now, the man’s clothing hung in tatters on his body, and his ancient face was revealed. The most shocking thing was that his facial features were all deformed, and his ear was covered up with his own skin!\\n\\n His eyes shone with a red glow, and his body was trembling as he looked up into the sky. A look of unprecedented fear and awe could be seen in his eyes.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s body was also trembling. He clenched his jaw tightly as the five-colored lightning showered over him. It danced about, seemingly intent on ripping him to shreds and blotting out his soul. It wanted to bore into his flesh and smash his blood and Qi passageways.\\n\\n But the Eyeless Larva fought on tenaciously, like an ultimate treasure of Heaven and Earth, sending out layer after layer of unbreakable silk to shatter the five-colored Heavenly Tribulation.\\n\\n Thanks to the silk, the five-colored lightning gradually disappeared. Not a single lightning bolt could be seen anywhere. Meng Hao raised his head up and roared. Violet Qi surged, once again restoring his body. However, on his face, wrinkles of age were now visible.\\n\\n “Five-colored Tribulation Lightning cannot break the will of Meng Hao!”\\n\\n The Five-Colored Sky rumbled, and the seething clouds suddenly began to congeal together. As the clouds moved, it seemed as if Time itself were dancing within. Peals of thunder filled the Heavens as countless bolts of five-colored lightning appeared. All of them gradually began to merge.\\n\\n At the same moment, an unspeakable pressure could be felt from up above. As the clouds contracted, it seemed as if they were now filling with an unprecedented lightning of annihilation.\\n\\n “Hold on, Meng Hao!” squawked the parrot from its position outside the three thousand kilometer region. “This is the final bit of lightning!”\\n\\n The lightning rumbled as the final collection of Heavenly Tribulation formed. Within the space of about ten breaths, no more Tribulation Clouds could be seen in the sky. The only thing visible now was the glow of the five colors!\\n\\n This five-colored glow… was not lightning. Instead, it had taken the shape of a gigantic hand. Each finger of this hand was one color, making it a gigantic Five-Colored Palm. It was Heavenly, and of lightning; after all, it was formed out of five-colored lightning itself. Upon examination, this massive palm truly seemed incomparable.\\n\\n Strangely, it had no palm print whatsoever!\\n\\n Rumbling filled the air as the Five-Colored Palm began to fall down from the sky.\\n\\n As it neared, the ground shook, shattering the land within the three thousand kilometer area. Everything collapsed. The remaining two Nascent Soul Cultivators who held on until now could do so no longer. With blood curdling shrieks, they exploded. Their Nascent Souls, along with every trace of their life force, were completely eradicated.\\n\\n As for the white-robed member of the Constellation Tribe, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face filled with despair.\\n\\n The palm descended, and Meng Hao could feel an unprecedented pressure. His body trembled, his face paled, and blood sprayed from his mouth. He hovered there in mid air, shaking, slowly being pushed down by the immense pressure.\\n\\n The descended palm seemed capable of crushing a mountain into nothing; Meng Hao felt as if he couldn’t take it. He would soon be squished flat.\\n\\n “The final lightning,” said Meng Hao, his body trembling as he was pushed down. “You wish to exterminate me? Well, how about I seal you!” He suddenly threw his hand out. He emanated viciousness and madness as he pointed down to the ground.\\n\\n “Demonic Qi! Art of Righteous Bestowal!”\\n\\n Demonic Qi once again poured up from the land in the three thousand kilometer area. What Meng Hao wasn’t aware of, however, was that this time, there was simply not enough Demonic Qi. He continued to descend, until finally he landed directly onto the shattered earth.\\n\\n “Not enough Demonic Qi!!” he exclaimed, his facial features twisted. With a cry, he produced the Demon Sealing Jade. A deafening roar filled the air, and the earth trembled. At the same time, the Demon Sealing Jade in Meng Hao’s hand began to emanate ripples which extended out. Three thousand kilometers, five thousand kilometers….\\n\\n Meng Hao’s face twisted with savagery. Power poured out from the Frigid Snow Clan’s Agarwood legacy, as well as Immortal Shows the Way, which he had received during the events near the Rebirth Cave. The power shot out of him and then into the Demon Sealing Jade.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s mind spun. The ripples from the Demon Sealing Jade spread out. Five thousand kilometers. Fifteen thousand kilometers….\\n\\n A complete fifteen thousand kilometers!\\n\\n Suddenly, Meng Hao could sense all of the vegetation that existed in this area. All living things existed within his will. Every change and fluctuation was under his control.\\n\\n “Demonic Qi! Art of Righteous Bestowal!” He looked up at the enormous Five-Colored Palm that was descending onto him. As his voice echoed out, all of the Demonic Qi within the fifteen thousand kilometer region rushed madly toward him.\\n\\n It congealed around Meng Hao, creating a vortex of Demonic Qi. It started out thirty meters wide, then three hundred, then three thousand, finally thirty thousand meters!\\n\\n Meng Hao’s eyes glowed with brilliance and determination. He slowly lifted his right hand up and then extended it toward the massive palm up above.\\n\\n As he did, the Demonic Qi vortex lifted up, forming into a hand that was visible to no one except Meng Hao.\\n\\n This palm seemed capable of sealing anything in Heaven and Earth!\\n\\n “I am the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer! I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS!”\\n\\n He struck his right hand up toward the descending Five-Colored Palm.\\n\\n His strike carried along with it his stubborness, his dream of treading the path of Cultivation until he became a powerful expert, and in addition, his very life force!\\n\\n After all, if he could not transcend this tribulation, then he would be dead without a doubt!\\n\\n This strike also carried with it Meng Hao’s Immortal Shows the Way, the Agarwood legacy of the Frigid Snow Clan, and his own madness.\\n\\n Such madness was required! This was not a battle of magic, but a sealing of the Heavens!\\n\\n This strike was filled with the dignity of the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, with the power to seal the Heavens, and the explosive power of all the Demonic Qi of the land within fifteen thousand kilometers!\\n\\n In addition to all this, the Li Clan Patriarch emerged, along with the howling meat jelly. Every tool he had to fight back against the Heavenly Tribulation was now in play!\\n\\n The parrot was clamouring excitedly, its eyes bloodshot. This was the moment it had been waiting for. It was only when the final lightning bolt descended that it could make a move, and lead in the five thousand Cultivators. This way, they would not be infected by the lightning.\\n\\n The five thousand Cultivators shot toward Meng Hao, circling around him. Massive amounts of fog rose up to fight back against the final bolt of Heavenly Tribulation Lightning.\\n\\n An immense roaring, louder than anything that had occurred up to this point, pressed down onto the five thousand Cultivators, covering over even their shouts. It was the only thing that could be heard… and it echoed five times!\\n\\n This sound was none other than the sound of the two gigantic palms slamming into each other and shattering.\\n\\n Upon the first echo, the five thousand Cultivators coughed up blood. They were thrown tumbling across the ground in all directions, and the fog dissipated. The white-robed man from the Constellation Tribe screamed as he was shredded into pieces, his body and spirit annihilated.\\n\\n Upon the second echo, the sky and land shook. Everything on the surface of the land was transformed into ash and ruins. All the crystalline ground became a huge crater….\\n\\n Upon the third echo, the meat jelly let out a plaintive howl, and the Li Clan Patriarch teetered on the verge of destruction.\\n\\n Upon the fourth echo, the parrot let out a disconsolate shriek as all of the colorful feathers on its body were shattered. Everything visible was now a world of five colors.\\n\\n Upon the fifth echo… Meng Hao saw his Demonic Heaven-Sealing Palm slam into the Five-Colored Palm. It looked as if a massive sealing mark were preparing to seal up the Heavenly Tribulation.\\n\\n Amidst the roaring, the two palms collided. One was of the Five-Colored Sky. One was from a Demonic Sealer of the Heavens. One wished to destroy. One wished to seal the Heavens. The amount of power involved was impossible to describe. In this moment, the Heavens were not the Heavens, the Earth was not the Earth, and the Demonic was not Demonic!\\n\\n The air itself shattered. As the roar filled everything, the five-colored world suddenly faded into complete blackness….\\n\\n Within the blackness, Meng Hao’s eyes shone with faith. He glared up at the black Heavens, and softly said, “So, you can seal the Heavens!”\\n\\n With that, an incredible sense of weakness poured out from within his heart. Smiling, he closed his eyes, employing the Eyeless Larva’s ultimate protective ability. Endless amounts of silk shot out, transforming into an enormous cocoon!\\n\\n Meng Hao’s body was completely encased inside the cocoon.\\n\\n There was no sound. No Heavenly Tribulation. There within the crater, was a cocoon that seemed as if it would be there for an eternity.\\n\\n Gradually, the sky regained its color. The Five-Colored Palm was gone. Meng Hao’s Demonic Sealing Palm had transformed into ash. The only thing that remained was that which had formed the nucleus of the palm, the Demon Sealing Jade. It banged down onto the ground near Meng Hao’s cocoon.\\n\\n The pressure exerted by the Heavenly Tribulation was now gone. The area which the Tribulation had descended upon… was now completely soundless and motionless. The Tribulation had been transcended.\\n\\n The parrot and the meat jelly, as well as the surrounding five thousand Cultivators, all looked weary and listless. They gathered around the cocoon to stand guard for Meng Hao and wait for him to break out.\\n\\n Time passed. Soon, an aura of transformation emerged from the cocoon. Inside, Meng Hao was sleeping, but his body was gradually changing. He was now even more accustomed to lightning. In fact, occasionally, bolts of lightning would shoot out from his body to dance around the cocoon and then spread out into the region beyond.\\n\\n -----\\n\\n This chapter was sponsored by Deathblade!!!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-387","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
