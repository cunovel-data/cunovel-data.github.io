{"id":52779,"no":454,"title":"Chapter 451: Western Desert Apocalypse!!","content":"There was a legend in the great lands of the Western Desert, the source of which was impossible to determine. In any case, over the years, this legend came to exist in the minds of all Tribes in the Western Desert. It was even recorded in the ancient records of the Tribes and passed down from generation to generation. But then, even more time passed. Eventually, people began to forget about the legend. It wasn’t that there was no knowledge about it at all, just, most people didn’t remember…. According to the legend, at a time many, many years in the past, the Western Desert was not a continent, but rather, a sea. The sea existed for thirty thousand years before vanishing to reveal the continent beneath. During that time, the Western Desert… was not called the Western Desert, but rather a different name. The Western Sea. This sea was not the same color as the Milky Way Sea. Rather, it was violet, and its waters had the power to cause all life to become extinct. It even cut off spiritual energy, making the area a prohibited zone for living things. There was an area of division between the Milky Way Sea and this Sea, as if they intentionally did not want to mix. According to the legend, the Western Sea was not completely without any land mass. There was one area with land, a part that was connected to the Southern Domain. That was none other than... the Black Lands. In terms of elevation, the Black Lands were relatively high. Such high elevation was something that Cultivators wouldn’t pay too much attention to. However, the Black Lands were actually the highest place in the entire continent, including the Western Desert and the Southern Domain. It was so high that even after the Western Desert became a sea… it still existed. The legend said that long before the Western Desert, and even before the Western Sea, the entire land was filled with abundant resources and dense spiritual energy. However, it eventually experienced a fall of violet rain that lasted many years. The rainwater did not soak into the earth, but rather began to collect on its surface. Gradually the waters turned into streams, which then formed lakes, and eventually turned into a sea. The violet rain had the power to destroy the life force of any living thing it touched, and could even cut off spiritual energy. All spell formations ceased to function, and it became difficult for Cultivators to survive there. Everything was plunged into destruction. Countless varieties of vegetation died, and an innumerable amount of animals became nothing more than skeletons. Multitudinous life forms… reached the end of their path. This was a catastrophe that affected the lives of all Tribes in the Western Desert, an Apocalypse of Heaven and Earth! This was the legend that existed within each and every Tribe. Right now, the body of the Five Poisons Tribe High Priest was trembling, and his face was pale. He slowly reached his hand out to catch some violet raindrops. He stared blankly; it felt as if this rain was causing his Cultivation base to slowly fade away. He was now shaking, and his eyes filled with dread. He looked down as the rainwater collected on the ground, mixing together with the blood. There were some places in which cracks existed in the ground where the water drained into. However… most of the water appeared to be just floating there, mixing with the blood. The High Priest’s face was completely ashen, and he was panting. “This is… this is impossible….” he murmured. There were some of the Five Poison Tribe’s Nascent Soul Cultivators who also seemed to be reaching the same conclusion as the High Priest. Their faces began to flicker as they looked at the violet rain. Zhao Youlan suddenly staggered backward a few steps, staring blankly at the rain. Clearly, she too had just come to a certain realization. At the same time, inside the Thorn Rampart, the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather was staring at the rain in stupefaction. His face completely fell as a despair filled him even that was even more terrible than that which could be caused by the destruction of his Tribe. “Apocalypse….” “The Western Desert Apocalypse….” “According to the legends, an Apocalypse will come that will exterminate all life and change the Western Desert into the Western Sea!!” The Five Poisons Tribe High Priest backed up a few steps. At that moment, the war, the spot in the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, the spoils… none of them were important. Without hesitation, he began to activate the teleportation spell again as a means to test whether or not the stories about the violet rain were true. Before, the teleportation spell had worked, but now… no matter what he tried, he couldn’t get it to work. It was as if something were blocking its power, making it completely useless. The sight of this turned into a roaring sound that filled the minds of the Five Poisons Tribe High Priest. “Migrate. The Tribe must migrate!” he murmured to himself. “The Western Desert North is the lowest place in the whole Western Desert. This is the first place where the sea will rise up! The Tribe must migrate, migrate to south. We… must go to the Black Lands near the Southern Domain!!” The rain continued to grow heavier. Already, the Cultivators were beginning to sense that the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was becoming thinner. This immediately caused the faces of the Five Poisons Tribe members to fall. “The Black Lands… the Black Lands!! Now I understand!” A tremor ran through the High Priest; his eyes went wide and filled with even more urgency. “It makes sense. All those years ago, the three great Tribes with Spirit Severing Patriarchs made an alliance and invaded the Black Lands. They even joined forces with some of the powers in the Black Lands. “They were careful not to offend the Southern Domain in their war! After the war, many of the other Tribes connected to them also migrated to the Black Lands! “They knew! They carved out an area for themselves in the Black Lands, making it even easier to have dealings with the Southern Domain. Or, maybe they had some other purposes. “In any case, it all makes sense now!” The High Priest’s panting grew even more intense as he murmured to himself. “Those three enormous great Tribes knew all along that the Apocalypse was coming. They occupied the Black Lands. Now, anyone who wants to go to the Black Lands will only be able to do so with their approval!! “Without spilling a drop of blood, they wrested control over all the powers in the Western Desert! They will be able to control the fate of thousands of Tribes during the Apocalypse!” The High Priest’s eyes filled with anxiety. “The Black Lands is small. There’s no way it can hold all of the Tribes of the Western Desert. But any who don’t go there… will be exterminated without a doubt. The Five Poisons Tribe is in the north. So far away….” He suddenly raised his voice loudly. “All Five Poisons Tribe members, hear my orders. We must leave this place immediately. Whatever the cost, employ the greatest speed possible to return to the Tribe!” This was a critical moment in which every bit of time was important. The war with the broken remnants of the Crow Divinity Tribes was now inconsequential. In fact, now he felt regret over having gone to war in the first place! The members of the Five Poisons Tribe heard his words and gaped in astonishment. However, based on the ashen expressions of the various Elders, they had guessed that something was going on. Without hesitation, they followed orders and flew up into the air. Soon, not a single member of the Five Poisons Tribe was fighting. Nearly twenty thousand Cultivators and tens of thousands of neo-demons all roared through the air to disappear off in the distance. Zhao Youlan was amongst them. However, as she flew off, she looked back at the Crow Divinity Tribes and the protective Thorn Rampart, and her eyes filled with a sharp glow. “You will pay tenfold for severing my arm!” she thought. Then she turned and followed the rest of the Five Poisons Tribe members off into the distance. After the Five Poisons Tribe left, the Thorn Rampart slowly began to retract and disappear. Meng Hao rose up from his cross-legged position and looked off at the horizon. Behind him, the more than two thousand surviving Tribe members let out cries of relief at their sudden new lease on life. However, their happiness could not dispel the shadow that lingered over Meng Hao’s heart. Next to him, the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather had a bitter look on his face. “Is it true?” said Meng Hao slowly. “For the Five Poisons Tribe to make such a hasty exit indicates that the legendary Apocalypse is mostly likely coming. Spell formations will become inoperable and the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth will be extinguished. All life will be destroyed…. The only hope…. “The only hope is to migrate to the south,” said the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather, his voice low. “Head south and keep going all the way to the Black Lands.” “The Black Lands….” Meng Hao’s body suddenly shook. Like the Five Poisons Tribe High Priest, Meng Hao also thought of the war that the Western Desert had participated in back in the Black Lands. He thought about the Western Desert Tribes he’d seen entering the Black Lands during his departure. “So, this is the reason for all of it!” he thought. Finally, he understood something that for so long had been a point of confusion. This was why war had broken out in the Black Lands. This was why the Western Desert had participated with such gusto. And this was why the Southern Domain did nothing to stop it. They allowed the Western Desert to occupy the Black Lands. A great Apocalypse of Heaven and Earth was coming. If the Southern Domain attempted to obstruct the Western Desert, a full scale war would have broken out. That was something the Southern Domain wouldn’t want. Meng Hao looked up at the increasingly heavy rain. A gleam suddenly appeared in his eyes. “The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth is being extinguished. All living things will be destroyed. The continent will turn into a sea…. For me, it’s not that bad. After the experience of using the East Pill Everburning Flame to form my Fire-type totem tattoo, I know… that all things in Heaven and Earth exist on the path of the five elements, and have the potential to give enlightenment. “What better type of water could you use than a sea!? And what better sea could there be than one referred to as the Western Desert Apocalypse!? “As for the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth being extinguished… with the exception of the ultra high-grade Spirit Stones, I’ve already gone for many years without absorbing it. That’s why I’ve supported myself by consuming medicinal pills. Every time I attack, I must very carefully control the spiritual energy I use. Furthermore, I’ve constantly been improving my pill concocting skills. “For the same reason, I was always inclined toward being a Dragoneer. Only Dragoneers can grow strong without wasting very much spiritual power! “The main thing I need to be careful of is that the rain can exterminate life force…. In any case, I am definitely the most suitable person to exist within the Western Desert Apocalypse!” Meng Hao’s eyes glittered for a moment. However, he then looked at the rejoicing members of the Five Tribes. They didn’t know about this Apocalypse. Seeing the happiness of the children caused him to think for a long moment. “Golden Crow,” he said, closing his eyes. “I have accepted your legacy. Your Tribe calls me their Sacred Ancient, and I am connected to them through totems. Is this… is this the protection you wish me to give them…?” As of this moment, all sky and land of the Western Desert North regions was filled with violet-colored rain. No sun could be seen in the sky, and everything was dark. This was a dusk that would last a very, very long time…. Down on the ground, the water slowly began to pool up. More and more puddles could be seen. It wasn’t just in the North region of the Western Desert. In the East, West and South, it was just the same. Violet rain began to fall, and as it did, more and more cries of alarm could be heard. Hearts shook.
