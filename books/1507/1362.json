Furthermore... Paragon Xuan Fang himself had traveled back in time!\n The injuries that had just been inflicted on him by the light arrow suddenly faded away as he appeared on the surface of the sun!\n Massive rumbling sounds could be heard, and the whole sun began to vibrate. The sudden turn of events caused Meng Hao’s eyes to narrow.\n “The Essence of Time!!” Meng Hao had fought many people in his life, and although he might not have as much experience as Xuan Fang, he came close. Therefore, it was without the slightest hesitation that he reacted. In fact, his physical reaction was even faster than his mental reaction, as his cultivation base exploded with power, taking the power of the spell formation formed by the 100,000 cultivators and sending a vicious attack out.\n That attack contained the full power of the sun, becoming a beam of light that shot, not directly toward Xuan Fang, but toward the black pearl.\n That pearl gave Meng Hao a very bad feeling.\n The golden light which emanated off of Paragon Xuan Fang had faded some. Clearly, using the Heaven-defying Timeshift magic was not something he could easily do. In fact, most likely, he wouldn’t be able to unleash the same magic again any time soon; in that respect, it was similar to Meng Hao’s Essence of Space.\n In any case, Paragon Xuan Fang’s sudden appearance on the sun not only caused Meng Hao’s eyes to widen, Paragon Sea Dream was clearly shocked.\n Paragon Sea Dream instantly drew upon her full power to teleport over to the region of the sun. Meng Hao also used divine will to call his Paragon puppet over to help extricate himself from the danger!\n Amidst rumbling sounds, brilliant light shot toward the pearl that Paragon Xuan Fang was slamming toward the surface of the sun with such speed that it seemed that it would surely be able to intercept the pearl before its impact.\n Xuan Fang snorted coldly, then suddenly let go of the black pearl, allowing the light of the sun to slam into it. A huge boom then echoed out as the pearl was completely shattered.\n As that happened, black mist spread out, which Meng Hao could instantly tell was filled with some sort of incredible sealing power. Thankfully, it had been destroyed before being fully unleashed; had it been used, even a Paragon would have been hard pressed to undo the sealing effect.\n Clearly, the pearl had been a precious treasure that only a Paragon could create!\n As soon as the black pearl shattered, Paragon Xuan Fang suddenly flickered into motion. In the blink of an eye, he was off in the distance. However, he was still on the surface of the sun, and shockingly, another black pearl could be seen in his hand. A vicious grin could be seen on his face as he completely ignored the incoming Sea Dream and Paragon puppet.\n “When I attack, I plan things meticulously,” he said coolly. “Things rarely go awry when I make a move!” With that he viciously threw the black pearl down toward the surface of the sun.\n “Why does he insist on slamming that thing into the sun...?” thought Meng Hao, frowning. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head, and at the same time, the Lightning Cauldron appeared. Electricity danced as Meng Hao teleported out of the spell formation. Xuan Fang’s jaw dropped as, in the blink of an eye, Form Displacement Transposition caused him to switch places with Meng Hao.\n Meng Hao waved his hand, and just as the black pearl was about to slam into the surface of the sun, he scooped it up.\n As soon as he touched it, he understood.\n “He doesn’t want to seal this moment in time, and he doesn\u0027t want to use the pearl to kill me, he wants... to seal the sun!” With that, he looked up, and his pupils constricted as he realized that Paragon Xuan Fang... had produced a third black pearl.\n This time, Xuan Fang didn’t speak. In almost the same instant that Meng Hao laid eyes on him, he didn’t throw the pearl down, but simply crushed it.\n As the pearl was crushed, thick black mist exploded out, instantly swirling out to cover the entire sun, creating something like a unique Domain.\n It was at this point that Meng Hao’s Paragon puppet closed in and unleashed a fist strike upon the black mist. However, the power of that strike disappeared as quickly as a stone ox thrown into the ocean. Furthermore, there was no reaction whatsoever from the mist.\n As for Paragon Sea Dream, as soon as she was close enough, she waved her finger, sending Paragon power exploding out. However, it did nothing to the mist except cause it to shudder and loosen slightly.\n “Those are Gloompearls!!” An extremely unsightly expression appeared on Sea Dream’s face. Gloompearls were not something from the 33 Heavens. Back when the Paragon Immortal Realm faced complete catastrophe, one of the two major enemy forces created them with the express purpose of ensnaring powerful experts of the Immortal World. Once their power was unleashed, it couldn\u0027t easily be dispelled.\n At the very least, it could trap everything inside of it for a quarter of an hour.\n During that quarter hour, whatever was inside the mist was completely cut off from the rest of the world!\n Even as Sea Dream’s face flickered, Paragon Xuan Fang was within the mist, eyes flickering with icy killing intent. Although he initially appeared to be going after the Paragon puppet, in the blink of an eye, he changed his target to Meng Hao. But then, just when everyone thought he was actually trying to kill Meng Hao, he unleashed a Gloompearl to lock down the sun!\n He had even prepared three pearls, all to ensure that the power of the sun could not be unleashed. That would remove one of the major obstacles to the invading army.\n However just when people thought they knew what Xuan Fang was trying to do, he suddenly changed tactics again. Instead of trying to keep the sun sealed, he targeted Meng Hao. The truth was that few people would be able to guess... exactly what his goals were.\n Right now, the sun was cut off because of the mist. Sea Dream and the Paragon puppet were on the outside, trying to batter their way in, trying to undo the seal. Meanwhile, Meng Hao was inside, facing incredible danger.\n “I have a quarter of an hour to kill you, and that’s all I need!” Xuan Fang laughed loudly, erupting with the cultivation base power of a Paragon as he took a step forward toward Meng Hao.\n Meng Hao’s face darkened. Xuan Fang was turning into a real headache; not only was his cultivation base incredibly powerful, his ability to scheme ran deep and profound. He was proving much more difficult to deal with than Eegoo.\n Even as Xuan Fang bore down on him, Meng Hao backed up, sending out divine will to gather the power of the spell formation. Rumbling sounds could be heard as brilliant light exploded out, transforming into a light arrow that shot toward Xuan Fang.\n Xuan Fang roared and performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing an enormous golden lion to appear behind him. The lion rapidly grew in size, covering Xuan Fang and taking the hit of the arrow instead of him.\n A boom rang out as the light arrow pierced into the image of the lion, which distorted, and then, before it could even roar, shattered into pieces. The light arrow, despite dimming somewhat, continued to stab toward Xuan Fang, who then reached out and grabbed it. As he crushed his hand down, the light arrow collapsed, and Xuan Fang backed up a few steps, his face pale and yet covered with an expression of scorn.\n “The treasures passed down by Nine Seals are truly powerful. Unfortunately, you can only unleash a limited bit of its power. Perhaps if you struck me over and over again in quick succession, you would have a chance to kill me. However, you can only unleash the power with the help of that spell formation, and those 100,000 cultivators which maintain it. What a joke!\n “Besides, for the next ten breaths of time at the minimum, you will not be able to unleash the power of this sun!” Even as he spoke, Xuan Fang launched himself toward Meng Hao, golden light flickering around him as he clenched his fist and punched out.\n “Your fleshly body has the signs of fleshly body cultivation. Let’s see how well you cultivated it!”\n The fist strike was powerful enough to shatter mountains and crush the earth. The sun trembled, and boundless golden light radiated out as a gigantic lion appeared within the fist strike, roaring as it charged toward Meng Hao.\n Paragon power dispelled the natural laws in the area, causing the 100,000 cultivators to cough up mouthfuls of blood. There were even some who exploded into showers of blood and gore.\n Meng Hao’s cultivation base suddenly teetered unstably, and he staggered backward. At the same time, Paragon Sea Dream’s voice echoed urgently from beyond the mist, sounding almost as if it were coming from a different time and space.\n “Meng Hao, just hold on for a quarter of an hour!! That’s the longest it will take us to break this seal.”\n The danger was intense, leaving Meng Hao’s heart pounding. He might be as powerful as the peak of 6-Essences, capable of fighting with Imperial Lords. However, the difference between that and a Paragon, was too vast. He was currently trapped, with nowhere to flee, and no choice but to fight to the death.\n In this critical juncture, Meng Hao dismissed all notions of coming up with a clever idea. Instead, his mind thrummed with the desire... to fight!\n “A quarter hour....” he thought, eyes flickering with killing intent. Then, he sent his divine sense rocketing toward Xuan Fang in a vicious attack. Instead of falling back, he fought back against the pressure, taking a step forward and unleashing his own fist strike!\n Life-Extermination!\n Everything shook violently, and a tempest sprang out in all direction as Meng Hao’s fist strike slammed into Paragon Xuan Fang’s. A huge boom could be heard, and blood sprayed out of Meng Hao’s mouth. However, his expression was extremely vicious as he took another step forward and unleashed a second fist strike.\n Bedevilment Fist!\n No survival without Bedevilment! Meng Hao laughed uproariously. Massive energy was unleashed by the fist strike, causing a deafening boom to ring out. Even Paragon Xuan Fang was taken aback. Meng Hao coughed up more blood, and cracking sounds could be heard coming from within him.\n He might have a Dao Sovereign fleshly body, but Xuan Fang was a Paragon, with an even stronger fleshly body, one that vastly exceeded Meng Hao’s\n “You really want to die?!” Xuan Fang laughed coldly. Rotating his cultivation base, he caused intense pressure to spread out. The golden lion roared, completely suppressing Meng Hao’s Bedevilment Fist, and then appearing directly in front of Meng Hao himself.\n It was at this point that Meng Hao\u0027s eyes shone with a brilliant light as he... unleashed a third fist strike!\n It was none other than... the God-Slaying Fist!\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1358","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
