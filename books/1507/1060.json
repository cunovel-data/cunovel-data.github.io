And yet, because of the even more mysterious and unfathomable copper mirror, this Paragon\u0027s blood had now appeared in the Mountain and Sea Realm!\\n\\n In the instant that the blood appeared, it wasn’t just Meng Hao who was shaken. The entire Mountain and Sea Realm began to tremble. It didn\u0027t matter that the parrot and meat jelly were covering up the aura with all their might. The aura still managed to spread out invisibly. Although nobody in the Nine Seas God World could sense it specifically, there were other beings in the Mountain and Sea Realm who did, and were completely shocked.\\n\\n Nine great Mountains and Seas made up the Mountain and Sea Realm, outside of which was a sun and a moon that orbited eternally around it. It was because of those two heavenly bodies that the Mountain and Sea Realm had day and night!\\n\\n At the moment, both of them were trembling, something that caused everyone, even the mortals, to stare up in shock to look.\\n\\n As of this moment, people were trembling in shock in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, the Eighth Mountain and Sea, the Seventh Mountain and Sea... even the First Mountain and Sea. In all the Mountain and Sea Realm, people were shaking in astonishment.\\n\\n “The sun... is trembling!!”\\n\\n “The moon is shaking....”\\n\\n “What’s happening!? What’s causing this!?” Within the Mountain and Sea Realm, countless living beings were flabbergasted. Even the animals were prostrating themselves on the ground as if in worship. The mortals were astonished and began bowing down with looks of pious reverence on their faces.\\n\\n As for the cultivators, their scalps tingled as they observed something they had never before seen; the sun and moon shaking. It left them completely astonished.\\n\\n Countless experts flew out, including all of the Dao Realm cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm, and the shock on their faces was clear.\\n\\n Numerous beings saw the sun and the moon shaking visibly; instead of continuing on in their orbit, they were fixed in place, seemingly immovable. It was as if some unknown aura had caught their attention, causing their will to suddenly awaken.\\n\\n At the same time that the heavenly bodies ceased moving, the Seas in the Mountain and Sea Realm all began to seethe and roar; the Mountains also began to shake, and were apparently roaring.\\n\\n If you looked very carefully at the sun, you would just barely be able to tell that inside of that heavenly body, shockingly, was a sword!\\n\\n It was a shining sword, shocking to the extreme. It was a sword that, in the past, had shaken the hearts of countless crowds of people, and had killed innumerable enemies.\\n\\n That was... the sword of a Paragon! In the past, it had caused the entire Immortal World to tremble, and during the great catastrophe, it had rocked the 3,000 Lower Realms. The other two major powers in the war shook any time they heard the name...\\n\\n Nine Seals Sword!\\n\\n When Paragon Nine Seals perished, his sword went missing. Now, though, it suddenly appeared in the middle of the sun. Or perhaps... it wasn’t just appearing there. Perhaps...\\n\\n The sun of the Mountain and Sea Realm was the manifestation of the Nine Seals Sword of the past!!\\n\\n Anyone who knew anything about the history of the Mountain and Sea Realm suddenly felt their minds reeling.\\n\\n “The Nine Seals Sword! Heavens! The sun is actually the materialization of the Nine Seals Sword... how could this be possible!?!?”\\n\\n “Impossible! This goes contrary to everything we know about history! How could this be happening!?!?”\\n\\n At the same time, a massive aura was awakening inside of the moon. Just barely, an object was becoming visible inside of it!\\n\\n It was not a sword, it was... a suit of armor!\\n\\n A suit of armor formed from moonbeams!!\\n\\n The armor shone with glorious light that was both soft and austere. It was as if the armor had been splashed with infinite amounts of blood, as if it had seen countless battles. In the past, the name of this suit of armor had rocked the world...\\n\\n Nine Seals Armor!!\\n\\n Paragon Nine Seals’ two great Paragon artifacts!\\n\\n All of the Nine Mountains and Seas were completely shaken!\\n\\n “I just remembered a legend I heard about once....” Similar words were echoing in the minds of many of the Dao Realm experts of the Nine Mountains and Seas. It was a story that all of them had taken to be completely wild and absurd.\\n\\n “According to the legend, each Mountain and Sea in the Realm will have a Mountain and Sea Lord to unify that area! But... the truth of the matter is that the there is a position of power higher than that of the Lords of the Nine Mountains and Seas! A more powerful being... the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm!\\n\\n “The Lord of the entire Mountain and Sea Realm can exterminate a Mountain and Sea with a single thought, then create another one just as easily. That person will lead the Mountain and Sea Realm back to the former glory of the Paragon Immortal Realm!\\n\\n “The legend says that when the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm finally appears, the sun and the moon will stop moving! Light will fill the entire Mountain and Sea Realm! According to the legend... the nine Xuanwu turtles will kowtow and let out a massive roar!” Many of the Dao Realm experts of the Mountain and Sea Realm were murmuring things like this. In the Fourth Mountain and Sea, Kṣitigarbha\u0027s eyes were shining with a strange light as he looked up into the Heavens and the starry sky.\\n\\n It was in that moment that, all of a sudden, a massive Xuanwu turtle rose up from within the celestial pond atop the First Mountain, just like the Xuanwu turtle had done in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Apparently, all of the Mountains had a Xuanwu turtle like this as their nucleus.\\n\\n The Xuanwu turtle opened its eyes, and it began to tremble, then let out a massive roar that filled the entire First Mountain and Sea.\\n\\n That roar filled the hearts and minds of all cultivators who had been born in the First Mountain and Sea.\\n\\n At almost exactly the same time, a similar roar could be heard coming from the Xuanwu turtle who sat atop the Second Mountain in the Second Mountain and Sea. Next, the same thing happened in the Third Mountain and Sea, the Fourth Mountain and Sea, and the Fifth Mountain and Sea....\\n\\n Finally, the Xuanwu turtle from the Ninth Mountain and Sea joined in, and the roars combined into a unified sound that shook the entire Mountain and Sea Realm.\\n\\n Countless individuals were shaken physically and mentally as the supreme Xuanwu turtles, which represented all of the Nine Mountains and Seas, suddenly rose up into the starry sky, whereupon their roars reached a fever pitch.\\n\\n In the end, all of them... did something completely shocking. They turned in the same direction and bowed, as if they were offering respectful greetings to their Lord!!\\n\\n The direction in which they faced, shockingly... was the Ninth Mountain and Sea!!\\n\\n The entire world was shaken, and the whole Mountain and Sea Realm was filled with rumbling sounds!\\n\\n As of this moment, countless Dao Realm experts were thoroughly shaken. All of them turned to look in the direction of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. As for the Dao Realm experts in the Ninth Mountain and Sea itself, they were dumbfounded.\\n\\n The strangest thing of all was that no one could tell exactly which area within the Ninth Mountain and Sea the Xuanwu turtles were facing!\\n\\n The roars of the nine Xuanwu turtles echoed out for a long time. The sound was archaic and icy cold, as if it was completely devoid of any emotion. It was almost as if... it were mechanical!\\n\\n “The Realm Lord cometh... the Lord of all the Mountain and Sea Realm! The Nine Hexes shall be inscribed... in the moment of His return to power!”\\n\\n The words spread out throughout all of the Nine Mountains and Seas, echoing into countless minds, giving rise to waves of intense shock. It was as if the entire world had been overturned. All cultivators of the Nine Mountains and Seas felt as if their minds were being struck by hundreds of thousands of lightning bolts.\\n\\n “Realm Lord? The Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm?”\\n\\n “What exactly is going on? What’s happening?!”\\n\\n “Return? Could it be that when the Realm Lord returns, the fate of all the Nine Mountains and Seas can be controlled by just a single one of his thoughts?”\\n\\n “The nine Xuanwu turtles are all facing the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Could it be... could it be that the so-called Realm Lord is in the Ninth Mountain and Sea?!?!”\\n\\n Countless minds were sent spinning. On the four planets of the Ninth Mountain and Sea, in the Four Great Clans, the Five Great Holy Lands, and the Three Churches and Six Sects, all of the Chosen were astonished, and were shaking in anticipation.\\n\\n All of the Dao Realm experts could see that the Xuanwu turtle in their Mountain and Sea... was looking at their own Ninth Mountain and Sea!\\n\\n It was the same in the Three Great Daoist Societies!\\n\\n In the Nine Seas God World, Fan Dong’er, the Demonic cultivators, the three Patriarchs, and all of the other Dao Realm cultivators, were all shocked. Of course, none of them had any idea that all of these shocking events were being caused by someone within the Nine Seas God World itself.\\n\\n Also astonished were the current Mountain and Sea Lords of the Nine Mountains and Seas. All of them felt their energy surging, filling their respective Mountains and Seas with solemnity and a domineering air.\\n\\n Lord Ji also appeared in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, and massive pressure radiated out from that enormous eye.\\n\\n These Lords... would not be willing to easily accept someone who was placed higher than them, a Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm!\\n\\n Meanwhile, in the Ruins of Immortality in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, the white-robed Paragon Sea Dream sat cross-legged in meditation. Li Ling’er sat next to her in exactly the same posture.\\n\\n Suddenly, Paragon Sea Dream opened her phoenix-like eyes, and her expression flickered. A shocked expression appeared on her face, and she rose to her feet and stepped forward. When her foot landed, she was outside of the Ruins of Immortality, hovering in the starry sky, looking toward the Ninth Sea!\\n\\n “Big brother Nine Seals’ Paragon blood....” she murmured. A tremor ran through her, and a look of utter disbelief could be seen on her face. After a long moment, she recovered her composure, and a strange gleam appeared in her eyes.\\n\\n “The League of Demon Sealers. It’s him....”\\n\\n As of this moment, countless figures throughout the Mountain and Sea Realm were making various speculations as to who it was... that would bring such momentous changes in the future, the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm!\\n\\n Some people were prepared to respectfully welcome such a person. Others prepared to kill and supplant him. Various thoughts rose up in various minds. In addition, many people left their respective Mountains and Seas to fly toward the Ninth Mountain and Sea.\\n\\n Everything was thrown into chaos in a single moment. An unprecedented commotion gripped all of the Nine Mountains and Seas!\\n\\n Currently, Meng Hao sat in his mountain valley, experiencing the same shock that everyone outside in the Nine Mountains and Seas was feeling. He could also hear the cry of the nine Xuanwu turtles.\\n\\n He was trembling, panting, his face covered with an expression of complete disbelief.\\n\\n “The League of Demon Sealers.... I can\u0027t believe it was actually founded by Paragon Nine Seals!!” Great waves of shock crashed through Meng Hao’s heart. Never would he ever have speculated that the League of Demon Sealers... had originated with such a shocking figure!\\n\\n Furthermore, he was the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer! Nine was the ultimate number, and he was the final generation of the Demon Sealers!\\n\\n “I\u0027m the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, and this drop of blood comes from Paragon Nine Seals. He founded the League of Demon Sealers, which means... he and I are connected by destiny!” Meng Hao panted, and his mind trembled.\\n\\n “The Nine Hexes shall be inscribed... in the moment of His return to power…. Nine Hexes. That means that when I possess all nine of the Demon Sealing Hexing magics, then in that moment... I will be the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm!!” Meng Hao felt a bit dizzy. Even now, he found it... hard to believe.\\n\\n However, he wasn\u0027t struck senseless. In fact, in that moment, he was suddenly filled with a sense of impending danger!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1056","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
