I am the Immortal!” The ten stars on the forehead of the Heavenly God giant exploded, seriously injuring Meng Hao. However, the result was that the giant’s body was completely withered up. As Allheaven gave up on that body, he shrank down rapidly, and at the same time, an intense Immortal qi exploded out from his chest!\n As the Immortal qi erupted out, two hands suddenly burst out from inside the giant’s chest, sending chunks of flesh and blood flying in all directions.\n A ripping sound could be heard as the giant\u0027s chest was torn open, allowing even more Immortal qi to pour out.\n The incredible nature of the Immortal qi spread out, creating something from nothing as numerous amounts of Immortal jade suddenly appeared in the destroyed starry sky.\n The Immortal jade glittered with radiant light, and despite the intense level of the fighting, the sight of it provoked a look of shock from Meng Hao. Then he subconsciously licked his lips.\n “What a brazen strategy!” he thought. “And effective.” It took supreme effort, but he managed to restore his composure after seeing the mounds of Immortal jade.\n At the same time, a figure emerged from within the giant’s chest. Surrounded by vast quantities of Immortal qi, it was a middle-aged man. He had no hair on his head or anywhere else on his body, and his expression was completely placid. After appearing, he waved his hand behind him, causing the Heavenly God giant to tremble and then collapse. However, instead of turning into ash, it transformed into a leather cloak!\n It was leather formed from the skin of the Heavenly God, and as it settled down onto the middle-aged man with the Immortal qi, it made him seem completely cold and ruthless.\n “I am the Immortal!” the man said softly, his eyes shining with brilliant light as he looked at Meng Hao.\n “The fact that you’ve forced Allheaven to summon me means that you are an incredible foe....” Even as his voice echoed out, the man vanished and then reappeared behind Meng Hao. Before Meng Hao could even turn around, the man had placed his hand onto Meng Hao’s back.\n A boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of Meng Hao’s mouth. And yet, his eyes flickered with a vicious light, and his left hand shot up to grab the man’s wrist.\n “You’re not the Immortal!” Meng Hao growled. A surprised frown appeared on the man’s face as Meng Hao jerked his hand out, sending the man tumbling through the air. At the same time, Meng Hao began to fly toward him. His right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and without any hesitation or pause, he pushed his hand down onto the man.\n “Sixth Hex, Life-Death Hexing. This Hex doesn\u0027t affect your freedom, it merely decides whether you live or die!”\n Rumbling sounds could be heard as the Immortal qi surrounding the man suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was off in another direction. At the same time, Meng Hao’s Sixth Hex appeared to have done nothing.\n “One Hexing magic isn’t enough,” said the man. “Why don’t you use your Seventh Hex....?” His eyes shone with a strange light; he was clearly using augury to analyze the situation. The truth was that Allheaven really did want to fully analyze all of Meng Hao’s Hexing magic. Although he had witnessed them in the past, he had never personally experienced them.\n Only by doing so could his true form fully prepare to crush Meng Hao in battle.\n “If you want to see what my Hexing magics look like now that I’ve Transcended, you’ll have to show me some more of your transformations.” Meng Hao’s eyes flickered. Actually, his plans for this battle were similar to Allheaven’s. Allheaven wanted to observe his Hexing magic, but he wanted to test out all of the various Allheaven Transformations.\n “I refuse to believe that your Allheaven Transformations can be augmented limitlessly,” Meng Hao said coldly. “After all, this is your clone, not your true form. There are probably some high level transformations that you can’t even use here.”\n The man with the Immortal qi gave a cold harrumph. The Immortal qi swirling around him began to grow more powerful, and his eyes grew sharper than ever. “Fine. You want to see? I’ll show you. I’ll show you... exactly what the Immortal really is!\n “The Immortal is a man and a mountain!” [1. It’s been awhile since this explanation of the character Immortal came up. As a quick refresher, Immortal is 仙. The character for man or person is 人 and mountain is 山. If you squeeze the 人 off to side, it looks like this: 亻， which you can combine with mountain 山 to make Immortal 仙] This Immortal version of Allheaven raised both hands up over his head so that they formed the shape of a mountain peak.\n “Mountain!” he roared. Instantly, the starry sky of the Vast Expanse began to tremble as a power began to descend from outside of the Vast Expanse. Everything trembled; planets, land masses, and worlds all creaked under the pressure.\n Meng Hao could sense the power pushing him down, as though countless worlds were crushing down onto him.\n At the same time, the outline of a mountain appeared noiselessly above the head of Allheaven’s clone. It was merely an outline, but it was filled with boundless pressure that seemed to lend an air of perfection to Allheaven.\n The Immortal was a man and a mountain!\n “Immortal magic is actually not a divine ability or a magical technique. Instead, it comes from Essence. It is... crushing pressure!\n “From ancient times until now, the appearance of the Immortal signifies pressure that can crush anything not Immortal!\n “Meng Hao, you said you want to see my transformations. Well, I’ll demonstrate by crushing you!” This Immortal form of Allheaven looked at Meng Hao with flickering eyes. Then, he pushed his hands out, causing the mountain to fly toward Meng Hao at top speed, emanating intense pressure.\n It was a dazzling energy that could crush anything and everything!\n The Immortal version of Allheaven flickered, suddenly appearing on top of the peak of the mountain as it rumbled down toward Meng Hao.\n Meng Hao looked up at the descending mountain, and could sense the terrifying pressure coming from it, something that vastly exceeded the power of the Heavenly God. The Heavenly God could injure Meng Hao, and even crush his bones. However, it couldn’t harm his deepest foundation. On the other hand, the power crushing down on him from this Immortal mountain caused even his Dao Essence to tremble.\n “A man, and a mountain. That’s the Immortal...\n “Fine. Since you’re revealing the Immortal, then the time has come for me to show you my Hexing magic combination!” Eyes filled with ultimate determination, Meng Hao waved his sleeve, performing an incantation gesture which caused his cultivation base to erupt with power. Then, Hexing magic towered up.\n First Hex!\n Second Hex!\n Third Hex!\n Fourth Hex!\n Fifth Hex!\n Sixth Hex!\n Six Hexes all combined!\n The combined power of the Hexing magics unleashed a paramount power, the power of the League of Demon Sealers, the power to seal Heaven and Earth, the power to seal everything which existed. Six Hexing magics combined into one, transforming into a gigantic hand.\n That hand only had four fingers, but burst with unheard-of, shocking power. Without the slightest pause, the hand rose up to meet the man and the mountain, to kill the Immortal!\n Chapter 1584: Six Hexes Combined!\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1584","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
