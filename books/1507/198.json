One by one, they began to speak, their eyes shining with unprecedented brightness.\\n\\n “That’s… that’s definitely the power of one of the three great classic scriptures. That golden glow… it’s a sign of the Sublime Spirit Scripture!!”\\n\\n “That kid cultivates with the Sublime Spirit Scripture. That scripture has supposedly been lost for years. There are only fragments left. How did this kid get the whole scripture!?!?”\\n\\n “From the looks of it, he acquired the Qi Condensation Manual of the Sublime Spirit Scripture. Supposedly, it appeared a few hundred years ago in the State of Zhao, and was used by a man named Patriarch Reliance. His Cultivation base was unfathomable….”\\n\\n Their eyes were on Meng Hao, but what they were really paying attention to was the Sublime Spirit Scripture!!\\n\\n Each and every one of them could crush Meng Hao between their fingers like he was nothing; he wouldn’t be able to fight back in the least. Whichever one of them got their hands on Meng Hao, would actually be acquiring the Sublime Spirit Scripture.\\n\\n Such a text would be indescribably useful to any Sect. Whoever acquired it would be in the position to sweep across the Southern Domain with impunity.\\n\\n That Sect would become incomparable, and would without fail become the overlord of the Southern Domain!\\n\\n How could these Nascent Soul Cultivators not be excited? Even if Meng Hao succeeded in becoming a son-in-law of the Song Clan, they would still no doubt crazily pursue him regardless of anything!\\n\\n In any case, Meng Hao currently was not a member of the Song Clan, and was only one participant among many.\\n\\n It wasn’t appropriate to make a move at the moment, but once Meng Hao emerged, all of the Sects and Clans in the Southern Domain would want to grab him. In such an event, his life wouldn’t be important. To get the Sublime Spirit Scripture, there wasn’t a single Nascent Soul Cultivator who would hesitate to use Soulsearch on Meng Hao to drag out the Sublime Spirit Scripture.\\n\\n The result of such a Soulsearch would kill him!\\n\\n As soon as the Sublime Spirit Scripture appeared, Meng Hao instantly became the prey of all of these super Sects of the Southern Domain!\\n\\n It was obvious what everyone was thinking. The Nascent Soul Cultivators’ eyes glittered. This was the Song Clan, but sooner or later, someone would make a move. They all glanced over at the Song Clan Patriarch.\\n\\n Meng Hao had openly revealed his secret of possessing the Sublime Spirit Scripture. It would without fail arouse the lust of any Sect or Clan. However, in terms of positioning, the Song Clan currently had the clear advantage.\\n\\n As the Nascent Soul Cultivators looked over at the Song Clan Patriarch, they discreetly retrieved transmission jade slips and crushed them between their fingers. This instantly sent notifications back to their various Sects and Clans.\\n\\n Eccentric Song watched the scene in shock. The rest of the Song Clan members all seem to be in shock. Patriarch Song Tian suddenly stood up. His eyes shone mysteriously, and he was breathing heavily. However, he then recalled what had happened within the Clan earlier, along with the warning transmitted by the Dao Reserve Patriarch, and his eyes filled with determination.\\n\\n “This Meng Hao…” he said, “must not be provoked! Whoever causes problems for him is seeking death!” He flicked his sleeve. “Ladies and gentlemen, you are in the Song Clan!” His words echoed out like thunder, causing the faces of the Nascent Soul Cultivators to tighten. Blood seeped out of the corners of their mouths. Their eyes glistened with fear as they stared at the Song Clan Patriarch.\\n\\n “Regardless of what objectives you might have, this is the Song Clan’s search for a son-in-law,” he said, his eyes shining. “Whoever succeeds will become a son-in-law of the Song Clan. Once everyone emerges, there will be time for your greed. However, if Meng Hao becomes the son-in-law of the Song Clan, then it must be viewed as the will of the Heavens.”\\n\\n “Elder Song, we will naturally comply with your words,” said the Nascent Soul Cultivator from the Black Sieve Sect, smiling.\\n\\n The rest of the Nascent Soul Cultivators all agreed slowly, pretending not to pay any attention to Meng Hao. However, in their hearts, they were preparing for the arrival of fellow Sect members.\\n\\n Patriarch Song Tian was of course well aware of that. He sighed inwardly and said nothing more, continuing to gaze at the golden world within the cloud vortex.\\n\\n Magical symbols appeared in the golden glow that spread out from Meng Hao. This was none other than the Sublime Spirit Scripture.\\n\\n Observers would be able to make out the details of the magical symbols, but would be unable to commit them to memory. The only thing they would be able to remember would be a blur.\\n\\n In the Southern Domain, there are three classic scriptures. Only one of them emits a golden glow… the Sublime Spirit Scripture!\\n\\n There were no records of the origin of the scripture, or of who created it. There were many legends, though. One stated that it had been created by an eminently powerful Cultivator of the Dao Seeking stage who had walked the path of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.\\n\\n However, such a matter seemed too monumental. As such, many people refused to believe such a legend.\\n\\n Regardless, each of the seven manuals of the Sublime Spirit Scripture could be considered precious treasures. In fact, the reason that the Violet Fate Sect became one of the great Sects was because it had acquired a fragment of the Foundation Establishment manual of the Sublime Spirit Scripture.\\n\\n Just a fragment of one of the manuals could give birth to a great Sect; this alone demonstrates the boundlessness of the Sublime Spirit Scripture!\\n\\n Practicing the Cultivation of the Sublime Spirit Scripture would eventually cause the body to reach the point where it would emit magical scriptures. This is a special state, and a special sign!\\n\\n Such a state could only be reached after nine Dao Pillars had been formed. Then it would become visible. However, because Meng Hao had a Perfect Foundation, he was in a unique position with his Five Dao Pillars. That was why the sign made itself visible now.\\n\\n Of course, this turn of events exceeded Meng Hao’s powers of anticipation and caught him completely unawares. His heart instantly filled with vigilance, and he immediately pulled out the good luck charm and prepared it for activation.\\n\\n As the scripture floated out from his body and the golden glow filled the entire world, the Chosen from the various Sects looked up at him in astonishment and shock.\\n\\n Fatty gasped and began to mutter to himself. “That’s Meng Hao for you. He was awesome in the Reliance Sect. Then he came to the Southern Domain and seduced Chu Yuyan. Now he’s showing off even more power….”\\n\\n Wang Youcai stared wordlessly at the golden light. Inside, similar waves of admiration filled his heart.\\n\\n As for Wang Tengfei, he felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His body shook. A sense of unwillingness wanted to rise up within him, and yet he was forced to admit that Meng Hao… was no longer someone he could afford to look down upon.\\n\\n In fact, fear began to well up in Wang Tengfei’s heart; not even ten years had passed since they last met. After another ten years, how much further would Meng Hao have surpassed him? Wang Tengfei didn’t even dare to think about what would occur if one day, he himself was still in the Foundation Establishment stage, but Meng Hao reached Core Formation. If they met again at that time, what would happen…?\\n\\n The stir caused by what was happening now far exceeded the recent spectacle created by Meng Hao when he had climbed the tree.\\n\\n He panted as intense booming sounds filled his body. They far exceeded the roaring he had experienced when he created his fourth Dao Pillar in the Xiao Clan, so much so that Meng Hao’s heart shook and his flesh leaped.\\n\\n He felt his fifth Dao Pillar being completed. After the space of a few breaths passed, his head suddenly resounded with an enormous roar. Finally, his fifth Dao Pillar appeared in full!!\\n\\n His fifth Perfect Dao Pillar!\\n\\n With this fifth Dao Pillar, his Cultivation base rocketed to new heights. Blinding golden light shined out from him, and the magical symbols of the Sublime Spirit Scripture revolved around him in circles. They seemed as if they were prostrating themselves toward Meng Hao.\\n\\n Every breath he took caused the symbols to flutter. Every blink of his eye caused the golden light to shine even more blindingly. His Cultivation base rose higher and his battle prowess soared. Meng Hao was transforming in an unprecedented fashion!!\\n\\n Suddenly, Tribulation clouds appeared in the mountains of the Song Clan, and they lingered for some time before dissipating.\\n\\n Meng Hao’s long hair floated about him, and his body filled with an indescribable might. As the roaring continued to echo out, his heart began to thump. He took a deep breath as he allowed all the feelings to wash over him. The explosive growth of his Cultivation base caused his battle might to far exceed his previous pinnacle.\\n\\n Meng Hao was now convinced that at the moment, he could easily sweep across the entire Foundation Establishment stage. Regardless of Chosen or Dao Children, all of them were beneath him. He had a Perfect Foundation and five Dao Pillars; he was invincible within the Foundation Establishment stage!!\\n\\n In front of him, all Foundations except for Flawless Foundations, could be crushed by his Perfect Foundation.\\n\\n At the same time, however, a profound sense of danger welled up within him. He knew that everyone outside was watching him. The scripture symbols which were floating around him were obviously from the Sublime Spirit Scripture.\\n\\n Despite the feeling of danger, determination filled Meng Hao’s eyes. Fingering the good luck symbol, he leaped forward. This place was already devoid of spiritual energy, so he shot forward toward the treetop, surrounded by the golden glow.\\n\\n “So far no one has come down after me. There’s definitely not much time left….” Meng Hao was nervous, but also wasn’t willing to leave quite yet. His goal, the Cubic Pearl, was still there for the taking. Then he could escape with the good luck charm.\\n\\n “If the charm could get me out of the ancient Blessed Land, then this place will naturally be no problem either!” The good luck charm needed time to prepare, so at the same time as he poured power from his Cultivation base into it, he shot upward. Utilizing the strength of his five Perfect Dao Pillars, he shot past the final three thousand meters to arrive at the empty treetop.\\n\\n The gray-robed old man stood there. The nine paths in front of him had been affected by the golden glow, and now appeared to be paths of gold.\\n\\n This was Meng Hao’s third time standing here. His eyes glowed brightly. The time had come to make his final choice. The choice he made… was one that only Meng Hao could make!!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-198","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
