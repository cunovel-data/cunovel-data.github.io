{"id":52814,"no":489,"title":"Chapter 486: Leave None Alive!","content":"\n Chapter 486: Leave None Alive!\n The Ji Clan Blood Clone shot in pursuit of the two great totemic Sacred Ancients. The Sacred Ancients cut sorry figures as they frantically fled. The morale of the Five Poisons Tribe had been severely damaged.\n At the same time, Meng Hao’s 40,000 neo-demons roared as they absorbed the thick Demonic Qi coming from Meng Hao. All of them began to mutate, growing fiercer as they screamed through the air toward the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators.\n Suddenly, more than a thousand corpses on the ground suddenly rose to their feet. Upon the head of each of these corpses, an illusory crow could be seen. These crow automatons’ eyes glowed with gray light as they suddenly flew up into the battle.\n Booms echoed out as a deadly battle ensued between the two groups of neo-demons. The battle was once again being fought at a fever pitch.\n The vast majority of the thousands of Crow Divinity Tribe members were wounded, but it didn’t matter. Eyes red, they charged forward with madness. Regardless of whether they were original members of the five Crow Divinity Tribes, or new members who had pledged allegiance in the past two years,each and every one exerted all the Cultivation base power they could muster. They knew… whichever side lost this battle would have no survivors!\n There would be no opportunity for surrender in this fight. Regardless of Five Poisons Tribe or Crow Divinity Tribe, both were destined to be arch enemies. Whichever of these two Tribes lost the battle… would be completely wiped out!\n This was an extermination!\n Complete and utter extermination!\n As the slaughter continued, Meng Hao went into action. The killing intent in his heart ran deep. The seal that had been placed in just now would have been incredibly difficult to break out of unless he just so happened to have the Blood Immortal magic and the two drops of Ji Clan Soul Blood. The Five Poisons Tribe had planned to wipe out the Crow Divinity Tribe, and as such, the desire to kill that Meng Hao felt right now had reached a pinnacle.\n Leave none alive!\n Accept no surrender!\n His eyes glinted with a cold glow as he shot forward toward the peak level fighters of the Five Poisons Tribe, the Nascent Soul Priests. His speed was incredible as he transformed into a black moon and then a green smoke.\n The Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather’s face was pale white. The fact that Meng Hao had extricated himself had slammed into his heart and mind like an iron hammer. Then, there was the terrifying appearance of the blood-colored figure, which had in a scant moment sucked dry one of the Five Poisons Tribe’s totemic Sacred Ancients. All of these things were stupefying, and transformed into an intense figurative attack that caused all of the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators to grow pale in the face.\n “Today… will decide if the Tribe survives or perishes….” The Greatfather gave a bitter laugh. Then, his eyes filled with reckless abandon. He glared at Meng Hao and then ignited his Cultivation base. The intrepid aura of a late Nascent Soul Cultivation base exploded out as he charged toward Meng Hao.\n The High Priest’s eyes flickered with coldness as he joined the Greatfather to attack Meng Hao.\n A massive roaring could be heard as the three people prepared to slam into each other. Meng Hao, in the shape of a black moon, shot forward in a green smoke, passing directly between the Greatfather and the High Priest. He moved so fast that the two other Cultivators’ faces filled with shock.\n “So fast!!” Their eyes went wide as they suddenly looked over their shoulders. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard from not too far away. It was one of the Five Poisons Tribe’s ordinary Priests. With his Cultivation base at the early Nascent Soul stage, he would normally be able to lord it over others. However, Meng Hao only needed to use the first form of the Blood Immortal divine abilities to cause the man to explode, killing him instantly.\n “That was the first!” Meng Hao said coolly. He waved his arm, causing the fragments of blood and gore in front of him to fly away. He gave a cold look toward the Greatfather and High Priest, who glared back. They instantly pointed out toward Meng Hao, causing a five-colored mist to fly toward Meng Hao and surround him.\n A mocking smile appeared on Meng Hao’s mouth as the mist enveloped him. Suddenly, a miserable scream could be heard. Meng Hao had suddenly disappeared and then reappeared in front of another of the Priests. His hand currently gripped the man’s neck. He lifted him up and then crushed his throat.\n A boom could be heard as flesh and blood flew out in all directions. Meng Hao disappeared, but just before he did, his cold voice echoed out.\n “That was the second!”\n The Five Poisons Tribe High Priest lifted his head and howled. His face distorted as he performed a double-handed incantation and then gestured forward. A five-colored glow to spread out in all directions. Suddenly, ripples began to emanate out from Meng Hao, who was just about to disappear into the air.\n “There won’t be a third!” cried the High Priest, intense killing intent emanating out from him as he shot forward toward Meng Hao.\n It was at this point that suddenly, a shocking roar of despair filled the sky. The voice belonged to none other than one of the Five Poisons Tribe’s Sacred Ancients.\n The sound of the cry was miserable; it contained the fear and astonishment felt by the totemic Sacred ancient in the moments before death. Onlookers could just barely make out the figure of an enormous toad in the midst of a red light. Its body withered as all of its life force was sucked away.\n Simultaneously, a large number of Five Poisons Tribe members suddenly began to tremble and cough up blood. Hopelessness shone in their eyes.\n Despairing cries rose up from the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators.\n “The toad Sacred Ancient… perished….”\n “Of the five Sacred Ancients of the Five Poisons Tribe, two were sealed and two have perished. Only the centipede Sacred Ancient is left…. But it is currently being pursued….”\n “Could it be that the Heavens wish for the Five Poisons Tribe to be destroyed…?”\n The fighting did not stop. However, the weakened position of the Five Poisons Tribe grew even more severe.\n The Priests near Meng Hao were all coughing up blood, and were unable to continue to prevent their Cultivation bases from falling. As for the High Priest who was charging Meng Hao, his body trembled, and he too coughed up blood.\n Even as he was coughing up blood, Meng Hao suddenly appeared directly behind him, eyes glittering with killing intent. He formed a fist and punched.\n A boom rattled out as at this critical moment, the High Priest’s body twisted, and a black mist shot out to cover him. Meng Hao’s fist slammed into the black mist, not shattering it, but causing cracks to appear on its surface. It quickly reformed, condensing down into the image of the High Priest, his face pale. He coughed up another mouthful of blood, and his eyes filled with fury.\n “Meng Hao!!” he roared. Even as he did, the eyes of the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather went completely bloodshot. Filled with madness, he exploded toward Meng Hao with all the power he could muster.\n Meng Hao gave a cold snort. He ceased pursuing the High Priest, transforming into a black moon and a green smoke as he suddenly shot off into the distance.\n His speed was such that neither the Greatfather nor the High Priest could possibly match up. Hearts boiling with rage, they followed after him. However, it was at this point that a third bloodcurdling scream filled the air. Then a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth.\n The surrounding early Nascent Soul stage Priests were simply not a match for Meng Hao. They didn’t even qualify to try to fight back against him as he slaughtered them. In a moment, he had destroyed them as easily as crushing dried weeds or rotten branches.\n “The third!”\n “The fourth!”\n “The fifth and the sixth!” Every time he killed a Priest, Meng Hao’s cold voice could be heard echoing across the battlefield. The Cultivators of the Five Poisons Tribe had faces completely drained of blood and filled with increasingly intense despair. Many of them were even beginning to flee. On the other hand, every time Meng Hao called out, the Crow Divinity Tribe Cultivators grew more inspired. The slaughter was monstrous.\n “Meng Hao!!” roared the High Priest. “You’re a Grand Dragoneer, how can your Cultivation base be so profound!?\" In his anxiousness, the High Priest didn’t even take the time to think about what he was saying. \"As the Sacred Ancient of the Crow Divinity Tribe, you have a high status. Don’t you think that killing early Nascent Soul stage Priests is a huge loss of face for you!?”\n “Nope,” replied Meng Hao. His body flickered and he suddenly appeared next to another Nascent Soul Priest. The shocked man actually decided to self-detonate, but before he could, the first two fingers of Meng Hao’s right hand pointed out as he used the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex. Its power instantly sealed the man’s Cultivation base and preventing him from self-detonating. Meng Hao’s fingers stabbed into the man’s forehead, instantly smashing the man’s Cultivation base.\n “Meng Hao!” shouted the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather. “Do you dare to fight one-on-one with me!?!?” The man’s heart was filled with anxiety, but Meng Hao’s speed was such that he was completely incapable of catching up.\n The rest of the Nascent Soul Priests were currently fleeing, but their speed couldn’t possibly match up to Meng Hao’s. He was already fast to begin with, but now that he possessed Yi Chenzi’s escape art, his speed was increased to a terrifying level.\n It was at this moment that, off in the distance, another bloodcurdling scream could be heard echoing out, shaking everything. Suddenly, an enormous centipede could be seen writhing up above in the midst of a red glow. A red light passed through the creature’s body, sucking away all of its life force. The centipede’s body went stiff and its scream was suddenly cut off.\n The Five Poisons Tribe’s centipede Sacred Ancient, the last of the totems, had been destroyed!\n All of the Five Poisons Tribe’s totems disappeared as if they had been directly erased. There… was not even one left!\n “Sacred Ancient!!”\n “My Cultivation base…. The exalted Sacred Ancients are all dead. The Five Poisons Tribe is dying….”\n All of the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators coughed up blood. Their bodies sagged as all of their Cultivation bases sank downward. Core Formation became Foundation Establishment! Foundation Establishment became Qi Condensation!\n They let out howls of despair. What they felt now was a feeling that the original Crow Divinity Tribe members were deeply familiar with. However, back when that happened, Meng Hao was there, and became their new totemic Sacred Ancient. Right now, the Five Poisons Tribe… had nothing like that to rely on.\n The remaining five or six Nascent Soul Priests were locked in combat with the Crow Divinity Nascent Soul Elders. Their faces were pale; they could do nothing to prevent their Cultivation bases from wasting away. In the blink of an eye, they were no longer of the Nascent Soul stage, but rather, had become Core Formation Cultivators.\n The instant their Cultivation bases dropped to Core Formation… in the blink of an eye, their bodies shook. If it wasn’t a head lopped off, it was a body exploded. All of them were slaughtered in an instant by the Crow Divinity Tribe Nascent Soul Elders.\n The massacre continued as the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators’ Cultivation bases shot downward.\n As of now, the only Nascent Soul Cultivators that remained in the Five Poisons Tribe were the High Priest and the Greatfather. However, even they were forced to pay a steep price because of the death of the totemic Sacred Ancients.\n Their Cultivation bases declined; they were no longer in the late Nascent Soul stage, but rather the mid stage. From the look of the situation, they wouldn’t be able to stay there long. The decline would continue until they reached the early Nascent Soul stage.\n The green smoke suddenly congealed into Meng Hao. He put on the blood-colored mask and then turned around to face the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather and High Priest.\n “Did you just say you wanted to fight me?” he asked coolly.\n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-486","bookId":1507,"book":{"id":1507,"title":"I Shall Seal the Heavens","description":"I Shall Seal the Heavens is the story of the young scholar Meng Hao, who gets forcibly recruited into a sect of immortal cultivators.
