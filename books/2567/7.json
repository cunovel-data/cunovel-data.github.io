Three times between eleven-thirty last night and six this morning. My oh my. It’s like being eighteen again.”\\n\\n “I wanted you to know that I’ll be thinking of this morning for the rest of the day. Bye-bye,” she said, and disconnected.\\n\\n As he drove, Crow’s grin was brighter than the sun that now shone above the distant waving fields of corn.\\n\\n 4\\n\\n In his dreams he was always Iron Mike Sweeney, the Enemy of Evil. In dreams he wasn’t fourteen—he was fully grown and packed with muscle head to toe. No one could possibly stand up to him, and no one dared attack him. He was the agent of Order pitted eternally against the nefarious forces of Chaos. He was the quiet stranger who came to troubled towns and brought rough justice with his lightning fists, flashing feet, and cleverly disguised array of ultra-high-tech weaponry. He was the immortal Soldier of Light who carried the torch of reason and understanding through the growing and malevolent shadows of night. Demons fled before him; vampires would wither into noxious clouds of dust as he turned his Solar Gaze on them. The androids of the Dark Order, powerful as they were, could never match the thunderstorm power in his hard-knuckled hands. Iron Mike was the single most powerful warrior this old world had ever seen.\\n\\n Even now the Enemy of Evil was holding the Bridge of Gelderhaus against the forces of Prince Viktor and his slavering band of genetic freaks, each of them armed with laser swords and shock-rods.\\n\\n The battle had raged all night but Iron Mike Sweeney was not tired. His sword arm was as strong and steady as it had been when he drew his titanium rune-blade and braced himself, legs wide, at the mouth of the bridge while behind him the citizens of Gelderhaus cowered. Wave after wave of the genetic Warhounds had come charging him, but time and again Iron Mike’s unbreakable sword had smashed them down and beaten them back. The gorge far below the bridge was choked with their corpses and the river ran red with their radioactive blood.\\n\\n Now the Warhounds had fallen back and Prince Viktor himself was striding across the bridge, his sword Deathpall in his gauntleted hand. He stopped, just out of sword’s reach, his eyes blazing with hatred, his mouth trembling with frustrated rage.\\n\\n “You shall not pass!” roared Iron Mike Sweeney in a voice that echoed from the walls on both sides of the gorge.\\n\\n Hissing with fury, Prince Viktor raised his sword and cried—\\n\\n “—get the fuck out of bed now or do you want me to come up there?”\\n\\n The roar jolted Mike out of the dream and his body was obeying before his mind could even process what was going on.\\n\\n “Do you fucking hear me?”\\n\\n Mike was on his feet and he hurried to his bedroom door and pulled it open, crying, “I’m up, I’m up!”\\n\\n At the foot of the stairs Vic Wingate—Mike’s stepfather—stood with a foot on the first step, his hard right hand gripping the banister. “You deaf or something? I have to call you three times before you even bother to acknowledge my existence? What am I—the fucking maid?”\\n\\n Mike had to head this off at the pass before Vic really got worked up. Though morning beatings weren’t usually Vic’s thing, it didn’t take a whole lot to set him off.\\n\\n “Sorry, Vic, I was on the toilet with the door closed.”\\n\\n Vic looked up at him for a moment and the anger gradually turned to a nasty smirk. “Yeah, that figures…I always figured you were full of shit. Well, get your ass down here and have your breakfast. I don’t want to hear about you being late for school.”\\n\\n “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n “You have papers after school?”\\n\\n “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n “Well, get them done and get home. Don’t be late.” He leaned on those last three words.\\n\\n “I won’t.”\\n\\n Vic gave him a last perfunctory glare and marched off. Relieved, Mike sagged back against his door frame, exhaling the stale air that was pent up in his chest.\\n\\n Downstairs he heard Vic yelling something at Mike’s mother, and then the door slamming as he left for work. Vic was the chief mechanic at Shanahan’s Garage in town and he was never later for work even though it didn’t matter what time he got there. Like most people, Shanahan was afraid of Vic and wouldn’t have dared risk pissing him off any more than Mike would.\\n\\n “Eat shit and die,” Mike whispered to the closed door downstairs.\\n\\n “Honey?” his mother’s voice called. It wasn’t seven o’clock yet and she already sounded half in the bag. Or maybe she hadn’t sobered up from last night. “Breakfast is on the table.”\\n\\n “Yeah, I’m coming.” Breakfast would be a box of cereal and some orange juice. Mike went and sat down on the edge of the bed, fingers knotted together, shoulders hunched, staring at the patterns of sunlight on the gray indoor-outdoor carpet on his floor. He tried to remember his dream—something about a bridge—but it was gone. “Just another day,” he said aloud. He said it nearly every morning, usually in the same way, with the same total lack of enthusiasm.\\n\\n This time, however, he was wrong.\\n\\n 5\\n\\n Tow-Truck Eddie always started his day on his knees. As soon as he got out of bed, even if he had to go to the bathroom, he first dropped onto his knees, right on the cold wood floor, and prayed. He had a number of required prayers he had to say before he could start speaking directly to God, and he recited the Lord’s Prayer precisely fourteen times, which was twice seven—the number of God that was superior to six, the number of the Beast—and then said a rosary, a dozen Hail Marys. He crossed himself seven times, and then laid his head on the floor, his heavy brow pressed against the floorboards, until he heard the voice of God in his head.\\n\\n Sometimes it would take an hour or more before God spoke to him, and by then his bladder would be screaming at him, but lately—just in the last few weeks—God spoke to him more quickly. Tow-Truck Eddie knew that this was a very good sign, and he suspected that it meant that God would soon be revealing his Holy Mission to him.\\n\\n This morning his head had barely touched the cool wood when God’s voice thundered in his brain.\\n\\n Today, my child! it said. The Voice of God was almost too loud to bear and Eddie’s head rang with it.\\n\\n “Yes, my Lord. I am thy instrument. Command me to the holy purpose.”\\n\\n You are my faithful servant, God said, and you are my holy instrument on earth. Do you know this?\\n\\n “Yes, my Lord.”\\n\\n You are the enemy of the Beast. Do you know this?\\n\\n “Yes, my Lord.”\\n\\n You are the Hand of Righteousness. Do you know this?\\n\\n “Yes, my Lord.”\\n\\n You are the Sword of God. Do you know this?\\n\\n “Oh, yes, my Lord!”\\n\\n When the Hand of Righteousness beholds the Beast, what is thy holy purpose?\\n\\n “To destroy him, my Lord! I am the servant of God!”\\n\\n And if the Beast should take another form?\\n\\n “Satan is the Father of Lies. The Beast is the Father of Lies. With God as my Lord I shall see through his disguise and know the Beast—and knowing him I will destroy him, for such is the will of God.”\\n\\n And if the Beast were to appear as an ordinary man?\\n\\n “I would destroy him, for the Beast is the Father of Lies. Such is the will of God.”\\n\\n And if the Beast were to appear as a woman?\\n\\n “I would destroy him, for the Beast is the Father of Lies. Such is the will of God.”\\n\\n And if the Beast were to appear as a child?\\n\\n “I would destroy him, for the Beast is the Father of Lies. Such is the will of God.” This was an old litany between them, and only once, in the very beginning, had Tow-Truck Eddie hesitated—just for a moment—at this point, but not today. Now his voice was strong, filled with clarity and purpose.\\n\\n And to this holy purpose do you dedicate yourself?\\n\\n “I am the instrument of the Lord and his will is as my own. With my body, my heart, and my immortal soul shall I serve the will of the Lord.”\\n\\n In my servant I am well pleased.\\n\\n Gratitude flooded through Eddie and he wept, his head still pressed to the floor.\\n\\n See this face. This is the face of the Beast that was.\\n\\n A man’s face appeared in Eddie’s mind—a thin black man with blood on his clothes. Eddie knew him at once. This was the face that the Beast had worn thirty years ago—the face he’d worn when he had cut a bloody swatch through the town. Eddie knew that face, had confronted him and had given him a chance to confess his evils, but the man had lied again—the Beast is the Father of Lies—and Eddie had struck him down. Other men had been there to help, but Eddie had struck the most telling blow. The killing blow.\\n\\n The Beast has returned and wears a new face.\\n\\n Eddie jumped. Always before the litany had ended at this point, but this was new and his flush of gratitude changed, becoming an immediate charge of thrilling electricity. God’s voice was filled with rage and Eddie trembled.\\n\\n This then is the new face of the Beast. Look upon the face of the Beast and behold his deceptions.\\n\\n Tow-Truck Eddie raised his face an inch, two inches, then a foot, and stared into the empty air. Instantly there was an image there—not floating in the air or described in the grain of the boards—but burning in his mind. A figure, slight and shabby, in jeans and a baggy windbreaker. It was a young person, a boy of no more than thirteen or fourteen, with curly red hair and pale skin and dark blue eyes. He was riding a bicycle along the black wavering length of a road that Eddie knew only too well. A-32.\\n\\n Behold the Beast! roared the voice of God with such thunder that Eddie’s nose began to bleed.\\n\\n Eddie pawed the blood away, wiping it on his thigh as he stared at the image in his mind.\\n\\n “I am the Sword of God,” he croaked through the agony in his skull. “I am the instrument of the Lord and his will is as my own. With my body, my heart, and my immortal soul shall I serve the will of the Lord.”\\n\\n This is your holy task…this is the mission for which you were born unto the earth.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-road-blues-pine-deep-1/page-7.html","bookId":2567,"book":{"id":2567,"title":"Ghost Road Blues (Pine Deep #1)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Road Blues (Pine Deep #1) \\n From a new master of horror comes an apocalyptic showdown between the residents of a secluded, rural town and the deadly evil that confronts them wherever they turn . . . \\n Evil Doesn\u0027t Die \\n The cozy little town of Pine Deep buried the horrors of its past a long time ago.
