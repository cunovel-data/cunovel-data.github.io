{"id":40844,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 A Long Way Down","content":"Artemis and company landed in Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport barely three hours before the dead-line in a rented Lear jet. And though Butler was a regis-tered pilot, qualified for day and night flying in various aircraft, it was Artemis who flew most of the way.\n Flying helped him think, he claimed. Also, no one would interrupt while he put the finishing touches to his auda-cious plan. Artemis was fully aware of the risks involved with this particular scheme. The pivotal element was purely theoretical and the rest was highly unlikely.\n He briefed the others on the details in the back of a rented Lexus on the forty-minute drive from the airport to downtown Taipei. The entire group looked drained, even though they had eaten and rested on the plane. Only No.l was in high spirits. Everywhere he looked there were new wonders to be gaped at, and he could not imagine that anyone would be able to injure him while he was under Butler\u0027s protection.\n \u0027The bad news is that we are running close to the dead-line,\" said Artemis. \u0027So there will be no time to set a trap.\u0027\n \u0027And the good news, Artemis?\u0027 said Holly grumpily. She was grumpy for a few reasons. She was dressed as a human girl, because Artemis had asked her to save her magic for when it would be needed. She had managed to boost her magical energy by burying a sealed acorn she kept round her neck, but there had been no full moon, so her power reserves were limited. Also she was completely shut off from the People, and to top it all she had no doubt that Ark Sool would have her up on charges if any of them did manage to survive the trade-off. After all, she had brought No.l halfway across the world instead of escort-ing him safely to Haven City.\n \u0027The good news is that Kong can\u0027t be too far ahead of us, so it is unlikely he had time to set up any traps either.\u0027\n The Lexus entered the Xinyi district, and Taipei 101 rose from the cityscape like a giant bamboo shoot. The buildings around it seemed to shrink back in awe.\n Butler craned his head back to see the top of the five-hundred-plus-metre building. \u0027We never do anything small, do we? Why can\u0027t we for once have a meeting in a Starbucks?\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t pick this building,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027It picked us. Fate has brought us here.\u0027\n He tapped Butler on the shoulder and the bodyguard pulled over into the first space he could find. It took forever. Taipei morning traffic was thick and slow-moving and spewed smoke like an irritated dragon. Many of the thousands of pedestrians and cyclists had smog masks strapped across their faces.\n When the vehicle had stopped, Artemis continued his briefing.\n \u0027Taipei 101 is a miracle of modern engineering. The architects took their inspiration from the humble bamboo. But this shape alone would not keep the skyscraper steady in the event of an earthquake or high winds, so the design-ers built it on a frame of concrete-filled steel-boxed super columns, and installed a seven-hundred tonne steel ball as a mass damper pendulum to absorb the force of the wind. Ingenious. The pendulum swings instead of the building.\n It\u0027s become quite the tourist attraction. You can even watch it from the observation deck. The owners have covered the damper with fifteen centimetres of solid silver, which has been etched by the famous Taiwanese artist Alexander Chou.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks for the fine-art lesson,\u0027 interrupted Holly. \u0027Now how about you let us in on your plan. I want to get this over with and take off this ridiculous tracksuit. It\u0027s so shiny, I feel sure I can be picked up on satellite.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t much like this outfit either,\u0027 complained No.l, who was dressed in a bonnet and an orange floral muumuu. Orange, he had decided, was definitely not for him.\n \u0027Your outfit is the least of your worries,\u0027 noted Holly. \u0027I\u0027m guessing that we\u0027re about to hand you over to a blood-thirsty hit man, eh, Artemis?\u0027\n \u0027That we are,\u0027 confirmed Artemis. \u0027But only for a few seconds. There will be little or no danger to you. And if my suspicions are correct, it is just possible that we may save Hybras.\u0027\n \u0027Go back to me being in danger for a few seconds,\u0027 said No.l, his thick brow folding in a frown. \u0027In Hybras, a few seconds can last a very long time.\u0027\n \u0027Not here,\u0027 said Artemis, in what he hoped was a re-assuring tone. \u0027Here a Jew seconds is how long it will take you to open your hand.\u0027\n No.l opened his fingers a couple of times experimen-tally. \u0027That\u0027s still pretty long. Any way to cut it down?\u0027\n \u0027Not really. If we do, it means sacrificing Minerva.\u0027\n \u0027Well, she did tie me to a chair.\u0027 No.l glanced round at the shocked faces. \u0027What? I\u0027m joking. Of course I\u0027ll do it. But no more orange. Please.\u0027\n Artemis smiled, but it did not quite reach his eyes. \u0027Very well, no more orange. Now, the plan. It is in two parts. If the first part doesn\u0027t work, then the second is redun-dant.\u0027\n \u0027Redundant,\u0027 said No.l, almost unconsciously. \u0027Not needed, superfluous.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly. So I\u0027ll explain that when necessary.\u0027\n \u0027What about the first part?\u0027 asked Holly.\n \u0027In the first part, we meet a vicious hit man and his band of thugs and he will expect us to hand over Number One.\u0027\n \u0027So what do we do?\u0027\n \u0027We hand over Number One,\u0027 said Artemis. He turned to the slightly nervous imp. \u0027How do you like the plan so far?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I don\u0027t like the first bit and I don\u0027t know the last bit. So, I\u0027m really hoping the middle bit is exceptional.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027It is.\u0027\n taipei 101\n The group took a high-speed elevator from Taipei 101\u0027s cavernous lobby to the observation floor. Holly and No.l had technically been given permission to enter the build-ing by a small plaque over the main door which simply urged visitors to come and go as they pleased. And seeing as she did not feel the urge to throw up in the elevator, Holly guessed that the plaque counted as an invitation.\n \u0027Toshiba elevators,\u0027 said Artemis, reading from a pamphlet he had picked up at information. \u0027These are the fastest elevators in the world. We are moving at eighteen metres per second, so it shouldn\u0027t take much more than half a minute to reach the eighty-ninth floor.\u0027\n Artemis consulted his watch when the doors dinged open.\n \u0027Hmm. Right on time. Impressive engineering. I may get one of these for the house.\u0027\n They stepped out into the observation area, which had a restaurant at the far end. From this lofty vantage point, visitors could walk all the way round the floor and shoot video of the panoramic view. From this height it was even possible to see China across the Taiwan Strait.\n For a moment the group forgot their worries and allowed themselves to be awestruck by the grace of this enormous structure. The sky was outside the window and blended almost seamlessly with the sea on the horizon. No.l was especially dumbfounded. He turned in small circles, the muumuu swishing round his legs.\n \u0027Less of the pirouetting, little man,\u0027 advised Butler, the first to get his mind back on the job. \u0027You\u0027re showing your legs. And pull that bonnet down over your face.\u0027\n No.l obliged, though he was not happy with the bonnet. It was shapeless and saggy, and made his head look like a bag of washing.\n \u0027Good luck, Holly,\u0027 said Artemis, into thin air. \u0027We will meet you on the twenty-third floor.\u0027\n \u0027Get this done as quickly as you can,\u0027 Holly whispered into his ear. \u0027I don\u0027t have enough magic for a long shield. I\u0027m barely invisible as it is.\u0027\n \u0027Understood,\u0027 said Artemis, from the side of his mouth.\n The small band walked slowly towards the bar area and took a table below the enormous mass damper, suspended a metre above the eighty-ninth floor. The seven-hundred tonne ball was a sight to behold, like an indoor moon, its surface etched with traditional Yuanzhumin drawings.\n \u0027This is the legend of Nian,\u0027 explained Artemis casu-ally, while Butler scanned the room. \u0027A ferocious beast that would feed on human flesh each New Year\u0027s Eve. To scare Nian away, torches were lit and firecrackers were set off, because Nian was known to fear the colour red. Thus the splashes of red paint. It seems likely from the pictures that Nian was actually a troll. Chou must have based his work on contemporary accounts.\u0027\n A waitress came to their table.\n \u0027Li ho bo,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027Can we have a pot of Oolong tea. Organic, if you have it.\u0027\n The waitress blinked at Artemis, then looked up at Butler, who was still standing.\n \u0027You are Mister Fowl?\u0027 she asked, in excellent English.\n I am Master Fowl,\u0027 said Artemis, tapping the table for attention. \u0027Do you have something for me?\u0027\n The waitress passed him a napkin.\n \u0027From the gentleman along the bar,\u0027 she said.\n Artemis glanced down the arc of the metal railing and buffer system which kept patrons away from the mass damper, and more importantly kept the mass damper away from them.\n Billy Kong was seated a dozen tables down, waggling his eyebrows in their direction. He was not alone. No one else was eyebrow-waggling, but three men were at the table with him, and several others were dotted around the bar area. Minerva was on Kong\u0027s knee. He held her fast by the forearm. Her shoulders were tense but there was defiance in the set of her mouth.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Artemis said to Butler.\n \u0027At least twelve,\u0027 replied the bodyguard. \u0027Billy must have friends in Taiwan.\u0027\n \u0027None of them invisible, thank goodness,\u0027 said Artemis, opening the napkin.\n Send the creature to the reserved table, read the message on the napkin. I will send the girl. No tricks or people will get hurt.\n He passed the napkin to Butler. \u0027What do you think?\u0027\n Butler gave the message a summary glance. \u0027I think he won\u0027t try anything here. Too many cameras. If the secur-ity doesn\u0027t get him on film, a tourist will. If Kong goes for a double-cross, it will be outside.\u0027\n \u0027And by then, it should be too late.\u0027\n \u0027So we hope.\u0027\n The waitress returned with a bamboo tray, bearing a clay pot of tea and three glasses. Artemis took his time pouring himself some of the steaming liquid.\n \u0027How are you feeling, Number One?\u0027\n \u0027My leg hurts a bit.\u0027\n \u0027The painkiller is wearing off. I\u0027ll ask Butler to give you another shot later. Are you ready to go? Everything will be fine, I assure you.\u0027\n \u0027All I have to do is open my hand?\u0027\n \u0027As soon as we\u0027re in the elevator.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s it? Do you want me to distract the bad man with some witty banter, like you do with Holly?\u0027\n \u0027No. That won\u0027t be necessary. Just open your hand.\u0027\n \u0027Should I look scared?\u0027\n \u0027That would be appropriate.\u0027\n \u0027Good. Shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u0027\n Butler was functioning in full action mode. Generally, he reined himself in, walking with a slight stoop to avoid drawing attention. But now, he stood tall and tensed, ready to spring into action. His gaze was fierce, and muscles bulged in his neck. He caught Billy Kong\u0027s gaze and zeroed in on his eyeballs. Even across a crowded room, the hostil-ity was almost palpable. A couple of more psychically sensi-tive bystanders suddenly felt anxious and cast their eyes about for the nearest restroom.\n When he was finished staring down Billy Kong, Butler knelt to give final instructions to No.l.\n \u0027All you have to do is walk down to that table with the reserved sign. Wait until Minerva gets there, then continue on to Kong. If they hustle you out straight away, count to twenty then open your hand. If they wait for us to leave, open your hand when the elevator doors have closed. Understand?\u0027\n \u0027I understand everything. In any language you care to speak in.\u0027\n \u0027Are you set?\u0027\n No.l took a deep breath. He could feel his tail vibrat-ing anxiously. He had been in a bit of a daze since the time tunnel. How could anyone take all of this in? Skyscrapers, for heaven\u0027s sake. Buildings that actually scraped the sky.\n \u0027I\u0027m set,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Off you go then. Good luck.\u0027\n No.l began his long lonely walk back into captivity. Scores of humans thronged around him, excited, sweat-ing, chewing things, pointing machines at each other.\n Those would be cameras, I suppose.\n The noon sun flashed through the ceiling-to-floor windows, catching on the silver of the mass damper, lighting it up like a disco ball. The tabletops loomed just above head height. Waiters and waitresses bustled past with loaded trays. Glasses fell, children screamed.\n Too many people, thought No.l. I miss demons. Even Abbot. Well, OK, maybe not Abbot.\n No.l reached the reserved table. He had to stand on tippy-toes to see the folded piece of card with the word printed on it. He lifted the flap on his bonnet to get a clear look. He was beginning to realize that a muumuu and bonnet were not typical Mud Child garb, as Artemis had told him.\n This is a terrible disguise. I look like a freak. Surely someone will see that I am not human. I wish I could shield, like Holly.\n Unfortunately, even if No.l could control his burgeon-ing magical powers, shielding had never been a weapon in the demon warlock arsenal.\n N°l took a step to the right, squinting past the glare of the giant mass damper. Minerva was on her way down. Taking small careful steps towards the reserved table. Behind her, Kong leaned forward in his seat, toes tapping with excitement and anticipation. He was like a dog on a leash with the scent of a fox in his nose.\n Minerva arrived. She lifted the brim of No.l\u0027s bonnet to check it was him.\n \u0027It\u0027s not my bonnet,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027And this is certainly not my muumuu.\u0027\n Minerva took his hand. Before the abduction she had been eighty per cent genius and twenty per cent twelve-year-old girl. Now it was about fifty-fifty. \u0027I\u0027m sorry for everything. For tying you up, and the rest. I thought you would try to eat me.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not all savages,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027And my wrists did hurt for ages. But I forgive you, I suppose. As long as your tying-up days are over.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. I promise.\u0027 Minerva looked over No.l\u0027s head, towards Artemis\u0027s table. \u0027Why is he helping me? Do you know?\u0027\n No.l shrugged. \u0027I\u0027m not sure. Holly, our friend, said it was something about puberty. Apparently you\u0027re pretty, though to be honest, I can\u0027t see it myself.\u0027\n Their conversation was interrupted by a whistle from further down the bar. Billy Kong was growing impatient. The ex-Paradizo employee beckoned No.l on with his index finger.\n \u0027I should go. Leave. Depart.\u0027\n Minerva nodded. \u0027OK. Be careful. I will see you soon. Where is it? In your hand?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said No.l automatically, then, \u0027How did you know?\u0027\n Minerva walked on slowly. \u0027Genius. Can\u0027t help it.\u0027\n This place is littered with genii, thought No.l. I just hope Mister Kong isn\u0027t another one.\n He continued on his way, being careful to keep his feet and hands inside the muumuu. The last thing he wanted to do was cause a panic by exposing his grey stumpy digits. Although, perhaps the humans would bow down and adore him. After all he was incredibly handsome compared to their own gangly males.\n Billy Kong was all smiles when No.l reached the table. On his face, a smile looked like the first symptom of a disease. His hair was spiked in perfect points. Even in the middle of a kidnapping, Kong still made time for hair. Good grooming says a lot about a person.\n \u0027Welcome back, demon,\u0027 he said, grabbing a hank of the muumuu. \u0027So nice to see you. If it is you…\u0027\n \u0027If it is me?\u0027 said No.l, confused. \u0027Me is all I can be.\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me, if I don\u0027t take your word for it,\u0027 snorted Kong, tugging back the bonnet\u0027s frill for a quick peek at No.l \u0027s face. \u0027If that Fowl kid is half as smart as I\u0027ve heard, then he\u0027s sure to be trying something.\u0027\n Kong examined the imp\u0027s face, poking the plate on his forehead, pulling back the lips to check the pink gums and square white teeth. Finally he traced the rune on No.l\u0027s forehead with a finger, to make sure it wasn\u0027t painted on.\n \u0027Satisfied?\u0027\n \u0027Pretty much. I guess little Artemis didn\u0027t have time to do a switch. I ran him too hard.\u0027\n \u0027You ran us all too hard,\u0027 complained No.l. \u0027We had to fly here in a machine. I saw the moon close up.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re breaking my heart, demon. After what you did to my brother, you\u0027re lucky to be alive. Something I hope to remedy in the next few minutes.\u0027\n No.l twisted his head to catch a glimpse of the eleva-tors. Artemis, Butler and Minerva were two steps away from the doors.\n \u0027Don\u0027t look at them. They can\u0027t help you. Nobody can help you.\u0027\n Kong clicked his fingers, and a muscular man joined them at the table. He was hefting a large metal suitcase.\n \u0027In case you\u0027re wondering, this is a bomb. You know what a bomb is, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Bomb,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027Explosive. Incendiary device.\u0027 His eyes widened. \u0027But that could hurt someone. A lot of some-ones.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly. Not humans though. Demons. I am going to strap this on to you, set the timer, then send you back to your island. The blast should at the very least put a big dent in the demon population. You won\u0027t be cross-ing over here for your little night-time hunts for quite a while.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t do it,\u0027 said No.l, actually stamping his foot.\n Kong laughed. \u0027Are you sure you\u0027re a demon? From what I hear, the last one was more… demonic.\u0027\n \u0027I am a demon. A warlock demon.\u0027\n Kong leaned close enough for No.l to smell his citrus aftershave. \u0027Well, little Mister Warlock, maybe you can turn this bomb into a bunch of flowers, but I doubt it.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t have to do anything, because you can\u0027t make me go back to Hybras.\u0027\n Kong took a set of handcuffs from his pocket. \u0027On the contrary. I know exactly what to do. I picked up a thing or two in the chateau. All we have to do is dig that silver slug out of your leg, and Hybras will suck you home.\u0027\n No.l glanced again towards the elevator. The doors were closing on his new friends.\n \u0027You mean this silver slug?\u0027 he asked, showing Kong what had been concealed in his hand.\n \u0027He took it out,\u0027 breathed Billy Kong. \u0027Fowl took out the slug.\u0027\n \u0027Took it out,\u0027 agreed No.l. \u0027Extracted. Removed.\u0027\n Then he dropped the silver nugget and disappeared.\n Holly had been crouched on the mass damper watching events unfold. So far, everything had gone according to plan. Minerva had reached Artemis, and Butler had hustled them both to the elevator. At the other end of the bar, Billy Kong was doing his whole grinning psycho bit. When this was all over, that Mud Man would have to be mind-wiped. There would be quite a few loose ends to clear up, actually. Not by her, though — she was not LEP any more. After this she would be lucky to be Section 8.\n Holly tapped a button on her wrist computer, zoom-ing in on No.l. The imp raised his left hand. The signal.\n This was it. Time to test theories. It was either hello again or goodbye forever.\n Artemis\u0027s plan was a risky one because his calculations were theoretical, but it was the only chance to save the demon island. And Artemis had been right so far. If Holly had to rely on someone\u0027s theories, she would prefer those theories to be Artemis Fowl\u0027s.\n As Holly watched No.l drop the silver slug and dis-appear, she could not resist snapping a photo of Kong\u0027s face with her helmet camera. His reaction was priceless. They would have a good laugh over that later.\n Then she activated her wings, rising above the giant silver ball, watching for signs.\n Seconds later, a faint blue electrical rectangle began spinning at the silver ball\u0027s crown, exactly where Artemis had known it would. No.l was coming back. Just as Artemis had predicted.\n Such a large mass of silver within three metres should inter-rupt No.1 \u0027s journey home. It should cause a momentary materi-alization at the summit, where the damper\u0027s energy field is most concentrated. You, Holly, have to be there to make sure this momentary materialization becomes more permanent.\n On the mass damper, No.1 \u0027s shape was visible inside the glowing rectangle. He seemed a little confused, as though half asleep. One arm snaked through into this world, grasp-ing at reality. It was enough for Holly. She darted down and clamped a silver bracelet round No.l \u0027s grey wrist. The ghostly fingers wiggled, then solidified. Solidity sped along No.l\u0027s arm like grey paint, rescuing him from Limbo. In seconds, where there had only been space, now crouched a shivering creature.\n \u0027Did I go?\u0027 asked the little imp. \u0027Am I back?\u0027\n \u0027Yes and yes,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Now stay quiet and still. We have to get you out of here.\u0027\n The mass damper swung slowly, dissipating the wind power buffeting Taipei 101. Holly leaned into the sway, grabbed a hold of No.l and took off vertically, careful to keep her cargo shielded by the seven-hundred-tonne silver ball.\n The next floor up was another observation floor, but it was closed for decoration. A single workman was slicing carpet for a corner section, and he did not seem surprised to see a muumuu-clad imp come sailing over the railing.\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s an imp in a muumuu. You know something, imp?\u0027\n No.l landed on the floor with a thump. \u0027No,\u0027 he said cautiously. \u0027Tell me something.\u0027\n \u0027I am not a bit surprised to see you,\u0027 said the man. \u0027In fact, you are so unremarkable, that I am going to forget all about you as soon as you\u0027ve gone.\u0027\n No.l picked himself up, straightening his bonnet. \u0027You\u0027ve had a talk with him, I see.\u0027\n Holly switched off her shield, speckling into view. \u0027I gave him a blast of the mesmer.\u0027 She peered over the rail-ing down into the restaurant. \u0027Come here, Number One. You\u0027ll enjoy this.\u0027\n No.l placed his fingers against the glass. Kong and his cronies were creating chaos below, blundering towards the elevators. Kong was particularly perturbed, barging tourists from his path and overturning tables.\n \u0027We probably don\u0027t have time for this,\u0027 said No.l.\n \u0027Probably not,\u0027 agreed Holly. Neither fairy moved.\n \u0027Hey, look,\u0027 said the workman. \u0027Another fairy. How utterly unremarkable.\u0027\n Only when the Toshiba elevator doors had closed behind Billy Kong and his crew, did Holly turn to leave.\n \u0027Where to now?\u0027 asked No.l, wiping a happy-tear from his eye.\n \u0027Now, we go to stage two,\u0027 replied Holly, calling the elevator. \u0027Time to save Hybras.\u0027\n \u0027Never a dull moment,\u0027 said No.l, scurrying into the metal box. \u0027Hey, my first cliche.\u0027\n Artemis and Butler had watched Minerva cross the restau-rant towards them. She bore herself with considerable courage under the circumstances. Her chin was up and she had a determined look in her eye.\n \u0027Butler, can I ask you something?\u0027 said Artemis.\n Butler was trying to keep an eye on every single person in the restaurant.\n \u0027I\u0027m a little busy at the moment, Artemis.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing taxing. Just a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Is it normal, during puberty, to feel these blasted feelings of attraction at stressful times? During a ransom drop, for instance.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s pretty, isn\u0027t she?\u0027\n \u0027Extremely. And funny too — remember that quark joke?\u0027\n \u0027I do. We must have a talk about jokes someday. Perhaps Minerva could sit in. And in response to your question, it is normal. The more stressful the situation, the more your body pumps out the hormones.\u0027\n \u0027Good. Normal then. Back to business.\u0027\n Minerva didn\u0027t rush. She picked her way around tourists and tables as she walked steadily towards them.\n When she drew level, Butler placed a guiding and protective hand on her back.\n \u0027Get kidnapped every day, do you?\u0027 he growled, steer-ing her to the elevator.\n Artemis followed, glancing back over his shoulder to make sure they were not being pursued. Kong was not even looking at them, so happy was he with his prize.\n The elevator opened and the trio stepped inside. On the elevator wall, the floor light was rapidly winking down-wards.\n Artemis held out his hand to Minerva. \u0027Artemis Fowl the Second. Pleased to meet you finally.\u0027\n Minerva shook the hand warmly. \u0027Minerva Paradizo.\n Likewise. You gave up your demon for me. I do appreci-ate it.\u0027 She blushed slightly.\n The elevator slowed to a smooth stop, and the steel doors slid open with barely a hiss.\n Minerva peeked out. \u0027This is not the lobby. Why aren\u0027t we leaving?\u0027\n Artemis stepped out on to the fortieth floor. \u0027Our work here is not finished.
