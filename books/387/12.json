{"id":40845,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12 Heart Of Stone","content":"taipei 101, fortieth floor, KIMSICHIOG gallery\\n\\n ARTEMIS strode through the Kimsichiog Gallery lobby, flanked by Butler and Minerva.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re in an art gallery,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027Do we really have time for art?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis halted, surprised. \u0027There\u0027s always time for art,\u0027 he said. \u0027But we\u0027re here for a very special piece of art.\u0027 \u0027Which is?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis pointed at painted silk banners hanging at regu-lar intervals from the ceiling. Each banner was emblazoned with a single dramatic spiralling rune.\\n\\n \u0027I follow what is happening in the art world. This exhi-bition is of particular interest to me. The centrepiece is the remains of a fantastic sculpture. A semicircle of strange danc-ing creatures. Maybe ten thousand years old. Believed to have been found off the shore of Ireland, and yet here it is, in Taiwan, being exhibited by an American oil company.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Artemis, why are we here? I need to get home to my father.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you recognize the rune? Haven\u0027t you seen it some-where?\u0027\\n\\n Minerva remembered immediately. \u0027Mais ouil Certainement. It is the rune from the demon\u0027s forehead. The very same.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis snapped his fingers, and continued walking.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. When I met Number One, I knew his markings were familiar. It took me a while to remember where I had seen them before, but once I knew, then it occurred to me that maybe this sculpture was not a sculpture at all.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva\u0027s brain raced ahead. \u0027It was the ring of warlocks. From the original time spell.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Precisely. What if they were not blasted into space. What if one of them had the quick thinking to use the gargoyle\u0027s touch, to turn them all to stone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if Number One is a warlock, then he is the only one who can reanimate them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very good, Minerva. You catch on quickly. Young, quick and arrogant. You remind me of someone. Who could that be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Beats me,\u0027 said Butler, rolling his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027But how did you set this up?\u0027 the French girl wondered. \u0027The meeting site was Kong\u0027s idea. I heard him on the phone.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis smiled at his own cleverness. \u0027While he was thinking about it, I said \"I\u0027ll be wearing a burgundy tie. Pay attention to that. There are a hundred and one ways this could go wrong. If it does, the police could tie one of us up for a long time.\" Do you see?\u0027\\n\\n Minerva plucked at a curl thoughtfully. \u0027Mon Dieu! You used the power of suggestion. Tie pay. A hundred and one. Tie one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or what Kong\u0027s subconscious heard: \"Taipei 101. Taiwan.\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Brilliant, Artemis. Extraordinary. And coming from me, that means something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was brilliant,\u0027 said Artemis, with characteristic lack of modesty. \u0027Allied to the fact that Kong\u0027s second home is Taiwan, I was reasonably confident that it would work.\u0027\\n\\n There was a harried-looking man at the gallery\u0027s recep-tion desk. He was dressed in a neon blue suit, and his head was completely shaven, except for a spiral of stubble in the shape of No.l\u0027s rune. He spoke in rapid Taiwanese into a Bluetooth headset clipped to his ear.\\n\\n \u0027No, no. Salmon is not good enough. Squid and lobster are what we ordered. You have them here by eight o\u0027clock, or I will come down there, slice you up and serve you as sushi instead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trouble with the caterers?\u0027 said Artemis pleasantly in Taiwanese, when the man had disconnected.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 replied the man. \u0027The exhibition is opening tonight and…\u0027\\n\\n The man stopped because he had looked up to see who he was talking to and spotted Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Well, wow. Big. I mean hello. I am Mister Lin, the cura-tor here. Can I help you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We were hoping for a private preview of the exhibi-tion,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027Specifically, the dancing figures.\u0027\\n\\n Mister Lin was so surprised he could do little more than bluster. \u0027What? A what? Private? No, no, no. Impossible, out of the question. This is important art. Look at my head. Look! I don\u0027t just do this for any old exhibition.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I realize that, but my friend here, the large one, would be extremely happy if you could let us in for a minute.\u0027\\n\\n Mister Lin opened his mouth to answer, but something down the hall caught his attention.\\n\\n \u0027What is that? Is that a muumuu?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis didn\u0027t bother to look.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. We have disguised our fairy friend as a child in a muumuu.\\n\\n Mister Lin frowned, and the spiral on his head moved. \u0027Fairy friend? Oh, really? Who are you people? Are you from Pop Art Today! Is this one of Dougie Hemler\u0027s postmodernist stunts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. He\u0027s a real fairy. A demon warlock to be precise. The one behind him, flying, is an elf.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Flying? You tell Dougie Hemler from me, that there isn\u0027t a chance in…\u0027 Then he spotted Holly hovering over No.l\u0027s head.\u0027Oh!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh!\u0027 agreed Artemis. \u0027That\u0027s a fair reaction. Now, can we go in? It\u0027s extremely important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to ruin the exhibition?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably,\u0027 Artemis admitted.\\n\\n Mister Lin\u0027s lip quivered as he spoke. \u0027Then I can\u0027t let you in.\u0027\\n\\n Holly darted forward, collapsing her helmet visor.\\n\\n \u0027I think you can let us in,\u0027 she said, her voice layered with magic. \u0027Because these three humans are your oldest friends. You invited them for a sneak preview.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what about you two?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about us. We\u0027re not even here. We\u0027re just inspiration for your next exhibition. So why don\u0027t you buzz us all in.\u0027\\n\\n Mister Lin flapped a hand at Holly. \u0027Why would I worry about you? You\u0027re not even here. Just some silly idea flying round my head. As for you three guys, I am so glad you could make it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to video us,\u0027 prompted Holly. \u0027Why don\u0027t you shut down the gallery cameras?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll just switch off the gallery cameras - give you guys a little privacy.\u0027 \u0027Good idea.\u0027\\n\\n The curator had turned his attention to the pile of posters on his desk before the security door closed behind Artemis and his group.\\n\\n The exhibition hall was ultra-modern, with dark wooden floors and slatted blinds. The walls were hung with photo-graphs — giant blow-ups of the dancing figures in the centre of the room. The figures themselves were raised on a dais, to make their detail easier to view. There were so many spotlights on them, that there was barely a shadow on the stone.\\n\\n No.l absently pulled off his bonnet, approaching the exhibit in a daze, as though he had been mesmerized and not the curator.\\n\\n He climbed on to the dais, stroking the stone skin of the first figure.\\n\\n \u0027Warlocks,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027Brothers.\u0027\\n\\n The sculpture was beautiful in its detail, and yet horrific in its subject matter. It consisted of four creatures, ranged in a broken semicircle, in the act of dancing or recoiling from something. They were small squat fairies, like No.l, with thrusting jaws, barrel chests and stumpy tails. Their bodies, limbs and foreheads were covered with swirling runes. The demons were all holding hands, and the fourth held on to the severed hand of the next in line.\\n\\n \u0027The circle was broken,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027Something went wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis climbed on to the dais beside him. \u0027Can you bring them back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bring them back?\u0027 said No.l, startled.\\n\\n \u0027From what I know of the gargoyle\u0027s touch, it can transform living things to stone, and back again. You have the touch — can you use it?\u0027\\n\\n No.l rubbed his palms nervously. \u0027I may have the touch. You know, maybe, and that\u0027s a big maybe. I turned a wooden skewer to stone, at least I think it was stone. Maybe it was just coated with ash. I was under a lot of pressure. Everybody was watching. You know how it is; maybe you don\u0027t. How many of you have even been in imp school? None, right?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis gripped his shoulder. \u0027You\u0027re babbling, Number One. You need to concentrate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Of course. Concentrate. Focus. Think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Now, see if you can bring them back. It\u0027s the only way to save Hybras.\u0027\\n\\n Holly shook her head. \u0027Way to keep the pressure off, genius.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva was circling the exhibit in a daze not unlike her former captive\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027These statues are actual demons. They have been among us all this time. I should have seen it, but Abbot looked nothing like this.\u0027\\n\\n Holly landed beside the girl, up close.\\n\\n \u0027There are entire species that you know nothing about. You almost helped to wipe out one of them. You were lucky; if that had happened, a dozen Artemis Fowls would not have been enough to rescue you from the fairy police.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see. I said sorry already. Can we move on?\u0027\\n\\n Holly frowned at her. \u0027Glad to see you\u0027ve forgiven your-self so quickly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harbouring feelings of guilt can have a negative effect on mental health.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Child geniuses,\u0027 growled Holly.\\n\\n \u0027Genii,\u0027 said Minerva.\\n\\n On the dais, No.l was laying hands on one of the petrified demons.\\n\\n \u0027So, back in Hybras. I just kind of held the skewer and got excited, then it started. I wasn\u0027t trying to turn it into stone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could you get excited now?\u0027 asked Artemis.\\n\\n \u0027What? Just like that? I don\u0027t know. I feel a bit sick, to be honest. I think the muumuu is giving me a headache. It really is bright.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe if Butler gave you a fright?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not the same thing. I need some real pressure. I know Mister Butler wouldn\u0027t actually kill me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be too sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, ha ha. You\u0027re a rum one, Artemis Fowl. I can see I\u0027m going to have to stay on my toes around you.\u0027\\n\\n Butler was checking his pistol when he heard noises in the corridor. He ran to the security door and peered out through the small rectangle of toughened glass.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve got company,\u0027 he declared, cocking his pistol. \u0027Kong found us.\u0027\\n\\n The bodyguard put a single round into the electronic lock, frying the chip and sealing the door.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not going to take them long to open that door. We need to wake up those demons and get out of here. Now!\u0027\\n\\n Artemis squeezed No.1 \u0027s shoulder, nodding at the secur-ity door.\\n\\n \u0027That enough pressure for you?\u0027\\n\\n On the other side of the security door Kong and his men were halted by the sight of a smoking keypad.\\n\\n \u0027Dammit,\u0027 swore Kong. \u0027He busted the lock. We\u0027re going to have to shoot our way in. There\u0027s no time for planning. Don, you have the case?\u0027\\n\\n Don held up the suitcase. \u0027Right here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. If by some miracle there is a demon in there, clip the case on to its little wrist, good and tight. I don\u0027t want to miss another chance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will do. We have grenades, boss. We could blow the door.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 snapped Kong. \u0027I need Minerva and I don\u0027t want her injured. Anyone hurts her, I hurt them. Understood?\u0027\\n\\n Everybody understood. Nothing complicated about it.\\n\\n Inside the gallery, Artemis was getting a little anxious. He had hoped that Kong would leave the building immediately, but the hit man must have spotted one of the exhibition posters in the elevator and come to the same conclusion that Artemis himself had.\\n\\n \u0027Anything?\u0027 he asked No.l, who was vaguely rubbing a statue\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \u0027Not yet. I\u0027m trying.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis patted his shoulder. \u0027Try a little harder. I have no desire to get involved in a firefight in a high-rise build-ing. At the very least we would all end up in a Taiwanese prison.\u0027\\n\\n OK, thought No.l. Concentrate. Reach into the stone.\\n\\n He held the stone warlock\u0027s finger tightly and tried to feel something. From the little he knew about warlocks, he guessed that this was probably Qwan, the elder magician. The stone figure\u0027s head was circled by a simple band with a spiral motif at the front — the sign of leadership.\\n\\n How terrible it must have been, No.l reflected. To see your home dematerialize and be left behind. To know it was all your ownfault.\\n\\n It was not my fault! snapped a voice in No.l \u0027s head. It was that stupid demon N\u0027zall. Now are you going to get me out of here or not?\\n\\n No.l almost fainted. His breath came in short explosive gasps and his heart seemed to hike upwards in his chest.\\n\\n Come on, young warlock. Release me! I have been waiting for a long, long time.\\n\\n The voice, the presence, was inside the sculpture. It was Qwan.\\n\\n Of course it\u0027s Qwan. You\u0027re holding my hand. Who did you think it was? You\u0027re not a simpleton, are you? Just my luck. Wait ten thousand years and then a simpleton turns up.\\n\\n \u0027I am not a simpleton!\u0027 blurted No.l.\\n\\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 said Artemis encouragingly. \u0027Just do your best. I will instruct Butler to hold Kong back for as long as he can.\u0027\\n\\n No.l bit his lip and nodded. If he spoke aloud, it could get confusing. And this situation was confusing enough with-out him adding to it.\\n\\n He would try thought-power. Qwan was speaking in his mind; maybe it would work the other way.\\n\\n Of course it works! Qwan sent. And what is all that nonsense about cooked food? Just release me from this prison.\\n\\n No.l winced, trying mentally to black out his dreams of a cooked banquet.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how to set you free, he thought. I don\u0027t know if I can.\\n\\n Of course you can, responded Qwan. You have enough magic in you to teach a troll to ploy an instrument. Just let it out.\\n\\n How? I have no idea how.\\n\\n Qwan was silent for a moment, while he took a quick peek into No.l\u0027s memories.\\n\\n Oh, I see. You are a complete novice. No training of any kind. Just as well really. Without expert tuition you could have blown up half of Hybras. Very well, I will give you a little nudge in the right direction. I can\u0027t do much from here, but maybe 1 can get your power flowing. It will get easier after this. Once you have been in contact with a warlock, some of his knowledge is passed on to you.\\n\\n No.l could have sworn that the stone fingers round his own tightened a fraction, but that could just have been his imagination. What was definitely not in his imagination was the sudden feeling of cold loss that sped along his arm. As though life itself were being sucked from him.\\n\\n Don\u0027t worry, young warlock. I\u0027m simply siphoning off a little magic to get the sparks running. It feels terrible, but that will not last.\\n\\n It did feel terrible. No.l imagined that dying piece by piece would feel something like this, which in a way was what was happening. And in such a situation the body will try to defend itself by seeing off the intruder. The magic that had lain dormant inside No.l until recently suddenly exploded in his brain and gave chase to the invader.\\n\\n To No.l it felt as though he suddenly had an entire new spectrum of vision. He had been blind before, but now he could see through walls. Of course it was not really some kind of super-vision, it was an understanding of his own abilities. The magic flowed through him like liquid fire, chas-ing impurities out through his pores. Venting steam through his orifices and setting the runes on his body aglow.\\n\\n Good lad, sent Qwan. Now let it go. Chase me out.\\n\\n No.l found that he was able to do exactly that — to control the magical flow. He sent it after Qwan\u0027s tendril, through his own fingers and into Qwan\u0027s. The dead feeling was replaced by a buzzing of power. He began to vibrate, and so did the statue, shedding wafers of stone like a dead snakeskin. The old warlock\u0027s fingers were solid no more, but living breathing skin. They held on to No.l tightly, keep-ing the connection solid.\\n\\n That\u0027s it, lad. You\u0027re doing it.\\n\\n 1 am doing it, thought No.l incredulously. This is really happening.\\n\\n Artemis and Holly looked on in amazement as the magic spread through Qwan\u0027s body, sloughing the stone from his limbs with pistol-shot cracks and orange flame. Life claimed Qwan\u0027s hand, then his arm, then his torso. Stone fell from his chin and mouth, allowing the warlock to heave his first breath in ten millennia. Bright blue eyes squinted against the light and shut tightly. And still the magic ran on, blast-ing every last shard of stone from Qwan\u0027s body, but there it stopped. When the sparks of No.l\u0027s power reached the next warlock in line, they simply fizzled and died.\\n\\n \u0027What about the others?\u0027 asked No.l. Surely he could free them too.\\n\\n Qwan hacked and coughed for several moments before he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Dead,\u0027 he said, then collapsed in the rubble.\\n\\n On the other side of the gallery security door, Kong was emptying a third clip from his machine pistol into the keypad.\\n\\n \u0027The door won\u0027t hold much longer,\u0027 said Butler. \u0027Any second now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you slow them down?\u0027 asked Artemis.\\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t be a problem. I don\u0027t want to leave any bodies here, Artemis. I imagine the police are already on their way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe you could just scare them a bit.\u0027\\n\\n Butler grinned. \u0027My pleasure.\u0027\\n\\n The shooting stopped, and the security door drooped slightly on its hinges. Butler ripped the door open smartly, yanking Billy Kong inside, then jammed the door closed again.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Billy,\u0027 he said, pinning the smaller man to the wall.\\n\\n Kong was too demented to be scared. He lashed out with a series of blows, any one of which would have been fatal to a normal per son. They bounced off Butler like a fly bounc-ing off aTigerTank. That\u0027s not to say they didn\u0027t hurt. Kong\u0027s trained hands felt like heated brands where they impacted. Butler\u0027s only reaction to the pain was a slight tightening round the corners of his mouth.\\n\\n \u0027Holly?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Pull,\u0027 said Holly, aiming her Neutrino at a point in space.\\n\\n Butler catapulted Billy Kong straight up, and Holly plucked him out of the air with a blast from her weapon. Kong spun across the floor, still throwing spasmodic punches.\\n\\n \u0027The snake\u0027s head is out of action,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027Let\u0027s hope the rest will follow suit.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva decided to take advantage of Billy Kong\u0027s unconsciousness to indulge in some payback. She stalked over to her prone kidnapper.\\n\\n \u0027You, Mister Kong, are nothing but a thug,\u0027 she said, kick-ing him in the leg.\\n\\n \u0027Young lady,\u0027 said Butler sharply, \u0027move away. He may not be completely out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If my father has as much as a hair out of place,\u0027 contin-ued Minerva, oblivious to Butler\u0027s warnings, \u0027I will person-ally ensure that you spend the maximum time in prison.\u0027\\n\\n Kong cracked open a weeping eye. \u0027That\u0027s no way to talk to your staff,\u0027 he croaked, and wrapped steely fingers round her ankle.\\n\\n Minerva realized that she had made a drastic mistake and decided that the best course of action was to scream as shrilly as possible. Which she did.\\n\\n Butler was torn. His duty was to protect Artemis, not Minerva, but through years of working with Artemis and indeed Holly, he had unconsciously adopted the role of general protector. Whenever somebody was in danger, he helped them to get out of it. And this foolish girl was certainly in danger. Mortal danger.\\n\\n Why is it, he wondered, that the smart ones always think that they\u0027re invincible?\\n\\n And so Butler made a decision, the consequences of which would haunt his dreams and waking hours for years to come. As a professional bodyguard, he knew the futility of second-guessing his own actions, but in the nights ahead he would often sit by the fire with his head in his hands and replay the moment in his mind, wishing that he had acted differently. Whatever way he played it out, the results were tragic, but at least they would not have been tragic for Artemis.\\n\\n So Butler acted. He took four smart steps away from the door to disentangle Minerva from Kong\u0027s grasp. It was a simple thing, the man was barely semi-conscious. He seemed to be operating on some kind of psychotic energy. Butler simply stepped down hard on his wrist, then rapped him sharply between the eyes with the knuckle of his index finger. Kong\u0027s eyes rolled back in his head, and his fingers relaxed like the legs of a dying spider.\\n\\n Minerva stepped smartly out of Kong\u0027s range.\\n\\n \u0027That was very foolish. I apologize,\u0027 she mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a little late for that,\u0027 reprimanded Butler. \u0027Now will you please take cover?\u0027\\n\\n The entire mini-episode took about four seconds, but in that four seconds a lot happened on the other side of the security door. Don, who was holding the bomb, and who had recently been punched for no good reason by his boss, decided to win Kong\u0027s favour by bursting into the gallery and taking on the giant in there. He put his shoulder to the door at the exact moment that Butler stepped away at the other side, and to his own surprise, went tumbling head first into the room, followed quickly by four more of Kong\u0027s henchmen, brandishing an assortment of weapons.\\n\\n Holly, who was covering the door with her Neutrino, was not unduly worried. She began to worry when a grenade rolled out of the tangle of men and tapped against her foot. It would be easy enough for her to escape the explosion, but Artemis and N°l would be well within the blast radius.\\n\\n Thinkfast!\\n\\n There was a solution, but it was costly in terms of equip-ment. She bolstered her weapon, whipped off her helmet and jammed it down over the grenade, holding it there with her own weight. This was a trick she had employed before with mixed results. She had hoped it wouldn\u0027t become a habit.\\n\\n She squatted there like a frog on a toadstool for what seemed like a long time, but couldn\u0027t have been more than a few seconds. She noticed, from the corner of her eye, that a thug with a silver case was slapping the man who had rolled the grenade. Perhaps using lethal force had been against orders.\\n\\n The grenade exploded, blasting Holly into a sharp arc. The helmet absorbed most of the shock, and all of the shrap-nel, but there was still enough force to shatter both of Holly\u0027s shinbones and fracture one femur. She landed on Artemis\u0027s back like a sack of rocks.\\n\\n \u0027Ow,\u0027 she said, and passed out.\\n\\n Artemis and No.l were attempting to revive Qwan.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s alive,\u0027 said Artemis, checking the warlock\u0027s pulse.\\n\\n \u0027Steady heartbeat. He should come out of it soon. You keep a strong contact with him, or he could disappear.\u0027\\n\\n No.l cradled the old demon\u0027s head. \u0027He called me a warlock,\u0027 he said tearfully. \u0027I am not alone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Time enough for a talk-show moment later,\u0027 said Artemis brusquely. \u0027We need to get you out of here.\u0027\\n\\n Kong\u0027s men were in the gallery now and shots were being fired. Artemis was confident that Butler and Holly could take care of a few thugs, but this confidence took a blow when there was a sudden explosion and a battered Holly landed on his back. Her body was instantly enveloped in a cocoon of blue light. Sparks dropped from the cocoon, like falling stars, pinpointing the most severe injuries.\\n\\n Artemis crawled out from beneath her, laying his recup-erating friend gently on the floor beside Qwan.\\n\\n Kong\u0027s men were now embroiled with Butler, and prob-ably regretting choosing this line of work. He tore into them like a bowling ball into a pack of quivering pins.\\n\\n One made it past Butler. A tall man with a tattooed neck and an aluminium case. Artemis guessed that this case prob-ably did not contain a selection of Asian spices, and real-ized that he would have to take action himself. While he was wondering exactly what it was he could do, the man sent him sprawling. By the time he made it back to Holly\u0027s side, his friend was sitting up groggily and there was a suit-case handcuffed to her wrist.\\n\\n The man who had delivered the case had returned to the fray, where he had lasted less than a second before Butler took him out of it again.\\n\\n Artemis knelt by Holly\u0027s side.\\n\\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027\\n\\n Holly smiled, but it was an effort. \u0027Just about, thanks to the magic. I\u0027m out though, not a drop left. So I would advise everyone to stay healthy until I can complete my ritual.\u0027 She shook her wrist, jangling the chain. \u0027What\u0027s in the case?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis seemed paler than usual. \u0027I would guess noth-ing pleasant.\u0027 He flicked the clips and lifted the lid. \u0027And I would be right. It\u0027s a bomb. Big and complicated. They sneaked it past security somehow. Through an area still under construction, I would guess.\u0027\\n\\n Holly blinked herself alert, shaking her head until the pain woke her up.\\n\\n \u0027OK. Bomb. Can you see a timer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eight minutes. And counting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you disarm it?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis pursed his lips. \u0027Perhaps. I need to open the casing and get into the works before I know for sure. It could be a straight detonator, or we could have all kinds of decoys.\u0027\\n\\n Qwan struggled to his elbows, coughing up large globs of dust and spit. \u0027What? I\u0027m flesh and bone after ten thou-sand years and now you\u0027re telling me a bomb is going to blow me to a million pieces?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is Qwan,\u0027 explained No.l. \u0027He\u0027s the most powerful warlock in the magic circle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m the only one now,\u0027 said Qwan. \u0027I couldn\u0027t save the rest. Just us two left now, lad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you petrify the bomb?\u0027 asked Holly.\\n\\n \u0027It will take several minutes before my magic is up and running. Anyway, the gargoyle\u0027s touch only works on organic matter. Plants and animals. A bomb is full of man-made compounds.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis raised an eyebrow. \u0027You know about bombs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was petrified. Not dead. I could see what was happen-ing around me. The stories I could tell you. You wouldn\u0027t believe where tourists stick gum.\u0027\\n\\n Butler was piling unconscious bodies against the security doors.\\n\\n \u0027We have to get out of here!\u0027 he called. \u0027The police are in the hallway.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis stood and took half a dozen steps away from the group, closing his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Artemis, this is no time to fall apart,\u0027 chided Minerva, crawling from behind a display case. \u0027We need a plan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh, young lady,\u0027 said Butler. \u0027He\u0027s thinking.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis gave himself twenty seconds to rack his brains. What he came up with was very far from perfect.\\n\\n \u0027Very well. Holly, you must fly us out of here.\u0027\\n\\n Holly did a few sums in her head. \u0027It will take two trips, maybe three.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No time for that. The bomb must go first. There are a lot of people in this building. I must go with the bomb as there is a chance I can defuse it. And the fairies must come too; it is imperative that they are not taken into custody. Hybras would be lost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t allow this,\u0027 objected Butler. \u0027I have a duty to your parents.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis was stern with his protector.\\n\\n \u0027I am giving you a new duty,\u0027 he said. \u0027Look after Minerva. Keep her safe until we can rendezvous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let Holly fly out over the sea and drop the bomb,\u0027 argued Butler. \u0027We can mount a rescue organization later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It will be too late. If we don\u0027t get these fairies out of here, the eyes of the world will be on Taipei. And anyway, the local seas are thronged with fishing boats. This is the only way. I will not allow humans or fairies to die when I might have prevented it.\u0027\\n\\n Butler would not give up. \u0027Listen to yourself. You sound like a… like a good guy! There\u0027s nothing in this for you.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis had no time for emotions. \u0027In the words of H. P. Woodman, old friend, Time is ticking on, and so we must be gone. Holly, tie us to your belt, all except Butler and Minerva.\u0027\\n\\n Holly nodded, still slightly shell-shocked. She reeled out a number of pitons from her belt, wishing she had been issued one of Foaly\u0027s Moonbelts, which generated a lo-grav field around everything attached to it.\\n\\n \u0027Under the arms,\u0027 she instructed No.l. \u0027Then clip it back on to the loop.\u0027\\n\\n Butler helped Artemis with his strap. \u0027This is it, Artemis. I\u0027ve had it, I swear. When we get home I am retiring. I\u0027m older than I look, and I feel older than I am. No more plot-ting. Promise me?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis forced a smile. \u0027I am simply flying to the next building. If I cannot defuse the bomb, then Holly can fly it out to sea and endeavour to find a safe spot.\u0027\\n\\n They both knew that Artemis was lying. If he could not defuse the bomb, there would be no time to find a safe drop point.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 said Butler, handing him a flat leather wallet. \u0027My picks. So you can at least get into the works.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, old friend.\u0027\\n\\n Holly was loaded to the chin. No.l and Qwan clung to her waist, while Artemis was cinched to the front.\\n\\n \u0027OK. Everyone ready?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish my magic would come back,\u0027 grumbled Qwan. \u0027I\u0027d turn myself into a statue again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Terrified,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027Freaking. Planking. Up the creek.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colloquialisms,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027Very good.\u0027\\n\\n Butler closed the case. \u0027One building across. That\u0027s as far as you need to go. Get that panel off and go straight for the explosive itself. Rip out the detonator if you have to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Understood.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK. I won\u0027t say goodbye, just good luck. I will see you as soon as I can talk us out of here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thirty minutes, if that.\u0027\\n\\n Up to that point Minerva had hung back looking shame-faced. Now she came forward.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Artemis. I shouldn\u0027t have gone near Mister Kong.\u0027\\n\\n Butler lifted her bodily aside. \u0027No, you shouldn\u0027t, but there\u0027s no time for apologies now. Just stand by the door and look innocent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Innocent! Now!\u0027\\n\\n Minerva obliged, wisely realizing that this was not the time for arguing.\\n\\n \u0027OK, Holly,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027Lift off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Check,\u0027 said Holly, activating her backpack. The wings struggled with the extra weight for a moment, and there was something about the engine vibration that Holly didn\u0027t like, but gradually her rig took the strain and lifted all four of them off the floor.\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 she said. \u0027I think we\u0027re good.\u0027\\n\\n Butler nudged the flying group towards a window. This was all so risky he couldn\u0027t believe that he was letting it happen. But there was no time to deliberate. It was do or die.\\n\\n He reached up, yanking down on the window\u0027s security catch. The entire two-metre pane swung wide, allowing the high altitude wind to scream into the building. Suddenly everyone was deafened and under attack from the elements. It was hard to see anyone and even harder to hear them.\\n\\n Holly floated the group outside and they would have been whipped away had Butler not held on for a second.\\n\\n \u0027Go with the wind,\u0027 he shouted to Holly, releasing his grip. \u0027Make your descent gradual.\u0027\\n\\n Holly nodded. Her wing motor skipped a beat and they dropped two metres.\\n\\n Artemis\u0027s stomach lurched.\\n\\n \u0027Butler,\u0027 he called, his voice thin and childlike in the wind.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Artemis, what?\u0027\\n\\n If something goes wrong, wait for me. No matter how it looks, I will return. I will bring them all back.\u0027\\n\\n Butler nearly jumped out after them. \u0027What are you plan-ning, Artemis? What are you going to do?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis called back, but the wind caught his words, and his bodyguard could only stand framed by steel and glass, shouting into the wind.\\n\\n They dropped quickly. A bit more quickly than Holly would have liked.\\n\\n The wings can\u0027t take it, she realized. Not the weight and the wind. We\u0027re not going to make it.\\n\\n She rapped a knuckle on Artemis\u0027s head. \u0027Artemis!\u0027 she shouted.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 shouted the Irish boy. \u0027Too much weight.\u0027\\n\\n If they fell now, the bomb would detonate in the middle of Taipei. That was unacceptable. There was only one thing to do. Artemis had not even mentioned this option to Butler, as he knew the bodyguard would reject it no matter how sound his own reasoning.\\n\\n Before Artemis had time to act on his theory, Holly\u0027s wings spluttered, jerked and died. They fell in ragged free fall like a sack of anchors, head over heels, dangerously close to the skyscraper wall.\\n\\n Artemis\u0027s eyes were scalded by wind, his limbs were folded back to breaking point by rushing air, and his cheeks were ballooned to comical proportions, though there was nothing funny about falling hundreds of metres to a certain death.\\n\\n No! said Artemis\u0027s iron core. I will not let this be the end.\\n\\n With a grim and physical determination that he must have picked up from Butler, Artemis raised his arms and grabbed No.l \u0027s arm. The object he sought was right there, almost in his face, and yet it seemed impossible to reach.\\n\\n Impossible or not, 1 must reach it.\\n\\n It was like trying to push against the skin of a giant balloon, but push Artemis did.\\n\\n The ground rushed up from below, smaller skyscrapers jutting up like spears. And still Artemis pushed.\\n\\n Finally, his fingers closed round No.l\u0027s silver bracelet.\\n\\n Goodbye, world, he thought. One way or another.\\n\\n And he ripped the bracelet off, flinging it into the air. Now, the demonkind were no longer anchored to this dimension. For a second there was no obvious reaction to this, but then, just as they were passing between the first of the lower skyscrapers, a revolving purple trapezoid opened in the sky and swallowed them as neatly as a kid catching a Cheerio in his mouth.\\n\\n Butler staggered back from the window, trying to process what he had seen. Holly\u0027s wings had failed, that much was clear, but then what? What?\\n\\n It dawned on him suddenly. Artemis must have had a secondary plan, that boy always did. Artemis wouldn\u0027t go to the bathroom without a back-up. So they weren\u0027t dead. There was a good chance of that. They had just disappeared into the demon dimension. He would have to keep telling himself that until he believed it.\\n\\n Butler noticed that Minerva was crying.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re all dead, aren\u0027t they? Because of me.\u0027\\n\\n Butler placed a hand on her shoulder. \u0027If they were all dead, it would be because of you, but they\u0027re not — Artemis has everything under control. Now, chin up, we have to talk our way out of here, daughter.\u0027\\n\\n Minerva frowned. \u0027Daughter?\u0027\\n\\n Butler winked, though he felt anything but cheery. \u0027Yes, daughter.\u0027\\n\\n Seconds later a squad of Taiwanese regular police heaved open the door, flooding the room with blue and grey uniforms. Butler found himself looking down the barrels of a dozen police special pistols. Most of these barrels were wobbling slightly.\\n\\n \u0027No, you dolts,\u0027 squealed Mr Lin, threading his way through the policemen, slapping at their gun arms. \u0027Not that one. He is my good friend. Those other ones, the unconscious ones. They are the ones who broke in here; they knocked me down. It is a miracle my friend and his…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Daughter,\u0027 prompted Butler.\\n\\n \u0027And his daughter were not harmed.\u0027\\n\\n Then the curator noticed his demolished exhibit and faked a faint. When no one rushed to aid him, he picked himself up, went off into a corner and had a little cry.\\n\\n An inspector, who wore his gun cowboy-style, ambled across to Butler.\\n\\n \u0027You did this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Not me. We were hiding behind a crate. They blew up the sculpture then started fighting among themselves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you have any idea why these people would want to destroy a sculpture?\u0027\\n\\n Butler shrugged. \u0027I think they think they\u0027re anarchists. Who knows with these people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They have no ID,\u0027 said the inspector. \u0027Not one of them. I find that a bit strange.\u0027\\n\\n Butler smiled bitterly. After all Billy Kong had done, he would only be prosecuted for property damage. Of course they could mention the kidnapping, but that would lead to weeks, possibly months of red tape in Taiwan. And Butler did not particularly want anyone looking too deeply into his past, or indeed the selection of false passports in his jacket pocket.\\n\\n Then something struck him. Something about Kong from a conversation back in Nice.\\n\\n Kong used a kitchen knife on his friend, Foaly had said. There\u0027s still a warrant out for him there, under the name Jonah Lee.\\n\\n Kong was wanted for murder in Taiwan, Butler realized, and there was no statute of limitations on murder.\\n\\n I heard them talking to that one,\u0027 said Butler, pointing to the supine Billy Kong. \u0027They called him Mister Lee, or Jonah. He was the boss.\u0027\\n\\n The inspector was interested. \u0027Oh, really. Did you hear anything else? Sometimes the smallest detail can be important.\u0027\\n\\n Butler frowned, thinking about it. \u0027One of them said something, I don\u0027t even know what it means…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 urged the inspector.\\n\\n \u0027He said… let me think. He said, You\u0027re not such a tough guy, Jonah. You haven\u0027t notched four barrel in years. What does that mean, notching your barrel!\u0027\\n\\n The inspector pulled a mobile phone from his pocket. \u0027It means that man is a murder suspect.\u0027 He hit \u0027one\u0027 then speed dial. \u0027Base? Chan here. I need you to run the name Jonah Lee through records — go back a few years.\u0027 He closed the phone. \u0027Thanks, Mister…?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arnott,\u0027 said Butler. \u0027Franklin Arnott, New York City.\u0027\\n\\n He had been using the Arnott passport for several years. It was genuinely rumpled.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks, Mister Arnott, you may just have caught a murderer.\u0027\\n\\n Butler blinked. \u0027A murderer! Wow. Do you hear that, Eloise? Daddy caught a murderer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well done, Daddy,\u0027 said Eloise, looking unhappy with Daddy for some reason.\\n\\n The inspector turned to pursue his inquiries, then stopped.\\n\\n \u0027The curator said there was another person. A boy. A friend of yours?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. And no. He\u0027s my son. Arty.\u0027\\n\\n T don\u0027t see him around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He just stepped out, but he\u0027ll be back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027\\n\\n Butler\u0027s eyes lost their focus. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m sure. He told me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/218.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
