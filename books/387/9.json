{"id":40842,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 Turned Tables","content":"chateau paradizoWhen Holly Short had opened the door of her makeshift basement cell, she found her helmet bouncing on the spot in front of her with a three-dimensional image of Foaly\u0027s face projected on to it. \u0027That is really creepy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Couldn\u0027t you just text me?\u0027 Foaly had included a three-dimensional help program in Holly\u0027s helmet\u0027s computer. It came as no surprise to Holly that he had given the help module his own features. \u0027I\u0027ve lost some weight since this model was constructed,\u0027 said Foaly\u0027s image. \u0027I\u0027ve been jogging. Every evening.\u0027 \u0027Focus,\u0027 Holly ordered. Holly dipped her chin and Foaly bounced the helmet on to her head. She sealed it tight. \u0027Where is the demon?\u0027 \u0027Straight up the stairs. Second on the left,\u0027 answered Foaly. \u0027Good. You\u0027ve wiped our patterns from the security system?\u0027 \u0027Of course. The demon is invisible, and you can\u0027t be picked up no matter what kind of lens they use.\u0027 Holly jumped up the human-sized steps. It would have been easier to fly, but she had left her wings outside, along with her suit computer. There had been no need to risk placing them in human hands, other than Artemis\u0027s. And even that took a little thinking about. She hurried along the corridor, past the first door on the left and crept through the open doorway of the second, taking in the situation with a quick scan of the room. The demon was secured on a chair, and the human girl was on the phone facing away from him. There was a large two-way mirror on the wall. Holly used her thermal scan to ascertain that the adjoining room had one occupant — a large male. He appeared to be talking on his mobile phone, not facing the demon\u0027s cell. \u0027Should I stun her?\u0027 asked Foaly hopefully. \u0027She knocked you out with sleeping gas?\u0027 He was quite enjoying play-ing with his new toy. It was like a first-person computer game. \u0027I wasn\u0027t actually unconscious,\u0027 said Holly, her words contained by the helmet\u0027s seal. \u0027I was holding my breath. Artemis had told me that she would use gas. The first thing I did was vent the vehicle.\u0027 \u0027What about that Mud Man next door?\u0027 persisted Foaly. \u0027I can focus the laser through the glass. It\u0027s quite clever really.\u0027 \u0027Shut up or you will pay for it when I get home,\u0027 warned Holly. \u0027We only shoot in an emergency.\u0027 Holly skirted Minerva, careful to avoid brushing against the Mud Girl or treading on a loose board. A single creak now could scupper all their plans. She squatted before the little demon, who did not seem too worried about his plight. What he was actually doing was listing off words, and having a little giggle after every one. \u0027Cornucopia, oh very good,\u0027 he said. And then, \u0027Sanitary. I like that one. Hee hee.\u0027 Marvellous, thought Holly. This demon obviously lost a few brain cells in the transfer. She used voice command to type a text on her visor. \u0027Nod if you can read this,\u0027 the text read. To the demon, the words appeared floating in space before him. \u0027Nod if you can…\u0027 He mouthed, then stopped and began nodding furiously. \u0027Stop nodding!\u0027 sent Holly. \u0027I am an elf. One of the first family of fairies. I am here to rescue you. Do you under-stand?\u0027 No response, so Holly sent a command. \u0027Nod once if you understand.\u0027 A single nod from the demon. \u0027Good. All you need to do is stay very still and quiet.\u0027 Another nod. The little demon was catching on. Foaly had transferred his image to the inside of Holly\u0027s visor. \u0027Ready?\u0027 asked the centaur. \u0027Yep. You keep an eye on the Mud Man next door. If he turns round, then you can stun him.\u0027 Holly wiggled her hand up her right sleeve, pincering a sheet of foil between her index and middle fingers. This is not as easy as it sounds when a fairy is shielded and vibrat-ing at speeds faster than the human eye can follow. It was made easier by the Section 8 suit, which reduced the amount of vibration necessary. Holly pulled out and unfolded a large square of cam foil that automatically projected a fair approximation of what should be behind it. Each bead on the cam foil was actually a fairy-made multifaceted diamond that could reflect accurately no matter what the viewing angle was. She backed up close to No.1, then held up the sheet of foil. The foil was equipped with multi-sensor technology, so it was a simple matter for Foaly to wipe No.l from the projection. To Minerva it would seem that her demon captive had simply vanished. To No.l it would seem like nothing whatsoever was happening, and that this was the lamest rescue in the history of rescues. Seconds later, Minerva turned quickly to face them. No.l nodded hello, and was amazed to find that she could not see him. \u0027Where is he, Artemis?\u0027 the girl screamed into her phone. \u0027Where is my prize?\u0027 No.l thought about saying I\u0027m right here! but decided against it. \u0027You tricked me!\u0027 squealed Minerva. \u0027You allowed me to capture your demon!\u0027 Finally the penny drops, thought Holly. Now go and search the chateau like a good girl. Minerva obligingly stalked out of the room, yelling for her father. Next door, Papa Paradizo, hearing his daugh-ter\u0027s screams, closed his phone and began to turn… Foaly activated the helmet laser and shot him in the chest. He tumbled to the floor and lay in a heap, his chest heaving with the slow breaths of the unconscious. \u0027Sweet,\u0027 crowed the centaur. \u0027Did you see that? Not so much as a smudge on the glass.\u0027 \u0027He was heading for the door!\u0027 objected Holly, drop-ping the cam foil. \u0027He was coming to the glass. I had to stun him.\u0027 \u0027We will talk about this later, Foaly. I do not like your new gung-ho attitude.\u0027 \u0027Caballine likes me to be masterful. She calls me her stallion.\u0027 \u0027Who? Listen, just stop talking!\u0027 hissed Holly, melting No.l\u0027s bonds with two sharp laser bursts. \u0027Free!\u0027 exclaimed the imp, jumping to his feet. \u0027Liberated. Unbound. Without restrictions.\u0027 Holly shut off her shield, revealing herself to No.l. \u0027I hope that\u0027s a helmet,\u0027 said No.l. Holly touched a button and her visor slid up. \u0027Yes. I am a fairy just like you. Just a different family.\u0027 \u0027An elf!\u0027 exclaimed No.l delightedly. \u0027An actual elf. I hear you cook your food and like music. Is that true?\u0027 \u0027Occasionally, when we\u0027re not trying to escape from murderous humans.\u0027 \u0027Oh, they\u0027re not murderous, pugnacious, homicidal, or even bellicose.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not the one you met. But there\u0027s a guy with funny hair in the basement. And believe me, when he wakes up he\u0027s going to be murderous and all those other things you mentioned.\u0027 No.l remembered Billy Kong; he had no desire to meet him again. \u0027Very well, elf. What next?\u0027 \u0027Call me Holly.\u0027 \u0027I am Number One. So what next, Holly?\u0027 \u0027Next, we escape. There are friends waiting for us… eh… Number One.\u0027 \u0027Friends?\u0027 said No.l. He knew the word, of course, but never imagined it could apply to him. It was a warming notion, even in these dire straits. \u0027What do I do?\u0027 Holly wrapped the cam foil round him like a shawl. \u0027Keep this on. It will cover most of you.\u0027 \u0027Amazing,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027A cloak of invisibility.\u0027 Foaly moaned in Holly\u0027s ear. \u0027A cloak of invisibility? That is a highly sensitive piece of field equipment. What does he think? Some warlock pulled it out of his armpit?\u0027 Holly ignored the centaur, something that was becom-ing a habit. \u0027Hold the foil close with one hand. Hang on to my belt with the other. We need to get out of here quickly. I only have enough magic left for a few minutes\u0027 shielding. Ready?\u0027 No.1 \u0027s anxious features peeped out from a shawl of invis-ibility. \u0027Hold the foil. Hang on to the belt. Got it.\u0027 \u0027Good. Foaly, watch our backs. Let\u0027s move out.\u0027 Holly shielded, then hurried out the open door, pulling No.l behind her. The corridor was lined with tall potted plants and lush oils, including a Matisse. Holly could hear the humans shouting in adjacent rooms. There was activ-ity all around them, and it could only be seconds before some Mud Men spilled into this corridor. No.l struggled to keep up, his little legs stumbling along behind the super-fit elfin captain. It seemed impossible that they could escape. All around was the clatter of approach-ing footsteps. No.l, slightly distracted, snagged a toe on the cam foil and trampled it underfoot. The foil\u0027s electronics crackled and died. The demon was as visible as a blood-stain on a patch of snow. \u0027We lost the foil,\u0027 said Foaly. Holly clenched her fingers. She missed her handgun. \u0027OK. Nothing to do but make a run for it. Foaly, you have free rein, if you\u0027ll pardon the horse analogy.\u0027 \u0027Finally,\u0027 whinnied the centaur. \u0027I added a game-pod joystick to my controls. A bit unorthodox, but very accu-rate. We\u0027ve got hostiles converging from all sides. My advice is to take the direct route. Go to the end of the corridor and follow our friend Doodah\u0027s path out the window. Butler will cover you once you\u0027re in the open.\u0027 \u0027OK. Hold on, Number One, whatever happens, don\u0027t let go.\u0027 The first threat came from ahead. Two security guards rounded the corner, guns extended. Ex-police, Holly guessed. Covering the diagonals. The men were shocked to see No.1. Obviously they were not in the need-to-know loop. \u0027What the hell?\u0027 said one. The other kept his nerve. \u0027Hold it right there.\u0027 Foaly hit them both in the chest with fat laser bursts. The energy sank through their clothes and they slid down the wall. \u0027Unconscious,\u0027 panted No.l. \u0027Comatose, cataleptic, out for the count.\u0027 He realized that this vocabulary-spouting was a good way to deal with stress. \u0027Stress. Pressure, strain and anxiety.\u0027 Holly dragged No.l onwards, towards the still open window. More guards came from the side corridors, and Foaly dispatched them efficiently. \u0027I should get bonus points for this,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or at the very least a free life.\u0027 There were two more guards in the sitting room, sneak-ing an espresso. Foaly dropped them where they stood. And then flashed out a fan laser burst to evaporate the coffee before it hit the rug. \u0027It\u0027s Tunisian,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Very difficult to get coffee out. Now they can just suck up the grains.\u0027 Holly stepped down into the room. \u0027Sometimes I think you don\u0027t quite get the gravity of field missions,\u0027 she said, skirting a massive velvet sofa. No.l stumbled down the human-sized steps after his rescuer. In spite of all his new vocabulary, the imp was not quite sure how he was feeling. Scared, of course. Big Mud Men with fire weapons and all that. Excited too. Being rescued by some kind of elf superhero, who was invisible too. Pain in the leg, don\u0027t forget that. The angry human had shot him in the leg, with a silver bullet, no doubt. But No.l realized that one feeling was missing from the melting pot. One that had been strong within him for as long as he could remember. Uncertainty. In spite of the frantic antics unfolding all around, he felt more at home on this planet than he ever had on Hybras. A bullet whistled past his ear. Then again, maybe Hybras hadn\u0027t been so bad. \u0027Wake up, Foaly!\u0027 admonished Holly. \u0027You\u0027re supposed to be watching our backs.\u0027 \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said the centaur, swivelling the laser and strob-ing the doorway. The female guard smiled broadly then collapsed. On the ground she began singing a nursery rhyme about doggies and their bones. \u0027Bizarre,\u0027 said Foaly. \u0027That guard is singing.\u0027 \u0027Often happens,\u0027 grunted Holly, clambering on to the window sill. \u0027The laser knocks out some functions, but sometimes awakens others.\u0027 Interesting, thought the centaur. A happy gun. Certainly worth investigating. Holly reached down and grasped No.l\u0027s wrist, pulling him over the sill. She was dismayed to see that her own arms were not as invisible as she would have hoped. Her magic was wearing thin. Shielding was a real power siphon. She would flicker into visibility soon whether they were safely away or not. \u0027Nearly there,\u0027 she said. \u0027Just across the wide open green space, is it?\u0027 said No.l, displaying a real gift for sarcasm. \u0027I like him,\u0027 said Foaly. They tumbled out on to the lawn. The alarm was well and truly raised now, and guards poured from the various doors like beads from a ruptured beanbag. \u0027Go crazy, Foaly,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027And take out their vehicles too.\u0027 \u0027Yes sir, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Foaly, and began firing. Holly ran flat out, pulling the imp behind her. There was no time to consider his physical abilities, either he kept up, or he got dragged. The laser pencil on her helmet flashed out burst after burst, swivelling in wide arcs to cover the approaching guards. Holly felt the weapon\u0027s heat on the crown of her head and resolved to mention the helmet\u0027s supposedly revolutionary cooling system to Foaly if they ever made it out of this. The centaur was too busy for chat now. All Holly could hear through her headset was grunting and whinnying as Foaly concentrated on his job. He was not concerned about pinpoint accuracy any more, there were too many things to shoot. He sent out scything fans of energy that socked half a dozen guards per burst. The guards would be perfectly fine in half an hour, though some might experience headaches, hair loss, irritability, loss of bowel control and other assorted side effects for a few days. Foaly targeted the four-wheel drives next, firing several pulses into each petrol tank. The BMWs exploded in sequence, turning spectacular fiery cartwheels. The force of the blast cupped Holly and No.l like a giant hand, scoot-ing them on their way a little faster. Holly\u0027s helmet protected her from the noise, but poor No.l\u0027s head would ring for quite a while. Thick black smoke billowed from cracked engines and prowled across the tended garden, more effective than any smoke grenade. Holly and No.l raced just ahead of the smoke line towards the main gates. \u0027Gates,\u0027 Holly panted into her microphone. \u0027I see them,\u0027 said Foaly, melting the wrought-iron barri-ers right off their hinges. They collapsed to the ground with a big bell bong. A rented MPV skidded to a halt outside the pillars, and the passenger door slid open. Artemis was inside, reaching out to No.l. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said urgently. \u0027Get in.\u0027 \u0027Arrgh!\u0027 said No.l. \u0027A human!\u0027 Holly leaped inside the vehicle, dragging No.l with her. \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 she said, switching off her shield to conserve the little that was left. \u0027He\u0027s a friend.\u0027 No.l clung to Holly\u0027s back, trying not to throw up. He glanced towards the front of the MPV where Butler sat. \u0027What about him? Please tell me he\u0027s a friend too.\u0027 Holly grinned, climbing on to a seat. \u0027Yes, he\u0027s a friend. The very best.\u0027 Butler yanked the gear stick into \u0027Drive\u0027. \u0027Buckle up, boys and girls. We\u0027re about to be in a car chase.\u0027 The sun was setting as Butler expertly steered the car round the natural chicanes of the Route de Vence. The road was hewn from the mountainside, with stone villas teetering above and the Gorge du Loup yawning below. It took a skilled driver to negotiate the bends at speed, but Butler had once driven an Al Fahd armoured vehicle through a crowded Cairo market, so the Alpine roads were not too much of a challenge for him. As it turned out, there was no car chase. The Paradizo fleet lay in flaming, mangled, inverted heaps in the chateau driveway. There was not so much as a moped left intact to tail the getaway car. Butler checked the rear-view mirror constantly, and only allowed himself a satisfied grin when they passed through the toll station at Cagnes sur Mer. \u0027We\u0027re clear,\u0027 he pronounced, accelerating into the motorway\u0027s fast lane. \u0027There\u0027s not a vehicle intact on that estate, including little Beau\u0027s toy car.\u0027 Artemis smiled, giddy with success. \u0027Perhaps we should have left them Mister Day\u0027s marvellous booster.\u0027 Holly noticed that No.l was happily examining his seat belt. \u0027Buckle up,\u0027 she said, slotting the buckle into its catch. \u0027Buckle,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027Clasp, clip, fastener. Why are you with these humans?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re going to help you,\u0027 explained Holly gently. No.l had a million questions, and knew exactly how to phrase every one of them. But for the moment, words took a back seat to pictures, and No.l \u0027s square impish jaw dropped further and further as he stared through the tinted glass, absorbing the wonders of the modern motorway. Holly took the opportunity to catch up with events. \u0027Doodah and Mulch got away OK?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 confirmed Artemis. \u0027Foaly was anxious to have the shuttle returned, as he had taken it without clearance. We shouldn\u0027t be more than a few hours behind them. By the time you get to the shuttle port, the shutdown should be lifted. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you\u0027ve earned yourself a medal, Holly. Job spectacularly well done.\u0027 \u0027There are still loose ends.\u0027 \u0027True. But nothing an LEP mind-wipe team can\u0027t take care of. There is no physical evidence that anything other than humans caused this devastation.\u0027 Holly leaned back against the seat. \u0027I\u0027m forgetting something.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re forgetting the demons. Their spell is disintegrat-ing. Their island will be lost in time. Will be, or has been. They drift in and out of time, making contact like a bounc-ing ball.\u0027 No.l picked up on one word. \u0027Disintegrating?\u0027 \u0027Hybras is doomed,\u0027 said Artemis frankly. \u0027Your home will shortly be dragged through the time tunnel along with everything on it. When I say shortly, I mean at our end. At your end it could have already happened, or maybe it will happen in a million years.\u0027 He extended his hand. \u0027And by the way, my name is Artemis Fowl.\u0027 No.l took the hand, nibbling the forefinger as was the demon custom. \u0027I am Number One. Imp. Isn\u0027t there something we can do to save Hybras?\u0027 \u0027Hardly,\u0027 replied Artemis, retrieving his finger and checking it for bite marks. \u0027The only way to save Hybras is to bring it back to Earth under controlled circumstances. Sadly, the only people who could have done that were the warlocks, and they are all dead.\u0027 No.l chewed his lip. \u0027Em, well, I\u0027m not too sure, but I might be a warlock. I can speak in tongues.\u0027 Artemis sat forward, straining his seat belt. \u0027Speaking in tongues could be merely an aptitude. What else can you do?\u0027 \u0027Again, not positive about this, but I may have, possibly, turned wood to stone.\u0027 \u0027The gargoyle\u0027s touch. Now that is interesting.You know, Number One, there\u0027s something about you. Those mark-ings. You seem familiar to me.\u0027 Artemis frowned, irritated that he couldn\u0027t quite place the memory. \u0027We haven\u0027t met before, I would certainly remember. Nevertheless, there is something…\u0027 \u0027These markings are quite common, especially the fore-head hex. Demons often think they know me. Now, about saving Hybras?\u0027 Artemis nodded. \u0027Of course. The best course of action is to get you below ground. I only dabble in magical theory; Foaly has live experts just dying to examine you. I feel confident that the LEP can come up with a plan to save your island.\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 Butler interrupted from the front of the car, saving Artemis from answering. \u0027We have a bit of a situation at Chateau Paradizo,\u0027 he said, tapping the screen of a compact laptop suckered to the dashboard. \u0027Maybe you\u0027d better take a look.\u0027 The bodyguard passed the computer over his shoulder. The screen was divided into a dozen boxes, the security feed from Chateau Paradizo, still being supplied by Foaly\u0027s data twist. Artemis balanced the laptop on his knees, his bright eyes flickering across the screen. \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 he said thoughtfully. \u0027This is not good.\u0027 Holly swapped seats, so she could see the screen. \u0027Not good at all,\u0027 she said. No.l was not too worried about the computer. As far as he was concerned it was just a little box. \u0027Not good,\u0027 he mused, accessing the dictionary in his head. \u0027A synonym for bad.\u0027 Artemis did not look up from the screen. \u0027That\u0027s exactly right, Number One. This is bad. Very bad.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/215.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
