{"id":40841,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8 Sudden Impact","content":"INSIDE the chateau paradizo\n No.1 was having a lovely dream. In the dream, his mother was holding a surprise party for him, in honour of his graduation from warlock college. The food was scrump-tious. The dishes were cooked and most of the meat was already dead.\n He was reaching for a beautifully presented basted pheas-ant in a basket of woven herb bread ropes, just like the one described in Chapter Three of Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow, when suddenly the vision retreated into the far distance, as though reality itself was being stretched.\n No.l tried to follow the feast but it drew further and further away, and now his legs wouldn\u0027t work and No.l couldn\u0027t understand why. He looked down and saw to his horror that everything from his armpits down had turned to stone. The stone virus was spreading upwards across his chest and along his neck. No.l felt the urge to scream. He was suddenly terrified that his mouth would turn to stone before he could scream. To be petrified forever and hold that scream inside would be the ulti-mate horror.\n No.l opened his mouth and screamed.\n Billy Kong, who had been lounging on a chair watch-ing, snapped his fingers at a camera on the ceiling.\n \u0027The ugly one is awake,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I think it wants its mother.\u0027\n No.l stopped screaming when his breath ran out. It was a bit of an anticlimax really, starting out with a lusty howl and petering off to a reedy whine.\n OK, thought No.l. / am alive and in the land of men. Time to open my eyes andjind out just how deep in the pig dung I actually am.\n No.l cracked his eyes open warily, as though he might see something big and hard heading for his face at high speed. What he did see was that he was in a small bare room. There were rectangular lights on the ceiling that threw out the light of a thousand candles, and most of one wall was taken up by a mirror. There was a human, possi-bly a child, perhaps a female, with a ridiculous mane of blonde curls and an extra finger on each hand. The crea-ture was wearing a ludicrously impractical toga-type arrangement and spongy-soled shoes, with lightning bolts 170\n embossed on the sides. There was another person in the room. A slouching, leering, thin man, who tapped a stac-cato rhythm on his leg. No.l \u0027s eyes were drawn to the second human\u0027s hair. There were at least half a dozen colours in there. The man was a peacock.\n No.l decided that perhaps he should raise his empty hands, to show that he wasn\u0027t carrying a weapon, but it\u0027s difficult to do that when you are tied to a chair.\n \u0027I\u0027m tied to a chair,\u0027 he said apologetically, as though it was his fault. Unfortunately he said this in Gnommish and in the demon dialect. To the humans it sounded like he was trying to dislodge a particularly annoying blockage from his throat.\n No.l resolved not to talk again. Doubtless he would say the wrong thing and the humans would have to ritually execute him. Thankfully the female seemed eager to chat.\n \u0027Hello, I am Minerva Paradizo and this man is Mister Kong,\u0027 she said. \u0027Can you understand me?\u0027\n It was all gibberish to No.l. Not a single recognizable word from the text of Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow.\n He smiled encouragingly, to show he appreciated the effort.\n \u0027Do you speak French?\u0027 asked the blonde girl, then switched languages. \u0027How about English?\u0027\n No.l sat up. That last bit was familiar. Strange inflections, surely, but the words themselves were from the book.\n \u0027English?\u0027 he repeated.\n This was the language of Lady Heatherington Smythe. Learned at her mother\u0027s knee. Explored in the lecture halls of Oxford. Used to profess her undying love for Professor Rupert Smythe. No.l loved the book. He sometimes believed that he was the only one who did. Even Abbot didn\u0027t seem to appreciate the romantic bits.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027English. The last one spoke it well enough. French too.\u0027\n Manners must be appreciated somewhere outside a book, No.l had always thought, so he decided to give them a go.\n He growled, which was the polite demon way of asking to speak in front of your betters. This must not be how humans interpreted it because the skinny human jumped to his feet, pulling out a knife.\n \u0027No, kind sir,\u0027 said No.l, hurriedly cobbling together a couple of sentences from Lady Heatherington. \u0027Prithee sheath thine weapon. I bring joyous tidings only.\u0027\n The skinny human was confounded. He spoke English as well as the next American, but this little runt was spout-ing some kind of medieval nonsense.\n Kong straddled No.l, holding the knife to his throat.\n \u0027Talk straight, ugly,\u0027 said the man, deciding to give Taiwanese a go.\n \u0027I wish I could understand,\u0027 said No.l, shaking. Unfortunately he said this in Gnommish. \u0027What I… eh… meanest to say is…\"\n It was no good. Quotes from Lady Heatherington that he could generally shoehorn into any occasion just weren\u0027t coming under pressure.\n \u0027Talk straight or die!\u0027 shrieked the human into his face.\n No.l shrieked right back at him. \u0027How can I talk straight, you son of a three-legged dog? I don\u0027t speak Taiwanese!\u0027\n All of this was said in perfect Taiwanese. No.l was stunned. The gift of tongues was not one demons possessed. Except the warlocks. More proof.\n He intended to ponder this development for a few moments, now that the knife-wielding human had backed off, but suddenly the beauty of language exploded inside his brain. Even his own tongue, Gnommish, had been severely culled by the demons. There were thousands of words that had dropped from regular use on the basis that they did not relate to killing things or eating them, and not necessarily in that order.\n \u0027Cappuccino!\u0027 shouted No.l, surprising everyone.\n \u0027Excuse me?\u0027 said Minerva.\n \u0027What a lovely word. And manoeuvre. And balloon.\u0027\n The skinny man pocketed his knife. \u0027Now he\u0027s talking. If he\u0027s anything like the videos you showed me of the other one, we\u0027ll never get him to shut up.\u0027\n \u0027Pink!\u0027 exclaimed No.l delightedly. \u0027We don\u0027t have a word for that colour in the demon commonspeak. Pink is considered undemonlike, so we ignore it. It\u0027s such a relief to be able to say pink!\u0027\n \u0027Pink,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027Fabulous.\u0027\n \u0027Tell me,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027What is a candyfloss? I know the words, and it sounds… scrumptious… but the picture in my head cannot be accurate.\u0027\n The girl seemed pleased that No.l could talk, but slightly miffed that he had forgotten his situation.\n \u0027We can talk about candyfloss later, little demon. There are more important things to discuss.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 agreed Kong. \u0027The demon invasion, for example.\u0027\n No.l rolled the sentence round in his head. \u0027Sorry, my gifts must not be fully developed. The only meaning I have for invasion is a hostile entry of an armed force into a terri-tory.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the one I mean, you little toad.\u0027\n \u0027Again, I\u0027m a little confused. My new vocabulary is telling me that a toad is a froglike creature…\u0027 No.1 \u0027s face fell. \u0027Oh, I see — you\u0027re insulting me.\u0027\n Kong scowled at Minerva. \u0027I think I preferred him when he spoke like an old movie.\u0027\n \u0027I was quoting scripture,\u0027 explained No.l, enjoying the shape of these new words in his mouth. \u0027From the sacred book: Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow.\u0027\n Minerva frowned, looking at the ceiling as she thought back in time. \u0027Lady Heatherington Smythe. Why is that familiar?\u0027\n \u0027Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow is the source of all our human knowledge. Lord Abbot brought it back to us.\u0027 No.l bit his lip, shutting off his own babbling. He had said too much already. These humans were the enemy, and he had given them the blueprint to Abbot\u0027s plans. Blueprint. Nice word.\n Minerva clapped her hands once, sharply. She had found the memory she was looking for.\n \u0027Lady Heatherington Smythe. My goodness, that ridicu-lous romance! Remember, Mister Kong?\u0027\n Kong shrugged. \u0027I don\u0027t read fiction. Manuals, mostly.\u0027\n \u0027No, remember the video footage of the other demon. We let him have a book, he carried it around like a secur-ity blanket.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, yes. I remember that. Stupid little goat. Always toting around that stupid book.\u0027\n \u0027You know, you\u0027re repeating yourself,\u0027 said No.l, witter-ing nervously. \u0027There are other words for stupid. Dim, dense, slow, thick. Just to name a few. I can do Taiwanese if you prefer.\u0027\n A knife appeared in Kong\u0027s hand as if from nowhere.\n \u0027Wow,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027That\u0027s a real talent. A bravura in fact.\u0027\n Kong ignored the compliment, flipping the knife so he was holding the blade.\n \u0027Just shut up, creature. Or this goes between your eyes. I don\u0027t care how valuable you are to Miss Paradizo. To me, you and your kind are simply something to be wiped off the face of the Earth.\u0027\n Minerva folded her arms.\n \u0027I will thank you, Mister Kong, not to threaten our guest.\n You work for my father, and you will do what my father tells you to do. And I am pretty sure my father told you to keep a civil tongue in your head.\u0027\n Minerva Paradizo may have been a precocious talent in many areas, but because of her age, she had limited ex-perience. From her studies, she knew how to read body language, but she did not know that a skilled martial artist can train himself to control his body, so that his real feel-ings are hidden. A true disciple of the discipline would have noted the subtle tightening of the tendons in Billy Kong\u0027s neck. This was a man holding himself in check.\n Not yet, his stance said. Not yet.\n Minerva returned her attention to No.1.\n \u0027Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow, you say?\u0027\n No.l nodded. He was afraid to speak in case his runaway mouth leaked any more information than it already had.\n Minerva spoke now to the large mirror. \u0027You remem-ber that one, Papa? The most ridiculous fluffy romance you are ever likely to avoid like the plague. I loved it when I was six. It\u0027s all about a nineteenth-century English aristo-crat. Oh, who\u0027s the author… Carter Cooper Harbison. The Canadian girl. She was eighteen when she wrote it. Did absolutely no research. She had nineteenth-century nobles speaking like they were from the fifteen hundreds. Absolute tosh, so obviously a worldwide hit. Well, it seems our old friend Abbot brought it home with him. The cheeky devil has managed to sell it as gospel truth. It seems he has the rest of the demons spouting Cooper Harbison as though she were an evangelist.\u0027\n No.l broke his no-speaking vow. \u0027Abbot? Abbot was here?\u0027\n \u0027Mais oui,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027How do you think we knew where to find you. Abbot told us everything.\u0027\n A voice boomed through a wall-mounted speaker. \u0027Not everything. His figures were flawed. But my young genius Minerva figured it out. I\u0027ll get you a pony for this, darling. Whatever colour you like.\u0027\n Minerva waved at the mirror. \u0027Thank you, Papa. You should know by now that I don\u0027t like ponies. Or ballet.\u0027\n The speaker laughed. \u0027That\u0027s my little girl. What about a trip to Disneyland, Paris? You could dress as a princess.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps after the selection committee,\u0027 said Minerva with a smile. The smile was slightly forced, though. She did not have time for Disney dreams at the moment. \u0027After I am sure of the Nobel nomination. We have less than a week to question our subjects and organize secure travel to the Royal Academy in Stockholm.\u0027\n No.l had another important question. \u0027And Lady Heatherington Smythe\u0027s Hedgerow? It\u0027s not true?\u0027\n Minerva laughed delightedly. \u0027True? My dear little fellow. Nothing could be further from the truth. That book is a cringeworthy testament to teenage hormonal fabrication.\u0027\n No.l was stunned. \u0027But I studied that book. For hours.\n I acted out scenes. I made costumes. Are you telling me that there is no Heatherington Hall?\u0027\n \u0027No Heatherington Hall.\u0027\n \u0027And no evil Prince Karloz?\u0027\n \u0027Fiction.\u0027\n No.l remembered something. \u0027But Abbot came back with a crossbow, just like in the book. That\u0027s evidence.\u0027\n Kong joined the discussion; after all, this was his area of expertise. \u0027Crossbows? Ancient history, toad. We use things like these now.\u0027 Billy Kong drew a black ceramic handgun from a holster tucked in his armpit. \u0027This little beauty shoots fire and death. We\u0027ve got much bigger ones too. We fly round the world in our metal birds and rain down exploding eggs on our enemies.\u0027\n No.l snorted. \u0027That little thing shoots fire and death? Flying metal birds? And I suppose you eat lead and blow golden bubbles too.\u0027\n Kong did not respond well to cynicism, especially from a little reptilian creature. In one fluid motion, he flicked the safety off his weapon and fired three shots, blowing apart the headrest of No.l \u0027s seat. The imp\u0027s face was show-ered with sparks and splinters, and the sound of the shots echoed like thunder in the confined space.\n Minerva was furious. She began screaming long before anyone could hear her.\n \u0027Get out of here, Kong. Out!\u0027\n She kept screaming this, or words to that effect, until their ears stopped ringing. When Minerva realized that Billy Kong was ignoring her commands, she switched to Taiwanese.\n \u0027I told my father not to employ you. You are an impul-sive and violent man. We are conducting a scientific experi-ment here. This demon is of no use to me if he is dead; do you understand, you reckless man? I need to communicate with our guest, so you must leave, because you obviously terrify him. Go now, I warn you, or your contract will be terminated.\u0027\n Kong rubbed the bridge of his nose. It was taking every shred of patience he had not to dispose of this whingeing infant right now and take his chances with her security. But it would be foolhardy to risk everything because he could not hold his temper for a few more hours. For now, he would have to content himself with some more insolence.\n Kong took a small mirror from his trouser pocket and plucked at the gelled strands of his hair.\n \u0027I will go now, little girl, but be careful how you speak to me. You may come to regret it.\u0027\n Minerva split the fingers of her right hand into a W.\n \u0027Whatever,\u0027 she said in English.\n Kong pocketed his mirror, winked at No.l and left. No.l did not feel comforted by that wink. In the demon world, you winked at your opponent in pitched battle to make clear your intention to kill him next. No.l got the distinct impres-sion that this spiky-haired human had that same intention.\n Minerva sighed, took a moment to compose herself, then resumed her interview with the prisoner.\n \u0027Let\u0027s start at the beginning. What is your name?\u0027\n No.l supposed that was a safe question to answer. \u0027I have no real name, because I never warped. I used to worry about that, but now I seem to have a lot more to worry about.\u0027\n Minerva realized that her questions would have to be quite specific.\n \u0027What do people call you?\u0027\n \u0027You mean human people? Or other demons?\u0027\n \u0027Demons.\u0027\n \u0027Oh… right. They call me Number One.\u0027\n \u0027Number One?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. It\u0027s not much of a name, but it\u0027s all I have. And I console myself with the fact that it\u0027s better than Number Two.\u0027\n \u0027I see. Well then, Number One, I suppose you would like to know what\u0027s going on here.\u0027\n No.l\u0027s eyes were wide and pleading. \u0027Yes, please.\u0027\n \u0027OK then,\u0027 Minerva began, as she sat facing her pris-oner. \u0027Two years ago one of your pride materialized here. Just popped up in the middle of the night on the statue of D\u0027Artagnan in the courtyard. He was lucky not to be killed actually. D\u0027Artagnan\u0027s sword actually pierced one of his arms. The tip broke off inside.\u0027\n \u0027Was the sword silver?\u0027 asked No.l.\n \u0027Yes. Yes it was. Of course we realized later that the silver anchored him to this dimension, otherwise he would have been attracted to his own space and time. The demon was, of course, Abbot. My parents wanted to call the gendarmes, but I persuaded them to bring the poor half-dead beast inside. Papa has a small surgery here that he uses for his more paranoid patients. He treated Abbot\u0027s burns, but we missed the silver tip until a few weeks later when the wound became infected and Papa did an X-ray. Abbot was quite fascinating to observe. Initially, and for many days, he flew into a psychotic rage whenever a human approached him. He tried to kill us all and vowed that his army was coming to exterminate humankind from the face of the Earth. He conducted long arguments with himself. It was more than split personality. It was as if there were two people in one body. A warrior and a scientist. The warrior would rage and thrash, then the scientist would write calculations on the wall. I knew that I was on to something important here. Something revolutionary. I had discovered a new species, or rather rediscovered an old one. And if Abbot really was to bring a demon army, then it was up to me to save lives. Human and demon. But of course, I am merely a child so no one would listen to me. But if I could record this and present it to the Nobel Committee in Stockholm, I could win the Physics prize and establish demons as a protected species. Saving a species would give me a certain satisfaction, and no child has ever won the prize before, not even the great Artemis Fowl.\u0027\n Something had been puzzling No.l. \u0027Aren\u0027t you a little young to be studying other species? And you\u0027re a girl too. That pony offer made by the magic voice box sounded pretty good.\u0027\n Minerva had obviously come across this attitude before. \u0027Times are changing, demon,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Children are a lot smarter than they used to be. We\u0027re writing books, mastering computers, tearing apart scientific myths. Did you know that most scientists won\u0027t even acknowledge the existence of magic? Once you add magic into the energy equation, nearly all the current laws of physics are shown to be seriously flawed.\u0027\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said No.l, not convincing anyone.\n \u0027I am exactly the right age for this project,\u0027 added Minerva. \u0027I am young enough to believe in magic and old enough to understand how it works. When I present you in Stockholm, and we put forward our thesis on time travel and magic as elemental energy, it will be a historic moment. The world will have to take magic seriously, and make ready for the invasion!\u0027\n \u0027There is no invasion,\u0027 protested No.l.\n Minerva smiled as a kindergarten teacher would at a fibbing child. \u0027I know all about it. Once Abbot\u0027s warrior personality became dominant, he told us about the Battle of Taillte and how the demons would return and wage a terrible war with the Mud Men, as he called us. There was a lot of blood and hacking of limbs involved.\u0027\n No.l nodded. That sounded like Abbot.\n \u0027That\u0027s what Abbot believed, but things have changed.\u0027\n \u0027I explained that to him. I explained that he had been flitting through time and space for ten thousand years, and that we had come a long way since then. There are more of us than there used to be, and we didn\u0027t use crossbows any more.\u0027\n \u0027You didn\u0027t? You don\u0027t?\u0027\n \u0027You saw Mister Kong\u0027s gun. That\u0027s only a tiny example of the kind of weaponry we have. Even if your entire pride of demons arrived all together, armed to the teeth, it would take about ten minutes to have you all locked up.\u0027\n \u0027Is that what you\u0027re going to do? Lock us up?\u0027\n \u0027That was the plan, yes,\u0027 admitted Minerva. \u0027As soon as Abbot realized that the demons could never beat us, he changed his tactics. He voluntarily explained the mechanics of the time tunnel to me and in return I gave him books to read and old weapons to examine. After a few days\u0027 reading, he asked to be called Abbot, after General Leon Abbot in the book. I knew that once I presented Leon Abbot in Stockholm, it would be easy to get funding for an international task force. Whenever a demon popped up, we could tag him with silver and house him in an artificial demon community for study. Central Park Zoo was my preferred location.\u0027\n No.l ran the word zoo through his new lexicon. \u0027Aren\u0027t zoos for animals?\u0027\n Minerva gazed at her feet. \u0027Yes. I am rethinking that, especially having met you. You seem quite civilized, not like that Abbot creature. He was an animal. When he arrived, we tended his wounds, nursed him back to health, and all he could do was try to eat us. We had no choice but to restrain him.\u0027\n \u0027So, you\u0027re not going to lock us up in a zoo any more?\u0027\n \u0027Actually, I don\u0027t have a choice. Judging by my calcula-tions, the time tunnel is unravelling at both ends and deteri-orating along the shaft. Soon, any calculations will be unreliable and it will be impossible to predict where or when demons will materialize. I\u0027m afraid, Number One, that your pride doesn\u0027t have long left before it disappears altogether.\u0027\n No.l was stunned. This was more information than anyone could absorb in one day. For some reason the demoness with the red markings flashed into his mind. \u0027Isn\u0027t there any way to help? We are intelligent beings, you know. Not animals.\u0027\n Minerva stood and paced, stretching one of her corkscrew curls.\n \u0027I have been giving this some thought. There\u0027s nothing that can be done without magic, and Abbot told me the warlocks all died in the transition.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 said No.l. He did not mention that he might be a warlock himself. Something told him that this was valuable information and it was not a good idea to reveal too much valuable information to a person who had tied you to a chair. He had said too much already.\n \u0027Maybe if Abbot had known about the time spell, he wouldn\u0027t have been so eager to get back to Hybras,\u0027 mused Minerva. \u0027Papa told him that there was a silver chip in his arm, and that very night he dug it out with his nails and disappeared. We have the whole thing on tape. I have wondered every day if he managed to make it home.\u0027\n \u0027He made it,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027The time spell took him right back to the beginning. He never said anything about this place. Just turned up with the book and the crossbow, claiming to be our saviour. It was all lies.\u0027\n \u0027Well then,\u0027 sighed Minerva, and she seemed genuinely sorry. \u0027I don\u0027t have a single idea about how to save the pride. Maybe your little friend in the next room can help when she wakes up.\u0027\n \u0027What little friend?\u0027 asked No.l, puzzled.\n \u0027The one who knocked out Bobo, my brother. The little creature we captured trying to rescue you,\u0027 explained Minerva. \u0027Or, more accurately, trying to rescue an empty golf bag. She looks like a magical creature. Maybe she can help.\u0027\n Who would want to rescue a golf bag? wondered No.1.\n The door opened a crack, and Juan Soto\u0027s head appeared in the gap.\n \u0027Minerva?\u0027\n \u0027Not now,\u0027 snapped Minerva, waving at the man to go away.\n \u0027There\u0027s a call for you.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not available. Take a number.\u0027\n The security guard persisted; he stepped into the room, one hand cupped over the mouthpiece of a cordless phone.\n \u0027I think you might want to talk to this person. He says his name is Artemis Fowl.\u0027\n Minerva gave So to her full attention.\n \u0027I\u0027ll take it,\u0027 she said, reaching for the phone.\n The LEP recon field helmet is an amazing piece of equip-ment. The Section 8 field helmet, on the other hand, is a miracle of modern science. To compare the two would be akin to comparing a flintlock to a laser-sighted sniper rifle.\n Foaly had taken full advantage of his almost unlimited budget to indulge his every tech-head fantasy and stuff the helmet with every piece of diagnostic, surveillance, defence and just plain cool equipment he could cram in there.\n The centaur was vocally proud of the entire package. But if forced to pick just one add-on to brag about, he would go for the bouncing bags every time.\n Bouncing bags in themselves were not a recent addition. Even civilian helmets had gel bags in between their outer and inner shells, which provided a bit of extra buffering in case of a crash. But Foaly had replaced the helmet\u0027s rigid outer shell with a more yielding polymer and then swapped the electro-sensitive gel for tiny electro-sensitive beads. The beads could be controlled with electronic pulses to expand, contract, roll or group, providing the helmet with a simple but highly effective propulsion system.\n This little marvel can\u0027t fly but it can bounce wherever you want it to, Foaly had said earlier, when Holly was signing out her equipment. Only commanders get the flying helmets. I wouldn\u0027t recommend them though, the engine\u0027s field has been known to straighten perms. Not that I\u0027m saying you have a perm. Or need one for that matter.\n While No.l was being interrogated by Minerva, Foaly was flexing his fingers over the remote controls for Holly\u0027s Section 8 helmet. At the moment, the helmet was locked in a wire mesh strongbox at the rear of the security office.\n Foaly liked to sing a little ditty while he worked. In this instance the song was the Riverbend classic: \u0027If It Looks Like a Dwarf and Smells Like a Dwarf, Then It\u0027s Probably a Dwarf (or a Latrine Wearing Dungarees)\u0027. This was a rela-tively short title for a Riverbend song, which was the fairy equivalent of human country and western.\n \u0027When I got an itch I can\u0027t scratch,\n When there\u0027s a slug in my vole stew,\n When I got sunburn on my bald patch,\n That\u0027s when I remember you…\u0027\n Foaly had considerately switched off his mike, so Artemis would not have the chance to object to his singing. In fact he was using an extremely old hard-wired antenna to send his signal, in the hope that no one in Police Plaza would pick up on his transmission. Haven City was in lockdown, and that meant no communications with the surface. Foaly was knowingly disobeying Commander Ark Sool\u0027s orders, and he was quite enjoying himself doing it.\n The centaur donned a set of v-goggles through which he could see everything in the helmet\u0027s vista. Not only that, but the goggles\u0027 PIP facility gave him rear and side views from the helmet\u0027s cameras. Foaly already had control of the chateau\u0027s security systems; now he wanted to have a little peek through their computer files — something he could not do from Section 8 HQ, especially not with the LEP waiting to pounce on any signal coming out of the city.\n The helmet was naturally equipped with wireless omni-sensor capabilities, but the closer he could get to an actual hard drive, the quicker the job could be completed.\n Foaly pressed a combination key command on his v-keyboard. To anyone watching, it would have seemed like the centaur was playing an invisible piano, but in fact the v-goggles interpreted the movements as key strokes. A small laser pencil popped out of a hidden compartment just above the right ear-cushion of Holly\u0027s helmet.\n Foaly targeted the wire mesh box\u0027s locking mechanism.\n \u0027One second burst. Fire.\u0027 Nothing happened, so Foaly swore briefly, turned on his microphone, and tried it again.\n \u0027One second burst. Fire.\u0027\n This time, a red beam pulsed from the pencil\u0027s tip, and the lock melted into metallic mush.\n Always good to have the equipment switched on, thought Foaly, glad that no one had witnessed his mistake, especially not Artemis Fowl.\n Foaly targeted a desktop computer at the far side of the office with a glare and three blinks.\n \u0027Compute bounce,\u0027 he ordered the helmet, and almost immediately an animated dotted arrow appeared on the screen, dipping once to the floor and then rising to the computer desk.\n \u0027Execute bounce,\u0027 said Foaly and smiled as his creation rolled into life. The helmet hit the floor with a basketball ping then bounced across the room, directly on to the computer desk.\n \u0027Perfect, you genius,\u0027 said Foaly, congratulating himself. Sometimes his own achievements brought a tear to his eye.\n / wish Caballine could have seen that, he thought. And then, Wow, I must be getting serious about this girl.\n Caballine was a centaur he had bumped into at a gallery downtown. She was a researcher with PPTV by day and a sculptor by night. A very smart lady and she knew all about Foaly. Apparently Caballine was a big fan of the mood blanket, a multi-sensor massage and homeopathic garment designed by Foaly specifically for centaurs. So they talked about that for half an hour. One thing led to another, and now he found himself jogging with her every evening. Whenever there wasn\u0027t an emergency.\n Which there is now! he reminded himself, turning his attention back to work.\n The helmet was sitting next to the human computer keyboard, with its omni-sensor pointed directly at the hard drive.\n Foaly stared at the hard drive and blinked three times, selecting it on the screen.\n \u0027Download all files from this and any networked comput-ers,\u0027 instructed the centaur, and the helmet immediately began to suck information from the Apple Mac.\n After several seconds, an animated bottle on the v-goggles screen was filled to the brim, and burped. Transfer completed. Now they could find out exactly how much information these humans had, and where they were getting it from. But there was still the matter of back-up files. This group could have burned their information on to\u0027 CDs, or even sent it by email or stored it on the Internet.\n Foaly used the virtual keyboard to open a data charge folder and send a virus into the human computer. The charge would completely wipe any computers on the network, but before that it would run along any Internet pathways explored by these humans and completely burn the sites. Foaly would like to be a bit more delicate about it and just erase fairy-related files, but he couldn\u0027t afford to take chances with this mysterious group. The mere fact that they had avoided detection for so long was proof that they were not to be trifled with.\n This was a major virus to lob into a human system. It would probably crash thousands of sites, including Google or Yahoo, but Foaly didn\u0027t see that he had a choice.\n On Foaly\u0027s screen, the data charge appeared as a red flickering flame that chuckled nastily as it dived into the omni-sensor\u0027s data stream. In five minutes, the Paradizo\u0027s hard drives would be burned beyond repair. And as an added bonus, the charge would also attach itself to any storage devices within the sensor\u0027s range that bore the network\u0027s signature. So any information stored on CDs or flashdrives would disintegrate as soon as someone tried to load them. It was potent stuff, and there wasn\u0027t a firewall or anti-virus that could stop it.\n Artemis\u0027s voice issued from two gel speakers in jars on the desk, interrupting his concentration.\n \u0027There\u0027s a wall safe in the office. It\u0027s where Minerva keeps her notes. You need to burn anything inside it.\u0027\n \u0027Wall safe,\u0027 replied Foaly. \u0027Let\u0027s see.\u0027\n The centaur ran an X-ray scan on the room and found the safe behind a row of shelving. Given the time, he would like to scan all the contents, but he had a rendezvous to keep. He sent a concentrated laser beam the width of a length of fishing line into the belly of the safe, reducing the contents to ash. Hopefully he was destroying more than the family jewels.\n The X-ray scan revealed nothing else promising so Foaly sent the helmet beads spinning, toppling Holly\u0027s helmet off the desk. In a display of keyboard virtuosity, Foaly used the laser to carve a section from the base of the office door while the helmet was in mid-air. In two choreographed bounces the helmet was through the section and into the corridor outside.\n Foaly grinned, satisfied.\n \u0027Never even touched the wood,\u0027 he said.\n The centaur called up a blueprint for the Chateau Paradizo and superimposed it over a grid on his screen. There were two dots on the grid. One was the helmet, and the other was Holly. It was time the two were reunited.\n As he worked, Foaly unconsciously sang a verse of the Riverbend dirge.\n \u0027When my lucky numbers run out of luck, When I\u0027m stuck in the hole I tumbled into. When my favourite dawg gets squashed by a truck, That\u0027s when I think me some thoughts of you.\u0027\n On the planet\u0027s surface, Artemis winced as the song twanged through his tiny phone and along his thumb.\n \u0027Please, Foaly,\u0027 he said in pained tones, \u0027I\u0027m trying to negotiate on the other line.\u0027\n Foaly whinnied, surprised. He\u0027d forgotten about Artemis.\n \u0027Some people ain\u0027t got no Riverbend in their souls,\u0027 he said, switching off his microphone.\n Billy Kong decided that he\u0027d have a little word with the new prisoner. The female. If indeed she was female. How was he supposed to know for sure what class of a creature it was? It looked like a girl, but maybe demon girls weren\u0027t the same as human ones. So, Billy Kong thought he might ask it what exactly it was, among other things. If the crea-ture decided not to answer, Kong didn\u0027t mind. There were ways to persuade people to talk. Asking them nicely was one way. Giving them candy was another. But Billy Kong preferred torture.\n Back in the early eighties, when Billy Kong was still plain old Jonah Lee, he lived in the California beach town of Malibu with his mother, Annie, and big brother, Eric.\n Annie worked two jobs to keep her boys in sneakers, so Jonah got left with Eric in the evenings. That should have worked out fine. Eric was sixteen and old enough to look after his kid brother. But like most sixteen-year-olds, he had more on his mind than little brothers. In fact, sitting with Jonah was seriously interfering with his social life.\n The problem was, as Eric saw it, that Jonah was an outdoorsy kind of boy. As soon as Eric took off to hang out with his friends, Jonah would ignore his big brother\u0027s orders and head out into the California evening. And outdoors in the city was no place for an eight-year-old. So what Eric needed to do was devise a strategy that kept Jonah indoors, and allowed him to roam free.\n He came upon the perfect plan quite by accident one night, returning home after a late-night argument with his girlfriend\u0027s other boyfriend and brothers.\n For once, Jonah had not ventured out and was plonked in front of the TV watching horror shows on hacked cable. Eric, who had always been impulsive and reckless, had taken to sneaking around with the girlfriend of a local gangster. Now word had leaked out and the gang was after him. They had roughed him up a bit already, but he had got away. He was bloody and tired, but still kind of enjoy-ing himself.\n \u0027Lock the doors,\u0027 he called to his little brother, startling him out of his TV stupor.\n Jonah jumped to his feet, eyes widening as he noticed Eric\u0027s bloodied nose and lip.\n \u0027What happened to you?\u0027\n Eric grinned. He was that kind of person — exhausted, battered but buzzing with adrenaline.\n \u0027I got… There was this bunch of…\"\n And then he stopped, because the spark of an idea was ricocheting around in his head. He must look pretty beat-up. Maybe he could use this to keep little Jonah indoors while Mom was working.\n \u0027I can\u0027t tell you,\u0027 he said, dragging a smear of blood across his face with one sleeve. \u0027I\u0027ve sworn an oath. Just bolt the doors and close the shutters.\u0027\n Usually Jonah didn\u0027t have time for his brother\u0027s theatrics, but tonight there was blood, and horror on the TV, and he could hear footsteps pounding up the driveway.\n \u0027Dammit, they\u0027ve found me,\u0027 swore Eric, peeking through a shutter.\n Little Jonah grabbed his brother\u0027s sleeve.\n \u0027Who\u0027s found you, Eric? You gotta tell me.\u0027\n Eric appeared to consider it.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027I belong to a… uh… secret society. We fight a secret enemy.\u0027\n \u0027What, like a gang?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Eric. \u0027We fight demons.\u0027\n \u0027Demons?\u0027 said little Jonah, half sceptical, half scared out of his wits.\n \u0027Yeah. They\u0027re all over California. By day, they\u0027re normal guys. Accountants and basketball players, stuff like that. But at night they peel off their skin and go hunting kids. Under tens.\u0027\n \u0027Under tens? Like me.\u0027\n \u0027Like you. Exactly like you. I found these demons chew-ing on a couple of twin girls. Maybe eight years old. I killed most of \u0027em, but a few must\u0027ve followed me home. We gotta stay real quiet and they\u0027ll go away.\u0027\n Jonah rushed for the phone. \u0027We should call Mom.\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Eric, snatching the phone. \u0027You want to get Mom killed? Is that what you want?\u0027\n The idea of his mother dying started Jonah crying. \u0027No. Mom can\u0027t die.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Eric gently. \u0027You gotta leave the demon-slaying to me and my boys. When you\u0027re fifteen, then you get to be sworn in, but until then, this is our secret. You stay in the house and let me do my duty. Promise?\u0027\n Jonah nodded, blubbering too much to say the word.\n And so the brothers sat huddled on the sofa while Eric\u0027s girlfriend\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s brothers battered on the windows and called him out.\n This is a cruel trick, Eric thought. Maybe I\u0027ll just let it run jot a couple of months. It\u0027ll keep the kid out of trouble until every-thing dies down.\n The deception worked well. Jonah didn\u0027t set foot outside the house after dusk for weeks. He sat on the settee, with his knees drawn to his chin, waiting for Eric to return with elaborate demon-slaying stories. Every night, he feared that his brother would not return, that the demons would kill him.\n One night his fears came to pass. The cops said that Eric had been killed by a notorious gang of brothers who had been gunning for him. Something about a girl. But Jonah knew different. He knew the demons had done it. They had peeled off their faces and killed his brother.\n So Jonah Lee, now known as Billy Kong, was going in to see Holly carrying the weight of his childhood memories. For the sake of his sanity, he had managed to convince himself over the decades that there were no demons, and that his beloved brother had lied to him. This betrayal had messed him up for years, preventing him forming lasting relationships, and making it a lot easier for him to hurt people. And now this crazy Minerva girl was paying him to help her to hunt down actual demons, and it turns out they are real. He had seen them with his own eyes.\n At this stage Billy Kong couldn\u0027t tell fact from fiction. A part of him believed that he\u0027s had a bad accident, and that all of this was coma hallucination. All Billy knew for sure was that if there was the slightest chance that these demons were the same ones who killed Eric, then they were going to pay.\n Holly was not too happy playing the victim. She had enough of this in the Academy. Every time the curricu-lum threw up a role-playing game, Holly, as the only girl in that class, was picked to be the hostage, or the elf walking home alone, or the teller facing a bank robber. She tried to object that this was stereotyping, but the instructor replied that stereotypes were stereotypes for a reason, so get that blonde wig on. So when Artemis proposed that she allow herself to get caught, Holly took a bit of persuading. Now she was sitting tied to a wooden chair in a dark damp basement room, waiting for some human to come and torture her. The next time Artemis had a plan involving someone being taken hostage, he could play the part himself. It was ridiculous. She was a captain in her eighties, and Artemis was a fourteen-year-old civilian, and yet he was dishing out the orders and she was taking them.\n That\u0027s because Artemis is a tactical genius, said her sensible side.\n Oh, shut up, responded her irritated side eloquently.\n And then Billy Kong came into the room and proceeded to irritate Holly even further. He glided across the floor like a pale, hair-gelled ghost, circling Holly silently several times before speaking.\n \u0027Tell me something, demon. Can you peel off your face?\u0027\n Holly met his eyes. \u0027With what? My teeth? Hands tied, moron.\u0027\n Billy Kong sighed. Lately everyone under five feet seemed to think it was their prerogative to give him verbal abuse.\n \u0027You probably know I\u0027m not supposed to kill you,\u0027 said Billy, teasing his hair into spikes. \u0027But I often do things that I\u0027m not supposed to.\u0027\n Holly decided to crack this human\u0027s confidence a little.\n \u0027I know that, Billy, or should I say, Jonah. You\u0027ve done a lot of bad things over the years.\u0027\n Kong took a step back. \u0027You know me?\u0027\n \u0027We know all about you, Billy. We\u0027ve been watching you for years.\u0027\n This wasn\u0027t strictly true, of course. Holly knew no more about Kong than Foaly had told her. Perhaps she wouldn\u0027t have baited him if she\u0027d known about his demon history.\n To Billy Kong, this simple statement was confirmation of everything Eric had told him. Suddenly the building blocks of his beliefs and understandings toppled and smashed beyond repair.\n It was all true. Eric had not lied. Demons walked the Earth and his brother had tried to protect him and paid with his life.\n \u0027You remember my brother?\u0027 he asked, his voice shaking.\n Holly presumed that this was a test. Foaly had mentioned a brother.\n \u0027Yes. I remember. Derek, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Kong pulled a stiletto from his breast pocket, gripping it so tightly his knuckles whitened.\n \u0027Eric!\u0027 he shouted, spittle spraying from his mouth. \u0027It was Eric! Do you remember what happened to him?\u0027\n Holly felt suddenly nervous. This Mud Man was un-stable. It would only take her a second to escape from these bonds, but maybe a second was too long. Artemis had requested that she remain bound for as long as possible, but from the look on Billy Kong\u0027s face it seemed as if stay-ing bound could be a fatal mistake.\n \u0027Do you remember what happened to my brother?\u0027 asked Kong again, waving the knife like a conductor\u0027s baton.\n \u0027I remember,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027He died. Violently.\u0027\n Kong was thunderstruck. Reeling internally. For several moments he circled the room muttering to himself, which didn\u0027t encourage Holly any.\n \u0027It\u0027s true. Eric never betrayed me! My brother loved me. He loved me and they took him!\u0027\n Holly took advantage of this lack of focus to escape from the plastic ties binding her wrists. She did this using an old LEP trick taught to her by Commander Vinyaya back in the Academy. She rubbed her wrists against the rough edge, causing two small grazes. When magical sparks erupted from her fingertips to heal the wounds, she siphoned a few off to melt the plastic enough for her to yank her way out.\n When Kong faced Holly again, she was untethered, but concealing the fact.\n Kong knelt before her so their eyes were level. He was blinking rapidly and his pulse beat in a temple vein. He spoke slowly, in a voice fraught with barely repressed madness and violence. He had switched to Taiwanese, his family\u0027s first language.\n \u0027I want you to peel off your face. Right now.\u0027\n This, reasoned Kong, would be the final proof. If this demon could peel off her face, then he would stab her in the heart and damn the consequences.\n \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027My hands are tied. Why don\u0027t you peel it off for me? We have new masks now. Disposable. They come off easily.\u0027\n Kong coughed in surprise, rocking back on his hunkers.\n Then he steadied himself and reached out shaking hands. His hands did not shake from fear, but from anger and sorrow that he had dishonoured his brother\u0027s memory by believing the worst of him.\n \u0027At the hairline,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Just grab and pull, don\u0027t worry if you tear it.\u0027\n Kong looked up, and they made eye contact. This was all Holly needed to employ the magical fairy mesmer.\n \u0027Don\u0027t those arms feel heavy?\u0027 she asked, her voice layered and irresistible.\n Kong\u0027s brow suddenly creased, and the creases filled with sweat.\n \u0027My arms. What? They\u0027re like lead. Like two lead pipes. I can\u0027t…\u0027\n Holly pushed the mesmer a little harder. \u0027Why don\u0027t you put them down. Take it easy. Sit on the floor.\u0027\n Kong sat on the concrete. \u0027I\u0027m just going to sit for a second. We\u0027re still doing the face-peeling thing. But in a second. I\u0027m tired.\u0027\n \u0027You probably feel like talking.\u0027\n \u0027You know what, demon. I feel like talking. What should we talk about?\u0027\n \u0027This whole group you\u0027re involved with, Billy. The Paradizos. Tell me about them.\u0027\n Kong snorted. The Paradizos! You\u0027re only dealing with one Paradizo here. And that\u0027s the girl, Minerva. Her daddy is just a money man. If Minerva wants it, Gaspard pays for it. He\u0027s so proud of his little girl the genius that he does whatever she says. Can you believe that she convinced him to keep the whole demon thing quiet until after the Nobel Committee get a look at her research.\u0027\n This was very good news. \u0027You mean that no one outside this house knows about the demons?\u0027\n \u0027Hardly anybody inside the house knows. Minerva is para-noid that some other egghead will get hold of her work. The staff think we\u0027re guarding a political prisoner who needs his face redone. Only Juan Soto, the chief of in-house security, and myself were told the truth.\u0027\n \u0027Does Minerva keep records?\u0027\n \u0027Records? She writes everything down, and I mean everything. We have records of every demon action, right down to toilet breaks. She\u0027s got every twitch on video, the only reason that there\u0027s no cameras down here is that we weren\u0027t expecting anyone.\u0027\n \u0027Where does she keep these notes?\u0027\n \u0027A little wall safe in the security office. Minerva thinks I don\u0027t know the combination, but I do. Bobo\u0027s birthday.\u0027\n Holly touched a skin-coloured microphone pad glued to her throat. \u0027A wall safe in the security office,\u0027 she said clearly. \u0027I hope you\u0027re getting that.\u0027\n There was no reply. Wearing an earpiece had been too risky, so Holly had to make do with the mike pad on her neck, and iris-cam suckered like a contact lens over her right eye.\n Kong still felt like talking. \u0027You know, I\u0027m going to kill all of you demons. I\u0027ve got a plan. Real clever too. Miss Minerva thinks that she\u0027s going to Stockholm, but that\u0027s never going to happen. I\u0027m just waiting for the right moment. I know that silver is the only thing keeping you in this dimension. So, I\u0027m going to send you back and give you a little present to take with you.\u0027\n Not if I can help it, thought Holly.\n Kong half smiled at her. \u0027Are we doing the face-peeling thing? Can you really do that?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I can,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Are you sure you want to see it?\u0027\n Kong nodded, slack-jawed.\n \u0027OK, then. Watch carefully.\u0027\n Holly raised her hands to her face, and when she took them away, her head had disappeared. Her body and limbs quickly followed suit.\n \u0027Not only can I peel off my face,\u0027 said Holly\u0027s voice from thin air. \u0027I can do my entire body.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 croaked Kong. \u0027It\u0027s all true.\u0027\n Then a tiny invisible fist swished through the air, knock-ing him into unconsciousness. Billy Kong lay on the concrete floor dreaming that he was Jonah Lee once more, and his brother stood before him saying: I told you so, bio. I told you there were demons. They murdered me back in Malibu. So what are you going to do about it?\n And little Jonah answered: I\u0027m working on it, Eric.\n Minerva accepted the phone from the security guard.\n \u0027Minerva Paradizo speaking.\u0027\n \u0027Minerva, this is Artemis Fowl,\u0027 said a voice in perfect French. \u0027We met once across a crowded room in Sicily.\u0027\n \u0027I know who you are; we nearly met in Barcelona too. And I know it\u0027s really you. I memorized your voice pattern and cadence from a lecture you gave on Balkan politics two years ago at Trinity College.\u0027\n \u0027Very good. I find it strange that I haven\u0027t heard of you.\u0027\n Minerva smiled. \u0027I am not as careless as you, Artemis. I prefer anonymity, until I have something exceptional to be recognized for.\u0027\n \u0027The existence of demons, for instance,\u0027 prompted Artemis. \u0027That would be exceptional.\u0027\n Minerva gripped the phone tightly. \u0027Yes, Master Fowl. It would be exceptional. It is exceptional. So you can keep your Irish paws off my research. The last thing I need is for some bigheaded teenage boy to hijack all my work at the last second. You had your own demon, but that wasn\u0027t enough, you had to try and steal mine too. The moment I recognized you in Barcelona, I knew you would be after my research subject. I knew you would try to smoke us out, have someone hide in the car. It was the logical thing to do, so I booby-trapped the vehicle. You knocked out my baby brother too. How could you?\u0027\n \u0027Apparently I did you a favour,\u0027 said Artemis lightly.\n \u0027Little Bobo is obnoxious by all accounts.\u0027\n \u0027Is that why you called me? To insult my family?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 replied Artemis. \u0027I do apologize, that was juvenile. I called you to try and make you see sense. There is much more at stake here than a Nobel Prize, not to belittle the prize of course.\u0027\n Minerva smiled knowingly. \u0027Artemis Fowl, whatever your pretence, you called me because your plan failed. I have your demon and you want her back. But if it makes you feel better, please proceed with your good of humanity speech.\u0027\n Outside, on the bluff overlooking Chateau Paradizo, Artemis frowned. This girl reminded him a lot of himself eighteen months ago, when achievement and acquisition were everything, and family and friends were secondary. Honesty, on this occasion, actually was the best policy.\n \u0027Miss Paradizo,\u0027 he said gently. \u0027Minerva. Listen to me for a few moments — you will feel the truth of what I say.\u0027\n Minerva tutted. \u0027Why is that? Because we\u0027re connected?\u0027\n \u0027Actually we are. We are similar people. Both the most intelligent person in whatever room we happen to be in.\n Both constantly underestimated. Both determined to shine brightest in whichever discipline we pursue. Both dogged by scorn and loneliness.\u0027\n \u0027Ridiculous,\u0027 scoffed Minerva, but her protestations rang hollow. \u0027I am not lonely. I have my work.\u0027\n Artemis persisted. \u0027I know how it feels, Minerva. And let me tell you, no matter how many prizes you win, no matter how many theorems you prove, it will not be enough to make people like you.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, spare me your amateur psychology lectures. You\u0027re not even three years older than me.\u0027\n Artemis was injured. \u0027Hardly amateur. And for your information, age is often detrimental to intelligence. I have written a paper on the subject in Psychology Today, under the pseudonym Doctor C. Niall DeMencha.\u0027\n Minerva giggled. \u0027I get it. Senile Dementia. Very good.\u0027\n Artemis himself smiled. \u0027You are the first person to get that.\u0027\n \u0027I always am.\u0027\n \u0027Me too.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you find that tiresome?\u0027\n \u0027Incredibly. I mean, what is wrong with people? Everybody says that I have no sense of humour, then I construct a perfectly sound pun round a well-known psychological condition and it is ignored. People should be rolling in the aisles.\u0027\n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 agreed Minerva. \u0027That happens to me all the time.\u0027\n \u0027I know. I loved that Murray Gell-Mann kidnapping a quark joke that you did on the train. Very clever analogy.\u0027\n The congenial conversation ground to a frosty halt.\n \u0027How did you hear that? How long have you been spying on me?\u0027\n Artemis was quietly stunned. He had not meant to reveal that fact. It was most unlike him to chatter on about trifles when there were lives at stake. But he liked this Minerva girl. She was so like him.\n \u0027There was a security camera in the corridor, on the train. I procured the tape, had it enhanced and read your lips.\u0027\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027I don\u0027t remember a camera.\u0027\n \u0027It was there. Inside a red plastic bubble. Fisheye lens. I apologize for the intrusion of your privacy, but it was an emergency.\u0027\n Minerva was silent for a moment. \u0027Artemis. We could have a lot to talk about. I haven\u0027t talked this much with a boy in… well, ever. But I have to finish this project. Can you call me again in six weeks?\u0027\n \u0027Six weeks will be too late. The world will be a different place and possibly not a better one.\u0027\n \u0027Artemis. Stop it. I was just beginning to like you, and now we\u0027re back where we started.\u0027\n \u0027Just give me one more minute,\u0027 Artemis insisted. \u0027If I can\u0027t convince you in a single minute, then I will hang up and leave you to your research.\u0027\n \u0027Fifty-nine,\u0027 said Minerva. \u0027Fifty-eight…\u0027\n Artemis wondered if all girls were so emotional. Holly could be this way too. Warm one moment and icy the next.\n \u0027You are holding two creatures captive. Both sentient. Neither human. If you expose either one to the wider scientific community, then their kind will be hunted down.\n You will be responsible for the extinction of at least one species. Is that what you want?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what they want,\u0027 retorted Minerva. \u0027The first one we rescued threatened to kill us all, and possibly eat us. He said that the demons would return and wipe out the human scourge.\u0027\n \u0027I know all about Abbot,\u0027 said Artemis, using what he had learned from Minerva\u0027s own surveillance cameras. \u0027He was a dinosaur. Demons could never take on humans now. Judging by my temporal calculations, Abbot was whisked ten thousand years into his own future and then sent back again. Declaring war on demons would be like declaring war on monkeys. In fact, monkeys would be a bigger threat. There are more of them. And anyway, the demons can\u0027t even fully materialize unless we shoot them full of silver.\u0027\n \u0027I am sure they will find a way around that. Or one could get through accidentally, just like Abbot, then open the gates for the rest of them.\u0027\n \u0027Highly unlikely. I mean really, Minerva, what are the odds?\u0027\n \u0027So, Artemis Fowl wants me to forget all about my Nobel project and turn my demon captives loose.\u0027\n \u0027Forget the project certainly,\u0027 said Artemis, checking his watch. \u0027But I don\u0027t think there is any need for you to set your captives free.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, really? And why is that?\u0027\n \u0027Because I imagine they are already gone.\u0027\n Minerva spun round to face the spot where No.l had been sitting. It was empty: her captive demon had dis-appeared along with his chair. A perfunctory sweep told her the entire room was empty, except for her.\n \u0027Where is he, Artemis?\u0027 she screamed into the phone. \u0027Where is my prize?\u0027\n \u0027Forget about all of this,\u0027 said Artemis softly. \u0027It\u0027s not worth it. Take it from someone who has made your mistakes. I will call you soon.\u0027\n Minerva squeezed the phone as though it were Artemis\u0027s neck.\n \u0027You tricked me!\u0027 she said, the truth suddenly dawning on her. \u0027You allowed me to capture your demon!\u0027\n But Artemis did not reply. He had reluctantly closed his fist on the conversation. Generally, outsmarting someone gave him a warm and fuzzy feeling, but hoodwinking Minerva Paradizo just made him feel like a sneak. It was ironic that he felt like a bad guy, now that he was almost a good guy.\n Butler glanced across at him from his perch on the knoll.\n \u0027How did that go?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Your first lengthy conver-sation with a girl your own age?\u0027\n \u0027Fabulous,\u0027 said Artemis, voice dripping with sarcasm. \u0027We\u0027re planning a June wedding.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/214.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
