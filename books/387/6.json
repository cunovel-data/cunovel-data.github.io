{"id":40839,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6 Dwarf Walks Into A Bar","content":"THE LOWER ELEMENTSMulch Diggums strolled through Haven\u0027s Market District, feeling more relaxed with every step. The Market District was a lowlife zone, as much as you could have a lowlife zone on a street which boasted two hundred cameras and a permanent LEP cabin on the corner. But even so, criminals outnumbered civilians here eight to one. My kind of people, thought Mulch. Or at least they used to be before I threw in with Holly.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t that Mulch regretted teaming up with Holly, but sometimes he did miss the old days. There was some-thing about thievery that made his heart sing. The thrill of the snatch, the euphoria of easy money.\\n\\n Don\u0027t forget the despair of prison, his practical side reminded him. And the loneliness of life on the run.\\n\\n True. Crime wasn\u0027t all fun and games. It had minor downsides, like fear, pain and death. But Mulch had been able to ignore those for a long time, until Commander Julius Root had been killed by a criminal. Until then it had all been a game. Julius was the cat and he was the elusive mouse. But with Julius gone, returning to a life of crime would seem like a slap in the face to the commander\u0027s memory.\\n\\n And that\u0027s why I like this new job so much, concluded Mulch happily. / get to run around behind the LEP\u0027s back and consort with known criminals.\\n\\n He had been watching talk shows in the Section 8 lounge when Foaly had come cantering in. Truth be told, Mulch liked Foaly. They knocked sparks off each other whenever they met, but it kept both of them on their toes, or hooves, whichever the case may be.\\n\\n In this instance, there had been no time for tomfoolery, and Foaly had brusquely explained the situation above ground. They did have a plan, but it hinged on Mulch\u0027s abil-ity to find the pixie smuggler Doodah Day and bring him back to Section 8.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s going to take some doing,\u0027 noted Mulch. \u0027The last time I saw Doodah, he was scraping dwarf gunge off his boots. He doesn\u0027t like me very much. I\u0027m going to need leverage.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You tell that pixie that if he helps us out he\u0027s a free fairy. I\u0027ll go into the system myself and wipe his record.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch raised his shaggy eyebrows. \u0027It\u0027s that important?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s that important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saved this city,\u0027 grumbled the dwarf. \u0027Twice in fact! Nobody ever wiped my record. This pixie goes on one mission and poof, he walks. What do I get? Seeing as we\u0027re handing out wishes.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly stamped a hoof impatiently. \u0027You get your exor-bitant consultant\u0027s fee. Whatever. Just get on this. Do you have any way to track Mister Day down?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch whistled. \u0027It\u0027s going to be devilishly tough. That pixie will have gone to ground after this morning. But I have certain skills. I can do it.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly glowered at him. \u0027That\u0027s why you get paid the big bucks.\u0027\\n\\n In fact, finding Doodah was not going to be quite as devilishly difficult as Mulch had pretended. The last thing Mulch had done before waving a cheery goodbye to Doodah Day was to slip a tracker pill down his boot.\\n\\n The tracker pills had been a gift from Foaly. He liked to pass redundant equipment to Holly to help keep the agency afloat. The pills were made from a baked adhesive gel that started to melt as soon as you popped it from its foil case. The gel stuck to whatever it was touching and adopted its colour. Inside was a tiny transmitter that emit-ted harmless radiation for up to five years. The tracking system was not very sophisticated. Each pill left its signa-ture on the individual foil cases, so the case glowed when-ever it detected the signature radiation. The brighter the glow, the closer the pill.\\n\\n Idiotproof, Holly had quipped, issuing the pills.\\n\\n And idiotproof they were proving to be. Barely ten minutes after leaving Section 8, Mulch had tracked Doodah Day to the Market District. By the dwarf\u0027s reckoning, his quarry was somewhere within a twenty-metre radius. The most likely place was the fish bar across the street. Pixies loved fish. Especially shellfish. Especially, especially protected shellfish such as lobster. Which was why Doodah\u0027s smuggling skills were so much in demand.\\n\\n Mulch crossed the street, adjusted his expression to fear-some and barged into Happy as a Clam as if he owned the place.\\n\\n The bar was ostensibly a dive. The floor was bare boards and the air stank of week-old mackerel. The menu was written on the wall in what looked like fish blood, and the only customer appeared to be asleep in a bowl of chowder.\\n\\n A pixie waiter glared at him from behind a knee-high counter.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a dwarf bar down the street,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Mulch flashed him a toothy grin. \u0027Now that\u0027s not very hospitable. I could be a customer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not likely,\u0027 said the waiter. \u0027I never saw a dwarf pay for a meal yet.\u0027\\n\\n It was true. Dwarfs were scroungers by nature.\\n\\n \u0027You got me,\u0027 admitted Mulch. \u0027I\u0027m no customer. I\u0027m looking for someone.\u0027\\n\\n The waiter gestured at the almost deserted restaurant. \u0027If you don\u0027t see him, he ain\u0027t here.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch flashed a very shiny LEP temporary deputy badge that Foaly had issued. \u0027I think I might take a closer look.\u0027\\n\\n The waiter ran out from behind his counter. I think you might need a warrant to take one more step, cop.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch brushed him aside. \u0027I\u0027m not that kind of cop, pixie.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch followed the transmitter\u0027s signal through the main restaurant down a shabby corridor and into the restrooms, which were even shabbier. Even Mulch winced, and he burrowed in mud for a living.\\n\\n One cubicle had an \u0027Out of order\u0027 sign on the door. Mulch squeezed into the pixie-sized space and quickly located the secret door. He wormed his way through into a far more salubrious room than the one he had just left. There was a velvet-lined cloakroom box, staffed by a rather surprised pixie in a pink dress.\\n\\n \u0027Do you have a reservation?\u0027 she asked haltingly.\\n\\n \u0027More than one,\u0027 replied Mulch. \u0027For starters, do you think it\u0027s a good idea to put the secret entrance to an ille-gal restaurant in a toilet? It didn\u0027t fool me, and I think I lost my appetite.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch did not wait for an answer. Instead he bowed under a low lintel into an opulent main restaurant. Here dozens of pixies were tucking into steaming plates of shellfish. Doodah Day was alone at a table for two, crack-ing a lobster with a hammer as if he hated it.\\n\\n Mulch walked over, ignoring the surprised glares from other diners.\\n\\n \u0027Thinking about someone?\u0027 he asked, lowering himself into a tiny pixie chair.\\n\\n Doodah glanced up. If he was surprised, he hid it well.\\n\\n \u0027You, dwarf. I\u0027m imagining that this claw is your fat head.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah brought the hammer down hard, splattering Mulch with white lobster meat.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, watch it! That stinks.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah was livid. \u0027That stinks! That stinks! I\u0027ve taken three showers. Three! And I can\u0027t get the stink of your mouth offa me. It follows me like my own personal sewer. You see I\u0027m eating alone. Usually I got me a table full of buddies, but not today. Today I smell like dwarf.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was unperturbed. \u0027Hey, easy, little guy. I could get offended.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah waved the hammer. \u0027You see anyone in here caring how you feel? Offended or otherwise.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch took a deep breath. This was going to be a hard sell.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, OK, Doodah. Point made. You\u0027re a real wise guy. A ticked-off wise guy. But I got an offer for you.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah laughed. \u0027You got an offer for me? I got an offer 138\\n\\n for you. Why don\u0027t you get your dwarf stink outta here before I crack your teeth with this hammer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I get it,\u0027 said Mulch testily. \u0027You\u0027re a tough little guy, and mean too. And a dwarf would have to be crazy to mess with you. Generally I would sit here for a couple of hours, trading insults. But today I\u0027m busy. A friend of mine is in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah smiled broadly, raising a glass of wine in a mock toast. \u0027Well, dwarf, here\u0027s hoping it\u0027s that slippery elf Holly Short. \u0027Cause there\u0027s nobody I would rather see up to her pointy ears in something dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch showed his teeth, but he wasn\u0027t smiling.\\n\\n \u0027Actually, I\u0027ve been meaning to talk to you about that. You attacked my friend with a multimixer. Nearly killed her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nearly,\u0027 said Doodah, raising a finger. \u0027Just scared her is all. She shouldn\u0027t have been chasing me. I just smuggle a few crates of shrimp. I don\u0027t kill anyone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just drive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Just drive.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch relaxed. \u0027Well, Doodah, lucky for you, your driv-ing skill is the very thing stopping me unhingeing my jaw and chewing on you like one of those shrimp balls you got there. And this time who knows which end you\u0027d come out.\u0027\\n\\n The bravado instantly drained from Doodah\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m listening,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Mulch reined in his teeth.\\n\\n \u0027OK. So, you can drive anything, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely anything. I don\u0027t care if Martians built it, Doodah Day can drive it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good, because I got an offer for you. I\u0027m not particu-larly happy about it, but I have to run it past you anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go for it, Stinky.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch groaned internally. Their little band of adventur-ers needed another smart-ass like they needed ten years of bad luck.\\n\\n \u0027I need you for one day, to drive one vehicle, for one trip. You do that and you have amnesty.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah was impressed. It was an impressive deal.\\n\\n \u0027So all I gotta do is drive and you wipe the slate?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Apparently.\u0027\\n\\n Doodah tapped his forehead with a lobster claw. \u0027This is too easy, there\u0027s gotta be a catch.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027Well, it\u0027s going to be above ground and there\u0027ll be a lot of armed Mud Men chasing after you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah?\u0027 grinned Doodah through a mouthful of lobster juice. \u0027But what\u0027s the catch?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/212.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
