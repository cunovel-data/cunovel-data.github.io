{"id":40843,"no":10,"title":"Chapter10 Kong The King","content":"chateau PARADIZO\n Minerva Paradizo was simply furious. That odious Fowl boy had somehow stolen her research subject from right under her nose. And after all the money Papa had spent on security, even hiring that despicable Mister Kong. Sometimes Minerva wondered if all males were boors, except Papa of course.\n The grounds were a mess. Master Fowl had left quite a trail of destruction in his wake. The cars were so much scrap metal. The lawns were ploughed deep enough to plant vegetables, and the stink of smoke and oil had penetrated every corner of every room. Only a hurried phone call to the police station in Vence and a few improvised fabrica-tions about a generator accident had prevented the arrival of a police car.\n Once the fires were under control, Minerva called a staff meeting on the patio. Juan Soto, the security chief, her father, Gaspard, and of course Billy Kong, were in atten-dance. Mister Kong seemed more agitated than usual.\n \u0027Demons,\u0027 muttered the Malibu native. \u0027True, all true. I have a responsibility to my brother. Finish what he started.\u0027\n If Minerva had been paying attention to Billy Kong\u0027s words, she might have noticed a touch of the ominous about them, but Minerva was busy worrying about her own prob-lems. And in Minerva\u0027s opinion, her own problems were far more important than anyone else\u0027s.\n \u0027Can we focus here, everyone? You may have noticed that my project is in crisis.\u0027\n Gaspard Paradizo had just about had it with Minerva\u0027s project. So far, he had indulged her to the tune of one and a half million euros, but now his entire estate had been trashed. It really was too much.\n \u0027Minerva, cherie,\u0027 he said, smoothing back his silver hair. \u0027I think we need to take a step back from this. Perhaps quit while we\u0027re not too far behind.\u0027\n \u0027Quit, Papa? Quit? While Artemis Fowl conducts a paral-lel project? I think not.\u0027\n Gaspard spoke again, this time with a little iron in his tone. \u0027You think not, Minerva?\u0027\n Minerva blushed. \u0027Sorry, Papa. I am infuriated, that\u0027s all. This Irish boy swans in here with his troops, and just like that, ruins all our work. It is unbearable, no?\u0027\n Gaspard was seated, as they all were, at a wrought-iron table on the rear patio overlooking the pool. He pushed back his chair and circled the table to his daughter\u0027s seat. From her vantage point there was a spectacular view over the wooded gorge and down into Antibes. Nobody was very interested in the view on this evening.\n \u0027I think, Minerva,\u0027 he said, hunkering down beside her, \u0027that we have gone too far in this matter. There are other-worldly forces at work here. Danger follows these creatures, and I can no longer allow you to place yourself, or others, in harm\u0027s way. We fought a noble fight, and I am so proud of you that my heart may burst, but now this must become a government matter.\u0027\n \u0027It can\u0027t, Papa,\u0027 said Minerva petulantly. \u0027We have no records. No sources. Nothing. All our computer files and disks were destroyed.They even drilled the safe and burned everything in it. I think Artemis Fowl crashed Google and Yahoo. It\u0027s hopeless. How would it look, a little girl turn-ing up at the Department of Defence wittering on about monsters in the basement? I need evidence.\u0027\n Gaspard stood, his knees cracking. \u0027Evidence, little one? These are not criminals. I watched you talk with our visi-tor. He was alert, intelligent, he had done nothing wrong. He was not an animal. It is one thing to present the Nobel Committee with proof of an invasion through time, but quite another to hound innocent sentient creatures.\u0027\n \u0027But, Papa!\u0027 Minerva pleaded. \u0027One more try. I need a month to rebuild my time tunnel model, then I can make a materialization prediction.\u0027\n Gaspard kissed his daughter on the forehead. \u0027Look into your heart, my little genius. What does it tell you to do?\u0027\n Minerva scowled. \u0027Look into my heart? Honestly, Papa, I am not a Care Bear.\u0027\n \u0027Please, cherie,\u0027 said her father. \u0027You know I love you, and I respect your genius, but just for once, couldn\u0027t we go with the pony option? Couldn\u0027t I just get Justin Timber-guy to play at your birthday party?\u0027\n Minerva fumed for several moments, but she knew Papa was right. She had no business detaining intelligent crea-tures. It was cruelty, nothing less. Especially when they intended no harm. But she could not just give up. Minerva silently resolved that Artemis Fowl would be her next proj-ect. She would find out all about the Irish boy, and what he knew of demons.\n \u0027Very well, Papa,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027For you, I will forego my Nobel Prize. This year, at any rate.\u0027\n Next year will be different, she thought. When I know what Artemis Fowl knows. There are whole worlds just beyond my grasp.\n Gaspard embraced his daughter warmly. \u0027Good. It is for the best.\u0027\n The surgeon returned to his seat.\n \u0027Now. Mister Soto: damage report.\u0027\n The Spanish security chief consulted his clipboard.\n \u0027I have only a preliminary report, Monsieur Paradizo. I suspect we will be finding damage for many weeks. The vehicles are completely destroyed. Thankfully we do have war-zone insurance so we should have new cars within five working days. There is shrapnel in the pool. One piece pierced the skimmer and the wall, so we have a leak and no filtration. I know a man in Tourrettes sur Loup. Very reasonable and he can keep his mouth shut.\u0027\n \u0027How about the men?\u0027\n Soto shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know what they hit us with. Some kind of ray gun. Like Martians. Anyway, most of the men are up and about. A few have headaches. No other side effects except for Thierry, who has spent the past half an hour in the toilet. We hear the odd scream…\u0027\n Suddenly Billy Kong emerged from his mumbling daydream, slamming his palm on to the glass-topped iron table.\n \u0027No. This will not do. Absolutely not. I need another demon.\u0027\n Gaspard frowned. \u0027That unhappy experiment is over. I should never have allowed it. I was blinded by pride and ambition. There will be no more demons in this house.\u0027\n \u0027Unacceptable,\u0027 said Kong, as though he were the employer and not the employee. \u0027Eric\u0027s work must be completed. I owe him that much.\u0027\n \u0027Now listen here, Mister,\u0027 said Soto sternly. \u0027What you find unacceptable is hardly an issue. You and your men were subcontracted to do a job, and that job does not include pronouncements on what is acceptable and what is not.\u0027\n As he spoke, Kong checked his hair in the small mirror he carried everywhere.\n \u0027You need to understand a few things, Paradizo. First, you are not in charge here. Not really. Not since my men and I joined your little group. Second, I don\u0027t generally work on this side of the law. My speciality is taking what-ever I want by any means necessary. I only signed on for babysitting duty because I owe these demons a little payback. A lot of payback actually. I know little Minerva just wanted to take photos of her guests and ask them a lot of psych questions, but I have my own plan for them. Something a little more painful.\u0027\n Gaspard turned his head towards Soto.\n \u0027Mister Soto. Do you have a response to this outrageous statement?\u0027\n \u0027I do indeed,\u0027 blustered Juan Soto. \u0027How dare you speak to Monsieur Paradizo in this fashion. You are an employee here, that is all. As a matter of fact, you are no longer an employee. Your contract is terminated. You have one hour to vacate your room and be off the premises.\u0027\n Billy Kong\u0027s grin was as dangerous as a shark\u0027s. \u0027Or else what?\u0027\n \u0027Or else my guards will remove you. I would remind you that there are only four men in your group and five times that number in mine.\u0027\n Kong winked at him. \u0027Perhaps. But my four are the best.\u0027\n He flipped his jacket lapel to reveal a small clip-on micro-phone.\n \u0027I am moving up the schedule,\u0027 he said into the mike. \u0027Open the horse.\u0027\n Soto was puzzled.\n What was this idiot talking about? Horses?\n \u0027Where did you get that microphone? Is that from the strongbox? Channels are to be kept clear for official trans-missions.\u0027\n But Minerva caught the Iliad reference. Opening the horse could only refer to the Wooden Horse of Troy. Kong had planted traitors in the camp.\n \u0027Papa,\u0027 she said urgently. \u0027We must leave.\u0027\n \u0027Leave? This is my house. I have agreed to almost everything you have asked of me, cherie, but this is ridiculous…\u0027\n Minerva pushed back her chair, racing round the table.\n \u0027Please, Papa. We are in danger here.\u0027\n Soto tutted. \u0027Mademoiselle is in no danger. My men will protect you. Perhaps the strain of the day has made you irritable. Maybe you should take a nap.\u0027\n Minerva scowled in frustration. \u0027Can\u0027t you see what is happening here? Mister Kong has given a signal to his men. Possibly they are already in charge. He has come among us as a wolf in sheep\u0027s clothing.\u0027\n Gaspard Paradizo was well aware of his daughter\u0027s intelligence.\n \u0027Soto? Is this possible?\u0027\n \u0027Impossible!\u0027 declared Juan Soto, but behind his enraged blushes was a tinge of pallor. Something about Kong\u0027s grin-ning calmness unnerved him. And, truth be told, he was not quite the soldier that his resume declared him to be. True, he had spent a year with the Spanish peacekeeping force in Namibia, but he\u0027d been attached to a journalist for the entire tour and had never participated in any action. He had got by in this job with mere bluster and a rudi-mentary knowledge of weaponry and tactics. But if some-one were to come along who actually knew what he was talking about…\n Soto reached to his belt, snicking off a walkie-talkie.\n \u0027Impossible,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027But to reassure you, I will double the guard and instruct my team to be on alert.\u0027 He clicked the \u0027Talk\u0027 button. \u0027Report in pairs. From the top.\u0027\n Soto released the button, filling the air with static. The empty hiss seemed more ominous than a ghost\u0027s howl. This went on for several seconds. Soto tried valiantly to maintain a jaunty confidence, but was betrayed by a bead of sweat rolling down his forehead. \u0027Equipment malfunction,\u0027 he said weakly.\n Billy Kong shook his head.\n \u0027Two shots,\u0027 he said into his lapel mike.\n Barely a second later, two sharp cracks echoed across the estate.\n Kong grinned. \u0027Confirmation,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m in control here.\u0027\n Soto had often wondered how he would react if faced with actual danger. Earlier, when he had believed that they were under siege, he had panicked slightly, but followed procedure. This was different.\n Soto went for his gun. A practised pistol man could do this without looking down. Soto was not practised enough. By the time he glanced towards his holster, Kong had already leaped on to the table and knocked Soto uncon-scious.\n The security chief keeled over backwards with a dainty sigh.\n Kong sat atop the table, elbows resting on knees.\n \u0027I need that demon back,\u0027 he said, casually drawing a stiletto blade from a secret pocket in the sleeve of his jacket. \u0027How do we find him?\u0027\n Gaspard Paradizo smothered Minerva in his arms. Protecting every inch of his daughter.\n \u0027If you hurt her, Kong…\u0027\n Billy Kong rolled his eyes. \u0027No time for negotiations, Doctor.\u0027\n He twirled the blade between his fingertips, then snapped his wrist, flicking the stiletto at Gaspard. The weapon\u0027s handle thunked against the doctor\u0027s forehead, and he fell away from Minerva like a discarded coat.\n Minerva knelt, cradling her father\u0027s head.\n \u0027Papa? Wake up Papa.\u0027 For a moment she was a little girl, then her intellect kicked in. She checked her father\u0027s pulse and tapped the point of impact with her index and middle fingers.\n \u0027You are lucky, Mister Kong, not to be facing a murder charge.\u0027\n Kong shrugged. \u0027I\u0027ve faced them before. It\u0027s amazing how easy it is to elude the authorities. It costs exactly ten thou-sand dollars. Three for the face job, two for new papers and five for a really good hacker to create a computer past for you.\u0027\n \u0027Nevertheless, one more half-revolution of your blade and my father would be dead, and not merely unconscious.\u0027\n Kong pulled a second blade from his sleeve pocket. \u0027There\u0027s still time. Now, tell me how we go about finding our little friend.\u0027\n Minerva stood facing Kong, her fists clenched defiantly.\n \u0027Listen to me, idiot. That demon is gone. I have no doubt that his benefactors plucked the silver bullet from his leg as soon as they had him in the car. He is back on his island. Forget about him.\u0027\n Kong frowned. \u0027It makes sense. That\u0027s what I would do. Well, OK then, when is the next materialization?\u0027\n Minerva should have been terrified. Her ability to do anything besides witter and sob should have deserted her. After all, her father was lying unconscious, and the man who had put him in that state was sitting on her patio table, brandishing a knife. But Minerva Paradizo was no ordinary twelve-year-old. She had always displayed remarkable composure in times of stress. So, even though she was scared, Minerva was more than capable of communicating her scorn to Billy Kong.\n \u0027Where have you been for the past thirty minutes?\u0027 she asked, then clicked her fingers. \u0027Of course — asleep. I believe you people call it neutralized. And by a tiny demoness too. Well let me fill you in on what\u0027s happened. Our entire operation has been neutralized. I have no research, no calcu-lations and no subject. I am starting from scratch. In fact, I wish I was starting from scratch. Starting from scratch would be a dream come true. Last time I was handed the time-tunnel calculations; this time I have to work them out by myself. Now don\u0027t get me wrong, I could do it. I am a genius after all, but it will take at least seventeen months. At the very least. Comprenez-vous, Monsieur Kong?\u0027\n Billy Kong understood all right. He understood that this little pain in the rear was trying to blind him with science.\n \u0027Seventeen months, eh? How long if you had some incentive?\u0027\n \u0027Incentive won\u0027t change the laws of science.\u0027\n Kong leaped down from the table, landing soundlessly on the balls of his feet. \u0027I thought that was your speciality — changing the laws of science. Wasn\u0027t this project all about proving how every other scientist in the world is a dummy, except you?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not that simple…\u0027\n Kong began flipping his knife, catching it without so much as a glance at the blade. End over end it twirled, a silver fan in the air. Hypnotic.\n \u0027I\u0027m making it simple. I think you can get me a demon, and I think you can do it in less than seventeen months. So, here\u0027s what I am going to do.\u0027 He leaned down and heaved Juan Soto\u0027s chair upright. The security chief slumped forward on to the table.\n \u0027I am going to hurt Mister Soto. Simple as that. There is nothing you can do to stop that happening. This is a demonstration of my earnestness. It connects you with the reality of your situation. And then you know I mean busi-ness. So, after that, you start talking. And if you don\u0027t start talking, then we move on to lucky contestant number two.\u0027\n Minerva had no doubt that contestant number two was her father.\n \u0027Please, Mister Kong, there is no need for any of this. I am telling you the truth.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s please now, is it?\u0027 said Kong in mock surprise. \u0027And Mister Kong too. What happened to idiot and moron?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t kill him. He\u0027s a nice man. He has a family.\u0027\n Kong grabbed a bunch of Soto\u0027s hair, yanking his head back. The chief\u0027s Adam\u0027s apple stuck out like a plum.\n \u0027He\u0027s an incompetent,\u0027 snarled Kong. \u0027Look how easily your demon escaped. See how simple it was for me to take over.\n \u0027Let him live,\u0027 pleaded Minerva. \u0027My father has money.\u0027 Kong sighed. \u0027You\u0027re just not getting it, are you? For a smart girl you can be pretty stupid a lot of the time. I don\u0027t want money. I want a demon. Now stop talking and pay attention. There is no point in trying to negotiate.\u0027\n Minerva\u0027s heart sank as she realized just how far out of her depth she actually was. In less than an hour she had crossed over to a world of darkness and cruelty. And her own arrogance had led her to it.\n \u0027Please,\u0027 she said. She struggled to maintain her compo-sure. \u0027Please.\u0027\n Kong adjusted his grip on the knife. \u0027Don\u0027t look away now, little girl. Watch and remember who\u0027s boss.\u0027\n Minerva could not avert her eyes. Her gaze was trapped by this terrible tableau. It was like a scene from a scary movie, complete with its own soundtrack.\n Minerva frowned. Real life did not have a soundtrack. There was music coming from somewhere.\n The somewhere proved to be Kong\u0027s trouser pocket. His polyphonic phone was playing \u0027TheToreador Song\u0027 from Carmen. Kong pulled the phone from his pocket.\n \u0027Who is this?\u0027 he snapped.\n \u0027My name is not important,\u0027 said a youthful voice. \u0027The important thing is that I have something you want.\u0027\n \u0027How did you get this number?\u0027\n \u0027I have a friend,\u0027 replied the mystery caller. \u0027He knows all the numbers. Now, to business. I believe you\u0027re in the market for a demon?\u0027\n Minutes earlier Butler had pulled off the motorway at the airport exit, and crammed himself into the back seat beside Artemis and Holly. They had watched the drama unfold in the Chateau Paradizo on their tiny laptop.\n Artemis gripped his knees tight. \u0027I can\u0027t allow this. I won\u0027t allow it.\u0027\n Holly placed a hand over his. \u0027We have no choice, Artemis. We\u0027re clear now. This is not our fight. I can\u0027t risk exposing Number One.\u0027\n Artemis\u0027s frown cut a furrow from his hairline to the bridge of his nose.\n \u0027I know. Of course. But, still, how can this not be my fight?\u0027 He glanced sharply at Butler. \u0027Will Kong kill that man?\u0027\n \u0027Without a doubt,\u0027 replied the bodyguard. \u0027In his mind, it\u0027s already done.\u0027\n Artemis rubbed his eyes, suddenly fatigued. \u0027I am responsible, indirectly. I can\u0027t have a man\u0027s death on my conscience. Holly, you do what you have to do, but I need to save those people.\u0027\n \u0027Conscience,\u0027 said No.l. \u0027What a lovely word. The sh in the middle.\u0027\n It was plain that the imp was not actually listening to the conversation, just picking up on certain words. The incongruity of this simple statement made Artemis look across. His eyes rested for a moment on No.l \u0027s chest mark-ings. And suddenly he knew where he had seen them before. A plan hit him like a bolt of lightning.\n \u0027Holly, do you trust me?\u0027\n Holly groaned. \u0027Artemis, don\u0027t ask me that. I just know one of your outrageous plans is coming.\u0027\n \u0027Do you trust me?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Holly sighed. \u0027I do. More than anyone.\u0027\n \u0027Well then, trust me to get us all out of this. I will explain later.\u0027\n Holly was torn. This decision could affect the rest of her life, and the imp\u0027s too. And the effect could be to shorten them dramatically.\n \u0027OK, Artemis. But I\u0027ll be watching.\u0027\n Artemis spoke into his ring-phone. \u0027Foaly, can you put me through to Mister Kong\u0027s mobile phone.\u0027\n \u0027Not a problem,\u0027 replied the centaur from Section 8 HQ. \u0027But it\u0027s going to be the last thing I do for you. Sool has tracked my line out. In thirty seconds I\u0027m going to be shut down, and you\u0027ll be on your own.\u0027\n \u0027I understand. Put me through.\u0027\n Butler gripped Artemis\u0027s shoulder. \u0027If you call him, then he has the upper hand. Kong will want to choose where to meet.\u0027\n \u0027I know where we should meet. I just have to convince Mister Kong that the rendezvous point is his idea.\u0027 Artemis closed his fist, covering the phone. \u0027Quiet. It\u0027s ringing.\u0027\n \u0027Who is this?\u0027 snapped Kong.\n \u0027Mynameisnotimportant,\u0027saidArtemis.\u0027The important thing is that I have something you want.\u0027\n \u0027How did you get this number?\u0027\n \u0027I have a friend,\u0027 replied the mystery caller. \u0027He knows all the numbers. Now, to business. I believe you\u0027re in the market for a demon?\u0027\n \u0027So, you must be the great Artemis Fowl: Minerva\u0027s idol. I am so sick of you smart kids. Why can\u0027t you just boost cars or steal stuff like normal kids.\u0027\n \u0027We do steal stuff. Just bigger stuff. Now, are you inter-ested in my demon or not?\u0027\n \u0027I could be,\u0027 said Kong. \u0027What do you have in mind?\u0027\n \u0027A straight trade. I pick a public place, and we swap. My demon for your girl.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not picking anything, kid. I pick the rendezvous point. You called me, remember? What do you want with this girl anyway?\u0027\n \u0027Her life,\u0027 said Artemis simply. \u0027I do not like murder, or murderers. You and your crew walk out of there with one hostage, and we do a swap. It\u0027s a simple transaction. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve never released a hostage before.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m an old hand, kid. I\u0027ve been picking up ransoms for years.\u0027\n \u0027Good. I\u0027m glad we can do business. Now why don\u0027t you name your preferred location. I\u0027ll be wearing a burgundy tie. Pay attention to that. There are a hundred and one ways this could go wrong. If it does, the police could tie one of us up for a long time.\u0027\n In the getaway car, Holly frowned quizzically at Artemis. It wasn\u0027t like him to chatter. He calmed her with a look and a wave of his hand.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Kong. \u0027I just thought of somewhere. You know Taipei 101?\u0027\n \u0027In Taiwan?\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027One of the world\u0027s tallest buildings? You are not serious. That\u0027s on the far side of the world.\u0027\n \u0027I am deadly serious. Taipei is my second home. I know it well. You will have a tough enough time getting there by the deadline, so there will be no tricks. We will exchange on the observation deck at twelve noon, two days from now. If you don\u0027t show, then the girl takes the express eleva-tor down. If you see what I mean.\u0027\n \u0027I see. I\u0027ll be there.\u0027\n \u0027Good. Don\u0027t come alone. Bring the ugly guy with you, or the female. I don\u0027t care, I only need one.\u0027\n \u0027We have already released the female.\u0027\n \u0027OK. The guy then. You see how easy it is to deal with me. I\u0027m a reasonable man, unless I\u0027m crossed. So don\u0027t cross me.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027I won\u0027t.\u0027 And he said it with such conviction that, if you didn\u0027t know him, you would absolutely believe it.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/60/216.html","bookId":387,"book":{"id":387,"title":"Artemis Fowl:The Lost Colony失落的种族","description":"简介： Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony is the fifth book in the Artemis Fowl Series by Irish writer Eoin Colfer.
